        "text": "Riley\n\nThis is the Elliott Abrams interview as a part of the George W. Bush Oral History Project. Thank you for coming to Charlottesville. Before the tape began running we reviewed the ground rules, the most important being the confidentiality of the proceedings. The other thing we need to do is a quick voice identification. I’ll ask everybody to go around the table and say just a few words. I’m Russell Riley, the chair of the Presidential Oral History Program.\n\nLong\n\nI’m Stephen Long, assistant professor of political science at the University of Richmond.\n\nLeffler\n\nI’m Mel Leffler, professor in the history department here at UVA [University of Virginia] and a faculty associate of the Miller Center.\n\nPerry\n\nI’m Barbara Perry and I’m a senior fellow in the Presidential Oral History Program here at the Miller Center.\n\nAbrams\n\nThis is Elliott Abrams and I’m the victim here today.\n\nRiley\n\nVery good. The specimen. We normally like to begin with some biography. That’s tricky in your case because there is a lot of rich, relevant Washington experience before we get to the 43rd Presidency. You weren’t interviewed as a part of the project that we did on the [Ronald] Reagan Presidency, so we don’t have that on record.\n\nWe thought that what we would do rather than go through the chronology, where we might get bogged down, was just to take a little while and maybe ask you some thematic questions about your earlier experience as it relates to what happens in the 43rd Presidency. So I guess I’ll open it up with a kind of global question about what you yourself think to be maybe the most important experiences or episodes in your own career leading up to the time you joined George W. Bush in his White House.\n\nAbrams\n\nI was Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights in the first Reagan administration, first term. That’s what led me into the George W. Bush administration. It is actually a story worth telling.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nAbrams\n\nI was not part of the Bush campaign. I spoke once to Condi [Condoleezza] Rice by phone about how I thought he might inject some human rights issues into the campaign. He was elected. The administration took office and I was doing two things then. I was president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center [EPPC] in Washington but also chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom. I was actually an appointee of Speaker [Newt] Gingrich.\n\nWhen the administration took office we, the Commission, went to see the new administration. We didn’t get a meeting with the President right away, but we did with the new Secretary of State and the new National Security Advisor to discuss our issues. So I saw [Colin] Powell and Rice. Rice I believe I had never met; Powell I knew from the Reagan administration. After these two meetings, the other commissioners were present but I spoke more on behalf of the Commission. They both tried to hire me. Both of them had vacancies.\n\nIn the case of Powell it was to do Sudan, which was already a big issue, particularly with evangelicals. Ultimately I think it was Senator [John] Danforth who became the Envoy. But shortly after that Commission meeting, I think it was Rich Armitage who called and said, “You should do this.” Steve Hadley called and said, “You need to come work here.” Both of these offers were basically human rights in character. In the case of the White House, it was the NSC [National Security Council] Senior Director for Democracy, Human Rights and International Organizations. I had also been Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations in the Reagan years, so it was a good fit.\n\nI accepted the Powell job. Then about three hours later I called Rich Armitage back and said, “I unaccept,” at State; I don’t want to do that. I had been in the State Department for eight years, and this would be new at the White House. So I accepted that job. I had the democracy, human rights portfolio and the IO [International Organizations] portfolio, both of which I had had in the Reagan administration, and in that sense I think one could say that was the background to going to work at the White House.\n\nParenthetically, what happened to me in the Reagan State Department, [George] Shultz State Department, was that I was working in a global portfolio, but an awful lot of it in those days was Latin America. So when the Assistant Secretary for Latin America left, Shultz said to me, “You’re it. You should be the Assistant Secretary for Latin America.” Similarly in the Bush NSC, when the Senior Director for Near East and North Africa, Zal [Zalmay] Khalilzad, left or moved on, Condi asked me to take that job, which I did. So I am living proof, I think, that there is no such thing as regional affairs expertise.\n\nRiley\n\nWere there—\n\nLeffler\n\nLet me just ask a question on something you just said. When you spoke to Condi Rice during the campaign you said you spoke to her once and tried to infuse some focus or engage her on human rights. What was her reaction?\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t have a very strong memory of this. She was, as always, extremely friendly and courteous. I have no memory of what it is I advised her to say. I didn’t want Bush to be seen as either like his father or in the kind of [Henry] Kissinger, [Brent] Scowcroft realpolitik school and somewhat uninterested in human rights. That was really the purpose of the call. You don’t need to fall into that trap. There are a couple of things you could say that would not be particularly controversial but would be useful. What those were I have no memory. But she heard me out. She was friendly.\n\nPerry\n\nYou had also said that you were not a part of the campaign in 2000.\n\nAbrams\n\nRight.\n\nPerry\n\nWas that because of your position? You didn’t want to pick a candidate? Or was there another candidate you were supporting behind the scenes or otherwise?\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t remember why I didn’t get involved. Maybe it was EPPC. I was, as I recall it, much more favorably inclined to [John] McCain, but I didn’t get involved in his campaign either.\n\nLeffler\n\nI’d just like you to step back a little bit. Reflect for a moment or two on the intellectual experiences that shaped your thinking. Long before the Reagan administration, I know you worked for [Henry] Jackson and for [Daniel Patrick] Moynihan, but what were the factors? What would you say were the influences that shaped your orientation toward foreign policy broadly? What are the key influences shaping your intellectual or ideological dispositions?\n\nAbrams\n\nI’m probably as pure a case of neocon history as you’re ever going to find.\n\nRiley\n\nGood. We want to hear it.\n\nAbrams\n\nHaving started with Scoop Jackson, having published my first article ever in the New Leader magazine, now defunct, and my first in Commentary magazine in October 1972. I was, as an undergraduate at Harvard, chairman of the Americans for Democratic Action chapter there. I was a liberal Democrat but of the—I was for [Hubert] Humphrey in 1968, not for [Eugene] McCarthy or [Robert] Kennedy. I was the national chairman of Campus ADA [Americans for Democratic Action], which had a membership of about 20, so it is not quite as great a post as it might sound.\n\nIt did mean I would go to these meetings, which were interesting because we’re talking about 1968 here and that is when ADA was kind of a microcosm of the Democratic Party, because it was riven by Vietnam. ADA had been the coalition of trade unions, the AFL-CIO [American Federation of Labor–Congress of Industrial Organizations] that is, and Walter Reuther, George Meany, and anticommunist intellectuals of the Arthur Schlesinger variety and it was split over Vietnam and over McCarthy and over Humphrey.\n\nI note that I was for Humphrey by way of saying I don’t know what I’d say—Cold War Democrat, maybe that’s the way to put it.\n\nRiley\n\nCan I interrupt and ask was your family background also sort of liberal Democratic? Abrams: Yes, middle-class, Jewish, liberal Democrats of very standard variety. Adlai Stevenson was a saint, Eleanor Roosevelt was a saint, Franklin Roosevelt was a saint. I was always interested in politics and foreign policy, even as an undergraduate. So I’m not quite sure why I didn’t, like most of my classmates in the late ’60s, move further left, but I didn’t. This probably gets into the realm of psychiatry, but I didn’t.\n\nFor Humphrey in ’68, part of the old line ADA. Then went to England for a year, came back, went to law school. So intellectually that’s really where I was.\n\nPerry\n\nBefore we leave that period, how about Vietnam? Talk about your thoughts about that and coming out of college in ’69.\n\nAbrams\n\nI was always opposed to the kind of extreme ends of the antiwar movement. During the 1969 Harvard strike I was a co-founder of the Ad Hoc Committee to Keep Harvard Open, which was an anti-SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] movement. Part of this—I went to a private high school in New York City prior to going to Harvard called Elisabeth Irwin, which is the high school of the Little Red School House, which was, to use the term carefully and deliberately, a communist school. My parents didn’t know that. They sent me there. They only knew that it had a good rep for getting people into college.\n\nCommunist in the sense that many of the teachers had been thrown out of the New York City public school system for being party members and many of the parents were in fact party members, former party members. One of the teachers, a substitute teacher, was the wife or widow, I can’t remember at that point, of Morton Sobell, the nuclear spy. In the school were the [Robert and Michael] Meeropols, the boys who were the sons of the [Julius and Ethel] Rosenbergs. I’m using the term “communist” carefully, not as a smear. I reacted against it. This was not my family background. My father was an immigration lawyer whose clients were people whose main goal in life was to be an American. Maybe that was one of the things that pushed me in that direction.\n\nMy views on the Vietnam war were essentially that it didn’t seem like a very good idea, but not that it told you what a horrible, Fascist country America was.\n\nIn one of these ADA meetings there was a fellow around named Richard Perle, who worked for Scoop Jackson and he introduced me to Scoop one Sunday. That’s how I met Scoop. Then when he ran for President in ’72, I was in law school. Jackson ran in the Massachusetts primary, so I worked for him. I got to meet him a few more times and said, “If you actually are going to run in ’76 in a serious way, I want to come back,” and then did. That was the intellectual camp. I was pretty much there, but obviously the people to whom I was exposed in the Jackson campaign in ’76 and then working for Jackson—Moynihan for one also formed—\n\nLeffler\n\nDid you gravitate toward your interest in human rights as a result of working with Jackson? The Jackson-[Charles] Vanik issue, Jewish emigration from Russia, was that your sort of trajectory into human rights issues?\n\nAbrams\n\nIt was part—certainly a piece of it is Jackson and Soviet Jewry and some other relevant things. Jackson is very big on Christians in Lebanon. Moynihan then more broadly is involved in this. It is in the context of his time at the UN [United Nations]. I was not with him then, but the sort of opposition to the Soviet line in the Third World, the opposition to the notion that social and economic rights are the same as political rights. All of that became an interest. It became clearer to me meeting Moynihan, Irving Kristol, people like that, who were writing about this.\n\nWhen I joined the State Department, I actually worked on the Reagan campaign. After the campaign went, I wanted to go into the government.\n\nRiley\n\nThis is 1980?\n\nAbrams\n\nThis is November 1980. We win. I was trying to figure out: What do I do here? I had no regional expertise. I could not hope, I thought, to go into the Asian Affairs, European Affairs Bureau. But I thought because of Moynihan, the International Organizations Bureau. Now of course I had not worked for Moynihan at the UN, but it didn’t matter because I figured people would say, “Oh, Moynihan, yes, sure.” So I went to see Moynihan. I was no longer working for him. I left in the summer of ’79. This is a year later.\n\nI explained my thinking. I said, “I’m going to go see Bill Casey,” who had been chairman of the campaign and whom I had met, “and ask for this job.” It was Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs. “What do you think of that?” We were having lunch, and Pat in his inimitable way said, “Deputy Assistant Secretary? Deputy? No, that’s stupid. Tell him you want to be Assistant Secretary.” OK. Went to see Bill Casey. I said, “I want to be Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations.” He said, “Huh? OK, talk to [Alexander] Haig.”\n\nI got a call two weeks later from Al Haig offering me the job. So I went into IO. But you may recall that in the spring of 1981 the Reagan nominee for the human rights job, Ernest Lefever, withdrew his nomination because he could not be confirmed. What he had done—I mean, his views on human rights—Ernie had been my predecessor once removed at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, George Weigel being the interim. He said really dumb things about human rights, really what I would call foolish, right-wing remarks. It was a classic example of the contribution of neocons in thinking about those issues in what I would say was a much more sophisticated way.\n\nAnyway, Bill Clark, President Reagan’s close friend and then Deputy Secretary of State, and I had formed a relationship of trust. He had found very few people in the State Department he trusted and I was one of them. So he said, “Look. Haig wants to eliminate the Bureau of Human Rights. I think and the White House thinks that that is politically a bad idea, too controversial, but I don’t know what to do with it. I want to ask you to think about it.” So I thought about it. I came back to him and said, “First of all, I have a candidate for you. I have found someone who is suave and debonair, handsome, brilliant.” He said, “OK, fine, I get that point.”\n\nI had thought about it. I wanted to leave the IO Bureau because I was caught between Haig and [Jeane] Kirkpatrick, which was not pleasant. But I had a view of what a conservative human rights policy would be. He said, “Write it up.” So I did write it up, a memo that really was a terrific memo. I’m desperately unhappy. I can’t find a copy of it anywhere. It is known as the [William] Clark-[Richard T.] Kennedy memorandum because it was sent to the White House by Deputy Secretary Clark and Under Secretary for Management Kennedy. In it were a number of personnel matters as well as my memo.\n\nIt talked about basically what a neocon human rights policy would be. I thought that through. I wanted the job. I thought I could make a real contribution here. Everybody said, “If he is stupid enough to want this job, we should give it to him.” So they did.\n\nLong\n\nSo what was that view, substantively? Since you can’t find the memo, can you reflect on what you recall, tell us the substance?\n\nAbrams\n\nIn the Human Rights Report for I guess 1982 reflecting on 1981, there is a preliminary essay on this question, which was actually written by Charles Fairbanks and me. The view is that we should be serious about a human rights policy because we are the United States. We are not a country that is organized around a tradition of blood but rather around ideas. These ideas are central and we need to make them central to the extent possible in a foreign policy. We have to do that.\n\nWe also have to do that for Cold War purposes because it is one of our great weapons against the Soviet Union. If you accept that that is true—even if you don’t accept the first part but you do the second, the realpolitik part, then the policy cannot be a fraud. The line in the memo that [William] Safire later wrote a column about was, “A human rights policy means trouble.” You cannot just oppose communist regimes. You’re going to have to think about [Ferdinand] Marcos and you’re going to have to think about our friends in Latin America and you’re going to have to have a human rights policy with respect to them as well to have any credibility.\n\nI made both a realpolitik and an idealistic argument about the need for a human rights policy. I think we did pretty well, I must say. Not, frankly, while Haig was Secretary of State. He was not much interested in this. He gave an infamous press conference when he said, “What human rights was to the [Jimmy] Carter administration, counterterrorism will be for this administration.” In fact, while he was Secretary of State we didn’t do much. But Shultz had a very different view.\n\nI took this job in December 1981. Shultz came in the summer of ’82. So the bulk of the time I was there he was Secretary and he was interested in this. For example, though it pained him greatly to push very hard against the [Augusto] Pinochet regime because he knew so many of the economic figures in it and because they had a terrific economic policy, he did it, nevertheless. If I went to him and said, “They’ve closed another newspaper, we must do this,” he would shake his head and say, “Yes, we do have to do that.” He got it.\n\nRiley\n\nI don’t want to get bogged down on this, but there were two sort of precursor questions.\n\nAbrams\n\nBack to the Reagan Oral History Project?\n\nLeffler\n\nThis is fantastically interesting.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd it is very important. I only want to draw you back to an earlier time and ask you were there intellectual influences either as an undergraduate or during law school, the people that you worked with?\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, there were in college. In my first year I took Samuel Huntington’s course, Political Change and Political Order, which was fantastic and dazzling to me, new thoughts. I really had had a sort of [Karl] Marxist education. I didn’t know that at the time. In eleventh or twelfth grade I learned about the French Revolution. I also took as a freshman Samuel Beer’s course, which was one of the greatest courses I think in the history of American education. Talk about opening a young student’s mind.\n\nSo you get to the French Revolution in Beer’s course. There are varying theories. There is the Whig theory, the Marxist theory. To my amazement I had learned the Marxist theory. I thought I had just learned about the French Revolution. One of the things that I would say Beer was doing, though he was a liberal Democrat and Huntington obviously a Republican—no, I think he was a Democrat but a conservative Democrat. They were challenging.\n\nIn Huntington’s case I remember a lecture where he said, “Corruption is a very good thing in the Third World because it means that they’re moving from tribal affiliations to more open affiliations, which gives you greater hope of moving to an open economy, an open political system.” Wow, what an incredible thing to say. The residue basically is, “think.” The same thing for Beer—the purpose of that course was that in each of these, it was six important moments in history, the Nazi Revolution, the French Revolution, the Glorious Revolution—what happened here? Could it have gone another way? What is the point at which we want to argue that a democracy called Weimar should have called out the troops to crush this Nazi movement?\n\nAll of those were, I think, intellectual influences in at least one way, which was to say don’t accept the conventional wisdom. Also had Kissinger, some of the same. Particularly because the zeitgeist, if you’re talking about ’68, ’67, was at Harvard and elsewhere in academia, quite left. Here were people who were saying, “Wait a minute.” I don’t think that happened at LSE [London School of Economics] or at Harvard Law School. I think by then my leanings were pretty clear.\n\nRiley\n\nThen you mentioned Jimmy Carter briefly, but you’re sort of engaged in a kind of partisan transformation too in the 1970s.\n\nAbrams\n\nIn the beginning not, in the sense that I’m a Democrat. I’m for Humphrey. We lose. But I’m for Scoop. He runs in ’76. April 26, 1976, we lose the Pennsylvania primary to Carter. He immediately endorses Carter. Why? Because Carter is the second most conservative Democrat, a southern Navy guy.\n\nThe Carter administration then carefully excluded from any positions everyone associated with Jackson. But the pattern is unspoken, so it had to be very carefully done. I am now working, let’s see. In ’76 I’m working for Moynihan. He gets elected in ’76, so I move over in January ’77. We are in opposition to this President, Jackson and Moynihan. Moynihan’s first or second Senate speech announced his opposition to the confirmation of Paul Warnke to head the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. So we were in essence in opposition but still in the party.\n\nIn the spring of 1980—wait a minute, I’m getting screwed up on numbers here—right, ’79, that was ’76. In ’79 I leave Moynihan. In the spring of 1980 it was obvious to people that the conservative Democrats—I don’t think the word “neocon” was around—the Jacksonites were unhappy with Carter. [Walter] Mondale arranged a meeting for us with the President, us being Norman Podhoretz, Midge Decter, Admiral [Elmo] Zumwalt, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Austin Ranney, Ben Wattenberg, me.\n\nLeffler\n\nMax Kampelman, was he there?\n\nAbrams\n\nMax Kampelman, yes. This is in the Cabinet Room. Mondale comes in and does a dazzling 15-minute presentation: Come home. You’re Democrats. Not this idiot from Hollywood. Really a terrific job. Then the President comes in. We had agreed Austin Ranney would represent us. So Austin Ranney began by saying, “Mr. President, we are Democrats who want to support you, and I have to say, we’re really happy with the way in which your foreign policy has changed since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.”\n\nThe President interrupts him and says, “My foreign policy has not changed. I don’t have two foreign policies. I have one foreign policy. It is the same one I’ve had since the day I came to office.” At which point everybody in the room looked at each other and said, “OK, let’s go.” [laughter] I suppose that everybody in that room except for Carter and Mondale voted for Reagan. It was the point at which many of us in that school said, “He is as bad as we think and we’re going to support Reagan.”\n\nSome of us did that—Ben Wattenberg didn’t, but many of us did, publicly. I actually worked on the campaign part time. When we won, the view of, I guess you could say, Reagan and Lyn Nofziger and certainly Bill Casey was, “We want the Reagan Democrats.” No one ever said to me, “You need to switch party, we can’t hire Democrats.” Reagan, having been a Democrat, seemed to really like the idea that Jeane Kirkpatrick was a Democrat.\n\nNow I’m talking about November 1980. In the fall of 1981 when I moved to the Human Rights Bureau, Nofziger did say to me, “How would you feel about becoming a Republican?” I recalled the great line of my mother-in-law, Midge Decter. “There comes a time when you need to join the side you’re on.” [laughter] So I said, “Yes, sure. I’m a Republican, let’s do it.” So I switched registration at that point.\n\nRiley\n\nOn the human rights portfolio had you been happy with Carter? Or had the Afghanistan, Cold War issues overwhelmed any favorable effect you had?\n\nAbrams\n\nWe had not been. We here I would say the Jackson camp. Maybe it’s better to say the Jackson-Moynihan camp because Pat had actually written some articles about it. Our view was that Carter was turning human rights into casework. The purpose of policy was to get this man or that man out of prison and there was no broader systemic effort to create democracies. That was the ideological—that was part of the criticism.\n\nThe other part of the criticism was that he seemed only to apply it to American allies so that he didn’t do much about Fidel Castro. He was beating up on people who certainly deserved it, but it was people like the Shah [Mohammad Reza Pahlavi] or [Anastasio] Somoza, or Marcos or people like that. Then there was a vacuum created because we were not trying to solve the problem, we were only criticizing. So yes, it is good to get rid of the Shah or Somoza, but then you have to fill that vacuum or you get disaster.\n\nThere was a famous—Shirley Christian, the New York Times correspondent covering Central America, wrote a book called Nicaragua: Revolution in the Family about Nicaragua where she interviewed Bob Pastor, who had been the Carter NSC Latin America guy. She asked him the question: You know that Somoza is falling apart; there are the Sandinistas. Why didn’t you create a new government? He said, “We were out of that business. We didn’t want to be in that business.” That was part of our critique, that we should be in that business.\n\nLong\n\nI’m just wondering. It’s hard not to get drawn into this, because this is an interesting period, certainly, but I wonder how much of a ready-made group of allies did you find once you made the transition after deciding that Carter wasn’t going to be going in the right direction on this stuff and you had to be in the Reagan camp? Did you find that there were people already on that side who were ready for this human rights message? Did your memo put you in the minority pushing against the majority, or was this already out there and just needed some more people and some more talking to make some progress?\n\nAbrams\n\nNo, it was a fight; it was always a fight. I was very lucky in that Shultz saw this. From my point of view not for ideological reasons but mostly for reasons of character. He just saw that this was an important thing to do for the United States. But there were fights over this.\n\nMany people close to the President—on some Latin America things Jeane was not with us at all. Actually, she and I had lots of fights over this and this period ruined our friendship pretty much. General Vernon Walters was totally opposed to this. The Latin America shop of the NSC was opposed to this policy. So this struggle, obviously you again see in the two, three Bush administrations, if you will.\n\nThere were allies. Some were traditional Republicans, like Shultz, for whatever personal or ideological reasons. Some were the other neocons. But I’d have to say—\n\nLeffler\n\nWho were your key allies would you say? Other than Shultz and the State Department, who was your key ally?\n\nAbrams\n\n[Paul] Wolfowitz.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat was later on.\n\nAbrams\n\nNo, Wolfowitz was the head of policy planning and then was moved by—I want to say Haig. I think it happened pretty early—to be Assistant Secretary for Asia.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat was later.\n\nAbrams\n\nOK, because I was already at Human Rights. So it had to be ’82 or ’83. Anyway, Paul tells the story that we were already friends. I went to see him when he became Assistant Secretary and said, “What are you going to do about Marcos?” He was clearly an ally and was throughout. On things like South Korea, the Philippines, he was terrific.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut you were arguing this case in late ’81, ’82, ’83 when some of the worst imaginable abuses were taking place in Central America, particularly in Guatemala. Your mention of General Walters, who goes down to Guatemala several times and comes back and wants to whitewash the issue.\n\nAbrams\n\nOn Latin America, other than people within the Human Rights Bureau, I would say no one. I remember a meeting, this would be ’82 maybe. There had been a phony election in Guatemala, the [Fernando Romeo] Lucas Garcia regime was then in place, which among bloody regimes has a very high standing. The question was whether to continue American military aid.\n\nI remember we had a meeting about this. I’m pretty sure Haig was still Secretary, so this is the first half of ’82. I remember saying at this meeting, “Here’s the thing, guys”—I think Bill Schneider, Under Secretary for Security Assistance, was the chair. “There would be no military aid to Guatemala. You’ve got to understand that. There is no possible way you’re going to get this past Ted Kennedy and Tom Harkin. You’re going to look bad if you try, but you’re going to lose as well. So there will be no military aid.”\n\n“The only question is, does the military aid get stopped by principled people in Congress against the bloody Reagan administration, or do you take a principled stand that you can’t.” Schneider and others in the room said, “You know, he’s right. Congress is not going to—” At that point in the administration that was the way you had to win the human rights argument. You couldn’t win it on ideological grounds; you could sometimes win it on pragmatic grounds. Very few other—on the ideological level Reagan got it, but not on the practical level.\n\nAt one point much later on we were trying to figure out what to do about Pinochet, who seemed to want to cling to power. How do you force him to do the referendum? The President at one point said, “Maybe I should invite him to Washington and talk to him about it,” at which point Shultz essentially fell out of his chair and said, [shouting] “No, no, no!” [laughter] NSC support I think had not really ever—some opposition, some indifference, but never support. In this sense Shultz was really the key, I’d say.\n\nLong\n\nMaybe this is something we’ll get into later, but I am curious about—looking from more distant perspective across the Presidencies, at which point did the American evangelicals really start to play a role in conversations at the top level about human rights? Certainly in the time of the early Reagan Presidency that wasn’t really a big part of it, right? It came in more in the Bush years. Could you talk a little bit about that?\n\nAbrams\n\nI’m not sure of the answer to that. My impression of it is Sudan.\n\nLong\n\nReally?\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, which is, let’s say, 2000. I don’t remember them having a foreign policy view in the Reagan years, in the ’80s. I wasn’t in the [George H. W.] Bush 41 administration so I don’t know, or obviously [William J.] Clinton. I don’t know. For me, I don’t remember feeling this. We got this some in the Commission on International Religious Freedom and that’s where I first feel these people exist and they care about foreign policy. Prior to that it had been they care about domestic policy. But here you were getting Franklin Graham and people like that who had big missions in Sudan. That was interesting. It was not Lebanon, it was not the defense of, say, Christians in the Middle East, it was Sudan the first time I really feel it.\n\nLong\n\nDid that stem into discussions about American policy on Israel at any point earlier?\n\nAbrams\n\nNot then.\n\nLong\n\nLater?\n\nAbrams\n\nNot that I recall. No.\n\nLeffler\n\nIn order to facilitate the transition from the Reagan years to the George W. Bush years maybe you could take two or three or four minutes to just tell us about the friendships you formed in the 1980s and ’90s that would then really shape the nature of your everyday interactions sometimes in the George W. Bush administration. Obviously you got to know Wolfowitz and you became friendly with Perle. But tell us about the nexus of associates that you developed in the 1980s and ’90s. Clearly you were part of the group that signed that letter to Bill Clinton in 1998 with regard to Iraq. Interestingly that letter says nothing about human rights or democracy. I’ve always been struck how a group of neocons could write that letter, saying support regime change in Iraq and saying nothing about human rights. I’m curious about that too.\n\nAbrams\n\nYes.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut tell us more about the texture of relationships that you think then would influence things during the George W. Bush years.\n\nAbrams\n\nI think by this time, by 2000, you have a less distinct group of neocons, but rather you have a group of what I’d call hardliners. So that for me in the Bush administration, for example, Richard Perle is not important, John Bolton is important. Bolton, whom I’d met in the State Department. Whatever differences may exist over some things, they don’t really exist at this point over foreign policy. In my view in any administration you have an org chart and many of the people in the org chart are not loyal to the President because they are career people. Not particularly loyal. I don’t mean they’re disloyal; they’re not particularly loyal to the President. Some are disloyal—we’ll get to the names later. [laughter] Then you have the org chart that nobody makes out of the real loyalists.\n\nIf you are in the administration you sort of figure out Who are my real allies here. There is always a struggle. There was in the Reagan administration, in the 41 and the 43 administrations. There are differences in foreign policy. There is a network, I’m sure there are 50 networks. No doubt this happens on domestic policy, but on foreign policy there is a hardliner network.\n\nYou go into the first term and it is clear, probably by January 21st, Colin Powell is a problem for us. Who is us? The hardliners. There is John Bolton, who is forced upon Powell in exchange as I understand it for Charlotte Beers. He wanted Charlotte Beers; he was forced to take John. OK, John is there. There are more hardliners at the NSC. Now, I didn’t get to the NSC on January 21st. These meetings I mentioned were probably April and I came on Memorial Day.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo who would you define as the hardliners on the NSC when you arrived? How would you characterize—when you say that are you thinking of Condi Rice? Are you thinking of Steve Hadley?\n\nAbrams\n\nI didn’t know them, so it was not clear to me for a while. The answer became yes, mostly because—again, I come on Memorial Day, it’s the summer. For me the administration largely begins after 9/11, but the President is a hardliner. Therefore Rice and Hadley are because Rice and Hadley at the NSC are completely loyal to the President, so they are pretty reliable hardliners.\n\nLeffler\n\nCan I interrupt? Because what you said is very important. Bush is a hardliner. The President is a hardliner. Please amplify. Talk extensively about that. How do you know he was hardliner? How do you define hardliner? What made George W. Bush a hardliner? Maybe you could preface it—how often did you meet with the President? How well did you know him? Are you comfortable making a statement like that? I don’t mean that in an impolite way, it’s just—\n\nAbrams\n\nNo, no, that’s true. As you know, people always exaggerate their exposure to the President, [laughter] with the exception of people like the Chief of Staff, the National Security Advisor, who really do, at least in the Bush White House, see him constantly. My exposure to the President—I’d never met the President until I got to be part of the White House staff. I remember my first Oval Office meeting, which was about immigration policy. He was standing around. Either I introduced myself to him or Condi said, “By the way, this is Elliott. He started on Monday.” He said, “Yes, I’m very glad you’re in the administration.”\n\nLong\n\nDid you get a nickname?\n\nAbrams\n\nHalf. He changed the “ls” into a “y” so it was “Eyiott.” I actually saw him this week when he spoke in Washington and he did it again.\n\nIn the first year and a half when I was Senior Director for Democ [Democracy, Human Rights, and International Organizations], as we called it, I would say I perhaps saw him once a month. In the second period, which was both the Senior Director job and the deputy job, I don’t know, twice a week. I saw him, meaning doing something together. It could be a larger meeting; more often I would see him in the Oval Office. There is also a little bit of foreign travel. Mostly it is meetings in the Oval Office. He is meeting someone and I am at that meeting, or—and this was a lot of it, actually, and it is a great part of it, an underestimated part of it, phone calls. Bush was very big on phone calls.\n\nWhen he would see me he would say, “When was the last time I talked to the King of Saudi Arabia” or, “I haven’t talked to [Hosni] Mubarak in a long time.”\n\nI’d say, “Yes, it has been two months tomorrow.” Then I would come back for that call to give him a little bit of prep for the call. Not alone. Hadley would be there too, or Condi. Then I would be there during the call and then after the call he would often sort of chat. From my point of view I saw him a lot. Not compared to Rice or Hadley, who saw him hours every day. But I think it would be pretty rare to go for a week without seeing him. What I mean by seeing him, an interchange of some sort, not seeing him in the hallway.\n\nI think that I got a read on him. I was in enough meetings and was with him, I would say, enough times alone, meaning no foreigners and no nonstaff. That is, it is Hadley and me, it’s Condi and me, it’s Josh Bolten and me, where I think he was frank, he had no reason to—I saw him express anger, not often, but a few times at Condi when she was Secretary of State.\n\nMy read on Bush is that he was instinctively a hardliner. That is, he thought, This is the greatest country in the world and the world is a better place the more active, the stronger, the bolder we are. A wonderful neocon view. But he didn’t reach it by classes. I saw him react to a variety of not particularly similar stimuli, but they point in the same direction. Just to give a couple of examples, large and small.\n\nHis reaction to [Ariel] Sharon’s efforts to put down the Intifada in 2001 and ’02 was basically, “Give me a break. What do you think we would do?” When told yes, but there are so many civilian casualties, he said, “How many mud huts do you think we’ve inadvertently bombed in Afghanistan?” He was a tough guy.\n\nYou saw this I think generally in his support for Israel. When General [David] Petraeus wants to go to Damascus, which Petraeus did for two years because he thinks I can talk to [Bashar] al-Assad and I can—I thought this was the craziest thing I’d ever heard and I blocked it to the extent that a Deputy can do this, for a while. “Let’s think about this—” After a while Petraeus got annoyed at being thwarted by some stinking White House staff guy and said, “I’m going.”\n\nI told Hadley, “We have to tell the President.” Hadley said to the President, “Petraeus—” The President said, “What? No four-star general of mine is going to talk to that—” That’s the real Bush, to me. Very much, in a certain sense, the man that some of his enemies caricature, that is a Texan, a tough-minded guy, a guy who believes that force can often be useful, a guy who believes in America.\n\nNow, there are times when things happen that I think don’t fit that picture. I would have liked him to do more in Sudan, for example, and he didn’t. To me one of the great mysteries of the background of today’s Syria problem is why the United States permitted Assad year after year after year to send jihadis into Iraq. You could ask the same question about Iran, which was killing Americans. Why didn’t we do more? The answers are obvious in the sense that whether it was the right policy or wrong, it would have been quite dangerous and difficult to do more against Iran, not Syria. A weak, unimportant military. So I’m not suggesting on every issue he came out on the ferocious side. But I do think that his instincts were pretty hard line. I’ll stick with that.\n\nPerry\n\nBack to Mel’s point. So is what you’re saying that it’s personality, it’s instinct, and substance about the role of the United States in the world?\n\nAbrams\n\nIt is the role of the United States in the world, yes, I think that is sort of a fundamental belief. Then it is experience as President. The George Bush of 2001 could not possibly have done the surge. It requires a sense of knowing—I understand what the generals are saying, they are wrong, I’m right. That takes years.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut talking about Bush now. You come in, you’re the senior person on the staff initially interested and focused on human rights. What would you say is Bush’s attitude initially, as you knew it, in spring, summer? Maybe 9/11 is a divide. I’m not sure. It is initially. About human rights, quote, when you say he is a “hardliner.” Where do notions of freedom fit into this, human rights, values?\n\nI say this because I’ve actually done a huge amount of reading of Bush’s speeches in 2000, 2001, 2002. Obviously somebody else is writing lots of his speeches, but nonetheless, they are very anomalous, they are very paradoxical. When Bush is asked, for example, during one of the Presidential debates, “When you think about foreign policy what is it that you’re most interested in?” Do you know what the answer is?\n\nAbrams\n\nNo.\n\nLeffler\n\n“Interest. Interest will shape what I do in terms of American foreign policy.” That was his instinctive answer, I think, during a debate. But you also then find notions of freedom talked about in his speeches. Not only after 9/11, not only when he is trying to rectify the problems of no WMD [weapons of mass destruction] in Iraq, but notions of freedom do enter the vocabulary.\n\nBut when you also talk to people who knew Bush, like yourself—that’s why I’m interested in your answer, very much interested in it. I don’t really get a sense that when people say, like you do, he was a hardliner, he was a tough guy, that they think that Bush was really thinking a lot about freedom, human rights—\n\nAbrams\n\nThis is very interesting to me also, because who is this guy who gives the second inaugural? I think first he has no foreign policy views to speak of as Governor of Texas and as a Presidential candidate. In the campaign I think he is giving voice to a kind of amalgam of standard Republican lines, what the Vulcans write, his father, and to the extent that you can describe anything, I think you’re describing realpolitik more than anything else. There is—so OK, how do you get from there to the second inaugural, let’s say.\n\nFirst the answer is, I think, Bush. This is not staff work. The answer is not Powell, Condi, something like that. I think Bush—most of the answer is 9/11 in this sense. I think after 9/11 Bush tries to figure out for himself what is this, what has happened here? Why do these people hate us? Why are they attacking us? Why have thousands of Americans been killed? Now there is a ready answer from the State Department. It is ready on 9/12. It is because we support Israel too much. Why do you think that is? Bush rejects that view. That is not his view.\n\nHe doesn’t have a view in September, October, but he moves toward a view that the lack of freedom is a key here. You see this, I think, not in such grandiose terms, but you see it in the April 2002 and more in the June 2002 speeches about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the dumping of [Yasser] Arafat, which to me is a precursor to the later, broader question of the Freedom Agenda in the Middle East.\n\nWhat he says in April but more clearly in June is, “I am for a Palestinian state and you may not have one while that man is there and you do not have a democracy. When you get a democracy, come see me, I’ll give you a state.” That’s very much against what is coming from the State Department. Powell and his people are very unhappy with that speech, the June speech, and think it is a very bad speech, but he does it anyway. That speech goes through something like 30 drafts. I’m not involved with it really. I saw that speech the last day because I’m in the other job, the Democ job at this point, but I’ve talked to [Michael] Gerson about this.\n\nLong\n\nGerson writes that speech, right?\n\nAbrams\n\nGerson says this is with very much Presidential involvement. Not only in the sense that when he is in the Oval alone with the President and the President is saying, “I want to say this, then I want to say that.” But also there is actually a session in the Roosevelt Room or the Cabinet Room, a drafting session with the President there. There are disagreements, particularly in the one that—I think the last session Powell is someplace else and Armitage is there. Armitage is arguing, “We shouldn’t be saying this stuff,” and the President is saying, “I want to say this,” and makes a remark about European anti-Semitism. So you’re already seeing this argument in favor of the importance of freedom and democracy emerge certainly by the first half of 2002.\n\nI think there are other influences later that pull this out further, and [Natan] Sharansky is one of them. I think Sharansky does help him conceptualize this and broaden it and say it is always the answer. You also have—\n\nLeffler\n\nWhat are Condi’s and Hadley’s views of this trajectory?\n\nAbrams\n\nLet me finish my thought and come back to that. You also have in 2002 the Arab Human Development Report from UNDP [United Nations Development Programme], which says, “What is the problem in the Middle East? The freedom deficit.” So it’s in the air. It’s not just the Bush administration. Some people are beginning to point to this. I think Bush ultimately plays a great role, but he is not the only actor in this.\n\nI don’t remember when the Sharansky first meetings are, but this is first. My view is Condi is a facilitator. I don’t think that she is frankly adding much to this intellectually, oddly enough. She is following the President. He wants to go in this direction; we’re going to go in this direction. Being an intellectual herself, she is easily able to do this and to help him achieve this. He is the originator. I believe that if the President had come to a different conclusion, a much more, let’s say, realpolitik, a Powell-like conclusion, she would have helped him do that too. She did not think she was President and she was really loyal to him. She would have argued with him face-to-face at times, but I think particularly now—remember again, she is also new in 2001-’02. She is not the person she was five years later.\n\nSo I think there are facilitators. I am a facilitator in helping think about what does this all mean? But he is at the center of this and he is moving in this direction. He is not being pushed in this direction by his staff.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me pose one question about that, and I’m going to harken back to what you said about your meeting with Jimmy Carter and the question—“We’re all happy to see that you changed after Afghanistan,” and he rejects that characterization. Do you think that the President was a hardliner before 9/11, or was there a change after 9/11 when he becomes a hardliner and in effect there are two administrations?\n\nAbrams\n\nFirst, I only got there Memorial Day. I didn’t see much of the President in June, July, August, September, so I don’t have much personal insight into this. But I basically think he wasn’t much of a foreign policy President prior to 9/11. I think the basic idea is Powell is in charge of foreign policy. That’s certainly Powell’s idea, I think. I think Powell’s failure to adjust after 9/11 just gave him three horrible years, three unsuccessful years as Secretary.\n\nRiley\n\nMaybe inevitable in a post-9/11 environment.\n\nAbrams\n\nThere is some inevitability in this sense. When you have a President who says, “Now I’m taking the reins,” what does a Secretary do? I would say the same thing about Hillary Clinton. My criticisms of her tenure as Secretary of State are all diminished by my view that she had a very narrow track to go on because the President really wanted to be in charge of foreign policy. That was not true, I think, prior to 9/11. I think Powell was the man.\n\nLeffler\n\nTalk about the tensions between the Vice President and his staff and the State Department even during this period of time. In the literature as it now stands there is a lot of emphasis that Vice President [Richard] Cheney, from the moment he became Vice President, part of his mandate was intelligence, national security, energy policy, and he did put together a very well-informed staff of people, certainly people like [I. Lewis] Scooter Libby, Eric Edelman, who were extremely interested in these issues. This is going to be more and more important over the next few years.\n\nYou get to the NSC. Did you start seeing, boy, this is a very, very complicated bureaucracy? Now we not only have a National Security Council staff but we have a Vice Presidential staff, we have the State Department. Tell us how this affected everyday life. When you first get to the NSC talk to us about the interactions.\n\nRiley\n\nI don’t want you to lose track of the question about the President’s own transformation. I’m happy to pick up with the Vice Presidential stuff here, or if you want—\n\nAbrams\n\nLet’s go on with Bush then and let me come to the OVP [Office of the Vice President].\n\nI think the word “transformation” is right. Obviously it is not overnight. I think what happens very quickly after 9/11 is that the President realizes his Presidency has changed. America is under attack and he takes charge. He becomes the center of the national security policy in a way I don’t think he was prior to that.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nAbrams\n\nBut if you had said to him on the 15th of September, “What’s your policy?” I don’t think he could have answered that. I think over time he comes to more and more deeply believe in the Freedom Agenda. As I said, I think you can see part of it in the context of Israeli-Palestinian affairs. I think you see it in the context of Afghanistan. We want them to have an election. We want them to have a democracy. Human rights is important, the role of women, the freeing of Afghan women. It broadens out, partly because as he thinks it through he likes it. People come to see him.\n\nOne of the things about Bush that I think is interesting—and you see this even in the speech he made this week—I’ve always felt the people whom he was closest to, the foreign leaders, that is, that he was closest to, were people he thought were trying to get things done. They were in a certain limited sense heroic figures: Tony Blair, John Howard, [Junichiro] Koizumi, Sharon, not people like [Jacques] Chirac and [Gerhard] Schroeder, whom he thought were just pols. People matter and people have choices to make and some make heroic choices. So you meet these people and Jesus, you meet the Dalai Lama and you meet Sharansky, all those years in prison and you meet Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and how can you not be deeply impressed?\n\nNow, this is another subject, but we should segue later to Christianity because this matters also. He has a view of the world and the role of individuals and the choices individuals can make. I think it all comes together for him, certainly by the time of the second inaugural, obviously, but before then democracy and human rights were playing a big role.\n\nHe is the man he is. He is not an ideologue. So in the sense he can give the second inaugural but he can then meet with the King of Saudi Arabia. He doesn’t say to the King, “I have to give you a freedom lecture.” He is always pragmatic at the same time. I think this moves from becoming a reaction, a view, to a kind of coherent theory of American foreign policy as we move through the administration, and we should come back to this. The problem that happens later is as he’s moving into this, OK, this is being developed. He is developing it in his own mind. Condi and Steve are helping both develop it and implement it and so are we on the NSC staff, OVP staff. We’re not getting any help from the State Department, but it doesn’t matter. The impact of that is OK, so they lose power, we gain power. Foreign policy begins to move toward the White House.\n\nThe problem is in the second term because Condi moves from being implementer, in my view, to being something else. OVP, let me just turn to that.\n\nI get to the White House and what is obvious is that there are in this administration as within Reagan’s all sorts of different views. Particularly now in June, let’s say. I’m new there. It takes me at least 10 or 15 minutes to recognize the State Department is the enemy. [laughter] Who is on your side? Condi, Steve, some other people in the NSC. For example, on human rights issues in Europe, Dan Fried, the Senior Director for Europe, career Foreign Service officer who was ambassador to Poland, is fabulous, amazing, both as a pragmatic Foreign Service officer and as an intellectual. He becomes a friend and ally. And OVP.\n\nI don’t know if I’d met Eric Edelman. I doubt it. I’m not sure. Scooter Libby I had met and we were quite friendly. But the whole staff there in my view then and now, was first-rate, and kind of a neocon staff, which I say because Cheney is no neocon. Cheney is a Republican conservative. On these issues he is thought of as being more of a realpolitik guy. When it comes to human rights policy I think that’s right. It’s just not an interest of his.\n\nLeffler\n\nHe is not.\n\nAbrams\n\nHe’s not interested in it; he’s not against it. He never speaks against it. Where I think people get him wrong is I think most people’s assumption, given his Halliburton period and the business they do in the Middle East, everybody assumes he is going to be pro-Arab, not pro-Israel. This is completely wrong, partly because they don’t remember the Dick Cheney I remember, who is the number two Republican in the House whom I knew during Central America days as being a real tough supporter of the Contras and of President Reagan but also pro-Israel. So I’m not really surprised by this.\n\nIt’s interesting that Cheney does not hire a Kissingerian-Scowcroftian staff. He hires basically a neocon staff.\n\nLong\n\nDid you know David Addington?\n\nAbrams\n\nI believe I knew Addington prior to that. Addington is not in this category.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nAbrams\n\nAnd does have a foreign policy influence as time goes by. They become, first of all friends, particularly professional friends. That is, we plot and scheme together in the White House. It is sort of what do we think about X, what are we going to do about X? Well, the State Department is a problem; how do we get around this problem.\n\nLeffler\n\nWould you say they’re scheming? Does that scheming include Condi and Hadley?\n\nAbrams\n\nSometimes, usually. The difference is that, this is a difference I think of form rather than of content. So my answer is yes, but. We have a problem with the State Department. What you can say to Condi and Steve is, “I just think they’re resisting. I think they’re not really on board with this.” What you can say to the colleagues in OVP is, “You see what Powell is doing? He’s disloyal to the President.” You cannot say to Condi, “Powell is disloyal to the President.” You cannot deprecate Powell to Condi because they’re friends; to Steve because, at least to this point, Steve is Steve. Steve is a great gentleman and he doesn’t want to hear that kind of talk. So the tone changes, but the content—and Condi is aware.\n\nRiley\n\nWould you say that this is true before 9/11?\n\nAbrams\n\nNo.\n\nRiley\n\nYou say it took you 15 minutes to figure out that the State Department was the enemy.\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t know. It’s hard for me to remember what human rights issues arose and I was not aware of a lot of stuff arising. For instance, there is a confrontation with the Saudis in August I think it is of 2001 that I now know about only because I’ve been told about it. But at the time, it’s completely over my head. And I think that as time goes by, particularly in 2002, it is clear to Condi and Steve that look, the President wants to do certain things that Powell doesn’t agree with. The Department thinks, Powell thinks, they’re wrong. So we argue about them.\n\nI think over time what happens is they’re in charge of foreign policy largely. It begins to move to the White House, so we have arguments. That’s the sort of middle stage. For example, the drafting of the June 2002 speech on Israeli-Palestinian matters. But the process continues to the point where we make foreign policy. So, for example, in June 2003 the President goes to Sharm el-Sheikh and Aqaba for two summits, what we call the Red Sea Summits.\n\nIt is all Condi. Condi arranges them. Now of course the White House is always more or less in charge when the President is traveling, so we do all the arrangements. But it’s not just the arrangements. The idea is Condi’s and the implementation is Condi’s. How do we get this done? Condi calls in Bandar [bin Sultan] and says, “The King has to go to this.” The State Department is completely peripheral.\n\nBy June 2003 I think she is in charge. Powell is an unhappy official. I’ve talked to Powell in the last few years about some of this. There is still a great deal of bitterness on his part that the NSC and the office of the Vice President—at one point in one of these interviews he said to me, “I would be sent to the Middle East and before we were wheels up you guys were all stabbing me in the back.” There is an element of truth to that in the sense that we, at this point if we’re talking 2003, I’m now doing Middle East, we, in my shop and OVP, do not trust him to carry out the President’s instructions fully because he doesn’t agree with those instructions. Even if he is trying to carry them out, it’s not clear that you’ll do a perfect job if you don’t really believe in the policy.\n\nPerry\n\nWhat did you say to him in the interview when he expressed his view about what happened when he was on the plane?\n\nAbrams\n\nWhat he said was, “The White House is stabbing me in the back, and if it is 2003 that probably includes you.” [laughter] He said it very nicely.\n\nRiley\n\nI’m looking at the timeline from the administration and it indicates that President Bush meets with [Vladimir] Putin in June of 2001. Were you around? I guess it would have been after Memorial Day. It would have been very shortly after you came in. I can’t remember if that’s the—“I looked into his soul—”\n\nAbrams\n\nWe have a problem. I can’t tell you when it appears, but it’s clear over, let’s say, the first term. There are two schools in the NSC and they can be represented by people. There is Dan Fried and me and there’s Tom Graham. Tom Graham is very much a Scowcroftian-Kissingerian. He is the Senior Director for Russia, theoretically under Fried, but not really. So there is Graham, who is pushing what actually is the policy at that time, and there is Dan and me wringing our hands.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nAbrams\n\nHere I think we’re getting no help from Condi. At this point Condi is the old Condi of the Scowcroft NSC. But to be fair to Condi, again, Condi is as NSA [National Security Agency] never more than an inch away from the President. This is the President’s view at this point. He changes later, but at this point she is where he is. So Dan and I, who worry a lot that we’re not saying much about human rights in Russia and so forth, we wring our hands more as time goes by, but we’re not able to do much about it.\n\nLong\n\nWas there much support from other people around the President for that viewpoint? If Rice wasn’t really taking the lead yet at that point and she was echoing what the President thought about Putin, where was that coming from? It certainly couldn’t have been just his impression from meeting him. Were there other voices saying things are going in the right direction, it’s not all so bad? Or was it really—?\n\nAbrams\n\nI really don’t know in the administration. I don’t know his relationship with Cheney and what Cheney was saying about this. I said before that the President liked people who he thought were trying to do something. I think at the beginning Putin got some of the benefit of that doubt. He looked like a guy who was trying to do something. But there is one other thing to say about this.\n\nForeign leaders are mostly politicians. It’s really different, when I’m with the Secretary of State, say, or National Security Advisor Rice or Hadley, and we’re meeting with these foreign ministers, many of whom are not politicians. There is this politician-to-politician thing, and Putin gets a little bit of that because, as you know, he is not exactly a politician but he is not a career diplomat either. He is a career spy. He becomes a political leader and at least for the first year he is pretty successful at it.\n\nI think there is a sense for the President when he meets with these other people—I was either physically present or on the phone with him talking to real politicians, [Angela] Merkel, Blair, and politics is a constant part of this. Understanding that you have your political system and problems, I have mine, and talking about it, asking about it. Tell me about this. Are you going to be able to do X? Explain it to me. Then I explain to you my situation and my Congress. I think that is important for Bush. I think personal relations are quite important for him with other foreign leaders in a way it was not true really for Reagan as much or, I would say, [Barack] Obama.\n\nI think Putin gets a little bit of the benefit of the doubt early on. There are some conversations with Putin that I was—I happened to be in the Oval because I guess we were—sometimes because I’m the next call. So you get there and you just stand there. They did have what sounded like a personal relationship. I can remember the President saying sometimes, “You know, I think my daughter is going to get engaged pretty soon.” Putin says, “Do you like the guy?” The President says, “I don’t know if I should answer that. You know, Vladimir, there are a hundred people listening to this call.” [laughter] So there is a personal relationship.\n\nRiley\n\nWhy don’t I give you a break. Take five minutes and we’ll come back for the rest of the morning.\n\n[BREAK]\n\nRiley\n\nMel, you want to get us started here?\n\nLeffler\n\nSure. One of the things that might be useful would be, when you joined the staff, just to go back and create a baseline, what did you expect to be your two or three major issues? When you were hired you probably met with Hadley, maybe with Rice. What did you talk about that you would really be focused on initially? Obviously this is going to evolve a lot, but create a benchmark for us.\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t have much of a memory of it. I did have I guess a long phone call with Steve and then came in to see Condi. I knew on paper basically it’s human rights policy, it’s UN. Somebody had to cover the UN. There was an AID [Agency for International Development] person always at the—we inherited this pattern at the NSC. I was also the person at the NSC who looked at AID. We had somebody—and cats and dogs, Cuban migration issues, which meant liaison with the Coast Guard.\n\nRiley\n\nWhich you hoped would be quiet.\n\nAbrams\n\nWe didn’t get another Mariel, anyway. But in terms of what I would actually be doing, I don’t think it was very clear. From my point of view I was at the White House. I had a terrific title, Special Assistant to the President.\n\nLeffler\n\nYou did have a great title.\n\nAbrams\n\n—forget the rest, Special Assistant to the President. I did eight years at State, so now I have the NSC itself, enormously prestigious.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo what did you focus on? You didn’t have a clear agenda initially, but pre 9/11 were there issues that you recall that you actually focused on?\n\nAbrams\n\nOne I remember only because it was my first time in the Oval Office in 15 years or something. Immigration policy. You remember pre-9/11 there was talk of a big Bush initiative. He had met with Vicente Fox, and so this was one thing that I thought about and looked at all the papers and tried to make a contribution to papers going to Condi and Steve.\n\nThe UN. We instituted, or not, maybe it had always existed, but we had a daily phone call as I recall at eight o’clock in the morning. It was the Assistant Secretary for IO, the UN Ambassador or Deputy Ambassador, me, my Director for UN Affairs, so that I was getting—as the weeks went by, really au courant with what was going on at USUN [U.S. Mission to the United Nations] so that I could tell Condi and Steve. Later it became more important because we didn’t trust the State Department. So we wanted to make sure, for example, do we know a veto is coming? Are we clear there is going to be a veto? Are they clear there is going to be a veto? Clearing speeches. Who is the UN Ambassador in the first year?\n\nRiley\n\nI should know.\n\nAbrams\n\nIt’s not Bolton.\n\nRiley\n\nI’ll look it up.\n\nAbrams\n\nIs it [John] Negroponte, or does he come later too?\n\nRiley\n\nI believe it is Negroponte.\n\nAbrams\n\nRight from the start?\n\nLeffler\n\nI think so too.\n\nAbrams\n\nThis becomes significant because for example, let’s go back to your OVP question. Later, in 2002 I guess, or maybe later even, we are negotiating at the UN. This must be in the context of Iraq, so it’s probably 2003 or ’04. We are negotiating UN resolutions. There are a lot of people in the White House, particularly—is it Negroponte?\n\nRiley\n\nI’m still—\n\nAbrams\n\nThere is a lot of distrust already, deep distrust of Powell. So this is in the context of Iraq, and the distrust is coming from OVP and DoD [Department of Defense]. What are we going to do about this? He is still Secretary of State. The answer is we’re going to send Abrams up to New York for days at a time to shadow Negroponte.\n\nRiley\n\n[James] Cunningham was active—\n\nAbrams\n\nCunningham is Deputy.\n\nRiley\n\nThen Negroponte in 2001.\n\nAbrams\n\nOK, I knew John. I had in a certain sense been John’s boss when he was Ambassador to Honduras. It worked in the sense that I went up there and he said, “I know why you’re here.” I said, “We all know why I’m here. It’s not you and me, it’s those guys in Washington.” I went to meetings with him where I could report back to Libby and Wolfowitz. It’s OK. The country is not being completely sold out. That was one of the things I actually did.\n\nLeffler\n\nThis was during those critical debates in the fall of 2002 at the UN? You were there?\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t remember.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat’s really critical. This is after Bush gives his UN—?\n\nAbrams\n\nNo, this is not when Powell gives the famous speech that he now so regrets.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut is it before then, because Bush gives his critical UN speech when he says, “We’re going to go through the UN,” which is to follow Powell’s advice.\n\nAbrams\n\nRight.\n\nLeffler\n\nPowell tells Bush, let’s take the issue—\n\nAbrams\n\nWhen is that?\n\nLeffler\n\nPowell talks to him August 6, 2002, and then Bush goes and gives his big speech at the UN in late August, maybe early September.\n\nAbrams\n\nIn my memory this is 2002.\n\nLeffler\n\nYes, that would be exactly right.\n\nAbrams\n\nFall of 2002, I think.\n\nLeffler\n\nThat’s a very—\n\nAbrams\n\nWe’re negotiating resolutions.\n\nLeffler\n\nAnd that is a very critical time when the folks in the Vice President’s office are extremely distrustful of what is going on.\n\nAbrams\n\nAnd so is DoD.\n\nLeffler\n\nYes, absolutely.\n\nAbrams\n\nBasically I don’t think I’m doing much in the sense that I’m merely reporting back to them it looks pretty much OK to me, but that’s because first of all, John and I trusted each other so we didn’t have any secrets from each other. He is trying to be both loyal to the President and loyal to Powell and the way to do that I think is to be candid, which he was. So the only thing I remember—my most vivid memory is of a negotiating session with the Chinese Mission to the UN when I received a cell phone call from Paul Wolfowitz who said, “Can you talk?”\n\nI said, “I am on a cell phone in the Chinese Mission to the UN. I don’t think these are the best circumstances for this conversation.” [laughter] So I did that.\n\nOne of the things I did is, I actually, then, we’re talking 2001, 2002, I could get along with everybody and that was very useful to Condi and Steve. I knew the State Department; I knew a lot of people in the State Department. I knew Powell, I knew Armitage, and I could call Rich, which a lot of people at my rank could not do. I got along with everybody then. It got more strained later. I knew how the Department worked. I knew how to get things done at the Department. The DoD people trusted me, OVP trusted me. So that was one of the things I was doing for Condi.\n\nRiley\n\nNow DoD, Wolfowitz, or was there anybody else?\n\nAbrams\n\nWell, I don’t—yes, there was [Douglas] Feith. I knew Doug from Jackson days, so we trusted each other. I didn’t really know [Donald] Rumsfeld. I don’t even know if I had met Rumsfeld. But certainly Wolfowitz, Feith, some others working—\n\nLeffler\n\nCan you take a few minutes during these early months after you get there to talk to us, just literally, about a day at the NSC? How did the NSC operate? This is something that’s a void in the literature. Could you just walk us through a typical day at the NSC? Did you start with a staff meeting at 8:30? Who did you meet with? Condi? Steve?\n\nAbrams\n\nI am constantly telling students the first part of this to shock them. I would get up every day at 4:30 and I would be at my desk at 6:00. Why? Because the President got to his desk about 6:55 or 7:00. He wasn’t going to call me. In fact, I remember the time he did call me and I said to him, “I’m so glad you called because now I can tell people the President called me.” But Condi or Steve who went down to the Oval might. You cannot be in a position in which they said to you, “Could you believe that New York Times editorial?” and you hadn’t seen it. Or said to you, “I don’t understand what just happened in Yemen” and you would say, “What? What?” So I really needed that hour to look at the incoming, let’s say.\n\nThings would quiet down. My staff would arrive usually at about 8:00 and I think I would say the Director levels at the NSC would arrive at about 8:00, Senior Directors more likely at 7:30 or 7:00.\n\nLeffler\n\nWhen did Steve and Condi get there?\n\nAbrams\n\nSix.\n\nLeffler\n\nThey got there the same time.\n\nAbrams\n\nYes—they might call or you could call them or email them. Condi and Steve didn’t do email, but you would email their assistants. Condi made a decision at the beginning: First of all I don’t want a record, and secondly I don’t want to be snowed under. Each of them had one executive assistant. So you would email them and say, “Show this to Steve immediately.”\n\nSeven to eight was quiet because they would be likely to be in with the President.\n\nRiley\n\nWhere was your office?\n\nAbrams\n\nThe whole time in the Eisenhower building. I moved three different offices with the three different jobs but always on the third floor of the EEOB [Eisenhower Executive Office Building], which is where the whole NSC was then. This was before the reconstruction started.\n\nEight o’clock is the staff meeting with Condi, which would go from 8:00-8:30 every day for Senior Directors plus. At a certain point we started inviting—I don’t remember how early—Scooter was invited, or Eric. Maybe it was Eric who would come. Robin Cleveland from OMB [Office of Management and Budget], but basically it was the Senior Directors with Condi in the old Sit Room conference room. We would go around the room. She would not usually start by saying anything. It was show and tell, literally.\n\nRiley\n\nHow big a group would that be?\n\nAbrams\n\nHow big a group? Say, 20. That’s probably good, 15, 20. This is a very useful moment for us. First of all, it meant you got Condi every day. Second, it meant that you got all your peers. So the walk over and the walk back from the EEOB is quite useful to grab somebody and say, “Look,” particularly if you’re me and you’re at Democ. I had started in a functional post and then moved to a geographic one. When you’re in one of these functional posts, the lifeblood is the regional guys, so you have to grab them and ask them and pressure them and cajole them.\n\nThis is your chance to say to Condi, “Powell is going to the UN tomorrow,” or, “We’re moving toward a vote on Israel, an effort to get a compromise next week, could be a veto.” Or whatever. “Mubarak just threw somebody in jail,” or nothing. The rest of the day—\n\nLeffler\n\nDid she ever tell you at these meetings what was on her mind? What she most wanted?\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, she would respond. So you got to see—she would say substantive and significant things. One of them, by the way, I remember very well, because remember I get there in May—I guess I got there May 1st or something like that.\n\nShe said to us in early June, “Everybody here has been working a crushing schedule since January 20th and you are to take two weeks’ vacation. You are not to take one week’s vacation; you are to take two weeks’ vacation. You are to email to Liz,” Liz [Laura E.] Lineberry, her secretary, “the dates of your two weeks’ vacation. If you do not do that, you will hear from us. You need it, your family needs it, and to do what you need to do for the President—”\n\nI hadn’t had two weeks’ vacation in 15 years. Fantastic. Condi as the personnel manager is very impressive. But she would say substantive things. She would say, “The President would not want this. The President won’t accept that. I want you to do this.” She would react substantively on foreign policy issues. You then go back to your office and do your work. The work—we were on the Internet so we had normal email. We had, at some point, and I don’t remember when, the interagency system, which later becomes the basis for WikiLeaks, but it is a big change for me coming from the Reagan State Department because in those days the only form of communication is cables. Now I am able to email first of all people at State, but also embassies, which of course presents a challenge because you’re not supposed to be giving instructions. You had to be really careful.\n\nLeffler\n\nDid you email embassies?\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, always copying the Assistant Secretary so that what I would say in this email is, “I think it is really important that—” say, in Tunisia—“we make it clear that these arrests are terrible,” and by copying, let’s say, David Welch I’m hoping that he will instruct you to do that. That sort of thing. So I cannot be accused of—you know.\n\nThere is a third email loop, which is the internal NSC loop. The unclassified Internet loop, the—I can’t think of the name of the system for the one throughout the government—that’s secret. The NSC line is top secret. That is NSC only. Later, I think—we can actually reach CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] on that line. It is CIA, NSC. That is internal only.\n\nRiley\n\nOK.\n\nPerry\n\nSo what is the flow of information coming to you? How are you getting your information, and from whom?\n\nAbrams\n\nFirst you’re getting the unclassified stuff. So you’re getting newspapers and articles, that sort of thing, including emails that have information on them because they have, “You need to see this from the Financial Times. Make sure you don’t miss it.” Or from people in your world just sending you stuff. Through this interagency loop you’re getting State Department cables, and this is very important. Theoretically, we’re getting all the relevant cables, including the EX-DIS and NO-DIS cables. The cables we’re not getting are theoretically the ones that say, “For the Secretary’s eyes only.” We’re not getting those.\n\nBut following the cable traffic is very important. Theoretically, I’m seeing what the Assistant Secretary of State for IO, Near East, or whatever is relevant. Theoretically I’m seeing in the Democ job anything involving human rights. This is a big cable take that I try to read through. In the Democ job it’s easier because it is your job. It’s not like the geographic job. So you’re getting cables, you’re getting CIA reports.\n\nAt some point, and again I don’t remember quite when it goes mostly to email, you’re also getting NSA reports on the screen. Many of them are coming in this top-secret loop. Some of them were sensitive ones. The NSA guy will walk in to you, hand it to you, watch you read it, and take it back. But you’re getting most of the information on the screen. CIA is still doing a 20-page report on “Whither Saudi Arabia.” Nobody has time to read those except over the weekend. People come in—I’d say Hadley and Condi basically work 9:00 to 5:00 on Saturdays. I don’t. I come in Sunday mornings, kind of 8:00 to 12:00 to do that kind of reading, to catch up.\n\nSo you’re getting all the intel [intelligence] and you’re getting the State Department cables all day long and reading those. You have meetings. In the first job if the Secretary General is coming down or the Under Secretary General for Political Affairs is coming down, or Terje Rød-Larsen, the Envoy for the Middle East, so we see those people. Of course, in the regional office you’re seeing lots of foreign diplomats. You’re seeing people visiting from capitals and you’re seeing people from the embassies all the time, every day. You’re going to interagency meetings a lot. There’s a lot of time in the Situation Room, endless deputies’ meetings. This is a criticism of Hadley that I think is probably reasonable.\n\nLeffler\n\nYou’re the number two person at these deputies’ meetings. You sit behind Hadley, essentially?\n\nAbrams\n\nRight.\n\nLeffler\n\nHadley is representing—\n\nAbrams\n\nIt changes in the second term because then I’m a deputy so I get to sit at the table. In the first term I’m in the back row. There are eight seats at the table. So you would have, let’s say, the big deputies are at the table. Hadley is chairing; Armitage, Wolfowitz, whoever is representing CIA and JCS [Joint Chiefs of Staff], and then there is a back row with probably a dozen chairs more where I’m sitting and other special assistants, Dan Fried, are sitting at these deputies’ meetings. These meetings go on too long. Hadley is not a sufficient disciplinarian. They start late. We have a backup, where you go to the Sit Room for your 11:30 meeting and there are 30 people standing outside because the meeting that was supposed to end at 11:00 is still going on, never mind the one that was supposed to end at 11:30, which annoys a lot of people because time is so scarce. “Why am I standing here waiting?”\n\nPerry\n\nYou started to say that Hadley had been criticized. Was that your point? You were cut off.\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, and it was a fair criticism I think of him and one that I think he would probably agree with.\n\nPerry\n\nSo he was not on the President’s time schedule, meetings start and end on time.\n\nAbrams\n\nNo, and it’s a big problem for people who—you get people like Wolfowitz and Armitage saying, “I have to stand around here?” if they’re not at the meeting that is taking place. So hours are spent over in the White House.\n\nRiley\n\nAnd it had to take place in the Sit Room because of the classified nature—?\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, later we had a few more SCIFs [Special Compartmented Intel Facility]. We had a couple in the EEOB and the technology gets better so you were able to do classified video. So that’s what you were doing in the course of the day. A problem is you have so many meetings—the classic problem is I get back to the office, it’s 5:10 and I have 180 emails to maybe look through. So lots of meetings in your own office with the guys from the French embassy who want to come in, the guys from this embassy, that embassy. The interagency meetings, I would say three hours a day, then time at the screen.\n\nI commented to my wife once that I was sitting there and thinking, OK, it’s 7:20 and I’m in good shape here. I’m thinking, What does that mean? It means I have gone through the emails. That’s what I have accomplished today. I am up-to-date on my emails. Wow.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo you don’t have much time to really think about substantive policy. You’re not spending a lot of time writing memos on key issues during these first few months?\n\nAbrams\n\nI would say there is a policy debate at some of these meetings, some. Both at the—at all levels, NSC, PC [Principals Committee], DC [Deputies Committee], PCC [Policy Coordinating Committee]. We do sometimes have worthless meetings, but sometimes you actually engage. One thing we should probably go back to later—I think one of my real criticisms of the way the Bush administration was organized by Condi and by Steve, and I suspect therefore the fault is the President’s, is the effort to homogenize opinion rather than present him with choices.\n\nI do write a lot of memos to Condi and Steve. I do that sitting in my office at the computer writing a memo in which I make an argument, particularly in the second term, where I’m arguing really against much of the Middle East policy Condi is conducting. I’m writing memos to Steve that say, “We’re making a mistake here. We’re doing something wrong here. It’s not what we should be doing.”\n\nOr, I’m redrafting—this is probably not drafting. You produce a lot of paper for all of the Condi or Steve meetings later and the President’s meetings. That is, the meetings that I mentioned before when I’m in the Oval Office, including for phone calls. There is paper that goes to the President prior to those. It goes the night before so you get it to the National Security Advisor I guess the day before your meeting with or talking to the King of Jordan tomorrow. Agenda, key issues, talking points. The President was diligent in going over this material so that I would sometimes come to the pre-brief for this meeting, let’s say at 9:45 for a 10 o’clock meeting and the President would say, “I didn’t agree with what you proposed and I’m not going to say that.” He really read this stuff.\n\nLeffler\n\nTell us during these first few months’ substantive questions at the NSC, at these meetings, how much focus was there on terrorism?\n\nAbrams\n\nIn these months I don’t think I was at an NSC meeting, meaning one that the President presided at prior to 9/11.\n\nLeffler\n\nWithin your staff meetings does terrorism come up much?\n\nAbrams\n\nNot for me.\n\nLeffler\n\n[Richard] Clarke is at these meetings.\n\nAbrams\n\nAt the staff meetings?\n\nLeffler\n\nYes.\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, but prior to 9/11 the only thing I know about Clarke is that he is extremely unpleasant and odd, which is rare. The tone comes from the President and Condi and it is a tone of great courtesy and esprit de corps. It’s the kind of White House where if it were found out that you had stabbed somebody in the back, you would get fired. People were fired. Condi fires the Senior Director for Asia for having an affair with his secretary. This is a very genteel NSC. Bob Blackwill was fired by the President later, actually, for laying hands on an employee. So everybody is very nice to everybody. That is something that hits you early on. How courteous.\n\nCondi says, “We’re in these jobs 12, 15 hours a day, we’ve really got to be good to each other.” In Condi and Steve you have two of the finest people you’re ever going to meet and the President is like that too. So to find somebody who is really off-putting, doesn’t know what chitchat means, is odd, and that was all I knew about this guy Clarke.\n\nRiley\n\nIf I could press on that, do you think that it may have been the case that because the messenger himself was a bit off-putting that his message may have been treated with less respect?\n\nAbrams\n\nIt’s conceivable. I have no evidence to support that. It’s a theory that deserves to be examined. If you were—\n\nLeffler\n\nExcept the other great exponent of the terrorist threat was a person with a totally different personality, and that is George Tenet—\n\nAbrams\n\nYes.\n\nLeffler\n\nWho was everybody’s good friend and chum.\n\nAbrams\n\nAs you know, this all matters because you see this later with [Dov] Dubi Weissglass in the context of Israel policy. It matters whether the principal, generally Condi, looks forward to meeting this person or says, “God, keep him off my schedule. You talk to him.” It matters. It matters in terms of face time and it matters in terms of getting things done. So it is a theory that deserves to be at least thought about.\n\nRiley\n\nLet me pose a similar question to Mel’s about Iraq. Is Iraq on the radar?\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t think so. Again, what is pre-9/11? I’m counting my two-week vacation. Condi took time off; Steve took time off.\n\nPerry\n\nBy the way, was this in August while the President was at the ranch?\n\nAbrams\n\nProbably.\n\nLeffler\n\nHe was. He goes away for about—\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, that’s probably when—\n\nPerry\n\nSo everyone was taking vacations.\n\nAbrams\n\nIn July and August, right. It’s really hard for me to recall. In my world, in thinking of the UN or—yes, what we know about—there are a bunch of countries that are just really horrendous. Iraq. From a human rights point of view there is Iraq, there is North Korea. Those are really at the top of the list. There are a few like that: Iran, Burma. But they’re not—we know also that we are in a confrontation with Iraq, no-fly zones and so forth. It’s not really my business though.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut your business might have engaged the Taliban and Afghanistan during these first months. Did it?\n\nAbrams\n\nI’m sure as you look you’ll find—\n\nLeffler\n\nBut it wasn’t a focal point?\n\nAbrams\n\nIt wasn’t a focal point and I would also say there are easy ones and there are hard ones. The Taliban, like Iraq, they’re evil.\n\nLeffler\n\nCan’t do anything about?\n\nAbrams\n\nNo, simple. What I meant by that is that there is no bureaucratic pushback.\n\nLeffler\n\nI see, right.\n\nAbrams\n\nIn my previous work on the Commission on International Religious Freedom, I had actually been to Saudi Arabia in January of 2001. This is a problem for any administration. But the Taliban, Afghanistan—they’re not a problem, they’re awful. You want to put out a statement, put out a statement. Who is going to say, “Don’t put out a statement”? You want to condemn what happened yesterday? Condemn. This is easy.\n\nLeffler\n\nTell us what it was like on 9/11 or 9/12.\n\nAbrams\n\nOn 9/11, I have a very strong memory. As I said we have eight o’clock staff meetings. I am Senior Director for Democ. As I’m leaving the office, third floor of the EEOB, the Director for UN Affairs, Tony Banbury, points in the—as you walk in you’re in the secretary’s area, waiting room. They had a six-inch TV. Tony Banbury points to it and says, “Look at that. A plane crashed into the World Trade Center.” My immediate thought was, This has happened before. It happened at the Empire State Building. But it’s a big plane. It’s a commercial plane. It is bizarre.\n\nAnyway, so we go off to the staff meeting. It starts normally. At some point five minutes in, ten minutes in, one of the Sit Room staff comes in and hands a note to Condi. It’s a folded note like this only larger. This happened all the time—“The President wants to see you right now,” or “Blair is calling the President. He’s going to take the call. You’d better go up.” I told her this story later; she had forgotten it completely. She opens the note, looks at it—remember now, this is the most courteous person who was ever born. Closes the note, looks up and says, “You are dismissed” and gets up and walks into the Sit Room.\n\nSo all of us were—“What the hell was that? You are dismissed?” So anyway we walk back. I walk back to the office and the second plane has hit. As I get to the office, as I remember it, almost simultaneously, the staff says, “Look at this.” At that point, somehow, and I don’t remember if it is an alarm system or not—I think we had an alarm system already. We were told to vacate. Uniformed Secret Service officers are going through the building. In addition, I believe we must have had a fire alarm system. “Get out.” We immediately realize—it’s obvious that somebody thinks the White House is going to be a target. I don’t think we knew about the other plane. I don’t even think we knew about the Pentagon.\n\nAnyway, what I remember is we’re thinking about New York—I don’t think any of us thought seriously about an attack on the White House, at least I didn’t at this point. You know the way you are in a fire drill. This is a pain, but it’s interesting what is going on in New York. That’s horrendous. We get down to West Executive, separating the White House and the EEOB and the uniformed Secret Service guys are there. You notice that people are running up West Executive toward Pennsylvania and the uniformed Secret Service guys as we come out of the EEOB are saying to us, “Run, run, get out of here, run.” So now this is a very serious thing because you have to assume they know what they are talking about.\n\nMy secretary then, who was like most people seconded from elsewhere, was a CIA secretary. She never got over that. She very soon thereafter asked to be transferred back. Why she thought Langley was not a target is a different question, but she never got over that experience. So we ran and got out of the White House grounds and were told to keep moving, go beyond Lafayette Park.\n\nPerry\n\nWhere did you run?\n\nAbrams\n\nActually, I stood around for a while, realized that they weren’t going to let us back in in five minutes as in a fire drill. I went to the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which was on 15th Street, and sat there looking at TV for a while. We got messages—how did we do that, I don’t know—saying go home at a certain point in the day.\n\nLeffler\n\nWere you thinking this is al-Qaeda?\n\nAbrams\n\nI had never heard of al-Qaeda, I don’t think. I don’t recall.\n\nLeffler\n\nHad al-Qaeda come up much at your staff meetings?\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t remember.\n\nLeffler\n\nSo during these hours—I don’t mean it in a derogatory way, but you’re clueless. You have no idea.\n\nAbrams\n\nRight, who is behind this. My belief is that Dick Clarke was not a collegial type. He was the kind of person who would not say what he had to say at the morning staff meeting. This was for Condi only, not for you palookas. So I don’t believe he talked about this kind of stuff at staff meetings, probably rightly. The staff was told at a certain point, like five o’clock, “Go home,” which I did by Metro.\n\nRiley\n\nYour residence is where?\n\nAbrams\n\nVirginia. I believe we came back to work the next day. The perimeter around the White House had been widened from whatever it is, 18 acres, to several streets up Pennsylvania Avenue. I was parking at 1700 Pennsylvania. It’s a commercial office building and the NSC takes about 50 spaces. As I remember I couldn’t get to it. For several weeks it was very hard. You had to keep showing your pass five different times to get close to the White House. Of course security was great. But we did get back to work pretty quickly.\n\nLater, because of 9/11, the NSC established an alternate site beyond that expanded perimeter so when we had some drills you knew where to go 10 or 20 blocks away in case it happened again.\n\nRiley\n\nElliott, had you ever been involved in the continuity of government exercises that were—\n\nAbrams\n\nNo, as it happened—is that right? Maybe once. I don’t think I was involved while I was at the NSC, which was good for my marriage because my wife’s view of the idea that she and the children were expendable in case of emergency—she didn’t think that was great judgment.\n\nRiley\n\nThere had been exercises prior to the Bush Presidency. Cheney and others had been involved. Had you taken part in those things?\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t recall going to the mountain.\n\nLeffler\n\nCan you recall your first meetings with Condi after 9/11, what they were like? Did she meet with the whole staff on 9/12 or 9/13?\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t recall an all-staff meeting. Obviously we did resume the morning staff meetings. I don’t recall a bureaucratic difference in the way work was being done.\n\nRiley\n\nWhat about your portfolio?\n\nAbrams\n\nExcept—the great change was—soon after, I don’t know if I’m talking about days or a week, but soon after it was obvious we were going to invade Afghanistan to punish these people. I don’t remember when it was publicly obvious. It was clear to me this was going to happen and it was just a matter of time. The reason I mentioned the AID thing before is that I actually had a job here.\n\nI believe this was said to me by the President, although I also heard it from Condi; we were going to invade Afghanistan and we were going to overthrow its government. We were going to be in a “you break it, you bought it” situation. The President said there cannot be a famine in Afghanistan. Robin Cleveland and I were given this job in the wonderful bureaucracy; we were tasked. I had on my little staff somebody from AID, Jonathan [Dworken], who was from OFDA [Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance], the disaster assistance, that was the best part of AID. He became critical in this.\n\nWe worked to develop a plan to make sure there was adequate food, which was not easy because Afghanistan at that point really was on the verge of famine, and like all famines, government caused, really. Getting food there was going to be difficult. The heroes here are really the World Food Programme people who devised different routes, the rail route down from the Baltic, the route up from Pakistan. We worked on this with them successfully. There was no famine.\n\nWe didn’t, as I recall it, have a larger assignment, that is, at that point the President and Condi were not saying, “Develop a plan for the health system and the educational system” and everything else. My memory is that it was really focused on famine. Ultimately, this is before the invasion. Steve asked me to brief the President on all of that, which I did. I brought Jonathan with me. We briefed him on what was being done to avoid a famine essentially by the World Food Programme, how this is being organized. Where is the food? Where is it coming from? How are we getting it there?\n\nThe only other thing I remember about that is the supply from the north was actually critical. For whatever operational reasons, it was turning out to be quite difficult to get it to the south by ship. Therefore I remember saying to people—I would not be involved operationally in a war anywhere, but I do remember saying to Steve and Condi, “The failure to take Mazar-i-Sharif is going to screw up our plans. You’ve got to take Mazar-i-Sharif. That is the rail transit point. Everything is coming down through there. So I don’t know, I’m not a soldier, but I’m telling you this is critical from the food point of view. You just need to know that.”\n\nThat was the real change in the job. You had an Afghanistan focus in the fall after 9/11 in my shop. Of course the UN got busier as well.\n\nLong\n\nAs you began to transition and pivot to Afghanistan and the issues there, at what point—or I guess I’d like to understand more about how the decision came to be to work so closely with Pakistan despite the lack of democratic process, despite—the transition from calling him General [Pervez] Musharraf to President Musharraf and all of that, especially from your perspective as having democracy promotion in your portfolio. Was that just seen as a necessary evil? Did they think that he was less autocratic than he ended up being? What was going on there?\n\nAbrams\n\nI should say I don’t really know the answer to that. I was not part of that decision. I am willing to speculate. I think some things are done for national security reasons and you just do them. I think this was that kind of situation. This was an operational necessity and we were going to do it. We were all aware of the problem of this new, wonderful ally. So here I think you would have to say that human rights became a slogan. We had to make believe in a sense that there was progress being made.\n\nOne of the problems you have with human rights policy is that sometimes you make believe there is progress being made in an effort to get it made. That is, it is a careful human rights-oriented tactic. Other times you just say it because you realize you’re going to be accused, so you have to say, well—I don’t know whether anybody really believed that. People had to persuade themselves that he was actually going to move against terror, too, which was probably equally difficult. But I don’t remember there being a real human rights policy with respect to Pakistan.\n\nLeffler\n\nWho was the person on the NSC dealing mostly with Pakistan at that time? I know Armitage is the real point man on Pakistan, but who—\n\nAbrams\n\nWho was it at the NSC?\n\nLeffler\n\nYes.\n\nAbrams\n\nI don’t know. Condi, Steve, Zal. I think Zal at this point has—I think Bruce Riedel is gone, Zal is Senior Director. I don’t think that was split off yet. I think he had Middle East and it extended—you have one other thing. As you get into these wars, this and Iraq, the defense directorate at the NSC becomes more significant. I guess it is Frank [Franklin C.] Miller who is Senior Director, and that becomes more important. I guess it is Armitage and we’re playing a very secondary role.\n\nLeffler\n\nBut soon, now that the wars begin, soon we have detainees and you do get involved.\n\nAbrams\n\nYes.\n\nLeffler\n\nWalk us through from your human rights perspective the trajectory here. Tell us what it was like to deal with David Addington and [Joseph] Cofer Black. I suspect day-by-day you had interactions.\n\nAbrams\n\nNot much with Cofer. I’ll give you my perspective on this. I know from reading these materials and from others it’s a narrow perspective, it’s just one perspective, but I think it is useful. I didn’t know very early on much about black sites. I do remember meetings in the Situation Room where we said, “There are going to be detainees. What are we going to do with the detainees?” I don’t remember much being said about bringing them to the U.S. I don’t remember a big debate as to whether this is a good idea or a bad idea. Rather the question was where are we going to put them outside the U.S.?\n\nI don’t remember who invented Guantanamo. My recollection is that as soon as it appeared on the list, everybody including me said, “Wow, perfect.” Now part of the reason it was perfect was of course that Castro would hate it so much. That was an added—it was near, we had full control. It was a foreign country. It met all of the requirements. I don’t remember there being a long process of deliberation.\n\nRiley\n\nThere wasn’t a long list of possibilities.\n\nAbrams\n\nI think that’s right.\n\nRiley\n\nShipboard was one. Shipboard detention?\n\nAbrams\n\nYes, some places in the Pacific Ocean, but I think Guantanamo was a pretty quick consensus. So people start coming to Guantanamo. I did go down there once, God knows when, probably 2002. There were some regular trips down there for people, including press people. I was very impressed by it. That is, I took a long tour of the medical facility, which was already there, which was fantastic. I think we never got credit for the marvelous medical and dental treatment we gave to the prisoners.\n\nWe had a big problem it seems to me. I’m putting aside the black sites; I didn’t know about that or have anything to do with that. You have these guys starting to come into Guantanamo. It seemed obvious—let me tell this story because I think it is illuminating. What do they do all day? What do they have in their possession? Nothing. They just sit around all day, except you have to give them a Koran, that’s obvious. So [John B.] Bellinger and I—parenthetically I was amused by the—I don’t know if it was Glenn Kessler or whoever wrote the piece that noted what an odd pair we were because he was a Princeton graduate and I was a sort of neocon thug. I thought it was really interesting considering my educational background.\n\nLong\n\nI think it said, “bare-knuckled in-fighter.”\n\nAbrams\n\nRight, from Harvard Law School. [laughter] John and I thought—it’s the kind of thing you do walking back from staff meeting in the morning—This is very stupid. They’re going to be there for a long time and we should give them other reading materials. Why? We said, “Frankly, reading the Koran is only going to make this worse. Let’s give them other stuff.” The State Department by then, 2002, had a bunch of things into translation, into Arabic and probably Urdu. I don’t think we wanted to give them the Federalist Papers, but stuff about America. Maybe even some stuff about Islam. We thought this is obviously very smart to do.\n\nThe reaction from the Defense Department was, “We’re not giving them any reading materials. They’re there to be detained and punished.” John and I both thought that was a really stupid reaction, but obviously it will be overcome when we explain this "
