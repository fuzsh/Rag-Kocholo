        "text": "3:21 P.M. EST\n\nTHE PRESIDENT: (Applause.) Please sit down. Please, please sit down.\n\nJoJo, thank you very much. You know, I can picture him in Desert Storm as a sergeant, barking out orders, can’t you? When my son Beau was promoted to major in Iraq and — I said, “Now you’re a field-grade officer.” He said, “Dad, I have no illusions. I know who runs the Army: sergeants. Sergeants. They’re the officers.”\n\nWell, hello, Pittsburgh. It’s good to be back. It really is good to be.\n\nBefore I begin, let me just talk a little bit about what we all just saw — many of us saw this morning. A bridge more than 50 years old — a hundred — I think it 150 years; it says “50 years old,” but I thought it was older — collapsed right here in Pittsburgh. It had been rated in “poor” condition for the past 10 years.\n\nWhat you all know — if you don’t, you should know — there are another 3,300 bridges here in Pennsylvania, some of which are just as old and just as decrepit — decrepit condition as that bridge was, including here in Pittsburgh, the “City of Bridges.”\n\nI’ve been coming to Pittsburgh a long time. I’m a Pennsylvania kid. I was born and raised, the first part of my life in Pennsylvania, and I’ve been to Pittsburgh a lot. But all these years, I never knew — I never knew Pennsylvania — Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had more bridges than any other city in the world. Yo! (Applause.)\n\nBut across the country, there are 45,000 bridges in “poor” condition. It’s just simply unacceptable.\n\nThat’s why your governor, and your members of Congress, your mayor have been saying for years that we have to do something about this.\n\nI’ve talked about it every time I’ve come to Pittsburgh, and we finally got it done: a Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, including the largest investment in our nation’s bridges since the — since the — Eisenhower put together the Interstate Highway System.\n\nAnd I might add — (applause) — this was the first time in the country’s history that we dedicated a national program to repair and upgrade bridges. And it’s about time.\n\nThe governor can tell you: We’re giving state and local leaders historic funding to make national projects real.\n\nHere in Pennsylvania, that means at least $1.6 billion for bridges alone, $327 million in 2022 alone just to repair bridges.\n\nWe’ve got to get on with it. We’ve got to move. The next time, we don’t need headlines saying that someone was killed when the next bridge collapses.\n\nWe’re also providing billions more for roads and so much more. As we saw today, when a bridge is in disrepair, it literally can threaten lives.\n\nAs soon as we heard about the bridge, we were immediately in contact with the mayor — Mr. Mayor, you’re doing a hell of a job — and the governor and other officials on the ground.\n\nAnd we’re going to rebuild that bridge, along with thousands of other bridges in Pennsylvania and across the country, because it’s in our interest for our own safety’s sake and it generates commerce in a way that we can’t do now.\n\nThat’s part of how we’re going to build a better America. And that’s what I want to talk to you about today.\n\nSo, thank you for the introduction, JoJo. Mayor — Mr. Mayor, County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, it’s great to see you again, pal.\n\nAnd it’s good to be here with so many outstanding folks, particularly the governor — Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman. John, I — if I had you in front of me when I was playing at Delaware, I could have been an All-American. I could have been big. (Laughter.)\n\nBut — and, Conor Lamb, it’s great to see you, man. And you’re doing a hell of a job, all of you.\n\nAnd my good friend and former neighbor in Scranton, Bobby Casey. Now, his dad — we’re about the same spread. His dad wasn’t much older than me than I am than Bobby, but we lived — I lived on North Washington Avenue. Did you notice they changed the end of the road name? It’s the Joe Biden Way now. (Laughter.) Do you know — no, really. Did you see that? (Applause.)\n\nI shouldn’t say this. I’m going to get in trouble in Delaware, Mr. Secretary — but the first thing I asked on the election results — I said, “How did I do in Scranton?” I won every precinct. (Laughter and applause.)\n\nAnd so — I used to drive up Route 81 all the time to get — not just to get to Scranton but to get up to Syracuse when I was at Syracuse Law School. And they now — the entrance to go — to get to Scranton off 81 is the Joe Biden Expressway. So, I’m coming home, Bobby. I’m coming home. (Applause.)\n\nLook, all kidding aside, I want to thank our Commerce Secretary, former governor Gina Raimondo, for joining us today.\n\nAnd I want to thank Congressman Mike Doyle, who couldn’t be here today but who has done so much for this district.\n\nNearly three years ago, I began my campaign for President right here in Pittsburgh — the first major stop I made. (Applause.)\n\nI said back — I said back then I was running to restore the backbone of America: the middle class. It’s time we began to build this country from the middle up and the bottom out so that we — I’ve never known when a wealthy person didn’t do well when the middle class was doing well. We always do better when ordinary, hardworking people have a shot.\n\nAnd after I accepted the party’s nomination in August of 2020, I came here to Mill 19 for my first major campaign stop, and I laid out my vision to build a better America with better pay and greater dignity for the working people, who are the ones who built this country.\n\nI often hear about how — who built the country. Guess what? The middle class built this country, and unions built the middle class. (Applause.)\n\nAnd, folks, making it in America with American manufacturing and easing the financial burdens on millions of families — that’s the same vision I laid out once again when I was here in Pittsburgh when — after — the first stop I made after I was sworn in as President.\n\nNow after my first year, I wanted to come back to Pittsburgh — this is my third time here in this facility — to take stock of what we’ve accomplished together and look forward to the extraordinary opportunities that lie ahead for Pittsburgh and America if we continue to do our job.\n\nFrom day one, every action I’ve taken to rebuild the economy has been guided by one principle: Make it in America, like we used to.\n\nNo one knows that better than all of the folks here in Pittsburgh, and that’s why it matters so much.\n\nMaking it in America is what built this city: the Steel City.\n\nThe arsenal of democracy during World War Two when Pennsylvania generated as much steel as Germany, Japan, and Italy combined, right here in the city of Pittsburgh.\n\nBut Pittsburgh also knows the consequences when we ignore the backbone and fail to invest in ourselves and fail to invest in our people.\n\nSome of you have been around long enough to remember how this city lost 100,000 steel jobs between 1970 and 1990.\n\nI was raised, when I moved from Scranton — my dad didn’t have any work and we moved to Claymont, Delaware. There used to be an outfit called “Worth Steel” where over 6,000 steel- — the town was a company town. There’s not a single steelworker there now.\n\nAnd by the 1980s, more than three quarters of Pittsburgh’s steel capacity had been shuttered. You or your parents remember what you felt like in your neighborhood. It didn’t feel good, the painful ripple effect it had — jobs lost, families ripped apart.\n\nSo you know that to build a truly strong economy, we need a future that’s made in America. That means using products, parts, and materials built right here in the United States of America.\n\nIt means bringing manufacturing back, jobs back; building the supply chains here at home, not outsourcing abroad, so we have better jobs and lower prices here.\n\nIt means betting on America’s workers. And it takes a federal government that doesn’t just give lip service to buying American but actually takes action.\n\nThat’s the approach I’ve taken from day one. And now we’re beginning to see the results.\n\nWe learned this week, after my first year as President, the United States had the fastest economic growth in nearly four decades, along with — (applause) — along with the greatest year of job growth in American history: 6.4 million jobs created in one year. (Applause.)\n\nAnd instead of losing manufacturing jobs, since I’ve been in office, America has actually added an additional 367,000 manufacturing jobs in America — good-paying jobs. The highest increase in U.S. manufacturing jobs in 30 years.\n\nLast week, the CEO of Intel, Pat Gelsinger, came to the White House because he wanted to support the Build Back Better initiative and to also let me know — two of your neighboring senators were here — were there: Portman and Brown, a Democrat and Republican from Ohio.\n\nHe came to announce a new $20 billion semiconductor campus outside of Columbus, Ohio, that’s going to create 10,000 jobs — 7,000 constructing the facility and 3,000 permanent jobs.\n\nAnd, by the way, I was joking — I said, “I may need a job.” He said, “Well, it’s not bad. The average salary is $135,000 a year.” (Applause.)\n\nAnd, folks — and the key is these are jobs manufacturing essential products stamped “Made in America.”\n\nSemiconductors are the — you all know — they’re small computer chips that power virtually everything in everyday life. And they were — originated here in the United States of America. We used to own not only the patent but the technology and the production.\n\nYour phone, your car, your refrigerator, your washing machine, hospital equipment, the Internet, the electric grid, and so much more depend on these chips.\n\nSo, this is going to create thousands of additional jobs, helping build more American products.\n\nFor example, you know, inflation is a problem, which I’ll speak to in a second, and it’s real and a lot of people are being hurt by it. But guess what? One third of the inflation in America is a consequence of the cost of automobiles. One third. You know why? Because of the shortage of semiconductors. They can’t build them. And therefore, the ones that aren’t being built cause the price of those that are being built to go much higher.\n\nThis announcement helps fix that problem.\n\nThree days ago, I called a meeting in the White House of CEOs from General Motors, Ford, Microsoft, Hewlett Packard, and others.\n\nMary Barra, General Motors CEO, announced in the White House an initial $7 billion investment in Michigan to manufacture electric vehicles, creating 4,000 new quality jobs.\n\nThat’s on top of the announcement made by the CEO of Ford, Jim Farley, last year, investing $11 billion in electric vehicles, creating 11,000 new jobs.\n\nAnd today, right here in Western Pennsylvania, the Union Pacific Railroad is announcing the largest purchase of American-made battery-electric locomotives in all of history. (Applause.)\n\nAnd, by the way, guess who’s supplying those batteries? General Motors.\n\nFolks, I want to tell you: It matters. It matters a lot.\n\nThe company that will build those locomotives is called Wabtec. “W-A-B” in their name is because they grew out of the old Westinghouse Air Brake Company, a classic Pittsburgh manufacturer.\n\nWabtec is based here in Pittsburgh. And these locomotives will be built up in Erie at the same plant that Thomas Edison built the General Electrics — for General Electric more than a century ago.\n\nNot only will these locomotives be running here at home, powering our economy and decreasing pollution, Wabtec will also be exporting them to Canada, to Australia, and all around the world, again, creating more good-paying jobs. (Applause.) Folks — in the process, reducing climate change, generating jobs here in Western Pennsylvania. As I said, good-paying jobs you can raise a family on."
