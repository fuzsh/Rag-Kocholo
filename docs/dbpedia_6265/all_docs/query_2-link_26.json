        "text": "Utah Senate Results\n\nUtah Senate Results\n\nUtah is one of the most Republican states in the nation. It has not elected a Democratic governor since 1980 or a Democratic senator since 1970, or voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. See 2020 primary results\n\nNotes\n\nAll times ET.\n\nNot all candidates are listed.\n\nCNN will broadcast a projected winner only after an extensive review of data from a number of sources.\n\n\"Flipped seat\" denotes a race where the 2020 projected winner is from a different party than the previous winner or incumbent.\n\nBoth Maine and Nebraska allow electoral votes to be split. In Maine, two of four electoral votes go to the statewide winner and one electoral vote goes to the winner in each of the two congressional districts. In Nebraska, two of five electoral votes go to the winner of the statewide vote. One electoral vote goes to the winner in each of Nebraska's three congressional districts."
