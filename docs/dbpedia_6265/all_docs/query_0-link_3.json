        "text": "The Modern Senate: 1964-Present\n\nThis collection of brief essays describes important events and personalities in Senate history, and highlights recurring themes in the Senate's institutional development during the modern era of the Senate, 1964 to the present (click on title for full story).\n\nMay 8, 1964\n\nHarry Truman often said the happiest years of his life were spent in the United States Senate. It is not surprising, therefore, that he chose to celebrate his 80th birthday with a return visit.\n\nJune 10, 1964\n\nBefore the Senate could vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1964, it first had to end the filibuster that delayed that vote. After weeks of careful organizing, head counting, and skillful persuasion, the bill's supporters had enough votes to achieve cloture, end debate, and force a vote on one of the most important bills of the 20th century.\n\nJune 25, 1964\n\nToday, the U.S. Capitol has many rooms and spaces named after respected senators. The tradition of named spaces dates back to 1964, when room S-211, informally known as the \"Taj Mahal,\" became the Lyndon B. Johnson Room.\n\nJuly 9, 1964\n\nWhen Senator Strom Thurmond attempted to prevent the Commerce Committee from obtaining a quorum so it could vote on a nomination, Ralph Yarborough jovially tried to talk him out of it. In a similarly light-hearted manner, Thurmond challenged Yarborough to a wrestling match in which the winner would have his way.\n\nJuly 15, 1965\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Senate party officials had experienced difficulty in recruiting temporary presiding officers for late-afternoon and evening sessions of the Senate. This situation came to a dramatic head on the evening of July 15, 1965, during one of Senator Wayne Morse's late afternoon floor speeches.\n\nJuly 30, 1965\n\nOn July 30, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson traveled to the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri, to sign Medicare into law. His gesture drew attention to the 20 years it had taken Congress to enact government health insurance for senior citizens after Truman had proposed it. In fact, Medicare's history dated back even further.\n\nAugust 4, 1965\n\nOn August 4, 1965, the U.S. Senate passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The long-delayed issue of voting rights had come to the forefront because of a voter registration drive launched by civil rights activists in Selma, Alabama. The \"outrage of Selma\" had spurred the federal government's response, and the efforts of a bipartisan group on the Senate Judiciary Committee helped ensure that the previously disenfranchised would gain political equality through the power of the ballot.\n\nAugust 6, 1965\n\nOn August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson came to the Capitol to sign the Voting Rights Act. Following a ceremony in the Rotunda, the president, congressional leaders, Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and others crowded into the President's Room near the Senate Chamber for the actual signing.\n\nJanuary 17, 1966\n\nWhen President Lyndon B. Johnson scheduled his State of the Union address for prime time in 1965, the importance of his effort was not lost on members of Congress—particularly Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen. The following year, Dirksen and House Minority Leader Gerald Ford recorded a 30-minute televised rebuttal to the president's speech that aired several days later. Today, thanks to the efforts of Dirksen and Ford, the opposition response is anticipated and discussed almost as much as the president's speech.\n\nJanuary 24, 1966\n\nOn January 24, 1966, Secretary of State Dean Rusk appeared before a closed hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His testimony convinced committee chairman J. William Fulbright that the administration of President Lyndon Johnson was blinded by its \"anticommunist assumptions.\" Fulbright launched a high-profile series of widely televised public \"educational\" hearings on the Vietnam War in February 1966.\n\nNovember 3, 1966\n\nOn November 3, 1966, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Clean Waters Restoration Act, which provided federal funds for the construction of sewage treatment plants. Thanks in large part to Maine senator Edmund Muskie, this act, and others that followed over the next decade, had a significant impact in reducing pollution and restoring rivers like the Potomac.\n\nJanuary 11, 1967\n\nDuring his 32 years in the U.S. Senate, William Proxmire earned a number of nicknames: maverick, tightwad, iconoclast. Perhaps the one that suits him best is \"bulldog.\" Proxmire \"clamps his prominent jaws hard on the edge of an issue,\" wrote a reporter, \"and simply refuses to let go….\" It was Proxmire's dogged support for the Genocide Treaty that eventually led to its approval, an achievement 19 years in the making.\n\nFebruary 17, 1967\n\nSenator Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois, known for his mellifluous voice and oratorical skills, frequently entertained and enlightened his Senate colleagues. One day in 1967, he used those skills to defend an obscure little subcommittee.\n\n1968\n\nIn 1968 California senator George Murphy moved to a desk in the back row on the Republican side of the Senate Chamber. Possessing a sweet tooth, he always kept candy in his desk and invited his colleagues to help themselves to the candy supply. Thanks to Senator Murphy, a new tradition—the \"candy desk\"—was born, but what about the man behind the tradition?\n\nJanuary 3, 1969\n\nThirty-four-year-old Carl Hayden arrived on Capitol Hill in 1912 as Arizona's first member in the House of Representatives. He retired as that state's senior senator on January 3, 1969, at the age of 91. Hayden spent 56 consecutive years in Congress, including 42 in the Senate, for a total of 20,773 days.\n\nSeptember 7, 1969\n\nSenator Everett McKinley Dirksen, arguably the most effective minority leader in Senate history, died on September 7, 1969. More than just a skillful legislator, Dirksen personified the U.S. Senate in the 1960s, and even became a recording star.\n\nSeptember 24, 1969\n\nThe Senate lost one of its greatest leaders on September 7, 1969—Everett McKinley Dirksen of Illinois. The Republican leader's death left quite a vacuum. Within hours, speculation focused on a successor. \"The cast is big,\" commented one observer, \"the actors are skilled if a little inclined to bombast; the plot is seasoned with elements of intrigue, comedy, and suspense in a mystery drama\" entitled, \"After Dirksen, Who?\"\n\nApril 22, 1970\n\nUnited States senator Gaylord Nelson (D-WI) helped launch the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. An astonishing success, the first Earth Day in 1970 was celebrated by some 20 million Americans on 2,000 college campuses, at 10,000 primary and secondary schools, and in hundreds of communities.\n\nJanuary 25, 1971\n\nOn January 25, 1971, the Senate Chamber's current voice amplification system began operation, thus ending over 100 years of the Chamber's poor acoustics. Soon after members moved into the new Chamber in January 1859, they began to complain about their difficulty in hearing floor proceedings. Over the years, as the nation grew, additional senators exacerbated the noise problem, and even a 1949–50 renovation project failed to help. Relief finally came in 1971.\n\nMay 13, 1971\n\nThe tradition of Senate pages dates back to the 1820s, when the Senate began hiring boys to attend the Senate Chamber, run errands, and deliver messages. Not until 1971, however, did any girls follow that path. On May 13, 1971, the Senate finally agreed to appoint its first female pages.\n\nMarch 22, 1972\n\nThe Equal Rights Amendment has been a perennial topic in Congress since 1923, but not until 1972 did both houses of Congress approve the ERA with a constitutionally required two-thirds majority. After the bill passed the House in 1971 with a seven-year enacting clause provision attached, Indiana senator Birch Bayh used his position as Judiciary subcommittee chairman to adopt the House bill as a substitute amendment to an existing Senate joint resolution. The bill faced considerable opposition, however, from one powerful member.\n\nJuly 22, 1974\n\nFormer Oregon Senator Wayne Morse died on July 22,1974. His admirers knew him as \"The Tiger in the Senate.\" His many enemies, including five presidents, called him a lot worse. Today he is remembered as a gifted lawmaker and principled maverick who thrived on controversy.\n\nDecember 19, 1974\n\nThe first television broadcast from the Senate Chamber occurred at 10:00 p.m. on December 19, 1974. That broadcast had nothing to do with C-SPAN, which did not yet exist, but it had everything to do with the scandals that rocked the Nixon administration and resulted in the resignations of both the vice president and the president.\n\nJuly 29, 1975\n\nSoon after he entered the Senate early in 1975, Iowa Democrat John Culver concluded that the upper house was in danger of becoming dysfunctional. On July 29, 1975, in response to Senator Culver's widely shared concerns, the Senate authorized the first-ever review of its administrative and legislative operations by an outside panel. Today, the Culver/Hughes Commission retains its status as the only outside body ever invited to review the Senate's internal operations.\n\nSeptember 16, 1975\n\nThe closest election in Senate history was decided on September 16, 1975. The 1974 New Hampshire race for an open seat that pitted Republican Louis Wyman against Democrat John Durkin.\n\nMarch 4, 1976\n\nIn the early months of 1975, the Senate struggled to resolve two contested elections. In New Hampshire, Republican Louis Wyman claimed a 355-vote margin over Democrat John Durkin. The second protracted 1975 contest involved the Oklahoma seat to which Republican Henry Bellmon was seeking reelection.\n\nJune 16, 1976\n\nAfter the Senate moved to its current chamber in 1859, the Supreme Court took up residence in the old chamber until 1935, when it moved to its permanent building. The Senate and House then agreed to restore the room to its 1850s elegance. Despite this agreement, decades passed with no action. Finally, the Old Senate Chamber restoration project concluded with a festive dedication ceremony on June 16, 1976.\n\nMarch 21, 1980\n\nOn March 21, 1980, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd launched a unique historical project—an unprecedented series of addresses on the Senate's history and operations. These essays, later revised and published, became the centerpiece of the Senate's 1989 bicentennial commemoration.\n\nMarch 21, 1980\n\nOn March 21, 1980, Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd launched a unique historical project—an unprecedented series of addresses on the Senate's history and operations. These essays, later revised and published, became the centerpiece of the Senate's 1989 bicentennial commemoration.\n\nSeptember 28, 1981\n\nAmericans often think of a filibuster as someone holding the Senate floor for hours in order to keep a bill from passing. In fact, filibusters include many strategies to block action. In the modern Senate, extraordinarily long speeches have been aimed at drawing attention to an issue rather than blocking legislative action. Such was the case on September 28, 1981, when Wisconsin senator William Proxmire rose to deliver what would become one of the longest speeches in Senate history.\n\nNovember 22, 1982\n\nRecognizing the looming need for more Senate working space, Congress in 1972 authorized construction of a third office building. In 1976, as workers broke ground for the third facility, senators agreed to name it after Michigan's Philip A. Hart, a deeply respected colleague who was then in his final struggle with cancer. When the building's office suites for 50 senators became ready in November 1982, only a bold few senators chose to risk public scorn by moving there.\n\nNovember 7, 1983\n\nOn November 7, 1983, at 10:58 p.m., a thunderous explosion tore through the second floor of the Capitol's north wing. Fortunately, owing to the late hour, the adjacent halls were virtually deserted. Although the explosion caused no structural damage to the Capitol, it shattered mirrors, chandeliers, and furniture. Officials calculated damages of $250,000.\n\nJune 2, 1986\n\nBy early 1986, Majority Leader Bob Dole and Democratic Leader Robert C. Byrd worried that the lack of television coverage was transforming the Senate into the nation's forgotten legislative body. House members were becoming far more visible than senators to their constituents. The two leaders eventually engineered a vote in which the Senate agreed to a three-month trial period, with live national coverage to begin on June 2, 1986. Within weeks, the Senate voted to make this coverage permanent.\n\nMay 5, 1987\n\nThe monumental sculpture, entitled Mountains and Clouds, occupies the nine-story atrium of the Hart Senate Office Building. Rising 51 feet, the mountains are formed from 36 tons of sheet steel painted black. Until 2016, a 75-foot-wide black mobile, representing clouds, was suspended above this stabile. The Senate dedicated Mountains and Clouds on May 5, 1987.\n\nFebruary 24, 1988\n\nSOn February 23, 1988, Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd decided the time had come to end a filibuster on Senate campaign finance reform. The leader moved to instruct the sergeant at arms to arrest the absentees. Senate Sergeant at Arms Henry Guigni, a former vice squad policeman, led a \"posse of six Capitol police officers\" in a post-midnight search of members' hideaway offices and Senate office building suites.\n\nApril 6, 1989\n\nIn the early 1980s, Senate leaders began to think ahead to the body's forthcoming 200th anniversary in 1989. Wishing to maximize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to focus national attention on the Senate's history, traditions, and constitutional role, floor leaders Howard Baker and Robert C. Byrd arranged for the establishment of a special 15-member Study Group on the Commemoration of the Senate Bicentenary.\n\nNovember 3, 1992\n\nIn the elections of November 1992, four women were elected to the United States Senate. Never before had this happened in a single election year. Headline writers hailed \"The Year of the Woman.\"\n\nJanuary 13, 1993\n\nWhat is the meaning of the verb \"to try?\" In 1992, justices of the U.S. Supreme Court consulted a shelf-full of dictionaries in search of a precise answer. They sought to settle a case initiated by a federal district judge, who in 1989 had been impeached by the House of Representatives and removed from office by the Senate. Imprisoned on a conviction for lying to a grand jury, Judge Walter Nixon disputed the Senate's interpretation of \"try\" as it exercised its exclusive constitutional power to \"to try all impeachments.\"\n\nMarch 24, 1998\n\nIn 1998 Majority Leader Trent Lott introduced his \"Leader's Lecture Series,\" which would present observations of nine former Senate party leaders and vice presidents of the United States. The first speaker was 95-year-old Mike Mansfield who took the lectern to recall lessons learned during his record-setting tenure as leader, from 1961 to 1977. With the Montana Democrat's opening remarks, it became clear to the audience that the evening would bring an added historical treat.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001\n\nOn the morning of September 11, 2001, the Capitol once again became the target of foreign enemies. As two hijacked commercial airplanes thundered into the twin towers of New York City's World Trade Center, and another flew into the Pentagon, a fourth plane—through the heroic struggle of its passengers—missed its intended target and crashed into a Pennsylvania field southeast of Pittsburgh. Subsequent investigations by the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks discovered a high probability that the Capitol was the intended target of the Flight 93 hijackers.\n\nNovember 7, 2002\n\nIn 2002, the Senate set a new record for member seniority. For the first time in history, the Senate included three incumbent members who have served 40 or more years—Senators Strom Thurmond, Robert C. Byrd, and Edward Kennedy. The start of the 108th Congress also saw a Senate with three 40-year veterans: Senators Byrd, Kennedy, and Daniel Inouye.\n\nNovember 22, 2002\n\nOver the course of its 656 days in session, from January 3, 2001, to November 22, 2002, the 107th Congress proved to be, in the title of a 2003 memoir by Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \"Like No Other Time.\"\n\nDecember 2, 2008\n\nA magnificent 19-foot-tall plaster statue rises in the Capitol Visitor Center's Emancipation Hall. This Statue of Freedom looks so fresh that a visitor might think it was created for just that space. In fact, it is 150 years old."
