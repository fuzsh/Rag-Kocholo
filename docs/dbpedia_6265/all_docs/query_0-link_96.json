        "text": "Article\n\nUS Women's Suffrage Timeline 1648 to 2016\n\nThis is an extended timeline of the fight for women's suffrage in the United States. It includes information on failed and successful attempts at changes in law, including at the state and federal levels, how women's suffrage has been interlaced with quests for other civil rights, and some key court cases. It spans the years from 1648, when Margaret Brent demands but is denied a vote in Maryland's colonial assembly through 2016, when Belmont-Paul Women's Equality National Monument was designated.\n\n1648\n\nJanuary 21: As an unmarried woman with property, and serving as the lawyer for Lord Baltimore, Margaret Brent demands but is denied a vote in Maryland’s colonial assembly.\n\n1756\n\nOctober 30: Lydia Taft, recent widow of Josiah Taft, of Uxbridge, Massachusetts, is allowed to vote as Josiah’s proxy at a town meeting. The vote was regarding the town’s involvement in the French and Indian Wars. Lydia is the first white woman to vote in what was to become the United States. (Women in many Native American tribes were leaders and influenced decisions long before Europeans arrived.)\n\n1776\n\nJuly 2: The New Jersey constitution of 1776 is adopted. It allows all residents who own a specific amount of property to vote, without reference to gender or race. Thus, unmarried or widowed women (Black and white) and Black men could vote if they met the other requirements. Married women could not vote because legally they could not own property (all of their property reverted to their husbands upon marriage).\n\n1787\n\nMay to September: The United States Constitutional Convention is held at what is now Independence Hall in Philadelphia. At the convention, it is decided that states have the right to determine qualifications required to vote.\n\n1790\n\nMarch 26: The Naturalization Act of 1790 passes. It allows white men born outside of the United States to become citizens. Because the ability to decide voting requirements is held by the states, becoming a citizen does not automatically confer voting rights.\n\nThe Acts of the Fifteenth General Assembly of New Jersey refer to voters as both “he” and “she.”\n\n1807\n\nThe New Jersey legislature limits the vote to “free, white, male citizens” as a means of favoring the party in power.\n\n1838\n\nKentucky passes a statewide woman suffrage law that grants the vote to female heads of household in elections deciding on taxes and schools.\n\n1840\n\nJune 12-23: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Lucretia Mott, and other women are excluded from the 1840 World Antislavery Congress in London. Permitted to attend as spectators, they are not allowed to take part. In response, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott resolve to “form a society to advocate the rights of women.”\n\n1846\n\nJune 1 through October 9: A New York State Constitutional Convention is held. Six property-owning women from the state petition the Convention, demanding “equal, and civil and political rights” enjoyed by white men in the state. Their demands are denied.\n\n1848\n\nJuly 19-20: A Women’s Rights Convention is held in Seneca Falls, New York. Three hundred attend the convention organized in part by Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Frederick Douglass is one of those present. One hundred of the attendees sign the Declaration of Sentiments, which includes a call for women’s access to the vote.\n\n1849\n\nA Michigan Senate committee proposes that the state adopt universal suffrage. The proposal dies in committee because woman suffrage is viewed as “unusual” and “needless.”\n\n1850\n\nOctober 23-24: The First National Women’s Rights Convention is held in Worcester, Massachusetts. Almost 1,000 men and women from eleven states (including California) attend.\n\n1851\n\nMay 29: Sojourner Truth gives her “Ain’t I a Woman” speech at a Women’s Convention in Akron, Ohio.\n\nOctober 15-16: The Second National Women’s Rights Convention is held in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\n1852\n\nSeptember 8-10: The Third National Women’s Rights Convention is held in Syracuse, New York.\n\n1853\n\nOctober 6-8: The Fourth National Women’s Rights Convention is held in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n1854\n\nOctober 18-20: The Fifth National Women’s Rights Convention is held in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Territorial Legislature of Washington considers a law granting women the right to vote. It is defeated by a single vote. Shortly after, the Territorial Legislature passes a law stating that “no female shall have the right of ballot or vote.”\n\n1855\n\nOctober 17-18: The Sixth National Women’s Rights Convention is held in Cincinnati, Ohio. The crowd is standing-room only.\n\n1856\n\nNovember 25-26: The Seventh National Women’s Rights Convention is held in New York City.\n\n1857\n\nMarch: The US Supreme Court rules in Dred Scott v. Sandford that the US Constitution is not meant to include Black people as citizens. The Dred Scott decision is later overturned by the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution (abolishing slavery) and the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution (conferring citizenship on all persons born or naturalized in the United States).\n\nIowa’s new state constitution includes “white” in the description of who can vote.\n\n1858\n\nMay 13-14: The Eighth National Woman’s Rights Convention is held in New York City.\n\n1859\n\nMay 12: The Ninth National Woman’s Rights Convention is held in New York City.\n\n1860\n\nMay 10-11: The Tenth National Woman’s Rights Convention is held in New York City. Up to 800 people attended.\n\n1861\n\nJanuary 29: Kansas Territory becomes the state of Kansas. The state’s constitution includes the rights of women to participate in school district elections.\n\nApril 12: The US Civil War starts. Suffrage activity across the country is minimal, as people focus on the war effort.\n\n1862\n\nWomen in Oregon who are widows and have children and taxable property are granted the vote in school elections. Women of color are excluded due to restrictions on property ownership.\n\n1865\n\nMay 9: The US Civil War ends\n\n1866\n\nMay 10: The Eleventh National Women’s Rights Convention is held in New York City. Black and white attendees form the American Equal Rights Association to argue for universal suffrage: access to the ballot “irrespective of race, color, or sex.”\n\nThe election laws in Washington Territory states that “all white citizens” can vote, opening the ballot again to women. This interpretation is untested until 1869.\n\n1867\n\nJune 1867 to February 1868: At the New York State Constitutional Convention, delegates vote 125 to 19 to give the vote to Black men, but not to women. The state’s voters reject this new constitution altogether in the 1869 elections, and neither group receives the vote.\n\nOctober: Women in Vineland, New Jersey form the Vineland Equal Rights Association and petition the state for “Impartial Suffrage, Irrespective of Sex or Color.”\n\nThe Impartial Suffrage Association in Kansas is organized to fight for two amendments to the state constitution: one to remove “white” and one to remove “male” from the state’s voting requirements. Both efforts fail.\n\nMichigan’s Legislature allows women who pay taxes the right to vote for school trustees.\n\nMarch: Congressman George Washington Julian, representing Indiana, introduces what at the time would have been the Sixteenth Amendment to the US Constitution recognizing women’s suffrage. It is defeated.\n\nJuly 9: The Fourteenth Amendment is adopted. It defines who is a citizen of the United States: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Women, therefore, are citizens (unless part of a group excluded from this amendment). After this, questions of what rights and responsibilities come with citizenship are debated.\n\nNovember: The New England Woman Suffrage Association is founded, with Julia Ward Howe (composer of the Battle Hymn of the Republic) as president. Lucy Stone serves on the executive committee, and later becomes president of the organization.\n\nDecember: Congressman George W. Julian of Indiana introduces language for a constitutional amendment for universal suffrage: “The right of suffrage in the United States shall be based on citizenship, and shall be regulated by Congress, and all citizens of the United States, whether native or naturalized, shall enjoy this right equally, without any distinction or discrimination whatever founded on race, color, or sex.” It does not pass.\n\nIowa citizens vote to remove “white” from the state constitution’s description of who could vote. This gives Black and Native American men the vote by law (though not necessarily in practice).\n\nJanuary 19: The Twelfth (and final) National Women’s Rights Convention is held in Washington, D.C.\n\nMay 12: The American Equal Rights Association undergoes a painful split at their annual meeting. Attendees include Frederick Douglass, Lucy Stone, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and Susan B. Anthony. At the meeting, Frederick Douglass argues that Black men’s right to vote should take precedence over women’s right to vote, “With us, the matter is a question of life and death.” Anthony replies that, despite that, Douglass “would not exchange his sex.” Lucy Stone states that “woman suffrage is more imperative than his own.”\n\nMay 15: The National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) is established by Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and others.\n\nNovember: The American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) is founded, led by Lucy Stone. The group is made up largely of members of the New England Woman Suffrage Association.\n\nDecember 10: Women in Wyoming Territory are granted unrestricted suffrage.\n\nMary Olney Brown attempts to vote in Olympia, Washington Territory and is turned away because she is not considered a citizen.\n\nThe Nevada state legislature passes an amendment removing the words “male” and “white” from the state voting requirements. To become law, the amendment has to pass in two sessions of the legislature; the second legislature meets in 1871.\n\nAt a state women’s suffrage convention in St. Louis, Missouri, Virginia Minor argues that “the Constitution of the United States gives me every right and privilege to which every other citizen is entitled.” Later the same year, she and her husband circulate pamphlets arguing that the Fourteenth Amendment grants women the vote by right of citizenship. In the following years, hundreds of women across the country go to the polls using this logic. Most are denied; some are arrested.\n\nFebruary 12: The Utah Territory grants all women over the age of 21 years suffrage in any election.\n\nMarch 30: The Fifteenth Amendment becomes law. It prohibits exclusion from voting “on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” In response, many former Confederate states pass Jim Crow laws that disenfranchise Black and poor white men from voting through poll taxes, literacy tests, and other restrictions.\n\nApril 2: Victoria Woodhull announces her candidacy for President of the United States in a letter to the editor of the New York Herald.\n\nJune 6: Mary Olney Brown again tries to vote in Olympia, Washington Territory, and is denied. Her sister, Charlotte Olney French and seven other women successfully vote in Grand Mound, Washington. Eight women in the Black River precinct of the state also successfully vote.\n\nA woman suffrage amendment to the Vermont state constitution is soundly defeated at the constitutional convention.\n\nMichigan’s legislature approves woman suffrage; the law is vetoed by the governor.\n\nJanuary 11: Victoria Woodhull testifies to the Judiciary Committee of the United States House of Representatives (the first woman to address a House committee). She argues that the Fourteenth Amendment grants women the right to vote. The committee disagrees.\n\nOctober: Carrie Burnham tries to vote in Philadelphia. She argues that the Fourteenth Amendment and Pennsylvania law guaranteeing the vote to “freemen” allow her to vote. Election officials refuse to let her. Her case goes to the state Supreme Court. They issue their decision in 1873.\n\nThe Nevada legislature votes against the woman suffrage legislation it had approved in 1869. Woman suffrage fails in Nevada until 1914.\n\nNew Mexico denies woman suffrage.\n\nMary Ann Shadd Cary and a group of over sixty women try to register to vote in Washington, DC. They are unsuccessful.\n\nMay 10: Victoria Woodhull is nominated for President of the United States by the Equal Rights Party. Her platform supports woman suffrage and equal rights. Frederick Douglass is nominated as her Vice Presidential running mate. Not present at the meeting, he never acknowledges the nomination.\n\nOctober 15: In St. Louis, Missouri, Virginia Minor is not allowed to register to vote. She and her husband sue. The case is eventually decided by the US Supreme Court, who issue their decision in 1875.\n\nNovember 5: The Woodhull/Douglass Presidential ticket receives a very small percentage of the popular vote nationwide, and no electoral votes.\n\nNovember 5: Four women in Portland, Oregon (including one African American woman) turn out to vote in the presidential election. The election judge accepts their ballots, but does not put them into the ballot box. Their votes are not counted.\n\nNovember 5: Susan B. Anthony is one of several women in Rochester, New York to vote in the presidential election. Anthony is arrested and charged with voting illegally. Her case is heard by a federal court, who issue their decision in 1873. The other women who voted are arrested but not charged. The election inspectors who allowed the women to vote are arrested and found guilty. President Ulysses S. Grant pardons them after they are jailed for refusing to pay their fines.\n\nThe Dakota Territorial Legislature defeats woman suffrage by a single vote.\n\nIowa’s General Assembly rejects a woman suffrage resolution.\n\n1873\n\nApril 4: The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania rules against Carrie Burnham.\n\nJune: In United States v. Susan B. Anthony, the court concludes that citizenship does not automatically confer the right to vote. Susan B. Anthony is convicted of voting without having the right to do so. She is fined $100 for voting; she never pays. Because the judge rules that Anthony will not be jailed for failure to pay, her case cannot move to the US Supreme Court.\n\nDecember 16: Pennsylvania’s 1873 constitution is ratified. It replaces the words “white freeman” with “male citizens,” affirming the Fifteenth Amendment. It continues to exclude women. The new constitution goes into effect as of January 1, 1874.\n\n1874\n\nNovember: The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) is founded in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nMichigan votes on a woman suffrage referendum. It is defeated by more than three-to-one.\n\n1875\n\nMarch 29: The US Supreme Court decides Virginia Minor’s case. She argues that Missouri’s limiting of the vote to men is unconstitutional. While the court agrees that women are citizens and therefore “entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizenship,” voting is not one of them. “The Constitution,” they write, “does not confer the right of suffrage upon any one.”\n\nWomen in Minnesota gain the right to vote in school board elections.\n\n1878\n\nJanuary 10: An amendment is introduced to the US Senate recognizing women’s right to vote. Introduced by Senator Aaron Sargent of California, it is modeled on the Fifteenth Amendment. The Senate does not vote on the amendment until 1887.\n\nNew Hampshire approves school suffrage for women.\n\nAn Oregon law goes into effect removing marital status (“widow”) from the 1862 qualifications for women to vote.\n\n1880\n\nEarly 1880: New York State women gain the right to vote in school elections.\n\nFebruary 18: Thirteen women in Syracuse, New York register and vote, the first time women had legally voted in the state since 1777.\n\nVermont’s state legislature gives tax-paying women the right to vote in school elections.\n\nMary Ann Shadd Cary establishes the Colored Women’s Franchise Association in Washington, DC. The organization links suffrage to political rights as well as education and labor issues.\n\n1881\n\nAt their National Convention in Washington, DC, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union formally endorses woman suffrage. They believe that women will vote to protect their homes from evils like alcohol. They support limiting access to the vote to those who can pass an educational test.\n\nThe first volume of The History of Woman Suffrage is published by Susan B. Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Ida Husted Harper, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It excludes women of color from what became the popular history of woman suffrage. Five more volumes are published through 1922.\n\n1882\n\nJanuary 9: The United States Senate forms a Select Committee on Woman Suffrage to consider “all petitions, bills, and resolves asking for the extension to suffrage to women or the removal of their legal disabilities.” The committee is disbanded in 1921.\n\n1883\n\nThe Washington Territorial Legislature passes a law granting the vote to “All American citizens, above the age of twenty-one years, and all American half-breeds, over that age, who have adopted the habits of the whites, and all inhabitants of this territory above that age… Whenever the word ‘his’ occurs [in this law], it shall be construed to mean ‘his or her,’ as the case may be.” White women and Metis who have assimilated into white society vote in the territory for four years. In 1887, the Washington Territorial Supreme Court invalidates the law.\n\n1884\n\nNovember 3: The United States Supreme Court decides in Elk v. Wilkins that Native Americans are not eligible to vote in US elections, even if they own property and pay taxes. Their logic is that they are citizens of Indian nations, not of the United States – even if, like John Elk, they have given up their tribal affiliation and culture.\n\nOregon voters defeat a referendum to add woman suffrage to the state constitution by almost three-to-one.\n\n1885\n\nBoth houses of the Dakota Territorial Legislature pass a bill for woman suffrage. It is vetoed by the Governor.\n\nLate 1880s\n\nSarah Garnet establishes the Brooklyn Colored Woman’s Equal Suffrage League, the first organization of Black women devoted solely to suffrage.\n\n1887\n\nEarly 1887: Kansas passes a law granting women the vote in municipal elections state-wide.\n\nJanuary 25: The women’s vote amendment first introduced to the US Senate in 1878 is defeated.\n\nFebruary 8: The Dawes Act grants US citizenship to Native Americans, but only those willing to give up their tribal membership, lands, and culture. Despite being citizens, Native Americans are still considered “wards” of the federal government, and therefore generally forbidden to vote in US local, state, or federal elections.\n\nMarch 3: The Edmunds-Tucker Act becomes effective (the US Congress had passed the law on March 22, 1882). The Act is written to limit polygamy among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). The Act removes the right to vote from all Utah women and from men with multiple wives.\n\nApril 6: Rhode Island voters defeat a woman suffrage referendum by a margin of almost four to one.\n\nThe Washington Territorial Supreme Court overturns the territory’s 1883 suffrage law. They argue that Congress had not intended to give territories the authority to enfranchise women.\n\n1888\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and others establish the International Council of Women at a meeting in Washington, DC. The organization advocates internationally for women’s rights, including suffrage.\n\n1889\n\nSeptember 30: The Wyoming state convention approves a constitution that includes woman suffrage. It goes into effect when Wyoming becomes a state in 1890.\n\nWoman suffrage is considered to be added to Washington’s new state constitution. The woman suffrage measure fails to pass.\n\n1890\n\nFebruary 18: The National Woman Suffrage Association and the American Woman Suffrage Association merge to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association\n\nMarch 27: Washington state women are granted the right to vote in some local school district elections.\n\nJuly 10: Wyoming becomes a state. With woman suffrage included in its new state constitution, Wyoming becomes the first state with woman suffrage.\n\nNovember 4: An amendment to the state constitution to add woman suffrage is defeated in South Dakota by a margin of two-to-one.\n\n1891\n\nNew Mexico denies woman suffrage.\n\nWomen in Illinois are given the right to vote for school officers.\n\n1893\n\nColorado state voters pass woman suffrage with 55% of the vote.\n\n1894\n\nAugust: The New York State constitutional convention votes 97 to 58 against woman suffrage.\n\nWomen in Iowa are granted the right to vote on school issues.\n\n1895\n\nJuly: The National Conference of the Colored Women of America convenes, organized by Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and the Woman’s Era Club. From this meeting comes the Federation of African-American Women, the forerunner of the National Association of Colored Women (founded in 1896). These groups focus in part on woman suffrage, as well as other issues affecting Black women.\n\n1896\n\nJanuary 4: Utah becomes a state. Woman suffrage is included in the new state constitution, restoring women’s right to vote taken away by the 1887 Edmunds-Tucker Act.\n\nJuly: The National Association of Colored Women is founded. Members advocate for woman suffrage and women’s rights.\n\nNovember 3: A woman suffrage amendment to the California constitution is on the ballot. It receives 44.6% of the vote, and fails.\n\nNovember 3: Idaho voters vote in favor of adding woman suffrage to the state constitution.\n\n1897\n\nMarch: Women in Eugene, Oregon are prevented from voting in local school elections, despite the law of 1878. Suffragist Laura Harris sues. The Oregon Supreme Court issues their decision (Harris v. Burr) in 1898.\n\nJune 4: The Constitution of the State of Delaware is adopted. It retains “male” as a qualification for voting, despite attempts to remove the requirement.\n\nVoters in New Jersey defeat a proposal to allow women to vote in school elections.\n\nVoters in the Oklahoma Territory defeat a proposal for women's access to the vote.\n\n1898\n\nAugust 12: The Territory of Hawai’i is established. Woman suffrage is explicitly left out of the territorial constitution. The last indigenous ruler of the islands, Queen Lili’uokalani, is removed from power by the United States in 1893.\n\nThe Delaware State Legislature passes a law allowing taxpaying women to vote in school elections.\n\n1899\n\nVoters in the Oklahoma Territory again defeat a proposal for women's access to the vote.\n\n1900\n\nOregon voters closely defeat a referendum to add woman suffrage to the state constitution. The pro-suffrage vote was 48%.\n\n1902\n\nFebruary 12-18: The First Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance is held. Women from ten nations meet in Washington, DC to discuss organizing around international woman suffrage.\n\nNew Hampshire voters defeat a woman’s suffrage referendum.\n\n1903\n\nMarch 10: In a referendum, voters in New Hampshire defeat a woman suffrage amendment to the state’s constitution.\n\nOctober 10: Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel establish the Women’s Social and Political Union in England. Their militant tactics inspire US suffragists, including Alice Paul.\n\nNovember 9-23: The annual convention of the American Federation of Labor is held in Boston. At the convention, the Women’s Trade Union League (WTUL) is established. The WTUL argues for woman suffrage as a means of improving working conditions; they are instrumental in fostering the support of working men for woman suffrage.\n\n1906\n\nA referendum on the Oregon ballot for woman suffrage fails, with 44% support.\n\nHarriot Stanton Blatch (daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton) establishes the Equality League of Self-Supporting Women (later the Women’s Political Union). Members are professional and industrial working women, emphasizing the connection between woman suffrage and labor. As part of their work, they organize suffrage parades.\n\nThe Oklahoma Constitutional Convention meets prior to Oklahoma Territory becoming a state. In the face of strong opposition (that voting would undermine women's role of homemaker and a desire to keep African American women from voting), the new state's constitution allowed women to vote only in school elections. It becomes law in 1907.\n\n1907\n\nMarch 2: The Expatriation Act becomes law. It stipulates, in part, that a woman will lose her US citizenship if she marries a foreign man, since she thereby assumes the citizenship of her husband. There is no corresponding loss of citizenship when an American man marries a foreign woman.\n\nNovember 16: Oklahoma becomes a state, and women receive the right to vote in school elections only in the new state Constitution.\n\nDecember 31: Organized by Maud Malone of the Harlem Equal Rights League, the first open-air suffrage meeting is held in Madison Square Park, New York City.\n\n1908\n\nFebruary 16: Members of New York City’s Women’s Progressive Suffrage Union march from Union Square to the Manhattan Trade School. Denied a permit and despite police attempts to break them up, the Suffrage Union finishes their march.

The NAACP became an important organization in the fight for suffrage, both for women and for Black men in the South.\n\nFebruary 28: Women workers in New York City observe National Woman’s Day, in part demanding women’s right to vote. Now held on March 8, it is celebrated around the world as International Women’s Day.\n\nNovember 9: Alice Paul is arrested in London for smashing a window during a suffrage protest.
