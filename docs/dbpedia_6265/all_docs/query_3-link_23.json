        "text": "When Governors Seek Re-Election\n\nThe Center on the American Governor has found that across the country when modern incumbent governors have sought re-election, they have been successful over 74% of the time. Over the last 75 years, the rate has increased almost every decade – from an average of 68.26% between 1948 and 1979 to an average of 79.22% from 1980 through 2013 to an average of 89.5% since 2013. Since 2020, 39 of the 40 incumbents who have run for reelection have won.\n\nThe full data set, including year, incumbent name, challenger name and winner (26-page PDF) is available here.\n\nYears Incumbents Running Incumbents Winning Success Rate 1948-2023 668 498 74.55% 1948-1979 318 211 68.26% 1980-2013 255 202 79.22% 2014-2023 95 85 89.47%\n\nThe re-election success rate for incumbent governors has gone up almost every decade with the largest jumps occurring from 1980-1990 and from the 2000s to the 2010s and 2020s.\n\nDecade Incumbents Running Incumbents Winning Success Rate 1948-1959 128 85 66.41% 1960s 96 61 63.54% 1970s 94 65 69.15% 1980s 73 54 73.97% 1990s 89 72 80.90% 2000s 69 55 79.71% 2010s 79 67 84.81% 2020-2023 40 39 97.50%\n\nRe-election Rates by Region\n\nRegionally, governors seeking re-election have had the greatest success in the Northeast where, since 1948, 79.87% have won their races. In every region of the country, however, incumbents have been successful at a rate over 72%.\n\nRegion Incumbents Running Incumbents Winning Success Rate Northeast 154 123 79.87% South 157 115 73.25% Midwest 187 136 72.72% West 167 121 72.46%\n\nNote: Census Bureau designated regions have been used to define this chart.\n\nRe-election Rates by Gender\n\nSince 1970, 34 women have run for re-election as incumbent governors and 31 (91.12%) have been successful. Of these races, 30 took place in 1990 or later and 28 of them were successful; all 16 women who have run for reelection as governor since 2013 have won. A woman running for re-election as governor has not been defeated since Ann Richards (D-TX) lost to George W. Bush (R) in 1994.\n\nNote on Sources\n\nInformation on past governors is available at the National Governors Association Website, www.nga.org. Detailed election results from past campaigns are available at www.ourcampaigns.com. Many state archives also have websites with information about that state’s former governors.\n\nColin McDowell, a Rutgers University undergraduate assisting the Center on the American Governor as an Aresty Research Assistant in 2012 – 2013, was responsible for collecting and analyzing much of the data in this section. Rutgers undergraduates Seth Farina and Michelle Musheyev helped collect data to update the information."
