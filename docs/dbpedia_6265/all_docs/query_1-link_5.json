        "text": "Rhode Island was the last of the 13 original colonies to ratify the Constitution, entering the Union in May 1790. The state has been reliably Democratic since 1928, only voting Republican four times â€“ twice for Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, for Nixon in 1972, and for Reagan in 1984, when he won every state except Minnesota. In 2020, Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump by just over 20%.\n\nThe Ocean State has had four electoral votes since it first participated in 1792, except for the 1910s and 1920s when it had five. It has the most electoral votes proportional to size - one for every 303 square miles. Heading into the release of 2020 Census results, the state had been projected to lose an electoral vote. This did not occur."
