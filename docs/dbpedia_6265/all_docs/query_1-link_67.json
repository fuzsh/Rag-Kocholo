He was appointed by Gov. Nikki Haley to serve the remainder of Sen. Jim DeMint's term after he stepped down to become president of the Heritage Foundation.\n\nThis marked him the first Black senator and Black Republican to serve in the upper chamber since the 1970s. Scott also became the first Black senator from the South since Reconstruction.\n\nHe serves on several Senate Committees, including Finance and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Prior to being elected to the US Senate, Scott served on the Charleston City Council, the South Carolina House of Representatives, and represented South Carolina's 1st Congressional District in the US House.\n\nScott's name is routinely mentioned among those who could run for president, or be considered as a vice presidential candidate, in 2024.\n\nMatthews, Scott's challenger, was elected in 2018 to represent Berkeley and Charleston counties in the South Carolina House of Representatives. She ran for two seats this midterm cycle: US Senate and state house.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSouth Carolina's voting history\n\nThe state voted for then-President Donald Trump over Joe Biden by a margin of 12 percentage points in the 2020 election. South Carolina has voted Republican candidate since 1964, except in 1976 when it voted for fellow southerner Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe money race\n\nAccording to OpenSecrets, Scott raised $49.3 million, spent $31.8 million, and had $21.4 million cash on hand, as of October 19. His challenger, Matthews, raised $136,208, spent $89,183, and had $17,792 cash on hand, as of October 19.\n\nAs of late October, a dozen super PACs, national party committees, politically active nonprofits, and other non-candidate groups combined to spend about $3 million to advocate for or against candidates in this race, including during the race's primary phase. Most of this spending has benefitted Scott.\n\nWhat experts say"
