        "text": "WASHINGTON >> The Latest on Senate races in the 2020 election (all times local):\n\n2:55 a.m.\n\nDemocrat Mark Kelly has won the Arizona Senate seat once held by John McCain.\n\nThe former astronaut defeated Republican Sen. Martha McSally, who was appointed to the seat after McCain’s death in 2018.\n\nIt’s the second election night contest in which a Democrat beat a GOP incumbent. The other was in Colorado.\n\n1:55 a.m.\n\nRepublican Steve Daines of Montana has won a second Senate term, dealing a blow to Democrats’ hopes of gaining a majority in the chamber.\n\nThe former business executive and Donald Trump loyalist defeated Gov. Steve Bullock.\n\n1:25 a.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota has won reelection, defeating her Republican challenger, former U.S. Rep. Jason Lewis.\n\nThis is the second time in two years Smith has had to defend her seat. She was Gov. Mark Dayton’s lieutenant governor when he appointed her to the seat in 2017 after Democratic Sen. Al Franken resigned. Smith then won a special election in 2018 to complete Franken’s term.\n\n12:40 a.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Joni Ernst has won a second term in Iowa, fending off a competitive challenge from Des Moines real estate developer Theresa Greenfield.\n\nErnst argued that she had been true to her deeply conservative beliefs as both a state legislator and U.S. senator while also trying to portray herself as a senator who crossed party lines on some issues. Ernst serves in Republican leadership and has been an ardent supporter of President Donald Trump.\n\n12:30 a.m.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ben Ray Luján has won the Senate race in New Mexico to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Tom Udall.\n\nThe six-term congressman from northern New Mexico defeated Republican Mark Ronchetti, a former television meteorologist, and Libertarian Bob Walsh.\n\nLuján is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. His move to the Senate marks a resurgence of Latino political leadership in a state with the largest share of Hispanic residents.\n\n11:30 p.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith has been reelected in Mississippi, winning her first full term.\n\nIn a repeat of a 2018 special election, Hyde-Smith defeated Democrat Mike Espy as she tied herself closely to President Donald Trump. Hyde-Smith is the only woman to have represented Mississippi in the House or Senate.\n\n11:20 p.m.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Raphael Warnock have advanced to a Jan. 5 runoff in the special election for Loeffler’s Senate seat.\n\nThey’re the top two finishers in a crowded field that also included Republican Rep. Doug Collins. But no candidate was able to get the 50% threshold needed in order to win outright.\n\nLoeffler, a wealthy businesswoman, was appointed last year to replace retiring Sen. Johnny Isakson. Warnock is pastor of the Atlanta church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached. Warnock is trying to become Georgia’s first Black U.S. senator.\n\nRepublican Bill Cassidy has won a second term representing Louisiana in the Senate, avoiding a runoff. The lawmaker from Baton Rouge defeated 14 challengers, including Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins.\n\nDemocrats had hoped Perkins could stop Louisiana’s streak of sending Republicans to the Senate. But Cassidy had the power of incumbency, millions of dollars in campaign cash and the endorsement of President Donald Trump.\n\n11 p.m.\n\nRepublican Rep. Roger Marshall has won an open Senate seat in Kansas in a tougher-than-expected race that saw his Democratic opponent far outraise him.\n\nMarshall is an obstetrician who has represented western and central Kansas in Congress for two terms. He prevailed against Democratic state Sen. Barbara Bollier.\n\nDemocrat Jeff Merkley has won his third Senate term in Oregon.\n\nMerkley easily defeated Republican Jo Rae Perkins. She drew national headlines this year for her support of a wide ranging and baseless internet conspiracy theory QAnon.\n\nIdaho Republican Sen. Jim Risch has cruised to reelection, defeating Democrat challenger Paulette Jordan.\n\nRisch is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. Risch served in the Legislature before he was elected lieutenant governor in 2002 and senator in 2008.\n\n10:20 p.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas has defeated Democrat MJ Hegar in his hardest-fought reelection battle in almost two decades.\n\nCornyn held an edge in polls and fundraising for most of the race but was still forced into mounting an unusually aggressive defense as Democrats poured millions of dollars into Hegar’s race.\n\n10:15 p.m.\n\nFormer Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville has recaptured a Senate seat for Republicans by defeating Democratic Sen. Doug Jones in Alabama.\n\nJones had widely been considered the Senate’s most endangered Democrat, and Republicans had made winning the once reliably conservative seat a priority in 2020.\n\nTuberville has never held public office. He aligned himself closely with President Donald Trump and declared in the primary campaign that “God sent us” the president.\n\n10 p.m.\n\nRepublican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has secured a fourth term in the Senate, defeating Democrat Jamie Harrison.\n\nSome polling in the campaign’s closing weeks showed a head-to-head race, and Harrison’s massive fundraising broke records. But Graham mustered support across South Carolina, where all statewide offices are held by Republicans and support for President Donald Trump remains strong.\n\n9:45 p.m.\n\nDemocrat John Hickenlooper has defeated Republican Sen. Cory Gardner in Colorado. It’s the first seat that the Democrats have picked up on election night.\n\nColorado is a state that’s shifted strongly to the left since Gardner’s election to the Senate in 2014.\n\n9:05 p.m.\n\nRepublican Cynthia Lummis, a former congresswoman, has won an open Senate seat in Wyoming.\n\nLummis beat University of Wyoming ecology professor and climate activist Merav Ben-David to claim the seat held by Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, who’s retiring after four terms.\n\nLummis was heavily favored to win in the GOP-dominated state after raising and spending far more money than her Democratic opponent.\n\nNebraska Republican Ben Sasse has been reelected to the Senate, beating Democrat Chris Janicek.\n\nSasse, a former university president, benefitted from an overwhelming Republican advantage in Nebraska despite his criticism of President Donald Trump.\n\nRepublican Sen. Mike Rounds has won reelection to his second term in South Dakota.\n\nThe ex-governor defeated Democrat Dan Ahlers, a former state legislator.\n\n9 p.m.\n\nTwo more Republican senators have won reelection, and Republican Cynthia Lummis has won an open seat in Wyoming.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mike Rounds of South Dakota have easily won reelection.\n\nIn Wyoming, Republican Cynthia Lummis, a former congresswoman, defeated ecology professor and climate activist Merav Ben-David to replace Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, who’s retiring.\n\n8:30 p.m.\n\nRepublican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas has won reelection in a race that’s allowed him to lay the groundwork for a potential 2024 White House bid.\n\nThe 43-year-old Cotton has easily defeated Libertarian nominee Ricky Dale Harrington, a former prison chaplain who had never run for office. The only Democrat who was running against Cotton dropped out hours after the filing deadline last year.\n\nWith millions in campaign cash to spend, Cotton has run ads in presidential battleground states like Ohio and Michigan, and campaigned with endangered Senate GOP colleagues. He insisted the moves were intended to help President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans, and not about any future plans of his own.\n\n8:15 p.m.\n\nRepublican Bill Hagerty has won an open Senate seat in Tennessee, replacing retiring GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander.\n\nHagerty served as U.S. ambassador to Japan under President Donald Trump, and he rode the president’s endorsement to a win against Democrat Marquita Bradshaw.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware has defeated Republican challenger Lauren Witzke to win reelection.\n\nThe victory comes a decade after Coons won a special election to fill the Senate seat once held by Democrat Joe Biden. Since then Coons has voted solidly with Democrats while also seeking out ways to work across the aisle.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois has been reelected to a fifth term, handily winning over four lesser-known challengers.\n\nThe 75-year-old Durbin is the Senate’s second-highest ranking Democrat. He was first elected in 1996 and has been Democratic whip since 2005.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts fixture in Congress since the mid-1970s, has won reelection.\n\nMarkey easily defeated Republican challenger Kevin O’Connor to win a third term. The 74-year-old Markey has represented the state in Washington for decades — first in the House, starting in 1976, before winning John Kerry’s former Senate seat in 2013. After completing Kerry’s term, Markey won reelection in 2014.\n\nNew Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen has won a third term in the Senate, defeating Republican Corky Messner and Libertarian Justin O’Donnell.\n\nThe former governor has promoted her record of working across party lines to help small businesses during the coronavirus pandemic, secure funding to address the opioid crisis and improve veterans’ access to health care.\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Cory Booker has won a second full term in the Senate.\n\nBooker defeated Republican Rik Mehta, a business executive with a law degree and a doctorate in pharmacy.\n\nRepublican Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma has defeated Democrat Abby Broyles and three lesser-known candidates to secure another six-year term.\n\nThe 85-year-old Inhofe has been a fixture in Oklahoma politics for 50 years, having served in the state House, state Senate, as Tulsa’s mayor, and the U.S. House before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994.\n\nDemocrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island has easily defeated Republican challenger Allen Waters for a fifth Senate term.\n\nReed cruised to victory over Waters, an investment consultant who mounted earlier unsuccessful campaigns for state Senate and U.S. Senate in Massachusetts.\n\n8:05 p.m.\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has won a seventh term in Kentucky.\n\nThe 78-year-old McConnell defeated Democrat Amy McGrath, a retired Marine combat pilot who challenged him as a political outsider. McConnell is the longest-serving Republican leader in Senate history.\n\n8 p.m.\n\nSeven more senators have won reelection, and Republican Bill Hagerty has won an open seat in Tennessee.\n\nThe Democratic incumbents who won are Chris Coons of Delaware, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Jack Reed of Rhode Island. On the GOP side, James Inhofe of Oklahoma has also won reelection.\n\nIn Tennessee, businessman Hagerty defeated Democrat Marquita Bradshaw in a race to fill the seat of retiring Republican Lamar Alexander.\n\n7:30 p.m.\n\nShelley Moore Capito has become the first West Virginia Republican to be reelected to the Senate in more than a century.\n\nCapito defeated progressive Democrat Paula Jean Swearengin, a coal miner’s daughter who lacked statewide political experience.\n\n7 p.m.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia has won a third term.\n\nWarner defeated Republican challenger Daniel Gade in a low-key race in which the incumbent had a massive cash advantage. Democrats haven’t lost a statewide election in Virginia since 2009.\n\n5:15 p.m.\n\nSecuring a Senate majority will be crucial for whichever candidate wins the White House.\n\nSenators confirm administration nominees, including the Cabinet, and can propel or stall the White House agenda.\n\nWith Republicans now controlling the chamber, 53-47, three or four seats will determine party control, depending on who wins the presidency because the vice president can break a tie.\n\nRepublicans are fighting to hold on to their slim majority against Democratic candidates who are challenging President Donald Trump’s allies across a vast political map.\n\nBoth parties see paths to victory, but the outcome might not be known on election night.\n\nFrom New England to the Deep South and from the Midwest to the Mountain West, Republican incumbents are defending seats in states once considered long shots for Democrats.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is facing off against Democrat Amy McGrath, a former fighter pilot."
