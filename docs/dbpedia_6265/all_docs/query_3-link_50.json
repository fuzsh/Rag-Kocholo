        "text": "During the second year of President Richard Milhous Nixon’s (1913â1994) term, his handling of domestic issues led Herblock to pick up his ink pen and brush and express his opinion. He focused on the impact of inflation on the economy, the decline in school funding, and likened the oil industry’s stranglehold on the nation’s power supply to an octopus. The cartoonist derided the nation’s antiquated missile system. Finally, he reacted to an early report about pollution and global warming.\n\nMid-term elections led Herblock to address the irritation of negative television advertising and its effect on the political climate in the United States. He celebrated the inclusion of teenagersâsome of whom were eligible to serve in the Vietnamâin the election process. He noted the increasing role computers played in assessing public opinion. Finally, even though it was a mid-term election season, he felt that the Electoral College prevented the people from truly electing their president.\n\nThese ten cartoonsâwith new drawings introduced into the exhibition every six monthsâhave been selected from the Library’s extensive Herbert L. Block Collection in the Prints and Photographs Division.\n\nExhibition Dates: September 2020âMarch 2021\n\nOn view online only as all Library of Congress buildings and facilities were temporarily closed to the public due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDuring the second year of President Richard Milhous Nixon’s (1913â1994) term, his handling of both international and domestic issues led Herblock to pick up his ink pen and brush and express his opinion. Anti-crime legislation led him to imagine unwarranted investigations into people’s private lives, while he imagined consumers trapped by import quotas and trade restrictions. Herblock focused on the partisan nature of proposed Nixon administration welfare changes. With the famine in the Biafra region of Nigeria, Herblock fell back on the trope of death with its scythe. He used the capture of Angela Davis as an opportunity to opine about the gun lobby.\n\nOne of the leading issues of 1970 was the Vietnam War. The Nixon administration justified the invasion of Cambodia as a means to prevent further communist incursion into South Vietnam. Herblock, like many cartoonists, used the swamp as a metaphor for the mire in which not only the soldiers fighting the war but the politicians who controlled it found themselves.\n\nThese ten cartoonsâwith new drawings introduced into the exhibition every six monthsâhave been selected from the Library’s extensive Herbert L. Block Collection in the Prints and Photographs Division.\n\nExhibition dates: March 20, 2020–September 5, 2020"
