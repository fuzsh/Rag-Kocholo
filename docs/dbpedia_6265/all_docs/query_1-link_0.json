It took place on November 3, with the 33 seats of Class 1 contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. These races occurred in the middle of Richard Nixon's first term as president. The Democrats lost a net of three seats, while the Republicans and the Conservative Party of New York picked up one net seat each, and former Democrat Harry F. Byrd Jr. was re-elected as an independent.\n\nThis was the first time that Republicans gained Senate seats while losing House seats, which also occurred in 2018. This also occurred for Democrats in 1914, 1962, and 2022.[3]\n\nThis was the most recent election in which a third party won a seat in the Senate until 2006. As of 2024 , this is also the most recent cycle in which Democrats won Senate elections in Utah and Wyoming, and the most recent in which Republicans won a Senate election in Hawaii.\n\n↓ 54 1 1 44 Democratic I C Republican\n\nParties Total Democratic Republican Conservative Independent Other Last elections (1968) 58 42 0 0 0 100 Before these elections 57 43 0 0 0 100 Not up 32 33 — 0 — 65 Up 25 10 — — — 35 Class 1 (1964→1970) 25 8 — — — 33 Special: Class 2 0 1 — 0 — 1 Special: Class 3 0 1 — 0 — 1 Incumbent retired 3 1 — 0 — 4 Held by same party 2 1 — — — 3 Replaced by other party 1 Democrat replaced by 1 Republican — — — 1 Result 2 2 0 0 0 4 Incumbent ran 22[b][c] 9[c] — — — 31 Won re-election 17 6[d] — — — 23 Won re-election but changed party 1 Democrat re-elected as an Independent — 1 Lost re-election 2 Republicans replaced by 2 Democrats\n\n3 Democrats replaced by 3 Republicans\n\n1 Republican replaced by 1 Conservative — — 6 Lost renomination,\n\nbut held by same party 1 0 — — — 1 Result 20 9 1 1 0 31 Total elected 22 11 1 1 0 35 Net gain/loss 3 1 1 1 2 Nationwide vote 25,435,247 19,373,972[a] 2,183,572 516,149 1,049,884 48,558,824 Share 52.38% 39.90% 4.50% 1.06% 2.16% 100% Result 54 44 1 1 0 100\n\nSource: Office of the Clerk[1]\n\nPresident Nixon said that rather than violent protests, the best way for the American public to get their opinion heard was by voting:\n\nThe most powerful four letter word is a clean word, it’s the most powerful four letter word in the history of men, it's called vote. V-O-T-E. My friends, I say that the answer to those that engage in disruption, to those that shout their filthy slogans, to those that try to shout down speakers, it's not to answer in kind, but go to the polls in election day, and in the quiet of that ballot box, stand up and be counted, the great silent majority of America.\n\nOne Republican and three Democrats retired instead of seeking re-election.\n\nState Senator Replaced by Delaware Florida Minnesota Ohio\n\nOne Republican and four Democrats sought re-election but lost in the primary or general election.

Murphy's recent surgery and staunch support for the lingering Vietnam War worked against him, as did reports that he had continued to receive a salary from Technicolor after taking office.[10] Tunney's successful Senate race in 1970 was reportedly the inspiration for the 1972 Robert Redford film The Candidate.[11]\n\n1970 United States Senate election in California[1] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 618,941 9.54 Turnout 6,492,157 Democratic gain from Republican\n\nConnecticut election\n\n← 1964\n\n1976 →\n\nNominee Lowell P.

This was despite the state trending Democratic; Roth himself served most of his tenure with future President Joe Biden.\n\nFour-term Republican John J.

During the Democratic primary, former Governor C. Farris Bryant and State senator Lawton Chiles advanced to a run-off, having received more votes than Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives Frederick H. Schultz, attorney Alcee Hastings, and State Representative Joel T. Daves, III. Chiles soundly defeated Bryant in the run-off election, scoring a major upset due to his comparatively small name recognition prior to the election. To acquire name recognition and media coverage, Chiles walked about 1,003 miles (1,614 km) across the state of Florida and was given the nickname \"Walkin' Lawton\".\n\nThe Republican primary exposed an in-party feud between Governor Claude R. Kirk Jr. and U.S. Representative William C. Cramer. In the election, Cramer handily defeated G. Harrold Carswell and body shop owner George Balmer; the former was a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judge favored by Kirk and had been rejected as a Supreme Court of the United States nominee a few months prior to the primary. Chiles won the election by a relatively small margin of 7.8%, receiving 902,438 votes against Cramer's 772,817 votes.\n\nIncumbent Spessard Holland, who served in the Senate since 1946, decided to retire rather than seek a fifth term.[13] Although the Democratic Party had dominated state elections since the Reconstruction Era, Claude R. Kirk Jr. and Edward Gurney, both Republicans, were elected senator and Governor in 1966 and 1968, respectively.[14]\n\nDemocratic Party primary results[15] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 730,154 100.00\n\nDemocratic Party primary runoff results[15] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 721,631 100.00\n\nRepublican Primary results[15] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 352,781 100.00\n\n1970 United States Senate election in Florida[1] Party Candidate Votes % Majority 129,621 7.74 −20.17% Turnout 1,675,255 [?] [?] Democratic hold Swing\n\n1970 United States Senate election in Hawaii\n\n← 1964\n\n1976 →\n\nNominee Hiram Fong Cec Heftel Party Republican Democratic Popular vote 124,163 116,597 Percentage 51.57% 48.43%\n\nFong: 50–60%\n\nU.S. senator before election\n\nHiram Fong\n\nRepublican\n\nElected U.S. senator\n\nHiram Fong\n\nRepublican\n\nRepublican Hiram Fong had served as the inaugural Class 1 senator from the state of Hawaii since 1959.

Fong initially won election to each of his first two terms with 53% of the vote, but in 1970 he faced backlash from voters for his support of the Vietnam War. Cecil Heftel, owner of a radio conglomerate, won the Democratic nomination.\n\nFong was narrowly re-elected over Heftel with 52% of the vote in what would prove to be the closest election of his career.

Unlike voters in Hawaii, Indiana voters generally supported the Vietnam War, but Hartke opposed the war. This led Roudebush to run a close race that ultimately was decided after a recount.

This was Kennedy's first election run since the 1969 Chappaquiddick incident. Kennedy won 62.2%, down from 74.3% that he won in the previous election in 1964; this decrease was due to numerous factors including Chappaquiddick and a far more favorable environment for the Republicans than the Democratic landslide year of 1964.\n\nThe Republican nominee was Josiah Spaulding, a businessman and Republican leader in Massachusetts. He led a group of delegates at the 1968 Republican National Convention who unsuccessfully sought to nominate Nelson A. Rockefeller over Richard Nixon.[17]\n\nOther candidates were Lawrence Gilfedder (Socialist Labor) and Mark R. Shaw (Prohibition), a former Prohibition Party candidate for U.S. senator from Massachusetts in 1946, 1952, 1958, 1969, 1962, and 1966.
