The 80th Disney Channel Original Movie (DCOM), the film is the sequel to Camp Rock (2008) and stars Demi Lovato, The Jonas Brothers, Maria Canals-Barrera, Meaghan Martin, and Alyson Stoner. In the film, Camp Star, an upstart rival summer music camp, makes Camp Rock's existence uncertain.\n\nThe film premiered on Disney Channel on September 3, 2010 ( ).[1] It was the last sequel of a DCOM film, until Teen Beach 2 (2015).\n\nPlot[edit]\n\nMitchie Torres and her mother, Connie, return to Camp Rock for another summer. They see a new camp, Camp Star, has opened across from them and Mitchie and her friends notice there are fewer campers at Camp Rock. After Opening Jam, the camp's meet-and-greet, Camp Star send snacks to Camp Rock and invite them to their upcoming bonfire event that night. Brown Cesario, Camp Rock's director, is hesitant to attend as Camp Star was founded by Axel Turner, whom Cesario kicked out of his band years ago.\n\nMost of Camp Rock attend at Mitchie's behest and they soon realize the bonfire was to set up an expensive, elaborate performance to entice their campers and counselors to join Camp Star; while few campers join (including Tess Tyler), several counselors make the switch. With minimal staff, Brown announces the closure of camp but Mitchie and her friends persuade him to keep it open after assuming roles as counselors. Meanwhile, during the performance, Axel's daughter, Dana, has her bracelet come loose from her hand and hit Nate Gray; after returning the bracelet, they begin to bond, but Dana is dismayed at Nate's nonchalance.\n\nMitchie and her friends initially struggle to settle into their role as counselors. Upset at being blindsided during their visit, they revisit Camp Star, who are shown to solely prioritize practicing music, with no space for other activities. Axel suggests broadcasting a competition between the camps on television, with the winner decided by a public vote; although reluctant, Mitchie agrees at the urging of her friends. This angers Brown, and Mitchie overhears him tell Connie that if Camp Rock were to lose, it could result in the permanent closure of the camp.\n\nMitchie urges focus on winning the competition, which frustrates other campers and Shane Gray, Mitchie's boyfriend, who returned to Camp Rock to spend time with her. Dismayed at this strict performance-oriented nature of camp, Shane and the other counselors organize a water balloon fight to improve the campers' spirits; this angers Mitchie, and she and Shane argue. The next day, Mitchie finds everyone rehearsing for the competition, led by Shane, and they reconcile. Meanwhile, Nate sneaks into Camp Star to express his feelings to Dana and is caught by Axel.\n\nAs the competition, Brown finds out Axel has spent exorbitant sums to ensure voting for Camp Star is easier than voting for Camp Rock. Camp Rock performs, accompanied by a video montage of camp activities, but Camp Star wins the competition. Mitchie apologizes to Shane about not spending enough time with him and they kiss. At the final Camp Rock bonfire of the summer, many members of Camp Star, including Tess and Dana, opt to join Camp Rock, impressed at the camp's culture. This ensures enough campers for another summer.\n\nCast[edit]\n\nDemi Lovato as Mitchie Torres, a young girl aspiring to be a singer, now returning for her second year at Camp Rock.\n\nJoe Jonas as Shane Gray, the lead singer of the band Connect 3 and Mitchie's love interest.\n\nNick Jonas as Nate Gray, a member of the band Connect 3.\n\nKevin Jonas as Jason Gray, a member of the band Connect 3.\n\nAlyson Stoner as Caitlyn Gellar, a Camp Rock attendee and Mitchie's friend.\n\nAnna Maria Perez de Tagle as Ella Pador, a Camp Rock attendee and Mitchie's friend.\n\nJasmine Richards as Margaret \"Peggy\" Dupree, a Camp Rock attendee and Mitchie's friend.\n\nRoshon Fegan as Sander Loyer, a Camp Rock attendee.\n\nJordan Francis as Barron \"Barry\" James, a Camp Rock attendee.\n\nDaniel Fathers as Brown Cesario, Camp Rock's camp director.\n\nDaniel Kash as Axel Turner, Camp Star's founder and Brown's ex-bandmate.\n\nMatthew \"Mdot\" Finley as Luke Williams, the lead singer of Camp Star.\n\nMeaghan Martin as Tess Tyler, Mitchie's nemesis from the previous film, who later turns friend.\n\nChloe Bridges as Dana Turner, Axel's daughter and Nate's love interest.\n\nMaria Canals-Barrera as Connie Torres, Mitchie's mother.\n\nArisa Cox as Georgina Farlow, the host of Hitz TV, the television network covering Camp Wars.\n\nProduction[edit]\n\nThe film was shot in Ontario from September 3 to October 16, 2009, filming the scenes at Kilcoo Camp in Minden Hills, French River, The Kingbridge Centre in King City, and Earl Bales Park in Toronto.[2]\n\nSoundtrack[edit]\n\nReception[edit]\n\nCritical response[edit]\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 63% based on 5 reviews and an average of 6.1/10.[3] Jennifer Armstrong from Entertainment Weekly enjoyed the film and called the performance of Demi Lovato \"dependently appealing\".[4]\n\nRatings[edit]\n\nThe film garnered 7.9 million viewers on its premiere night, the most for a movie on cable television in 2010 and the most any cable program that week (August 30 - September 5).[5] The movie was also simulcast on Radio Disney, similar to the first installment of the franchise, but it is unknown if the ratings included the Radio Disney audience.\n\nHome media[edit]\n\nThe film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on September 7, 2010, in the United States and Canada and was later available worldwide.
