        "text": "While they attempted to get as many points as possible without singing their own songs, a few hits did fall into the mix, including \"Lovebug,\" a longtime fan favorite. \"It's been around in our discography for over 15 years and we don't get tired of playing it,\" said Nick, who recently had date night with Priyanka Chopra at the Met Gala. Without missing a beat, Joe added, \"We love that one.\"\n\nAs the trio sifted through their mental music catalogues, they sent us back in time with some of the biggest songs from the 2000s, including \"So Sick\" by Ne-Yo, \"Party Rock Anthem\" by LMFAO, and \"Talk Dirty\" by Jason Derulo. They even slipped in a few major hits like \"Toxic\" by Britney Spears, \"Gone\" by *NSYNC,\" and \"A Moment Like This\" by Kelly Clarkson.\n\nBetween coming up with songs and teasing each other for singing off-key, the Jonas Brothers's unmistakable sibling chemistry sent us right back to their Disney Channel days. \"Working with your brothers has to be fun and hilarious at the same time,\" one YouTube commenter observed. \"Between Nick reminding them they're a team, Joe's diva moments, and Kevin signing out of key (according to Nick) [it's] great. I love them.\"\n\nOne song isn't quite the \"Camp Rock 3\" reunion we were promised (no, we haven't forgotten), but it certainly has us reliving the days when finding love was as easy as going to rock 'n' roll summer camp. Plus, with the new Jonas Brothers tour kicking off in New York on Aug. 12, fans can expect to hear a medley of the brothers' discography, so a live \"Play My Music\" performance might be right around the corner."
