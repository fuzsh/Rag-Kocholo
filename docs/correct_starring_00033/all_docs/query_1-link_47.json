He rose to fame as a member of the pop rock band the Jonas Brothers, alongside his brothers Joe and Nick. The group released their debut studio album It's About Time through the Columbia label in 2006, which failed to achieve commercial success. After signing with Hollywood Records, the group released their self-titled second studio album in 2007, which became their breakthrough record."
