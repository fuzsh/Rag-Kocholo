        "text": "An aspiring musician, Mitchie (Demi Lovato) joins a prestigious rock music summer camp and longs to be accepted by the popular clique.\n\nThis is a film that I never watched first time around, primarily due to being not really all that interested in rock music or the plot of the film itself. I may even have aged out of it by that point. However, in 2020 I watched reviews of the film. While I think this film is not particularly good in any way, the reviews were hilarious and I knew I couldn’t pass up the chance to review this film and its sequel (the blogpost for that will come later).\n\nThis film was a star vehicle for Demi Lovato and the Jonas Brothers, which makes sense as they take front and centre in this film. I’m also keeping in mind that I’m trying to review the film from the POV of my teenaged self and whether or not she would have liked it, as clearly this film isn’t for my demographic although given the dated pop music it references it forced me to question whether this film was for teenagers or the parents. The music is also fine I suppose, although some of the dubbing was distracting and overdone in places.\n\nThe acting is mostly wooden and while Demi Lovato tries to do a good job with what they are given, Joe Jonas in the role of Shane Grey, the moody pop star who eventually becomes her love interest, is wooden and there is zero chemistry between the pair. Jonas comes across most of the time like a moody petulant child rather than a talented artist with a soul. This film is also written to be funny however the jokes don’t ‘land’ well so the humour just feels really hollow, or they’re victims of a bland delivery so the humour isn’t there.\n\nThe villains of the story, while clearly central to the plot, just feel hollow and wooden. I was half expecting someone to twirl their moustache or tie someone to train tracks. All characters are pretty much just stereotypes but then again considering its a kids’ film its to be expected, and yet again I’m not sure about the realism of one despotic teenager running the whole camp, but then again perhaps I’m reaching too high in my perceptions.\n\nThe choreography in the scenes is also hilarious – I swear I could hear Jonas’s tight trousers scream for release as he gyrated across the dance floor. The convoluted story about Mitchie’s identity being revealed felt unrealistic as surely Shane Grey would be able to identify them much sooner due to their singing voice and face.\n\nPerhaps I’m being cynical but I didn’t enjoy this, and I think if I’d watched it back then my feelings would have been the same. That being said, it does identify that teenagers can feel a significant struggle to fit in but its done so listlessly that its not really that effective. While it does encourage people to be themselves, to put it simply this film was dull.\n\nMY RATING: *.5 / *****\n\n(Update: May 2021 – Demi Lovato has recently come out as non binary and I’ve changed this blogpost to reflect that.)"
