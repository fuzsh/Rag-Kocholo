        "text": "If you grew up in the 2000s, then you probably remember the Jonas Brothers’ music being played on Disney Channel and on their radio station. “Year 3000” was their iconic hit single in 2006 (they still play it!). Kevin, Joe, and Nick Jonas starred and then starred in Disney Channel’s Camp Rock (2008) and its 2010 sequel. They also had their own Disney Channel Television series at the same time, Jonas, which ran for two seasons from 2009-2010.\n\nAfter a hiatus as a group between 2010 and 2011 to pursue solo projects, the boys reunited in 2012 to record a new album. It was ultimately canceled following their break-up in 2013. Six long years later, the group reunited with the release of “Sucker” in 2019. The song became the band’s first number-one song and the first number-one by a boy band on the Billboard Hot 100 chart since 2003’s “Bump, Bump, Bump” by B2K. Kevin, Joe, and Nick all got married during this time. Now, all three of the brothers have children with their wives.\n\nThe Albums\n\nWith six studio albums under their belt, the Jo Bros are about to embark on their 35-date North American tour from August 12 until October 16. Their newest record, The Album, will be the main feature of their tour, along with songs from their self-titled 2007 album, 2008’s A Little Bit Longer, 2009’s Lines, Vines and Trying Times, and 2019’s Happiness Begins. They don’t include their 2006 debut studio album, It’s About Time but will be performing their fan-favorite “Year 3000” from the album.\n\nIn a recent interview, the Jonas Brothers were asked to rank their six albums. Joe’s rankings were: 1. The Album, 2. Happiness Begins, 3. A Little Bit Longer, 4. Jonas Brothers, and 5. Lines, Vines and Trying Times. Nick’s choices were similar, ranking The Album as no. 1, A Little Bit Longer in second, Happiness Begins in third, and the fourth and fifth picks are the same as Joe’s. Kevin’s choices were completely different, besides everyone ranking The Album as the top spot and Jonas Brothers coming in second. His full answer gets cut off as his brothers heckle him for listening to their music while sitting on the toilet watching The Office simultaneously.\n\nSee below the funniest videos the Jonas Brothers have posted on social media:"
