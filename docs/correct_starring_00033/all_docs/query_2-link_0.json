        "text": "Paul Kevin Jonas II or Paul Kevin Jonas Jr. (born Thursday, November 5, 1987, in Teaneck, New Jersey), also known as Kevin Jonas and K2, is an American musician and actor. He was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, and grew up in Wyckoff. He is of Irish, Italian, Cherokee, and German descent. He is a member of the Jonas Brothers, a pop-rock band he created with his younger brothers Joe and Nick. The Jonas Brothers originally started with a solo singing career for Nick Jonas, but when Joe Jonas and Kevin sang backup for him, the record producer liked their sound and signed all three of them.\n\nIn 2008, he appeared in People magazine's list of the Sexiest Men Alive.\n\nHe married Danielle Delsea, a former hairdresser, at Oheka Castle on December 9, 2009. Jonas met Delsea in the Bahamas in the summer of 2007. They have a Yorkshire Terrier puppy named Riley.\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nKevin Jonas was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, and grew up in Wyckoff, New Jersey. His mother, Denise (born Miller), is a former sign language teacher and singer, and his father, Paul Kevin Jonas, Sr., is a songwriter, musician, and former ordained minister at an Assemblies of God. He is of Italian (from a great-grandfather), German, Irish, English, Cherokee, and French-Canadian descent. He has three younger brothers, Joe (born 1989), Nick (born 1992) and Frankie (born 2000).\n\nCareer[]\n\nMusic[]\n\nIn early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. After hearing the song \"Please Be Mine\", written and performed by all the brothers, Daylight/Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group activity. After being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers\".\n\nIt's About Time, the brothers' first album, was released on August 8, 2006. According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of a little over 50,000 copies. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels. The band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.\n\nAfter shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007. Around the same time, the brothers began appearing in GAP commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle. Their self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007. It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008, and peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nOn June 16, 2009, the brothers' fourth studio album, and third release under Hollywood Records, entitled Lines, Vines, and Trying Times was released. The album peaked at number 1 on the Billboard 200 with 247,000 copies sold. It was announced on May 1, 2012, that the Jonas Brothers parted ways with their record label Hollywood Records, and bought the rights to their music.\n\nReunion[]\n\nOn February 28, 2019, the Jonas Brothers announced via social media that they were reuniting. They released their first new song on March 1 titled \"Sucker\".\n\nKevin Jonas is the only Jonas Brother who doesn't sing.\n\nActing[]\n\nOn August 17, 2007, Jonas and his brothers guest-starred in an episode of Hannah Montana entitled Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas.
