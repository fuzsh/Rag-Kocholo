        "text": "The year was 2008, and Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas, and Kevin Jonas — erm, Mitchie, Shane, Jason, and Nate — were spending their summer at Camp Rock. They fell in love, sang songs that have been stuck in our heads for a full decade, and stole the hearts of Disney fans everywhere.\n\nIt's hard to believe we're now celebrating the 10th anniversary of the film (and that Demi and the Jonases are just as much a part of our lives as they were then). If that has you feeling nostalgic, you're not the only one. On Wednesday, some of the movie's stars took to Twitter to share their thoughts on the milestone.\n\n\"10 years of Camp Rock and I’m still bitter we lost,\" Joe wrote. When a fan named Dani reminded him that the \"loss\" he was referring to actually happened in Camp Rock 2, he followed up by saying, \"I know Dani. But Shane Grey never forgets where he came from #stillbitter #theogmrgreywillseeyounow.\" That is some hashtag.\n\nJoe's brother Kevin had similar sentiments and tweeted a photo of the movie's promo poster. \"#10YearsOfCampRock well that went by quick!\" he wrote, then wondered, \"What was I doing with my hair....\"\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAs for whether or not there could ever be a third installment of the iconic Disney Channel Original Movie in fans' futures? \"Never say never,\" Kevin told E! News in an interview last week. \"We talked about doing something ridiculous, like an R-rated version, like now in our life going back to camp kind of thing. But, nothing really moving from there. But at the same time I would definitely consider it, it just has to be the right thing. I can't believe 10 years has actually passed. It makes me feel like I'm getting old.\"\n\nJoe echoed these sentiments last year, noting that he, too, would be on board. \"If it made sense, sure. For all of us — Demi, Nick, it would be funny to do a spin on it,\" he told Marie Claire. \"Do the graduating days, make it kind of dark. An adult film. Well, not an adult film. An R-rated film. We've joked around about the idea a couple times.\"\n\nConsidering Demi and the Jonas brothers have stayed in close touch over the past decade — and that she still remembers all of the words to the Camp Rock soundtrack — truly anything is possible.\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.\n\nWant more from Teen Vogue?
