        "text": "Paul Kevin Jonas II (born November 5, 1987), also known as Kevin Jonas and K2, is an American musician and actor. He is a member of the Jonas Brothers, a pop rock band he created with his younger brothers Joe and Nick.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers originally started with a solo singing career for Nick, but when Joe and Kevin sang backup for him, the record producer liked their sound and signed all three of them. He currently stars in the Disney Channel original series JONAS as Kevin Lucas, along side his brothers Nick and Joe.\n\nCareer[]\n\nSinging[]\n\nKevin was discovered through his brother. In early 2005, Columbia Records' new president, Steve Greenberg, listened to Nick's record. While Greenberg did not like the album, he did like Nick's voice. After hearing the song, \"Please Be Mine\", written and performed by all the brothers, Daylight/Columbia Records decided to sign the three as a group act.\n\nAfter being signed to Columbia, the brothers considered naming their group \"Sons of Jonas\" before settling on the name \"Jonas Brothers\".[1]\n\nIt's About Time, the brothers' first album, was released on August 8, 2006.[2] According to the band's manager, it was only a \"limited release\" of a little over 50,000 copies. Because Sony was not interested in further promoting the band, the Jonas Brothers then considered switching labels. The band was ultimately dropped by Columbia Records in early 2007.\n\nAfter shortly being without a label, the Jonas Brothers signed with Hollywood Records in February 2007.[3][4] Around the same time, the brothers began appearing in commercials for Baby Bottle Pops, singing the jingle.[4] Their self-titled second album, Jonas Brothers, was released on August 7, 2007.[5] It reached number five on the Billboard Hot 200 chart in its first week.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers' third studio album, A Little Bit Longer, was released in the United States on August 12, 2008 and peaked at #1 on the Billboard 200.[6]\n\nActing[]\n\nOn August 17, 2007, Kevin, along with his brothers, guest starred in an episode of Hannah Montana. The episode debuted alongside High School Musical 2 and a sneak peek of the new Disney Channel show Phineas and Ferb.[7] The episode broke basic cable records with a record 10.7 million viewers and became basic cable's most watched series telecast ever.[8]\n\nKevin and his brothers filmed a Disney Channel Original Movie called Camp Rock where they play a band called \"Connect Three\". Kevin plays the role of \"Jason,\" a guitarist; Nick plays the role of \"Nate,\" also a guitarist; and Joe plays the lead male role and lead singer \"Shane Gray\". A soundtrack for the movie was released on June 17, 2008. The movie premiered on June 20 in the USA on Disney Channel, and Canada on Family.\n\nThe Disney Channel reality short series, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream, premiered on Disney Channel on May 16, 2008. The show, which ran until September 5, 2008, documented the brothers' lives on the Look Me in the Eyes Tour. The name was inspired by their hit song When You Look Me in the Eyes.\n\nHe and his brothers -- Joe, Nick and Frankie -- will be starring in their own Disney Channel Original Series called J.O.N.A.S., which they are currently filming.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nJonas was born in Teaneck, New Jersey, the son of Denise, a former sign language teacher and singer, and Paul Kevin Jonas, Sr., a songwriter, musician and former ordained minister at a Pentecostal Assemblies of God church.[9][10][11] He is of Italian, Irish, German, and Cherokee Indian descent [12].\n\nTemplate:Main article The Jonases are known for their wholesome, \"family-friendly\" image,[citation needed] and the brothers are all committed Evangelical Christians. Their father is a former Assembly of God pastor, and they were homeschooled by their mother. In addition, to signify their vow to abstain from premarital sex, on their left-hand ring finger they all wear purity rings. Joe has said that the rings symbolize \"a promise to ourselves and to God that we'll stay pure till marriage,\" and Nick had stated that \"it's purity rings pretty awesome, and the rings are just one of our ways of kind of like being different than everybody else out there.\" They reportedly started wearing the rings when their parents, Denise and Kevin Sr., asked them if they wanted to.[13] They also reportedly abstain from alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.[14]\n\nJonas was chosen by People magazine as one of the sexiest men alive in their 2008 edition of the series.[15]\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm Year Film Role Notes 2008 Best of Both Worlds Concert Himself 3D Concert film Camp Rock Jason Made for television 2009 Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience Himself 3D Concert film Band in a Bus Himself Reality DVD Television Year Title Role Notes 2008 Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream Himself Reality series 2009 JONAS Kevin Lucas Now Playing on Disney Channel Guest appearances Year Title Role Notes 2007 Hannah Montana Himself \"Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas\" (Season 2, Episode 16) 2008 Disney Channel Games 2008 Himself Third annual Studio DC: Almost Live Himself Second show Extreme Makeover: Home Edition Himself \"The Akers Family\" (Season 6, Episode 2) Disney Channel's Totally New Year 2008 Himself Disney Channel special New Years event 2009 Saturday Night Live Himself February 14th, 2009 episode\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
