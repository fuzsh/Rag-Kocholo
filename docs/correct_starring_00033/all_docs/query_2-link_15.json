        "text": "The American soft-rock band the Jonas Brothers was noted for its combination of optimism, catchy tunes, and cover-boy good looks. The three real-life brothers were popular with preteen and young teen audiences.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers members were Paul Kevin Jonas II (November 5, 1987, Teaneck, New Jersey), Joseph Adam Jonas (August 15, 1989, Casa Grande, Arizona), and Nicholas Jerry Jonas (September 16, 1992, Dallas, Texas). They were raised in a musical family in New Jersey and grew up with a strong sense of Christian values; their father was an Assembly of God minister. Nick began performing on Broadway when he was six years old. In 2004 he released a Christian-themed solo album. The pleasure of making music together prompted the brothers to form a band, with Kevin and Nick on guitar (with keyboard work mixed in) and Nick and Joe sharing lead vocals. Their first album, It’s About Time (2006), was given only a limited marketing push. Although the album sold 62,000 copies, the label dropped the band.\n\nEarly in 2007 the Jonas Brothers signed with Disney’s Hollywood Records. The group released a self-titled album that entered the charts at number five and, propelled by hits such as “S.O.S.,” went platinum. The brothers also began appearing regularly on the Disney Channel, most notably as guests on a 2007 episode of Hannah Montana, starring Miley Cyrus. The Jonas Brothers then opened for Cyrus on her “Best of Both Worlds” tour. Their music videos became Disney Channel staples, and they starred in a reality program, Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream.\n\nThe trio’s real breakthrough, however, followed their appearance in the Disney movie musical Camp Rock (2008), in which Joe played the romantic lead. About the same time the brothers became a pop-culture phenomenon with the release of A Little Bit Longer, which featured many songs written by Nick. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Later that year the brothers began their own tour, which was filmed for the documentary Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience (2009). In July 2008 they appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine.\n\nLess than a year after A Little Bit Longer, the group released the album Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), which offered a more mature sound. Nick then recorded a soul-influenced solo effort, Who I Am (2010), under the name Nick Jonas and the Administration. In 2009–10 the Jonas brothers starred in a new Disney series, JONAS (later JONAS L.A.). The half-hour show featured Kevin, Nick, and Joe portraying pop stars who are also high school students. They also appeared in Camp Rock 2: The Final Jam (2010).\n\nThe band subsequently went on hiatus, and the brothers focused on side projects. Nick took several acting roles, and Joe released the solo album Fastlife (2011). The reality show Married to Jonas, starring Kevin and his wife, Danielle, aired in 2012–13. In October 2012 the brothers performed a reunion concert, and they subsequently staged a world tour in 2012–13. A new single, “Pom Poms,” was released in April 2013, as the lead single from the planned fifth studio album, V. A tour was scheduled to start later that year, but it was canceled shortly before the first show. In October 2013 the brothers announced that the band had broken up."
