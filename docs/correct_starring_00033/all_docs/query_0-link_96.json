When she's overheard singing, but not seen, by celebrity camp instructor and lead singer of Connect Three, Shane Gray (Joe Jonas), he is completely taken and sets out to find the girl behind the beautiful voice. Meanwhile, Mitchie will have to confront her fears, and step out of the kitchen and into the spotlight.\n\nMain Characters\n\nMitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) - More than anything, Mitchie wants to go to Camp Rock, but her family has never been able to afford it.
