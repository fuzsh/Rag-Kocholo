        "text": "OMJ! You die-hard Jonas Brothers fans know exactly what I mean. And last night was one OMJ moment after another at the premiere of Camp Rock at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City. Now this is one of those theaters that I've really only gone to for theatrical movie premieres. Like, last time I was there, I was sitting a few rows in front of Adam Sandler, so the fact that a TV movie was doing a mega-sized premiere there was kinda a big deal. But would you expect anything less from the JoBros?\n\nBefore I even got there, I could hear the screams a block away. By the time I walked by the white carpet (yup, not red!), I saw the Camp Rock stars working their way down through the cameras and reporters...Demi Lovato, Anna Maria Perez de Tagle, and of course, Nick, Kevin, and Joe Jonas. So I put on my supercool guest pass shaped like a guitar pick and went inside the theater. The usher sent us down the wrong aisle and by the time they realized that and turned us around, everyone was already seated. I found myself looking out into the sea of faces, and right in the middle was the Camp Rock cast--crazy! So we finally made it into the right seats and the lights dimmed. It felt so much like a concert that I found myself bursting into screams and applauses after every musical number. Unlike a High School Musical style musical, the music is actually integrated into the movie, so it totally feels like you're rocking out right there with them.\n\nThe break out star? Hmmm... it's hard to say. Demi stepped into the lead role like a true star, Jasmine Richards wowed everyone with her voice, Meaghan Jette Martin was so nasty that I fell in love with her evilness, my longtime favorite Alyson Stoner showed her superstar spunk, Kevin Jonas played his dingy character so perfectly that you can't help but burst out laughing at every line, and Nick Jonas looks like he was born to be on screen. But for me, it was Joe Jonas who totally blew me away. I couldn't believe this was his acting debut. He's a total pro and has the chops to segue into a movie star career... he really sold his jerk of a character who then opens up to show his sensitive side. As I told Papa Jonas later on, his triple threats are triple threats.\n\nAfterwards, we headed across the street to Remi for a totally rockin' camp out party. We're talking roasted marshmallows, hot dogs with the works, and some sort of mixed-up juice called Bug Juice that was so tasty. Heck, I even got to make a beaded key chain! My summer camp sure wasn't like this... and I sure didn't have Demi performing a mini concert and then the Jonas Brothers joining her on stage.\n\nHours later, when we figured most stars would have made their appearance and been long gone, we spotted the JoBros in a VIP room. As soon as we got in there, it was hugs galore. One of the things I love about them is that even though I'm sure they hear compliments left and right every day, it was like they were really truly listening and absorbing every word I said. Like, I was telling Joe how he's such a movie star and how natural he was in the movie...and he was just listening so intently and taking it in. Such good guys. And love that little brother Frankie was in there drawing mustaches and defacing a Camp Rock poster. Ha! Too cute!\n\nSo I had noticed they had been reading something right before we first made eye contact. What was it? None other than the CosmoGirl Extra on the Jonas Brothers (on stands June 17). So I gave them a couple more copies and they dove right into the \"Celebrity Fan Club\" story on page 62. I talked to a few other people and when I turned around a good five minutes later, I caught Joe standing off to the side still reading it... yup it's that good that Joe would read it in the middle of his own premiere party. So you guys all have to go out and buy it next week, especially now that it's sealed with the Jonas stamp of approval!\n\nWhew, what an adventure. What do you guys think of the Camp Rock clips so far? Don't forget to tune in on June 20 at 8 p.m. to Disney Channel and let us know what you think. And of course, don't forget to pick up the CosmoGirl Extra on the JBs on June 17.\n\nCan't wait to hear from you!\n\nRachel\n\nEntertainment Editor"
