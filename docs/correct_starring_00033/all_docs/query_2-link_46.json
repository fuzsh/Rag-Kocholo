        "text": "By Chase Hensing\n\nThe Jonas brothers were viewed as international icons throughout many of our childhoods lives. They were in some of Disney’s biggest movies and TV shows, such as the Camp Rock series, along with being one of the biggest boy bands of the early 2000s. In 2013 the band announced that they would be splitting up. However on February 28 2019 the group announced their comeback and took took the internet by storm.\n\nAt midnight on February 28th, the group dropped their comeback single “Sucker”. The surprise song release had many fans excited about the group releasing music so quickly. Glenelg Sophomore Katie Ringer said, “I was just scrolling through Instagram one day and I saw that they were making a comeback. I was so excited when I heard the song, it reminded me of one of their old hits but it also had a twist of a modern hit.” The song, has taken over the music world so far by becoming a chart topper within the first 24 hours of release and gaining 9 million views on YouTube. Glenelg Sophomore Gavin Cronkite said, “I like how the band came back, I watched their TV show, movies, and listened to their songs. The band was a big part of my childhood i’m excited to see how the band will adapt to the new music culture and more grown fans than they had before.” The band also excited fans when they hinted at a tour late in 2019, needless to say fans are thrilled looking forward to the up and coming months.\n\n​\n\nWhat could be the band’s most controversial change after their comeback is switching the lead from Joe Jonas to Nick Jonas. This difference has some people happy and excited for the new beginnings, but many do not like how things have been altered. For instance, Glenelg Sophomore Emma Veseshta said, “I like the change. Nick was always my favorite from when I was young and more recently when he released his own songs. I just think he is the most talented.” However, Glenelg Sophomore Maya Patel said, “I think Joe should be the lead and center of attention just as before, it just doesn't feel right having Joe anywhere else except for the front.” We will see if the band adjusts to the criticism or praises the fans for accepting the change in the future.\n\nAfter the band broke up the brothers all went their separate ways, Kevin Jonas (31) became a father, Joe Jonas (29) got engaged, and Nick Jonas (26) had a wedding attracting the eyes of all parts of the media. Other than personal life matters, the three brothers split to pursue their other interests. Nick launched a solo career that went very well, with songs such as “Jealous”, “Chains”, and “Close” topping charts worldwide. Joe started his own band called DNCE, which put out the hit song “Cake by the Ocean”. Kevin became the Co-CEO of the Blu Market Company, which deals with communications and plans for social media influencers. But the band felt that after splitting for six years apart, it was time to return to the spotlight: The brothers said, “We were burning up trying to keep this a secret” on social media referencing their most popular song “Burnin’ Up”.\n\nThe last piece of news that the band released to the public: they are working on a documentary with Amazon that will cover the process of them reuniting. The documentary will be all about the Jonas family’s emotions and ideas regarding comeback. It will have old home videos talking about the hardships the family had faced when the sons were gone. The documentary will also focus on how they pulled off the comeback and how everyone in their family is feeling about it. The documentary is set to be released at the end of summer; fans have much to look forward to.\n\nThe Jonas Brothers comeback might be the hottest thing so far in 2019. However with the bands come back it will be important to see if they can live up to the legacy they left behind in 2013, and if they will be able to compete well with other bands in the modern music industry. The band seems to be off to a good start with the song “Sucker”, but we are waiting for them to release more music so that we can make our final judgements."
