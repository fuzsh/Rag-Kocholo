She's the Australian actress who shot to fame after appearing opposite Heath Ledger in the 2006 drama Candy.

And more than a decade on, Abbie Cornish is still garnering praise for her powerful performances.

On Friday night, the blonde beauty, 35, stepped out in Los Angeles for the premiere of her critically-acclaimed new drama, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.

The movie won top prize at September's Toronto Film Festival, possibly helping to put a smile on stunning Abbie's face as she posed on the red carpet.

Co-starring Oscar-winner Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson and Game of Thrones favourite Peter Dinklage, the film follows the mother of a murdered teenager who rents public billboards to pressure police into solving the crime.

For the glitzy premiere, Abbie opted for an unusual ensemble that included a sheer crocheted top complete with frills at the neck and sleeves.

One of the frills dipped down the chest creating a V shape and accentuating the beauty's bust.

The top was tucked into a dark ruffled skirt that reached well below the beauty's knees.

Completing her vampish outfit, Abbie added a pair of black strappy heels as well as black nail and toe polish.

The screen siren opted to sweep her blonde lucks up into a bun, and parted her hair on the side, giving her look a distinct element of Old Hollywood glamour.

At the event Abbie was seen smiling alongside co-star Sam Rockwell and the film's writer/ director Martin McDonagh, best known for his 2008 hit In Bruges.

The stunner was last seen in the big budget disaster movie, Geostorm.
