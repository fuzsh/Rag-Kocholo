        "text": "HONG KONG — Cold War raged through the 32nd Hong Kong Film Awards, winning nine statuettes out of 19 competition categories.\n\nThe Edko Films cop drama, which the screenwriting-directing team of Longman Leung and Sunny Luk took five years to develop, won best film, best director, best screenplay and best actor. Cold War was the highest grossing local production in Hong Kong in 2012, taking in $5.4 million at the Hong Kong box office.\n\nFILM REVIEW: ‘Cold War’\n\nBest actor went to Tony Leung Ka-fai for his role as a deputy police commissioner in Cold War, marking the fourth time The Lover star took home the award after his previous wins for Reign Behind the Curtain (1983), 92 Legendary La Rose Noire (1992) and Election (2005).\n\nSinger-turned-actress Miriam Yeung was named best actress for the first time for her performance in the romantic comedy sequel Love in a Buff. The role was a reprisal of her turn as a smoker and beauty consultant in director Pang Ho-cheung’s 2010 original Love in a Puff.\n\nAlthough Pang Ho-cheung lost to the Cold War screenwriting-directing team in the best director and best screenplay categories, he proved an actor’s director. Apart from best actress winner Yeung in his Love in the Buff, two actors from his other 2012 hit, Vulgaria, also took home acting awards: Ronald Cheng and Dada Chan won the best supporting actor and actress, respectively, for Vulgaria.\n\nList of 32nd Hong Kong Film Awards Winners:\n\nBest Film: Cold War\n\nBest Director: Longman Leung, Sunny Luk (Cold War)\n\nBest Screenplay: Longman Leung, Sunny Luk (Cold War)\n\nBest Actor: Tony Leung Ka-fai (Cold War)\n\nBest Actress: Miriam Yeung (Love In The Buff)\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Ronald Cheng (Vulgaria)\n\nBest Supporting Actress: Dada Chan (Vulgaria)\n\nBest New Performer: Alex Tsui (Cold War)\n\nBest Cinematography: The Silent War\n\nBest Film Editing: Cold War\n\nBest Art Direction: The Last Tycoon\n\nBest Costume and Make Up Design: The Great Magician\n\nBest Action Choreography: Jackie Chan & He Jun (CZ12)\n\nBest Original Film Score: Cold War\n\nBest Original Film Song: The Last Tycoon\n\nBest Sound Design: Cold War\n\nBest Visual Effects: Cold War\n\nBest New Director: Roy Chow (Nightfall)\n\nBest Film from Mainland and Taiwan: Back to 1942\n\nLifetime Achievement Award: Ng See-yuen"
