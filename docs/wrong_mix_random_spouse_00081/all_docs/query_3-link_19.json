        "text": "2 Feb - Hong Kong singer Ronald Cheng recently dedicated his performance to actor Andy Lau, who is currently hospitalised for his filming injury.\n\nAs reported on Mingpao News, the singer, who held the fourth show of his \"Play It Again 2017\" concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum recently, began one of his songs by talking about his 'senior' in music.\n\nWithout naming Andy, Ronald shared that the said senior was supposed to join his show as one of the guests, but was unable to come in the end after an accident during filming in Thailand.\n\nHe praised the senior for his kind heart, as he still sent him oranges to congratulate him for a successful concert.\n\nRonald proceeded by asking audience to light up their phones and create a sea of light as he performs his song, \"Wishing Tree\", wishing for Andy's speedy recovery at the same time.\n\n(Photo Source: beautimode.com)"
