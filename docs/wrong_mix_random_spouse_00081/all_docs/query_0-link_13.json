        "text": "UMKC Announces Vice Chancellor for Research\n\nSumeet Dua will lead growing research enterprise at Kansas Cityâs top public university\n\nSumeet Dua, Ph.D., will become the new University of Missouri-Kansas City vice chancellor for research on Sept. 9. Since 2002, he served in a number of leadership roles at Louisiana Tech University, where he helped to advance research, grant awards and collaborative efforts. UMKC has elevated its research enterprise, doubling expenditures from $25 million to $53 million in four years and increasing annual external awards from $36 million to $147 million. With the forward momentum, UMKC aims to be designated a Carnegie Research 1, or R1, university, meaning it has “very high” research activity. It’s currently R2 with “high” research activity. “Dua will be pivotal in strengthening our research enterprise and expanding our impact,“ said UMKC Chancellor C. Mauli Agrawal, Ph.D. “His expertise in building partnerships and leading innovative research programs will help propel UMKC research endeavors to new heights, and we look forward to the further growth his leadership will bring to our university.” Most recently, Dua served as executive vice president for research at Louisiana Tech, and under his leadership in the past year, Louisiana Tech’s research enterprise saw an 18% increase in annual research expenditures and a 39% increase in federally funded research expenditures. Dua has also led the university’s research operations in the National Cyber Research Park and Louisiana Tech Research Institute, fostering engagement with federal agencies such as the U.S. Department of Defense. This aligns well with UMKC’s research portfolio, which includes a significant number of defense contracts. This year, UMKC became the first university to partner with U.S. Cyber Command. “I’m excited to partner with UMKC to continue its strong momentum in research and reach its goal of achieving a Carnegie R1 status,” Dua said. “I am eager to work with UMKC’s faculty across diverse disciplines and forge strong partnerships and collaborations with government, business and community leaders to accomplish our goals.” Dua also has made significant contributions to academia and industry throughout his career. He has written five books, secured two patents and published more than 70 peer-reviewed articles. His research specialties include data analysis, computational decision support and biomedical imaging. Dua received a Ph.D. in computer science and an M.S. in systems science from Louisiana State University and A&M College. He earned a bachelor’s degree in electronics and communication from Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology in Patiala, India. Jul 19, 2024\n\nMajor Building Projects Taking Shape at UMKC\n\nConstruction includes largest capital improvement project to date\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City has announced and begun construction on major improvements to its physical facilities to meet key strategic goals. Projects currently under construction include: The 200,000 square foot Healthcare Delivery and Innovation Building project at 25th and Charlotte streets, the largest capital improvement project in UMKC history. The $14.5 million medical building for its School of Medicine campus in St. Joseph, Missouri, that will provide 22,000 square feet of medical education space. A new campus dining concept called the Foodiverse that will bring a food-parlor environment to the first floor of the Student Union on the Volker Campus. An expansion of Student Success services, with new facilities on the fourth floor of the Miller Nichols Library. 51st Street Pedestrian Plaza, which will enclose 51st Street from Cherry to Rockhill to provide a walkable, landscaped area for campus and community use. Look here for regular construction and project updates or sign up for a regular email update to be delivered to your inbox. Healthcare Delivery and Innovation Building construction updates (7/19) On Aug. 1, the campus surface parking lot at 25th and Charlotte streets will close to public use. The lot will be enclosed with fencing as crews begins site preparation. Faculty, staff and students can park in the seven-floor Hospital Hill Parking Garage on the southeast corner of 24th and Charlotte streets, just north of the construction site/former lot, or in a surface lot to the east at 25th and Campbell streets. Parking for UMKC School of Dentistry clinic patients as well as metered spots for other UMKC Health Sciences District visitors will be in a lot south of the site. There will be a QR code coming that takes scanners to a website to follow construction updates and see progress photos for those who want to follow along with construction updates. The code will be placed at various locations around the site on the fencing for patrons to scan as they walk past. UMKC will host a community celebration of the construction launch at 3 p.m. Sept. 11. St. Joseph School of Medicine Campus construction updates (7/19) Construction officially began in April. Trees have been cleared and dirt has been moved to pave the way for foundational work. The elevator shaft and some piping work has also been completed. This project is on schedule to open in June 2025. Foodiverse (7/19) Construction at Student Union started in June with clearing space. The dining hall at Atterbury will remain open in the Fall 2024 semester, as well as the Starbucks in Student Union. When the Foodiverse opens, Atterbury dining services will be closed for renovations to create a new expanded student welcome center at Atterbury.

Jul 17, 2024\n\nSound Mandala Introduces New Way To Be Immersed in Audio\n\nA true surround sound system, dozens of speakers line the walls for a unique listening experience\n\nWhen you walk into the Sound Mandala in the black box theatre, you’re greeted by speakers on all sides. The lights will dim, and you’ll hear music and audio like never before. “When you listen to a recorded track, the sounds have been mixed already and you’re hearing it all come out of one console,” said Tom Mardikes, professor of sound design at the UMKC Conservatory. “I wanted to know how a song would sound if it was mixed in the air, as you listen to it.” Mardikes is the creator of the Sound Mandala. Inspired by intricately crafted sand mandalas, Mardikes wanted to apply that precision and artistry to sound. He created a system to place individual sounds of a track on different speakers and move those sounds throughout the duration of the track. Much like movies are moving images, the Sound Mandala is moving audio. Mardikes has been working on the Sound Mandala since 2014. Graduate students in sound design at UMKC have been involved in the process, including his core Sound Mandala team of current and former students. Mardikes holds a patent for the system and foresees its use in theatres, auditoriums and even haunted houses in the future. Photo by Luke Harbur The Sound Mandala has progressed to more than 80 speakers in the black box theatre in Olson Performing Arts Center. Mardikes’s team outfitted the theatre to ensure the best audio experience possible to showcase their creation. The intimate venue holds 40 people, ensuring that every seat is the best seat in the house. “You can hear sounds moving around the room,” Mardikes said. “You might hear a guitar coming from in front of you, a voice behind you and a piano next to you. You’re truly immersed in the sound, it’s an entirely unique experience that’s never been possible before.” Experience a taste of the Sound Mandala. Headphones are required for listening. The Sound Mandala debuts to the public at the 2024 Kansas City Fringe Festival. Sound Mandala shows are July 19-27 at the Black Box Theatre at Olson Performing Arts Center on the UMKC campus. Jul 15, 2024\n\nSt. Louis Native Finds Community and Purpose in Pharmacy at UMKC\n\nSavannah Jenkins is seeking doctoral and master's degrees simultaneously\n\nAt UMKC, students write their own stories, form their own definitions of success and chart innovative career paths. Savannah Jenkins, a St. Louis native, came to UMKC to become a pharmacist and found community, leadership opportunities and a program with unwavering commitment to student success. Savannah JenkinsHometown: St. Louis, MissouriGraduating Year: 2025Degree Program: Pharm.D. and MBAUndergrad: St. Charles Community College, UMSL Why did you choose UMKC? I chose UMKC for several reasons. My fiancé got accepted into the dental school right across the street. I also felt like the School of Pharmacy program’s values aligned with mine with their community outreach, their emphasis on professionalism and innovation. The community I saw in my interview reeled me in. Our professors care about each of us, and there is a lot to get involved with! Why did you choose pharmacy? I used to play doctor with my mom as a kid, so I knew I wanted to do health care, but I didn’t know what I wanted to do. My dad has a pharmacist friend, and initially I thought pharmacy was just standing behind the counter and looking at pills all day. I didn’t realize that there were a ton of job avenues within pharmacy. That flexibility and the different opportunities within pharmacy really spoke to me. Do you know what avenue you want to take within pharmacy? There are so many that it’s hard for me to try and narrow them down, but I think I’ve got it down to two. Ambulatory care or industry work in sales, research or development. I’m also getting my MBA with my Pharm.D. through the Henry W. Bloch School of Management. UMKC offers that unique opportunity to their pharmacy students, which is great. I take my MBA classes online so I’ll graduate with both degrees at the same time. The MBA will give me more opportunities within pharmacy down the line. What has been inspiring to you about pharmacy? I’ve been inspired through my peers and seeing their own experiences in pharmacy. Also, when you go through your rotations and get the chance to apply what you’re learning in the classroom out in the real world and interact with patients, you see that what you’re learning will impact people as a pharmacist. I can look down the road and say, ‘that is going to be me someday!’ What have you learned about yourself at UMKC? Time management. Planning and initiating good time management practices into my daily routine has been important. I try to have three big goals for each day. I have a couple of school goals and one personal goal. Who at UMKC do you admire most? One of my best friends in my program, Ayatt Muslet, is a single mom who is balancing motherhood with schoolwork and several different jobs. She’s doing all this pharmacy work and has four kids to take care of. At the end of a long day, when I’m tired, I know that if she can do it, so can I. She’s really a rock star. What extracurricular activities are you involved in? Last year, I was on the executive board of APHA (American Public Health Association). This year, I’m the president of PHL, or Public Health Organization. I also do research with Our Healthy Jackson County . I get to go out into the community at least twice a month and work with my peers in dental, nursing and medical school. As pharmacy students specifically, we provide free vaccinations and mental health screenings. We are able to refer a patient to additional resources if their screening shows that they need additional mental health support. I feel like I’m really making a difference. What do you hope to take from your experiences at UMKC into your professional career? The professionalism that UMKC instills in their students. They set us up well to communicate effectively with patients and other health-care providers, and they help establish confidence. Confidence, communication, professionalism and problem-solving are all skills I hope to take with me. What is one word that best describes you? Persistent. I had to be persistent about wanting to get where I am. I did community college and wasn’t sure what I wanted to do yet. Then, I got my B.S. and knew I wanted to go into health care, but it was between dentistry and pharmacy. Then I took a gap year and was really working on making myself competitive. I finally made it here, and persistence was the key. At any point, I could have said, “this is a lot of school and I think I’m done.” Most used social media channel? Pinterest. It feels much more relaxing than other social media platforms. What’s your favorite place to eat in Kansas City? Brickhouse Where’s your favorite spot to hang out in Kansas City? I don’t get to hang out a lot but when I do go out, I like the Power and Light District. I spend most of my time at home or at school studying. I also like all the different cafes in Kansas City. How is Kansas City different than St. Louis? It's my first time getting a real feel for downtown city life. There's so much to do just a few minutes away, whether it's catching a game, hitting up some cool bars or exploring local parks. Back home is great too, but it's really nice to switch things up and enjoy the new scenery here. Every day brings something new and exciting!

Jul 11, 2024\n\nUMKC Bloch School, Top Kansas City Banks Announce New Scholarship Opportunity\n\nPartnership includes $10,000 scholarship award per student\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City Henry W. Bloch School of Management is partnering with five top Kansas City banks to announce a new scholarship program. Banking Leaders of Tomorrow is designed to inspire future professionals to make a difference in their communities as leaders in the banking and finance industries. Available to incoming students from Missouri or Kansas, this scholarship totals $10,000 over four years for incoming freshmen who express interest in pursuing careers in banking and finance. To provide continued support during their education, accepted students will also receive both academic and professional mentoring as well as networking opportunities. This scholarship is made possible through generous support and close partnerships with area banks who have committed to supporting students in and out of the traditional classroom through lectures, site visits and panel discussions. They have also committed to providing internship opportunities, ensuring real-world experience throughout these students' time at UMKC. Academy Bank Arvest Foundation Commerce Bancshares Foundation Lead Bank UMB Bank “Banking Leaders of Tomorrow is much more than a scholarship and we could not launch this program without great partners,” said Jocelyn Evans, associate dean of the Bloch School. “These banks are not only committing their time here on campus, but they are also providing important opportunities for our students to explore their future in banking and finance.” Scholarships will be awarded based upon a student’s essay describing their interest in a financial services career and how their experiences have prepared them to engage in banking relationships with individuals and businesses in low- and moderate-income areas in the Kansas City metropolitan area where many residents do not have traditional banking relationships. “The Bloch School is committed to educating students who will improve the communities where they will one day live,” said Bloch School Dean Brian Klaas. “Banking Leaders of Tomorrow furthers that commitment, and we’re grateful to our partner banks for making this possible.” Jul 10, 2024\n\nUMKC School of Pharmacy Receives National Community Pharmacy Center of Excellence Recognition\n\nOne of 17 schools in the nation to receive the inaugural award\n\nThe American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy recognizes pharmacy programs committed to providing community pharmacy services in a transformational way and has designated the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Pharmacy a Community Pharmacy Center of Excellence. The designation recognizes the significant commitment the school has made to advancement in teaching, service, scholarship, leadership and partnerships. The school is one of 17 schools to receive the award. Faculty members Kendall Guthrie (Pharm.D. ‘13), Sarah Oprinovich, Pharm.D., and Heather Lyons-Burney (Pharm.D. ‘94), applied for the award, with help from Mark Sawkin, Pharm.D., Mark Patterson, Ph.D., M.P.H. and Yifei Liu, Ph.D. Alongside the other schools, the UMKC School of Pharmacy will serve as an ambassador for the discipline, and will have unique opportunities to share its knowledge and help other programs develop community-oriented care. “We will be used as a model for other institutions that would like to incorporate more community pharmacy education into their curriculum,” Oprinovich said. “We will also be in closer contact with other Centers of Excellence, so we can all share practices that will improve our students’ readiness for practicing in contemporary community .” Dean Russ Melchert, Ph.D., noted the accomplishment’s importance. “We are very excited and honored to receive the prestigious Center of Excellence designation by AACP for our faculty’s innovative work in advancing community pharmacy practice,” Melchert said. “Pharmacists have been among the most accessible health-care providers, with estimates suggesting that over 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles of a community pharmacy. We are happy to be recognized nationally as a school with expertise in producing outstanding, innovative and entrepreneurial community pharmacy practitioners.\" As a Center of Excellence, the UMKC School of Pharmacy now sets its sights on advancing community pharmacy practice for everyone, and on continued training of the caregivers of tomorrow. According to Oprinovich, many people realize that their community pharmacy is where they can get vaccines, testing for minor acute illnesses, monitor blood pressure and more. “We have multiple faculty who are given the time and space to serve professional organizations, innovate, and research,” Oprinovich said. “Our experiential education leaders also place high value on training students to be well-prepared for the rapid change that is happening in community pharmacy today.” The School of Pharmacy will hold this designation for the next five years, after which it will be invited to reapply. Jul 09, 2024\n\nBig Data Is Big Time\n\nNew center provides opportunities to use multimodal data to solve community problems and develop a critical workforce in Missouri and Midwest.\n\nShu-Ching Chen, Ph.D., has always known big data would be the wave of the future. Chen is the inaugural executive director of the Data Science and Analytics Innovation Center (dSAIC) at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, a position he took to continue his research into multimodal big data analytics. By harnessing immense datasets to extract insights, patterns and knowledge, dSAIC provides the foundation for transformational research. Multimodal big data analytics combines techniques from artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and more to analyze data from different sources and apply them to solve fundamental and real-world problems. “Companies need to analyze data to benefit business,” Chen said. “If you don’t take advantage, you fall behind.” At dSAIC, Chen and his team are working to create tools to help students, companies and stakeholders seamlessly bring together different kinds of data points as quickly as possible to allow for easier analysis and integration. During his 21 years at Florida International University in Miami, Chen’s research into multimodal big data analytics earned funding from the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Homeland Security, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, Army Research Office, Naval Research Laboratory, Environmental Protection Agency, Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, Florida Department of Transportation, IBM and Microsoft. His research was also used to help emergency management in several aspects of post-hurricane recovery efforts, like insurance approvals and damage analysis. Chen plans to continue that work in Kansas City, collaborating with emergency management in other natural disaster- related recoveries, as well as continue to develop tools that can make an impact in all industries and communities across the state. \"Companies need to analyze data to benefit business. If you don’t take advantage, you fall behind.\" — Shu-Ching Chen, Ph.D. Now, with Chen as the leader of dSAIC, the center will support university research across Missouri and will play a critical role in workforce development across Kansas City and the region. He also hopes to continue developing models and projects that can be easily recognized by the general public. In his short time as executive director, the center has been awarded grants, including from the U.S. Department of Education Center of Excellence in Spatial Computing, bringing in more than $1 million in funding. In Chen’s eyes, dSAIC has the potential to be a prestigious hub for multimodal data science due to Kansas City’s continued growth and potential. He hopes to bring together stakeholders and community leaders to identify the need, identify potential projects and identify the impact, helping make it the best data science center in the country. Kansas City’s central location, growing potential and opportunities make it an ideal place for students to learn and apply multimodal research into the community, as well as making an impact on surrounding states in the region. Chen sees the center as a place where graduates will learn the necessary skills and stand out when applying for jobs in the Kansas City area, the region, across the country and around the world. In an industry where technology is evolving quickly, the center will allow students to develop the skills necessary to keep up with the challenges and changes. The Data Science and Analytics Innovation Center will also be a place for alumni to return to campus and share experience from real-world applications, giving students a unique learning experience. But it doesn’t stop at data science. Chen believes students from all disciplines and academic units can benefit from studying multimodal data analytics at dSAIC and meet the demand for high-quality employees from top companies. Data is at the heart of artificial intelligence and machine learning, like the popular ChatGPT, which has seen several applications that go beyond simple search inquiries. With a center like the dSAIC, Chen sees possibilities at the forefront of the next generation of data science technologies. Jul 02, 2024\n\nJournalism and Media Students Hit It Out of the Park with KC Royals\n\nUMKC studentsâ work will be featured on the iconic Crown Vision screen at Kauffman Stadium\n\nStudents studying journalism and film and media arts got a grand slam of an opportunity with Pine Tar Collective, the in-house marketing agency for the Kansas City Royals. The collaborative effort led to a promotional commercial for the University of Missouri-Kansas City partnership with the Royals on Kauffman Stadium Crown Vision, the almost 9,000-square-foot screen above the outfield. “It was an extraordinarily unique opportunity to have a chance to go out to Kauffman Stadium and really experience what life at The K is all about,” said Steve Kraske, teaching professor of journalism. “To work with professionals who really know what they're doing, have a very clear idea of how to film this project and get it in the can. It was a great experience for our students to have that opportunity.” Cristian Martinez, a journalism and film and media arts major, was one student who saw the whole project from concept to screen. “To work with the Royals on this project was amazing,” Martinez said. “It felt like a dream come true. UMKC, whether it be equipment or the professors themselves, has really prepared us for this moment to be on a set with the Royals. It made us felt comfortable. It made us feel like that we were able to really translate what was what we learned in the classroom to a professional set.” Students got the MVP tour of Kauffman and Pine Tar workspaces. They met again later where the students were able to pitch concepts to the production team and finalize a plan. After two days of shooting, where students got to be hands-on behind and in front of the camera, Pine Tar edited the final video that premiered at UMKC Night at The K. It will air during every Friday home game of the remaining Royals season. “All of us we were able to attend and watch our commercial up there,” Martinez said. “The Royals showed us on Crown Vision, which is crazy because I always wanted to be up there. They showcased all of us and it was awesome.” The prime location and partnerships of UMKC allow for these amazing opportunities that students get to advance their career before they even enter the workforce. “I think coming to KC, this is what it's all about,” Martinez said. “I think some people like to tell themselves, ‘I want to go to Chicago. I want to go to New York. I want to go to LA,’ when in reality, Kansas City is the place to be. You get so many opportunities, like the chance to work hands-on early in your dream career.” Jun 28, 2024\n\nMedical Student with a Passion for Public Health Honored with Remington R. Williams Award\n\nAward recognizes University of Missouri System students for character and collaborative spirit\n\nRithika Ginjupalli, a six-year B.A./M.D. student at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, has made her mark at the intersection of medicine and public health. Ginjupalli, originally from India and raised in Colorado, found her love for orthopedic surgery and community public health at UMKC. Ginjupalli was honored on June 27 at the University of Missouri Board of Curators meeting as this year’s UMKC recipient of the Remington R. Williams Award, which celebrates the life and legacy of late UMKC alumnus Remington Williams (J.D. ’22), who died in a car crash in 2022. In UMKC Chancellor Mauli Agrawal’s nomination letter, he wrote: “Rithika consistently demonstrates integrity, respect, compassion and empathy in all her interactions. Beyond her academic achievements, she works collaboratively to build and foster environments of empathy and inclusion wherever she goes.” As a medical student, Ginjupalli has noticed a lack of crossover opportunities for two of her biggest interests: public health and medicine. In addition to her academic duties, she has leaned into public health organizations as much as her schedule allows. With involvement in organizations such as the American Medical Association and the American Cancer Society, she works to effect systematic changes in public health from a medical perspective. She is currently the American Cancer Society’s congressional district lead, collaborating with Congressman Emanuel Cleaver to develop policies. She also is heavily involved with medical research projects that focus on improving health outcomes through community-based participatory research. “Each community is different, and that is part of the challenge when approaching systemic issues,” she said. “Community-based participatory research lets you tailor the interventions to each specific community rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.” In this work, Ginjupalli found her niche in projects that aim to increase health literacy. “There’s a big gap in health literacy for patients and for a lot of the community members we were seeing,” she said. “It’s an issue that’s everywhere.” “Rithika has created opportunities for her fellow classmates to learn and participate in these advocacy spaces,” said UMKC Associate Professor Trung Pham, M.D., in his nomination letter for Ginjupalli. “Rithika is an exceptional and diligent student, consistently demonstrating her commitment to academic excellence.” In 2023 alone, Ginjupalli was given the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Award by the Association of Women Surgeons and Association of Out Surgeons and Allies, the Community Champion Award and the Award for Excellence in Diversity and Health Equity and the Ida Bamberger Memorial Research Award by the UMKC School of Medicine. Her celebrated achievements haven’t stopped her from dreaming up more ways to make an even bigger impact. Receiving the Remington R. Williams Award is “just a sign that I’m doing something right and to continue what I’m doing,” she said. “We don’t do this work for the recognition of it. But recognizing public health work is important because it motivates others to enter this space too.” Next up for Ginjupalli is a temporary move to Baltimore, Maryland. She will spend the next year at Johns Hopkins, earning an accelerated Master of Public Health degree before her sixth and final year at UMKC in 2025. The Remington R. Williams Award is the highest non-academic honor that a student can receive from the Board of Curators. In addition to being a UMKC alumnus, Williams was the student representative to the University of Missouri Board of Curators (2020-2022), and this award is given to students who embody his legacy of high academic achievement, natural leadership and exceptional care to others. Recipients are selected annually and will receive a leadership medal to wear at commencement, a $1,000 award and an invitation to be recognized at a Board of Curators meeting. Jun 27, 2024\n\nStudent Teaching Goes Major League with MLB Partnership at UMKC\n\nKayla Tottress has a calling to help children love learning\n\nFor most teachers, their classrooms look much the same, desks, white boards and colorful posters. But for Kayla Tottress, the classroom sometimes looks quite different, a turf-and-dirt kind of different. The junior in elementary education is part of the University of Missouri-Kansas City Institute for Urban Education (IUE), which trains culturally responsive teachers who receive scholarships in exchange for committing to teach in Kansas City-area districts. Among the IUE’s many partners are Major League Baseball and the Kansas City Royals. Together, they team up to help kids in Kansas City enjoy reading and learn a love of the game through the MLB Urban Youth Academy. “What a great way for our students to get involved in their community because we have a team, the Royals, so not only are they getting to learn about baseball and teamwork, but they have a fun outlet, a place to go while also encouraging them to do well in school,” Tottress said.UMKC students work with local elementary students throughout the year, helping them strengthen their reading skills at “Power Hour” tutoring sessions. At the end of the semester, students get to have a baseball trivia night. The game requires students to read and answer trivia questions to earn their chance to hit the ball. After they get a hit, the game proceeds like regular baseball. Though it may seem like fun and games, Tottress said it’s important for students.“I think it's very important that students don't get used to just the tedious, mundane task of everyday learning,” she said. “If we can get them to learn and have fun at the same time, we feel like we're doing a good job as educators.”Major-league partnerships aren’t the only experiences Tottress has had in the classroom. She has also participated in Lead to Read, an initiative to read with students. And she’s been a student teacher at Trailwoods Elementary, part of Kansas City Public Schools, also a UMKC partner. Tottress said being in a classroom, having unique teaching and learning experiences and learning from teachers who have different teaching styles have inspired her to think of how she can bring her own style into the classroom.“One of the advantages of being in a city like Kansas City is that I get to see all different types of people that come from all different walks of life,” Tottress said. “I wouldn’t want to teach anywhere else.”Whether it’s teaching in the classroom, tutoring or leading baseball trivia, for Tottress it’s all about connection. In fact, she says that’s why she chose UMKC. From the moment she inquired at UMKC, Tottress said faculty were responsive to her questions and dedicated to ensuring she was supported. “I really sensed that someone wanted me in their program,” Tottress said. “I love that personal aspect and connection of being connected to a college. I hadn't even said yes yet, and they were already setting things up, saying, ‘We want you to be here.’” Jun 18, 2024\n\nEducation Major Selected Among Best in Missouri for Prestigious Award\n\nGenesis Ventura Amaro is on track to become an educator who changes lives\n\nRecent University of Missouri-Kansas City alumna Genesis Ventura Amaro is an Institute for Urban Education (IUE) scholar who is committed to teaching at historically underserved schools. She received the Milken Teacher Leader of Tomorrow Award before she graduated, making her one out of only 13 recipients in Missouri. The Milken Teacher Leader of Tomorrow Award is a recent establishment from the Missouri branch of the Milken Educator Awards program to celebrate and encourage pre-service teachers enrolled in Missouri’s public Educator Preparation Programs. This year, one Kansas City area student teacher had the honor of receiving this award. Amaro decided to become an educator after she immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic six years ago. Amaro attended UMKC to study early childhood education and was an IUE scholar. This means that Amaro received additional training focused on teaching in urban schools and received a scholarship to support her while becoming a teacher; as an IUE scholar Amaro is committed to teaching in Kansas City’s urban schools for four years after graduation. “I loved being a Roo and I am sad that my time at UMKC is over,” she said. “I really valued how much people wanted me to succeed at UMKC. Being a part of the IUE has allowed me to bring in a different, more responsive perspective to the spaces I find myself in. Discussions with my peers, the school I teach at in urban KC and even anybody who would let me talk about the importance of culturally responsive teaching and restorative practices. All of this I have learned through the IUE seminars.” Amaro’s professor and mentor Jennifer Fergerson nominated her for the Milken Teacher Leader of Tomorrow Award. “Gen has been a really strong student teacher and has thrived as an educator since she began,” Fergerson said. “She truly embodies what an educator is, and it shows in the classroom. It’s really easy to forget that she is student teaching, since she develops skills so quickly and teaches as someone with much more experience than she actually has.” It was no surprise to Fergerson when Amaro was named as a recipient. “I was really proud of her when she won,” Fergerson said. “Especially because right before I found out, Gen was having a conversation with me about how much she loves what she does. It was just so fitting. She truly deserves this recognition.” However, it was a big surprise to Amaro since she didn’t even know she was nominated. “I feel so honored to be a recipient of the award,” Amaro said. “As a student teacher, my focus has always been on what I could do better, so noticing what I am doing well can be challenging at times. It is very rewarding to know that my hard work is being noticed and acknowledged by others as well.” Amaro completed her student teaching as part of a year-long internship at the Academy for Integrated Arts charter school (AFIA), which is also where she was presented with the surprise award.The Milken Teacher Leader of Tomorrow Award recipients not only get an exclusive network of highly regarded fellow educators, but will also be actively supported during their first year in the classroom. Each recipient will be paired with a seasoned Milken Educator, who is an experienced teacher, as a mentor. The mentor will provide a safe space for the new educator to ask questions, share ideas and gain guidance. “I’m inspired to become a teacher that students can relate to and connect deeply with,” Amaro said. “Even if I can’t change the teaching world, I can change the lives of individual children. I know how important early childhood is, and I am thankful to be blessed with the opportunity of being trusted with so many little minds and hearts to take care of.” Jun 18, 2024\n\nHereâs How UMKC is Embracing Artificial Intelligence\n\nUsing AI in teaching and research is just the beginning\n\nKansas City’s research university is known for being innovative and future-forward. As artificial intelligence engrains itself into our everyday lives, many faculty have been on the leading edge of using this technology in the classroom and in their respective fields. Here’s what professors campuswide are doing to keep up with AI. School of Science and Engineering ZhiQiang Chen, Ph.D. is one of the founding chair members of a new American Society of Civil Engineers national committee looking at AI in the classroom. The committee is working to answer the global pressing needs of adopting generative AI into civil engineering classrooms. In Fall 2023, he developed the first civil engineering AI course offered at UMKC titled “Intro to AI for Natural and Built Environment Applications.” School of Medicine Sara Gardner (B.L.A. ’01, M.D. ‘02) is looking at how to incorporate appropriate use of AI in patient care and education. “Clinically, as our faculty and institutions have adapted and learned more, we understand the utility of AI to recognize small, incremental changes in our patients that could lead to better treatment strategies that ultimately improve patient outcomes,” Gardner said. “Our graduates will likely encounter this technology very early in their post-graduate training, so we are looking for opportunities for them to be exposed to, and learn to respond to, this data on clinical clerkships. Our students also need to understand and become adept at querying these databases, whether that is generating clinical documentation to a complex interpretation of test results specific to the personal characteristics of your patient, to better understand how to interpret these results for their individual patients.” School of Nursing and Health Studies Jim Spence (B.A. ’95, M.P.A. ’02, B.S.N. ‘09) interim associate dean for academic affairs, has presented at nursing conferences on AI in nursing education. Spence is also encouraging both faculty and students to utilize AI in the classroom, whether that is for developing test questions or patient case studies. For patient case studies, AI is able to generate details of the patient’s social history such as name, gender, age, occupation and physical history from lab tests such as neurological assessments and cardiac testing. School of Humanities and Social Sciences Antonio Byrd, Ph.D., serves on the Modern Language Association and Conference on College Composition and Communication Joint Task on Artificial Intelligence and Writing, a national task force that discusses humanities interventions in AI and higher education. One such example is creating guidelines for AI policies to honor students' linguist diversity and autonomy. School of Education, Social Work and Psychological Sciences Jake Marszalek, Ph.D., interim associate dean and professor of psychology, is investigating the potential outcomes of using AI for learning and education. Marszalek is a co-investigator on a multidisciplinary grant from Unanimous AI to investigate educational outcomes for a software that enables peer-to-peer collaboration while protecting data privacy and security. Henry W. Bloch School of Management Larry Wigger, Ph.D., is currently exploring humanity’s role in increasingly automated workplaces due to AI. With AI automation threatening to displace the lowest-skilled workers, given their predominantly routine tasks, tomorrow’s workforce needs a better way to gain the critical experience to manage and lead. Wigger’s research focuses on how future workers should be equipped with critical thinking skills to employ AI ethically, minimizing negative effects. School of Law School of Law professor Ryan Copus, J.D., encourages students to use large language models when writing papers, exploring ideas or completing any other assignments. Copus teaches a course titled “Data, Decisions and Justice,” where he introduces the idea of technically and ethically responsible ways to apply the power of AI to regulate legal decision-making. In this course, students get to code and build their own machine learning model as well as engage in AI research literature. Jun 17, 2024\n\nComing Soon: More Campus Dining Options at UMKC\n\nFive new details about the Foodiverse\n\nConstruction is underway on new campus dining options at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. In his State of the University address, Chancellor Mauli Agrawal offered a sneak peek of the UMKC Foodiverse. “This is an exciting addition for our students, our employees on campus and the Kansas City community,” said Jody Jeffries, director of the Student Union. “This will elevate our dining experience at UMKC.” What is the Foodiverse? The Foodiverse will be a food-parlor environment on the first floor of the Student Union. There will be eight food concepts, including the full-service Starbucks on the east and a full-service Chick-fil-A that will replace the Chick-fil-A Express on the west. The other six food stalls include: An isolated allergen-free zone Pizza and pasta Deli Salad bar Grill Home-style meals Additionally, more modern furnishings will be added to both interior and exteriors space at Student Union. Why is the Foodiverse being created? The Foodiverse will be closer to UMKC residence halls and centrally located on campus. It also will be short distance from the KC Streetcar stop that is expected to run to and from the UMKC Volker Campus next year. What is the construction timeline, and will the dining hall remain open at Atterbury? The construction at Student Union recently started with clearing space, and is expected to be completed in January 2025 for the spring semester. Meanwhile, the dining hall at Atterbury will remain open. When the Foodiverse opens, Atterbury dining services will be closed for renovations to create a new expanded student welcome center at Atterbury. Will any dining options remain open at Student Union? Yes, the full-service Starbucks will maintain its normal business operations during construction. How will meal plans work for students and for the community? Meal plan holders will engage with the area by visiting one of the six Foodiverse options to compile a full meal from the specific station, and then will be afforded second helpings from any one of the six options during the same meal period. Plan holders will have Meal Exchanges and Flex Dollars associated with their accounts to allow for full retail purchasing at Starbucks and Chick-fil-A. This will be managed through point-of-sale technology. Jun 17, 2024\n\nPolitical Science Student From Arkansas Finds Purpose and Passions at UMKC\n\nFlexibility and drive allow student to forge professional connections for a greater purpose\n\nAt UMKC, students write their own stories, form their own definitions of success and chart innovative career paths. Emmanuel is turning dreams into reality by creating connections in political science and Spanish degree programs and participating in organizations including the Association of Latin American Students and Multicultural Student Affairs. Emmanuel Fabian Anticipated graduation: 2026 UMKC degree program: Political science and Spanish Hometown: Clarksville, Arkansas Emmanuel Fabian came to UMKC and found his passions. While studying to be a filmmaker, he discovered his true career goal was to help immigrants in the United States. He changed his major to support that goal but still finds time to hone his art and make connections throughout the university and beyond. Why did you choose UMKC? I have a desire for filmmaking, and that wasn't really something that was offered anywhere near me in Arkansas. So, I came to Kansas City. Now that I'm here, I've also learned that I have other interests, and some really dominate. I've been wanting to work with immigrants; see if I can help them out. That’s why I changed my major, even though I am still making films. How has your college program inspired you? I try to really get involved, and not just at the university, in Kansas City. I’ve found that it's been very beneficial. I've met a lot of great people. Who do you most admire? The people I admire most at this school are all the people that I collaborate with. Some in the Association of Latin American Students, some have been in the Multicultural Student Affairs Office. Some are in the world and languages departments. It's many down-to-earth, great people. They’ve assisted me in so many different ways with my academic career. Do you have any leadership positions here on campus? I serve as a public relations officer for the association of Latin American students.. It's beneficial to me. I've been able to meet a lot of great people over there. It’s awesome to talk to everyone, and it helps me balance my schoolwork. What word best describes you? Indecisive. That’s something I’ve learned about myself, coming to school here. I've also learned that it just means that I'm interested in many things. Career-wise, it's let me really narrow down my decision on what I want to do in life: helping immigrants. Jun 13, 2024\n\nFive Questions with School of Medicine Dean Alexander Norbash\n\nMeet the UMKC alumnus as he takes on a new role\n\nAlexander Norbash (B.A./M.D. '86) has returned to his alma mater as the dean of the School of Medicine. Previously, he served as the chair and professor of radiology at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, where he continued to hone his extensive background in research and health-care collaboration. Norbash joins the school at a pivotal time, with a $120 million Healthcare Delivery and Innovation Building breaking ground later this year and a new $14.5 million medical education building under construction on the St. Joseph, Missouri, campus. He joined the school as dean in March. What inspired your career in medicine? My father was a surgeon and the town physician in Platte City, Missouri, for many years. His practice was actually a family business. My mother was the office manager. My little brother and I did odd jobs and filing. This was many years ago before electronic medical records. We saw the patients enter the office with numerous ailments and symptoms, many clearly worried, some visibly with discomfort or pain and others with some level of reluctance. Inevitably, many — if not most — left with a sense of relief and gratitude. This left an impression on us that the work was serious and meaningful. Being a physician’s son also means I heard about the frustrations and limitations of health-care delivery, so I felt that I had a balanced impression of the career. In the end, any frustrations or limitation of the career were offset by the gratitude the practitioner felt for the privilege of alleviating pain and suffering in a fellow human being. Later, when it came time to decide on colleges and a career, the final choice was clear. Talk about a fond UMKC School of Medicine memory. My classmates were remarkable. They were brilliant and gifted and energetic, always testing the limits of what we could or should do. For a period of time, we believed that our teachers and professors knew us by the moniker, “that terrible class.” We were always testing the limits of rules, rather than following them. Which I suppose is what you expect with individuals who are adventurous, creative, innovative and want to do things “better.” The respective rules might just go out the window in certain instances. When I was a student, the units were all alive and buzzing with activity. Students were everywhere, and you could hear laughter and happy conversations in all the halls. We had a full-sized pool table on the fifth floor, and on any given evening, six or seven of us would congregate around the pool table watching our classmates winning and losing. (We) talked about politics, religion, what we were doing and planned on doing and all that lay ahead of us in that long and barely visible road we called the future. What are your goals for the School of Medicine as dean? I want to have the best and happiest medical school possible. I want the students to be exceptionally kind, brilliant clinicians, completely satisfied and pleasantly surprised by their experience. I want the faculty and staff to be fulfilled and contributing to a community of innovation and experimentation. I want the community – including Kansas City and our adjoining states – to appreciate this amazing gem for what it is, and what it will become. You are well-versed in the importance of medicine in rural communities, which is the focus of our St. Joseph campus. What is your vision for that program as it grows? I had a remarkable rural medicine elective experience in Cassville, Missouri, many, many moons ago. I was struck by the strong independence of my preceptor, who was absolutely on his own for all sorts of maladies and issues presented on a daily basis. Our rural practitioners are not only remarkable physicians, but they are also trusted resources, neighbors and sage advisors. We will do everything possible to ensure our rural practitioners preserve the principles of kindness and sensitivity they are known for, while helping them innovate with advances such as population science, preventive medicine and wearable technology to ensure that rural populations benefit from the innovations that are constantly being utilized and implemented in technology-rich urban settings. What is something about you that may surprise people? Before choosing medicine as a career, I considered commercial aviation. To that end, my hobby for the past 33 years has been flying, and for the past 30 years it has been flying helicopters. If for some reason I weren’t a physician, my alternative career choice would have been a coast guard helicopter pilot. Jun 03, 2024\n\nUMKC Student Receives Nationally Competitive Boren Awards Scholarship\n\nLiberty Gladden heads to South Korea, thanks to her award\n\nUMKC student Liberty Gladden has been selected as a winner of a 2024 Boren Scholarship. Gladden, a junior studying computer and information sciences with a minor in business, will receive funding to pursue intensive Korean language study at a university in South Korea in Fall 2024. Gladden is currently studying abroad at Hanyang University in South Korea, and this opportunity will allow her to return to the country for another semester and further cultural immersion. Gladden’s future goals involve pursuing her Master in Business Administration at UMKC and eventually working as a leader within the U.S. government. The Boren Awards is a highly competitive national award program, which provides up to $25,000 in funding for students to study language and culture abroad. The program aims to provide students with the resources and encouragement necessary to acquire skills and experiences in areas of the world critical to U.S. national security. In exchange, recipients accept a service requirement to work for the federal government for at least one year after the completion of their program. Recipients are chosen based on the relevance of their country and language to U.S. national security, their commitment to long-term government service, demonstrated academic preparation and cultural adaptability. “I’m excited for this award to help impact my future by allowing me to carry out my career goals on a global scale passionately,” Gladden said. “This opportunity will help me achieve mastery in Korean, which will enable me to further be of service to the Korean people and aid in U.S.-South Korea relations. It is a blessing to be given this opportunity and I credit it to the hard work put in by not only myself, but also so many others who have helped me along this journey such as my UMKC Competitive Awards Advisor McLain Hymer and even professor Alex Matlack.” Gladden discovered the Boren Awards thanks to Hymer. \"When Liberty and I first met, she had never heard of the Boren Awards before, but it quickly became apparent that this program would be a great fit based on her interest in the Korean language and a future career path within the federal government,” said McLain Hymer, manager of nationally competitive awards at the UMKC Career Services. “I am excited to hear about how this opportunity for cultural immersion will help Liberty continue to enhance her Korean language skills and further her personal and professional development.” UMKC Career Services offers career development and resources for UMKC students and graduates, such as help with applying for competitive awards to further academic and professional interests. They also offer opportunities for employers to connect with talented students and alumni. “I am excited to continue working with UMKC students of all academic disciplines as they pursue nationally competitive award opportunities,” Hymer said. “The experiential learning opportunities offered through programs like Boren are amazing ways for our students to deepen their understanding of the world around them and reflect on their goals for the future.” May 31, 2024\n\nUMKC a Top Choice for 2024 Hispanic Development Fund Scholarship Recipients\n\nCampus event at Henry W. Bloch School of Management honors hundreds\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City is once again a top choice for high school and returning students who received Hispanic Development Fund scholarships for the next academic year. This year, the Greater Kansas City Hispanic Development Fund awarded a record-breaking $1.2 million dollars in scholarship funds to 509 recipients. Of those, 125 represent new and returning scholars at UMKC. The Hispanic Development Fund (HDF) awarded its first scholarships in 1984, providing $100 each to 100 students through a separately named Hispanic Scholarship Fund. UMKC hosted the scholars and their families at the Henry W. Bloch School of Management for the second straight year. Lauren Orozco (B.B.A. ’23) played a large role in organizing this year’s event. As a former HDF scholar, she understands the lasting impact this scholarship program can have. “The Hispanic Development Fund gave me a valuable and connecting community that helped prepare me for life after I graduated,” said Orozco, who now serves as an admissions counselor at the Bloch school. “That is the lasting mark the Hispanic Development Fund has on their students. They aren't just providing them a scholarship but with a community that will continue to grow and give back.” During this year’s event, students received detailed information about their opportunities and the partnering organizations, but one of the most important elements of the event was the opportunity for the students and their families to celebrate their success. Marlon Perez-Morales is a sophomore studying business administration with an emphasis in finance. “The connections I’ve made through HDF have made a big difference early in my college career. I’m also involved as a mentor and can tell other students about HDF and give back to them.” Phillip St. John is a senior studying business administration with an emphasis in entrepreneurship. He’s also a second-generation HDF scholar. His father, and UMKC alumnus, Steven St. John (B.A. ’96) was also an HDF scholar and now hosts the popular sports morning show “Border Patrol” on 810 WHB. Knowing the impact HDF can have, he pointed his son toward the program. “I’ve been an HDF scholar each year here at UMKC,” the younger St. John said. “The financial assistance has been important but the connections I’ve made through this program have had the biggest impact.” Lilah Crum Barnhill is a junior studying philosophy and French. “The Hispanic Development has given me an amazing community support system,” Barnhill said. “Receiving this continued financial support as a returning HDF scholar has ensured my success here at UMKC.” May 31, 2024\n\nUMKC Featured in Wall Street Journal Article on College Investment\n\nOne alumnus was featured in the article discussing the return on investment of a bachelor's degree\n\nThe University of Missouri-Kansas City was featured in a recent story from the The Wall Street Journal. The story discusses the colleges where students are most likely to see a positive return on the investment of a bachelor's degree. The journal found that \"young professionals graduating from public universities charging in-state tuition often receive a degree that is worth the money—with one caveat. New graduates need to earn at least $50,000 a year, on average, in their first decade off campus for the degree to pay off.\" UMKC alumnus James Maiden spoke with The Wall Street Journal about his salary and job experiences before and after receiving his bachelor's degree. James Maiden (B.L.A. '19) was quoted in the Wall Street Journal about the return of investment on a college degree. Photo by Brandon Parigo | UMKC From The Wall Street Journal: \"James Maiden, 32 years old, dropped out of the University of Missouri-Kansas City about a decade ago because he needed to make money. He held various jobs, including at a shoe store, before landing one as a marketing manager for a nonprofit theater in Kansas City, Mo., where he earned less than $50,000. It was tough to envision a career path. 'I was working in circles without a degree,' he said. 'I needed to go back.' After earning his bachelor’s in liberal arts in 2019, Maiden got a job as a communication specialist for a construction company. He now makes almost double what he earned at the theater.\" Read the full story from The Wall Street Journal (subscription required).

May 29, 2024\n\nKansas City Law Firm Commits $250,000 to Bar Prep Support\n\nThe gift from Wagstaff & Cartmell will provide free bar preparation to UMKC School of Law students\n\nWagstaff & Cartmell, a litigation law firm in Kansas City, made a five-year, $250,000 commitment to the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Law’s bar preparation fund. Their gift supports an initiative by the law school to provide a commercial bar preparation program and in-person supplemental course at no additional cost to students. As of December 2023, every UMKC J.D. graduate has access to these resources. The stress of bar preparation is a feeling that many attorneys remember, even years into successful careers. Brian Madden (J.D. ’92) and Jack Hyde (J.D. ’11), both partners at Wagstaff & Cartmell, spoke about the importance of supporting students as they take this step in their careers. “Many of us were fortunate to have support from the firms we were going to work for when it came to bar preparation,” Hyde said. “Not everyone has that support, and it can be a big obstacle. We knew this would be a meaningful way to give back to students that would help them the most.” While some law firms will pay for bar preparation expenses, students with ambitions in public service and other areas of law will have to decide whether to pay the cost themselves, an average of $4,000, or choose to take the bar exam without that support. “Recognizing that UMKC serves a very diverse economic student population, and given the current cost of bar preparation, we don’t want to see students forego it due to cost,” Madden said. “I cannot imagine taking the bar exam without preparation. It gives you a comfort level, both with the substance and the psychological stress. It’s so important that everyone has an opportunity to play on an equal playing field with regards to the bar exam.” The commitment from Wagstaff & Cartmell is the first one by a law firm. “We would love to see other mid-size and large law firms take this opportunity to support these students,” Madden said. “UMKC Law makes significant contributions to the Kansas City legal market, both at the public level through judges, prosecutors and defenders, and at the private level. There are a lot of very successful private attorneys in the city who graduated from UMKC.” “The long-term success of UMKC is vital to the local bar and firms like ours based in Kansas City,” Hyde said. “A lot of students end up working in the community they graduate from, so having the school here is vital to Kansas City. It’s the only law school in Kansas City.” Learn more about the bar preparation initiative at the UMKC School of Law.

Now at the Bank of America Gallery in Union Station, the Disney 100 exhibit features more than 250 artifacts including works of art, costumes, props and other memorabilia from the historic vault of the Walt Disney Archives. Kansas City and UMKC have a storied history with Walt Disney and his media empire. Perhaps most well-known, Disney is known to be the first illustrator of KC Roo, the university mascot. To celebrate this shared history, a special gallery is included exclusively for the Kansas City run of the exhibit to celebrate the connections. “I’m not aware of any other college that can claim the most famous animator in the world drew their mascot. UMKC is singular in that respect.” said George Guastello (B.B.A. ’82, MBA ’84). “As a proud Kansas Citian and UMKC alumnus, it’s a thrill to have a special section, Union Station’s Hometown Connections Gallery, that honors Disney’s deep roots here in our community.” In addition to the Kansas City gallery, Union Station, UMKC and Missouri Humanities Council have teamed up to present special programming for Disney fans to hear from the voice of Goofy and Pluto, learn about the experience of animators and discover a deeper understanding of Disney’s life and experiences in Kansas City and Missouri. Join us for UMKC Day at Disney 100 on Oct. 19 for special UMKC presentations that are free after admission purchase. UMKC professor David Trowbridge, Ph.D., will present Walt Disney’s Kansas City, a presentation and Q&A on Disney’s childhood and early career. Tickets are free on the Union Station website. There is also a special maker activity with staff from the National Museum of Toys and Miniatures. Participants will explore the different versions of the UMKC mascot, including the one illustrated by Disney and sew their own stuffed kangaroo. Tickets are free on the Union Station website. Emmy-winning alumnus Douglas Enderle (M.F.A. ’81) will present The Roo Behind the Magic about his career after UMKC. Note: Enderle is only presenting Oct. 19. Tickets are free on the Union Station website. The exhibit is open until November 2024.

The new rates maintain UM’s reputation for being a top value in higher education nationally and allow the UM System to continue investing in student success. Since 2018, UM’s strategy for investing in student success has resulted in historic highs in retention and graduation rates. Over the past five years, the university’s cost per degree has fallen 11% when compared to inflation. Undergraduate tuition at all four UM universities will rise 5%. Graduate and professional tuition increases will range from 3% to 5%. Details will be available at each university’s website later today. University of Missouri-Columbia: https://cashiers.missouri.edu/ University of Missouri-Kansas City: https://www.umkc.edu/cashiers/tuition-fees/ Missouri University of Science & Technology: https://sfa.mst.edu/cost-estimates/ University of Missouri-St. Louis: https://www.umsl.edu/sfs/tuition-fees/index.html Even with the increases in tuition and fees, the cost of education at UM universities is significantly less than the national average. Additionally, the UM universities continue to outperform their peers related to retention and graduation rates, as well as post-graduation success, which is a measure of how many students achieve their post-graduation goals within six months of graduating. In 2023, more than 95% of UM students graduating achieved their post-graduation goals, nearly 9 points higher than the national average.“We are proud to support student success by providing a world-class education at an exceptional value,” University of Missouri President Mun Choi said. “Our students are completing their degrees on time and with the experience needed to launch great careers right away. The tuition increase will ensure that we keep delivering results that change lives and support the economic development in Missouri.”\"As curators, we have two key guideposts when we consider tuition,\" said Robin Wenneker, chair of the UM Board of Curators. \"First, we must be financially responsible fiduciaries of the university. Second, we must do all we can to provide an extraordinary educational experience that will position our graduates for immediate and long-term success. We are meeting both of these important objectives with today’s announcement and look forward to a promising 2024-2025 academic year at all UM universities.” The tuition increases will continue to provide funding to: Invest in more course sections Invest in more advisors Invest in more faculty Invest in more tutoring support Invest in new classrooms and laboratories Invest in new instruments Invest in research opportunities May 23, 2024\n\nUMKC Alumnus Is Helping First-Generation Students Achieve Their Dreams\n\nKansas Cityâs very own civil rights hero shares his feelings about UMKC and giving back\n\nAlvin Brooks (B.A. ’59, M.A. ’73) is a name many in the Kansas City community know. He has served as a police officer, councilman and has participated in many acts of public service, urban progression and civil rights. Brooks also had a scholarship named after him for more than a decade and received an honorary doctorate from UMKC in 2012. He has continuously made donations and gifts to UMKC in support of student life, student programs, services and scholarships for 14 years. He is also involved long term with the university’s Institute for Urban Education as an advisory member to this day. I heard there is a movie coming out about you based off your memoir, and it is directed by Academy Award-winning director, Kevin Wilmott. How did that come about? Yes! The movie is coming out on Juneteenth, and it is based off my memoir, Binding Us Together. Kevin read it and reached out, saying that he was interested in turning it into a documentary. I wasn’t going to say no to that! I’m excited. Kevin is a great guy and a lot of the scenes from the book will be discussed and shown. How did you feel when you were named Alumnus of the Year in 2009 and then received an honorary doctorate in 2012? Oh, I felt great! I didn't expect it, but I was confident about it. It made me think that maybe some of the things that I have done mattered. I am representing UMKC and got to see it grow throughout the years. I was genuinely surprised with an honorary doctorate because I didn’t really do anything to earn one! I’m just happy UMKC valued what I did enough to give me one. How did you feel when you found out there was a scholarship named after you? Again, I was extremely honored, knowing that there were people who wanted to give back using my name. Though I am still trying to figure out who were the ones that started it! I think I have a good idea who did it, I will let you know. Alvin Brooks, on the right, smiling with Frank White Jr. and Jannette Berkley-Patton, M.A., Ph.D. One of your scholarship preferences is for first-gen students, why do you think that is important? I’m extremely pleased that being a first-generation student is a requirement. I think it's very significant and needed. The students who have resources to begin with are going to make it anyway, as opposed to those who struggle, who are the first one in their class or family to go to college or even the first one to finish high school. I’ve spoken about this many times. It is an incentive for those students. It will encourage them to push forward in their studies and create something for themselves. That is why it is important. Why is giving back so valuable and important to you, and how does that tie with being a first-generation student? I was completely on my own when I was an undergraduate. I had no help, and it was very difficult. I think meeting people that came from such different walks of life really opened my eyes. That is why giving back is valuable to me. I want to help students not have as hard of a time as I did. I also hope funded programs at UMKC attract different students and help first-time students meet a variety of people. I know you are a humble man, Mr. Brooks, but are you aware of the impact you make toward our community? No. Well, let me say this. I hope that I have made some impact. Especially in the areas of race relations and interpersonal relations. I'm a believer. Regardless of what your race might be. I think we should all be free and treated kindly. Not just in America, but all six billion of us. That is what I pursue and believe in, and I try to pass that down to my family and those around me. When I get the opportunities to do things, it makes me feel good. To know that people think I can do that. I’m not Moses or Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., but I am an honest man with integrity. So all I can say is that I hope that I have done well representing UMKC, and I am proud to have done what I did. I hope that when people talk about what I’ve done, they can relate to my humble beginnings. I struggled, but accomplished the things that are most important. What role and impact do you think UMKC is making? UMKC has become more prominent since my time being here, and I think the university has realized its role of an urban university. UMKC has become more aware of the community around it and has developed over time. There were only a handful of Black students when I was here in 1956. Now, it’s almost like the United Nations in terms of student population. There are still some issues, but I think there has been a consciousness on the part of the university and its higher administrative members, which will be passed on to the students in the classroom. That’s what UMKC is all about.
