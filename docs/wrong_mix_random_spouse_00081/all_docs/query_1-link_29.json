        "text": "One could argue that there are five seasons in Los Angeles: summer, fummer (fall/summer), rain, June Gloom, and that time of year when film notables land in droves and start popping up at screenings.\n\nOne could also argue that it is *always* the last of the five seasons named in LA. Because so many film professionals live here. And yet, December through February feels richer in terms of seeing these people in person, we're guessing because of the award season swirl, in part.\n\nThank you, award season swirl.\n\nAbbie Cornish and Jane Campion will be appearing at the Aero Theatre on Saturday, December 12th to Q&A about that romantic period film \"Bright Star\"; \"Sweetie,\" another fine work from \"The Piano\" director, will screen after.\n\nJane Campion has had an amazing career -- among her films is the great Kate Winslet-starrer \"Holy Smoke\" -- and it is a rare treat for Angelenos to see her Q&A. Likewise, if you've seen magazines as of late, you know Abbie Cornish, and you know she's getting raves for her turn in \"Bright Star.\"\n\nGet there, see this beautiful film again, and hear behind-the-scenes tales and how the movie came together, from the people who made it."
