        "text": "The presentation ceremony for the 32nd Hong Kong Film Awards which took place at Grand Theatre in Hong Kong Cultural Centre came to an end few hours ago. It’s one of the most prestigious events in the large Chinese film industry. The hosts for the awards ceremony are Eric Tsang (whom had just celebrated his 60th birthday in a grand manner), Ronald Cheng, Gordon Lam and Jerry Lamb. 4 males. What a collaboration.\n\nGenerally, ‘Cold War’ is the biggest winner representing Hong Kong films in 2012 by winning a total of 9 awards out of 12 nominations received. So, the film is the most nominated and most win. On the other hand, ‘The Bullet Vanishes’ received 12 nominations too (the most also) but failed to win even a single award. That’s really disappointing and sad to the team behind this film. By the way, I didn’t watch ‘Cold War’, and so I didn’t know how great this film delivers. 21 awards presented, and ‘Cold War’ almost snatched half of total awards given on that night. Must be one of the films with biggest win in the history of the awards presentation too. Incredible. I think now I’m going to watch this film to see how great it is.\n\nBut my biggest disappointment of the night is on best actress category. I am totally supporting and rooting for Sammi Cheng to win from her work in ‘Romancing in Thin Air’. She did brilliantly well in the film and her performance had improved quite significantly. In the awards history, she had received most number of nominations in best actress category (6 times) but failed to win any. She truly deserves the award, and now, it slipped out of her hands again. She must be feeling devastated again. It seems like she had no fate with the awards. Now, there came her junior, Miriam Yeung that clinched the best actress this time. What on earth is happening? Let’s hope that Sammi would continue on acting in better films, and perhaps gets nominated on next year for her upcoming performance in ‘Blind Detective’ which also stars Andy Lau. However, I think that film emphasizes more on Andy, the blind detective. I will support her. It’s her time already! How come the judges can’t think and decide wisely? And she even lost out also the best original film song category. Going home empty handed again. Sad, man!\n\nHere below is the full list of the nomination list with the one in bold turned out to be the winner for each particular categories announced not long ago.\n\n1.
