        "text": "Hong Kong singer and actor\n\nRonald Cheng Chung-kei (born 9 March 1972) is a Hong Kong actor, singer and songwriter.\n\nRonald Cheng was born in Hong Kong.[1] Originally intending to work behind the scenes as a songwriter and a producer, Cheng did odd jobs at his father (Director of EMI Asia)'s company EMI— which included doing backing vocalist for the likes of Alan Tam and Priscilla Chan — during summers as a youth. The lessons were apparently effective, as producers started taking notice of Cheng's voice and he was signed to a recording contract soon thereafter. Cheng first shot to popularity in Taiwan before returning home and enjoying some success in Hong Kong. However, his singing career went into a lull from 2000 to 2003 due to the infamous \"air rage incident\", when, on a flight from Los Angeles to Taipei, he became drunk and had an altercation with the flight attendant and co-pilot.[2] However, Cheng's career rebounded later.\n\nCheng returned to the Cantopop market in 2003, however success for him did not arrive until 2005, where his signature song \"無賴\" (Rascal) was voted one of the Top 10 songs at various music award shows, notably TVB's Jade Solid Gold, where it was voted the most popular song of 2005.[3]\n\nCheng won his first Best Supporting Actor award for his performance in Vulgaria at the 32nd Hong Kong Film Award.[4]\n\nCheng's song 《MY ONLY ONE》was awarded one of the Top 10 golden songs organized by VivTV, 《Chill Club》, presented on 18 April 2021 [5]\n\nOn 23 April 2021, Cheng held Hong Kong's first outdoor drive-in concert, entitled《Drive in Ultra – WEE are Ronald Cheng》. Many celebrities showed up to help out, including Josie Ho Chiu-yi, Ekin Cheng, Candy Lo and Kelly Chen etc.[6]\n\nHis father, Norman Cheng (鄭東漢), is the chairperson and CEO of EMI, and formerly of the Asia Pacific division of PolyGram and then Universal Music.\n\nRonald Cheng started his relationship with Charlene Choi, a Hong Kong singer and actress, in 2004, after starring as lovers in the film Hidden Heroes. Their marriage was kept secret from the public, and they avoided going out together except for family gatherings.[7] In 2010, while Choi announced ending the relationship with Cheng, the press revealed that they had registered their marriage in Los Angeles, United States in 2006.[8][9] Both Cheng and Choi admitted to the marriage, but decided to divorce.[1] Later, he dated Sammie Yu Sze-man, then a hostess in Cable TV Hong Kong, and Yu gave birth to a daughter in July 2011. They married in the same year[10] and later had a son in 2015.\n\n1996\n\n左右為難 (In A Dilemma) – Mandarin Album\n\n別愛我 (Don't Love Me) – Mandarin Album\n\n1997\n\n情深 (Deep Love) – Cantonese Album\n\n最愛的人不是你 (You Are Not My Dearest Lover) – Mandarin EP\n\n絕口不提！愛你 (Never Say!
