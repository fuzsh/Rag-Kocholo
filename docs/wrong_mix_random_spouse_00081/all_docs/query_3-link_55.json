Due to citywide popularity, he’s had to add extra concert dates, and the final final additional show has been confirmed for February 19. Expect funny moments from the multi-talented artist who’s also fashioned himself as a bit of a comedian, as well as Cheng’s signature sweet crooning. Tickets are available from $488 to $988."
