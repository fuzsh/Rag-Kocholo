        "text": "The Straits Times\n\nWednesday, Feb 1, 2017\n\nSinger Ronald Cheng reunited with his former love, actress Miriam Yeung, on Sunday, providing a rousing end to his concert at the Hong Kong Coliseum.\n\nThey ended a brief romance in 1999, with the media blaming it on his womanising ways.\n\nBut on Sunday, all was forgotten as they sang a duet, held hands and hugged - although Yeung forgot her lyrics twice, saying her earpiece was faulty.\n\nIn the audience was former television anchor Sammie Yu, who Cheng, 44, married in 2011 following a secret marriage and divorce with singer Charlene Choi.\n\nYeung's husband, public relations consultant Real Ting, was absent.\n\nThe duo's performance came after Yeung, 42, presented Cheng with an award at the 2013 Hong Kong Film Awards."
