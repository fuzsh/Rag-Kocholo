        "text": "Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez from Democracy Now interview independent film maker David Riker and award-winning Australian actress Abbie Cornish who made a movie about what it means to be involved in the human trafficking of undocumented immigrants who do America’s work.\n\nThe Girl is an intimate story that reminds us that Mexicans and Central Americans are the people who care for our children, tend our gardens, and work in our fields to provide us with food. The story is told from the point-of-view of a young Texas woman who unwittingly becomes involved with The Girl, portrayed by Maritza Santiago from Oaxaca. Maritza was selected from 3,000 girls who tried out for the part when she was nine years old.\n\nIf you don’t do anything else today, please watch this video clip interview below and when the full-length feature film comes your way, please see it. Thank you! Opens March 8 in New York and March 16 in Los Angeles."
