This program is an introduction to the discipline of toxicology for undergraduate science majors and includes introductory toxicology lectures, sessions on graduate school, activities with an SOT mentor, and participation in scientific sessions. Formerly known as the Minority Undergraduate Program, in 2016 the criteria for selection were broadened to include students from races and ethnic groups underrepresented in the sciences (for example, African American, Hispanic, Native American, or Pacific Islander), first generation college students, Pell grant recipients or students from undergraduate institutions that do not confer graduate degrees in biomedical disciplines. Advisors who are not SOT members who meet the selection criteria are also eligible. Meeting registration and support for travel, lodging, and meals are provided for students and advisors. In the past, the program has been supported in part by NIH-MARC, NIEHS, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and other supporters.\n\nLearn More about the Student Award Learn More about the Advisor Award\n\nPrevious Award Recipients\n\nParticipants in the 2024 Undergraduate Diversity Program\n\nStudents\n\n2024……Amanda Adams, University of Arizona; Hailey Aragon, The University of New Mexico; Kai Brantley, Fort Lewis College; Whitney Davis, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University; Onamma Edeh, The University of New Mexico; Jan Fernández Román, Universidad de Puerto Rico en Arecibo; Gianina Garibaldi, Rio Hondo College; Omar Gonzalez, San Diego State University; Allison Harbolic, New Jersey Institute of Technology; Ashley Kaswer, John Jay College of Criminal Justice; Jaslin Lindsay, Fort Lewis College; Kaleb Lynum, Oakwood University; Rachel Majumder, University of Alabama at Birmingham; Taylor Massey, University of Arizona; Judith Matos, Universidad Ana G.
