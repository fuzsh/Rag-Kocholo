        "text": "The first Scene discovers a wilde Wood.\n\nThe attendant Spirit descends or enters.\n\nBefore the starry threshold of Joves Court\n\nMy mansion is, where those immortal shapes\n\nOf bright aÃ«real Spirits live insphear'd\n\nIn Regions milde of calm and serene Ayr,\n\nAbove the smoak and stirr of this dim spot, [ 5 ]\n\nWhich men call Earth, and with low-thoughted care\n\nConfin'd, and pester'd in this pin-fold here,\n\nStrive to keep up a frail, and Feaverish being\n\nUnmindfull of the crown that Vertue gives\n\nAfter this mortal change, to her true Servants [ 10 ]\n\nAmongst the enthron'd gods on Sainted seats.\n\nYet som there be that by due steps aspire\n\nTo lay their just hands on that Golden Key\n\nThat ope's the Palace of Eternity:\n\nTo such my errand is, and but for such, [ 15 ]\n\nI would not soil these pure Ambrosial weeds,\n\nWith the rank vapours of this Sin-worn mould.\n\nBut to my task. Neptune besides the sway\n\nOf every salt Flood, and each ebbing Stream,\n\nTook in by lot 'twixt high, and neather Jove, [ 20 ]\n\nImperial rule of all the Sea-girt Iles\n\nThat like to rich, and various gemms inlay\n\nThe unadorned bosom of the Deep,\n\nWhich he to grace his tributary gods\n\nBy course commits to severall goverment, [ 25 ]\n\nAnd gives them leave to wear their Saphire crowns,\n\nAnd weild their little tridents, but this Ile\n\nThe greatest, and the best of all the main\n\nHe quarters to his blu-hair'd deities,\n\nAnd all this tract that fronts the falling Sun [ 30 ]\n\nA noble Peer of mickle trust, and power\n\nHas in his charge, with temper'd awe to guide\n\nAn old, and haughty Nation proud in Arms:\n\nWhere his fair off-spring nurs't in Princely lore,\n\nAre coming to attend their Fathers state, [ 35 ]\n\nAnd new-entrusted Scepter, but their way\n\nLies through the perplex't paths of this drear Wood,\n\nThe nodding horror of whose shady brows\n\nThreats the forlorn and wand'ring Passinger.\n\nAnd here their tender age might suffer perill, [ 40 ]\n\nBut that by quick command from Soveran Jove\n\nI was dispatcht for their defence, and guard;\n\nAnd listen why, for I will tell ye now\n\nWhat never yet was heard in Tale or Song\n\nFrom old, or modern Bard in Hall, or Bowr. [ 45 ]\n\nBacchus that first from out the purple Grape,\n\nCrush't the sweet poyson of mis-used Wine\n\nAfter the Tuscan Mariners transform'd\n\nCoasting the Tyrrhene shore, as the winds listed,\n\nOn Circes Iland fell (who knows not Circe [ 50 ]\n\nThe daughter of the Sun? Whose charmed Cup\n\nWhoever tasted, lost his upright shape,\n\nAnd downward fell into a groveling Swine)\n\nThis Nymph that gaz'd upon his clustring locks,\n\nWith Ivy berries wreath'd, and his blithe youth, [ 55 ]\n\nHad by him, ere he parted thence, a Son\n\nMuch like his Father, but his Mother more,\n\nWhom therfore she brought up and Comus nam'd,\n\nWho ripe, and frolick of his full grown age,\n\nRoaving the Celtick, and Iberian fields, [ 60 ]\n\nAt last betakes him to this ominous Wood,\n\nAnd in thick shelter of black shades imbowr'd,\n\nExcells his Mother at her mighty Art,\n\nOffring to every weary Travailer,\n\nHis orient liquor in a Crystal Glasse, [ 65 ]\n\nTo quench the drouth of Phoebus, which as they taste\n\n(For most do taste through fond intemperate thirst)\n\nSoon as the Potion works, their human count'nance,\n\nTh' express resemblance of the gods, is chang'd\n\nInto some brutish form of Woolf, or Bear, [ 70 ]\n\nOr Ounce, or Tiger, Hog, or bearded Goat,\n\nAll other parts remaining as they were,\n\nAnd they, so perfect is their misery,\n\nNot once perceive their foul disfigurement,\n\nBut boast themselves more comely then before [ 75 ]\n\nAnd all their friends, and native home forget\n\nTo roule with pleasure in a sensual sty.\n\nTherfore when any favour'd of high Jove,\n\nChances to pass through this adventrous glade,\n\nSwift as the Sparkle of a glancing Star, [ 80 ]\n\nI shoot from Heav'n to give him safe convoy,\n\nAs now I do: But first I must put off\n\nThese my skie robes spun out of Iris Wooff,\n\nAnd take the Weeds and likenes of a Swain,\n\nThat to the service of this house belongs, [ 85 ]\n\nWho with his soft Pipe, and smooth-dittied Song,\n\nWell knows to still the wilde winds when they roar,\n\nAnd hush the waving Woods, nor of lesse faith,\n\nAnd in this office of his Mountain watch,\n\nLikeliest, and neerest to the present ayd [ 90 ]\n\nOf this occasion. But I hear the tread\n\nOf hatefull steps, I must be viewless now.\n\nComus enters with a Charming Rod in one hand, his Glass in the other, with him a rout of Monsters headed like sundry sorts of wilde Beasts, but otherwise like Men and Women, their Apparel glistering, they com in making a riotous and unruly noise, with Torches in their hands.\n\nComus. The Star that bids the Shepherd fold,\n\nNow the top of Heav'n doth hold,\n\nAnd the gilded Car of Day, [ 95 ]\n\nHis glowing Axle doth allay\n\nIn the steep Atlantick stream,\n\nAnd the slope Sun his upward beam\n\nShoots against the dusky Pole,\n\nPacing toward the other gole [ 100 ]\n\nOf his Chamber in the East.\n\nMean while welcom Joy, and Feast,\n\nMidnight shout, and revelry,\n\nTipsie dance and Jollity.\n\nBraid your Locks with rosie Twine [ 105 ]\n\nDropping odours, dropping Wine.\n\nRigor now is gone to bed,\n\nAnd Advice with scrupulous head,\n\nStrict Age, and sowre Severity,\n\nWith their grave Saws in slumber ly. [ 110 ]\n\nWe that are of purer fire\n\nImitate the Starry Quire,\n\nWho in their nightly watchfull Sphears,\n\nLead in swift round the Months and Years.\n\nThe Sounds, and Seas with all their finny drove [ 115 ]\n\nNow to the Moon in wavering Morrice move,\n\nAnd on the Tawny Sands and Shelves,\n\nTrip the pert Fairies and the dapper Elves;\n\nBy dimpled Brook, and Fountain brim,\n\nThe Wood-Nymphs deckt with Daisies trim, [ 120 ]\n\nTheir merry wakes and pastimes keep:\n\nWhat hath night to do with sleep?\n\nNight hath better sweets to prove,\n\nVenus now wakes, and wak'ns Love.\n\nCom let us our rights begin, [ 125 ]\n\nTis onely day-light that makes Sin,\n\nWhich these dun shades will ne're report.\n\nHail Goddesse of Nocturnal sport\n\nDark vaild Cotytto, t' whom the secret flame\n\nOf mid-night Torches burns; mysterious Dame [ 130 ]\n\nThat ne're art call'd, but when the Dragon woom\n\nOf Stygian darknes spets her thickest gloom,\n\nAnd makes one blot of all the ayr,\n\nStay thy cloudy Ebon chair,\n\nWherin thou rid'st with Hecat', and befriend [ 135 ]\n\nUs thy vow'd Priests, till utmost end\n\nOf all thy dues be done, and none left out,\n\nEre the blabbing Eastern scout,\n\nThe nice Morn on th' Indian steep\n\nFrom her cabin'd loop hole peep, [ 140 ]\n\nAnd to the tel-tale Sun discry\n\nOur conceal'd Solemnity.\n\nCom, knit hands, and beat the ground,\n\nIn a light fantastick round.\n\nThe Measure.\n\nBreak off, break off, I feel the different pace, [ 145 ]\n\nOf som chast footing neer about this ground.\n\nRun to your shrouds, within these Brakes and Trees,\n\nOur number may affright: Som Virgin sure\n\n(For so I can distinguish by mine Art)\n\nBenighted in these Woods. Now to my charms, [ 150 ]\n\nAnd to my wily trains, I shall e're long\n\nBe well stock't with as fair a herd as graz'd\n\nAbout my Mother Circe. Thus I hurl\n\nMy dazling Spells into the spungy ayr,\n\nOf power to cheat the eye with blear illusion, [ 155 ]\n\nAnd give it false presentments, lest the place\n\nAnd my quaint habits breed astonishment,\n\nAnd put the Damsel to suspicious flight,\n\nWhich must not be, for that's against my course;\n\nI under fair pretence of friendly ends, [ 160 ]\n\nAnd well-plac't words of glozing courtesie,\n\nBaited with reasons not unplausible\n\nWind me into the easie-hearted man,\n\nAnd hugg him into snares. When once her eye\n\nHath met the vertue of this Magick dust, [ 165 ]\n\nI shall appear som harmles Villager\n\nWhom thrift keeps up about his Country gear,\n\nBut here she comes, I fairly step aside\n\nAnd hearken, if I may, her busines here.\n\nThe Lady enters.\n\nThis way the noise was, if mine ear be true, [ 170 ]\n\nMy best guide now, me thought it was the sound\n\nOf Riot, and ill-manag'd Merriment,\n\nSuch as the jocund Flute, or gamesom Pipe\n\nStirs up among the loose unleter'd Hinds,\n\nWhen for their teeming Flocks, and granges full [ 175 ]\n\nIn wanton dance they praise the bounteous Pan,\n\nAnd thank the gods amiss. I should be loath\n\nTo meet the rudeness, and swill'd insolence\n\nOf such late Wassailers; yet O where els\n\nShall I inform my unacquainted feet [ 180 ]\n\nIn the blind mazes of this tangl'd Wood?\n\nMy Brothers when they saw me wearied out\n\nWith this long way, resolving here to lodge\n\nUnder the spreading favour of these Pines,\n\nStept as they se'd to the next Thicket side [ 185 ]\n\nTo bring me Berries, or such cooling fruit\n\nAs the kind hospitable Woods provide.\n\nThey left me then, when the gray-hooded Eev'n\n\nLike a sad Votarist in Palmers weed\n\nRose from the hindmost wheels of Phoebus wain. [ 190 ]\n\nBut where they are, and why they came not back,\n\nIs now the labour of my thoughts; 'tis likeliest\n\nThey had ingag'd their wandring steps too far,\n\nAnd envious darknes, e're they could return,\n\nHad stole them from me, els O theevish Night [ 195 ]\n\nWhy shouldst thou, but for som fellonious end,\n\nIn thy dark lantern thus close up the Stars,\n\nThat nature hung in Heav'n, and fill'd their Lamps\n\nWith everlasting oil, to give due light\n\nTo the misled and lonely Travailer? [ 200 ]\n\nThis is the place, as well as I may guess,\n\nWhence eev'n now the tumult of loud Mirth\n\nWas rife, and perfet in my list'ning ear,\n\nYet nought but single darknes do I find.\n\nWhat might this be? A thousand fantasies [ 205 ]\n\nBegin to throng into my memory\n\nOf calling shapes and beckning shadows dire,\n\nAnd airy tongues, that syllable mens names\n\nOn Sands, and Shoars, and desert Wildernesses.\n\nThese thoughts may startle well, but not astound [ 210 ]\n\nThe vertuous mind, that ever walks attended\n\nBy a strong siding champion Conscience. â â\n\nO welcom pure-ey'd Faith, white-handed Hope,\n\nThou hov'ring Angel girt with golden wings,\n\nAnd thou unblemish't form of Chastity, [ 215 ]\n\nI see ye visibly, and now beleeve\n\nThat he, the Supreme good, t' whom all things ill\n\nAre but as slavish officers of vengeance,\n\nWould send a glistring Guardian if need were\n\nTo keep my life and honour unassail'd. [ 220 ]\n\nWas I deceiv'd, or did a sable cloud\n\nTurn forth her silver lining on the night?\n\nI did not err, there does a sable cloud\n\nTurn forth her silver lining on the night,\n\nAnd casts a gleam over this tufted Grove. [ 225 ]\n\nI cannot hallo to my Brothers, but\n\nSuch noise as I can make to be heard farthest\n\nIle venter, for my new enliv'n'd spirits\n\nPrompt me; and they perhaps are not far off.\n\nSONG.\n\nSweet Echo, sweetest Nymph that liv'st unseen [ 230 ]\n\nWithin thy airy shell\n\nBy slow Meander's margent green,\n\nAnd in the violet imbroider'd vale\n\nWhere the love-lorn Nightingale\n\nNightly to thee her sad Song mourneth well. [ 235 ]\n\nCanst thou not tell me of a gentle Pair\n\nThat likest thy Narcissus are?\n\nO if thou have\n\nHid them in some flowry Cave,\n\nTell me but where [ 240 ]\n\nSweet Queen of Parly, Daughter of the Sphear,\n\nSo maist thou be translated to the skies,\n\nAnd give resounding grace to all Heav'ns Harmonies.\n\nCom. Can any mortal mixture of Earths mould\n\nBreath such Divine inchanting ravishment? [ 245 ]\n\nSure somthing holy lodges in that brest,\n\nAnd with these raptures moves the vocal air\n\nTo testifie his hidd'n residence;\n\nHow sweetly did they float upon the wings\n\nOf silence, through the empty-vaulted night [ 250 ]\n\nAt every fall smoothing the Raven doune\n\nOf darknes till it smil'd: I have oft heard\n\nMy mother Circe with the Sirens three,\n\nAmidst the flowry-kirtl'd Naiades\n\nCulling their Potent hearbs, and balefull drugs, [ 255 ]\n\nWho as they sung, would take the prison'd soul,\n\nAnd lap it in Elysium, Scylla wept,\n\nAnd chid her barking waves into attention,\n\nAnd fell Charybdis murmur'd soft applause:\n\nYet they in pleasing slumber lull'd the sense, [ 260 ]\n\nAnd in sweet madnes rob'd it of it self,\n\nBut such a sacred, and home-felt delight,\n\nSuch sober certainty of waking bliss\n\nI never heard till now. Ile speak to her\n\nAnd she shall be my Queen. Hail forren wonder [ 265 ]\n\nWhom certain these rough shades did never breed\n\nUnlesse the Goddes that in rurall shrine\n\nDwell'st here with Pan, or Silvan, by blest Song\n\nForbidding every bleak unkindly Fog\n\nTo touch the prosperous growth of this tall Wood. [ 270 ]\n\nLa. Nay gentle Shepherd ill is lost that praise\n\nThat is addrest to unattending Ears,\n\nNot any boast of skill, but extreme shift\n\nHow to regain my sever'd company\n\nCompell'd me to awake the courteous Echo [ 275 ]\n\nTo give me answer from her mossie Couch.\n\nCo. What chance good Lady hath bereft you thus?\n\nLa. Dim darknes, and this heavy Labyrinth.\n\nCo. Could that divide you from neer-ushering guides?\n\nLa. They left me weary on a grassie terf. [ 280 ]\n\nCo. By falshood, or discourtesie, or why?\n\nLa. To seek i'th vally som cool friendly Spring.\n\nCo. And left your fair side all unguarded, Lady?\n\nLa. They were but twain, and purpos'd quick return.\n\nCo. Perhaps fore-stalling night prevented them. [ 285 ]\n\nLa. How easie my misfortune is to hit!\n\nCom. Imports their loss, beside the present need?\n\nLa. No less then if I should my brothers loose.\n\nCo. Were they of manly prime, or youthful bloom?\n\nLa. As smooth as Hebe's their unrazor'd lips. [ 290 ]\n\nCo. Two such I saw, what time the labour'd Oxe\n\nIn his loose traces from the furrow came,\n\nAnd the swink't hedger at his Supper sate;\n\nI saw them under a green mantling vine\n\nThat crawls along the side of yon small hill, [ 295 ]\n\nPlucking ripe clusters from the tender shoots,\n\nTheir port was more then human, as they stood;\n\nI took it for a faÃ«ry vision\n\nOf som gay creatures of the element\n\nThat in the colours of the Rainbow live [ 300 ]\n\nAnd play i'th plighted clouds. I was aw-strook,\n\nAnd as I past, I worshipt: if those you seek,\n\nIt were a journey like the path to Heav'n\n\nTo help you find them. La. Gentle villager\n\nWhat readiest way would bring me to that place? [ 305 ]\n\nCo. Due west it rises from this shrubby point.\n\nLa. To find out that, good Shepherd, I suppose,\n\nIn such a scant allowance of Star-light,\n\nWould overtask the best Land-Pilots art,\n\nWithout the sure guess of well-practiz'd feet. [ 310 ]\n\nCo. I know each lane, and every alley green\n\nDingle or bushy dell of this wilde Wood,\n\nAnd every bosky bourn from side to side\n\nMy daily walks and ancient neighbourhood,\n\nAnd if your stray attendance be yet lodg'd, [ 315 ]\n\nOr shroud within these limits, I shall know\n\nEre morrow wake, or the low roosted lark\n\nFrom her thach't pallat rowse, if otherwise\n\nI can conduct you Lady to a low\n\nBut loyal cottage, where you may be safe [ 320 ]\n\nTill further quest'. La. Shepherd I take thy word,\n\nAnd trust thy honest offer'd courtesie,\n\nWhich oft is sooner found in lowly sheds\n\nWith smoaky rafters, then in tapstry Halls\n\nAnd Courts of Princes, where it first was nam'd, [ 325 ]\n\nAnd yet is most pretended: In a place\n\nLess warranted then this, or less secure\n\nI cannot be, that I should fear to change it,\n\nEie me blest Providence, and square my triall\n\nTo my proportion'd strength. Shepherd lead on. â â [ 330 ]\n\nThe two Brothers.\n\nEld. Bro. Unmuffle ye faint stars, and thou fair Moon\n\nThat wontst to love the travailers benizon,\n\nStoop thy pale visage through an amber cloud,\n\nAnd disinherit Chaos, that raigns here\n\nIn double night of darknes, and of shades; [ 335 ]\n\nOr if your influence be quite damm'd up\n\nWith black usurping mists, som gentle taper\n\nThough a rush Candle from the wicker hole\n\nOf som clay habitation visit us\n\nWith thy long levell'd rule of streaming light, [ 340 ]\n\nAnd thou shalt be our star of Arcady,\n\nOr Tyrian Cynosure. 2 Bro. Or if our eyes\n\nBe barr'd that happines, might we but hear\n\nThe folded flocks pen'd in their watled cotes,\n\nOr sound of pastoral reed with oaten stops, [ 345 ]\n\nOr whistle from the Lodge, or village cock\n\nCount the night watches to his feathery Dames,\n\nT' would be som solace yet, som little chearing\n\nIn this close dungeon of innumerous bowes.\n\nBut O that haples virgin our lost sister [ 350 ]\n\nWhere may she wander now, whether betake her\n\nFrom the chill dew, amongst rude burrs and thistles?\n\nPerhaps som cold bank is her boulster now\n\nOr 'gainst the rugged bark of som broad Elm\n\nLeans her unpillow'd head fraught with sad fears. [ 355 ]\n\nWhat if in wild amazement, and affright,\n\nOr while we speak within the direful grasp\n\nOf Savage hunger, or of Savage heat?\n\nEld. Bro. Peace brother, be not over-exquisite\n\nTo cast the fashion of uncertain evils; [ 360 ]\n\nFor grant they be so, while they rest unknown,\n\nWhat need a man forestall his date of grief,\n\nAnd run to meet what he would most avoid?\n\nOr if they be but false alarms of Fear,\n\nHow bitter is such self-delusion? [ 365 ]\n\nI do not think my sister so to seek,\n\nOr so unprincipl'd in vertue's book,\n\nAnd the sweet peace that goodnes boosoms ever,\n\nAs that the single want of light and noise\n\n(Not being in danger, as I trust she is not) [ 370 ]\n\nCould stir the constant mood of her calm thoughts,\n\nAnd put them into mis-becoming plight.\n\nVertue could see to do what vertue would\n\nBy her own radiant light, though Sun and Moon\n\nWere in the flat Sea sunk. And Wisdoms self [ 375 ]\n\nOft seeks to sweet retired Solitude,\n\nWhere with her best nurse Contemplation\n\nShe plumes her feathers, and lets grow her wings\n\nThat in the various bussle of resort\n\nWere all to ruffl'd, and somtimes impair'd. [ 380 ]\n\nHe that has light within his own cleer brest\n\nMay sit i'th center, and enjoy bright day,\n\nBut he that hides a dark soul, and foul thoughts\n\nBenighted walks under the mid-day Sun;\n\nHimself is his own dungeon. [ 385 ]\n\n2 Bro. Tis most true\n\nThat musing meditation most affects\n\nThe Pensive secrecy of desert cell,\n\nFar from the cheerfull haunt of men, and herds,\n\nAnd sits as safe as in a Senat house,\n\nFor who would rob a Hermit of his Weeds, [ 390 ]\n\nHis few Books, or his Beads, or Maple Dish,\n\nOr do his gray hairs any violence?\n\nBut beauty like the fair Hesperian Tree\n\nLaden with blooming gold, had need the guard\n\nOf dragon watch with uninchanted eye, [ 395 ]\n\nTo save her blossoms, and defend her fruit\n\nFrom the rash hand of bold Incontinence.\n\nYou may as well spred out the unsun'd heaps\n\nOf Misers treasure by an out-laws den,\n\nAnd tell me it is safe, as bid me hope [ 400 ]\n\nDanger will wink on Opportunity,\n\nAnd let a single helpless maiden pass\n\nUninjur'd in this wilde surrounding wast.\n\nOf night, or lonelines it recks me not,\n\nI fear the dred events that dog them both, [ 405 ]\n\nLest som ill greeting touch attempt the person\n\nOf our unowned sister.\n\nEld. Bro. I do not brother,\n\nInferr as if I thought my sisters state\n\nSecure without all doubt, or controversie:\n\nYet where an equall poise of hope and fear [ 410 ]\n\nDoes arbitrate th' event, my nature is\n\nThat I encline to hope, rather then fear,\n\nAnd gladly banish squint suspicion.\n\nMy sister is not so defenceless left\n\nAs you imagine, she has a hidden strength [ 415 ]\n\nWhich you remember not.\n\n2 Bro. What hidden strength,\n\nUnless the strength of Heav'n, if you mean that?\n\nEld. Bro. I mean that too, but yet a hidden strength\n\nWhich if Heav'n gave it, may be term'd her own:\n\n'Tis chastity, my brother, chastity: [ 420 ]\n\nShe that has that, is clad in compleat steel,\n\nAnd like a quiver'd Nymph with Arrows keen\n\nMay trace huge Forests, and unharbour'd Heaths,\n\nInfamous Hills, and sandy perilous wildes,\n\nWhere through the sacred rayes of Chastity, [ 425 ]\n\nNo savage fierce, Bandite, or mountaneer\n\nWill dare to soyl her Virgin purity,\n\nYea there, where very desolation dwels\n\nBy grots, and caverns shag'd with horrid shades,\n\nShe may pass on with unblench't majesty, [ 430 ]\n\nBe it not don in pride, or in presumption.\n\nSom say no evil thing that walks by night\n\nIn fog, or fire, by lake, or moorish fen,\n\nBlew meager Hag, or stubborn unlaid ghost,\n\nThat breaks his magick chains at curfeu time, [ 435 ]\n\nNo goblin or swart FaÃ«ry of the mine,\n\nHath hurtfull power o're true virginity.\n\nDo ye beleeve me yet, or shall I call\n\nAntiquity from the old Schools of Greece\n\nTo testifie the arms of Chastity? [ 440 ]\n\nHence had the huntress Dian her dred bow,\n\nFair silver-shafted Queen for ever chaste,\n\nWherwith she tam'd the brinded lioness\n\nAnd spotted mountain pard, but set at nought\n\nThe frivolous bolt of Cupid, gods and men [ 445 ]\n\nFear'd her stern frown, and she was queen oth' Woods.\n\nWhat was that snaky-headed Gorgon sheild\n\nThat wise Minerva wore, unconquer'd Virgin,\n\nWherwith she freez'd her foes to congeal'd stone?\n\nBut rigid looks of Chaste austerity [ 450 ]\n\nAnd noble grace that dash't brute violence\n\nWith sudden adoration, and blank aw.\n\nSo dear to Heav'n is Saintly chastity,\n\nThat when a soul is found sincerely so,\n\nA thousand liveried Angels lacky her, [ 455 ]\n\nDriving far off each thing of sin and guilt,\n\nAnd in cleer dream, and solemn vision\n\nTell her of things that no gross ear can hear,\n\nTill oft convers with heav'nly habitants\n\nBegin to cast a beam on th' outward shape, [ 460 ]\n\nThe unpolluted temple of the mind,\n\nAnd turns it by degrees to the souls essence,\n\nTill all be made immortal: but when lust\n\nBy unchaste looks, loose gestures, and foul talk,\n\nBut most by leud and lavish act of sin, [ 465 ]\n\nLets in defilement to the inward parts,\n\nThe soul grows clotted by contagion,\n\nImbodies, and imbrutes, till she quite loose\n\nThe divine property of her first being.\n\nSuch are those thick and gloomy shadows damp [ 470 ]\n\nOft seen in Charnell vaults, and Sepulchers\n\nLingering, and sitting by a new made grave,\n\nAs loath to leave the body that it lov'd,\n\nAnd link't it self by carnal sensualty\n\nTo a degenerate and degraded state. [ 475 ]\n\n2 Bro. How charming is divine Philosophy!\n\nNot harsh, and crabbed as dull fools suppose,\n\nBut musical as is Apollo's lute,\n\nAnd a perpetual feast of nectar'd sweets,\n\nWhere no crude surfet raigns. Eld. Bro. List, list, I hear [ 480 ]\n\nSom far off hallow break the silent Air.\n\n2 Bro. Methought so too; what should it be?\n\nEld. Bro. For certain\n\nEither som one like us night-founder'd here,\n\nOr els som neighbour Wood-man, or at worst,\n\nSom roaving Robber calling to his fellows. [ 485 ]\n\n2 Bro. Heav'n keep my sister, agen agen and neer,\n\nBest draw, and stand upon our guard.\n\nEld. Bro. Ile hallow,\n\nIf he be friendly he comes well, if not,\n\nDefence is a good cause, and Heav'n be for us.\n\nThe attendant Spirit habited like a Shepherd.\n\nThat hallow I should know, what are you? speak; [ 490 ]\n\nCom not too neer, you fall on iron stakes else.\n\nSpir. What voice is that, my young Lord? speak agen.\n\n2 Bro. O brother, 'tis my fathers Shepherd sure.\n\nEld. Bro. Thyrsis? Whose artful strains have oft delaid\n\nThe huddling brook to hear his madrigal, [ 495 ]\n\nAnd sweeten'd every muskrose of the dale,\n\nHow cam'st thou here good Swain? hath any ram\n\nSlip't from the fold, or young Kid lost his dam,\n\nOr straggling weather the pen't flock forsook?\n\nHow couldst thou find this dark sequester'd nook? [ 500 ]\n\nSpir. O my lov'd masters heir, and his next joy,\n\nI came not here on such a trivial toy\n\nAs a stray'd Ewe, or to pursue the stealth\n\nOf pilfering Woolf, not all the fleecy wealth\n\nThat doth enrich these Downs, is worth a thought [ 505 ]\n\nTo this my errand, and the care it brought.\n\nBut O my Virgin Lady, where is she?\n\nHow chance she is not in your company?\n\nEld. Bro. To tell thee sadly Shepherd, without blame,\n\nOr our neglect, we lost her as we came. [ 510 ]\n\nSpirit. Ay me unhappy! then my fears are true.\n\nEld. Bro. What fears good Thyrsis? Prethee briefly shew.\n\nSpir. Ile tell ye, 'tis not vain, or fabulous,\n\n(Though so esteem'd by shallow ignorance)\n\nWhat the sage PoÃ«ts taught by th' heav'nly Muse, [ 515 ]\n\nStoried of old in high immortal vers\n\nOf dire Chimera's and inchanted Iles,\n\nAnd rifted Rocks whose entrance leads to hell,\n\nFor such there be, but unbelief is blind.\n\nWithin the navil of this hideous Wood, [ 520 ]\n\nImmur'd in cypress shades a Sorcerer dwels\n\nOf Bacchus, and of Circe born, great Comus,\n\nDeep skill'd in all his mothers witcheries,\n\nAnd here to every thirsty wanderer,\n\nBy sly enticement gives his banefull cup, [ 525 ]\n\nWith many murmurs mixt, whose pleasing poison\n\nThe visage quite transforms of him that drinks,\n\nAnd the inglorious likenes of a beast\n\nFixes instead, unmoulding reasons mintage\n\nCharacter'd in the face; this have I learn't [ 530 ]\n\nTending my flocks hard by i'th hilly crofts,\n\nThat brow this bottom glade, whence night by night\n\nHe and his monstrous rout are heard to howl\n\nLike stabl'd wolves, or tigers at their prey,\n\nDoing abhorred rites to Hecate [ 535 ]\n\nIn their obscured haunts of inmost bowres.\n\nYet have they many baits, and guileful spells\n\nTo inveigle and invite th' unwary sense\n\nOf them that pass unweeting by the way.\n\nThis evening late by then the chewing flocks [ 540 ]\n\nHad ta'n their supper on the savoury Herb\n\nOf Knot-grass dew-besprent, and were in fold,\n\nI sate me down to watch upon a bank\n\nWith Ivy canopied, and interwove\n\nWith flaunting Hony-suckle, and began [ 545 ]\n\nWrapt in a pleasing fit of melancholy\n\nTo meditate my rural minstrelsie,\n\nTill fancy had her fill, but ere a close\n\nThe wonted roar was up amidst the Woods,\n\nAnd fill'd the Air with barbarous dissonance, [ 550 ]\n\nAt which I ceas't, and listen'd them a while,\n\nTill an unusual stop of sudden silence\n\nGave respite to the drowsie frighted steeds\n\nThat draw the litter of close-curtain'd sleep.\n\nAt last a soft and solemn breathing sound [ 555 ]\n\nRose like a steam of rich distill'd Perfumes,\n\nAnd stole upon the Air, that even Silence\n\nWas took e're she was ware, and wish't she might\n\nDeny her nature, and be never more\n\nStill to be so displac't. I was all eare, [ 560 ]\n\nAnd took in strains that might create a soul\n\nUnder the ribs of Death; but O ere long\n\nToo well I did perceive it was the voice\n\nOf my most honour'd Lady, your dear sister.\n\nAmaz'd I stood, harrow'd with grief and fear, [ 565 ]\n\nAnd O poor hapless Nightingale thought I,\n\nHow sweet thou sing'st, how neer the deadly snare!\n\nThen down the Lawns I ran with headlong hast\n\nThrough paths, and turnings oft'n trod by day,\n\nTill guided by mine ear I found the place [ 570 ]\n\nWhere that damn'd wisard hid in sly disguise\n\n(For so by certain signes I knew) had met\n\nAlready, ere my best speed could prÃ¦vent,\n\nThe aidless innocent Lady his wish't prey,\n\nWho gently ask't if he had seen such two, [ 575 ]\n\nSupposing him som neighbour villager;\n\nLonger I durst not stay, but soon I guess't\n\nYe were the two she mean't, with that I sprung\n\nInto swift flight, till I had found you here,\n\nBut furder know I not. 2 Bro. O night and shades, [ 580 ]\n\nHow are ye joyn'd with hell in triple knot\n\nAgainst th' unarmed weakness of one Virgin\n\nAlone, and helpless! Is this the confidence\n\nYou gave me Brother? Eld. Bro. Yes, and keep it still,\n\nLean on it safely, not a period [ 585 ]\n\nShall be unsaid for me: against the threats\n\nOf malice or of sorcery, or that power\n\nWhich erring men call Chance, this I hold firm;\n\nVertue may be assail'd, but never hurt,\n\nSurpriz'd by unjust force, but not enthrall'd, [ 590 ]\n\nYea even that which mischief meant most harm,\n\nShall in the happy trial prove most glory.\n\nBut evil on it self shall back recoyl,\n\nAnd mix no more with goodness, when at last\n\nGather'd like scum, and setl'd to it self [ 595 ]\n\nIt shall be in eternal restless change\n\nSelf-fed, and self-consum'd; if this fail,\n\nThe pillar'd firmament is rott'nness,\n\nAnd earths base built on stubble. But com let's on.\n\nAgainst th' opposing will and arm of Heav'n [ 600 ]\n\nMay never this just sword be lifted up,\n\nBut for that damn'd magician, let him be girt\n\nWith all the greisly legions that troop\n\nUnder the sooty flag of Acheron,\n\nHarpyies and Hydra's, or all the monstrous forms [ 605 ]\n\n'Twixt Africa, and Inde, Ile find him out,\n\nAnd force him to restore his purchase back,\n\nOr drag him by the curls, to a foul death,\n\nCurs'd as his life.\n\nSpir. Alas good ventrous youth,\n\nI love thy courage yet and bold Emprise, [ 610 ]\n\nBut here thy sword can do thee little stead;\n\nFarr other arms, and other weapons must\n\nBe those that quell the might of hellish charms,\n\nHe with his bare wand can unthred thy joynts,\n\nAnd crumble all thy sinews. [ 615 ]\n\nEld. Bro. Why, prethee Shepherd\n\nHow durst thou then thy self approach so neer\n\nAs to make this relation?\n\nSpir. Care and utmost shifts\n\nHow to secure the Lady from surprisal,\n\nBrought to my mind a certain Shepherd Lad\n\nOf small regard to see to, yet well skill'd [ 620 ]\n\nIn every vertuous plant and healing herb\n\nThat spreads her verdant leaf to th' morning ray,\n\nHe lov'd me well, and oft would beg me sing,\n\nWhich when I did, he on the tender grass\n\nWould sit, and hearken even to ecstasie, [ 625 ]\n\nAnd in requitall ope his leather'n scrip,\n\nAnd shew me simples of a thousand names\n\nTelling their strange and vigorous faculties;\n\nAmongst the rest a small unsightly root,\n\nBut of divine effect, he cull'd me out; [ 630 ]\n\nThe leaf was darkish, and had prickles on it,\n\nBut in another Countrey, as he said,\n\nBore a bright golden flowre, but not in this soyl:\n\nUnknown, and like esteem'd, and the dull swayn\n\nTreads on it daily with his clouted shoon, [ 635 ]\n\nAnd yet more med'cinal is it then that Moly\n\nThat Hermes once to wise Ulysses gave;\n\nHe call'd it HÃ¦mony, and gave it me,\n\nAnd bade me keep it as of sovran use\n\n'Gainst all inchantments, mildew blast, or damp [ 640 ]\n\nOr gastly furies apparition;\n\nI purs't it up, but little reck'ning made,\n\nTill now that this extremity compell'd,\n\nBut now I find it true; for by this means\n\nI knew the foul inchanter though disguis'd, [ 645 ]\n\nEnter'd the very lime-twigs of his spells,\n\nAnd yet came off: if you have this about you\n\n(As I will give you when we go) you may\n\nBoldly assault the necromancers hall;\n\nWhere if he be, with dauntless hardihood, [ 650 ]\n\nAnd brandish't blade rush on him, break his glass,\n\nAnd shed the lushious liquor on the ground,\n\nBut sease his wand; though he and his curst crew\n\nFeirce signe of battail make, and menace high,\n\nOr like the sons of Vulcan vomit smoak, [ 655 ]\n\nYet will they soon retire, if he but shrink.\n\nEld. Bro. Thyrsis lead on apace, Ile follow thee,\n\nAnd som good angel bear a sheild before us.\n\nThe Scene changes to a stately Palace, set out with all manner of deliciousness; soft Musick, Tables spred with all dainties. Comus appears with his rabble, and the Lady set in an inchanted Chair, to whom he offers his Glass, which she puts by, and goes about to rise.\n\nComus. Nay Lady sit; if I but wave this wand,\n\nYour nervs are all chain'd up in Alabaster, [ 660 ]\n\nAnd you a statue; or as Daphne was\n\nRoot-bound, that fled Apollo,\n\nLa. Fool do not boast,\n\nThou canst not touch the freedom of my minde\n\nWith all thy charms, although this corporal rinde\n\nThou haste immanacl'd, while Heav'n sees good. [ 665 ]\n\nCo. Why are you vext, Lady? why do you frown?\n\nHere dwell no frowns, nor anger, from these gates\n\nSorrow flies farr: See here be all the pleasures\n\nThat fancy can beget on youthful thoughts,\n\nWhen the fresh blood grows lively, and returns [ 670 ]\n\nBrisk as the April buds in Primrose-season.\n\nAnd first behold this cordial Julep here\n\nThat flames, and dances in his crystal bounds\n\nWith spirits of balm, and fragrant Syrops mixt.\n\nNot that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone, [ 675 ]\n\nIn Egypt gave to Jove-born Helena\n\nIs of such power to stir up joy as this,\n\nTo life so friendly, or so cool to thirst.\n\nWhy should you be so cruel to your self,\n\nAnd to those dainty limms which nature lent [ 680 ]\n\nFor gentle usage, and soft delicacy?\n\nBut you invert the cov'nants of her trust,\n\nAnd harshly deal like an ill borrower\n\nWith that which you receiv'd on other terms,\n\nScorning the unexempt condition [ 685 ]\n\nBy which all mortal frailty must subsist,\n\nRefreshment after toil, ease after pain,\n\nThat have been tir'd all day without repast,\n\nAnd timely rest have wanted, but fair Virgin\n\nThis will restore all soon. [ 690 ]\n\nLa. 'Twill not, false traitor,\n\n'Twill not restore the truth and honesty\n\nThat thou hast banish't from thy tongue with lies,\n\nWas this the cottage, and the safe abode\n\nThou told'st me of? What grim aspects are these,\n\nThese oughly-headed Monsters? Mercy guard me! [ 695 ]\n\nHence with thy brew'd inchantments, foul deceiver,\n\nHast thou betrai'd my credulous innocence\n\nWith visor'd falshood and base forgery,\n\nAnd wouldst thou seek again to trap me here\n\nWith lickerish baits fit to ensnare a brute? [ 700 ]\n\nWere it a draft for Juno when she banquets,\n\nI would not taste thy treasonous offer; none\n\nBut such as are good men can give good things,\n\nAnd that which is not good, is not delicious\n\nTo a wel-govern'd and wise appetite. [ 705 ]\n\nCo. O foolishness of men! that lend their ears\n\nTo those budge doctors of the Stoick Furr,\n\nAnd fetch their precepts from the Cynick Tub,\n\nPraising the lean and sallow Abstinence.\n\nWherefore did Nature powre her bounties forth, [ 710 ]\n\nWith such a full and unwithdrawing hand,\n\nCovering the earth with odours, fruits, and flocks,\n\nThronging the Seas with spawn innumerable,\n\nBut all to please, and sate the curious taste?\n\nAnd set to work millions of spinning Worms, [ 715 ]\n\nThat in their green shops weave the smooth-hair'd silk\n\nTo deck her Sons; and that no corner might\n\nBe vacant of her plenty, in her own loyns\n\nShe hutch't th' all-worshipt ore and precious gems\n\nTo store her children with; if all the world [ 720 ]\n\nShould in a pet of temperance feed on Pulse,\n\nDrink the clear stream, and nothing wear but Frieze,\n\nTh' all-giver would be unthank't, would be unprais'd,\n\nNot half his riches known, and yet despis'd,\n\nAnd we should serve him as a grudging master, [ 725 ]\n\nAs a penurious niggard of his wealth,\n\nAnd live like Natures bastards, not her sons,\n\nWho would be quite surcharg'd with her own weight,\n\nAnd strangl'd with her waste fertility;\n\nTh' earth cumber'd, and the wing'd air dark't with plumes, [ 730 ]\n\nThe herds would over-multitude their Lords,\n\nThe Sea o'refraught would swell, & th' unsought diamonds\n\nWould so emblaze the forhead of the Deep,\n\nAnd so bestudd with Stars, that they below\n\nWould grow inur'd to light, and com at last [ 735 ]\n\nTo gaze upon the Sun with shameless brows.\n\nList Lady be not coy, and be not cosen'd\n\nWith that same vaunted name Virginity,\n\nBeauty is nature's coyn, must not be hoorded,\n\nBut must be currant, and the good thereof [ 740 ]\n\nConsists in mutual and partak'n bliss,\n\nUnsavoury in th' injoyment of it self.\n\nIf you let slip time, like a neglected rose\n\nIt withers on the stalk with languish't head.\n\nBeauty is natures brag, and must be shown [ 745 ]\n\nIn courts, at feasts, and high solemnities\n\nWhere most may wonder at the workmanship;\n\nIt is for homely features to keep home,\n\nThey had their name thence; course complexions\n\nAnd cheeks of sorry grain will serve to ply [ 750 ]\n\nThe sampler, and to teize the huswifes wooll.\n\nWhat need a vermeil-tinctur'd lip for that\n\nLove-darting eyes, or tresses like the Morn?\n\nThere was another meaning in these gifts,\n\nThink what, and be adviz'd, you are but young yet. [ 755 ]\n\nLa. I had not thought to have unlockt my lips\n\nIn this unhallow'd air, but that this Jugler\n\nWould think to charm my judgement, as mine eyes,\n\nObtruding false rules pranckt in reasons garb.\n\nI hate when vice can bolt her arguments, [ 760 ]\n\nAnd vertue has no tongue to check her pride:\n\nImpostor do not charge most innocent nature,\n\nAs if she would her children should be riotous\n\nWith her abundance, she good cateress\n\nMeans her provision onely to the good [ 765 ]\n\nThat live according to her sober laws,\n\nAnd holy dictate of spare Temperance:\n\nIf every just man that now pines with want\n\nHad but a moderate and beseeming share\n\nOf that which lewdly-pamper'd Luxury [ 770 ]\n\nNow heaps upon som few with vast excess,\n\nNatures full blessings would be well dispenc't\n\nIn unsuperfluous eeven proportion,\n\nAnd she no whit encomber'd with her store,\n\nAnd then the giver would be better thank't, [ 775 ]\n\nHis praise due paid, for swinish gluttony\n\nNe're looks to Heav'n amidst his gorgeous feast,\n\nBut with besotted base ingratitude\n\nCramms, and blasphemes his feeder. Shall I go on?\n\nOr have I said anough? To him that dares [ 780 ]\n\nArm his profane tongue with contemptuous words\n\nAgainst the Sun-clad power of Chastity,\n\nFain would I somthing say, yet to what end?\n\nThou hast nor Eare nor Soul to apprehend\n\nThe sublime notion, and high mystery [ 785 ]\n\nThat must be utter'd to unfold the sage\n\nAnd serious doctrine of Virginity,\n\nAnd thou art worthy that thou shouldst not know\n\nMore happines then this thy present lot.\n\nEnjoy your deer Wit, and gay Rhetorick [ 790 ]\n\nThat hath so well been taught her dazling fence,\n\nThou art not fit to hear thy self convinc't;\n\nYet should I try, the uncontrouled worth\n\nOf this pure cause would kindle my rap't spirits\n\nTo such a flame of sacred vehemence, [ 795 ]\n\nThat dumb things would be mov'd to sympathize,\n\nAnd the brute Earth would lend her nerves, and shake,\n\nTill all thy magick structures rear'd so high,\n\nWere shatter'd into heaps o're thy false head.\n\nCo. She fables not, I feel that I do fear [ 800 ]\n\nHer words set off by som superior power;\n\nAnd though not mortal, yet a cold shuddring dew\n\nDips me all o're, as when the wrath of Jove\n\nSpeaks thunder, and the chains of Erebus\n\nTo som of Saturn's crew. I must dissemble, [ 805 ]\n\nAnd try her yet more strongly. Com, no more,\n\nThis is meer moral babble, and direct\n\nAgainst the canon laws of our foundation;\n\nI must not suffer this, yet 'tis but the lees\n\nAnd setlings of a melancholy blood; [ 810 ]\n\nBut this will cure all streight, one sip of this\n\nWill bathe the drooping spirits in delight\n\nBeyond the bliss of dreams. Be wise, and taste.\n\nThe Brothers rush in with Swords drawn, wrest his Glass out of his hand, and break it against the ground; his rout make signe of resistance, but are all driven in; The attendant Spirit comes in.\n\nSpir. What, have you let the false enchanter scape?\n\nO ye mistook, ye should have snatcht his wand [ 815 ]\n\nAnd bound him fast; without his rod revers't,\n\nAnd backward mutters of dissevering power,\n\nWe cannot free the Lady that sits here\n\nIn stony fetters fixt and motionless;\n\nYet stay, be not disturb'd, now I bethink me, [ 820 ]\n\nSom other means I have which may be us'd,\n\nWhich once of MelibÅus old I learnt\n\nThe soothest Shepherd that ere pip't on plains.\n\nThere is a gentle Nymph not farr from hence,\n\nThat with moist curb sways the smooth Severn stream, [ 825 ]\n\nSabrina is her name, a Virgin pure,\n\nWhilom she was the daughter of Locrine,\n\nThat had the Scepter from his father Brute.\n\nThe guiltless damsell flying the mad pursuit\n\nOf her enraged stepdam Guendolen, [ 830 ]\n\nCommended her innocence to the flood\n\nThat stay'd her flight with his cross-flowing course,\n\nThe water Nymphs that in the bottom plaid,\n\nHeld up their pearled wrists and took her in,\n\nBearing her straight to aged Nereus Hall, [ 835 ]\n\nWho piteous of her woes, rear'd her lank head,\n\nAnd gave her to his daughters to imbathe\n\nIn nectar'd lavers strew'd with Asphodil,\n\nAnd through the porch and inlet of each sense\n\nDropt in Ambrosial Oils till she reviv'd, [ 840 ]\n\nAnd underwent a quick immortal change\n\nMade Goddess of the River; still she retains\n\nHer maid'n gentlenes, and oft at Eeve\n\nVisits the herds along the twilight meadows,\n\nHelping all urchin blasts, and ill luck signes [ 845 ]\n\nThat the shrewd medling Elf delights to make,\n\nWhich she with pretious viold liquors heals.\n\nFor which the Shepherds at their festivals\n\nCarrol her goodnes loud in rustick layes,\n\nAnd throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream [ 850 ]\n\nOf pancies, pinks, and gaudy Daffadils.\n\nAnd, as the old Swain said, she can unlock\n\nThe clasping charm, and thaw the numming spell,\n\nIf she be right invok't in warbled Song,\n\nFor maid'nhood she loves, and will be swift [ 855 ]\n\nTo aid a Virgin, such as was her self\n\nIn hard besetting need, this will I try\n\nAnd adde the power of som adjuring verse.\n\nSONG.\n\nSabrina fair\n\nListen where thou art sitting [ 860 ]\n\nUnder the glassie, cool, translucent wave,\n\nIn twisted braids of Lillies knitting\n\nThe loose train of thy amber-dropping hair,\n\nListen for dear honours sake,\n\nGoddess of the silver lake, [ 865 ]\n\nListen and save.\n\nListen and appear to us\n\nIn name of great Oceanus,\n\nBy the earth-shaking Neptune's mace,\n\nAnd Tethys grave majestick pace, [ 870 ]\n\nBy hoary Nereus wrincled look,\n\nAnd the Carpathian wisard's hook,\n\nBy scaly Tritons winding shell,\n\nAnd old sooth-saying Glaucus spell,\n\nBy Leucothea's lovely hands, [ 875 ]\n\nAnd her son that rules the strands,\n\nBy Thetis tinsel-slipper'd feet,\n\nAnd the Songs of Sirens sweet,\n\nBy dead Parthenope's dear tomb,\n\nAnd fair Ligea's golden comb, [ 880 ]\n\nWherwith she sits on diamond rocks\n\nSleeking her soft alluring locks,\n\nBy all the Nymphs that nightly dance\n\nUpon thy streams with wily glance,\n\nRise, rise, and heave thy rosie head [ 885 ]\n\nFrom thy coral-pav'n bed,\n\nAnd bridle in thy headlong wave,\n\nTill thou our summons answer'd have.\n\nListen and save.\n\nSabrina rises, attended by water-Nymphes, and sings.\n\nBy the rushy-fringed bank, [ 890 ]\n\nWhere grows the Willow and the Osier dank,\n\nMy sliding Chariot stayes,\n\nThick set with Agat and the azurn sheen\n\nOf Turkis blew, and Emrauld green\n\nThat in the channell strayes, [ 895 ]\n\nWhilst from off the waters fleet\n\nThus I set my printless feet\n\nO're the Cowslips Velvet head,\n\nThat bends not as I tread,\n\nGentle swain at thy request [ 900 ]\n\nI am here.\n\nSpir.

To the Ocean now I fly,\n\nAnd those happy climes that ly\n\nWhere day never shuts his eye,\n\nUp in the broad fields of the sky:\n\nThere I suck the liquid ayr [ 980 ]\n\nAll amidst the Gardens fair\n\nOf Hesperus, and his daughters three\n\nThat sing about the golden tree:\n\nAlong the crisped shades and bowres\n\nRevels the spruce and jocond Spring, [ 985 ]\n\nThe Graces, and the rosie-boosom'd Howres,\n\nThither all their bounties bring,\n\nThat there eternal Summer dwels,\n\nAnd West winds with musky wing\n\nAbout the cedar'n alleys fling [ 990 ]\n\nNard, and Cassia's balmy smels.\n\nIris there with humid bow,\n\nWaters the odorous banks that blow\n\nFlowers of more mingled hew\n\nThen her purfl'd scarf can shew, [ 995 ]\n\nAnd drenches with Elysian dew\n\n(List mortals, if your ears be true)\n\nBeds of Hyacinth and roses\n\nWhere young Adonis oft reposes,\n\nWaxing well of his deep wound [ 1000 ]\n\nIn slumber soft, and on the ground\n\nSadly sits th' Assyrian Queen;\n\nBut far above in spangled sheen\n\nCelestial Cupid her fam'd son advanc't,\n\nHolds his dear Psyche sweet intranc't [ 1005 ]\n\nAfter her wandring labours long,\n\nTill free consent the gods among\n\nMake her his eternal Bride,\n\nAnd from her fair unspotted side\n\nTwo blissful twins are to be born, [ 1010 ]\n\nYouth and Joy; so Jove hath sworn.\n\nBut now my task is smoothly don,\n\nI can fly, or I can run\n\nQuickly to the green earths end,\n\nWhere the bow'd welkin slow doth bend, [ 1015 ]\n\nAnd from thence can soar as soon\n\nTo the corners of the Moon."
