        "text": "Chihuahua dog, smallest recognized dog breed, named for the Mexican state of Chihuahua, where it was first noted in the mid-19th century. The Chihuahua is thought to have been derived from the Techichi, a small mute dog kept by the Toltec people of Mexico as long ago as the 9th century ce. Typically a saucy-looking alert dog that is sturdier than its small build would suggest, the Chihuahua stands about 5–8 inches (about 13–20 cm) tall at the withers and weighs 1 to 6 pounds (0.5 to 3 kg). It has a rounded head, large erect ears, prominent eyes, and a compact body. The coat is variable in colour and may be either smooth and glossy or long and soft. It is valued as a spirited companion especially suited to apartment living. The American Kennel Club formally recognized the Chihuahua in 1904.\n\nChihuahua breed facts other names Chi area of origin Mexico breed group toy height at withers 5–8 inches (13–20 cm) weight 1–6 pounds (0.5–3 kg) life span 14–16 years Did you know? Though the Xoloitzcuintli is the national dog of Mexico, the Chihuahua is the breed more often associated with the country. A Chihuahua named Gidget became a popular, if controversial, star of television commercials for Taco Bell in the late 1990s. In 2014 news organizations reported that Chihuahuas were “terrorizing” Maryvale, Arizona, U.S. Though overstated, packs of 8 to 12 Chihuahuas were loose in the city, due to overpopulation, often frightening residents.\n\nCare and upkeep\n\nThe Chihuahua’s exercise needs can be met by a small yard or even by the open space in an apartment. Daily walks or other outings can be added for mental stimulation. However, dog parks should be avoided because of the Chihuahua’s small size relative to other dogs. Owners should exercise great care to protect the Chihuahua from larger dogs and, in some locations, birds of prey. The breed should also be protected from falling objects, since many Chihuahuas will retain a large open molera (that is, the soft space on the skull), which makes them vulnerable to head injury, for a large part of their lives. Many Chihuahuas enjoy swimming in safe waters, such as those provided by a child’s backyard pool. Although Chihuahuas enjoy games and small toys, they are not particularly enthusiastic about retrieving.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAnimal Group Names\n\nBecause of their large body surface area compared with body volume, Chihuahuas tend to lose a lot of body heat. Neither the long-haired nor the short-haired variety of the breed handles cold weather very well, and their coat provides limited benefit. Coat care consists of occasional brushing and bathing, the smooth-coat Chihuahua needing brushing once per week and the long-coat variety requiring brushing two to three times per week. Chihuahuas have small teeth and jaws, so experts recommend a small-breed dog food. Puppies should be fed several small meals daily to prevent hypoglycemia, which can be deadly. Adults should be fed twice daily. Owners should be aware of the signs of a luxating patella, common in small dogs, in which the kneecap shifts out of alignment, causing hind-leg “skipping.”\n\nTemperament\n\nThe Chihuahua has a reputation as a lapdog, but in fact it is extremely energetic and would rather be running, playing, and barking than sleeping. (Generalizations about dog breeds are well established and widely accepted, but individual dogs may differ in behaviour from others of their breed.) It prefers the company of its family members, both human and canine, and is not generally outgoing with strangers. Chihuahuas can be feisty, with a persistent bark, and many are likely to challenge larger dogs. While most Chihuahuas are bold, others can be timid to the point of being nervous and jittery. Chihuahuas are fairly playful and affectionate. However, their small size can make them difficult to train. This can be a good breed for the elderly, as long as its exercise needs are met, but it is often too small to be a good breed for very young children, who can inadvertently harm the dog. This quick-to-bark breed can be an excellent watchdog, but it is an ineffective protection dog. It should be noted that these claims are a traditional and widely accepted generalization about the breed, and the behaviour of individual Chihuahuas may differ."
