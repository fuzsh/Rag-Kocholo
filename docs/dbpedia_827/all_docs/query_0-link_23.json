        "text": "It is with heavy hearts that the family of Carol Graves, wife of the late Vernon Graves, announces her passing which occurred on Tuesday, April 30, 2024, at Shannex Tucker Hall. Carol was born on July 3, 1937, in Saint John, NB, and was the daughter of the late Howard and Mary (Withers) Beyea.\n\nDuring her working years, Carol worked as a lab technician, in the Sussex, Moncton and Saint John General Hospitals. She then went on to teach first aid and was a volunteer ambulance driver. She was a devoted cub leader for 15 years, and some may remember her as “Silver Hawk”. Carol also worked as a receptionist for various medical offices in the Quispamsis area. She and Vernon have been residents of Quispamsis, since 1970 and there they made many dear and lifelong friends. They loved spending time at their cottage on the Bellisle Bay, and boating on the Bay Mist. In her spare time, Carol loved to spend time with her Quilting Guild and Garden Club companions. Carol was a longstanding member of True Life Church, which was another home to her. She was a loving and guiding mother who took time for her children. When her grandchildren and great-grandchildren came along, she was over the moon with excitement at seeing her family tree grow. Her passion for genealogy has been passed down to her family and her book on the Withers has become a treasure. She loved spending time with her special niece and nephew, Stuart and Catherine, which always brightened Carol’s day. Always caring for others in need of comfort, her and her special friend, Sydney Erb volunteered their free time at the Shannex where they were Chaplains, helping to spread the word and love of their Lord Jesus. Carol is survived by her children, Paul (April) Graves; Deborah (David) Settle; grandchildren: Ryan (Dominique) and Aaron Settle, Madison (Brett), Devon (Sarah) Graves and Sarah (Keith) Broome; great grandchildren: Drixon and Nova; as well as several nieces and nephews. Besides her parents and husband, Vernon, she was predeceased by her brother, Bryce Beyea and her special friend, Sydney Erb.\n\nResting at Kennebecasis Community Funeral Home, 152 Pettingill Rd, Quispamsis (506-849-2119), with visiting on Sunday, May 5, 2024, from 2:00-6:00 PM. A funeral service will be held on Monday, May 6, 2024, at 11:00 AM, from True Life Church, 30 Vincent Rd. Rothesay. Interment will take place in Riverbank Cemetery. For those unable to attend the service a livestream will be available by clicking the link on the left-hand side of Carol’s obituary. For those who wish, donations to CNIB or True Life Church would be appreciated by the family.\n\nThe family would like to extend a special thanks to the staff at Shannex, Tucker Hall and the Regional Hospital."
