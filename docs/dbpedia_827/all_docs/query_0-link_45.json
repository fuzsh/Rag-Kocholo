Keeping the husband and wife team theme strong, these wines are brought to us by Andrew and Kathleen Tow – a couple who lend their passions not only to quality wine production, but also to social and environmental responsibility and philanthropy, being only the second winery in the world certified as a B Corporation. Although somewhat new on the scene, The Withers has been rapidly accepted by sommeliers, wine critics and high end restaurants the world over. All eight of their wines have recieved multiple scores of 90+ points and above from publications such as Wine Enthsiast, Wine Spectator, Wine Enthusiast, Burghound, and more. Likewise, they are being poured in Michelin Star winning establishments including The French Laundry, Jean Georges, Marea, Aquavit, and many others. We’re proud to say that we’re now carrying their bottles on our wine list and in the wine shop. Don’t miss your chance to experience these special selections with our carefully crafted tastings and pairings!\n\nThursday, April 12th\n\nStarting at 6:30pm\n\n5 courses + curated wine tastings\n\n$150 per person (includes taxes and gratuity)"
