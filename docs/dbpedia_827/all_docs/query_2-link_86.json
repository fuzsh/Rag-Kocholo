sweater\n\nwhen I shook, when I cried, when I couldn’t even look him in the eye\n\nhe let me wear his sweater\n\nas I sweat and I trembled, tried to stand only to -once again- fall, breath so foul it could peel paper off walls\n\nhe pushed up the long sleeve… of this sweater he draped around me\n\nto hold a once contorted fist\n\nto even give it a gentle kiss\n\nwhy have I been so blind\n\nso

exchange for\n\nIndescribable pleasure\n\nMother knows\n\nOf this for sure\n\nMother knows\n\nStillness in the night\n\nAfter days of sleeplessness\n\nAnd trying to find\n\nThe way to become\n\nWhat

———\n\nTwo days later what do I say\n\nI scrolled down from that negative\n\ndesperate page\n\nSure the words were truth\n\nBut the feelings were rage\n\nand nothing good comes\n\nfrom sharing such pain\n\nWith room to breathe and time to think\n\nI feel my body coming back to me\n\nMy mind, never stops it seems, but its’ mastery\n\nis an entirely different thing\n\nSo in the moments I allow\n\nmyself to look and feel and be in the now\n\nThe now of that thought or memory\n\nSo often I feel – failed, defeat…\n\nWhen I hide inside myself\n\nand put my roots down in my mattress\n\nI can pretend that all these things never really happened\n\nBut they did, and there is always a consequence\n\nFor better or for worse\n\nFor life or for death\n\nI’ve weeded my deathbed\n\nand put my feet on the ground\n\nMy heart like a ‘field newly plowed’\n\nI’ve cleaned out my ears,\n\nAnd opened up the curtains\n\nlet the light in, even if it exposes the dirt herein\n\nYes the dirt herein is hard to breathe near\n\nSometimes I choke, and put a mask over my fear\n\nSometimes I feel like a phony, do I really feel that which I proclaim?\n\nSometimes I have to pretend… to be ok.\n\nBut as the sun, the dust, and distant giggles trickle in…\n\nMy heart skips a beat, but this time not\n\nbecause something is wrong\n\nIt’s a song… a sweet recognizable song\n\nAnd my youngest treasure is going over and over the same refrain …\n\n“Echad Mi Yodeah!” ( “I Know One”)\n\nSalvation is His Name\n\nIf I thought everything I fought for and scrubbed and sown\n\nwould all be surrendered and sullied and undone\n\nIf I believed I’d wrapped the entire Feast up in a garbage sack\n\nand drug it to the pyre…meanwhile breaking my back\n\nCrippled and incoherent, illegible and soiled\n\nTurns out that which had the true meaning… was absorbed\n\nand will last\n\nIt will last as long is it remains preserved\n\nLong as I don’t give up\n\nLong as I truly drink in the lessons learned\n\nWhat’s the proof of that?\n\nWell I suppose it will be when the axe is swung\n\nI won’t scream in despair, instead… I’ll duck\n\nI suppose the proof will come\n\nWhen the stones are thrown…\n\nI won’t stay crumbled in a lump,\n\nbut instead take hold of the hand Who lifts me up\n\nI guess that when the lashes fly ‘tearing flesh from bone’\n\nAnd rendering what took so much, was so hard to keep strong\n\nInto a pile of goo to be trampled on…\n\nI won’t add poison to that concoction of trauma\n\nAnd instead imbibe the healing living waters of\n\nwhat it really means to take hold of the Torah\n\nTonight as we celebrate rest and get a glimpse\n\nOf the eternal Shabbat I pray someday to experience\n\nWe also recall walking through the waters’ walls\n\nOut of Egypt, but there were still many pitfalls\n\nWhat state am I in walking through?\n\nNegative, desperate, filled with rage and pain?\n\nOr finally, finally, taking control of my mind and body\n\nLiving in the now instead of regretting the failed, defeated days…\n\nAm I planted in my bed and filth, or\n\nTilling up rotten old practices and habits and sowing for new growth?\n\nAm I hanging darkness over the broad day sun coming through,\n\nOr opening wide the phony excuses so that healing can take root…\n\nAs the spray of salt water and the rush of east wind kisses my face\n\nI take off the mask so I can breathe freely all that will take place\n\nWe’re still singing the songs we sang from beneath the Lamb’s blood\n\nWhen the Defender passed over the threshold to protect His beloved\n\nSometimes I look around\n\nAnd have no idea what is going on\n\nSometimes I feel like everything is going horrifically wrong\n\n“I Know One”… I still can sing the words to that song\n\nWhen there’s war, and murder…\n\nNot only in the world but in our hearts…\n\nWalking in faith through those waters,\n\nTruly is… the first and best place to ‘re-start’\n\nChag Pesach Sameach!\n\nShabbat Shalom!\n\nHashem split the sea, all we had to do was… see the Way.\n\nAnd what then\n\nwhat do I do\n\nEverything I’ve been through\n\nshouldn’t it be a testimony about You?\n\nBut what if I can’t word it\n\nwhat if nothing defines\n\nthe way You brought me to the edge\n\nto CAUSE me to find\n\nI was missing something\n\nEssential in my life\n\nI was moving onward…\n\nleaving valuables behind\n\nThere were times in great darkness\n\nI said, I couldn’t find you any place\n\nI couldn’t see, couldn’t feel, couldn’t\n\nimagine Your presence, Your face\n\nThere at the edge I looked over\n\nand said, ok… maybe on to the new dream\n\nThen you gently pushed me forward\n\nholding my weight by a garment with straining seams\n\nThere were moments I wished they’d just give\n\nand tear apart allowing me to plummet\n\ntimes when I wish You’d just finish the job\n\nand push me over the terrifying summit\n\nInstead what transpired\n\nis I found out how strong ties can be\n\nwhen they are Your chords of love\n\nYou encircles, entwined around me\n\nLeaning and dangling\n\nI stopped struggling\n\nand let You shape the story\n\nKnowing somehow, it’d continue, with You crowned\n\nin righteous glory\n\nWhat I thought was the worst thing to happen\n\nturned out to be a safety net from true disaster\n\nYou see the end from the beginning\n\nYou knew I wouldn’t fall, my soul’s Master\n\nRejecting Your correction\n\nblaming the enemy\n\nwhen it was You there on that cliff side\n\nYou were there… pushing, moving me\n\nYet, keeping me\n\nOnce unwound and unraveled the strands\n\nHow did I find myself?\n\nNaked and somehow unafraid\n\nbecause I landed in Your hand\n\nWhat is the rub?\n\nThe bottom line?\n\nWhere’s the crux?\n\nThe fact of the matter?\n\nThe Heart?\n\nIf I live for myself\n\nI’ve missed the point…\n\nI don’t need\n\nYou’ve given me everything\n\nDo You need me?\n\nIf I still breathe…\n\nThen yes.\n\nIt’s not about what I can do\n\nI can do nothing at all…\n\nIts about what You’ve put me here to do\n\nAnd sometimes You take us to the edge\n\nTo teach us\n\nHow to fall\n\nJanuary 10, 2022\n\nshe began to tell me something new\n\nnot separate not different but…deeper and true\n\nas she described her impression\n\nof the ceremonial repetition\n\nevery hair on the head of my pride stood erect\n\nhow could she describe all our moments like this\n\nthen a voice from the depths of the sparks in my soul\n\nbegged me: Listen, just listen and let\n\nyour self go\n\nShe spoke of an experience unique to each one\n\nbut once having consummated this Union, one knows\n\nwhat it was\n\nwhat it was she described with her heart in her hands\n\nwas experiencing God\n\noutside of all structured plans\n\nmy heart melted as I listened to my daughter confess\n\nit wasn’t at the communal table,\n\nnor the festive moon, nor the shofar, nor the bonfire,\n\nnor the starlit Sukkah\n\nbut in moments when she felt Him,\n\nand truly believed in sheer delight\n\nSo now I take this moment to truly deeply recognize\n\nsomething happened\n\nsomething wondrous\n\nand I almost let it pass me by\n\nSure, I’ve dedicated\n\nall the deepest parts of me\n\nto building structure\n\nfacilitating experience\n\ndecorating rooms I’d prayed to fill\n\nwith intention\n\nwith connection\n\nwith a model of chasing after His will\n\nand sure,\n\nI dream about it\n\nShabbos with my grandchildren\n\ngathered round\n\nthe gleaming tender leaves\n\nof my olive shoots\n\nsinging gleefully, jubilant, proud\n\nbut the truth that she\n\nhighlighted\n\nis a veracity each candid soul holds\n\nthe most moving lasting moments with God\n\n– are when we are all alone\n\nI wonder if you told me as a test perhaps to see\n\nif I’d diminish your experience and\n\nmake it all about me\n\nwhatever the purpose I thank you\n\nfor extending your thoughtful heart\n\nand I thank You my King for gifting that\n\noh my daughter… come and see…\n\nthis is only the start!\n\nDecember 17, 2021\n\nAnd then I eventually settle in at the keyboard\n\nI have not opened my new laptop\n\nThat laptop traded for points to “do God’s work”\n\nIt was said…\n\nI haven’t opened it in more than a week.\n\nI have not worked on anything.\n\nBut I have cried harder than I ever have in my 38 years\n\nI have sat in my closet reading my notes to myself\n\nIt was supposed to be a better self looking at those notes\n\nBut its not a better self\n\nIts a more honest self\n\nI have had my heart broken open in ways I never thought\n\nCould possibly lead to a blessing\n\nSo that is what I am hopeful for\n\nI thought\n\nHonestly I could never be honest about this\n\nWhirlwind, chaotic, unpin down able, un translatable jumble inside\n\nThere’s anger, because\n\nI wanted to be happy\n\nBecause I tried so hard to be happy\n\nI think someone might look at that and think…\n\nHappy just IS\n\nAnyone who has to TRY to be happy is deformed\n\nThat is what I am\n\nDisabled in many ways and deformed …\n\nBecause it takes an exerted effort every single day\n\nFor me\n\nTo try to be cheery, motivated, productive\n\nAnd when I am not\n\nAnd when my kid is getting F’s or destroying their room\n\nOr breaking our hearts in a variety of ways\n\nIt is not they\n\nBut I who FAIL\n\nWhen I can’t make the pain go away\n\nFor my love and I can’t help them get to where they so\n\nDesperately want go, to get to\n\nWhere every effort that took the heart of me\n\nIs just not anywhere near enough for them…\n\nI am left with nothing\n\nBUT\n\nYou keep going\n\nBecause you have no choice in the matter\n\nThese lives are far too precious\n\nAnd as bad of an example as being desperate enough to cry for hours in a ball…\n\nIts far worse of one example to give completely up\n\nI am tired of failing.\n\nTired of asking for help.\n\nTired of taking.\n\nTired of not being who God made me to be.\n\nTired of starting from square one.\n\nAgain. And again. And again. And again.\n\nAs I crumbled in His arms…\n\nHe showed me what I hadn’t taken into account.\n\nOk- so you’re really crying, you’ve really come to a place where you’ve allowed yourself to ‘let it all out’…\n\nAnd now you’re looking at is as despicable?\n\nBecause what?\n\nYou failed at this goal, or that?…\n\nI guess… you forgot how much you have been carrying.\n\nAnd maybe, you also forgot or didn’t realize how LONG you’ve been carrying it.\n\nMaybe you didn’t realize the value of what you were holding together…\n\nBecause it was a whole lot.\n\nHow many times did you put yourself last?\n\nHow many times did you forbid yourself to feel, to fail, to cry?\n\nDon’t you see… that I see everything\n\nEverything\n\nEverything you have not.\n\nEach time you glorified Me in your heart\n\nWith your life\n\nIn your deeds\n\nI know they don’t feel like ‘enough’ now…\n\nBut I assure you\n\nEach act of service was NOT a filthy rag before My sight.\n\nSo\n\nThe question is\n\nCan you live for that?\n\nKnowing that I know.\n\nKnowing that its ok to take a few hours in the closet.\n\nThat its ok to take a few days not doing\n\nanything.\n\nKnowing…\n\nThat as the puffiness in your eyes recedes\n\nAnd the clarity in your mind slowly takes root\n\nAnd the motivation in your soul… yes, takes its place\n\nSets its feet in the blocks at square one… again\n\nI will be there\n\nAs I always have been\n\nAlready\n\nAlready\n\nCheering you on.\n\nYou’re not going to win.\n\nBut you’re going to run.\n\nAnd keep running.\n\nBecause no matter how\n\nDesperate and alone you feel\n\nYou are not.\n\nSome people can just be happy.\n\nYour happy… it cost more.\n\nThat is perhaps why, when its real\n\nIts so intense\n\nIt’s such an offering to Me\n\nAnd I know, that is all you desire.\n\nSo –\n\nHow nice is that?\n\nHow sweet and kind and loving a God we serve.\n\nWhat oh what would life be like without Him?\n\nI wouldn’t be here, simple as that.\n\nSo now here is what I am choosing\n\nMaking a conscious choice to believe:\n\nEvery health goal I desire\n\nIf it accords with His will\n\nHe will provide me the strength and I will get there…\n\nIn His time.\n\nEvery family goal I long and work for\n\nIf it accords with His will\n\nHe will move the hearts involved and we will arrive there…\n\nIn His time.\n\nEvery career or monetary need or goal that exists…\n\nIf it accords with His will\n\nHe will make happen, and abundantly…\n\nIn His time.\n\nEvery spiritual undertaking I walk into\n\nIf it accords with His will\n\nHe will water, and feed, and make to flourish and blossom\n\nIn His time.\n\nDecember 1, 2021\n\nNovember 30, 2021\n\nShared with Your friends\n\nWho am I writing this for?\n\nDoes anyone who comes to a page to\n\nPour forth their humanity ever really… know?\n\nWho is listening\n\nWho cares\n\nBut more who does this touch?\n\nBecause whoever you are… I am you, you are me…\n\nI say that all the time when I teach…\n\nThat sounds crazy.\n\nTeach.\n\nThat word humbles me.\n\nThat is why I have retreated.\n\nI don’t feel worthy of teaching and I am\n\nDuly unworthy.\n\nBecause the struggle is…\n\nAm I holy enough to touch it\n\nHow dare I handle His words\n\nWith unclean hands\n\nBut when I hear criticism of the patriarchs or foremothers\n\nIt stings\n\nIts a judgment and critique from people\n\nFar removed from their…\n\nReckonings\n\nOf situations.\n\nWe do not know how many\n\nSleepless nights were spent.\n\nYet- we look at Sarai and say…\n\nHow could you offer forbidden fruit?\n\nOr, holy man… how could you take and eat of it?\n\nI tremble with the weight of my mistakes\n\nI cannot hold them any longer.\n\nSo… I fumble around my kitchen to made all the\n\nExpected delicacies\n\nAnd I cut and paste and …voila… to maybe\n\nAnd ooh or an awww…\n\nAnd then\n\nEventually I wonder\n\nWhat is it for?\n\nWho is it for?\n\nAnd then…\n\nMy child\n\nMy very smart\n\nBut very very naive\n\nTwo year old child\n\nRandomly,\n\nWithout prompt\n\nWithout present\n\nWithout sweet bribe\n\nComes up to me\n\nAnd wraps himself around my knees\n\nAnd clearly says…\n\nThank YOU for Channukah.\n\nTHAT, right there… is a very\n\nVery humbling thing\n\nTo be reminded that\n\nAs the imma (mother)\n\nAs the woman of the house…\n\nIf I don’t find a way\n\nNo one does\n\nThat if there weren’t…\n\nThese efforts made\n\nEven if- God forbid-\n\nrobotically…\n\nThey are paying into some future\n\nmemory…\n\nWhen our home felt\n\nWarm\n\nWhen there was\n\nLight here…\n\nAnd even if it seems like\n\nNo one is paying attention\n\nReally\n\nSomeone\n\nIs.\n\nI am made small\n\nBy the lavishing of love\n\nYou have bestowed upon me\n\nI am a complainer\n\nAnd a self ‘excuser’\n\nAnd I can always find a reason\n\n‘why.’ I forgot to tap into\n\nYour magnificent love.\n\nThere is nothing but it.\n\nI am sorry my eyes grew dim from …\n\nNoticing it.\n\nThank You for these precious lives\n\nAnd challenges\n\nTake me back\n\nTo the place\n\nWhere my heart\n\nFirst felt love\n\nWhen not even a moment\n\nWas reality\n\nWithout You there….\n\nI want to go back-\n\nBut only You can bring me there.\n\nLet these lights…\n\nGuide the way.\n\nOctober 12, 2021\n\nI wrote this in the hopes that it could help someone out there. Not just someone who is either familiar with addiction, nor someone who is in denial about their addiction… but also to friends and family members who wish their ‘loved one’ could just- get it together! It is a daily battle for some. Others will feel highly skeptical about the solution. But I testify that it can be done. By God’s hand and help.And the support of others who can relate, and the compassion of the sympathetic. **********************\n\nAddiction is convincing yourself that substance or device or vice or emotion is… worth the risk to reach into the alligator’s mouth to obtain.\n\nThere it sits, couched in his soft, wet, pink tonguethe deterrent for someone else… not ensnared by the sickness and delusion which is addiction\n\nthe razor sharp teeth or the powerful jawsor the aggressive animal instinct that could easily swallow you whole the reflex of terror which can snap in a millisecond\n\nBut for the addictyou consider…you devise a plan…you reason the result as being more valuable and worthy than the risk\n\nso you begin to reach, to stretch forth your hand…you delicately caress these pearly razors lying to yourself that they are an adornment making way for the ‘cause’ versus a deterrent you lovingly run your fingers over them bloodying your hands in the process until you can almost… reach your goal\n\nyou sense the humid stench of corpses that lie rotting in this reptiles innards but you persist basking in the foul breath as if it were a waft of sweet perfume closer still to the object of your unreasonable need\n\nthe addict soaks their hands and forearms in slimy congealed saliva… all to obtain the desire\n\nthey climb limb by limb into the patiently awaiting gates of destruction and eagerly approach doom Doom which is of no consequence in the moment\n\nin the distance is heard every reminder calling frantically… every truth beseeching lovingly… every warning… all effort to avoid contact with this predator the addict made in the past… all the people who believe in you… weeping for your survival… every verse… every song… every remedy or inspiration… or beautiful worthwhile uplifting verification you could need to believe: This is dangerous this is temporary this could be fatal this will never define who God make you to be… all call to you… call to you… halfway down the dragon’s throat- muffled, remote, inconsequential… you brush it off like a faintly humming gnat in your ear.\n\nAnd the addict proceeds. You’re inside, completely- there’s no turning back, you’ve got it there before you and it all seems to fit to be within reach so you indulge- there in the darkness of this hollow cave and suddenly with ferocious clamor the jaws snap shut. Doom. It is certain…\n\nThe addict knows this is true. There is no way out, and death is sure, but the addict continues to wallow in the passing pleasure imbibing, consuming, groaning in ecstasy there in the belly of the beast.\n\nLosing oxygen, losing consciousness…slowly but surely departing from vitality.\n\nThere is but one Hope- a Champion with a sharpened double edged sword… to come and fight the abomination the only rescue is the decapitation of this Monster. And He can and He will do it for you, the light will come in and He’ll rescue you from the consuming, seemingly inescapable fate… rescue- flinging you from the bile and waste and graveyard leavings.. He’ll clean your wounds out and wash your shame away and attend to the deep scars… that deceived you into first believing it was an explainable excuse to keep tracking, and approaching, and entering this brute attend to the root of the addiction… and give you a mission to control yourself to provide experience that others in danger can relate to… and perhaps be spared from… He will rebuild your life from the ground up, over and over and over again. Relapse and reversal are not the end… they are only a chance for a more meaningful beginning. You can not do it alone. You are not alone.\n\nAugust 23, 2021\n\nI sat there…sat there and wept at the magnificence of the mercy You lent I cried and prayed…I cried and cried and repented that was yesterday and the next day I turned away the discomfort had been relieved I had no reason to cleave going on about my way that was…that was yesterday so You… You took my breath away brought me right back to a place desperate and lost without You alone…alone I searched for You I…slinking in the shadows peeked into the Garden banquet peeping through the lattice covered completely with the filth of my deeds You noticed me… You noticed me Eyes fixed upon the naked diamond space revealing my gaze at Your Kingly grace I knew I couldn’t run or hide You’d seen me…seen me… now I can’t escape Your eyes … You rise pushing back the chair to walk in my direction into my soul You stare…as You approach my sin sticks in my throat wraps itself around me in shame I choke knees collapse I fall before You fall and fall … I fall before You and as You touch me in that place the blood returns to my purple face for there is life in Your hands and revival in Your embrace You left Your table to remind to remind me my fate is irrevocable because I am Thine forgetting the delicacies and the sweet wine the other prominent guests You’ve left behind we stride in step side by side I am my Beloved’s and my Beloved is mine…\n\nAugust 17, 2021\n\nmy eyes are moist the evidence of Your goodness brought to tears through Your kindness I backslid and begged for help You…didn’t keep me at arms length to show me, to teach me a lesson “Shame, shame!” No, You brought me into Your embrace. You lavished me with favor responding to my fear and request with grace, like a lovers kisses all over my salty tear soaked face the trees breathe as they move the rain water pools reflect the movement of life and spirit these children remind me of how far away I left ‘that place’ who am I today a cacophony of contradiction but every once in a while the noise and discord becomes aligned with Your will in me, Your image Divine and then a sound emerges can’t call it music call it fear of the Lord because it is manifest in this emission from the depths of me its energy is not of this world its like beholding a nation’s banner unfurled no matter the state of the State at that moment the colors, and shape of the history bring forth emotion you have seen the rock spoken to the rock struck the rock again and again and again and yet He still pours forth the proven potion Love Life Hope Devotion…every word that spills forth it moves mountains and man’s heart to change course how many times have I wondered ‘if I never strayed never wandered away…’ would it be between us… this way? Could I possibly comprehend “I need You!” Could I possibly comprehend “…from the trash heap…” You revived an aborted fetus from the refuse and blood of my designs You save, You fashion limitless capacity for running and returning what am I learning born again – it wasn’t just a one time thing so the question is does one have to experience taking upon oneself a contract with death flirting with disaster exposing oneself to the abhorrent in order to experience the Power of witnessing You… beat down the door over turning chairs whipping through the piles and piles of signed pledges “I do…” to addiction “I do…” to distortion “I do…” to depression”I do…” to pride like a storm of a whirlwind You find mine… unfurled is the evidence of my treachery, my lies, every time I chose my glory over Thine… with the same Fingers Who inscribed life for the whole world into stone… You tear to shreds that decree which would ban me from approach… “Mine!” as You scoop me from that den of delusion and we fly back here…to this day as I make these “sounds” from my deepest place my feeble way of saying, ‘Thanks…’for granting my request to again…be returned to this…our unique embrace.\n\nAugust 5, 2021\n\nA Poem For Elul…\n\nin the corridor intermission waiting room behind the rope ‘stay in line’ strap I feel like pushing past the barriers and racing through the entry door Heart quickening did I forge anything important? Nothing that’s ‘out there’ ‘back there’ really matters now\n\nEverything I thought I ‘had’ is about to be replaced\n\nelevated\n\nnone of it will matter in the same way So, what I come with I have, and what I look like\n\nI’ll be but only until I move on from this Hall of Anticipation and enter into change whose testimony speaks beyond the age I breathe and exhale… I imagine I’m finally let in These in authority of such things be it angels or ‘arms’ of Hashem, I see them smile slyly glancing at my eyes for they well know what I long for why I can scarcely contain my longing for my Beloved\n\nSo the ‘stay here’ chain is clicked free and bent before me and its all I can do not to sprint to the door It’s ajar and I burst through Golden sunrise or sunset both at once for although\n\neverything here is defined by the\n\nsacredness of time\n\nnothing about this time here will be reasonable definable or labeled… Golden\n\nwarm alive ripe… and endless sea of wheat and dreams You know them all. Where are You? This I’ll ask and although to the naked eye You cannot be seen\n\nthe unashamed reality is I’m already dancing in Your arms… ‘Not yet. Slow down. Let’s talk a while, this field is for vision… not yet romance. Let’s discuss the contents of your character\n\nand the essence of your motivation.’ No. I am not taken aback, not disappointed. I well know what being in this field with You means. And also-I know nothing at all. Not yet. I can’t help myself though…I’m lost, captive, to the way these golden beams reflect in the endless pools of Your vision and as You try to explain it to me I am sure I am as naive and simple as a baby\n\nin Your arms. Explain life to an infant? The feeling of closeness and that You’ve taken an interest in this…peasant’s desires? Its not hard to believe\n\nits the only thing worth believing.

I was alone with my thoughts in a crowded sea of people. So many faces, strangers, all one… bustling to get the last details together… to arrange meals, and pillows to recline on… inviting last minute and newly found friends, brothers. It all whirled by my as I slowly drug my worn leather sandals in the dirt. Eyes downturned… I decided I wouldn’t even come. I couldn’t show my face in this state. I’d never dare offer this sad, discontented heart, woeful, awful, unrepairable, unworthy. Then in the clamor… he found me, he looked on from afar, he saw me before I even knew myself. He told me all the things that they were saying about me. He told me so I could cry in his arms. And I did. I cried, then became angry… I couldn’t take it anymore, couldn’t hold it in any longer. I screamed. I shouted, I beat my breast and tore my garments. I released the roaring lion of betrayal, the tearing claws of resentment, the lashing tongue of denial and guilt…. and became in that place beside him… a processed, ground, raw, bloodied piece of flesh. Open to parts of myself I didn’t even realize I had. I’d been patching over with linen strips, soaked with the stench of decay and infection. These bandages all fell away when he breathed on me… and there I was. An open wound. Oozing in his hands. He kissed me with shimmering lips, brushed by the dew of heaven, the pure oil of joy, the salve of comfort. He kissed every single throbbing inch of me, soothing my pain… cauterizing my doubtfulness… sealing his promises with the kind of love that grants true healing. Healing that causes my open flesh to become a scar. A thick and complex layered tablet… upon which he now can surely, precisely, accurately and definitively etch his purposes upon. I receive him as he is and he took me as I was… and no doubt or pain or distortion can separate that which the king in glory has cast together. I lift my eyes… and all is as it was before, yet everything is different. In every conceivable way… nothing will ever go back to the normal I loathed. He took me from a sloppy, putrid, heel dragging dust inhaling disaster… and gave me royal garments he himself removed, from his own precious self… to be naked and abused, he clothed me in his glorious robes. He pressed a cool delectable swig of wine from the finest goblet… to my trembling salty tear soaked lips … while he tasted spittle and grime flung as if he were dung, while I drank to fill… he was emptied. He washed my feet, drizzling the finest perfumed fingertips gently around my toes… while he, hanging, throbbing in pain, encrusted with dry blood, leaving trails well worn for the fresh crimson to spill forth… he bled for my anointment. To waste this life, to say it is worthless… renders his sacrifice as filth. God forbid! I was worth his very life. So I will dance through the streets of Jerusalem now, I will fling dust into the air because I cannot cease from the joy of this magnificent purchase. I will sit among my loved ones, I will breathe in the sacred rites of these symbols, and I will trust that someday… I will find him alive- in me, unmistakable. I will recline like the royalty he has proven me to be, because I am his… entirely and alone. The lamb of God is not dead… and so I have everything to live for. To believe in. To remember because of Him.\n\nFather- Lord Yeshua, you have righted so many wrongs in order to deliver me whole to this Pesach seder. I cannot fathom all You have accomplished on my behalf. Make me into a better servant for You. Use my life to make others feel this… new.\n\nChag Pesach Sameach\n\nNovember 18, 2019\n\ncathedral in the wilderness\n\ncan I make pilgrimage again\n\nor can I tap into the moment when\n\nheavens

putrid burnt turkey bone smell since Sunday evening.\n\nI have spent the entire day scrubbing every inch of wall, ceiling bookshelf…\n\nin my heart I know that this is indeed the first phase of Pesach cleaning.\n\nI don’t know when I would have gotten to all this,\n\nespecially with the baby coming in March and Pesach being in April.\n\nSo God had a plan for that burnt stock pot.\n\nThis house is brighter and much more germ free. The clutter and continual food stuff will be ongoing until April and forevermore…\n\nbut I have learned something from this.\n\nAnd He has bestowed upon me a motivated head start.\n\nThe poem…\n\na

I never want to leave this embrace” Feeling the warmth of His presence all around me, more snug and secure than the quilt surrounding me.\n\nThe realization that I belong outside myself- outside all the things that tear me away from just reveling in His creation.\n\nThe smell of flowers more bright than their vibrant yellow color…\n\nbountiful baskets… the crunch of vegetables, still ripe from the harvest, decoration and nourishment that didn’t cost a dime, just some sweat, just some time. A reminder of all the labor that has brought us to this point.\n\nPeace between husband and wife, coming in agreement that everything piled up inside the house WILL be dealt with, but not this week, this week is for our relationship with Hashem and recognizing the need for only Him.\n\nWhat Sukkot gave me…\n\nunderstanding that seasons come and seasons go\n\nbut His appointed times are meant to last forever…\n\nthey are pictures of forever\n\nand I can taste it\n\nlike fruit that gives knowledge, that gives understanding, that grants life…. or at the very least, the inspiration to live life “better”.\n\nBittersweet- the last night…\n\nthank You for asking us to stay just a little longer.\n\n‘Don’t take up anything, there is no ceremony… no objects, just you and me and this place we’ve made together’\n\nFor [the] seven days [of Sukkot] you shall bring a fire offering to G‑d. On the eighth day, it shall be a holy convocation for you… It is a [day of] detention.\n\n—Leviticus 23:36\n\n[G‑d says to Israel,] “I have detained you [to remain] with Me.” This is analogous to a king who invited his sons to feast with him for a certain number of days, and when the time came for them to leave, he said: “My sons! Please, stay with me just one more day; it is difficult for me to part with you!”\n\n—Rashi’s commentary\n\nAbba, I don’t wanna go.\n\nA tear emerges gently rolls…\n\nMy child, it is time for you to know\n\nI never leave, how can I show…\n\nPlease Adonai I know the truth\n\nI know no matter where I go I can never lose You\n\nbut this week of pleasure made me believe\n\nin the power and the wonder in beautiful little things\n\nOh treasured one, so naive\n\nI have given You this season so that you could see\n\nrefining through the fires of repentance\n\nthen the chance to don change as your beautiful adornment\n\nand the dance we dance on this last night\n\nresplendant\n\nis meant to lead you back into your everyday life\n\nwith a renewed commitment\n\noh precious lover of my soul,\n\nallow me to remember when the walls enclose\n\nwhen no more I can smell the warmth of morning\n\nand taste the sounds of nature dawning\n\nwhen no longer I can feel the song of the stars\n\nor focus in on the peace You have etched into my heart\n\nas with everything I hold out you,\n\nIt is lasting everypresent\n\nif only you would choose\n\nto see it as such, and embrace it everyday\n\nthen my special child… in that way\n\nour time together at this Sukkot it will not fade\n\nso may it be my Lord, forever and amein!\n\nSeptember 27, 2019\n\nWhat does it mean to be holy? Kedusha – holiness is often misunderstood. There is a notion that holiness means to be totally disconnected from mundane reality; that it is sacred and something completely elevated. When we think of holy imagery we may imagine a monk sitting on the mountain top meditating and speaking gently, or someone else who stands detached from the day-to-day grind of work, computers and technology, changing diapers and cooking.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. To truly be holy means to be fully and passionately connected and identified with our inner self, while at the same having the capacity to express that through our day-to-day life.\n\nThe opposite of the word kodesh – holy, is the word chol – mundane. Interestingly, chol is also the same Hebrew word for sand. Why? Sand is unique from dirt in that no matter how much water you use to make the pieces stick, they ultimately remain separate entities and never really connect or join together. To be mundane means to be disconnected from our true purpose and meaning in life. The opposite is holiness which ultimately is the passionate connection to our soul, God and the pervasive purpose that exists within the fabric of creation.\n\nOn Yom Kippur, we temporarily leave the world behind and elevate our body to the place of our soul. We stop engaging in the material world by refraining from wearing comfortable shoes, showering, eating or drinking and spend the majority of the day in spiritual pursuits. Though we may see this as the holiest of holidays – the word choice of God in the Torah is tahara (see Leviticus 16:30) which means cleansing and healing.\n\nSukkot gives us the opportunity to connect our lives with true depth, beauty and meaning.\n\nBut on Sukkot, we don’t bring our body up to our soul, rather we bring our newly cleansed and clarified soul and vision back down into our body. We are meant to ask ourselves the question: “Now that I went through the ten days of repentance, how can I bring that down into my day to day life – to live as an expression of my deepest self?” The answer to that question is in the Sukkah.\n\nThe sukkah is a place where everything we do from eating and drinking to sleeping and shmoozing becomes elevated and sanctified because it’s being done within the context of a mitzvah, a divine commandment. The mitzvah of living in the sukkah affords us the opportunity to see what life would be like if everything we did was connected with true depth, beauty and meaning.\n\nThe Torah teaches us that to truly be a holy person, we need not run away from the world and up towards the soul, rather we must grab the world with all of its glory, identify and fill it with the majesty of our own unique divinity. This Sukkot, let us take the time to remember how high we reached on Yom Kippur and find many ways to channel those moments into our day to day lives and elevate even the little things.\n\n****************\n\nYou’re my happy place\n\none of my “the little things”\n\nyou test me\n\nyou impress me\n\nyou remind me of my faults\n\nand comfort me when I am exposed\n\nYou are special and you are loved\n\nyou bring light into our Sukkah\n\nand bind me to beauty\n\nthe simple beauty I so often brush aside\n\ntoo often put aside\n\nbut tonight you’re by my side…\n\nwherever we go\n\nwhatever you do\n\nI’ll always love and believe in you\n\nif a Sukkah’s heart is inside each one…\n\nthen you a pillar, constructing mine\n\nmaking me smile\n\nmaking me cry\n\nsweet and saucy\n\nlittle princess of the King\n\nmy prayers are for many more meaningful smiles\n\nand lasting memories…\n\nSeptember 29, 2018\n\nwhat the world had done\n\nand undone\n\nstripped me of the power\n\nto believe in myself\n\nit is pride it is futile\n\nis what the mockers chant\n\nsometimes their voices\n\nenclose and I tremble, helpless\n\nI cried\n\nwhat my King has done\n\nand undone\n\ncovered me with His armor\n\nput a sword in my hand\n\nreminded me I am a warrior\n\nat His behest and Command\n\nHis command, His command\n\nmy sword is the sickle\n\nand I will reap the strength He provides\n\ncleaving through the world and all its lies\n\ntearing at the base ripping up the roots\n\nof the bitterness that stole the power\n\nto believe in myself, passion to pursue truth\n\nI am a warrior\n\nin His armor clothed…\n\nsword in hand\n\nHe transforms\n\na simple palm branch\n\ninto might unmatched\n\nYou will hide Your face from my sins\n\nYou will beckon me with shofar readied for the battle\n\nI will unleash the beauty of love\n\nwith the smooth stones from my satchel\n\nwith the sweet smell of compassion\n\nprepared to give my life\n\nfor a nation\n\nfor justice\n\nat His command at any moment in time\n\nwhat has been done\n\ncannot be undone\n\nwhat You have fashioned\n\nwith the craftsmanship of the Highest skill\n\nis the capability to believe in a life lived for Your will\n\nYour Will, Your Will…\n\nalone\n\nancient and eternal words\n\ncarved into flesh remembered from the impressions in stone\n\nlike the olive leaf the dove clutched in claw\n\nlife from the Tree that existed from before time\n\nbearing Life, for all Who grasp Its unified unbroken line\n\nthroughout the unshifting unchanging plan of the Divine\n\nnow in your hands now in mine\n\nthe Last Campaign will not be one alone of sword\n\nbut prepared will be we, outfitted in the Torah\n\nequipped with the testimony of Yeshua…\n\nthis sword in my hands will ever turn\n\nsafeguarding and repeating His Teachings I have learned\n\nignighted my King, the passionate flame of this weaponry\n\nI remember I am Yours and that You first believed in me\n\n************\n\nTehillim 119; 49 Remember the word to Your servant, In which You have made me hope. 50 This is my comfort in my affliction, that Your word has revived me.51 The arrogant utterly deride me, yet I do not turn aside from Your Torah.\n\nTehillim 45; 2You are fairer than the sons of men; Grace is poured upon Your lips; Therefore God has blessed You forever. 3Gird Your sword on Your thigh, O Mighty One, In Your splendor and Your majesty! 4 And in Your majesty ride on victoriously, For the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness; Let Your right hand teach You awesome things. 5Your arrows are sharp; The peoples fall under You; Your arrows are in the heart of the King’s enemies. 6Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom. 7You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of joy above Your fellows.\n\nDevarim 8; 1“All the commandments that I am commanding you today you shall be careful to do, that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore to give to your forefathers. 2“You shall remember all the way which the LORD your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not.\n\nTehillim 51;9 Hide Your face from my sins And blot out all my iniquities.10Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me. 11Do not cast me away from Your presence And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. 12 Restore to me the joy of Your salvation And sustain me with a willing spirit. 13Then I will teach transgressors Your ways, And sinners will be converted to You.\n\nYirmeyahu 6;16This is what the LORD says: “Stand at the crossroads and look. Ask for the ancient paths: Where is the good way? Then walk in it and find rest for your souls.\n\nYirmeyahu 31;31Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. 32It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt—a covenant they broke, though I was a husband to them, ” declares the LORD. 33“But this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD.I will put My TORAH in their minds and inscribe it on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they will be My people.34No longer will each man teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the LORD,’ because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD.

to fix the table and the house”….No.\n\nIn the end I was with Hashem-\n\nthat’s the happiness, that’s the joy.\n\nThe light of righteous people is to be happy- no matter where you are, what you do, what you lack of- happy that you’re under the wings of Hashem.\n\nThat happiness is what will bring us to faith.”\n\n– Rav Dror on Pesach and Hashem in the Heart\n\nMay 11, 2017\n\nHow do express across the boards\n\nthe depths of my esteem for the women I adore\n\nthere is something about each one of you in this composition\n\nyou need not wonder ‘was I in mind?’, it was you,\n\nyou were the one.\n\nMotherhood starts with wonder-\n\nhow could it really be?\n\nThat I have become a vessel for creation\n\nlight to be witnessed and seen…\n\nif there is anything good you see in me\n\nit’s because I am a reflection of you\n\nI have learned from how you live\n\nand seen the reason behind the things that you do.\n\nThen comes the realization,\n\nI am not alive for myself anymore.\n\nI can feel it in the way I walk,\n\nI’ve been given more than I carried before.\n\nBecause of you I feel I can manage\n\nbecause you’ve stood there by my side,\n\nHelped me keep going when I felt weak and tired,\n\ngave me the insight to remain inspired.\n\nAnd with every good outcome, for every worthwhile gain\n\nthere is always some form, manifestation of pain.\n\nAs intensely we love, intensely we grieve…\n\nI was never alone when brought down to my knees.\n\nYou’ve given me a limb to grasp onto, to clasp\n\nwhen I believed in ‘succumb’, you reminded me:\n\npain doesn’t last.\n\nThen in separation, when you’re left to digest\n\nthe fact that life’s forever changed, when I faced the\n\ntoughest tests\n\nnot only did you lend me notes,\n\nbut brewed a pot with which\n\nwe could stay up for hours until hope was accomplished.\n\nNot only that but when I felt I couldn’t lift a lid\n\nyou tucked me in, and let me sleep, and took the wheel instead.\n\nWhat is a mother, what is a sister, a daughter,\n\nwho is a true friend…\n\nsomeone who can envision the best\n\ndespite what you actually do\n\nand helps you reach out toward lofty goals\n\nwho catches and caresses you\n\nwhen the leap becomes a little too bold\n\nwho shares a commonality\n\nin some genuine character quality\n\nbut also relishes the differences…\n\nwho forgives you\n\nwith sincerity\n\nand remembers\n\nwhat you\n\nreally\n\nmeant.\n\nI can not thank you with words,\n\nnot with phrases or rhymes…\n\nnot in gifts, devotion, dedication of time.\n\nJust this promise, perhaps it will bless your life,\n\nas you have so immensely enriched, enhanced,\n\nadorned all of mine.\n\nWhether through blood, or the binding coming from Above\n\nyour love is essential to everything I see, feel and do…inseparably etched\n\nI am only me…because I am a part of you.\n\nHappy mother’s day (early)\n\nMay 20, 2017\n\nTo celebrate Shabbat is to share in holiness:\n\nthe presence of eternity, a moment of

melody.\n\nWe delight in the song of the spirit, the joys of the good,\n\nthe grandeur of living in the face of eternity.\n\nTo celebrate Shabbat is to sense God’s Presence.\n\nHe sustains us even when our spirits falter.\n\nMay we deepen our spirituality and expand our compassion\n\nas we praise our Creator for the holiness of Shabbat.\n\nThis is why I love Shabbat\n\nwell\n\none of its myriad

light remains\n\n(as yours did when you were gone my table was alight with the lives who blessed our home).\n\nIt continues and is certain, as nothing else in this work a day world seems to be…\n\nIt is the proof that we are truly free.\n\nAnd the One Who freed us resides in its shine,\n\npeaceful, fulfilling, meaning full, Divine.\n\nThe very meaning of Shabbat is to become “re-souled”.\n\nOnce the spark is ignited one can’t help but take hold….\n\nand secret, well known, is that the light remains….\n\nthrough the night, through the week\n\nthroughout all of our days.\n\nWhat a God we serve

fast and looks forward\n\nto where one will be enabled to go….not what one is coming out of\n\nthe truth, the evidence, the witness of Your work\n\nis much stronger than the idle, hurtful, unreasonable, wicked tongue\n\nwhat passes from the slayer to the hearer in the shadows\n\ncan not undo what Your testimony has done\n\nto focus on the painful words and things that have caused us suffering\n\nwill become an overwhelming poison polluting every passage and vein\n\nI will sift out Your voice from the bitterness and know You too had something to share\n\nthen I will burn to ash in an unclean place all the filth, which first made me despair\n\nand leave it there\n\nand return to Your presence\n\nand ask You\n\nto wash me clean\n\nto help me to touch me again\n\nand show me\n\nYour great love\n\nin everything\n\nLord- I grow weary. I need Your love to heal me. Weary of worthless chatter, pointless gestures and unkind people. Weary of conniving manipulators and deceivers who in secret places plot the derailment of the capability to perform the mission You’ve graced me with. I know the truth is open and bare and will be revealed in the end. But I tire of waiting. I tire of failing. And I also know it wont end…not until the rectification of all things. Not until You return and teach each one of us Your idea of righteous judgment. I feel like giving up, but I also feel You with me. With You all is YES. I believe, give me your strength.\n\nShabbat Shalom!\n\nMarch 25, 2016\n\nMarch 19, 2016\n\nMarch 12, 2016\n\nMarch 5, 2016\n\nFebruary 26, 2016\n\nto burst\n\nto overflow\n\nI can no more control\n\nwhat my heart can no longer contain\n\nmanifold\n\nradiant Glow\n\ntorn open made to show\n\nwhat trembling words can not explain\n\nI can no longer hold it\n\nit is beyond me\n\nthis surrender\n\nthis magnificence\n\nso overwhelming\n\nwhile this falls short, the rest is a waste\n\nI can not express what my soul can’t contain\n\nso burn tiny spark, once more lit\n\nall creation, do you not yet see?\n\nHis splendor\n\nuntangling the mangled, unbinding every fence\n\nweaving truth, extravagance in the telling\n\nchaos into sort, dull bland drone to vivid taste\n\noh soul overflow what my King has pre arranged\n\nnot a word is by chance\n\nnot a moment an accident\n\na deliberate King\n\nand intentional instruments\n\nmake music my soul\n\nfrom that which I can not express….\n\nif only He can hear it,\n\neven more fitting that benefit.\n\ncan my eyes remember a sorrowful tear? it is awe that pours out and I remember no pain….nothing is grey, dark, cloudy or confused.

B’Shem Yeshua HaMashaic Amein\n\nShabbat Shalom!\n\nFebruary 5, 2016\n\nI find myself in a hazardous storm\n\nraging torrents violence far from norm\n\nthe words are like poison\n\nterror seizes like a convulsion\n\nand the dark cover spills forth\n\nin the midst of the panic I strain to hide\n\nI hear “Who made mouth for man, is it not I”\n\nand remember, not with man will I be justified\n\nbut by Your Name I will find my recompense\n\nand the pain subsides\n\nI find myself in the midst of the sea\n\nwaves tossing, agitating, beating and weakening me\n\nI go limp with fear and begin to drown\n\nwhen I remember Your courage, and I hear the sound\n\n“He"
