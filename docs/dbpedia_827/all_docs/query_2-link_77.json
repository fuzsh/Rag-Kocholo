        "text": "Dedication : TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLY, Earl of Southampton, and Baron of Tichfield. The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end; whereof this pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety. The warrant I have of your honourable disposition, not the worth of my untutored lines, makes it assured of acceptance. What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours. Were my worth greater, my duty would show greater; meantime, as it is, it is bound to your lordship, to whom I wish long life, still lengthened with all happiness. Your lordship's in all duty,WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.\n\nDedication: To the Right Honorable Henry Wriothesly, Earl of Southampton, and Baron of Tichfield:\n\nI have unending love to dedicate to you, sir; to be frank, this poem is just a trivial little piece of it. I know you'll accept it—not because my poetry is any good, but because you're a nice guy. Everything I've written is yours. What I'll write in the future is yours. And since you're a part of everything I do, I am yours, too. If I were a more powerful person, my service to you would be more valuable. As it is, I'm loyal to you, sir, and I wish you a long, happy life.\n\nYour faithful servant,\n\nWilliam Shakespeare\n\nArgument : Lucius Tarquinius, for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus, after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be cruelly murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs, not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages, had possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied withhis sons and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea. During which siege the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of Sextus Tarquinius, the king'sson, in their discourses after supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife: among whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they posted to Rome; and intending, by their secret and sudden arrival,to make trial of that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds his wife, though it werelate in the night, spinning amongst her maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or inseveral disports. Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece' beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and was, according to his estate, royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherouslystealeth into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight, hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius; and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause ofher sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins; and bearing the deadbody to Rome, Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a bitter invective against the tyranny of the king: wherewith thepeople were so moved, that with one consent and a general acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state government changed from kings to consuls.\n\nPlot Summary: After Lucius Tarquinius (nicknamed \"Superbus\" for his excessive pride) had his own father-in-law cruelly murdered, he ignored Roman laws and customs and didn't allow the people to vote. He took over the kingdom and took his followers and other Roman noblemen to attack Ardea. During the siege, the army leaders met one evening in a tent belonging to Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son. As they talked after dinner, everyone bragged about the virtues of their wives. Collatine praised his wife Lucrece's incomparable sexual morality. Having fun, they quickly went back to Rome to see if they could catch their wives (whom they'd just been bragging about) by surprise, to test them. Only Collatine's wife was found sewing with her maids, even though it was late at night. All the other ladies were found dancing and partying, or in bed with their lovers. At that point the noblemen admitted Collatine had won the contest, and that his wife was impressive. Afterward, Sextus Tarquinius was attracted to Lucrece's beauty, but he kept it to himself for the moment, and went back to the camp with the others. It wasn't long until he secretly snuck away. Lucrece entertained him and boarded him royally because he was a prince. That same night, he snuck into her room, violently raped her, and ran away in the morning. Poor Lucrece immediately sent messengers: one to her father in Rome and the other to Collatine in the camp. They arrived, her father accompanied by Junius Brutus and her husband accompanied by Publius Valerius. When they found Lucrece wearing mourning clothes, they demanded to know why she was grieving. After making them swear they would take revenge, she revealed the offender and the complete circumstances of his crime. Then, suddenly, she stabbed herself. After that, the men all unanimously agreed to destroy the entire hateful Tarquin family. They took the dead body to Rome. Brutus explained to people who the offender was, and told them about the horrible deed he had done, riling them up to rebel against the tyrannical king. The people were so moved that they united to force the Tarquins into exile, and the country's government changed from a monarchy to a democracy.\n\n\"If you do this, your actions will define you. You'll be a slave to them. You'll be stooping down to their level. You'll give these thoughts life, and they'll be the death of you. You'll be hated for and ashamed of what you did, and you'll hate yourself for being prideful enough to do it. A great man like you shouldn't be defined by something like this. A tree doesn't reach down to where a bush grows, does it? No. Bushes shrivel up at the foot of a tree.\n\n\"My darling daughter, when I looked at you I saw so much of my younger self; it was like looking in a mirror. But now when I look at you, you're not fresh and beautiful anymore; you're dark and old, and all I can see is bare-boned death before its time. You don't look like me anymore! You're no longer my mirror! I can't look at your beauty and see myself as I once was!"
