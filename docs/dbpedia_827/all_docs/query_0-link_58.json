They are grown about a mile from the Island Creeks right off of Saquish Beach (technically a part of the town of Plymouth) on the tidal lands next to Skip’s cottage. The cottage has been in the family since the days of the pilgrims, and he actually has a deed that proves that he owns the tidal area (only an oyster farmer would really care about this!). Anyway, the Aunt Dotty’s are also grown in trays, but are much more exposed at low tide, and for a longer period of time. They are named after Skip’s great aunt Dotty who was the last relative to live in the cottage year round.\n\nTasting Notes: The Aunt Dotty’s are the most savory of the bunch. While still salty, they have a complex acidity and fullness to them. They have the most intense flavor of the lot and we love them. Aunt Dotty oysters are the most petite oysters that we carry.\n\n×"
