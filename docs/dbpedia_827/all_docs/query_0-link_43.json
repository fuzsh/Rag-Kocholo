Predeceased by her daughter, Renata Elizabeth and her parents, Frank and Margaret Cantwell. Leaving to mourn, her husband of 46 years, Vince, and her son, Chris (Tara). Two brothers, Gerry Cantwell (Dorothy) and Ted Cantwell (Donna). Three sisters, Helena Bragg, Agnes Cantwell, and Regina Angel. Nieces: Godchild Trini Bragg, Lindsay Boland (Dave), Andria Cantwell and Ashlee Angel (Paul). Nephews: Steve Bragg (Lori), Jason Cantwell (Miriam), Scott Cantwell (Stacy), and Craig Cantwell, as well as a host of grandnieces and grandnephews. Special sister-in- law, Patricia Withers and her two daughters, Ann Marie Bishop and Kathy Hare. Also, a special, lifelong friend, Doreen Walsh Noseworthy. It was with Doreen in their carefree younger days that she began to travel – a journey that sparked a lifelong love and passion. Dolores’ travels led her to all corners of the world and spanned all 7 continents, sharing these adventures with her son Chris.\n\nDolores spent her early years with her parents and siblings at Cape Spear, living first in the building that is now a National Historic Site and later in the dwelling that is now the Cape Spear Café. Her father carried on the Cantwell tradition as lightkeeper, which ended with her brother, Gerry, being the last lightkeeper when the lighthouse became automated. Privately taught by her mother until she completed Grade eight, she then attended school at Holy Heart of Mary Regional High School and went on to earn a teaching degree at Memorial University. Her teaching career spanned 35 years, many of which were spent as vice principal of Presentation Convent School.\n\nWith her husband, Vince, she helped form the Eating Disorder Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador (EDFNL) almost twenty years ago. The organization was founded in memory of their daughter, Renata; and they have been the driving forces behind its success in providing caregiver support, in counselling them, and annual scholarships to deserving students who plan a career in the healthcare system.\n\nFuneral arrangements have been entrusted to Carnell’s, Freshwater Road. Cremation has taken place. No visitation. No flowers by request. Those wishing to can make donations to EDFNL in her name.\n\nVince and Chris are grateful to the doctors, nurses, and support staff of 5 North A for their exceptional care and compassion.\n\nA celebration of her life will be held at 10 am on Thursday, July 27 from St. Teresa’s Church, Mundy Pond Road. Inurnment to follow at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery."
