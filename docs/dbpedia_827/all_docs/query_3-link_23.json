        "text": "Three public spaces radiate from a gallery beyond the entry hall: a spacious dining room, a terrace through French doors, and the living room with its grand piano, massive fireplace, and western orientation toward views of sunsets over the bay and San Francisco beyond. The living room’s semi-circular firebox inscribes a stunningly geometric circle-in-a-square motif that is framed by both the wide, angular entry to the room and the fireplace itself. Large and welcoming, the living room became one of several places in the house where local groups such as the University of California, Berkeley Art Alumni Group regularly met.\n\nThe Genns began planning the Inverness house in the 1980s. They had chosen Esherick (a nephew of Pennsylvania furniture designer Wharton Esherick) in part because Nancy especially admired his McGuire house in Stinson Beach, another seaside enclave in Marin. Genn had a good idea of what she wanted: “I was clear about the functional aspects. For example I knew we wanted our bedroom to be nowhere near the guest bedrooms, but that didn’t make me an architect,” she says. Nor was she a passive client, however. She turned to Esherick for the bigger picture—the layout of the house, its relationship to the site, and for the light she was working so hard to capture in her paintings. “For a year we met regularly in his San Francisco office. I’d paint watercolors and bring them to meetings and he’d sketch during our meetings.” It was a conversation without words that produced a design the general outlines of which are Esherick’s—while the idiosyncrasies and many of the finishes echo Genn’s sensibilities."
