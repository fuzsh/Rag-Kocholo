Whilst there will always be the need for product photography on a white background, which I am able to offer in my studio, more and more companies are marketing their products as a lifestyle. This makes work so much more fun for everyone.\n\nIf you feel you are not creative, but love the catalogues that drop through your door, then don’t be afraid to aim for that. I work with clients to create ideas on a joint mood board on Pinterest. This helps with structuring a theme to match their branding, collecting props, sourcing a location to shoot at and generates a lot of enthusiasm for their products & services, which is why they are in business in the first place.\n\nI am sharing two very different businesses here, to highlight just how much can be achieved if the planning takes place before the shoot. Both were shot at my Terrace Cottage Studio, but this can be achieved at any location with the right props for your brand. My consultation meetings are complimentary and I’d love to hear from you, if you wish to draw your clients in with some lifestyle product photography.\n\nMy dog is available for model hire by the way and simply likes to be paid in biscuits.\n\nPetra Galligan is a crystal sound healer and her singing bowls are fascinating. She runs her company, Soundwise in Queniborough."
