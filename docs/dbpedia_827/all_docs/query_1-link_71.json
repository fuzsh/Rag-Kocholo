        "text": "> Martin Carthy > Songs > The Cottage in the Wood\n\nForty Miles / Forty Five Miles / The Cottage in the Wood / It Hails, It Rains\n\n[ Roud 608 ; Master title: Forty Miles ; G/D 5:983 ; TYG 36 ; Ballad Index LLab048 ; Bodleian Roud 608 ; GlosTrad Roud 608 ; Wiltshire 848 ; DT FORTYLNG ; Mudcat 147617 ; trad.]\n\nPaul & Liz Davenport: Down Yorkshire Lanes Katie Howson: Blyth Voices Mary and Nigel Hudleston: Songs of the Ridings Frank Kidson: Traditional Tunes Roy Palmer: Everymanâs Book of English Country Songs Frank Purslow: The Constant Lovers\n\nMartin Carthy sang The Cottage in the Wood on his 1974 album Sweet Wivelsfield. This recording was later included on his anthology The Collection. He noted:\n\nI have always thought of The Cottage in the Wood as being a fragment which, if taken one way was The Laird of the Windy Wa (Cold Haily Windy Night [which is on Carthyâs Landfall]) but if looked at another way is a totally different kettle of fish. What I did was to take it and combine it with another fragment collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams from one Billy Waggs called The Lady Looked Out or The Proud Pedlar and with the song part of a cante-fable collected from Kate Thompson by Kidson called One Moonlight Night (which incidentally was versified by Kidsonâs wife and called The Robber Groom). I added a couple of verses, and this is the result.\n\nBy the way, the title for Martin Carthyâs 1968 LP But Two Came By is from the line “I looked for one but two came by” in verse 13 of this song.\n\nDave Hillery sang Forty Miles in 1971 on his and Harry Boardmanâs Topic album of popular songs and verse from Lancashire and Yorkshire, Trans Pennine. They noted:\n\nIn the days when journeymen tramped from town to town seeking work, the problem of accommodation at the end of their regulation 40 miles in a day was a constant worry. Undoubtedly many of these men harboured the kind of fantasies contained in this song collected in Leeds by Frank Kidson. Kidsonâs Traditional Tunes prints two more Yorkshire versions of this song.\n\nFrank Hinchliffe sang It Hails, It Rains in a recording made by Mike Yates and Ruairidh and Alvina Greig at his home near Sheffield in July 1976. This recording was published a year later on his Topic album of traditional songs from South Yorkshire, In Sheffield Park and in 2001 on the Musical Traditions anthology of songs and tunes collected by Mike Yates, Up in the North and Down in the South. Mike Yates noted in the latter albumâs booklet:\n\nThe local popularity of this song, which is also known as Forty Long Miles, among numerous other titles, has been comparatively well documented. S.O. Addy, the local folklorist and antiquarian, printed it in his Household Tales and Traditional Remains (1895) and R.A. Gatty, who collected in the area both on his own and with Ralph Vaughan Williams, noted it from the singing of Mrs Duckinfield of Treeton. Frank Kidson also found several versions in Yorkshire, and there are 50 entries in Roud.\n\nFrankâs version includes the interesting rhythmic pattern in the last line of each verse which seems to be a consistent characteristic of the song in nearly all its variants. There are five other known sound recordings, but this is the only one available on CD.\n\nEwan MacColl sang Forty Miles in 1976 on his and Peggy Seegerâs Larrikin album of traditional and contemporary folk music, No Tyme Lyke the Present. He noted:\n\nThe Yorkshire collector, Frank Kidson, published three versions of this robust night-visiting song with the note that “it was very popular in Yorkshire in former years”. It was still a great favourite in upper Teesdale in the period between the two world wars. It is from there that the version given here comes. It was recorded from Mark Anderson, a retired lead miner.\n\nGraham Metcalfe sang Forty Miles in 1996 on his WildGoose CD Songs From Yorkshire and Other Civilisations. He noted:\n\nIn the days when journeymen travelled the country, finding accommodation after their regulation 40 miles wasnât always as fanciful as in this song. Source: Frank Kidson, collected from Mr. Holgate, Leeds.\n\nGeorge Withers sang Forty Five Miles on the 2004 Veteran anthology of folk songs sung in the West Country, Old Uncle Tom Cobleigh and All. John Howson noted:\n\nThis song appears in the Hammond and Gardiner manuscripts as Forty Long Miles, collected from Mrs Gulliver, Combe Florey, Somerset in 1905 and both Sabine Baring-Gould and Cecil Sharp collected versions in the West Country. Peter Kennedy recorded a version in Cornish from Joe Thomas of Constantine entitled Glaw, Kerer, Ergh Ow-Cul Yma. The song was popular all around the country often under the name Cottage by the Wood or Cold, Haily Rainy Night, and there are comparable stories in other countries. Brahms produced a setting of the German version Vergebliches StÃ¤ndchen and it was utilised by Burns in Oh! Open the Door. George learned his version from Harry Adams.\n\nCoope Boyes & Simpson sang It Hails, It Rains in 2005 on their No Masters CD of songs collected by Ralph Vaughan Williams, George Butterworth and Percy Grainger, Triple Echo.\n\nRob Williams sang Itâs Forty Long Miles in 2012 on his album of songs collected by the brothers Henry and Robert Hammond in 1905 from Jane Gulliford of Combe Florey, Outstanding Natural Beauty: Songs From around the Quantock Hills.\n\nPeter and Barbara Snape sang Forty Miles in 2016 on their CD Upward Onward. Barbara Snape noted:\n\nA traditional song printed in Frank Kidsonâs Traditional Tunes. It is a version of the old Scottish song Cold Haily Rainy Night. It was sung in Leeds and district as Mr Holgate and others remember it. It seems that journeymen travelled up to forty miles a day with their kit of tools to find work.\n\nWill Noble sang It Hails, It Rains on his 2017 Veteran CD Itâs Gritstone for Me. Brian Peters and John Howson noted:\n\n“This is another one from Frank Hinchliffe,” says Will. “I added the last verse because, when I sang it as I had learned it, the audience seemed to be waiting for more of an ending.” Again the song, though not a local one, was particular popular in Yorkshire.\n\nJack Rutter learned It Hails, It Rains from Frank Hinchliffeâs 1976 album and sang it on his 2017 CD Hills.\n\nLyrics\n\nMartin Carthy sings The Cottage in the Wood\n\nItâs of a cottage in a wood\n\nAll underneath a hill he stood,\n\nOf a cottage in the wood\n\nAll underneath the hill he stood,\n\nWhich I never seen before,\n\nWhich I never seen before.\n\nBy there come a pedlar man,\n\nThrough and through the woods he ran.\n\nBy there come the pedlar man,\n\nAs through and through the woods he ran.\n\nAnd he cried all at the door,\n\nAnd he cried all at the door:\n\n“Oh, itâs forty miles I travelled today,\n\nSpied a cottage by the way,\n\nForty miles I travelled today,\n\nI spied a cottage by the way\n\nWhich I never seen before,\n\nWhich I never seen before.”\n\nLady looked out of her window so high,\n\nShe saw the pedlar standing by.\n\nLady looked out of her window so high,\n\nShe saw the pedlar standing by.\n\n“Sing your song, you pedlar man,\n\nYour song you lately have begun.”\n\n“For me Mum and Dad are fast asleep,\n\nBrothers have gone to mind the sheep.\n\nMum and Dad are fast asleep,\n\nBrothers have gone to mind the sheep\n\nAnd I dare not let you in,\n\nAnd I dare not let you in.”\n\n“Oh, but it rains, it flows, it hails and snows,\n\nAnd I am wet all through my clothes.\n\nOh, it rains, it flows, it hails, it snows,\n\nAnd I am wet all through my clothes\n\nAnd I pray you let me in,\n\nAnd I pray you let me in.”\n\n“For me and my pack is worth twenty pound,\n\nAll in silver and gold to find.\n\nFor me and my pack is worth twenty pound,\n\nAll in silver and gold to find.\n\nFreely I would give it to thee\n\nAll to lie one night with thee.”\n\nAnd he has sworn by his hair of red\n\nHe would have her maidenhead.\n\nHe has sworn by his hair of red\n\nThat he would have her maidenhead.\n\nAnd he cried all at the door,\n\nAnd he cried all at the door.\n\n“Oh, but it rains, it flows, it hails, it snows,\n\nAnd I am wet all through my clothes.\n\nOh it rains, it flows, it hails, it snows,\n\nAnd I am wet all through my clothes.\n\nAnd I pray you let me in,\n\nI pray you let me in.”\n\n“No, kind sir, that never can be,\n\nThereâs nobody in the house by me.\n\nNo, kind sir, that never can be,\n\nThereâs nobody in the house by me.\n\nAnd I dare not let you in,\n\nI dare not let you in.”\n\n“You must read my riddle and read it right\n\nIf you would lie with me this night.\n\nYou must read my riddle and read it right\n\nIf you would lie with me this night.\n\nRiddle me reet and riddle me right,\n\nWhere was I on Saturday night?”\n\n“If water was my prison to be\n\nI would swim for liberty.\n\nIf water was my prison to be\n\nI would swim for liberty.\n\nSo what was the boat you built for me\n\nDown the woods and under a tree?”\n\n“For one moonlit night as I sat high\n\nI looked for one, but two came by.\n\nFor one moonlit night as I sat high\n\nI looked for one, but two came by.\n\nThe boughs did bend, the leaves did shake\n\nTo see the hole that the fox did make.”\n\nThe pedlar cursed, the pedlar swore,\n\nSo loudly beat all at the door.\n\nThe pedlar cursed, the pedlar swore,\n\nSo loudly beat all at the door.\n\n“Get you gone, you pedlar man,\n\nFor I know you and where youâre from.”\n\nAnd she has looked out of her window so high,\n\nSheâs spied her brothers come riding by.\n\nShe looked out of her window so high,\n\nSheâs spied her brothers come riding by.\n\n“Get you gone, you pedlar man,\n\nFor I know you and where youâre from.”\n\nSeven brothers came to the door,\n\nSo loudly they the horn did blow.\n\nSeven brothers came to the door,\n\nSo loudly they the horn did blow.\n\nDown on his knees the pedlar fall\n\nFor mercy he did shout and bawl.\n\n“Oh, itâs all night long your grave I made,\n\nAll day long in wait I laid.\n\nAll night long your grave I made,\n\nAnd all day long in wait I laid.”\n\nThe lady laughed, the lady sang,\n\nAs through the woods the pedlar ran.\n\nAround his heels the hounds they ran,\n\nAs round his head the bullets rang.\n\nRound his heels the hounds they ran,\n\nAs round his head the bullets rang.\n\nThe boughs did bend, the leaves did shake,\n\nTo hear the cries that the fox did make.\n\nFrank Hinchliffe sings It Hails, It Rains\n\nIt hails, it rains, it snows and blows,\n\nAnd I am wet through all me clothes.\n\nSo I pray thee love, let me in,\n\nSo I pray thee love let me in.\n\nTo let you in, that cannot be,\n\nThereâs no-one in this house but me.\n\nSo I dare not let you in,\n\nSo I dare not let you in.\n\nMe dad and mam, theyâre fast asleep,\n\nMe brother is up, but heâs with the sheep.\n\nSo I dare not let thee in,\n\nSo I dare not let thee in.\n\nHe turned him round, and whether to go,\n\nWhen sweet affections she did show.\n\nOh come, and Iâll let you in,\n\nOh come, and Iâll let you in.\n\nThey spent that night in sweet content,\n\nAnd the very next morning to church they went.\n\nAnd he made her his charming bride,\n\nAnd he made her his charming bride.\n\nGeorge Withers sings Forty Five Miles\n\nOh forty-five miles Iâve travelled today,\n\nI saw a fine cottage beside the highway,\n\nThat I never saw before, oh before,\n\nThat I never saw before.\n\nI boldly stepped up and I knocked at the door,\n\nAnd a pretty young lassie skipped over the floor,\n\nAnd I never saw her before, oh before,\n\nAnd I never saw her before.\n\nI said, “Love it hails, it rains and it snows,\n\nAnd I be wet through all my clothes.\n\nAnd I pray you open the door, oh the door,\n\nAnd I pray you open the door.”\n\n“Oh no, oh no, that never can be,\n\nFor no one should dwell in this house but me.\n\nAnd I dare not open the door, oh the door,\n\nAnd I dare not open the door.\n\nWell I turned myself round with miles to go,\n\nAnd the storm grew dark and the rain did blow.\n\nBut she called me back again, again,\n\nShe called me back again.\n\n“Take off they wet clothes love and put on some dry,\n\nAnd hop into bed here along with I.\n\nAnd merry we will be, we will be,\n\nAnd merry we will be.”\n\nThat night we spent in sweet content,\n\nAnd the very next day to the church we went,\n\nAnd I made her my lawful bride, oh my bride,\n\nAnd I made her my lawful bride.\n\nSo all you young fellows who ever you be,\n\nKiss all the pretty maidens that ever you see,\n\nAnd theyâll call you back again and again,\n\nAnd theyâll call you back again.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nTranscribed from the singing of Martin Carthy by Garry Gillard."
