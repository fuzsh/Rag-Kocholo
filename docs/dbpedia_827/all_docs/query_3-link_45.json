        "text": "james\n\n12/13/2007\n\nI went to State and had all my many math classes and a few others in Harrelson. I have fond memories of the classes I took there. Being in the lecture halls was fine as long as you had at least one seat on either side of you. The smaller rooms made classes seem more intimate, which was good for some of them. The rest of the building, though, was a real pain to deal with. Even though it is a simple circle, it felt like a maze when you had to find a specific room, or even the bathroom. The helix center ramp felt endless and the stairs on the outer rim were brutal. Somehow they had the worst rise/run ratio, and it always tired you out.\n\nI’m not at all sad that they’re tearing it down. It seems like one of those ideas that was great on paper, but just ridiculous when it came to fruition. I liked hanging out in the open space underneath it; I hated looking down on it from the bookstacks and thinking a spaceship had landed in the brickyard.\n\nMatt S.\n\n12/14/2007\n\nFrom what I understand about the demise:\n\nIt’s part and parcel of the greater NCSU master plan.\n\nMost of the engineering and laboratory classes are being (appropriately) moved to Centennial campus.\n\nSo, several of the “engineering row” buildings, especially those that were primarily laboratory buildings (Withers and Daniels, I’ve heard) have been gutted and remade into nice, modern classroom and office buildings. The Foreign languages department and the Sociology department (which houses Sociology, Anthropology, and the BA and Master’s programs in Social Work) are moving into those buildings. The 1911 building, which formerly housed the administrative and faculty offices for those two departments, is now being gutted and turned into a classroom and office building for the History Department.\n\nThus, all that would be left from Harrelson would be the Math and Statistics departments. Anyone that has been to NCSU in the past several decades knows the Riddick Parking lot, which was on top of what was the original football stadium in the 1st half of the 20th century. The last part of the stadium seats–they had been some sort of maintenance offices for about 50 years–were torn down about a year ago, and a new building to house the Math and Statistics department is going on that location; they’re going to tear up the asphalt and put down some more grass and trees.\n\nSo, what for Harrelson? It’s going to be leveled, and turned into a grassy area like the other two grassy areas that are a part of the brickyard.\n\nI honestly hope that the University makes it some sort of fundraiser and sells tickets to alumni. I’d love to see it demolished. In my opinion, the worst thing about Harrelson–in the summer, you had to bring a jacket because it would be so damn cold. In the winter, you had to have a tshirt on underneath your sweater, because it’d be so damn hot inside the building.\n\n(I don’t really have an inside-NCSU source for this info. I live in West Raleigh, drink beer and coffee with a lot of NCSU employees, walk around the campus a lot, catch news tidbits here and there. In other words, don’t take this as gospel; I’ve just taken about 50 different rumors and weighed them against each other and the evidence you see walking around campus to come up with what seems to be a logical explanation.)\n\nColin\n\n12/14/2007\n\nSo a little history on the building; aside from the fact (thats right, fact) that it sucks.\n\nOnce upon a time (thats the way all good history stories should start) there was an architecture design student who presented the Harrelson hall design as his senior design project. The student failed this particular design on the premise that the building would not hold ground and would be unstable. After eventually graduating, said student went on to be a successful architect (probably in part to the strenuous training from doing two different senior design projects). As this successful architect got older he wanted to give back to his school and donated some ridiculous amount of money under the condition that they had to build his building. 15 years later, we have Harrelson hall and it is sinking. Thus the plan to demolish. In the end, we are all losers.\n\nLee Hyde\n\n07/02/2008\n\nMatt s is mostly correct, except for the part about future plans for this space. The University Architect says that there are currently no concrete plans for this space, but as we move closer to the time of demoltion the campus community will be asked to weigh in on that decision. It is possible that another building may be erected in this location, but more like that brick or green space will be added. You have to keep in mind that there is a huge hole under Harrelson that facilities uses. If you want to get a good picture of this, you should go to Harrelson at night, walk toward the trees with the benches (toward the north west of Harrelson) and find one of the man holes. They all have a 2 inch hole in the top fo the cover, which you can look through to see the massive space underneath. This would generally prevent them from building too much on top of this space after they demolish Harrelson.\n\nFestus\n\n09/23/2010\n\nTwo years after your original posting, not much has changed: Harrelson is still god-awful, and it lives.\n\nWhen I took my job in the History Department in 2004, I was immediately doubled up with another young assistant prof in Harrelson Hall. A giant hole in one corner seemed to serve no function, but it let in clanking sounds and occasional moaning. We joked nervously that maybe a freshman had fallen in and gotten stuck. Though History has moved over to a castoff engineering building (lovely Withers Hall, thank you JESUS!) we continue to teach classes in Harrelson. I often feel physically ill after teaching in Harrelson; I have actually vomited after a class. I think it may be the flickering flourescent lights and lack of ventilation, plus the lack of windows (any windows!) in the classrooms.\n\nMy favorite Harrelson story: Long time History department member Joe Hobbs has for decades told his students to “take a brick with them” as they leave his classes. He hoped to slowly demolish Harrelson, brick by brick. Here is hoping it is gone before he is.\n\nxachie\n\n10/28/2011\n\nWas in Harrelson today, walking the campus with two other alumni. We went into Harrelson and noticed several changes, including the fresh painting of rooms in a building that is scheduled to be demolished. The building itself was almost empty, devoid of occupants in the round outer ring of offices. The inner circle on the second floor is now partially closed off as it appears that some of those famous intimately small classrooms have been enlarged to somewhat medium size lecture rooms.\n\nHated those steep steps going up, hated the round spiral in the middle even more. Cold classrooms first thing in the morning during winter’s cold but heated up as the day went on.\n\nHarrelson was supposed to have been 6 or more stories high when originally conceived but I’ve always heard that they stopped at 3 stories after the foundation supposedly was found to be unable to safely support more than 3 stories.\n\nNeat but ugly building, always loved the space underneath when it was raining, dash from there to the tunnel to Turlington or the SSS, was able to stay somewhat dry.\n\nraleighgirl\n\n10/28/2011\n\nhmmm…my first experience in Harrelson Hall goes back to when I was a junior in high school: early one bright Saturday morning a bunch of us in 3rd year German at Broughton took a national standardized German test in HH. Have no idea why that was the designated location. Went to State for my junior & senior years, 1970-72, recall having philosophy (hated that course/instructor but had interesting classmates)and British history in small classrooms in HH and sociology courses in larger rooms. Smaller classrooms with no windows inspired feelings of claustrophobia. A memorable occasion was the day when there was some kind of plumbing problem…altho signs were on RR doors warning people not to flush, some did anyway which resulted in some nasty stuff running down those ramps. Speaking of RRs, I honestly don’t recall seeing any womens’ RRs in that building (surely there must have been some kind of facilities since some female faculty had offices there). In the early ’70’s when female students were very much a minority group at State, RRs for women were few and far between—a reality which had to be considered when planning one’s class schedule. But getting back to Harrelson…it’s a well-known landmark and I sort of hate to see it go. Too bad it can’t be used for something besides classrooms."
