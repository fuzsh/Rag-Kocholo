        "text": "Book I\n\nA thing of beauty is a joy for ever:\n\nIts loveliness increases; it will never\n\nPass into nothingness; but still will keep\n\nA bower quiet for us, and a sleep\n\nFull of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.\n\nTherefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing\n\nA flowery band to bind us to the earth,\n\nSpite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth\n\nOf noble natures, of the gloomy days,\n\nOf all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways\n\nMade for our searching: yes, in spite of all,\n\nSome shape of beauty moves away the pall\n\nFrom our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,\n\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\n\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\n\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\n\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\n\n'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,\n\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\n\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\n\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\n\nAll lovely tales that we have heard or read:\n\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\n\nPouring unto us from the heaven's brink.\n\nNor do we merely feel these essences\n\nFor one short hour; no, even as the trees\n\nThat whisper round a temple become soon\n\nDear as the temple's self, so does the moon,\n\nThe passion poesy, glories infinite,\n\nHaunt us till they become a cheering light\n\nUnto our souls, and bound to us so fast,\n\nThat, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,\n\nThey alway must be with us, or we die.\n\nTherefore, 'tis with full happiness that I\n\nWill trace the story of Endymion.\n\nThe very music of the name has gone\n\nInto my being, and each pleasant scene\n\nIs growing fresh before me as the green\n\nOf our own vallies: so I will begin\n\nNow while I cannot hear the city's din;\n\nNow while the early budders are just new,\n\nAnd run in mazes of the youngest hue\n\nAbout old forests; while the willow trails\n\nIts delicate amber; and the dairy pails\n\nBring home increase of milk. And, as the year\n\nGrows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer\n\nMy little boat, for many quiet hours,\n\nWith streams that deepen freshly into bowers.\n\nMany and many a verse I hope to write,\n\nBefore the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,\n\nHide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees\n\nHum about globes of clover and sweet peas,\n\nI must be near the middle of my story.\n\nO may no wintry season, bare and hoary,\n\nSee it half finished: but let Autumn bold,\n\nWith universal tinge of sober gold,\n\nBe all about me when I make an end.\n\nAnd now at once, adventuresome, I send\n\nMy herald thought into a wilderness:\n\nThere let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress\n\nMy uncertain path with green, that I may speed\n\nEasily onward, thorough flowers and weed.\n\nUpon the sides of Latmos was outspread\n\nA mighty forest; for the moist earth fed\n\nSo plenteously all weed-hidden roots\n\nInto o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.\n\nAnd it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,\n\nWhere no man went; and if from shepherd's keep\n\nA lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,\n\nNever again saw he the happy pens\n\nWhither his brethren, bleating with content,\n\nOver the hills at every nightfall went.\n\nAmong the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,\n\nThat not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever\n\nFrom the white flock, but pass'd unworried\n\nBy angry wolf, or pard with prying head,\n\nUntil it came to some unfooted plains\n\nWhere fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains\n\nWho thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,\n\nWinding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,\n\nAnd ivy banks; all leading pleasantly\n\nTo a wide lawn, whence one could only see\n\nStems thronging all around between the swell\n\nOf turf and slanting branches: who could tell\n\nThe freshness of the space of heaven above,\n\nEdg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove\n\nWould often beat its wings, and often too\n\nA little cloud would move across the blue.\n\nFull in the middle of this pleasantness\n\nThere stood a marble altar, with a tress\n\nOf flowers budded newly; and the dew\n\nHad taken fairy phantasies to strew\n\nDaisies upon the sacred sward last eve,\n\nAnd so the dawned light in pomp receive.\n\nFor 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire\n\nMade every eastern cloud a silvery pyre\n\nOf brightness so unsullied, that therein\n\nA melancholy spirit well might win\n\nOblivion, and melt out his essence fine\n\nInto the winds: rain-scented eglantine\n\nGave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;\n\nThe lark was lost in him; cold springs had run\n\nTo warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;\n\nMan's voice was on the mountains; and the mass\n\nOf nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,\n\nTo feel this sun-rise and its glories old.\n\nNow while the silent workings of the dawn\n\nWere busiest, into that self-same lawn\n\nAll suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped\n\nA troop of little children garlanded;\n\nWho gathering round the altar, seemed to pry\n\nEarnestly round as wishing to espy\n\nSome folk of holiday: nor had they waited\n\nFor many moments, ere their ears were sated\n\nWith a faint breath of music, which ev'n then\n\nFill'd out its voice, and died away again.\n\nWithin a little space again it gave\n\nIts airy swellings, with a gentle wave,\n\nTo light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking\n\nThrough copse-clad vallies,â€”ere their death, oer-taking\n\nThe surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.\n\nAnd now, as deep into the wood as we\n\nMight mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light\n\nFair faces and a rush of garments white,\n\nPlainer and plainer shewing, till at last\n\nInto the widest alley they all past,\n\nMaking directly for the woodland altar.\n\nO kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter\n\nIn telling of this goodly company,\n\nOf their old piety, and of their glee:\n\nBut let a portion of ethereal dew\n\nFall on my head, and presently unmew\n\nMy soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,\n\nTo stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.\n\nLeading the way, young damsels danced along,\n\nBearing the burden of a shepherd song;\n\nEach having a white wicker over brimm'd\n\nWith April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,\n\nA crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks\n\nAs may be read of in Arcadian books;\n\nSuch as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,\n\nWhen the great deity, for earth too ripe,\n\nLet his divinity o'er-flowing die\n\nIn music, through the vales of Thessaly:\n\nSome idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,\n\nAnd some kept up a shrilly mellow sound\n\nWith ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,\n\nNow coming from beneath the forest trees,\n\nA venerable priest full soberly,\n\nBegirt with ministring looks: alway his eye\n\nStedfast upon the matted turf he kept,\n\nAnd after him his sacred vestments swept.\n\nFrom his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,\n\nOf mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;\n\nAnd in his left he held a basket full\n\nOf all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:\n\nWild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still\n\nThan Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.\n\nHis aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,\n\nSeem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth\n\nOf winter hoar. Then came another crowd\n\nOf shepherds, lifting in due time aloud\n\nTheir share of the ditty. After them appear'd,\n\nUp-followed by a multitude that rear'd\n\nTheir voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,\n\nEasily rolling so as scarce to mar\n\nThe freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:\n\nWho stood therein did seem of great renown\n\nAmong the throng. His youth was fully blown,\n\nShewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;\n\nAnd, for those simple times, his garments were\n\nA chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,\n\nWas hung a silver bugle, and between\n\nHis nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.\n\nA smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,\n\nTo common lookers on, like one who dream'd\n\nOf idleness in groves Elysian:\n\nBut there were some who feelingly could scan\n\nA lurking trouble in his nether lip,\n\nAnd see that oftentimes the reins would slip\n\nThrough his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,\n\nAnd think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,\n\nOf logs piled solemnly.â€”Ah, well-a-day,\n\nWhy should our young Endymion pine away!\n\nSoon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,\n\nStood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd\n\nTo sudden veneration: women meek\n\nBeckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek\n\nOf virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.\n\nEndymion too, without a forest peer,\n\nStood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,\n\nAmong his brothers of the mountain chase.\n\nIn midst of all, the venerable priest\n\nEyed them with joy from greatest to the least,\n\nAnd, after lifting up his aged hands,\n\nThus spake he: \"Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!\n\nWhose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:\n\nWhether descended from beneath the rocks\n\nThat overtop your mountains; whether come\n\nFrom vallies where the pipe is never dumb;\n\nOr from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs\n\nBlue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze\n\nBuds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge\n\nNibble their fill at ocean's very marge,\n\nWhose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn\n\nBy the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:\n\nMothers and wives! who day by day prepare\n\nThe scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;\n\nAnd all ye gentle girls who foster up\n\nUdderless lambs, and in a little cup\n\nWill put choice honey for a favoured youth:\n\nYea, every one attend! for in good truth\n\nOur vows are wanting to our great god Pan.\n\nAre not our lowing heifers sleeker than\n\nNight-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains\n\nSpeckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains\n\nGreen'd over April's lap? No howling sad\n\nSickens our fearful ewes; and we have had\n\nGreat bounty from Endymion our lord.\n\nThe earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd\n\nHis early song against yon breezy sky,\n\nThat spreads so clear o'er our solemnity.\"\n\nThus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire\n\nOf teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;\n\nAnon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod\n\nWith wine, in honour of the shepherd-god.\n\nNow while the earth was drinking it, and while\n\nBay leaves were crackling in the fragrant pile,\n\nAnd gummy frankincense was sparkling bright\n\n'Neath smothering parsley, and a hazy light\n\nSpread greyly eastward, thus a chorus sang:\n\n\"O THOU, whose mighty palace roof doth hang\n\nFrom jagged trunks, and overshadoweth\n\nEternal whispers, glooms, the birth, life, death\n\nOf unseen flowers in heavy peacefulness;\n\nWho lov'st to see the hamadryads dress\n\nTheir ruffled locks where meeting hazels darken;\n\nAnd through whole solemn hours dost sit, and hearken\n\nThe dreary melody of bedded reedsâ€”\n\nIn desolate places, where dank moisture breeds\n\nThe pipy hemlock to strange overgrowth;\n\nBethinking thee, how melancholy loth\n\nThou wast to lose fair Syrinxâ€”do thou now,\n\nBy thy love's milky brow!\n\nBy all the trembling mazes that she ran,\n\nHear us, great Pan!\n\n\"O thou, for whose soul-soothing quiet, turtles\n\nPassion their voices cooingly 'mong myrtles,\n\nWhat time thou wanderest at eventide\n\nThrough sunny meadows, that outskirt the side\n\nOf thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom\n\nBroad leaved fig trees even now foredoom\n\nTheir ripen'd fruitage; yellow girted bees\n\nTheir golden honeycombs; our village leas\n\nTheir fairest-blossom'd beans and poppied corn;\n\nThe chuckling linnet its five young unborn,\n\nTo sing for thee; low creeping strawberries\n\nTheir summer coolness; pent up butterflies\n\nTheir freckled wings; yea, the fresh budding year\n\nAll its completionsâ€”be quickly near,\n\nBy every wind that nods the mountain pine,\n\nO forester divine!\n\n\"Thou, to whom every fawn and satyr flies\n\nFor willing service; whether to surprise\n\nThe squatted hare while in half sleeping fit;\n\nOr upward ragged precipices flit\n\nTo save poor lambkins from the eagle's maw;\n\nOr by mysterious enticement draw\n\nBewildered shepherds to their path again;\n\nOr to tread breathless round the frothy main,\n\nAnd gather up all fancifullest shells\n\nFor thee to tumble into Naiads' cells,\n\nAnd, being hidden, laugh at their out-peeping;\n\nOr to delight thee with fantastic leaping,\n\nThe while they pelt each other on the crown\n\nWith silvery oak apples, and fir cones brownâ€”\n\nBy all the echoes that about thee ring,\n\nHear us, O satyr king!\n\n\"O Hearkener to the loud clapping shears,\n\nWhile ever and anon to his shorn peers\n\nA ram goes bleating: Winder of the horn,\n\nWhen snouted wild-boars routing tender corn\n\nAnger our huntsman: Breather round our farms,\n\nTo keep off mildews, and all weather harms:\n\nStrange ministrant of undescribed sounds,\n\nThat come a swooning over hollow grounds,\n\nAnd wither drearily on barren moors:\n\nDread opener of the mysterious doors\n\nLeading to universal knowledgeâ€”see,\n\nGreat son of Dryope,\n\nThe many that are come to pay their vows\n\nWith leaves about their brows!\n\nBe still the unimaginable lodge\n\nFor solitary thinkings; such as dodge\n\nConception to the very bourne of heaven,\n\nThen leave the naked brain: be still the leaven,\n\nThat spreading in this dull and clodded earth\n\nGives it a touch etherealâ€”a new birth:\n\nBe still a symbol of immensity;\n\nA firmament reflected in a sea;\n\nAn element filling the space between;\n\nAn unknownâ€”but no more: we humbly screen\n\nWith uplift hands our foreheads, lowly bending,\n\nAnd giving out a shout most heaven rending,\n\nConjure thee to receive our humble Paean,\n\nUpon thy Mount Lycean!\n\nEven while they brought the burden to a close,\n\nA shout from the whole multitude arose,\n\nThat lingered in the air like dying rolls\n\nOf abrupt thunder, when Ionian shoals\n\nOf dolphins bob their noses through the brine.\n\nMeantime, on shady levels, mossy fine,\n\nYoung companies nimbly began dancing\n\nTo the swift treble pipe, and humming string.\n\nAye, those fair living forms swam heavenly\n\nTo tunes forgottenâ€”out of memory:\n\nFair creatures! whose young children's children bred\n\nThermopylÃ¦ its heroesâ€”not yet dead,\n\nBut in old marbles ever beautiful.\n\nHigh genitors, unconscious did they cull\n\nTime's sweet first-fruitsâ€”they danc'd to weariness,\n\nAnd then in quiet circles did they press\n\nThe hillock turf, and caught the latter end\n\nOf some strange history, potent to send\n\nA young mind from its bodily tenement.\n\nOr they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent\n\nOn either side; pitying the sad death\n\nOf Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath\n\nOf Zephyr slew him,â€”Zephyr penitent,\n\nWho now, ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,\n\nFondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.\n\nThe archers too, upon a wider plain,\n\nBeside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,\n\nAnd the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft\n\nBranch down sweeping from a tall ash top,\n\nCall'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope\n\nThose who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee\n\nAnd frantic gape of lonely Niobe,\n\nPoor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young\n\nWere dead and gone, and her caressing tongue\n\nLay a lost thing upon her paly lip,\n\nAnd very, very deadliness did nip\n\nHer motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood\n\nBy one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,\n\nUplifting his strong bow into the air,\n\nMany might after brighter visions stare:\n\nAfter the Argonauts, in blind amaze\n\nTossing about on Neptune's restless ways,\n\nUntil, from the horizon's vaulted side,\n\nThere shot a golden splendour far and wide,\n\nSpangling those million poutings of the brine\n\nWith quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine\n\nFrom the exaltation of Apollo's bow;\n\nA heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.\n\nWho thus were ripe for high contemplating,\n\nMight turn their steps towards the sober ring\n\nWhere sat Endymion and the aged priest\n\n'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd\n\nThe silvery setting of their mortal star.\n\nThere they discours'd upon the fragile bar\n\nThat keeps us from our homes ethereal;\n\nAnd what our duties there: to nightly call\n\nVesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;\n\nTo summon all the downiest clouds together\n\nFor the sun's purple couch; to emulate\n\nIn ministring the potent rule of fate\n\nWith speed of fire-tailed exhalations;\n\nTo tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons\n\nSweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,\n\nA world of other unguess'd offices.\n\nAnon they wander'd, by divine converse,\n\nInto Elysium; vieing to rehearse\n\nEach one his own anticipated bliss.\n\nOne felt heart-certain that he could not miss\n\nHis quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,\n\nWhere every zephyr-sigh pouts and endows\n\nHer lips with music for the welcoming.\n\nAnother wish'd, mid that eternal spring,\n\nTo meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,\n\nSweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:\n\nWho, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,\n\nAnd with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;\n\nAnd, ever after, through those regions be\n\nHis messenger, his little Mercury.\n\nSome were athirst in soul to see again\n\nTheir fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign\n\nIn times long past; to sit with them, and talk\n\nOf all the chances in their earthly walk;\n\nComparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores\n\nOf happiness, to when upon the moors,\n\nBenighted, close they huddled from the cold,\n\nAnd shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told\n\nTheir fond imaginations,â€”saving him\n\nWhose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,\n\nEndymion: yet hourly had he striven\n\nTo hide the cankering venom, that had riven\n\nHis fainting recollections. Now indeed\n\nHis senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed\n\nThe sudden silence, or the whispers low,\n\nOr the old eyes dissolving at his woe,\n\nOr anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,\n\nOr maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:\n\nBut in the self-same fixed trance he kept,\n\nLike one who on the earth had never stept.\n\nAye, even as dead-still as a marble man,\n\nFrozen in that old tale Arabian.\n\nWho whispers him so pantingly and close?\n\nPeona, his sweet sister: of all those,\n\nHis friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,\n\nAnd breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade\n\nA yielding up, a cradling on her care.\n\nHer eloquence did breathe away the curse:\n\nShe led him, like some midnight spirit nurse\n\nOf happy changes in emphatic dreams,\n\nAlong a path between two little streams,â€”\n\nGuarding his forehead, with her round elbow,\n\nFrom low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow\n\nFrom stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;\n\nUntil they came to where these streamlets fall,\n\nWith mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,\n\nInto a river, clear, brimful, and flush\n\nWith crystal mocking of the trees and sky.\n\nA little shallop, floating there hard by,\n\nPointed its beak over the fringed bank;\n\nAnd soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,\n\nAnd dipt again, with the young couple's weight,â€”\n\nPeona guiding, through the water straight,\n\nTowards a bowery island opposite;\n\nWhich gaining presently, she steered light\n\nInto a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,\n\nWhere nested was an arbour, overwove\n\nBy many a summer's silent fingering;\n\nTo whose cool bosom she was used to bring\n\nHer playmates, with their needle broidery,\n\nAnd minstrel memories of times gone by.\n\nSo she was gently glad to see him laid\n\nUnder her favourite bower's quiet shade,\n\nOn her own couch, new made of flower leaves,\n\nDried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves\n\nWhen last the sun his autumn tresses shook,\n\nAnd the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.\n\nSoon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:\n\nBut, ere it crept upon him, he had prest\n\nPeona's busy hand against his lips,\n\nAnd still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips\n\nIn tender pressure. And as a willow keeps\n\nA patient watch over the stream that creeps\n\nWindingly by it, so the quiet maid\n\nHeld her in peace: so that a whispering blade\n\nOf grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling\n\nDown in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling\n\nAmong seer leaves and twigs, might all be heard.\n\nO magic sleep! O comfortable bird,\n\nThat broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind\n\nTill it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd\n\nRestraint! imprisoned liberty! great key\n\nTo golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,\n\nFountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,\n\nEchoing grottos, full of tumbling waves\n\nAnd moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world\n\nOf silvery enchantment!â€”who, upfurl'd\n\nBeneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,\n\nBut renovates and lives?â€”Thus, in the bower,\n\nEndymion was calm'd to life again.\n\nOpening his eyelids with a healthier brain,\n\nHe said: \"I feel this thine endearing love\n\nAll through my bosom: thou art as a dove\n\nTrembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings\n\nAbout me; and the pearliest dew not brings\n\nSuch morning incense from the fields of May,\n\nAs do those brighter drops that twinkling stray\n\nFrom those kind eyes,â€”the very home and haunt\n\nOf sisterly affection. Can I want\n\nAught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?\n\nYet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears\n\nThat, any longer, I will pass my days\n\nAlone and sad. No, I will once more raise\n\nMy voice upon the mountain-heights; once more\n\nMake my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:\n\nAgain my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll\n\nAround the breathed boar: again I'll poll\n\nThe fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:\n\nAnd, when the pleasant sun is getting low,\n\nAgain I'll linger in a sloping mead\n\nTo hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed\n\nOur idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,\n\nAnd, if thy lute is here, softly intreat\n\nMy soul to keep in its resolved course.\"\n\nHereat Peona, in their silver source,\n\nShut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,\n\nAnd took a lute, from which there pulsing came\n\nA lively prelude, fashioning the way\n\nIn which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay\n\nMore subtle cadenced, more forest wild\n\nThan Dryope's lone lulling of her child;\n\nAnd nothing since has floated in the air\n\nSo mournful strange. Surely some influence rare\n\nWent, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;\n\nFor still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd\n\nThe quick invisible strings, even though she saw\n\nEndymion's spirit melt away and thaw\n\nBefore the deep intoxication.\n\nBut soon she came, with sudden burst, upon\n\nHer self-possessionâ€”swung the lute aside,\n\nAnd earnestly said: \"Brother, 'tis vain to hide\n\nThat thou dost know of things mysterious,\n\nImmortal, starry; such alone could thus\n\nWeigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught\n\nOffensive to the heavenly powers? Caught\n\nA Paphian dove upon a message sent?\n\nThy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,\n\nSacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen\n\nHer naked limbs among the alders green;\n\nAnd that, alas! is death. No, I can trace\n\nSomething more high perplexing in thy face!\"\n\nEndymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,\n\nAnd said, \"Art thou so pale, who wast so bland\n\nAnd merry in our meadows? How is this?\n\nTell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!â€”\n\nAh! thou hast been unhappy at the change\n\nWrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?\n\nOr more complete to overwhelm surmise?\n\nAmbition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,\n\nThat toiling years would put within my grasp,\n\nThat I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp\n\nNo man e'er panted for a mortal love.\n\nSo all have set my heavier grief above\n\nThese things which happen. Rightly have they done:\n\nI, who still saw the horizontal sun\n\nHeave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,\n\nOut-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd\n\nMy spear aloft, as signal for the chaceâ€”\n\nI, who, for very sport of heart, would race\n\nWith my own steed from Araby; pluck down\n\nA vulture from his towery perching; frown\n\nA lion into growling, loth retireâ€”\n\nTo lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,\n\nAnd sink thus low! but I will ease my breast\n\nOf secret grief, here in this bowery nest.\n\n\"This river does not see the naked sky,\n\nTill it begins to progress silverly\n\nAround the western border of the wood,\n\nWhence, from a certain spot, its winding flood\n\nSeems at the distance like a crescent moon:\n\nAnd in that nook, the very pride of June,\n\nHad I been used to pass my weary eves;\n\nThe rather for the sun unwilling leaves\n\nSo dear a picture of his sovereign power,\n\nAnd I could witness his most kingly hour,\n\nWhen he doth lighten up the golden reins,\n\nAnd paces leisurely down amber plains\n\nHis snorting four. Now when his chariot last\n\nIts beams against the zodiac-lion cast,\n\nThere blossom'd suddenly a magic bed\n\nOf sacred ditamy, and poppies red:\n\nAt which I wondered greatly, knowing well\n\nThat but one night had wrought this flowery spell;\n\nAnd, sitting down close by, began to muse\n\nWhat it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,\n\nIn passing here, his owlet pinions shook;\n\nOr, it may be, ere matron Night uptook\n\nHer ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,\n\nHad dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth\n\nCame not by common growth. Thus on I thought,\n\nUntil my head was dizzy and distraught.\n\nMoreover, through the dancing poppies stole\n\nA breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;\n\nAnd shaping visions all about my sight\n\nOf colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;\n\nThe which became more strange, and strange, and dim,\n\nAnd then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:\n\nAnd then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell\n\nThe enchantment that afterwards befel?\n\nYet it was but a dream: yet such a dream\n\nThat never tongue, although it overteem\n\nWith mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,\n\nCould figure out and to conception bring\n\nAll I beheld and felt. Methought I lay\n\nWatching the zenith, where the milky way\n\nAmong the stars in virgin splendour pours;\n\nAnd travelling my eye, until the doors\n\nOf heaven appear'd to open for my flight,\n\nI became loth and fearful to alight\n\nFrom such high soaring by a downward glance:\n\nSo kept me stedfast in that airy trance,\n\nSpreading imaginary pinions wide.\n\nWhen, presently, the stars began to glide,\n\nAnd faint away, before my eager view:\n\nAt which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,\n\nAnd dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;\n\nAnd lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge\n\nThe loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er\n\nA shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar\n\nSo passionately bright, my dazzled soul\n\nCommingling with her argent spheres did roll\n\nThrough clear and cloudy, even when she went\n\nAt last into a dark and vapoury tentâ€”\n\nWhereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train\n\nOf planets all were in the blue again.\n\nTo commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd\n\nMy sight right upward: but it was quite dazed\n\nBy a bright something, sailing down apace,\n\nMaking me quickly veil my eyes and face:\n\nAgain I look'd, and, O ye deities,\n\nWho from Olympus watch our destinies!\n\nWhence that completed form of all completeness?\n\nWhence came that high perfection of all sweetness?\n\nSpeak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O Where\n\nHast thou a symbol of her golden hair?\n\nNot oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;\n\nNotâ€”thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun\n\nSuch follying before theeâ€”yet she had,\n\nIndeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;\n\nAnd they were simply gordian'd up and braided,\n\nLeaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,\n\nHer pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;\n\nThe which were blended in, I know not how,\n\nWith such a paradise of lips and eyes,\n\nBlush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,\n\nThat, when I think thereon, my spirit clings\n\nAnd plays about its fancy, till the stings\n\nOf human neighbourhood envenom all.\n\nUnto what awful power shall I call?\n\nTo what high fane?â€”Ah! see her hovering feet,\n\nMore bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet\n\nThan those of sea-born Venus, when she rose\n\nFrom out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows\n\nHer scarf into a fluttering pavilion;\n\n'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million\n\nOf little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,\n\nOver the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,\n\nHandfuls of daisies.\"â€”\"Endymion, how strange!\n\nDream within dream!\"â€”\"She took an airy range,\n\nAnd then, towards me, like a very maid,\n\nCame blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,\n\nAnd press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;\n\nMethought I fainted at the charmed touch,\n\nYet held my recollection, even as one\n\nWho dives three fathoms where the waters run\n\nGurgling in beds of coral: for anon,\n\nI felt upmounted in that region\n\nWhere falling stars dart their artillery forth,\n\nAnd eagles struggle with the buffeting north\n\nThat balances the heavy meteor-stone;â€”\n\nFelt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,\n\nBut lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.\n\nSoon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,\n\nAnd straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;\n\nSuch as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd\n\nHuge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:\n\nThere hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd\n\nTo faint once more by looking on my blissâ€”\n\nI was distracted; madly did I kiss\n\nThe wooing arms which held me, and did give\n\nMy eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,\n\nTo take in draughts of life from the gold fount\n\nOf kind and passionate looks; to count, and count\n\nThe moments, by some greedy help that seem'd\n\nA second self, that each might be redeem'd\n\nAnd plunder'd of its load of blessedness.\n\nAh, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press\n\nHer very cheek against my crowned lip,\n\nAnd, at that moment, felt my body dip\n\nInto a warmer air: a moment more,\n\nOur feet were soft in flowers. There was store\n\nOf newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes\n\nA scent of violets, and blossoming limes,\n\nLoiter'd around us; then of honey cells,\n\nMade delicate from all white-flower bells;\n\nAnd once, above the edges of our nest,\n\nAn arch face peep'd,â€”an Oread as I guess'd.\n\n\"Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me\n\nIn midst of all this heaven? Why not see,\n\nFar off, the shadows of his pinions dark,\n\nAnd stare them from me? But no, like a spark\n\nThat needs must die, although its little beam\n\nReflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream\n\nFell into nothingâ€”into stupid sleep.\n\nAnd so it was, until a gentle creep,\n\nA careful moving caught my waking ears,\n\nAnd up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,\n\nMy clenched hands;â€”for lo! the poppies hung\n\nDew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung\n\nA heavy ditty, and the sullen day\n\nHad chidden herald Hesperus away,\n\nWith leaden looks: the solitary breeze\n\nBluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze\n\nWith wayward melancholy; and r thought,\n\nMark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought\n\nFaint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!â€”\n\nAway I wander'dâ€”all the pleasant hues\n\nOf heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades\n\nWere deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades\n\nWere full of pestilent light; our taintless rills\n\nSeem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills\n\nOf dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown\n\nIn frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown\n\nLike spiked aloe. If an innocent bird\n\nBefore my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd\n\nIn little journeys, I beheld in it\n\nA disguis'd demon, missioned to knit\n\nMy soul with under darkness; to entice\n\nMy stumblings down some monstrous precipice:\n\nTherefore I eager followed, and did curse\n\nThe disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,\n\nRock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!\n\nThese things, with all their comfortings, are given\n\nTo my down-sunken hours, and with thee,\n\nSweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea\n\nOf weary life.\"\n\nThus ended he, and both\n\nSat silent: for the maid was very loth\n\nTo answer; feeling well that breathed words\n\nWould all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords\n\nAgainst the enchased crocodile, or leaps\n\nOf grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,\n\nAnd wonders; struggles to devise some blame;\n\nTo put on such a look as would say, Shame\n\nOn this poor weakness! but, for all her strife,\n\nShe could as soon have crush'd away the life\n\nFrom a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,\n\nShe said with trembling chance: \"Is this the cause?\n\nThis all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!\n\nThat one who through this middle earth should pass\n\nMost like a sojourning demi-god, and leave\n\nHis name upon the harp-string, should achieve\n\nNo higher bard than simple maidenhood,\n\nSinging alone, and fearfully,â€”how the blood\n\nLeft his young cheek; and how he used to stray\n\nHe knew not where; and how he would say, nay,\n\nIf any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;\n\nWhat could it be but love? How a ring-dove\n\nLet fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;\n\nAnd how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,\n\nThe gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;\n\nAnd then the ballad of his sad life closes\n\nWith sighs, and an alas!â€”Endymion!\n\nBe rather in the trumpet's mouth,â€”anon\n\nAmong the winds at largeâ€”that all may hearken!\n\nAlthough, before the crystal heavens darken,\n\nI watch and dote upon the silver lakes\n\nPictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes\n\nThe semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,\n\nIslands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands\n\nWith horses prancing o'er them, palaces\n\nAnd towers of amethyst,â€”would I so tease\n\nMy pleasant days, because I could not mount\n\nInto those regions? The Morphean fount\n\nOf that fine element that visions, dreams,\n\nAnd fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams\n\nInto its airy channels with so subtle,\n\nSo thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,\n\nCircled a million times within the space\n\nOf a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,\n\nA tinting of its quality: how light\n\nMust dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight\n\nThan the mere nothing that engenders them!\n\nThen wherefore sully the entrusted gem\n\nOf high and noble life with thoughts so sick?\n\nWhy pierce high-fronted honour to the quick\n\nFor nothing but a dream?\" Hereat the youth\n\nLook'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth\n\nWas in his plaited brow: yet his eyelids\n\nWidened a little, as when Zephyr bids\n\nA little breeze to creep between the fans\n\nOf careless butterflies: amid his pains\n\nHe seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,\n\nFull palatable; and a colour grew\n\nUpon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.\n\n\"Peona! ever have I long'd to slake\n\nMy thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,\n\nNo merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace\n\nThe stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'dâ€”\n\nThough now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd\n\nAnd sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope\n\nIs of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,\n\nTo fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.\n\nWherein lies happiness? In that which becks\n\nOur ready minds to fellowship divine,\n\nA fellowship with essence; till we shine,\n\nFull alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold\n\nThe clear religion of heaven! Fold\n\nA rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,\n\nAnd soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress\n\nOf music's kiss impregnates the free winds,\n\nAnd with a sympathetic touch unbinds\n\nEolian magic from their lucid wombs:\n\nThen old songs waken from enclouded tombs;\n\nOld ditties sigh above their father's grave;\n\nGhosts of melodious prophecyings rave\n\nRound every spot where trod Apollo's foot;\n\nBronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,\n\nWhere long ago a giant battle was;\n\nAnd, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass\n\nIn every place where infant Orpheus slept.\n\nFeel we these things?â€”that moment have we stept\n\nInto a sort of oneness, and our state\n\nIs like a floating spirit's. But there are\n\nRicher entanglements, enthralments far\n\nMore self-destroying, leading, by degrees,\n\nTo the chief intensity: the crown of these\n\nIs made of love and friendship, and sits high\n\nUpon the forehead of humanity.\n\nAll its more ponderous and bulky worth\n\nIs friendship, whence there ever issues forth\n\nA steady splendour; but at the tip-top,\n\nThere hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop\n\nOf light, and that is love: its influence,\n\nThrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,\n\nAt which we start and fret; till in the end,\n\nMelting into its radiance, we blend,\n\nMingle, and so become a part of it,â€”\n\nNor with aught else can our souls interknit\n\nSo wingedly: when we combine therewith,\n\nLife's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,\n\nAnd we are nurtured like a pelican brood.\n\nAye, so delicious is the unsating food,\n\nThat men, who might have tower'd in the van\n\nOf all the congregated world, to fan\n\nAnd winnow from the coming step of time\n\nAll chaff of custom, wipe away all slime\n\nLeft by men-slugs and human serpentry,\n\nHave been content to let occasion die,\n\nWhilst they did sleep in love's elysium.\n\nAnd, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,\n\nThan speak against this ardent listlessness:\n\nFor I have ever thought that it might bless\n\nThe world with benefits unknowingly;\n\nAs does the nightingale, upperched high,\n\nAnd cloister'd among cool and bunched leavesâ€”\n\nShe sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives\n\nHow tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.\n\nJust so may love, although 'tis understood\n\nThe mere commingling of passionate breath,\n\nProduce more than our searching witnesseth:\n\nWhat I know not: but who, of men, can tell\n\nThat flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell\n\nTo melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,\n\nThe earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,\n\nThe meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,\n\nThe seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,\n\nTones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,\n\nIf human souls did never kiss and greet?\n\n\"Now, if this earthly love has power to make\n\nMen's being mortal, immortal; to shake\n\nAmbition from their memories, and brim\n\nTheir measure of content; what merest whim,\n\nSeems all this poor endeavour after fame,\n\nTo one, who keeps within his stedfast aim\n\nA love immortal, an immortal too.\n\nLook not so wilder'd; for these things are true,\n\nAnd never can be born of atomies\n\nThat buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,\n\nLeaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,\n\nMy restless spirit never could endure\n\nTo brood so long upon one luxury,\n\nUnless it did, though fearfully, espy\n\nA hope beyond the shadow of a dream.\n\nMy sayings will the less obscured seem,\n\nWhen I have told thee how my waking sight\n\nHas made me scruple whether that same night\n\nWas pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!\n\nBeyond the matron-temple of Latona,\n\nWhich we should see but for these darkening boughs,\n\nLies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows\n\nBushes and trees do lean all round athwart,\n\nAnd meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,\n\nAnd spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide\n\nPast them, but he must brush on every side.\n\nSome moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,\n\nFar as the slabbed margin of a well,\n\nWhose patient level peeps its crystal eye\n\nRight upward, through the bushes, to the sky.\n\nOft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set\n\nLike vestal primroses, but dark velvet\n\nEdges them round, and they have golden pits:\n\n'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits\n\nIn a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,\n\nWhen all above was faint with mid-day heat.\n\nAnd there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,\n\nI'd bubble up the water through a reed;\n\nSo reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships\n\nOf moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,\n\nWith leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be\n\nOf their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,\n\nWhen love-lorn hours had left me less a child,\n\nI sat contemplating the figures wild\n\nOf o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.\n\nUpon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew\n\nA cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;\n\nSo plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver\n\nThe happy chance: so happy, I was fain\n\nTo follow it upon the open plain,\n\nAnd, therefore, was just going; when, behold!\n\nA wonder, fair as any I have toldâ€”\n\nThe same bright face I tasted in my sleep,\n\nSmiling in the clear well. My heart did leap\n\nThrough the cool depth.â€”It moved as if to fleeâ€”\n\nI started up, when lo! refreshfully,\n\nThere came upon my face, in plenteous showers,\n\nDew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,\n\nWrapping all objects from my smothered sight,\n\nBathing my spirit in a new delight.\n\nAye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss\n\nAlone preserved me from the drear abyss\n\nOf death, for the fair form had gone again.\n\nPleasure is oft a visitant; but pain\n\nClings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth\n\nOn the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,\n\n'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.\n\nHow sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure\n\nOf weary days, made deeper exquisite,\n\nBy a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!\n\nLike sorrow came upon me, heavier still,\n\nThan when I wander'd from the poppy hill:\n\nAnd a whole age of lingering moments crept\n\nSluggishly by, ere more contentment swept\n\nAway at once the deadly yellow spleen.\n\nYes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;\n\nOnce more been tortured with renewed life.\n\nWhen last the wintry gusts gave over strife\n\nWith the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies\n\nWarm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes\n\nIn pity of the shatter'd infant buds,â€”\n\nThat time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,\n\nMy hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,\n\nChatted with thee, and many days exil'd\n\nAll torment from my breast;â€”'twas even then,\n\nStraying about, yet, coop'd up in the den\n\nOf helpless discontent,â€”hurling my lance\n\nFrom place to place, and following at chance,\n\nAt last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,\n\nAnd, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck\n\nIn the middle of a brook,â€”whose silver ramble\n\nDown twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,\n\nTracing along, it brought me to a cave,\n\nWhence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave\n\nThe nether sides of mossy stones and rock,â€”\n\n'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock\n\nIts own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,\n\nHung a lush screen of drooping weeds, and spread\n\nThick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.\n\n\"Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?\"\n\nSaid I, low voic'd: \"Ah whither! 'Tis the grot\n\nOf Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,\n\nDoth her resign; and where her tender hands\n\nShe dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:\n\nOr 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,\n\nAnd babbles thorough silence, till her wits\n\nAre gone in tender madness, and anon,\n\nFaints into sleep, with many a dying tone\n\nOf sadness. O that she would take my vows,\n\nAnd breathe them sighingly among the boughs,\n\nTo sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,\n\nDaily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,\n\nAnd weave them dyinglyâ€”send honey-whispers\n\nRound every leaf, that all those gentle lispers\n\nMay sigh my love unto her pitying!\n\nO charitable echo! hear, and sing\n\nThis ditty to her!â€”tell her\"â€”so I stay'd\n\nMy foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,\n\nStood stupefied with my own empty folly,\n\nAnd blushing for the freaks of melancholy.\n\nSalt tears were coming, when I heard my name\n\nMost fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:\n\nâ€˜Endymion! the cave is secreter\n\nThan the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir\n\nNo sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise\n\nOf thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys\n\nAnd trembles through my labyrinthine hair.\"\n\nAt that oppress'd I hurried in.â€”Ah! where\n\nAre those swift moments? Whither are they fled?\n\nI'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed\n\nSorrow the way to death, but patiently\n\nBear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;\n\nAnd come instead demurest meditation,\n\nTo occupy me wholly, and to fashion\n\nMy pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.\n\nNo more will I count over, link by link,\n\nMy chain of grief: no longer strive to find\n\nA half-forgetfulness in mountain wind\n\nBlustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,\n\nDearest of sisters, what my life shall be;\n\nWhat a calm round of hours shall make my days.\n\nThere is a paly flame of hope that plays\n\nWhere'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naughtâ€”\n\nAnd here I bid it die. Have not I caught,\n\nAlready, a more healthy countenance?\n\nBy this the sun is setting; we may chance\n\nMeet some of our near-dwellers with my car.\""
