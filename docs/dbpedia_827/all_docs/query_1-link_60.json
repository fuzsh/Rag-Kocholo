        "text": "Summer Calendar Suffolk County\n\nCaumsett State Historic Park Preserve, situated on a scenic peninsula extending into Long Island Sound, offers miles of bridle paths, walking, jogging, hiking, biking, cross-country skiing and nature trails over acres of woodland, meadows, rock shoreline and salt marsh. The park has beautiful gardens, excellent fishing and scuba diving by permit.\n\nIn 1921 Marshall Field III purchased 1750 acres of Lloyd Neck to create one large estate. He named the land after its Matinecock Indian name, Caumsett, which means \"place by a sharp rock.\" Field created a self-sufficient English-style estate as a combination country club, hunting preserve, and home, complete with its own water and electrical supply. When the estate was finished, it had facilities for every sport except golf.\n\nCaumsett State Historic Park Preserve was acquired by New York State in 1961. The park is diverse; fishing, hiking, bird watching, nature photography, and nature study are among the many activities visitors may pursue. The polo pony barn provides lessons, boarding & equestrian services as part of the Lloyd Harbor Equestrian Center. The Masters Garage houses the Nassau BOCES Outdoor and Environmental Education Program.The historic Henry Lloyd Manor house built in 1711 is leased to the Lloyd Harbor Historical Society. The Historical Society provides historic interpretation of life during the colonial period.\n\nFor information on educational opportunities & programs in Long Island State Parks, please visit Long Island Environmental Interpretive Center.\n\nPlease note: As of April 1st Fishermans Road and Parking area will be open to Annual Permit holders only.

Caumsett is part of NY Audubon's Huntington and Northport Bays' Important Bird Area. It is on Lloyd Neck, a peninsula on the north shore of Long Island jutting out into Long Island Sound. The Caumsett BCA is special because it has a variety of habitats that attract many different species of birds. About two-thirds of the Caumsett BCA is forest, predominately oak-tulip tree forest. Other habitats include successional old field, low salt marsh, marine eelgrass meadow, maritime beach, successional shrub land and salt shrub. The Caumsett BCA is also an important stopover for migratory songbirds that fly over Long Island Sound. Caumsett offers a variety of education and recreation programs including fishing, hiking, birding, nature photography, nature study and guided tours.\n\nThe site supports a high diversity of migratory birds, especially forest dwelling Neotropical migrants. Breeding birds include several species listed in New York as endangered, threatened or of special concern: Osprey (special concern), Piping Plover (state endangered and federal threatened), Common Tern (state threatened) and Least Tern (state threatened). Other state-listed species observed at Caumsett include Common Loon (special concern), Bald Eagle (state and federal threatened), Northern Harrier (threatened), Sharp-shinned Hawk (special concern), Cooper's Hawk (special concern), Northern Goshawk (special concern), Red-shouldered Hawk (special concern), Golden Eagle (endangered), Peregrine Falcon (endangered), Short-eared Owl (endangered), Whip-poor-will (special concern), Red-headed Woodpecker (special concern), Vesper Sparrow (special concern) and Grasshopper Sparrow (special concern). Piping Plovers have nested at Lloyd Point since at least 1988 with up to 13 nesting pairs. Least Terns have nested nearly every year since at least 1977 with up to 100 pairs breeding at the Point. Common Terns first nested in 1998. Protection and management of nestlings and fledglings of these species at risk is done by State Parks. All three of these species are surveyed annually as part of the Long Island Colonial Waterbird and Piping Plover Survey.\n\nDownload a copy of the BCA map.\n\nGo birding with the Caumsett Bird Checklist."
