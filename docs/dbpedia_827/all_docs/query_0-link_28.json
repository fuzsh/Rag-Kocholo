        "text": "Did you celebrate St. Patrick’s Day this year? For the first time since I moved to LA nearly 10 years, I did. Well, nearly. I attended The Irish Film Festival LA at the Monica Film Center on Saturday 3/16 which got me in the spirit. Since I stopped drinking over 11 years ago, and even before that, I stopped celebrating the big fella’s day. It has become a gaudy nightmare of leprechaun costumes and green beer which has spread around the world. But this year I looked deeper into his history and discovered that he wasn’t even Irish. He was captured from England by Irish pirates and enslaved for 6 years. While in captivity he worked as a shepherd and became close to God, and most importantly, he learned the Irish language until he escaped. When he returned years later, knowing the people and language enabled him to peacefully convert Ireland from paganism to Christianity. Though I’m 5,000 miles away, meeting Irish folks at the film festival reminded me of one of the most powerful connections to our native homes... Language.

Read the full story in the link below to discover what else ties me to my other, faraway home. #irishamerican #losangeles #latimes #originstory #storytellingforbusiness #galway #journalism #insideireland #saintpatrick\n\nIf a museum is a collection of important historical and cultural artifacts, a haven for the precious elements that show us all we have been as a community, then Duffy’s Tavern is a museum of Miami. The restaurant and bar, originally built in 1929 as a residence, has been feeding and watering the communities around it with warmth, humor and hamburgers ever since Martin Duffy first opened the business in 1955. Now, the property, right on the edge of Coral Gables, is up for sale, its future uncertain even as the faithful still flock. Read more: https://lnkd.in/di6ghfxc"
