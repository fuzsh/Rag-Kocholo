        "text": "Very busy week Tuesday evening began with a service at St Paul’s Cathedral to celebrate the 369th year of the Clergy Support Trust. This showcased the wonderful voices that represented the three cathedral choirs of St Paul’s, Rochester and Durham. Dinner followed at the delightful Plaisterers’ Hall. Wednesday saw us partake of lunch in the wine cellar of the Stafford Hotel with a number of other Masters and their Consorts. Thank you #SimonUnderwood for organising. This is the third largest wine cellar in the City of London and it is still replete with artefacts from its time as a bomb shelter. A pleasant walk through Green Park took us to Buckingham Palace and the King’s Garden Party. The assembled guests received the King and Queen as well as Princess Anne and Prince Edward. The weather played its part as we partook of sandwiches and tea whilst listening to the military bands. Consorts’ function at the Magic Circle for Alison and a WCoC Networking evening for me finished the day. Yesterday, a Court hearing at Vintners’ was followed by our Companions lunch and then a reception at Mercers’. “And so to bed!” As a certain diarist would say. #constructorscompany #admiralscaffoldinggroup #fbe #londonconstruction #worshipfulcompanyofconstructors"
