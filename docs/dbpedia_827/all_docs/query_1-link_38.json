        "text": "Cottages at Farrow Parkway in Market Common, Myrtle Beach, SC Homes for Sale\n\nThe homes in the development called \"Cottages at Farrow\" are located in the part of the Market Common district that was the old airforce base. Though some were built originally in the late 2000's, much of what is available right now is new construction, to be completed in early 2016.\n\nThis beautiful community offers a neighborhood pool, quiet street, bike trails, sparkling ponds, and easy access to both the retail section of Market Common as well as the beach and Myrtle Beach State Park. The recently renovated Crabtree Gym facilities and a 200+ acre park with a beautiful lake are located just across the street. You will love the location.\n\nHomes are one and two stories, with every upgrade from vaulted ceilings to granite countertops and stainless appliances. The two-story homes have screened porches on the second floor and a covered patio for barbeques on the first floor. Prices range around the mid $200,000's, a great bargain for a new home with all these amenities.\n\nFor more information or to take a tour of the community, give us a call. We think you'll like this one! Mention the homes for sale called the Cottages at Farrow Parkway."
