        "text": "As a university, we have two Adobe licenses available to us - Named User Licensing (NUL) and Shared Device Licensing (SDL). For NUL users, we deploy the Creative Cloud Desktop app (CCDA), and let them install whatever apps they need. When building a NUL package in Adobe's admin console, you can specify if you want non-admins to be able to install apps through CCDA.\n\nFor SDL users, we make individual packages, import them into Munki, and deploy as managed_installs or optional_installs, depending on where and how the computer will be used.\n\nI really miss the days where you could have AutoPkg recipes drive the Create Cloud Packager app, but Adobe's switch to exclusively building deployment packages through their web console ended that. That said, take a look at these AutoPkg recipes from dataJAR:\n\nBen Toms did a fantastic job putting these together, and they saved me hours, probably even days, in labor. The idea is that you still build your packages in Adobe's admin console, but you feed them through the overrides you create from these recipes. They'll handle importing each installer into Munki, setting the installs arrays, other pkginfo keys, etc.\n\nI assume you can use the recipes with NUL packages, but I haven't tried it. Worth a shot! We've discussed using RUM here, but my preference would be to build newer installers for the apps and deploy those instead (especially since those recipes make it a much simpler process)."
