        "text": "Auto import\n\nIf you're using a class, a static method, or a static field that you haven't imported yet, the IDE shows you a tooltip prompting to add a missing import statement so that you don't have to add it manually. Press Alt+Enter to accept the suggestion.\n\nIf there's more than one possible source of import, pressing Alt+Enter will open the list of suggestions.\n\nTo change the background color for import tooltip, press Ctrl+Alt+S and go to Editor | Color Scheme | General | Popups and Hints | Question hint.\n\nAutomatically add import statements\n\nYou can configure the IDE to automatically add import statements if there are no options to choose from.\n\nPress Ctrl+Alt+S to open settings and then select Editor | General | Auto Import.\n\nSelect the Add unambiguous imports on the fly checkbox, and apply the changes.\n\nWhen you are pasting blocks of code that contain references to classes or static methods and fields that are not yet imported, the IDE automatically inserts the missing import statements. If you want to change that, from the Insert imports on paste list, select Ask to confirm every insertion or Never to insert import statements manually.\n\nImport packages instead of single classes\n\nIntelliJ IDEA suggests importing single classes by default. You can change the settings to import entire packages instead.\n\nPress Ctrl+Alt+S to open settings and then select Editor | Code Style | Java | Imports.\n\nClear the Use single class import checkbox, and apply the changes.\n\nDisable auto import\n\nIf you want to completely disable auto-import, make sure that:\n\nAll import tooltips are disabled.\n\nThe automatic insertion of import statements is disabled.\n\nExclude classes and packages from auto import\n\nThe list of import suggestions may include classes and packages that you don't need. You can exclude redundant entries from automatic import so that the list of suggestions contains only relevant items.\n\nPress Ctrl+Alt+S to open settings and then select Editor | General | Auto Import.\n\nIn the Exclude from auto-import and completion section, click Alt+Insert, and specify a class or a package that you want to exclude.\n\nYou can also select whether you want to exclude items from the current project or from all projects (globally).\n\nExclude a class or a package on the fly\n\nPress Alt+Enter on a missing class to open the list of import suggestions.\n\nClick the right arrow next to a package and select an item (a class or an entire package) that you want to exclude.\n\nIn the Exclude from auto-import and completion section of the Auto Import dialog, select whether you want to exclude items from the current project or from all projects, and apply the changes.\n\nOptimize imports\n\nThe Optimize Imports feature helps you remove unused imports and organize import statements in the current file or in all files in a directory at once according to the rules specified in Settings | Editor | Code Style | <language> | Imports.\n\nOptimize all imports\n\nSelect a file or a directory in the Project tool window (View | Tool Windows | Project).\n\nDo any of the following:\n\nIn the main menu, go to Code | Optimize Imports (or press Ctrl+Alt+O).\n\nFrom the context menu, select Optimize Imports.\n\n(If you've selected a directory) Choose whether you want to optimize imports in all files in the directory, or only in locally modified files (if your project is under version control), and click Run.\n\nRemove unused imports\n\nPlace the caret at the unused import statement and press Alt+Enter or use the icon.\n\nUnused statements are greyed out by default.\n\nFrom the list of suggestions, select Remove unused imports.\n\nOptimize imports when committing changes to Git\n\nIf your project is under version control, you can instruct IntelliJ IDEA to optimize imports in modified files before committing them to VCS.\n\nPress Ctrl+K or select Git | Commit from the main menu.\n\nClick and in the commit message area, select the Optimize imports checkbox.\n\nAutomatically optimize imports on save\n\nYou can configure the IDE to optimize imports in modified files automatically when your changes are saved.\n\nPress Ctrl+Alt+S to open settings and then select Tools | Actions on Save.\n\nEnable the Optimize imports option.\n\nAdditionally, from the All file types list, select the types of files in which you want to optimize imports.\n\nApply the changes and close the dialog.\n\nOptimize imports when reformatting a file\n\nYou can tell IntelliJ IDEA to optimize imports in a file every time it is reformatted.\n\nOpen the file in the editor, press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+L, and make sure the Optimize imports checkbox is selected in the Reformat File dialog that opens.\n\nAfter that every time you press Ctrl+Alt+L in this project, IntelliJ IDEA will optimize its imports automatically.\n\nOptimize imports on the fly\n\nYou can also configure the IDE to automatically optimize imports. IntelliJ IDEA will remove or modify import statements according to the rules specified in Settings | Editor | Code Style | <language> | Imports as you work in the editor.\n\nPress Ctrl+Alt+S to open settings and then select Editor | General | Auto Import.\n\nEnable the Optimize imports on the fly option and apply the changes.\n\nLast modified: 28 June 2024"
