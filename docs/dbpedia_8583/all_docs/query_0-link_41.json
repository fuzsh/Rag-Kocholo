        "text": "Windows can use different features to auto-trigger VPN, avoiding users to manually connect when VPN is needed to access necessary resources. There are three different types of auto-trigger rules:\n\nApplication trigger\n\nName-based trigger\n\nAlways On\n\nApplication trigger\n\nVPN profiles can be configured to automatically connect on the execution of certain applications:\n\nYou can configure desktop or Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps to trigger a VPN connection\n\nYou can configure per-app VPN and specify traffic rules for each app\n\nFor more information, see Traffic filters.\n\nName-based trigger\n\nYou can configure a domain name-based rule so that a specific domain name triggers the VPN connection.\n\nName-based auto-trigger can be configured using the VPNv2/<ProfileName>/DomainNameInformationList/dniRowId/AutoTrigger setting in the VPNv2 Configuration Service Provider (CSP).\n\nThere are four types of name-based triggers:\n\nShort name: for example, if HRweb is configured as a trigger, and the stack sees a DNS resolution request for HRweb, the VPN triggers\n\nFully qualified domain name (FQDN): for example, if HRweb.corp.contoso.com is configured as a trigger, and the stack sees a DNS resolution request for HRweb.corp.contoso.com, the VPN triggers\n\nSuffix: for example, if .corp.contoso.com is configured as a trigger, and the stack sees a DNS resolution request with a matching suffix (such as HRweb.corp.contoso.com), the VPN triggers. For any short name resolution, VPN triggers, and the DNS servers are queried for the <ShortName>.corp.contoso.com\n\nAll: if used, all DNS resolution triggers VPN\n\nAlways On\n\nAlways On is a Windows feature that enables the active VPN profile to connect automatically on the following triggers:\n\nUser sign-in\n\nNetwork change\n\nDevice screen on\n\nWhen the trigger occurs, VPN tries to connect. If an error occurs, or any user input is needed, the user sees a toast notification for more interaction.\n\nWhen a device has multiple profiles with Always On triggers, the user can specify the active profile in Settings > Network & Internet > VPN > <VPN profile> by selecting the Let apps automatically use this VPN connection checkbox. By default, the first MDM-configured profile is marked as Active. Devices with multiple users have the same restriction: only one profile, and therefore only one user, is able to use the Always On triggers.\n\nPreserving user Always On preference\n\nAnother Windows feature is to preserve a user's Always On preference. If a user manually unchecks the Connect automatically checkbox, Windows remembers the user preference for the profile name by adding the profile name to the registry value AutoTriggerDisabledProfilesList.\n\nIf a management tool removes or adds the same profile name back and set AlwaysOn to true, Windows doesn't check the box if the profile name exists in the following registry value, in order to preserve user preference.\n\nKey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\RasMan\\Config\n\nValue: AutoTriggerDisabledProfilesList\n\nType: REG_MULTI_SZ\n\nTrusted network detection\n\nThe Trusted network detection feature configures the VPN so that connection isn't triggered when a device is on a trusted network. To configure Trusted network detection, you must provide a list of DNS suffixes. The VPN stack verifies the network name of the physical interface connection profile: if it matches any of the suffixes configured in the list and the network is private or provisioned by MDM, then VPN doesn't trigger.\n\nTrusted network detection can be configured using the VPNv2/<ProfileName>/TrustedNetworkDetection setting in the VPNv2 CSP.\n\nConfigure app-triggered VPN\n\nSee VPN profile options and VPNv2 CSP for XML configuration.\n\nThe following image shows associating apps to a VPN connection in a VPN Profile configuration policy using Microsoft Intune."
