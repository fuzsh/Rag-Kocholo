Depending on the type of automobile insurance you choose, coverage could pay for repairs or medical bills and help you get a rental car if you're ever in a collision.\n\nAn independent agent can help you decide if you need basic liability coverage or if your vehicles may benefit from optional coverages that protect against a broader range of situations.\n\nIf you drive a vehicle for business purposes, your agent can help you determine if you need commercial car insurance.\n\nLUXURY CAR INSURANCE FROM SELECTIVE\n\nA standard auto insurance policy may not adequately protect your custom, classic, or limited production vehicle.\n\nWe suggest talking to your independent agent about specialized high-end vehicle insurance coverage from Selective tailored to your car’s unique value, age, and usage.\n\n“Great communication and service with our claims.”\n\nPersonal Auto Insurance Customer\n\nGREATER PEACE OF MIND OF THE ROAD\n\nThe Selective Edge® Personal Auto Insurance\n\nSelective's comprehensive policy enhancement offers a variety of optional auto insurance coverage enhancements that go above and beyond standard protection:\n\nRoadside Assistance\n\nKey replacement\n\nPet injury coverage\n\nand more\n\nAsk your independent agent about how to enhance your auto protection with the Selective Edge.\n\nOptional Personal Auto Coverage Enhancements\n\nBy having adequate auto insurance coverage in place, you can be confident in knowing you're protected against road risks.

There are a number of auto insurance coverages available. The most common coverages, however, include liability, comprehensive, collision, medical payments and personal injury protection (PIP).\n\nWhat is comprehensive car insurance?\n\nComprehensive auto insurance is auto insurance coverage that pays to repair or replace your vehicle if it is damaged in an incident other than a collision. This may include events such as fire, vandalism, theft, or damage caused by other hazards like hail or falling trees. Comprehensive auto insurance coverage can provide added protection against damages from events beyond your control.\n\nHow to switch car insurance to Selective?\n\nContact one of these agents for a Selective auto insurance quote. Whether you are currently insured with another carrier or would like to purchase your first personal auto insurance policy, a Selective agent will work with you to find an auto insurance policy that fits your unique lifestyle.\n\nFor Individuals Customer Reviews\n\n4.3\n\n3763 reviews\n\nFIND AUTO INSURANCE AGENTS NEAR ME\n\nZip Code\n\nInclude Flood Agents\n\nMore Individual Insurance Options:"
