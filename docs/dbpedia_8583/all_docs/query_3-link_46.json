Things are going well (except perhaps for those pesky trust info warnings) but there are other software titles you’d like to add that don’t currently have recipes. This session will help you “level up” with AutoPkg, including understanding how to read recipes, various methods to create your own recipes, recipe best practices, and how to use AutoPkg at the command line to help develop recipes and manage trust info. While this session will be best suited to people with some familiarity with AutoPkg, a general overview will be included so that people who are not currently leveraging AutoPkg can also benefit.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nAnthony Reimer (Twitter: @AnthonyReimer) – Head Technician, Integrated Arts Media Labs – University of Calgary\n\nAnthony has been the Head Technician of the IAML at the University of Calgary since 1996, supporting work with Macs and other digital technology in Music, Art, Drama and Dance.
