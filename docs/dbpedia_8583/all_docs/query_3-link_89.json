I am looking for up to date and detailed information on how to deploy basic software packages to MacOS. I have built an image with the large software packages just as Microsoft Office and Adobe Creative Suite and I am just looking for a way to distribute the following software applications\n\nAdobe Flash - install_flash_player_18_osx_pkg.dmg\n\nAdobe AIR - AdobeAIR.dmg\n\nAdobe Shockwave - Shockwave_Installer_Full_64bit.dmg\n\nGoogle Chrome - googlechrome.dmg\n\nAdobe Reader DC - AcroRdrDC_1500720033_MUI.dmg\n\nI have been reading and watching a lot of videos and tried some methods that do not work. I have downloaded the offline installers which I reflected above in my software list. It appears Adobe makes a prebuilt distributable PKG for Flash but not for the others. Also I have read that you have to use the Adobe Customization Wizard for Adobe Acrobat Reader to make the PKG which I have also downloaded.\n\nWhat I was hoping for is some details and steps on how to set all this up as I am thoroughly confused partially because the MacOS command lines are very foreign to me and I have no idea what they are actually doing.\n\nI am thinking for programs like AIR, Shockwave, and Chrome I am going to have to re-package them and I have read that MacOS has a repackager built in that can make a PKG file or whatever. I am going to try that but honestly I have no idea how to distribute even a PKG file if I upload it to the KACE.\n\nPlease help me!!\n\nAnswers (2)\n\nAnswer Summary:\n\nPlease log in to answer\n\nPosted by: jknox 9 years ago\n\nTop Answer\n\nThe installation method will vary with the software title. Some things, like Firefox, you can just upload the DMG and use the defaults: https://support.software.dell.com/k1000-systems-management-appliance/kb/111167\n\nSilverlight, as a similar example: http://www.itninja.com/blog/view/k1000-mac-deploy-silverlight-through-a-managed-install\n\nOthers, you will have to tweak a little: http://www.itninja.com/blog/view/kace-mac-managed-install-of-adobe-flash-player-for-mac-using-install-adobe-flash-player-app\n\nAs far as package tools go, here are some examples:\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pkgbuild.1.html\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/productbuild.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/productbuild\n\nhttp://s.sudre.free.fr/Software/Packages/about.html\n\nhttps://derflounder.wordpress.com/2015/05/21/payload-free-package-creator-app-revisited/"
