This doesn’t necessarily mean that something’s wrong with the app. For example, some apps were written before developer ID registration began. However, the app has not been reviewed, and macOS can’t check whether the app has been modified or broken since it was released.\n\nA common way to distribute malware is to take an app and insert harmful code into it, and then redistribute the infected app. So an app that isn’t registered by an unidentified developer might contain harmful code.\n\nThe safest approach is to look for a later version of the app from the Mac App Store or look for an alternative app.\n\nTo override your security settings and open the app anyway, follow these steps:"
