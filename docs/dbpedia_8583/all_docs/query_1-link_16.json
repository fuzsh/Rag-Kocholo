Breakfast, lunch, light snacks, and dinner will be served during the day. These workshops are built to help attendees gain a solid foundation in a focused aspect of system administration.\n\nFull Day Workshops:\n\nDive into PowerShell on the Mac\n\nHomelab 101: the alchemy, art, and science of a home lab\n\nLearn How You Manage Mac Clients with GitOps – a Hands-On Walkthrough\n\nManaging Macs for n00bs\n\nHalf-Day Workshops: (Offered once either in the morning or afternoon, actual times TBD)\n\nCreate autopkg recipes for software from scratch\n\nGet started with deploying Apple devices\n\nGit for Mac Admins\n\nITIL 4 – Is It Right For Me?\n\nCreate AutoPkg recipes for software from scratch – James Stewart\n\nHalf Day Workshop (150 min) – Intermediate – Hands-on\n\nLearn how to create AutoPkg recipes for software from scratch. Autopkg can distribute software updates from vendor websites to your distribution tool of choice, saving thousands of dollars a week.\n\nBeing comfortable on the command line is recommended, but previous knowledge of AutoPkg is optional.\n\nWhile AutoPkg is written in Python, writing Python code is not required to write recipes and will not be covered. Recipes use YAML text files.\n\nAny prerequisites: Yes – but optional.

It also has broad application for Mac admins to use with managing scripts, configuration profiles, AutoPkg recipes, munki configs, and other files that form the backbone of admin tooling. In this workshop you’ll learn the basics of installing git on your computer, using git locally to manage version control, and using git with remote repositories (think GitHub, GitLab, etc.).\n\nAny prerequisites: Yes – but optional. Attendees will need a computer with the latest release version of Xcode installed and should be conversant with using Terminal.app. Familiarity with Bash or ZSH will be helpful.\n\nHomelab 101: the alchemy, art, and science of a home lab – Adam Wickert, Bryan Heinz\n\nFull Day Workshop (300 min) – All Levels – Hands-on\n\nIn this workshop, we’ll work through setting up a small lab environment for testing out new software and services. We’ll work through different virtualization environments such as XCP-ng, Proxmox, Apple’s hypervisor framework, and containerization. We’ll discuss hardware and networking. Finally, we’ll be working through setting up a service or two using these methods.\n\nAny prerequisites: None needed.\n\nITIL 4 – Is It Right For Me? – Pam Lefkowitz\n\nHalf Day Workshop (150 min) – All Levels – Presentation\n\nBecause you don’t have enough certifications yet, we give you ITIL 4.

By the end of day, you will have a first-hand impression about what it’s like to enroll and manage Macs with GitOps automations. As we go along, you can learn useful techniques and tools you can apply to your day-to-day, whether GitOps or not.\n\nAny prerequisites: Yes – but optional. You do not need to be an expert in Git to follow along, but familiarity with this tool will definitely help. We will edit text files and run some commands in the Terminal, so bring a Mac if you want to participate in the hands-on parts of the workshop.
