The interactive mode can be faster over time because sbt only needs to start once. When you enter commands one at a time, sbt restarts each time you run it.\n\n§Single commands\n\nYou can run single sbt commands directly. For example, to build and run Play, change to the directory of your project and run:\n\n$ sbt run\n\nYou will see something like:\n\n[info] Loading project definition from /Users/play-developer/my-first-app/project [info] Set current project to my-first-app (in build file:/Users/play-developer/my-first-app/) --- (Running the application from sbt, auto-reloading is enabled) --- [info] play - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000 (Server started, use Enter to stop and go back to the console...) The application starts directly. When you quit the server using Ctrl+D or Enter, the command prompt returns.\n\n§Interactive mode\n\nTo launch sbt in the interactive mode, change into the top-level of your project and enter sbt with no arguments:\n\n$ cd my-first-app my-first-app $ sbt\n\nYou will see something like:\n\n[info] Loading global plugins from /Users/play-developer/.sbt/1.0/plugins [info] Loading project definition from /Users/play-developer/my-first-app/project [info] Updating {file:/Users/play-developer/my-first-app/project/}my-first-app-build... [info] Resolving org.fusesource.jansi#jansi;1.4 ... [info] Done updating. [info] Set current project to my-first-app (in build file:/Users/play-developer/my-first-app/) [my-first-app] $\n\nTip: you can also launch some commands before getting into sbt shell by running shell at the end of task list. For example:\n\n$ sbt clean compile shell\n\n§Development mode\n\nIn this mode, sbt launches Play with the auto-reload feature enabled. When you make a request, Play will automatically recompile and restart your server if any files have changed. If needed the application will restart automatically.\n\nWith sbt in the interactive mode, run the current application in development mode, use the run command:\n\n[my-first-app] $ run\n\nYou will see something like:\n\n$ sbt [info] Loading global plugins from /Users/play-developer/.sbt/1.0/plugins [info] Loading project definition from /Users/play-developer/tmp/my-first-app/project [info] Done updating. [info] Loading settings for project root from build.sbt ... [info] Set current project to my-first-app (in build file:/Users/play-developer/tmp/my-first-app/) [info] sbt server started at local:///Users/play-developer/.sbt/1.0/server/c9c53f40a402da68f71a/sock [my-first-app] $ run [info] Updating ... [info] Done updating. [warn] There may be incompatibilities among your library dependencies; run 'evicted' to see detailed eviction warnings. --- (Running the application, auto-reloading is enabled) --- [info] p.c.s.PekkoHttpServer - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000 (Server started, use Enter to stop and go back to the console...)\n\n§Compiling only\n\nYou can also compile your application without running the HTTP server. The compile command displays any application errors in the command window. For example, in the interactive mode, enter:\n\n[my-first-app] $ compile\n\nAnd you will see something like:\n\n[my-first-app] $ compile [info] Compiling 1 Scala source to /Users/play-developer/my-first-app/target/scala-2.13/classes... [error] /Users/play-developer/my-first-app/app/controllers/HomeController.scala:21: not found: value Actionx [error] def index = Actionx { implicit request => [error] ^ [error] one error found [error] (compile:compileIncremental) Compilation failed [error] Total time: 1 s, completed Feb 6, 2017 2:00:07 PM [my-first-app] $\n\nIf there are no errors with your code, you will see:\n\n[my-first-app] $ compile [info] Updating {file:/Users/play-developer/my-first-app/}root... [info] Resolving jline#jline;2.12.2 ... [info] Done updating. [info] Compiling 8 Scala sources and 1 Java source to /Users/play-developer/my-first-app/target/scala-2.13/classes... [success] Total time: 3 s, completed Feb 6, 2017 2:01:31 PM [my-first-app] $\n\n§Testing options\n\nYou can run tests without running the server. For example, in interactive mode, use the test command:\n\n[my-first-app] $ test\n\nThe test commands will run all the tests in your project. You can also use testOnly to select specific tests:\n\n[my-first-app] $ testOnly com.acme.SomeClassTest\n\n§Launch the Scala console\n\nType console to enter the Scala console, which allows you to test your code interactively:\n\n[my-first-app] $ console\n\nTo start application inside scala console (e.g. to access database):\n\nimport play.api._ val env = Environment(new java.io.File(\".\"), this.getClass.getClassLoader, Mode.Dev) val context = ApplicationLoader.Context.create(env) val loader = ApplicationLoader(context) val app = loader.load(context) Play.start(app)\n\n§Debugging\n\nYou can ask Play to start a JPDA debug port when starting the console. You can then connect using Java debugger. Use the sbt -jvm-debug <port> command to do that:\n\n$ sbt -jvm-debug 9999\n\nWhen a JPDA port is available, the JVM will log this line during boot:\n\nListening for transport dt_socket at address: 9999\n\n§Using sbt features\n\nYou can use sbt features such as triggered execution.\n\nFor example, using ~ compile:\n\n[my-first-app] $ ~ compile\n\nThe compilation will be triggered each time you change a source file.\n\nYou can also do the same for ~ test, to continuously test your project each time you modify a source file:\n\n[my-first-app] $ ~ test\n\nThis could be especially useful if you want to run just a small set of your tests using testOnly command. For instance:\n\n[my-first-app] $ ~ testOnly com.acme.SomeClassTest\n\nWill trigger the execution of com.acme.SomeClassTest test every time you modify a source file.\n\n§Using the play commands directly\n\nYou can also run commands directly without entering the Play console. For example, enter sbt run:\n\n$ sbt run [info] Loading project definition from /Users/play-developer/my-first-app/project [info] Set current project to my-first-app (in build file:/Users/play-developer/my-first-app/) --- (Running the application from sbt, auto-reloading is enabled) --- [info] play - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000 (Server started, use Enter to stop and go back to the console...)\n\nThe application starts directly. When you quit the server using Ctrl+D or Enter, you will come back to your OS prompt.\n\nBy default, the server runs on port 9000. A custom port (e.g. 8080) can be specified: sbt 'run 8080'\n\n§Getting help\n\nUse the help command to get basic help about the available commands. You can also use this with a specific command to get information about that command:\n\n[my-first-app] $ help run\n\nNext: Setting-up your preferred IDE"
