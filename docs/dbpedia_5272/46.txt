After many uses, crayons break, become blunt, or get used down to their stubs. Rather than throw away broken crayons, recycle them for second round of coloring by turning them into new crayons. You can also do a variety of crafts with broken crayons and decorate holiday items with them so the colors get used in other ways in your home.
