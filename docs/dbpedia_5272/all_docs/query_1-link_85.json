        "text": "Look to your left. Look to your right. One of us is watching a show that’s so uninterested in originality that some character trots out that speech you’ve heard so many times before: One of you won’t finish this prestigious, grueling program.\n\nOften that spiel is delivered on doctor shows or lawyer shows, but on “Industry,” which premieres Monday on HBO, it happens in an elite investment bank in London. And that’s how most of the four episodes made available for review go: Familiar stories and beats just set in the world of finance instead of elsewhere, which means less emotional stakes but more scenes where people aggressively chew gum.\n\nIf this was “Grey’s Anatomy” — it wishes — our Meredith would be Harper (Myha’la Herrold), a savvy and driven underdog, with a few secrets. She’s part of a cadre of “grads” gunning for jobs at the bank, though it’s not clear what the jobs actually are and the differences between the various roles is one of the show’s persistent vagaries. Maybe that’s “Industry” commenting on capitalism wringing individuality out of us. Maybe.\n\nHarper says in her job interview that she considers banking to be “the closest thing to a meritocracy,” which might be a canny ploy, her ingratiating herself by feeding the executives their own favorite (if hilarious) myth. But it plays like something she truly believes. Later, in one of many druggy scenes, she says, “I actually wrote a paper on the moral case for capitalism.”\n\n“That must have been short,” her colleague jokes.\n\n“No, it was 8,000 words,” she says, snorting another line. But that’s the end of it. Neither she nor the show dwell on issues of morality, ethics or purpose.\n\nInstead, “Industry” retreats from complex adult drama to functional enough YA show. Everyone sure has some growing up to do! Ugh, roommate drama! Uh-oh, my crush likes my friend! Ack, I threw up! Will the guy who is clearly marked for death from the first five seconds of the show die?\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
