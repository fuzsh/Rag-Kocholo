        "text": "There's a whole host of upcoming video game movies on the way, adapting everything from classics to recent hits. Among the line-up, there's more from the Sonic universe and Uncharted, as well as new reimaginings of everything from Death Stranding to Pac-Man making their way to the big screen.\n\nWe've seen some memorable new video game adaptations recently, such as Knuckles and the Super Mario Bros movie, as well as some that haven't been such a hit (looking at you, Borderlands). However, there's so much more exciting stuff to come in the next few years. Alongside some long-awaited sequels, there are dozens of video game movies that have been in various stages of production over the past few years, such as Ghost of Tsushima and Gears of War.\n\nRead on below to find a roundup of all the upcoming video game movies announced so far.\n\nUpcoming video game movies\n\nAngry Birds 3\n\nBirds of a feather stick together in this threequel from Rovio. While plot details are thin on the ground, we have seen a high-flying teaser. In it, Red (Jason Sudeikis) gets into the series' trademark slingshot and takes to the skies.\n\nAs of right now, Angry Birds 3 is simply \"in production.\" We'll have more news - including cast and release windows - as we get it.\n\nBioShock\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nWelcome to Rapture. BioShock’s depiction of a Randian aquatic paradise sunk by greed and wild ambition almost demands a big-screen outing. After repeated attempts to adapt it elsewhere, Netflix has confirmed it’s working on a BioShock movie.\n\nI Am Legend director Francis Lawrence is helming the project while Michael Green (Logan, Blade Runner 2049) is on scripting duties. Little else is known of the BioShock movie, though Lawrence recently told GamesRadar that will have some \"new little twists\" for seasoned veterans who have already taken a trip under the sea.\n\nDeath Stranding\n\nA Death Stranding movie, in partnership with production company A24, is in the works.\n\nDeveloper Hideo Kojima has already said he will be \"deeply involved\" in \"producing, supervising, plotting, look, design and content of the film adaptation of DS, just not in charge of directing.\"\n\nReleased in 2019, Death Stranding featured Norman Reedus as Sam Porter Bridges, a courier attempting to connect a broken America in the wake of the apocalyptic 'death stranding' event. Kojima has stated, however, that it will not be a \"direct translation\" of the game.\n\nDetective Pikachu 2\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nPika-pi! Detective Pikachu has sleuthed his way to a sequel. Portlandia co-creator Jonathan Krisel is directing the feature, while Deadline reports that Ryan Reynolds, who voiced Pikachu in the original, could be involved in the upcoming feature.\n\nLive-action lead Justice Smith, meanwhile, isn't sure if he's back for more Poke-action. He told Screen Rant, \"I don't know if there is going to be a reunion. I've heard rumors that they might be doing a second one, but I don't know if I'm a part of it.\"\n\nDredge\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nDescribed as \"The Sixth Sense on Water\", hit indie game Dredge is being reeled in for a movie adaptation.\n\nThe title itself follows a fisherman who, while trawling the depths, encounters several Lovecraftian nasties lurking in the beyond.\n\nProduction company Story Kitchen's Dmitri M. Johnson, Mike Goldberg, Dan Jevons, and Timothy I. Stevenson said in a statement: \"Dredge is a captivatingly eerie and profoundly rich story that had us completely hooked from the very beginning!\"\n\nNo release date has been given for Dredge at the time of writing.\n\nDuke Nukem\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThe crude action hero pastiche famously spent a lot of time in development limbo for the long, long awaited video game Duke Nukem Forever. We hope it’s not a 14-year wait this time.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter says Cobra Kai creators Josh Heald, Hayden Schlossberg, and Jon Hurwitz will be producing alongside Dune and Godzilla’s production company Legendary, but that’s all we know at this early juncture.\n\nEl Paso, Elsewhere\n\nRelease date: TBC\n\nHands up, who had El Paso, Elsewhere on their bingo card of video game movies? If so, do you have the lottery numbers?\n\nThat isn't to say El Paso, Elsewhere isn't deserving of a big screen adaptation. Far from it. Still, the cult vampire shooter from Strange Scaffold went a little under the radar upon its release in 2023.\n\nThe film is set to follow James Savage (LaKeith Stanfield) as he battles with his toxic ex-girlfriend's plans to end the world. To save the day, James enters a reality-bending universe to face down his evil ex.\n\nFirewatch\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nFirewatch already feels tailor-made for a film. The 2016 narrative game, which featured lonely fire lookout Henry form a connection with his supervisor Delilah during a fateful stint in a National Forest, won critical acclaim upon its release for its strong dialogue and mystery-driven gameplay.\n\nAs luck would have it, developers Campo Santo partnered with Snoot Entertainment (as first mentioned by The Hollywood Reporter) to produce an adaptation of the game alongside Keith and Jess Wu Calder – though it’s still unconfirmed whether it’ll be a movie or TV show.\n\n\"Firewatch is a stunning accomplishment, a beautiful and heartbreaking piece of art,\" Jess Wu Calder said. \"I’m delighted that [developers] Sean and Jake are letting us ruin their perfect video game by turning it into a movie and/or TV show.\"\n\nFive Nights at Freddy's 2\n\nRelease date: Fall 2025\n\nA sequel to the scare-tastic Five Nights at Freddy's is in the works, with director Emma Tammi expected to return.\n\nJim Henson's Creature Shop, who brought the iconic animatronics to life in the first FNAF, is currently working on, well, something related to the movie, as revealed in a tease by production company Blumhouse.\n\nExcitingly, things seem to be rolling pretty soon; a 2025 release date is set – though it's currently unknown who will appear in the cast and which (if any) Five Nights at Freddy's game will be adapted in the horror sequel.\n\nWe've had our first look at the script for the sequel too, but there's a catch.\n\nGears of War\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThe thick-necked, chainsaw-wielding soldiers that make up Gears of War's cast have always felt tailor-made for the action movie treatment. Netflix is finally delivering the goods with the announcement that Gears is being adapted into \"a live-action feature film\" with an adult animated series also in the works. Expect to see Gears' motley crew of battle-hardened COGs fight waves of locusts on the planet of Sera in the near future. Dune co-writer Jon Spaihts has been confirmed to pen the script, per Variety.\n\nGhost of Tsushima\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nGhost of Tsushima took PlayStation by storm upon its release in 2020. Sucker Punch’s samurai epic – which told the tale of Jin Sakai fighting back after a Mongol invasion of his home island – has sold close to 10 million copies.\n\nPlayStation Productions will be hoping that success translates to theater tickets. John Wick director Chad Stahelski is on board and he’s already spoken of his intentions to have a completely authentic Japanese cast.\n\n\"Honestly, it's probably the same things that would scare the shit out of most people. It's a fantasy period piece,\" the director told Collider. \"It's done with reverence to Akira Kurosawa, who's probably in the top five biggest influences of my life as far as film goes. It's a chance to push technology and people in a story that's timeless. While we're still waiting on a solid release date, Stahelski said last year that the movie does have a script.\n\nIt Takes Two\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nAs per Variety, Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson is producing this adaptation of Hazelight Studio’s inventive platform adventure. It Takes Two, which took home Game of the Year at the 2021 Game Awards, revolves around a bickering couple who are trapped in the bodies of their daughters’ dolls. Naturally.\n\nTo find their way back home, they must overcome hardship – and eventually rekindle their failing marriage – to return to their human forms.\n\nThe Rock is reportedly in line to star in It Takes Two – though nothing as been confirmed as of writing.\n\nJust Cause\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nJust Cause has hit a few snags in its long journey to cinemas. In 2017, Jason Momoa was attached to play revolutionary Rico Rodriguez with Brad Peyton directing.\n\nPeyton eventually dropped out, with John Wick creator Derek Kolstad jumping on board as producer and writer. Michael Dowse, director of Stuber, is now also attached to the project, though Momoa’s status is unclear. Don’t worry, though the main selling point is still here: the grapple hook is reportedly going to be part of the Just Cause movie. If the games are any indication, expect sun-kissed vistas, tons of explosions, and insane stunts.\n\nMega Man\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThe Blue Bomber doesn’t feel like prime material for a cinematic reinvention – yet here we are.\n\nThe legendary video game icon has bleeped and blooped his way through decades of rock-hard platformers, taking down arch nemesis Dr. Wily and his legion of Robot Masters across several console generations. Now, it seems, Mega Man is finally making the jump from consoles to a cinematic adventure.\n\nNetflix is bringing the Mega Man movie to life alongside writers and directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (Catfish, Paranormal Activity 3).\n\nMetal Gear Solid\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nMetal Gear?! That’s right: Konami and Hideo Kojima’s legendary stealth franchise is sneakily making its way to cinemas.\n\nDirected by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (of Kong: Skull Island fame), Metal Gear Solid will see Oscar Isaac slip into the Sneaking Suit of Solid Snake.\n\nSpeaking to EW, Vogt-Roberts outlined his plan to \"create a new type of action on screen that also is based in the quietness of the stealth\" but that we shouldn’t expect a “one-to-one” translation of the video game experience. So hour-long CODEC calls about nuclear disarmament are probably off the table. In 2024, an update on the project came from producer Ari Arad, who said work on the script is currently underway.\n\nMinecraft\n\nRelease date: April 4, 2025\n\nMinecraft is the Tetris of our age: instantly recognizable, a true mainstream hit – and appeals to all ages. Perfect for a film, then? That’s what Warner Bros. will be hoping for anyway.\n\nOriginally set for March 4, 2022, the Minecraft movie was originally conceived as \"the story of a teenage girl and her unlikely group of adventurers\" who have to save the block-filled Overworld from the Ender Dragon. That has changed recent months with Aquaman star Jason Momoa attached to the film alongside Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Jack Black. Jared Hess (Napoleon Dynamite) is set to direct.\n\nDanielle Brooks has recently teased the \"lifelike\" feel of the Minecraft movie in an new interview with Variety.\n\n\"I don’t know how to play the game but I know the world and the movie is pretty magical. It’s so lifelike,\" Brooks said.\n\n\"I don’t know how much I can share, but I do know fans will not be disappointed with the world they’ve created. We obviously do some green screen, but we got all the things there. Basically, all your senses are being used. You have the world for your sight but also for an actor, the smells of certain things.\"\n\nMortal Kombat 2\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nGet over here! Fresh off the surprise success of Mortal Kombat on HBO Max in 2021 comes news of a sequel. As per Deadline, Moon Knight’s Jeremy Slater is penning the script and Simon McQuoid returns as director. Karl Urban is the headline newcomer, playing movie star Johnny Cage.\n\nThe sequel, though, should answer fans’ calls for a tournament – and also deal with the returning threat of Outworld. At the very least, it should be better than 1997’s poorly-received Mortal Kombat: Annihilation. Mortal Kombat 2 has finished filming, though producer Todd Garner warned it will be a \"while\" before we see it. At least we have Cage's obnoxious belt buckle to tide us over until then.\n\nMortal Kombat 2 still star Tati Gabrielle (Uncharted) as Jade, Adeline Rudolph (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Kitana, Martyn Ford (F9) as Shao Kahn, Desmond Chiam (Falcon and The Winter Soldier) as King Jerrod, Damon Herriman (Justified) as Quan Chi, C.J. Bloomfield (Furiosa) as Baraka, and Ana Thu Nguyen (One Night) as Sindel.\n\nSeveral actors also return from the 2021 original, with Bi-Han actor Hiroyuki Sanada featuring alongside familiar faces such as Lewis Tan’s Cole, Sonya Blade (Jessica McNamee), and Joe Taslim (Bi-Han).\n\nPac-Man\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nArcade machines couldn’t contain the pellet-popping video game icon forever. Pac-Man is wakka-wakka’ing his way into cinemas in a live-action adventure according to The Hollywood Reporter. Let’s hope Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde join him up on the big screen.\n\nPortal\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nYou’d be forgiven for forgetting that the Portal movie was even a thing. Quietly announced way back in 2013, the adaptation of Valve’s hilarious portal-based puzzler is finally moving again.\n\n\"We actually do have a script that’s being written for the Portal movie now at [Warner Bros.]. We’re really excited about the take and the pitch, so it feels like that thing’s finally on the rails,\" producer J.J. Abrams told IGN. For now, we sit and wait – and hope the script (and the cake) isn’t a lie. You monsters.\n\nSaints Row\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nThe recent Saints Row remake may have received a middling reception, but Saints Row – as far as we know – is still being adapted into a movie. The one-time GTA rival found its funny bone in later years, but the movie’s writer Greg Russo has announced his intentions to take inspiration from the likes of The Warriors and Escape From New York for the script. F. Gary Gray (The Fate of the Furious) is set to direct.\n\nSifu\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nOne of the most recent projects on this list to spring into life, Sifu is all set to be adapted to live-action by John Wick creator Derek Kolstad.\n\nDeadline reports that the adaptation of Sloclap's hard-as-nails beat 'em up was the subject of a \"competitive pursuit\" from several production companies before Kolstad's Story Kitchen won out. It even has a killer elevator pitch: John Wick meets Old.\n\nSlime Rancher\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nSlime Rancher is one of Steam's highest-rated games of all time, so it stands to reason that the kooky adventure game will comfortably make the leap to theaters. Derek Kolstad's Story Kitchen is attached to develop.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 3\n\nRelease date: December 20, 2024\n\nOne of the very few upcoming video game movies with a confirmed release date, Sonic 3 might be the blueprint (emphasis on blue) for all future titles making the leap from consoles to cinema.\n\nNot only did Sonic the Hedgehog 2 gross over $400m, the original movie took fan complaints about the Blue Blur’s design on board and tweaked it to great success.\n\nSonic 3, then, should be a perfect mix of critical and commercial acclaim – and Shadow the Hedgehog will appear again after his cameo in the Sonic 2 post-credits scene, likely played by Keanu Reeves. Jeff Fowler is once again back to direct, with Sonic (Ben Schwartz) being joined by Knuckles (Idris Elba) and Tails (Colleen O’Shaughnessey).\n\nSonic producer Toby Ascher confirmed in an interview with GamesRadar+ that the threequel would \"take a lot\" from 2001 classic Sonic Adventure 2.\n\nStray\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nYep, Stray is purring its way into cinemas. Currently in the works at Annapurna's animation studio, the adventure will likely follow the plot of the stealth game. There, players controlled a stray cat who had to navigate a post-apocalyptic world filled with various nasties - and a friendly robot named B-12.\n\nSpace Channel 5\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nFew could have predicted Space Channel 5 would have been plucked from (relative) obscurity to make its way to the big screen. Still, the SEGA Dreamcast cult classic is coming to cinemas. According to THR, it has a deliciously madcap premise that follows the plot of the original 1999 title.\n\nSpace Channel 5 \"tells the story of a hapless fast-food worker who is recruited by a freedom reporter from the future to save the world from aliens using the one thing that unites all people on the planet: our love of silly viral dances.\" Cosmic.\n\nStreets of Rage\n\nRelease date: TBA\n\nDerek Kolstad is set to have a busy few years. The John Wick creator is also involved in this adaptation of classic co-op side scrolling beat 'em up Streets of Rage.\n\n\"When [dj2 Entertainment's Dmitri M. Johnson] first mentioned the idea of cracking a Streets of Rage movie, I was so immediately freaking in,\" Kolstad said in a statement (via Deadline). \"And to play with Sega? The 10-year-old me is still grinning.\"\n\nThe Division\n\nRelease date: N/A\n\nJake Gyllenhaal and Jessica Chastain were set to star in The Division on Netflix, though there's been a worrying update in recent years.\n\nDirector of Netflix smash hit Red Notice Rawson Marshall Thurber was all set to helm the adaptation of Ubisoft’s squad shooter.\n\n\"I’m so thrilled about it,\" Thurber told us in late 2021. \"We’re in the middle of the latest rewrite and I think we’re going to start shooting [next year]. It’s my next movie, Jake and Jessica are fired up and ready to go. With any luck, we’ll film in 2022 and I’m incredibly excited.\"\n\n2022 and most of 2023 went by without a peep. An update from producer Kelly McCormick in an interview with Discussing Film suggested it's not moving forward.\n\n\"To be honest, when COVID hit, we left The Division because it felt like it was a documentary,\" she said. \"I think we could find love for it again. It’s such a cool property and what you could do with the imagery of a team of agents coming in with that kind of post-apocalyptic prospect is really amazing, but we actually did end up letting it go because we got moved away by COVID.\"\n\nThe Legend of Zelda\n\n\"I have been working on the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda for many years now with Avi Arad-san, who has produced many mega hit films,\" Shigeru Miyamoto said in a statement on Twitter. \"I have asked Avi-san to produce this film with me, and we have now officially started the development of the film with Nintendo itself heavily involved in the production. It will take time until its completion, but I hope you look forward to seeing it.\"\n\nWith that, The Legend of Zelda movie was born. It's all set to be live-action, too, with Hunter Schafer being hyped up by fans as one of the frontrunners to play Zelda. The production is a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony Pictures, who brought Uncharted to life on the big screen.\n\nTomb Raider\n\nRelease date: N/A\n\n2018’s Tomb Raider saw Alicia Vikander pick up the adventuring bug – and eventually Lara Croft’s iconic twin pistols – as part of what was envisioned as a new movie franchise. A sequel was planned, first with The Meg’s Ben Wheatley as director, then Lovecraft Country’s Misha Green. The follow-up eventually fell through after a \"bidding war\" between studios erupted over the Tomb Raider movie rights.\n\nLara Croft’s cinema future may be cloudy right now – but a TV show is in the works over at Amazon and an anime series is coming to Netflix.\n\nUncharted 2\n\nDespite radio silence on the project for some time, it has recently been confirmed that Uncharted 2 is still happening.\n\nTom Holland is expected to return as the charming adventurer Nathan Drake, as is Mark Wahlberg's wisecracking Sully. Given out the first movie's post-credits scene ended, we wouldn't be surprised if this outright adapts Naughty Dog's initial 2007 game Drake's Fortune.\n\nWatch Dogs\n\nBased on Ubisoft's open-world series, Watch Dogs features Tom Blyth and Sophie Wilde starring in the latest video game adaptation to head to cinemas. Mathieu Turi is set to direct.\n\nThe 2014 original title saw players take on the role of vigilante hacker Aiden Peace. Two sequels, Watch Dogs 2 and the London-based Watch Dogs: Legion, followed in 2016 and 2020 respectively.\n\nYakuza\n\nRelease date: N/A\n\nReal Kiryu-chan fans will know all about the 2007 live-action Yakuza movie. This is a different beast entirely.\n\nAccording to a Variety report in 2020, 1212 Entertainment and Wild Sheep Content will produce – though no casting or director news has been announced since then.\n\n“Yakuza offers us a new playground in which to set compelling stories with complex characters in a unique environment that audiences have rarely seen before. The saga of Kazuma Kiryu has a built-in cinematic appeal – a mix of kinetic action with bursts of comedy, multiple converging storylines, and a gripping journey towards redemption,” 1212 Entertainment said at the time.\n\nA Yakuza TV show has since been announced, meaning this film could be dead and buried for the time being. Read what the cast had to tell us exclusively about the project."
