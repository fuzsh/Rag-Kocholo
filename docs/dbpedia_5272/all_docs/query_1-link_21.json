        "text": "Let’s talk about a subject that’s honestly a bit uncomfortable to some marketers.\n\nCompetition.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what industry you’re in–marketing is a game of competing for the attention of your audience. With so many marketing channels available today, that competition is oftentimes fierce.\n\nThink about it.\n\nCompetition for traffic, ad placement, followers and sales. The list goes on and on. And while the idea of conducting competitive analysis isn’t particularly “fun,” it’s absolutely necessary aspect of business intelligence.\n\nWhy competitor analysis tools are a must-have\n\nThe good news, though? There are a ton of competitor analysis tools out there to help you quickly and efficiently assess how you stack up against your top competitors.\n\nAnd with the right tools on deck, you can spend less effort trying to dig dirt on your competitors and more time actually marketing.\n\nRather than spending too much time trying to spy on your competitors, why not let some smart tools do the legwork for you?\n\nWhat tools can be used for competitor analysis?\n\nCompetitor analysis can be done in a lot of different ways and with a number of different tools. Any type of tool that lets you monitor your brand and others can be used to spy on the competition and draw invaluable competitive insights.\n\nA few different types of tools include:\n\nSocial media management tools\n\nCompetitive monitoring and social listening tools\n\nKeyword tools\n\nAnalytics tools\n\nAI tools\n\nWe’ve broken down a comprehensive list of the different types of competitor analysis tools that’ll help you get started:\n\nCompetitor analysis tools for social media\n\nAI-powered competitor analysis tools\n\nCompetitor analysis tools for SEO\n\nCompetitor analysis tools for content\n\nCompetitor analysis tools for email, ads and industries\n\nCompetitor analysis tools for social media\n\n1. Sprout Social\n\nWith social media ranked the No. 1 channel for connecting with customers, there’s no better starting point for competitive analysis.\n\nSprout Social enables you to understand competitor performance on social media from multiple angles and data points.\n\nYou can use Sprout’s suite of competitive reports to assess and optimize your social strategy with rich data points you can track across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nWhether you want to get a sneak peek at what your competitors are posting or benchmark your growth against the average of the profiles being compared, it’s all a click away, minus the tedious manual research and messy spreadsheets.\n\nUp your analytics game with Sprout’s Premium Analytics tool that offers deeper insights into your social platforms, along with interactive charts and graphs that you can customize to align with your goals.\n\nSprout offers the same competitive analytics on Instagram too.\n\nAnd you can dive even deeper using Sprout’s Advanced Listening tool.\n\nBy tapping into publicly available social conversations, you can quickly find out how consumers feel about your competitors’ products and services, as well as examine your own share of voice in your industry.\n\nWith direct access to consumer sentiment, Sprout makes it easy to identify opportunities to differentiate your brand from competitors.\n\n2. Phlanx\n\nThis Instagram engagement calculator clues you in on how active any given account’s followers are. This is an awesome resource to analyze your competitor’s Instagram presence. Plus, it doubles as a way to figure out whether or not an influencer has a legitimate following.\n\nPhlanx’s engagement ratio is calculated based on the number of followers an account has versus the rate that followers interact with content (likes, comments, etc).\n\nFor example, Trader Joes has an engagement rate of 2.56%. This is a fair score for a larger brand that posts on a consistent basis.\n\nBut compare that to the likes of Denny’s, well known for their cult-like social following and rabid fans:\n\nThis score isn’t the be-all, end-all of a brand’s Instagram presence, but it does offer some much-needed perspective.\n\nTake Adidas, one of the most followed accounts out there, for example. They do get an insane amount of engagement on their posts, but it’s low relative to their massive follower count.\n\nThis speaks to a bigger point about competitive analysis on social media. Context matters. It’s easy to get caught up in follower counts, but engagement is arguably a much more important metric.\n\n3. Social Blade\n\nA fun tool for checking out bigger brands is Social Blade. It assesses follower counts on the likes of Twitter, Instagram and YouTube among other services. Although often used to assess the popularity of celebrities and YouTubers, there are some interesting insights here for marketers.\n\nFor example, their Twitter competitor analysis applies a “grade” based on their average number of retweets and likes.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Social Blade provides a day-by-day follower update as well as a live follower count.\n\nAnother cool feature is the ability to stack brands’ social presences against each other.\n\nAI-powered competitor analysis tools\n\n4. Kompyte\n\nKompyte is a competitive intelligence tool that automatically pulls competitor updates into a single, easy-to-monitor dashboard. This includes updates from their website, review sites, content, social media, ads, job openings and more.\n\nEasily monitor competitor updates so you can keep a clear eye out on what other brands in your industry are doing online. Plus, Kompyte helps put together sales battlecards based on your competitive findings that your team can use to close sales.\n\n5. Crayon\n\nCompetitor analysis tools for SEO\n\n6. SEMRush\n\nSEMRush is one of the most widely-used SEO tools on the market, but its competitor analysis features set them apart from the pack. For starters, you can use SEMRush to pull your competitor’s backlinks and monitor changes in their ranking.\n\nHere’s a sample dashboard after running a domain analysis for FreeCodeCamp:\n\nAnd here’s the piece of the analysis which provides a by-the-numbers view of who’s competing for their keywords:\n\nThis is an invaluable tool for understanding who your competition is from a strictly SEO perspective. Likewise, highlighting what keywords are targeted by competitors directly influences your own content strategy.\n\n7. Ahrefs\n\nAnother staple competitor analysis tool for SEO is Ahrefs’ site explorer, which allows you to check any URL’s top organic keywords. Additionally, you get a rough estimate of how much traffic a competitor receives on those keywords.\n\nIt’s easy to check out a site’s highest-performing content based on backlinks (as opposed to shares) too. This information teaches you what sort of products or messaging is working best for a brand.\n\nAnd in addition to highest-performing content, you assess what keywords bring in the most traffic to a competing site.\n\nThe takeaway here? Your competition’s traffic doesn’t have to be a guessing game when you’re regularly running your own reports.\n\n8. MozBar\n\nThis browser extension from Moz provides a surface-level view of how authoritative a site is in the eyes of Google. Based on Moz’s own metric of domain authority (DA), MozBar assigns sites a DA score based on its likelihood to rank in search engines (based on factors such as backlinks). The higher the DA score, the better.\n\nSettled atop your browser, the MozBar is a useful tool to quickly determine a site’s search potential performance at a glance.\n\nWhen enabled, you also see how competing sites compare in a Google query.\n\nMozBar allows you to conduct a sort of passive competitive analysis as you examine competing sites to figure out how long they’ve been around and whether or not they’re winning backlinks.\n\n9. Buzzsumo\n\nBuzzsumo allows you to look at the top-performing content for relevant topics for your brand and specific competitors. The tool looks at a piece of content’s engagement on social sites as well as its total shares across the web.\n\nNot only does this clue you in on who’s killing it in terms of industry content, but also it helps you identify potentially hot topics to explore yourself.\n\nWhether you’re looking for movers and shakers in your industry or simply a new idea for a blog post, Buzzsumo provides you with definitive answers.\n\n10. Similarweb\n\nSimilarweb is an insanely comprehensive tool for both content and SEO. The tools helps you dig deep into your competitor’s content and where their traffic comes from.\n\nFor example, you can determine a site’s referral traffic and likewise where a site ends up sending its visitors.\n\nAnd more importantly, for content marketers, you see what topics visitors search for and what other relevant sites they visit.\n\n11. Feedly\n\nIf you’re looking for a way to keep an eye on a competitor’s content without checking up on their blog constantly, look no further than Feedly.\n\nFeedly is a content aggregator that stores and organizes content as it’s published, including that of your competitors. This allows you to see hot topics covered by your competitors, all on one page.\n\nCompetitor analysis tools for emails, ads and industries\n\n12. Mailcharts\n\nEmail marketing is arguably one of the most tedious channels for competitive analysis.\n\nRecognizing this, Mailcharts aggregates emails from competing campaigns to help influence your own. In addition to grabbing subject lines, Mailcharts pulls data such as send frequency and compares it to your business’ campaigns to see where your emails stand.\n\nAdditionally, the tool compares your campaigns to their own massive library of marketing emails to ensure you’re in tune with best practices (think: timing, frequency, subject line length, etc).\n\nNot only is Mailcharts a powerful competitor analysis tool, but its website offers a ton of email examples to draw inspiration. Pulling from some of the biggest campaigns out there, you get a better idea of what today’s top-performing emails look like.\n\n13. Owletter\n\nThis tool automatically aggregates emails from competitors and organizes them into a simple, user-friendly dashboard. Owletter’s analytics spots changes in your competitors’ email frequency, and likewise picks up on trends to help you optimize when you should send your own emails.\n\nThis represents an efficient, data-driven alternative to keeping up a dummy email account to spy on your competitors.\n\n14. iSpionage\n\nIf you’re interested in a competitor’s paid ads, iSpionage is definitely for you. This tool analyzes multiple aspects of PPC campaigns, including how many keywords a brand is targeting on AdWords:\n\nAdditionally, you see what their target PPC keywords.\n\nYou also see who else competes for PPC ads for a particular topic, in addition to how much they’re projected monthly budget is:\n\nFor brands considering PPC, such a tool is essential for keeping realistic expectations for ad spend.\n\n15. Owler\n\nLast but not least, this industry analysis tool uses community data to curate data and content from startups relevant to your niche. Again another tool reserved for bigger brands, you input brands to create your own custom dashboard of industry names to watch.\n\nAnd that wraps up our list!\n\nHow do you do a competitor analysis?\n\nWhile each of these tools can effectively help you analyze your competitors, you also need to keep in mind what happens after you run the numbers. Follow these steps to make the most of your competitive intelligence strategy.\n\nAnalyze your actual competitors\n\nThere’s no use in trying to punch above your weight. A local coffee shop with 1,000 followers shouldn’t beat themselves up because they don’t have as many followers as Starbucks or Dunkin’ Donuts.\n\nAs noted earlier, context matters. Sure, take a look at what the big players in your industry are doing. But when assessing your competition, focus first on those who are the most similar in terms of size and target audience.\n\nFocus on metrics first\n\nWhen looking at competitors, it’s tempting to obsess over messaging.\n\nHowever, it’s more prudent to take a data-driven approach to analysis first. Try to pick out as many metrics before trying to break down the “why” of their marketing.\n\nFor example, how often do your competitors post new content? What’s the ratio of promotional versus non-promotional posts? What are their top-performing keywords and hashtags?\n\nThe answers to these questions are arguably as important as understanding someone’s messaging.\n\nTurn analysis into action\n\nFinally, make sure the data you uncover translates into some sort of action.\n\nMaybe you uncover a new set of keywords to target in your content based on your research. Perhaps you haven’t been pushing your content nearly hard enough based on how active your competitors are.\n\nEither way, the end game of competitive analysis is to improve your own marketing strategy. The more information you glean from competitors, the better.\n\nWhich competitor analysis tools are you using?\n\nCompetitive analysis is a crucial component of fine-tuning your marketing strategy. By using the right set of tools, you can run your analysis quickly and actually spend more time focusing on your own efforts.\n\nEager to get started? Check out our step-by-step guide to social media competitive analysis today."
