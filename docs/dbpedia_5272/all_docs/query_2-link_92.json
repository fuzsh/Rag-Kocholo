        "text": "Crayon scratch art is a traditional kids art project because it is easy, fun and has surprising colorful artwork results. This scratch art works great for kids of all ages, even younger children like preschoolers. You will only need a few supplies and this simple art project is fun to do at home or in the classroom.\n\nEasy Scratch Art for Kids\n\nCrayon art is a childhood favorite for most kids. Here is a great craft for kids that uses wax crayons and poster paint. Kids will have fun learning how to make scratch art and making some unique colorful creations.\n\nRelated: Try making rainbow scratch art\n\nOne of my favorite childhood art activities was crayon art, particularly crayon scratch art. I loved creating these beautiful pictures with their bright rainbow colors. The bright colors just seem to pop so brilliantly against the dark black background.\n\nI just knew this would be a hit with my son so we gave it a try.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links.\n\nWax Crayon Scratch Art\n\nSupplies Needed to Make Scratch Art with Crayons\n\nPiece of white paper, card stock or light colored construction paper\n\nWax crayons\n\nBlack poster paint (or black crayon)\n\nLarge paint brush\n\nWooden stylus, craft stick, bamboo skewer or other scratching tool\n\n(Optional) Table covering like wax paper, parchment paper or craft paper\n\nHow to Make Scratch Art with Wax Crayons\n\nShort Video on How to Make Scratch Art with Kids\n\nSuggested Area Preparation\n\nBecause this artwork is done all the way to the edge of the paper, it is a good idea to prepare the surface under the art by covering with wax paper, parchment paper or craft paper to allow the mess to go off the page without harming the table.\n\nStep 1 – Cover Paper with Bright Color Blocks\n\nBegin by coloring a blank paper, card stock or light colored construction paper with crayons. Cover the entire page and don’t leave any white paper showing:\n\nBright colors work best – you want colors that will stand out against the black paint that will be applied in the next step.\n\nBlocks of color will create an even more beautiful effect for the final picture. We love to use many different colors.\n\nNote: My son is four and he scribbled bright colors across the page and that worked just fine. Older children however, will be able to create blocks of color such as in the photo above.\n\nStep 2 – Cover Colorful Blocks with Black Paint or Crayon\n\nNext, use a large brush to paint black poster over the entire picture. We added a little paint into a small bowl to make it easier to paint.\n\nAlternate Method: When I used to do this as a child, I would cover the entire picture with black crayon and that worked great too.\n\nNote: If your kids have never done this before, they might find it pretty funny to be painting over their artwork like this, but they’ll be delighted at the next step.\n\nStep 3 – Scratch the Black Canvas to Reveal the Colorful Foundation\n\nWhen the black paint has dried completely, start scratching!\n\nWe used a bamboo skewer. A popsicle stick, chopstick or empty ball point pen would also work. The trick is to find something sharp enough to scratch away the paint, but safe enough for kids to use.\n\nSo many fun effects can be created, and the rainbow that is revealed as the paint is scratched away is just so beautiful.\n\nI think what makes this activity so much fun is the element of surprise. You just never know quite how the picture will turn out until you start scratching away and reveal the surprise underneath!\n\nMore Easy Art Projects from Kids Activities Blog\n\nLet’s make bubble art by bubble painting\n\nCrayon Art for Preschoolers\n\nOh so many handprint art ideas for kids of all ages…even little ones!\n\n20+ Art Ideas with Wax Crayons\n\nFun arts and crafts for kids\n\nMake sidewalk chalk painting with this fizzy homemade recipe\n\nTry these outdoor kid art project ideas…oh so much fun!\n\nPreschoolers love our process art ideas.\n\nHomemade scratch and sniff paint for kids\n\nToo many broken crayons?
