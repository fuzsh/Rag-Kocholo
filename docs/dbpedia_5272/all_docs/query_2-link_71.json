        "text": "For Latino actor, director and producer Eugenio Derbez, starring in the award-winning film “CODA” gives him a platform to do something he’s been wanting to do: debunk stereotypes.\n\n“I’m glad because they are giving me an opportunity to break the stereotypes,” said the 59-year-old Derbez, a Mexican-born actor who has worked in Mexico for most of his career but moved to the U.S. seven years ago to work in Hollywood.\n\n“I was complaining that when (directors) call me because I’m Latino, they were always offering the roles of the gardener or the drug lord or the criminal. Now that I can portray a music teacher, I feel that I’m breaking stereotypes, and that is going to be really helpful for the Latino community.”\n\nHe said one of his biggest challenges was learning a different language — in this case, English — when he arrived in the U.S., but emphasized that breaking out of the Mexican typecasts has been a greater challenge.\n\nBut it’s a challenge he was able to overcome with the film “CODA,” an acronym for children of deaf adults.\n\nDerbez is proud to show Hollywood he is Mexican and likes to show his community his authenticity by always incorporating Spanish into his films, which includes “Overboard,” and “Instructions Not Included.”\n\n“I’m always putting some words in Spanish, so people know that I’m from Mexico and I have an accent,” Derbez said. “That makes the character more interesting.”\n\nThis film, he said, is different from other projects he has worked on because he tends to always play the comedian. This time, Derbez took on the role of a choir instructor who helps pursue the goals of a 17-year-old high school girl who wants to audition for the music program of a prestigious university.\n\n“I do comedies, and this is one of the few times in my career where I can portray a dramatic role,” Derbez said. “I was very, very excited about this, about the idea of doing drama.”\n\nThe entertainment industry-centric publication Variety recently named Derbez to its Variety500 list, which honors “influential business leaders shaping the global media industry.” It named him as one of the most influential Hispanic males in the world, and the actor says this is an honor he’ll gladly accept but is quick to add he knows it’s something he cannot take lightly.\n\n“It is a great responsibility — huge because when you can influence other people, you have to be careful of what you say, of the roles you choose,” Derbez said. “You can’t imagine how many roles I have rejected because of that, because I feel that it’s not the good message for my community, for my people, for my audience, and I have to be more responsible when I tweet, when I post a picture.”\n\nIn the film, actress Emilia Jones portrays Ruby Rossi, a 17-year-old high school girl. She’s the only hearing member of her deaf family and is referred to as the child of deaf adults — Jackie and Frank Rossi, played by Marlee Matlin and Troy Kotsur, actors who are part of the deaf community.\n\nDerbez said it was his first time working with actors who are deaf. This challenged him on set because of communication conflicts, but he added it was a great learning experience and was blown away by the actors’ talents.\n\n“I learned that the (deaf community) is huge and amazing,” Derbez said. “They have amazing actors, talented actors.\n\n“If you watch the movie, you’ll love Troy, Marlee and Daniel. They are not good; they’re amazing!” added Derbez, who learned some American Sign Language to be able to communicate with his co-stars.\n\nDerbez said Hollywood should hire more deaf writers to write stories about their community because it is rarely seen, and it is important for these stories to be told.\n\n“(The deaf community has) tons of anecdotes, stories related to how they see the world from their perspective,” he said.\n\nThe beauty of “CODA,” Derbez said, is that it’s not just a movie for the deaf community but a movie that everyone can connect with.\n\n“Hopefully ‘CODA’ is going to be like a door that’s gonna open more opportunities for this community, for the deaf community,” Derbez said. “This movie is going to touch everyone’s heart.”\n\nAfter CODA was presented at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, it received four awards: the Special Jury Award for Ensemble Cast, the Directing Award, the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize.\n\nThe film will be available Aug. 13 in theaters and on Apple TV+."
