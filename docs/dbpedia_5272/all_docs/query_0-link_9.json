        "text": "The Humble Indie Bundle is back for a third round. A team of independent game developers has once again gotten together to sell a handful of independent games, at any price point you want, and will divide the earnings among creators and charities.\n\n[partner id=\"wireduk\"]The most recent promotion includes 2008's Independent Games Festival winner Crayon Physics Deluxe, which lets you draw out objects like flat planes, pivoting seesaws, wheels and ropes to guide a ball into a collection of stars.\n\nAnd Yet it Moves, from Broken Rules, is a papercraft puzzle game where you rotate the entire game world to guide your spiky haired hero to safety, while turning walls into floors, slides into platforms, and stacks of rocks into dangerous hazards.\n\nThere's also rock-hard retro-themed puzzle platformer VVVVVV from Terry Cavanagh and multiple award-winning steampunk tile-slider Cogs, from Lazy 8 Studios. Finally, Hammerfight is a frantic multiplayer combat game from Russia.\n\nAll the games would set you back about £30 if you bought them separately, but the Humble Indie Bundle lets you set your own price – as long as its more than a penny. You can also choose where your money goes – including to the game developers, the EFF, Child's Play and the Humble Bundle team.\n\nThe games are also DRM-free, most are redeemable on Steam and the games work cross-platform between PC, Mac and Linux.\n\nThe site also shows how many bundles have sold (92,000, at the time of writing) how much money has been made ($434,000) and the average price that is being spent by gamers on all three operating systems.\n\nLinux fans are the most magnanimous (spending $11 on average) while Windows zealots are the greediest (a paltry $4 per bundle, on average). Mac users float in the middle, spending around $6 for the five games, on average.\n\nSee Also:- More Games, Source Code Join ‘Humble Indie Bundle’\n\nPay What You Want For 5 Indie Games, Again\n\nName Your Own Price for World of Goo, Other Indie Games\n\nHow World of Warcraft Devs Launched One of the Biggest Unions in Video Games\n\nMicrosoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard created an environment that helped workers.
