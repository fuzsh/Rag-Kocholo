        "text": "Working from home sans child care while your kids are around is not an ideal scenario, but let's face it: it happens. Whether your little ones are off from school on a holiday, there's a snow day, or someone is feeling under the weather, there might be a plethora of reasons why you still have to get work done with them in the house. Sure, you can put on an episode of Cocomelon Lane â€”but that only lasts for so long, and chances are you don't want them in front of a screen all day.\n\nWe're here to help. We turned to experts and real parents for some activity ideas to keep your kids busy, so that you can focus on emptying your inbox and checking off your to-do list.\n\nFirst, Choose Activities that Promote \"Flow\" Play\n\nFlow play is the deepest form of playâ€”when kids are so into something that they get lost in it. Think about a toddler pouring water in the bathtub. \"You get in 'the zone.' And that feels wonderful at any age,\" says Susan K. Perry, Ph.D., a social psychologist and author of Playing Smart. Research shows spending time \"in flow\" helps kids build big life skills like resilience, creative thinking, and impulse control.\n\nBut those magical momentsâ€”when your child gets completely absorbed in playâ€”may seem few and far between just like the moments you can actually reply to an email. Enter these activities and play ideas for kids that fall into the \"flow\" category.\n\n\"Children are naturally really curious,\" says David Shernoff, PhD, an educational psychologist at Rutgers University. \"They readily become engrossed in an activity. As a parent, you need to set up the conditions to make that most likely.\"\n\nStart by choosing ideas that target your child's personal interests, get supplies together, then let them be. To really find flow, your kid needs chunks of time and permission to make a mess. \"If they feel judged or heavily watched by a parent, they are not going to get into a flow,\" says Jennifer Miller, author of Confident Parents, Confident Kids.\n\nSo, look for ways to control chaos without limiting creativity, like painting on the patio. Then don't disturb themâ€”not even with a whole-hearted \"good job!\" Kids learn best through trial and error.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that you don't need to get involved. Your role is to help get things started, then sit back and watch the magic begin! Here are some ideas to help keep your little busy while you get your own work done.\n\nCrafty Play Ideas for Kids\n\nAfter a quick tutorial from you, your kid will be ready to make a masterpiece.\n\nConstruct cute animals\n\nDig up a cardboard egg carton and a piece of cardboard. Cut a pointy section from the carton to be the creature's face, and glue it to the cardboard. Paint facial features (unicorn! piglet!) on the carton, and ears and body on the cardboard (for visuals, check out @nylah.khan). â€”Nylah Khan, a Los Angelesâ€“based art teacher\n\nSketch a life-size self-portrait\n\nUnfurl a few feet of butcher paper on the floor, have your child lie down on it, and then outline their body. Prop up a mirror nearby so they can fill in the details. â€”Miller\n\nGet sculpting\n\nTry no-mess papier-mÃ¢chÃ© to build 3D objects by using plaster cloth. Start off by making a bowl: Wet strips and wrap them around the bottom half of a balloon. Wait 30 minutes for the strips to harden, then pop the balloon. Add flair with paint or markers. For a next-level project, wrap strips around cardboard or Styrofoam to make dolls or masks. â€”Khan\n\nWatercolor to the extreme\n\nHave your kid draw a design on thick white paper using a black permanent marker. (We advise supervising this part!) On a piece of aluminum foil, have them use washable markers to create an abstract patternâ€”the more colors, the better. Spritz the paper with water and place it facedown on top of the foil; rub the two together gently to transfer the colors. Then it's all about the reveal: Ceremoniously peel back the paper to uncover the vibrant artwork your kid has created. Make sure to let it dry. â€”Khan\n\nBuild a dream playground\n\nLet your child raid the recycling bin, then grab a roll of tape and some ice-pop sticks, corks, and string to create an ultimate park of loop-the-loop slides, swings, and monkey bars for their tiny toys. â€”Lyndsey Wheeler, cofounder of Camp Supernow, a virtual after-school program\n\nUncover a secret message\n\nSo this is what white crayons are for! Have your child use one to draw patterns or write words, then paint over their work with watercolors. Watch as the wax pushes the water away in a process called resist art. â€”Khan\n\nNo paintbrush = no problem\n\nSkip the paintbrush and add texture to paintings by swapping in sponges, scrubbers, a comb, leaves, flowers, bath poufs, toy cars, LEGO bricks, blocks, cookie cutters, marbles (let kids roll them around with paper in a box), and, of course, fingers.\n\nSensory Play Ideas for Kids\n\nLet those little hands clutch, splosh, and pick their way through hands-on good times with these fun, sensory activities.\n\nGo bananas with shaving cream\n\nHave your kids hop into a dry bathtub with their swimsuit on. Add a bowl of warm water, a giant pile of shaving foam, and some toys. (Kids under 5 will need supervision.) Afterward, turn on the faucet and rinse it all away. â€”Lizzie Assa, founder of the Instagram account @theworkspaceforchildren\n\nFree the bears\n\nKeep a preschool-age child engaged while refining their (kid-safe) scissor skills: Drop a small plastic bear (or LEGO figure or Shopkins character) into each cup of a muffin tin, trap them with painter's tape, then tell your kid, \"The bears were captured and need your help to escape!\" â€”Beth Rosenbleeth, founder of Days With Grey\n\nSort stuff\n\nGive your 4- or 5-year-old buttons or pom-poms and then encourage them to divide the items into a muffin tin by size, shape, or color. Kids love to organize and put things into piles, and working with very small objects helps them drop into a flow state. â€”Dana Anderson, a Montessori teacher in Indian Rocks Beach, Florida\n\nAssemble a sensory bin\n\nFill a shallow storage container with a few pounds of dried black beans, then toss in some toys (plastic bugs, construction vehicles, action figures) for a tactile experience. Add cups, serving utensils, and funnels for scooping. When your child is done, snap on the lid and store the container for another day. â€”Renu Blankinship, founder of the Instagram crafting account @makermint\n\nPretend Play Ideas for Kids\n\nSuggest these make-believe scenarios to get your kid's dream world going:\n\nSet up an airport.\n\nHold a ceremony (like a wedding or a coronation).\n\nPlay restaurant.\n\nOpen a vet clinic or a hospital.\n\nTake a trip into space.\n\nRe-create a scene from a movie.\n\nPlaydough Play Ideas\n\nWhether homemade or store-bought, the squishy stuff is one of the best mediums for open-ended, imaginative fun. Pair a few colors with a rolling pin, a butter knife, and cookie cutters, and watch as your child becomes calmly industrious as they smash away, or introduce an exciting challenge:\n\nMake monsters by adding googly eyes, feathers, and pipe cleaners.\n\nHide pennies in a chunk of dough and ask your child to dig them out. (Be sure your kids are old enough to be around pennies for this one!)\n\nSee who can make the funniest face.\n\nPress in plastic bugs or dinosaurs to create \"fossils.\"\n\nUse alphabet cookie cutters to practice spelling words, or roll out the dough and shape letters by hand.\n\nTry to build a tall tower using toothpicks.\n\nImaginary Play Ideas\n\nA prop or two can kick-start their mind. Try out these imaginary play ideas.\n\nOpen a store\n\nAll you need is a toy cash register. Kids can come up with anything from pretend pizza parlors to make-believe malls. â€”Lauren Tingley, a first-grade teacher in Red Bluff, California, who blogs at Simply Well Balanced\n\nCreate a giant racecar track\n\nTack down painter's tape to construct a road system that spans a few rooms, runs up the walls, and goes under and over furniture. Upgrade your routes by decorating shoeboxes as buildings. â€”Miller\n\nEnlist a cardboard box\n\nWith markers and tape, a simple cardboard box can turn into a spaceship, a castle, a truck, or even a time machine. Need some inspo? Read Not a Box by Antoinette Portis, a picture book about a bunny who uses his imagination to make his own cubed creation. â€”Brooke Wetzel, a kindergarten teacher in Charlotte, North Carolina\n\nGo \"camping\"\n\nPitch a tent in the living room, and fill it with cozy blankets and sleeping bags for the ultimate hideout.

The goal: Complete the task on the move cube the number of times shown on the regular die. â€”Rosenbleeth\n\nDIY a parachute\n\nEasily re-create this gym-class hero with a bedsheet.

And don't forget this favorite: Crouch down low, lift up the sheet to catch air, and quickly sneak underneath for a moment of wonder together. â€”Anderson\n\nRethink sports\n\nPlay volleyball with a balloon, bowl a tennis ball into half-filled water bottles, kick a rolled-up sock into \"soccer net\" laundry baskets, or use brooms, a tennis ball, and tape-marked goals for hockey. â€”Marlene Heuer, a preschool teacher in Rochester, New York\n\nHit the rink\n\nTape wax paper to your kid's shoes, put on some classical music, and let them \"skate\" on the carpet. (Careful, kids, it's just as slippery as ice!) To skate on hardwood floors, try paper plates. â€”Heuer\n\nFood Play Ideas\n\nJuice up meal prep with a sous-chef by your side.\n\nGrab the skewers\n\nSnacks are better on a stick!

Show how to slide them onto a skewer, then let your kid practice making rainbows and different patterns. â€”Heather Staller, founder of Happy Kids Kitchen\n\nPrep veggies\n\nLet your kid go nuts tearing \"trees\" off a head of broccoli or cauliflower.
