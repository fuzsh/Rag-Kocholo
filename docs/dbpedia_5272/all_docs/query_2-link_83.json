        "text": "Director M. Night Shyamalan is springing his latest “Trap.”\n\nShyamalan’s new movie, which stars Josh Hartnett as a serial killer lured into a police sting operation while at a pop concert with his daughter, has made $2.2 million in previews at the box office.\n\nThe thriller is expected to open between $15 million and $20 million this weekend, but it will be no match for last week’s box office behemoth, Disney’s “Deadpool & Wolverine.” The Marvel blockbuster is on track to add between $75 million and $95 million in its second weekend, a drop of approximately 55% to 65% after its record-breaking $211 million. It had the year’s biggest weekend at the box office, broke the record for an R-rated opening and will dominate once again this week.\n\nWarner Bros.’ “Trap” follows Cooper (Hartnett), a father who takes his teen daughter Riley (Ariel Donoghue) to the sold-out concert for singer Lady Raven (played by R&B singer Saleka, who is Shaymalan’s daughter). In classic Shyamalan-twist fashion, Cooper is revealed to be a serial killer, called The Butcher, and the concert is actually a police ploy to capture him. The rest of the cast includes Kid Cudi, Hayley Mills, Tim Russ, Alison Pill and more.\n\nThe film will be going up against Universal’s “Twisters,” which is looking to whirl up $17 million to 19 million in its third weekend. The weekend’s other new release, Sony’s family friend “Harold and the Purple Crayon” starring Zachary Levi,” is predicted to make $6 million to $7 million. It made $725,000 in previews."
