        "text": "FASHIONOPOLIS\n\nThe Price of Fast Fashion and the Future of Clothes\n\nBy Dana Thomas\n\nThere is that old saying, usually attributed to Yves Saint Laurent: “Fashion fades, style is eternal.”\n\nLiterally speaking, that actually may no longer be true, especially when it comes to fast fashion. Fast-fashion brands may not design their clothing to last (and they don’t), but as artifacts of a particularly consumptive era, they might become an important part of the fossil record.\n\nMore than 60 percent of fabric fibers are now synthetics, derived from fossil fuels, so if and when our clothing ends up in a landfill (about 85 percent of textile waste in the United States goes to landfills or is incinerated), it will not decay.\n\nAnd it is Zara and other brands like it that have helped plant flags on the farthest reaches of the planet. In “Fashionopolis,” Dana Thomas, a veteran style writer, convincingly connects our fast-fashion wardrobes to global economic and climate patterns and crises, rooting the current state of the fashion biosphere as a whole — production methods, labor practices and environmental impacts — in the history of the garment industry.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
