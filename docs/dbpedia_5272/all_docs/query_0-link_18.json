        "text": "Video games weren’t always so easy. Players who know only the current generation of consoles must think of their favorite games as gentle, kindhearted, almost mothering in their ministrations — adapting themselves to the needs of the gamer, serving up big shiny arrows or straightforward explanatory text when things get confusing, and just generally showering kisses and encouragement every time someone skins a knee.\n\nNot all that long ago games were exacting, punishing, cruel. For more than a decade the economics of the arcade age — kill a player, get a quarter — influenced the spirit of the first games that were designed to be played at home, on televisions, even though they were sold for one fixed, all-you-can-play price. Three lives and you’re out. Quickly.\n\nIn a creative version of Stockholm syndrome, now that the generation that grew up playing these games is making games of its own, difficulty is seeing a resurgence, especially among indie games: those built by small teams, or even individuals, at independent developers that work outside of the industry’s studio system and its multimillion-dollar budgets. Many of these games make a fetish of how impossible they are. And Fez, a brilliant, intricate new game created by a two-person team in Montreal, might be the most impenetrable of them all."
