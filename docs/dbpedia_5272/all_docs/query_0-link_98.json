We absolutely couldn’t do this without you!\n\nUpdate #16 - Baby Hands - RTX Update!!\n\nBaby Hands was a hit at RTX!\n\nChicken Waffle had an amazing VR booth at RTX Austin! So many Baby Hands fans!\n\nA huge thank you to Rooster Teeth for their awesome support, and for featuring Baby Hands as a VR favorite at RTX! We had a great time, and it is always so cool to watch people enjoy our games! Lots of hilarious cosplayers in VR!\n\nWe crawl steadily onward toward the release of a huge multiplayer daycare extravaganza!\n\n(..and another cool unannounced huge feature;)\n\nMore big announcements coming soon! Thanks so much for your feedback and support! Without further adieu, here is a brief list of features and fixes added to this patch update:\n\nFixed the grab highlight functionality for the following items: xylophone mallets, frog hat, bear, gama man, car keys\n\nThe rainbow crayon would often spawn behind the crayon box. Spawn point is changed to an easily seen position on the table.\n\nEnabled players using the computer to move the paddle to the virtual tennis game during the countdown.\n\nFixed a number of issues with Albert Onion’s RPG Adventure: Bunnies no longer chase after Albert after the game ends. Keys and bunnies now respawn, and no more controlling the game when joystick isn't held. No longer does the timer countdown when the cartridge is taken out, and the game will reset after time ends or cartridge is removed.\n\nFanfare for finishing game is now a 3D sound, not to be played across the entire house!\n\nThe fire eye above the volcano is now repeatable, and lasts longer.\n\nThe jade key reveal sequence was tweaked to look a little cleaner:)\n\n…we also did lots of technical stuff to streamline future online processes, and game performance. Replaced renderer.material calls with renderer.sharedMaterial: Renderer.material calls to auto-instantiate materials. Using renderer.sharedMaterial when possible and manually managing instantiations when necessary to prevent performance and synchronization issues, of course!\n\n(Show that last paragraph to your Unity programmer friends..they’ll be impressed)\n\nAnother busy couple weeks of work and conferences, and all of it made possible by you, the people who follow and support Baby Hands!\n\nAs always, thank you so much!\n\nUpdate #14 - Baby Hands - Delivery Day!!\n\nOne year ago, we took a single week to build a funny prototype of a baby crawling around in a retro cartoon house for Classic Game Fest in Austin, Texas. We were asked by the conference organizers to come show off some cool VR games to the audience, and we racked our brains to design and prototype something funny that matched The reception was phenomenal, and we knew we had something truly awesome on our hands with Baby Hands! Chicken waffle has built and launched 19 other AR/VR games and experiences over the past year for some huge clients, all while continuing to build and polish hundreds of interactive toys and hilarious retro parodies! We are proud to announce that Baby Hands is leaving Early Access with a competitive new price of $19.99! We wanted to get Baby Hands into the hands of more players.

Reset to 3D sound, and volume adjusted.\n\nPerformance pass: corrected framerate drops when looking across house by adding occlusion across the house and taking other individual performance measures on individual items.\n\nAdded sound effects for the clogging the tub and completing each wave in balloon target game.\n\nWe will be back at Classic Game Fest 2018 this weekend, and RTX next weekend! So, come on by our booth to check out the game! ..and snag some free toys and candy:)\n\nWe hope to see all of you there, but for those we can’t thank in person, let us take this moment to do so now!
