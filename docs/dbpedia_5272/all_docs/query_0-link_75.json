        "text": "Which items are eligible for Pay Later?\n\nAll products with the blue Pay Later logo visible on the product page are eligible! Most pre-order items will have a Pay Later option as depicted below.\n\nHow do I pay for my Pay Later?\n\nYou can find your Pay Later Orders in \"My Account\" -> \"Order history and details”. From here, you can choose to show only \"pending\" (unpaid) Pay-Laters, and check which ones are to be released this month, so you will never miss a deadline again!\n\nCan I make my Pay Later in a currency other than Japanese Yen?\n\nYou will be able to see the equivalent price in your selected currency when placing your order. However, upon confirming your Pay Later order, the order will appear in Japanese Yen.\n\n*** Nin-Nin-Game is a Japanese company operating in Japanese Yen and therefore all our items and shipping prices are indexed in Japanese Yen. Our customers will be required to pay exactly the same amount in Japanese Yen as the original price when they booked. ***\n\nWhat happens if I do not pay my Pay Later order by the deadline?\n\nIf you forget to pay your Pay Later order, the system will automatically cancel your order and return the item back to stock. If you still wish to purchase the item, you can always remake your order normally, provided that it still is available. The Pay Later deadline will always be on the 14th of the item's original release date month.\n\n*** If your order contains multiple items with different Pay Later deadlines, your entire order must be paid for by the deadline of the item which will be released first. If you do not pay on time, your entire order will be cancelled by our system. In any case, you will be notified with reminder emails before the deadline. ***\n\nWhat happens if I cancel too many Pay Later Orders??\n\nAccounts with a greater ratio of cancelled than paid Pay Later Orders will be suspended from this privilege.\n\nWhat happens to the Pay Later Deadline if the manufacturer postpones the pre-order release date?\n\nIn most cases, the deadline will not change and we will still ask you to make the payment by the original deadline.\n\nI paid my Pay Later but the order status has not changed, is this normal?\n\nPlease wait 1-2 business days for the payment to be verified, as our team performs manual checks on all payments received. If your Pay Later order status does not change to \"Pre-order Payment Accepted” within a few days, please send us a ticket with your Payment ID and Pay Later order number.\n\nIs it possible to use a voucher to pay for a Pay Later order?\n\nVouchers must be applied when placing the initial Pay Later order. You will not be able to apply the voucher after the order has been placed, or when settling the payment.\n\nI received an invoice for additional costs, why?\n\nIt may happen that we contact you by email to ask you for an additional shipping cost. Your invoice will be sent to you in the form of a payment link and your order status will change to 'Insufficient Fee' or \"Unavailable Shipping Method\" then 'Awaiting Payment'. You will be able to click on the link, put it in your shopping cart and pay for it as you would for a normal item.\n\nWhat are the reasons for these additional charges?\n\nWe may send you an invoice for any of the following reasons:\n\n→ Your selected shipping method is no longer available due to unforeseen circumstances\n\n→ The shipping cost paid initially is insufficient compared to the actual shipping cost after packing\n\n→ The carriers have increased their prices or added additional costs (emergency costs, increased fuel, etc.)\n\n*** Manufacturers do not systematically communicate to us the final sizes of pre-order products.For this reason, it happens from time to time that once received at our warehouse, the size of the product is different than initially estimated. ***\n\nI paid my invoice, how long will it take to ship my order?\n\nPayment verification takes place Monday through Friday between 9:00am and 11:00am Japan time. Once the payment has been verified, the warehouse team will receive a notification that the invoice has been paid, and your package will ship immediately.\n\nI haven't paid my invoice, what will happen?\n\nIf we do not receive a response or payment within 7 days of sending you the invoice, we reserve the right to cancel your order and apply a 15% cancellation fee. Please check your emails and spam/junk folders carefully in order to not to miss our emails. For cancellations and refunds, please contact customer service within 7 days of receiving your invoice.\n\nCan I get refunded with a voucher for my order if I don't pay for my shipping invoice?\n\nWe will not be able to issue a voucher refund for customers who do not pay their shipping costs.\n\nHow does the Nin-Nin-Game loyalty point system work?\n\nFrom your first order, loyalty points are calculated at 5% of the value of the product purchased, and automatically appear in your account. Your loyalty points will be validated once your order has been shipped.\n\nHow are loyalty points calculated?\n\n1 point = 1 Japanese Yen, it's as simple as that!\n\nLoyalty Points are calculated using the sum of the product value, minus any deductions from applied coupons/vouchers.\n\nProduct Value: [(Product_1 + Product_2 + Product_3...) - (Voucher value)]\n\nProduct Value * 0.05 = Received Loyalty Points\n\n*** Shipping costs are not eligible for loyalty points ***\n\nHow can I turn my loyalty points into a voucher?\n\nYou can redeem them in the \"My loyalty points\" section and create a voucher to be used for future orders.\n\nYou may enter your voucher code in the box below in the shopping cart interface.\n\nHow long are my points valid?\n\nAll points have an expiration date of 1-year from issuance.\n\nHow long is my voucher valid?\n\nA store credit voucher have an expiration date of 1-year from issuance.\n\nIs it possible to use my voucher to pay for a Pay Later order?\n\nVouchers must be applied when placing the initial Pay Later order. You will not be able to use the voucher at the payment stage of the order in Pay Later.\n\nWhat happens if my voucher exceeds the amount of the order?\n\nIn this case, a new voucher will be automatically generated on your account with the remainder of the initial amount. Please note that your voucher can only cover product costs, and cannot cover shipping costs.\n\nWill my voucher be reactivated when an order is cancelled?\n\nWe will not be able to return your voucher if you used it for a canceled order.\n\nWhat is your policy regarding cancellations and refunds?\n\nIn Stock Items\n\nAs stated in our Terms and Conditions Section 2-5, no cancellations or refunds will be administered in full for paid orders. In the event that a cancellation is justified and approved by our customer service team, you will be entitled to a refund with a 15% cancellation fee applied. If you accept a refund with a voucher, the cancellation fee will be reduced to 10%.\n\nPre-Order Items\n\nCase 1: A paid pre-order.\n\nCancellation requests made before the 14th day (13th 23:59 JST) of the month of the product release date will be refunded with a 10% cancellation fee.\n\nCancellation requests after this time will be refunded with a 15% cancellation fee.\n\nFor Example: Product A - Releases on May 2022\n\nA cancellation made before May 14th 2022 will be refunded with a penalty of 10%\n\nA cancellation made from May 14th 2022 (13th 23:59 JST) will be refunded with a penalty of 15%\n\nIn the event of a Manufacturer Postponed Release, no cancellations will be exempt from the above rule.\n\nCase 2: An unpaid Pay Later\n\nYou can cancel your Pay Later by sending a ticket to customer support with the order reference.\n\n*** The Pay Later option will be suspended for accounts with a high cancellation rate. ***\n\nWarning:\n\nApproved refund requests for transactions made more than 6 months ago can only be refunded in Japanese Yen. If the transaction was made with a foreign currency, the exchange rate on the day of the transaction will be used for reimbursement in Japanese Yen.\n\nWhat is the refund time for my order?\n\nPlease allow up to 7 business days from the day the refund has been processed for it to appear in your bank account. Please be aware that for a payment made more than 6 months ago, additional time will be required to process your refund.\n\nCan I redeem a voucher on a canceled order?\n\nWe will not be able to return your voucher if you used it on a cancelled order. Therefore, please be very careful before deciding to use your voucher on an order that you might cancel.\n\nCan I request a cancellation/refund for an order that has already been shipped?\n\nWe are sorry but we cannot accept any cancellation, exchange or refund requests for orders that have already been shipped.\n\n⚠ Refund requests older than two years cannot be accepted, as some payment platforms do not retain information beyond two years.\n\n*** Nin-Nin-Game reserves the right to cancel any order/item for any reason. Reasons may include invalid stock quantities, pricing, system abuse, etc. (in this case, we will inform you of the reason why we chose to cancel your order/item.) ***\n\nWelcome to N2G's Received Damaged/Lost Goods Section. At Nin-Nin-Game, we ensure that all products that leave the warehouse are in new condition and protected sufficiently before we ship any item. As this topic is quite deep, please understand that each customer's circumstance will likely require follow up from our support team. This article aims to answer most common questions and also help with preparing your ticket so that we can help you better!\n\nI received a damaged item. What should I do?\n\nWithin 7 days of you receiving your parcel, please follow the steps written below.\n\nFirst please take a video and/ or pictures clearly displaying the extent of the damage suffered to the parcel, the item box and the item itself depending on the case.\n\nNext, open a ticket with us on FreshDesk and attach the associated media along with the Order Reference, Shipping Invoice, and Delivery Slip. Our team will then reach out to you and offer you solutions appropriate to the extent of the issue and the information provided. This process can take a few days, but we will ensure that your concerns will be addressed as soon as we can.\n\nNote: Please keep the received parcel and all contents that came with it. Including, packaging material (tape, bubble wrap, etc.), the label and the invoice. We also request that you carefully handle all items to further prevent any additional damage. In the case a return is requested, we will require that all of these items are included in your return parcel to us. If we receive an incomplete return, your order will not be eligible for compensation.\n\nHow is damage classified or defined on Nin-Nin-Game?\n\nOur team will classify your case based on the following criteria.\n\nCase A (Product Damage)\n\nOur team will work with you to understand what sort of solution is appropriate for your product damage. You will be expected to send clear photos or videos to help illustrate the extent of the damage\n\nCase B (Product Box Damage)\n\nIf the box was damaged during the delivery process, we will not authorize a return of the parcel, nor provide a refund or any form of compensation. All products classified as new, leaving the warehouse are checked to be free of damage before shipping and are carefully packed with adequate protection. Therefore, any damage that does occur to the product box during the shipment to the destination is outside of our control.\n\nExample of Product Box Damage\n\nCase C (Parcel Damage)\n\nIf your parcel arrived wet, destroyed or crushed, you will have to open a claim with the associated shipping carrier. When you first notice parcel damage on handoff, it will be essential to take a photo of the parcel in the presence of the delivery person. The more evidence you can provide, the higher the chance your claim will be approved.\n\nPlease understand that damage to the parcel or package does not automatically qualify as a reason for returning your order. Each case involving a damaged item will be evaluated individually, so please reach out to our customer service for assistance. If your return request is approved, you will be responsible for covering the cost of return shipping. We greatly appreciate your understanding in this matter.\n\n**Please note that 18+ figures, once opened, cannot be exchanged due to hygiene reasons**\n\nCase D (Missing Item)\n\nIn the case that an item in your order did not arrive as expected, please contact our Customer Support Team as soon as you can!\n\nNote: If a package is taking an abnormally long time to arrive, please also consult with your customs office or courier as certain shipping methods can take much longer to arrive than expected.\n\nReturned Parcels\n\nIn the tracking information it states that the package was returned back to the sender. What should I do?\n\nJapan Post ->\n\nIf a package was flagged and returned back to us, that means that the post office or the customs deemed it as undeliverable, unclaimed, refused or prohibited. In the case that the carrier is Japan Post (EMS/Airmail/Surface), the parcel should be sent back to our warehouse.\n\nWe will contact you for reshipping costs in the scenario that you would like your order to be reshipped. In the case of a return package, if you want to contest the return/delivery of your parcel and receive compensation for the shipping fee, we can open an investigation with the Japan Post on your behalf.\n\nHowever, we will need cooperation from your local postal carrier, either in the form of a document acknowledging the delivery process failure or a direct communication from your local postal carrier and Japan Post. Please note that if your local postal service refuses to cooperate, we will not be able to claim the shipping fee back.\n\nFedEx/DHL ->\n\nPlease understand that we can't accept Fedex or DHL shipments back to our warehouse. As the return shipping fee being excessively high, we will be forced to dispose the parcel instead. We are also unable to reroute your parcel to a different address or a country due to the exorbitant fees associated with such a service.\n\nPlease pick up your Fedex / DHL parcel in any case!"
