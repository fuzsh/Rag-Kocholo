        "text": "PROVIDENCE â€“ Even though a major Hollywood movie in theaters this week is set in Providence, don't expect to see familiar sights on the big screen.\n\nThat's because Sony's \"Harold and the Purple Crayon\" was filmed in Atlanta, instead of Rhode Island.\n\nKeen-eyed moviegoers will see a transit bus marked \"RIPTA\" with \"Pawtucket\" as its destination, but they certainly won't see the iconic Industrial Trust Building, aka the \"Superman Building,\" in the skyline.\n\nWhy didn't Harold and the Purple Crayon film in Rhode Island?\n\nSteven Feinberg, head of the state film and television office, which works to attract projects to Rhode Island, said that the movie hadn't been on his radar.\n\n\"I wasn't even aware that was a Rhode Island story,\" he said.\n\nWhat is Harold and the Purple Crayon about?\n\nThe original 1955 children's picture book \"Harold and the Purple Crayon,\" by Crockett Johnson, is set in a boy's bedroom, but never says where the boy's house is.\n\nDirected by Carlos Saldanha and starring Zachary Levi as Harold, the film includes Zooey Deschanel, Lil Rel Howery and Benjamin Bottani. It tells the story of a little boy whose purple crayon brings to life whatever he draws and of the people who want that power for themselves."
