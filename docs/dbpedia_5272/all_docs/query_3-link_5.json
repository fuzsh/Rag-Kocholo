        "text": "Create a fort using blankets, coffee tables, couches, boxes or whatever you've got in your home. Then grab a few pillows, books, toys and a flashlight to create an epic hideaway.\n\nJournaling can be a great way for kids to express their thoughts and feelings. Have them spend 10- 15 minutes a day writing or doodling. They can keep it private, or share and discuss it with you.\n\nCheck out Fold‘NFly's website for dozens of free step-by-step paper airplane tutorials. Have kids assemble a few of their favorites, then hold a contest to see whose can fly the furthest!\n\nHave kids put together a play—complete with scripts and costumes—while you work or study, and then perform it for you when you're done.\n\nA simple activity that kids can do is to gather all the broken crayons in the house, and then peel and discard the paper wrappings. Once you’re done working or studying, you can help them recycle the old crayon fragments into something new like a fresh set of muffin tin crayons or a great piece of decor.\n\nIf your kids are old enough, baking is a great (and delicious!) way to pass some time. For younger kids, simply make some treats in advance and allow them to decorate with icing and sprinkles while you work or study.\n\nIf there’s one thing kids love, it's glue. And the best thing about glue projects is that they're a great way to make use of recycled materials and scraps. Gather up anything you have on hand—tissue paper, beads, toilet paper rolls, Popsicle® sticks, miscellaneous craft supplies—and see what kind of masterpieces they can think up.\n\nAn easy way to add a little sunshine to someone's day is to paint rocks and leave them for others to find. Have your kids paint while you work or study, then set them out or leave them on your neighbors' doorsteps the next time you head out for a walk.\n\nYou don't need an Easter bunny to have an egg hunt! Have your kids hide a designated number of plastic eggs, and then time each other to see how fast they can find them. You can even put small prizes or stickers inside.\n\nWhile this may not be the quietest activity, an obstacle course rarely disappoints. And it doesn't have to mean jumping on furniture—set up stations for jumping jacks, stretches and more.\n\nStudying doesn't have to mean staying indoors. One of our favorite things to do with kids at home is to head to the backyard for a little bit of exercise and fresh air. Let the kids play while you do some short reading, respond to emails or participate in an online class discussion.\n\nIf you've got a Rubik's Cube in your house, you know that solving it is no joke. But there are actually some great tutorials to help you learn how to do just that. With a little memorization, your kids can learn to conquer the cube in no time.\n\nVideo messages are more instant than sending a letter in the mail, and it’s a great way to show someone you’re thinking of them. Have your kids make customized videos, then text or email them to your loved ones to brighten their day.\n\nWhile older children have an easier time keeping in touch with their friends, don't forget that younger children can benefit from this too. Consider texting other parents from your elementary school or play group to see if they'd like to set up a time for your younger kids to chat on the phone or FaceTime while you squeeze in some work or study time.\n\nRemember that puppy your kids begged for? Now is a great time for them to practice a little responsibility with their pet. Have them walk the dog, clean the hamster cage or feed the fish.\n\nWith many schools no longer teaching cursive, now could be the perfect time to learn. Check out these free printable worksheets to help them get started.\n\nIf you're looking for some time to focus, puzzles may just qualify as one of the quietest things to do with kids at home. Dig an old puzzle out of the closet to entertain kids of all ages while you work or study.\n\nGive your children a daily cleaning task suitable to their age level, from vacuuming the floors to dusting the knickknacks, and your house can be sparkling in no time!\n\nSensory bins are great for kids to learn and explore. Start by filling a box, storage bin or large Tupperware container with dried rice, beans or even water. Then give them some small toys or utensils to play with—measuring cups, funnels, or a toy tea set are all great options.\n\nPlaydough can provide quiet entertainment for kids of all ages. Make your own using one of these 8 recipes, or simply use the store bought stuff! No playdough tools? Everyday items from your home like kitchen utensils, kid’s scissors and rolling pins will work just fine.\n\nCheck out this tutorial on how to construct a tower using only plastic straws and marshmallows. Not a fan of straws? Try it with dry spaghetti, toothpicks or skewers. The marshmallows could also be replaced with playdough or even tape.\n\nRemember the games we all played as kids? Duck Duck Goose, Ring Around the Rosie, Hide and Seek and Simon Says are all great tech-free games that your kids can play together.\n\nPhysical exercise is one of the best activities to keep kids busy and healthy. Squeeze in a little work or study time while your children stay active with at-home workouts or kid-friendly videos like Cosmic Kids Yoga.\n\nHave kids use their phone or an old camera to create a digital photo album of all the activities and projects they complete.\n\nBalancing your tasks as a parent, student or employee may seem challenging sometimes, but there’s a lot to be grateful for. Grab a Mason jar or vase, along with some strips of paper, and ask kids to spend time writing down some of the things that they’re thankful for (be sure to add some of your own too). Once you’re done working or studying, read through them together.\n\nIf you're a current DeVry student, now can be a great time to take advantage of all of the resources we provide to help you balance school, work and life.
