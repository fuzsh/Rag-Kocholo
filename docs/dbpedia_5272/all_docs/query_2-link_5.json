        "text": "Pia and I made these ADORABLE melted crayon hearts the other day.\n\nI saw the idea while browsing through pinterest. If you didn’t already know this, I have a serious pinterest addiction. Follow me and see the depths of my addiction issues.\n\nOf course it’s all harmless fun when I go on binges filled with interior design lust, food porn and kids craft idea hoarding.\n\nThis was one of those kids crafts that I saw and frantically found the original idea on a site called messychef.com. She is awesomely creative.\n\nPia and I promptly started the project in order to make these valentines for her whole class. (Great alternative to candy in my opinion!)\n\nHere is how you do it:\n\nPreheat your oven to 230 degrees.\n\nI got a mold- these silicone molds work great and just need to be washed before they go back to being cake molds. (But my mom used to make these crayons in muffin tins for us when we were little.)\n\nI assume that anyone with kids also has a huge bin like this half full of stubby broken crayons?\n\nPeel a bunch of old crayons.\n\nDon’t be like us and spend 2 hours peeling your crayons. In the last 5 minutes of that 2 hours, we discovered that if you put the crayons in a dish of warm water, that the paper comes right off.\n\nBreak the crayons into different sized chunks.\n\nCombine the chunks into each heart mold. Be creative or deliberate about your colors.\n\nPlace the silicone mold on a sheet pan.\n\nBake the crayons at 230 degrees for 15 minutes.\n\nPull the melted crayon hearts out and let them cool. When they have completely cooled, pop them out. Repeat with the mold if you need more hearts!\n\nI glued them onto the envelope of her valentines and then we stuck them into a small cellophane bag and sealed it with a red sticker. SO CUTE!!\n\nRecipe by Heather Christo (http://heatherchristo.com)"
