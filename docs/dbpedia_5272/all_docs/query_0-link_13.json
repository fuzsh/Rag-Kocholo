Set in England in 1930, the plot revolves around a nineteen-year-old woman named Jennifer, who becomes trapped in a world ruled by young girls who have established a class hierarchy called the Red Crayon Aristocrats. It was first released in 2006 by Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan. After Sony Computer Entertainment's American and European branch did not express interest in localizing the title, it was published later that year by Atlus USA in North America and by 505 Games in Europe.\n\nDevelopment on Rule of Rose began after Punchline was asked by Sony Computer Entertainment to make a horror game. Punchline wanted to develop a \"new type of horror game\" with an emphasis on psychological horror. This decision led to the concept of childhood, specifically the \"mysterious and misunderstood\" nature of young girls. The team drew inspiration from the classic Brothers Grimm fairy tales for the narrative, and the Silent Hill series for graphics and art style. The entire score was produced by studio musicians in order to bring a human element to the game's atmosphere.\n\nRule of Rose was the subject of a moral panic in Europe prior to its publication there, based on rumors of its alleged content. These rumors ranged from erotic themes to obscene brutality. Various European authorities condemned the game and called for its banning. The game was cancelled in the United Kingdom, despite the Video Standards Council calling the complaints \"nonsense\". Rule of Rose received mixed reviews from critics, with gameplay being criticized the most. The game has been compared to Silent Hill and Haunting Ground, due to the psychological horror elements and the presence of a canine companion for the main character.[1][2]\n\nGameplay\n\n[edit]\n\nRule of Rose is a survival horror game in which the player guides Jennifer through exploring the game environments and advances the plot by accomplishing tasks while sporadically encountering enemies and bosses.[3]\n\nDescribed as \"essentially an interactive movie\" by its director Shuji Ishikawa and associate producer Yuya Takayama, the narrative of Rule of Rose centers on the traumatic childhood memories of Jennifer, \"an ordinary, vulnerable girl\"; these memories sometimes manifest in exaggerated ways.[4]\n\nCombat is almost exclusively melee-based, with a variety of improvised weapons available, such as kitchen knives and pipes. Jennifer is a timid character: her melee attacks are neither powerful nor long-ranged.[5] Evasion of enemies is often a more viable strategy instead of fighting. With the exception of a handful of bosses, all enemies in the game are impsâ€”skinny, dolllike creatures the size of small children. Different animal-headed imps appear throughout the game, alongside regular imps.[6]\n\nEvery level of the game takes place over a month. Each chapter begins with the reading of a homemade storybook related to the plot of the chapter. During each level, Jennifer is tasked with finding a specific object that will be gifted to the Aristocracy.\n\nEarly in the game, Jennifer encounters and rescues a dog named Brown.[3] Brown accompanies her throughout the game and responds to the player's commands.[7] Brown can be ordered to track items by scent, be commanded to 'stay' and be called to Jennifer's side. Brown cannot attack enemies, but will growl to distract some imps and bosses, allowing Jennifer to retreat or attack without fear of retaliation.[8] He can be injured to the point of collapse, causing him to stop distracting enemies or track items.[3]\n\nBrown's ability to locate items is an integral part of the game, and is used in every chapter to progress further.[5] The same system allows the player to find health restoratives and other items which, while not essential to complete the game, can help the player survive enemy encounters.[3] Players select an item from the inventory for Brown to locate, which is then connected to the 'find' command until changed or removed.[9] Every item selected this way can be used to find at least one type of item. When tracking items, Brown will lead the player through the game environments, scratching at doors in his way, signaling the player to open the door.[7] Most health restoratives and all tradable items are hidden and must be uncovered by Brown, though the player can choose to avoid searching for these items to progress quickly. Restorative items include snack foods, candy, and chocolate. The different types of restorative items heal varying amounts of health. Bones and other items can be used to restore Brown's health if he becomes injured. Other items such as marbles and ribbons have no immediate use, but may be traded with non-playable characters in order to obtain food, rare items, and weapons.[3]\n\nMost levels are puzzle based. The primary puzzles require the use of Brown's scent-finding ability in order to find objects that are related to one another in order to solve a larger puzzle. Others require finding markings on the wall in order to solve the chapter's puzzle. The game is largely linear and the player cannot affect the story through their actions, although they are rewarded for exploration with secret items, additional details and combat upgrades.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nOn a late night bus ride, 19-year-old Jennifer is given an unfinished storybook by a mysterious boy, but he runs away before she can return it. While following him to the dilapidated Rose Garden Orphanage, Jennifer finds a dog collar in a shed, and witnesses a few masked children beating a bloody sack. She infiltrates the abandoned orphanage, where a funeral is announced over a loudspeaker. The mysterious boy claims the funeral is for her \"dear friend\". After attending the funeral, Jennifer unearths the coffin and finds the bloody sack inside, but before she can investigate it the masked children force her into the coffin, and carry her onto an airship. Jennifer wakes up as a captive of the mysterious boy, who introduces himself as the Prince of the Red Rose. Jennifer is forcibly inducted into a club called Red Rose Aristocracy, who require monthly gifts as tithes for the Prince and Princess of the Red Rose. Failure to provide the gifts results in punishment through humiliation and eventual sacrifice to an entity called Stray Dog. The Prince also gives Jennifer a few handmade storybooks to help recover her forgotten memories, and then releases her to participate in club activities. As the newest and therefore the lowest ranking member of the Aristocracy, Jennifer frequently faces punishment for incidents caused by higher-ranking members, but manages to rescue a yellow Labrador from the other orphans, who she names Brown and takes with her. Jennifer also befriends other lower-class members, Amanda and Wendy. Jennifer's experiences aboard the airship begin to reflect the events in the storybooks she was given, and she gradually begins to recall an oath she made to someone.\n\nJennifer is suddenly taken off the airship by a strange man, Gregory Wilson, who abandons her in a rose garden. She follows him into the basement of his home, where she discovers a stuffed bear, more handmade storybooks, and letters between Wendy and a boy named Joshua, who address each other \"Princess\" and \"Prince\" respectively. Wendy rescues Jennifer from the basement after taking Gregory's gun to prevent him from committing suicide, and trades her rose-shaped brooch for the stuffed bear Jennifer found. Back on the airship, the club is in a state of emergency trying to find the stuffed bear, which has been presumed stolen. Amanda is revealed to be the thief, but she betrays and frames Jennifer as having stolen the bear in order to gain a higher rank in the club. The Aristocrats attack Jennifer in retaliation, who wakes up back at the orphanage. All the children from the airship are present in the orphanage, but they either ignore or harass her, except for Wendy. Jennifer later learns that herself and Brown are now wanted as the monthly gift, after which both Wendy and Brown go missing. Jennifer follows a bloody trail to the attic and discovers Brown's corpse in the bloody sack. The Princess of the Red Rose approaches Jennifer, revealing herself to be Wendy, and that she was responsible for ordering Brown's death. Outraged, Jennifer slaps Wendy and throws away her brooch, denouncing the Aristocrats and herself for not standing up to their bullying. Wendy departs, humiliated.[10]\n\nWithout a leader, the orphans elect Jennifer as their new Princess, but before she can decline, they see Wendy outside and leave to chase her away. Hearing their screams, Jennifer follows them and encounters Wendy, disguised as the Prince and leading Stray Dog. Wendy confesses to having Brown killed out of jealousy, and explains that she manipulated Gregory into becoming Stray Dog by disguising herself as his son, Joshua, and used him to massacre the Aristocrats out of revenge. Wendy gives Jennifer the gun she had stolen earlier in order to stop Stray Dog, and is then killed by Gregory. Recognizing Jennifer as Joshua, Gregory instead asks for the gun and shoots himself out of grief.[11]\n\nJennifer wakes up as her child self and realizes that all the events that have occurred were in fact her distorted memories of her childhood. Before meeting Wendy, Jennifer was kidnapped from an airship wreck by Gregory and made to live as a boy in order to replace his deceased son, the real Joshua. Wendy discovered Jennifer living under the identity of Joshua. Wendy rescued and brought Jennifer to the orphanage for companionship and together they formed the Red Crayon Aristocrats as a means of escapism, with Jennifer, as 'Joshua', being the Prince and Wendy being the Princess. They made a loyalty oath to each other and exchanged Jennifer's bear for Wendy's brooch. Soon after, Jennifer adopted a puppy she named Brown and started to neglect club duties in order to care for him. Having become jealous of Jennifer's love for Brown, Wendy demoted her from the position of Prince, and replaced her with the stuffed bear Joshua. Wendy also ordered the other orphans to torment Jennifer as punishment. Wendy ultimately ordered Brown's death to try and force Jennifer's submission. Within her memories, Jennifer locates Brown inside the shed, gives him the collar bearing his name, and inscribes her oath to Wendy on a chalkboard. Vowing to protect her memories of everyone, she leaves the shed and closes the door behind her.[12]\n\nDevelopment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company Punchline, which had previously developed the video game Chulip, developed Rule of Rose for the PlayStation 2.[2] A group of twenty-five developers, Punchline began the project after being asked by Sony Computer Entertainment to develop a horror video game; not wanting to create a game similar to the survival-horror series Resident Evil, Punchline decided on the goal of developing a \"new type of horror game, one which wasn't the usual zombie, ghost and slasher type,\" with an emphasis on psychological horror rather than \"surprise- and shock-based horror.\"[2] A proposed early draft by Yoshiro Kimura was a dark fantasy \"boy's story\" that centered on a boy abducted by \"a big man\" and his attempts to escape, while encountering the ghosts of previous victims.[14] Keywords included \"Kidnapping, imprisonment, children, bullying, dwarfs, airship, escape.\"[14] This concept was turned down by the publisher on the basis of being \"too dangerous a topic,\" and Kimura turned to the idea of examining the \"fear between girls.\"[14]\n\nThis decision led to the concept of \"a game surrounding childhood and children,\" but from both viewpoints to show how children and adults can find the other one terrifying, with a primary focus on the adult's perspective.[2] Though the game has garnered comparisons with William Golding's 1954 allegorical novel Lord of the Flies,[15][16] the developers did not draw inspiration from it,[2] instead focusing on the \"mysterious and misunderstood\" nature of girls.[13] The team visited Hyde Park for the accuracy of details such as the garden in the opening scene, and sought assistance from the British government and archives to gather information about the R101 airship that influenced the setting of the story. They ensured accurate architectural details due to Ishikawa's expertise.[4] The story formed through trial and error as the developers figured out how to create a sense of fear, ultimately adding the children's secret society, the Red Crayon Aristocrats.[13] They also included Brown as a way to balance Jennifer's \"helpless and unhappy\" personality and make the game more enjoyable.[13] Because of budget and time problems, the combat system was left a little rough.[17]\n\nRule of Rose's graphics are heavily stylized, incorporating a series of visual filters similar to those used in the Silent Hill series.[6] The developers researched the behavior of children, monitoring a group of European and American children, and photographed references for \"the game's textures and models\"; for the motion capture, the team had Japanese children act.[2] At the request of the developers, the group of children also expressed through drawings or written words what caused them to be happy or afraid.[2] The company Shirogumi worked on the computer-generated imagery present in Rule of Rose's cutscenes.[18] The musical score was composed by Yutaka Minobe, who also co-composed the music of Skies of Arcadia and some tracks from the Panzer Dragoon Orta soundtrack. The entire score was produced by studio musicians, including the Hiroshi Murayama Trio, and vocals by Kaori Kondo. According to the game's developers, the music was intended to bring a human element to the atmosphere in the game.[19] A 6-track promotional soundtrack CD was produced by Atlus, which was issued to customers from certain retailers when Rule of Rose was pre-ordered.[20]\n\nPunchline included several themes in Rule of Rose,[19] with the primary one being \"intimate relationships between all people\".[2] A major theme in the game is the difference between a child's and an adult's way of thinking, and how children might treat adults if they were given power over them. Players are helpless to prevent their adult player character from being bullied by the children.[19] Another theme is how attachment \"to one thing can bring out the worst in people.\"[17]\n\nControversy\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to its publication, Rule of Rose was the subject of a moral panic in Europe.[21] At E3 2006 Atlus announced that it would be releasing Rule of Rose in the United States,[22] following Sony's decision to pass on an American release, as the game \"wasnâ€™t really in sync with their corporate image\" and the company had wanted the game to \"be a bit tamer, if it were to have the Sony name in the U.S.\"[2] The developers disagreed with this, saying that \"the theme is supposed to be one of intimate familiarity\" and that they had intended to portray how children behave \"without the filter of guilt or sin.\"[2] Rumors of violence towards children in the game tied into a larger discussion of morality and violence in video games appeared in the Italian magazine Panorama in November 2006, and were quickly picked up by the British media, which alleged that the game had scenes of \"children buried alive underground, in-game sadomasochism, and underage eroticism.\"[21] These allegations were untrue.[21] At the time, Rule of Rose had already been rated by various video game advisory boards as suitable for an older teenage audience: in Japan, it was rated 15+; in the majority of Europe, 16+; and in North America, 17+.[21]\n\nEuropean Union justice minister Franco Frattini attacked the game as containing \"obscene cruelty and brutality.\" He also called for changes to the PEGI rating system in place across Europe and for government officials to engage in discussions with industry representatives.[23] Frattini received a letter from Viviane Reding, commissioner for the information society and media, who criticized his actions: \"It is...very unfortunate that my services were not pre-consulted before your letter to the Ministers of Interior was sent out,\" reminding him of the commission-backed self-regulating ratings system called PEGI that has operated across the European Union since 2003. The PEGI system of classification, according to Reding's letter, offers \"informed adult choice\" without censoring content: \"This is in line with the Commission's view that measures taken to protect minors and human dignity must be carefully balanced with the fundamental right to freedom of expression as laid down in the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\"[24] On March 7, 2007, a group of MEPs presented a motion for a European Parliament resolution on a ban on the sale and distribution of the game in Europe, along with the creation of a \"European Observatory on childhood and minors to be set up to preventively monitor video game content and define a single code of conduct for the sale and distribution of childrenâ€™s video games.\"[25] It was also proposed that the game be prohibited from being sold in France as part of an amendment presented by DÃ©putÃ© Bernard Depierre in the French Parliament,[26] while the Deputy Minister of National Education in Poland, MirosÅ‚aw Orzechowski, sought to prevent the game from being disseminated by submitting a report to the district prosecutor's office in ÅšrÃ³dmieÅ›cie, Warsaw, although he did not specify which article of the Polish Penal Code was allegedly being violated.[27] At this time, the game had not yet been released in Europe; the public officials suggesting that Rule of Rose be banned had not actually played the game, but had only read about its alleged content or watched the trailer.[21]\n\n505 Games' Australian distributor, Red-Ant, cancelled the game's Australian and New Zealand release,[28] and 505 Games later cancelled the United Kingdom release as a result of complaints by Frattini and other EU officials, and \"largely misleading\"[29] commentary from the British press, although review copies had already shipped to video game journalists.[30] It was released in the rest of Europe. The Video Standards Council, the British body which had granted the title its 16+ PEGI rating, defended their decision. In response to the press and Frattini's comments, the VSC's Secretary-General, Laurie Hall, stated: \"I have no idea where the suggestion of in-game sadomasochism has come from, nor children being buried underground. These are things that have been completely made up. [...] We're not worried about our integrity being called into question, because Mr Frattini's quotes are nonsense.\"[23] The Council further noted that \"there isn't any underage eroticism. And the most violent scene does indeed see one of the young girls scare Jennifer with a rat on a stick. But the rat's actually quite placid towards her and even licks her face.\"[23]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe game received mixed reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.[31] The reviewer for video game magazine Play wrote: \"I think everyone should experience this game, especially horror fans, but in order to do so, you're going to have to suffer through times of sheer agonyâ€”just like poor, unlucky Jennifer.\"[44] According to Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine, the game \"[b]lends the stuff of nightmares with stylish sound and graphics. Sadly, the developer should have spent longer on the gameplay.\"[45] Edge found neither plot nor gameplay appealing: \"Itâ€™s just a murky brew of meaningless, exploitative dysfunction filling an empty game, and it leaves a bitter taste.\"[32]\n\nIt is generally agreed that the title has an interesting plot, with The A.V. Club observing that \"aside from a few deep curtsies and an unlockable Gothic Lolita costume, the characters are more sinister than sexualised\".[43] However, the gameplay is widely lambasted as clumsy, archaic,[46] and unrewarding.[7][9] The press was generally divided upon how much the gameplay detracts from one's ability to enjoy the story itself. GamesRadar described Jennifer as \"a cringing, passive non-entity\" and stated: \"There's no denying that Rule of Rose is extremely pretty, atmospheric and disturbing.... but as an adventure game, Rule of Rose just sort of wilts.\"[47] Acegamez, on the other hand, not only admired the game's plot but also found the gameplay appealing if slow, \"a wonderful psychological thriller that will draw you in with its bizarrely compelling narrative, atmospheric presentation and thoughtful story-based gameplay\".[8]\n\nIn a retrospective article on survival horror games, GamePro's Michael Cherdchupan listed Rule of Rose as one of the classics of the genre, writing that the game was a work of art that lingered long after playing through; he praised it for its delicate handling of its subject matter and Jennifer's journey as she processes her trauma.[48] IGN listed Rule of Rose as one of the worst horror games created after 2000. While enjoying the \"refreshingly adult take on sexual awakening and repressed memories that's consistently unsettling without ever resorting to cheap shock tactics,\" it criticized the game's \"totally broken\" combat and \"thoroughly excruciating\" backtracking, controls, and camera angles.[49]\n\nBecause of the limited number of copies published, Rule of Rose has garnered a reputation as one of the more expensive video games to buy second-hand.[50]\n\nFuture\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2021, Tokyo indie game developer Onion Games expressed interest in remastering Rule of Rose. Although they \"can't guarantee that any of these initiatives will have more than a 1% chance of happening\", they would like to give it a try after remastering a previous title for the Nintendo Switch called Moon.[51]\n\nThe Onion Games title Black Bird, although the gameplay is completely different, shares common features of both theme and iconography with Rule of Rose and includes several specific references to it.\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
