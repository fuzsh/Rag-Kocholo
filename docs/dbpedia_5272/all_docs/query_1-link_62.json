        "text": "One of the best ways to achieve your inbound marketing goals is to use inbound links.\n\nHowever, they’re not easy to come by; you need strategy and diligence to pull this off.\n\nWhether you’re just starting your inbound link building or you’re tired from the many emails you’ve sent out and responses aren’t forthcoming, broken link building offers another way out.\n\nBroken link building is a tactic that’s used to get backlinks to your recreated content where a broken or dead link exists in a particular website or blog you’ve identified.\n\nThe practice helps you find the dead link, recreate the content, and then ask anyone who links to that broken or dead resource to link back to your recreated content instead.\n\nThis strategy works because no one wants the poor user experience that broken links come with. Consequently, replacing links to 404 pages and building backlinks in the process through working links to the target blog or site is a much better alternative.\n\nWhy Broken Link Building Works\n\nBroken link building, also known as dead link building, is a better way of adding value to another site or blog and your own as it offers something in return.\n\nMost outreach emails are known to be requests for shares or links but there’s no value added to the site on which the link is placed.\n\nWhen you use broken link building, you’re ideally flipping the script such that you offer help before asking for something in return.\n\nSpecifically, broken link building means you’ve discovered a host of broken links on a blog or site, and then reach out to the site owner to offer your recreated content in exchange for a backlink.\n\nHow to Build High-Quality Backlinks Using Broken Link Building\n\nIn order to build quality backlinks to your site using broken link building, there are several steps you need to take including:\n\nIdentifying the site or blog from which you want to get the backlink\n\nFinding external links that point to broken pages or 404 errors using a tool or software\n\nCreating a resource or recreating content that will replace the broken link on the other blog or site\n\nReaching out to the owner of the other blog or site and letting them know about the broken link\n\nMentioning how you have the perfect content/resource that will replace the broken link\n\nWhile all these steps (especially the first three) look simple to do, there’s more work you’d need to do when reaching out to the site’s owner and mentioning your own resource and how it can add value.\n\nWhen sending a broken link outreach email, there are two major things you need to give:\n\nA reason why the other site or blog should link to you, which can be user experience impacted by links to 404 pages, which in turn hurts your SEO.\n\nA value add (the resource or content) that will replace the broken link instead of them looking for it on their own.\n\nYou could publish your own guide though, but to get the backlink, it’s easier to reach out to the site or blog owner and suggest that they may want to change it to one that works, which is your own resource.\n\nHowever, not all broken link building outreach emails get a response or action even if the owner reads your email.\n\nSome may be too busy to reply back or they may just not think it’s necessary for them, so it’s important to note that sending such outreach emails won’t work every time.\n\nIn fact, broken link building is more like selling a product or service.\n\nIt’s a numbers game; the more people you contact, the more backlinks you’ll get in return.\n\nFortunately, you can also try a different hack by checking which other links point to the broken resource and reaching out to those link prospects with a similar suggestion.\n\nYou can always let them know that your resource can replace their broken link and you’re sure of landing a few links.\n\nBut how do you write a good broken link building outreach email? We share some broken link email outreach templates you can use today.\n\nBroken Link Email Outreach Templates\n\nYou can perform broken link building outreach by using your own email outreach templates, or using other templates and tweaking them to your brand.\n\nWhen using your own templates for broken link email outreach, you’ll have to start from the ground up.\n\nHowever, it’s important to note that sending cold outreach emails using a template doesn’t mean sending spam messages to multiple individuals at a go.\n\nTemplates help you scale email outreach, but you need to personalize them to the recipient.\n\nTo do this, you can look for inspiration from other people’s templates without sending the exact same one they have written.\n\nGet a template and make it your own by adding your personality and humor to it, keeping it short, and ensuring the subject line is punchy and appealing to the recipient.\n\nIf you can, do a split test to check which email has higher chances of being opened than the other so you’ll have two different versions.\n\nBelow are some broken link email outreach templates you can use today.\n\nTemplate 1\n\nSubject: Re: Blog post title\n\nHey (name of site owner or blogger),\n\nI was looking for a few resources on (topic/keyword) and I came across your very instructive guide: (title of the post).\n\nI noticed that one of the resources you mentioned on (topic/keyword) no longer exists.

However, you still have some work to do in terms of reaching out and building those links through email outreach.\n\nThankfully, broken link building isn’t too difficult to do. All you need is to find the contact details of the blog or site you want to reach out to, and then send them an email informing them about the broken link on their blog/site while suggesting your own link or recreated content as a better replacement or alternative.\n\nWhile all this looks simple, you still have to be careful how to word or organize your outreach email as you conduct broken link outreach. Here are some useful tips to help you get started.\n\nIdentify and reach out to the right person\n\nNot everyone whose contact you find on the blog or site you want to get a backlink from is the right person to reach out to.\n\nMost people make the mistake of uploading the prospects’ list to a tool, let the tool scrape email addresses for all the blogs or sites, and then wait for the results.\n\nThis process leads to failed broken link building and email outreach because you may not reach the right person.\n\nFor instance, you may get two email addresses for a blog or site, but it’s not sensible to reach out to either of them about dead links on their site.\n\nIt’s probably more sensible to reach out to the site owner or CEO, if you can find their email, though it’s not always advisable to reach out to the company’s founder.\n\nIf you really must, it should be because they’re either individual bloggers or they actively manage the blog themselves.\n\nIdentify who is responsible for the blog or site as that would be the person who would most likely be ready to listen or care about any broken/dead links you find on their blog or site.\n\nKeep it punchy, not pushy\n\nIdeally, the broken link email outreach should address the recipient by their name, mention the dead link and its position in the page or post, suggest an alternative/replacement, and explain why it’s suitable as a replacement to their own page/post.\n\nAll the broken link email outreach templates we’ve mentioned above have this format as it’s sure to deliver better conversion rates.\n\nHowever, as with any other template, you need to be careful not to use them exactly as they are because the results may not be similar in all cases, especially where more people use the templates.\n\nTry to add your own personality and flair while customizing the message with other things you may find on the web.\n\nThis keeps the message punchy and not pushy because you’re telling the person to replace the broken link with another link or replace it because there’s a better link that their readers or website visitors will like more.\n\nSend follow-up emails\n\nYour broken link outreach emails may not always get responses.\n\nWhen this happens, it’s best to send one or two follow-ups that remind the recipient about your previous message without being pushy.\n\nFollow-ups are effective and often responsible for more links than the original outreach email, but make sure you keep it to at most two times otherwise your message will be reported as spam or blacklisted altogether.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nPointing out dead or broken links in outreach emails may be great, especially because you’re adding some value.\n\nHowever, you’ll need to take your outreach to the next level by adding a replacement resource that would ensure both you and the other blog/site owner benefit.\n\nYou get the backlink, they get the valuable resource.\n\nThe process may be time-consuming but you can streamline it and make it easier to do.\n\nBe sure to give a great replacement resource link for the dead link on the other blog/site if you want to dramatically increase your success rate."
