        "text": "Earth Day—celebrated every year on April 22—is a special holiday, as it allows us to honor our home planet and reminds us how connected we indeed are, despite our differences. It’s never too early to get your students thinking about the steps they can take—however big or small—to improve our current conditions on Earth. You never know if you have a budding environmentalist in your class who could make significant environmental changes in the future. Incorporate the Earth Day activities for elementary students below in your classroom.\n\nEarth Day Activities for Elementary School Students\n\n1. Play a Recycling Game, Grades K–5\n\nMotivate your students to recycle—with this Earth Day game for elementary students! Recycling is a simple way for kids to make an impact. Teaching this practice sooner rather than later will hopefully ensure that young children continue the habit as they get older. This activity will have students guess whether items, such as a tin can, envelope, or an apple, are recyclable. If this sounds like tons of fun, download the activity below! After finishing the game, have students think about other everyday items (besides those used in the game) they can recycle or reuse.\n\n4. Poster Project, Grades K–5\n\nPoster Earth Day projects for elementary students allow kids to learn about more pressing environmental issues. You can have your students brainstorm the topics that matter to them the most, such as cleaning up the neighborhood, saving the bees or rainforests, water pollution, or global warming. Then, have your students create posters using recyclable products or items found outdoors to spread awareness of environmental issues impacting humanity. They have plenty of objects and materials to choose from, such as pebbles, leaves, twigs, acorns, seeds, feathers, shells, cardboard, old mail and magazines, and bottle caps.\n\nAfter developing their design ideas, help students pick slogans to add to their posters. Here are some examples: Save Our Home, Plant a Tree, Earth Day is Every Day, and Keep Earth Clean.\n\n5. Trek through Nature, Grades K–5\n\nThere are plenty of benefits to spending time in nature, such as escaping city noises, getting fresh air and natural sunlight, and boosting one’s self-esteem and mood. Nature walks can also develop observational skills. In this Earth Day activity for students, your class will go on a nature walk, focus on one particular item (for example, a flower, tree, insect, etc.), and take part in a discussion based on their observations.\n\n6. Plant a Tree, Grades K–5\n\nPlanting a tree is a common Earth Day activity. Trees provide many environmental benefits, such as cleaning the air, providing oxygen, and addressing climate change. Anyone of any age can participate in a volunteer tree planting event in April; some organizations, such as One Tree Planted, provide a list of local volunteer opportunities. Alternatively, you can donate as little as $1 to The Canopy Project to help plant trees worldwide. Consider using this activity for Arbor Day, celebrated every year on the last Friday in April.\n\n7. Upcycle Crayons, Grades 2–5\n\nCraving an Earth Day art project? This activity teaches kids about upcycling by having them melt their used crayons into new crayons. Adult supervision is a must! This project is ideal for kids who have quite a few broken crayons lying around.\n\nMelted Crayons Project\n\nWhat You Need:\n\nUsed crayons\n\nCookie-cutter shapes or silicone molds (round, square, star, butterfly, flower, pineapple, etc.)\n\nMuffin tin or clean aluminum can (such as a soft drink can) with the top cut off\n\nWarming tray or electric fry pan\n\nWhat to Do:\n\nPeel the wrapper off the crayons and break them into smaller pieces. (Tip: For a faster melt, use crayon shavings. To shred crayons, use a pencil sharpener or a grater with adult supervision.)\n\nAdd the broken crayons to a muffin tin or aluminum can.\n\nPlace the muffin tin or the aluminum can on a warming tray or into a water-filled electric fry pan set for low heat. Note: Crayons can melt at different rates. If needed, use a small wooden spoon or stirring stick to stir the crayons.\n\nAfter the crayons have melted, gently pour the crayon wax into the cookie-cutter shapes.\n\nLeave cookie-cutter shapes undisturbed. Once the wax has cooled and hardened, pop off the cookie cutters, and voilà. New crayons for coloring!\n\nFor more crayon-related arts and crafts projects, check out these activities.\n\n8. Earth Day Expressions, Grades K–5\n\nWant to get your students excited about saving our planet? Let them express themselves by writing and performing an Earth Day song or rap. For example, these two teachers filmed a rap video that educates students about the holiday’s importance. Challenge your kids to write educational lyrics that speak to issues such as climate change, pollution, deforestation, or water scarcity. If your students are poets at heart, let them compose a poem instead. The following poems are excellent examples:\n\n“Earth Day” by Jane Yolen\n\n“Remember” by Joy Harjo\n\n“Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Glacier (after Wallace Stevens)” by Craig Santos Perez\n\nAfterward, give students a chance to perform or explain the meaning of their writing.\n\n9. Read, Watch, Discuss, Grades Pre-K–5\n\nGet your students reading about the wonders of our environment and the actions scientists and others have taken to protect our home. Then, have a class discussion with your students about the materials they read; the following list includes books for Pre-K­­–5.\n\nReading List:\n\nMy Little Garden by Katrin Wiehle (Grade Pre-K)\n\nListen to the Desert/Oye al Desierto by Francisco Mora and Pat Mora (Grades Pre-K–1)\n\nBetween Earth & Sky: Legends of Native American Sacred Places by Joseph Bruchac and Thomas Locker (Grades Pre-K–2)\n\nWangari’s Trees of Peace: A True Story from Africa by Jeanette Winter (Grades Pre-K–3)\n\nThe Earth and I by Frank Asch (Grades Pre-K–3)\n\nBradford Street Buddies: Springtime Blossoms by Jerdine Nolen and Michelle Henninger (Grades 1–4)\n\nJust Grace Goes Green by Charise Mericle Harper (Grades 1–4)\n\nThe Polar Bear Scientists by Peter Lourie and Susan Ramer (Grade 5)\n\nAlternatively, you can watch two episodes from the web series Carmen Sandiego: Fearless Kids Around the World with your students, featuring kids on a mission to help their communities. “Protecting the Rain Forest” spotlights Pablo Cavanzo, a teenager who took action to protect the Amazon in his home country of Colombia. And “Saving the Wildlife in Africa” covers how Richard Turere, who lives in a farming community in Kenya, came up with an idea to keep farmers from killing lions.\n\nAfter watching, have your students share their thoughts. Ask them: what actions are these kids taking to protect the rainforest or wildlife in their home countries? Think of other questions to ask your students to get them pondering about the steps they could take to protect the environment in their community and worldwide.\n\nShare Your Earth Day Ideas for Schools\n\nHow do you honor Earth Day in your classroom and get your students thinking about the various ways they can do good for their communities and the environment? Do you clean up a local park or play Earth Day games for elementary students? Share your Earth Day ideas for schools via email at shaped@hmhco.com or reach out on Twitter (@HMHCo) or Facebook.\n\n***\n\nFor more ways to celebrate Earth Day with your students, check out these classroom activities.\n\nLooking for hands-on science lessons and activities for Grades K–5?
