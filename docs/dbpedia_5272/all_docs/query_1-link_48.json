The expense limitation is imposed upon the county, city, or village and does not apply to expenses incurred by a lottery operator in the conduct of a lottery on behalf of a county, city, or village. Lottery expenses shall include:\n\n602.01A All costs incurred by the county, city, or village associated with the purchasing, leasing, printing, or manufacturing of any items to be used or distributed in the lottery, such as tickets or chances to be sold or the printing of signs or flyers promoting the lottery or any lottery equipment or supplies;\n\n602.01A(1) Expenses incurred by the county, city, or village in the lease or purchase of lottery equipment, lottery supplies, and other equipment, supplies and items used in the conduct of the lottery.\n\n602.01A(1)(a) The purchase price of lottery equipment and other capital equipment expenditures related to the conduct of the lottery by a county, city, or village shall be amortized over the useful life of the equipment as determined in accordance with regulations of the United States Internal Revenue Service for depreciation purposes.

Rev. Stat. § 13-801, et al.;\n\n602.02A(1)(b) Government maintenance, monitoring, and examination of lottery records including, but not limited to, expenses for storing lottery records and videotapes, expenses incurred in recording and compiling lottery information, expenses incurred in the audit and examination of lottery records; and\n\n602.02A(1)(c) Enforcement, regulatory, administrative, investigative, and litigation functions undertaken by government including, but not limited to, expenses for background investigations or criminal history checks on sales outlet location license applicants and lottery worker license applicants, and fees incurred in prosecuting or defending legal actions related to the lottery.\n\n602.02A(2) Audit and legal expenses shall not include any expenses related to the actual conduct of the game. These include, but are not limited to, staffing, advertising, purchase, lease, or rental of lottery equipment, purchase, lease, or rental of lottery supplies, and printing costs.\n\n602.02A(3) For the purpose of determining compliance with the limitation on audit and legal expenses when a joint lottery is conducted pursuant to an interlocal cooperation agreement, gross proceeds shall mean the combined gross proceeds of the joint lottery.\n\n602.02A(3)(a) Example, communities A, B, and C enter into an interlocal cooperation agreement and generate annual gross proceeds of $300,000.00, $400,000.00, and $1,000,000.00, respectively. The combined gross proceeds of the joint lottery are $1,700,000.00. One percent of the combined gross proceeds, $17,000.00, is greater than $5,000.00. Audit and legal expenses incurred by the joint lottery will be applied against the 14 percent expense limitation only to the extent such expenses exceed $17,000.00.\n\n602.03 The term expenses does not include prizes awarded to participants or the county, city or village lottery tax remitted to the Department.\n\n602.04 Where an expense incurred by a county, city, or village can be partially attributed to the conduct of a lottery, that portion of the expense attributable to the lottery shall be included within the 14 percent limitation regardless of the funding source used to pay the expense. For example, a bookkeeper who works on lottery activities as well as other county, city, or village matters, would have that portion of his or her salary representing the time the bookkeeper spent on lottery activities attributed to audit and legal expenses.\n\nExample:\n\nBookkeeper’s salary - $15,000 per year\n\nTime spent on lottery activity - 50 percent\n\n$15,000.00 x .50 = $7,500.00\n\nAmount allocated to lottery expenses: $7,500.00\n\n602.05 A county, city, or village initially establishing a lottery may finance start-up costs relating to the operation of the lottery with money from the general fund of the county, city, or village during the first year of operation. General fund money used to finance such start-up costs must be repaid from funds received from the lottery. With the exception of license fees paid to the Department and audit and legal expenses relating directly to the conduct of the lottery, such start-up costs must be accounted for in the 14 percent limitation on expenses.\n\n602.06 Compliance with the 14 percent expense limitation shall be based on the lottery expenses incurred by a county, city, or village during an annual period corresponding to the fiscal year of the county, city, or village. If the lottery has not been operational for the entire fiscal year, the lottery expenses shall be annualized to determine compliance with the expense limitation.\n\n602.06A A county, city, or village may not offset any lottery expenses incurred in a fiscal year which exceed the 14 percent expense limitation against lottery expenses incurred in any prior fiscal year where such expenses were less than 14 percent.\n\n602.06B A county, city, or village may not offset any lottery expenses incurred in a fiscal year which exceed the 14 percent expense limitation against future lottery expenses.\n\n(Sections 9-605, 9-619, and 9-629, R.R.S. 1997. Section 9-620, R.S.Supp., 2004. November 13, 2005.)\n\nREG-35-603 County and City Lottery Taxes\n\n603.01 Counties, cities, or villages conducting a lottery are required to report the gross proceeds of each lottery on a form approved and provided by the Department and remit to the Department, with the report, a tax of 2 percent of the gross proceeds of each such lottery within 30 days of the end of each calendar quarter.\n\n603.02 The tax return signed by a governing official or his or her authorized representative and accompanied by remittance will be considered timely filed if actually received by the Department or mailed, postage prepaid, on or before the 30th day of the month following the close of the quarter.

November 13, 2005.)\n\nREG-35-605 Lottery Operators\n\n605.01 Any person that agrees to be responsible for conducting a lottery on behalf of a county, city, or village must apply for and obtain a lottery operator license from the Department prior to conducting any lottery. A separate lottery operator license is required for each county, city, or village on whose behalf a lottery will be conducted. A nonprofit organization or nonprofit corporation is not eligible to obtain a lottery operator license.\n\n605.01A If a lottery is conducted jointly with one or more other counties, cities, or villages pursuant to the Interlocal Cooperation Act, Neb. Rev. Stat. § 13-801, et seq., a separate lottery operator license is required for each county, city, or village included in the lottery activity.\n\n605.02 For the purpose of this regulation, when a lottery operator utilizes individual locations within the county, city, or village as satellite or sales outlet locations where keno is played, these locations are not considered lottery operators. If a county, city, or village utilizes individual locations within the county, city, or village as outlets where lottery tickets are sold and retains complete operational control of the lottery activity, these locations are not considered lottery operators.\n\n605.02A If a lottery operator leases a portion of a business location to operate keno as a main location, a satellite location, or an independent location, the business location must obtain a sales outlet location license. Notwithstanding the provisions of this regulation, any individual, sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation, nonprofit organization, or nonprofit corporation which leases space to a lottery operator to allow a lottery to be conducted at their location on behalf of a county, city, or village whose only business involvement at the location is a landlord and tenant relationship with the lottery operator is not required to apply for and obtain a sales outlet location license from the Department.\n\n605.03 Unless the contract between a county, city, or village and the lottery operator specifies otherwise, a lottery operator has overall responsibility for the daily operation of the lottery including, but not limited to, responsibility and liability for all operational aspects of the lottery which may include daily gaming operations; purchase, repair, replacement, and maintenance of lottery equipment; purchase and maintenance of lottery supplies; compensation, staffing, and training of all employees and agents; processing and handling of lottery gross proceeds; preparation of all reports required of a county, city, or village, or a lottery operator by the Department or any governmental entity or agency; advertising; development of official rules and procedures for play and collection of prizes and progressive game prizes; oversight of the lottery operation; and all other record keeping.

An Affidavit by Spouse for Waiver of Fingerprinting and/or Personal History Record and Background Disclosure Form must be completed, notarized, and submitted for each such individual.\n\n605.05A(2) The fingerprinting requirement for an applicant may be waived if the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission has received fingerprint reports on the applicant within the past two years of the filing date of the Schedule I or if the license issued by the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission has been continuously maintained since documented fingerprints were filed to obtain such license.\n\n605.05A(3) The fingerprinting requirement shall be waived for any debt holder of the applicant which is a financial institution organized or chartered under the laws of Nebraska, any other state, or the United States relating to banks, savings institutions, trust companies, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and installment loan licensees, or similar associations organized under the laws of this state which are subject to supervision by the Department of Banking and Finance.\n\n605.05B In addition to filing the Personal History Record and Background Disclosure Form and fingerprint cards, each applicant may be subject to a background investigation, an inspection of the applicant’s facilities, or both. The applicant may be required to pay the actual costs incurred by the Department, in advance under appropriate circumstances, in conducting the investigation or inspection. If payment in advance is not requested, the Department will inform the applicant of the maximum amount the Department anticipates spending and the Department will not seek more than that amount from the applicant without first seeking the applicant’s permission to continue the investigation. If payment in advance is requested and the applicant does comply, the Department will refund the amount the applicant’s advance exceeds the actual costs or will collect any underpayment for costs not covered by the advance after completion of the investigation or inspection. If payment in advance is requested and the applicant does not wish to comply for whatever reason, it may withdraw its application and its license fee will be refunded.\n\n605.05B(1) The background investigation shall be waived for any debt holder of the applicant which is a financial institution organized or chartered under the laws of Nebraska, any other state, or the United States relating to banks, savings institutions, trust companies, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and installment loan licensees, or similar associations organized under the laws of this state which are subject to supervision by the Department of Banking and Finance.\n\n605.05C Two sets of fingerprints on cards supplied by the Department and the required processing fees must be submitted to the Nebraska State Patrol.\n\n605.06 The Department must be informed within 30 days after the licensee learns of any inaccuracies or makes any changes in the information supplied by the licensee in its most recent filing with the Department.
