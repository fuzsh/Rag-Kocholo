        "text": "This article is about Mickey's rival. For other uses, see Mortimer Mouse (Minnie's Uncle) and Mortimer Mouse (song).\n\nMortimer Mouse is an anthropomorphic mouse and Mickey Mouse's longtime rival. Portrayed as an arrogant, lecherous, yet charismatic shyster, Mortimer made his animated debut in the 1936 short Mickey's Rival, in which he vied for Minnie Mouse's affections against a jealous Mickey. A precursor to the character known as Mr. Slicker appeared six years prior in the Floyd Gottfredson comic Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers.\n\nWith a tall, slim physique and overbearing personality, Mortimer is the polar opposite of the stout and earnest Mickey. Mortimer's whiskers, elongated snout, and prominent front teeth made him out to be more of a rat than a mouse, contrast to his name. Though Mickey's Rival was his only appearance in the theatrical shorts, Mortimer was reinvigorated in the early 2000s with prominent roles in Mickey Mouse Works and House of Mouse, in which he coined his catchphrase, \"Ha-cha-cha!\".\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWho is Mortimer Mouse's main rival?\n\nMortimer Mouse's main rival is none other than the iconic Mickey Mouse! These two have been at odds for a long time, often competing for the affections of Minnie Mouse. Mortimer, with his charismatic yet lecherous personality, often tries to outwit Mickey but usually ends up on the losing end. From volleyball matches to romantic pursuits, their rivalry is a classic part of their animated series.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is the personality of Mortimer Mouse?\n\nMortimer Mouse is quite the character! Known as Minnie's ex-boyfriend, he is often portrayed as the polar opposite of Mickey Mouse. Mortimer is known for his arrogant and rude personality, which often lands him in hot water. Despite his cocky attitude, he is sometimes shown as a friend to Mickey, although his shortsightedness often causes unintentional trouble. His arrogance tends to get the better of him, especially when he's around Mickey and his friends. But hey, every story needs a character to stir things up, right?\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhen did Mortimer Mouse make his animated debut?\n\nMortimer Mouse, the tall, slim rival of Mickey Mouse, made his animated debut in 1936. He was introduced as an old friend of Minnie Mouse and quickly became a recurring antagonist for Mickey in the world of Disney cartoons.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat role did Mortimer Mouse play in the short 'Mickey's Rival'?\n\nIn the short 'Mickey's Rival', Mortimer Mouse played the role of an antagonist, taking advantage of Mickey's inability to say 'no'. Mortimer asked Mickey if he could borrow Minnie romantically, and though Mickey wasn't able to refuse, Minnie put a stop to Mortimer's plans by stomping on his foot. This short established Mortimer as a recurring rival to Mickey, often causing trouble with his arrogance.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWho was the precursor to Mortimer Mouse?\n\nThe precursor to Mortimer Mouse was a character named Mr. Slicker, who appeared six years earlier in the Floyd Gottfredson comic 'Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers'. Mr. Slicker shared Mortimer's tall, slim physique and overbearing personality. Interestingly, Walt Disney originally intended to name his new mouse character 'Mortimer', but his wife, Lillian, suggested the less pompous 'Mickey' instead. The name 'Mortimer' was later used for the character we now know as Mickey's nemesis.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nBackground\n\nPersonality\n\nMortimer is said to be Minnie's ex-boyfriend. He is very arrogant and rude, the total opposite of his rival. While he claims he loves Minnie very much (even after she broke up with him due to her strong relationship with Mickey), he is shown to be incredibly selfish as seen in the cartoon Mickey's Rival, where he leaves Minnie to be attacked by a bull that he provoked. Not only that, he attempts to flirt with any female character on screen, which might also indicate the reason the relationship between him and Minnie was abolished. Also, Mortimer can be rather sexist as seen in \"Mickey's Rival Returns\" where he feels that Minnie is only a prize to be won.\n\nAside from his cocky and sexist attitude, Mortimer proves to be, time and time again, rather intelligent and crafty. On many occasions, he's managed to manipulate Mickey into a scheme that'd end in the downfall of his relationship with Minnie. For instance, in \"Big House Mickey\", Mortimer managed to fool the town's government into arresting Mickey. In the House of Mouse episode \"Mickey and the Culture Clash\", he manipulated Mickey into believing Minnie desires a more sophisticated boyfriend, resulting in the mouse changing his persona to the point where Minnie believes he's out of her league, leaving her in the hands of Mortimer.\n\nInterestingly, a different side of Mortimer was showcased in the cartoon \"Mickey's Mix-Up\", where Mickey accidentally sent a heartwarming fax to Mortimer (which was actually meant for Minnie) having Mortimer believe Mickey wanted to make amends, which he immediately agreed to. This shows that perhaps Mortimer does hold a softer side, and wouldn't mind becoming friends with Mickey if the latter also wanted to let bygones be bygones. However, this softer side was never revealed again, due to either Mickey revealing the truth about the mix up, infuriating Mortimer, or more likely because the entire thing was used as a comical gag. He also showed remorse when he thought he had run over Mickey in the cartoon \"Mickey's April Fools\" (although given that it was April Fool's Day, it's likely that he knew Mickey was tricking him).\n\nMortimer has one catchphrase, \"Ha-cha-cha,\" which he has used since his reintroduction in Mickey Mouse Works. In some of the comics he says it differently; \"Hot-Cha-Cha.\"\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nMortimer is essentially a taller version of Mickey, and seems a bit more human-like. Unlike his rival, Mortimer has whiskers, and ears that are longer than Mickey's, perhaps to give him a more rodent-like appearance. He has feet the size of Goofy's. Unlike most of the other mouse characters, however, you can see two large teeth close together, like a real rodent. Mortimer usually wears a long-sleeved shirt and baggy pants with two buttons in the front (like Mickey's), but sometimes he also wears a porkpie hat.\n\nHistory\n\n1920s-1940s\n\nAfter losing the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit in a failed deal with Charles Mintz of Universal Puctures, Walt Disney and Roy O. Disney needed a new star to headline their cartoon studio. A mouse character was eventually conceived, and Walt dubbed his new creation \"Mortimer Mouse\". His wife, Lillian Disney, felt that the name was \"too pompous\" and instead suggested \"Mickey Mouse\".\n\nYears later, comic writer Floyd Gottfredson premiered Mr. Slicker and the Egg Robbers, a storyline for his Mickey Mouse comic strip that ran from September 22 through December 29, 1930.[1] The story introduced a rival suitor for Minnie's affections in the form of a lanky city mouse whose debonair behavior hid a conniving personality. In Gottfredson's story, Minnie Mouse's father, Marcus, is in danger of losing his ranch eggs. Mr. Slicker offers aid in return for Minnie's hand in marriage, and Mickey suspects him, but Slicker frames Mickey for the thefts. In the end, Mickey stops the wedding and proves it was actually Slicker who was behind the thefts. Mr. Slicker's design resembled that of Mickey's early appearance in Plane Crazy (1929), albeit taller and with striped slacks and dress shoes as opposed to Mickey's trademark shorts.\n\nIn 1935, development was underway at the animation division on a short subject involving Mickey's struggles against a similarly snide character out for Minnie's heart. Bearing a striking resemblance to Slicker, this new antagonist was dubbed \"Mortimer Mouse\". According to Leonard Maltin in the behind-the-scenes features of the Mickey Mouse in Living Color: Volume One DVD, Mortimer's name was an in-joke by the animators in reference to Mickey's origins. According to Maltin, Mortimer's physical features and fashion sense were made to resemble that of Walt Disney's. For Mickey's Rival, Mortimer was depicted as a tall, slender mouse who bore the physical features of a rat (namely an elongated snout, whiskers and two front teeth). Debuting in color, Mortimer's color palette consisted of greens, orange and beige—a stark contrast to the black, red and yellow palette of Mickey. Interestingly, Mortimer's face was given a Caucasian tone with pupil eyes, whereas Mickey retained his white mask and black dot eyes from the black-and-white cartoons. Mickey would later adopt the flesh-color tone and pupil eyes in Mickey's Surprise Party (1939). It is also interesting to note that Mortimer projects the haughty demeanor that soured Lillian Disney on the name \"Mortimer\" in the first place.\n\nIn his first animated appearance, Mickey's Rival, Mortimer is taking a drive in his fancy car, when he spots \"his old sweetie\" Minnie having a picnic with Mickey. He crashes their party, much to Minnie's amusement and Mickey's dismay. Mortimer and Mickey are immediately at odds, with the former looking to humiliate the latter with various obnoxious pranks. Despite Mickey's annoyance, Mortimer is invited to join him and Minnie for their picnic. In during which, Mortimer impresses Minnie with dinner tricks. He gets an idea of further impressing Minnie by toying with a nearby bull. Mortimer's antics annoy the bull, who eventually finds a way to escape his enclosure. Provoked, the bull attacks the picnic, causing Mortimer to drive away in fear, leaving Minnie and Mickey to face the bull's wrath. Mickey manages to rescue Minnie and escape the animal. While driving off and recounting the day's events, Minnie openly denounces Mortimer, much to Mickey's delight.\n\n1940s-present\n\nFrom April 14th through July 5th, 1941[1], Mortimer returned to the printed page as Montmorency Rodent. In the story Love Trouble, Monty claims to be of the Social Elite and, just like in his previous appearance, does everything he can to make Mickey look like a fool in front of Minnie, especially at Patricia Pigg's party. Although Gottfredson did not use Monty again after this, this version of Mortimer's design would go on to be the default design of the character in later comics, as well as inspire his later animated appearances. Montmorency would return sporadically, such as 1951's Sunday story Stormy Weather, and in the 1970s, in which he donned a blue costume with an orange hat and white mask.\n\nIn the 1986 television special Disney's DTV Romancin', Jiminy Cricket from Pinocchio, hosted a segment focused on Mickey and Minnie's romance. At one point, Jiminy uses the events of Mickey's Rival to exemplify one of the rough spots in Mickey and Minnie's history, even directly mentioning Mortimer as Mickey's \"big rival\".\n\nIn the live-action television series Sing Me a Story with Belle (1995-1999) starring Belle and Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, the events of Mickey's Rival are recounted by Belle in the episode \"What's Inside Counts\". Gaston, a villain similarly depicted as arrogant and licentious himself, expresses fondness for Mortimer, describing the mouse as an \"utterly charming chap\". Belle agrees, declaring that Mortimer was \"exactly like [Gaston]\", further asserting that Mortimer was \"so full of himself that all he could really see was himself.\"\n\nAfter decades of obscurity, Mortimer finally returned to animation in 1999 with the release of Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas, where he was Minnie's snooty boss and the CEO of a department store, here voiced by Jeff Bennett with a stereotypically upper-crust style of speaking, as opposed to Mortimer's traditionally nasal voice. His design is noticeably different here; he does not have his buck teeth and is drawn with a mustache instead of his usual whiskers.\n\nIn 2000, Mortimer was revitalized as a recurring antagonist in a series of cartoons on ABC titled Mickey Mouse Works, shepherded by Roy E. Disney, Bobs Gannaway and Tony Craig. The shorts established Mortimer as a recurring foil for Mickey, with the two competing in situations both surrounding Minnie and isolated from her. Mortimer's appearance retained elements from Mickey's Rival, but also took inspiration from his 1940's Gottfredson design, namely in his bulbous snout. Mortimer's voice was provided by Maurice LaMarche, in an exaggerated impression of comedian Jon Lovitz. LaMarche‘s vocal performance solidified Mortimer's catchphrase (\"Ha-cha-cha!\"), a riff on a similar phrase used by vaudeville comedian Jimmy Durante throughout the 1920s and 1930s (\"Hot-cha-cha-cha-cha!\"). In House of Mouse (2001-2003), the successor to Mickey Mouse Works, Mortimer continued to appear as a member of the ensemble cast, being depicted as the club's resident heckler.\n\n\"Mickey and the Goat Man\", a short that aired with the House of Mouse episode \"Dennis the Duck\" on May 18, 2002, is notable for featuring Mortimer in his only black-and-white animated appearance. As the short pays homage to the 1930's era of Mickey Mouse cartoons, Mortimer's visual design is intended to evoke the art direction of those cartoons, while also taking inspiration from previous iterations of the character such as Mickey's Rival and Gottfredson's Mr. Slicker; here, Mortimer has black dot-like \"pie-eyes\" and wears baggy slacks with two buttons, no shirt, plush shoes, a porkpie hat and a cane. The cartoon also depicts Mortimer's background as having once been a vaudeville actor for \"Lots Olaffs\" stage productions, serving as the leading man of a comedy routine with Mickey as his sidekick.\n\nOn November 23, 2002, Mortimer made his video game debut in Disney Sports Basketball, and subsequently made recurring appearances in the Disney Sports series on the GameCube. Jim Meskimen provided Mortimer's voice for these games, in a tone similar to Bennet's portrayal in Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas.\n\nIn 2006, Mortimer transitioned to computer animation in the preschool television series Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, cameoing in the episode \"Minnie's Birthday\". In this appearance, Mortimer wears the orange shirt from Mickey Mouse Works with yellow polka dots, blue pants, and yellow shoes. His ears were depicted here as large, perfect circles as opposed to Mortimer's traditionally longer, oval-shaped ears. Mortimer would later have a more prominent appearance as the villain of the two-part episode \"Super Adventure!\" and would further appear in the successor series Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures (2017-2021), and most recently as a recurring character in Mickey Mouse Funhouse (2021-present). For Mickey Mouse Funhouse, Mortimer's disposition was radically altered to better suit the show's target demographic, being portrayed as a friend to Mickey whose cocky attitude and shortsightedness unintentionally causes trouble. Mortimer's appearance was altered again for Mickey Mouse Funhouse, sporting perfectly round ears and a bow-tie while maintaining his green and orange color motif.\n\nIn 2013, Disney rebranded the Mickey Mouse character with a series of critically-acclaimed short cartoons headed by animator Paul Rudish. Several years into the series' run, Mortimer was integrated into the cast as an occasional antagonist to Mickey, and at one point, a rival to Peg-Leg Pete. This iteration of Mortimer is depicted as wearing his attire from Mickey's Rival, while also sporting black pie-eyes and a white mask to reflect the show's 1920s aesthetic. Mortimer later reappeared in The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse, which served as a successor to the shorts and premiered on the Disney+ streaming service in 2020. Episodes of The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse boasted longer runtimes than the original shorts. According to Rudish, this allowed the creative team to dedicate more screen-time to Mickey's villains, namely Pete and Mortimer.[3]\n\nFilms and television\n\nMickey's Once Upon a Christmas\n\nMortimer makes a brief appearance in the direct-to-video film Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas. Here, Mortimer is the snooty and wealthy owner of Mortimer's Department Store, and he speaks with a stereotypical upper-crust accent. Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck are notable employees of the store, and judging by Minnie's low-budget lifestyle, he does not pay well. In Mortimer's brief scene, Minnie hopes to earn the Christmas bonus for her extra-hard work, so that she may pay for a wonderful present for Mickey. However, Mortimer only gives her a fruitcake, leaving Minnie without money to buy the gift.\n\nMickey Mouse Works\n\nIn this series, Mortimer returned to animation as a recurring antagonist to Mickey, now drawn to match his redesign in the comic strip (see below).\n\nMortimer's first appearance in the series was the cartoon \"Mickey's Rival Returns\". In this cartoon, Mortimer and Mickey compete with each other in volleyball. The winner gets to ask Minnie on a date. Originally, Mickey refused to accept the idea being that it would be using Minnie as \"some kind of trophy\", but Mortimer's arrogance and mocking angers Mickey into competing. Mickey wins, but Mortimer reveals the competition prize to Minnie, causing her to believe Mickey thought of her as a prize (when it was really Mortimer who did). Minnie instead leaves with Mortimer but at the date, he begins to harass her for a kiss. Fortunately, she is saved by Mickey who she forgives (despite the fact it wasn't Mickey's fault in the first place) and has a beach dinner with.\n\nIn later episodes, Mortimer is Mickey's neighbor and is still competing with Mickey to win Minnie's heart, or simply trying to ruin Mickey's day. He is apparently wealthy, as he is shown to own far more advanced technology than his rival. One of Mortimer's most villainous roles was in the cartoon \"Big House Mickey\" where he falsely accused Mickey of robbing his house, got Mickey sent to prison, and even lied under oath. Fortunately, the police took another look at the evidence and instead arrested Mortimer and released Mickey.\n\nWhile Mortimer never succeeds in his plans nor does he come up on top of Mickey, some episodes did had both Mickey and Mortimer losing in the end, such as \"Mickey's Christmas Chaos\", \"Mickey's April Fools\", and \"Mickey's Big Break\".\n\nMortimer made a guest appearance in the Pluto segment \"Pluto Gets the Paper\". Here, he steals the newspaper Pluto was about to get for Mickey, and after a long chase, the dog finally gets back at him by making him bring the paper to Mickey like a dog.\n\nHouse of Mouse\n\nIn the television series House of Mouse, Mortimer gets a role as a recurring character. Mortimer appears many times as a guest and tries to trick Mickey and Minnie into breaking up or just flirt with the women. In the series' pilot episode, Mortimer appears briefly but is seen flirting with Donald Duck's girlfriend Daisy Duck instead. He would go on trying to have both Minnie and Daisy all to himself in later episodes. Mortimer proves to be hated by mostly all of the guests at the club, including villains, such as Ursula from The Little Mermaid and Gaston from Beauty and the Beast. It is even indicated in the episode \"Pete's Christmas Caper\" that the cruel Pete might even have a dislike for him.\n\nWhenever he's not flirting with Minnie or Daisy, Mortimer is seen flirting with other females in the audience, such as Megara from Hercules, Anastasia and Drizella from Cinderella, Laverne from The Hunchback of Notre Dame, or even the Queen of Hearts from Alice in Wonderland. A gag in several episodes like \"Pete's Christmas Caper\" and \"Mickey and the Culture Clash\" had Clarabelle interested in Mortimer much to his dismay.\n\nMortimer's most prominent appearance in the series is in \"The Mouse Who Came to Dinner\", in which he tricks Mickey and friends into believing he is a restaurant critic, and he forces them to treat him like a prince or he will give them a negative review which could close the club. Mortimer is foiled when Lumiere is revealed to be the actual critic and kicks him out.\n\nIn the final episode \"Mickey and the Culture Clash\", Mortimer used his initials to make it look like it either Mickey or Minnie were looking for someone else in order to make them separate for good. By the near end, however, Mickey realized Mortimer's scheme and was able to get Minnie back. Afterwards, the mice couple got back at Mortimer by adding his name to a newspaper and tricking Clarabelle into thinking he wanted to marry her.\n\nMickey Mouse Clubhouse\n\nMortimer has a non-speaking role in \"Minnie's Birthday\" seen sitting beneath a tree, playing the guitar.\n\nMortimer makes his only proper appearance on the series in the episode \"Super Adventure!\" as the main antagonist. Here, he has a supervillain ego named Megamort, who plots to take control over the Clubhouse World by shrinking all the landmarks and storing them within his zeppelin lair. During some time of the plotting, Mortimer forced the humble Pete to act as his minion, ordering him to go around to proceed with his bidding. When the problem reaches Mickey and friends' attention, Ludwig Von Drake creates a machine that transforms the clubhouse gang into a team of superheroes.\n\nTogether, they head out and are able to defeat Pete. However, Pete reveals he was forced to fulfill such evil deeds, under the control of \"the big boss\", who threatened to shrink Pete should he refuse to follow orders. Just then, Megamort arrives and does just that, due to Pete's failure. And with Pete no longer serving him, Megamort goes ahead and wreaks havoc amongst the world himself, leading to everything, including Mickey himself being shrunk and imprisoned. Under their hero egos, Donald, Goofy, Minnie, Daisy, and Pluto travel to Megamort's zeppelin where a battle ensues.\n\nSuccessfully, they retrieve the shrunken landmarks, but cause Megamort's blimp to go haywire in the process, putting Megamort in great peril. Mickey concocts a plan to successfully save the villainous mouse, and Megamort, being eternally grateful, apologizes and redeems himself, revealing that his true name is Mortimer Mouse and that he's the Clubhouse's newest neighbor. With his villainy in the past, Mortimer restores the peace in the Clubhouse world and is welcomed by Mickey and the gang into their circle of friends.\n\nStrangely, Mortimer's appearance in \"Minnie's Birthday\" seems to have been forgotten here, as he was showcased in Super Adventure! as the Clubhouse's new neighbor, as if Mickey and the gang had never known him prior to those events. It could be that Super Adventure! chronologically takes place first, despite having been made years later.\n\nMickey Mouse\n\nMortimer returns in Paul Rudish's Mickey Mouse animated series, retaining his original design from Mickey's Rival, but with a white face, black button eyes and white gloves instead of yellow like the other mouse characters.\n\nHe first appears in the episode \"No\", where Mickey's inability to say the word \"no\" is taken advantage of by Mortimer, who asks Mickey to borrow Minnie romantically. Though Mickey isn't able to refuse, Minnie stomps on Mortimer's foot and storms off. Later, a wounded and handicapped Mortimer angrily tells Mickey to keep his girl, believing she isn't worth the stress. In the final scene, Mortimer joins the other characters in asking Mickey if he minds them watching TV with him, to which Mickey responds with, \"Yes, I do mind.\"\n\nIn \"A Pete Scorned\", Pete fears that Mortimer is taking his place as Mickey's most hated bully. When Mickey proves Pete's suspicions, the latter falls into a depressed state. Mickey then takes it upon himself to help Pete out of the slump, but Mortimer sabotages Mickey's plans with another round of bullying. Mickey chides Mortimer and explains that he was trying to help Pete, to which Mortimer responds by insulting Pete. Having overheard the conversation, an annoyed Pete shows up and punches a fearful Mortimer into the sky.\n\nMickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures\n\nMortimer appears in the episode \"Daredevil Goofy!\", though this incarnation is a famous actor known as Morty McCool. He is idolized and adored by most people of Hot Dog Hills, including Minnie, Daisy, and Goofy, except for Donald, who points out that he's just an actor and his on-screen personality is different compared to real life. While participating in the town's race meant to promote teamwork and good sportsmanship, however, it is revealed that Morty's heroic persona on television is just an act, as in reality, he is a selfish, callous and arrogant man. At first, Goofy is too naïve to see that, but begins to after Daisy points out that Mortimer didn't even thank Goofy for saving his life. Mortimer technically wins the race, but because Goofy was the only one to show good sportsmanship and heart (considered to be the true measure of a hero) it was he who was given the race's grand prize in the end, which was getting his face put on Mr. Bigby's Daredevil Hero Motor Oil.\n\nThe Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse\n\nMortimer first appears in the episode \"The Brave Little Squire\", as a famous knight called Sir Mortimer, and boss of the titular squire, Mickey. It is eventually revealed that Mortimer is a coward, and simply takes the credit for the various feats accomplished by Mickey. In the end, Mortimer is exposed for a fraud and becomes the town's outcast.\n\nMickey Mouse Funhouse\n\nMortimer is a recurring character in the series, making his first appearance in the episode \"Maybe I'm A Maze.\" Here, Mortimer is depicted as a good friend of Mickey's, with a generally kindly demeanor in spite of some overbearing shortcomings. Minnie expresses discomfort when Mortimer visits the gang at the funhouse, due to Mortimer serving as a bad influence for the impressionable Mickey. Mortimer occasionally joins Mickey and friends on their adventures, though his arrogance tends to cause trouble.\n\nOther appearances\n\nMortimer made a cameo appearance in the Minnie's Bow-Toons episode \"Slumber Party\", when Minnie, Daisy, Clarabelle, Millie, and Melody are watching a scary film on TV.\n\nIn the web series Mickey Go Local, Mortimer makes recurring appearances as a background character.\n\nPrinted media\n\nComics\n\nAround the time the cartoon short Mickey's Rival came out, Gottfredson adapted it into a storyline in the Mickey Mouse Sunday strip, but with a noticeably different plot. Mickey goes over to Minnie's house to visit, only to be greeted by Mortimer, who is also visiting Minnie. After Minnie introduces him to Mickey, Mortimer proceeds to make Mickey look like a fool in front of her. Each day, he keep pulling pranks on Mickey in hopes of getting rid of him. In the end, Mickey got the better of him, and Minnie kicked Mortimer out.\n\nFive years later, Mortimer returned to the daily comic strip as Montmorency Rodent (surname pronounced \"Ro-dawn\"), or Monty for short, in Gottfredson's storyline \"Love Trouble\", with help from his cousin Madeline, Mickey manages to expose that Monty is really nothing more than a thieving chauffeur in front of the real Social Elite. Although Gottfredson did not use Monty again after this, this version of Mortimer's design would go on to be the default design of the character in later comics, as well as his above-mentioned return to animation.\n\nThe character returned again in \"The Copper's Catch\", published in Walt Disney's Comics and Stories #67, now called Mortimer Rodent, and officially becoming a recurring antagonist to Mickey afterward. In later comic appearances under other writers, Mortimer sometimes teamed up with Mickey's other rivals, such as Pete, Sylvester Shyster, and Muscles McGurk. In some comics, it was shown that Mortimer is rich and lives in a mansion, and he can also fly a plane. Occasionally he is depicted as a neutral character.\n\nVideo games\n\nDisney Golf\n\nMortimer appears as the final boss in the Playstation 2 game. After completing the golf tournament, Mortimer suddenly appears on a plane, destroys the awards stand, and steals the prize trophy from Mickey. Mortimer takes the winner's cup to an enchanted golf course in the sky, where he is confronted by the player. Mortimer challenges the player to a game of golf—winner gets the trophy, loser falls back to Earth. After Mortimer is defeated, he becomes a playable character.\n\nOther games\n\nMortimer was a staple in the GameCube series Disney Sports. He appeared in Disney Sports Soccer, Football, and Basketball.\n\nMortimer is also featured as a unlockable and playable character in the app game Disney Crossy Road.\n\nDisney Parks\n\nDisneyland Resort\n\nTo date, Mortimer has yet to make any live appearances in the Disney theme parks. However, a mural with several classic Disney characters during the Disney California Adventure expansion was seen with Mortimer being one of the characters featured. Also at the park, Mortimer's name is featured in the shop Mortimer's Market which is located on Buena Vista Street.\n\nAt Minnie's House in the Mickey's Toontown area, the W.A.C.K.Y. radio broadcast includes a news report stating that Mortimer was arrested for stealing a portrait of Minnie, getting caught when he tripped and smashed his head through the portrait. According to the report, Mortimer claimed that he was \"framed\".\n\nIn the queue for Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway, Mortimer cameos on a mock poster for The Absent-Minded Professor Von Drake.\n\nGallery\n\nTrivia\n\nA potential earlier predecessor to Mortimer and Slicker existed in the Alice Comedies short \"Alice Helps the Romance\", where Julius the Cat loses his cat girlfriend to a tall skinny rival and attempts suicide until Alice helps him get the girl back.\n\nThe name of his prototype, Slicker, means a person who is smooth and persuasive but untrustworthy. It also refers to the term, \"city slicker.\"\n\nMortimer bears resemblance to an obscure character, Ruffhouse Rat, who is a cousin of Minnie's from an early Mickey Mouse newspaper comic.\n\nReferences\n\nMortimer Mouse at INDUCKS\n\nMedia Short Films: Mickey Mouse series • Donald Duck series • Goofy series • Pluto series • Chip and Dale series\n\nFeature Length Films: Fantasia • Saludos Amigos • The Three Caballeros • Fun and Fancy Free • Melody Time • DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp • Disney's The Twelve Days of Christmas • A Goofy Movie • Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas • Fantasia 2000 • An Extremely Goofy Movie • Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse • Mickey's House of Villains • Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers • Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas • Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers\n\nTelevision: Mickey Mouse Club • The Wonderful World of Disney • DuckTales • Chip 'n Dale Rescue Rangers • Darkwing Duck • Goof Troop • Quack Pack • Mickey's Fun Songs • Mickey Mouse Works • House of Mouse • Mickey Mouse Clubhouse • Minnie's Bow-Toons • Mickey Mouse • DuckTales • Mickey Mouse Mixed-Up Adventures • Legend of the Three Caballeros • Mickey Go Local • The Wonderful World of Mickey Mouse • Mickey Mouse Funhouse • Chip 'n' Dale: Park Life • Mickey Mouse Clubhouse 2.0\n\nDisney Parks Mickey's Toontown • Mickey and Minnie's Runaway Railway • PLAY!\n\nEntertainment: Disney Adventure Friends Cavalcade • Stitch's Interplanetary Beach Party Blast • It’s Very Minnie! • Minnie's Tiara of Dreams • Minnie, We Love You! • Club Mouse Beat • Mickey and Friends: An Extra Big Adventure • Minnie @ Funderland • Quacky Celebration ★ Donald the Legend!\n\nSpring: Disney's Easter Wonderland • Hippity Hoppity Springtime • Usatama on the Run!\n\nSummer: Summer Blast • Disney's Summer Oasis Splash • Mickey's WaterWorks\n\nHalloween: Re-Villains!
