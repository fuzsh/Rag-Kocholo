        "text": "One of the most enjoyable aspects of watching a Todd Haynes film is the conversations afterward. He is an analytical filmmaker with many layers to his narrative, often without a clear ending; his films can occupy your brain long after they’ve ended. That’s just the effect that his psychological melodramedy May December is having on Letterboxd members—particularly Nora: “As a bit (a bit that is literally only funny to me) I’ve seen it three times in theaters to treat it like people treat blockbusters,” she writes. “But after a point it’s like okay no this movie actually is just very very good, biting and hilarious and weird, and it gets funnier every time I see it.” (She’s now onto her fourth watch, observing, “This whole movie is a beautiful mystery told through scenes of people talking to each other and about each other.”)\n\nWe interrogated Todd Haynes about some of the cinematic secrets to unravelling his beautiful mystery—video of which you can watch above—but before we get there, we have to go back to 2015, when May December is set. It all begins with the arrival of television actress Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman) in Savannah, Georgia. She’s here to meet Gracie (Julianne Moore), the woman whose tabloid scandal she’s about to resurrect with her portrayal in an upcoming indie film. The tale is such: in the ’90s, a then 36-year-old Gracie worked at a local pet store, where she was caught having an illicit affair with a thirteen-year-old shopboy, Joe (Charles Melton plays the 2015-set version). In prison, Gracie gave birth to their first child (Piper Curda); when she was released, they married and had two more children (Elizabeth Yu and Gabriel Chung).\n\nTwenty years later, and they’re still together. Joe is now a man about the same age as both the actress herself and as Gracie was when the story initially broke. With the embattled couple preparing to become empty nesters as their twins go to college, Elizabeth’s observational style starts conversations the two had avoided throughout their history.\n\n“This delves into the homoerotic aspects of observing, studying, and embodying another woman’s persona,” writes danielleloucamp in a five-star review, continuing with praise for Samy Burch’s debut screenplay, and noting that “the remarkable evenness is profoundly compassionate. And Haynes skillfully infuses high camp with a rare blend of tenderness and confrontation.”\n\nBecause this is the first thing I thought of when I saw the film and then it was on your list, let’s start withPersona. How do you see your film having a conversation with Ingmar Bergman’s?\n\nTodd Haynes: Well, just to even say your film has a conversation with Ingmar Bergman’s film Persona is a tall order, but I couldn’t not think of Persona when I first read Samy’s script, in the clear way that it’s such a unique example of a film that pairs these two women and where likenesses are being exchanged, or that one character is learning about the likeness of the other and trying to incorporate her into her process as an actor. And in Persona, Liv Ullmann plays an actress who’s been stricken with stage fright and has stopped speaking. Bibi Andersson is a nurse and a caretaker, called in to look after her.\n\nBergman’s original instinct for the film, I read somewhere, was an image. Sometimes it just starts there; that’s happened for me before. You just sort of get an image or a feeling, and that’s where the whole movie kind of derives from. And for him it was this image of these two attractive blonde women, who resembled each other, in matching straw hats, in the sun, comparing hands.\n\nThat shot figures into the film Persona, but it’s not necessarily the shot you think of when we all think of Persona. The ultimate shot is where these two are almost playing as if they’re in a mirror, and their gaze turns to the lens of the camera. It’s like a dream. It’s coming out of a dream that Bibi Andersson is having, and one of them sort of brushes the bangs of the hair from the other. It’s a moment where time stops in cinema. There were opportunities in this movie to play with scenes in mirrors and to play with watching these two complicated, powerful women in a dance of resemblances and a power dynamic and watching all those things. So, it was impossible to not be inspired by Bergman.\n\nYou mentioned that Liv Ullmann plays an actress in Persona, so let’s stick with performance: the next one we want to get to is Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard, who also has a breakdown. Is all acting a form of madness?\n\nI love that question. I mean, I don’t think Samy Burch or Natalie Portman or Julianne Moore would necessarily disagree, and they’d be interested in what that question opens up. Sunset Boulevard, in this context, however, is the first film that I think about when I think about a story of an older woman, younger man relationship.\n\nWhen this script first came to me, and it evoked our memories as a culture of Mary Kay Letourneau and how distinctive a story that was and how much that dominated the tabloid landscape when it came out, it made me go, “Wait a minute. These stories about older women and younger men have been a through line in some of the most formative and influential and most beautiful films ever made in Hollywood.” Sunset Boulevard, again, it’s about acting and it’s about an actor, and it’s about an aging actor. So, the actor side of the continuum is switched or swapped in Sunset Boulevard, because Natalie Portman is the actor in our movie, who’s the younger woman. But that alone set in motion themes that have already been out there that I thought [Sunset Boulevard] was the place to start in my preparation.\n\nAnd the most famous line from that film, of course, is, “Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my closeup.” I wanted to ask about your use of closeups in May December, specifically the pet-shop scene when Natalie is acting out the seduction scene alone.\n\nThey’re selective, the closeups. I used a lot of zooms in the film and some of them have been discussed with a great deal of curiosity and attention by journalists, but this isn’t a scene that usually comes up, so thank you, but the zoom is part of that language of the movie.\n\nThe whole scene is just a series of zooms as we walk her into the corner where Gracie and Joe ostensibly had sex all those years ago. Then zooming in on the reverse angle, we start at the closest end of the zoom, in an intimate closeup of her as she’s imagining what it might be like to be in the throttles of this young man’s arms and be in the throes of that experience. We’re slowly zooming out and kind of pulling her out of the spell that has been cast by her moment alone, and it’s a moment where she has the freedom alone to really experience what the acting feels like.\n\nWe’ve got to get into the music. The next film you sent us isThe Go-Between—did you use Michel Legrand’s score directly or was it recreated?\n\nAll recreated and all rearranged and re-recorded by Marcelo Zarvos, my composer, and added to with original music. He filled it out; it really became Marcelo’s own score, but it uses the melodic signature from The Go-Between, which is a film that I had forgotten about. While I was collecting more directly relevant sources and ideas and reference films for May December—primarily to put into my image book and create a visual example of what the script did in words to start to share with my creative departments—The Go-Between was on Turner Classic Movies, and I watched it. I think I saw it when it came out when I was a kid, but it’s a film that’s sort of fallen out of sight and is not something you see brought up much, and so I hadn’t seen it in so many years, and I had forgotten so much about it.\n\nThe score asserts itself at the beginning of that movie with such force, an ominous sense of foreboding, and puts you truly on the edge of your seat as a viewer. Because the story is this sort of pastoral coming-of-age story—set at the turn of the century—of a boy who visits his rich friend’s family for the summer and develops an infatuation with his [friend’s] older sister, Julie Christie. The score makes you read every piece of the frame as the film unfolds, looking for clues as to where this film is leading and what’s behind the manifest narrative that we get in the story. That was so exhilarating to me, and I thought it could be so applicable to the experience of watching this film.\n\nWhen you were first editing, did you always include that score before the “I don’t think we have enough hot dogs” line? Because with the score and the zooms you speak of, that is such a great entry to the tone of the film.\n\nEven more crazily, before filming, I put in every cue that I thought music would play. This was really for Marcelo, but I was on the plane to Savannah to begin pre-production, and I just made notes in the whole script for where I thought music would play, and I laid in cues from The Go-Between. This was basically a document I was creating for Marcelo to start getting the wheels of his brilliant mind going as early as possible.\n\nI first shared the score with all my partners who were looking at the image book, but then on set, we were playing each cue and turning down the music for the dialogue recording and then turning it back up. I just started to use The Go-Between cues in every single shot that we shot on set. So, we were all inundated with this music. This music was how we experienced the shooting of the film—I’ve never done anything like that before. That informed so many things that followed: the editing and ultimately my choice to try to really use that melodic aspect of Legrand’s score.\n\nSpeaking of music, we’ll go toThe Graduate next. Iconic pop music, of course. What is your memory of the first time that you saw The Graduate, and how did that affect you?\n\nMan, The Graduate was one of those films that I saw when I was young that, literally, I started to feel the pulse of creative desire as a filmmaker when I watched it, because of the way the movie is shot, the choices about how that movie is visualized. This is very relevant to what we did in May December, and it’s also relevant to another film on my list, Manhattan, which Gordon Willis shot for Woody Allen. Both of these films, of course, are comedies.\n\nOne thing that I wanted to focus on The Graduate for is the use of actual graduation. Graduation is a part of your storyline as well: it’s a natural transition but at different stages, different hopes and fears.\n\nThat’s interesting; I hadn’t necessarily thought of that aspect of The Graduate in relation to this story. Because The Graduate is the sort of malaise that follows a graduation and a successful series of years in college, ostensibly, as we learned in this sort of alienation that follows that moment of him leaving school and coming back home.\n\nThis is the reverse, where we’re leading up to the graduation that marks the end, the penultimate end of the story, and a kind of panic, a kind of anxiety that I think is being felt by Gracie and Joe throughout the film that is certainly compounded by Elizabeth’s emergence and entry into their lives. But it’s also about the empty nest that’s looming, and the fact that that house is going to be empty with each other in it and be forced to confront each other in ways they never had before.\n\nBut to me, the way The Graduate works is in the performances and the incredible script. The comedy is how it gets the audience thinking about what’s going on off the frame. The cuts have a suspenseful element to them, so they’re part of the humor of how that film works.\n\nThat’s true for Manhattan as well, where shots are allowed to play out and not move. The gorgeous compositions of Gordon Willis are setting the stage for this story about Manhattan contemporary social life and culture. And how actors [like in The Graduate] are used in blocking: these wide-angle frames that are locked off inside apartment rooms. Diane Keaton and Woody Allen have a conversation and they keep leaving the frame and coming back in and going down the hallway and coming around the corner.\n\nThat slight distance gives it its humor. If it was constantly cutting and covering every angle, it would’ve dissipated something really sharp and really observant about that film, and an entire tone that’s conducted through the whole film. It’s something that lent similar ideas about waiting for the cut and holding until you’re kind of squirming in your seat, in May December.\n\nAnd with those two films grouped together, I think maybe it could be a good time to talk about the term “May-December romance”, which I didn’t even know prior to this. Many people reading this probably won’t, so, what is a May-December romance?\n\nIt’s interesting when something is known in the American vernacular and not in the British. It’s definitely a term that doesn’t translate out of the English language well. I’ve just always thought of it as a slightly old-fashioned, demure way of describing a relationship between an elder and a younger person with a big age gap. May is spring, December is winter—that range. But the film’s title plays into the month of May, too, and May is the bracketed month of an inevitability around the summer. It begins with a Memorial Day celebration and ends with graduation. So all this anxiety and nerves are circulating through that month and it plays into the title as well.\n\nWell, since we’re on the calendar,Sunday Bloody Sunday is the last film on your list.\n\nIt’s always been a favorite film of mine. It also deals with an older, younger relationship, but in triplicate, because it’s an older woman and an older man who were both involved with a younger man, played by Murray Head. It’s Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch with him. It’s set in contemporary London in the early 1970s, and it’s about all these sophisticates who are aware that the same young man is having a relationship with an older woman and an older man. They even share somewhat of a social circle, the two elder characters, and it’s really hard on [them]. The young one has all the freedom and the prerogative to come and go, and they’re left with the desire to try to hang on. They desire, but they try to pretend that they’re more mature.\n\nAt the very end, the Murray Head character goes off to America to pursue his career as a sculptor. And finally, Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch meet at a park across the street from a mutual friend’s house. It shares a final setting with May December, where the two people who’ve been facing off through the movie have a face off in a park at the end. In Sunday Bloody Sunday, they haven’t seen each other through the whole film, so you’re building up anticipation for that scene. It’s just a beautifully shot and constructed film."
