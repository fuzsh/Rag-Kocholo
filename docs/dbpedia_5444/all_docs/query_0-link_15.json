I get it — pretty people sell streaming subscriptions/movie passes. But is this long-standing trend in Hollywood hurting people’s self-image, and maybe even the shows themselves?\n\nWe constantly obsess over the hottest new stars, what they’re wearing, and what they’re up to. However, is seeing beautiful people on screen a healthy escape from everyday life? Or is it actually bringing viewers down (women especially) by comparison, leading to issues such as eating disorders and dysmorphia?\n\nWhile yes — many of the actors/actresses we see are physically beautiful — they have entire teams to make sure of it. It is not a reflection of the everyday person. (Unless you happen to have make-up, and wardrobe, and lighting crews following you around.)\n\nMost top shows feature beautiful people"
