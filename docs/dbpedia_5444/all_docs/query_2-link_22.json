Have an account? .\n\nHollywood's golden age took place from the end of the silent film era to the early 1960s, and was a high point for the film industry.\n\nThe era was also rife with heartthrobs, many of whom drew huge box office numbers for their respective studios.\n\nFrom Marlon Brando to Marilyn Monroe to Paul Newman, movie lovers in the early and mid 20th century had a lot to look forward to.\n\nVisit Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.

Though many Justin Bieber and One Direction fans may think their crushes are the first in existence, crush-worthy famous people are a phenomenon that dates back to Hollywood's golden age.\n\nSilent film star Rudolph Valentino, for example, is considered by some to be one of Hollywood's first heartthrobs.\n\nFrom Cary Grant to Sophia Loren to Doris Day, here are 27 swoon-worthy stars from Hollywood's golden years.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore she became a princess, Grace Kelly was known for her beauty and talent in Hollywood.\n\nGrace Kelly's star-making performance came in 1953 when she appeared in \"Mogambo\" opposite Clark Gable. After that, Alfred Hitchcock took her under his wing and made her the star of \"Dial M for Murder\" and \"Rear Window,\" turning her into a household name. Kelly won an Academy Award in 1955 for her role in \"Country Girl.\"\n\nIn 1956, she left Hollywood to marry Prince Rainier and became the princess of Monaco. She still remains a beauty and style icon today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrank Sinatra was the original heartthrob.\n\nThe ladies called him \"Ol' Blue Eyes,\" and the world called the ladies \"bobby soxers.\" In the mid-'30s, singer and actor Frank Sinatra became, arguably, the original heartthrob. Ladies around the nation flocked to his shows, as The Guardian's New York correspondent observed about Sinatra in 1945:\n\n\"The United States is now in the midst of one of those remarkable phenomena of mass hysteria … the teenage girls who constitute the main part of his audience also wear short white half-hose, and are therefore called 'bobby-sox girls' or, more simply, 'bobby-soxers.'\"\n\nAnd according to Mental Floss, Sinatra's publicist, George Evans, even auditioned bobby soxers to scream at Sinatra's concerts, paying them a few bucks each to ignite excitement for the star.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarilyn Monroe was one of the original sex symbols.\n\nMarilyn Monroe started out in Hollywood in the late '40s, but she really started to get her footing — and gain heightened exposure — after appearing in films like \"The Seven Year Itch\" (1955) and \"The Misfits\" (1961). She was known \"both for her winsome embodiment of the Hollywood sex symbol, and her tragic personal and professional struggles within the film industry,\" according to IMDb.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJames Dean's bad boy persona has had a lasting legacy.\n\nAnother teen idol of his time, actor James Dean was known for his bad boy persona and, fittingly, his role in 1955's \"Rebel Without a Cause.\"\n\nDean only made three movies in his lifetime, as the budding actor died in a car accident at the age of 24 in 1955. His premature death left him etched into American pop culture as a forever young, T-shirt-and-jeans-clad icon. The New York Times described the enduring James Dean image as \"clear, remaining strong, instantly recognizable, American as Coca-Cola.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJayne Mansfield was one of the leading ladies in '50s and '60s film.\n\nDescribed as \"one of the leading sex symbols of the 1950s and 1960s,\" Jayne Mansfield was a popular actress who was also noted for her resemblance to Marilyn Monroe, a contemporary. She was tragically killed in a car accident in 1967, leaving behind 31 films to her name, and a still-iconic image.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith blue eyes and a knack for romance, Paul Newman captured hearts in the 1950s.\n\nPiercing blue eyes, a thoroughly gentleman-like manner, and acting chops to boot — how can you go wrong?\n\nPaul Newman came onto the scene in the mid-1950s, fresh out of the Actors Studio. Successful turns in box-office hits, like \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\" (1958) and \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" (1962), cemented his place in Hollywood as a bona fide hunk and movie star.\n\nHis 2008 obituary in the LA Times reads: \"His irresistible good looks suggested more of a romantic hero than an unregenerate rogue, but he had a way of incorporating into his seductive appeal (those oceanic eyes, those killer abs!) a startling barbed-wire-like menace.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnown for her side-swept hair, Veronica Lake was a total glamour girl.\n\nNicknamed \"the peek-a-boo girl\" for her signature, side-swept tresses that covered her right eye, actress Veronica Lake started out in a string of successful films in the late '30s and early '40s. She reached the peak of her fame and glamour after portraying Lieutenant Olivia D'Arcy in 1943's \"So Proudly We Hail!,\" which was a box-office smash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven Cary Grant wanted to be Cary Grant.\n\nKnown for his Trans-Atlantic accent and suave charm, actor Cary Grant became one of Hollywood's biggest stars from the '30s well into the '50s.\n\nHe appeared in famous films such as \"The Philadelphia Story\" (1940), \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), and Alfred Hitchcock's \"North by Northwest\" (1959). According to the Quad-City Times, \"Grant's masculine elegance and darkly handsome features made him an unrivaled star of both sophisticated comedy and chilling intrigue for more than 30 years.\"\n\nAs the actor's famous quote reads: \"Everyone wants to be Cary Grant. Even I want to be Cary Grant.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nItalian beauty Sophia Loren stunned the silver screen.\n\nSophia Loren first caught the attention of an agent while competing in a beauty pageant at age 14, and the rest, as they say, is history. She won an Oscar in 1960's \"Two Women,\" the culmination of over a decade of successful work in Hollywood. Loren is often referred to as \"one of world cinema's greatest treasures.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRock Hudson's manly good looks won the big screen's attention.\n\nRock Hudson burst onto the scene in the early 1950s, and, after filming hits like \"Magnificent Obsession\" (1954) and \"All That Heaven Allows\" (1955) with Universal Studios, he became a heartthrob by the end of the decade. Hudson was known for his \"easy-going\" charm on screen, as well as his manly good looks.\n\nTragically, Hudson died of AIDS in 1985, which exposed his homosexuality to the world after years of speculation and cover-ups. Hudson was the first major celebrity to die from the disease, and to speak publicly about it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHandsome and innovative, Montgomery Clift's quiet charm enchanted the big screen.\n\nThe Guardian calls Montgomery \"Monty\" Clift \"one of the most innovative and handsome actors in history.\" Clift dominated the silver screen throughout the 1930s, '40s, '50s, and even into the early '60s, appearing in such classics as \"The Misfits\" (1961) and \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961).\n\nClift was also one of the first \"method\" actors to study with Lee Strasberg, alongside Marlon Brando and Elia Kazan. His turbulent personal life has often been discussed in the media, as Clift struggled with his homosexuality and substance abuse issues throughout his life.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRita Hayworth was everyone's dream girl during the World War II era.\n\nHollywood maven Rita Hayworth made her film debut at 16, and after a string of mediocre films, hit it big with 1941's \"The Strawberry Blonde\" and \"You'll Never Get Rich.\" In the latter film, she danced alongside Fred Astaire in a performance that \"exuded the warmth and seductive vitality that was to make her famous.\"\n\nHayworth is perhaps most well-known for her role in 1946's \"Gilda,\" which made her a bonafide superstar. She famously quipped, \"Men fell in love with Gilda, but they wake up with me.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore he was \"The Godfather,\" Marlon Brando was a Hollywood stud.\n\nBefore he was \"The Godfather\" and widely lauded as the greatest actor of all time, Marlon Brando was a young star on the heels of Lee Strasberg training and a brief stint on the live stage. But after scoring successful movie roles in \"On the Waterfront\" (1954) and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), he became a Hollywood heartthrob. The actor was a known womanizer, too, fathering 11 children in his lifetime with his wives and lovers.\n\nMarlon Brando's sexy status has outlived him, as gifs of the actor flirtatiously rolling his eyes during his screen test for \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" are still driving the internet crazy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTyrone Power's good looks impacted box office numbers from the '30s to the '50s.\n\nTyrone Power was a major heartthrob of the 1930s to 1950s, known for his roles as a swashbuckler and romantic lead.

Errol Flynn a run for their money as resident sex symbol; someone who could pull in as many female as male moviegoers.\"\n\nSadly, Power's career was cut short as he died of a heart attack on set in 1958, but he remains a staple of the old Hollywood era.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoris Day was the ultimate \"good girl\" of the '50s.\n\nAudiences loved Doris Day for her bubbly personality on screen, as well as her all-American beauty and singing voice.
