        "text": "Fair skin, big eyes, a perfect jawline, sharp nose, pouty lips, a slim figure, and whatnot. Setting body and beauty standards is highly encouraged in this ignorant yet boastful 21st century. The fact that appearances can be deceptive is familiar to many people but is acknowledged only by very few. People fail to appreciate themselves in all aspects they strive for, and the reason for this is the fear of being judged, and guess what? Society is judgmental above all. Beauty standards around the world are insanely irrational. They never remain the same, and the thirst for attuning to the standards is a never-ending process.\n\nThe world nurtures every beautiful creature with distinct characteristics, yet the people of the world set certain standards that segregate them from one another. Setting beauty ethics is one of the major reasons that forcefully made people change their lifestyles in this ever-changing world. These standards differ from culture to culture and from person to person.\n\nBeauty standards have their own benefits. They also acquire positive effects that help people in many ways, but setting high standards is exceedingly harmful.\n\nInstead of comprehending the fact that beauty is relative and subjective, half of the world’s population believes that grooming themselves according to higher standards will make them part of a community. Whereas the question is, why change yourself for someone else? It’s just that, society’s perspective is more important than their own.\n\nAbove all, the most horrid perspective is to change one’s whole self completely after being influenced. This exposes the backward logic of people living in this world.\n\nWhat are beauty standards?\n\nBeauty standards are a set of values applied to the appearance of both men and women to be regarded as beautiful and handsome in order to rightly fit in the community. These standards are concerned with people’s skin, hair, clothing, and other parts of the body.\n\nModern beauty norms follow impractically rough standards that are difficult to cope with. Women, in general, are supposed to inherit a good body image than men. Therefore, it is evident that many women are super conscious of their vanity. And hence, with the influence of great fashionistas, women are obsessed with beauty.\n\nEvery movie, series, short film, and advertisement showcases beautiful women and handsome hunks to attract people. Even more, social media nowadays encourages content creators to influence people around the world through their TikTok videos and reels. Without a doubt, these exposures lay the basic groundwork for setting body and beauty standards around the world.\n\nBeauty Standards For a Woman\n\nIt is natural that every woman’s instinct is to look gorgeous, and there is nothing wrong with taking care of the body and skin. After all, appearance gives confidence to a person and enhances personality.\n\nBut the views of beauty over the years have been constantly changing, and women are continuously attempting to adapt themselves to the standards that were set during that time.\n\nBack in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, women were not accustomed to social platforms but carried a natural, flawless beauty. Though certain trends were welcomed in the 1900s, women had no pressure and a complete obsession with those prevailing trends.\n\nIn the present, body and beauty benefits that were set back in the 20th century are restored again, but with extra effects with the arrival of effective beauty enhancers. Moreover, introducing new styles and trends every once in a while is one of the leading causes why women are stuck in making the grade to accomplish societal standards and their desires to become the so-called “most beautiful.”\n\nThe need to wholly submerge in the ideal standards can be for two main reasons, one being the societal context and the other being the obsession created by themselves or by social media.\n\nDominating Beauty Standards Around The World\n\nThere are numerous beauty standards set around the world that are positive as well as unrealistic. But few of these standards, despite their pros and cons, leave an everlasting impact on people.\n\nLet’s learn what are the dominating beauty standards around the world\n\nKorean Beauty Standards\n\nEvery k-drama watcher and K-pop fan would have known how the standards of beauty are the gold mine of South Korea. South Korea bags first place for setting one of the most dominant beauty standards in the world. Korean skincare products are today’s most preferred beauty essentials to look presentable, without a doubt.\n\nThe buzzing “glass skin” trend that stirred a fuss in other countries also had its true origin in Korea. This sensational ideal skin made both men and women set their hearts on the skincare routine to achieve such radiant, glowing skin which sooner or later spurred a sense of hyper-fixation among men and women.\n\nAlmost every Korean develops the desire to look appealing with whitening skin products, and therefore they put in the time and money to look attractive. Undoubtedly, the country follows the strictest beauty standards and has procured the highest position for cosmetic surgeries.\n\nHaving pale, flawless glass skin; big eyelids; a pointed nose and jawline; thigh gaps; and a petite, slim body are some of the major features of Korean beauty standards set for a female. Nose jobs, liposuction, and double eyelid surgeries are hugely fancied by many Koreans, including men, to reshape their bodies and features to look more attractive.\n\nKorean face sheet masks have their own fanbase. They are the most sought-after beauty product all over the world, and they are bought in massive numbers. Face sheet masks and whitening skin products preferred by K-pop idols are highly bought by the netizen, which is an act of advertisement to obtain real beauty as per Korean standards.\n\nConsequently, all these body and beauty positives raise the bar and set certain norms of beauty for males.\n\nHowever, the paragon of male beauty includes a tall, clean-shaven face, pale skin, large eyes, a high nose, and a slim figure.\n\nSince K-pop stars are the great influencers of Korean beauty standards, it is apparent that every fan globally attempts to change their lifestyle, be it unrealistic. Therefore, it is essential to understand that setting high body and beauty positives is dangerous. Following extremely dangerous starvation diets like the coffee diet, eating one meal a day, and going without eating for days can eventually lead to inevitable and dangerous health consequences.\n\nThe obsession with beauty is perceived in almost every Korean, and the urge to fit into society forecasts the country’s cultural struggles and cynical views in terms of beauty norms. As a result, women in Korea are most affected by these unrealistic beauty standards, which have led to an increase in the number of underweight young women. Thus, they are the victims of low self-esteem and self-confidence due to social conformity.\n\nWestern Beauty Standards\n\nAre there any 90s kids who haven’t fallen head over heels when looking at F.R.I.E.N.D.S. sitcom star Rachel Green? That’s definitely out of the question for everyone.\n\n“The Rachel Haircut” had a massive effect on almost every American during the late 90s. From adoring 90s top fashion icon Jennifer Aniston to being smitten with the most adorable Angelina Jolie for her defined facial shape, everyone’s grown up seeing Hollywood movies, and we love how the appearance of the characters perfectly matches their casual looks.\n\nBecause Hollywood stands as a powerful influencer, western beauty standards are always the talk of the town about its domination in the context of ideal standards of beauty. These standards are regarded as the global standard of beauty.\n\nSince English rulings can be traced back to the period of colonization and imperialism, the country retains the essence of native soil impressions in and across Asia.\n\nWho in the world is clueless about the amount of influence these Kardashians and Jenners hold today to sway the world?\n\nWell, decades ago, the western archetype of beauty was notable for having white or light-skinned tones, million-dollar legs, and a slim figure. With the passage of time, the definition of beauty tends to change, and currently, the aesthetic figures of the Kardashians and the Jenners are set as the benchmark of western beauty.\n\nSo, what do the current western beauty standards look like?\n\nTypically, a curvy figure, tanned skin, big eyes, plumpy lips, thick thighs, large busts, and big butts are the main aesthetic appeals for a female. Now, if you are wondering about how women get those big, fat lips, it is no surprise that all is set to go with lip fillers. Surgeries like breast augmentation are a dime a dozen in western countries, promoting unhealthy figures to attain the highest level of beauty.\n\nBy no means could anyone ever neglect the fact that western beauty standards are ranked the highest for possessing the most dominant beauty standards in the world.\n\nSimply put, all Asian beauty idealization and other prevalent beauty standards worldwide are by-products of Western beauty. Therefore, western body and beauty stereotypes are widely spread from country to country and culture to culture.\n\nCountries such as Japan, China, Korea, Lebanon, and the Middle East have been heavily influenced by the western acme of beauty, though there has been little difference in the applied aesthetic norms in recent years. Countries like South Africa, Nigeria, Senegal, Latin America, and India use skin-bleaching agents to lighten their skin tone.\n\nTop fashion icons and supermodels flashed in the magazine inspire everyone with their new styles and looks with their every comeback. This becomes a burning desire in the hearts of every woman to look as pretty as a picture displayed on the television.\n\nWestern countries, being the most beauty-obsessed, are also the biggest manufacturers of cosmetics that are used by people worldwide. They are the epitome of universal standards of beauty, with the highest sales in the beauty markets. The media especially infatuates young females and schoolchildren, who are prone to these unrealistic and toxic beauty standards.\n\nEmbracing unrealistic beauty standards is the main cause of the increase in racism, where skin color defines a person’s characteristics. Many people feel insecure and have developed a sense of loss within themselves. They are mentally and emotionally triggered by social media or by the judgments made by society about their looks. And people who love to groom themselves are obsessed to the point that they fail to recognize they are reaching for an extreme level of change, which would open doors to all different kinds of health problems.\n\nReasons Why High Beauty Standards Around The World are Toxic and Dangerous\n\n1. Body Dysmorphia\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 2 percent of the population is affected by body dysmorphia. Unrealistic beauty standards lead to body dysmorphia, which is a mental health disorder developed in a person who immerses themselves in a sea of disappointment pertaining to their looks. They believe that their appearance has more defects than anyone else’s. This serious disorder is more likely to be seen in young teenagers and adults. Symptoms include continuously looking in the mirror, finding minor flaws, attempting to cover them through makeup, avoiding social situations, and many more. Many a time, the flaws are just in the person’s imagination. Both males and females are equally affected by body dysmorphia.\n\n2. Negative Emotions\n\nWhen a woman is acknowledged as ugly, she certainly develops negative emotions within her and continues to water them until they grow into anxiety. There is no doubt that setting beauty norms catalyzes negative emotions such as low self-esteem and a very low level of confidence in a person, especially in women. These negative emotions eventually make the person mentally unstable and prevent them from indulging in social activities. The person feels flustered and embarrassed about his or her looks, eventually making him or her anxious and consequently leading to a depressed state.\n\nSelf–hatred is another negative emotion that unfolds in the person who fails to embrace his own self. He fails to spot the difference between his thoughts and society’s perception and thus starts to hate himself, despite knowing that these negative body images and standards are man-made.\n\n3. Eating Disorders\n\nWith the advent of social media, eating disorders are on the rise. An eating disorder is a serious mental health state that is concerned with abnormal eating behavior and has a negative effect on the person’s physical and psychological health. Statistics on eating disorders revealed that global eating disorders have increased from 3.4% to 7.8%. According to the National Eating Disorders Association, around 70 million people internationally are subjected to food disorders. Apart from societal standards, social media is one of the main reasons for the increase in this kind of disorder. Women feel the urge to transform themselves after being influenced by the media and by constant societal pressures. Also, their intent to look drop-dead gorgeous completely creates an obsession with losing weight and becoming thin. Negative body image concerns are developed in the minds of many females, and therefore they attempt to starve and opt for dangerous diets.\n\nAnorexia nervosa is a disorder caused by starvation and an extreme diet. Another pervasive eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, is caused by fasting, purging, taking laxatives, or exercising to avoid weight gain after binge eating.\n\n4. Toxic Beauty Standards Lead to Suicidal Thoughts\n\nKnowing that the world solicits different cultures and people who are as different as chalk and cheese, man-made aesthetic norms of beauty exhort them to compare, whether Asian or Western. In modern days, many women feel envious of the beauty of others. They have a proclivity to compare their appearance to that of others. All these negative thoughts and pressures subsequently lead to suicidal thoughts. Statistics on suicidal thoughts due to body image revealed that about 10% of women have hurt themselves because of body dissatisfaction, and about 13% of adults have developed suicidal thoughts and feelings after going into a long-distressed state.\n\nTeenagers are hugely affected by the persuasive beauty standards around the world. The mental health foundation confirmed that one in eight adults in the UK had developed the idea of suicide due to body dissatisfaction.\n\nBeauty standards around the world will continue to evolve, and the world will constantly revolve around new generations. New values will be inherited in society as societal standards progress. But accepting the quixotic standards set by society is like disregarding your self-love and confidence for those toxic norms of beauty.\n\nAll humans have flaws that are seemingly beautiful in their ways. A beautiful appearance may betray many, but only a beautiful heart defines real beauty. True beauty lies in accepting yourself.\n\nEvery woman must recognize that the feminine beauty ideal is not the true definition of beauty. They are temporary and continue to fluctuate. Wearing makeup and making bodily changes would give boldness to a woman, but only to a certain extent. The more natural, the more comfortable.\n\nAlmost all of us have come across people saying these phrases: “You have got acne,” “you look dark,” ‘why are you so fat’ or ‘you are too skinny to look attractive’\n\nNext time, never forget to remind them that beauty does not form a beautiful character."
