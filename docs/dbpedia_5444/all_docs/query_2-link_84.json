Have an account? .\n\nHere are 25 films to watch after going through a breakup.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Someone Great\" tracks the aftermath of an abrupt breakup.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 83%\n\nAfter Jenny (Gina Rodriguez) lands her dream job across the country, her boyfriend of nine years (Lakeith Stanfield) breaks up with her. With hilarious friends Erin (DeWanda Wise) and Blair (Brittany Snow) by her side, Jenny struggles to make sense of the breakup and her impending move from New York City.\n\nThe Netflix original doesn't take itself too seriously, weaving in laughs between painfully raw flashbacks of Jenny's former relationship, but it does capture the confusion and loss that comes with an abrupt split.\n\n\"Someone Great\" is a new type of breakup film, challenging its viewers to appreciate the lessons they learned from their exes, rather than to hate them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo people erase their memories of each other in \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 92%\n\nHave you ever been so angry with someone that you wish you never met them? In the 2004 film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) and Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) are so fed up with their fights that each of them hires a firm to permanently erase all their memories of their relationship.\n\nWhen they unintentionally meet up after their procedures, they're immediately drawn to each other without realizing that they've dated in the past. Their files are eventually leaked from the firm, and they have to decide whether or not they should stay broken up or try to build a new relationship together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Under the Tuscan Sun\" proves that healing can happen in unlikely places.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 62%\n\nThe 2003 film is based on the memoir of the same name written by Frances Mayes. After a San Francisco-based journalist learns that her husband has been cheating on her with a much younger woman, Frances (Diane Lane) falls into a deep depression. In an effort to make her feel better, her friends gift her a trip to Italy.\n\nWhile she's on the trip, she capriciously buys a neglected villa in the remote countryside and begins to renovate. Along the way, she meets new friends, faces new challenges on her own, and begins to process her divorce.\n\nUplifting and filled with corny laughs, \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" shows that with the right mindset, breakups can lead to new adventure.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman seeks revenge after she's attacked in her wedding dress in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 85%\n\nIn Quentin Tarantino's 2003 action film \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1,\" The Bride (Uma Thurman) seeks revenge on her former boss and lover after he tried to kill her at her wedding.\n\nFilled with high-energy fight scenes, \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\" is a comeback story that's guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFour high schoolers team up on their ex-boyfriend in \"John Tucker Must Die.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 28%\n\nWhat happens when three high school girls find out that they're all dating the same boy? They hatch a plan for a fourth girl to break his heart.\n\nIn the 2006 film \"John Tucker Must Die,\" the unlikely squad of Kate (Brittany Snow), Heather (Ashanti), Beth (Sophia Bush), and Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) desperately want revenge on the most popular boy in school, John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe).\n\nAnd while the romantic comedy shows just how messy breakups can be, it also shows that some people never change — no matter how many humiliating pranks you try to pull on them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA woman with a seemingly perfect life breaks up with her boyfriend in the 2018 film \"Nappily Ever After\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 67%\n\nViolet (Sanaa Lathan) seems to have it all: a great job, a steady relationship, and gorgeous hair. After her boyfriend Clint (Ricky Whittle) doesn't propose to her, she breaks up with him and sees him with a new woman shortly after.\n\nIn a tale of reinvention and self-discovery based on the book by Trisha R. Thomas, Violet shaves her head and begins to question what it takes to make herself truly happy, independent of what others think.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA dumpee schools her ex-boyfriend in \"Legally Blonde.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 71%\n\nAfter her boyfriend breaks up with her before leaving for Harvard Law School, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) decides to follow him there, confident that they'll rekindle as classmates.\n\nThe sorority president is accepted to the elite law school, only to find that her ex has a new fiancé. In response, Woods dives headfirst into her coursework, determined to prove herself as a top student.\n\nUnapologetically herself despite numerous barriers standing in her way, Elle proves her critics wrong and emerges from her breakup stronger than ever in \"Legally Blonde.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA man realizes that he's glorified his ex in \"500 Day of Summer.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 85%\n\nThe 2009 film follows Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), an architect-turned-greeting card writer who immediately falls hard for Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). \"500 Days of Summer\" launches into a non-linear timeline of their relationship, with Tom playing out their conversations, dates, and time spent together in the aftermath of having his heart broken by Summer.\n\nConfused and struggling with depression following the breakup, Tom realizes that he's only been remembering the positive aspects of their relationship and decides to turn his life around.\n\nAn emotional roller-coaster, \"500 Days of Summer\" doesn't sugarcoat the pain that comes at the end of a relationship, but it does give you permission to look back if it will allow you to move forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Break-Up\" is difficult to watch, but it holds an important message.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 34%\n\nAfter buying a condominium together, Gary Grobowski (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke Meyers (Jennifer Aniston) call it quits on their relationship. Neither of them wants to move out of the space, so they agree to coexist as roommates — until they pester each other so much that they sell the condo.\n\nBetween last-minute efforts to save their relationship to moments of acceptance, the 2006 film \"The Break-Up\" proves that even the most complicated, painful endings don't have to remain nasty forever.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"La La Land\" will both break your heart and give you hope.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\n\nIn the 2016 Oscar-winning musical \"La La Land,\" Mia (Emma Stone) plays a struggling actress who meets a nostalgic jazz musician named Sebastian (Ryan Gosling). Both trying to make it in Los Angeles, they start a relationship, which is shot in scenes and musical numbers reminiscent of the \"Singin' in the Rain\" and \"An American in Paris\" era of film.\n\nEventually, their wildest dreams come to fruition, and they must reckon with the decision to either pursue their careers or stay together.\n\nAnd despite the heartbreak in the latter half of the film, \"La La Land\" is a testament to appreciating the person who was once in your life — even if the relationship doesn't last past the closing epilogue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Midsommar\" is a breakup movie shrouded in horror.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 83%\n\nAfter Dani (Florence Pugh) loses her family in a tragic accident, she decides to join her increasingly-distant boyfriend Christian (Jack Reynor) and his friends to attend a remote festival called Midsommar in a Swedish village.\n\nThe trip turns sinister as the visitors realize that they're trapped by a cult, and each of them has an involuntary role to play in the festival. Dani, who leaned on Christian after her loss despite his veering attention, eventually pulls the plug on her relationship.\n\nA horror film filled its fair share of gore and stomach-turning moments, \"Midsommar\" ultimately shows that a bad breakup can feel as final as death.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Call Me by Your Name\" artfully captures a summer romance.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 94%\n\nBased on the 2007 novel of the same name by André Aciman, \"Call Me by Your Name\" follows 17-year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) and 24-year-old Oliver (Armie Hammer) as they form feelings for one another during a summer spent in rural Italy.\n\nTheir secret relationship plays out in a series of scenes that look more like watercolor paintings than real-life moments: scenic bike rides, afternoons reading in the sun, and hikes through waterfalls.\n\nThe summer eventually comes to an end, and they must part ways as Oliver returns to graduate school in the United States.
