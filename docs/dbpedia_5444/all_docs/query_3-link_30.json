        "text": "Today, research has suggested that women are significantly less likely to make the news compared to men. In the most recent report published by the Global Media Monitoring Project (GMMP), the largest and longest running research on gender in the worldâs news media, women were found to make up just 24% of news subjects and sources reported. According to this report, this number has not changed since 2010.\n\nIn the context of news, headlines introduce, frame and contextualize a news story. Furthermore, research within the fields of educational and experimental psychology has demonstrated that news headlines can have a disproportionate impact on the readerâs mind, and that misleading headlines can bias readers toward a specific interpretation.\n\nSo, if women are underrepresented in the news to begin with, what does it look like when women do make headlines? And how have headlines about women changed over time?\n\nTo explore these questions, we have visualized the language used in women-centered headlines and how this language has (or has not) changed over time. Using keywords associated with the word âwomanâ (like girl, mother and lady), we collected and analyzed 382,139 headlines published between 2005 and 2021 by the top English-language news publications and news agencies in four countries: The United States of America (US), India, South Africa, and the United Kingdom (UK). A total of 186 publications were considered (i.e. 24 publications in South Africa, 51 publications in India, 57 publications in the UK, and 54 publications in the US).\n\nHereâs how polarizing headlines are\n\nUsing data from SimilarWeb we then tied the monthly viewership of every publication to the average polarity score of their women-centered headlines. While all outlets sensationalize their news to some extent, news outlets on the left end of the spectrum (i.e. less sensational) tend to be the ones who focus on either financial news, like Bloomberg in the United States and LiveMint in India, or on tech news, such as TechRadar and CNET. Nature, a predominantly scientific publication, is the least sensational but it also has a more limited reach.\n\nBBC and The New York Times are the largest publications with the least sensational headlines compared to the Daily Mail, Huffington Post, Fox News or Aaj Tak who publish more shock value headlines.\n\nHover on each of the bubbles and see the headlines for yourself.\n\nFilter by\n\nFilter by country Filter by publication\n\nNews outlets arranged by polarity score\n\nâ Less Polarizing\n\nMore Polarizing â\n\nRead more about our polarity calculations\n\nWe measure polarity by performing sentiment analysis on each headline using the Vader python package, where each headline gets a sentiment score from -1 to 1 (from more negative to more positive). Because we are interested in polarity, we take the absolute value of each headline's score.\n\nHereâs how biased headlines are\n\nWhile the theme of crime and violence got us delving into how sensational women-centered headlines are, the theme of gendered language led to the idea of measuring bias.\n\nExplicit use of gendered language in English â words like âactress,â âcongresswomanâ or âlandladyâ â emphasizes the gender of the subject when there is no need to do so. Research from Yasmeen Hitti et al. has suggested that both gendered language and words that reinforce societal and behavioral stereotypes, such as âbeautiful,â âemotional,â âsupportiveâ or âdramatic,â add to the bias of a sentence. Using their research methodology, we attributed a bias score to each headline.\n\nFor example, the headline that reads âDaughter in emotional meeting with woman given life back by selfless courage of her dead motherâ gets a higher bias score than the headline that reads âHillary Clinton speaks out for the same American values upheld in retracted embassy statement.â In the chart below, we visualize this bias index for each publication. In contrast to our results for polarity, there is a greater variance in bias scores across publications. The Daily Mail scores the highest while the BBC and ESPN are among those who score the lowest.\n\nGo ahead, hover on the bubbles and see for yourself if you think these headlines are extremely gendered.\n\nNews outlets arranged by bias index\n\nâ Less Biased\n\nMore Biased â\n\nRead more about our bias calculations\n\nWe measure gender bias by tracking the combined occurrence of gendered language and social stereotypes usually associated with women. We do this in two steps:\n\n1) We check if a headline contains gendered language (i.e. âspokeswoman,â âchairwoman,â âshe,â âher,â âbride,â âdaughter,â âdaughters,â âfemale,â âfiancee,â âgirl,â âgirlfriendâ etc.).\n\n2) If it contains gendered language, we then count the number of words that are considered to be social stereotypes about women (i.e. âweak,â âmodest,â âvirgin,â âslut,â âwhore,â âsexy,â âfeminine,â âsensitive,â âemotional,â âgentle,â âsoft,â âpretty,â âbitch,â âsexualâ etc.).\n\nFinally, we normalize this count for all headlines within each outlet as a score between 0 and 1, and we aggregate (i.e. average) this score for each outlet.\n\nHeadline trends: Less gendered language. More empowering words.\n\nIn this final chart, we have visualized how the words used in headlines about women have changed over time.\n\nAmong other trends that can be observed from this chart, we found that while the use of many gendered words (e.g.âsexy,â âfat,â âhousewifeâ or âgossipâ) has faded out over time, the use of empowering words has increased over time (e.g. âfounder,â âactivist,â âleaderâ or âappointâ). Other words (e.g. âdeath,â âhurt,â and âdramaâ) have instead stood the test of time, as their use has remained consistent since 2005.\n\nFor each wordâs ebb or flow, we tried to find a âremember whenâ memory to explain it. Remember when Caitlyn Jenner came out as transgender? That was part of a wave of increased trans visibility that helps to explain why âtransgenderâ shot up in 2015. Remember when the #MeToo movement took off? That adds context to the sharp rise of âharassmentâ in 2017, and the sharp rise of the word âequalityâ in recent years. Such world events are arranged as bubbles in the timeline above the chart.\n\nIf you see an interesting rise, hover over one such bubble to see if you can find a world event that can explain it. If you think that weâve missed out on an important event in your part of the world, let us know.\n\nMethods\n\nTo build the dataset of headlines, we scraped data from Google News, using RapidAPI, from the most visited publications and news agencies for readers in the US, the UK, India and South Africa according to SimilarWeb (as of 2021-06-06). To collect this data, we queried RapidAPI for headlines containing one or more of the following keywords: women, woman, girl, female, lady, ladies, she, her, herself, aunt, grandmother, mother, sister, daughter, wife, mom, mum, girlfriend, mrs, niece. As a result, our analysis encompasses 24 publications in South Africa (18,594 headlines), 51 publications in India (138,590 headlines), 57 publications in the United Kingdom (109,286 headlines), and 54 publications in the United States (115,669 headlines).\n\nGendered language and bias calculation: To categorize words used in headlines as gendered, we manually curated two dictionaries â gendered words about women (words that are explicitly gendered in the English language, such as âactress,â âwaitress,â âcongresswoman,â âlandladyâ or âmotherâ) and words that denote societal and behavioral stereotypes about women (words like âbeautiful,â âsexy,â âpregnant,â or âemotionalâ). This was curated using existing research from Huimin Xu and team, published under the title âThe Cinderella Complex: Word embeddings reveal gender stereotypes in movies and booksâ and the incredible research done by The Swaddle team. These dictionaries can be found here. The methodology used to calculate bias was borrowed from the research done by Yasmeen Hitti and team, published under the title âProposed Taxonomy for Gender Bias in Text.â\n\nTheme dictionaries: To categorize words used in headlines as part of a theme (i.e. crime and violence, empowerment, race, ethnicity and identity, people and places) we manually curated four dictionaries. These dictionaries can be found here. In cases where a word had more than one contextual usage (like âheadâ or âchairâ), we only classified them inside a theme if they belonged to that theme in no less than 90% of the cases. To analyze words and textual elements found in headlines, we used existing Natural Language Processing packages for Python (i.e. spacy, gensim, word2number, pycontractions, bs4, unidecode, textblob, nltk).\n\nPolarity analysis: To analyze the polarity of each headline we used vaderSentiment. For the comparison of polarity between women-centered headlines and all other headlines, we scraped headlines using no keyword tags from the most visited publications and news agencies from readers in the US, the UK, India and South Africa according to SimilarWeb (as of 2021-06-06). With the use of such data, we were able to calculate baseline polarity scores for each news publication and news agency. Though constituting a representative sample of headlines, the number of headlines we used to calculate this baseline polarity is roughly equal to one third of the number of headlines that we used to calculate polarity for women-centered headlines.\n\nWith regards to the stacked bar chart (in the scrollytelling section), there were far more than 1,231 unique words in the original dataset. For visual and readability purposes, however, we only retained the 1,231 words that were most frequent and that were common across the four countries studied.\n\nAll of the data used for this essay is available in this Github repo.\n\nWe collaborated with Jan Diehm, Rob Smith, Russell Samora, and Michelle McGhee for the piece and weâre quite grateful and happy for how it turned out!"
