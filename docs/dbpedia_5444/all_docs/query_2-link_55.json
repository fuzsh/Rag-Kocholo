        "text": "Meet the women who helped create a thriving society where equality prevails. Inspirational women of today are going further, doing more, breaking through barriers and giving people courage. Women may only occupy 0.5% of history books, according to Dr Nina Ansary, but the outstanding women in this list are transforming our futures.\n\nHere at The Motivational Speakers Agency, we have assembled a list of great women from a wide range of industries, who have broken glass ceilings and motivated many - taking inspiration from the exclusive selection of the 15 Official Best Motivational Speakers to Hire in the UK. Many of these women are also established and impactful public speakers, who tour the world to share their important message of female empowerment. If you want to book any of the fantastic female speakers featured in this post, head to our contact section and get in touch today!\n\nIn no particular order, here are 50 of the most inspirational women of the 21st century who are changing the world today.\n\n1. Malala Yousafzai\n\n“I tell my story not because it is unique, but because it is the story of many girls.”\n\nMalala Yousafzai is the youngest Nobel Prize laureate the world has ever seen. This incredible woman overcame an assassination attempt by the Taliban in occupied Pakistan at the age of fifteen, to campaign for women’s rights and children’s rights to an education.\n\nTo advocate in an area where the Taliban pose a serious threat makes her a contemporary heroine. Yousafzai has fought life and limb for what she believes in.\n\n2. Karren Brady\n\n“As long as you like yourself, as long as your family like you, as long as you are good at what you do, your staff respect you, and your board have trust in you, that's what is important.”\n\nKnown as the first lady of football, Karren Brady has worked in the beautiful game for over 20 years. Joining Birmingham City as their Managing Director in 1993, she encountered a devastating amount of sexism during her time in the role, something she often discusses at her speaking events.\n\nA strong campaigner for women in business, Brady can discuss this topic which is close to her heart, encouraging women to pursue a business career.\n\n3. Phoebe Schecter\n\n\"I never really thought of myself as being the ‘only female’. I think we really need to remove that mindset from the situation because otherwise, we're always going to be singling ourselves out. Mentally, that can play mind games with you.\"\n\nBritain's first female NFL coach, Phoebe Schecter, is an inspiring sportswoman. She joined the Buffalo Bills as their Coaching Intern, before being appointed the Tight Ends Coach for the successful American Football team. Continuing her incredibly successful career, Phoebe was later named the Community & Grassroots Project Manager for NFL UK.\n\nFrom such influential positions, Phoebe has changed the face of American Football. She continues to inspire budding female coaches across the globe, proving that a male-dominated environment is just lacking female influence.\n\n4. Michelle Obama\n\n“Friendships between women, as any woman will tell you, are built of a thousand small kindnesses... swapped back and forth and over again.”\n\nAmerican lawyer and writer, Michelle Obama, became a source of inspiration to millions in the US when she became the first African American First Lady of the United States in 2009, during Barack Obama’s eight-year presidential reign.\n\nHer impact was felt so strongly that she has become a role model for women across the globe, and a leading advocate for health, wellbeing and education.\n\n5. Indra Nooyi\n\n“If you don’t give people a chance to fail, you won’t innovate. If you want to be an innovative company allow people to make mistakes.”\n\nThe Board Director of Amazon and a regular keynote speaker at World Economic Forums, Indra Nooyi has earned a spot on the Forbes list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.\n\nKnowledgeable, experienced and a top-level Director, she is a must-have authority at international conventions.\n\n6. Melinda Gates\n\n“All women, everywhere, have the same hopes: we want to be self-sufficient and create better lives for ourselves and our loved ones.”\n\nAmerican philanthropist and wife of Microsoft owner, Bill Gates, Melinda Gates has become one of the most powerful women in the world, due to her efforts to support areas of society in desperate need of help or remodelling.\n\nTogether with Bill Gates, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama for their extraordinary efforts.\n\n7. Madonna\n\n“I am because we are. We all bleed the same color. We all want to love and be loved.”\n\nMadonna is known as the Queen of Pop. She has broken records in the music industry on her way to becoming one of the most powerful women on the planet. Her sheer drive and unprecedented success have seen her lauded as “America’s smartest businesswoman” and one of the biggest influences on contemporary pop music.\n\nAs a result, Madonna is a true tour-de-force of the entertainment industry. Not only that, but Madonna is also an international ambassador for feminism, freedom and equality.\n\n8. Angela Merkel\n\n“When it comes to human dignity, we cannot make compromises.”\n\nThe Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel remains one of the foremost figureheads in global politics. An expert in a range of fields, Merkel is often described as the 'most powerful woman in the world'.\n\nThe longest-serving leader in the European Union and one of the most inspirational female speakers in the world, Merkel's influence is indisputable.\n\n9. Joanna Lumley\n\n“I've looked forward to being older because you will have that many more miles covered. We mustn't be led into thinking getting old is bad. Growing old is good.”\n\nJoanna Lumley's role as Patsy Stone in hit British sitcom Absolutely Fabulous endeared her to television viewers across the country.\n\nHer true-to-life, rebellious yet charming attitude may have made her a television star, but it is her work as a human rights activist, not least during the Gurkha Justice Campaign, that has earned her a place on this list, and more importantly a charming status as the 'Daughter of Nepal'.\n\n10. Emma Gonzalez\n\n“We are going to be the kids you read about in textbooks. Not because we're going to be another statistic about mass shooting in America, but because, just as David said, we are going to be the last mass shooting.”\n\nWhen her school was invaded by a gunman who killed many of her friends, she stood up to let the world know that she and her classmates demanded change. She brought the world to tears with one of the most courageous speeches of our time.\n\nStill leading the fight, with her dedicated team, against gun laws, Emma Gonzalez will not be going away anytime soon.\n\n11. Queen Elizabeth II\n\n“The upward course of a nation's history is due in the long run to the soundness of heart of its average men and women.”\n\nHRM was the youngest monarch in history when she took to the throne and is now the longest-reigning monarch of all time. Having seen 13 Prime Ministers come and go since her 1952 coronation, Queen Elizabeth II is highly respected due in some part to her astonishing status as the world’s oldest ruling monarch.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II has become a mainstay of British culture and will remain a hallmark of history.\n\n12. Linda Cruse\n\n“It is time to flip our traditional model of social change right on its head.”\n\nSir Richard Branson once stated: “Linda Cruse makes the impossible, possible”. There a few testimonials with as much weight as one from the multi-billionaire philanthropist but Linda Cruse deserves it.\n\nShe has been changing lives with programmes designed to support communities and businesses. This modern-day Mother Theresa is no doubt one of the finest humanitarians in the world today.\n\n13. Fiona Bruce\n\n“If I were to say anything to my 18-year-old self, it would be, ‘Loosen up. Chill out.’”\n\nYou may know her name from her presentation of the BBC News at Six, Crimewatch or the Antiques Roadshow but there is more behind the scenes to Fiona Bruce. She has become an outspoken feminist, has worked with many charities like Women's Aid and NSPCC.\n\nThe latter even inducted the newsreader into their Hall of Fame thanks to her hard work for the charity. In 2019 she made her debut as the new presenter of Question Time, drawing praise from critics for her expert handling of the show, after taking charge of the prestigious current affairs show when David Dimbleby retired.\n\n14. Jane Goodall\n\n“We can move toward a world where we live in harmony with nature. Where we live in harmony with each other. No matter what nation we come from. No matter what our religion. No matter what our culture. This is where we’re moving towards.”\n\nBritish national treasure and the world's first chimpanzee expert, Jane Goodall is a force of nature.\n\nHer conservation and environmental work, as well as her work as one of the leading primatologists, brought her a long string of awards including a UN Messenger in Peace award and a Benjamin Franklin Medal in Life Science.\n\n15. Randi Zuckerberg\n\n“This is a new world we live in, and it should be possible for a woman to be taken seriously and still do what she loves.”\n\nWhen your brother is the creator of the biggest social media platform of our time, Facebook – it would be easy to fade into obscurity. Not Randi Zuckerberg. After becoming one of the powerhouses of the marketing team at Facebook, she founded Zuckerberg Media, working with Fortune 500 companies like Paypal and Conde Naste.\n\nShe still found time to become a New York Times best-selling author and feature on television coverage of the US midterm elections which earned her an Emmy Award in 2011.\n\n16.

Oprah Winfrey\n\n“Challenges are gifts that force us to search for a new center of gravity. Don’t fight them. Just find a new way to stand.”\n\nWhat superlatives haven’t been used to describe Oprah Winfrey? America’s sweetheart overcame a background shrouded in poverty and abuse to become the biggest name in entertainment. A tireless activist, campaigner and television host, the superstar became the richest African American of the 20th Century. She was also the youngest female billionaire in history.\n\nToday she is a respected philanthropist and recently received worldwide acclaim for her passionate, inspirational #MeToo speech.

Emma Watson\n\n“If you truly pour your heart into what you believe in, even if it makes you vulnerable, amazing things can and will happen.”\n\nIt was always going to take some doing to come out of the spotlight of her fame as Hermione Granger in the hit film adaptation of the Harry Potter series. Emma Watson showed the resilience and talent to do so, making herself an icon through her work as an actress, model and activist.\n\nThe star has had no end of successes in film and fashion as well as being chosen as the Woman of the Year by British GQ in 2013. She was appointed as a UN Women Goodwill ambassador in 2014, reflecting her assiduous campaigning.\n\n19. Jo Salter\n\n“Inclusive leadership for me is really about understanding the people that you are working with and coming to them with a humility that respects who they are and what they bring to the team.\"\n\nJo Salter made history when she became the first British woman to pilot a fast jet, the Panavia Tornado.

Her Academy Award-winning film, The Hurtlocker is one of many of her successes. She is a leading luminary in showbiz and one of the most influential women today.\n\n22. Sheryl Sandberg\n\n“Taking initiative pays off. It is hard to visualize someone as a leader if she is always waiting to be told what to do.”\n\nA key player in the technology sector, Sheryl Sandberg is the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Facebook.\n\nThe first woman to serve on the board for the social platform’s team, she was inducted into a list of Most Influential People in the World by Time magazine in 2012 and has gone on to be worth well over a billion.\n\n23.
