        "text": "If you’ve been run off your feet all week, a Girls’ Night In movie night – complete with a pile of blankets, snacks and your besties – is the only answer.\n\nSo, call up your friends, get your snacks in order and spend a night in. You can donate what you would have spent on a night out, to vital work in prevention, education and research into women’s cancers.\n\nYou don’t even have to stress about choosing what to watch…we’ve rounded up 30 flicks that practically require you to view them in the presence of your favourite gal pals.\n\nFrom love stories to hilarious flicks, these movies will help you ease into the weekend—with your BFFs by your side. Plus, you’ve likely seen them before, so you can catch up on what’s been happening in each other’s lives without worrying about missing plot clues.\n\nMy Best Friend’s Wedding\n\nThe unrequited love and heartbreak tugs at your heart strings.\n\n27 Dresses\n\nAlways a bridesmaid, never a bride – so relatable. This is the perfect movie to get in the mood if you’ve got a big wedding season ahead.\n\nThe Notebook\n\nThis might be the most romantic movie of all time. The love triangle. The old couple reminiscing. Make sure to have some tissues on hand\n\nDear John\n\nAgain with the tears. Who doesn’t love a chick flick with Channing Tatum?\n\nLove Actually\n\nNothing really needs to be said here…apart from, why wait until Christmas to watch this gem?!\n\nBridesmaids\n\nWhat goes better together than love and comedy? Everyone wants to be the maid of honour.\n\nClueless\n\nAs if! Get into 90s nostalgia with Cher and her friends, who have the ridiculous outfits and hilarious one-liners to lift your mood.\n\nThe Devil Wears Prada\n\nNeed a little motivation to follow your dreams? New jobs are always interesting…and the fashion alone makes this movie worth a watch.\n\nThe Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants\n\nThere is nothing more awesome than watching four best friends going on adventures and generally being there for each other.\n\nEver After\n\nWe all love a movie that ends with happily ever after.\n\nCrazy Stupid Love\n\nDivorce, new relationships, Ryan Gosling – it has it all!\n\nPitch Perfect\n\nFrom the singing to the non-stop jokes, this is one flick you can’t watch too many times. You could even have a Lip Sync Battle to the songs!\n\nDirty Dancing\n\nWho wouldn’t want to spend summer at a resort with a gorgeous dance instructor?\n\nMean Girls\n\nSome of the mean girl moments are out of control, but it’s the only flick that includes “mathletes”, puking on a crush, and a person getting hit by a bus and still making it to prom.\n\nLegally Blonde\n\nSure, a bit ditzy – but #girlpower. You can’t beat a plot line focused on a woman smashing everyone’s expectations.\n\n10 Things I Hate About You\n\nBased on Shakepeare’s ‘Taming of the Shrew’ and featuring Heath Ledger, this movie is sweet, funny and “just too good to be true”.\n\nFriends with Benefits\n\nAttractive actors, a typical romcom story line and a happy, sappy ending. The complete chick flick package.\n\nBridget Jones’ Diary\n\nWatching Bridget may help you realise how much you *actually* do have your life together. And, who doesn’t love Hugh Grant?\n\nLetters to Juliet\n\nA modern twist on the timeless classic.\n\nMy Big Fat Greek Wedding\n\nAwkward in all the right ways. A classic comedy and chick flick. Plus, you can watch the sequel afterwards!\n\nMamma Mia\n\nGet ready to bust out some tunes.\n\nNotting Hill\n\nWe all wish we were dating a movie star. Another Hugh Grant classic.\n\nPretty in Pink\n\nWhen in doubt, break out a classic.\n\nSweet Home Alabama\n\nNo one forgets their first love.\n\nThe Vow\n\nRachel McAdams does it again.\n\nTwo Weeks’ Notice\n\nHugh Grant again…well, he was the rom com king. Opposites attract in this cute flick.\n\nThe Holiday\n\nJude Law brings the accent, while Jack Black brings the humour. Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz as the female leads – #winning.\n\nLeap Year\n\nBased off an old Irish folklore tradition where a woman can propose to a man on a leap day. It’s quite a predictable movie but it will definitely make you go ‘aww!’\n\nNo Reservations\n\nWarning: You may have to fill up with the popcorn, with all the food shots in this film. The plot is based on Kate, a chef who struggles with life after learning she’s the guardian of her late sister’s daughter, until Nick, who’s personality is the complete opposite, comes into the picture.\n\nThe Proposal\n\nWitty and adorable.\n\nExcited to have a movie night?\n\nJoin women across the state who will host or attend a Girls’ Night In this year! Whether it’s an intimate evening with your besties or an online gathering, we know it’ll be a blast!\n\nAll funds raised will be invested in vital cancer research, patient support services and prevention programs for women affected by breast and gynaecological cancers.\n\nWhen you register, you’ll receive a free host kit to help you get the party started."
