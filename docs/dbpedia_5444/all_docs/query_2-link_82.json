        "text": "Some movies are remembered for their incredible endings and others for their to-die-for costumes. But nothing beats an unforgettable movie couple.\n\nClassics like Titanic, Dirty Dancing and Pretty Woman have introduced us to swoon-worthy romantic leads (and taught us a thing or two about how to navigate our own relationships). Of course, these examples only scratch the surface when it comes to standout on-screen romances. Keep reading for 40 of the best movie couples of all time.\n\nRELATED\n\n70 of the Best Romantic Movies of All Time\n\nVestron Pictures\n\n1. Baby And Johnny (dirty Dancing)\n\nLike we’d ever put these two in a corner…\n\nRELATED\n\nThe 29 Most Iconic Summer Movies\n\n2. Tony And Maria (west Side Story)\n\nTheir tragic romance always tugs at the heartstrings—but it comes as no surprise, given that their story took inspiration from Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet.\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n3. Quincy And Monica (love & Basketball)\n\nChildhood BFFs and aspiring athletes, Quincy (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa Lathan), develop romantic feelings for each other as they grow older and pursue their careers. But even as their success threatens the future of their relationship, it doesn’t change their off-the-charts chemistry.\n\nLionsgate Films Inc.\n\n4. Katniss And Peeta (the Hunger Games Series)\n\nNo disrespect to fans who are #TeamGale, but it’s impossible to watch the films and not see that these two belong together. (Need proof? Watch this scene.)\n\nLoew's Inc.\n\n5. Rhett And Scarlett (gone With The Wind)\n\nWe think of their relationship as a sort of Kim-Kanye situation: They’re both kinda kooky, but it works.\n\nRELATED\n\nThe Ultimate Fall 2017 Movie Guide\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n6. Sandy And Danny (grease)\n\nDo we love that Sandy totally changed herself for a guy? No. Can we recreate the entire “You’re the One That I Want” choreo from memory? Proudly.\n\nTouchstone PIctures\n\n7. Vivian And Edward (pretty Woman)\n\nNot including these two would’ve been a big mistake…huge.\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\n8. Darius And Nina (love Jones)\n\nA chance encounter at a Chicago club leads to a casual fling between these two creatives. It doesn't take long for them to realize that they might have something more.\n\nAct III Communications\n\n9. Westley And Buttercup (the Princess Bride)\n\nAny guy who’s willing to put up with intense duels and torture chambers to win your heart is certainly a keeper. Princess Buttercup knows that all too well.\n\nSunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images\n\n10. Princess Leia And Han Solo (star Wars)\n\nNo lie, these lovebirds shared some of the best scenes in this movie franchise, from Leia's brave profession of love (followed by Han's classic \"I know\") to that steamy first kiss on the Falcon.\n\nWild Bunch\n\n11. Adele And Emma (blue Is The Warmest Color)\n\nThink: Young love, with a whole bunch of twists.\n\nRonald Siemoneit/Sygma/via Getty Images\n\n12. Neo And Trinity (the Matrix)\n\nGet this: Their love for one another was so powerful that they brought each other back to life. If that's not true love, then we don't know what is.\n\n13. Peter And Lara Jean (to All The Boys I've Loved Before)\n\nWhat started as a silly ruse to make an ex jealous turned into a swoon-worthy high-school romance.\n\nSummit Entertainment\n\n14. Edward And Bella (twilight)\n\nWas their romance problematic? Definitely. But admit it, those dreamy romance scenes still gave you all the feels.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n15. Mark And Bridget (bridget Jones's Diary)\n\nYou know it's true love when your partner tries to convince you that your blue-colored soup is cool.\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n16. Gus And Hazel (the Fault In Our Stars)\n\nJohn Green's got a knack for crafting teen love stories that would make even Nicholas Sparks proud.\n\n17. Lois And Clark (superman)\n\nThere would be no Superman without Lois. There, we said it.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n18. Elizabeth And Mr. Darcy (pride & Prejudice)\n\nCan we agree that some of the best romances can come out of bitter rivalries?\n\nSummit Entertainment\n\n19. Mia And Sebastian (la La Land)\n\nMust they choose between love and their careers? Or is it possible to have it all? La La Land addresses these very questions as two ambitious artists (played by Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling) fall in love.\n\n20th Century Fox / Getty\n\n20. Romeo And Juliet (romeo + Juliet)\n\nWe know, we know. They both tragically die in the end. But if there’s one thing these star-crossed lovers got right, it’s that first loves can be seriously intense.\n\nWalt Disney Pictures\n\n21. Jasmine And Aladdin (aladdin)\n\nYes, we’re total suckers for fairytale romances. Especially when they include a feminist hero. *Cue “A Whole New World”*\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n22. Stella And Winston (how Stella Got Her Groove Back)\n\nAngela Bassett’s Stella Payne embarks on a journey of self-discovery as she travels to Jamaica and starts a whirlwind romance with Winston, a young islander who's 20 years younger.\n\nSony Pictures Classics\n\n23. Oliver And Elio (call Me By Your Name)\n\nIn this poignant story about first love, 17-year-old Elio (Timothée Chalamet) is smitten with a 24-year-old grad student, Oliver (Armie Hammer). If you’ve yet to see it, keep some tissues handy when you watch.\n\nMirror Releasing\n\n24. Tish And Fonny (if Beale Street Could Talk)\n\nBest friends turned lovebirds Tish (Kiki Layne) and Fonny (Stephan James) are thrown the ultimate curveball when Fonny gets wrongfully convicted of a crime in ’70s New York. Their story will send anyone on a rollercoaster of emotions.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n25. Queen And Slim (queen & Slim)\n\nDisclaimer: It’s not a run-of-the-mill love story. The two went from having a disastrous first date to bonding while on the run from police, which makes their relationship even more fascinating.\n\nWarner Bros. Pictures\n\n26. Ron And Hermione (harry Potter Series)\n\nWe certainly didn’t see this relationship coming (in fact, we were leaning more towards Harry and Hermione). But now that we look back, their romance makes total sense.\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\n27. Mary Jane And Peter (spider-man)\n\nPeter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) will go down in history as the couple who inspired us to try that infamous upside-down kiss.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n28. Joe And Kathleen (you've Got Mail)\n\nTom Hanks and Meg Ryan star as enemies-turned lovers in this charming tale, where they meet and fall for each other online.\n\nRelativity Media\n\n29. Jane And Jake Adler (it's Complicated)\n\nWe’ve seen plenty of examples of how rewarding love can be, but with Jane (Meryl Streep) and Jake’s (Alec Baldwin) on-and-off romance, we’re reminded that it’s often messy and complicated.\n\nMiramax Films\n\n30. Sara And Jonathan (serendipity)\n\nWhen Sara (Kate Beckinsale) and Jonathan (John Cusack) meet for the first time, sparks fly. But when they part ways, they leave it up to fate to bring them back together.\n\nColumbia PIctures\n\n31. Vada And Thomas J. (my Girl)\n\nWe’re not sobbing, you’re sobbing.\n\nColumbia PIctures\n\n32. Sally And Harry (when Harry Met Sally)\n\nHonestly, we were thisclose to going with Marie and Jess.\n\nRELATED\n\n40 Funny Lady Movies for When You Need a Good Laugh\n\n20th Century Fox\n\n33. Jane And John (mr. And Mrs. Smith)\n\nR.I.P. Brangelina. Your on-screen chemistry was super hot.\n\nRELATED\n\n40 Movies Every Woman Should See Before She’s 40\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n34. Ilsa And Rick (casablanca)\n\nBogart and Bergman were the heart eyes emoji before the heart eyes emoji existed.\n\nFocus Features\n\n35. Jack And Ennis (brokeback Mountain)\n\nWe can’t quit this movie.\n\nParamount PIctures\n\n36. Jack And Rose (titanic)\n\nWe’ll let it slide that there was definitely room for both of them on the door.\n\nMTV Films\n\n37. Sara And Derek (save The Last Dance)\n\nYes, it’s a predictable teen movie, but you’ll be rooting for Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas the whole damn time.\n\nRELATED\n\n11 Movies That Are Better Than the Books They’re Based On\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\n38.
