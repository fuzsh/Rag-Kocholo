        "text": "English Letters\n\nSpanish Letters\n\nLetter #1\n\nCopied\n\nEver since our first date, I've noticed changes in my world. Work at the office seems easier, and I'm getting more accomplished in less time. My boss has noticed the changes, too, and has been very complimentary of late.\n\nI continue to be pleasantly surprised as I discover more about you, yet there is still so much that I'd like to know. I get excited at the thought of spending more time with you because our time together will help me to learn more about you. Already, I'm learning that we have so much in common. I enjoy our differences, but I'm happy that we share so many similar opinions and experiences. Whatever differences exist can only broaden our horizons and our outlook on life.\n\nI've lost interest in seeing anyone else, Katie, because I'm falling in love with you!\n\nP.S. I hope we can get together Friday evening. I'll call you.\n\nLetter #2\n\nCopied\n\nIs it my imagination or am I getting smarter? I think the glow from your electric personality must be energizing my brain as well as my heart. I aced my statistics test on Monday--even after we were out so late on Sunday night. All the more surprising as your pretty face kept coming up between my calculator and all the formulas I had to deal with!\n\nI like to think I'm getting to know you better each time we go out, but the truth is you're still full of surprises. I didn't expect to hear that you not only studied German and Russian, but you aced a statistics course too! I'd really like to read the results of all your statistical tests in your thesis when you finish your first draft. And if you need any help, I'm your man! Stats is a language I'd be happy to converse in any time.\n\nThat's the great thing about this relationship--we have so many things in common, like politics and hiking (and statistics!), but each of us also has interests that are out of the other one's familiar world. This makes the time we spend together especially interesting and helps us widen our worlds a little, too. I was surprised to hear you had never played chess before, but you really showed a knack for it when we played together on Saturday night and you beat me! I demand a rematch! And I was amazed to learn about the importance of intonation in nonnative comprehension of English. I need another lesson, though, because I still don't understand the difference between segmentals and suprasegmentals!\n\nI hope you know how much I enjoy being with you. My feelings for you keep growing all the time. I've run into a few girls I've gone out with a few times before (before you!), but I'm really not interested anymore. I find myself thinking only about you (and less about statistics) and not wanting to see anyone else. I hope you're starting to feel the same way about me, too. Let's get together on Saturday evening--please tell me that's become our regular date night! I'm looking forward to another chess game with you as well as another lesson in phonology.\n\nWith love and anticipation...\n\nLetter #3\n\nCopied\n\nI wish I could really express the happiness I have found in spending time with you over the last few weeks. Getting to know you has brought a dimension to my life that it just never had before. Every time we are together, the world looks a little better and the sun shines a little brighter.\n\nI'm not exaggerating when I say that you're the kindest, most animated, and most amazing person I have ever met. The more I learn about you, the more I want to know. You're incredible! You have, in a way, changed the way I see the world. I am a better person, and I want to be an even better person, just because I have known you. I'm so glad that your love for humanity matches my own. I was serious about joining the Peace Corps, if you really want to go!\n\nIt's not just our desire to serve others, though. I love that you enjoy playing sports and spending time in the great outdoors as much as I do. I can't wait to do some hiking and backpacking together this summer. When are we going to take that trip down the Colorado that you talked about? I still can't believe you've already gone down it ten times, and yet you say that it's a new adventure each time. Well, that's how I feel every time that we go out together. Every day that I'm with you is full of bright hope and offers a new adventure.\n\nI can't wait to see you again. I hope you know how much you're starting to mean to me. The other girls I've dated in the past just fade in comparison. You're quickly becoming the only one for me. I hope that I will soon be the only one for you.\n\nLetter #4\n\nCopied\n\nBefore I met you, I had never taken much notice of flowers or dew or grass or birds. But this morning I walked outside, breathed in the crisp, spring air, sat quietly on the porch, and watched life happen. Then, when time forced me back into the real world, I arrived at work and tried to concentrate, but couldn't. When I looked at my computer screen, I saw your beautiful face and when I jotted notes, I found myself printing your name. Even when I broke for lunch, I remembered our date, the smell of your hair, your perfume, your playful laugh. Everywhere I looked, I remembered you!\n\nSince I met you, my world is coming alive. The more I get to know you the more I feel something warm and beautiful stirring within me. Is this feeling what poets have struggled to describe as love? All I know is that I feel happy and complete when I am with you. When we are apart, I am lethargic and unfocused. I find myself watching the clock as it ticks off the moments until we can be together again.\n\nI learn something new with every conversation. I am impressed that you can easily converse about Bach one moment and French cuisine in another. I was so pleased to learn that we share a common interest in educating children. I have often wondered if I was alone in my thinking, but you confirmed that these ideas might have real merit. That's just the point: you're full of surprises--I never know what new and wonderful thing I will learn when I'm with you.\n\nPlease pardon my awkward attempt at saying how much I treasure our growing relationship. I hope you feel the same way. The girls I've dated in the past are like vague memories. I've totally lost interest in anyone but you.\n\nI've planned a surprise for our date this Saturday night, but I'm only giving one hint--please wear a formal dress. That's all I'll say for now. I hope you can come. I'll call you tomorrow night.\n\nLetter #5\n\nCopied\n\nI know you are staying late at the office tonight, but I wanted to tell you about my incredible day. I thought a letter wouldn't disturb you too much. It seems there have been many reminders of you in the air today. It all started when I woke up early to go to aerobics. When the instructor began the warm-up music, what should I hear but Tiffany's \"I Think We're Alone Now.\" Because we talked about our mutual passion for '80s music last night, I thought of you immediately. I'm glad you have such great taste in music! I also remembered how you sang \"Love Shack\" in your car the first time we went out, and it got my heart rate up quickly this morning. I had an exceptional work out!\n\nLater, in the office, I received several comments from co-workers who told me that I have been particularly efficient and energetic since we started spending time together. I love being a hygienist and I was thrilled to find out that you have spent time in the dental field yourself. I am learning new things about you all the time. I think the excitement of my growing feelings for you has not only helped me at the office, but has also improved my outlook on life in general. You are on my mind constantly and my days are more fulfilling.\n\nWhen I stopped at a red light while I was on my lunch break, I found myself surrounded by a group of cyclists. I thought of you again! Normally I wouldn't have given them a second look, but now that you have taught me all kinds of new things about biking, I was much more interested in them. I pictured you riding along in your fluorescent yellow biking outfit. I love how you have many unique interests and that you are willing to share them with me. We are broadening each other's horizons as we spend more and more time together.\n\nAn old friend called me tonight asking if she could line me up with a guy she knows. Truthfully, the thought of spending time with anyone else didn't interest me. I quickly tried to think of an excuse to turn down my friend's suggestion because, after all, we haven't defined our relationship in terms of dating other people yet. I told her I couldn't be lined up with anyone right now because I'm seeing someone who is incredibly handsome. Do you like being with me as much as I like being with you? If so, should we consider only dating each other and seeing where our relationship could go?\n\nIt was funny how you made my day good, even though I didn't get to see you. It seemed like everything I heard and saw reminded me of you. I may be falling for you, Michael! We both deserve a break from work, so would you fall into my arms for a good movie tomorrow night? How about \"Lord of the Rings\"? Give me a call and we'll work out the details.\n\nI am still thinking of you.\n\nLetter #6\n\nCopied\n\nEver since I met you my life hasn't been the same. Knowing you is really bringing out the best in me and helping me to see the world through a rich, new lens. Although we have a lot in common, our differences are also important because they broaden our ranges of interest. Before I met you, I didn't think that classical music was something I could enjoy, but you showed me that I could and that has added a new dimension to my life. I've actually bought Handel's \"Music for the Royal Fireworks\" on CD to play in my car! I hope you are enjoying my \"Credence Clearwater Revival Greatest Hits\" CD as well! My boss has noticed the change in me, too. He tells me that I'm more energetic and that my work is more creative.\n\nI'm falling in love with you. Dating other girls seems useless now because I have found what I want. My day isn't complete anymore unless I've seen you or at least talked to you on the phone. Could we go out on Friday night and carry this relationship a step further? I think dinner and a movie would be a good place to start, don't you? I'll call you tomorrow and we'll work out the details.\n\nI miss you already.\n\nLetter #7\n\nCopied\n\nYou make me feel like singing--and I don't sing. You make me feel like dancing--even with my two left feet. When you're near me, my life is in focus. Everything I do is better because you believe in me. When the copy machine jams, I don't kick it anymore. When my computer crashes, I calmly reboot it without losing my temper. I even laughed today when the paper shredder jammed. My co-workers enjoy my new, relaxed attitude and send you their warmest regards!\n\nGetting to know you is such an exciting adventure. Your creative problem-solving continues to pleasantly surprise me. Most of all, I enjoy so many things about you--the way you always crinkle your nose when you smile, and how you tilt your head and lower your eyes when I tell you you're beautiful.\n\nDespite our individual natures, we seem to be cut from similar cloth. Most importantly, we share important values and beliefs. We have so much in common that we just feel right together. I love the fact that you follow a strong moral compass that always points you true North. Your strong personal standards are apparent in all that you do. These characteristics are important to me and serve as a strong foundation for our relationship.\n\nI'm beginning to feel that I'm learning so much since you've broadened my horizon. I've even started to gain a better appreciation of art and really enjoyed seeing your favorite museum last week and learning about modern art! Would you like to go to the Art Expo Friday night? You've got me anxious to see the \"surprise unveiling.\" Please be patient, though, my seventh grade art teacher described me as \"artistically challenged.\"\n\nI'm happy that you're letting me teach you the finer points of hockey, too. After the Art Expo, we could go to Calgary's playoff hockey game. I heard you cheering more loudly than I did when Conroy scored last game's winning goal! But when it comes right down to it, I'm happy going anywhere, so long as I'm with you.\n\nI've fallen head-over-heels for you, yet I've never felt firmer on my feet. There is no one else with whom I'd rather be. Our relationship offers me more than I could have ever imagined. It may sound corny, but it's true--you're the girl of my dreams.\n\nI'll call you Thursday to see if you're available. Please say, \"Yes.\"\n\nLetter #8\n\nCopied\n\nI've noticed something recently--I'm happy. My attitude at work has improved. My attitude about life has improved. I smile most of the time and sometimes I find myself humming as I walk down the street. Other people have noticed it too and asked me what's different now and what has made me so much happier. The answer? I can trace the change back to the time when I first met you.\n\nI love spending time with you. The more I learn about you, the more I want to be with you. You make me want to try new things. Who would ever have thought that I would try rock climbing? I'm usually afraid of heights and afraid of falling, and yet there I was, halfway up the side of a mountain and enjoying it. I hardly felt scared at all!\n\nWe're so different and yet we're so alike. You're an extrovert and I'm more of an introvert. You love doing adventurous outdoor activities, and I tend to be afraid of doing anything out of the ordinary. Our political differences may lead to some heated discussions, but we also complement each other in so many other ways. We have the same quirky sense of humor and the same desire to learn new things. And we respect each other's opinions, whether we agree with them or not. I think I could talk to you nonstop for a week and not run out of things to say!\n\nI think I'm falling in love with you. I don't have any desire to be with anyone else; I just want to be with you. I hope that we can continue down this path and see where it leads. I can't wait until our next date."
