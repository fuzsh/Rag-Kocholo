The ACLU Ambassador Project is an exciting next step in the ACLU's longtime collaboration with the entertainment community, in an effort to use celebrity for the greater good.\n\nThe ACLU Ambassador Project ties influential creative artists in film, television, music and comedy with public education and advocacy for key ACLU issues. Each Ambassador works with the ACLU on specific civil liberties issues, which include: immigrants’ rights, voting rights, rights of LGBTQ people and people living with HIV, women’s rights, abortion/reproductive rights, reducing mass incarceration, racial justice, and privacy and security."
