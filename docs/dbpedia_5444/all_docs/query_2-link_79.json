        "text": "Married: September 2012\n\nHathaway met Shulman, an actor-slash-jewelry-designer, at the Palm Springs Film Festival in 2008, through a mutual friend. Their chemistry was so apparent that Hathaway told her pal: I’m going to marry that man. “I think he thought I was a little nuts, which I am a bit, but I’m also nice,” Hathaway has said. “I knew from the second I met him that he was the love of my life.” While Shulman’s acting career hasn’t mirrored the same success as his wife’s, aside from a part in the 2015 Meryl Streep dramedy, Ricki and the Flash and producing Song One, which Hathaway also starred in, he has a jewelry line called James Banks. He even helped design Hathaway’s ethically sourced, six-carat diamond engagement ring when he proposed in 2011.\n\nJerry Seinfeld and Jessica Sklar\n\nMarried: December 1999\n\nSklar was a newlywed at the Reebok gym on the Upper West Side, wearing headphones and filling a water bottle when she met Seinfeld. “I was going through a difficult time, and I was approached by Jerry Seinfeld and he attempted to make me laugh, and I was really not interested in being entertained at that moment,” Sklar has said. “He came around again and said something funny, and I actually had to laugh.” At the time, Sklar was a PR executive for Tommy Hilfiger and had just married Eric Nederlander, the son of theater magnate Robert Nederlander, two months earlier. (When they were wed, guests’ invitations were styled after Playbills and indicated Sklar was “making her Broadway debut.”) Soon after meeting Seinfeld, Sklar broke things off with her marriage and became engaged to Seinfeld a year later, after he proposed at Soho’s Balthazar.\n\nReese Witherspoon and Jim Toth\n\nMarried: December 2014\n\nRedmayne and Bagshawe started out as friends. Redmayne was studying at Eton College, the English all-boys boarding school, while Bagshawe attended a neighboring boarding school for girls. When Bagshawe and her classmates organized a fashion show for charity, Redmayne volunteered to walk the runway. Shirtless. “I was this pasty, freckly guy and when I came on, the girls in the audience didn’t take much notice of me,” Redmayne later recalled. Someone did take notice, however, and so began the 12-year-long friendship: Redmayne caught glimpse of Bagshawe from across the room at an after-party: “She was very beautiful and very funny and she loves the arts and theater just as I do, so we became friends.” The actor and the former financial publicist began dating in 2012, before making their red carpet debut together that December at the London premiere of Les Misérables.\n\nPatrick Dempsey and Jillian Fink\n\nMarried: July 1999\n\nThe Grey’s Anatomy star found his match at Fink’s salon, Delux, in 1994. When the hairstylist noticed there was an appointment under the name “Patrick Dempsey,” she wrote it off as a joke. “I was shocked,” Fink said of her surprise when Patrick Dempsey himself came in for a trim. “But at the same time, I was happy because he was so cute.” Both were in relationships with other people, and it took three years of regular haircuts before the two got together.\n\nAlec Baldwin and Hilaria Thomas\n\nMarried: June 2012\n\nBaldwin and Thomas were first introduced in February 2011 at Pure Food and Wine, a since-closed vegan restaurant in Union Square. As Thomas recapped the event for the couple’s New York Times wedding announcement: “I was standing near the door with my friends when he walked up and took my hand and said, ‘I must know you.’ ” (The actor has since admitted his opening line was “none too clever.”) Thomas was 27 years old and working as an instructor at Yoga Vida, a studio she helped open upon graduating from NYU. “I saw right away that she was very dedicated,” Baldwin told the Times. “She’s the yoga queen of the Village.”\n\nVince Vaughn and Kyla Weber\n\nMarried: January 2010\n\nVaughn’s movie-producer friend reportedly introduced him to Weber at a wedding in 2008. A former Calgarian from rural Alberta, Weber was raised on a small farm in Blackie (population est. 400) and worked as a real estate agent. “Because she lived far away, at first I was nervous to date her because it’s one of my best friends’ wife’s best friend from childhood…. If it goes wrong, you’re talking about awkward,” Vaughn said during an appearance on Live! with Regis and Kelly. “She’s a civilian, which is good.” According to Vaughn, they started off by exchanging emails and phone calls, and they’ve been inseparable ever since.\n\nChristian Bale and Sibi Blazic\n\nMarried: January 2000\n\nBlazic was working as personal assistant to Winona Ryder when she met Bale, according to reports, at one of the actress’s barbecues. They later eloped in Las Vegas, and an Elvis impersonator reportedly officiated the marriage; Bale was 26 years old and Blazic was 30. When Bale won an Oscar for best actor in a supporting role for The Fighter, he told reporters: “I get choked up about that stuff…. [My wife] had to be married to so many different characters over our marriage. I know that it truly would be impossible to do it without her. She’s such a good, strong woman.” Case in point: The following year Blazic was a stunt driver in The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nPaul Rudd and Julie Yaeger\n\nMarried: February 2003\n\nAfter his breakout role in Clueless (1995), Rudd moved to New York and, on the advice of Amy Heckerling, the film’s director, got a publicist. When he arrived to the city, Rudd went straight to his publicist’s office, where Yaeger also worked as a publicist herself. As Rudd was late for an audition, Yaeger offered to drop Rudd’s bags at his friend’s apartment. A few days later, hardly knowing a single soul in Manhattan, he asked her out for lunch, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nGeorge Clooney and Amal Alamuddin\n\nMarried: September 2014\n\nLong considered one of Hollywood’s most infamous bachelors, Clooney fell in love with Lebanese-British human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin when a mutual friend brought her by his Lake Como home. After marrying Clooney in Venice in 2014, Alamuddin gave birth to a set of twins, Ella and Alexander, in 2017.\n\nJennifer Lawrence and Cooke Maroney\n\nMarried: October 2019\n\nLawrence and art dealer Cooke Maroney now epitomize power-couple style. The couple met through a mutual friend in 2018; one year later they got married at a 150-person ceremony in Rhode Island (to which the bride wore Dior of course).\n\nAmy Schumer and Chris Fischer"
