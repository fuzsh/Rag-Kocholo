        "text": "John Batiz recalled running into Jerry Roberts several weeks ago at the Creekbridge Safeway in Salinas.\n\nSmall talk turned to the topic of Matthew Roberts, the 70-year-old man’s son, Batiz said.\n\n“He told me he was having problems with his son,” Batiz said. “They would get into physical fights.”\n\nThat was the last time Batiz says he saw his former coworker, a Visalia native.\n\nJerry Roberts’ body was found decomposed Feb. 16 in a trailer on his Inglewood Street property, Police Cmdr. Vince Maiorana said. The 70-year-old suffered a broken neck at the time of his death, according to preliminary autopsy findings.\n\nSalinas police officers, including several veteran cops, responded about 9 p.m. to a call requesting a check on Roberts’ safety.\n\n“When an officer started walking around the premises he encountered a brief, quick smell, which he equated with death,” Maiorana said.\n\nInside the trailer, Salinas police made the grisly discovery, Maiorana said.\n\nLater that night, officers arrested 34-year-old Matthew Roberts, who has since been charged with murder and felony elder abuse. He’s being held at the Monterey County Jail on $1.5 million bail and awaiting formal arraignment. A subsequent probation violation case has also been filed. Bail was set at $10,000 last week in that misdemeanor case.\n\nInvestigators have pinpointed the last time Jerry Roberts was seen alive, but Maiorana said he won’t yet release that information. Neighbors told The Salinas Californian newspaper they had last seen Jerry Roberts a week or two before his body was discovered.\n\nThe cause and time of his death haven’t yet been confirmed.\n\n“The preliminary findings by the pathologist show he died of unnatural causes,” Maiorana said. “It was not falling down the stairs, an accidental death. This is death by another [person].”\n\nJerry Roberts was born in Visalia and graduated from Redwood High School there. He enlisted in the U.S. Army when he was 18 or 19 years old, a family member said. The family member, a Salinas resident, asked that her name be witheld, fearing she might be mobbed for information at work.\n\nWhile in the Army, Jerry Roberts was stationed in North Carolina and Germany. He was ordered twice to go to war, but the orders were twice changed, the family member said.\n\nAfter his Army career, Jerry Roberts served 24 years as a correctional officer for Soledad Correctional Training Facility, said Lt. Roland Ramon, public information officer for the prison. He started work at CTF in 1986 and retired in April 2010.\n\n“He was well-respected and a hard worker,” Ramon said. “Kind of a quiet guy.”\n\nRamon said he was working on putting together a “Now Hear This” announcement for CTF staff regarding Jerry Roberts’ memorial and funeral services.\n\nIn his retirement, Jerry Roberts enjoyed fishing, hunting and carpentry, she said.\n\nBatiz recalled working with Jerry Roberts in the east dorm at the low- and medium-security prison in southern Monterey County. After retiring, Batiz said he ran into Jerry Roberts from time to time in Salinas.\n\nWhen Jerry Roberts aired his concern regarding Matthew Roberts, Batiz said the 70-year-old seemed to feel a sense of obligation for his 34-year-old son.\n\n“He told me, ‘I have to take care of him, he’s my son,’” Batiz recalled.\n\nThe family member confirmed as much: Jerry Roberts loved his children.\n\n“He loved [Matthew],” the family member said. “That’s what makes it so hard, you know? He loved him so much.”\n\nFamily members knew Jerry Roberts was having difficulty with his son, she said.\n\n“But he didn’t want his son to be out [of prison] and have nowhere to go,” she explained.\n\nMatthew Roberts previously served six years in prison for shooting and wounding his step-father, now-retired Monterey County Sheriff’s Detective Larry Bryant. A judge referenced Matthew Roberts’ methamphetamine habit during the 2006 sentencing.\n\nThe whole ordeal “was such a nightmare for [Jerry Roberts],” Batiz said.\n\nIn the ensuing years, Jerry Roberts made a point to visit his son in prison.\n\n“He (Matthew Roberts) was in a few riots and he had to face the consequences,” Batiz said. Jerry Roberts told him his son had the word “Roberts” tattooed on his back, Batiz said. Other inmates often “picked on him,” to hear Jerry Roberts tell it.\n\nIn 2013, Matthew Roberts was convicted of assault causing great bodily injury and battering a peace officer in separate cases. Both cases carried allegations of a previous prison commitment, a previous felony and a prior strike. He was sentenced to a year in jail and three years’ probation, respectively, for the cases.\n\nThe 34-year-old had recently moved in with his father, Batiz said. Jerry Roberts referred to his son as “unpredictable.” If Jerry Roberts declined to turn his car keys over to Matthew Roberts, the younger Roberts would become very irate, Batiz said.\n\n“He was like a little kid,” Batiz said Jerry Roberts told him.\n\nJerry Roberts is survived by four siblings, Barbara Balding, Ray Roberts, Phil Roberts and Jimmy Roberts; two children and seven grandchildren, the family member said. He is preceded in death by his youngest brother, Roger Roberts.\n\nJerry Roberts’ family is asking for prayers.\n\nHis daughter, who just arrived in Salinas, is making discoveries at the Inglewood Street residence, the family member said.\n\n“She found his Bible,” the family member said. “And all his grandchildren’s names are written in his Bible. [His daughter] said, ‘My dad didn’t talk much, but you could tell by little things he had around his house how much he cared about everyone.’”\n\nJerry Roberts was a “soft-spoken man” who didn’t express his emotions through words. Rather, he would perform “actions of love,” the family member said. She recounted Jerry Roberts’ overhearing that she and her husband were seeking a bathroom vanity.\n\n“He had an old bathroom vanity and he gave it to me,” she said. “He just came and dropped it off without us ever asking.”\n\nShe added, “Now, I look at that vanity and I smile.”\n\nBatiz recalled Jerry Roberts having “the best laugh.”\n\n“He was a nice man who had a son who took advantage of him,” Batiz said. “I feel bad I didn’t look more deeply into it.”\n\nJerry Roberts’ body was turned over to his family Monday, Sheriff’s Cmdr. John Thornburg said. He will be buried Friday at the San Joaquin Valley National Cemetery in Santa Nella, Ramon said. A memorial service will follow, tentatively set for March 10 at Echoes from Calvary Church, the family member said.\n\nMatthew Roberts will return to court March 5."
