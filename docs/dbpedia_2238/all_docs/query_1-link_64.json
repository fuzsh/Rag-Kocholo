        "text": "About the Book\n\nRobert Mitchum's bad boy reputation that colors his public profile has been both earned and undeserved. Jerry Roberts discusses the actor's career, his cult status, his under-appreciated talent, his forgotten films, and his nonchalance.This book catalogues previously published information on Mitchum, taking a full measure of the actor and describing the events that occasionally brought him more notoriety than his movies. The book's biographical essay and annotated filmography scrutinize his performing style.\n\nMany yarns about Mitchum have been repeated and modified into legend. But much of the Mitchum myth has been just that: myth. The final word here on various rumors and stories comes from the confirmations, clarifications and corrections made by Robert Mitchum during an interview with the author and in correspondence with several members of the Mitchum family. As with the other Bio-Bibliographies in the Performing Arts, this biographical essay is followed by a chronology, annotated filmography, television, stage, recording and writing credits, list of awards, annotated bibliography listing 1,300 entries and a comprehensive index.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nRobert Mitchum's bad boy reputation that colors his public profile has been both earned and undeserved.
