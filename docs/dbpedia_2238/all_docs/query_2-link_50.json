He was born on August 23, 1963 in Escanaba, the son of James Edward and Emma Eugenia (VanElsacker) Roberts. Jerry was raised in Arnold, MI and was a 1981 graduate of Gwinn High School. Throughout his lifetime, Jerry worked in the woods as a logger. He also was a bus driver for 10 years for the Gwinn School District and Wells Township. Jerry later was employed by Potlatch in Gwinn for 10 years, and ended his working career as a plant manager for Dejnos, Inc. when his health declined. Gerald Roberts married the former Debbie Parrish on July 23, 1983 at St. Anthony Catholic Church in Gwinn. The couple recently celebrated their 37th wedding anniversary and together raised 2 children, Jessica and Josh. Jerry was an avid outdoorsman and greatly enjoyed hunting and fishing. He spent many years farming and enjoyed raising miniature horses. Jerry looked forward to attending auctions to add more “treasures” to his collection.
