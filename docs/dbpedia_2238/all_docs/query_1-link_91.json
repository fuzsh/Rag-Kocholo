        "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas – A 46-year-old Lumberton, Texas man pleaded guilty to federal charges in the Eastern District of Texas, announced U.S. Attorney John M. Bales today.\n\nJerry Lynn Roberts pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a federal agent today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Zachary J. Hawthorn.\n\nAccording to information presented in court, on Mar. 6, 2013, federal agents executed a search warrant at Roberts’ residence in Lumberton, Texas, to search for evidence of child pornography that was mailed to a P.O. Box in Silsbee, Texas, under the name “Jerry Roberts.” Agents were able to determine that Jerry Roberts, who was employed by the Hardin County Sheriff’s Office as a detective, lived in Lumberton, Texas. Investigators were further able to determine that the child pornography was ordered using a credit card under Roberts’ control, using his e-mail address, and using his cell phone number. While at his residence, Roberts agreed to be interviewed by a U.S. Postal Inspector. Roberts told the federal agent that he did not order the videos of suspected child pornography, did not charge their purchase to his credit card and was unfamiliar with the website from which they were ordered. Although investigators did not locate child pornography at the residence, further investigation confirmed that Roberts did order and charge the suspected videos to his credit card, and, as such, his statements were false and were material to the investigation. Roberts was indicted by a federal grand jury on Mar. 5, 2015.\n\nRoberts faces up to eight years in federal prison at sentencing. A sentencing date has not been set.\n\nThis case is being investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Paul A. Hable and Christopher T. Tortorice.\n\n####"
