        "text": "About Dr. Jerry Roberts\n\nDr. Roberts grew up in Griffin, GA and attended the University of Georgia for undergraduate studies. From there, he trained at the Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine and completed his surgical training in Cleveland, Ohio. Dr. Roberts is trained in advanced wound care and limb preservation techniques. While in Cleveland he received training in the correction of flat foot deformities in adults and children, foot and ankle trauma, and total ankle joint replacement.\n\nHis professional priority is providing the highest level of care to the community. “If you are hurting, come in and, let us help you,” said Dr. Roberts. “There are both surgical and non-surgical options to treat most causes of foot pain.” He encourages routine foot examinations and preventive care for those diagnosed with diabetes as the best way to protect from infections and amputations."
