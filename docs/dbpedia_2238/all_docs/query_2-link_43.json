        "text": "Jerry Roberts always believed he could play linebacker at a Power 5 level and when he entered the portal, Arizona was one of the first schools to give him that chance.\n\n“The opportunity came about when I entered the transfer portal and I had a cousin (UK commit Andre Stewart) Arizona was recruiting and he had Coach Brown’s phone number,” Roberts said. “My dad sent my film to Coach Brown and he liked what he saw and then it took off from there.\n\n“My dad and Coach Brown were texting back and forth and I got to talk with Coach Brown. He was telling me what he liked seeing from me and then I got the offer, talked to Coach Fisch, and I liked the message of what Coach Fisch was trying to do. I like what Coach Brown’s defense brought to the table and I feel for my lifelong goals, those two are the ones that can put me in the best position.\n\n“Coming out of high school it was always big football and Power 5 level. I didn’t get that offer in high school, so I went to Bowling Green. Playing at Bowling Green, I felt like I wanted to see if I could play at the Power 5 level and see if I was able to compete with Power 5 competition.”\n\nAt first, Roberts was not a starter for Arizona, but the absence of Treshaun Hayward helped him emerge.\n\n“I’m a very religious person, so I remained poise and trusted the process,” Roberts said. “I said God brought me here for a reason, so I kept my faith in him and when the opportunity presented itself, I said things happen for a reason and I was ready to step in.\n\n“I kept myself ready by doing everything the starters were doing except for actually getting the reps. I was watching the film study, in the playbook, we were sharing reps in practice, I was going full speed in practice and not taking any reps off. Basically, in my head I was playing a role as a starter, but just not getting the reps on the field.”\n\nRoberts has basically played every linebacker position, but feels he is now where he fits the best.\n\n“My freshman year I played middle linebacker, then midway through camp I got switched to outside linebacker and sophomore year got switched back to middle, junior year was outside, and my last year outside linebacker,” Roberts said.\n\n“I like the middle linebacker. I feel that really shows you’re a true linebacker. You have to take on blocks, make the tackles, and stuff like that. I feel like playing outside linebacker, I didn’t really get the tackles I wanted my last year at Bowling Green. I like to take on the challenge and being the leader of the defense.”\n\nThere was an adjustment period at first, but it did not take long for Roberts to get acclimated.\n\n“The speed and size of the players are a big difference,” he said. “We’re all human though, so once I got adjusted to the speed and felt the difference in the linemen and taking on blocking and tempo, I knew this is where I need to be.\n\n“I have another two years. I kind of use it as motivation. I look at it like I only have one year, but I know I have more than one year. I have the mindset of having one year because I feel like that is going to make me play better out there on the field.”"
