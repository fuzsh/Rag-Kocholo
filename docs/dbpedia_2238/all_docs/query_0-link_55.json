He is a cashier at one of Critterwood's Handypaws General Stores.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nA novice in the world of work, Jerry took his job at the Handypaws General store because it was the first job he found that didn't require any prior training. Meek, timid and absolutely terrified of his boss (who he's never seen the face of), he tries to put on a brave face while dealing with customers, and tries to help anyone he meets in the hopes that doing so will net him a little extra cash. Everyone who's visited the store knows Jerry, but they've never actually seen him outside of work. It's inferred that he mostly likes to keep to himself.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nName origin[]"
