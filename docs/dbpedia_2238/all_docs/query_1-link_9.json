        "text": "Jerry T. Roberts '65 graduated from BW in 1965 and was inducted into the Alumni Athletic Association Hall of Fame in 1979.\n\nWhen people think of impressive athletic accomplishments, many who were in school in the sixties think of the man Jerry Roberts. A football Letterman, as an end, for four years, Jerry stacked up quite a few honors, including a berth on the First-Team Offensive and Defensive Squads in 1964, the Cleveland Touchdown Club Award as the Outstanding Local Collegiate Player and the Mike Gregory Award as the Ohio Conference's Outstanding Lineman. In addition to lettering in football Jerry also lettered two years for the B-W baseball team.\n\nCulminating a fantastic senior year, Jerry was named Baldwin-Wallace College's Outstanding Senior Athlete and was the recipient of the Ray E. Watts Most Valuable Player Award. His average in catching the ball was 20.7 yards per reception.\n\nAs a result of these accomplishments, the National Football League's Green Bay Packers drafted Jerry in the seventh round. He participated in pro ball for two years."
