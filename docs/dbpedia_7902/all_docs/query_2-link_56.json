In GoodFellas he lets them run amok.” Jorge Ignacio Castillo\n\n“With the grace of an opera and the brutality of a boxing match, GoodFellas is one of the great American crime stories.” James Luxford\n\n“Joe Pesci has never been better or scarier, the late, great Ray Liotta is a genuine revelation and De Niro is (as he always seemed to be at that time) superb.” Ben Stoddart\n\n“The narrative flair, the immersive world-building, that Steadicam shot, the script, the soundtrack… Scorsese at the height of his powers.” Jane Crowther\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\nThe Greatest Films of All Time\n\nDirectors’ 100 Greatest Films of All Time\n\nDirectors’ 100 Greatest Films of All Time\n\nWhere to begin\n\nWhere to begin with Martin Scorsese\n\nBy Alex Barrett\n\nWhere to begin with Martin Scorsese"
