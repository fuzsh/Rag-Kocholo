        "text": "GoodFellas, critically acclaimed American gangster film, released in 1990, that is regarded as one of the finest works of director Martin Scorsese’s career. Its creative cinematography and outstanding performances by actors including Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Lorraine Bracco give this examination of life in organized crime a lasting influence on films in the gangster and crime genres. GoodFellas was itself influenced by the 1972 gangster epic The Godfather, but, in contrast to the latter film’s focus on the top levels of leadership in the Mafia, GoodFellas sheds light on what life is like for the lower-level “soldiers” who do most of their crime family’s work.\n\nGoodFellas is based on the true story of New York mobster Henry Hill, as told in American author and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi’s 1985 biography Wiseguy: Life in a Mafia Family. The film spans the years from 1955, when a teenage Hill began working for a caporegime, or lieutenant, in the Lucchese crime family, to 1980, when Hill was arrested for cocaine trafficking. The film also touches on Hill’s role in the 1978 Lufthansa heist of $5.8 million in cash and jewels at the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, which led to the murders of some of Hill’s associates.\n\nThe film follows Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) as he begins serving as an errand boy for local caporegime Paulie Cicero (Paul Sorvino). He then becomes a fence, or receiver of stolen goods, and starts working with two of Paulie’s associates, Jimmy Conway (Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci). Although Henry can never be a “made” man—a fully initiated member of the Mafia—because only one of his parents is of Italian descent, he nevertheless becomes a trusted member of Paulie’s crew. Henry’s journey is illuminated by stunning cinematography, with several long tracking shots that bring viewers into the film’s action. GoodFellas is also well known for its sudden, shocking bouts of violence, especially from Tommy, who has an explosive temper and little self-control.\n\nHenry courts and marries Karen (Lorraine Bracco), and they have two children together, all while Henry makes a living robbing, bribing, and extorting for the mob. GoodFellas shows the allure of the mobster life for men like Hill, who came from a lower-income background and grew up wishing for a more glamorous and more prosperous life. Henry enjoys the power and influence he gains by working for the mob and takes full advantage of the privileges and perks afforded to him. He can spend and tip extravagantly, and, wherever he goes, he gets the best of everything—such as, in one iconic scene, a front-row table at the Copacabana nightclub. Henry narrates events from his point of view, and, later in the film, Karen does as well. Through their eyes, the film depicts the closed-circle culture of organized crime, in which couples and families socialize only with others who work for the mob.\n\nFollowing this high point, GoodFellas shows how Henry’s life is affected by time spent in prison and his involvement in the illegal drug trade. He eventually becomes addicted to cocaine and, in a frenetic scene, is arrested for cocaine trafficking. Paulie, who had forcefully warned Henry against involvement in the drug trade, ends his relationship with Henry. Jimmy worries that Henry will inform on him in a plea bargain with law enforcement, so he tries to arrange for Henry and Karen’s murders. Henry realizes that he will not survive unless he becomes an informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In a trial-court scene, he testifies against Jimmy and Paulie. He then enters the witness protection program with Karen and their children. The film ends with Henry waxing nostalgic about his gangster lifestyle and bemoaning his new status as an “average nobody…a schnook.”\n\nGoodFellas shows how participation in organized crime—in pursuit of a twisted version of the American dream—destroyed the lives of Hill, his family, and many of his friends and associates. “[GoodFellas] is an indictment of organized crime, but it doesn’t stand outside in a superior moralistic position,” wrote film critic Roger Ebert in a 2002 review. “It explains crime’s appeal for a hungry young man who has learned from childhood beatings not to hate power, but to envy it.”"
