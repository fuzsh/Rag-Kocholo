        "text": "Over at Salon, Matt Zoller Seitz on Friday Night Seitz has put together his favorite Scorsese movies:\n\nThis has been quite a year for 60-something American filmmakers. Terrence Malick, who started directing in 1973, created the year’s most divisive conversation piece with “The Tree of Life.” Woody Allen, who started directing in 1966, had his biggest financial success with “Midnight in Paris.” Steven Spielberg, who directed his first feature-length movie 40 years ago, has two blockbusters coming out this month, “The Adventures of Tintin” and “War Horse.” And Martin Scorsese, who made his directorial debut in 1966, has had another success with “Hugo,” a film history-conscious 3-D art film for kids that finished second to “The Muppets” at the box office during its opening weekend and was just named film of the year by the National Board of Review. It’s as good a time as any for a Best of Scorsese list — as if I really need an excuse!\n\nOn Facebook I ranked my favorite Scorsese movies just for the hell of it. And though I suppose my favorites shift depending on what I’m feeling at the time, right now I’m going through a Departed phase, and of course, it’s hard not to look at the diversity of this director’s work in light of his success with Hugo. Right now, this is my list — if I had to pick ten, I’d go:\n\nTaxi Driver\n\nRaging Bull\n\nKing of Comedy\n\nGoodfellas\n\nThe Departed\n\nHugo\n\nMean Streets\n\nAge of Innocence\n\nNo Direction Home\n\nA Personal Journey Through American Movies\n\nThe Last Waltz\n\nBut then, I couldn’t give up these either:\n\nThe Aviator\n\nShutter Island\n\nAlice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore\n\nCape Fear\n\nGangs of New York\n\nNew York New York\n\nHow about you?"
