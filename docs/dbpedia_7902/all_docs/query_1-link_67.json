        "text": "Is GoodFellas fantastic? Absolutely. Is Casino, perhaps, just a smidge better? You bet.\n\nWhy does it feel impossible to talk about Casino, an undervalued and underrated movie, without talking about GoodFellas? The two, in a sense, are inexorably linked, partly because of the mob connection, the \"based on a true story\" milieu of the subject matter, and, of course, Robert De Niro. However, Casino, wide and ambitious in scope, is too often dismissed as \"wiseguys go west\"; another gangster flick that doesn’t live up to the esteem of Martin Scorsese’s street hood masterpiece. It’s a shame because Casino is a more substantial, artful, and engrossing movie than GoodFellas. It’s partly because Ace Rothstein, Casino’s main character, is a far more fascinating creature than Henry Hill. It’s also because Casino is a dazzling period piece, a penetrating historical work that captures Las Vegas better than any other movie that has come before or after it. While it may not be Marty’s best gangster movie of all time, it is his best epic.\n\nIn GoodFellas, the hoods, even with all their cheerful sociopathy, get progressively smaller and pettier as the movie progresses, it is, after all, about the grind of small timers. Casino, on the other hand, elevates Scorsese’s favorite themes—greed, hubris, the primal lure of violence—above the street corner and into the inner working’s of America’s Sodom. The film is a weighty one; an anthropological exploration of how the mob lost their westernmost outpost to more rapacious forces like Steve Wynn and Disney-style real estate corporations. The three personalities at center of it all—The Accountant, The Gangster, and The Hustler—are rendered so large, so loud, that they match the mythic level of a true rise and fall. Casino has scope and depth that GoodFellas can’t achieve.\n\nThe first third of the film is ballsy. It’s all journalistic exposition, voiceovers done by a breathy Robert De Niro and a hyperactive Joe Pesci tracing a web of corruption that spindles out from a casino count room, to the Teamsters union, through local desert politicians, to a smoke choked cave in Kansas city filled with Midwestern mooks getting rich off the skim. Scorsese gives us the same kind of insider dope that got us high in GoodFellas,but in Casino it’s pure narcotic. The neon sets are so luscious that you can’t tell night from day. The camera moves so swiftly, in such perpetuity, with the edits cueing up so perfectly to the Rolling Stones and down home soul, that you’d go cross-eyed if you weren’t so damn giddy. What techniques Scorsese tested in GoodFellas are on full display in Casino. The extended Copa shot? Peanuts compared to the first 45 minutes of Casino. The first portion of the film plays the way a trailer from the ’70s Golden Era might: stripping things to the narrative bone, dispensing with dull scenes of connective tissue, moving at a fierce clip, and papering the cracks with voiceover.\n\nThe kinetic, hallucinatory effect breaks as we swirl in closer to the personalities of the picture: Sam \"Ace\" Rothstein, Nicky Santoro, and Ginger McKenna. Rothstein is De Niro’s last adult role; the last time he carried the full dignity of his legacy. During the glory days, it was always a treat to watch him strut around in full masculine bravura, like he did as Jimmy Conway in GoodFellas. But De Niro’s preternatural talent is playing reticent, anxious men, haunted by their own inadequacy (Did you know that De Niro’s first role was the Cowardly Lion in his high school production of The Wizard of Oz? Couldn’t you just die?). Ace is the outsider among outsiders: a dispassionate, calculating, almost pitifully tender civilian among thugs. He’s a Jewish bookie sent by the mob to manage a Vegas casino and grift cash for the crime bosses Back Home. Even when he dons a flamboyant Mylanta-colored suit and runs patrol around the felt tables of his amoral arena, he looks unsatisfied. Not out of rage, but neurosis, the kind that has him counting the lbs. of his showgirls rather than groping them. Unlike other gangsters in the Scorsesian universe, who indulge in all the carnalities of a boy’s utopia, Rothstein wants to retain the airs of a civilian, he wants a wife.\n\nDe Niro makes a marriage pitch to high-class hustler Ginger (Sharon Stone) under pink neon lights and faux cherry trees. Does De Niro ever look so pained and out of place than when he’s kissing a woman? The way he aligns those indelible face muscles to simultaneously flash anguish and pleasure. What exquisite torture! \"Are you trying to handicap me?\" Ginger asks, not without charm. She shoots him down, admitting that she doesn’t love him, her heart belongs to a two-bit pimp she’s been with since she was 14. De Niro, vulnerable and flushed, starts brushing invisible flecks from his sheen crimson suit. \"That’s OK,\" he mumbles, \"What is love anyways?\" Rothstein tries to long-con Ginger by promising lifelong security, furs, money, with the hope that she’ll grow attached. But girls like Ginger don’t cling to kind men.\n\nHere is where a sturdy Scorsese theme is drawn out beautifully: the confounding nature of women. Stone is so dangerous. She’s a Stratocaster of sex. Blondes like Ginger have existed on the edge of sex and violence since their knee socks days. She possesses that white trash quality, straight out of Van Nuys, that scrambles the brains of second-generation boys raised by Catholic immigrant mamas. Ginger is more forceful than Ace. She bucks wildly and goes berserk at every attempt he makes to domesticate her. Unlike the other characters in Casino, or GoodFellas, Ginger never gets a voiceover. We are never cued into her motives. Even in GoodFellas, Karen (Lorraine Bracco) explains why a nice Jewish girl like herself gets her crank turned by a criminal who pistols whips sexual rivals. Ginger’s female hustler code, however, remains immediate and unknown; she is constantly mystifying the men around her. We only get to see Ace’s need and love for her turn into a suffocating paranoia. This sort of romantic pain that Ace suffers over again (something Henry Hill never experiences, as his world is replete with trashy, coke-addled girlfriends) creates a loneliness and frustration that De Niro does so well. When he finally unleashes on Ginger, Stone matches it, with glorious ferocity, it’s hard to look directly into her eyes. She’s like the sun—the performance in Casino is her best.\n\nAs Ginger starts to unravel, she goes to Ace’s best friend Nicky Santoro, played by Joey Pesci, for advice. \"Will you be my sponsor?\" Ginger, asks while sobbing on Nicky’s lap. Santoro is synonymous with Tommy Devito, Pesci’s hot-headed, explosive, land gremlin of violence from GoodFellas. The roles are fairly indistinguishable, though Pesci has a couple of scenes in Casino where he’s allowed to wonderfully underplay, sniffing around the edges of a conflict. The tension between Nicky and Ace mounts and Ginger eventually mounts Nicky. The sense of betrayal is grand and far better than any ratting out or killing in GoodFellas. Remember, in that film, when De Niro’s character tries to casually whack Bracco’s character in the dress warehouse after he’s killed ten people to a montage of Eric Clapton’s \"Layla\" outro? That’s his pal’s wife! And she was treated like small potatoes. When we’re told at the close of _GoodFellas _that Karen and Henry divorced after 25 years of marriage, we’re baffled. We’re given no insight into what made them stay together. Yet when we see the final shot of Ginger, strung out on biker crank, passing out in a dank motel hallway, we’re crushed, just like Ace.\n\nWhen it all falls apart, when the mob gets run out because they got too sloppy, when Nicky is buried alive in a cornfield, when Ginger takes off with $1.2 million of Ace’s money and ODs, when the decrepit ancient bosses get indicted and turn Vegas into Wiseguy Valhalla, an acute sense of loss and diminution washes over you. It’s the same kind of strange pity you feel when the aging sisters of The Strip—The Hacienda, The Dunes, The Sands—get dynamited down into dust."
