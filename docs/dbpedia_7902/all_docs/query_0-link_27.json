        "text": "For the first time, I (Rachel) am getting to bring you an edition in our Monday Movie series. Since this was an Olympics year, I wanted to see if I could find one based around that. I was successful in my quest when I found Chariots of Fire. Like this year, the 1924 Olympics were also held in Paris. When I found the movie, it made me think of one of my teachers from graduate school, because he once told us that one of the best things about libraries is those moments of serendipity when you find the perfect item you needed without fully knowing that that was what you needed.\n\nFor any that haven’t seen the movie, here is the description from the library’s catalog:\n\nThe story, told in flashback, of two young British sprinters competing for fame in the 1924 Olympics. Eric, a devout Scottish missionary, runs because he knows it must please God. Harold, the son of a newly rich Jew, runs to prove his place in Cambridge society. In a warmup 100-meter race, Eric defeats Harold, who hires a pro trainer to prepare him. Eric, whose qualifying heat is scheduled for a Sunday, refuses to run despite pressure from the Olympic committee. A compromise is reached when a nobleman allows Eric to compete in his 400-meter slot. Eric and Harold win their respective races and go on to achieve fame as missionary and businessman/athletic advocate, respectively.\n\nSo, here are some of my thoughts while watching this movie:\n\nBoth Harold and Eric ran to help fulfill a purpose. Harold’s was more self-motivated with wanting to prove himself and his worth, despite his Jewish heritage. Eric, a missionary, saw his ability to run as a gift from God and sought to please him through his actions. While the motivations were different, I was reminded of the importance of searching for our purpose in life and finding what’s most important. Related to finding your purpose, I also appreciated how much they focused on Eric’s faith in the movie. I feel like nowadays faith can be pushed off to the side instead of being a focus. For Eric, his faith truly drove each aspect of his life, and they helped to show that through the storyline.\n\nAnother reason I chose this movie is due to my enjoyment of movies based around athletes/athletics. I think storylines like that make it easy as a viewer to find the people that you want to root for. While wanting to see people win is part of it, I enjoy these stories due to seeing their growth as people. When you find your “circle” so to speak, you find those who can better understand what you’re going through and help pick you up when you’re in a difficult moment.\n\nThere were times when the pacing felt a little slow, but it didn’t detract from my overall enjoyment of the movie. The slow moments made me think of someone that’s running a marathon and how they will have moments of doubt or pain that cause them to slow down, but they continue to keep their eyes on the prize and focus on those around them to help keep them going. While there were some slower moments, I felt like the music that was selected helped to keep me engaged. This isn’t something I always notice, but I think that the songs helped to highlight what was happening, while also building tension when needed.\n\nI think anyone could enjoy this film, but I recommend it even more for those that enjoy movies that help to highlight faith and athletics. It is in our DVD collection with the call number PN1997 .C4362.\n\nRachel Bloomingburg’s reviews reflect her personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\nWelcome back to another Monday Movie! Today, we’re talking about one of Christopher Nolan’s earliest films: 2000’s Memento starring Guy Pearce. I had not seen Memento before, though it’s been on my radar for a long time. I’ve been a fan of Christopher Nolan’s movies for a long time too, and Memento really held up to my high expectations for him—especially impressive considering how early this movie occurs in his filmography.\n\nMemento’s plot had me hooked from the very beginning. Without spoiling much, the basic premise is that a man (named Leonard) is seeking to avenge his wife’s death, but he has a psychological condition where he can’t remember anything for longer than a few minutes.\n\nChristopher Nolan loves nonlinear storytelling (see, for example, The Prestige, Dunkirk, Oppenheimer, etc.) and this film is no exception. The entire movie moves backwards from scene to scene, meaning the audience knew how the story “ended” before any other details. In the hands of another director or writer, this could easily be extremely confusing and disorienting, but in Memento the reversed sequence of events is well-executed and even engrossing. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time trying to piece things together and catch every detail.\n\nOne of the incredible things about this movie is that you don’t know what to think about the characters throughout. The main character’s condition makes for an inherent unreliable narrator effect—one that’s particularly fascinating because the plot is so inescapably unreliable even to the narrator himself.\n\nBecause of that, I found it impossible to decide what to think of any character until all the pieces fell into place—and even then, I wasn’t completely sure what to think!\n\nThe whole plot is built around Leonard’s unique condition, making him easily the most interesting character, especially since many of the more interesting aspects of the plot are an extension of his character.\n\nMemento’s plot felt more self-contained than other Christopher Nolan films I’ve seen. Or maybe it would be more accurate to say that it felt less expansive. There are few characters, and although I was left with several questions at the end, I don’t know if I’ll be thinking about it for weeks on end like I did when I watched The Prestige or Interstellar for the first time.\n\nI don’t want to downplay the quality of the storytelling at all, though. Memento is one of the best and most engrossing thrillers I’ve ever watched. The plot is just built more around one person and the people he interacts with, rather than massive worldbuilding seen in Inception, Interstellar, Tenet, etc.\n\nMemento (like many Christopher Nolan films) is a masterclass in creative storytelling. Nolan is like a magician, keeping his audience unable to look away, leaving them shocked at the outcome, and giving them much to think about after the performance. I was guessing about specific details up until the very last scene (and I’m still guessing about some things!).\n\nMemento is not a feel-good movie by any means, but for a fascinating crime thriller you won’t be able to look away from, look no further than Christopher Nolan’s underrated 2000 release.\n\nDarius Mullin’s reviews reflect his personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\n“… The last harvest for okra. Ever.”\n\nThus begins the world of the 2014 movie Interstellar. Directed and written by Christopher Nolan, Interstellar is set in the near future and depicts a world where most crops have been rendered unable to grow due to an unknown pathogen called the Blight. It is revealed that the only crop that can currently be grown is corn, with okra being the most recent victim of the Blight. The lack of vegetation has also led to a second Dust Bowl. The movie explores both dystopian and science fiction themes, as well as the morality of serving the greater good over family.\n\nDue to the impending doom of starvation, an ex-Nasa engineer named Cooper volunteers to go on a mission through a wormhole to another galaxy. In years past, NASA had sent explorers through the wormhole to land on planets nearby and see if they were good for human colonization. It is Cooper’s crew’s mission to rescue these prior explorers and see which, if any, of the planets are suitable for a colonization effort.\n\nInterstellar is also one of the most realistic movies ever, regarding astrophysics. It deals with a lot of heavy scientific topics, such as Einstein’s relativity, the depiction of a wormhole, and the depiction of a blackhole. It also has one of the best movie soundtracks ever, in my opinion.\n\nSome people may find Interstellar confusing, due to the in-depth nature of some of the scientific plot elements. While this is true, it is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and find new details every time. So even if you don’t understand it on the first watch through, I would recommend watching it at least twice more.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend Interstellar to those who have an interest in aerospace and physics, and those who are okay with watching a nearly three-hour long movie.\n\nIsaiah Cox’s reviews reflect his personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\nWelcome back to another Monday Movie! Today, Darius and Micah are talking about the 1986 animated film When the Wind Blows. This feature is one of more than 35,000 available via Films on Demand. Watching When the Wind Blows was an interesting experience; check out our thoughts below!\n\nWhat do you think of the animation style(s) of this film?\n\nDarius Mullin, Evening Circulation Supervisor, said: The animation style feels very normal, but somehow at the same time, slightly different than what I’m used to in 2D animation—even 2D animation of decades past—in a way that I don’t really have the vocabulary to describe. Suffice to say, this subtle, minute element of unconventionality helped contribute to the overall uncanniness of the film.\n\nThe movie also makes use of alternate animation styles for a few sequences over the course of the story. Some of these were strange and jarring, but overall, I thought they added to the story by providing insight into the inner lives of the two main characters. There’s also one sequence that’s done in a very minimal style that looks like a sketchbook, which was very evocative for its context.\n\nMicah Rhodes, Cataloging Associate, said: The animation style was quite archaic by today’s standards, and distracted me from time to time. There were several sequences when either real imagery or very realistic art was used, contrasting strongly against the more simplistic 2D animation of the characters. I’m unsure whether these were artistic choices or caused by animation constraints during production; regardless, they were quite jarring and did not enhance my understanding of the story or message.\n\nThe plot of this movie is pretty basic. Did it hold your attention? Why or why not?\n\nDarius Mullin said: The plot did hold my attention. The pacing of When the Wind Blows is really good: nothing much happens for quite some time, but somehow the viewer experiences a steadily growing sense of dread. (If you’ve seen The Clone Wars episode “Shattered,” you know what I’m talking about.) In fact, the very fact that almost nothing really happens during the movie’s runtime (with, of course, one major exception) seems to be the whole point. Hilda and Jim have nothing to do with the events unfolding around them.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: Yes, it kept my attention for the whole movie. Though it was simple, the tension became more and more oppressive as you waited for the thing you knew had to happen.\n\nWhat did you think of the two main characters?\n\nDarius Mullin said: The two main characters, Jim and Hilda, are an elderly English couple, who have retired in the countryside. In another context the pair would be unbearably boring, but as I’ve alluded to above, the normalcy of the couple is clearly intentional. They are a charming pair, if flawed.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: The two characters were quaint and rather ignorant, or perhaps ill-informed. Their simple life contrasted severely with the events they went through, and they were clearly unprepared for the circumstances they found themselves in. I wanted to root for them, even though I knew there was nothing that could be done.\n\nWhat point(s) do you think the makers of When the Wind Blows are trying to make, if any?\n\nDarius Mullin said: Jim and Hilda are victims of a complicated geopolitical event / set of events that they clearly don’t even understand. It’s hard not to finish the movie without that fact weighing heavy on your mind.\n\nMaybe When the Wind Blows has an anti-war message. Or maybe it’s that ordinary people are disregarded and trampled upon by the opaquely massive machinations of the various opposing forces that operate in this world. Or maybe that ugly feeling of pointless tragedy is the whole message by itself.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: The points I remember most clearly:\n\n– A government does not necessarily know for certain how best to equip its citizens to endure a crisis, and if it is not transparent about this, could end up recommending nothing helpful or even causing harm.\n\n– It takes a long time for people to let go of past hurts or prejudices. Jim keeps calling the enemy the Germans and then has to correct himself to call them the Russians, getting confused by World War II.\n\n– Nuclear war is bad! Don’t do it! Innocent people will be hurt and killed.\n\nWould you recommend watching When the Wind Blows?\n\nDarius Mullin said: I think so. The overall effect of the movie is pretty unnerving. Nonetheless, it’s a very unique film and an absolutely fascinating look into the mood of the time when it was made.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: Yes. It’s not long, but provides a sobering perspective on nuclear warfare and is a clear product of Cold War concerns. It was a particularly interesting watch for me after seeing Oppenheimer this summer and the BBC Chernobyl show this fall.\n\nYou can find When the Wind Blows via Films on Demand.

This time around we’re talking about the 1980 animated film The Return of the King: A Story of the Hobbits, an adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic fantasy novel The Return of the King. Despite both being fans of Tolkien’s work since an early age, neither Darius nor Micah had ever seen this movie before. Dive into our thoughts below!\n\nThe animated Return of the King had a runtime of only 97 minutes, and many characters and events from Tolkien’s book were cut. What or whom did you miss the most?\n\nDarius Mullin, Evening Circulation Supervisor, said: In a weird way, the fact that Return of the King was necessarily such a condensed version of the Lord of the Rings story made me miss the characters that were cut less. In the live action movies, whenever something was cut or altered it stood out and my instinct was instantly to question that decision. In the 97-minute animated film, I had to accept from the opening scene that this rendition would (of course) not have everything in it, allowing me to enjoy what was present more fully. So, for example, when I watched 2003’s Return of the King for the first time I was really disappointed when the scouring of the Shire was left out, but this time around I never considered its inclusion to be a possibility. To answer the question, though, one character I was hoping to see and didn’t was Faramir.\n\nOn a related note, I found it interesting whenever the 1980 Return of the King included details that were absent from Peter Jackson’s trilogy, such as the Two Watchers of Cirith Ungol.\n\nMicah Rhodes, Cataloging Associate, said: I missed Legolas and Gimli the most. Elrond was the only elf present in the movie, and dwarves were mentioned at the beginning but never appeared. I think the absence of the nobler fantasy races diminishes some of the fairytale whimsy The Lord of the Rings is known for. Additionally, since this movie was a direct sequel from The Hobbit animation, a lot of exposition was required at the beginning to set up the story and recount The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. Many important events and characters were discarded in this summary, too, which had a twofold effect on my viewing experience. First, I think the introduction was too long and therefore pushed out other important details to the Return of the King narrative. Second, I suspect that watching The Hobbit and then The Return of the King with a 20-minute recap of what happened between the two would be confusing and unsatisfying for audiences, both for those who have read the books and those who have not. Finally, for being called The Return of the King, we actually didn’t see Aragorn, the king, very much.\n\nTolkien included songs and poems in The Lord of the Rings to give Middle-Earth languages a rich sense of history. What did you think of the music written for the animation?\n\nDarius Mullin said: The music itself didn’t particularly impress me one way or the other (with one exception: at one point the orcs sang a song that I found to be downright silly). I loved the overall decision to frame the whole narrative as the ballad of “Frodo of the Nine Fingers.” Within Tolkien’s world, telling a story through song is the most natural thing possible. Check out “The Adventures of Tom Bombadil” in The Tolkien Reader for some more songs from Middle Earth!\n\nMicah Rhodes said: I really liked that song was a big focus in this movie! It felt like reading the books in some ways, where Tolkien includes long lays that pause the narrative and linger in the love of language. However, the actual content and musicality of the songs left much to be desired. They were cheesy and shallow, and I wish that the film creators had either adapted songs from the books, or at least tried to mimic Tolkien’s poetic style.\n\nMiddle-Earth’s unique blend of whimsical fairy tale and epic mythology creates a recognizably ancient, deep, and authentic aesthetic. Do you think this aesthetic is well-communicated through the animated feature?\n\nDarius Mullin said: I do. A lot of late 20th-century 2D animation has a kind of bizarre quality to it, and I think this tone lends itself to the task of crafting fantastical landscapes. One of my favorite aspects of this adaptation was the character design, which perfectly straddles the familiar and the foreign. The hobbits, for example, look enough like humans as to be relatable, but also look different enough that they actually seemed like a different kind of creature (as opposed to just small men). I enjoyed seeing different takes on what some of the more unsettling denizens of Middle Earth might look like, such as the Nazgul Witch-King, the Mouth of Sauron, and Gollum.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: Mostly yes, and a little no. I’ll explain! The artistic direction for the backgrounds was spot-on. The hand-drawn landscapes were gorgeous and evocative, bringing to life an old and mythical world. I also noticed several interesting similarities to what we see later in Peter Jackson’s live-action movies. The city of Minas-Tirith was remarkably similar, with many tiers that gradually led to the royal buildings at the top, and a large rock formation jutted out from the middle of everything. A brief glimpse at the Gray Havens showed a swan ship that would be right at home in the books or Jackson’s movies, and Gondorian heraldry included wing-shaped designs on the helmets. Eowyn’s stand against the Witch-King was as heroic and courageous as I’ve ever seen it. It makes me want to go back and read Tolkien’s descriptions of these places, events, and objects, because these two very different adaptations included very similar aesthetics.\n\nMy “no” comes in some of the character designs, particularly the Witch-King. Since Sauron was an off-screen nemesis, the Witch-King of Angmar was the biggest villain we saw, and he looked and sounded like a Saturday morning cartoon villain (*cough* Skeletor! *cough​*). We don’t even see him fight Theoden at all! In my opinion, it was not a satisfying design for a millennia-old sorcerer king turned into a wraith and bent to the will of a dark lord by magic rings. But that’s just me.\n\nWhat advantages does this adaptation of Tolkien’s work hold over others you may have experienced?\n\nDarius Mullin said: My experience with Middle Earth adaptations (prior to this) is really just the live-action Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films. Building on my previous answer, I did quite enjoy the way the 1980 Return of the King felt even more like a whole different world, as opposed to a fantastical alternative version of medieval Europe.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: I think that it is a great way for children to begin to enter Middle-Earth when they may still be too young for the books or live-action movies. The animated Return of the King gets the basic plot of the end of The Lord of the Rings across, truncated though it may be. Hopefully, it draws kids into the beauty of Tolkien’s world and makes them want to read the books for themselves!\n\nYou can find The Return of the King in the Media Collection of the Union University Library.\n\nLibrary staff reviews reflect their personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\nWelcome back to another Monday Movie! Today, Darius and Micah are talking about Goodfellas, the acclaimed 1990 movie directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro. The movie is a biographical film following the lives of Henry Hill, an American gangster, and his wife, Karen. The movie is based on Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, a nonfiction book on the same subject published in 1985. Dive into our thoughts below!\n\nWhat do you think of the worldbuilding in Goodfellas?\n\nDarius Mullin, Evening Circulation Supervisor, said: I couldn’t help but compare Goodfellas to The Godfather as I watched. In The Godfather, the danger of the Corleones’ world lurks like a shadow even in the most benign scenes. In Goodfellas, the moral depravity of Henry Hill’s world is more subtle most of the movie (at least for the first half) but is readily apparent in certain explosive scenes. This is probably because the movie is told through Hill’s eyes, and Hill repeatedly mentions how “normal” everything felt for him.\n\nWhat do you make of the decision to include voiceover monologues as part of the storytelling?\n\nDarius Mullin said: Really interesting decision. It’s interesting to hear what the characters are thinking in situations where an audience would naturally want to know and otherwise wouldn’t. On the other hand, it introduces an unreliable narrator element to the story, as both narrators have a) hindsight, b) normalization, and c) other personal motives potentially skewing their recollection and interpretation of events.\n\nMicah Rhodes, Cataloging Associate, said: It was a smart choice, especially for a mobster movie and world. The core value of mobster society as presented in Goodfellas seems to be the tying of threads of individuals and nuclear families into the shared narrative tapestry of “The Family,” which makes its own rules to take care of its own people. A combination of where someone comes from, what they do, and who they know determines their place and importance in this narrative and Family. If someone doesn’t show the proper respect to one of those three areas, no matter how much they may respect the other two, they risk being cut out of that tapestry. So, the historical story of the mob Family is held as one of the most important parts of mobster life. Additionally, we see many moments where characters recount and reminisce about past crime jobs, lovers, fights, and other wild activities; indicating that personal storytelling is both a skill and a way to establish your place in the Family. It matters what stories someone has to tell and how they tell them. Thus, the voiceover monologues are internally consistent to how any Goodfellas mobster would recount their lives, as well as effective in communicating important details while showing related, and equally important, but different details that provide important characterization and context for the audience. Finally, the plot justification for the monologues is revealed by the end of the movie, which I think was unnecessary given all the utility I just described, but it was simply the cherry on top of a well-executed frame device.\n\nGoodfellas could be considered a “slice of life” movie focusing on a particular community. What do you think draws audiences to this world?\n\nDarius Mullin said: The crime world that is so normal to Henry Hill is equally alien to (most) viewers. True-to-life stories of human depravity like Goodfellas, The Godfather, or even Breaking Bad give viewers a window through which to observe “the life” without the danger of experiencing it. I remember when working on an article for the library’s March Book Madness I came across a literary critic who described the appeal of The Godfather novel being a sort of nonsexual voyeurism. I reckon he hit it on the head. Henry Hill frequently asserts how enchanted he was with “the life” and how great it was to experience such freedom in such a tight-knit community; movies like Goodfellas give an opportunity to peek in on these things without the danger of, you know, being murdered.\n\nOne last thought—both The Godfather and Goodfellas present the increased sale of illegal drugs as a marker delineating the beginning of a new, worse era of organized crime, and therefore the end of the previous era. I suspect that presenting the organized crime world as a bygone golden era allows audiences to somewhat suspend the instinct for ethical judgement.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: There are many reasons, so I’ll list just a few. One is that it’s simply a little thrilling to see life lived outside of legal and social rules; after all, that thrill is one of the chief reasons mobsters embrace that lifestyle. Another is that there’s always a spectacle when things go wrong. It’s never something mundane like missing bills or getting over the flu, but heists turning into stings or murders going too far. There might even be a bit of wistfulness in wondering what you would do with all that wealth, if you would make smarter decisions than the “wise guys,” if you could get out before you get too sucked in, or what it would be like to belong to a close-knit community. When everyday life is all about keeping away from the law and taking as much as you can get, “slice of life” tends to be intense.\n\nWhat character did you find most interesting?\n\nDarius Mullin said: Probably the protagonist, Henry Hill. At times he seems to be a decent guy, but then he does something awful. You want to root for him but know you shouldn’t.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: For me, it has to be the main character, Henry Hill. It’s never explicitly stated that he’s a diplomat, but he is always doing whatever he can to defuse tensions and act as the go-between for deals with competing personalities. He’s the “nice guy” who may not achieve the same notoriety as some of his peers but without whom many would tear each other apart—along with a good portion of the Family and its assets. You naturally want to root for him but must be conflicted while doing so, as it’s quite clear from his actions and family life that he is not a good guy.\n\nWithout spoiling it—what did you think of the ending?\n\nDarius Mullin said: One of the characters makes a decision at the end of the story that I found to be quite surprising. The revelation of who the protagonist was speaking to in all the monologues also surprised me. Needless to say, the movie did not end the way I expected. In a way I was pleasantly surprised that the movie did not conclude the way I thought it would; on the other hand, the ending felt out of character for the kind of story that was being told.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: It’s deliciously ironic. I think viewers generally walk away with a sense that things ended in a somewhat positive manner, but the film’s protagonist would not see it that way at all. Not many movies—or any stories for that matter—end with those two perceptions in such clear opposition. Goodfellas pulls it off quite well.\n\nYou can find Goodfellas in the Media Collection of the Union University Library.\n\nLibrary staff reviews reflect their personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\nWelcome back to Monday Movies! It’s been some time since the library blog’s last entry to this series, but we’re bringing it back to life. This time Darius and Micah sat down to watch and discuss Soylent Green, directed by Richard Fleischer. The 1973 movie is a dystopian science fiction thriller based on the novel Make Room! Make Room! by Harry Harrison. Check out our thoughts below.\n\nWhat did you think of the worldbuilding in Soylent Green?\n\nDarius Mullin, Evening Circulation Supervisor, said: I thought the worldbuilding was fascinating. Details were subtly revealed in ways that were clear yet didn’t insult the audience’s intelligence. As a viewer, my lack of awareness of the overall world the characters inhabited had the potential to cause confusion while the main character carried out his investigation; this was not the case though, and I felt that the pacing was easy to understand. Everything seemed very ordinary, yet quite “off” at the same time. It was a very believable-feeling near-future dystopia.\n\nMicah Rhodes, Cataloging Associate, said: It did a good job of both showing and telling how the world had arrived at the state we see in the movie. The opening reel takes the audience from the Industrial Revolution to a polluted, manufactured future. The characters were almost always sweating, on account of the soaring temperatures caused by global warming. One detail that especially grabbed me was that tenement landlords would sit and openly brandish assault rifles, presumably defending their property and maintaining some semblance of order. It was clearly communicated–though never explicitly spoken–that space was as precious a commodity as food.\n\nDid you have a favorite character?\n\nDarius Mullin said: A lot of the characters were hard to like… I did find Sol the “book” to be quite likeable, though.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: My favorite character was Solomon Roth, the protagonist’s elderly roommate/coworker. He was old enough to remember a different world, one before the climate crises, food shortages, and overpopulation of the Soylent Green future. I particularly liked his desire for Thorn to experience some of life’s lost simple pleasures, like a meal of real beef, or the sweet taste of strawberries, or landscapes of the natural world.\n\nSoylent Green was released in 1973. Did you find it prescient? Unrealistic? Cynical?\n\nDarius Mullin said: Soylent Green is often referred to as an ecological thriller, and I can see why. Main themes include climate change, overpopulation, and pollution. I think this story is a fascinating look into what climate anxiety looked like 50 years ago compared to today. The movie is set in 2022; as such, I found it to be both prescient and exaggerated. Climate change has not impacted the lives of (most) humans in urban areas to the degree portrayed in the film: at the same time, it has had disastrous and obvious effects on the world at large.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: Obviously, the speculated technology presented in Soylent Green 2022 is laughably archaic from our perspective in a digitized 2023. However, the climate concerns still feel very well-founded and pertinent 50 years later, as we continue to see the effects of climate change on our planet and its ecosystems.\n\nWhat do you think of the overall plot of the movie? Any other comments?\n\nDarius Mullin said: I already knew the big reveal going in, so it didn’t take me aback like it would have for the original audience. Nonetheless, it was well executed (imagining that I didn’t already know). I liked that the movie followed a police detective’s investigation. The tone of the movie was less Star Wars, Star Trek, or even Alien, but reminded me a lot of Ray Bradbury’s writing.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: I was engaged throughout the whole movie, even though I had the ending spoiled for me long before. The framing of a detective noir story in a dystopian setting was at times jarring and at others quite effective; overall, I think it succeeds in communicating the tone, state of the world, and speculative future the filmmakers wanted. It was hard for me to really like any of the characters besides Sol, even the main protagonist, but I also think that was intentional. Soylent Green is a rather infamous movie, and I think it earned its reputation for good enough reasons that most people should watch it at least once.\n\nSoylent Green is a science fiction classic.

The film was directed by Ron Howard after there was an uproar by Disney executives and the film’s actors, who felt that the previous directors, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, had taken the wrong approach. As much as seventy percent of the film needed to be reshot as a result.\n\nThe plot of the film centers on a young Han Solo (Alden Ehrenreich) growing up on the crime-ridden world of Corellia. Han dreams of getting off-world, becoming a pilot, and making his fortune in the galaxy with his childhood friend Qi’ra (Emilia Clark). These dreams are soon put on hold as Han is forced to join the Imperial Navy. Han dislikes war and serving the Empire, but he is soon court-marshaled for insubordination and desertion. However, he befriends and teams up with a ferocious Wookie named Chewbacca, and the two make their escape.\n\nDesperate and short of options, the duo join a thieving band of mercenaries led by Tobias Beckett (Woody Harrelson) in order to survive. The band of brigands are on a hunt for a powerful fuel source that can be sold illicitly on the black market. They are in debt to a powerful underworld criminal Dryden Vos (Paul Bettany), who orders them to take on the impossible task of stealing the fuel and then smuggling it back through hostile territory. Han agrees because he sees it as a way of redeeming himself to Qi’ra and wining back her affection.\n\nWhat follows next is an exciting, fast-paced heist that tests the courage and morals of the band as Han begins to become the scoundrel who fans are more familiar with. By the end of the film, Han has to walk a fine line between doing what’s right and surviving in this morally gray, dog-eat-dog galaxy.\n\nThe film received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans alike. It can be difficult to appease everyone while not upsetting the established nostalgia of a character already played so well by Harrison Ford. Due to the reshoots and rewrites, Disney felt it underperformed with an over-blown budget and only breaking even at the box office. I, however, was pleasantly surprised by the film. I’m definitely a fan of the franchise’s off-shoots like Rogue One and The Mandalorian.\n\nSolo is a fun film that adds depth to the ongoing legacy of the Star Wars universe. If you haven’t seen it yet, give it a watch.\n\nSolo: A Star Wars Story is available at the Union University Library. It is rated PG-13.\n\nIn 1999, the science fiction film style of cyberpunk was turned upside down with a revolutionary film that would come to define the genre for decades. This film was The Matrix, written and directed by a sibling team collectively known as the Wachowskis. The film is set in the dystopian future of a large city where people go about mundane and dogmatic lives. We are introduced to our protagonist, Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), who works as a computer analyst by day and a jaded internet hacker by night with the alias of Neo. He begins to question the order of things in the world and is puzzled by the reappearance of the phrase “The Matrix” online in hacker chat rooms.\n\nNeo agrees to meet with an infamous hacker know as Trinity, played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Trinity reassures him that the answers he seeks are held by a man named Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), but he must be prepared for the consequences. Neo is soon caught by the authorities led by Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). Smith warns Neo that Morpheus is a terrorist and the most dangerous man on the planet. Undeterred, Neo finally meets with Morpheus and his group of followers where he is giving a choice between two pills: one red and one blue. The red will answer his questions about the matrix, and the blue will make him forget and he can return to his normal life. Neo chooses the red pill, and the reality around him begins to distort. He then awakens in a nightmarish world but is soon rescued and brought aboard a hovering ship.\n\nIt is explained to Neo that his world is a simulation of the 21st century and, in reality, it’s closer to the 22nd century. Morpheus explains that, in the past, mankind went to war with an advanced form of artificial intelligence and lost the war. As a result, humans are now made to serve the machines as incubators for energy, and the Matrix was designed to give humans the appearance of a normal world to hide them from the fact that they are slaves to the machines. Morpheus and the few remaining humans unplugged from the Matrix believe that one day there will be a prophetic one who can defeat the machines and liberate humanity. Morpheus believes Neo is the one prophesied and begins training him for the conflict to come. Throughout his training, Neo questions Morpheus’s faith in him as he doesn’t feel special. But once disaster strikes, it falls to Neo and Trinity to attempt to save humanity from the machines.\n\nThe Matrix would go on to become a trilogy and spawn a multitude of spin-offs, graphic novels, and video games. The cinematic nature of the Matrix was ground-breaking for introducing cinema to a blend of high wire stunt chorography, Kung-Fu, and slow-motion cinematography aptly named “Bullet Time.” The themes expressed in The Matrix are as varied as they are transcending: the classic epic hero myth aspects of both Christianity and Buddhism, Platonic thought, and Utopianism.\n\nThe film review website Rotten Tomatoes still hold it at a solid 88% fresh. In 2012, it was inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant. The Matrix is a detailed film that will continue to be studied for decades. If you would like to re-watch this masterpiece or watch it for the very first time, I encourage you to do so. The Matrix is available at the Union University Library. Please note it is rated R for violence and some language."
