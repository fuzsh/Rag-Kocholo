        "text": "[upbeat music]\n\n[Martin] Taxi Driver.\n\nThen who the hell else are you talking to?\n\nYou talking to me?\n\nIt really goes back to Brian De Palma.\n\nHis independent cinema and Hollywood started saying,\n\nHey, maybe these indie films,\n\nthese kids could work in the industry.\n\nAnd so we were all out in L.A.\n\nand he introduced me to Paul Schrader.\n\nSchrader wrote Taxi Driver.\n\nTravis comes from his vision, but more psyche.\n\nI connected with it\n\nthrough Dostoyevsky's Notes from Underground\n\nIt was like enlightening, you know?\n\nAnd so for me, when I read the script, Brian gave it to me.\n\nHe said, You know, I don't wanna do it.\n\nI can't do it, but maybe you should do it.\n\nBut I didn't have enough, cache, as they say,\n\nat that time to make the picture.\n\nBut then they saw the rough cut of Mean Streets\n\nand they changed their mind,\n\nespecially when they saw De Niro in it.\n\nAnd so they said, for the two of you,\n\nwe could probably get this film made.\n\nWhy won't you talk to me?\n\nWhy don't you answer my calls when I call?\n\nYou think I don't know you're here?\n\nWe kept thinking in terms of the character\n\nand his loneliness and his acting out.\n\nNot condoning the acting out, but he does act out.\n\nAnd yet an empathy with him, which is really tricky.\n\nWe wanted to make it so badly, nobody would make it,\n\nthat we were thinking of going to different cities\n\nto make it San Francisco,\n\nbut the taxi driving wasn't the same.\n\nAnd we said, no, it has to be Manhattan.\n\nUltimately what stayed with us\n\nwas the psychological and emotional state of that character.\n\nAs we know now, tragically, it's a norm.\n\nEvery other person is like Travis Bickle now.\n\nFor me, the visualization of the movie\n\nwas to always try to keep you off balance,\n\nkeep the audience off balance.\n\nI felt that when he made that phone call,\n\nit was so painful where you shouldn't witness it.\n\nSo the camera should track away, but not pan away.\n\nIt should move completely to a hallway.\n\nAnd in the hallway you think somebody's coming,\n\nbut nobody's gonna come.\n\nNothing's gonna happen, we're all alone.\n\nBut we don't wanna experience\n\nthe depth of his pain at that point.\n\nAnd at the same time,\n\nthere's a sense of anxiety on the viewer.\n\nWhat's gonna happen in the hallway?\n\nWell, apparently nothing.\n\nThat was the first shot I came up with,\n\nI said, That's the style.\n\nThere's another thing too where the taxi pulls up\n\nat the beginning of the film into the taxi garage.\n\nThe taxi is coming in, we're panning with it as it comes in.\n\nAnd normally it goes this way\n\nand the camera would pan with it and it stops.\n\nWell, as it came in, I went the other way.\n\nAnd as we rested, the cab came in and stopped.\n\nWait, I'm supposed to be looking at the car.\n\nNo, we're gonna go another way.\n\nAnd so every shot, as much as possible,\n\nwas designed to be slightly disconcerting,\n\nbut ultimately, ultimately satisfying.\n\nThat was the philosophy of the shooting.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nGangs of New York.\n\nUs natives, born right wise to this fine land.\n\nOr the foreign hordes they're filing in.\n\n[mob shouting]\n\nWell, Gangs of New York comes out of\n\nthose cobblestone streets\n\naround that church on Mott Street and Mulberry Street.\n\nAnd also coming off the other element\n\nthat I grew up with really was the Bowery,\n\nat that time the Bowery was what you call now homeless.\n\nAt that time really, basically alcoholics,\n\nguys dying in the streets, basically.\n\nVery, very difficult place to grow up around and in.\n\nBut there was something about that Bowery\n\nand something about the neighborhood\n\nand the way the buildings were created and the cellars.\n\nThe cellars, there's so many cellars,\n\nand my father would talk about growing up there\n\nand going into one building, going down the cellar,\n\nand coming out two blocks away.\n\nRunning away from the cops or some of the guys, you know.\n\nIt had its own life, it was like an organism,\n\nand it had a history.\n\nWell then we got business.\n\nThat we do.\n\nAnd with Leo DiCaprio it was interesting\n\nbecause De Niro, we were acquainted with each other\n\nwhen we was 16 years old.\n\nSo because of my relationship with him\n\ngoing back to when we were 16,\n\nhe experienced what I experienced growing up.\n\nSo he's the only one I know who's around that,\n\nand who was working in that capacity,\n\nthat knows who I am and where I came from,\n\nand the world we were in.\n\nHe then called me and said, at one point,\n\nhe just made a film called This Boy's Life\n\nand he was working with this kid\n\nthat he cast named Leo DiCaprio.\n\nHe said, He's very good,\n\nyou gotta do work with him someday.\n\nAnd Bob never really used to tell me that,\n\nwork with somebody, you know,\n\njust we'd go from picture to picture if we worked together.\n\nDiCaprio liked our pictures, came together, and they said,\n\nyou've always wanted to do Gangs of New York,\n\nwe started it many times it got canceled.\n\nHere's our chance,\n\nthis kid Leo DiCaprio really likes your films,\n\nat least meet with him.\n\nAnd he was willing to go whatever I could do\n\nto make that film.\n\nSo that's how it all started with him\n\ncoming off of Titanic and a couple of other films.\n\nThen we convinced Daniel Day to get into it\n\nas a Bill the Butcher.\n\nAnd Daniel Day's a very intense and very specific actor.\n\nAnd what I love about working with him\n\nis that Daniel has a thing where if he starts,\n\nhe stays in that character.\n\nPeople think it's kind of a mystique,\n\nbut it really makes sense.\n\nAnd also 'cause if I'm talking to Bill the Butcher\n\nand in between takes it's Daniel,\n\nI'm still talking to Bill.\n\nHe stays in that character and he'll be,\n\none of the other actors Irish\n\nand he's not supposed to like the Irish and, you know,\n\nhe treats that person that way.\n\nI don't give a tuppenny fuck about your moral conundrum,\n\nyou meat-headed shit-sack.\n\nAnd they said, Why is he?\n\nThat's what that is, just, we're not playing.\n\nI mean, we're playing, but we're living it. [laughs]\n\nAnd so he is very good that way.\n\nDiCaprio's another way entirely\n\nand he comes at a character from every possible angle.\n\nAnd we find that with Leo,\n\nmost of the work is done before we shoot.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nGoodfellas.\n\n[Henry] As far back as I can remember,\n\nI always wanted to be be a gangster.\n\nGoodfellas was made 18 years after Mean Streets.\n\nSo I didn't really want to go to do another genre,\n\ngangster genre, right?\n\nI mean, there is no main character.\n\nI mean, Ray Liotta is a wonderful actor,\n\nbut he's like Virgil taking Dante through the underworld.\n\nThe real character in the movie is the underworld.\n\nAfter doing the film Last Temptation of Christ,\n\nwhen I got back, I owed Warner Brothers Goodfellas,\n\nor it became Goodfellas,\n\nit was called Wise Guys at the time.\n\nI didn't really, almost didn't wanna make it.\n\nIt was Michael Powell, the director of the Red Shoes,\n\nco-director I should say,\n\nand other masterpieces who read the script\n\nand insisted I make it.\n\nEvery shot may feel like a documentary,\n\nbut the camera moves, everything you see,\n\nit's all, clearly, it's all there in the script.\n\nWe had to stage bits of action,\n\nJoe Reedy did and Michael Ballhaus, my cameraman.\n\nThey worked out all the background action\n\nfor the long Copa Cabana shot.\n\nAll I said was, we start out in the front\n\nand he gives the guy the money.\n\nNext thing you know, we go through the thing,\n\nwe go through here, we go through here,\n\nwe go through here, you know,\n\nwe wind up on the famous comic, Kenny Youngman.\n\nEverything has to flow with no obstruction.\n\nHe's gotta impress her,\n\nthey sent him bottles of champagne, everybody knows him.\n\nThat's his height, so that shot had to be.\n\nAnd I wanted Joe Pesci to be in the film\n\nand I think he resisted it.\n\nI know he resisted it,\n\nhe said, I don't know, gangster stuff.\n\nAnd yeah, but Joe, I said,\n\nthis character's really interesting based on a real guy.\n\nReally funny, really funny.\n\nWhat do you mean I'm funny? [Henry laughs]\n\nAnd he said, Well, if you do it,\n\nI gotta tell you something.\n\nAnd I said, Well what is it?\n\nHe goes, Not here.\n\nAnd he acted out this scene that happened to him.\n\nI knew exactly where to put it.\n\nWe went through the scene over and over again,\n\nrecorded it all, each take,\n\nand then I created from the actor's improvisations\n\nand tried to make sure that it accelerated the right way.\n\nBecause the slightest change, you know,\n\nof like, Why am I funny?\n\nWhat do you mean I'm funny?\n\nOtherwise it would just be repetitious.\n\nFunny like I'm a clown, I amuse you?\n\nI make you laugh, I'm here to fuckin' amuse you?\n\nWhat do you mean funny?\n\nFunny how, how am I funny?\n\nAnd I decided we'd just do with two cameras.\n\nWe squeeze it in on a day that we wasn't scheduled.\n\nThe two cameras would be medium wide shots,\n\nbecause it was important to see, there are no closeups.\n\nIt was important to see Joe's character and Ray's character\n\nin relation to the people around them.\n\nAnd while the intensity builds,\n\nyou see the body language of everybody around them change.\n\nAnd it just happens.\n\nAnd I said, Well that's even better.\n\nYou know, so closeups, no, let's get outta here, you know.\n\nAnd we shot it in like an hour and a half, improvised too\n\nwith the bottle breaking on Tony Darrow's head\n\nand that sort of thing.\n\nHe had the nerve to ask to pay the bill. [laughs]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe Departed.\n\nThose guys you tuned up,\n\nthey're connected down Providence.\n\nWhat they're gonna do\n\nis come back with some guys and kill you.\n\nI always wanted to work with Jack Nicholson, be in a film,\n\nand I offered him the part and then he said,\n\nyou know, Gimme something to play.\n\nAnd he was right, because the way the script was\n\nin Bill Monahan's script, which was a very good script,\n\nbut the character of Costello was still presented as\n\nyour generic big shot gangster.\n\nHe hears this young kid in town\n\nwho just beat up somebody in a bar.\n\nHe calls him in, checks him out,\n\nand then he says, come and talk to me.\n\n'Cause he looks at him and says, Maybe I can use this kid.\n\nWe've seen that scene many times in westerns,\n\nin gangster films, because it's very truthful,\n\nthat's what happens.\n\nYou do it in business too.\n\nSuddenly you make a big hit with something\n\nand everybody calls you\n\nand they wanna see what you can do for them.\n\nIn this case, it's the underworld.\n\nAnd there was a scene\n\nwhere he's eating a lobster lunch, it said,\n\nin his apartment and he has this kid coming.\n\nThe basic line was, What can you do for me?\n\nYou wanna work with me, tough guy, what can you do for me?\n\nI'd seen that scene many times.\n\nAnd Nicholson said, What if, called me and said,\n\nWhat if while we're at lunch\n\non the table in a little plastic bag\n\nis a severed human hand.\n\nI said, Now that's a job interview.\n\nAnd you'd never mentioned it, don't even discuss it.\n\nWe went off on a whirlwind of the fact that\n\nCostello would be losing control\n\nand in a sense, losing his mind really.\n\nThat's something that was very controversial at the time.\n\nSome people went with it, some didn't.\n\nBut the thing was that I was around\n\na situation like that when I was growing up,\n\nwhere somebody very powerful,\n\nwho was eventually killed in 1968,\n\nwas in effect losing his mind and killing people.\n\nAn atmosphere of fear that I saw around that area,\n\nthat was what I wanted to capture in Departed.\n\nWorse than that,\n\nthese guys were all informers on each other.\n\nThat is true, in a world where everyone\n\nis informing on each other now.\n\nComplaining about the guy,\n\nOh, well he's out of his mind, he's overdoing.\n\nNo, that's, imagine, that's in effect what it would be like.\n\nYou're completely under his control\n\nand he's out of his mind.\n\nAnd that's what I feel the world is like right now.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nRaging Ball.\n\nHit me with everything you've got,\n\nI want you to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.\n\nYou're sure. Yeah.\n\nAll right.\n\n[blow thuds] Harder.\n\nThe '70s Studio system changed a great deal\n\nand the week that film was released\n\nwas the same week from the same studio\n\nthat Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate opened.\n\nThat and Raging Bull, Apocalypse Now,\n\nall from the same studio, United Artists.\n\nThat ended, what the '70s, they call this,\n\nyou know, golden age, that sort of,\n\nbut really it ended the power of the director in a way,\n\nin American filmmaking.\n\nAnd that had to come back through independent cinema\n\nin another way through the '80s.\n\nThe '70s was very much that way\n\nbecause things were wide open\n\nand we went in and we took it,\n\nlike the Barbarians at the Gate.\n\nAnd we transformed whatever we could, but they caught us.\n\nReggie Bull was a, we threw everything we knew into it,\n\nnot knowing how it was gonna be received.\n\nWe understood that people didn't like him,\n\nand even the crew, it turned out, I didn't know until later,\n\nwhy are we making a film about this guy, he's a horror.\n\nBut we stayed with it.\n\nThis man may be this way, but still,\n\nhe's a human being, he's got a heart, he's got a soul.\n\nBy the end of it, he finds some kind of peace with himself\n\nand maybe the others around him.\n\nAnd I think I was going there\n\nto try to find peace in myself.\n\nThat year there were,\n\nI think four more films coming out about boxing.\n\nThe Main Event with Barbara Streisand,\n\nPrize Fighter with Tim Conway,\n\nMatilda, the boxing kangaroo, and Rocky II also.\n\nAnd they were all in color.\n\nThat's when I realized that we should go black and white.\n\nAnd also the black and white would work\n\na distinctively different from the other boxing films\n\nthat were being made, comedies and Rocky II.\n\nAnd also Irwin Winkle pointed out to the studio\n\nthat the films that were made in black and white\n\nup to that point in the '70s\n\nwere Paper Moon and Lenny and they were hits.\n\nI also thought too\n\nthat the boxing scenes had to be very powerful.\n\nThe rest of the film, anything else was concentrated\n\nin an almost meditative state in terms of framing,\n\nholding those people in that frame.\n\nBut the boxing scenes\n\nwould be like you're on another planet.\n\nPrimarily it was based on,\n\nI came up with the idea when I was doing Last Waltz,\n\nbeing on the stage with the band\n\nand watching how the band worked.\n\nThe ballet sequences from Red Shoes\n\nwhere you don't really necessarily go head to toe\n\nwhere you see the dancer,\n\ninstead you see what's inside the mind of the dancer.\n\nWhat's in the mind\n\nand what's the perception of the fighter in the ring?\n\nThey don't even know where they are sometimes.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nThey're gonna need to send in\n\nthe National Guard of fuckin' SWAT teams,\n\n'cause I ain't going nowhere!\n\n[brokers cheering]\n\nAgain, like Raging Bull, I didn't wanna make it.\n\nBut I had to find my own way in it,\n\nand a lot of it had to do with style.\n\nThe style I felt originally was more like Goodfellas,\n\nI had done it, and I did it again in Casino.\n\nWhat more could I bring to it?\n\nAnd we found a way, and that was\n\nultimately through his character.\n\nAnd the whole idea of untethered capitalism,\n\nthis is the spirit of it.\n\nAnything goes because you're making money,\n\nit doesn't matter.\n\nNow, it's a little bit that way too in Casino,\n\nbut Casino has organized crime, it's a different thing.\n\nThis is organized another way.\n\nAnd so with that understanding,\n\nthen I was able to play with the structure of it\n\nand make it, right away,\n\nfirst three or four minutes of the film,\n\nyou could see right away\n\nthis is gonna be something unexpected.\n\nLike every other shot,\n\nthere's something shocking going on in a way,\n\nor supposedly shocking.\n\nIn order to do that, you have to have somebody\n\nwho's playing that part be prepared to do anything.\n\nAnd he did.\n\nI would provoke him, he'd provoked me, and we'd go further.\n\nIf you read the book, we could've gone even further.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nMean Streets.\n\nHey, what's the matter with this kid, huh?\n\nHey, there ain't nothing wrong with me, my friend,\n\nI'm feeling fine.\n\n[Patron] Keep your mouth shut.\n\nYou tellin' me that in front of this asshole?\n\nI was living in the late '50s and into the early '60s\n\ndown in my old neighborhood of\n\nwhat they used to call Little Italy.\n\nAt that time it really was Little Italy,\n\nfamilies were loving.\n\nBut you know, it was the tenements\n\nand it was a not a really good place\n\nand they were good people,\n\nbut at the same time it was steeped\n\nin a kind of organized crime.\n\nMean Streets comes out of that violence,\n\nwhich I missed by chance, really.\n\nNow's the time.\n\nI was with these people in this car,\n\nI told my friend who was with me and we were in the backseat\n\nand I said, Oh, it's two o'clock in the morning,\n\nthis is nonsense, let's go home.\n\nHe says, Yeah, yeah, okay, let's go home.\n\nThe car drove off and they got shot.\n\nHad to do with a lot of street power, so to speak,\n\na sense of certain rules that the underworld works with.\n\nAnd a lot of it had to do with, am I my brother's keeper?\n\nIt also reflects my father and his youngest brother.\n\nMy father was one of eight children,\n\nhis youngest brother was always in jail, always in trouble.\n\nAnd my father was always trying to broker situations\n\nwhere he wouldn't get killed.\n\nHe has about $30, it's always got on him, Michael.\n\nWhere's the rest? Yeah, where's the rest?\n\nThe extent to which one is your real brother\n\nor one is such a close friend\n\nthat you put yourself on the line\n\nis something that's really important to me\n\nin terms of how you live a life\n\nand try to live a good moral life\n\nbut you're in a world that is completely corrupt.\n\n[Narrator] You don't make up for your sins in the church.\n\nYou do it in the streets, you do it at home.\n\nAnd that's the essence of Mean Streets,\n\nthat's why I talk about in the beginning,\n\nyou know, you can go to church all you want,\n\nbut the real acting out of your morality\n\nis outside the church.\n\nIt's outside the building of the church,\n\nit's in the home, it's with your friends and that,\n\nall the rest is an illusion.\n\nI was five years old in New York, it was late '40s,\n\nwe had a television, 16 inch.\n\nOn Friday nights there was an Italian film shown\n\nfor the Italian American community.\n\nAnd my grandparents would come over\n\nand they didn't speak English, only Sicilian.\n\nAnd my mother and father and my uncles\n\nand we'd get around this little TV set\n\nand we'd see The Bicycle Thief.\n\nThey had these words on the bottom,\n\nthe people that were speaking in the film,\n\nthey were speaking the same way as my family.\n\nThose Italian films were more than cinema,\n\nthey were a form of truth that I related to because\n\nit somehow had something to do with who I am.\n\nAnd so no matter what I shoot, it isn't directly saying,\n\noh look, we're gonna do a shot now from The Bicycle thief.\n\nNo, it's the emotional and psychological impact\n\nof experiencing that film when I was five or six\n\nin the room with these people who lived it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe Irishman.\n\nI don't, I don't know, it sounds, it sounds funny.\n\nIt stops, it starts, it loses power.\n\nLemme see if I can give you a hand.\n\nOver the years seeing the difference in the technology,\n\nand one of the key things to give us the energy\n\nto make our first film, features,\n\nwas John Cassavetes doing Shadows in 16 millimeter,\n\nwhich came from France with the Aclier camera.\n\nSo all of that happening at that time\n\nmade it that we could make a film ourselves,\n\nwe didn't have to have the studio behind us\n\nwith giant lights and giant Mitchell BNCs.\n\nI've kind of stayed pretty much traditional.\n\nWe edit now with the computer,\n\nbut I don't really know how to do that, Thelma does it.\n\nIf I can utilize the new technology\n\nfor the kind of story I wanna make, why not go there?\n\nAnd so in the case of Irishman,\n\nDe Niro, and I had this idea for a long time.\n\nBut again, I didn't wanna do another gangster genre.\n\nPart of the problem was flashbacks.\n\nAnd by the time we got to do it,\n\nhe was too old to play his younger self.\n\nAnd they said, well, a different actor.\n\nAnd I said, Well then it's not like us\n\nmaking a film together, what's the point?\n\nAnd so we were talking about this idea of youthification\n\nand Pablo Herriman of ILM was with us\n\nand doing CGI or background material for us in Taiwan\n\nwhere we're doing Silence.\n\nAnd he came up and he said, I think I can do it.\n\nAnd what I have seen is that\n\npeople have to wear golf balls on their faces.\n\nYou can't have a scene with Joe Pesci\n\nand Bob De Niro and Al Pacino and whatever\n\nand they all have golf balls on their faces,\n\nand they're the kinds of actors\n\nthat kind of thing for this kind of movie, it doesn't work.\n\nAnd eventually by the end of the shoot of Silence\n\nhe had it and we did a test with Bob, with De Niro,\n\nand we tried it and we all felt strongly about it.\n\nThe drawback was financially,\n\nbecause it was extremely expensive, and also length of time.\n\nIt was an extra five to six months in the post-production.\n\nAnd that's when Netflix came in and really helped us.\n\nIt's not just CGI.\n\nWe accept it if a person puts on a fat suit\n\nor you paint their hair white\n\nwhen they're supposed to be old.\n\nBut what if you do it digitally?\n\nIt's like makeup.\n\nIt's just taking that leap of saying, oh no, it's gotta be.\n\nWhat, the old way?\n\nThis is now a transformation into a new way.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nSilence.\n\n[water splashing]\n\nThings that happened when I was making Last Temptation,\n\nthat took me only up to a certain point.\n\nI found myself wanting more and I found it in Silence.\n\nAnd when I read the book, I was in Japan actually,\n\nit was 1989, and I tried to write a version of the script\n\nwith my friend Jay Cox, by 1990, '92.\n\nBut I didn't get it and it took me years,\n\nanother 10, 12 years to live a life and experience\n\nwith different exploration, making Kundun, for example,\n\non the Dalai Lama, all of these things.\n\nAnd finally, by around 2006, 2007\n\nI was able to put the script together.\n\nI felt that we could do it.\n\nToo many technical business problems\n\nhad almost made it impossible to get made,\n\nbut eventually it did.\n\nAng Lee's group helped us, to shoot in Taiwan, you know.\n\nA special experience for the entire crew making the film.\n\nThe locations, the people, the scenes themselves,\n\nwhat the Japanese actors,\n\nI mean, it was really a kind of spiritual journey.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon.\n\nTheir time is over.\n\nThis has taken six years.\n\nWe didn't intend to take it six years,\n\nbut I was making The Irishman and then there was Covid.\n\nI was given the book and read the book\n\nand I was very excited by that.\n\nI didn't quite know how to go about it.\n\nEric Roth and I went through a process of a few years\n\nof pulling the script together and the story\n\nand there was some wonderful things in it.\n\nWe got it to a point where we said,\n\nlet's sit down and read this thing, I got some friends,\n\nand we sat down and Leah was there, Eric.\n\nIt was good, but there was something about it\n\nthat I felt we'd been there before,\n\nand that was the idea of a police procedural.\n\nAnd the character that he was supposed to play, Tom White,\n\nwas a character that is straight laced, you know,\n\nvery strong, very proper guy.\n\nAnd so we thought about it for another week and a half\n\nand then Leo came to me and he said,\n\nWhere's the real heart of this picture?\n\nI said, the heart is with this guy Earnest\n\nand his wife Molly.\n\nThe only problem is we don't know anything about Ernest,\n\neverybody else who've got tons of material on,\n\nwe don't know anything about 'em.\n\nSo we came up with the idea of\n\nwhat if instead of coming from the outside in,\n\nwhat if we go from the inside out?\n\nThen I said, oh yeah, the story really is\n\nthe relationship of Ernest and Molly and the betrayal.\n\nI said, the only problem there is that,\n\nit's creative problem, which is you take the script\n\nand you turn it inside out\n\nand how much of procedural do you need, not very much.\n\nIt started to come together,\n\nit gave me the direction that I felt comfortable in.\n\nThe other way I've seen the kind of movies,\n\nI enjoy doing it.\n\nImagine doing horses and running western tropes,\n\nin a way, they call it, I would love that,\n\nbut I've seen it and they did it so much better.\n\nEverybody else does it better.\n\nSo here though, you're in the house\n\nand there's a husband and wife and this guy is dodgy.\n\nHe's being manipulated\n\nby this sort of angel of death, his uncle.\n\n[thunder rumbling]\n\nYou know, you got, you got nice color skin.\n\nWhat color would you say that is?\n\nMy color.\n\nWe had been working on the casting for quite a while,\n\nincluding indigenous people.\n\nShe says, I have somebody I want you to see.\n\nBut then I saw the scene from Certain Women,\n\nKelly Reichardt's film.\n\nI thought she was wonderful.\n\nAnd after Covid we got to meet, I was struck by the,\n\nher whole visage, the face, and her intelligence.\n\nOne could see that there's a lot going on in her face,\n\nby her not doing very much,\n\nwhich is perfect for film acting.\n\nAlso the intelligence and level of understanding\n\nand coming from indigenous people and being an activist,\n\nwe could learn from her, which is what we did.\n\nAnd we all worked together, myself, her, and Leo,\n\nvery, very closely."
