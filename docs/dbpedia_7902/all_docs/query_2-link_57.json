        "text": "The G2 interview\n\n‘Sin is fun!’ Martin Scorsese on brutality, love – and his rebirth on TikTok\n\nAt 81, the great film director suddenly has a second career as a social media star. He talks about working with his daughter, the Oscar-nominated Killers of the Flower Moon and his journey from the mean streets of 1940s New York\n\nInterviewing Ray Liotta was a unique experience - he was an actor without pretence\n\nHadley Freeman\n\nThe Many Saints star was impervious to my attempts to butter him up – maybe his lack of air-kissing pretension is what stopped him becoming a leading man after Goodfellas\n\nWho is the best Oscar-winning supporting actor of all time?\n\nChristopher Walken? Joe Pesci? Heath Ledger? Our chief film critic names his champion from the nominees – and reveals who you selected as your winner"
