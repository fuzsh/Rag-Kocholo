        "text": "Regarded as one of the most prominent directors of all time, Martin Scorsese's work speaks for itself. Known for some of the best entries into the crime genre, his movies often explore the lives of Italian-Americans and brilliantly touch on subtle aspects of greed, guilt, revenge, and salvation. From Who's That Knocking at My Door in 1967 to The Irishman in 2019, his illustrious directorial career spans over 50 years. With the director turning 78 this week, there is no better time to commemorate his legacy and revisit some of his best work.\n\nTaxi Driver (1976)\n\nSetting the standard for psychological thrillers, this film follows a Vietnam war veteran in New York City, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), who suffers from chronic insomnia and thus, works as a taxi driver at night. During day time he visits pornographic theatres to pass the time and is often lost in thought about the constant degradation of society. His mental condition gradually declines due to which he convinces himself to play a part in making the world a better place. This development leads to him planning murders to liberate an underaged prostitute and a presidential campaign volunteer.\n\nAvailable to buy on Amazon Prime Video\n\nRaging Bull (1980)\n\nScorsese's biographical film based on boxer Giacobbe \"Jake\" LaMotta highlights two decades of his life, from 1941 to 1964. Nicknamed \"The Raging Bull', Jake (Robert De Niro) is a fierce fighter inside the ring but a short-tempered fellow outside of it. His potency during a bout stems from his relentless anger and frustration that he lives with every day. Full of resentment, Jake's life flourishes professionally, but his familial relationships turn sour, leaving him lonely and disturbed.\n\nAvailable to buy on Amazon Prime Video\n\nGoodfellas (1990)\n\nBased on the non-fiction book, Wiseguy, by Nicholas Pileggi, Goodfellas takes you into the life of organised crime in the mafia from the 1950s to the late '70s in New York. It follows Henry Hill and his two friends, Tommy DeVito and Jimmy Conway, who rise from common criminals into thoroughbred mobsters by carrying out dangerous heists. After a jail term, Henry sets on expanding a cocaine business against his boss' wishes and involves Tommy and Jimmy in it. They ultimately have to pay the price for their secret ambitions as they get tied up in a convoluted mess, putting their lives in danger.\n\nAvailable to buy on Amazon Prime Video\n\nCasino (1995)\n\nSam \"Ace\" Rothstein has everything a man could ask for—he runs a lavish casino in Las Vegas and is married to the beautiful, Ginger. However, beneath this superficial existence lies a world full of deceit and crime that is regulated by the mafia. Ace's position at the casino is also because of his association with the mob, and he tries his best to keep his overlords content. It doesn’t take long for things to start falling apart for him when his childhood friend, Nicholas \"Nicky\" Santoro, arrives in the city with grand plans of his own. The film stars Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nGangs of New York (2002)\n\nYoung Amsterdam Vallon thinks of nothing except avenging his father's death after a vicious gang fight in Five Points, New York. He is put in an orphanage but returns years later to a locality overrun by crime. It is 1863, and the American landscape is riddled with riots as the Civil War rages on. Amidst the carnage and chaos, Amsterdam sets his sights on his father's murderer, Bill \"The Butcher\" Cutting—leader of the most powerful gang in the area, the Natives.\n\nAvailable to buy on Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe Aviator (2004)\n\nWhen Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) inherits a fortune from his family, he uses the money to satisfy his extravagant passions that include directing a Hollywood blockbuster, Hell's Angels, in 1930 and investing in the aviation industry. The same year he successfully launches Transcontinental & Western Air (TWA) in competition with Pan Am airlines, owned by his rival Juan Trippe. But his financial success masks a silent battle with deadening phobias and depression, threatening to bring about an early end to his career. The film is a biopic, inspired by the actual life of Howard Robard Hughes Jr.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nThe Departed (2006)\n\nThe Departed opens with the Irish mob and the Massachusetts State Police at each other's throats as they try to find means to one-up the other. Mob boss Frank Costello secretly sneaks in a mole into the police force in the form of Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) and believes to have gained the upper hand. However, the authorities too assign officer William \"Billy\" Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) to enter Frank's crew. The situation soon turns chaotic when both sides discover the presence of an informer within their organisation.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nShutter Island (2010)\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong with two detectives investigating a case at a remote mental hospital for the criminally insane? According to this film, a lot of things. When US Marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule are invited to work a case at Ashecliffe Hospital on Boston's Shutter Island, they receive a very cold welcome. Teddy's traumatising past doesn't help his stay, but his excellent detective skills slowly uncover the sinister and borderline illegal treatments being carried out at the facility. As the layers of deception strip away, a shocking truth comes to light.\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nWitness the extreme highs and lows of the stock trading industry with the true story of Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). He along with his partner, Donny Azoff (Jonah Hill), start a brokerage firm and use their skills in trading as well as trickery to see it grow exponentially. With the huge influx of money, the duo lets loose and lives a life fuelled by sex, drugs and profanity. It doesn't take long for the FBI to catch Jordan's scent as his uncanny success in the stock market sees him labelled \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" by Forbes Magazine.\n\nStreaming on Amazon Prime Video\n\nThe Irishman (2019)\n\nAs World War II vet, Frank \"The Irishman\" Sheeran spends his last days in a nursing home, he reminisces about his life as a hitman for a criminal organisation. Working as a truck driver, he begins trading some of the material he transports with a local gangster and eventually has a run-in with the head of the Bufalino Crime Family, Russell Bufalino. Frank gets deeper into the criminal lifestyle as he starts running jobs for Russel, which include murder. He also gets involved with a powerful politician, Jimmy Hoffa and is later connected with his mysterious disappearance. The film stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci, and received 10 Oscar nominations.\n\nStreaming on Netflix\n\nAlso read:\n\n10 gripping crime shows you can stream on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ Hotstar and more\n\n10 women directors who deserve an Oscar nomination in 2021"
