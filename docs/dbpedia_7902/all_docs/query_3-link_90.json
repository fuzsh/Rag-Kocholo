        "text": "The first thing that strikes you when you go through Martin Scorsese’s entire narrative filmography is how, actually, it’s not all mob movies. The second thing is that despite that, actually, most of it is. Scorsese, the Italian-American film buff from Flushing, Queens, is the undisputed king of the crime film, but his career has consistently hit other notes and repeated subject matter. There’s the Catholicism he still devoutly believes in, the loners, the freaks and the weirdos and the great dirty metropolis that is New York itself. There’s a surprising penchant for period films and doomed romances. And, yes, there’s quite a bit of Robert De Niro.\n\nThe entire list is difficult to rival, even among other Hollywood titans; not counting documentaries or anthology segments, Scorsese has made some 25 feature films, each with its own flair, texture and neuroses. In honour of the man’s 78th birthday today, here’s the GQ edit of all of them.\n\n25. Boxcar Bertha (1972)\n\nThe then 28-year-old Scorsese’s second picture had all the thrilling violence of his later masterpieces, if considerably less of the style, and it boasted some pretty solid Hollywood names. David Carradine and his real-life partner Barbara Hershey starred as the two leads – train robbers on the run in the 1930s American South, Bonnie And Clyde-style – and legendary producer Roger Corman ran things behind the scenes, further establishing Scorsese as one of the enfants terribles of New Hollywood.\n\n24. Bringing Out The Dead (1999)\n\nDid you know Martin Scorsese had made a film about a strung-out paramedic who is haunted by the ghosts of the people he couldn’t save? And that said paramedic was played by Nicolas Cage? Nor do most people, as Bringing Out The Dead pretty much bombed at the box office, making roughly half its budget back. It’s dark, occasionally violent, often unnerving, but is it world-changing, genre-defining Scorsese? Perhaps not.\n\n23. Kundun (1997)\n\nScorsese has long been interested in faith and spirituality and from this point of view his decision to make a sympathetic biopic of the 14th Dalai Lama (that’s the current one, with the spectacles and the slightly annoying grin) makes a little more sense to anyone more familiar with the wise guys, boxers and corrupt elites who otherwise populate his films. Kundun was so unpopular with the Chinese government that it got Scorsese banned from visiting the country, apparently, and Disney, its distributors, soon got cold feet when faced with being frozen out of such a gargantuan market. Ever-principled CEO Mike Eisner was dispatched to swiftly denounce the film and Sino-Disney relations were restored. Thank God, or we might never have had the pabulum of the live-action Mulan to help us through this difficult year.\n\n22. After Hours (1985)\n\nOne of those films often cited as an underrated Scorsese release, After Hours is a screwball 1980s comedy, part of a brief subgenre known as the “yuppie nightmare cycle” – google it – that would see a Reagan-era hotshot thrown into various barely believable nightmare scenarios one after the other, usually over the course of 24 hours or so. Here, it’s a man named Paul, whose post-work date with a woman leads to his being threatened, assaulted and eventually even turned into a living statue. It sounds weird; it is. If there’s a Scorsese film you haven’t seen on this list, but which you should, it’s probably this one.\n\n21. New York, New York (1977)\n\nThis, the all-singing, all-dancing costume musical with Liza Minnelli and De Niro dedicated to Scorsese’s hometown, was somehow the film he made after Taxi Driver (see below). Scorsese cashed in some of the industry goodwill he had won with his previous film in order to experiment a little, conceiving of New York, New York as a break from his darker, grittier subject matter, but it was not a success, only just breaking even and leaving critics confused. Now it stands as more of a testament to the creativity and bravery of the man – rather than make “Taxi Driver 2”, he swung wildly away to try something new, even if it didn’t quite land.\n\n20. Who’s That Knocking At My Door (1967)\n\nNot only Scorsese’s directorial debut, but also Harvey Keitel’s first theatrical role, Who’s That Knocking At My Door already featured that classic Scorsese theme of Catholic guilt, albeit half a century ago and in black and white. It’s a relatively self-contained story: a young Italian-American man, JR, is troubled when he finds out his new girlfriend isn’t a virgin as he imagined, because she was raped by a previous boyfriend. Today, we have a broader terminology for this sort of subject matter – it would be classed as toxic masculinity or a real pig-headed, insecure machismo. For a film from 1967, it strikes a brilliantly nuanced balance between exploring JR’s ingrained, chauvinistic reaction and refusing to endorse it.\n\n19. The Color Of Money (1986)\n\nThe battle of wits between Paul Newman and Tom Cruise’s respective pool hustlers in The Color Of Money was more than just that: it was one Hollywood golden boy passing the baton to the next, as Scorsese set up Newman and Cruise to outdo each other to great effect. Muscular, hammy and occasionally vulgar like all the best 1980s flicks, The Color Of Money is a lot of fun, the very definition of a guilty pleasure.\n\n18. The Age Of Innocence (1993)\n\nScorsese revels in the luxury of Gilded Age New York, swapping the usual smoky streets and alleyways of the city for a world of crushed velvet, oil paintings and elbow-length kid gloves. That swap worked, helped not inconsiderably by the considerable talents of its central trio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. And The Age Of Innocence is the best proof of what we always knew: that whether he’s making a film about the mob or about 1870s upper-class courtship, there’s a secret streak of the romantic to Scorsese.\n\n17. Hugo (2011)\n\nThe one family film among Scorsese’s work (at least explicitly – you can show your ten-year-old Taxi Driver if you really want…), Hugo was a lush exercise in charm with a typically Scorsese film-nerd angle. A young Asa Butterfield plays orphan Hugo, a Parisian urchin who lives in the Gare Montparnasse until he encounters a mystery involving his late father and the early filmmaker Georges Méliès. As such, the film acts as a tribute to the pioneering directors of the 1910s and 1920s, many of whose work Scorsese’s own charity, The Film Foundation, is dedicated to preserving.\n\n16. The Aviator (2004)\n\nOne of the best films out there about how the obsessive drive to achieve something monumental can destroy a life, The Aviator charted the life and times of Howard Hughes, the businessman, film director and, yes, aviator. Hughes sought to build ever faster and more capable aircraft and break flight records even as obsessive compulsive disorder began to dictate his life and his various high-profile relationships with Hollywood actresses, including Ava Gardner and Katharine Hepburn, deteriorated in the face of his compulsion. It was the second Scorsese film to star Leonardo DiCaprio, a tour de force from the actor and arguably the film where their now decades-long collaboration really took root and began to flourish.\n\n15. The Last Temptation Of Christ (1988)\n\nWhatever claims to fiction it might make, it’s the Gospels, as a film; storytelling doesn’t get much more ambitious than that. Despite help from a Paul Schrader script, The Last Temptation Of Christ might have been too much even for Marty Scorsese to take on and almost three hours of scourging, crucifixion and “what ifs” about the life of Jesus later, it’s hard to feel anything but drained. Nonetheless, it was a bold undertaking that took real courage to attempt (Scorsese received death threats and there was even a fundamentalist Christian terrorist attack on a cinema showing the film in France). It’s probably not a film that would be made today for fear of causing offence. That, in itself, is a pretty commendable artistic undertaking.\n\n14. Shutter Island (2010)\n\nThere are few films that capture pure and total isolation with nothing but faith for comfort like Silence. Scorsese’s adaptation of Shusaku Endo’s novel about the Jesuit priests who travelled to Japan in the 17th century to convert the populace to Roman Catholicism, only to be met with extreme brutality, was a 20-plus-year passion project for the director. It was worth the wait; Adam Driver and Andrew Garfield are brilliant as the zealous young missionaries whose faith is tested as they are hunted through the misty, hardscrabble coastal villages of feudal Japan.\n\n11. The King Of Comedy (1982)\n\nRupert Pupkin spent much of his (fictional) existence in the shadow of fellow psychopathic Scorsese creation Travis Bickle until The King Of Comedy benefitted from renewed interest last year, with the release of Todd Phillips’ Joker. Phillips’ film owed many of its perverse nods and beats to Scorsese’s dark satire of celebrity culture, which followed Pupkin, a mediocre stand-up, in his delusional, obsessive quest to find fame on a late-night chat show.\n\n10. Cape Fear (1991)\n\nRobert De Niro’s vengeful ex-con Max Cady in Cape Fear is one of the great central characters in the Scorsese oeuvre and easily the driving force behind Cape Fear (De Niro was so dedicated to the role that he had his teeth filed down at his own expense to make himself look more threatening, then had them restored after filming). Much of the film’s conflict – between Cady and the well-to-do court-appointed lawyer he believes did not do enough to keep him out of prison – is prescient as to grievances felt keenly in America today. In showing the comeuppance of elites who are arrogant enough to pass judgment on their peers, and the unexpected fragility of the institutional power they wield, it’s the ultimate story of a criminal outsider viciously assaulting a system he sees as tilted forever against him.\n\n9. The Wolf Of Wall Street (2013)\n\nAs we all learned from Goodfellas (more on that later), the best films about criminals make you sympathise with them and pine ever so slightly for whatever it might be – the glamour, the thrill, the bank balance – about their life that appeals, before rudely pulling the wool from your eyes in the third act. The Wolf Of Wall Street did just that, tapping into that part of everyone’s brain that tells you, “Well, I know it’s technically illegal, but it looks like a lot of fun” with all the persuasive, manipulative force of a boxful of Quaaludes. It is, appropriately enough for two hours of pure, hypermasculine greed porn, one of the most pirated films ever. Consider that payback for all those doltish lads who for a couple of months went around thumping their chests and growling. On the plus side, it featured a huge amount of excellent 1980s brokerage pinstripe tailoring and plucked Margot Robbie from Antipodean obscurity, so we’ll let the humming thing slide.\n\n8. The Irishman (2019)\n\nThe most recent Scorsese film was very much of its time, released on Netflix and arriving on the back of Scorsese’s comments on Marvel’s, ahem, “theme parks”. At the same time, there are elements to it that seem timeless, at this point – it starred De Niro and Pacino and employed epic, multi-generation storytelling about the personal cost of crime. We’d seen it before and we loved it anyway. Is it as good a gangster film as Goodfellas or The Departed? Maybe not, but it comes pretty damn close (digitally de-aged De Niro struggling to curb stomp a man notwithstanding).\n\n7. Gangs Of New York (2002)\n\nScorsese’s first collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio is also the earliest incarnation we ever see of his beloved New York in a film directed by the man. In 1863, it’s a muddy clapboard slum riven by brutal factional fighting between Irish Catholic immigrants and the Protestants who have lived there for generations. When the moustachioed leader of the Protestant gang, Bill The Butcher (played with a touch of the absurd by an utterly terrifying Daniel Day-Lewis), knifes his dad to death in a mass brawl, young Leo sets out for revenge. The resultant film is a gory, nasty wonder.\n\n6. Casino (1995)\n\nRoughly the midpoint of Scorsese’s career, Casino is a film that seems to pull its various elements from a number of other Scorsese movies, while foreshadowing others to come. Even before The Departed (see below), it proved that Scorsese’s crime schtick could work when transplanted to a different locale from the Five Boroughs – in this case, Las Vegas. Even before The Irishman, Scorsese was expressing an interest in the teamsters union, whose pension fund was embroiled in the real-life casino skimming operation that Casino is based on. And then there’s the whole “crime might pay but it will destroy your relationships” angle that ran through Goodfellas, but which Scorsese leaned into more heavily here, as De Niro’s mobster, Sam Rothstein, falls for Sharon Stone’s stripper Ginger McKenna while running his Vegas establishment for the Chicago Outfit. Not as well regarded when it came out as Goodfellas, there’s a growing chorus of voices who would now claim Casino is actually the better film.\n\n5. Mean Streets (1973)\n\nMean Streets is the early, proto-Scorsese blockbuster in many ways. All the requisite ingredients are there, namely the New York mafiosi who grapple with the morals imposed by their rigid Catholicism, played by two of the three big-name actors the director worked with in the first half of his career. In this case, it’s Keitel and De Niro who star (Al Pacino is sadly absent). After the boilerplate sex and violence of Boxcar Bertha and the low-budget personal piece Who’s That Knocking At My Door, Mean Streets was the first time Scorsese found his own voice and had the cash to match it. He didn’t disappoint.\n\n4. The Departed (2005)\n\nAstoundingly, The Departed represents Scorsese’s only personal Oscar win from 14 nominations for Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Director (of course, actors in his films have won dozens). And even if it’s mad to think that the Academy judged Kevin Costner’s direction on Dances With Wolves to be better than Scorsese’s on Goodfellas in 1990, it’s not hard to see why he did finally win for this film in 2006. Everything is tight and punchy in The Departed’s rat-versus-rat set up, as the Boston Police Department and Irish mob try to race to uncover moles in their respective organisations. Based on the also excellent Hong Kong movie Infernal Affairs, but with added dick-swinging, foul-mouthed Bostonian cops and Southie mobsters who are only slightly less uncouth, it also has one of the best “guy says the name of the movie during the movie” moments in cinema.\n\n3. Raging Bull (1980)\n\nA rat king of entangled jealousies, sexual urges, desperate fury and violent rages (clue’s in the name), Raging Bull would easily be the best film of any other director’s career. It’s probably the best sports film ever made, if you accept that it’s really about sports, which is itself debatable. Yet Scorsese, addicted to cocaine in the run-up to the film’s production, thought it would be his last and he initially turned down the project even as De Niro repeatedly suggested he take a look at boxer Jake LaMotta’s autobiography with a view to adapting the book. After almost dying of a drug overdose, however, Scorsese relented and channelled his energy into Raging Bull; De Niro as LaMotta became a man sparring with his own troubles and inadequacies every time he stepped into the ring and the result was transcendent. Scorsese’s career was saved and the next 40 years are history.\n\n2. Taxi Driver (1976)\n\nWhat do you want us to say? It’s Taxi Driver, you should really know this. In a perfectly distilled vision of the filthy, crime-ridden New York of the 1970s, Scorsese has his central loner, De Niro’s Travis Bickle, seek existential meaning in an uncaring mass of concrete and engine oil. He comes to the eventual decision (to the extent that he ever really decides anything) to both assassinate a high-profile presidential candidate and rescue a child prostitute he encounters from her pimp.\n\nIt should never be the only measure of a film’s quality whether it is still “relevant” or “urgent” for filmgoers watching it 45 years down the line, but in this case it’s hard not to see it in that light. Bickle, the insomniac Vietnam veteran cast aside when society has no further use for him, is an angry husk of a man, who we might read in 2020 as a prototypical mass shooter or would-be neo-Nazi, if only he were to stumble into the right underground meeting or the right area of the internet. New York itself might have cleaned up, the brothels replaced by Starbucks and the dank dive bars charmingly scrubbed clean of any real edge, but that underlying darkness is still there in the shadows: the aggrieved Bickles are biding their time, waiting for the right moment to prove that, yes, violence is still what drives society forward.\n\n1. Goodfellas (1990)\n\nThere had been sweeping, multigenerational mafia epics before this, The Godfather being the very obvious example, but it was Goodfellas that finally realised the beautiful truth that mob stories could be told just as effectively as soap operas or Shakespearean tragedies. Scorsese took us into the heart of the Lucchese crime family and made it exhilarating, stupidly fun, dangerously macho... In fact, with the talents of (among others) “funny guy” Joe Pesci, it was hilarious at times and hilarity wasn’t a word that had been associated with gangster flicks much before Goodfellas.\n\nWhether it was chopping up garlic in a roomy prison cell with a razor blade and enjoying a glass of red wine or elaborately celebrating a wedding (replete with gaudy envelopes of cash), Scorsese made life in the mob look like a blast. The only difference between that and being a celebrity was that occasionally you just had to knife a guy in the boot of your car to keep things running smoothly. As far back as he could remember, Henry Hill wanted to be a gangster. The genius of Goodfellas was to realise that, when we really thought about it, so did we.\n\nvia gq-magazine.co.uk"
