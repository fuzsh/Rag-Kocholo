        "text": "Martin Scorsese is probably the most venerated film director alive. Therefore, there is little point in writing a review that points tries to point out flaws, or examine any kind of objective value in his latest movie. There is no denying the man’s filmmaking is effective, because it has impressed and meant so much to so many people, even if one doesn’t seem to feel much of anything when watching his movies. That is sadly my case. After years of dancing around the subject, I have finally concluded that Scorsese is not for me (though I really enjoy The Departed, weirdly enough).\n\nBecause he enjoys such high status as a master of the craft, I will always be interested in watching whatever he does next. For similar reasons, I have decided to not so much review Silence, as to simply point out how it fits into my overall indifference toward the director’s work. The thesis statement here is that Martin Scorsese’s cinematic interests are diametrically opposed to mine. I haven’t seen all of Scorsese’s work (and I do believe there is a movie of his that will some day gain my adoration), but I’ve seen enough to believe we have completely different world views.\n\nLet’s move on -finally- to the movie at hand. Silence is one of Scorsese’s biggest passion projects. He’s been wanting to make this movie since he read Shusaku Endo’s novel of the same name sometime in the eighties. Both novel and film tell the story of a young 17th Century Portuguese priest (here played by Andrew Garfield), who journeys to Japan with a mission. Yes, he is there to spread the gospel of Christ, to deliver His Truth, and to offer salvation to the locals. More specifically, though, he is looking for his master (Liam Neeson), who left for Japan with the intention to evangelize, but is rumored to have given up his faith when confronted with violent persecution on part of the Japanese government.\n\nOnce Padre Rodrigues (that’s the name of Garfield’s character) and his colleague Padre Garrpe (the great Adam Driver) step foot on Japan, they are confronted with the miserable reality of being a Christian in that country. Those who converted after visits by previous Padres must keep their faith a secret less they be punished and tortured, yet are extremely happy to once again be in the presence of “real” priests who can perform all holy sacraments and absolve them from their sins through confession.\n\nThe happiness doesn’t last long. Soon enough, the persecution catches up to our Padres, and most of the movie deals with how Rodrigues tries to reconcile the extreme suffering he witnesses on a daily basis with the belief that God has a mission for him, and that God is good and will reward those who believe and honor Him. Rodrigues’s faith is tested unflinchingly throughout this two and a half hour movie, and even in the darkest moments, Scorsese provides evidence that he hasn’t given up completely. That his faith will be the last thing to go.\n\nI believe Scorsese -who considered becoming a priest himself at some point in his youth- sees this as an exploration of what it means to believe in the grace of God, of the transcendence of belief beyond sacrifice. These messages are not lost on me, but the package in which they are presented -and my own personal experience with religion, I must admit- prompt me to reject them. I can’t help but see the last shot of this movie not as the small yet significant triumph it is intended to be, but as one last disappointment.\n\nThat ending -meant to be beautiful- makes me think of Silence as a tragedy about obstinate men who are unable to negotiate with those who believe something different. That is the thing about faith. It is immovable. And there is dogma. Isn’t there a certain arrogance in these priests and their quest? They come to convert, and the transaction seems to be one-sided. It’s the Europeans delivering “truth” to pagans, without dialogue or exchange. The priests teach their language, but do not learn Japanese. They teach the gospel but have no interest in learning local customs, or understanding Buddhist beliefs.\n\nAt the same time, what to make of the Japanese Inquisitor, whose purpose is to exterminate Christianity from his country? He is an obstinate man, too. He is a violent monster, and he is as closed off to debate and exchange -if not more so- than the priests. Of course, he sees the spread of Christianity as a product of a foreign culture creeping into his world. A cultural development that, given our knowledge about colonialism, he is probably right to fear. There has to be a level of irony to his name, knowing that the word Inquisition is most often associated to horrors that were committed on behalf of the Catholic church.\n\nIt is hard, then, for me to watch a film about white priests being persecuted in a foreign land, especially when we consider how Judaism and Islam have been treated in the west. Throughout their persecution, these priests are offered the option of renouncing their faith and moving on to a life in Japanese society. A life that -is suggested- will afford them with a level of security, comfort, and respect that most Japanese people wouldn’t be afforded if they tried to integrate to life in European society. It is very clear to me that this film was not intended as an examination of colonialism, but it’s hard not to make parallels.\n\nWhat this movie is -a tale about clinging to religion and faith throughout extreme circumstances- is far less interesting to me than other aspects that are touched upon but only mildly explored. Say, the intricacies and impossibilities of cultural exchange, the internal conflict and spiritual history of the Japanese Christians, or the tragedy that these must face because of their chosen faith. I see these Japanese believers as the true protagonists of this story. The priests strike me as villains who mean to save but in fact condemn the peasants.\n\nThis is what I meant when I said Scorsese and I are just too different. We were both raised in a Catholic environment, but religion meant different things to us. I’ve never felt comfortable in the church, and rejected it as soon as I hit puberty. It’s hard for me to see churches as something other than an enemy to society. I get such visceral reactions to it that I must constantly remind myself that religion is not an inherently bad thing, and that many people are better off because of it.\n\nMaybe I was not prepared to respond to a movie like Silence, which is so narrowly focused on one man’s journey with his faith. I have, in the past, responded positively to movies about religion. I absolutely loved the Coen Brothers’ Hail, Caesar! earlier this year, for example. The difference between the movies, of course, is that the Coens examine faith as it relates to modern secularity, setting their movie behind-the-scenes of a trivial Hollywood studio, while Scorsese uses literal Catholic iconography to tell a story about Catholic anguish.\n\nPerhaps I reacted better to Hail, Caesar! because its wager with faith struck me as more balanced. Because it is a movie about balancing the duties of faith with that which gives us pleasure. Silence is much more directly about holding on to faith, and not letting go no matter what is thrown at you. My personal beliefs are not based on faith, but on compromise and questioning. That is why I wouldn’t say Silence is a bad movie. I’d say that it was simply not made for me.\n\nI’ve been trying to make my way through the movies that have come out in the years since I was born in order to determine what is the best movie of my lifetime. A sisyphean task if there ever was one, but what can I say? I’ve run through the movies of 1992, 1995, and 2005 so far, and 2006 is up next. My archives say my favorite movies of the year back then were Pan’s Labyrinth, Little Miss Sunshine, The Prestige, and The Departed. Some things have changed since then. Earlier this year, I watched most* every movie from 2006 that seemed like something I would like. Here’s a list of my favorites.\n\n*I couldn’t get to everything I was interested in, most notably David Lynch’s Inland Empire, which I hear is phenomenal.\n\nThe Best Movies of 2006\n\n1. Children of Men\n\n(Dir. Alfonso Cuarón / 109 min. / USA, UK)\n\nAn expected, “fanboyish” pick, perhaps, but an uncontested one. There is no question for me this stands one step above everything I watched in preparation for this list. No one in their right mind could speak against the fantastic production design by Geoffrey Kirkland and Jim Clay, which creates a dystopian world rich in filth and despair, but those who dismiss Emmanuel Lubezki’s cinematography as the work of a show-off ignore how integral the camera work is in giving us the full picture of this carefully realized world, and the movie that holds entire untold stories in its background. And let’s not forget to praise the guiding hand of director Alfonso Cuarón for it’s his vision that morphs the movie from horribly depressing to deeply moving. The movie remains relevant, too, for finding hope in times that threaten to dive into deep darkness.\n\n2. Volver\n\n(Dir. Pedro Almodóvar / 121 min. / Spain)\n\nWhy ever make movies about men when you can make movies about women like these? Almodóvar assembles a masterful ensemble, including a never better Penélope Cruz and a heartbreaking Blanca Portillo, and leads them in a pulpy melodrama designed to celebrate traditions of womanhood passed through generations and see the women who honor them emerge triumphant in the end. Lust and vengeance fuel the plot, but the movie’s heart beats with the open and warm tenderness with which these women care for themselves. In this world, and the next.\n\n3. Half Nelson\n\n(Dir. Ryan Fleck / 106 min. / USA)\n\nThe relationship between a drug-addicted a high school basketball coach and history teacher and his young black student helps these two loners fight their demons and grow as people in the process. Sounds like the perfect recipe for indie-movie hell, but nothing could be further from the truth. Not only are Ryan Gosling and Shareeka Epps outstandingly natural in their roles, but the movie itself -led by the collaboration between Ryan Fleck and co-writer and editor Anne Boden- is subtler, and much more observant about the dynamics of race, class, and mentor-mentee relationships than practically any movie in its genre.\n\n4. Marie Antoinette\n\n(Dir. Sofia Coppola / 123 min. / USA)\n\nLike so many movies regarded as “disappointments” when they came out, Marie Antoinette has aged not only as one of Coppola’s best, but as much more fascinating and relevant than most any biography of a 18th Century queen could ever be. Neither a condemnation of a superficial rich girl, nor a humanization of a misunderstood historical figure, the movie is an examination of the power dynamics and ancient mores that define royalty and the role of women within it. Marie proves to be the perfect Sofia Coppola heroine, and Marie Antoinette the perfect candy-colored, fabulously-soundtracked film to draw a straight line from French Absolutism through Paris Hilton and Myspace to Kim Kardashian, Instagram, and Snapchat.\n\n5. A Prairie Home Companion\n\n(Dir. Robert Altman / 106 min. / USA)\n\nWhen asked to give a eulogy for a recently deceased friend, Garrison Keiller -playing “himself” in this “adaptation” of his popular radio program- says he’d rather not. His reasoning: when he dies, he wouldn’t want people to be told to remember him. That’s the kind of seemingly modest, private, Midwestern (I am told) attitude that defines Robert Altman’s last movie, which ironically, works quite well as a eulogy for the director of sprawling ensembles that represent American life. A Prairie Home Companion is both a silly and innocent celebration of old-fashioned values and entertainment, and a portrait of a group of people dealing with the fact that they’re being directly confronted by death and oblivion. It is better described as a musical comedy.\n\n6. The Fall\n\n(Dir. Tarsem Singh / 117 min. / USA, India)\n\nIt took director Tarsem Singh four years to complete the shooting of The Fall. Working mostly as the director of television commercials (including this classic), Tarsem took time during every shoot he had in a foreign country to get his crew together, and film a little of this movie in the most photogenic places all around the world. The result is an overwhelmingly gorgeous movie, perhaps the most beautiful-looking I have ever seen. All of this imagery is framed by the story of an injured stunt-man and the cutest little Romanian girl who are staying at the same hospital in 1910s Los Angeles. The movie has its weaknesses, but just one glimpse at the gusto with which indulges in the beauty of images will be enough to convince anyone that watching The Fall is, quite literally, a unique experience.\n\n7. The Prestige\n\n(Dir. Christopher Nolan / 130 min. / USA, UK)\n\nHave you ever noticed that the structure of the magic trick explained by Michael Caine in the opening narration actually perfectly reflects the structure of the movie? Of course you have. Nolan fanboys won’t shut up about it. The thing is, they’re not wrong when they say The Prestige is a perfectly assembled movie. They only might be wrong, depending on whether or not they think it is a particularly profound movie. Because it is not. But who cares if a movie is profound when it is this much fun? This is undoubtedly the most fun Christopher Nolan has ever let himself have as a filmmaker, and it shows in a movie that bleeds with the pulpy heart of a nineteenth century science fiction periodical. A rock solid script, well-paced editing, and a number of awesome choices like casting David Bowie as Nikola Tesla make this an immensely enjoyable movie, and still the best work of Nolan’s career.\n\n8. Ten Canoes\n\n(Dir. Rolf de Heer, Peter Djigirr / 90 min. / Australia)\n\nAlong with The Fall, this legendary comedy about sibling jealousy set in ancestral Australia is half of a fantastic double-feature about story-telling. This time, we are dealing with the culture and humor of one of Australia´s many aboriginal traditions. If you appreciate the ability that movies have to transport us into the minds and hearts of people with different backgrounds from our own, then you will surely appreciate Ten Canoes, and the way in which it avoids any kind of pedagogical or over-didactic messaging, and instead dives right into being the product of a culture recognizably different from most anything we’ve seen in film before. And it’s an incredibly accessible, funny, and creative product at that.\n\n9. Superman Returns\n\n(Dir. Bryan Singer / 154 min. / USA)\n\nDeeply misunderstood and dismissed at the time of its release (even by me, who, in my defense, was only fourteen years old), Superman Returns is a window into all that the things we lost, and didn’t know we would so badly miss, about superhero movies. To put it bluntly: melodrama in superhero movies is better than edgy realism in superhero movies. As the Marvel machine keeps churning out one acceptable yet soulless spectacle after another, I yearn for a sign of anything in them that will move me as deeply as the relationship between Lois and Clark in this movie. I know I’m in the minority, but I want more open-hearted romance and silly heroism. That is why I will forever defend Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone’s relationship in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and the infamous “Martha” scene in Batman v. Superman. Melodrama forever!\n\n10. The Departed\n\n(Dir. Martin Scorsese / 151 min. / USA)\n\nI have a notoriously rocky relationship with Martin Scorsese. I never quite “got” the director that most cinephiles regard as one of the greatest in history.From the overwhelmingly repetitive and indulgence of The Wolf of Wall Street to the simplistic macho-rebel philosophy of Taxi Driver, I have rejected lots of his most beloved work. The Departed, on the other hand… How can I resist a movie this exciting? You get a twisty thoroughly fun story, an ensemble cast full of amazing performances (Matt Damon and Alec Baldwin are the clear stand-outs), and most importantly, Scorsese having some goddamn fun for once in a while. The M.V.P., obviously, is Thelma Schoonmaker, who cuts the shit out of this movie and makes a two-and-a-half mammoth feel like the leanest, meanest populist entertainment in town.\n\nHonorable Mentions: Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan, Little Miss Sunshine, Away from Her, Offside\n\nJust one week before the 1995 Project is over…\n\nLa Cérémonie (directed by Claude Chabrol)\n\nChabrol was one of the pioneers of the French New Wave, as important a movement as any in cinema history. I must admit I was completely unfamiliar with his work before watching this movie. Based only on this movie, he strikes me as a very European director, and not necessarily as cinematically revolutionary as Godard or Truffaut. La Cérémonie fits very well into the tradition of European (particularly french) dramas that deal with class tensions brewing. Sandrine Bonnaire stars as a newly hired maid at a country estate, and Isabelle Huppert is the radical young woman who sparks her standing up to the family she works for.\n\nIt’s a surprisingly uneventful movie as a thriller, and cold as a romance. It is something much more opaque, and that’s a good thing. It’s interesting not knowing exactly what side Chabrol is on. It’s fun to wonder whether this is a story about social justice, bourgeois fears, or young passionate romance. The disappointing part comes in the characters’ psychology which is too opaque to give us enough clues as to what is going on. Bonnaire and Huppert do a great job, but as much as I want to dissect the movie, I don’t think it gives me the necessary tools to do so.\n\nCasino (directed by Martin Scorsese)\n\nTime for an unpopular opinion: I think Scorsese might be the most overrated director that has ever lived. That might be a little extreme, but the truth is most of his movies don’t do much for me. This is particularly true when we talk about what I call his “success and excess” trilogy: Goodfellas, Casino, and The Wolf of Wall Street, a triumvirate that suffers from the same ailments while looking at the luxurious corruption of the American dream through the prism of organized crime and the stock exchange.\n\nThe biggest flaw with these movies is that you don’t really need to see them to know what they’re all about. They take three hours to make the most obvious and predictable points you could make about the kind of characters they are depicting. There is nothing the movie tells me that I didn’t know it was going to tell me before watching it. In the case of Casino in particular, I don’t think there is any point in the movie that hasn’t either been made before, or made in a better way since. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci do solid work, and some sequences are fun, but the best movie about Las Vegas released in 1995 is obviously Showgirls.\n\nAlso, the way Don Rickles is underutilized in this movie is a crime.\n\nDead Man (directed by Jim Jarmusch)\n\nSometime around the second half of the twentieth century, Hollywood stopped producing western en masse. That’s the moment when every western made by an American director became a piece of commentary not only on the cowboy genre, but on the history of America as a whole. Of all these revisionist westerns, Jim Jarmusch’s Dead Man offers the most unique take on the history of America and the frontier of the wild west. Johnny Depp stars as an accountant from Cleveland who travels out west to accept a job that is not being offered, become an accidental outlaw, and be chased through the wilderness until he finds his way to the next life.\n\nAided by beautiful black and white cinematography by Robby Müller and an anachronistic guitar score by Neil Young, Jarmusch turns the Old West into a land of contemporary sensibilities, of rough men who are as aware about mundane life and celebrity as the audience watching. The most obvious point of comparison is Pilgrim’s Progress -taking into account the main character is named William Blake- but does this journey really lead anywhere? This is a fatalistic, anachronistic, and darkly hilarious movie. Needless to say, the movie ends with death, but it is neither tragic nor heavenly. Jarmusch loves to make movies about empty lives. In this case, he made a movie about an empty country.\n\nIt’s not that I don’t like Taxi Driver. I do. But sometimes a movie is so widely praised and universally beloved that, even if you do like it, not exactly seeing the greatness of the thing still makes you feel like you’re not part of the group. I’ve read the raves, and I think I get what’s going on in Taxi Driver, but because I don’t love it, I think I just don’t “get” Taxi Driver. But since Nathaniel picked this beloved classic as this week’s “Hit Me With Your Best Shot” subject, I decided that searching for the one shot that encapsulates the movie might be the kind of experience that would finally make Taxi Driver click for me. Did I succeed? Well…\n\nTo me, Taxi Driver is the tragic story of a man who is pushed out of the system, and a system that cannot (or is not interested in) finding a way to help the people who are being crushed within it. Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader are not the first ones to craft such a narrative. There is Büchner’s Woyzeck, and more closely related to the decadence of 1970s New York you have Edward Albee’s The Zoo Story. In Büchner’s play, Woyzeck is a sort of Cassandra figure, who constantly shows signs of the toll his life is taking on him, but nobody listens to. In Albee’s play, Jerry describes in excruciating detail the horrors of his life as an outcast New Yorker.\n\nBecause it was directed by one of the most celebrated directors of our time, and one of the few who is known precisely for being a huge cinephile, I expect Taxi Driver to provide an inherently cinematic way of dealing with this narrative. There is certainly ambiguity to how we should feel about Travis Bickle and his deadly crusade. I believe that the filmmakers intended him to be a tragic product of the system, but you mostly see the results neglect has had on Travis, and not the neglect itself. We hear he can’t sleep after coming back from Vietnam, but we are never sure if the world around him turned him this way, or if something was broken inside of him all along.\n\nWith those thoughts in mind, I found a moment that presents an alternative way of looking at the movie. Is Scorsese maybe trying to turn the mirror in our direction? There is a moment when Travis goes to the movies by himself. First, he finger-shoots the screen a couple of times. Then, he sits back and watches the movie, but he puts his hand in front of his eyes, as if they were blinds through which he is watching the screen. It’s voyeurism, and he’s the audience. It’s one of the moments in the movie that comes closest to finger-pointing. To turning to the audience and telling us that if we don’t see what turned Travis into such a piece of work, it’s because we don’t want to look at our own flaws. We don’t want to look at him, but we can’t stop looking. We delight in Travis’s tragedy. We don’t want to save him, we want him to die a bloody death at the end of the movie. I mean, it does make for better cinema.\n\nIf there is something I love as much as I love movies, it’s probably podcasts in which people talk about them. I think I spend more of my week listening to these fine programs, than I do actually watching movies, so I thought I’d start this new feature, in which I will highlight a particularly good episode each week, as well as a quick round-up of what was going on in some of my favorite podcasts.\n\nPodcast of the Week:\n\nThe Canon just released its first episode this week, and I must say that it’s a very promising start. Hosted by Devin Faraci (from Badass Digest) and Amy Nicholson (from L.A. Weekly), the premise of the show has them picking a movie every week, and discussing whether or not it belongs in “the canon”, the list of movies considered to be the cream of the crop of filmmaking. They also put the decision of whether or not the discussed movie should be considered canon in the hands of the listeners, who can vote online. Pretty fun, huh? This first episode had them arguing about Martin Socrsese’s Goodfellas. Devin loves it, while Amy finds it incredibly overrated. This is not specified in their description of the show, but I think they will usually talk about movies they disagree about (there is lots of shouting and interrupting each other in this podcast, in case you get stressed out by that kind of thing).\n\nI’m not incredibly familiar with Faraci’s work, but from what I’ve read, he and I have very different tastes in movies. I also have a fairly different taste from Amy Nicholson, but I can’t help but find her particular point of view to be fascinating, even when she’s dissing movies I love. As far as this episode is concerned, I think Amy raises some incredible points, but then again, I’m one of those people who never found Goodfellas that amazing to begin with, and who is going through a phase in which I’m starting to think Scorsese *gasp* might not be that great a filmmaker after all. Anyway, if you want to decide for yourself if Goodfellas does or doesn’t belong in “the canon”, head over and listen to their show. I definitely recommend it.\n\nMovie Podcast Round-Up:\n\nBattleship Pretension. Probably my favorite film podcast, this wasn’t a particularly exciting week as far as my personal enjoyment is concerned. This is basically their Halloween episode, as David and Tyler have independent filmmaker Danny Valentine to discuss horror movies from the 80s. Horror is one of my least favorite genres, so I’m very lacking in knowledge about the topic they were talking about. That being said, this show is always insightful, and there is a lot of very interesting discussion about Danny’s life as an independent filmmaker.\n\nFighting in the War Room. Joanna Robinson takes the reigns this week, and what seems to be her last week with the show. The big topic is the current state of the Romantic Comedy. It’s an entertaining episode, as usual, but not a particularly great one (these guys can get into better, more heated, discussions). Meanwhile, the Review segment, which deals mostly with Interstellar, but also a little bit with Big Hero 6, raises some very interesting arguments.\n\nThe Film Experience Podcast. You can always count on Nathaniel and his co-hosts to bring fresh takes to movies you think have been talked to death. This time, they do a pretty awesome job of discussing Birdman, with Nathaniel loving it, while Joe Reid has major reservations. And they made me very interested in seeing Pride, a British independent I had heard about, but wasn’t particularly excited about.\n\nFilmspotting. They review Nightcrawler, which I haven’t seen, so I don’t have much to say about this episode, except that it didn’t make me particularly excited to watch the movie, which you can interpret whichever way you want. Their poll question this week, however, asks what filmmaker you think could direct the next 2001: A Space Odyssey, so I’m definitely gonna vote, even if my answer (Jonathan Glazer) is not one of the options.\n\nPop Culture Happy Hour. Like the name of the show suggests, the conversation is not always about movies, but this week, Linda Holmes and friends talk about Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar, as well as other “realistic” science fiction movies. A lot of good points are raised, especially by Glen Weldon, who is as funny as always, as he points out that the genre i called “science fiction, not science boring”.\n\nThere is no question Martin Scorsese is one of the best filmmakers that ever lived, and because we know this, we go into his movies assuming he’s got something special to say. Granted, he does have something to say in all his films, but I we might be cutting him too much slack. I remember the passionate reaction to Hugo, a movie that does have a sweet and heartfelt message, but whose first half is dull and dispassionate. It seems to me like the same thing is going on with The Wolf of Wall Street. People are raving like crazy about it, calling it a masterpiece and one of Scorsese’s best. Now, there’s some good stuff to be found in The Wolf of Wall Street, but I wouldn’t call it a great film.\n\nThe plot of the movie isn’t really important. It’s basically Goodfellas set in the world of Wall Street. Leonardo DiCpario stars, in his fifth collaboration with Scorsese, as real-life broker Jordan Bellfort, a young man who dreams of making it big in the financial world, gets corrupted reasonably early and becomes a rich son of a bitch. After Django Unchained, The Great Gatsby and now this movie, Leonardo DiCaprio seems to have moved on from his “guy who has a death wife” phase and gotten really into playing petty characters that are obsessed with money and power. I certainly don’t mind, since he is much, much better at playing these kinds of characters. His performance in Wolf of Wall Street is probably the best work he’s done since Catch Me If You Can (which I still think is his best work). Apparently DiCaprio is the one who approached Scorsese with Bellfort’s story, and judging from the level of commitment in his performance, I believe him. Perhaps the single best moment of acting DiCaprio has ever done comes midway through the film, in a scene that takes place late at night at a country club which I’ll only refer to as the “lemmons” scene for those who don’t want to be spoiled. It is one of the best comedic scenes of the year and it all hinges on Leo’s talent.\n\nThe movie is a comedy, and it is never better than when it goes all in on being as absurd and over-the-top as it can. A lot of the comedy lies on Jonah Hill, who plays Bellfort’s main business partner, but Scorsese has wisely assembled a talented cast full of funny people. A great example of this is an early scene in which Matthew McConaughey gives a speech that rivals James Franco’s Spring Breakers monologue in insane hilarity. The movie uses its comedy to be a sort of expose on the depraved and morally sickening world of Wall Street. There are more bare breasts and cocaine than you’ll want to see, and in its immature frat-boy style of humor, it ends up having a much more realistic and mature look at the world of New York’s financial district than something like Oliver Stone’s Wall Street, and especially more than its atrocious sequel.\n\nSome people, as it always happens with a movie like this, have complained that the movie glorifies the debauchery of this outrageous lifestyle. After watching it, though, it seems obvious to me that the film’s main purpose is to condemn this behavior, but I do think it’s interesting to question its ways. This is not really a satire, since the things that go on in the movie are lifted from the memoir of the real life protagonist. This shit really went down, and the fact that it is so absurd and stupid makes me all the more enraged about the whole stoke exchange system and the crooks that get rich off of it. Is this reaction what DiCaprio and Scorsese were going for? What about the author? Like i said, the movie is based on Bellfort’s memoir, and the man even makes a short cameo appearance in the movie. What does this tell us about the movie’s views? On the same note, I want to point out to the movie’s last scene involving an FBI agent played by Kyle Chandler. What is that scene trying to tell me?\n\nThose are a couple of elements that I can’t fully figure out yet. This is not a problem, though. If anything, this kind of moral ambiguity makes the film richer and more fun to think about. What’s also interesting is that this makes it three movies that have come out this year and are basically period pieces about people trying to make it big in America through criminal activity. The others being David O. Russell’s American Hustle and Michael Bay’s Pain & Gain. Now, of the three, I think the most interesting is Pain & Gain, thanks to its idiosyncratic and sickening point of view. For all its commitment, I think the people that made The Wolf of Wall Street are still a little too detached from the material. It works, but there is something missing. With movies like Pain & Gain or Spring Breakes dering to go deep into a nightmarish perspective, something like The Wolf of Wall Street feels cold and detached in comparison. It’s funny and gets the job done, but it’s just not as exciting.\n\nGrade: 6 out of 10"
