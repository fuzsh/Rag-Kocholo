        "text": "Auteur Directors\n\nDirecting\n\nBest Martin Scorsese Films — His Entire Filmography Ranked\n\nMartin Scorsese is the true king of cinema. While most filmmakers are lucky to have just one film that stands the test of time, Scorsese has had hit after hit across five decades. Saying “the best Martin Scorsese films” is like saying “the best chili cheese fries” because even when they’re not the greatest, they’re still pretty darn good. All Martin Scorsese movies have been accumulated here and ranked. While there are several that could easily take the top spot, there can only be one winner. Join us now for StudioBinder’s ranking of the best Scorsese movies ever.\n\nNOTE: For this list, we’re only looking at narrative features he’s directed. He’s helmed numerous documentaries over the years, many of which are fantastic (check out The Last Waltz). But we’ll just focus on his 26 feature-length narrative films for this list. Let’s dive in.\n\nWatch: How Scorsese Shot Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nSubscribe for more filmmaking videos like this.\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\n26. Boxcar Bertha (1972)\n\nJulie and Roger Corman Talk Boxcar Bertha • UHWO\n\nAfter seeing Boxcar Bertha, John Cassavetes told Martin Scorsese, “You just spent a year of your life making a piece of sh*t.” While it may not be the worst film ever made, you can see some rookie mistakes. It doesn’t have that polished look that Scorsese movies would become known for.\n\nIt very much feels like a training exercise for the fledgling director, so some harsh criticism may have been exactly what he needed to become the director he’s known for today.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nBoxcar Bertha has really fallen to the wayside in the context of the Martin Scorsese filmography. You can see some glimmers of what was to come, but he never really got the chance here to showcase his own style.\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE BEST MOVIES\n\n25. New York, New York (1977)\n\nCommentary With Martin Scorsese • New York, New York\n\nFrank Sinatra’s hit song “New York, New York” is actually a cover of a song Liza Minnelli sings in the film of the same name. And honestly, that song’s about the only thing worth salvaging from this film. It blends together a classic musical with hard realism, which doesn’t always make for a pleasant combination. Listen to the soundtrack, but skip the movie.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nNew York, New York is an interesting watch to see how Scorsese blends together two disparate tones. However, between his hits of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, it’s a major misstep.\n\nBEST SCORSESE MOVIES\n\n24. Who’s That Knocking at My Door? (1967)\n\nMaking of Who’s That Knocking at My Door?\n\nQuentin Tarantino has said he’s drawn a lot of influence from Scorsese’s work. Other than the violence, it can be hard to see other than in Who’s That Knocking at My Door? It’s basically Scorsese’s student film featuring characters who have long, drawn-out conversations about old cinema.\n\nIt feels like something Tarantino would have made in the '60s, which sounds intriguing, but in this particular film, it never truly rises to the occasion.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nFilm students should aspire to make a first project as well as Who’s That Knocking at My Door? However, in the grand scheme of the Martin Scorsese filmography, it just feels undercooked.\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES LIST\n\n23. Bringing Out the Dead (1999)\n\nMartin Scorsese Interview • Bringing Out the Dead\n\nIf there’s one thing you pick up from watching a lot of Martin Scorsese movies, you realize the man cares deeply about the spiritual nature of man. Sometimes he tries to go for the transcendent, but other times, he wants to dive deep and show us someone on the brink of mental collapse.\n\nThat’s Bringing Out the Dead in a nutshell, which takes a Taxi Driver-esque look at a paramedic who’s too worn out from losing and saving lives over his career and how he slowly descends into oblivion.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nNic Cage and Martin Scorsese are a surprisingly good combination. However, after watching, you kind of just wish you had watched Taxi Driver instead.\n\nRANKED MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES\n\n22. Shutter Island (2010)\n\nShutter Island: Why Perspective Is Everything • Storytellers\n\nIt’s understandable why people want to avoid spoilers, but for our money, watching Shutter Island is better when you know the twist at the end. It allows you to fully grasp the themes of a man dealing with terrible guilt when you know where it’s all heading.\n\nThe acting choices make more sense, and you honestly get more out of the experience. It may be predictable, but a Scorsese thriller is never a bad thing.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nShutter Island is visually stunning. It’s a pretty thriller, but when you look under the rug, you’ll find there’s not much else there.\n\nTOP MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES\n\n21. Kundun (1997)\n\nMaking of Kundun\n\nScreenwriter Melissa Mathison was granted the privilege to sit down with the Dalai Lama to interview him about his life, and those conversations served as the basis for Kundun. Even though it feels like the least “Scorsese-y” movie on this list, it does deal with themes the director grapples with often.\n\nThe film may keep its central figure in the distance, but the beauty and care Scorsese held while crafting the visuals cannot be understated.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s incredible that a talent like Scorsese can make a film like Kundun in addition to his usual type of film like Taxi Driver or The Irishman. It’s a visual achievement even if the plot doesn’t do those visuals justice.\n\nBEST FILMS MARTIN SCORSESE\n\n20. The Color of Money (1986)\n\nPaul Newman Interview • The Color of Money\n\nPaul Newman was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor in The Hustler in 1961. 25 years later, he’d return to the role and finally win that Oscar, and unfortunately, that feels like the only reason this movie needs to exist. Scorsese’s direction is stellar for the belated sequel, but you can’t shake the sense his sensibilities would be better suited for something original.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Color of Money isn’t a bad film by any means. It would be a top tier film for most other directors, but Scorsese could do so much better.\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES LIST\n\n19. The Departed (2006)\n\nThe Hidden Meaning of “X” • The Take\n\nAny time a character in The Departed is about to die, they’re marked with an “X.” It’s tiny details like that which really elevate a film, and this crime thriller that finally won Scorsese a Best Director Oscar is a cut above the usual gangster shoot-em-ups. It’s held up decently over the years despite the hilarity of hearing these characters pronounce “microprocessors” in thick Boston accents.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nMartin Scorsese’s Best Director win for The Departed felt like a celebration of his body of work rather than this one individual film. Still, it’s an enjoyable film and one of Scorsese’s most rewatchable gems.\n\nANALYZING MARTIN SCORSESE BEST FILMS\n\n18. The Aviator (2004)\n\nScene Comparisons • The Aviator\n\nTo ensure the portrayal of OCD (so often mocked in films and television) was accurate in The Aviator, Scorsese worked with Dr. Jeffrey M. Schwartz, MD at UCLA to create a more accurate portrayal. Not only was the mental illness brilliantly portrayed on screen, it led to a more dynamic performance from Leonardo DiCaprio in one of his best roles ever. It’s a different kind of Scorsese picture for sure but a welcome one.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nMartin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio are at the top of their respective crafts in The Aviator. It plays fast and loose with the details of Howard Hughes’ life, often skipping rapidly from one life event to the next, but you may be so wrapped up in the performance you won’t care.\n\nSCORSESE BEST MOVIES, RANKED\n\n17. Gangs of New York (2002)\n\nExploring the Sets • Gangs of New York\n\nMartin Scorsese first came across the inspiration for Gangs of New York, a 1927 book, in 1970 and had to wait 30 years to finally get it made. He was still a young director upon discovering the work, but it just goes to show what kind of impact it had on the fledgling director. It also speaks to his craft that he didn’t rush production. He envisioned an epic, and he waited until he was finally at a place in his career where he could name his price.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nScorsese’s passion for the source material is on clear display. It’s just a shame the various mechanisms at play don’t add up as well as they should.\n\nLIST OF THE BEST SCORSESE MOVIES\n\n16. The Age of Innocence (1993)\n\nStrange Scorsese: The Age of Innocence • Fandor\n\nScorsese proves his skills as a director with The Age of Innocence. Most people associate him with violent gangster pictures. But underneath all that, it’s clear he’s more interested in exploring how people can thrive in a world determined to strip them of their free will.\n\nIt goes to show all aspiring filmmakers out there that you as long as you know what kind of story and themes you want to tell, you can pretty much make any genre of movie you like, even an adaptation of an Edith Wharton novel.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nMore than anything, it’s interesting to see Scorsese step out of his comfort zone and tackle a period piece. It’s a lovely little film even if it’s mid-tier Scorsese.\n\nBEST SCORSESE MOVIES LIST\n\n15. Cape Fear (1991)\n\nCreative Cinematic Fear • Jack’s Movie Reviews\n\nOne of the greatest shots in Scorsese’s filmography is the opening shot of the antagonist, Max Cady. The score combined with the panning down of cut up images and books before landing on a muscular, tattooed man help tell the audience practically everything they need to know about him before he says a word. He’s imprisoned but laser-focused on some goal. Why else would he be working out with such intensity? It’s a great way to open a film and a perfect lesson in cinematography for aspiring filmmakers.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nMartin Scorsese elevates what could’ve easily been a B-movie thriller into something far more cinematic. It remains a thrilling watch, and afterward, you can watch The Simpsons episode it inspired to calm yourself down.\n\nALL OF MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES RANKED\n\n14. Raging Bull (1980)\n\nWhat’s So Great About Raging Bull? • A Matter of Film\n\nThere’s a quote from Scorsese that goes, “The most personal, is the most creative.” When he was initially approached about directing Raging Bull, he didn’t want to do it because he couldn’t relate to the boxer and he wasn’t interested in sports. However, after a drug overdose, he saw the film in a new light. He realized boxing could be interpreted as anything. It took on a new light for him. It became personal to him, so he exercised a great amount of creative freedom on the film.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nRaging Bull is a fascinating character study. However, it’s the kind of story that would become commonplace in the Martin Scorsese filmography with more interesting characters taking the form of Travic Bickle and Johnny Boy.\n\nMODERN MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES\n\n13. The Irishman (2018)\n\nThe Irishman Opening Shot • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nScorsese made it clear to his costume designer that he wanted to do a different kind of gangster aesthetic than Goodfellas or Casino. The mafia here is more low-key. They feel down-to-Earth, so when you reach the final moments, what you have is all the more relatable. You have an old man reflecting on his life and all the mistakes he made.\n\nNo matter what course you’re life took, it seems like we’re all destined to die with just a little regret over the things we could have changed.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nIt’s a shame the de-aging effects aren’t quite up to snuff. Behind the awkward faces and movements, you have a brilliant meditation on mortality that feels like Scorsese looking back on his own life with some amount of regret.\n\nBEST SCORSESE MOVIES ON SPIRITUALITY\n\n12. Silence (2017)\n\nScorsese on his faith & Silence\n\nSilence is arguably Scorsese’s most restrained work. There are no snap-zooms or jazzy jump cuts Scorsese is known for. Instead, the film is punctuated with long, drawn out shots, an appropriate choice for a film that is a long, steady march to a final and honest thesis about what it means to be a man of God.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nSilence feels like a deeply personal film for Scorsese. It feels like an auteur struggling with his own doubts and beliefs and trying to come to terms with them.\n\nBEST SCORSESE MOVIES\n\n11. Killers of the Flower Moon (2023)\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon and the future of film\n\nIn some form or another, Scorsese has always been interested in American evil — the underbelly of the country that infects all of its institutions and inhabitants. Perhaps in no other film has he looked at this evil so directly as in Killers of the Flower Moon, an unflinching portrait of America’s original sin, the genocide of Native Americans. As such, Killers feels like a culmination of so much of Scorsese’s work, pulling as much from Silence as he does from Goodfellas. It’s a titanic work that ranks among the master’s best.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nKillers of a Flower Moon is as beautiful as it is nauseating. It is an excruciating film that is both intensely personal and damningly universal. It’s a much-watch entry in Scorsese’s filmography.\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE AND HIS BEST MOVIES\n\n10. Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1974)\n\nTCM Intro • Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore\n\nStar Ellen Burstyn saw Mean Streets and knew she wanted to work with Scorsese on Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore. It may seem like an odd pairing, hiring someone with a gritty aesthetic for a movie about a widow traveling with her son across the American Southwest.\n\nHowever, it proved to be a fruitful collaboration. Casting aside the darkness and violence of a film like Mean Streets, it was evident the director was someone who understood characters, and ultimately, that’s what you need for a memorable film. Ellen Burstyn taking a chance on an up-and-comer resulted in one of the best and unique films in Scorsese’s career.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nAlice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore is one of Scorsese’s most straightforward efforts. It makes you wish he made films with female protagonists more often.\n\nEARLY MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES\n\n9. Mean Streets (1973)\n\nQ&A With Martin Scorsese • Mean Streets\n\nThat criticism from John Cassavetes we wrote about earlier helped propel Scorsese to make Mean Streets, the first feature film that feels genuinely like a Scorsese picture. Sometimes, you need a few misfires to realize what kind of stories you really want to tell. It’s a good lesson for filmmakers out there who are maybe struggling.\n\nIt’s okay to make a piece of crap as long as you learn something out of the experience, and when you watch Mean Streets, you get the sense that Scorsese is no longer messing around.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nMean Streets proved Scorsese was a master of his craft. It’s a bit rough around the edges compared to his other films, but watching now, it’s fascinating to see how far he’s come as a director.\n\nUNDERSTANDING MARTIN SCORSESE BEST MOVIES\n\n8. The Wolf of Wall Street (2013)\n\nThelma Schoonmaker on Editing with Scorsese • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nThere’s a scene in The Wolf of Wall Street where Jordan Belfort, high out of his mind, crawls down a flight of steps to his car. The scene feels like it’s a half hour long even though it only lasts a couple of minutes. Any other director would’ve sped things up (or at the very least, the studio would’ve demanded it).\n\nBut Scorsese wants us to live in that moment. We see this man who’s supposed to be the embodiment of the American hustle as he comically and sadly can’t even walk to his car. The Wolf of Wall Street shows just how in command of his craft Scorsese is, and you can either hop in or get out of the way.\n\nIt also boasts one of the best scripts Scorsese’s worked with, written by Sopranos alum Terence Winter. Check out this scene on the page, which we imported into StudioBinder’s screenwriting software:\n\nWolf of Wall Street PDF\n\nMuch like The Sopranos, Winter uses criminals to highlight the legalized corruption that is rampant in people’s pursuit of the American Dream. Here, Belfort isn’t wrong– as the Great Recession showed us, those companies were taking advantage of people.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Wolf of Wall Street is an exercise in excess. It may not be for everyone, but when you look past the partying, you find a smart critique of the American dream.\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES FOR DIRECTORS\n\n7. Hugo (2011)\n\nRobert Richardson Cinematography Style • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nHugo had the best use of 3D ever in a film. Yes, in the aftermath of Avatar, Scorsese used technology to outstanding effect to truly put you in a state of childlike wonder, a common thread throughout the film.\n\nEven when Scorsese is out of his normal wheelhouse in terms of content, he still finds a way to put his signature stamp on a movie and push the limits of what you can do with a children’s caper.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nHugo doesn’t get enough attention as it deserves. It may not be typical Scorsese, but therein lies the charm. It’s a splendid little film you can actually watch with your kids, knowing they’re watching something with substance.\n\nRANKING MARTIN SCORSESE BEST MOVIES\n\n6. The King of Comedy (1982)\n\nThe King of Comedy Discussion • Tribeca Film Festival\n\nRobert De Niro prepared for his role in The King of Comedy by talking to some of his real-life stalkers. It allowed him to get in the mind of someone obsessed with fame and celebrities, making for one of the most memorable Scorsese protagonists ever. It also just goes to show you can prepare for a role in unique ways and researching doesn’t always have to be a chore.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nIn an era of celebrity worship and fanboys, The King of Comedy has remained relevant over the years. It’s also a must-watch if you enjoy Todd Phillips’ Joker.\n\nSay, before we jump into the top five Martin Scorsese movies, let’s take a look at some other properties Scorsese has had a hand in making. From documentaries to music videos, you may be surprised to see what else Scorsese has made over the years.\n\nGREAT SCORSESE PROPERTIES\n\nMartin Scorsese Miscellania\n\nThe Last Waltz (1978): A documentary on The Band’s last concert at the Winterland Ballroom, featuring numerous other acts on the lineup, such as Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton.\n\nThe Sandlot • Trailer\n\n“Bad” (1987): Michael Jackson’s famous music video.\n\n“Bad” • Michael Jackson\n\nShine a Light (2008): A documentary concert film focused on The Rolling Stones’ 2006 performance at the Beacon Theatre.\n\nTrailer • Shine a Light\n\n“Boardwalk Empire” (2010): Scorsese directed the pilot for the HBO series.\n\nFirst Scene • Boardwalk Empire\n\n“Pilot” for Vinyl (2016): Scorsese directed the pilot episode for HBO.\n\nTrailer • Vinyl\n\nRolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese (2019): A pseudo-documentary film on the life of Bob Dylan.\n\nTrailer • Rolling Thunder Revue\n\nSo now that you have some more homework to catch up on, let’s dive back into the top five Martin Scorsese films of all time.\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE’S FILMS, RANKED\n\n5. After Hours (1985)\n\nStuck Doing This Scene Clip • After Hours\n\nTim Burton was originally set to direct After Hours, but he stepped aside when Scorsese expressed interest in the material. It’s hard to see this dark comedy as a Burton movie, which is a good lesson to know when you’re out of your wheelhouse. While it’s always good to challenge yourself, in this case, it’s good Burton stepped aside because it resulted in one of Scorsese’s classic New York street films that remains just as harrowing to this day.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nAfter Hours is Scorsese getting back to his gritty roots. It’s an interesting time capsule of New York in the '80s, and even today, it’s a blast to watch.\n\nMARTIN SCORSESE BEST MOVIES FOR FILMMAKERS\n\n4. The Last Temptation of Christ (1988)\n\nWillem DaFoe on The Last Temptation of Christ\n\nThere’s one thing Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ does better than practically any other film on Jesus. It portrays the Savior as a real human. He has foibles, and he feels like a real man. It ruffled some feathers upon its release, but to date, it’s Scorsese’s most directly contemplative film on religion to date. Most of his films deal with faith to some capacity, but The Last Temptation of Christ feels the most profound with Scorsese saying everything he wants to say about the subject matter.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nWillem Dafoe plays Jesus Christ of Nazareth. If that doesn’t get you to watch the film, I don’t know what will.\n\nBEST SCORSESE FILMS FROM THE 90S\n\n3. Casino (1995)\n\nInterview With Martin Scorsese • Casino\n\nThe count room sequence in Casino is a brilliantly shot work of art. We follow the movement of money from the casino floor to the room, the camera not breaking away for a second. It’s kinetic as voiceover plays over, introducing us to this seedy world. It makes a scene that ordinarily could’ve been pretty boring, just guys counting money, and makes it dynamic.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nCasino is another Scorsese film that has aged incredibly well as we’ve seen the greed corrupt American institutions in recent years. The themes are more pertinent than ever.\n\nEXCELLENT MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIES\n\n2. Taxi Driver (1976)\n\nTaxi Driver Scene Breakdown • Subscribe on YouTube\n\nPlenty of films are great. Few reach the heights of “iconic” like Taxi Driver. An interesting insight into the film is that Scorsese compared Travis Bickle to a saint, wanting to cleanse himself of weakness.\n\nThat kind of viewpoint is extremely helpful when creating stories with anti-heroes to help make the audience empathize with them, even if they don’t always agree with their actions.\n\nTaxi Driver also introduced audiences to one of the greatest cinematic partnerships ever between Scorsese and writer Paul Schrader. Schrader brings his themes of Christian existentialism, violent redemption, and disillusioned lone wolves to the film’s screenplay. You can see it from the first page of the script:\n\nTaxi Driver PDF\n\nIt’s an indelible, disturbed opening to a movie which perfectly captures Schrader’s tortured prose.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nTaxi Driver has impacted the zeitgeist in unique, and sometimes horrifying, ways. It’s a must-watch for any filmmaker.\n\nTHE BEST MARTIN SCORSESE MOVIE\n\n1. Goodfellas (1990)\n\nWhy Goodfellas is the Best Gangster Movie • Jack’s Movie Reviews\n\nGoodfellas is about as perfect of a film as you can get. Everything from the cinematography to the editing to the performances is brilliant. All that in an engaging story about a perversion of the American dream that still rings true to this day. It’s not just the quintessential Scorsese movie. It’s a quintessential American film you’re lucky to get once in a lifetime.\n\nBEST MARTIN SCORSESE FILMS\n\nConclusion\n\nGoodfellas is cinema in the purest form. And it’s an impressive feat Scorsese has more than one masterpiece to his name.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nMartin Scorsese Directing Style\n\nWe’ve tried to sprinkle in some directing tips throughout this listicle.
