        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n\"Goodfellas: Cinematography Analysis\" is an essay that will be focusing on three scenes from Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990). The semi-detailed scene analysis will cover the mise-en-scene, the cinematography, the editing, and the sound in an attempt to expose how and why these specific elements contribute to the film's overall narrative. This will involve taking apart the scene and looking at each of the elements separately and how they interact with each other. The scenes used in the analysis will show the overall rise and fall of the main character, Henry Hill, and it will show the polar opposites of the two different lifestyles that Henry leads. Through these scene analyses we will see how Henry finds out who he truly is and the consequences of his decisions. An understanding of what cinematography is in essential to the analysis of specific scenes in this film. The term \"cinematography\" is a wide definition and can be briefly described as what is \"seen\" in the film as well as how it appears on screen. This includes the camera shots, the framing, and the movements of both the camera and the actors, and the specific use of any other motion picture camera. When analyzing the importance of cinematography in a motion picture, focusing on the camera shots is a good start. Camera shots are the amount of distance between the camera and the object it is shooting, and a change in shots can imply re-assessment of a subject or change of its relative importance. Different shots can also carry different connotations. A close up shot typically implies an emotional reaction or discovery for a character, and the importance in the Goodfellas film is the fact that the shot only ever shows the character's face.\n\n1.1. Overview of Goodfellas\n\nThroughout the movie, multiple types of cameras were used. Some of the scenes required a handheld camera. For instance, in the scene when Henry and Karen first enter the Copacabana, the camera follows them from behind, and Henry hands the waiter his gun in a very tight uncut sequence with a steadicam. There was much experimentation in this film through the use of tracking shots and quick, short cuts, and it may be said that Henry Hill's paranoia is effectively conveyed through these experimental filming techniques. One of the most memorable tracks in the film is when Henry takes Karen through the Copacabana, and the camera moves through various kitchens and straight into the ballroom by entering through the backdoor. This was a unique scene in that it shows not only what the life of a gangster was like on the \"inside\" but it was done all in one take. Kum-Kum Bhavnani comments: \"The seductive sequence through the Copacabana... was facilitated by film technologies like the steadicam\" (121). There is the mentioned handheld camera which gives a documentary feel, quick and short cuts through the paranoia scenes in which Henry is both being tailed by the feds and the scene where he's entering his mistress' home just before he gets pinched. The film is shot in numerous locations, such as city streets, bars, and houses across New York and even airport terminals and prison cells. But most importantly, the film can show a man at ease or in distress, order and chaos, and the two different sides of the gangster life are effectively shown through the variety of camera techniques throughout the film. Whether Henry's putting a hit on someone or having a quiet dinner with his wife, the film does not mix the two and is able to effectively separate the two sides of his life by the use of various camera techniques fired by Scorsese's own paranoia.\n\n1.2. Importance of Cinematography in Film Analysis\n\nThis essay is mainly about a formal review and analysis of Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas. The structure of the review is separated into two sections: the formal review of the film and the analysis of the movie in terms of history, in which the movie is set and the historical accuracy of events that take place in the movie. The formal review is what most of the essay will be focusing on, due to the fact that the review provides the best reference to the treatment of the history of the time period. The second section doesn't provide a good analysis of the movie and the history of the time period, but it tries to show a comparison of the movie to the history, allowing people who lack knowledge of the time period to have a better understanding of what takes place in the movie. The historical reference is a major part in the analysis of the movie, mainly because it's based on real events and real people, people and events that are well known in terms of crime and mafia activity in the 1960s. This time period was a major point in American history, an era of diversity, racial tension, human rights activism, the moonlight years, the Vietnam War, and many other vast events that brought about changes in American culture and society. Being that the movie is based between 1963 and 1980, it was crucial to the accuracy of the movie that there be a strong reference to the history of this time-spanned era, due to the fact that many people can remember this time period and are knowledgeable of the events that took place.\n\n2. Cinematography Techniques in Goodfellas\n\nGoodfellas Cinematography Analysis Goodfellas is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese. The movie is adapted from the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi, who also co-wrote the screenplay for Goodfellas with Scorsese. This film depicts the life of the mob and the main character, Henry Hill, played by Ray Liotta, throughout his younger years into his adulthood. Goodfellas begins and ends with Henry Hill as an older man; the middle section is a recreation of his life starting at age 12. It includes his rise in the mob, partnership with James Conway, played by Robert De Niro, and his relationships with his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco. According to Pileggi, the movie ends at the point where Hill becomes a drug dealer. This movie portrays a striking visual style. This is achieved through several film techniques. This essay will examine the clear use of a voiceover and its relation to memory, the opening scene, and its effect on the audience's notion of Henry Hill, and the use of the freeze frame and long tracking shot in the scene leading up to the Lufthansa heist. The cinematography in Goodfellas is used to give the audience an insight into how Henry feels living the life of a mobster. The cinematography achieves this by engaging the audience in Henry's mind and feelings. We are able to comprehend Henry's state of mind through the use of voiceover narration that is typically a recollection of what has previously been portrayed in the scene, a technique used to give the audience a greater understanding of a character's mind. This typically accompanies a freeze frame on a still shot. An important aspect of this visual style is the careful use of color to illustrate the themes and emotions that Henry is feeling. An example of this is near the start of the film when Henry is a young boy running an errand for local mob boss Paulie. This is the first time colors are used to visually depict Henry's feelings. As he is enjoying the attention and wearing an apron handed to him by the local butcher, the world seems bright and welcoming. This is emphasized through the use of high key lighting, giving the audience the impression that Henry feels happy and content. This is compared to his feelings nine years later at a similar job for Paulie. As Henry leaves a Bamboo Lounge mob meeting carrying a package given to him by Paulie, he notices the shine of blood on the paper. At this point, he clearly realizes the implications of the job and how far he has become involved in the mob world. An equivalent low angle shot and use of color illustrate to the audience Henry's feeling that the world has become a dark and dangerous place.\n\n2.1. Lighting and Shadows\n\nGoodfellas is a very dark and moody film, so it is only fitting that shadows are portrayed as an evil force in the story. With the exception of a few key scenes, the characters are almost always engulfed in darkness. This is first illustrated just after Henry is found not guilty at his first major trial. When Henry goes home to give that news to his family, he walks into a dimly lit room where most of the family is sleeping. The darkness at that point symbolizes the troubled times that lay ahead for Henry and his family. After the television stint at the Copacabana, the story evolves deeper into the theme of organized crime. It is at this point and through the rest of the film where shadows make their biggest impact on the mood of the story. The most memorable scene to use shadows is the aftermath of the Lufthansa Heist. This scene displays the morphing of the Jimmy and Tommy characters through the use of shadows. After the heist, the mob is living high and everyone is making more money than they dreamed of. Jimmy is the first to go off the deep end and pay off a few key cops who could have pinned the unsolved Lufthansa case on his crew. While Jimmy is initially created as a lighthearted and likable character, he is seen from this point forward in very dark settings which eventually lead into his evil deeds and madness that ultimately lead to his whacking. Tommy is first depicted as a hot tempered clown with psycho mannerisms. But when he learns that he killed made man Billy Batts, his life starts to spiral out of control and goals for acceptance in the mob. Tommy is seen on and off losing his marbles until he is finally whacked in a fit of naivety where he thinks he is about to be a made man in the mafia. Both of these characters change for the worse, and the beauty of the shadow scenes is that it captures the exact moment where their personality and fate takes their last turn going downward. This is what makes the lighting and use of shadows in Goodfellas a definitive mark on the film. Without it, the film would not be as dark, moody, and powerful.\n\n2.2. Camera Movement and Angles\n\nAs mentioned in the previous section \"2.1. Lighting and Shadows\", traditional brutalism in film noir lighting (high contrast, lots of shadow and light) is used to represent moral uncertainty and the characters' unease. Goodfellas is, however, not a film noir and so Scorsese does venture out with the lighting, at times shedding a positive light on the characters' lives. An example of this can be seen when Henry and his future wife Karen are walking around the Copacabana. The sequence is shot in a single unbroken steadicam shot, with the camera placed behind the characters following them. This not only represents the swaying motion from side to side that comes from excessive drinking, but also gives an indication of the characters' insecurity and the fragility of their relationship. The editing, namely the fact that the shot is unbroken, shows the couple as almost 'one' entity, which is being pulled in two directions by their lifestyle and the possible exit from this life. The decision is completely mirrored in the lighting at the end of the sequence. As the couple is seen from the beginning, the brighter lighting gives way to a change in their lives, shown by the removal of their shoes by the waiters (showing their peacefulness at that time, and undoubted status change in the offing) and the valet taking Henry's car keys. The change is cemented by the progression to a solitary medium close-up on Henry and Karen, where the light fades to a single light source coming slightly from the back right direction (technically this scene is quite a common example of split lighting). This fades to black as they enter a paradoxically brighter corridor but the change of lifestyle is very much symbolized by that brief moment. This scene could be said to be breaking the noir tradition, by the fact that it does hint at a happy ending for the couple, even though we know it doesn't actually end up that way.\n\n2.3. Color Palette and Visual Style\n\nWhat Goodfellas has and the majority of mob films do not is color. The movie is set over the time period of around 30 years, I think this was the motive for the use of lots of differing colors throughout the film, to represent the different eras chosen. Compared to the omnipresent blackness of films like The Godfather and Donnie Brasco, this is quite a change. Earlier in the movie, a lot of high key, bright, over-exposed lighting is used to complement the bright colors. This is clearly evident in the scene with young Henry taking his first solo walk to the cabstand. By the time period the story gets to the 70s, the colors have changed to reflect the era i.e. more earthy tones are used to compliment the ubiquitously brown/orange attire of the characters. This again was achieved using a specific film stock, Kodak 5247, scan and go through digital intermediary. Another thing which sets mood is the use of spot lighting or sometimes colored lighting by Scorsese. This is evident in a couple of scenes where Karen is scared of Jimmy, a low angle shot of Jimmy is used, with an unhappy expression on Karen's face, and the room is almost completely dark with just a small amount of yellowish light in the back left of the room. The abundance of color in this film is certainly refreshing and a change from the norm for this genre of film.\n\n2.4. Use of Close-ups and Wide Shots\n\n3. Close-up This scene here is of the young Henry shutting the cab door just after committing a murder. The close-up is essential as no other type of shot would convey the panic, horror, and desperation on Henry's face to such an extent. As he shuts the door, the frame freezes, and there is a stoppage of sound. This is in order to portray Henry's last moments of innocence. He realizes that life will never be the same. By using a close-up again when Henry is grown up as he shuts his car door after finding out he's about to be indicted, it is evident the similarity is being expressed and that Henry feels only the same panic and desperation as he did on the first murder. Close-up shots feature heavily in both of these scenes and are of great effect, so now we'll take a closer look. Closer examination shows the second close-up to be at an even quicker tempo than those in the first murder scene, so as to again show Henry's panic. As he gets out of the car with it still running, the camera zooms gradually into a close-up of the car being left alone and therefore reputable check of scaling Henry's (who's hiding behind some bushes) anxiety is achieved. This is then closely followed by a zoom into a close-up of Henry looking through the keyhole of his girlfriend's room when hiding from the mob so as to accentuate the peak of his desperation. So the effective use of close-up is maintained throughout this scene, and it's a major factor in creating such a tense and chaotic atmosphere.\n\n3. Impact of Cinematography on Storytelling\n\n1. Enhancing Mood and Atmosphere The tone of Goodfellas is as versatile as it can get and it changes from scene to scene. In terms of lighting and color, most of the scenes are similar during the bright days but when it comes to night scenes, it depends on where the scene is and what the characters are feeling. For example, Henry always feels safe at the Copacabana, so the seduction scene has a yellowish tinge to it and high key lighting. The yellow represents security, and the lights add to the vivid mood. They pass through the kitchen to get to the restaurant where Henry acts as if it is nothing out of the ordinary. At this point, they hear that the restaurant is closed and is being re-opened by police. The mood suddenly changes. At this instant, there is high angled down lighting as Henry begins to fear for his life. It is a lot darker, and the lighting reflects his mood. Another example is when Morrie is killed. Before he is killed, everything seems fine as he and Frankie are about to go out and celebrate. The lighting reflects this. Cue the hit, the mood becomes sinister, and Morrie begins to realize what is going to happen. There is casting of heavy shadows on his face as he pleads for his life with his last chance saloon in the background. This scene was a perfect use of lighting to change the mood.\n\n3.1. Enhancing Mood and Atmosphere\n\nThe cinematography techniques used in Goodfellas to enhance the mood and atmosphere are crucial to the film's success in storytelling. Throughout the film, the variety of camera work and lighting effectively sets the mood for each scene, representing the characters' state of mind, whether they are paranoid and coked up or relaxed and in a state of domesticity. Tommy's angry character is signified in the camera work and editing in several scenes. When Henry, Jimmy, and Tommy are eating in a diner, Tommy retells the story about the bamboo shoot up the soldier's fingernails in a threatening manner. As he speaks, the camera zooms slowly in to his face from a three-shot, isolating him, and then cuts back to a close-up of Tommy at the end of the story. This isolating of Tommy and the slow zoom in onto his face concerning the viewer creates a sense of unease and tension, already notifying what is about to happen next. A similar technique is used after Tommy brutally kills Spider. As the next scene begins with Tommy coming out of a car with his collar up to hide from what he has done, there is diegetic non-diegetic sound of police sirens, and he is constantly looking over his shoulder. This gives the audience an insight into Tommy's nervousness and paranoia concerning his actions. The use of the freeze-frame shot just after he looks over his shoulder to the sound of the piano creates a sense of pathos from Tommy in killing Spider, as he knows he has taken it too far and there is no going back. The most impressive bit of cinematography in the film can be said to be its most famous scene, the Copacabana tracking shot. This elaborate shot, involving much planning, visually narrates Karen's view of Henry taking her on a first-class date, from walking through the kitchen to organize getting a good table, making friends, and slipping a tip to the waiter for a good table, to taking her through the back entrance to watch Henny Youngman perform from the best seat in the house. This scene reflects the opulence of Henry's life, accessing an illegal lifestyle, and the lighting and character movements throughout the sequence are excellent.\n\n3.2. Conveying Character Emotions\n\nOne of the most obvious aspects of any film that appeals to a viewer is the range of emotions of the characters. Each emotion is portrayed through some form of facial expression, body language, or vocal tone. However, what makes a character in a movie seem more real is when the audience can see and feel the emotions that the character is going through. In order for this to happen, there needs to be a clear focus on the character's emotions and the scenes that they are in. Throughout Goodfellas, the characters' emotions are displayed in various scenes using a range of different cinematic techniques. The movie begins with the main character, Henry Hill, recounting an eventful evening in 1970, where the audience is abruptly thrown into the chaos of a murder. Here, the character's fear is evident, and it is enhanced by a large variety of camera techniques. A point of view shot is used when Henry drives into the compound, showing his fear, curiosity, and confusion. Cut-in shots show the expressions and emotions of both him and his wife, with close-ups used to show Henry's concern. A high-angle shot from the helicopter is used to show the magnitude of what Henry is scared of, and the viewer gets a clear indication of his fear, which is the dominant emotion throughout the scene. This wide variety of shot angles and types not only enhances the fear through the different effects the shot has but also ensures that the audience's focus is solely on the characters and their emotions.\n\n3.3. Creating Tension and Suspense\n\nFraming is used frequently throughout the film, particularly in scenes featuring Henry's wife Karen. In one particular scene where Henry stands up to Karen after a heated argument, the camera forces the audience to look up at him as if we were Karen. This gives a sense of dominance but also makes the audience feel small and vulnerable, which mirrors Karen's feelings of dominance and vulnerability as she is being scolded. The same scene also features a tracking shot from Karen's point of view as she retreats to her room. The shot follows her frantically and soon becomes erratically pointed upwards. This shot is very disorienting and reflects Karen's state of mind. Her world is collapsing around her and she is losing control. Another scene featuring Karen is the double date where Henry stands her up to go commit a major heist. Scorsese uses frantic zooming and close-ups on Karen in conversation with her (rather unwanted) date. There is a glimpse of Henry getting in a car with Jimmy and Tommy before Scorsese cuts back to Karen's face with a loud and garish zoom. This tells the audience that Karen is feeling particularly paranoid and anxious at this moment. Acute off-center framing is used with the painting of St. Francis of Assisi quite frequently throughout the film. This painting is seen immediately after Pesci's \"do I amuse you?\" speech and also when Henry turns up late to make peace with a neighbor. The painting is very significant as it is mentioned in the film by Tommy's mother, \"I'm gonna have it appraised, it might be worth something.\" This is a clear indication that Tommy has kicked it in and is mocking the neighbor (known for his cheapness) and that he may even have killed the neighbor and taken the picture. This juxtaposition of strong caper/action scenes with the very quiet, simple image of a still and peaceful St. Francis is a fantastic tool to create dramatic irony and ultimately tension.\n\n4. Influence of Goodfellas' Cinematography on Filmmaking\n\nAside from its critical acclaim and positive reception, the cinematography found in Goodfellas has had long-lasting effects on future films and is still influential to this day. In particular, the use of the Steadicam has since become associated with the film. Throughout the 1980s, the Steadicam had seen little use, but Goodfellas prompted a resurgence in its use with other filmmakers. At the 63rd Academy Awards, Scorsese talked with Brian De Palma about how he wanted the Copacabana tracking shot to feel like the protagonist Henry was entering a living, breathing world which he was finally a part of. Scorsese wanted the audience to feel like they were entering the nightclub through the kitchen alongside Henry. Since then, more directors have employed similar lengthy tracking shots which take in a large amount of action, and none have done so more famously than the six-minute-long Copacabana tracking shot. The shot has inspired several homages and parodies, most notably in the last episode of The Sopranos as well as in Ted Demme's Blow. The surreal comedy Good Burger has a dream sequence parodying the tracking shot, and the 1998 video game adaptation of The Italian Job uses a similar level of detail and continuous action in its second mission, most notably a shot following a dog which is part of a tribute mode that specifically references the Goodfellas tracking shot.\n\n4.1. Legacy and Influence on Future Films\n\nGoodfellas' innovative cinematography was profoundly influential on the film industry. The most direct result of the film's impact was its contribution to the mainstream acceptance of the Steadicam, an invention which had previously been associated only with use by \"specialty\" cinematographers. Wright's use of the Steadicam is now its most studied and imitated employment. He uses it to complement the seductive long take, though the tracking shot is also used to similar effect throughout the movie. Stephen Prince wrote in The Warrior's Camera, \"the long take reaches its apogee in Goodfellas\". Wright uses the long take and the tracking shot with the Steadicam to take the place of the traditional establishing shot. This technique is used to illustrate the mob's infiltration of post-war American society early in the movie, taking the viewer on an epic journey through a series of backyards while mobster's voiceovers discuss their newly invigorated career prospects. It is similarly used in the scene where Henry Hill makes his last drug run and is subsequently arrested, the beaming staccato camera charting his passage from car to helicopter and building to bust. While the long take becomes a piece of self-conscious bravura on the part of the director, it is united with other techniques in the film to break down the barrier between viewer and character. This collapse of space reaches its zenith in the Copacabana tracking sequence, which on two levels is the most famous scene in the film. Prince wrote that the sequence \"presents a breathtaking royal progress of its mobster hero\", however Henry is at this stage in the movie still an aspiring outsider. The viewer becomes Henry's double as Wright uses the Steadicam to guide him through the bowels of the nightclub up to the inner sanctum of the debauched pleasure dome; resourceful tracking dissolves time and space as the maitre'd magically secures a good table to the strains of George Harrison's \"What is Life\" and the dissipated congregation of wise guys part the way for Henry and Karen like underlings making way for the queen.\n\n4.2. Techniques Adopted by Other Directors\n\nWhen Goodfellas was released, it was met with mixed reviews by various people. However, in this day and age, critics and all who value film as an art hold this as a classic, including the cinematography. As previously described, Scorsese uses a plethora of techniques and styles to illustrate Henry's narrative, the rise and fall of his reign. Much of this has been emulated by other directors since then. The first techniques that people remember from Goodfellas are the freeze frames and the fast pace in movement through these stills. Guy Ritchie used a similar freeze frame style in his 1998 film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and again in 2000 with Snatch. Although Ritchie's freeze frames are not necessarily of his protagonist narrating the film, it adds to the comical and fast-paced nature of his films. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a film that has been argued is a parallel to Scorsese's work, representing modern-day gangster Britain. This can also be said about the freeze frames of Ritchie's second film. The way in which the frame freezes and the scene turns to black and white, Guy Ritchie has almost definitely adopted that technique from Scorsese's masterpiece. Edgar Wright has also used freeze frames for comic effect in his films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz. Wright has gone on record to say he tried to put as many of these in Hot Fuzz as he can, showing he is a fan of this style and again it captures the comical effect that the freeze frames are used as in Goodfellas. Wright had his own unique way of doing this, when the frame freezes, characters in the film sometimes have a circle drawn around them with a description inside it, what that character says after this is then repeated by a voiceover. Paying homage to Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Steve Buscemi's character in Reservoir Dogs, Mr. Pink, even adopted the narration technique, providing his own theories on tipping with a voiceover in the very same way that Henry Hill narrates Goodfellas. He has also used narration in Pulp Fiction with Bruce Willis' character. Although it's difficult to find any proof that this was influenced by Goodfellas as Pulp Fiction was in production at the same time Goodfellas was released, the connection can still be made.\n\n4.3. Recognition and Awards for Cinematography in Goodfellas\n\nGoodfellas is a film considered as the magnum opus of Martin Scorsese. It has received a lot of recognition for the cinematic work, most of which is well deserved. Included below is an interview with Michael Ballhaus where he discusses part of the making of Goodfellas. This film has been called \"the greatest gangster film of all time\" and it is hard to disagree, as this particular film has greatly impacted the world of gangster films to come. Goodfellas' cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus received an Oscar nod for his impressive work on this film, yet it is debatable whether he was really recognized enough. This film helped Scorsese and Ballhaus put a new twist on the classic gangster genre. It was a fresh and extremely entertaining by closely portraying the path of the gangster lifestyle, which was at the start glamorous job but eventually lead to their downfall. They did this by strategically using various techniques to enhance the view of the film."
