        "text": "As times have progressed, warnings have been applied on certain platforms for classic movies. The warnings are to accommodate viewers that might be upset by the subject matter depicted in these particular films which hasn’t exactly aged appropriately for today’s standards. Many viewers don’t see it as a necessity, while others appreciate the warnings. Now, however, it looks like the classic Martin Scorsese movie Goodfellas is the latest to receive such a warning via AMC.\n\nThe network recently screened a copy of the film for viewers to enjoy. After all, Goodfellas has been considered a classic piece of cinema ever since it was released in 1990. As the outlet notes, however, times seem to have changed.\n\nHere’s a copy of the warning which was shared at the top of the screen for the film:\n\n“This film includes language and/or cultural stereotypes that are inconsistent with today’s standards of inclusion and tolerance and may offend some viewers,” the warning reads.\n\nThe outlet reminds that the film’s “warning was first affixed to the movie during the height of Black Lives Matter riots when many businesses and cultural institutions made avoiding offense to various groups a core part of their missions.”\n\nAnd, while such warnings have become more common, it’s worth adding that other similar films have yet to receive warnings against “cultural stereotypes” and other such offenses. In fact, NY Post also reminds that The Godfather has yet to receive the same kind of warning even though it also plays on AMC.\n\nBo Ditel, a former NYPD officer that also portrayed a police officer in the film Goodfellas, shared a statement to the publication regarding his thoughts on the warning:\n\n“The f–king political correctness has f–king taken everything away,” Ditel begins. “This is how life was back then. It was not a clean beautiful thing. You can’t cleanse history. If you want to tell true history, you gotta tell it the way it is.”\n\nA similar statement was shared by Michael Franzese, a one-time captain of the Colombo crime family:\n\n“We don’t need anyone protecting mob guys. It’s crazy.”"
