        "text": "Hello and welcome to Pinkfresh Studio June 2023 Stamp, Die, Stencil, and Hot Foil Release Blog Hop !!!\n\nIf you arrived here from the Nichol Spohrâ€™s Blog, youâ€™re right on track. If not, please head on over to the Pinkfresh Studio Card blog to get all the information about the full release and to start the blog hop!\n\nItâ€™s release day at Pinkfresh Studio! This release includes many beautiful floral product suites along with an washi product suite. There is also a sentiment stamp called Basic Banners Everyday, which coordinates with the Basic Banners Celebrate die from the April 2023 Release !\n\nFor today I made three cards. Two of them are featuring the Delicate Rosebuds product suite with stamp, stencil, die, and hot foil. I love the elegant design of this stamp image!\n\nTo start the first card I stamped the Delicate Rosebuds in Detail Black on a Neenah solar white panel and stenciled the rose buds in dark red in Candy Apple and Regal Kiss, and the leaves in Olive and Evergreen. Once done with stenciling I cut the image using the coordinating die and set it aside.\n\nNext I made the watercolored background. I white heat embossed the Delicate Rosebuds image three times on a watercolor paper panel as shown in the picture and watercolored the panel loosely in pink, yellow and green.\n\nAfter the panel was dry I cut it using a die from the Blanket Stitched Rectangles die set and mounted it flat on a white cardbase. I cut Fancy Oval Frame three times from some heavyweight white cardstock, stacked them and adhered the frame to the card.\n\nI then foam mounted the Delicate Rosebuds image on the card and added the sentiment from the Basic Banners Everyday set which was cut using the Basic Banners Celebrate die.\n\nTo finish off I scattered a few Twilight Glitter Drops.\n\nFor the second card I chose a different color scheme: brown (gold), orange and green.\n\nThe Delicate Rosebuds was heat embossed in gold and stenciled using the coordinating stencil set. The first layer of the rosebuds was stenciled in Apricot. I ink blended the base of the buds in Clementine. The second layer was stenciled in Persimmon. The leaves were first stenciled in Warm Buff and Grassy Knoll, and the second layer of them in Doe. I then cut the image using the coordinating die.\n\nTo create the background I ink blended the perimeter of a white panel in Warm Buff and Doe, and dry embossed it with the Overlapping Geo Leaf Hot Foil plate. Next I splattered gold ink on the panel and let it dry.\n\nI mounted the background panel on a white cardbase. I cut two diamonds using the Nested Diamonds die, one in white and the second one in gold. I layered them slightly offset and added the diamond frame to the center of the card using foam tape. To make a small bouquet I cut the shorter bud off and placed it next to the other bud. Next I arranged the rose buds on the diamond frame using foam tape.\n\nThe sentiment from the same stamp set was heat embossed in gold, cut with the coordinating die and added to the card. The bow from the Wrap Around Elements set was cut from some orange cardstock.\n\nI finished off the card by adding some Gold Metallic Pearls !\n\nThe last card for todayâ€™s hop is showing the Best Thing product suite. This set has a fabulous floral cluster image and a bird. And using the stencil and the die set you can create a birdcage.\n\nI stamped the floral cluster and the bird in Detail Black and stenciled them using the coordinating stencil set. The pink and orange flowers were stenciled in Apricot, Clementine, Coral Reef and Passion Fruit / the leaves in Blue Jay and Candy Violet, and the light blue flowers in Sky Blue and Summer Shower. For the bird I used the Sky Blue, Summer Shower, Blue Jay, Candy Violet and Sweet Mustard.\n\nAfter I was done with the stenciling, I cut the images using the coordinating die and set them aside.\n\nThe birdcage was first die cut and then ink blended in Coral Reef and Sweet Mustard.\n\nThe background in Navy is layers of some die cut elements. I used the Art Deco Frame die set to cut the base layer. The second layer was cut first with the Hexagon Tiles coverplate die and then cut with a small die from the Art Deco Frame set. I foam mounted the layers on a navy cardbase.\n\nI then arranged the stenciled images as shown in the picture. Additionally I gave the bird a branch to perch on. I adhered the branch and the birdcage to the card and then added the bird and the flowers. The sentiment from the same stamp set was white heat embossed on a piece of navy cardstock and cut with the coordinating die.\n\nFor some sparkle I scattered a few Starry Sky Ombre Glitter Drops on the card and the card was done!\n\nGIVEAWAYS\n\nPinkfresh Studio will be giving away the full release on the Pinkfresh blog and YouTube channel.\n\nThere will be a total of TEN $25 gift cards given to the winners chosen from all the blogs on the hop list.\n\nThe winners will be picked from the comments.\n\nAll the winners will be announced on the Pinkfresh Studio Giveaway Page on July 5, 2023.\n\n*Please check the Giveaway page and claim your prize within 2 weeks !\n\nHOP ALONG\n\nThe next stop is the amazing Yasmin Diazâ€™s blog !
