They went into the hospital at night, her mom\n\nHeather Spohr\n\nwas Tweeting about it. Maddie was born premature and life was a struggle for the family, but this was the tragic loss of a beautiful little girl. I do not know Heather, although I follow her on\n\nTwitter\n\n. I can not claim to even imagine what she is going through. However, one thing I know is this woman has support all over the world.\n\nIf you check out a few mommy blogs, you will see articles like this one or this one. It goes on and on, over 300 bloggers have listed their article about Maddie on Heather's good friends' site.\n\nJimmy Fallon tweeted a kind message to Heather and her family. Heather and her family have been fundraising for the March of Dimes, and donations have been pouring in since Maddie's death. I watched as yesterday the amount donated to her fight went from $3,000 to $17,000."
