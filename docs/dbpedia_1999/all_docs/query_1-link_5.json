        "text": "Mike and Heather Spohr are like the dream team of funny parents. Mike is a Parenting Editor at Buzzfeed and Heather runs the wildly popular website The Spohrs Are Multiplying. Together they have combined their talent for humorous, relatable writing and turned it into a new book, The Toddler Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Whiny Unfed.\n\nOur chat took place during some crazy wildfires happening in Southern California. Luckily they were not in harm’s way because we had a lot to talk about. As a fellow funny parent (yes, I do say so myself) I couldn’t wait to talk to them about how they started their blog and grew it to over 65 million visitors. That’s a massive accomplishment! They tell me it comes from a committment to write every day and sharing real stories from their lives.\n\nIn fact, they have shared a lot of heartbreak, and miracle moments on their website. And in an age where authenticity online is rare, it’s refreshing to meet people who are so open about their lives, the good and the bad. It’s inspiring that they took their experiences as parents and co-wrote their book.\n\nI don’t think I’ve written anything with Chris. I actually get annoyed when I’m writing something and he chimes in. After all, I’m the Emmy winner! I digress….\n\nBoth Mike and Heather say they took a different approach to the writing process. He set a goal to write a certain amount each day, and she would cram it all in one sitting. It’s adorable to hear them banter together and talk about their inspiration for this book and the process of going through something like this as a couple. They also have some great insights on staying relevent on social media, the changing landscape of digital media and building a brand while being a stay at home parent.\n\nWe definitely laughed a lot during this interview and I have no doubt you will enjoy it too. And all my parents with a good sense of humor will love their book, The Toddler Survival Guide: Complete Protection from the Whiny Unfed, available now online and in stores. And check out their blog at thespohrsaremultiplying.com\n\nYou can listen to my interview with the Spohr’s on iTunes or your wherever you get your podcasts.
