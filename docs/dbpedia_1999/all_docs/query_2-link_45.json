        "text": "To clarify, I think it's reasonable for you to find it creepy that I would check property records on the Spohrs. All I am saying is that because my job entails estate work, property tax records are familiar to me. It took all of seven minutes. And I did it at my house, using resources that are available to the public. My job is only relevant because I am familiar with said public resources because I also use them for my job.\n\nHeather Spohr whoring her family on the internet is the only reason that I cared to look up Heather Spohr's PUBLIC property records.\n\nAnd you could call me \"obsessed\", but I don't really see why my snark is any more pathetic than your obsessions with other bloggers. What happened to not policing the snark?\n\nLastly, for those who are making ridiculous shit up to make it sound like Mike and Heather did not become first time homeowners on account of money earned from exploiting their dead kid: even if there was an intrafamily transfer, THERE WOULD BE A DEED EVIDENCING SAID TRANSFER. There is no such deed. They were renters.\n\nA search of the term \"homeowners\" on their site yields the following results in support of what I already know to be true:\n\n** you don't have permission to see this link **\n\nFirst, Heather refers to \"those of you who have bought houses\" laughing at her naive escrow timeline. You know, as someone who had not ever bought a house before.\n\nSecond, Mike talks about how he has managed to avoid freaking out about \"mortgage payments and property taxes\", which would not be novel things to someone who already owned a home.\n\nYou can find it creepy that I am interested in stuff like that. I know I'm not doing anything nefarious with the information. It's just one of the things I'm curious about. I've searched lots of peoples property records. Don't give a shit if you think it's weird, I'm sure you all have some pretty strange quirks, too.\n\nHankMardukas said\n\nTo clarify, I think it's reasonable for you to find it creepy that I would check property records on the Spohrs. All I am saying is that because my job entails estate work, property tax records are familiar to me. It took all of seven minutes. And I did it at my house, using resources that are available to the public. My job is only relevant because I am familiar with said public resources because I also use them for my job.\n\nSo you say.\n\nHeather Spohr whoring her family on the internet is the only reason that I cared to look up Heather Spohr's PUBLIC property records.\n\nAnd you could call me \"obsessed\", but I don't really see why my snark is any more pathetic than your obsessions with other bloggers. What happened to not policing the snark?\n\nI could look up the records if I want to, I suppose. The fact is, no matter whichever bloggers I snark on, I don't go the extra step of looking up their information. Because to me, that's creepy. It doesn't matter that it may take only 7 minutes. There is something inherently creepy about deciding to look up someone's residence and the records thereof because you have a problem with them talking about the child that died in front of them.\n\nDO NOT SAY it's just your job. You made the choice to look up the records as a personal decision, not something your boss told you to, and if you don't like being told that's creepy and \"obsessed\", perhaps you ought to keep that to yourself, or even, not do it in the first place.\n\nDo I think the Spohrs are the Best Bloggers Ever and Can Do No Wrong? Heck no. I just think they're people I can relate to and I enjoy reading their blog. When I'm dealing with my own grief, I know that I'm not the only person who has had to deal with grief because of their writing. I like seeing pictures of the kids just as much as I like looking at pictures of kittens.\n\nsurrenderdorothy said\n\nRegardless of who is right here (although come on, they would hand back every red cent if they could get Maddie back— writing about a death that affected a person isn't exploiting it. Remembering Maddie on her birthday week is what I'd expect) this property title stuff is creepy and gross. Especially because it's just being done to prove a point that's all speculation on the part of GOMI, anyway. If Heather was making claims or begging for handouts, then you arguably might have more leeway, but it's especially creepy here.\n\nI like the Spohrs a lot, but I would say the same about Cecily or Jenna, both of whom I can't stand. Getting into where they live isn't snark, it's stalkery.\n\nYou can feel that way, but I disagree.\n\nProperty records are public. Always have been, probably always will be. Because there is nothing inherently creepy about knowing who owns a property, what they paid for it, etc. It serves a public purpose.\n\nThat I can search an address and say, \"This home was purchased by H and M Spohr on x/x/11\" isn't creepy or threatening or… anything, really. It would be absolutely meaningless if it weren't for their whoring out their lives on the internet for all to see. So if it's creepy that I am able to access said records about a family whom I've never met, but about whom I know so many intimate details of their lives, the creepiness factor is on THEM alone. Want privacy? Don't write about your lives on the internet.\n\nsurrenderdorothy said\n\nRegardless of who is right here (although come on, they would hand back every red cent if they could get Maddie back— writing about a death that affected a person isn't exploiting it.

Why do we care whether they rented or owned the place they don't live in anymore?\n\nIt was my criticism of them that they have exploited their daughter's death to make a living for themselves. Someone suggested that the blog isn't their livelihood, and I countered that, in fact, the blog does seem to make up a large percentage of their income. They went from renting a 2 bedroom apartment to purchasing a home for $585,000 within 2 years of m's death. That kind of home price apparently wasn't in their budget before their kid died. Their financial situation improved vastly as a result of M's death because they exploit the shit out of it for $$$$$.\n\nSome people who don't know what they're talking about tried to claim \"friend of friend who knows them\" knew that they owned the condo to suggest their finances haven't changed quite so drastically, but alas, they are proven wrong.\n\nHankMardukas said\n\nReply Hazy Try Again said\n\nI don't understand.

Your \"common knowledge\" from \"very close friends\" is not supported in public property records. There is no reasonable explanation for why there would be no deed to or from Mike or Heather in relation to that condo if they did in fact own it. There are also the references to being NEW homeowners they made on their own shitty blog, as I posted above.\n\nYou are wrong.

The end.\n\nTasty Dry Cat Food said\n\nThere is a huge difference between blogging about your life and specifically engaging in behaviors or creating photo ops and events to garner pageviews/sponsors/etc.\n\nThat is the difference between the Spohrs and other bloggers. They share photos, thoughts and events in their family life, but they don't make things up or share their lives with the though of \"What can this get me?\" I'm sure they have made some money off their blog, but do you honestly think they could earn enough or would get a mortgage based on two year's income from a blogging platform? And how stupid would you have to be to think that type of infamy, if it exists, would carry them through the terms of a 15 our 30 year mortgage?\n\nCorrect me if I am wrong, but isn't he a screen writer and she worked/works for a sports franchise? This can both be seriously lucrative careers.\n\nYes, she worked in sales for the Dodgers, if she got paid commission I'm sure she raked it in. Mike is a screenwriter and just wrote that he's been in development with a production company. Don't know what the status is on that since he just started another job."
