        "text": "earth\n\nGREAT JESUS!!!! Have you seen this Disney movie \"earth\" I took my nearly 5 year old to see it yesterday, and I regret it. Probably 70% of the movie is just animals eating other animals, actually eating baby animals. Tigers eating baby elephants, polar bears eating baby walrus', sharks eating seals, and the piece de resistance the slow motion cheetah chasing down and catching some kind of baby gazelle it was all carnivorous all the time. I don't know what they were thinking. There was a small portion that was the beauty of nature but it was considerably out weighed by the carnage.\n\nMy daughter's comment when I asked her if it was to scary, was \"no just sad\".\n\nI give \"earth\" two thumbs down. Don't go see it with your young children.\n\nI can't imagine who thought this level of violence meritted a G rating.\n\nNo Cancun! Dumb Swine Flu!!\n\nSadly after many months of planning we have had to abandon our trip to Cancun because of the swine flu. With a small child risky travel loses it's appeal completely. It's not like I was all that risky to start with, after 9/11 I canceled my honeymoon in Europe. I got married September 23, so in my defense it was still early days, and we weren't sure what was going on. Still I know another couple that got married the same weekend and they still went on their honeymoon.\n\nAnyway, I digress. The trip I want to complain about canceling is this one to Cancun. At first I wanted to believe that the swine flu was just nothing, but with each day it became more and more difficult. Finally, when all those kids in New York got sick after spending spring break in Cancun, I had to admit the trip was off.\n\nI know I should just be grateful that we are all healthy, but I really like margaritas and laying by the pool, a lot. Oddly it's like this trip was jinxed from the word go. First we were scared about all the drug/gang violence, and when we finally got comfortable with that situation, this one surfaced. It's like my twitter update said \"we were never meant to be\".\n\nAll of this is by way off an excuse to explain why I haven't posted in several days. I've been busy getting flight fees waved and trying to find another time share available, and co-ordinating with the other family we were going with. But now that that it is all done, you have my full attention. I'll just pretend that this Coke is a margarita and the computer desk is the pool.\n\nMama Mia\n\nI don't know what my problem is lately, I'm just not that excited about my musical comedies these days. I saw Mama Mia at The Pantages last week, and it was fun and all but I just couldn't get that into it. The cast and music were great, I think it's just me. Maybe The Drowsy Chaperon ruined me for all others. I loved that show sooo much!\n\nAnyway, I'm giving musical comedy another chance with Back to Bacharach and David tomorrow night so hopefully that will pull me out of my funk. I'll let you know how it goes. Conveniently, it's at The Music Box just around the corner from Cafe Wa S, so I'll get my chance to listen to the piano music in the bar.\n\nWish me luck\n\nHappy Earth Day\n\nI'm keeping it green every day by arranging my life so I drive as little as possible. As a side benefit it keeps a little green in the pocket too. I'm lucky enough to be able to work less than a block from my house. My daughter's schools (oh yeah she's at two till kindergarten starts in the fall) are both walking distance from our house. Sometimes I do have to pull the kid in a wagon, but I hardly emit any carbon.\n\nI know this isn't possible for everyone, but I would recommend it. Tonight we walked to the school open house, then walked to dinner with neighbors and then walked home.\n\nCourse, my husband drives 45 minutes to work, each way. So we probably just break even. So I'll keep using my clothe grocery bags, composting, and all the rest. In the hopes that it makes up for it a bit more.\n\nHappy Earth Day\n\nFYI I'm pretty sure Earth Day is on April 22 in honor of Eddie Albert, it's his birthday.\n\nIt's All In Black and White\n\nHere's a list of great Black and White movies. If you know me you know I love old movies. So, here's a list, off the top of my head, of must sees.\n\nBorn Yesterday-this is the original with William Holden and Judy Holliday\n\nMy Man Godfrey-Carole Lombard and William Powell\n\nHis Girl Friday-Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell\n\nSullivan's Travels-Veronica Lake and Joel Mcrea This is directed by Preston Sturges I think I'd recommend anything from him.\n\nAnyway, this is just a mini list please add to it in the comment section. I'll revisit this topic from time to time as movies come to mind that I love.\n\nOOOH The Thin Man, Bringing Up Baby,...So many I'll never run out.\n\nDining Out-Ivan Kane's Cafe WA S\n\nIvan Kane's Cafe WA S (that's not a typo, that's how they write it) is fabulous. I went the other night and everything was wonderful. I had the bacon wrapped dates, the gorgonzola salad, escargot, and bouillabaisse. Don't worry, I was sharing with my dinner mates. Every single thing was amazing and I don't even like dates. Even the bread, served in a paper bag, was spectacular.\n\nThey also have a piano player on a revolving dais. I thought he would be playing jazz standards, like they usually do, but he played great versions of Cold Play, Pink Floyd, David Bowie, and the like. I was there early, but they have a bar and I'm sure it would be fun to hang out and listen late into the evening.\n\nThe decor is eclectic but beautiful. There are multi levels and chandeliers on the floor. You have to see it to believe it. I asked what was in the site before and the hostess told me Shwab's pharmacy of Hollywood fame. I'm not sure about that since I'm pretty sure that was on Sunset, but whatever.\n\nIn short I highly recommend this place.\n\nIvan Kane's Cafe WA S\n\n1521 N. Vine St.\n\nHollywood, CA 90028\n\n323-466-5400\n\nhttp://www.cafewas.com\n\nOprah Oprah Oprah\n\nWell, after several weeks I think I'm free to spill the beans on my near miss with the Oprah show. Three weeks ago, the Oprah show contacted one of my neighbors, after coming across some blogs she wrote about our neighborhood block party, chili cook, and all the other stuff we do. I tell ya this community building stuff really pays off. Anyway, the Oprah shows idea was to pick four neighbors to exchange furniture for a recession version makeover show.\n\nGuess what...they didn't pick me. BOOO!!! SO just as I was not on the antique roadshow several months ago, I will not be on the Oprah show in a few weeks. Though you can tivo it and look for me in the background. Oh Yeah I was loitering all over the place, so much so that I became the unofficial PA on the shoot.\n\nThe crew was so so nice. Oprah really knows how to pick em'. Janet and Nathaniel(I think they were producers) were adorable. Peter Walsh the declutter guy was really funny, and Nate Berkus was crazy friendly. Nate actually came over and introduced himself to me. I even got a few of his decorating secrets.\n\nAll and all It was great not being on Oprah, I highly recommend it, especially since you don't have to obsess about what to wear, or how your hair looks.\n\nI'll update this post when I know the air date.\n\nWill the Real Mommy Blogger Please Stand Up\n\nMommy bloggers have been slapped with so many labels who can keep track. Are we Borgs, petty infighters, altruistic do gooders, or just ceaseless whiners. Really I don't know, probably a combination of all of them. In the last few days though I think we have shown that we are universally about family and when push comes to shove supporting families in need.\n\nSure, it's entertaining to complain about the trials of parenting, house cleaning, working and trying to maintain a relationship with our spouses. This week, however, when one of our own had the worse possible happen, the passing of a child, we all dropped what we were doing and did what we could to support the Spohr family. 100's of blogs posted about their beautiful daughter, Maddie, asking for donations to March of Dimes, in her memory. In less than 24 hours over $10,000.00 was donated. Many have volunteered to walk in the March of Dimes, country wide. When the Spohrs site went down due to excessive traffic, mom bloggers stepped up and got it moved and running again in one day.\n\nSo whatever they say about us, they better hope, when the you know what hits the fan, we're on their side.\n\nTo donate to the March of Dimes or walk for Madeline Spohr, please click here.\n\nMy New Baby\n\nI am finally going to have another baby!! I know you're thinking, but what about all those promises I made about never having another baby??? Well, I am not actually the one carrying this one. The Real Mama is my dearest friend. She has just finished her first trimester and now I can tell everyone I want. She even managed to make it a boy so I can have one of each. She really is a good friend.\n\nIt's amazing how much I've forgotten in the 5 years since I was pregnant. All the crazy test names, and hormones, and procedures...It's all a blank. I don't know how much help I'm going to be drawing a complete blank, but I'm making up for it in excitement.\n\nOprah today\n\nI just watched today's Oprah. She had on a whole mess of \"mommy bloggers\" and just straight moms and the star of the new show, In The Motherhood. They were all talking about their experiences as mothers. How no one had told them how hard mothering was going to be, and when they found out, how alone they felt. Most of it was funny, and the usual conversation, for me anyway, when any group of moms gets together, and play who is screwing up their parenting worse.\n\nWhat I thought was strange was how they all kept saying no one talked about these things. How they felt so alone in their ineptitude. That was not my experience at all. All the moms I know sat around, basically from day one, and said \"wow, this is hard. I can't bath, I don't sleep, nursing is difficult, and much much more. I never felt alone in the crappy mom and grooming department.\n\nI don't know where these women live but I'm grateful, it's not in my corner of Los Angeles. I don't think I would have made it without all my girls/moms backing me up. They were everyone from my closest friends to a stranger I happen to sit next to in the sand box.\n\nSo make sure you get out there and spread the truth...Motherhood is what it is(and by is what I mean is a hellish gulag of indentured servitude) and showering will just have to wait.\n\nLos Angelista just made an excellent point on twitter, about how they should have turned the conversation from poop to advocacy. You know what might make it easier for mothers, socialized childcare, longer maternity leave and oh about a hundred other things the gov'ts of many other countries provide."
