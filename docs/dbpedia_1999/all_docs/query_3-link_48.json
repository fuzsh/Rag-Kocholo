        "text": "I am routinely asked for specific parenting resources that cover the wide range of experiences parents can have. In order to make it easier to find these resources, I created a list of Facebook pages to share as needed.\n\nI recommend pages that are current with research, tell stories that help us to be better parents, and provide concrete, useful parenting strategies. If one of your favourite pages is not on this list, I’d love to know about it—please put a link to it in the comments below.\n\nHere are my go-to parenting Facebook pages:\n\nADHD: Children and Adults with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD)\n\nAdoption: Two mothers who write about their experience with adoption are the editor-in-chief of The New York Times Motherlode, K.J. Dell' Antonia and psychotherapist Kristen Howerton, also Adoption Council of Canada (The Motherlode doesn't have a FB page, so I linked their website.)\n\nAllergies: Irritated By Allergies by Alexandria Durrell\n\nAnxiety (in children): This psychotherapist has a book called THE FEAR FIX and writes about anxiety - Sarah Chana Radcliffe\n\nAsperger’s Syndrome (Also called Asperger’s Disorder): Asperger Syndrome Awareness, Asperger's Society of Ontario\n\nAttachment Parenting: Attachment Parenting International\n\nAutism Spectrum Disorder: Autism Awareness, Autism Society of America, Personal Blogs: Other Side of the Coin--Autism Blog by Julie M Green, also the co-founder of Mabel's Labels, Julie Cole, writes about autism on their blog.\n\nDeath, Loss and Grieving: There are two mothers who have experienced significant loss and write about this. Heather Spohr lost her young child and writes about that among other topics on her blog, The Spohrs Are Multiplying. Also, Psychology Today writer, Marilyn Price-Mitchell, PhD lost her husband when her children were young, and beautifully writes about that on her personal page: Roots Of Action\n\nEducation: Little Pickle Press, Jessica Lahey, Teacher Tom\n\nLearning Disabilities: National Center for Learning Disabilities, Reading Development and \"Disability\" Community\n\nMental Health: NIH National Institute of Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Mental Health Awareness Australia\n\nNutrition/ Picky Eating: Sarah Remmer Nutrition Consulting, Today I Ate A Rainbow\n\nPostpartum Depression: Postpartum Progress, Life With A Baby\n\nRelationships: Kelly Flannigan Bos - Psychotherapist, The Gottman Institute\n\nSame Sex Families (LGBTQ): Proud Parenting, LGBTQ Parenting Network\n\nSpecial Needs: Love That Max, Parenting Special Needs Magazine\n\nSexuality Education (for kids and couples): Nadine Thornhill - Sexuality Educator\n\nTravelling alone: Journeywoman\n\nTravelling with children: Globetrotting Mama\n\nThis post lists all my favourite books and pages about parenting/ positive discipline/ behavioural issues: \"My Favourite Parenting Things.\"\n\nAnd MY page Andrea Nair - parenting educator for all things parenting.\n\nAndrea Loewen Nair, B.Ed., M.A is a former teacher & psychotherapist and the founder of Infinity School. She is also a parenting educator, writer, media panelist, and mom of two teenagers. Her passion is to equip teachers and parents to connect and support the children in their lives and to improve education and school life.\n\nAndrea was cruising along as a psychotherapist but when children arrived, her life suddenly felt mostly tough. In the need to find a way to change that, Andrea discovered tricks, books, parenting colleagues, advice, how to laugh again, and her own good sense. At YMC, Andrea will be writing about all the things that helped her from being a scary mummy to a thriving one. BUT you won’t find any parenting judgement here! We’ve all been there and done that. Andrea has the hole her foot made in a wall to prove it. We’re in this parenting maze together.\n\nWould you like to better connect with your kids? Andrea would love to help.\n\nFollow Andrea on Twitter: @andreamloewen and instagram at @andrea.loewen.nair"
