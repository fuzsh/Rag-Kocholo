        "text": "OMAHA, Neb., Oct. 19 /PRNewswire/ -- Chef Boyardee®, a brand of ConAgra Foods, has launched Club Mum (http://www.ClubMum.net), an easy-to-navigate online community for moms to share insider experiences, ideas and helpful hints about family mealtime and other popular topics.\n\nLed by a panel of four popular bloggers, Club Mum – a play on moms being 'mum' about their best-kept secrets – is a new forum for moms to connect online and share their tips for how they deliver the \"good stuff\" to their kids. The website includes editorial and video content on a broad range of subjects, such as getting more vegetables into kids' diets, keeping kids active during winter weather, strategies for dealing with picky eaters, packing nutritious lunches and encouraging philanthropy among the whole family. In addition, the brand has launched a Club Mum Facebook page, which mirrors the Club Mum site and serves as an additional tool of engagement.\n\n\"Being a mom is tough work, and Club Mum is a great way to learn tips and tricks on parenting from other moms,\" said Jodi Grundig, mom blogger of www.MultiTaskingMommy.com and Club Mum panelist. \"Like many moms, I have my own secret strategies for getting my kids to do things that are good for them– from making mealtime decisions to encouraging good habits and smooth bedtime routines. So it's comforting to have a destination where women can share the ups and downs of motherhood and our best kept secrets for keeping the peace at the dinner table and beyond.\"\n\nAlong with Grundig, Club Mum's blog panelists include Laurin Evans of www.AimingLow.com, Heather Spohr of www.TheSpohrsAreMultiplying.com and Sylvia Martinez of www.mamalatinatips.com, who will post in both English and Spanish.\n\nChef Serves-Up Whole Grains\n\nChef Boyardee has expanded some of its most popular canned pastas, to further help moms deliver the good stuff to their kids. The new line of Whole Grain Beefaroni, Lasagna and Mini ABC's & 123's offer the goodness of whole grains and a full serving of vegetables(1). The latest offerings are wholesome, traditional, Italian-inspired meals that appeal to the entire family, in the tradition of Chef Boyardee.\n\n\"Chef Boyardee with whole grain creates a true win-win. Moms can feed their kids a wholesome meal they feel good about, and kids already love the taste of Chef Boyardee. No one has to compromise,\" said Laura Flanagan, president of shelf stable meals at ConAgra Foods.\n\nThe food pyramid recommends whole grains make up at least half of the grains a child consumes, because they contain many nutrients children need. But parents know it can be a struggle to get kids to eat more wholesome foods.\n\nA great way to get more whole grains into kids' diets is to replace foods they already eat with a whole-grain variety. \"Parents can feel even better about serving whole grain Chef Boyardee knowing they contain a full serving of vegetables(2),\" Flanagan said.\n\nFor more information, please visit www.clubmum.net and www.chefboyardee.com.\n\nABOUT CONAGRA FOODS\n\nConAgra Foods, Inc., (NYSE: CAG) is one of North America's leading food companies, with brands in 97 percent of America's households.
