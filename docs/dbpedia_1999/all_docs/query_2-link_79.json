        "text": "Tomorrow is my wedding anniversary, and I’m terribly sad.\n\nI miss the man I married.\n\nHe was my best friend. The kind of man who loved me not in spite of my quirks and faults, but because of them.\n\nWe were so deliriously happy, for so many years.\n\nHe slipped away, somehow. In the passage of time, he lost himself.\n\nFor nearly 13 years, I loved him with an intensity that overwhelms me, even now.\n\nAnd still he demanded more…. more than I could give without snapping myself in two.\n\nI thought we could make it through anything.\n\nWhat a damn shame.\n\nOne of the people I’ve reconnected with recently is my beloved cousin Nicholas, who is currently serving a tour of duty in Afghanistan.\n\nWe’ve been through a lot together, Nick and I. He’s definitely someone I’d want to have in my life even if we weren’t related and didn’t have dozens of blackmail-worthy stories to tell about each other.\n\nNick is a music lover, through and through, and has even played me a song or two on his guitar whenever we’ve gotten together, without me having to twist his arm too very hard. When I confessed that I only just came into possession of an ipod, he stepped up to the plate to help me fill it.\n\nAnd by the way – that is exactly the reason I haven’t bothered to get an ipod until now. Choosing songs seems like a daunting task, especially for someone who doesn’t have a lot of time to browse through the millions available on itunes.\n\nEach day, Nick sends me the lyrics to a song, I read it, YouTube it, and if I like it, I buy it from itunes and download it to my ipod. Sounds complicated, I know, but it’s really not.\n\nLet me just say, this is an amazing way to discover music.\n\nFor the most part, he sends me songs I’ve never heard, which makes the lyrics read like amazing poetry. Some of the songs can make me cry or laugh or say, “Fuck yeah!” before I’ve ever even heard the words set to music.\n\nAnd then once I do hear the songs, I feel like I appreciate them in a way I wouldn’t have, otherwise. Especially since Nick and I have very different tastes in music. Or at least we did, before he started schooling me on the art of “real” music. Although, to this I say: Whatever, dude! Top 40 is music whether you like it or not!\n\nI’m so glad Kellydropped an ipod in my lap, and that I’m filling it in such a unique way. And I love that even though Nick and I are 7500 miles apart, he can still brighten my day with music.\n\nSo tell me: Are there any songs y’all think are an absolute must for my music library? Help a girl out!\n\nLast weekend in Las Vegas, I….\n\n… Formed my own posse since the rodeo was in town.\n\nFortunately Ash, Meghan and Ali graciously offered up their husbands Kevin, DJ and Gav so that it wouldn’t be a lonely one-woman show.\n\nThe smiles in the above photo were sponsored entirely by Crown Royal Black. Those drink ladies followed us around the entire time, pushing their little samples. Although, now that I think about it, they probably just wanted to join my kick ass rodeo posse.\n\n*\n\n… Learned how to lap dance and work the pole at a Stripper101 class\n\n**\n\n… Watched Elvis officiate Brittany and Andy’s “I Still Do” vow renewal at the fabulous Rumor Boutique Hotel.\n\n**\n\n… Ate sushi off of a naked geisha\n\n**\n\nand also had the best Sliders on the planet, made by chef Vic Vegas.\n\n… Got to hang out with people I absolutely love, like Maura, Meghan, Greis, Heather and Mike, as well as a few I’ve only just begun to stalk adore.\n\nme with Greis **\n\n… Had such a fantastic time. It was so much fun, and it was all thanks to the lovely women behind Mouth Media. Heather, Brittany and Shauna: Thank you, ladies! You throw one hell of a party!\n\nI never even took my camera out of my bag, so photo credits above go to:\n\n* Greis and ** MouthMedia / Heather Spohr"
