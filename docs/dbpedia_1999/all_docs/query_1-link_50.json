        "text": "Monday marked the end of the fourth annual Blogust, a month-long blog relay that brought together more than 50 of North America’s most beloved online writers, photo and video bloggers and Shot@Life Champions to share inspirational quotes for their children on their blogs and social platforms. Each like, comment or share of their posts resulted in the donation of a vaccine to children around the world.\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, The Motherhood partnered with the UN Foundation and Shot@Life to lead the initiative. After surpassing our original goal of 50,000 vaccine donations three weeks into the program, sponsor Project Perpetual agreed to increase the goal to 60,000.\n\nToday we can share that the final tally of likes, comments and shares brought us to 61,862! Thanks to all the amazing hard work of this year’s Blogust team, Project Perpetual will be donating 60,000 vaccines to children globally.\n\nIn case you missed it, the theme for this year was inspiring quotes. Each day, two or three bloggers posted a quote that inspired them and asked their readers to like, comment and share. The Motherhood has gathered a few of our favorites here:\n\nLooking for more inspirational quotes from Blogust? You can find them all on our Pinterest board!

Also joining this year are Anne Geddes, one of the world’s most well-known photographers, and actress Jo Frost (Supernanny, Family Matters, Extreme Parental Guidance).\n\nFor the month of August, two to three bloggers will post each weekday. For every “like”, comment and social media share their posts receive during the month, Project Perpetual will donate one vaccine to a child around the world (up to 50,000 vaccines).\n\nThe Motherhood has had the great privilege of working with the UN Foundation and Shot@Life on Blogust every year since its inception in 2012.\n\nTo kick off #Blogust, the Shot@Life team will be hosting a Twitter party on August 3 (today!) from 1-2 p.m. ET. We would love to see you there – every tweet with #Blogust or @ShotAtLife during this hour equals one vaccine for a child around the world.\n\nPlease visit Shot@Life every day to find the latest Blogust posts – and be sure to comment on, like and share them. Your actions matter. Together we will help 50,000 kids receive the vaccines they need the most."
