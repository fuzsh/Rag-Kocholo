        "text": "Hello Friends! I am so excited to be part of this 2-day Pretty Pink Posh November release blog hop. This release has me so excited for Christmas! I have couple of cards I want to share today.\n\nCard 1:\n\nI admit it- I’m addicted to shaker cards. They’re so much fun to make! I stamped and Copic-colored the holly from Elegant Holly stamp set, and used the coordinating dies to cut them out. For the shaker element, I ink-blended Festive Berries and Spun sugar Distress Oxide inks onto Bristol Smooth paper, tapped water and shimmer spray all over the paper, and dabbed the water off with a towel. I used the Ornament Shaker Die to die-cut the ornament window out, and die cut the topper out of chunky rose gold glitter paper. For the background, I used a rose gold textured shimmer paper. I die-cut the ornament again to make a window, then splattered watered-down white acrylic paint. I closed the front of the window with acetate, and assembled shaker card. I filled the window with Clear Jewels, and closed the back. After I finished layering the holly, I attached the card front to an A2 size card base.\n\nCard 2:\n\nThis card I took my time with. These ornaments are from the Decorative Ornaments stamp set, and are so beautifully detailed. I colored with Copic markers first, then added details with very sharp Faber Castell Polychromo pencils. I kept the card clean, drawing lines for the strings with a microline pen and T-ruler, and adding a few jewels picked from the new Holiday Jewels Mix. I adhered the panel onto fun foam for dimension, and attached it to an A2 size card base.\n\nThanks so much for visiting today. I hope I have inspired some ideas for you to create with.\n\nNow onto the GIVEAWAY!\n\nThere are 4 $25 gift certificates up for grabs (two winners each day).
