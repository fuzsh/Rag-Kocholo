        "text": "Sometimes I change my status updates on Facebook or I tweet something out and instead of it being ignored, responded to, favorited or whatever the cool kids are doing these days, the responses end up going in a direction I did not intend or could have even predicted. Remember that time I wrote a funny little status update about my van slowly centimeter-ing its way down the driveway? I mean, to me, the entire scene was hilarious. I was in my house and my car√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthat was turned off!√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwas moving, albeit slooooowly, down the driveway. Seeing as there was really nothing I could do about it, I social media-d it. I *am* a blogger, you know√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùit‚Äôs really what any decent one of us would have done.\n\nHilarious.√Ç\n\nBut then the responses came in√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùand I was shocked by how un-hilarious people found it. I got comments and tweets and even emails telling me how irresponsible and unsafe I was. Irresponsible? Unsafe? I was in my home and my car was moving√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe actually only unsafe thing I could probably do is go outside to my car. But, you know, people are quick to jump on me. I‚Äôm actually not really even sure why√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùmaybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm only funny some of the time? You see, funny people? Their tweets and Facebook status updates are understood. My tweets and Facebook status updates? NOT SO MUCH.\n\nDear Ali, stop trying to be funny.\n\nThe other day I tweeted something and was a little surprised√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùagain√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùat the direction the responses went.\n\nThat‚Äôs such an invasion of privacy, Ali!\n\nI can‚Äôt believe you do that, Ali. That‚Äôs gross.√Ç\n\nWow, I hope she‚Äôs googling you too.√Ç\n\nThat‚Äôs crossing a line, I think.√Ç\n\nUm. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not YOUR kid‚Äôs teacher.√Ç\n\nHow would *you* feel if they were at home googling you now?\n\nReally? Unless there was a serious concern for safety or something, I would never Google students or their families.\n\nI teach my HS students about the balance of can and should as it relates to SM etiquette, prof vs personal. #justmyopinion üôÇ\n\nWOW.\n\nI was not expecting this response at all.\n\nHonestly, I don‚Äôt really feel the need to defend my social media actions or my real-life actions, but, well, for the sake of a little background here, I will tell you this.√Ç My three kids will be going to a brand-new school next year. It‚Äôs across the street from our house (major win, I‚Äôd say), sure, but I don‚Äôt know a single other parent in the school, I don‚Äôt know the administration, I don‚Äôt know any of the teachers. I will be sending my three young children√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwho are just 11, 9, and 7√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùto spend the hours between nine in the morning and three in the afternoon with strangers; people I know√Ç absolutely√Ç not a single thing about.\n\nIn years past√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùwhen my kids went to a school where I knew many parents, faculty members, kids, and teachers√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe verymoment I found out the name of a child‚Äôs teacher, I‚Äôd ask around. ‚ÄúHey person who I know very well! Have any of your kids had Ms. First? What do you know about her? Is she tough? Sweet? Young? Old? Did your kids love her? Learn a lot from her? Did she push your child or did she allow your child to do the pushing? Does she give a lot of homework? Does she give a lot of feedback? Does she intervene in social situations?‚Äù\n\nThese seem like normal questions.√Ç It‚Äôs nice to get a sense of a teacher going in.√Ç I know that every kid has a different experience with every teacher.√Ç I have seen this first-hand. A teacher might be the perfect, snug fit for my daughter, but not a great match-up for my son. You can never tell. Ever.\n\nBUT.\n\nI think it‚Äôs nice to know a little bit in advance.√Ç I don‚Äôt care what Ms. First does on the weekends with her friends. I don‚Äôt care if Ms. First drives a Honda. I don‚Äôt care if she goes to a cottage, where she buys her groceries, what reality tv she likes to watch.\n\nI‚Äôm not looking for DIRT; I‚Äôm looking for information.\n\nI‚Äôm not looking for PERSONAL information; I‚Äôm looking for PROFESSIONAL information.√Ç\n\nHow many years has she been teaching? Does she have any advance degrees? Has she ever won any teaching awards? Does she have a speciality? Where did she go to college? Do people think she‚Äôs an okay teacher, a good teacher, a great teacher?\n\nNOT\n\nDoes she drink white or red wine? Does she wear skinny jeans? What street does she live on? Has she ever inhaled? Does she watch Here Comes Honey Boo Boo?√Ç\n\nSo, yes, I did try to make that status a funny one, something I thought people would get a good giggle out of. I mean, in my head it was funny. (Maybe I‚Äôm just not funny.)\n\nAnd yes, I did google their names√¢‚Ç¨‚ÄùI make absolutely NOT A SINGLE apology for this. With no warm-blooded, real-life person around me to ask and with the world at my googling fingertips, why shouldn‚Äôt I? Why WOULDN‚ÄôT you? To me, it seems like the more responsible to thing to do.\n\nThese are my children I‚Äôm looking out for√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùmy three most important treasures, my entire world.\n\nBut you can go ahead and think that it‚Äôs gross."
