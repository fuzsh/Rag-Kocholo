Maddie, as she is known to many across the blogosphere, was born prematurely in 2007 and died on April 7 after taking ill and being rushed by ambulance to a hospital. The news posted by a friend crashed the server that hosted Heather's blog. Updates are posted there on a new server and at Heather's Twitter account. The L.A. Times ran a story, as did Channel 5. The 2:30 p.m. service is in Old North Chapel at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills."
