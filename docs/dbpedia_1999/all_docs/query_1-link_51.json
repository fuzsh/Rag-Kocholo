Winners will be posted on the Simon Says Stamp blog on Wednesday, January 17th. If you’re a winner, just email Simon Says Stamp to claim your prize!\n\nFor my stop on the hop, I’m sharing THREE super fun treat boxes I created using items from this amazing release (and a few products from previous releases, too)! Each treat box features one of the adorable faces in the new Hello There stamp set. I think I love them even more than I love the treats inside them!\n\nPlus, I have a video showing how I made each of these treat boxes (see below, or click here)!\n\nHere’s a closer look at each of the treat boxes:\n\nBunny Windowed Treat Box:\n\nDog Candy Bar Treat Wrapper:\n\nAnd the most adorable Cat Pillow Box:\n\nAren’t they just the cutest!?!\n\nTo make these treat boxes you can follow the instructions below; however, I thought it might be easier to watch a quick video. If you’re interested in the video, you can find it on my YouTube Channel or watch it here:\n\nWritten Instructions:\n\nDie cut (or cut) your “box” from patterned paper and assemble. I used a pillow box (with the cat), a windowed treat box (with the bunny), and two strips of 12×12 paper to make the candybar wrap (with the dog). You can really use anything you want for your box – even a lunch bag or a cellophane bag would work.\n\nStamp your animal faces using Copic marker friendly ink, then color them with Copic markers.\n\nAdd a few dots and lines with a gel pen if desired.\n\nDie cut each of the faces. Note that that die does not cut out the bottom of the face – this gives you some flexibility for positioning each one wherever you like on your project. I cut each of mine with a scissors straight across the bottom.\n\nAdhere your animal faces to your treat boxes using liquid glue.\n\nUse ribbon to close your boxes.\n\nFor the candybar wrap (with the dog): You’ll want to cut a circle out of one end of the patterned paper strip for the candybar to tuck into. This will help hold it in place. Depending on the length of your candybar, you may need to attach 2 strips of patterned paper end to end like I did. Also, I adhered my dogs face to a tag and tied the ribbon around the entire package – you need the ribbon to hold the treat inside (see the picture below of a side view that might help). You can add a sentiment as well, if desired.\n\nAdd a few gems for some shine!\n\nThank you for stopping by my blog today and for joining in on our Hop!
