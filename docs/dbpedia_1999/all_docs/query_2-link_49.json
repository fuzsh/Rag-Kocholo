        "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AT&T* announced today that it is supporting a nationwide effort to help connect expectant mothers and families with weekly tips to support healthy pregnancies – and healthy babies – via text messaging. It's called text4baby, and it's now available at no charge to expectant mothers across the country.\n\nAT&T is joining CTIA – the Wireless Association and other wireless carriers and device manufacturers in the initiative, which is an educational program of the National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition (HMHB). The text tips apply to expecting moms who are as early as four weeks into pregnancy, through the first twelve months of their children's lives. All participating moms-to-be need to opt in is a wireless phone that receives texts.\n\nTo opt in to text4baby, expectant family members can text BABY (for English-language tips) or BEBE (for Spanish-language tips) to 511411. After providing information on the due date, the program will begin sending the user a weekly text message containing health and medical guidance timed for that week of the pregnancy.\n\nTo help text4baby reach millions of families by Mother's Day 2010 with the good news and free text tips, AT&T is joining forces with well-known mom blogger Heather Spohr. Named \"Best Mommy Blogger of 2009\" by thebump.com, Spohr's blog, \"The Spohrs Are Multiplying,\" initially became popular as she detailed her family's experiences dealing with a high-risk pregnancy, an extended NICU stay and the difficulties of caring for a premature baby.\n\n\"As someone who has faced difficult pregnancies I know how important being informed is to your child's well-being,\" said Spohr. \"This is why I am thrilled to help support a program that focuses on getting as much information into the hands of expecting and new parents as quickly and easily as possible.\"\n\nSince text4baby health tips will vary based on the due date of participating moms, AT&T has also invited two real world expecting moms-to-be to opt in to the text4baby text tips, help promote the cause, and share what they learn along the way. Beginning next week, AT&T employees and moms Nicole Anderson and Laura Hernandez will be guest bloggers for AT&T's mom blog, Calm, Cool, Connected.\n\nAnderson works for the AT&T Foundation, the philanthropic arm of AT&T, and Hernandez works in diversity marketing. This is the first pregnancy for both women, who are expecting in the spring. They join a group of fellow employee mom and dad bloggers and will continue posting through Mother's Day 2010. For more information, go to http://calmcoolconnected.com/.\n\n\"At AT&T, we're glad to support text4baby and the many families who will benefit from it,\" said Cindy Brinkley, AT&T senior vice president, talent development and chief diversity officer. \"We are proud of our long-standing support of women in the workplace – including working mothers – and the various initiatives we have in place to provide them with advancement opportunities. The long-term impact of offering tips and tools to help keep moms and pregnancies healthy – and to lead to beautiful, healthy babies for our world -- is large and lasting for us all.\"\n\nText4baby connects expecting moms with weekly health-related reminders like \"Keep your prenatal appointments. If you miss one, make another right away. Don't wait until next month. They're essential for you and your baby's health.\" Or \"Butt out! Ask people not to smoke around you. The smoke reaches your baby, and can cause serious problems.\"\n\n\"We believe the power of partnership and community can make an incredible difference in women's and children's lives,\" said Judy Meehan, executive director of the National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition. \"Text4baby brings HMHB's mission to life and with the help of our partners, we believe we can be a strong catalyst for change.\"\n\n*AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc.\n\nAbout the National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition\n\nThe National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition (HMHB) is the only coalition of its kind which acts as a catalyst for change by creating partnerships among community groups, nonprofit organizations, professional associations, businesses and government agencies.
