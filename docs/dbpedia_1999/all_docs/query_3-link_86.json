        "text": "The January 2024 Release is now available in the Pretty Pink Posh Shop and select retailers that carry our products. If you missed our post yesterday, we revealed all of the products in picture form, but if you would like to see them in a video, Mindy has that for you today!\n\nWatch the video above I Watch the video in HD on YouTube\n\nHello everyone, June here! Today I’m back to share a project with the brand new Valentine’s Day products.\n\nWhen I saw the new release, my eye instantly went to the Heart Cover Plate die, so I just had to make a card with it right away! I used Salvaged Patina and Peacock Feathers Distress Oxide to make a faded background. After that I splatted some Uncharted Mariner Distress Oxide and some thinned out white acrylic paint to add some detail.\n\nI cut some acetate to size and glued it onto my card panel. I adhered it with some thick foam tape and divided it into 6 separate windows for my shaker bits. I decided to go for the Valentine Hearts because those were my favorite from the new release. I backed it with a simple white panel.\n\nI thought it would be cute to have a small image to fill each frame, and the Sweet Chocolates stamps were perfect for that because of their size. I stamped them in brown ink to make them appear a bit softer. I decided to go for browns, pinks and yellows as a color palette.\n\nI’m always so happy when I see a scripted sentiment in a set, so you just know I had to go for the one that’s included in Sweet Chocolates. I stamped it with Saltwater Taffy Distress Oxide and finished off the sentiment with the rest of the phrase in the set. I also decided to add the ‘xoxo’ from the Sentiment Strips Valentine.\n\nPRIZES: be sure to leave comments on each stop.
