        "text": "My first daughter was only 2 when I learned I was having twins, and so I still remembered clearly how giddy people were when I was pregnant with her. They’d gleefully tell me tales of 30-hour labors, leaky bladders, struggling marriages. Not so with multiples. From the beginning, people reacted badly to the news. It was as if I had the plague and were coughing in their living room. One friend was openly angry. Some wanted to know exactly what to do to avoid this happening to them. Others just wrinkled their noses as if I’d stepped into a dog-deposited mess. “No,” they said. “Really?”\n\nSo begins the Lives essay in this weekend’s New York Times Magazine. In it novelist Samantha Hunt explores whether the increased number of multiples out there in the world has made the experience of parenting them “any more normal, or anything close to natural.”\n\nShe concludes not.\n\nOver on Momversation, blogger Rebecca Woolf, already the mother of two, has just learned she is expecting twins. I am betting she will be reading “>Hunt’s column closely. In a Momversation video this week, Woolf turned to Jen Levinson, who has two sets of identicals (plus an older singleton) and to Heather Spohr, who is herself a twin.\n\n“I’m freaking out, I never imagined four,” Woolf told them. “we’re totally scared, we’re superoverwhelmed.”\n\nLevinson’s advice?\n\n“You change one diaper, you change the next, you feed one, you feed the next.”\n\nAnd Spohr added, “I live near you, I’ll come over and help.”\n\nFor those of you who have twins, or are a twin, but who don’t live nearby, what virtual advice would you give Hunt and Woolf?"
