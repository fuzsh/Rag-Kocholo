For other uses, see Babble (disambiguation).\n\nBabble was an online magazine and blog network targeting young, educated, urban parents.[1] Their site operated a large network of parent blogs, employing many bloggers on the subjects of parenting and child-raising.\n\nIn early 2019, it was announced that Babble had been shut down.[2][3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nBabble was launched in December 2006 by co-founders Rufus Griscom and Alisa Volkman.[4] After one year, the site grew to half a million readers per month. Babble Media became an independent company in 2009,[5] and was acquired by Disney Interactive Media Group in 2011.[6][7]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe American Society of Magazine Editors (ASME) shortlisted Babble for its 2008 \"General Excellence Online\" award, writing that the \"magazine skillfully combines in-depth reporting, thoughtful journalism, a dazzling variety of blog voices and visually arresting, interactive digital features. The result is a smart, hip and endlessly entertaining website that has revolutionized the parenting field.\"[8]\n\nTime magazine listed Babble.com as one of the 50 Best Websites of 2010,[9] while Forbes named Babble as one of the Top 100 Websites for Women.[10]\n\nBabble's advertising and sponsorship policies came under fire in 2010 and 2011 after several parenting authors and bloggers noted their breastfeeding guide was sponsored by Similac maker Mead Johnson.[11]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
