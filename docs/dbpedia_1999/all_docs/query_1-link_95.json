        "text": "Hi there, crafty friends. I’m thrilled to be part of THIS blog hop celebrating THESE new DIEcember products. I have two cards to share today…\n\nTo create the first card…\n\nI die-cut thin strips using THIS die from THIS colored card stock. I covered a piece of white card stock with adhesive and laid the strips on top horizontally, covering the entire panel. I die-cut THIS die on top for a stitched border and embossed THIS die in the center using THIS embossing mat. I love stretching the use of my dies and getting new looks from them and embossing with a die instead of cutting is a great way to achieve that. I stamped, colored, and cut out an image from THIS stamp set and adhered it on the panel along with THIS die-cut word and a white heat embossed sentiment from the same stamp set.\n\nHere’s a closer look…\n\nFor the second card…\n\nI did the exact same process with the strips as the first card, but added bigger strips with THIS die and adhered them down in different directions. I used THIS die to add texture on top of the strips. I love that the die just pierces holes instead of cuts. It’s a simple way to add a lot of texture. I die-cut THIS snowflake three times, adhered them together and applied Versamark ink on top. I covered it with THIS embossing powder and heat set it to add a bit of sparkle. It’s hard to tell in the photo but in real life it is so sparkly. I finished off the design with a white heat embossed sentiment from THIS stamp set and some of THESE embellishments.\n\nHere’s a closer look…\n\nI hope this inspires you to create some quick and easy backgrounds using colored card stock strips and to add texture to them.\n\nBLOG HOP\n\nThere is much more inspiration to see.
