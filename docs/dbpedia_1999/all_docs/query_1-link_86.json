        "text": "Medusa said,\n\nI think it is more than just 'the cash' aspect though.\n\nI doubt anyone would have a problem with one's mortgage being paid by a blog devoted to, for example, fashion, or current affairs, or travel.\n\nWhen a family's bills are being paid by photos of their children, and those children can't make an informed consent to their image being used (possibly ever in Nella's case) then I believe it becomes exploitation.\n\nDon't child stars tend to have their own managers and their earnings stay their own? Blogger's children don't have that protection.\n\nI second all of this. I'd also add that a lot of these mommy bloggers seem almost as motivated by the attention they get as they are by money…and when that attention has to do with putting dozens of images of one's kids out there, that's also exploitive, whether or not we bring in the old p**oph**e question.\n\nKelle Hampton is a shining example of someone who has built an identity – a brand, even – out of her kids' likenesses. Take away her children, particularly Nella, and what would she have? Crappy fugly decorating, cheesy fashions, overwrought and unoriginal prose, and little else. She certainly wouldn't get much mileage talking about her marriage.\n\nWhat does it mean when a grown adult bases her professional identity (not to mention her family's livelihood) on showing off her kids and the things she does with them? What are the implications for the kids themselves, especially in a few short years, when they will have the critical thinking skills to wonder about all this stuff? How weird is it going to be for them to sort through their childhood memories and wonder which ones were genuine and spontaneous, which ones were created solely for blog fodder, and which ones were a convoluted mix of the two?\n\nWhat are those kids going to do when they realize that their mother became famous solely because she invaded their private spaces in all sorts of ways? How will they feel when they come to understand that thousands of internet strangers saw them in the bathtub and knew what their bedrooms look like, their expressions when they sat on Poppa's lap, their interactions with their school friends?\n\nI don't think we've even scratched the surface of what this kind of exposure is going to mean for kids like Kelle's, especially when they get older.\n\nI think it comes down to motivation. People who journal online (in the form of a blog) might do so to share with family, capture moments, and remind themselves and their children of good times.\n\nThen again you might be a popular blogger with a sponsored blog who always writes beautifully with genuine, truth to life stories told in a relatable way. Your life is beautiful, but realistic. You encourage others to be the best parent they can be but admit that it's impossible to be so perfect without help. You maintain your sense of identity, respect your children's privacy, and have comments from readers that are kind (maybe critical) but NOT obsessive, doting, or creepy (no one but family \"loves\" your child.) Think: Casey Mullins, Heather Spohr…\n\nOr, you're Kelle Hampton and you exploit your child for compliments. And cash. She clearly has another writer and/or help (nay, party planner, etc)\n\ncrankymommy said\n\n@Kitty Likes to Scratch I would add to this: do you IG the s*** out of your life for public consumption? Have you read KH's IG? Because she has some pretty intense, ahem, followers.\n\nI am not sure who said this, but I agree with that Poppa sounds mean to Kelle, actually, I think he sounds mean to some of her followers, perhaps he is aiming for cute and it comes off nasty. And what is up with grown women saying I wish you were my poppa?\n\nI don't follow KH on IG. Maybe I should, though – her IG sounds fascinating in a train wreck sort of way.\n\nAnd, no – I'm lucky if I remember to post to IG once a week. I was obsessed with it when I first joined, but then I realized that pictures of food and clouds and my kid doing random, everyday crap and cheeky self-portraits just aren't very interesting in the long run. Plus, it seems to have a lot of bugs (at least on a droid) and pisses me off quite a bit.\n\nAlso, anyone who says, \"I wish you were my poppa,\" has daddy issues. That is all.\n\nhereforthefreefood said\n\nBluth Banana Stand said\n\nMedusa said\n\nKitty Likes to Scratch said\n\nSidenote: Have KH's followers really printed and framed pics of her kids for their own home? If so, that's just bizarre.\n\nYes, they have and it is bizarre.\n\nI think it is more than just 'the cash' aspect though.\n\nI doubt anyone would have a problem with one's mortgage being paid by a blog devoted to, for example, fashion, or current affairs, or travel.\n\nWhen a family's bills are being paid by photos of their children, and those children can't make an informed consent to their image being used (possibly ever in Nella's case), then I believe it becomes exploitation.\n\nDon't child stars tend to have their own managers and their earnings stay their own? Blogger's children don't have that protection.\n\nAnd anyone aspiring to have income generating children via their mommy blog should have a little think about what childhood fame did for Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Dana Plato, Michael Jackson, Gary Coleman and Macauley Culkin.\n\nNot much to aspire to there.\n\nI am blanking on who, but in one of the other mommy blog threads someone said that a mommy blogger had started a bank account for her kids to share the blog profits. I wish I could remember which blogger, because I think that's interesting.\n\nI think Heather Spohr did that. Possibly?\n\nYep, that's who I read about. I googled and found the post where she wrote about it, but it's on Babble so you've been warned. http://www.babble.com/babble-voices/heather-spohr-more-spohr/2012/02/29/the-child-stars-of-blogging/\n\nI don't know Kelly's Korner but if someone has the link for that I'd be interested in reading it.\n\nI think Kelle Hampton would be smart to do something like this, especially for Nella. I would imagine that she will incur extra expenses for therapies and the like as she ages. Also I would think that it would be nice for her to have some money in the bank should she ever be able to move out on her own when she is old enough (sorry if that wording is clunky, I mean no disrespect)."
