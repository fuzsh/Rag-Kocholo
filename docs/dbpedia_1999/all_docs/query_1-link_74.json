        "text": "Welcome! I love the look of galaxy backgrounds but am not great with watercolor. So I thought I would try creating a few with Distress Oxide Inks. It worked incredibly well and was super easy!\n\n[All supplies are linked to multiple sources in the thumbnails at the end of this post. Compensated affiliate links used at no cost to you. To watch the video in HD on YouTube, click HERE.]\n\nTo create my galaxy backgrounds, I decided to use Distress Oxide Inks. These inks are great for “watercolor” layering and for a creamy, unique look. You can also do this technique with traditional Distress Inks, but I reallllly like the Oxide Inks even more! (To find out more about Oxide Inks and their unique properties, head HERE.)\n\nI recommend watching the video above to learn how to create these backgrounds. It is easy to do, but hard to explain. Basically, I layered Black Soot Distress Oxide Ink and pearlized water (Perfect Pearls pigment and water mix) over bright colors of Distress Oxide Ink. I also sprinkled on white paint for stars.\n\nFor my moon, I die cut a circle from cloud vellum (available in the Vellum Variety Pad) and white heat embossed images from the August Hero Arts My Monthly Hero Kit‘s stamp set. The sentiment is from the Hero Arts Astronomical Stamps Set… isn’t it a good one? And Lucy’s Cards Clear Iridescent Jewels were the perfect starry touch…\n\nFor the background, I impressed the Hero Arts Star Confetti Die into Carta Bella White Shimmer 12×12 Cardstock with my die cut machine and Spellbinders Tan Embossing Mats. I wish you could see the shine and shimmer on this in real life!!!\n\nHere is another example, but without the vellum. Check out colorful Distress Oxide Inks peeking out from the Black Soot Distress Oxide Ink I added on top…\n\nSome people prefer more colorful galaxy looks. I like subtle ones, but you could easily make this one more colorful .\n\nThis next one is very simple! I just added images from the August Hero Arts My Monthly Hero Kit‘s stamp set. The white heat embossing stands out nicely on the colorful background.\n\nI wish you could see this background in person. It has a chalky look (thanks to the Oxide Inks) and shimmer (thanks to the Perfect Pearls). Lots of texture too.\n\nBLOG HOP\n\nThis post is part of a blog hop celebrating the August Hero Arts My Monthly Hero Kit featuring fun and unique products.
