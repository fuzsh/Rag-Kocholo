        "text": "Hello all!! The Spring 2024 Catalog release is now available!!! This release is jam-packed with so so many absolutely incredible stamps, stencils, dies, letterpress + foil plates and transfers!! I have a TON of cards to share so let’s dive in!!\n\nMy first card features the Decorative Strips Stamp Set. This set coordinates with the previously release Sentiment Strips Fancy Die.\n\nTo create this card I first stamped and white heat-embossed the Decorative Strips stamp onto 5 different A2 panels of colored cardstock (Ultra Pink, Amethyst, Paradise, Kiwi, Pumpkin). I then die cut the panels with the Sentiment Strips Fancy Die.\n\nNext, I adhered the strips to the front of an A2 top-folding white card base. I then die cut “friend” out of Pitch Black cardstock with one of the dies from the Smile Friend Stamp & Cut XL. Next, I stamped and white heat-embossed a sub-sentiment from the Smile Friend Stamp & Cut XL onto Pitch Black cardstock.\n\nI then trimmed the sentiment down to a strip and adhered the strip and “friend” to the card front with foam adhesive. Lastly, I die cut a couple of butterflies with the new Butterfly Foliage Fancy Dies out of Dove White cardstock and adhered to the card front with Precision Glue.\n\nMy next card features the one of the new Letterpress + Foil Plates, the Happy Birthday Letterpress + Foil Plate. That’s right you can hot foil as well as letterpress with these new plates!!! Unfortunately all the new Letterpress + Foil Plates have been delayed and won’t be available till the end of February.\n\nTo create this card I first taped off the front of an A2 top-folding Dove White card base and then ink blended with Key Lime Fizz, Blue Raspberry, Thistle and Taffy Reactive Ink.\n\nNext, I hot foiled the Happy Birthday Letterpress + Foil Plate over card front with matte gold foil. I then die cut an A2 panel of Dove White cardstock with the new Flower Pattern Cover Plate die.\n\nI then adhered some of the flowers and leaves from the diecut to the card front with foam adhesive. I then finished the card with some gold sequins from the Champagne Sequins Mix.\n\nMy next card features the gorgeous Color Layering Marbling Stencils and that fantastic Smile Friend Stamp & Cut XL once again.\n\nTo create this card I first ink-blended over the front of an A2 top-folding Dove White card base with the Color Layering Marbling Stencils. For the first stencil in the set I ink-blended with Pool Party Reactive Ink. For the second stencil I ink-blended with Blue Raspberry Reactive Ink and for the final stencil in the set I applied Gold Hero Paste.\n\nNext, I die cut “friend” out of Mustard and gold glitter cardstock with the Smile Friend Stamp & Cut XL. I then adhered the two “friend” diecuts together, slightly off-set and then adhered to the card front.\n\nNext, I stamped and gold heat-embossed a sub-sentiment from the Smile Friend Stamp & Cut XL onto Pitch Black cardstock. Lastly, I trimmed the sub-sentiment down to a strip and then adhered to the card front with foam adhesive.\n\nMy next card features the some of the incredible new stamps, stencils and dies from the new Ralph Tyndall and Hero Arts collaborative line!!\n\nTo create this card I first ink-blended the stage scene over the front of an A2 top-folding Dove White card base with HA + RT Color Layering Stage Curtain Stencils and Butter Bar, Spicy Mustard, Fawn, Caramel and Cup O’ Joe.\n\nNext, I stamped a sentiment and performers from the HA + RT Center Stage stamp set onto the front of the card base in INTENS-ified Black Ink.\n\nI then die cut the crowd with the HA + RT Center Stage Crowd Fancy Die out of Pitch Black cardstock. Lastly, I finished the card by adhering the crowd to the card front with Precision Glue.\n\nMy last card features the beautiful Color Layering Tulip Pattern Stencils\n\nTo create this card I first ink-blended over an A2 panel of Passion Flower cardstock with the Color Layering Tulip Pattern Stencils. For the first stencil from the Color Layering Tulip Pattern Stencils I ink-blended with Berry Smoothie Reactive Ink.\n\nI then skipped stencil 2 and moved onto stencil 3 with Kiwi Core Ink and Pine for stencil 4. I then placed stencil 2 over the panel and then applied Pearl Hero Paste that I tinted with Grape Slush.\n\nI then die cut “friend” out of Dove White cardstock with one of the dies from the Smile Friend Stamp & Cut XL. I then stamped and white heat-embossed a sub-sentiment from the Smile Friend Stamp & Cut XL onto Pitch Black cardstock.
