        "text": "Friedrich August von Hayek (1899-1992) was an Austrian-British economist who won the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his groundbreaking work in understanding the coordination function of prices in economy, formulating new business cycle theory with links to monetary expansion, and investigating how a decentralised free-market economic system is feasible and advantageous over a centralised socialist planning.\n\nF A Hayek served in a field artillery battery on the Italian front during the World War I. After the war, he enrolled at the University of Vienna where he got his first doctorate in law in 1921. His classmates included some future prominent economists, including Fritz Machlup, Gottfried von Haberler, and Oskar Morgenstern. Later, in 1923, Hayek was awarded a second doctorate in political economy. During his years at the University of Vienna, Hayek was influenced by Carl Menger's work on explanatory social science research and Friedrich von Wieser's commanding classroom teaching. He also began working at a temporary government office, where he met Ludwig von Mises, a monetary theorist and a critic of socialism.\n\nIn 1931, Hayek was invited by Lionel Robbins to deliver lectures on monetary economics at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). These lectures ultimately led to his appointment the following year as the Tooke Professor of Economic Science and Statistics at LSE, where Hayek remained until 1950. This period also witnessed \"Hayek vs Keynes\", the historical debate between F A Hayek and the University of Cambridge economist John Maynard Keynes over their respective monetary economics theories. To stimulate aggregate demand, Keynes suggested demand-side interventions, such as low rate loans, low taxes, and excess borrowing, funded by the government. Hayek, whose saw his homeland of Austria ravaged due to inflation after the World War I, cautioned against such a Keynesian stimulus, which may reduce unemployment in the short term but would completely distort markets in the medium to long term. Following up on his ideas of deregulation, Hayek also engaged in debates with economists on the merits of socialism in the mid 1930s. When LSE was evacuated to Cambridge during the World War II, Hayek started working on his Abuse of Reason project in which he emphasised scientism - the misguided and prejudiced application of the methods of natural science to the problems of social science. Though this project never got completed, it became the basis for Hayek's most famous book, The Road to Serfdom. In 1940s, Hayek was instrumental in the creation of the Mont PÃ¨lerin Society - an organisation dedicated to the establishment and preservation of free societies. The founding meeting of the society in 1947 was attended by 39 prominent scholars, including Ludwig Von Mises, Lionel Robbins, Milton Friedman, Frank Knight, George Stigler, Aaron Director, and Karl Popper.\n\nIn 1950, Hayek left LSE for the University of Chicago, where he spent the next 12 years of his life. In Chicago, he wrote a number of articles on political philosophy, history of ideas, and social science methodology that weaved into his 1960 book, The Constitution of Liberty. In 1962, Hayek returned to Europe and joined the University of Freiburg in Germany. He remained there until his retirement in 1968, when he accepted an honorary professorship at the University of Salzburg in Austria. During this period, he started working on his book, Law, Legislation and Liberty, which got published in three separate volumes in 1973, 1976 and 1979, which is two years after he permanently moved to Freiburg. In 1976, the Institute of Economic Affairs in London published The Denationalization of Money in which Hayek advocated for the establishment of competitively issued private currency. His final book, The Fatal Conceit, presents forceful critique against socialism and got published four years before his death."
