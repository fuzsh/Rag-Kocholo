        "text": "Hayek’s intellectual contributions\n\nHayek’s writings span seven decades. He was professionally active through most of his adult life, and he contributed to a variety of disciplines, among them economics, political philosophy, psychology, the history of ideas, and the philosophy and methodology of the social sciences. Hayek was also controversial. A member of the Austrian school of economics, he was part of a tradition that was marginalized politically and generally dismissed by the economics community for about 50 years, starting in the 1930s. In that decade and the next, for example, Hayek was endorsing free market economics and classical liberal political doctrines when many intellectuals regarded socialist and welfare state policies as providing the “middle way” between totalitarianism (especially in its communist or fascist forms) and the perceived failures of unfettered capitalism (particularly in the aftermath of the Great Depression). As an early opponent of Keynes, Hayek lived through an era (especially in the 1950s and ’60s) when Keynesianism dominated the economics profession and the necessity of widespread government intervention in the economy was, by and large, universally accepted in the Western democracies. It was not until the stagflation (high levels of inflation and unemployment coupled with low growth) of the 1970s that Keynesian dominance was brought to an end, and in the late 1980s the collapse of communist states in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe triggered a reassessment of Hayek’s contributions. There is now a significant secondary literature on Hayek and the Austrian school—some of which is critical, some adulatory. All these considerations call for caution in approaching Hayek as a historical figure. A survey of his most important contributions must, because of the breadth of Hayek’s work, be selective. Four general areas in which he made contributions will be reviewed below.\n\nTrade cycle theory\n\nHayek’s earliest contribution was his development of a business cycle theory that built on the earlier work by Swedish economist Knut Wicksell and von Mises. Hayek’s theory posits the natural interest rate as an intertemporal price; that is, a price that coordinates the decisions of savers and investors through time. The cycle occurs when the market rate of interest (that is, the one prevailing in the market) diverges from this natural rate of interest. This causes the structure of the capital stock to become distorted, so that it no longer reflects the desires of savers and investors as expressed in the market. His theory had the unfortunate policy implication that attempts to counteract a recession, or period of high unemployment, with an increase in the money supply would further distort the structure of the capital stock. His remedy was simply to allow the recession to play itself out, thereby permitting the market rate to return to the natural rate.\n\nWhile Hayek’s trade cycle theory, articulated during the Great Depression, has relatively few defenders today, some aspects of it remain valuable. These include Hayek’s conception of the interest rate as an intertemporal price and his idea that changes in the money supply can be an important cause of discoordination, particularly as those changes affect the ability of prices to accurately reflect relative scarcities.\n\nEconomics and knowledge\n\nAmong economists Hayek’s analysis of the role of assumptions about knowledge in economic theories is highly regarded. Hayek began developing his ideas during the 1930s, when the static equilibrium theories of the day were full information models; in other words, they assumed that all agents have access to the same objectively correct information. Hayek believed that such models fail to illuminate the role of market prices in providing information to market participants.\n\nIn his 1936 presidential address to the London Economic Club, Economics and Knowledge, Hayek posited instead a world in which knowledge is dispersed among many different agents and in which the information that any one agent holds is not necessarily correct. He then asked how social coordination could ever occur in such a world. His answer was that freely formed and freely adjusting market prices contain information about the plans and intentions of millions of market participants. Because of this, changes in prices reflect changing relative scarcities for factors, goods, and services, and they thereby enable market agents to plan and to bring their subjectively formed perceptions and expectations about market conditions into line with actual conditions. In other words, the world is constantly changing and errors are constantly being made; but errors create profit opportunities for alert entrepreneurs, whose actions bring market prices back in line with underlying relative scarcities. Hayek argued that market prices thus allow agents—all of whom operate with limited information—to coordinate their activities. By contrast, the full information equilibrium models obscure the process by which real markets deal with the problem of dispersed information, because they are based on the assumption that such coordination has already occurred.\n\nHayek came to these insights as the result of debates with opponents over his monetary theory and over the viability of socialism. As noted above, he demonstrated how changes in the money supply can interfere with the interest rate’s ability to coordinate intertemporal decisions and how inflation can disrupt the efficacy of price signals. According to Hayek, socialist schemes that either do away with markets (as, for example, when the means of production is nationalized, thereby eliminating factor markets in capital goods) or do not allow prices to adjust, or allow them to adjust only slowly (as is the case in planned economies in which prices are fixed by a central authority), further interfere with the ability of prices to coordinate dispersed knowledge.\n\nHayek later added to his analysis, first by noting that knowledge, in addition to being localized, is often tacit (that is, implied but not clearly stated). By its nature, tacit knowledge cannot be articulated, but it affects people’s behaviour and is captured in market prices. Hayek also noted that price systems were far from being a singular influence and that other social institutions assisted in coordinating human action.\n\nThe economics of information is now an important area of economics, and many theorists (among them, Leonid Hurwicz, Sanford Grossman, and Joseph Stiglitz) credit Hayek with being among the first to emphasize the role of market prices in conveying information. Interestingly, certain of Hayek’s ideas about knowledge (especially its tacit dimension) do not fit in so easily with mainstream information economics, so his analyses may with equal justice be seen as posing challenges to as well as anticipating later developments."
