        "text": "0:33Intro. [Recording date: January 9, 2013.] Russ: Our subject for today is your book, Living Economics, but before we get into that I want to talk about James Buchanan, who just passed away this morning. And there's a chapter in the book on his contribution to economics. I'd like you to start by summarizing that. What was important about Jim Buchanan and his work? Guest: Well, about Professor Buchanan I'd like to say two things. First, one is on a personal level. He was my teacher and a role model in many ways. When I came here to George Mason U. to go to graduate school he had just moved from Virginia Polytechnic Institute to George Mason and he sort of created the Ph.D. program at George Mason, and instilled in all of us this idea of daring to be different, which was his model. And he said, we never wanted to be the MIT of the Potomac. But instead to have our own reasons for excellence. And he really did--me and my classmates benefited tremendously. I had him before he won the Nobel Prize, so he was around all the time and I had that great experience and whatnot. And of course when he won the Nobel Prize in 1986 it was a thrill for all of us because we had all made the choice to go in a kind of unconventional way by going to George Mason to begin with rather than traditional graduate programs, and then be able to say our professor had done that. And he created a niche for us in the professional which I think was extremely important. And then he was very supportive of young people all the way through. On an intellectual level, the reason why you get drawn to Jim Buchanan is an analytical set of arguments within economics, the most important of which is a demand of behavioral symmetry. The way that I study individuals in the marketplace is the same way that I'm going to study them in the voting booth or in any other walk of life. And traditional economics--textbook economics--had suffered from what Buchanan and Gordon Tullock would refer to as the Roman Emperor problem. A Roman Emperor is asked to judge a singing contest between two contestants, and upon hearing the first gives the award to the second under the assumption that clearly the second couldn't be any worse than the first. This was the old market-failure/government-correction kind of idea. Russ: Because we don't like the way the world is; obviously we should use government because we don't like the way the world is. Guest: So we see the market fail and we say government is a deus mach-- Russ: deus ex machina-- Guest: and can fix it. So, Buchanan, by forcing us to do this behavioral symmetry, said that: look, if people in the marketplace are doing these things because they're greedy, well, what's it like when we look at politicians when they are greedy. Rather than looking at people in the marketplace as greedy but people in politics as angels. So, you couldn't do that. Man was neither sinner nor saint. He's sort of both, this complex character. And you do that. Russ: Very Smithian. Guest: Yeah. And Buchanan is a modern Adam Smith. Like Friedrich Hayek--I think you could make a claim that he is the most Smithian of modern economists. But then there's a whole host of other things that he applies this idea to. When he won the Nobel Prize one of his lines was, they asked him to sum up his position, which is similar to the way they asked James Tobin. They asked James Tobin and he said: Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Russ: That was his contribution to the Nobel Prize management portfolio. Kind of an embarrassing line, because we all know that already. But he formalized it a bit. Guest: But Buchanan said: Don't let the fox guard the chicken coop. Which is about like who guards the guardians kind of thing. And in particular, in reference to the public debt. Because Buchanan really cut his professional teeth on the issue of the public debt and the burden of debt, and at the time that he was coming into professional prominence and economics was at the heyday of the Keynesian revolution--and it's not just on monetary discretion. The Keynesians were really the old fiscalists--that's why we call it monetarists--fiscal policy is effective; monetary policy is not effective. Friedman came along to point out that we needed them to worry about money, on the money side. So, Buchanan, rather than emphasizing the monetary policy side went after the micro foundations of fiscal policy. And he asked the question, in reference to the standard functional finance position, which is that you don't worry about balancing the budget, but worry about using the budget to balance the economy. And the belief was, from Abba Lerner and all those people that you would balance the budget over the life of the business cycle. So, you would run deficits in times of recession; you would run surpluses in times of plenty; and then you would balance the budget over the life of the business cycle. And Buchanan simply asked the question: What are the electoral incentives that politicians face that would ever make them want to do exactly that? Right? You can see why you want to run deficits during times of recession, but why would you ever want to run the surpluses in times of plenty? And so as a result you end up getting permanent deficit financing. Russ: He was onto something. Guest: Yeah, you think? And so to me, ever since 2008, people ask me: How do I understand what's going on? I say: Prerequisite reading are Hayek's Tiger by the Tail and Buchanan's Democracy in Deficit. And the connection between those two. And that's 628 what I personally still think is going to be the undoing or the unwinding of this current situation, is that we've done deficits, debt, and debasement. And we haven't gotten completely to the debasement part of the situation yet. Russ: But we're getting close. Guest: Yeah, we're getting close. Russ: Last week there began to be a discussion of a 'trillion dollar coin' that would be minted--for those of you listening who haven't heard about it, it's just a legalistic fiction to allow the government to print a lot of money. Get on the web if you want to read about it; it's not worth talking about. But it's a further step down the road to debasement. Although, as you point out, there hasn't been much, if any--very little inflation. And the anti-monetarists have used that fact, which is a fact--to prove that we are overly worried about inflation. Guest: Right, but I think that if you, just to put things in historical perspective, I believe it's accurate to say that Arthur Burns was the first one to try to do this Operation Twist, in the late 1960s, in which what you do is you try to suppress long-term interest rates at the same time while you are trying to stimulate the economy in the short run by pushing down short-term interest rates. And the Fed is doing both. And that's because you want to make sure you mute this signal that the short run monetary stimulus is going to cause inflation-- Russ: is going to have long run consequences. Guest: To link this back--I don't want to go into a thing about contemporary policy necessarily--but Adam Smith in the fifth book of the Wealth of Nations refers to the juggling trick that governments engage in ancient as well as modern. The juggling trick is that they run deficits that then accumulate into public debts; which then they debase their currencies. And his argument in there--you remember in the fifth book of the Wealth of Nations he's giving advice to the statesmen that you need to sort of do. And he's basically saying: look, we have to stop government from engaging these juggling tricks. Which is going to be rules that bind the government. And in large part that's what Buchanan ends up by working his career on--is on: What are the rules by which we can get the government to be bound but yet still effective at doing the things that they can do well?8:56Guest: So the last thing I would say about Buchanan is that I think the work that he did on social philosophy and political economy is extremely important, in the way that he analytically distinguishes between the productive state, the protective state, and the redistributive state. And the puzzle, the Constitutional puzzle that Buchanan-- Russ: Just quickly explain those terms. Guest: Okay. So 'protective state' is like police, law--the criminal justice system, judges. Russ: 'Productive state'--roads. Guest: Roads-- Russ: Bridges. Guest: And then the 'redistributive state'-- Russ: We know what that is: entitlements, Social Security, farm bills. Guest: Right. So Buchanan's puzzle, Constitutionally, is: can I empower the protective and productive state without unleashing the redistributive state? And it turns out, in the 20th century we haven't been very successful at doing that. And that becomes our puzzle. Now, how do I think through that Constitutional project? It's also the project that James Madison cared about, right? Madison said: If men were angels there'd be no need for government, and if government were run by angels there'd be no need for constraints. But it's precisely because men are going to rule over other men, we must empower--that would be the protective and the productive. But then constraint--which would be tighten up the redistributive. And so it turns out that Buchanan's effort, while we might say that it hasn't proven to be as effective as we would like--let's say trying to constrain the fiscal side of the state or the redistributive side of the state--the way he thought about it is the way that I think all of us should be thinking about it, to try to examine these kind of questions. Especially in light of this. And then if you think about it, our current situation, our debate in Washington, D.C., in my opinion is completely misdirected because it's all about the revenue side, and really it has to be on the spending side. Or you think about it this way: it's all about the scale of government--you know, what's the size of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in relationship, the size of government debt in relationship to GDP. When I think what we should be thinking about is questions about the scope of government. Russ: I totally agree. Guest: And, if you fix Keynes--this is probably the last time I'll say something good about John Maynard Keynes here today--but Keynes had a great quip, which was he said: You cannot make a fat man skinny by tightening his belt. You have to make a fat man skinny, and then his belt is looser. Right? And then he can wear a smaller belt. Those are questions of scope, not of scale. Russ: Those are two fabulous metaphors--that one and then--metaphor is not the right word but that framework we're thinking about the state as productive, protective, and redistributive. That's a good way to organize your thinking. Guest: The last thing about Buchanan, he's a classic example of how right-thinking in economics, they tend to have long and productive lives--Buchanan was still writing papers. I saw him give a paper this summer, in August, which many of my colleagues were at as well. And he said: I don't really like the way it looks right now; I have to keep working on it. He's 93 years old and he's still fresh in his mind and still working on that stuff. And it was just amazing to hear him talk. The metaphor that he used--I think that's the right word here, or analogy he used to explain the budget deficit was he said: Imagine that you belong to a lunch club and you go out to eat for lunch; and then what goes on is that you agree to equally split the bill. And how is everyone going to decide how they are going to do things. All of a sudden that cannoli that you might have thought a little bit about, now all of a sudden you spread it between 12 people--hey, it only cost me 50 cents. Russ: I've never heard that coming from Buchanan, but I wrote a piece with the same logic. We'll put a link up to it. Also the right way to think about our problems. Guest: His whole thing, and here's what he was thinking about; this is what I'm saying: He's 92 years old and he's thinking, how can I get back to a Constitutional rule which will not decouple the spending decision from the taxing decision? So, instead, the taxing and spending decisions are closer coupled with one another, like user fees. How can I do that? Buchanan is thinking through that at 93, and the rest of us are in the room; we're like: Wow, that's a novel idea, wouldn't that make sense? And the thing of a genius is someone who, when they say something, it seems so obvious after they say it. Before they say it, you never thought about it. Russ: It's ironic because I was doing the dishes this morning and actually thinking about that metaphor, and being depressed about it. And how, when you go out with your friends and you split the check because it's convenient, you don't order the fancy champagne for yourself or the expensive steak because you don't want to impose the cost on your friends, if they are all getting hamburger with coke. When it's 330 million people in the room and most of them are just strangers, you need some cultural restraints on overeating. But if you think everybody else is overeating and taking advantage of you, because they are going to be able to pull money out of your pocketbook, you think: Well, I'm a sucker if I restrain myself. So you need something to restrain that redistributive force. It used to be culture. It used to be the Constitution. I think we've lost both of those. I was thinking about it because I was reading about the fiscal cliff \"resolution.\" The idea that there would be pork and earmarks in that bill is just--on one dimension, it's repulsive, and on the other, it's just business as usual. And the fact that the people who put that in there weren't ashamed of it at a time when we are running trillion dollar deficits tells you everything you need to know about the current state of American political economy.15:08Russ: But let's go back to your book. One of the themes that runs through the book--you open with this--is you make a distinction between mainline and mainstream. And that distinction you take from Kenneth Boulding. Talk about that distinction, what it means, and why it's important. Guest: Well, one of the things that has always struck me in my career, again going back to Buchanan and Boulding and us, part of what Buchanan taught us is to dare to be different. We were doing good economics. There's an old quip by Milton Friedman: There's no Austrian economics, there's no Chicago economics--all there is is good economics and bad economics. And you can agree with Friedman on that--we want to just be good economists. We just happen to think that a lot of the themes that are in Austrian economics constitute what it means to do good economics. Or public choice or whatnot. But the reality is that I've always found it strange when people say: Oh, your view isn't mainstream. Well, it's the view that Adam Smith had, or Jean-Baptiste Say. Russ: And Hayek, and Buchanan, and Ronald Coase. Guest: All these other Nobel Prize winners. Russ: It's not a bunch of kooks. Guest: And so I hear people say this all the time, this language that Boulding used all the time to talk about Adam Smith. He has an essay called \"After Samuelson, Who Needs Smith?\" And his argument is: We all do, because Adam Smith is part of our extended present in the conversation. Meaning that there are still fruitful things to learn from Adam Smith for the way that we do economics today. And I think if you look at someone, as you mentioned, Hayek, Buchanan, Coase--these people all viewed themselves as being in the seat of Adam Smith. The men who sit in the seat of Adam Smith. So then what I try to do in the book is: So, who are the men, or women, who sit in the seat of Adam Smith? And their ideas. What is it that substantively captures that idea? And I think it's this idea of the self-interest postulate--which does not mean selfishness, and it doesn't mean lightning calculators of pleasure and pain. It simply means that individuals pursue what they want to pursue as best as they can given their situation. Russ: And are a little bit more focused on themselves than on other people. Which is undeniably true. You can still be an altruist; you can still give to charity; you can still be nice to your wife; you can spend time with your family. But you care mostly about yourself and the people near you than you do about other people. Guest: And so that's one postulate. And then the other one is the invisible hand, the self-regulating aspects of the market. And mainline economics is: How is it that I square this--one proposition, self-interest proposition--with the invisible hand? Russ: That things sort of work out pretty well most of the time. Guest: And the way that we do it, what we find, is that all of those economics that I mentioned do it by way of institutional analysis. It's the private property, market economy. And the key thing is there--it's the private property, market economy. They don't say: Adam Smith never said individuals pursuing their self-interest under any conceivable set of circumstances will generate a publicly desirable outcome. Russ: And as you said in the book, he had lots of examples where things came out badly. Just mention a couple of those--teaching, religious activity. Guest: Yeah. It's funny the way he does it, especially in the context of this book, which talks about teaching, is that Smith contrasts the teachers in Scotland, who were actually paid by student fees directly, versus in Oxford, where they were paid based on the endowment and they were tenured. And he talks about how the professors that were tenured at Oxford would get up in front of the class and literally read the book. Whereas the professors in Glasgow and Edinburgh would actually respond to the students, try to make sure they were teaching them the right things, and like that. And with regard to religious education, he uses the issue of whether or not you have a state-sponsored church or a voluntary contribution church. And his argument is that religiosity rises much more when you have voluntary contributions to the church. Russ: Because they respond to the consumer. Guest: Yeah. And his friend, David Hume, who was non-religious, had the same analysis but he sponsored state churches-- Russ: Because he wanted to make them less effective. Guest: Whereas Smith thought religion of value and so he wanted a free market in religion. So it's a kind of very fascinating-- Russ: I'm just going to add one more, which you mention in the book. He believed that people in business would often pursue their own self-interest in the harm of others, that they were allowed to conspire or had a natural tendency to do that. He also saw lots of negative things about politicians without restraint. I'm interrupting because I think it's such an important point that people who share our ideologies and philosophies, and our opponents, get wrong. Which is: I don't believe--and I don't think you believe--that anything that's spontaneous must be good. Spontaneous is a fact--that there are emergent forces that shape outcomes in the world around us. That's a fact. That's not something you believe in or don't believe in. But what you can believe in or don't believe in is: Which are the right institutional forces that make spontaneous outcomes look good or not good? And how might they be improved, and what makes them different? But this idea somehow that Adam Smith, because he was in favor of \"laissez faire,\" means that he thought all government was bad or that all spontaneous, invisible-hand-like stuff was good, is not true. Guest: Yeah. So, mainline economics--so you have the self-interest, the invisible hand reconciled through institutional analysis. So that's a substantive set of propositions. If you go to an economist that is a mainline economist in France in the 19th century--let's say, J. B. Say, and you ask him, you translate, and you say: Okay, so what is it about it means to think like an economist? And he would say: Oh, well, you have self-interest, you have the self-regulating aspects of the market that are achieved within a private property, market economy. So that's in the French language. If you go to German language and speak to the early Austrian economists--Carl Menger and Eugen BÃ¶hm-Bawerk and Friedrich Wieser, and whatnot--they'd say self-interest, invisible hand reconciled through private property, market economy. So much so that Ludwig von Mises highlights the market economy as an essential characteristic for being able to engage in economic calculation; that the absence of that institution eliminates the ability to do that. Which is how the system operates. And so it's this emphasis. Now think about how, by the time we get to 1950, 1960s, you have people like Francis Bator, who were famous economists at the time, you know, Samuelsonian economists, say things like: Our goal as economists is to have an institutionally antiseptic theory. So, in a large part, mainline economics stretching all the way back to Adam Smith and coming forward is a tradition of economics which emphasizes these various rules of the game. Russ: Which could be legal; they could be cultural. Guest: And political. And that the economy is always structured, so political economy as such. As opposed to 'economics,' which is this purely technical science disembodied from institutions. And so a large part of the post 1950s resurgence of economic thinking-- Russ: I think you mean post 1948. Guest: Okay, yeah. Russ: Because that's when Samuelson published the Foundations of Economic Analysis, which was the beginning--not the beginning but a local high point of mathematical sophistication about human behavior. Guest: Well, it became the bible of how to learn, what it meant to be a serious economist. Russ: Right. Guest: Was to speak in the language that Samuelson spoke in and the way that he spoke. And it still exists in our profession to this day. Russ: Well, not just still exists. That is the mainstream, as it contrasts to the mainline.23:46Guest: Right. And so now let me go back to the main stream, which is: Note that you can't really put a finger on what the substantive propositions are, because in the mainstream you can have Joe Stiglitz, who no one would deny is a mainstream economist. Russ: He's a Nobel Prize winner. Guest: A Nobel Prize winner, Columbia, Princeton, Stanford; he's taught all the main places. Paul Krugman--right? Has been at all the top places, in the top journals, things like that. But you also have, on the other side, Bob Lucas. Russ: Right. Guest: And Bob Lucas and Joe Stiglitz couldn't disagree more about substantive economics. Yet the agree completely about the style-- Russ: The tool kit. Guest: The tool kit of economics. And so what happens is mainstream becomes a sociological moniker for people that believe, methodologically, what they believe at the top 5 schools. And they use and they speak in that language. Whereas in the past, if you were a Smithian economist, you could speak in English, French, German; you could speak with math, you could speak with just pure natural language, and what mattered was whether or not you believed the substantive propositions of economics. In modern economics, mainstream became: Are you using these tools? And it didn't really matter as much what the substantive propositions are, per se. Russ: I think that's a little strong. Let me challenge you on that for the mainstream. The mainstream folks do have their substantive propositions. They require rationality. They require some dimension of equilibrium--although there's some, you know, fudging or hedging about--you can be out of equilibrium, but equilibrium analysis, because it's mathematics, needs some equalities there--is a huge part of it. There's some attempt to formally model expectations; they can't ignore them. I think they share a lot more than just the language of mathematics. Guest: I think that what happened is that one of the things that mainstream--neoclassical tools are much more absorptive than anyone might have thought. So if you come along and a critic comes along and says: If you don't deal with expectations you are not going to be able to model this, the model is able to absorb the expectations in. But what it does is it absorbs it in a way that isn't necessarily an enhancement to the original idea. So let me give you an example on this reconciliation of the rationality postulate and the invisible hand. What I argue in the book is that a lot of what happens in modern economics is that the people who are quote-unquote \"free market,\" they collapse one onto the other. Russ: Why are you putting that in quotes? Guest: Because they don't really explain the rules under which a free market operates. Russ: Right. There's hand-waving. Guest: They explain the technical apparatus by which I can prove an efficiency proof. And so then what happens, so rationality, what are the conditions for rationality hypothesis. And those feed directly right into the invisible hand conditions. And so then we get looking at a world where agents have to have full and complete information; they have to have complete omniscience. So rational expectations becomes perfect foresight, rather than the idea of people having divergent expectations. Or we get these puzzles in economics--which are very brilliant puzzles, don't get me wrong here. These are amazing intellectual puzzles that people have worked on. And Samuelson--since I've been going around talking about the book, people ask me about: Why is it that Samuelson had such a big impact? Well, when you are the brightest guy and you are young and you are able to do all this stuff, and everyone--it's quite clear that Samuelson was really, really brilliant. And people coalesced around him, because you know, like they do. But I think he sent economics in a direction which took it farther away from its Smithian roots than brought it closer to it. And that part of the post-Samuelson kind of period of what things that we at, say, George Mason care about in economics, sort of the law and economics revolution, the public choice revolution, the sort of property rights theory of the firm revolution, new institutionalism in general, entrepreneurship and market process theory--all of those things are things that classical economists more or less hinted at, and sometimes explicitly talked about. Like we were mentioning about with Adam Smith. Russ: Sure. Public choice, skepticism about the motivations of politicians. Guest: Yeah. I mean, Adam Smith talking about religious leaders--you could also say that about politicians under democratic election. All these kind of things. We had to recapture a lot of the basic propositions in economics, because we squeezed them out with our formalism, is the claim in the book. And that relates, to go back--so the book is divided into three parts. The first part is basically about, so I have three meanings. The cover of the book has a growing tree on it. And it's a healthy tree. And the name, Living Economics is to indicate three different things. The first image that you should have in your mind is that economics is a living body of thought. It's constantly evolving, constantly improving. We should be excited about it. It's an invitation. I want my book to be viewed not as a catechism but as an invitation to inquiry to young people who are embarking upon economics as a career. That's who the book is targeted at. And so that's the first thing. Russ: If I can adjust your marketing pitch--it's targeted to those people, but anybody interested in the history of economic thought and the ideas of modern economics will be interested in this book. It's not just written for graduate students of economics. Guest: Sure. But that's who I had in my head as the primary. The second meaning of that, if you look at the tree, it's a healthy tree because it has deep roots. Right? And so what we have to do is to see these roots and see where we came from. And that's the reaching back to Adam Smith and these great teachers of economics as I sort of lay them out. And then the third one is basically that if you understand economics in the way that these people have taught economics, then you can't stop thinking about economics. It becomes an obsession for you, 24-7. As David Friedman was visiting with us last year, one of the things that David said, which I completely agree with him, he said: The difference between economists like us and other economists is that we are not 9-to-5 economists. We are 24-7 economists; we think about it all the time. Russ: Well, it's not just that. We don't turn off the economic way of thinking when we go home. It's not like we are working on our research at night when we are with, say, our children. But we think about incentives and we think about unintended consequences and we think about spontaneous order.31:25Russ: But I want to make sure we don't lose one stream of thought of what you were just talking about. It was interesting what you said about your book, the cover, I love that. But you were about to say something else and I don't want to lose that, which is: When you think about mainstream economics, the current or formal side of economics, they do have propositions, as you said, that link self-interest and rationality to invisible hand and self-regulatory processes that emerge and are not controlled or designed by anyone. But then because it's formalized, they often say: Well, these formal conditions don't always hold, and therefore leaving things alone is fraught with market failure, all kinds of other problems that require government intervention. And I think, for me, that is the--you can make a lot of criticisms of the formal approach. I think one of the subtlest and most important of that formal approach is its tendency to confuse you and to deceive you into thinking you have isolated, because it looks scientific, all the relevant factors. And therefore what you discover is fact. The truth. And I think those of us in the mainline tradition, Smith, Hayek tradition, they never said--Smith never said, Hayek never said, you and I never say--Oh, people are perfect. And that's why we believe that markets are good. We believe in fact almost the opposite: Because people are imperfect--they do the best they can, they learn--but because they make mistakes, because markets are constantly changing, and outcomes are constantly changing, that's the reason to favor, often, a more laissez faire approach. And the mathematical apparatus I think masks that in a very unhealthy way. And for all the graduate students listening out there: It's always a good idea to keep in mind that your model is to help you understand the world. It's not the same as how to get a rocket to Mars. Getting a rocket to Mars is a very formal, mathematical process. If you get the numbers right the rocket ends up at Mars; if you get them wrong, it doesn't. Economics for a whole bunch of reasons doesn't work that way. Guest: Yeah. If I can follow up on that--in the book, I sort of make the argument that the formal apparatus highlights behavioral assumptions, right? And that the focus is on those behavioral assumptions being at such a thick condition that they make the invisible hand possible. As opposed to having very thin behavioral conditions, meaning that man is fallible but capable. Russ: Yeah. Guest: That man is caught between alluring hopes and haunting fears rather than this idea of being this calculator, lightning calculator-- Russ: machine. Guest: Yeah, robots. And that what reconciles our ability to do this is the institutional conditions, not the behavioral ideas. And so that the heavy intellectual lifting in economics is done by institutional analysis, not the behavioral things. Just to follow up--Hayek in the essay \"Individualism, True and False,\" has a great summary of what Smith is talking about. And he says that there's no doubt Smith and his contemporaries were trying to find a system where bad men could do least harm, rather than finding a system where perfect men could rule, you know, justly. Russ: A utopia. Guest: Yeah. Russ: Heaven on earth. Guest: So it's all about finding--he summarizes the classical distinction as: We're trying to deal with men as they are, sometimes stupid, right? Sometimes smart, you know. Sometimes evil. We're dealing with the men as they are, and then we are trying to find that institutional environment which will marshal their base motivations in a direction which will generate the best outcome for the group as a whole. And he says the great discovery of the 17th century philosophers, 17th and 18th century philosophers, was that it was the private property, market economy.36:06Russ: So, let me challenge your distinction between mainline and mainstream. Basically, you have a couple of essays in the book that look at that evolution from a more, you might call it descriptive, narrative, non-mathematical, imperfect way of studying human behavior, which is the mainline, Smith, Hayek way--versus the more formal structure that has become the dominant force in modern graduate training and modern scholarship. Two things strike me about that. One is, while it's true that mainstream has \"won\" and it dominates the modern economic way of modeling behavior and outcomes as dominating our profession, our guys win a lot of Nobel Prizes. That's number one. And number two, if our approach is the right approach, which I think it is, why don't we do better? Why is our side--why is it that when you go to the top 5 places, graduate programs in America or you look at the top 20 most influential economists in various ways you can measure that, why is that most of them are mainstream and not mainline? Guest: It's a fascinating question. I do think that I am more optimistic even in the sense that we have a lot of young superstars that are emerging in the economics profession. They are not that young any more, but they were young when they started and made this move in a direction towards a more institutional analysis. So you think about Andrei Shleifer in the legal origins work that he did and bringing institutions to the forefront. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson. I mean, there's differences between these various different people and I don't want to suggest it as a homogenous group. Russ: And they may not want to be in the mainline. They might sort of consider themselves mainstream. Guest: Yeah. But what's fascinating to me is if you look at, sort of, what's one of the most popular books in economics for 2012, well it would be Why Nations Fail. Russ: By Acemoglu-- Guest: and James Robinson-- Russ: Which we did a podcast on. Guest: And so you have Robinson and Acemoglu running around explaining that there's this thing called 'inclusive institutions'; there's 'exclusive institutions,' there's predation, there's all these concepts which are concepts that Mancur Olson talked about, which Jim Buchanan talked about. Russ: And Adam Smith. It's very much in the Smithian tradition. Guest: Right. And so you can draw so much--and that's not true just for them. I mean, Tim Besley just wrote a book a few years ago called Pillars of Prosperty which also goes into what are the institutional conditions. And he was a former editor of the American Economics Review; he's a professor at the London School of Economics. So we have a lot of people that are around that are in the professional elite that are now focusing attention again on institutions. A lot of this derive from--again, Bob Lucas is a genius. When he wrote his paper, after the Rational Expectations revolution, called the \"Mechanics of Economic Development\" he set off a lot of people thinking about why are some nations rich and some nations poor? Russ: An old question. Guest: Yeah. An Adam Smith question. Related to the nature and causes of the wealth of nations. So that's why I--I'm speaking too much at some level here. But Smith's title of his book was called An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Acemoglu and Robinson's book, so many centuries later, is called Why Nations Fail--which is really a modern inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations. We are dealing with Smith's questions. This is Boulding's point about the extended present. And so I think the economics profession is widely open to a lot of the ideas here. What I find problematic in this sense is that, so for example, public choice. If I went and I talked to any of the mainstream people-- Russ: Public choice being the application of the economic way of thinking to the political process. Guest: They would understand rent-seeking. Joe Stiglitz, when he did his interview with you for the podcast, he knew his audience, right? And he focused on rent-seeking. Russ: Yeah. There's some rent-seeking in there. I'll leave it at that. Go ahead. Guest: Yeah. So he has the rent-seeking story. As does Krugman when he decides to write \"Is Free Trade Passe?\" He recognizes there's an interest group problem associated with giving protectionist legislation for firms, and whatnot. Russ: Rent-seeking being that use of the political process by special interest groups to extract money from the rest of us. Guest: But it's not in their DNA. It's like a footnote. Whereas if you go back to my point I was mentioning about Buchanan in the beginning, behavioral symmetry is not an afterthought. It's not: Oh, I work out the model when I have behavioral asymmetry and then I say-- Russ: there's a possibility that-- Guest: Yeah. Instead it's from the get-go. Russ: It's a foundational principle. Guest: It's a foundational principle. And so I think we still have work to do, but it's so much easier because of the great work that was done by the people that I mention in the book--the Jim Buchanans, the Ronald Coases, the Armen Alchians, the Harold Demsetzes, the Israel Kirtzners; of course the F. A. Hayeks and whatnot. These people were so groundbreaking in pushing forward the ball that the conversation--and that's why I think-- Russ: Lin Ostrom. Mises. Guest: Yeah. I think the reason why we can have this conversation today is because of people like Buchanan, who cleared the way in a professionally responsible way to talk about older ideas in a new context that made them seem fresh again.41:53Russ: Yeah. 1955 would have been tough. 1942 would have been tough. And I think it's--well, I'm like you. I'm optimistic. I always like to think it's up for grabs. Guest: Yeah. And the financial crisis is a horrible thing for families that are suffering and everything like that. The economics profession has seemed to not really change much. Russ: Yeah, that's one of my later questions: why is it? Guest: Still, it's an opportunity for us to sort of talk about these ideas. Me, the only part of the economics issue about the mainline versus the mainstream is that mainline economics is totally non-Keynesian. And the top essay of the book was my Adam Smith lecture from 2010. Keynes is the main target of my criticism in there. But it's really not Keynes. It's aggregate thinking in general. And I want to get us back to an economics which is focused--even though I am talking about why some nations are rich and other nations are poor, which might seem like I'm talking about aggregation--but our explanation is a microeconomic explanation. And so it's about relative prices; it's about incentives that individuals face, the profit-loss calculus that they engage in in their decisions. And so it always traces back. So the way to think about the main theme in the book is that while there may be macroeconomic questions, there are only microeconomic explanations and solutions to these issues. And so we want to understand underlying microeconomics of why nations are rich and nations are poor. And that's why Acemoglu and Robinson are again important. Because when they start talking about the incentive effects that are generated by extractive institutions in politics, well that affects my decision to how much I invest, how much I work, and things like that. On the recession, one of the things we have coming in at George Mason in the beginning of this semester, we have Casey Mulligan coming in to talk about the Redistribution Recession, because again, that is a microfoundations of what the problems are that we are dealing with here. And I think that's a capturing, and the fact that Casey Mulligan is out there making that kind of argument in this day and age when the dominant approach has been an aggregate demand deficiency argument--we need Casey Mulligan. Russ: It puts him in the mainline. And see his podcast of a month or so ago if you want to learn more about that. He's very much saying: We forgot about this; here's a different approach. It's orthogonal to the sort of standard mainstream arguments you hear.44:30Russ: I want to go to a particular point in the book that I found fascinating. I don't totally agree with you but your book forced me to think about it in a way I hadn't thought about it before. You have a fascinating quote from George Stigler. And George Stigler was a teacher of mine, had a big impact on me. If I had to summarize George Stigler's view of political economy, it would be: Don't look at what they say, look at what they do. And if you want to know what somebody's intention is, look at what they do. Not what they say. And you quote him in there saying something a little more complicated than that, but that's the basic idea. When we think about political outcomes, don't think of them as how people describe them in lofty terms. Look at who wins and who loses. There are mistakes, obviously, in politics. But Stigler's view, which you quote in there, is that we get the outcomes that we want. Which I'd say is a rough--sorry, that's not fair. Don't treat the outcomes as random. Don't treat them as how they are described. Look at who wins and who loses and if, whoever wins, if that was the goal--to help those people. The problem I have with that--it's interesting--is that I think that's true at the individual level. I think when you want to figure out what somebody cares about--if somebody says: I care deeply about my children, my family. The football coach who quits his job or is fired or he resigns because he says: I want to spend more time with my family. And then 6 months later he's got a new job--as a football coach. And there are very few jobs that allow you to spend less time with your family than football coach at the major college or professional level. And so I would look at that, I always think, well, maybe after he spent more time with his family, he realized he didn't want to spend more time with his family. But maybe from the beginning it was just something he said, and you choose football coach as a career, you are not going to be very family oriented. It's too hard to do. So at the individual level I think that's a powerful thing. Your friend tells you that he cares about you but he doesn't return your calls, he doesn't care about you. So: Don't look at what people say; look at what they do. That's a huge part of, I think, the economic way of thinking. But at the political level, I think one of the biggest fallacies that we have considering government policy is to assume it's designed by somebody. When, in fact, I think it's often emergent. And so I find it interesting that we have this tradition in economics, skeptical, hard-nosed tradition that you don't look at what politicians say, you look at what they do. But what they do, the 'they' there is a big soup of competition. The institutional constraints are very different than the institutional constraints that exist among, say, car companies. But there's competition there. So, I was struck by how, even though I think that Stigler philosophy or whatever you want to call it, methodology, is useful, I think it misses a key part of what we have learned as mainline economists. Guest: Yeah, I agree with you on that. Though I think that I get Stigler doing is we infer intentions from outcomes. Russ: And my response is: I don't know what that means. Because I don't know what intentions are. When people say the government wants to do x, that's a dangerous shorthand. That's a different form of aggregated thinking that misleads. Guest: Well, I think the way Stigler was using it was that, let's just use minimum wage laws--or rent controls. Let's just use rent controls, because one of his classic essays, you know, with Milton Friedman was on \"Roofs or Ceilings\", 1946, that everyone should read. At an ideological level it's a fantastic analysis of the effect of government controls on the housing market. On a methodological level it's outstanding because it's a perfect example of an event study before we had techniques of doing event studies. Friedman and Stigler just do this fantastic thing: Compare San Francisco in 1906 and 1946, where you have a demand shock on the one hand and a supply shock on the other hand, and vice versa. Russ: Earthquake. Guest: Earthquake, supply shock. People coming home from WWII, demand shock. In the case of the earthquake, there's no rent controls. There's no evidence of shortage of housing. People lend out rooms; they do all kinds of things like that. Whereas in 1946 there are price controls on housing; there are shortages, all kinds of things. That's why it's called \"Roofs or Ceilings.\" Outstanding essay. What's interesting about it from this point of view is that Stigler is asking--Okay, Let's infer intentions from outcomes. So, I might say, as a politician: Oh, I want to pass a rent control because I want to have the least advantaged in society taken care of. And what the rent control does is it disproportionately hurts the least advantaged. And it benefits this other interest group. And what Stigler says is it benefited that other interest group because that group wanted that policy to benefit them. That's what he's trying to do. Russ: They lobbied for it. Guest: Yeah. They lobbied for it; they did all that stuff. And then his method flips back on us by saying that if we could have found a lower-cost way to bid them away from getting what they wanted, that would have been a more efficient thing. So we kind of get the government that we want. We infer intentions from outcomes, but the outcomes are in fact we get the kind of government that we want. Russ: Again, I need to interrupt, because the 'we' there is problematic. Guest: Sure. But the alternative, people did not form together--if I say to you the reason why that happened is because we face a collective action problem getting together; he says, oh, you've got to include those costs involved in your calculations. And it's not stupid to not pick up a $20 bill lying on the sidewalk if it costs you $21 to bend down and pick it up. And so this is where like Stigler pushes the argument in the end. And I think my colleague, Bryan Caplan, has addressed a lot of these issues. I'm an older-school public choice person than this. I think that we don't get the government that we want. Because we have voter preferences, and they get fed into a machination[?] of politics. And the machinations of politics--I'm much more like Friedman rather than Stigler in this regard--distort what it is that the voters prefer; and we get policy outcomes which are wildly at odds. And so this is sort of--like in a more modern guise of Friedman's position, this is like Arthur Brooks in The Battle, where he says that 70% of the American populace would like to have a vibrant free-market economy; 30% would like to have a massive redistribution, more heavy government. But we end up by getting the more heavy government rather than the 70% that want the other one. And I kind of think--you know, there's incoherence in the answers that people give, and it's hard to infer all that stuff. But I think Arthur Brooks says this kind of laid-out kind of thing, that we don't get exactly what it is that we want. Russ: Yeah but I just think that's the wrong way to look at it. I don't even know--as I tried to say before, I don't know what that phrase means: 'what we want.' Seventy percent of us--I don't agree with him, by the way. But let's take it as given. Let's say 70% of the people do want a vibrant free market and 30% want a highly restrained, a highly redistributive state imposing its will on the so-called market or on private choice. I have no reason to think--it's not a majority rule. It's not a referendum. I don't expect--what I think--I just think that's the wrong way to think about it."
