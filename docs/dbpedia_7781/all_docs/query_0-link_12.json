        "text": "Friedrich von Hayek, a Nobel Prize-winning economist who was an intellectual forebear of libertarians and other advocates of free-market economics from Ronald Reagan to Margaret Thatcher to Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus of post-Communist Czechoslovakia, died yesterday. He was 92 years old.\n\nMr. Hayek's secretary, Charlotte E. Cubitt, confirmed his death in Freiburg, Germany, according to Edward Crane, president of the Cato Institute, a conservative American research and policy institute.\n\nMr. Hayek, a British citizen of Austrian birth who taught at the University of Chicago during the 1950's, had lived in Freiburg for nearly three decades and been ill for several years. The immediate cause of his death was not announced.\n\nMr. Hayek won the Nobel Prize in 1974 for his work in the 1920's and 1930's on money, prices and the causes of the business cycle. But his most famous work was a 1944 book, \"The Road to Serfdom,\" which predicted that collectivism would fail and warned Western Europe and the United States of the dangers of socialism and big government. 'A Rallying Cry'\n\n\"It provided a rallying cry for free-market intellectuals during what was for them the dark days of the 1940's,\" said Mr. Crane, president of the Cato Institute, said. \"He proved to be very prescient.\"\n\nStephen Kresge, who is editing Mr. Hayek's collected works -- 18 books, 15 pamphlets and 142 articles -- added, \"It was one of those ironies that he was widely read in Eastern Europe at a time when he wasn't being read in the West.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
