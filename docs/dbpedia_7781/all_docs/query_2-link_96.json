        "text": "Recent work such as Steven Levitt's Freakonomics has prompted economic methodologists to reevaluate the state of relations between economics and its neighboring disciplines. Although this emerging literature on ‘economics imperialism’ has its merits, the positions advanced within it have been remarkably divergent: some have argued that economics imperialism is a fiction; others that it is a fact attributable to the triumph of neoclassical economics; and yet others that the era of economics imperialism is over. We believe the confusion results in part from a lack of historical understanding about the nature and aims of economics imperialists. We seek to improve historical understanding by focusing on the activities of a cadre of economists at the epicenter of economics imperialism, the University of Chicago. These activities – led, in the first instance, by Aaron Director and, in the second, by George Stigler – stemmed from the effort to forge a new liberalism or a ‘neoliberalism.’ We then consider Steven Levitt's Freakonomics in light of the insights gained from our historical study. Our analysis leads us to question each of the three positions on economics imperialism held by economic methodologists.\n\nThe Chicago School of Economics emerged as one of the primary intellectual formations in the US economics orthodoxy in the post-World War II Era. Not only is it America’s most influential school of economic thought, but it has also exerted demonstrable influence across the disciplines. Many non-economists (as well a fair share of economists) mistakenly equate Chicago with neoclassical economics, and they hold certain images about Chicago, which are oversimplified, shortsighted, and ahistorical. The first misperception concerns “economics imperialism”: Chicago economists have purposively and successfully claimed portions of the terrain of other disciplines by applying their understanding of economics in those disciplines. Chicago is not, however, coextensive with orthodoxy. Chicago neoliberals are not merely exponents of the logic of economics; they expound neoliberal ideas via economic language. A second misperception is that Milton Friedman is the quintessential icon of Chicago economics, and played the most fundamental role in its ascendancy. This overlooks that Friedman by no means represents the whole of Chicago. Moreover, there were numerous factors beyond the individual scholarly achievements of Chicago’s icons that contributed to its ascendancy. The lesser-explored methods of Chicago’s ascendance, developed by Chicago’s other icons and put into practice through assiduous efforts, compose the substance of this chapter.\n\nIn recent years, science studies scholars have critically examined several methods used by the pharmaceutical industry to exert control over knowledge about drugs. Complementary literatures on \"medical neoliberalism\" and \"neoliberal science\" draw attention to the economic ideas justifying such methods of organizing knowledge, and in so doing suggest that neoliberal thinkers may play an important role in developing them. As yet, the nature of this role remains unexplored. Relying on heretofore-unexamined archival evidence, this article establishes a direct link between the Chicago School of Economics and the mobilization of the pharmaceutical industry in the 1970s. It argues that economists affiliated with the Chicago School of Economics sought to influence pharmaceutical policy and science and constructed institutions to do so. These institutions--most notably the Center for the Study of Drug Development--remain highly influential. This article contributes to a historical understanding of how neoliberal ideas came to assume prominence in pharmaceutical policy, the management of science, and scientific practice.\n\nAlthough economists since John Stuart Mill have discussed the relationship of intellectual life to markets, it is only relatively recently—after the emergence of neoliberalism—that economists came to view knowledge as within their purview. This chapter examines how the “marketplace of ideas” as a concept fared at the hands of neoliberal economists. It focuses most intently on the work of the Chicago School economist George Stigler, who most doggedly pursued the implications of this concept for the neoliberal project. In doing so, this chapter addresses how and why the organization of science came to be a central topic of concern for neoliberal scholars, how neoliberal ideas pertaining to science have been put into practice inside and outside the academy, and what the consequences of these practices have been.\n\nIn March 2016, a group of thirty scholars from around the world convened at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center to discuss “more roads” to and from Mont Pèlerin. The conference was the third international conference on the topic of neoliberalism focusing on organized neoliberal networks. The previous conference at NYU led to the publication of The Road from Mont Pèlerin: The Making of the Neoliberal Thought Collective, which has sparked an ongoing international debate and a wide range of research on the intellectual and social history of neoliberalism."
