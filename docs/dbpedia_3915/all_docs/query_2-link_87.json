Last they worked together was for the iconic masterpiece film Kaalapani, in the year 1996\n\nText Credits: Shibul Pavithran\n\nAfter long gap of 22 years, Priyadarshan the director has decided to bring back the two talented actors for a film. It has been confirmed that Prabhu has been confirmed for the director’s dream project Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham. The Tamil actor will reportedly play a significant role in the film. Further, it has been confirmed that Madhu will also feature in the film.\n\nAfter acting together in critically acclaimed Kalaapani, a historical narrative that showed the damned horror that was prevalent in the cellular jail in Andaman Nicobar islands, Mohanlal and Tamil superstar Prabhu are all set to act together in Priyadarshan’s upcoming big-budget project Marakkar. It is after 22 long years that these two powerhouses from south film industry will be working together in a movie after the release of Kaalapani in 1996 which was also directed by Priyadarshan.\n\nPriyadarshan also announced on his his official page that Mohanlal’s son Pranav Mohanlal will also be the part of the film and has a special role in the film.\n\nMarakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham is expected to be a high budget historical film.

In January 2024, the 2023 Emmys—postponed due to the strikes—finally took place, even though it was 2024 by then, and some of the shows being honored were from 2022. Now, the actual 2024 Emmys are on their way, set to celebrate the best in television from June 2023 through May 2024. This means the highly praised second season of *The Bear* will get its moment before the less-enthusiastically received third season comes up for awards next year. It’s all a bit confusing, we know. But it’s good to see the TV awards show back on track and not jammed into the middle of awards season again—that was just too much. Below, you’ll find everything you need to know about the second 2024 Emmys.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the 2024 Emmys:\n\nThe father-son duo, Eugene and Dan Levy, who famously starred together in *Schitt’s Creek*, will be hosting the ceremony. “For two Canadians who won our Emmys in a literal quarantine tent, the idea of being asked to host this year in an actual theater was incentive enough,” they shared in a statement. “We’re thrilled to be able to raise a glass to this extraordinary season of television and can’t wait to spend the evening with you all on Sept. 15.”\n\nCraig Erwich, the president of Disney Television Group, praised the Levys, saying, “Eugene’s and Dan’s comedic intuition and uncanny ability to capture the hearts of viewers will make for a memorable Emmys telecast honoring this year’s best and brightest.”\n\nEugene Levy is also nominated at this year’s Emmys for his show *The Reluctant Traveler*. Back in 2020, the Levys made history as the first father and son to win awards in the same year. This year, they’ll achieve another milestone by becoming the first father-son duo to host the awards show.\n\nAt the 76th Annual Emmys, the Japanese drama *Shōgun* leads the nominations with 25, while *The Bear* earned 23 nominations—setting a new record for the most nominations in a single year by a comedy.\n\nThe Emmys will air live from Los Angeles on Sunday, September 15, at 8 p.m. Eastern on ABC, with a stream available the following day on Hulu.\n\nNothing is more entertaining than viewing a film where the plot is progressively revealed with each unexpected turn of events. The audience is kept actively interested by their curiosity about what will happen next. Over the years, Bollywood has produced many mystery films that cinema buffs love and appreciate. These Bollywood mystery films are the ideal approach to sate the hunger for individuals who love the feeling of being taken on an adventure with engrossing storytelling!\n\nJaane Jaan (2023)\n\nJaane Jaan is based on Keigo Higashino’s 2005 Japanese novel The Devotion of Suspect X. The narrative centres on a single mother who becomes involved in her husband’s death. While a dedicated police investigator works to find the truth, the neighbouring maths instructor helps to conceal the crime.\n\nHaseen Dillruba (2021)\n\nIn Haseen Dilruba, a lady who is being investigated for her husband’s murder divulges details of their tumultuous marriage, thereby impeding the pursuit of the truth. Watching this murder mystery with a twist of romantic drama is highly recommended, especially since Vikrant Massey steals the show and Tapsee Pannu plays a pivotal role.\n\nThe Girl On The Train (2021)\n\nA troubled divorcée becomes fixated on a seemingly perfect couple she watches from afar. But when an unexpected remark pulls her into a dark murder investigation, her world unravels. Starring Parineeti Chopra with intense eyes, the charismatic Avinash Tiwari, and the graceful Aditi Rao Hydari, this gripping thriller, *The Girl On The Train*, will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nIttefaq (2017)\n\nIn a double murder case, a housewife and a writer become the prime suspects and the only witnesses. As a detective navigates a web of coincidences, the mystery deepens. *Ittefaq*, a stylish thriller starring Sidharth Malhotra, Sonakshi Sinha, and Akshaye Khanna, is packed with action and rapid twists, making it a must-watch for your list.\n\nTalvar (2015)\n\n*Talvar* is a Bollywood thriller based on a real-life double murder case that shook India to its core. The film follows the investigation into the brutal killings of a teenage girl and her family’s servant, unraveling various theories that surround the case. As the story unfolds, the complexities of the legal process, conflicting evidence, and political pressures add layers of confusion. *Talvar* highlights the flaws and intricacies of the justice system, prompting viewers to question the nature of truth and the impact of societal pressures on criminal investigations.\n\nBadla (2019)\n\n*Badla* is a gripping thriller that follows a renowned lawyer (Amitabh Bachchan) who is brought in to defend a woman (Tapsee Pannu) accused of murdering her lover. As they dig deeper into the case, the truth becomes increasingly elusive and complex. The film is bolstered by sharp editing, a compelling musical score, and striking cinematography, all of which enhance the strong storyline and outstanding performances.\n\nPhir Aayi Hasseen Dillruba (2024)\n\nEscaping from the police in Agra, Rani and Rishu decide to elope together. When their plan goes awry, Rani seeks a helping hand from a kind admirer.\n\nMerry Christmas (2024)\n\nSriram Raghavan’s *Merry Christmas* is a captivating mystery thriller set in 1980s Bombay. Starring Vijay Sethupathi and Katrina Kaif, the film follows Albert, a man ensnared in a web of secrets and lies on Christmas Eve. As he tries to protect Maria (played by Katrina Kaif) from suspicion, Albert uncovers shocking truths that lead to a heart-pounding finale.\n\nHave you ever envisioned a rapper from Kerala taking off similar pranks for a viral music video on the internet? That’s exactly what HanuMankind’s “Big Dawgs” has accomplished, racking up over 17 million views on YouTube and holding the 43rd position in the worldwide top music video chart right now.\n\n“Pushing culture baby, got that product you can’t measure,” is the official slogan of the “Big Dawgs.” Rapper HanuMankind, who was born in Kerala, wrote, sang, and performed the song that launched desi hip-hop on a worldwide scale. This newest Instagram success is causing social media influencers, music reviewers, and fans worldwide to go crazy.\n\nThe newest mega song, “Big Dawg” featuring Kalmi, is causing quite a stir among hip-hop fans worldwide. Texas is where Sooraj Cherukat, better known by his stage as HanuMankind, spent his formative years. He created the ideal combination of desi and global components in the ‘Big Dawg’ music video by incorporating sounds with a Texas flavour.\n\n‘Big Dawg’ is a raw video with a South American flavour, shot in Ponnani, Kerala, a coastal district. It has a desi swagger and an explosive punk vibe that is hard-hitting due to its South Indian location. It is Instagram-worthy thanks to its intense drumbeats, gritty graphics, heart-pounding moments, and deft editing.\n\nWith songs like “Rush Hour,” “Genghis,” and “Go To Sleep,” HanuMankind is becoming one of the most prominent names in popular hip-hop. ‘Big Dawgs’ has now catapulted him to an unparalleled level as an industry innovator.\n\nBijoy Shetty is the director of “Big Dawgs,” and Kalmi of Brown Crew Productions is supporting the film. The main rider, Sulthan Sheikh, Moor Saleem, Muhammad Shadab Ansari, and Kashish Sheikh all perform the tricks."
