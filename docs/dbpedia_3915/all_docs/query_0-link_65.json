        "text": "Writer: Reshma Ghatala / Gautham Menon\n\nRunning Time: 154 min.\n\nGenre: Romance/Musical\n\nNOTABLE CAST:\n\nSamantha as Nithya Vasudevan\n\nJiiva as Varun Krishnan\n\nSanthanam as Prakash\n\nA decade after his directorial debut with the heart warming blockbuster Minnale, which is still on the list of all time favourite rom-coms of Tamil Cinema, Gautham cannot look down at his favourite genre, which is romance. Romance, as professed by the urban youth of our times. A learned in mechanics, he often explored the sensitivity of love within a glossy premise. Neethane En PonVasantham [You are my Golden Spring] – U, starts as an accomplishment of his endless bequeathing to this soul-searching populace.\n\nNithya and Varun, and their love-hate trysts beginning as neighbourhood Kids, adolescents at school, as confused at 20 and adults at 24 forms the bit by bit transcending screenplay that bears hardly few differences with films right from SJ Surya’s Kushi to Aishwarya’s ‘3’. Laced in girl-boy relationship, the film captures the break ups of Nithya and Varun at each phase of their life.\n\nWhile both Jiiva and Samantha have taken due care to look their age, the later with her cuteness initially and sensuality later clinches the attention of the audience all-age-inclusive. But, it isn’t good enough to want us to bond them as badly as we wanted Rajesh and Reena in Minnale or Karthik and Jessie in VTV.\n\nCinema is an audio-visual medium and one’s dominance over other cannot be sensible without conviction. Music has always been an integral slice of Gautham’s outings; barring the lone experimental Nadunisi Naigal. No matter if it was a cop story as in Kakka Kakka or a semi-biographical Varanam Ayiram, his melodic encounters made our heartstrings hum with them. With the maestro in his company, Gautham is never short of the fillip, and the first half of the narration sandwiched between 4 songs is sure to go with the younger cine-goers. But narrating the lengthy family’s bonding and marriage discussion steals dear moments of the running time, only in vain.\n\nSanthanam’s role initially light up the screens, but with lack of detail and predictable one-liners, he ends up with one of the dull portrayals in his recent times. A musical, by definition, 8 + 1 screen songs, Ilaiyaraja must have felt pointless of offering his background score, many of the scenes pass over without a sound.\n\nA filmmaker resorts to single shot sequences, very consciously, to create a well-built tension, but Gautham’s idea of lengthy single shots from distance do not work perfectly here. He either applied them falsely or let himself be ill advised.\n\nWith due credits to Gautham in structuring the narration and the milieu, like the transformation from independent dwellings to apartments, Ilaiyaraja’s unparallel orchestration and some brilliant voice rendering by musicians, Samantha’s stunning performances, NEP still falls short in the second half in dull slack and a much predictable clichéd climax.\n\nParadoxical, the decade old Minnale, still infuses freshness with its style and substance, but the two-day-old Neethane En Ponvasantham sounds monotonous already.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nNEP Verdict: As someone said, better luck next time to Gautham.\n\nOverall Rating: 2.6/5\n\nOriginal Script: 1/5\n\nCredits: Reshma Ghatala / Gautham Menon\n\nTechnical Mastering: 2.5/5\n\nCredits: Ilaiyaraja, M S Prabhu, Om Prakash, Antony\n\nForeground & Background Score: 3/5\n\nCredits: laiyaraja\n\nCasting & Performance: 3/5\n\nCredits: Samantha, Jiiva, Santhanam\n\nPublicity & Screening: 3.5/5\n\nCredits: Photon Kathas, R S Infotainment\n\n====================================================================="
