Nalini Sriram is doing the costumes and editing will be done by Antony.\n\nThe shoot commenced yesterday and today, filming is going on at Cafe Coffee Day, Nungambakkam. The team will be shooting in and around Chennai till the 24th of this month and then they will pack their bags and fly to London to film the later portions and a couple of songs.\n\nIn further news, Neethane En Ponvasantham is going to be a bilingual and will be released in Tamil and Telugu. Samatha will be seen in the Telugu version as well and word is that Ram, recently seen in the hit Telugu film, Kandireega with Hansika will play Jiiva's role. There is every indication this film is going to be a charming love story along the lines of Minnale and VTV."
