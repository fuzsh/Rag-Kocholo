        "text": "Neethane En Ponvasantham!!!\n\nTruly for Class A audience only...\n\nLots of people have already criticized the film...\n\nThere were some logical misses throughout the film and déjà vu sensations in several portions of the film...\n\nBut... GVM and Ilaiyaraja duo will make you forget it and make you nod your head for Neethane En Ponvasantham,\n\nAwesome Film!!\n\nWorth every single penny...\n\nYou will feel the way Gautham emphasizes romance through fights for sure if you watch it once again...\n\nBest romantic movie...\n\nDefinitely BETTER than VTV!!\n\nRaja Sir has nothing else to prove in the field of music. His stride in music is already known to all and his entry in film music is definitely a remarkable moment in Indian Film Era. In NEP, he makes us feel that Mozart and Beethoven are still living with his orchestration. Songs like Pudikala Maamu, Pengal Yendral and Saaynthu Saaynthu make us feel that the songs are composed by a genius who is in his early 20s...\n\nI am so sure that you will fall in love with Nithya Vasudevan and I forgot that Samantha played the heroine of the film. Hats off to Gautham Vasudev Menon to make this magic happen!!\n\nIt is a real good role for Jiiva where he had to share enough space with Santhanam and allow Samantha to overplay him...\n\nIt is an excellent film and I can find the positive reviews about the film in Social Networking sites are winning over the negative reviews...\n\nGVM has really made me feel the travel between 1990 - 2007 without mentioning the year anywhere. It is not so easy to screenplay a 3rd person's script for the first time. But he has proved it with his usual slow pace...\n\nNeethane En Ponvasantham - A Masterpiece by Gautham Vasudev Menon...\n\nNote: Please don't watch this film just once!! It will addict you to watch again and again after the second time!!"
