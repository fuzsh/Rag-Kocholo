        "meta_description": "Venkat Prabhu has come in as a surprise entry to director Vijay's next film, and the film has been tentatively titled 'Thalapathy 68'. The official announcement regarding the film was made yesterday (May 21), and wishes have been pouring in for the director on social media since then. Though the announcement came in yesterday, Venkat Prabhu's collaboration with Vijay has been in talks for the last ten months. Reports state that while working for 'Custody' with Naga Chaitanya director Venkat Prabhu narrated a one-liner to Vijay when the actor was filming for his last release 'Varisu'. Then director Venkat Prabhu developed the one-liner to impress Vijay a week before with the final script, and this was when reports about their union start to surface on the internet. But the makers didn't take much time to make it official. Yuvan Shankar will score for 'Thalapathy 68' and the composer has reunited with Vijay after 20 years. The pre-production work for 'Thalapathy 68' will take another two or three months, and the film's shooting will commence in the final quarter of 2023. 'Thalapathy 68' will be a 2024 summer release, and the union of the fresh duo has already stirred up the expectation among the fans. Vijay is currently filming for 'Leo' with director Lokesh Kanagaraj, and the film's shooting is progressing firmly as the film is scheduled to release on 19.10.2023.",
