        "text": "Actor Samantha Ruth Prabhu, in a recent health podcast video with Dr David Jockers (natural medicine practitioner), spoke about discovering supplements and alternate medicine. She added a disclaimer to her podcast video asking people to consult their physician and care provider before taking them. She further mentioned that the video she posted is for 'informational purposes only'. This comes weeks after her online spat with hepatologist Sr Cyriac Philip Abby aka The Liver Doc over hydrogen peroxide nebulization.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the podcast, she said that she found Dr David Jockers when she researched functional nutrition. She also claimed that Jockers had been a friend to her from the United States.\n\nSamantha has shared over 20 health podcasts over the last few weeks. However, what's different this time is the addition of a disclaimer.\n\nHer disclaimer reads, \"The information, including but not limited to, audio, text, graphics, images and other material contained in this episode are for informational purposes only. No material in this episode is intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health care provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition or treatment and before undertaking a new health care regimen, and never disregard professional medical advice or delay in seeking it because of something you have heard in this podcast (sic).\"\n\nHere's the post:\n\nEarlier, Samantha spoke about how hydrogen peroxide and distilled water nebulization helped cure her cold. Her post led to a war of words with Dr Cyriac Philips Abby, who is fondly known as The Liver Doc on X.\n\nDr Philips debunked her claim and called her a 'health illiterate'. He criticised her harshly and stated that hydrogen peroxide nebulization would lead to irritation in the lungs and eventually damage the organ as well.\n\nSamantha shared a three-page statement in which she said that her intention was to help people and not to harm others. In the podcast that was released recently, she added a disclaimer. This disclaimer wasn't a part of her podcast-related posts.\n\nHere's her statement:\n\nSamantha, after her Myositis (an auto-immune condition) diagnosis, found alternate medicine to help her. Over the years, she had been vocal about it as well.\n\nWork-wise, Samantha Ruth Prabhu will be seen next in Prime Video's 'Citadel: Honey Bunny'. She also has a Telugu film titled 'Bangaram' in the pipeline."
