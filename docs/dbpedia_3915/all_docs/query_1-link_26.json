        "text": "•|PROGRESSION|•\n\nThe car as I had mentioned earlier is the sole witness and the third wheel to Nithya and Varun’s story. Every scene succeeding the one with the Car leads to a progression in their story. During the flashback scenes we see a young Nithya looking at her reflection in the car mirror, before “accidentally” bumping into Varun. During their high school we see a lot of shots involving the car which paves way to their budding childhood romance. From stolen kisses on the cheek, holding hands, passing chits and exchanging gifts. But in all these scenes the car is driven by someone else, implying their lack of control over their relationship which has been blossoming overtime.\n\nWe cut to the present, where Varun and Nithya are in college. Following their first ‘proper’ date at a coffee shop, we see Varun and Nithya driving home from Varun’s college. The steering is in Varun’s control and whilst he is telling Nithya not to make these visits regular, she is blissful in that moment handing the reins of her heart(the steering wheel) to Varun. On Nithya’s birthday she is the first one to confess her love for him, though Varun is holding the steering wheel, he can’t tear his eyes away from Nithya. They are nestled together in each other’s presence in the cocoon of the Car and later enter the party as a couple. After Nithya’s friend’s wedding the control seamlessly shifts to Nithya, and back to Varun shuffling his seat in another shot. While walking through the park, their silhouettes lit by backlight, we see the Car in the background as if genially looking at them.\n\nAfter Nithya leaves to Edinburgh, Varun’s priorities change as he starts preparing for CAT exams. On Nithya’s return she surprises Varun with her new car and asks Varun to drive it. Varun shows his reluctance to do so indicating the oscillation in his mind regarding the future of their relationship. Nithya is distraught at his shift of attitude and she is shown waiting about in her car. The vehicle is shown to be stationary, implying how Nithya’s is stuck in the relationship. This buildup leads to a confrontation and they breakup.\n\nEven after Varun’s attempt at reconciliation they don’t get back together and Nithya arrives at Varun’s wedding reception. She arrives in a car driven by someone else, once again indicative of not being in control of their relationship. Later that night she drops by Varun’s home and as she leaves, Varun shows her his car i.e his life without Nithya. He asks her to drive it for old times sake, and over the next few minutes, they both shift two and fro from the steering wheel while revisiting their favourite haunts. In the climax, they are shown to be kissing and making up and surprise! The Car makes a final appearance of approval and stands as a testament to their tumultuous journey of love.\n\nAn underrated gem of director Gautam Vasudev Menon finds a place as my first series of posts, because personally to me, it was this movie that unraveled itself to me on a train journey back home and prompted me to start this blog.\n\nNeethane en ponvasantham follows the story of Nithya and Varun from their childhood, traversing through their high school, college and work along the way. There are a lot of sequences with them steering away a car, this inanimate object is the literal 3rd wheel/propeller of their story and is also an indicative of the consequences of they decisions they make.\n\nEvery major shift in Varun’s life can be attributed to Nithya leaving him in a spot. The first time they are separated after Nithya moves out of their apartment complex and a silly misunderstanding causes a rift between them.\n\nThe second time, they split in their high school playground, due to their immature understanding of attention, time and prioritising responsibilities. Nithya walks away leaving Varun stranded and she cites fulfilling her duties which is keeping them apart, which is a subtle foreshadow to the future where they breakup. Nithya returns from Edinburgh to find a changed person in Varun, whom on confrontation confesses to fulfillimg familial responsibilities. The final and major shift in Varun’s life comes a few months after the argument in Manappad. Nithya visits him after his reception where they take a trip down memory lane and revisit their favourite haunts, as her attempt of seeking a truce and sorting their differences.\n\nIn 2 out of these 4 incidents Nithya drives away in her car leaving an untethered Varun to his reality which is engulfing him.\n\nPart-2 is coming soon! Stay tuned."
