        "text": "Samantha Ruth Prabhu has been one of the biggest superstars in the South film industry for over a decade now. She is beautiful, talented, versatile and has a screen presence that is unmatched by anyone. This year, she took the Hindi film industry by storm with her impressive role as Raaji in The Family Man 2 and that was how I was introduced to her power on screen. Her aura and craft compelled me to revisit some of her old work in the Southern industry and my admiration for her just grew post that. And now, after making her presence felt in the Hindi industry, Samantha is set to go international with renowned Downtown Abbey director, Philip John.\n\nAccording to a source, the actress had a meeting with Philip, earlier this month in Chennai which then eventually evolved into a concrete discussion about a collaboration. The project is a feature film titled The Arrangements Of Love, based on Timeri N Murari’s novel by the same name.\n\nTaking to her Instagram, Samantha made this news official earlier today by sharing the announcement poster of the film along with a picture of herself with Philip.\n\nCheck out the post here:\n\nAn excited Samantha opened up to Variety about this big news in her career, while raving about her director Philip. The project also marks her reunion with Sunitha Tati, who is backing this film and had also backed her 2014 film, Oh! Baby.\n\nSamantha said:\n\n“A whole new world opens up for me today as I start my journey with ‘Arrangements of Love,’ which has such an endearing and personal story. I am excited to work with Philip John, whose projects I have closely followed for many years, being a big fan of ‘Downton Abbey.’ I am looking forward to collaborating with Sunitha once again and I hope for only more success than we previously had with ‘Oh! Baby’. My role is a complex character and it will be both a challenge and an opportunity for me to play it. I cannot wait to get on set.”\n\nThe Arrangements Of Love follows the story of a Welsh-Indian man on his quest to find his estranged father with an impromptu visit to his homeland. In that, Samantha plays a strong minded and funny force of nature 27-year-old, who is a progressive bisexual Tamil woman and runs her own detective agency, thus becoming part of the search. She has ultra-traditional parents, who want her to have an arranged marriage, and as much as she wants to please her parents, she also wants to be able to make her own life choices.\n\nSamantha has an immense amount of talent that cannot be restrained and this project is just the beginning for her. I am sure that The Arrangements Of Love will lay the perfect groundwork for the actress’ flourishing career in the future. As an Indian, it fills me with pride whenever any talent from our country is recognised globally and I am really excited for Samantha as she embarks on this new journey, trying to make India proud."
