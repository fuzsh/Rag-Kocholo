        "text": "It’s easy for people to have an air about themselves when they are part of stardom in the cine world. But for dance master, actor and director Prabhu Deva, humility is his middle name.\n\nIn Bengaluru to promote his latest film ABCD 2 along with co-stars Shraddha Kapoor and Varun Dhawan, the actor exuded a quiet modesty, be it on stage or off it, that is so synonymous with his persona.\n\nExcited to be in Bengaluru, Prabhu says the city is his home after all. “My parents hail from a village near Mysore. I always have a deep connection with this city,” he says adding “Bengaluru namma ooru,” in his best Kannada.\n\nElaborating his experience in the movie, the superstar says: “In ABCD1 it was only me. The character I play has his own charisma. But In ABCD2 the film has gotten bigger with stars like Shraddha Kapoor and Varun Dhawan teaming up with me. The story is also completely different so viewers can expect something totally new.”\n\nBased on the real life struggle of choreographers Vishnu and Suresh from Vasai, a suburb in Mumbai, who went on to win the world hip-hop dance championship, ABCD2 explores the concept of ‘anyone can dance if they believe in it’ in a deeper perspective.\n\nOn dancing for the second dedicated film on dance in India, Prabhu modestly puts his experience across.\n\n“In the first movie, it was tough. In the second one, it was tougher. There are better dancers in the field. And I am also getting older,” he says.\n\nHowever, the actor quickly points out that the most interesting part of working in ABCD 1 and 2 is that these movies have given him the feel of dancing again. “In other movies, people will just be on the set and actors will come and go. But here, everyone is dancing and rehearsing. Everyone on the set has so much energy and they put their heart into dancing. The vibe was completely dreamlike. Each day on the set was like a celebration of dance. It was an absolute fun atmosphere. I’m going to miss the cast and crew.”\n\nAbbreviated as Any Body Can Dance, ABCD speaks a lot through its story.\n\nPrabhu agrees. “When people watch this movie, it doesn’t necessarily have a message to convey, but you will still carry back something deeper than just a good film. It’s based on a true story of two small children hailing from a small town near Mumbai who love dancing and go on to become world champions. So this rise from nobody to somebody of significant value through hard work is what people can take back. If you work hard, nothing is impossible. When you watch the film, you will also appreciate the excellent way this message has been conveyed.”\n\nOn working with director Remo D'Souza, Prabhu says the choreographer-turned director is his closest friend and colleague.\n\n“I always tell Remo that he has great skill in direction, which in many ways surpasses his skills as a choreographer. He’s done a fantastic job in the movie.”\n\nElaborating on his journey so far, Prabhu says as a choreographer, teaching is what comes closest to his heart. “It’s great to be in a position to share my experience and the lessons I’ve learnt with others.” He adds quickly that he doesn’t give advice to anyone.\n\n“The rising talent these days are very sharp in their mind. I don’t even advice my children. They know what to do. Most of them already have the right approach to getting out there and making it big.”\n\nPointing out that coming to cinema itself is a turning point in his career, Prabhu emphasises that he had never expected to come so far. “Looking back, the most challenging thing for me was actually directing. It’s very tough. Being in front of the camera is easy since the director can tell me what to do. But being the director and giving people directions is the toughest thing for me,” he reveals with a laugh and mockingly wiping sweat off his brow.\n\nLooking ahead, the dance enigma says he never makes plans. “I did not even plan where I am today. I had not planned to become an actor or a dance master or even a director. I just let life guide me wherever it needs me to go. I want to continue to dance since it is life for me, but it all depends on God,” he gestures upwards.\n\nABCD2 releases on June 26."
