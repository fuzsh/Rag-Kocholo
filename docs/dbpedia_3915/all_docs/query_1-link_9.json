Finally I had the chance to see Neethane En Ponvasantham.\n\nJeeva and Samantha were apt, music was blissfull, comedy worked in patches, enjoyed Santhanam’s “Chillout machi”, “Malta inga thaan Mysore pakathule thaan iruku”.\n\nNever felt bored though the travel was predictable. Would surely loop in Yennodu vaa vaa and Kaatrai Konjam whenever possible.\n\nEnjoyable romantic musical film that I liked!"
