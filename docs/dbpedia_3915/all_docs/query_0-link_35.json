        "text": "The 2012 romantic drama, Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu, starring Nani and Samantha, is set to re-release in theaters on August 2, joining the ongoing trend of re-releases. Directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, the cult film was originally released in 2012 and will hit theaters again under the banner of Lakshmi Narasimha Movies. This re-release offers a new opportunity for new audiences to experience the film's captivating storyline and memorable performances.\n\nYeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu holds a special place in Gautham Vasudev Menon's filmography as his third Telugu film. The movie was simultaneously shot in Tamil, titled Neethaane En Ponvasantham, with Jiiva playing the male lead. The film's music, composed by Iliayaraaja, remains a highlight, making it the only Gautham Vasudev Menon film with his music direction. The cinematography by MS Prabhu added to the film's visual appeal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie marked the second collaboration between Nani and Samantha, who had previously worked together in SS Rajamouli's Eega (2012). As the re-release approaches, fans are eagerly awaiting the chance to re-watch Yeto Vellipoyindhi Manasu on the big screen once again. Meanwhile, Gautham Vasudev Menon's upcoming action film, Dhruva Natachathiram, starring Vikram, awaits release despite being complete due to financial constraints."
