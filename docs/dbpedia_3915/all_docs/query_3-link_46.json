As the Mozart of Madras turned 55 today, we take a look at his life.\n\nAR Rahman Biography\n\nBirth 6 January 1967 Real Name AS Dileep Kumar Full Name Allah Rakha Rahman (A.R.

Ameen (son)\n\nNet Worth $24 million USD Awards\n\nPadma Shri\n\nPadma Bhushan\n\n2 Oscars\n\nNational Awards\n\nAR Rahman Biography: Birth, Age, Real Name, Family, and Education\n\nAR Rahman was born as AS Dileep Kumar on 6 January 1967 in Madras, Tamil Nadu to musician RK Shekhar, and Kareema Begum (born as Kashturi). Rahman began learning piano at the age of four and assisted his father in the studio.\n\nWhen Rahman was nine, his father passed away. Rahman who was then studying in Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan started working to support his family. Furthermore, the family rented out his father's musical instruments to earn a living.\n\nAs Rahman was working hard to make the ends meet, he failed the exams. Mrs. YGP, the then principal of the school summoned his mother and told her to take him to the streets of Kodambakkam to beg and not to send him to the school anymore.\n\nPost this incident, Rahman attended MCN for a year and then Madras Christian College Higher Secondary School. However, Rahman dropped out of school with the permission of his mother to pursue a career in music.\n\nHe later earned a scholarship from Trinity College London to the Trinity College of Music and graduated with a diploma in Western classical music from the music school in Madras.\n\nRahman is a practicing Muslim who converted from Hinduism in his 20s along with his family and changed his name to Allah Rakha Rahman (A.R. Rahman) from AS Dileep Kumar.\n\nAR Rahman Wife and Children\n\nAR Rahman married Saira Banu in 1995 and the couple gave birth to three children-- Khateeja Rahman (daughter), Rahima Rahman (daughter), and A.R. Ameen (son).\n\nAR Rahman Religion\n\nAfter the untimely death of his father, the family went through difficult times. AR Rahman who was a practicing Hindu converted to Islam in his 20s along with his family.\n\nSufism attracted the family and before the release of Rahman's first major project, Roja, the family converted to Islam. His mother Kareema Begum even insisted on changing Rahman's name in the film’s credits at the last minute and was very particular about it. She would’ve rather not had his name appear at all, than not have his new name appear on the credits.\n\nA lot of people ask AR Rahman if they can become successful after converting to Islam but he prefers to keep quiet. He once said, \"It’s not about converting to Islam, it’s about finding the spot and seeing whether it presses the button in you. The spiritual teachers, the Sufi teachers, taught me and my mom things that are very, very special. There are special things in every faith, and this is the one we chose. And we stand by it.”\n\nAR Rahman Music Career\n\nAt the age of nine, AR Rahman accidentally played a tune on the piano when he was with his father in the studio, which was later developed by R.K. Shekhar into a complete song.\n\nInitially, Rahman was trained under Master Dhanraj, and at the age of 11, he started playing the orchestra of M.K. Arjunan who was a Malayalam music composer and his father's close friend. Soon after this, he began working with several composers including M. S. Viswanathan, Vijaya Bhaskar, Ilaiyaraaja, Ramesh Naidu, Vijay Anand, Hamsalekha, and Raj–Koti.\n\nInitially, AR Rahman composed scores for documentaries and jingles for TV ads and got the much-awaited break in 1992 when director Mani Ratnam approached him to compose the score and soundtrack for Roja, a Tamil film. He was later signed by Cinematographer Santosh Sivan for Yoddha, a Malayalam film.\n\nThe following year, AR Rahman won his first National Award for the best music director for Roja. He followed this with successful scores and songs for Tamil Cinema. Rahman later collaborated with director Bharathiraaja and successfully produced songs for Tamil rural folk-inspired films.\n\nHe attracted a Japanese audience with the Tamil film Muthu. His soundtracks started gaining recognition at the International level too as they were a combination of Western classical music, Carnatic and Tamil traditional and folk-music traditions, jazz, reggae, and rock music.\n\nHis soundtrack album for Minsaara Kanavu, the Chennai production, won him his second National Film Award for Best Music Direction and a South Filmfare Award for Best Music Direction in a Tamil film in 1997.

Saya\" from its soundtrack were an international hit.\n\nBy the end of 2012, Rahman's music for Mani Ratnam's Kadal topped the iTunes India chart for December.\n\nHis background scores are a combination of subtle orchestration and ambient sounds.
