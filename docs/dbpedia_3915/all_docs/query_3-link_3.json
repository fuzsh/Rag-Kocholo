RajuStarringCinematographyVenuEdited byK. V. Krishna ReddyMusic byDevi Sri Prasad\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nDistributed bySumanth Arts\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n161 minutesCountryIndiaLanguageTelugu\n\nNuvvostanante Nenoddantana (pronounced [nuvːostaːnaṇʈeː neːnodːaṇʈaːnaː]; transl. If you wish to come, would I refuse?) is a 2005 Indian Telugu-language romantic comedy film[1] directed by Prabhu Deva in his directorial debut and produced by M. S. Raju under Sumanth Art Productions who gave the screenplay as well.[2] The film stars Srihari, Siddharth, and Trisha. The music is composed by Devi Sri Prasad with cinematography by Venu.\n\nVeeru Potla wrote the story that is inspired from the 1989 Hindi film Maine Pyar Kiya,[3][4] where an affluent boy travels to the village of his girlfriend against their parent's wishes to prove his love. The film's title was inspired by the song of the same name from Varsham (2004), sung by K. S. Chithra.\n\nThe film won nine Filmfare Awards South (including Best Film) and five Nandi Awards. The film was remade in nine other languages—the highest for any Indian film.[1][5] The film also has the distinction of receiving most Filmfare awards by any South Indian film.[6]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nSiri (Trisha) is a traditional, simple, rural girl from Andhra Pradesh who is brought up by her only older brother Sivaramakrishna (Srihari). Twenty years prior, their rich father from a nearby town married another woman and kicked the rest of Siri's family, humiliating them on the way. Their mother dies leaving toddler Siri in the care of 13-year-old Sivaramakrishna. With help of relatives, her grave is built on the small land which the siblings inherited, but the Zamindar Muddu Krishnaiah tells them that it is his land, since their mother had not repaid a loan from the man. Sivaramakrishna begs Muddu Krishnaiah and asks for an extension promising to work day and night to pay off the loan, as long as they don't tear down his mother's grave. Muddu Krishnaiah agrees upon security from the local station master. Slowly, Sivaramakrishna turns the tables using his handwork and becomes a rich enough farmer, and Siri grows up to complete engineering in a nearby town. One day, Lalitha, Siri's best friend from school time comes to their house to invite Siri to their house as she is getting married. Sivaramakrishna agrees to send Siri a week ahead of the marriage. Santosh(Siddharth), Lalitha's cousin, a rich city boy born to millionaire parents Janaki and Prakash and brought up in London, also arrives on the same day with his mother.\n\nSlowly, Santosh and Siri fall in love, but Janaki does not bear it as Siri is a poor girl, and thus does not meet their standards. Santosh is also to be married to Janaki's brother Srinivasa Rao's business partner's (JP) daughter’s Dolly. When Sivaramakrishna arrives at the wedding, Janaki humiliates him as well as Siri. Both are thrown of the house after Janaki accuses them of trying to entice and trap Santosh. When Santosh learns of this, he goes to Siri's house and pleads to her brother to accept him. Sivaramakrishna gives him a chance, just like he was given a chance by Krishnaiah when he was a child. Santosh is tasked to take care of the cows, clean up after them, and grow more crops than Sivaramakrishna by the end of the season; if he does not, Santosh shall leave the village forever and never see Siri again. Krishnaiah is not happy as he wanted his son to marry Siri. With them, Dolly, and her father trying to get Santosh to lose the competition, Santosh has to work hard for his love, eating red chillies and rice every day, even though he can't bear it. In spite of many antics from Krishnaiah's and Dolly's side, Santosh eventually proves his love for Siri to Sivaramakrishna and succeeds in growing more grain. However, Krishnaiah and JP kidnap Siri and then try to force her to marry his son. A fight takes place in which Santosh kills Krishnaiah‘s son while Sivaramakrishna violently defeats Santosh's uncle's business partner and Krishnaiah. After realizing that Santosh and Siri should be together, Sivaramakrishna takes the blame for the murder and spends five years in prison.\n\nSivaramakrishna is released from prison after five years and Janaki accepts Siri as her daughter-in-law. Finally Siri and Santosh get married, in everyone's presence.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nAs per the film's end credits:[7]\n\nSrihari as Sivarama Krishna, Siri's elder brother\n\nSiddharth as Santosh, Janaki and Prakash's son\n\nTrisha as Siri, Sivarama Krishna's sister and Santosh's love interest\n\nVeda as Lalitha \"Lalli\", Siri's best friend and Santosh's cousin\n\nPrakash Raj as Prakash, Santosh's father\n\nSanthoshi as Gowri\n\nGeetha as Janaki Prakash, Santosh's mother\n\nSunil as Banda\n\nTanikella Bharani as Kantepudi Srinivasa Rao\n\nNanditha Jennifer as Dolly\n\nJaya Prakash Reddy as JP, Srinivasa Rao's business partner and Dolly's father\n\nParuchuri Venkateswara Rao as Station Master\n\nChandra Mohan as Chandram, Jailor\n\nNarsing Yadav as Narasimha\n\nAjay as Lalli's blackmailer\n\nDharmavarapu Subramanyam as Udayagiri Subbarao\n\nNarra Venkateswara Rao as Muddu Krishnaiyya\n\nRaghu Babu as Tempo Rao\n\nSana as Lalli's mother\n\nGundu Hanumantha Rao as a priest\n\nPavala Syamala as the grandmother\n\nAbhishek as Muddu Krishnaiyya's Son\n\nMaster Nandu as young Sivarama Krishna\n\nPrabhu Deva as the bullock cart driver in the song \"Paripoke Pitta\" (special appearance)\n\nM.

Raju brought in Prabhu Deva, who choreographed the song \"Nuvvostanante\" in his production Varsham, to direct the film although Deva was hesitant to direct a film.[8] Raju initially wanted to name the film O Prema Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana, but decided against it because the title was relatively long.[9] Siddharth was cast after Raju liked his performance in Boys (2003) and wanted to cast someone who was underexposed in the industry.[10]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nNuvvostanante NenoddantanaSoundtrack album by Released21 December 2004Recorded2004GenreFilm soundtrackLength32:31LanguageTeluguLabelAditya MusicProducerDevi Sri PrasadDevi Sri Prasad chronology\n\nNaa Alludu\n\n(2004) Nuvvostanante Nenoddantana\n\n(2004) Thirupaachi\n\n(2005)\n\nThe soundtrack features eight songs composed by Devi Sri Prasad.[11] The soundtrack featured a remixed version of the song \"Prema Kosamai Volalo\" sung by Ghantasala for the 1951 film Pathala Bhairavi.
