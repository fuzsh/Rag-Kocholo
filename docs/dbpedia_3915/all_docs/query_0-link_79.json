        "text": "Dress: MACH & MACH\n\nSoft-spoken, yet articulate. Funny, with a laugh that resonates. And, that confidence. A spark that lights up a room. Samantha Ruth Prabhu gives us a glimpse into what it takes to be a self-made superstar in India\n\nThe year is 2005, or maybe 2006? Samantha Ruth Prabhu is sitting with her girlfriends from college. The barely-20-somethings are playing a game. Each of them takes a turn to say what they wish for in life. Someone hopes for a good boy, someone else, a good-looking husband. Samantha wants a house. “I think my biggest dream was to afford a house I could call my own,” she reminisces. “That was always the dream. Back then, it was more than enough; I wouldn’t have dared to dream bigger than that.” That’s exactly why she is not quite comfortable with this memory today. She wants her younger self to have wished for more, to have dreamt bigger, and to not have been afraid of her ambitions. “I’m not saying it will be easy, but you should not be afraid to dream big. You have every right to dream big. You are allowed to have the biggest ambitions. If you’re thinking of a little white house, change that dream. Dream of a mansion! Dream it all!” The camera captures her conviction as she appeals to young women everywhere to not settle for less. She arrived, warm and almost nonchalant, in a grey jumpsuit to our cover shoot set. She switched to siren mode in a hot second once in front of the camera, and didn’t take a break until it was pack-up time. Once she starts something, the lady sees it through.\n\nWhat Samantha feels about her ambition from a different lifetime is reflected in her journey from Ye Maaya Chesave (2010) to Citadel India (2024). Last month, Samantha completed 14 years in the entertainment industry. In this period, she has stood tall through several twists and turns – from the peaks of success and award-winning performances to a life-threatening illness and a divorce. And she wouldn’t have life happen any other way. “All the highs and lows that I’ve experienced have brought me to this point in life,” she avers. “I have seen the highest highs and the lowest lows, and I wouldn’t change a thing. People might think that success defines you, but it is failure and loss that truly define you, and introduce you to the best version of yourself. These lows and these losses have made me a person I am truly proud of.”\n\nDress: Gaurav Gupta\n\nIn the initial years, she struck gold in the Tamil and Telugu film industries with back-to-back hits. In 2012, her films Neethaane En Ponvasantham and Eega brought her several accolades – including major awards. She also became only the second actor to win both the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu and the Best Actress – Tamil award in the same year. Samantha believes that the whirlwind of initial hits contributed immensely to her filmography, awards shelf, stars and destiny. “It wasn’t really hard work,” she says, adding, after a brief pause, “But, now, I can say I am truly proud of myself for having gone through some hardships and come out of them a stronger, better person. Today, I can say I’m prouder of this version of me than I’ve ever been.” Her recovery from the rare auto-immune disease myositis, Samantha tells us, has given her a more evolved perspective on life. Her profession, she adds, also makes her a better person. “The kind of appreciation and the rewarding experience that you get from being an actor – it makes you feel like you need to give back. It makes you believe that destiny has been kind to you, people have been kind to you, and it has taught me the importance of giving back,” she reiterates.\n\nLights, Camera, ACTION!\n\nAs we go to press, the world is waiting to get a glimpse of this strength of character in her portrayal of Honey in the Amazon epic action series Citadel India, which will release in India in April 2024. “I will never ever forget playing the role of Honey because showing up was a major task,” she reveals of her time in recovery from her debilitating condition. “Every day was an effort. When I completed the first season of Citadel India, I realised that playing Honey has been the most fulfilling role of my life. I’m really proud of what I was able to do with that role, given the circumstances. I think that it could be my best work yet.”\n\nIt is this same attitude of steely determination that Samantha has always approached her projects with. In Shakuntalam (2023), her character needed to be adorned in floral jewellery, the kind that gave her an allergic reaction, but her need for perfection as an artist meant that she shot the whole day in those flowers and even had a floral-shaped mark imprinted on her hand for a month because of the reaction.\n\nThe controlled enthusiasm in her voice makes you want to go and rewatch her movies right away. There’s something magnetic about the way she says things in a low-pitched, yet clear tone, and in the way she holds your gaze when she talks to you. Her command over Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and English only amplifies her wheelhouse and makes her a reigning star in the pan-India entertainment biz; she has been recognised as the most popular Indian female actor in 2022 and 2023, as per Ormax Media’s annual reports.\n\nDress and Shoes: MACH & MACH\n\n“Jack Of All Trades”\n\nYet, Samantha tells us she has had to work twice as hard as others to master her skills and display them flawlessly on screen. “I am a Jack of all trades and master of none,” she laughs, before continuing thoughtfully, “While I work in Telugu, Hindi and Tamil films, I didn’t really grow up speaking these languages. I would have had an extra edge if I was able to think in those languages. I need to put in twice the hard work compared to someone who grew up speaking these languages, so it forces me to never get too relaxed in any scene, big or small. I’m always working hard before a scene and I hope that that shows,” she explains in a single breath. This commitment speaks once again to the fact that she loves her craft and has embraced the good and bad it has to offer.\n\nIn 2015, Samantha announced that she might quit the industry if she didn’t get to work on artistic projects. “My focus is always to put my heart and soul into bringing out a character that is honest and real,” she shares. “I don’t think so much about the business side of it. I think many of us make mistakes when we focus on getting the big numbers; we might not deliver the best quality work.”\n\nHer nuanced acting and her ability to wear her characters as second skin speak volumes about her talent, which explains why parts started to be written for her as she began picking author-backed roles. That move led to female-centric performances. Theri (2016), Mersal (2017), Rangastahlam (2018), Mahanati (2018), U-Turn (2018), Oh! Baby (2019), Super Deluxe (2019), Majili (2019), The Family Man 2 (2021) and Yashoda (2022) are all testament to her well-deserved and magnificent rise to stardom – all on her own terms. And it has come from more than just love for the art and her innate talent, it is also thanks to her ability to connect with audiences, transcending linguistic and cultural boundaries. “I have always stayed honest to the portrayal of a role and to the telling of a story that has real emotions,” she agrees. “It has always worked in my favour. I think, now more than ever, I’m really focused on telling good stories.”\n\nLace Corset and Pants: Munique\n\nThe Beauty And The Battle\n\nHer battle with myositis led Samantha to make the “hardest decision of her life” – to take a break from work. In retrospect, she thinks it was the best decision she has ever made, “because there’s no way I would have been able to continue working. The stress of work, coupled with the condition, is not the easiest thing to handle. I’m really glad that I gave myself time to recover; I had been working for 13 years straight.” She took a year off to travel, to heal, to be with her thoughts, to come back stronger.\n\nRight now, Samantha feels stronger and more beautiful than ever – which she credits to the strength and confidence that brews inside of her. This new-found centre of Samantha’s core comprises sisterhood, holistic living and self-love. The road within is often the hardest, Samantha admits, and does not hide her rite of passage through the darkness. “I’ve had my fair share of self-loathing and really low confidence, but I’ve always strived to grow as a person,” she discloses. “With that growth came a deeper understanding of my insecurities and self-loathing. I was able to heal by addressing them – not by trying to fix them from the outside, but by fixing the inner trauma that needed more healing than any external quick fix.”\n\nThe biggest lesson from everything she has gone through is gratitude. “Anyone who goes through a difficult phase always comes out stronger; always consider yourself lucky for the tough times,” she says, “You are going to come out of it with so much knowledge. Without going through these experiences, people can only dream of being as strong as you are. Be grateful for the lessons you learn, and keep in mind that God only gives us problems that we can handle,” she affirms.\n\nBreastplate: Misho; Trench Coat and Trousers: Hermès\n\nWhen Life Gives You Lemons…\n\nInternet trolls. Where do they not strike? During the period of her separation from her then-husband, actor Naga Chaitanya, leading up to their divorce and throughout her illness, there was a lot of chatter around everything she did. With her every move under scrutiny, Samantha was harrowed by the media. There are good and bad sides to everyone having an opinion, she states, but she strongly feels being an actor makes the experience worse. “Sometimes, being an actor makes your world very small and closed; there tends to be a group of ‘yes’ people around you who don’t usually tell you what is on their mind,” she explains. Social media allows Samantha a perspective on how the world perceives her. “I’m a big girl now; I know how to differentiate between slander and constructive criticism,” she asserts. “I keep my eyes and ears open for constructive criticism, which I think is important for me as an actor and as a human being.”\n\nDestiny’s Woman\n\nBorn on April 28, Samantha is a true Taurean in many ways, from her fondness for earthy tones – both in her wardrobe and her cosy home – to her head-on approach to anything. Taureans are intellectual, analytical, practical and grounded, and their ability to stay patient and fight back when irked is well known. But, while Taureans are not known to enjoy change, Samantha’s personality defies the stars. She strongly believes that change is the key to evolution.\n\nDress: Gaurav Gupta\n\nHer faith in a universal power is unwavering, but Samantha is open to changing her opinion if logical reasoning and empathy are brought into play. In an age when authenticity is more a filter than an acquired skill, Samantha claims that the authentic self should never be rigid. She believes that the true test of the self lies in a willingness to understand others and an openness to change with time. Rigidity in thought ticks her off. “I’m not rigid in my beliefs,” she points out. “I sometimes see how people judge others and say, ‘You said this before and now you’re changing your opinion.’ There’s nothing wrong with changing your opinion. We learn as we go along, and we should be allowed to change things that now seem wrong.” She further muses, “Even the strongest, the brightest, of us all succumb to certain ideas of success, certain ideas of how a ‘good woman’ should be, certain ideas of respectable choices. At the end of the day, you have to live with yourself.” she says. Whether you have a little white house or a comfortable mansion in Jubilee Hills, if the person you’ve become doesn’t make you happy, don’t settle. “Make decisions not based on societal conditioning, but on what you truly want for yourself.” This is something Samantha would tell her younger self today. We all should too.\n\nPhotographs: Taras Taraporvala\n\nStyling: Mohit Rai\n\nArt direction: Bendi Vishan\n\nMakeup: Avni Rambhia\n\nHair: Rohit Bhatkar\n\nStyling Assistance: Tarang Agarwal, Ruchi Krishna, Shubhi Kumar\n\nVideography: Abhishek Trivedi\n\nHospitality Partner: Chholay\n\nAlso Read: Life As She Knows It"
