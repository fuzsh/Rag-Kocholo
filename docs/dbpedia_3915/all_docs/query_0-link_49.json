        "text": "Sillunu Oru Kaadhal is a 2006 Tamil romance film directed by N. Krishna. It starred Suriya, Jyothika and Bhumika Chawla in pivotal roles, while Shriya Sharma, Sukanya, Vadivelu and Santhanam played other pivotal roles. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by A. R. Rahman, with lyrics by the Indian poet Vaali; while cinematography for the film was handled by R. D. Rajasekhar and editing was handled by Anthony. The film was released on 8 September 2006, three days before the marriage of Suriya and Jyothika.It grossed around 33.4 crore at box office.The film was an \"Average hit\" in spite of a decent opening.\n\nMouna Ragam is a 1986 Indian Tamil romantic drama film written and directed by Mani Ratnam, and produced by G. Venkateswaran. The film narrates the life of Divya Chandramouli, who is robbed of her carefree existence when she reluctantly marries Chandrakumar. Divya does not wish for a married life due to her grief over her former lover, Manohar, being shot to death. The rest of the story follows Divya's inner conflict between holding on to her past or coming to terms with the present and uniting with Chandrakumar. Mouna Ragam's development began when Ratnam wrote a short story titled Divya, while he was making his debut film Pallavi Anu Pallavi. As the script developed he renamed it. He did not plan to film until he finished writing the story, but he could not start actual production on it until after his fourth film, Idaya Kovil, was released. Mouna Ragam was mostly filmed in Chennai; additional filming took place in Delhi and Agra. The soundtrack album and background score were composed by Ilaiyaraaja, cinematography was handled by P. C. Sreeram, and the art director was Thotta Tharani. The length of the film was 3,987 metres.\n\nVinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa is a 2010 Tamil romantic drama film directed and written by Gautham Vasudev Menon, featuring Silambarasan and Trisha Krishnan in the lead roles. The film, distributed by Udhayanidhi Stalin, features a successful soundtrack composed by A. R. Rahman, cinematography by Manoj Paramahamsa and editing by Anthony Gonsalves. The story was simultaneously shot and released by Gautham in Telugu as Ye Maaya Chesave, starring Naga Chaitanya and Samantha Ruth Prabhu, however, with a different cast and climax. Launched by a wave of publicity posters with no details about the cast and crew, Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa began its initial run in February 2009. Shooting continued through 2009, with the film garnering significant media interest, through schedules in Malta and the United States. Before release, it became the first Tamil project to have a music soundtrack premiere outside of India, with a successful launch at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts in London. Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa explores the complicated relationship between a Hindu Tamil assistant director, Karthik, and a Syrian Christian Malayali girl, Jessie Thekekuttu."
