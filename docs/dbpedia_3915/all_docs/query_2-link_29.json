These themes include coming-of-age, class and cultural conflicts, the significance of inclusion and ambition, the power of storytelling, the transformative nature of art, and, consistently, the splendor of rebellion.

Animal showcases various forms of violence, including emotional, psychological, sexual, and physical. The film features Ranbir Kapoor, Bobby Deol, Rashmika Mandanna, and Anil Kapoor.

Earlier, he successfully portrayed an average, clumsy man in Zara Hatke Zara Bachke. Now, he transforms into the formidable hero in his latest film, Sam Bahadur. Vicky embodies the character with light eyes, a distinct posture, and a powerful speaking style, marked by dramatic pauses. However, the film's writing limits his portrayal, focusing more on external traits and lacking depth in showing the character's internal complexities. #vickykaushal #sambahadur #moviereview Visit us at http://filmcompanion.in Have you subscribed to Film Companion yet?

His direction is especially commendable with the debutant cast, prominently featuring Alizeh. For those who haven't experienced Bad Genius, Farrey provides a captivating series of twists and turns. The film has been co-produced by Alizeh's parents, Alvira Khan Agnihotri and Atul Agnihotri, along with her superstar uncle Salman Khan.\n\nVisit us at http://filmcompanion.in Have you subscribed to Film Companion yet?

Director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat plunges us into the world of four ruthless modern-day dakus in the Chambal. They're sadistic psychopaths who revel in violence, and when they kidnap a young girl, it's chilling to watch. It's so gripping that I almost didn't want to continue watching, and that's a compliment. #moviereview #filmcompanion #tarasutaria Visit us at http://filmcompanion.in Have you subscribed to Film Companion yet?

It's the weakest installment in both the trilogy and the entire franchise. These films should function like a giant slot machine, consistently delivering dopamine hits at regular intervals, yet this one falls short.

The film relies heavily on the unbridled energy, strong comic timing, and complete lack of vanity of its lead, Bhumi Pednekar.

Because this film, based on a story by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari and written by Nitesh, Piyush Gupta, Nikhil Mehrotra, and Shreyas Jain, definitely requires an open mind. Warning: this review includes spoilers.\n\nAt 61, Tom Cruise is so determined to make us happy that he’s willing to risk his life for it. And here’s the thing – he delivers.

The end twist, though far-fetched, is wicked. And the set-up for a sequel is even more delicious. I can’t wait to see what these characters do next. The problem is the material before we get to this point. It’s an undercooked slog. To know more about the film, watch the full movie review by Anupama Chopra on Reviews and More by Film Companion.\n\nTarla’s story is fascinating because this stratospheric culinary stardom wasn’t planned. To know more about the movie, watch the full review by Anupama Chopra on Reviews and More by Film Companion. It stars Huma Qureshi, Sharib Hashmi, and Purnendu Bhattacharya.\n\nTo get to the meat and emotion of Satyaprem ki Katha starring Kartik Aaryan and Kiara Advani, you have to plow through a first half brimming with sparkly dance sequences, jokes that don’t land, and that stereotypical portrayal of the Gujarati community that Hindi cinema dishes out often. To know more about the film, listen to the full review by Anupama Chopra here.\n\nThe second edition of the Lust Stories anthology isn’t, strictly speaking, just about lust.
