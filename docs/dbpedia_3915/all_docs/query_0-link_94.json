        "text": "Saifeena, the 2nd most dreaded pair after Abhiwarya returns to torture the audience after a not-so-great KURBAAN. Unfortunately for me, the film looked outright tepid, it makes Don 2 look so much boss.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, the film itself was decent, but coming from Sriram Raghavan who made the everlasting “JOHNNY GADHAAR” is too hard to follow. Songs come at random (personally, I didn’t mind “I’ll do the talking tonight” since we weren’t force to stare of Mallika Haydon’s abs the whole time and played throughout the background, so I was satisfied) but the melodious Raabta was placed in a rather funny situation, yet didn’t seem so inappropriate.\n\nThe film shuttles between a Bond and a Bourne film. At some point, I was comforted by the witty liners by Saif (Forget SRK being top contender for Gautham Menon’s “Vettaiyaadu Vilayaadu” Hindi remake, Saif can handle it like a pro.) Generally, Saif carries the film on his shoulders and he does it with ease. Out of the 3 heroines, 2 of them are ho-hum and Kareena is strictly average. Not sure why she puts up the same KURBAAN'ish caricature AGAIN. Irony is that (for those that have seen KURBAAN), the opposite happens. The climax felt lazy, but here’s hoping that Don and Vinod clash. With Raghavan and Akthar on board for a crossover, I’d pay big bucks to see that happen. In fact, why not tie it up with Don 3? But I did love the old-school treatment (note the RD Burman BGM placements throughout the film.)\n\nBig Swag and Miss, this Vinod. Maybe not stirring enough."
