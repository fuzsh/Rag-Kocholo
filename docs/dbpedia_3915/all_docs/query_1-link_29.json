        "text": "NEP has created much hype before the release with its first content of great maestro music director Ilayaraja share the movie space and most stylish director Gautham Vasudev Menon. I would like to share about good things first; dialogues are as usual awesome - ‘heights of intelligence’, then comes Santhanam’s comedy which made audience enjoy the film.\n\nMost of the music portions are average and irrelevant to this urban style movie which spoils the essence of it, some of the music portions are average which could have been much better. I feel Jiiva & Samantha are not good choice of lead casting because they haven’t reached even 10% of ‘Surya Jyothika’ or ‘Simbhu Trisha’ of KK & VTV in terms of attitude, expressions, chemistry, dialogue delivery, acting etc.Story of the movie doesn't have any X factor it’s a mere reflection of modern high class lovers and so it is not engaging. Cinematography and Editing are good but more than this not required this kind of film. Screenplay could have been much better so that NEP would have won many hearts in theater.Overall NEP is just an average movie and it might have come up well if it hadn't created big hype.\n\nGiri Yadav\n\ngiridharan.v003@gmail.com"
