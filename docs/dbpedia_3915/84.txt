Gautham Menon met Jiiva to discuss a potential collaboration in May 2011 for his next venture after the Hindi remake of Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa.[4] Menon decided to use Jiiva in the Tamil version of a bilingual film he was set to make featuring Ram and Samantha, and Menon's "regular crew" of music composer A. R. Rahman, film editor Anthony and cinematographer Manoj Paramahamsa were all a part of the film.[5][6] The film is being in Telugu as Nithya, while a Hindi version featuring Aditya Roy Kapoor and Samantha is also being simultaneously made.[7][8][9] Initial suggestions indicated that the film was also set to be titled Nithya, after Samantha's character in the film, but this turned out to be untrue.[10] The title was revealed through the first publicity posters to be Neethaane En Ponvasantham, inspired by a song from the 1982 film Ninaivellam Nithya starring Karthik.[11] An official announcement was made by the producers of the film, RS Infotainment, that a photo shoot was planned in August and the film would also shoot portions across the United Kingdom.[12] Jiiva had to lose weight for the film and had to undertake diet regimens and work out sessions to get in shape for the character. Furthermore it was revealed that he would sport three different looks in the film as the film encompasses 15 years.[13] Ravi Raghavendra and Anupama Kumar were added to the cast to play Jiiva's parents, while Santhanam was also chosen to play an important role in the film.[14]
