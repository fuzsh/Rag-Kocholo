        "text": "Brimming with local charm.\n\nAs part of our Portuguese road trip, we chose to base ourselves in the ancient city of Guimarães for a couple of nights.\n\nAnd what a fantastic choice it was.\n\nI was unaware before planning our stay at Guimarães that this historical city was the first capital of Portugal in the 12th century. It is widely believed that Portugal's first King, Afonso Henriques, was born there.\n\nDid you know?\n\nThat the Historic Centre of Guimarães has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2001. It was also the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\n\nGo with the flow\n\nWhat I particularly enjoyed about Guimarães, was that although this small city drew plenty of visitors to discover the ancient streets and architecture, it also still had a local feel.\n\nFamilies playing in the squares, friends catching up and enjoying an afternoon coffee together. A general atmosphere of day to day living.\n\nA reference guide\n\nOur recent new found love is Portugal, it is such a beautiful country. While planning our trip, I used the DK Eyewitness books. I find them extremely informative, easy to follow and the pictures and maps tempt you into discovering more.\n\nWe used a previous version of this book to plan our north to south Portuguese road trip, now you can grab the revised copy.\n\nWhat does it have to offer?\n\nOk, so I can hear you saying, well, why did you choose Guimarães? That’s so easy to answer when you see what’s lying amongst the charming cobbled streets.\n\nI’m going to start at the Palace of the Dukes, a medieval estate that was first occupied by the Dukes of Braganza from 1422.\n\nIt’s had a few different residents, some adding their own mark.\n\nHowever, during the 16th century it remained unoccupied and fell into considerable disrepair until the 20th century.\n\nIn 1910, it became a National Monument, extensive restoration was carried out to return it to its former glory.\n\nCastelo\n\nJust beyond the Palace is the Castle of Guimarães, a medieval castle built during the 10th century, to defend the monastery against attacks.\n\nThe castle had been through a number of changes and nearly demolished in the 19th century, and like the Palace of Dukes became a National Monument in 1910 and restored during the early 20th century.\n\nNestled between these two icons of the town is St. Michaels church. Built during the same era as the castle and served as a Royal chapel.\n\nWhy not?\n\nStart creating your own Portuguese adventure and discover its historical colourful towns and cities for yourself, easyJet & British Airways are just a couple of options.\n\nAdorable Squares\n\nWhat I especially love about Portugal and I found this when visiting Lisbon, were its beautiful praças (squares to you and me, although praça sounds better I think).\n\nWith their distinct black and white cobbles on the ground, smoothed around the edges, through years of wandering feet.\n\nHidden around so many corners, take a stroll through the medieval lanes and search out Largo da Oliveira & Praça de Santiago. Particularly of an evening when they are illuminated.\n\nMixture of time\n\nIn the medieval square of Largo da Oliveira, you’ll see the arched Padrão do Salado. A Gothic monument to commemorate the Battle of Salado.\n\nHeading off in any direction from here and the charming lanes take you through arches and courtyards waiting to be discovered.\n\nWhat you initially notice within Guimarães is the incredible amount of ornately tiled buildings, with lovely balconies and decorated iron verandas.\n\nGuimarães was once a walled city, and evidence of this can be found along Ave. Alberto Sampaio.\n\nTempted to?\n\nDiscover more of historic Portugal and tour its picturesque countryside or even head south to the Algarve coastline. You can do it all on a road trip, Rental Cars searches multiple well-known car hire brands and discovers the deals that suit you the best.\n\nA treat around every corner\n\nStrolling further south along this Avenue and you’ll be greeted by the stunning Largo Republica do Brasil with Nossa Senhora da Consolação e dos Santos Passos Church, in the background.\n\nThis was one of my favourites views in Guimarães.\n\nThe old road to Porto\n\nRua D. João I, during the Middle Ages was the road to take to Porto.\n\nAlong its narrow street you can still see the old houses with their wooden balustrades and facades.\n\nNear the bottom of the road, you’ll discover 16th Century monument to D. João I.\n\nPorto is only 57km/35 miles away but would have taken considerably longer to reach in the Middle Ages than the 45 minutes it takes today.\n\nTanneries\n\nAn interesting part of Guimarães that we wandered around was the once flourishing leather district in Couros (which means leather in English).\n\nYou can see the old tanneries straddling the river and wander around the stone dying baths.\n\nLocal tipple\n\nNow as we are in the Minho region of Portugal we had to sample the local tipple of Vinho Verde. I know it’s a hard task, but someone has to do it.\n\nOK, so I let Gary have a glass as well.\n\nAs we were heading back on our second night, we stumbled upon a local bar and thought let’s give it a try. The staff were so friendly and introduced us to the local chilled red Vinho Verde, which apparently is drunk out of mugs.\n\n(The last time we were served red wine in a mug, it was warm and we was in Germany - Why not check out 'Tipples on a German Christmas Market'?)\n\nWe found the local wines to be really reasonable in Guimarães, regardless if you are sitting in the main squares or a local bar, they were around €2 a glass or €7.5 a bottle.\n\nHave You?\n\nEnjoyed the local delicacies of Minho and strolled the Medieval streets of Guimarães, we’d love to know what you enjoyed?\n\nWhere we ate\n\nOur second night in Guimarães was Liberation Day, the town was bustling with families enjoying the celebrations and listening to live bands.\n\nWe couldn’t resist sitting outside Pregaria de Guimarães and enjoying one of their many varieties of steak sandwich – soooo tasty.\n\nWhere we stayed\n\nOur accommodation for the two nights we were in Guimarães, was at Casa Dos Pombais. This old manor house was just on the edge of the old town.\n\nPerhaps an unusual place to stay but it had great parking was very reasonably priced.\n\nBizarrely there were swans in their gardens as well as tasty orange trees.\n\nWould you like a little more?\n\nWe have created a little YouTube video of Guimarães\n\nWhy not subscribe to our channel and get the latest clips as we post them?\n\nInspired to visit Guimarães?\n\nIt’s a wonderful little city and a fantastic place to base yourselves to tour the region.\n\nWhy not checkout the latest deals on Booking.Com?\n\n(Why not Pin It for Later?)\n\nUnable to locate Global Block : 59232"
