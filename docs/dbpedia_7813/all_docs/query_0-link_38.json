My theme is the daring and renown of the Portuguese, to whom Neptune and Mars alike give homage.”\n\nLuis de Camoes - Lusiads\n\nPortugal is the oldest nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe, its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since prehistoric times. It was inhabited by pre-celts and Celtic peoples, visited by\n\nPhoenicians, Carthaginians, Ancient Greeks and ruled by the Romans, who were followed by the invasions of the Suebi and Visigothic Germanic peoples.\n\nAfter the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors, most of its territory was part of Al-Andalus. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian Reconquista.\n\nFounded in 868, the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of São Mamede.(1128). The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique (1139), and independence from León was recognized by the Treaty of Zamora. (1143).\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal established the first global maritime and commercial empire, becoming one of the world’s major economic, political and military powers.\n\nDuring this period, today referred to as the Age of Discovery, Portuguese explorers pioneered maritime exploration.\n\nDuring this time Portugal monopolized the spice trade, divided the world into hemispheres of dominion with Castile, and the empire expanded with military campaigns in Asia.\n\nDisclaimer: balanced bonus and percentages are not my area of expertise, suggestions welcome\n\nPortugal:\n\nCivs Bonus\n\nFortified Town Center: Town centre has higher HP and a defensive fortification.\n\nPortolan Charts: Ships and Scouts have 30% line of sight increased.\n\nFishing Boats have 10% gathering rate increased.\n\nFeitoria: Can build a feitoria add on to neutral trade posts from the castle age (powerfull defensive building with weapons emplacement) denying acess to enemy faction traders until the building is destroyed.\n\nMaritime Insurance: Receives 25% back of resources spent per sunk ship.\n\nMatchlock Arquebus: Gunpowder units have +x% of range.\n\nInfluence system:\n\nFirst Global Empire\n\nIncreased gold generated from trade posts by 50%.\n\nUnique units:\n\nEspingardeiros\n\nThese handgunners were a portuguese military squad whose emergence is noted during the second quarter of the fifteenth century. They obtained a considerable representation in the king’s army becoming one of the military corps that composed it.\n\nCaravel\n\nThe caravel is a small highly-maneuverable sailing ship developed in the 15th century by the Portuguese to explore along the West African coast and into the Atlantic Ocean. The lateen sails gave it speed and the capacity for sailing windward beating.\n\nCaravels were used by the Portuguese for the oceanic exploration voyages during the 15th and the 16th centuries, during the Age of Discovery.\n\nGrand Carrack\n\nPrecursor to the great galleon of later centuries, the Grande Carrack is a superior version of the Carrack, used in the late 15th century and early 16th century.\n\nThe Portuguese carracks were usually very large ships for their time, often over 1000 tons.\n\n(The Grand Carrack should double as transport ship, allowing the Portuguese player to mimic the combined arms amphibian assaults used on the conquest of fortresses at Morocco and East Asia.)\n\nAdventurers\n\nFrom the mid-15th century onwards, the lower and middle-ranking leadership of Portuguese expeditions and of the resulting overseas outposts were the fidalgos – gentlemen descended from the old knightly class.\n\nFidalgos, who were nobles, clad head to toe in an expensive full set of armour, always at the top commanding positions, and also formed the veritable “spearhead” of assaults. Most notably, they wielded some scary two-handed swords the Portuguese called montante.\n\nFortified Town Center Trains Leader Unit (Fidalgo: Infantry Greatsword unit, offensive aura ability.\n\n(“Hero” unit)\n\nUnique Techs:\n\nForal:\n\nIncreases farm yield in the TC area of Influence (Feudal)\n\nConto Crossbowmen:\n\nIncreases Crossbowmen damage (castle age)\n\nLateen Sails (Castle age)\n\nIncreased 20% ship speed.\n\nReinforced Decks (Imperial age)\n\nUnlocks cannons on Caravels\n\nIncreases cannon damage by 10%\n\nOrdenancas\n\nUnlocks Halberd weapon for Elite Spearman (Imperial Age) bonus vs infantry.\n\nUnique Building: Feitoria\n\nStrong defensive building with cannons that can be built on neutral markets.

The military orders provided much needed Lances for campaigns, as well the rich towns people that could afford horses, weapons and armour.\n\nMilitary Orders also contributed for the conquest and defence of the land and large swaths of land were granted to them to help repopulate during the Reconquista.\n\nFrom castle age Portugal focus on trade bonuses and professional men at arms representing the start of the Portuguese Expansion into North Africa and the rest of the world. Militar orders role eventually diminished as Portugal tactics shifted from Cavalry to Infantry at the turn of the 15th to 16th century.\n\nDue to limited human resources Portugal adopted a restricted model of occupation, where forts would be used to defend surrounding lands, and hold out for reinforcements.\n\nPortugal should focus on Naval and Gunpowder tech, with elite Ordenancas (Halberdiers) and Aventureiros (Greatswords) and Espingardeiros (Arquebus).\n\nColonial Forts, smaller and cheaper, provide the much needed map control for the player, that can produce villagers albeit at a slower pace.\n\nGarrisoning ranged units on it improves their defensive capabilities.\n\nPortugal was never a populous country so defend your villagers.\n\nWith the change of infantry tactics (from the swiss and italian wars) and campaigns overseas that often included disembarking from boats where horses weren’t used, having the option to embark/ disembark carracks a port player can mimic the shock and awe amphibian warfare style, where they would disembark under the cover of ship cannon fire to storm enemy positions, that the Portuguese historically did across at Morocco and Asia.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/329096636_The_Portuguese_Art_of_War_in_Northern_Morocco_during_the_15th_Century\n\nde Brito, P. (2008). Knights, Squires and Foot Soldiers in Portugal during the Sixteenth-Century Military Revolution. Mediterranean Studies, 17, 118–147. http://www.jstor.org/stable/41167395\n\n![8d73c-680024_orig|600x402]\n\nSome eye candy in no particular order:\n\nThe War Hat in Portugal\n\nWar hats are, along with sallets, the most popular type of helmet worn in 15th century Portugal. Municipal and royal ordinances are filled with ‘gibanetes com (…) capacetes com suas babeiras’ [10] required of those deemed wealthy enough to serve with them. It’s easy to understand why, given their low cost but also, and more importantly, their suitability to war in Northern Africa, the largest and most frequent theatre of war the Portuguese found themselves in.\n\nFor our period, there were two main types or styles of war hat worn in Portugal. The most common of these can be seen in the Pastrana Tapestries, in the Santa Clara Tryptich, and in many other late 15th and early 16th century Portuguese works of art: it consists of a plain skull, drawn to a point (a central apex), with either a very subtle medial ridge or no ridge at all , and a medium-to-shortish brim angled rather close to the head – what I shall refer to as a barreta. The brims are either softly keeled or often straight all along the circumference of the helmet, with no ridge even if the skull has one.\n\nThe second type of war hat commonly found in Portugal was the capacete (strictu sensu , i.e. the Iberian capacete ), which the Portuguese were almost as fond of as the other Iberian kingdoms. Some of the only surviving late 15th century Portuguese helmets are capacetes , including Duarte de Almeida’s, [11] and a capacete and bevor in Lisbon’s Military Museum (stamped with the crow’s foot mark of Calatayud armourers) [12]. Unlike war hats, capacetes weren’t normally covered with fabric (if ever). Decoratively, they were often limited to a metal band around the base of the skull (usually brass, plain or gilded) or, in some more extravagant examples, appliqués to the brim [13]. Capacete crests tended towards the small side, in keeping with their subtle stalks [14]. Additionaly, I could find no examples of capacetes fitted with ‘pangolin tails’, which their longer brims with pronounced rear keel might have precluded.\n\nSource:"
