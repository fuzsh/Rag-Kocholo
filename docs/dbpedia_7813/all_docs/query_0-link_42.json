Access synthesized Country Profiles to gain deeper insights into climate risks and adaptation actions. Disclaimer\n\nNEW! Please check out the introductory video for the CCKP\n\nIn an effort to serve as a 'one stop shop' for climate-related information, data, and tools, the World Bank created the Climate Change Knowledge Portal (or CCKP). The Portal provides an online tool for access to comprehensive global, regional, and country data related to climate change and development."
