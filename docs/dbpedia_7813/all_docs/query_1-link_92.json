        "text": "Tomar, a city in the heart of Portugal, encapsulates two pillars of Portuguese culture: amazing food and incredible history. We’re taking an Insightful dive into this medieval town, looking at its unique delicacies, local restaurants and rich historical heritage. With the help of a Local Expert, we’ll explore Tomar’s fascinating legacy and why it offers an authentic slice of traditional Portuguese life.\n\nTomar features on Insightful, the travel trivia quiz focusing on the world’s most fascinating destinations. Test your knowledge against leading travel experts for the chance to win a fabulous prize.\n\nSweet Treats\n\nLike the rest of Portugal, Tomar has a long tradition of convent-inspired confectionary. After all, even the country’s national dessert – the pastel de nata – was created in a Lisbon Monastery. Similarly, the nuns of Tomar’s incredible Convent of Christ created their own special treats. Look out for “Beija-me depressa” (translated as “kiss me quickly”), which you can only get from one shop in Tomar: Estrelas de Tomar. Make sure to also try the the local “Queijinhos doces” or “sweet cheeses”, made from almonds, eggs, and sugar.\n\nThe standout delicacy has to be “Fatias de Tomar” – also known as “China slices” or Tomar slices. Like many other convent desserts, the nuns of the Convent would use egg whites to starch and iron clothing. Thus, they needed something to do with all the remaining egg yolk. That created many of the Portuguese treats we know today, including Fatias de Tomar. These were cooked in unique “chimney pots”, and were reportedly the favored dessert of the local friars. You must try these treats upon a visit to Tomar, smiling with glee with every glorious bite. One must imagine the fascinating characters, from Templars to medieval friars, who centuries ago would wear the very same smiles after each heavenly bite.\n\nConvent of Christ\n\nLet’s take a journey up to the Convent, where the delectable Fatias de Tomar were born. This incredible building is the city’s star attraction, built by and serving as the headquarters of the Order of the Knights Templar. To help navigate the Convent, we’re lucky enough to have Local Expert Sandra guide the way.\n\n‘Hello from the Convent of Christ in Tomar! I’m Sandra, a Local Expert, and I’m excited to share four exciting facts about this UNESCO World Heritage Site with you.\n\nDating back to the 12th century, the Convent served as the headquarters of the Knights Templar in Portugal and played a crucial role in the defence of the region during the Reconquista.\n\nSpanning over five centuries, the Convent’s architecture is a mesmerizing blend of Romanesque, Gothic, Manueline, Renaissance, Mannerist, and Baroque styles.\n\nInside the Convent, you’ll find the magnificent Charola – a 12th-century round church used for Templar ceremonies. Exquisite altarpiece paintings, murals, and wooden carvings adorn the walls.\n\nThe Janela do Capítulo Window on the west side of the Church is the pinnacle of Manueline architecture. Designed by Portuguese architect Diogo de Arruda, its nautical motifs vividly illustrate Portugal’s dominance of the seas in the 15th and 16th centuries.’\n\nChico Eias – One of the best traditional restaurants in Tomar. It’s just outside the center of the city and you’ll need a reservation. Expect huge portions, as well as the local pumpkin-hare delicacy.\n\nTaverna Antiqua – This is a themed restaurant that recreates the medieval time that Tomar comes from. As well as medieval-themed decoration and ambiance, you’ll find the menu itself is based off the few remaining records of medieval cuisine!\n\nCafé Paraíso – Founded just seven months and 15 days after the 1910 revolution in Portugal, Café Paraíso has been running for over 100 years. This family-owned business is a local institution, as much a part of the city’s identity as the Convent of Christ! There was a time when the café was the meeting spot for the elders of Tomar, where they’d gather to have a coffee and discuss important affairs. It’s truly a symbol of how small businesses can thrive, adding economic value while preserving cultural heritage.\n\nLocals say the coffeeshop ‘is a paradise in the morning, limbo in the afternoon, and a hell at night!’\n\nYou may also like: Nine of Portugal’s Most Beautiful Destinations"
