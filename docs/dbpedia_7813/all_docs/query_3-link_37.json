        "text": "According to the 1900 census, the population of the United States was then 76.3 million. Nearly 14 percent of the population—approximately 10.4 million people—was born outside of the United States. Drawn by America’s labor opportunities, immigrants came predominantly from Canada and Europe, migrating from countries such as Germany, Britain, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Russia.\n\nThe statistics gathered by the 1900 census were published in 1903 in an atlas that converted the census data into maps and charts. This map uses color gradation to indicate the population density of foreign-born inhabitants. Lighter areas have a lower percentage of immigrants while darker areas have a larger percentage of immigrants. Two charts compiled from census data accompany the map: the first provides the statistical breakdown of the foreign-born inhabitants of each state and territory in 1900, while the second chart indicates the immigrants’ country of birth.\n\nOverall, the map and the charts illustrate the diversity of the American population at the turn of the twentieth century.\n\nForeign-Born Population of the United States by State of Residence\n\nState or Territory\n\nTotal Population\n\nForeign Born Population\n\nPercentage of Population That Was Foreign Born\n\nAlabama\n\n1,828,697\n\n14,592\n\n0.8%\n\nAlaska\n\n63,592\n\n12,661\n\n19.9%\n\nArizona\n\n122,931\n\n24,233\n\n19.7%\n\nArkansas\n\n1,311,564\n\n14,289\n\n1.1%\n\nCalifornia\n\n1,485,053\n\n367,240\n\n24.7%\n\nColorado\n\n539,700\n\n91,155\n\n16.9%\n\nConnecticut\n\n908,420\n\n238,210\n\n26.2%\n\nDelaware\n\n184,735\n\n13,810\n\n7.5%\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\n278,718\n\n20,119\n\n7.2%\n\nFlorida\n\n528,542\n\n23,832\n\n4.5%\n\nGeorgia\n\n2,216,331\n\n12,403\n\n0.6%\n\nHawaii\n\n154,001\n\n90,780\n\n58.9%\n\nIdaho\n\n161,772\n\n24,604\n\n15.2%\n\nIllinois\n\n4,821,550\n\n966,747\n\n20.1%\n\nIndiana\n\n2,516,462\n\n142,121\n\n5.6%\n\nIndian Territory\n\n392,060\n\n4,858\n\n1.2%\n\nIowa\n\n2,231,853\n\n305,920\n\n13.7%\n\nKansas\n\n1,470,495\n\n126,685\n\n8.6%\n\nKentucky\n\n2,147,174\n\n50,249\n\n2.3%\n\nLouisiana\n\n1,381,625\n\n52,903\n\n3.8%\n\nMaine\n\n694,466\n\n93,330\n\n13.4%\n\nMaryland\n\n1,188,044\n\n93,934\n\n7.9%\n\nMassachusetts\n\n2,805,346\n\n846,324\n\n30.2%\n\nMichigan\n\n2,420,982\n\n541,653\n\n22.4%\n\nMinnesota\n\n1,751,394\n\n505,318\n\n28.9%\n\nMississippi\n\n1,551,270\n\n7,981\n\n0.5%\n\nMissouri\n\n3,106,665\n\n216,379\n\n7%\n\nMontana\n\n243,329\n\n67,067\n\n27.6%\n\nNebraska\n\n1,066,300\n\n177,347\n\n16.6%\n\nNevada\n\n42,335\n\n10,093\n\n23.8%\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n411,588\n\n88,107\n\n21.4%\n\nNew Jersey\n\n1,883,669\n\n431,884\n\n22.9%\n\nNew Mexico\n\n195,310\n\n13,625\n\n7%\n\nNew York\n\n7,268,894\n\n1,900,425\n\n26.1%\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n1,893,810\n\n4,492\n\n0.2%\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n319,146\n\n113,091\n\n35.4%\n\nOhio\n\n4,157,545\n\n458,734\n\n11%\n\nOklahoma\n\n398,331\n\n15,680\n\n3.9%\n\nOregon\n\n413,536\n\n65,748\n\n15.9%\n\nPennsylvania\n\n6,302,115\n\n985,250\n\n15.6%\n\nRhode Island\n\n428,556\n\n134,519\n\n31.4%\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n1,310,316\n\n5,528\n\n0.4%\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n401,570\n\n88,508\n\n22%\n\nTennessee\n\n2,020,616\n\n17,746\n\n0.9%\n\nTexas\n\n3,048,710\n\n179,357\n\n5.9%\n\nUtah\n\n276,749\n\n53,777\n\n19.4%\n\nVermont\n\n343,641\n\n44,747\n\n13%\n\nVirginia\n\n1,854,184\n\n19,461\n\n1%\n\nWashington\n\n518,103\n\n111,364\n\n21.5%\n\nWest Virginia\n\n958,800\n\n22,451\n\n2.3%\n\nWisconsin\n\n2,069,042\n\n515,971\n\n24.9%\n\nWyoming\n\n92,531\n\n17,415\n\n18.8%\n\nServicemen Stationed Oversees\n\n91,219\n\n15,368\n\n16.8%\n\nTotal\n\n76,273,387\n\n10,460,085\n\n13.7%\n\nCensus Reports Volume 1.
