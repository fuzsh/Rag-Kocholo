        "text": "Portugal - Culture, Etiquette and Business Practices\n\nWhat will you Learn?\n\nYou will gain an understanding of a number of key areas including:\n\nLanguage\n\nReligion and beliefs\n\nCulture and society\n\nSocial etiquette and customs\n\nBusiness culture and etiquette\n\nBandeira das Quinas (Flag of the quinas) - “Quina” being a Portuguese word meaning “a group of five”. Despite the fact that the colours of red and green had never constituted a major part of the national flag until 1910, they were present in several historical banners during important periods.\n\nPhoto taken in Costa da Caparica by Pedro Santos on Unsplash\n\nFacts and Statistics\n\nLocation: Southwestern Europe, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean, west of Spain\n\nCapital: Lisbon\n\nPopulation: 10+million (2019 est.)\n\nEthnic Make-up: homogeneous Mediterranean stock; citizens of black African descent who immigrated to mainland during decolonization number less than 100,000; since 1990 East Europeans have entered Portugal\n\nReligions: Roman Catholic 94%\n\nThe Portuguese Language\n\nThe 10-million population of Portugal speaks Portuguese, a Romance language which derived from Vulgar Latin.\n\nGalician and Mirandese, which are technically classed as separate languages, are spoken by a few thousand people in the north of the country, along the Spanish border.\n\nDowntown Lisbon by Louis Droege on Unsplash\n\nPortuguese Society & Culture\n\nThe Family\n\nThe family is the foundation of the social structure and forms the basis of stability.\n\nThe extended family is quite close.\n\nThe individual derives a social network and assistance from the family.\n\nLoyalty to the family comes before other social relationships, even business.\n\nNepotism is considered a good thing, since it implies that employing people one knows and trusts is of primary importance.\n\nFormality\n\nPortuguese are traditional and conservative.\n\nThey are a people who retain a sense of formality when dealing with each other, which is displayed in the form of extreme politeness.\n\nAppearances Matter\n\nIn Portuguese society appearance is very important, especially in the cities.\n\nPeople are fashion conscious and believe that clothes indicate social standing and success.\n\nThey take great pride in wearing good fabrics and clothes of the best standard they can afford.\n\nHierarchy\n\nPortugal is a culture that respects hierarchy.\n\nSociety and business are highly stratified and vertically structured.\n\nBoth the Catholic Church and the family structure emphasize hierarchical relationships.\n\nPeople respect authority and look to those above them for guidance and decision-making.\n\nRank is important, and those senior to you in rank must always be treated with respect.\n\nThis need to know who is in charge leads to an authoritarian approach to decision- making and problem solving.\n\nIn business, power and authority generally reside with one person who makes decisions with little concern about consensus building with their subordinates.\n\nThe Catholic Church, as with many other countries, has had a huge influence over the shaping of Portuguese culture and values.\n\nPhoto taken in Porto by Daniel Seßler on Unsplash\n\nEtiquette and Manners in Portugal\n\nMeeting & Greeting\n\nInitial greetings are reserved, yet polite and gracious.\n\nThe handshake accompanied by direct eye contact and the appropriate greeting for the time of day.\n\nOnce a personal relationship has developed, greetings become more personal: men may greet each other with a hug and a handshake and women kiss each other twice on the cheek starting with the right.\n\nTitles\n\nThe proper form of address is the honorific title 'senhor' and 'senhora' with the surname.\n\nAnyone with a university degree is referred to with the honorific title, plus 'doutour' or 'doutoura' ('doctor') with or without their surname.\n\nWait until invited before moving to a first-name basis.\n\nUse the formal rather than the informal case until your Portuguese friend suggests otherwise.\n\nGift Giving Etiquette\n\nIf you are invited to a Portuguese home for dinner, bring flowers, good quality chocolates or candy to the hostess.\n\nDo not bring wine unless you know which wines your hosts prefer.\n\nDo not give 13 flowers. The number is considered unlucky.\n\nDo not give lilies or chrysanthemums since they are used at funerals.\n\nDo not give red flowers since red is the symbol of the revolution.\n\nGifts are usually opened when received.\n\nDining Etiquette\n\nIf invited to a dinner arrive no more than 15 minutes after the stipulated time.\n\nYou may arrive between 30 minutes and one hour later than the stipulated time when invited to a party or other large social gathering.\n\nDress conservatively. There is little difference between business and social attire.\n\nDo not discuss business in social situations.\n\nIf you did not bring a gift to the hostess, send flowers the next day.\n\nTable manners are formal.\n\nRemain standing until invited to sit down. You may be shown to a particular seat.\n\nTable manners are Continental -- the fork is held in the left hand and the knife in the right while eating.\n\nDo not begin eating until the hostess says \"bom apetite\".\n\nDo not rest your elbows on the table, although your hands should be visible at all times.\n\nMost food is eaten with utensils, including fruit and cheese.\n\nKeep your napkin to the left of your plate while eating. Do not place the napkin in your lap. When you have finished eating, move your napkin to the right of your plate.\n\nIf you have not finished eating, cross your knife and fork on your plate with the fork over the knife.\n\nLeave some food on your plate when you have finished eating.\n\nIndicate you have finished eating by laying your knife and fork parallel on your plate, tines facing up, with the handles facing to the right.\n\nFresh Portuguese Egg Tarts (Pastéis de Nata) in Lisbon, captured by Alice Butenko on Unsplash\n\nPortuguese Business Culture and Etiquette\n\nBuilding Relationships & Communication\n\nThe Portuguese prefer to do business with those they feel comfortable with, which means those that they know they can trust.\n\nTherefore, it is advisable to have a mutual contact provide the initial introduction.\n\nExpect to invest a great deal of time developing the relationship.\n\nThe Portuguese prefer face-to-face meetings rather than written or telephonic communication, which are seen as too impersonal.\n\nRelationships are built with people, not companies.\n\nIf you change representatives or people on a negotiating team once negotiations have started, the relationship-building process will have to begin again.\n\nIt is important that you treat business colleagues with respect and not do anything to embarrass them.\n\nCommunication is formal and relies on strict rules of protocol.\n\nIf your Portuguese business colleagues have questions or want clarification during a presentation, they will wait until you have finished speaking and not interrupt.\n\nAlthough honest, the Portuguese do not volunteer information unless solicited, especially if remaining silent is in their best interest.\n\nAlthough the Portuguese are not emotive speakers and do not use hand gestures, they may be demonstrative when greeting friendsIf you tend to use hand gestures while speaking, you may wish to moderate your behaviour since it may incorrectly be viewed as overtly demonstrative.\n\nPortugal is a hierarchical culture that respects age and position.\n\nDefer to those in senior positions and maintain a sense of formality in written communication.\n\nDo not be concerned if your Portuguese colleagues fail to follow through on promises.\n\nThey have a more relaxed attitude towards time and do not see deadlines as crucial as people from many other cultures do.\n\nThey do not appreciate direct criticism, even if you consider it to be justified\n\nBusiness Meeting Etiquette\n\nAppointments are mandatory and should be made 1 to 2 weeks in advance.\n\nReconfirm the meeting a few days in advance.\n\nInitial correspondence should be written in Portuguese.\n\nSince most Portuguese take vacation during August, it is not an ideal time to try to schedule meetings. It is also best not to plan meetings during the week between Christmas and New Year.\n\nYou should arrive on time for meetings.\n\nIn many circles, 5 minutes late is considered on time.\n\nPunctuality displays respect for the person you are meeting. If you are kept waiting, it is important that you not appear irritated.\n\nPeople from the north are generally more punctual than those in the south.\n\nA fair amount of getting-to-know-you conversation may take place before the business conversation begins.\n\nAgendas serve as starting points for discussions; they do not serve as schedules.\n\nPresentations should be well thought-out, thorough, and backed up with charts and figures.\n\nDecisions are not reached at meetings.\n\nMaintain eye contact when speaking.\n\nMeetings may be interrupted.\n\nDo not remove your jacket unless your business associates do so.\n\nThe Portuguese can be quite 'touchy feely' even in formal settings as demonstrated here by Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho (2011-2015) when meeting Angela Merkel.\n\nPhoto by Herman Van Rompuy (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)\n\nNegotiating\n\nPortuguese put great importance on the character of the person with whom they do business, so they will take time to get to know you.\n\nWait for your Portuguese colleagues to bring up business. Never rush the relationship-building process.\n\nPortuguese are very thorough and detail-oriented.\n\nPortuguese prefer to do business for the long-term although at times they focus on short-term gains.\n\nBusiness is conducted slowly. You must not appear impatient.\n\nHave printed material available in both English and Portuguese.\n\nDo not use high-pressure sales tactics. Portuguese are offended by aggressive behaviour.\n\nPortuguese business is hierarchical. The highest-ranking person makes decisions.\n\nPortuguese negotiate with people - not companies. Do not change your negotiating team or you may have to start over from the beginning.\n\nContracts are respected.\n\nManagement\n\nRead our guide to Portuguese Management Culture for specific information on this topic."
