        "text": "List of the 64 new items of documentary heritage inscribed on the Memory of the World International Register in 2023.\n\n(Listed in the English alphabetical order of submitters)\n\nFirst Summit Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement Archives\n\nSubmitters: Algeria, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Serbia\n\nThe collection consists of 76 files of textual archives, 242 photographs, 1 audio archive, and 15 films. They document a purpose of exchanging ideas on international problems with a view to contributing more effectively to world peace, security and peaceful cooperation among peoples, freedom, equality and social justice for the promotion of prosperity, and narrowing the blocs’ antagonism. The First Summit Meeting of Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia initiated by Ghana, India, Indonesia, United Arab Republic, and Yugoslavia. The meeting signified the active role of the Third World Countries to reduce the world tensions, calling for the end of colonialism, imperialism, and racism, as well as the promotion of peaceful co-existence and world peace. During its 60 years of existence, the Movement has gathered are 120 countries, 17 observers, 10 international organizations –equal to 4,3 billion of people (57% of the world population), and 54,53 million km2 areas of the world.\n\nArchives of Yugoslavia\n\nCollection of Works of the Composer Komitas Vardapet\n\nSubmitter: Armenia\n\nKomitas (1869-1935) is a musicologist and composer who was one of the pioneers in the world to invent folkmusic as phenomenon. His activity outlined new paths in collecting and analyzing traditional music and involving them in music composition. In this regard, he had a significant impact on the activity of folk music collectors of the 20th century. Komitas created a new style of composition, which synthesized authentic folk and Christian church music with Western means of composition. His work has been a guide for many composers and his music is performed by famous world musicians independent of nationality or geographic location. The significance of this collection is therefore evident in not just the Armenian, but the regional, Middle Eastern, and universal music culture. The collection includes the survived original copies and manuscripts of (a) folk music collections, (b) compositional works, and (c) scientific research on music.\n\nKomitas Museum-Institute\n\nThe illuminated manuscripts of Charlemagne’s Court School\n\nSubmitters: Austria, France, Germany, Romania, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n\nThe illuminated manuscripts of the Court School of Charlemagne are amongst the preeminent highlights of medieval culture. The most important artists and scholars of the epoch gathered at Charlemagne's court and created there a \"Centre d'excellence\" of international standing and far-reaching influence. The magnificently illuminated codices draw upon examples of Roman, Byzantine and Insular art. Simultaneously, these led to the development of a new style characterized by great creativity and efficacy. At thetime of their creation, and to this day, these illuminated manuscripts of the Court School represent a shining pillar casting a bright light on the ideal of the political and cultural unity of the Carolingian empire. As imperial gifts, they were given to high-ranking dignitaries and important medieval cultural centres, such as Tours, Trier, Lorsch, Centula and Soissons. Thus, the work of the Court School had a formative influence on the entire epoch and cultural space.\n\nWissenschaftliche Bibliothek der Stadt Trier/Stadtarchiv\n\n\"Flower Book\" of Khurshidbanu Natavan – album of illustrated verses\n\nSubmitter: Azerbaijan\n\nKnown as the “Flower Book”, it is the only official poetry album, arising to date. This 227-page album was compiled in 1886. Khurshidbanu Natavan is one of the prominent representatives of 19th century Azerbaijani literature, (1832-1897), the last heir to the Karabakh Khanate, who made a significant contribution to the public life and cultural development of Azerbaijan. In the 19th century of Europe, female writers were forced to use male pseudonyms to publish their work, while Natavan chaired a literary council in a country in the Islamic East. Although women were given a high status in the family hierarchy in Azerbaijan, Natavan's personality was a phenomenon for Azerbaijan as a woman. The reason for this was that she was the only child of a noble family, had a perfect education, was the wife of Major-General of the Tsarist Russian Army Prince Khasay khan Usmiyev, and was closely acquainted with modern European culture.\n\nNigar Balakhanova\n\nDocuments on the history of the Hanse\n\nSubmitters: Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Poland\n\nFor over 600 years, the history of Northern Europe was shaped by a unique organization of merchants and towns: the Hanse. Uniting some 200 towns, its commercial realm extended to some 25 present-day European states. Bridging the chasms which yawned between different states, cultures and languages, the Hanse maintained, from the 12th to the 17th century, a commercial network reaching from Flanders to Novgorod and from Bergen (Norway) to Cracow. A surprising amount of the unity of today's Europe can be traced back to the contacts between individuals and regions engendered by the Hanse. The Hanse utilized its privileges to organize the exchange of products over immense distances, enabling people to acquire products and resources which they could not obtain locally. On the heels of the exchange of products followed cultural exchanges: language and architecture, the arts and the law.\n\nArchiv der Hansestadt Lübeck\n\nArchives of the International Solvay Conferences on Physics and Chemistry (1910-1962)\n\nSubmitters: Belgium, France\n\nThe archives bring to light the scientific internationalism organized at the beginning of the 20th century and the perpetuation of a tradition of international cooperation. The Solvay Conferences, a privileged meeting place for leading members of the scientific community, marked an era when the foundations of classical science were being challenged by the advent of quantum physics, the birth of the theory of relativity and the emergence of a new chemistry based on the exploration of the structure of the atom and chemical bonds. The collection is composed of the archives of the International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry (from the period 1910–1962) deposited at the Free University of Brussels (ULB) and the archives of Paul Langevin (section dedicated to the Solvay Conferences) kept at the École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI Paris) – PSL University.\n\nArchives, Patrimoine et Réserve précieuse\n\nFeminism, science and politics - Bertha Lutz’s legacy\n\nSubmitter: Brazil\n\nBertha Lutz (1894-1976) was Brazilian biologist, congresswoman, and feminist, and one of the founders of the Brazilian Federation for Women’s Progress (Federação Brasileira pelo Progresso Feminino). The organization was founded in 1922 that fought for equal rights between men and women, for women’s access to education and to the labor market, and contributed to the conquest of the women’s vote, guaranteed in the 1934 Constitution. These records offer possibilities for understanding the way in which movements in favor of women’s rights were organized and related from their countries of operation, especially in the decades of 1920, 1930 and 1940. They also attest to the involvement of activists and organizations in defense of women’s rights in broad issues such as disarmament and world peace.\n\nDocument and Information Center, Camara dos Deputados.

Their purpose: the total assimilation of Indigenous children into settler society. The Chief Justice of the Canadian Supreme Court ruled this Indigenous social erasure is a form of genocide. Generations of Indigenous children lost their languages, spiritual practices, and knowledge systems. Without action, Canada and the international community is confronted with the permanent loss of these Indigenous cultures and societies. In 2007, the Supreme Court created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to investigate the history and legacy of Canada’s residential school system. The TRC’s six-year investigation created a unique body of evidence: approximately four million historical documents and almost 7,000 Survivor testimonies recording the systemic social indoctrination of Indigenous children.\n\nNational Centre for Truth and Reconciliation\n\nProviding care in the New World: The Augustinian sisters of Canada, women of heart and commitment.\n\nSubmitter: Canada\n\nThis collection bears witness to the progress of the nursing profession in North America and its influence throughout the world. In 1639, the French Augustinian sisters, the first women missionaries in history, founded the first hospital north of Mexico in Quebec City, under the reign of Louis XIII, King of France. This community, which became Canadian, went on to establish a further eleven hospitals in Canada and contributed to the expansion of healthcare in various developing countries. Between 1639 and 2018, the Augustinian sisters produced and preserved nearly a linear kilometre of documents that tell the story of more than 1,800 women dedicated to caring for the poor and the sick. The Augustinian sisters innovated by drawing on the medicinal practices of the indigenous peoples and contributing to the development of scientific discoveries and best medical practices as the world went through epidemics, wars and political, social and religious transformations. By sharing their archives, the Augustinians of Canada are providing access to the history of the evolution of healthcare over a period of more than 375 years.\n\nFiducie du patrimoine culturel des Augustines, Canada\n\nThe four treatises of Tibetan Medicine\n\nSubmitter: China\n\nThe Four Treatises of Tibetan Medicine is divided into four parts: tsagyu(root Treatise), shegyu(explanatory Treatise), managagyu(treatise of oral instruction), and chimagyu(the last Treatise).

Today, it is the only surviving autograph manuscript of this seminal text and our sole insight into Montaigne at work. Together with Cervantes and Shakespeare, Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592) is one of the greatest writers of early modern Europe. In the humanist tradition, Montaigne inaugurated a new era in the history of ideas, calling into question the Eurocentric view of the world. He developed a new philosophy of nature responsive to the crises of his time (division within Christianity, annihilation of Amerindian peoples through brutal conquest, rise of the Ottoman Empire). He evolved a way of thinking in which self-examination came to be seen as characteristic of man, laying the foundations of our modern society.\n\nBordeaux Copy: Montaigne’s Essays annotated (1588-1592) by the author)\n\nSubmitter: France\n\nThe Bordeaux Copy is a copy of the 1588 edition of Montaigne’s Essays covered with annotations in the author’s own hand.

In addition to testimonies, studies and publications that bear traces of the emergence of the voices of the poorest in the public space, the collection contains archives of dialogues on poverty between countries and the latter’s invitation to ATD Fourth World to join them in their efforts against poverty. Initially between countries of the North, this dialogue spread across the world, starting with Africa, and particularly Burkina Faso in 1980. The collection also contains the archives of successive public events until 17 October 1987, when a commemorative stone was unveiled at the Human Rights Esplanade in Paris, in honour of the victims of poverty. The collection's end date is marked by the United Nations' 22 December 1992 recognition of 17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, which brings the poorest people into universal history (A/RES/47/196). This collection of universal value constitutes a source of knowledge that can help in imagining and building peaceful societies where no one is left behind.\n\nBernard Besson\n\n“Shoah”, by Claude Lanzmann, restored 35 mm negative; Audio Archive Witnesses to the History of Shoah, 200 hours\n\nSubmitters: France, Germany\n\nA film about the mass murder of six million Jews during World War II, “Shoah” was created by Claude Lanzmann over a period of twelve years. Filmed in the 1970s, it was the first ever collection of witness accounts after 30 years of almost total absence of testimony from the survivors. “Shoah” captures the testimonies of witnesses, perpetrators and victims, often filmed near the sites of the former death camps. The film is a major educational work that provides rigorous historical information and anchors it in the memory of a global audience.\n\nDominique Lanzmann\n\nThe lead tablets of the Dodona Oracle\n\nSubmitter: Greece\n\nThe lead tablets of Dodona are a unicum in the ancient Greek world dated fromthe 6th century BC to the mid-2nd century BC. They are small pieces of lead strips (measuring not more than ca. 13,20 cm long and 6,70 cm wide), on which questions were inscribed, addressed either only to Zeus or to him and Dione, his cult partner at Dodona. In total, more than 4,000 lead tablets have been discovered, scattered within the temenos of Dodona. The lead tablets give us a direct and unbiased access to the concerns of enquirers: marriage, divorce, birth and survival of children, travel, professional plans, health and healing, military service, purchase of slaves, manumission. The tablets do not only attest different dialects, but also different handwritings given the multitude of people that visited the oracle over the centuries. Due to the typological variety of the questions and the very diverse origins of the inquirers, the tablets are a set of finds that not only allows a unique insight into the cult practice of the Oracle but also offers instructive information about socio-historical and political contexts and backgrounds, as well as epigraphy and dialectology.\n\nEphorate of Antiquities of Ioannina - Hellenic Ministry of Culture - Archaeological Resources Fund\n\nRegisters identifying enslaved persons in the former French colonies (1666-1880)\n\nSubmitters: Haiti, France\n\nIn French colonial territories, slavery lasted until 1793 in the colony of Saint-Domingue (now Haiti) and until it was finally abolished in 1848 in the others. As civil status was denied to those who were enslaved, who were deemed to be property and instruments of production, little documentary trace was produced of their identities or lives. The regime of civil status and last names in place in France since the sixteenth century did not apply to them. There are, however, several sets of registers recording the major events in their lives, because of compulsory Catholic baptism and changes in the law when the era of slavery ended. This collection consists of the following registers: baptisms, marriages, and burials (later: births, marriages and deaths); emancipations; persons who were newly freed; identifying details or numbers (and census return sheets); fugitive announcements. These records are significant given a huge increase in demand for ancestry searches among the diasporas of people of African descent in the past 20 years.\n\nCollectivité territoriale de Guyane\n\nAbhinavagupta (940-1015 CE): Collection of Manuscripts of his works\n\nSubmitter: India\n\nThis collection comprises 248 Manuscripts of Abhinavagupta (CE 940-1015), an outstanding Indian thinker in the domain of philosophy, aesthetics, literary theory, performative art, music, tantra, yoga, and devotion who lived in Srinagar, Kashmir in the 10th century. Composed around 41 granthas(texts), the manuscripts document a knowledge culture whose intellectual and artistic influence once permeated Northeast Asia, Central Asia, and South Asia.

It conveyed by Sukarno, the first president of Indonesia and a nationalist leader who declared Indonesia’s independence, as well as a leading figure among Asian and African leaders during the decolonization period. The speech was recorded in textual, photograph, sound recording and film archives. In the speech, Sukarno outlined his conceptual thinking about nationalism, anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism, solidarity and social justice among nations, peaceful coexistence and disarmament policies, reconstruction/ reinforcement of UN, and Pancasila (the five basic principles) as an alternative ideology. By elaborating these concepts, Sukarno articulated the desire of the newly independent states to be recognized as equal member of the international society. Sukarno’s concept had also encouraged other countries in the world to be more active in creating world peace and equality, which was manifested in the Non-Aligned Movement in 1961.\n\nNational Archives of the Republic of Indonesia\n\nThe Hikayat Aceh – Three manuscripts on life in Aceh, Indonesia, in the 15th-17th century\n\nSubmitters: Indonesia, Netherlands\n\nThe Hikayat Aceh is a 17th century indigenous history of the former sultanate of Aceh, which is located on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra, Indonesia. Written in Malay in the Arabic script, it chronicles and eulogizes the Acehnese Sultan Iskandar Muda (1583-1636; reigned 1607-1636; national hero of Indonesia since 1993). The text contains many stories about life and customs in the Acehnese courts, relations with the outside world (including Portugal, China, and Turkey), internal rivalries, wars, and (Islamic) religion. It is a unique work using traditional Malay literary styles with a rich Persian influence full of diverse information and historical detail. The Hikayat Aceh is different from earlier court chronicles in the sense that it discusses the life of a single person. Although “Malay” in composition, the text represents an older hagiographic tradition fashioned mainly after Persian examples probably commissioned by Iskandar Muda’s daughter, Sultana Safiyyat al-Din Syah (r.1641–1675). The Hikayat Aceh is an indispensable tool for all interested in the history of Aceh and its exceptional political, cultural, and religious traits.\n\nNational Library of Indonesia\n\nThe Gramophone Discs and Papers of the EMI Archive Trust, 1897-1914\n\nSubmitter: International Association of Sound and Audiovisual Archives (IASA)\n\nThe Gramophone discs and papers of the EMI Archive Trust 1897 –1914 form an unparalleled collection in terms of scale, scope, richness and cultural depth, offering a substantial record of the world’s first reflection of itself in recorded sound, not only exemplifying culture as it sounded, but culture as it was listened to. The collection consists of approximately 116,000 virtually pristine sound recordings and over 100 metres of supporting paper assets documenting the birth of the global recording industry, and the technical innovation that set the template for the industry’s rapid expansion. The recordings encompass classical and popular music repertoires, urban and rural traditions as well as spoken word material. While the bulk of the material was recorded throughout Western and Central Europe, over 20,000 recordings document contemporary culture in the Arab States, Asia and Eastern Europe. They represent many cultures and groups not otherwise well documented, often prior to significant upheaval, including industrialisation, repression or genocide.\n\nEMI Archive Trust\n\nDocuments on Iran’s International Relations Under the Qajar Rule (1807-1925)\n\nSubmitter: Iran (Islamic Republic of)\n\nThe collection contains 107 documents from the correspondence of heads of states, kings, prominent political figures, leaders of ethnic and religious minorities with the Shahs of Iran during the 1807-1925 period, under the Qajar rule. These documents reflect part of the history of international relations in the modern world, during an especially sensitive historical period that left its permanent imprint on the political geography of the world, including on Iran. The documents include a variety of topics, including peace and friendship treaties, cultural relations, trade, as well as international events. During this period, many agreements and treaties with Iran were concluded by various European states and signed and sealed by such figures as Napoleon Bonaparte, George III, Nicholas I, and Queen Victoria. These documents embody the style of the official correspondence of the time. In addition to textual and content value, they also contain and exhibit formal, artistic, and aesthetic significance.\n\nThe Archives of Documents ( Ministry of Foreign Affairs-IR of Iran)\n\nDocuments of the Shaykh Safī-al-Dīn Ardabīlī Shrine (952 to 1926 CE)\n\nSubmitter: Iran (Islamic Republic of)\n\nThe document collection of the shrine of Shaykh Safī al-Dīn Ardabīlī (1253-1334 CE) is one of the best-known and most unique collections in the Muslim world due to the antiquity, number, and variety of the documents in it. Currently housed atthe National Museum of Iran, the collection contains 590 documents, most of which date back to the 13th and 14th centuries. They consist of royal decrees, administrative papers, legal records and contracts produced by Islamic courts and other public authorities in a great variety of languages, including Persian, Arabic, Mongolian, and Chinese, Uyghur Turkic. Offering unique and highly revealing documentary evidence about the broader Persianate world stretching from China to Anatolia, and from the steppes of South Russia to India, the documents shed a very important light on the dynamics of religious, ethnic, and cultural coexistence that characterized the multi-ethnic, multi-religious and cosmopolitan society of medieval and early modern Iran.\n\nIran National Museum\n\nApodissary fund of the ancient Neapolitan public banks (1573-1809)\n\nSubmitter: Italy\n\nThe Apodissary Fund of the ancient Neapolitan public banks, part of the Historical Archive founded in 1819, preserves numerous documents relating to eight public banks' activity in the city of Naples from the 16th to the beginning of the 19th century. The Apodissary Fund, which arrived intact to date, testifies the evolution in money circulation, passing from money to establishing the credit certificates. Thanks to the reasons of payment detailed on the credit certificates, the Apodissary Fund constitutes a source of information of extraordinary interest about the Modern Age, for the economic, credit, political, cultural, and artistic history, not only of the Kingdom of Naples but also of the European states and worldwide. The Apodissary Fund allows historical reconstructions of the Modern Age at the European level and beyond through the rich information related to the exchanges in banking activity.\n\nArchive & ilCartastorie, 2021\n\nCriminal Proceedings of the Vajont dam disaster\n\nSubmitter: Italy\n\nThe records onthe Criminal Proceedingsof the Vajont dam disaster (1963-1971, with acts from 1900) arean important example of complex documentation used to demonstrate human responsibility in the tragedy surrounding the landslide and flood on 9 October 1963. The disastercausedthe destruction of residential areas and facilities along with the death of 1910 people. The significance of the Vajont event was confirmed in 2008 when the UN classified it as the first of ten disasters caused by human and scientific error in the last 50 years. The fonds is property of the State Archives of L'Aquila and is conserved temporarily in the State Archives of Belluno. It comprises documents of the criminal proceedings from 1963 to 1971: 250 folders of legal acts (including those before 1900), as well as various non-paper materials that are inseparable annexes to the proceedings (rock samples, a model, seismic recordings, negatives and photographic plates, film footage). The Vajont Fonds is widely regarded as a source of study of great international importance, as evidenced by the rich and varied cultural and scientific literature produced in recent decades.\n\nState Archives of Belluno\n\nThe Monk Enchin Archives: A History of Japan-China Cultural Exchange\n\nSubmitter: Japan\n\nThe materials include primary sources that trace the life of the Japanese monk Enchin (814–891), who travelled to China to study Buddhism and seek spiritual enlightenment in the 9th century. The materials also include documentary heritage related to Japan-China cultural exchanges and the deepening significance of Buddhism and Buddhist faith in Japan at that time. The nominated materials are divided into four categories: official documents issued in China that illustrate the Tang legal system; official documents issued in Japan that illustrate the establishment of its own state system; documents that illustrate Buddhist exchanges between Japan and China; and documents that illustrate the practice of “patriarch worship” in Japanese Buddhism. Though the Tang dynasty established a vast empire that greatly impacted the East Asian world, very few of its records have survived to present day. Through the legacy of the monk Enchin, a wealth of historical documents from Japan and China have been preserved in their unaltered, original states, making the nominated materials a rare example not only in the history of religion, but also among archives globally.\n\nFuke Toshihiko, Representative Director, Religious Corporation, Onjō-ji Temple\n\nManuscript of the Kyrgyz epic \"Manas\" by the narrator Sagymbay Orozbakov\n\nSubmitter: Kyrgyzstan\n\nThe epic \"Manas\" traditionally delivered in an exclusively oral way and has been recognized as the national pride, identity and historical memory of the Kyrgyz people. The transcription of the epic “Manas”, made from 1922 to 1926, was the first specially planned and organized event in the country. The manuscript consists of 10 handwritten books. In a group of narrators, Sagymbay Orozbakov believed to be the best and identified as the “classical”. His version of the epic is still considered as the fullest and artily valuable. The transcription of the epic was significant and timely because it was the period of transition of the Kyrgyz people from a nomadic way of life to the settled, which posed a threat of disappearance of the oral transmitting of the epic heritage. Therefore, the transcription of the epic to paper was vital and necessary to transmit and to give the second breath of life to it in a book form.\n\nAbdyldazhan Akmataliev\n\nMisa Melayu MSS 6\n\nSubmitter: Malaysia\n\nMisa Melayu MSS 6 is a narration of the history ofthe ceremonial rules of the Perak Sultanate. It is the forerunner in the authorship tradition of manuscripts in the form of prose and poetry. The manuscript contains depictions of several historical events connected to the Perak society in the 18th century which leaves a profound impact on the art, culture as well as a remarkable thought in the tradition of Malay civilization. The narration was based on Raja Chulan's eyewitness assessment and views on Perak's genealogies, court ceremonials, succession of the throne, Malay customs, and diplomatic relations and trade with the Dutch (Vereenigde Oost-lndische Compagniei -V.O.C).\n\nNational Library of Malaysia\n\nThe archival collections on the Bienheureux Père Jacques Désiré Laval – The Apostle of Mauritius\n\nSubmitter: Mauritius\n\nThe records provide an overall insight into the sacrosanct mission of Père Laval, a unifying figure in the history of Mauritius who singlehandedly through his spiritual prowess, compassion and dedication became a soul saviour for the Mauritian population.

The monument consists of three stone inscriptions carved by the same people, in the same year. The inscriptions are amazing not only because oftheir clarity and the beauty of the clean lines of the letters but also how well they have been preserved to this day. The main inscription, dated 1624, is a poem carved on the smooth, vertical rock, which was composed by Prince Tsogtu. This poem is oftenconsidered by scholars to be the finest example of pre-Qing Mongolian poetry composed according to the canons of Buddhist poetry. The importance of the inscriptions is that they stood as a witness to a turbulent and dramatic time in the history of 17th century Mongolia, when Ligdan Khan, the last Great Khan of the Mongols, was desperately struggling to maintain unity among the Mongols as they faced the rising power of the Manchus.\n\nNational Library of Mongolia\n\nDDS: De Digitale Stad / The Digital City\n\nSubmitter: Netherlands\n\nOn January 15, 1994, De Digitale Stad (DDS, The Digital City) opened its virtual gates. It empowered users to be “citizens” or “netizens” of a digital environment and enter the then largely unknown world of the Internet. DDS imagined a community-driven, commons-based internet, far remote from today's internet whose operation is dictated by a small group of big tech companies.

It empowered users to be “citizens” or “netizens” of a digital environment and enter the then largely unknown world of the Internet. DDS imagined a community-driven, commons-based internet, far remote from today's internet whose operation is dictated by a small group of big tech companies.

It includes mostly slave, manumission and emancipation registers and civil registry documents of freed slaves. The records shed light on the state of compensation received by plantation owners after the abolition of slavery in the Dutch Caribbean in 1863. More specifically, they show the connections between the Dutch, French and British networks in the Caribbean, which formed part of the global network of slavery and slave trade. The documents provide insight into the ways in which slavery and the legal structure behind it shaped the lives of the enslaved people of the Dutch Caribbean as well as their descendants. It is thereby a unique collection of documents that gives us a better understanding of the mechanics behind one of the darkest periods in human history.\n\nDocumentary heritage of the enslaved people of the Dutch Caribbean and their descendants (1816-1969)\n\nSubmitters: Netherlands, Suriname (for Curaçao, Sint Maarten)\n\nThe collection consists of archives located in Suriname, Curaçao, St. Maarten, and the Netherlands.

The most evident one is that the men who concluded this journey were the first to make a complete lap around the globe. This voyage had a significant impact in humankind’s general knowledge, as it made it possible to grasp the vastness of South America and how wide the Pacific Ocean is, all of which paved the way to a new and more concrete notion of the Earth’s dimension. The documents show the preparation of the journey, the complementary relationship between the Portuguese and the Spanish, as well as the very first testimonies of these discoveries. In the aftermath of this journey, the theories espousing that the planet’s surface was mostly covered by land were overcome by what was then unveiled: the planet was in fact blue, with masses of land locked by a great ocean.\n\nCultural Heritage and Fine Arts, Ministry of Culture and Sports, Spain\n\nArchives of the April 19 Revolution\n\nSubmitter: Republic of Korea\n\nThe Archives of the April 19 Revolution refers to an extensive collection of documentary materials about the student-initiated, pro-democracy movement that erupted in the spring of 1960 in the Republic of Korea. The materials cover the backgrounds and developments of the revolution leading to the downfall of authoritarian President Syngman Rhee (In office 1948-1960) –from a student rally in the provincial city of Daegu on February 28 to large-scale demonstrations in Seoul on April 19 to oppose the rigging of the March 15 presidential election –as well as post-revolution, fact-finding efforts, punishments of those who were accountable and reparations for victims. The April 19 Revolution, initiated by high school students and joined by other students and adults, from 10-year-olds to those in their seventies, preceded postwar student activism, including the revolution of 1968 in Europe, the antiwar protests in the United States, and the student movement in Japan.\n\nCommittee for Memorialization and Inscription of the April 19 Revolution on the Memory of the World Register\n\nArchives of the Donghak Peasant Revolution\n\nSubmitter: Republic of Korea\n\nThe nominated heritage is a collection of 185 documents associated with the Donghak Peasant Movement. The Donghak movement was a popular uprising against both corruption in the ruling class and encroachment on Korea by foreign powers, demanding the establishment of a more just and equal society. Over the course of the movement, the Donghak army succeeded in establishing a cooperative governing unit known as a jipgangso through which corrupt officials could be punished and unfair government practices rectified. This unit of governance was a novel experiment in democracy with parallels rarely found anywhere in the world at the time. The Donghak movement paved the way for Korea to develop into a flourishing democracy. The nominated documents serve as a reservoir of memories testifying to the historical processes through which the public acted as a protagonist in history and impelled the course of events toward the achievement of universal values.\n\nDonghak Peasant Revolution Foundation (Research and Documentation Division)\n\nFyodor Dostoevsky: Handwritings and Notes\n\nSubmitter: Russian Federation\n\nSixteen handwritings of F.M. Dostoevsky have been presented for the consideration of UNESCO's Memory of the World Programme Committee. In 2021 the whole world celebrates 200 years since the birth of Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (1821–1881). F.M. Dostoevsky is a great Russian writer, whose works organically combine the realistic picture of social contrasts and a search for public and human harmony, subtle psychology, and humanism. It is difficult to overestimate the influence of F.M. Dostoevsky’s works on the whole world culture. The handwritings and notes of Dostoevsky are the most important source for researching his biography, philosophy, creation process, the history of his works, his contribution as an editor and essayist. The handwritings and notes contain plans and drafts of the novels Crime and Punishment (1865–1866), The Idiot (1860s –1868), Demons (1869–1872), The Adolescent (1874–1975), outlines of uncompleted works, journalistic and literary criticism articles, materials related to The Diary of a Writer, draft letters, diary notes, money calculations, personal notes, including those concerning his epileptic seizures, and drawings.

Inscribed in an impressive sandstone canyon in Saudi Arabia's AlUla County, the collection features nearly 300 valuable inscriptions created by the ancient Dadanite and Lihyanite civilizations, reflecting a variety of themes such as society, religion, rituals, agriculture, and memorials. As writing is a vital milestone in the development of mankind, marking the transition from pre-history to history, the significance of Jabal Ikmah’s inscriptions transcends its national and regional boundaries to the level of global importance. In particular to the evolution of languages and alphabets, Jabal Ikmah inscriptions played a crucial role in the development process of Old Arabiclanguages and dialects, during first millennium BCE. Its authenticity and integrity, both from the point of view of the information that the epigraphs and petroglyphs, preserve and convey about the societies of the last millennium before the common era, as well as the nature of the manifestations and the state of conservation of the site.\n\nMUNIRAH A. ALMUSHAWH\n\nRoyal Philanthropic Expedition of the Smallpox Vaccine, 1800-1820\n\nSubmitter: Spain\n\nThe Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition was a project of the Enlightenment,and its resulting documentation endorses the Enlightenment principles: the public good, the economic transformation and progress, advancements in science, research and practical application of knowledge, and philanthropy. This venture was a scientific expedition. The documentation shows the organizational capacity of the Administration to fight against smallpox, as well as to protect an important part of the population that lived in Spain, Central and South America, Texas (United States of America), the Philippines, and the Pacific, Macau (Portugal) and Guangzhou (China). These documents prove that the Expedition of the smallpox vaccine to America must be placed into the context of the European scientific progress.\n\nGeneral Director of Fine Arts, Ministry of Culture and Sports, Spain\n\nSimón Ruiz Archive (Medina del Campo, Spain)\n\nSubmitter: Spain\n\nThe Simón Ruiz Archive is the only case of a documentary collection of a Spanish merchant-banker from the 16th century that has survived to the present day, which makes it an essential reference in all studies on world trade for that period, given that at that time the Spanish Monarchy was one of the great economic powers of the world. Many of the major events are mentioned or referred to, at greater or lesser extent, in the documentation of this archive and, likewise, many of the leading figures of commerce and finance of the time are quoted in it. Its commercial collections consist of 184 account books, more than 58,000 commercial letters delivered to hundreds of cities –mainly in Europe and the New World –28,000 bills of exchange sent to 45 European financial centres, 200 listini or listings with international currency exchange rates, etc.\n\nFundación Museo de las Ferias\n\nMahavamsa, the Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka (covering the period 6th century BCE to 1815 CE)\n\nSubmitter: Sri Lanka\n\nOne of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts, the Mahavamsa is the first of its kind in South Asia, initiating a mature historiographic tradition, presenting Sri Lanka’s history in a chronological order from the 6th century BCE. The authenticity of the facts provided in the document has been confirmed through archaeological research conducted in Sri Lanka and India. It is an important historical source in South Asia containing crucial information about lifetime of the Buddha, the Emperor Asoka and the rise of Buddhism as a world religion. The document played a significant role in popularizing Buddhism in Southeast Asia and contributed singularly to the identity of Emperor Asoka in the Indian history. Existence of number of manuscripts of Mahavamsa in several countries as well as the transliteration and translation of the text to several Southeast Asian and European languages stand testimony to its immense historical, cultural, literal, linguistic and scholarly values.\n\nUniversity of Peradeniya\n\nThe Swedish Freedom of the Press Ordinance of 1766: The world’s first legislation guaranteeing free communication of information\n\nSubmitter: Sweden\n\nOn 2 December 1766, the world’s first government-sponsored declaration of freedom of the press saw the light of day in Sweden, which at that time also comprised Finland. For the first time the importance of freedom of expression, its compass and confines, was acknowledged in constitutional law. The importance of the law is demonstrated in the flood of political pamphlets championing extended civil rights that were published in the years that followed. This collection includes two equally important parts: 1) the minutes and preparatory documents that explain the creation of the law, 2) the political pamphlets that illustrate its immediate and radical effect. Together they bear testimony to how defining moments in the coming of the open and democratic society can be the produce of quiet and diligent labour rather than of grand gestures. This nomination illustrates the exemplary and prudent first implementation of the most fundamental of human rights.\n\nHistory Lund University\n\nNational Collection of Palm-Leaf Manuscripts of Phra That Phanom Chronicle\n\nSubmitter: Thailand\n\nThe manuscripts narrate the tale of the Buddha's breast bones brought from India for enshrinement at Phrathat Phanom, vibrantly recognized since antiquity until today as most sacred Buddhist centre in the Mekong region.
