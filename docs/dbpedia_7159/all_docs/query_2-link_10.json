CAROLYN HUNT BALL has had a business career of unusual success and has been a leader among the business and professional women's organizations of the City of Muncie. She was born at Pleasant View, Cheatham County, Tennessee, September 30, 1879, daughter of Andrew J. and Josephine Elizabeth Hunt. Her father was born and reared in that locality, attended public schools and was a merchant and postmaster of the town. He was a member of the Masonic fraternity and the Presbyterian Church. He died in 1886 and is buried at Pleasant View. His wife, Josephine Elizabeth Williams, was born and reared at Perryville, Indiana, and about the close of the Civil war her parents moved to Tennessee, where she was married to Mr. Hunt. She is a Presbyterian. She had two daughters, and now lives with her younger daughter, Louise, wife of Wiley G. Reel, of Pittsburgh. Mr. Reel's great-great-grandfather was the first white child born in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Mrs. Reel has two children, Josephine and Wiley, Jr.\n\nMrs. Ball attended public schools at Covington, Indiana. Immediately after leaving school she prepared for a business career, entering the employ of Fahnley & McCrea, the well-known wholesale millinery house of Indianapolis. She spent twenty years with that firm, and then established her retail millinery business in Muncie. The Ball Hat Shop has been a very successful establishment from the start, and has become exceedingly popular because of Mrs. Ball's creative tastes and abilities in satisfying the most exacting demands. She was a stockholder in the Lincoln Bank & Trust Company and has invested her surplus funds in real estate, including apartment houses and residence property. Mrs. Ball is a member of the Eastern Star, the First Presbyterian Church, the Business and Professional Women's Club and is a Republican.\n\nShe was married, January 3, 1911, at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to Mr. John W.

His activities range over a wide field of business enterprises, originated, organized and developed by him and brought to successful issue by reason of his exceptional executive abilities. He has some fifteen or more business organizations to his credit, diversified as to character, including the extensive wholesaling and shipping of butter, eggs and poultry, with many packing plants in the Central West, also dealing in teas, coffees, sugars in the New England States through the chain stores known as the Cloverdale Company, manufacturing of ice, machine tools, keyless locks and postoffice equipment, printing and engraving, and other commodities, with manufacturing plants at Indianapolis, Detroit, New York, Boston and elsewhere, and founding and developing of the Meridian Life Insurance Company, the Arthur Jordan Piano Company of Washington, D. C., the consolidation of the music schools of Indianapolis into a Conservatory of Music serving this and the adjoining states; the organization of a permanent, philanthropic foundation endowed by him to distribute his charities. His labors have ranged from the selling of newspapers in his boyhood, and dealing in Bibles and other books in his early manhood, later organizing and perfecting large business industries, president of three life insurance companies, serving on college boards, trustee, director and officer of association, church and commercial boards, sought after and drafted into service where unusual ability and foresight have been needed in financial, philanthropic or artistic affairs. Music and musical matters have always received an important place in his activities.\n\nBorn in 1855, he began his career without resources other than his own efforts, at a time when large mergers and gigantic organizations were almost unknown, he foresaw the possibilities in many fields and became a pioneer and blazed the trail in many endeavors, relying upon his own resources and energy, and keen intelligent insight. Incidentally many employees, under his careful instruction, have developed into capable and successful business men. Many owe their success directly to opportunities and training received from Arthur Jordan.\n\nMr. Jordan was born in Madison, Indiana, in September, 1855. His father was Gilmore Jordan, veteran of the Mexican war of 1845- 1846, and captain, later brevetted major, in the Civil war of 1861-1864. Through his father he is entitled to membership in, and has long been a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion, and through his great- grandfather Jordan, to the Sons of the American Revolution. His mother was Harriet McLaughlin Jordan, of Scotch parentage. Both families were founded in the Colonial period of America.\n\nHis is a fine type of citizenship, a man of upright character, strict integrity and exceptional executive ability. He has a generous heart, and is nationally known for his public benefactions and helpfulness. He was the donor of the beautiful Arthur Jordan Memorial Hall of Butler University at Indianapolis. His contributions which made possible the erection of buildings for the Y. M. C. A. at Rangoon, Burma, and Tsinan Fu, China, two of the great capital cities of Asia, together with his many other distinctive benefactions here and abroad have gained for him an international reputation as a wise and generous philanthropist.\n\nAt present Mr. Jordan, in his seventy-sixth year, is the president of the Postal Life Insurance Company of New York, president of the Arthur Jordan Piano Company of Washington, D. C., and chairman of several boards.\n\nClick here for photo.\n\nINDIANA ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT Vol. 3\n\nBy Charles Roll, A.M.\n\nThe Lewis Publishing Company, 1931\n\nARTHUR HENRY SAPP. A member of the prominent law firm of Sapp, Sees & Glenn, Arthur Henry Sapp has been engaged in practice since 1912, at Huntington, where he has won a high and commanding position at the bar as an able and reliable attorney. It is not only as a lawyer, however, that he has been prominent, for his versatile gifts have carried him into numerous fields of activity and public service, in all of which he has attained distinction and even eminence.\n\nMr. Sapp was born at Ravenna, Ohio, January 13, 1883, and is a son of Charles Henry and Sarah M. (Hall) Sapp.. The family is traced back in a direct line to the Swiss-German border during the sixteenth century, and was founded in America in 1740, arriving in the colony of Maryland with the second Lord Baltimore. Daniel F. Sapp, the grandfather of Arthur H. Sapp, was born in Maryland, and pioneered at an early date to the Western Reserve of Ohio, taking up virgin land in the vicinity of Ravenna, where he hewed a farm from the wilderness and developed what later was to become a valuable property. He was a strong and rugged character, typical of the nation-builders of his day, and bore his full share of the labors of clearing the way for the advance of Western civilization.\n\nCharles Henry Sapp was born on his father's farm near Ravenna, where he received a district school education, and during his young manhood divided his time between teaching school in the short winter terms and spending the rest of the year in the work of the home farm. Thus he became a practical agriculturist as well as a man of superior intelligence, and for many years was engaged in farming on his own account. Of recent years he has made his home at Ravenna, where he is a writer of articles for several farm journals, dealing authoritatively with various subjects of interest and value to the tillers of the soil. Mr. Sapp married Miss Sarah M. Hall, who was born at Almonte, Ontario, Canada, a daughter of William Hall, a native of Ireland, who moved to Ohio from Canada in 1876. Mrs. Sapp passed away in 1911, being survived by three children: Flora L., now Mrs. Luther Eggleston, of Cheyenne, Wyoming; Arthur Henry, of this review, and Ernest C., of Ravenna.\n\nArthur Henry Sapp passed his early life on the home farm and graduated from Ravenna High School. He took his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1907 from Ohio Wesleyan University, at Delaware, Ohio, following which he became Latin teacher at Chattanooga, Tennessee, until 1909, and was principal of the Huntington schools from 1909 until 1911. For a short time he was a student at the University of Chicago, then entering the Indiana Law School, at Indianapolis, from which he was graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Laws in 1912 and since then has been actively engaged in the successful practice of his calling at Huntington, where he became head of the firm of Sapp, Sees & Glenn in 1926, the firm occupying offices at 346 North Jefferson Street. Mr. Sapp was prosecuting attorney for Huntington County, Fifty-sixth Judicial District of Indiana, from 1914 until 1920 and established an excellent record for faithful and courageous discharge of his duties. He is a member of the board of directors of the Women's Wear Company, Inc., in addition to which he has large farm interests and holdings. Mr. Sapp is a director of the James Whitcomb Riley Memorial Hospital for Crippled Children; a director of the Wesley Foundation, Purdue University; a trustee of the Warren Home for the Aged; member of the board of trustees of Evansville (Indiana)College; district governor (1924), first vice president (1925-26) and president (1927-28} of Rotary International; was a member in 1924 of the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in the work of which he has been active; a member of the American Bar Association, Indiana Bar Association and Huntington County Bar Association and the Phi Delta Theta fraternity; and in 1930 was chairman of the Indiana State Aid Commission. He is a thirty-second degree Mason and Knight Templar, a member of the Mystic Shrine, Independent Order of Odd Fellows and Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks, and belongs to the Rotary Club of Huntington and the Columbia Club of Indianapolis, and is a Republican in his political affiliation. Mr. Sapps services are much in demand as a lecturer upon subjects at church and luncheon clubs, and in addition he has written extensively for various publications. During the World ,war he organized and was chairman of the Huntington Chapter, American Red Cross.\n\nOn October 14, 1909, at Huntington, Mr. Sapp was united in marriage with Miss Clara E. Yingling, who was born at Huntington and received the degree of Bachelor of Laws from Ohio Wesleyan University in 1907. She is a daughter of the late Dr. D. Yingling, a native of Maryland, who came to Huntington as a young man and practiced medicine and surgery at this place for a half a century. Mrs. Yingling still survives as a resident of Huntington. To Mr. and Mrs. Sapp there has come one daughter: Helen Louise, born January 19, 1913. The family home is located at No. 834 North Jefferson Street.\n\nINDIANA ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT Vol. 3\n\nBy Charles Roll, A.M.\n\nThe Lewis Publishing Company, 1931\n\nWILLIAM DUDLEY FOULKE. Here is a name that to students of politics and government outside of Indiana will suggest first of all a courageous and high minded fighter for civil service reform and reform in other departments of government. That reputation is perhaps chiefly due to the position Mr. Foulke held during the Roosevelt administration as a member of the United States Civil Service Commission and also to Roosevelt's repeated tributes to the character and ability of his friend.\n\nMr. Foulke has been a resident of Richmond, Indiana, for over half a century, and Indiana people know him as a very versatile and many-sided man of affairs, and not least as the author of a number of books.\n\nHe was born in New York City, November 20, 1848, and is a descendant of Edward and Eleanor Foulke, who emigrated from Wales with the early colonists at the time William Penn established his colony of Pennsylvania. The Foulkes have been exemplars of the religion of the Society of Friends and William Dudley Foulke himself is a birthright Quaker, and it was not until the World war that he resigned his membership in the church. At that time he could not adopt the church attitude of a non-resistant, and instead he took an active part as a representative of the Government before the local conscription board. Since the war he has not been affiliated with any religious organization. His father was Thomas Foulke, a minister of the Society of Friends who did his greatest work as an educator. He was at one time principal of Ward School No. 45 in West Forty-third Street, New York then the largest public school in the city, with an attendance of some two thousand. Afterwards, when the Friends Seminary was first established at Sixteenth Street and Rutherford Place, he was made its principal. Thomas Foulke married Hannah Shoemaker, daughter of Abraham Shoemaker, a New York merchant.\n\nWilliam Dudley Foulke has given a very interesting account of his life in his book \"A Hoosier Autobiography,\" which was published in 1922. As a small boy he did not enjoy good health and rugged physical strength, and consequently his attendance at Ward School No. 45 in New York City was intermittent. In 1863 he graduated from the Friends Seminary, continuing his education in Bryant and Stratton's ,Commercial Cbllege, from which he received a diploma in 1864. He then entered Columbia College, now Columbia University, where he received the A. B. degree in 1869 and was graduated from Columbia College Law School in 1871. Columbia College conferred upon him the Master of Arts degree in 1872. Many years later, in 1906, Earlham College, at Richmond, in recognition of his public services and literary attainments, bestowed upon him the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws.\n\nMr. Foulke practiced law at New York City from 1871 to 1876. In the latter year he moved his home to Richmond, Indiana, where he resumed his career as an attorney and in addition he served as one of the lawyers of the Pennsylvania lines west of Pittsburgh, then known as the Panhandle Railroad Company. He achieved success and distinction in his profession, and with his private means he was able at a comparatively early age to devote some of his time and attention to the development of other interests. In the late '70s he was for a short time part owner and one of the editors of The Richmond Palladium. From 1909 to 1912 he was part owner and editor of the Evening Item at Richmond. Much of his time for many years has been taken up in travel, in public service and in the absorbing duties of authorship. Mr. Foulke for four years served in the Indiana State Senate, during the sessions of 1883 and 1885. His service on the United States Civil Service Commission was from 1901 to 1903. He began his political career as a Republican, but in 1884 refused to vote for Blaine. He was a staunch ally of Roosevelt as the champion of the Progressive movement during the early years of the present century, and in recent years has been an Independent. Mr. Foulke until 1928 was a director of the First National Bank of Richmond. Among many organizations with which he has been affiliated are the college fraternities Delta Phi and Phi Beta Kappa, and formerly was a member of the Masonic Order. He is a member of the New York City Club, Washington Cosmos Club, Indianapolis University Club, formerly belonged to the University Club, Washington, D. C., and to the Chevy Chase Club in Maryland.\n\nNot least among the honors which have represented his ardent championship of causes in which he believed was his service as president for several years of the American Woman's Suffrage Association up to 1890. From 1910 to 1915 he was president of the National Municipal League and was president of the National Civil Service Reform League in 1923-24.\n\nMr. Foulke married at Paris, France, October 10, 1872, Mary Taylor Reeves, daughter of Mark E. and Caroline M. Reeves. Her father was an early settler at Richmond, Indiana. The children born to Mr. and Mrs. Foulke were: Caroline, wife of Dr. John F. Urie; Lydia, now deceased, who was the wife of the Rev. Stanley C. Hughes; Mary, wife of James W. Morrison; Gwendolen, wife of Dudley Cates, and Arthur Dudley and Lucy Dudley, who died in childhood. Mr. Foulke now has thirteen grandchildren and six great-grandchildren living.\n\nA brief list of his important books is at once a representation of his literary labors and of his broad contacts with public affairs and public causes. His first book was Slav and Saxon, published by Putnam's in 1887, and in later editions in 1899 and 1904. His Life of Oliver P. Morton was published by Bowen Merrill Company in 1899. The fruits of his scholarship during the past thirty years have been: Maya, a Story of Yucatan (Putnam's, 1900); Protean Papers, (Putnam's, 1903); History of the Langobards (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1906); Quaker Boy, afterwards published as Dorothy Day (Cosmopolitan Press, 1911) ; Masterpieces of the Masters of Fiction (Cosmopolitan Press,. 1912); Some Love Songs of Petrarch (Oxford University Press, 1915); Lyrics of War and Peace (Oxford University Press, 1916) ; Fighting the Spoilsmen (Putnam's, 1919); Today and Yesterday, poems (Oxford Press., 1920); A Hoosier Autobiography (Oxford Press, 1922); Is Our Civilization Really Declining (1923 pamphlet); A Random Record of Travel During Fifty Years (Oxford Press, 1925); Roosevelt and the Spoilsmen (published 1925, by the National Civil Service Reform League) ; Songs of Eventide (Bobbs Merrill Company, 1928); Earth's Generations Pass (Oxford Press, 1930); and Lucius B. Swift (Bobbs Merrill Company, 1930).\n\nINDIANA ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT Vol. 3\n\nBy Charles Roll, A.M.\n\nThe Lewis Publishing Company, 1931\n\nCHARLES N. TEETOR, Indiana inventor and manufacturer, was born near Hagerstown, December 15, 1870, and most of the years of his life have been spent in that vicinity. His parents were Zachariah and Barbara (Hoover) Teetor. The Teetors came from Switzerland and the Hoovers from Germany. At least four generations of his paternal ancestors possessed a mechanical and inventive frame of mind. It is a legitimate conclusion that the mechanical impulse was implanted in Charles N. Teetor at birth. Special circumstances caused him to make intensive use of all his working talents when most boys are still dreaming in their books at school. He was the fifth in a large family of eight children. After the session of the country district school he worked in his father's grist mill. In 1883, when he was thirteen years of age, his father bought a larger mill at Hagerstown. The following year his father failed in business and later in the same year the mother of the family died. Thus when he was fifteen Charles N. Teetor was thrown on his own resources. During the summer he worked as a farm hand, but managed to attend a five-months' country school during the winter until he had gained the equivalent of eight grades of common school and seven months of a high school education. A small loan from a wealthy neighbor enabled him to attend the National Normal University at Lebanon, Ohio. With this preparation he taught winter terms of school, and the rest of the year worked as a carpenter. In 1892 he married Miss Leora E. Nicholson, of Hagerstown, and, having the responsibility of providing for a home and family, he sought a more continuous and dependable vocation, and one in which he might express his mechanical genius.\n\nFor several years he was in the service of the Arrow Bicycle Manufacturing Company at Indianapolis. From there he moved to Muncie, opened a bicycle repair shop, and subsequently was employed as engineer by the Speeder Bicycle Company of Newcastle, Indiana. For this company he perfected and designed a new bicycle, a type that was popular and brought considerable profit to the manufacturers. In the meantime he had been working on a design for a railway inspection car. Having perfected the theoretical design, he, in 1895, returned to Hagerstown, where he interested his father, brothers and C. H. Hartley in the organization of a small company to produce and market his car. Mr. Teetor became general manager of the Railway Cycle Manufacturing Company, as the business was first known. It was started with meager capital, and the successive enlargements were the result of accumulated earnings. In 1904 the original company became the Light Inspection Car Company, and from 1913 to 1918 the business was the Teetor-Hartley Motor Company. The cars manufactured by these successive companies, with design and improvement added from time to time by Mr. Teetor, have been sold and distributed by many thousands, not only in America but in Europe and South America.\n\nIn 1909 his company took up the manufacture of the Teetor Motor and the development of piston rings. During the next nine years the organization contributed many improved motors and piston rings to the automotive industry. In 1918 the entire motor division of the business was sold to the Anstead interests at Connersville, Indiana. From that date on the piston ring division has been developed as an independent industry. During these years Mr. Teetor was active with the company in the capacity of general manager. In 1928 the company was reorganized and changed from a closed corporation to one of public participation. Since this reorganization Mr. Teetor has been president of the company.\n\nWhile he still finds joy in the routine of the: shop and in his working laboratory, Mr. Teetor has willingly turned over the heavy responsibilities of the management of the business to younger shoulders. He and Mrs. Teetor have traveled widely. Mrs. Teetor has been president of the League of Women Voters of Indiana. Their immediate family consists of five children; the sons being Lothair, Macy, Donald and Herman. The daughter, Winifred, was graduated from the Principia School at St. Louis and is now attending DePauw University. The sons all finished college and are now associated with the Perfect Circle Company at Hagerstown.\n\nINDIANA ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS OF AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT Vol. 3\n\nBy Charles Roll, A.M.\n\nThe Lewis Publishing Company, 1931"
