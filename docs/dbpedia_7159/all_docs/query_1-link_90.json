        "text": "ButlerCounty in the Early Wars\n\n(page 489) Butler county has always taken a prominent part in all of the wars in which the United States has engaged. When, following the destruction of the United States battleship Maine in Havana harbor in February, 1898, there came the declaration of war with Spain, Company E, First Ohio National Guard, was among the first commands to respond to the call to arms. On April 26 the order came for Company E to report at the National Guard armory in (page 490) Cincinnati. A great farewell, with a parade headed by the members of Wetzel-Compton post, No. 96, Grand Army of the Republic, was given the Hamilton soldiers. From Cincinnati the company was sent to CampBushbell at Columbus, and on May 16, under orders, proceeded to CampThomas on the old Chickamaugua battlefield at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Later the company was sent with the First Ohio National Guard to Tampa, Florida, and then to Fernandina, Florida, where it remained until the close of the Spanish-American war without seeing service in Cuba. The commissioned officers of Company E were August. W. Margedant, captain ; George Ayers, first lieutenant, who resigned on July 18, 1898; Oliver P. Branch, first lieutenant ; Charles A. Cox, a brother of the present governor of Ohio, James M. Cox, second lieutenant. The noncommissioned officers were Arthur M. Sims, first sergeant ; Jacob M. Roll, quartermaster sergeant; Thomas R. Carroll, sergeant; Charles E. Ross, sergeant ; Linus H. French, sergeant ; Albert F. Elkins, musician ; Amasa McDonald, musician ; Allen Cornelius, wagoner; and Charles E. Castator, artificer. Other Butler county men at the time answered their country's call to arms and saw service during the Spanish-American war. These included Dr. Herbert E. Twitchell, who was assigned as a surgeon of the 1st regiment with the rank of captain. Captain Robert B. Huston saw service at Santiago and died in the service. G. Enyert Hooven enlisted and was sent to the Philippine Islands for service. Fred L. Drummond saw service in Porto Rico ; John Curran, in Porto Rico ; Charles Stillmacher, Earl Nutt, Wesley G. Wulzen and others in the Philippines ; while a number of Butler county men who were members of the famous United States 6th infantry saw service in Cuba and participated in the battle of San Juan Hill. These included William Conlin, Isaac W. Green, Michael P. Connaughton, Augustus Kinsley and Jacob Morton.\n\nThe War of the Rebellion. Butler county responded most nobly to the various calls of President Abraham Lincoln in the internecine war that shook the very foundations of the country from 1861 until 1865, but which brought a united country-not half slave and half free, but all free. No man able to Dear arms in t he cause 011 freedom then refused to answer his country's call. Hamilton and the surrounding country gave three full regiments to the service during this memorable struggle-the Thirty-fifth, the Sixty-ninth and the One Hundred and Sixty-Seventh Ohio Volunteer Infantry. The first regiment to go into service from Butler county during the civil war was the Thirty-fifth Ohio Volunteer Infantry. The regiment was recruited in Hamilton and was mustered into service on August 7,1861. On September 26 the regiment proceeded, under orders, to Cynthiana, Kentucky, where it went into camp. While the regiment was encamped there the ladies of the town presented it with a handsome American flag. The fag had been made by the ladies themselves at a series of meetings held at the home of. Mrs. George Morrison, the daughter of Dr. Robert Breckinridge. The Thirty-fifth had as its officers men who had made their mark in the community and were known for their sterling characters and fearlessness. These included Ferdinand Van Der Veer, as colonel ; (page 491) Charles L. H. Long and Henry V. N. Boynton, lieutenant colonels ; Joseph L. Budd, major; George B. Wright, John Van Der Veer, James E. Harris, adjutants ; Perkins A. Gordon, surgeon ; Francis D. Morris, Charles A. Wright; and A. H. Landis, assistant surgeons ; John Woods, chaplain. Perhaps no other regiment that went out from Butler county saw more strenuous service. It engaged in the following noted events of the civil war: The battle of Corinth, the battles of Chickamaugua, Mission Ridge, Buzzard Roost, Kenesaw mountain, Pine mountain, Pine Knob and Peach Tree creek and was engaged in the Atlanta campaign. One of the interesting features of this regiment's history is that judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, of the United States court, Chicago, is a son of Dr. A. H. Landis, the surgeon of the regiment, and was given his name because of his birth on the day the battle of Kenesaw mountain was fought.\n\nThe Sixty-ninth Ohio Volunteer Infantry was also recruited at Hamilton in the autumn of 1861, its headquarters being on the Butler county fair grounds. Owing to the desire to quickly recruit the regiment to full war strength, men from Fairfield, Darke, Harrison, Montgomery and Preble counties were accepted. The Sixty-ninth remained in camp on the Butler county fair grounds until February 19, 1862, when it received orders to proceed to CampChase, at Columbus, Ohio, where it was placed on duty guarding rebel prisoners and continuing its preparation for service in the field. On April 19, the regiment left CampChase for Nashville, Tennessee, where, on April 22, it went into camp on the grounds of Major Lewis. Here the regiment was reviewed by Andrew Jackson, a warm personal friend of the colonel and who was then the military governor of Tennessee and afterward the president of the United States.\n\nLewis D. Campbell was the first colonel of the Sixty-ninth. Col. Campbell resigned in August, 1862. He was succeeded successively by Cols. W. B. Cassilly, M. F. Moore and J. H. Brigham. The other officers of the regiment were Charles L. Gano, George F. Elliott, J. H. Brigham, lieutenant colonels ; Eli J. Hickox, James L. Hanna, Leis E. Hicks, majors; Richard H. Cunningham W. S. Mead, Thomas B. Hofman, Joseph W. Boynton, majors; Fred B. Landis, Levi E. Chenoweth, quartermasters. The first commissioned captains of the several companies were : Company A, J. H. Brigham ; Company B, C. N. Gibbs ; Company C, G. F. Elliott; Company D, D. E. Hickox ; Company E, David Putnam ; Company F. Robert Clements ; Company G, William Patton ; Company H, L. C. Counsellor; Company I, J. V. Heslip; Company K, J. J. Hanna. This regiment also saw unusually active service during the war and participated in Gen. Sherman's march to the sea and the following battles : Gallatin, StoneRiver, Mission Ridge, Resaca, Pumpkin Vine Creek, KenesawMountain, Marietta, ChattahoochieRiver, Peach Tree Creek, Atlanta, Bentonville and The Siege of Jonesboro.\n\nThe One Hundred and Sixty-seventh was organized in Hamilton in April of 1864, following the call of President Lincoln for what were termed one-hundred-day men. The regiment was mustered (page 492) into service of the United States May 14, and on May 18 started for West Virginia, reaching Charleston, in that state, on May 21, going at once into camp. Upon orders the regiment later proceeding up the Kanawha river for a distance of twenty-five miles, where four companies were detached and sent for service at Gauly bridge. The regiment relieved the Second, Third and Seventh West Virginia cavalry regiments and was engaged principally in transporting supplies to the troops of Gens. Hunter, Cook and Averill and in guarding government stores. This regiment returned to Hamilton and was mustered out of the service September 8, 1864. The officers of the One Hundred and Sixth-seventh Infantry were Thomas Moore, colonel ; J. E. Newton, lieutenant colonel ; John F. Bender, major; LaFayette Traber, adjutant; Henry P. Dave, quartermaster; Moses H. Haynes, surgeon ; J. S. Ferguson, assistant surgeon ; and Jeremiah Geiger, chaplain.\n\nIn connection with the civil war it might be well to mention the fact that the notorious marauder and rebel leader, Gen. John Morgan, was captured by a citizen of Hamilton, Major George W. Rue, who was then serving with the Ninth Kentucky Cavalry. General Morgan and his marauders had crossed the Ohio river and at one time threatened Hamilton, but had successfully worked their way east to a point near Salem, Ohio, where Gen. Morgan found himself cut of from any possible return to his own forces and with Major Rue and his men in hot pursuit. General Morgan then surrendered, was sent to the Ohio penitentiary, from which he escaped, and later died in Canada.\n\nThe Mexican War. Ohio's quota of troops under the call of President James K. Polk during the war with Mexico was three full regiments of infantry. In answer to this call two companies were organized in Hamilton. A public meeting of the citizens was called and after several addresses an appeal was made for enrollments for service against Mexico. In answer to this call sufficient men were enrolled to organize one full company, which went into camp in a sycamore grove which was then located south of what is now the Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western railway bridge and just south of Sycamore street. The officers of this volunteer company were John B. Weller, who had served in congress from 1839 until 1845, captain ; James. George, who served as a colonel of the Second Minnesota Infantry during the war of the rebellion, first lieutenant ; and Oliver Weatherby, second lieutenant. This company was designated as Company I and was assigned to the First Ohio Infantry. Captain Weller was later made lieutenant colonel of the regiment and Lieut. George made captain of the company, while Sec. Lieut. Weatherby was made first lieutenant; William Wilson, second lieutenant ; and Jonathan Richmond, third lieutenant. Company I participated in the engagement at Monterey, on September 19, 20 and 21, 1846, in which twelve members of the company were wounded and three-John Pearson, Oscar Brehme and Samuel Freeman--killed. Captain George was wounded in this action, in consequence of which he resigned, and Ferdinand Van Der Veer, who had in the meantime, become first lieutenant, was elected captain and remained in command up until the close of the war.\n\n(page 493) The second company recruited in Hamilton for the Mexican war was known as Butler Boys, No. 2. It was mainly through the efforts of Capt. Young that this company was organized. It was attached to the Fourth Ohio Infantry, of which Capt. Young became the major. This company also saw considerable service and was considered one of the best organizations which went from the BuckeyeState.\n\nThe War of 1812. Although Butler county was sparsely settled and many of its men had taken part in the various Indian wars, still it responded promptly to the call to arms when war was declared in 1812. Although the records are somewhat incomplete, still it is known that at least eight companies were organized in Butler county. The terms of enlistment were but for six months, and the organization of so many companies was made possible by the re-enlistment of the men. One of the first men to respond to the call was Joel Collins, who had fought in the Indian wars, and then settled in Oxford township. Collins enrolled as a private in Capt. William Robeson's Rife company, one of the two companies of militia in the county. Captain Robeson was promoted to brigade major, and John Taylor, his lieutenant, was made commander. Captain Taylor, however, dying, Collins was elected his successor. His commission bore the date of May 16, 1812, with the rank of captain of a rifle regiment. Captain Collins was attached to the First Battalion, Second Regiment, Third Brigade, and First Division of the Ohio Militia. In the spring of 1812, Gen. James Findlay, who had command of the Third Brigade, ordered the two rifle companies of Butler county to parade in Hamilton and the company having the largest number of men in line would then be attached to Gen. Findlay's regiment. On the night before the parade was held torrential- rains fell and Capt. Collins' men from the west side of the river were unable to cross to the town of Hamilton for the parade, and so the company of Capt. James Robinson was chosen and participated in the disastrous campaign of the first army of the north. When, during the following summer, it was decided to furnish the army on the northern frontier with additional troops, Capt. Collins proceeded under orders with his company to Lebanon, where they were joined by the companies of Capts. Mcleans, Leonard and Hinkle, a company of artillery under Capt. Joseph Jenkinson and a company of light infantry under Capt. Mathias Corwin. The commissioned officers elected Capt. Joseph Jenkinson major., They then started for Urbana, but before Dayton was reached word had come of the defeat of Gen. Hull and his army and that the British and Indians were rapidly advancing. However, the companies proceeded to Urbana, where they joined the Second Battalion under command of Major James Galloway of Xenia. David Sutton of Warren country was chosen to command the regiment. Under orders from Gov. Meigs, Col. Sutton's forces were then divided and Major Jenkinson with his battalion was ordered to file to the left by way of Troy and Piqua toward Fort Wayne, while the colonel with Galloway's battalion, joined to troops destined to form the center line and started toward FortMcArthur. Soon after the arrival of Jenkinson at Piqua, Gen. Harrison, with two regiments (page 494) from Kentucky, appeared and assumed command. By lot it was decided that the forces of Capt. Collins should proceed to St. Mary's and then to FortJennings, where they remained until March, 1813, when they were discharged from service.\n\nCaptain John Hamilton also commanded a company recruited from the vicinity of Hamilton. William Shafor, who survived the war. for a period of sixty-five years, became one of the best known citizens of Butler county. He was a lieutenant under the command of Capt. Hamilton.\n\nCaptain Zachary P. DeWitt, of Oxford, commanded a company of mounted riflemen. Thomas Irwin, of Lemon township, served as a major for six months. Robert Anderson, of Ross township, was in the pack service and later received a commission as lieutenant of the Twenty-sixth regiment. Alexander Delorac, John Hall and Anderson Spencer also saw service in the war of 1812, while Dr. Daniel Millikin, John Woods, Rev. Matthew G. Wallace, Col. Matthew Hueston and others were among the volunteers.\n\nButlerCounty in the World War\n\nBy Clayton A. Leiter\n\nElectrified by the words of President Woodrow Wilson in his address to the Congress of the United States on April 3, 1917, laying before Congress and the people of the United States the duplicity of Germany and the futility of attempting to remain at peace with the Imperial German government, and by the prompt action of Congress in declaring a state of war to exist between these nations, Butler county's young manhood responded promptly and nobly to the call to the colors. Three years of the titanic struggle upon the battlefields of Europe, repeated. insults to the Stars and Stripes, the arrogance and atrocities of the Germans had aroused the blood of America to the boiling point. And when the call to arms came, Butler county stood ready. Hundreds of its young men volunteered for service and there was not one who hesitated when his lot to go was drawn from the gigantic lottery of fate conducted under the federal draft law. More than two thousand of the county's young men donned the khaki of the army or the blue of the navy. Many of them won distinction and wore the shoulder straps of authority ; hundreds saw service overseas and participated in the closing struggles of the great war ; and almost one hundred gave their lives in that memorable and triumphant effort to make the world safe for democracy. At CampSherman, Camp Zachary Taylor, CampGrant, CampKnox, CampSheridan, Columbus Barracks, the Great Lakes Naval Training Station, ParisIsland and other points, the young men of Butler county were trained for their duties as soldiers and sailors and marines. Most of them saw their service with the Thirty-seventh and the Eighty-third Divisions-both Ohio divisions. The National Guard. Naturally the first to respond to the call to the colors was the Ohio National Guard. Company E, Third Ohio National Guard, commanded by Capt. Wesley G. Wulzen, (page 495) had been called for service on the Mexican border on June 18, 1916. This company had been organized in Hamilton, March 30, 1916, with Wesley G. Wulzen, captain; C. J. Henry, first-lieutenant; and H. A. Riviere, second-lieutenant. When the Ohio National Guard was called for duty on the Mexican border, Company E was sent to CampWillis, at Columbus, July 3rd, and on September 15th was ordered to CampPershing, at El Paso, Texas. The company remained on duty along the Rio Grande until March 21, 1917, when it was sent to Fort Riley, Kansas, presumably to be discharged, but instead it was ordered to remain in federal service and was sent to Point Pleasant, West Virginia, for guard duty. This continued until October, 1917, when the company was sent to Camp Sheridan, Alabama, where it was transferred to the federal service, as then organized, and became Company E, One Hundred and Forty-eighth United States Infantry, attached to the Thirty-seventh Division. On May 25, 1918, Company E was sent to Camp Lee, Virginia, for final preparation for foreign service. On June 21 the company embarked on the United States steamer Susquehanna for overseas, landing at Brest, France, on July 5th. Immediately upon arrival overseas, Capt. Wulzen was transferred to Company F, One Hundred and Forty-eighth Infantry, formerly the Cleveland Grays, who had been recruited to war strength at Middletown. Lieutenant J. Wesley Morris of Company E was transferred to Company F at the same time. Captain Charles Slade was then assigned to command Company E with Leland Rock as first-lieutenant and H. A. Riviere as second-lieutenant. Companies E and F have the distinction of having made the greatest advance of any of the allied troops in the great ArgonneForest drive ; but they paid dearly for this distinction. Company E lost 123 men in killed and wounded, while Company F lost 91 in killed and wounded. Throughout their service in France Companies E and F took part in every engagement in which the famous Thirty-seventh Division participated. After reaching France the Thirty-seventh Division was mobilized at Bourmont, and then was sent to Baccarat, where it suffered its first air raid and baptism of fire. Here the division took over from the French a fourteen-mile sector and the One Hundred and Forty-eighth Infantry dug itself in. On September 15th, the division was sent to Robert Espague, then to Recicourt. Here the Thirty-seventh Division started the drive that ended in the capture of St. Mihiel, and received the credit for the capture of Faucon, Ivoiry and Cierges. On the night of September 23rd, the barrage was laid for the advance of the division and the drive was on. In the Montfaucon drive, in which the Hamilton and Middletown companies took a decisive part, the Thirty-seventh Division attacked one of the most strongly fortified sectors on the French front and came out victorious.\n\nLater the Hamilton and Middletown buys trekked through the mud of the battlefield of Ypres in full marching order to join the French in order to launch the Ypres-Lys offensive, which ended in an allied victory and helped force the Germans to capitulate. On the morning of October 21st the first of the Buckeye Division alighted from their troop trains at St. Jean, which was two (page 496) kilometers from the ruined city of Ypres. From St. Jean the Hamilton men looked upon the worst spectacles of German destruction. That evening orders were received to commence the march to Hooglede, twenty-one kilometers distant, where headquarters in Belgium were established on October 22nd. During the entire night the men trekked over the Flanders road, weighted by full packs, rife and ammunition, at times sprawling headlong into the shell holes, but always rising with increased courage and a vim to catch the Hun. From Hooglede, the division moved to Lichtervelde, October 20th, thence to Muclebeke on October 28th, Denterghem on October 30th, and on the morning of October 31st, after a terrific artillery barrage, jumped \"over the top\" with the Ninety-first Division, the Twenty-eighth Division artillery and the Thirteenth French army. On November 3rd, the Hamilton and Middletown boys were among those who forced the crossing of the Scheldt river and won the honor of being the first soldiers in four years to cross the stream.\n\nThe division was relieved on November 4th, but on November 9th re-entered the drive at Synghem, Belgium, where they were located when the armistice was signed.\n\nThe Thirty-seventh Division, with which the Hamilton and Middletown men served, was cited by generals of both the French and Belgium armies and commended by King Albert of Belgium.\n\nThe Hamilton and Middletown companies were among the troops chosen to parade the streets of Brussels seventy-two hours after the retreating Germans had evacuated the city. They remained in Germany and Belgium until the spring of 1919, when they were returned to the United States and discharged from service.\n\nBattery E. Soon after the United States entered the World war, a number of Hamilton young men enlisted in Battery E, Third Ohio Field Artillery. Some of them remained with this organization when it was transferred to the federal service and became Battery E, of the One Hundred and Thirty-sixth Field Artillery, but others joined other branches of the service. Those who originally enlisted in this company were Robert Curry, Merrill Swain, Fenton Slifer, Charles Campbell Gard, Harper Sommers, Norman Peters, Don Fitton, John Ulrik, TempleJames, Ralph Howe, Clarence Loners, Fuhrmann Slifer, Enyert Moore and Stephen Henn. The Armco Ambulance Corps. One of the most noted organizations that went out from Butler county during the great World war was the Armco Ambulance Corps of Middletown. During the war the American Rolling Mill company played a great part, not only in the production of war material, in the activity of its men and officers, led by President George M. Verity, in leading all patriotic movements, but also in the organization of the famous Armco Ambulance Corps, for ambulance field service in France with the American Red Cross. This organization was composed of fifteen loyal Armco men: James E. Bryan, Victor S. Collard, Sidney E. Graef, Captain Newman Ebersole, Schenck Simpson, Vaughan Horner, John B. Marshall, J. Morace Beard, Albert P. Preyer, Raymond P. Myers, lieutenant Horace W. Rinearson, Sidney S. Gold, William P. Pease, Raymond L. Maneely, and Lee L. Ware.\n\n(page 497) These men were recruited from the forces of the American Rolling Mill company at Middletown, fully. equipped and prepared. for the great part which they were destined to play overseas and in bringing victory to the allied arms. They sailed from New Yorke at ten o'clock on the night of August 7, 1917, having been tendered a farewell reception at Middletown by the Armco association on Saturday night, July 21st, at which inspiring addresses were made by President George M. Verity, Vice-presidents G. H. Charls, Art Sheldon, Newman Ebersole, and T. W. Jenkins. - In his address president Verity pointed out that each of the seven ambulances sent with the corps would cost $3,000 and that it would cost from $500 to $600 a year to maintain each man in the corps. In all, it would cost from $25,000 to $30,000 to buy the outfits and pay the first year's expenses-and the American Rolling Mill company guaranteed this expense, the Armco association giving whatsoever amount it desired. Before being mustered into the United States service, the Armco Ambulance corps made the following moves : Arriving at Bordeaux, France, August 19th, they reached Paris-on August 20th; reported to Richard Norton and signed up with the Norton-Harges Volunteer Ambulance service with the French army. They left Paris for the training camp at Sandricourt on August 27th. Here they remained until September 14th. On September 25th, they were mustered into Section No. Twenty-two, United States Army Ambulance Service, which was attached to a French Division then resting after hard fighting on the Verdun Sector. Before reporting to the new section and their division, the whole group was sent to La Havre to bring back to Paris a convoy of twenty Red Cross cars. After they returned they found their new associates and. really commenced their work. On October 5, 1917, they were ordered to the Verdun Sector with Section No. Twenty-two. They remained there for five days, being relieved by Section No. Fifteen, an Allentown section of the United States army. They were again sent to Sandricourt, now a United States army ambulance training camp, to be reorganized. A number of other volunteer, service men who had also enlisted, were grouped with the Armco boys, and together on October 20th joined Section No. Five, which was then at the front with the Sixty-sixth Division of Chausseurs Alpines, one of the great \"Blue Devil\" divisions of the French army, which had for many days been preparing for the great attack of October 23rd, in which the Chemin des Dames and Fort Malmaison were captured.\n\nIt was here that the Armco Ambulance Corps received its \"baptism of fire,\" and the section behaved so well that on November 2nd, it was lined up in the Public Square, while the general of the division thanked it for the splendid work it had done and announced that he had recommended it for another citation. From this time on, due to strict censorship, the movements of the Armco Ambulance Corps could not be closely followed and although it was known that it was attached to both holding and attacking \"shock\" divisions and was moved from one front to another, information as to the time and the place could not be obtained. But although names and dates were not there, in letters coming to home folks from the (page 498) members of the Armco Ambulance Corps were descriptions of thrilling adventures at night on narrow roads, crowded with artillery supply trains, ambulances, and troops. Mud everywhere; the darkness; the anxiety to get the wounded in safely; scenes that words cannot describe. The flag of the section to which the Armco Ambulance Corps was attached has upon it six Croix de Guerre, the following names each representing a citation : Verdun, Air Aisne, Chemin des Dames, Marne, Champagne and Aisne again, indicating that these Middletown young men saw service and were cited for their bravery and service in these several battles.\n\nAfter a long, faithful and devoted service to freedom and their country, these noble young men of the Armco Ambulance Corps arrived from overseas on the steamship New Amsterdam, landing at New York on May 2, 1919. They were met at the pier by President George M. Verity and other representatives of the American Rolling Mill company and taken at once to Middletown in special cars. They reached Middletown on Saturday, May 3rd, and what a greeting was given them. Nothing was left undone. At the last minute it was decided to make of the occasion a \"Welcome Home\" parade, not only for the Armco Ambulance Corps, but for all returned service men in Middletown-soldiers, sailors, marines alike. The result justified the efforts put forth, for the sight of the boys marching to the stirring strains of the martial music brought a thrill to the hearts of Middletown as no other parade ever has.\n\nLong before the train, to which the special cars bringing the Armco Ambulance Corps was attached, pulled into the station, thousands of people armed with the Stars and Stripes, lined the streets to give their cheers of welcome. The line of march was gay with bunting, and the faces of the onlookers were radiant with happiness and enthusiasm. Captain Calvin Verity was the commanding officer of the day, with Lieutenant J. O. Dearth, Adjutant and Lieutenant Jenkins, U. S. N. R. F., and Cadet Dell, U. S. N. R. F., acting as aides. The Armco association directors led the parade with Smittie's band of Cincinnati furnishing the music. The first company of soldiers was made up exclusively of overseas men in the regulation overseas cap and uniform, led by Lieutenant Babbitt, followed by the marines, who acted as color-bearers to the honor squad. Lieutenant Adair officered the second company which was made up of colored troops. Then followed Chief Petty Officer Mercer with his fine squad of sailors. A third company of infantry headed by Lieutenant Davies and a fourth company of infantry, under Lieutenant Elliott completed the uniform division. Esberger's band, of Cincinnati, led the second section composed of civilians, commanded by \"General\" Joe Crawford, of the sales department of the American Rolling Mill company. This division was made up of representatives of all departments of the Armco organization and included many girls. The junior O. U. A. M. drum corps also furnished music for the civilian division. The line of march was from the Big Four station up Third street to Broadway, on Broadway to First, on First to Main and down Main to the Sorg opera house. Here Arthur Sheldon, president of the Armco association, formally welcomed the boys and (page 499) presented George M. Verity, the president of the American Rolling Mill company, who called for three rounds of cheers, first for the soldiers of Middletown, then for the soldiers of the Armco and last for the Armco Ambulance Corps. Mr. Verity spoke feelingly of the work the boys had done ; of their many citations-the last and greatest of which conferred upon them the honor of wearing the golden fourragere \"Medaille Militaire.\" Mr. Verity was followed with brief words of welcome by Captain McClellan, who was in command of the Armco Ambulance Corps upon its arrival in France and Congressman Warren Gard of Hamilton. Russell Hill of the Armco Eight interspersed the program with suitable musical selections. After the exercises the parade re-formed and continued to Armco field, where it disbanded and all the boys in uniform were treated to an old-fashioned turkey dinner, with strawberry shortcake and ice cream in the dining room of the Armco main office building. The boys of the Armco Ambulance Corps appreciated the great welcome given them. The same Armco spirit that had sent them overseas to aid in paying the debt America owed La Fayette and Rochambeau, and had followed them through all. their fearful tasks, welcomed them home again.\n\nHamilton in the War. Hamilton gave more than 1,000 of its young men for service in the World war. Many of whom won distinction in the service, but all did their duty fully and loyally. Two Hamilton men won the Distinguished Service Cross, Sergeant John M. Crocker and Captain Harry D. Chadwick, the latter, however, being officially credited to Chicago, where he had entered the service. Eugene Shelly Millikin, who attained the rank of lieutenant colonel, although credited to Colorado, where he entered the service, is a Hamilton man, a son of Dr. Samuel H. Millikin. Those from Hamilton who attained the rank of captain are : Theodore E. Bock, Robert M. Sohngen, Wesley G. WuIzen, Don Fitton, Willard See, Mark Millikin, A. L. Smedley, John A. Graft, Miles E. Hendricks, Hurry D. Chadwick, Maurice J. Moore, William T. Stewart, Chester A. Rothwell, James F. McNary, Paul D. Connor, Lucian B. Kahn, Howard W. Crows, W. E. Griffith, and James E.

These regiments did some wonderful fighting together with the Engineers and Field Signal Corps and after the armistice was signed became a part of the Army of Occupation sent into Germany. Butler county may well feel proud of the war record made by many of her sons. When the Eighty-third Division from CampSherman arrived at Le Mans, France, General Pershing was in need of a depot brigade at that point and this division was chosen for this service. The companies of infantry were cut from (page 511) 250 to 50 men each and while the fifty were held at Le Mans, the other 200 of each company were sent up to the front as replacement units and many of them saw exceptionally hard fighting. Liberty and Victory Loans. In every war activity the people of Butler county took a most loyal part. As her sons marched forth by hundreds to do battle, and die if necessary, for the freedom and safety of the world, those who remained at home played well their parts. In the four campaigns for the sale of Liberty bonds and in the final campaign for the sale of the Victory bonds, 44,390 Butler countypeoplesubscribedfor$13,384,900 worth of these various bonds.\n\nIn every campaign the county went \"over the top.\" These campaigns were directed by Charles E. Heiser, president of the Second National bank, but with the able assistance of the loyal men and women of the county, who organized themselves into various committees to bring about such commendable results. Judge Clarence Murphy personally conducted several of the drives with great success. In the various drives for funds for the federal government to be used to bring victory to the Stars and Stripes, the cities and villages of Butler county subscribed as follows: Hamilton, $7,537,600; Middletown, $3,900,750; College Corner, $126,400; Monroe, $247,500; Okeana, $189,350; Oxford, $1,012,650; Seven Mile, $163,350; Somerville, $99,750; Trenton, $71.000.\n\nThe Y. M. C. A. During the world war, the Hamilton Y. M. C. A. was the center of most of the war activities. The Hamilton draft board composed of John M. Beeler, C. B. Atkin, John F. Mayer and Dr. Francis M. Fitton, made its headquarters and conducted its examinations in the association's building, while from this building all the Hamilton young men called into the National Army were sent to the various camps and cantonments. Secretaries of the association were sent to the many army camps where Hamilton boys were stationed while a song leader was provided, lunches furnished, mail looked after, and when the young men returned from service more than 200 of them were provided with free memberships in the association. The Hamilton association also sent into the service overseas Herbert Killender, John R. Wynd, B. D. Lecklider, E. Vernon Hill and Donald Lowrie; Mr. Killender was especially engaged in refugee work in Paris, while Mr. Wynd saw service in both France and England; Mr. Lecklider and Mr. Hill were sent to France; and Mr. Lowrie had many exciting experiences in a rather strenuous service in Russia. The association, through its general secretary, F. D. Chadwick, and several members of its board of trustees served on the examination committee for applicants for Y. M. C. A. overseas service. This was no small service, inasmuch as it took many days of their time in different parts of the state interviewing men and endeavoring to the best of their ability to select the proper men for this important service. The association also afforded office space for the Red Cross, taking care of the light, heat, janitor service and in fact all matters of this nature without any charge whatsoever. 'Since the closing of the war and the return of the soldiers, the association has been instrumental in helping to find employment for the men returned from overseas, in assisting returned soldiers to their homes, who lived elsewhere than Hamilton, (page 512) in giving free accommodations to soldiers in the city for various reasons. Assistance has also been given soldiers' relatives in making out any of the papers requested by the government; also in assisting the United States treasury department and the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, in showing the soldiers the proper appreciation of their insurance; the association secretaries having been appointed government representatives in this particular work. The Women in the War. The women of Butler county played a most noble part in the war which caused the downfall of German autocracy and aided much in bringing about the victory which restored peace to a war weary world. These women answered every call for service; made many personal sacrifices; gave up pleasures and social activities; and centered their every energy upon the duty that presented itself to them. They accepted every opportunity for service and never failed in its fullest performance. The principal organizations which called for the services of the women of. Butler county were the Women's Council of National Defense, the National League for Woman's Service, and the Hamilton and Middletown Chapters of the American Red Cross. The work of these various organizations was so closely interwoven that the organizations themselves were practically merged and their various activities directed by the same persons. While Ben Strauss was the chairman of the Hamilton Chapter of the American Red Cross and gave unselfishly of his time, his energy and his money to its work and success, still the real working head of the organization, the personal directing force of its various activities was the general secretary, Miss Edith Clawson. Mrs. Joseph W. Dora had charge of the various lines of work of the National League for Woman's Service.\n\nVarious units of these organizations were formed throughout Butler county as follows : Stockton, Mrs. C. A. Smalley ; Gano, Mrs. Carrie Howard; Pisgah, Mrs. Lillian Sertel; Oxford, Miss Jennie Richey; Reily, Mrs. C. B. Clark; Ross, Miss Myrna Brown; Woods, Mrs. Wayne Stevenson; Hanover, Mrs. Charles Robinson and Mrs. C. Beiser; Millville, Mrs. J. D. Cochran; Westchester, Mrs. G. M. Meek; Overpeck, Mrs. Edward Craig; East Fairfeld, Mrs. J. Wesley Morris ; Maude, Mrs. G. Wirsh ; Rochdale, Mrs. Charles Frederick; Indian Creek, Mrs. Cora Wardell; Shandon, Miss Edith Norris; Darrtown, Mrs. George Hansel; Okeana, Mrs. Hazel De Armond; Princeton, Mrs. Salem Clawson; Bethany, Mrs. M. J. Staford; Collinsville, Mrs. C. B. Muf; Seven Mile, Mrs. S. B. Wilson; Port Union, Mrs. Grace Bramble; Heitsman Hill, Mrs. Charles Von Stein; Symmes Corner, Mrs. David Weisenborn; LeSourdsville, Mrs. C. E. Banthhouse.\n\nThe Red Cross. As in all loyal communities the Red Cross quickly responded to the country's call for service. When the demand came for hospital supplies this work was directed by Mrs. Eugene S. Griffs and 30,000 garments were made and shipped. Mrs. Edward C. Solingen was in charge of the surgical dressings and she and her associates made and shipped 108,000 articles. Mrs. Walter S. Harlan was the able supervisor of the refugee work and she and the women assisting her made and shipped 32,000 needed, garments. , The direction of the knitting work was in (page 513) the hands of Mrs. Herman Kutter and this. department made 12,000 articles. Much of this work required careful cutting which was done under the direction of Mrs. Darrell Joyce. Miss Caroline Margedant was the executive secretary, with Miss Kathleen Millikin as assistant, of the Home Service Section of the Red Cross. This section gave friendly care to the soldiers, sailors and marines and their families through hundreds of calls, thousands of letters; the expenditure of relief money wherever needed, the making of applications for allowance of the bonus, insurance, compensation and allotments; in giving information, legal aid and medical and nursing assistance, involving every form of friendly assistance and counsel required by the daily exigencies of hundreds of families deprived of the head of the house or the returned man himself, or his need, in camp or in Europe. The nursing service was in charge of Mrs. Howard Heyman, with the Misses Marie Danaher and Katherine Ellison as instructor in home hygiene ; and Miss Gussie Pfau as instructor in dietetics. This department conducted the registration of nurses, and a campaign for student nurses furnished a nursing corps during the influenza epidemic in the autumn of 1918; and graduated more than 400 women from the several classes in hygiene conducted under its direction.\n\nThe Junior Red Cross consisted of a countrywide organization of school children with Mrs. Walter S. Harlan in charge of the supplies and Miss Jessie Cavanaugh as secretary and treasurer. All materials furnished for war work were carefully conserved under the direction of Mrs. Joe Wolf, to whom the chairman of all departments and sewing units reported.\n\nIn the conservation of food campaigns, the women were organized in many units, all of which faithfully worked in the distribution of literature, the giving of personal instructions and the doing of all things which would conduce to the saving of foodstuffs. The general campaign for the conservation of food was conducted under the personal direction of George M. Verity, president of the American Rolling Mill company of Middletown.\n\nIn the woman's auxiliary to CampSherman, Mrs. Charles J. Parrish was divisional chairman; Mrs. S. D. Fitton, sr., vice-chairman; Mrs. Herman Kutter, secretary and treasurer. Butler county was the first county in the southwest district of Ohio to complete its quota for the community house erected at CampSherman. The Ladies' Aid Society of the First Methodist Episcopal church, under the direction of Mrs. Eugene S. Griffis and Mrs. Edgar A. Belden, completely fitted out Y. M. C. A. Hut, No. 6, at CampSherman.\n\nThe Hi-Y club, composed of high school, Y. W. C. A. girls, with Miss Louise Stevenson, Miss Katherine Howald, Miss Ruth Wolf and Miss Marion Wolf as leaders, adopted 100 French orphans and aided in the many drives for war work and in various Red Cross projects.\n\nThe sisters of Notre Dame stationed at Notre Dame academy were also active, especially in raising a large fund for the mother house at Namur.\n\n(page 514) The John Reily Chapter, Daughters of the American Revolution, Mrs. David Pierce, regent, met all assigned quotas in money, garments and duties. They knitted for the Navy League, worked on surgical dressings and refugee garments for the Red Cross, aided the fatherless children of France, and maintained a committee for work for devastated France, the D. A. R. Lodge at CampSherman and other activities.\n\nOne of the interesting organizations of women during the war was the Second Ward Minute Men, formed through the personal efforts of Miss Lillian Becker. This organization consisted of a remarkable precinct and block organization available for every drive and campaign which the war made necessary. Miss Becker also did a great deal of work for the Hamilton draft board.\n\nThe Y. W. C. A. took up every activity inaugurated by its national organization and through its industrial clubs and sewing classes aided the Red Cross in- the production of materials it was called upon to furnish.\n\nThe Ladies' Auxiliary and the Liberty Ladies also did much production work under the direction of the Red Cross.\n\nCouncil of Defense. With Mrs. Joseph W. Doran as chairman of the Women's National Council of Defense, this organization also did a great war work. The infant welfare and baby conservation work were taken up under the direction of Miss Isabel Beardsley. A Liberty Loan committee, with Mrs. Lynn Forbes as chairman, more than met the quotas assigned to it in the sale of Liberty bonds.\n\nThe National League for Woman's Service was also directed by Mrs. Joseph W. Doran. It adopted all the young men going out from Butler county and provided each with knitted outfits and housewives. A special knitting league was organized under the direction of Mrs. L. D. McGinley and a housewives and comfort bag section under the direction of Mrs. Catherine Sohngen. These made more than 75,000 articles and spent over $5,000 for needed supplies.\n\nThe Canteen Service had Mrs. Clarence H. Helvey and Mrs. Maurice Moore as chairmen; Mrs. John F. Neilan, treasurer; and Mrs. Harry L. Sohngen, secretary. This was an organization of 350 women under ten captains in ten companies of thirty members each, who worked for the National League for Women's Service and the Red Cross. These women raised $2,500 for the league, gave two dinners for the soldiers ; packed 35,000 pounds of clothing for the Belgians ; sent 600 boxes of goodies to CampSherman hospitals ; distributed literature in a house-to-house campaign for the Hamilton War Chest ; formed a motor corps during the influenza epidemic ; and helped in every call that came from any source. The War Hospital Library work was under the direction of Miss Berta. E. Shafer and Mrs. William B. Shuler. This service made and shipped more than 63,000 booklets to the hospitals chiefly in Europe, for the use of sick and wounded soldiers.\n\nThe Old Silver committee, under the direction of Mrs. Luella Frechtling and Mrs. G. C. Morey made a collection of old silver to raise funds for the league.\n\n(page 515) The food conservation work of the league was done under the direction of a committee of which Mrs. G. C. Morey was chairman. Home gardens were encouraged, canning demonstrations were given and everything possible was done to aid in the conservation of food.\n\nThe Nurses. A number of Hamilton's self-sacrificing and loyal young women joined the young men of the community in the call to the colors and became nurses, many of them seeing active service overseas. The Misses Cecelia Duerr, Louise Hoerner, Romilda Martin and Pearl Schisler and Mrs. Lulu Belle Martin Pippy served with the Cincinnati Base hospital, No. 25. Mrs. Julia Goodman McClellan was with a Chicago Base hospital, while Miss Leona Tully served at Ellis Island, New York.\n\nOther Activities. When the conservation of food became a necessity in the winning of the war and Herbert C. Hoover formed the nation-wide campaign to secure the desired results, C. M. Eikenberry was made the food director for Butler county. He performed faithfully every duty that was required of him and did much to aid in solving the food problems of the people of the county.\n\nWhen, during the winter of 1917-1918, the fuel situation became acute, Darrell Joyce was placed in charge. Mr. Joyce is a man of action and Butler county received coal in sufficient quantities to meet its immediate needs. He strictly enforced the lightless nights and fuelless Mondays, but also saw to it, despite the many handicaps he faced, that the homes of the people were kept supplied with coal.\n\nMany Campaigns. During the progress of the war many drives for funds for various purposes became a necessity. The first great drive was conducted during the latter part of October and the early part of November, 1917, to raise funds for the Y. M. C. A. and kindred organizations. This campaign was conducted with much vigor under the personal influence and direction of judge Clarence Murphy. This campaign resulted in the raising of $50,438.53 for the Y. M. C. A.; $3,500 for the Y. W. C. A.; and $6,700 for the K. of C.; and $5,000 for the Woman's League. Later, however, it was determined that numerous drives for various funds would be inadvisable and the scheme was devised for the 'Hamilton War Chest. Judge Clarence Murphy was prevailed upon to again take charge of the campaign. He surrounded himself with more than 100 of the loyal men of Hamilton, who sacrificed their personal interests, their business and deprived themselves of many pleasures, while they performed a noble work. While the goal in this campaign was set for $400,000, more than $500,000 was contributed.\n\nHowever, previous to this, there was a drive in September of 1917 for funds for the Red Cross which resulted in $40,387 being raised, while in May of 1918, the Red Cross was awarded $50,000 and in November of 1919, $10,000 from the War Chest. The direct drives for Red Cross membership in Butler county were always successful. The first drive was in June, 1917, shortly after the United States had entered the war, and resulted in the development of a large membership which contributed $12,075 to its funds. The second membership drive was conducted in December, 1917, and (page 516) resuited in the collection of $10,545 in membership fees. The third membership campaign brought in a revenue of $12,845; while in November of 1919, the third annual roll call of the Red Cross, was successfully conducted and resulted in a membership fund of over $10,000.\n\nThe War Savings Stamps and Thrift Campaigns in Butler county were under the direction of Ernest G. Ruder, who was ably assisted by the public and parochial schools and various church, fraternal and civic organizations. The first campaign in 1918 resulted in the sale of more than $1,100,000 worth of war savings and thrift stamps.\n\nOthers who gave service during the World war were Frank F. Wessel and James De Haven. Mr. De Haven went overseas. Rev. Craig Schwartz, pastor of the Lindenwald Church of Christ, served as a camp pastor at CampSherman. John L. Prosser, former boys' work secretary of the Y. M. C. A. was in charge of many of the sports and physical culture work at CampSherman. Louis Ross served with the Royal Flying Corps of Great Britain, attaining the rank of a lieutenant. Clarence Monroe Burnett, a Hamilton man, located in Indianapolis, Indiana, served as a Y. M. C. A. secretary overseas.\n\nButlerCounty's Honor Roll. Those killed in action were : Frank Durwin, Henry Denman, Philip Robertson, Earl Bolser, Glen Wagner, Thomas E. Best, Ralph H.

The Middletown Chapter, American Red Cross, did a noble work during the great world war. It was organized immediately after- the United States entered the titanic conflict and is still engaged in the noble work then undertaken. The first war fund campaign was conducted in June, 1917, and through this campaign, Middletown became world-renowned as an egg and poultry market, when a dozen eggs and a hen were sold at auction for $2,002 as a feature of the first drive of the Red Cross for its war fund. This sale came as a unique climax to an innovation springing from the gift of a humble Slav woman, who gave all that she could afford, eleven eggs, and promised to complete the dozen with the aid of her never-failing hens. On the following day the twelfth egg arrived at Red Cross headquarters, with the hen which had laid it. The eggs, when offered for sale, brought from $50 to $400 each, while the hen herself realized $266. Such prices were never paid before in Middletown for poultry or for eggs. On the first drive for funds, with a quota of only $20,000, the total amount raised reached $113,630.70. In the second drive, in June, 1918, with a quota of $40,000, the total amount raised was $129,638. The first membership campaign, conducted in December, 1917, showed a total enrollment of 11,484, while the second membership roll call in December, 1918, showed an enrollment of 10,865.\n\nThe women of Middletown were the first locally to organize for war work, when a self-appointed committee took up the subject. This committee met on the morning of Monday, June 11, 1917, at the headquarters of the Middletown Chamber of Commerce. A local chapter of the American Red Cross was organized with Colin Gardner, jr., chairman; Charles R. Hook vice chairman, and William O. Barnitz, treasurer. An executive committee was also named, consisting of George M. Verity, chairman ; Charles Aull, W. P. Butterfueld, W. A. Eudaly, R. B. Carnahan, T. A. D. Jones, Charles R. Miller, Calvin W. Verity, Mark Solingen, William G. Griffiths, Henry Naegele, Rev. E. P. Hickey, Dr. G. D. Lummis, Dr. J. G. Grafy, Prof. W. Q. Brown ; with Colin Gardner, jr., Charles R. Hook, W. 0. Barnitz and J. A. Finnegan, ex ofcio members.\n\nVarious committees were placed in charge of the several activities undertaken for the war. These included the committees on membership, Calvin W. Verity, chairman ; purchasing committee, Robert Gardner, chairman ; permanent publicity and speakers, Bennett Chapple, chairman ; military relief committee, Dr. G. D. Lummis, chairman ; junior Red Cross, Prof. R. W. Solomon, chairman ; auditing committee, C. W. Davis and M. S. Johnson, chairman and vice chairman ; finance committee, George M. Verity, chairman ; civilian relief and home service, Selby C. Folks, chairman ; executive secretary, Miss E. Marie Reynolds, chairman ; military supplies, Miss Sara Verity, chairman.\n\nThe military supplies committee, of which Miss Sara Verity was chairman, had a very efficient organization, with Mrs. Wampler Denny, first vice chairman and chairman of the shirt department; Mrs. Dick Snider, second vice chairman, and chairman of the pajama (page 518) department; Mrs. Howard Wilson, third vice chairman, and chairman of the knitting department ; Mrs. Edward T. Gardner, purchaser and storeroom chairman ; Mrs. Douglass Robbins, secretary; Mrs. John B. Tytus, chairman of auxiliaries; Miss Bessie Harding, chairman of packing committee ; Miss Hazel Dearth, chairman of layettes committee ; Mrs. Mary Dearth, chairman of army pads ; Mrs. George M. Verity, chairman of first line packets ; Mrs. Charles R. Hook, chairman of gauze department, and Mrs. William Stringham, second chairman of the pajama department.\n\nThe women of Middletown were first organized in war work under the National Surgical Dressings committee. This committee was formed at a mass meeting called by the Girls' Welfare association on April 9, 1917, followed by a meeting several days later with Mrs. G. H. Charls, the general chairman, presiding, when the first board of directors was formed. This board soon whipped sub-committees into shape and on April 30 the first work rooms donated by Henry P. Leibee, in the Leibee building, were opened. Just two weeks later ;the first box was packed and sent, and after inspection in the New York headquarters, the work was approved as perfect. During the summer months this work continued and increased under the guidance of Mrs. W. H. Dearth, who had charge of the rooms. Various units were formed to work outside the headquarters, and the Mathes-Sohngen girls were among the first to suggest this means of aiding the general output. Meantime the cost of material became increasingly alarming and many projects were formed to make possible a continuation of the work. Mrs. Sabin Robbins, jr., was in charge of the buying of all materials until the work was consolidated with that of the Red Cross. Until November, the materials used were paid for entirely out of funds raised by the ladies of Middletown. Including donations which were very generous, and registration fees, the funds amounted, at the end of October, to more than $6,000, and 98,671 surgical dressings had been shipped.\n\nDuring the first part of November, Mrs. G. H. Charls resigned her chairmanship, and Miss Sara Verity was chosen as her successor by the Girls' Welfare association. Miss Verity apv%^;\"teA_ as her vice chairmen Mrs. Wampler Denny, Mrs. Dick Snider and Mrs. Howard Wilson, with Mrs. E. T. Gardner as official purchaser. It became immediately evident that it was the patriotic duty of this committee to join forces with the American Red Cross, and at a general meeting presided over by Mrs. Sanford, director of women's work of the Lake division, held in the Methodist church, the consolidation took place. From this time on, the Middletown chapter was under the direction of the Lake division of the American Red Cross. The finished dressings were shipped sometimes through the warehouse in Cincinnati and often directly to Cleveland. Miss Agnes Reeve, the field supervisor of the district, gave unlimited assistance to the officers of the committee and made possible the high standard of the work produced.\n\nJoining the Red Cross organization necessitated a complete change in the kind of dressings being made and in order to keep up the standard of the work already set, there were two Red Cross (page 519) classes formed among the workers. These classes were taught by instructors from Cincinnati.\n\nA card campaign for workers, through which the city was completely canvassed, was carried on by the committee, with Mrs. G. H. Charls as chairman, with great success. The equipment of the workrooms was gradually perfected.\n\nIn order to be ready for Christmas, a committee was appointed with Mrs. Mary C. McCoy as chairman, early in November, to take charge of the packages for soldiers overseas and in the camps. Over five hundred of these packages were donated and shipped the first of December.\n\nIn December the committee decided, to appoint an auxiliary chairman, since the number of outside auxiliaries had increased to eleven. These included those formed not only in Middletown, but in adjoining towns, such as Monroe and Trenton, while a great many clubs desired to take up the work. Mrs. John Tytus accepted the appointment, and from this time on the outside work was taken care of in a very systematic and business-like way. In March the headquarters were moved from the Leibee building to the second floor of the Eagles' building.\n\nIn the spring of 1918, a complete reorganization took place, a step which became necessary because of the increasing obligations and the growth of the organization. In place of the old executive board, a new executive board was formed, consisting of a general chairman, three vice chairmen, the chairman of each auxiliary and the chairman of each department. This committee formed a sound working basis, and after a second card campaign for workers had been successfully conducted by Mrs. Fred Vorhis, the output reached its height, the record one week being twenty boxes.\n\nIn April the ladies' committee was asked to take charge of an old clothes drive for the Belgians. Mrs. C. F. Kendle took charge and at the end of two weeks forty cases had been packed and shipped. At the executive board meeting in April, Mrs. Dearth's resignation was accepted and a unanimous vote of thanks given her for her patriotic, efficient and loyal cooperation and service. Alice blue veils were introduced in the work rooms in May, 1918, to be worn by the chairman each day and the chairmen of the auxiliaries. This added to the efficiency of the work.\n\nAt various times special orders were received, one of them being for three hundred diphtheria masks. The surgical dressings work, after April, 1918, was confined mostly to army orders. In May two events of interest took place : a parade, in which all Red Cross workers participated, and a dinner on May 7 at the Elks' club for over two hundred ladies of the Red Cross. On June 10, 1918, the executive committee accepted the first regular quota of work from the Cleveland headquarters. The order, with the knitting in charge of Mrs. Howard Wilson, was completed by September 1.\n\nThe next definite work was a linen drive, under the direction of Mrs. C. B. Oglesby. The influenza epidemic resulted in a slowing down of the work in the fall of 1918, but the boys still in France were sent more than one thousand Christmas boxes.\n\n(page 520) On January 6, 1919, at a meeting of the executive committee, all knitting and surgical dressing work was brought to an end. The army dressings then under way were finished and shipped to Cleveland, while the remaining surgical dressings were given to the Middletown hospital."
