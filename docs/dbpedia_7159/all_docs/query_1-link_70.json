Reuben A. Riley, Henry Snow and others, who made a circuit of the county to stir up enthusiasm in the enlistment. A company was organized and mustered in at Indianapolis on April 22, 1861, as Company G of the Eighth regiment, Indiana volunteers (three-months service). The muster roll is as follows:\n\nReuben A. Riley- captain\n\nJohn Stephenson- first lieutenant\n\nLee O. Harris- second lieutenant\n\nJohn M. Stevenson, first sergeant\n\nMarion M. Stevenson, Pilatiah Bond, John S.

P. Williams, Miss Alice Pierson, Miss Martha Meek and others. The flag was made in the house now occupied by Mrs. Permelia Thayer, on the north-east corner of Main and Pennsylvania streets in the city of Greenfield.\n\nThe \"three-months men\" were mustered out on August 6, 1861, after having been as far east as Virginia, and having participated in the engagement at Rich Mountain in that state. Many of them, however, re-enlisted at once for a period of three years, or during the war.\n\nADDENDUM: Martin Stephenson died July 20, 1861, of wounds, at Rich Mountain Virginia. James Buchanan, wounded at Rich Mountain, Virginia, July 11, 1861. Samuel Dye died of wounds at Indianapolis, May 18, 1861. Andrew Stutsman, wounded at Rich Mountain Virginia, July 11, 1861.)\n\nTHE VETERANS OF THE CIVIL WAR\n\nIt is exceeding difficult, if not impossible, to make a complete roll of the men who enlisted as volunteers from this county and who were among the veterans of the Civil War. By far the great majority of our boys enlisted in Indiana regiments. But many, who were temporarily absent from home, also enlisted in other states, and Indiana has no record of their names. In going over the records in the adjutant-generals office, page by page, it is still practically impossible to make a correct roll, since in so many instances the record is incomplete, failing to show the residence of the men. In such cases personal acquaintance would be required with each man to determine accurately to which county he belongs.\n\nBelow is given the roll of enlisted men from our county as nearly correct as we have been able to make it. Some of the men who enlisted as private soldiers were later commissioned as officers. Others were transferred to different regiments. Some of the officers were also promoted from time to time. This accounts for some names appearing several times, especially in the companies that were filled almost entirely with Hancock county boys. The men have been grouped in companies, showing their associations during the war.\n\nAmong those who always claimed Hancock county as their home, but who were not credited to this county, were Gen. Oliver P. Gooding, who was for many years in the regular army, but who was appointed colonel of a Massachusetts regiment during the war, and who rose to the rank of brigadier-general. Adams L. Ogg, who was in Iowa, organized a company there and was captain of Company G, Third Iowa volunteers.\n\nThe following men enlisted and were credited to Hancock county:\n\nFIFTH CAVALRY, 19TH REGIMENT, INDIANA VOLUNTEERS\n\nCompany G.\n\nReuben A.

Many were in Arkansas, Missouri, with Grant along the Mississippi, with Thomas, Rosecrans and Buell, in Kentucky and Tennessee and a very large number were with Sherman on his famous march to the sea. In the latter part of the war these troops were, of course, with Sherman and Grant in the eastern field. But what the veterans of the Civil War have done has been written large on the pages of the nations history, and no attempt will be made to detail that story here.\n\nIt was a common practice for the men at the front to return their savings to their families from time to time. Frequently a number of them who had come from the same locality sent their money in one amount to some person in whom all had confidence. In February, 1863, for instance, the men of Company B, Eighth Regiment, forwarded to Capt. A. K. Branham one thousand, eight hundred and twenty dollars to be distributed to persons in various parts of the county. We cannot know at this time just whose money was included in this amount, but after a large part of it has been distributed Captain Branham inserted a notice in the Hancock Democrat that the money belonging to the following persons would be sent as directed by them: William Everson, Abram Hanes, Thomas Lake, Mrs. Mary A. Snell, New Palestine; Samuel Fuller, Cordelia Shelton, Catherine Jones, Julia Scotten, Philadelphia; Hamilton Welling, Christian Kreager, Cumberland; John M. Miller, Rebecca Davis, Cleveland; John Jackson, Pendleton; John Roney, Mt. Comfort.\n\nIn October, 1863, Andrew T. Hart received a package containing one thousand, one hundred and thirty-seven dollars from Company B, Ninety-ninth regiment, for the following persons: Benjamin Reeves, Lysander Sparks, Rosannah Hamilton, James Milner, Phoebe True, Jesse Allen, Louise E. Shaw, Mary C. Curry, William Watts, Thomas Bright, Margaret Milner, Sarah Curry, Sarah Milner, Elizabeth Reagan, J. H. Curry, Daniel Butter field, Susanna Redman, Eleanor Hudson, L. J. Youse, Elizabeth Cass, Catherine McGuire, Joseph Morford, Martha Tibbits, Willard Lowe.\n\nThese instances might be multiplied, but they illustrate the practice of the soldiers in sending home their money, either for the use of their families, or to be saved until their return from the war.\n\nSome of the personal experiences of the boys, however, and something of their military life, is reflected from the following letters. The first two letters, from Lee O. Harris and R. A. Riley, give the experiences of the company of \"three-months men\" who went to the front from Hancock county. The third letter, from Samuel A. Dunbar, gives a good idea of the campaigning of Company B, Eighth regiment, in Arkansas, while the last one, written by a member of Company B, ninety-ninth regiment, comes from the field of heavy fighting around Missionary Ridge.\n\n\"Camp Benton, VA., June 25,61\n\nEditor Hancock Democrat and friends at home:\n\nI am now writing in the shade of a tree, in Camp Benton, which is situated on one of the highest hills in Western Virginia. Below me lies a beautiful valley, stretching between the lofty hills. A beautiful stream winds its way through it, while at the foot of the hill on which our camp is situated, lies the town of Clarksburg, the capital of Western Virginia. It has a beautiful site, situated her on the summit of this lofty hill, the valley lying in quiet beauty below me, and mountain on mountain piled to the clouds ands stretching away in every direction as far as the eye can reach. Both regiments are encamped upon this hill, and are now busy fortifying it. A wall, breast-high, is now almost completed, extending entirely around the hill, and a battery of six cannon is stationed on one side. Our position is one of the strongest natural defenses I have ever seen and commands the whole of the surrounding country. The enemy have no access to the town except over the mouth of our cannon, a hard road to travel, I believe.\n\nA regiment of the Ohio troops arrived in town today; there was a regiment here before we arrived, and another picketed along the railroad from Parkersburg to Grafton. The boys are all in fine spirits and eager for the fight, though I do not anticipate an attack at this point, now that we are all so well prepared. It is reported that ex-Governor Wise is on Laurel Ridge, about thirty miles from here, with five thousand men, yet, in this position we do not fear twenty thousand. Several secessionists have been captured and brought into camp, but released on swearing allegiance to the government. Having given you a general description of our camp, I will go back and tell you how we got here.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, June 19, I was awakened about three oclock by the blowing of trumpets, rattling of drums and shouting of men; such a noise I have never heard before. It sounded like the howling of fiends or the midnight orgies of devils. On inquiring the cause I learned that we had received our marching orders and, notwithstanding I am a quiet man in the main, I was infected with the general joy and shouted long and loud. I ran to the door of my tent and saw soldiers running, jumping, turning handsprings and summersets, and making the most extravagant demonstrations of joy. They were considerate enough to leave off, however, as soon as all were completely exhausted, and the longest winded could not shout above a whisper. Shortly after breakfast we began to take down our tents and pack our baggage, and before noon we marched to Indianapolis, where we embarked on the cars, and taking the Lawrenceburg & Cincinnati railroad, we were soon flying on our course on the wings of steam, followed by the shouts of hundreds who had collected to see us off. Everywhere along the road it appeared as if the whole community had collected along the track and greeted us with shouts and waving of hats and handkerchiefs. At Greensburg the patriotic citizens were awaiting us, and as soon as the train stopped, the cars were surrounded by detachments armed with well charged baskets, buckets and pitchers, and immediately began the attack, filling our haversacks with provisions of every imaginable kind. Our men faced the music like heroes and pitched into the eatables with a will. Long life and great happiness to the noble hearts of Greensburg! May heaven bless them as they deserve! At six oclock we arrived at Cincinnati. Here we were met by the city military, amounting to nearly two thousand, who escorted us to the Fifth street market house, where we were regaled with a splendid supper. All Cincinnati was alive with excitement; the streets were crowded from one end of town to the other, and at every turn the cry was, Huzza for the Indiana troops! Huzza for the Eight and Tenth! On the corner, near the market house, was a banner with this inscription, Cincinnatians Welcome to the Noble Sons of Indiana: May God bless and preserve you! We marched from the market house to the Marietta & Cincinnati railroad and embarked on the cars, where we lay all night, and on the next morning started for Marietta, a town about two hundred and fifty miles up the river. Through Ohio we were met and welcomed with the same demonstrations of joy that we witnessed in Indiana. At Chillicothe we were welcomed with another attack of provisions and good things. We arrived at Marietta about dark, when we were marched on board of steamboats, where we lay all night. Next morning we sailed down the river to Parkersburg, where we remained until Saturday night, when we embarked on board the cars on the Baltimore & Ohio railway and started en route for this place, arriving here on Saturday about noon, where we are likely to remain for some time. You shall hear from me again soon if my life is spared to write.\n\n\"Beverly, Va., July 14, 1861\n\nMr. Editor-Dear Sir:\n\nSince our march from Indianapolis, such has been the constant hurry and bustle, care and toil, that I have never had time to write when I could command paper and ink, that I have not written you before. We first set foot on Virginias sacred soil at Parkersburg, the third day from Indianapolis, from thence two days after to Clarksburg by railroad through tunnels of pitchy darkness and over dizzy precipices. The road was guarded all along. At Clarksburg (the capital of western Virginia (we took possession of a hill about three hundred feet high, immediately south of the town, commenced to fortify it, and about 1 oclock A.M. Capt. Loomes flying battery six pieces arrived. It was hauled to the foot of the hill, and there we took it apart, attached long ropes, and piece at a time, with two hundred men to a piece, pulled it up to the top, and by daylight had cannon, ammunition and all in position on the hill, and commanding the whole surrounding town and country within its range. We then resumed work on our fortification, and by night had a breastwork from six to ten feet high, for nearly a mile, in an oblong circle. The traitors had prepared to burn the town, and expel or hang all Union men there, the day after our arrival. We were too quick for them, and they fell back to a pass called the Valley of Death, in the Rich Mountain, within five miles of Beverly, where they were strongly fortified at a pass called Camp Garnett, one and one-half miles further on the Beverly road, and at the Valley of Death they had breastworks of logs and rocks, probably 400 yards in length and two pieces of artillery (that we captured). I think they had three. At 4 P.M. on the 50th, six companies of the 8th and 10th Indiana Volunteers marched to the advance, on hearing that they were coming to give us battle. We took our position in advance of our encampment-consisting of eight regiments-in line of battle but the rebels went back to their holes again. The 8th regiment, that is, six companies of it, held their position on the field for the night, and Company I, consisting of 53 men, rank and file-33 of Company I, and 20 of Company E-took the picket guard, running a chain of sentinels within two hundred and fifty-nine yards of their fortification, and then transversely with the same, and remaining sleeplessly vigilant the entire night. Just after daylight on the morning of the 11th, six companies of the 8th, 10th, and 13th Indiana, and the 19th Ohio regiments filed right leaving the road, without cutting one for their access, and climbed over Rich Mountain, through heavy woods, barrens, thickets, among the laurel and huckleberries, among rocks, cliff and precipices, on dizzy heights and sightless depths, a distance of from 12 to 15 miles, entirely flanking and surprising the enemy in the Valley of Death.\n\nWe arrived on the battlefield at about half-past 1 P.M., when the picket fired on our advance guard led by Capt. Chris. Miller, of the 10th, severely if not fatally wounding him, and also wounding severely in the arm one of his men. The skirmish then commenced, on our side, while round shot, bombs, and spherical-case shells hissed and bursted over our heads. We continued skirmishing for over an hour, waiting for the Ohio regiment to come up, to get our positions, and for the cessation of one of the heaviest rains I have ever seen fall. Thus drenched and chilled, the Ohio regiment came up the mountain in sight and the rain ceased, when the 10th Indiana regiment engaged their left wing out of good range of their artillery. The left wing of the 8th lay right in line, view and range of their artillery, when they fired a shell that exploded directly over them (the 8th), then a round shot that went through a tree about 12 feet over the heads of the 8th. I told Col. Benton that the enemy had a point blank range on the regiment, and to let the regiment lie down. The command was given and the boys dropped, when instantly a charge of grape poured over them, about breast high but harmless. The enemy cheered, thinking the regiment was cut to pieces (as the afterward told me) while indeed the boys were lying like crouching tigers, waiting for the command to pounce upon them. We remained there for about half an hour, when the word came, and the boys went down the hill over rocks, logs and brush, firing and advancing, without much order-for that was impossible, from the nature of the ground-but with terrible precision, shooting with direct aim at every moving object distinguishable in the smoke before them. Then followed the most sublime and terrible concerted regimental firing that ever waked the echoes of that old mountain. Company I, commanded by Lieut. Walls, directed their fire upon the gunners of their artillery, and leaving but one standing, and him wounded in the hand and side. Then the rush from the cannon from both sides, when our men hoisted one poor fellow off of the cannon with their bayonets. The enemy gave way, and the retreat commenced, and firing after and pursuit. Neither of the latter continued long. Then came the congratulations over the victory, mixed with the groans and cries of the wounded and dying, then the searching and care for the wounded. Then a collection and burial of the pale and bloody dead. The busy and bloody-handed surgeons, with lint, chords, bandages, saw, scalpels, probes and bullet forceps were busy bandaging and dressing what could be saved, and amputation hopelessly shattered and lacerated limbs. I walked over a part of the battlefield that evening, and I hope never again to witness such a sight of blood and carnage. At one large rock about 20 feet long behind which the enemy had concealed, shooting over, there laid piled upon and across one another, sixteen men, every one of whom was shot through the brain. I will not further attempt to describe the carnage. The enemy had between 1,800 and 2,200, with two pieces of artillery which we captured. The six companies of the 8th, 10th, and 13th Indiana Regiments. amounting to about 1,500 to 1,700 men, did the fighting, the Ohio being held mainly in reserve, and coming in just as the close.\n\nThe counted dead of the enemy on the field is 131 and is doubtless more than double that number, as many were seen carried off. Some were found in the bushes and coal banks and among the rocks over a quarter of a mile from their breastworks. We have about 900 prisoners, six pieces of artillery, a large amount of small arms, seventy-two wagons, and from $60,000 to $100,000 worth of captured military property. Upon the rebels being so terribly defeated, slaughtered and routed at the Valley of Death, they fled into the mountain-they abandoned their arms, camp tents, ammunition and fortifications at Camp Garnett, one and a half miles distant and in the night left all, some even throwing away their blankets and coats and fled to the mountains. They also fled from Beverly, five miles distant. The next day a flag of truce was sent in and seven hundred who had been in the battle, came in a body, stacked their arms, and surrendered themselves prisoners of war. They, with those taken in the battle and since swelled their numbers to about 900, as before stated.\n\nI am informed, by a messenger from there, that General Morris captured 1,800 rebels at Laurel Hill, together with their cannon, arms, and military stores, on the next day after the battle. Yesterday a detachment was sent from here to Stanton, twelve miles form here, and a messenger came back today saying they had fled panic stricken from there.\n\nThe war in western Virginia is ended for the present, if not forever.\n\nNone of Company I were killed or missing. Sergeant M. M. Stephenson was severely wounded by a musket ball a little above the right knee, the ball passing below the bone without breaking it. The hemorrhage was great, but upon its being staunched, reaction took place, and he is now doing well, and will probably recover without material lameness or injury. James Buchanan was wounded in the fleshy part of the hip, just above the hip joint, but got up, straightened his leg, tried it, cursed the traitors, and fought on with redoubled energy. Andrew Stutsman was wounded on the knee by a fall on the rocks while making the charge. Charles Weaver had his wrist bruised and sprained by the bark and splinters knocked from a tree near which he was, by grape shot. All who were in the battle were brave to a fault. Our boys were much fatigued and exhausted by hunger, cold, rain, watching, marching and fighting, but are getting rested and ready for more work if needed soon. The health of most of them is tolerable, some are suffering with diarrhea and some with flux. Three or four are in the hospital, none dangerous I think.\n\nWhile I have been telling of the enemys heavy losses, etc., I had almost forgotten to speak of our own. Thirteen of the Indiana troops were killed, and about forty wounded.\n\nMy own health is poor and broken down. Five days ago I was taken with diarrhea, and from weakness, loss of sleep, hunger, and the long, toilsome march over the mountain, and the sudden cold and heavy rain, I sat down, cramping and exhausted, by a tree, in the midst of the battle, delivering the command to Lieut. William R. Walls, who gallantly led the boys through the balance of the fight. Shot, shells, grape, musket and rifle balls were bursting and hissing over and around me. There is an excitement and sublimity in a well contested battle, that can neither be appreciated or realized by any one who has not witnessed it and participated in it. Our boys who were left behind to guard the camp, and too sick to make the toilsome march, are filled with regret and chagrin because circumstances forbade their participation in the fight.\n\nWe expect to be home again in a few weeks, bringing Company I back without the loss of a man. My paper is exhausted. My compliments and love to all.\n\nR. A. Riley\"\n\n\"Helena, Ark., July 14, 1862\n\nDear Mitchell-\n\nHaving had no opportunity for a long time to write to you, or anybody else, and supposing that our friends are anxious to hear from us, I hasten to write you. I joined my regiment at Sulphur Rock, on the 11th of June, and on the 22nd we left there for Clarendon, on White river, to join our gun boats. We approached said point by easy marches, until the day we entered Augusta, when we marched eighteen miles. The day after we arrived, at 2 oclock in the morning, Companies A and B, of the 8th, under command of Maj. Thomas Brady, and a battalion of cavalry, commanded by Col. Baker of the 1st Indiana, by special order, went in search of a regiment of rebels, mostly conscripts, under Col. Matleck. After a march of ten miles we came upon their camp freshly evacuated. The infantry deployed as skirmishers in the cane brake, which is the hottest and hardest work ever the lot of man to perform. We remained thus for two miles, rallying at a point on the river, three miles above a ferry where the butternuts were crossing. Col. Baker hastened forward, arriving a little too late, but in time to fire one of his mountain howitzers, killing two and dispersing them in every direction. He took their camp equipage and provisions. While this was going on Maj. Brady heard of a train concealed four miles above our position in the cane brake, and of course we made for it. We found five wagons richly laden with the good things fixed up by the special friends for palates of the traitors. They didnt get it. We eat our supper, saved our breakfasts, and turned the balance over. This was on the Fourth of July. On the 5th we returned to camp, arriving tired and worn out. The next morning at two oclock we left camp and marched sixteen miles, halting on the bank of Cache river. The road on each side of the stream having been blockaded by the rebels cutting timber across it,- a game they have played until it is played out. When our advance arrived at this point a small party of them, concealed in the blockade, fired upon the guard, hitting nobody. Our men killed one, who fell into our hands, and knocked seven off their horses, but they got away badly wounded or dead. Lieut. Hill, who commands the pioneers of the brigade, went to work on the blockade and in two hours had a road cut through and the troops passing over. In the morning a portion of the 11 Wisconsin and 1st Indiana Cavalry went out upon the road in advance to feel for the Texas Rangers, who we knew were in the neighborhood. About noon they came upon about two thousand of the gentlemen lying along the side of the road. Our boys went into them with fury, both sides fighting like fiends. More cavalry and the 33d Illinois were ordered forward first, and then the 8th. We arrived upon the ground and drove the rebels five miles, when night came on, and they got away from us. News of this fight spread like wild fire through rebeldom, and upon our arrival here we found that transports had been sent from Memphis to Clarendon, to gather up the remnant of our army, supposed to be cut to pieces and in a starving condition. The rebels everywhere throw it in our faces, and crowed loudly. Poor, deceived fools, why did they not know the true result of the engagement? We found nearly 200 of their dead upon the field, and their wounded filling every house along the road. Our loss was between forty and fifty,-eight killed and the balance wounded. The night after the fight we encamped beyond Cotton Plant, on a bayou. The next day we marched to Clarendon, a distance of 35 miles, under the hot sun of this climate, and through the deepest sand and the thickest and most suffocating dust. For miles we had to march without water, and when we did get any it was swamp water, the filthiest you ever saw in any swamp. This march beats everything in our military history, and had we not been ironclad we never could have stood it. On our arrival at Clarendon we found that our boats had from some cause or other given us out and retired. Duvalls Bluff, above Clarendon, was evacuated by the rebels, they retiring to Little Rock. On the 11th we left that point for this, and by some management not in army regulation our wagons, provisions and camp equipage were started upon one road, and we upon another. Our suffering would have been extreme had it not been for 4 crackers to the man which we found in a wagon belonging to Curtis quartermaster. On this scanty allowance we traveled 18 and 23 miles a day until last night. Our train arrived this morning, we having lived from the time we started until this morning on four crackers to each man. We are now encamped on the bank of the Mississippi, Helena is a beautiful little town, clean and neat. Shortly after our arrival a trading boat came down and you should have seen the effect it had upon the men. So long shut up in the darkness of Arkansas hills and swamps, cut off form all correspondence with friends and the world, exposed to danger and disease, almost naked, and but a few days rations of crackers left, you can imagine how exhilarating the sight of a boat would be. We are below Memphis about 100 miles. Last night was a moon light one, and Lieut. Hill and myself, after the camp had become still, seated ourselves upon the bank of the river and looked upon a scene as beautiful as I ever saw. At this point the river is one and a half miles wide, Mississippi forming the other side.\n\nThe Indiana troops are almost naked, having drawn but few clothes since leaving Otterville, and but few uniforms can be found among them. We wlll get a new suit here and cut a stiff. Lieut. Bill Hill, with his pioneers attended the train and through the most desperate swamps building and cutting roads with an energy and celerity that drew from General Benton a very high compliment. This morning the camp is all gayety and life. The boys are enjoying the highest spirits. Besides the prospects for bread, meat and clothes, we have a faint hope of being ordered out of Arkansas.\n\nCol Baker and his cavalry are covering themselves with glory. They fear nothing; fight any force, no matter how large, when or where they find it.\n\nGen Hindman lives here, Gen. Curtis occupying his mansion, with the stars and stripes floating above it. The health of our company continues excellent, much to our surprise. Our friends can rest assured that for the present we are all doing well.\n\nN.B. In the fight I have spoken of, at one time the rebels were in the woods, but in hearing distance. The Wisconsin boys were supporting the Indiana howitzers, when they heard the command given by the rebel commander, \"Take the gun! Our boys came to a ready, and the line of rebels came rushing forward. Wisconsin waited until they came within fifty yards, when they poured a desperate volley into the, charging bayonets immediately, and throwing the enemy into confusion. They rallied again, after which one of our boys yelled out to them: Here is that gun, why in the hell dont you come and take it?\n\nDear Mitchell-\n\nI wrote you from Port Gibson a day or two after the fight of the 1st Inst. I then informed you of the loss of Company B, and presume ere this you have published it to our friends. Since that writing we have engaged in the unfortunate engagement of Champion Hills and \"Black River Bridge, not having a man hurt in either. On the 19th inst. our artillery opened on the fortifications protecting Vicksburg, and skirmishing began. Our division was at once thrown forward, in rifle range of the rebel works, and a spirited fight at once began with the rebel sharpshooters. We soon discovered that we could effectually silence their artillery by keeping a storm of bullets pouring into their port holes. We played this game upon them without material loss, until the 22nnd of May, when General Grant peremptorily ordered that at 10 oclock A.M., the whole line should charge, reaching from the Yazoo to Warrenton. Upon this announcement being made to the men, a gloom and hopelessness was visible on every face. All were fully convinced that is was a mad move, and that we would meet slaughter and defeat. Nevertheless, at the appointed hour, we fell into line and moved forward. The column had been in motion but a few moments when the enemy opened upon it from rifle pits and forts, with musketry, grape, shell and schrapnel. Confusion at once began. Men fell dead and wounded at every step. Many being wounded were afterward killed, and the slaughter was terrible. The 8th started in the charge with 446 men, losing in killed and wounded, 114. The 33d Illinois with a less number of men, lost the same, the 99th Illinois lost 170. And other regiments, so far as I can hear, suffered in the same proportion, - Company B started into the charge with 43 men, officers included. Its loss was 13 wounded and 3 killed.\n\nOn the 20th, while advancing our brigade from a hollow to one nearer the enemy, Alfred Wilson was killed by a grape shot striking him on the head. He did not die immediately, and when assistance was sent to remove him to the hospital he would not be removed from the field until he laid hold of his gun, which he persisted in carrying with him. On the following morning while the company was sharp shooting, Richard Lamb was killed by a Minnie ball striking him in the bowels, and George N. Black was slightly wounded in the shoulder. He did not leave the field, though in too much pain to load and shoot, but carried water from the spring to the boys while they fought. On the day of the charge we lost as follows:\n\nFirst sergeant, Frank Mays, killed.\n\nPrivate, John Scotten, killed\n\nAlfred Lowder, died from wounds\n\nWounded:\n\nCorporal, F. M. Miller, slightly in chin\n\nCorporal, Wm. W. Welling, severely in side and arm\n\nCorporal, Clark McDonald, slightly in hip\n\nPrivate, Thomas M. Martin, arm amputated\n\nPrivate, W. W. Alexander, severely in arm\n\nPrivate, Wm. N. Siplinger, slightly in foot\n\nPrivate, Charles Clapper, slightly in arm\n\nPrivate, Andrew J. Fuller, painfully in ankle\n\nPrivate, James N. Underwood, arm amputated\n\nPrivate, Wm. H. Morgan, collar bone broken\n\nLieut. W. G. Hill, painfully in right hand\n\nThe wounded are doing as well as the circumstances will permit. They are generally cheerful and confident of recovery. I understand they will be sent north as soon as possible. We are reducing Vicksburg by siege, since to attempt to take it by storm is folly and madness. Our regiment is lying on the protected side of a hill, in four hundred yards of the rebel works. Musket balls whiz harmlessly above us while our artillery keeps the air filled with the smoke of powder and the earth trembling. The enemy does nothing with its artillery. Toady, for the first time, two or three fired a shot at one of our batteries. Scarcely had the report been heard when Capt. Klauss of the 1st Indiana let a shell fly and blew up the seceshs caisson, killing a good many of them doubtless, besides leaving a tremendous moral effect. At night war ceases, except an occasional shot between pickets who stand within one hundred yards of each other. A few days ago the enemy sent in a flag of truce, giving us an opportunity to bury our dead that were left on the field after the fatal charge. The rebels came out of their holes by thousands, while the surrounding hills were covered with blue uniforms, gazing on the novel scene. Many of each side met, shook hands and conversed freely. Solders, both rebel and Union, were unanimously of the opinion that they in an hour like that could settle the war, if submitted to them. One rebel said he wished the truce would last forever. I heard of several instances where friend found friend, and in two or three cases, brother met brother. Desertions frequently occurred. The number no doubt would be double, did they not keep so rigid a guard. Two nights ago I was working in our ditches when two strapping Dutch boys who had escaped, jumped almost on top of me. After they were assured that it was all right, and got into the right place, they were the happiest fellows I ever saw. They give a dreadful account of the rebel rations and of the terror which our artillery and sharpshooters keep them in. If we succeed in keeping at bay the apprehended attack in the rear a little longer, Vicksburg will surely surrender. The mortar fleet I liked to have forgotten. It opens after dark and keeps up a terrible shelling during the night. The city has been on fire several times, but they have succeeded by some means in extinguishing the flames. The mortars surely scare them awfully, and I dont see how they help killing many. It is generally thought that hard fighting here is over, but nobody knows. The rebels before surrendering may come out and make a last desperate effort to escape. The nights are lovely and only when disturbed by the occasional crashing and bursting of shell, are so serene and still that we can hear the town clock in the city.\n\nLet our ladies at home know that everything they do, no matter how little, for the comfort of our sick and wounded, is fully appreciated, and does much more good than they could imagine. Too great a quantity of the delicacies, and of clothes, etc., cannot be sent here. The probability is that we will remain here sometime. Many will be wounded, and many and many more will be sick in consequence of the climate and the way we have to live. Our men have but one suit of clothes, and that is deficient, worn and dirty. We have no time outside of the ditches to wash, and when a man falls sick or is wounded he can only look to the efforts of friends at home and the sanitary commission for clean clothes. Ladies, do all you can for us. We need your assistance.\n\nNone of the Greenfield boys have been hurt, and without one exception have been in the fight and have done their duty manfully. Our company is sadly in need of recruits and must be filled up. There is no difficulty in getting into any company the recruit may designate. Will not some of our young men make the break and come to our assistance? I will write again after, and perhaps before the fall of Vicksburg.\n\nFollowing is another letter from Mr. Dunbar, dated October 18, 1863, at Vermillionville, Louisiana:\n\nDear Mitchell:\n\nSuddenly our Brigade has received orders to march. It goes alone, and starts tomorrow morning. Our mission is not for letters or newspapers, as we expect with all the secrecy that can be exercised, to have some warm work. I write merely that you may present to their friends the names of Company B, left in the hospital in New Orleans. They are, John W. Underwood, Amos W. Everson, Elijah H. Tyner (nurse), Henry McCorkhill (sent from Berwick), George M. Davidson, Francis N. C. Hodson, Albert W. Lake.\n\nI did not feel apprehensive of the death of any of them, even when they left, ague and diarrhea being the principal diseases. They had been sick but a few days, and with the excellent attention which I learn is bestowed upon the sick in hospitals in that city, I have no doubt they will soon recover,\n\nJohn Scott, a good citizen of Brandywine township, who had deservedly many friends throughout his neighborhood, died in hospital at New Orleans, September 11th. All must sympathize with his afflicted family and honor his memory for his good qualities.\n\nSearg. Cyrus Hanes and Elijhah Tuttle of Company B, in company with four others, after receiving instruction from the General, left, --on a critical mission. They pressed an oyster boat, sallied out into the Gulf, and from thence through innumerable bayous, lakes, and bogs, far into the interior of Louisiana, passing themselves among the enemy for smugglers. They accomplished, to the full satisfaction of the power that sent them, all they were sent to perform, returning in ten days from the date of their departure. They frequently saw and conversed with detachments of the enemy. Too much honor can not be awarded the men who will brave every danger, take life into their hands, peril everything for their country, and in obedience to others. Let the names of all such gallant actors stand out in bold relief, high on the scroll of honor.\n\nEditor, Hancock Democrat:\n\nOn Monday, November 23d, our division rested quietly behind a range of hills, near the Tennessee River, waiting for the engineers and pontonniers to complete the preparations for throwing a pontoon across the river. The work was done, the attention of the rebels was drawn to the extreme right, where General Hooker was making some heavy demonstrations, and a favorable opportunity for our crossing presented itself; accordingly we were ordered to be ready to march at 4 oclock next morning. Morning came, November 24, and we set off. The day was foggy and misting rain. We reached the river bank, which was lined with heavy cannon, ready to belch forth destruction to any one who might oppose our crossing.\n\nOur workmen had been busy at work all night, and the pontoon was about half completed. The boats were used as ferry boats until ready to be placed in their positions in the bridge. We embarked immediately, crossed, stacked arms and waited for our artillery, ammunition wagons, horses and ambulances, which could not be brought over until the bridge was completed.\n\nAll was over by 9 oclock A. M., and we were ready to advance. A very short distance now lay between us and the enemy on Missionary Ridge. Our artillery kept up a languid fire on them from across the Tennessee, besides which very little seemed to be doing in the way of battle. We prepared to advance. Our guns were loaded and capped. Skirmishers were thrown out to the front and flanks, four or five from a company. Sergt. George W. Watts, Wesley S. Catt, Charles Meyers, and Christian Ortle were detailed from Company B. All things being ready, we moved on slowly, at a left face, the thick under brush rendering it next to impossible to preserve a line of battle.\n\nOur skirmishers soon waked up the rebs. A brisk firing was commenced in front. We halted a short while, to give time to the skirmishers. We could now plainly see the summit of the first hill, but no enemy appeared thereon. We advanced slowly and halted near the top, when the rebs opened fire on us with their artillery. Fortunately our Chief of Artillery was with us, and got the precise location of the rebel battery. He immediately ordered up Richardsons battery, and opened on the enemy with one twenty-four pounder and several guns of smaller caliber. The rebs, who had been overshooting, lowered their pieces and replied vigorously for a while, the balls shaving very close, Our boys who were carrying balls from the caissons ran almost on all fours, while the balls hissed over their heads, and showered the limbs of trees around them. One projectile knocked off the whole top of a tree and hurled it into a regiment of the second brigade; but owing to some expert dodging, no one was injured. The rebs having one gun dismounted, and fearing for the safety of the remainder, removed their battery from view, and were silent the remainder of the day.\n\nOur skirmishers were advancing down the opposite side of the hill, and driving the rebel skirmishers up the next ridge on which they were fortified. The night found us. We rested on our arms, expecting a vigorous renewal in the morning.\n\nThe 1st brigade of our division lay on our right, and the second on our left, leaving us to occupy the center. Gen. Ewing, our division commander, ordered our brigade to fortify their position, and to remain as a reserve. We sent at the work with energy, and, by midnight, had a row of rifle pits stretching for half a mile, and facing the rebel works.\n\nGen. Ewing, Gen. Blair, our corps commander, and Gen. Sherman all established their headquarters with us, and also the signals were displayed near our regiment. This was very interesting to us, as we could witness the maneuvers, and hear the dispatches that were constantly coming and going. They kept the aids busy.\n\nThe morning of the 25th dawned. The fog had cleared away, and the sun rose in his radiant splendor; all was yet quiet. Both armies had been maneuvering during the previous night, and now lay in plain view of each other. Gen. Hooker had advanced his lines far up the mountain, while strong batteries and earthworks lined the valley at the foot of Missionary Ridge. The operations of the day were opened by a broadside from Richardsons battery, aimed directly at the rebel works on the next ridge, plainly visible; and not more than half a mile distant. The rebel guns replied. Our guns opened from across the Tennessee, the rebs returned the compliment. The boom of cannon then came up from the battle below, and were only answered by the canonical language of Missionary Ridge. The cannonading was now terrific along the entire line, from the summit of Lookout to the banks of the Chicamauga. The surrounding hills and mountains smoked like so many volcanoes, and the thunders of artillery rolled along the valleys of the Tennessee. Oh, how sublime! The reverberations among the hills reminded me much of the poets beautiful description of \"A Thunderstorm on the Alps. The noise of battle increased; the sound of musketry and of the charge was continually heard.\n\nUntil this time, we were admiring the scent, and estimating the distance of certain guns by the difference between seeing the flash and hearing the repot. Some of the boys were mounted on trees to obtain a better prospect, but our admiration ceased when we saw or wounded come limping in, supported on either side by their more fortunate comrades, or born on litters; some with heads bleeding, others with their shattered limbs dangling powerless by their sides. At first the sight was revolting, but when we could begin to count our wounded by scores and hear their stores of narrow escape, and hear their groans, we got mad and wanted to fight. If the 3d brigade had been turned loose, they would have stormed the very gates of purgatory; but No said Gen.Ewing, you must hold this ridge.\n\nJust then Brig. Gen. Corse of the second brigade was carried in with a severe wound in his thigh. He swore a blue streak as he passed. Says he, If they had wounded me in the head, or some place in the body so that I could keep the field I would not care; but they have shot me in the thigh and I must retire. Gen. Ewing started to go to him, but he shook his head and Ewing returned.\n\nThe first brigade now formed in the valley, and were ordered to carry that part of the ridge in their front. This brigade consisted of the 12th and 10th Indiana, and the second and 90th Ill. They made a brilliant effort, and carried the rebel works. Col. Loomis, their brigade commander, rode up to Gen. Ewing and informed him that he had gained the heights as ordered, but with severe loss, especially in point of officers. The Col. of the 90th Illinois fell mortally wounded; the Lieut. Col. of the 100th Indiana, was wounded; Capt. Brouse of the same regiment was killed, and many others. Hardly had Col Loomis returned to his command, when the rebs charged and recaptured their old works, driving the first brigade entirely from the ridge. (I think, however, that this was a preconcerted arrangement, to draw the rebs into a trap.) They retreated back across a piece of timberland, while the rebs poured in volleys of shot and shell at their glittering bayonets. The air was fairly vocal with the sound of exploding shells and hissing fragments.\n\nAbout this time, Christian Ortel of our own company was carried in, severely wounded in the thigh. He was a noble young man, and had the love and esteem of all who knew him. His wounds proved fatal. He died December 17, and now rests in the cemetery at Chattanooga.\n\nThe stars and stripes were now unfurled from Point Lookout and the sound of battle died away as the shadows of evening covered the hills and valley; all hushed to quiet; we retired to rest and ere mornings light Gen. Bragg with all his army was hurrying toward Atlanta.\n\nThe above letter was evidently written by Marshall Alley, whose name appears on the muster roll as John M. Alley.\n\nTranscribed from History of Hancock County, Indiana, Its People, Industries and Institutions by George J. Richman, B. L., Federal Publishing Co., Indianapolis, Indiana, 1916.
