        "text": "Limerick, haiku or free verse, the Jan. 1 watch log entry in poem format in place of the more standard entry is a common tradition in the sea services. Usually penned between midnight and 4 a.m. the log is a lighthearted way to begin a new year of operations. The watch log is the record of events that occur during the watch, completed by the officer of the day or the watch stander at their respective unit. All log entries are brief, often noting some combination of important information like operating status, weather and sea state, course and speed, and nearby vessels or ports.\n\nWatchstanders from around the Coast Guard artfully reflect on this year of service.\n\nCoast Guard Cutter Hollyhock, Port Huron, Mich.\n\nWritten by: Petty Officer 2nd Class, Jordan Devney\n\nCoast Guard Cutter Hollyhock maintains a track through the ice in Lake Huron, March 1, 2014. Hollyhock is one of nine Coast Guard cutters on the Great Lakes tasked with breaking ice to facilitate the flow of commerce through Great Lakes waterways. (U.S. Coast Guard Photo by Lt. Davey Connor)\n\nMoored port side to the waterworks pier. Not a lot to see, not a lot to hear.\n\nHomeported in Port Huron, Michigan. Given the chance, I would not make that wish again.\n\nBravo-12 remains our status, leaving no time for a long hiatus.\n\nDistrict Nine currently tells us the plan, until one day soon when we are laid up on land.\n\nAll the deck lights are burning bright, just as they do night after night.\n\nThe standard shore tie connections are attached, the standard mooring lines are over and matched.\n\nYoke is set and the small boats are in their cradle, the ship is nothing but completely stable.\n\nAs the new year begins Lt.j.g. Laystrom, is the boss. EMC Olson is the EOW and is never at a loss.\n\nThe watch stander so full of capability, as a yeoman can only sit there and say “members responsibility.”\n\nThis entry won’t be winning any award, just like that time I took my ISW board.\n\nHappy New Year's from us all on the Hollyhock, that's all for now as I've reached writer's block.\n\nCoast Guard Cutter Diligence, Pensacola, Fla.\n\nWritten by: Lt.j.g. Sadie Simons and Ensign Rachel Everson\n\nCrew members from the Coast Guard Cutter Diligence remove tie-down straps from a Coast Guard Air Station Atlantic City MH-65 Dolphin helicopter off the coast of Atlantic City, N.J., Wednesday, Aug. 1, 2012. The evolution was conducted as part of deck landing qualifications between nearly 20 pilots from several Coast Guard air stations and the 210-foot cutter Diligence, which is homeported in Wilmington, N.C. (U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Nick Ameen)\n\nAt the beginning of this new year, DILIGENCE sails the seven seas,\n\nBut we still can't out sail COVID-19.\n\nOn a course of 090 T, Cartagena lays 85 NM to our east.\n\nAs Patrick Star once said \"I thought you said weast.\"\n\n10-29.5 N 080-52.1 W is our current position but COMLANTAREA and JIATF-S determine our mission.\n\nLights are extinguished on the inside, but shine brightly out.\n\nGangway while the mighty DILIGENCE comes about.\n\nMaterial condition yoke is set, dog zebra is too.\n\nCradled and secured for sea are both DILI 1(CG26267) and DILI 2 (CG21362).\n\nBoth noise makers are up and running,\n\nIncluding the seaman with their hooting and hollering.\n\nThe engines turn for 180 SPRM at least,\n\nWhile the CSs prepare our New Year’s feast.\n\nThe engineers and deckies hard labor make DILIGENCE sail proudly\n\nWhile operations department is snuggled in sweatshirts typing away loudly.\n\nThe NR1 SSDG provides power to the boat,\n\nWe're honestly grateful to have “DILI” upon which to dote.\n\nSN Hodge looks for any vessels in sight,\n\nWhile SN Finch on helm keeps the ship's turns tight.\n\nLt.j.g. Hatfield stands a diligent watch,\n\nPraying her break-in doesn't flop.\n\nMeanwhile, as the New Year’s ball drops,\n\nAll hands wish their families and friends a happy new year as they proudly stand the watch.\n\nCoast Guard Base Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Va.\n\nWritten by: Petty Officer 1st Class Tiffany Duarte\n\nBase Portsmouth is the homeport to five medium endurance cutters that serve primarily in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. (U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class David Weydert)\n\n0000, a new commander in chief brought in the year; We closed a chapter with every page dogear.\n\nWe stood the watch and answered the call; responding to earthquakes in Haiti and migrant landfalls.\n\nSemper Paratus, we prepared and up pulled our sleeves; [and then got] in line for the COVID vaccine.\n\nWe made room at the pier and homeported two more 270’s; Seneca and Spencer now sail from Portsmouth into the sea.\n\nWe welcomed them with opened arms, even though a made rush for parking raised some alarm.\n\n2020 was bleak and we try hard to forget, 2021’s faith was in the hands of an existential marionette.\n\nBut the horizon looked bright, with no shutdowns in sight; with concerts returning and bars opening back up at night.\n\nBy now we thought COVID would be a distant memory; halt, enters omicron, a new variant, it arrives grievously.\n\nThe clock strikes midnight and the year ends; we look forward, with hope, as 2022 ascends.\n\nCoast Guard Cutter Mobile Bay, Sturgeon Bay, Wis.\n\nWritten by: Lt. Sam Pollard\n\nU.S. Coast Guard Cutter Mobile Bay approaches motor vessel Indiana Harbor in the St. Marys River, Jan. 13, 2018. The Indiana Harbor was beset by ice at Point Louise in the upper St Marys River and resumed transit after receiving assistance. (U.S. Coast Guard photo by Graham Gattan).\n\nA New Year’s tradition I keep alive by writing the log in verse,\n\nI hear the navigator is old-fashioned- hard to tell, he’s so terse.\n\nThe captain might direct me to write my log the “normal” way;\n\nbut having the chance with skipper a-bed, after an ever underway:\n\nWe find ourselves moored starboard side to a Yooper station;\n\nScarcely a place for a winter vacation.\n\nAll mooring lines are set and doubled,\n\ninattention will bring from BMC, trouble!\n\nThis station is called after Ignace the saint;\n\nLiberty and cheer for the crew? There ain’t.\n\nBoth engines are warm, with the jacket heaters glowing\n\nfor in twelve hours it may be up-river we are going.\n\nOur control operational and administrative,\n\nReside with District Nine, Cleveland native.\n\nHowever, we find the channel must be ice free,\n\nso TACON has shifted to Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nWe’ll keep the lakes open so commerce may sail,\n\nMobile Bay marks the way, she breaks the trail.\n\nMaterial condition is faithfully yoke,\n\nAbout which EO says there is no fun to poke.\n\nThe deck lights are burning and the truck lights which aircraft warn,\n\nElectrified by NR1 SSDG which supplies power this winters’ ‘morn.\n\nAs I near the end of the New Year’s fable,\n\nI must forget the boat’s in the cradle.\n\nThe last thing to note is whom has the watch:\n\nwe are diligent and true, no rounds shall we botch\n\nMK3 Rollins, OOD: SN Allard as the watch alas\n\nNone here shall receive at midnight a fresh charged glass.\n\nSince we’re moored to a pier in the cold U.P.,\n\nLeagues from home and loved ones, you see;\n\nFrom the bridge where I stand, I may see a moose,\n\nwhile keeping the first watch of a twenty double deuce.\n\n‘Twas the night before new year, and all through the ship,\n\nnary a critter was stirrin’, ‘cept me, and the coffee pot drip.\n\nCoast Guard Cutter William Tate\n\nWritten by: Petty Officer 2nd Class Ariel Arnold-Garcia and Seaman Dalton Shuffelbottom\n\nPetty Officer 3rd Class April Blocker, a crewmember on the Coast Guard Cutter William Tate, spots Seaman Michelle Coppage, another crewmember, as she secures the rope on to the hook of the crane Wednesday, Oct. 8, 2014, on the William Tate in Philadelphia. The crewmembers of the William Tate were conducting buoy operations training, ensuring they followed all safety protocols. (U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Peter Hoey)\n\nMoored port side to Pier 48, so long to 2021, another year great.\n\nAt Sector Delaware Bay; Philadelphia, PA where the fog this morning was gray.\n\nWith all standard mooring lines, doubled that is; we know WILLIAM TATE is ready for biz.\n\nThis unit is under OPCON and ADCON of CG D5 in Portsmouth, VA where the OSs keep others alive. Charlie status is current, and material condition yoke is set, all spaces are secure and safe I can bet.\n\nCG-18012 is cradled on deck, she is secure for sea ... don't believe me? Check.\n\nAll deck, mooring, and aircraft lights are energized and burning brightly, it's our way of alerting passersby where we are, but politely.\n\nReceiving electricity; phone and data lines connected, seasonal reliefs are on track as expected.\n\nLiberty is granted to all non-duty personnel, giving time to revive. It expires onboard 03 January 2022 prior to 0645.\n\nThe captain's direct representative; the inport OOD, is none other than our own independent duty storekeeper, SK2 AG.\n\nWith a huge turnover during the summer transfer this year, the crew of WILLIAM TATE hastily got back into gear.\n\nWe battened down the hatches, and tightened all bolts, charted all routes and measured all volts.\n\nWith record timing for seasonal evolutions, it would seem the crew of WILLIAM TATE requires no substitutions.\n\nHappy Nee Year’s crew, stay frosty.\n\nCoast Guard Cutter Polar Star\n\nWritten by: Petty Officer 3rd Class Diolanda Caballero and Capt. William Woityra\n\nPetty Officer 2nd Class Lauren Butnor, a crewmember aboard the Coast Guard Cutter Polar Star (WAGB 10), returns aboard Polar Star after participating in ice rescue training in the Bering Strait, Wednesday, Jan. 20, 2020. The 45-year-old heavy icebreaker is underway to project power and support national security objectives throughout Alaskan waters and into the Arctic, including along the Maritime Boundary Line between the United States and Russia. U.S. Coast Guard Photo by Petty Officer 1st Class Cynthia Oldham\n\nMaking way in the frigid Antarctic Sea, not by chance - but by choice. This is our destiny.\n\n66-26.4S 179-58.5E is where the POLAR STAR falls. Through 30 shades of blue and billowing winds we salute PACAREA and jump-to when JTF-SFA calls.\n\nThe Antarctic circle is practically in sight; perhaps we will see our first penguin tonight?\n\nBeating through the currents and around the ice, we poke and joke with all the pride inside.\n\nSix engines hum along, two powering each shaft. Down below, the engineers are masters of their craft. At this hour of night, we oughtta need a navigation light.\n\nBut the sun hasn’t set in what seems like days; we are gladly basking in the midnight sun’s rays.\n\nThe OTH and LCVP are sleeping snugly on the starboard side. Despite the whipping winds and rolling waves, this is a pretty comfortable ride.\n\nEnsign Uvanni raises his gaze to the sky. As the deck and conn he’s our guy.\n\nOver the watch, BM1 Kitchenmaster presides. Although not a cook, he whips up a great surprise. A nonrate stands QMOW: it’s SN Bondarenko!\n\nMeanwhile, in the hangar, the crew lets out a gasp: four shipmates just made second class!\n\nNever too early: they’re the first in the nation! The energy is taut and you can feel the elation.\n\nIn the galley, the ice machine sits silent as tree, leaving us longing for that chunky iced sea. Now that 2021 is just a grizzled old bone, 2022 emerges from the horizon of the unknown."
