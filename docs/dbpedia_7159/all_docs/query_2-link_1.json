That year he entered Franklin College in Franklin, Indiana and received his bachelor of divinity degree in 1908. While a student he enlisted in the Indiana National Guard. He served in both the Spanish-American War and World War I. Rising through the ranks, he was promoted to brigadier-general in 1922 and assigned to command the 76th Infantry Brigade. From 1929-1931 he served as chief of the National Guard Bureau as a major general. He retired his military commission in 1931 to devote full-time to his ministry. His pastorates spanned the country, from Kentucky to Oregon, retiring from his last ministry at the First Baptist Church of Richmond, Indiana in 1948. While minister of the First Baptist Church, Portland, Oregon, he was appointed president of Linfield College in McMinnville, Oregon and presided from 1938-1943. In 1904 he married Mary Coon, 1881-1963, also a graduate of Franklin College. They had two children, John and Mary Louise."
