        "text": "Copyright © 2023 by Wendy Waszut-Barrett\n\nIn June 2021, I posted about the life and career of J. C. Blaine (1853-1935); he was Sosman & Landis employee No. 30. Blaine not only worked with Joseph S. Sosman in 1875 (before the establishment of Sosman & Landis) but also was part of the Sosman & Landis staff in 1891. Recently, I stumbled across additional information about Blaine’s early career with Sosman and contacted a few of his descendants. His grandchildren have been quite generous with their own genealogical research, sharing both family photos, stories, and a few private letters.\n\nI am going to start with the Blain/Blaine surname discrepancy. Early in his career, Blain added an “e” to his surname. This explains why he was listed as J. C. Blain in 1875, and J. C. Blaine in 1891 – same person. Blaine changed his last name about the same time that James G. Blaine gained national recognition in the 1884 presidential race. James G. Blaine ran against Grover Cleveland and lost. Keep in mind that name recognition was key to the success of any nineteenth-century scenic artist. J. C. Blaine even named his second son, born in 1883, James G. Blaine. James G. Blaine followed in his father’s footsteps as a decorative painter, but also went by the nickname Pete. An article about the name confusion between politician James G. Blaine and painter James G. Blaine was published in the “National City Star-News” on October 27, 1955 (page 17). There was a family connection mentioned in the obituary of Joe’s father, John R. Blain: John was a second cousin of politician James G. Blaine.\n\nHere is how J. C. Blaine fits into the Sosman & Landis puzzle. I will start with the 1875 Joseph S. Sosman prequel, providing a little context for Blaine’s scenic art work in 1875.\n\nSosman’s scenic art career began only a few years earlier, in 1873 when he assisted Thomas B. Harrison. The two painted scenery for the new Chandler Opera House in Macomb, Illinois. Sosman had resided in Macomb for eight years, and was well-known as a sign painter by this time. Harrison was a well-known Chicago-based artist who hired Sosman to help paint scenery for the 600-seat venue. The stage at Chandler’s Opera House measured 50’ wide by 20’ deep. “Jno. B. Jeffery’s Guide and Directory” for theaters listed that the Chandler’s Opera House had six sets of scenery, meaning six different stock scenes that were available for touring productions.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1875, Sosman transitioned from a local sign painter to an itinerant scenic artist. 1874 was a transition point for Sosman, as he redirected his focus to scenic art opportunities. In the mid-1870s the demand for painted illusion was greater than the supply of scenic artists to paint it. This meant that an ambitious and talented painter could make an incredible amount of money, especially if he was willing to travel, and not settle down in any one place for long. Scenic art projects for the stage were considerably larger and much more lucrative than any sign painting and decorative painting project.\n\nThe beginning of 1874, found Sosman on the road, delivering scenery for a new stage in Mount Sterling, Illinois. On Jan 7, 1875, “The Macomb Journal” reported, “Joe Sosman, Macomb’s artistic painter, has gone to Mount Sterling to do some fine painting on a new hall in that place” (page 4). Mount Sterling, Illinois, was approximately 40 miles due south of Macomb, along the Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railroad. Sosman was starting to secure scenic art contracts throughout the state.\n\nOn September 23, 1875, “The Macomb Journal” reported, “Joe Sosman, Macomb’s talented young artist, left the city Monday last for Fairfield, Iowa, where he goes to paint scenery for a new hall erected there. He will be gone about three or four weeks, and will do a job that will suit the Fairfieldians to a T.” (page 3). Sometime between January 1874 and September 1875, Sosman partnered with Blaine.\n\nOn Oct. 14, 1875, Semon’s New Opera House in Fairfield, Iowa, opened to the public. The venue was similar in size to Chandler’s Opera House in Macomb, and described on opening day:\n\n“STAGE AND SCENERY.\n\nThe stage is 44×20 in size, ample space being given for dressing rooms. There are two entrances to the stage from the audience and one by the outside stairway. It is circular in front, and the foot-lights, of which there are about 15, give plenty of light. The scenery was painted by Mr. J. S. Sosman, of Macomb, Ills., and bears evidence of the work of a master painter, and a man skilled in his profession. It consists of a magnificent drop curtain, representing the Bay of Naples. At the right and in the foreground of the scene is a ruined arch covered with ivy, the whole being surrounded by beautiful Etruscan border sixteen inches wide. The parlor scene is a representation of gorgeous panel work, and the flat is supplied with practical doors on either side of which are beautiful columns with handsome arches extending above the doors and resting upon the pilasters. The street scene presents a brick residence and a garden in the foreground, while in the distance appear business houses, churches, residences, &c. In the wood scene is a heavy wood, with a beautiful lake in the perspective. The kitchen shows us a dilapidated room with rough plastering and a number of holes in the wall which have a natural appearance, and various articles of household use. At the sides of the drop curtains is more panel work, the entire curtain being surmounted by rich crimson and garnet drapery, giving a perfect finish. The drawing is on canvas fastened on the flats which are 10×16, sliding in grooves, and the wings are 4×10 in size. The painting is a great credit to the artist and all pronounce Mr. Sosman a painter of ability.”\n\nOn October 21, 1875, “The Macomb Journal” reported, “From a Burlington Hawk Eye, recently received, giving a description of the finishing of an Opera House in Fairfield, Iowa, quite a lengthy description is given of the scenery painting, and great praise bestowed upon the artist. The design and execution is pronounced first class in every particular, and we believe every word of it, and so will you, reader, when we inform you that our talented young friend, Joe Sosman, did the job” (page 2)\n\nBlaine’s contribution to the new stage scenery was later mentioned on Oct. 28, 1875, in the “Fairfield Ledger” when he assisted Sosman on another Fairfield project (page 6). The article reported, “Very Pretty. We mean that bulletin board painted by Messrs. Sosman & Blain, the artists who painted the scenery for the new opera house. The bulletin board is about 10×20 feet in size, and contains the cards of a number of our enterprising business men. It will be put up on the southeast corner of the Park, and will prove handsome and attractive advertisement. The work is a credit to Messrs. Sosman & Blain.”\n\nOn Nov. 4, 1875, the two were mentioned again in the “Fairfield Ledger”:\n\n“Business Chart. – The most beautiful and attractive business chart ever seen in Fairfield is the on now on the north side of the P. O. building. In size it is 8×16 feet, and contains the business cards of about twenty of Fairfield’s business men. The chart is made of wood, securely fastened to the wall. The cards are beautifully and artistically finished in oil. The work is very creditable to the artists, Messrs. Sosman & Blain, who handsomely painted the scenery at Semon’s Opera House.”\n\nSosman & Blain were also credited with painting scenery at Everson’s Hall in Washington, Iowa. On Nov. 24, 1875, the “Washington Evening Journal” published the following advertisement for the pair: “SIGN PAINTING. Messrs. Sosman & Blain, the Scenic Artists who are now at work painting the Scenery for Everson’s Hall, will, on completion of their work at the Hall, take orders for Sign Work. Fine Signs and Window Curtains made a specialty.”\n\nOn Dec. 17, 1875, the Washington Gazette listed “Sausman & Blaine – New style of advertising” in the “New Advertisements section (page 3). The article about their endeavor reported:\n\n“New Style of Advertising.\n\nThe center attraction to the crowds who visit the post office is the new and elegant advertising bulletin recently put three by Messrs. Sausman & Blaine, the scenic artists and commercial advertisers who have just completed the painting of the scenery for “Everson’s Opera Hall.” The work throughout stamps them as first-class artists in their line, and the bulletin is certainly the handsomest, neatest and most attractive thing we ever saw in the line of advertising. It is painted on canvas, in oil colors, and in size is 8 x 16 feet. The cards. Twenty-five in number, are beautifully and artistically designed and are ornamented with the names and businesses of twenty-five of Washington’s most enterprising and wide-awake businessmen. The whole number of cards were taken the first day, and numerous applicants for cards were made after the required number was obtained, which pointedly shows that our business men know how to appreciate a good thing when they see it, but Messrs. S & B have made an imperative rule to take as advertisers but one firm in each distinctive branch of business, and erect but one bulletin of twenty-five cards in each city, and have adopted as their motto ‘first come, first served,” hence but first-class advertisements have or will be taken. In conclusion, we can heartily endorse Messrs. Sausman & Blaine as gentlemen who fulfill their contracts satisfactorily in every respect, and we wish them success and bespeak for them the liberal patronage which their work deserves, wherever they go.”\n\nThe partnership of Sosman & Blain lasted for less than a year. The reason for their parting may have had to do with Perry Lands. In 1876 Sosman partnered with Landis, the two raising enough funds to establish a studio in Chicago by 1879. If Sosman had not met Landis, the trajectory of Blaine’s career may have had a very different outcome.\n\nLike Sosman, Blaine completed a variety of projects, working as a decorative painter, paper hanger, scenic artist, and a stage carpenter. Each traveled from town to town throughout the Midwest, completing a variety of projects during the 1870s. The greatest difference between the two occurred in the 1880s. Sosman established a business partnership, remained single. Blaine stayed solo, married in 1881, and raised a large family. In the end, the two became polar opposites.\n\nJames Culley Blaine was born on Sept 4, 1856 in Goshen Center, Elkhart, Indiana. He was part of a large family; one of several children born to John Roan Blain (1811-1890) and Hanna Nye (1816-1876). His parents were married on Dec. 11, 1835, in Elkhart County, Indiana, celebrating the birth of the following children over the course of two decades: Jasper (?-d. 1837), Mary Blaine (b. 1838), Francis J. “Frank” Blaine (b. 1842), Agnes (?-d. 1843), Henry Clay (1846-1885), Emily H. “Emma” (b. 1846/9-1908), Susanna (b. 1847), Corwin (?-d. 1850), Mary (d?-. 1878), Augusta (1853-1928), Joseph Culley (1856-1935), James Harvey Blaine (1858-1862), and Robert Blain (n.d).\n\nBy 1850, the US Federal census listed the Blain residence in Leesburg, Kosciusko, Indiana. The Blain household at this time included the following children that year: Mary (12 yrs.), Francis J. (8 yrs.), Henry C. (6 yrs.) Emily H. (4 yrs.) and Augusta (infant). Leesburg was only 18 miles south of Goshen where Joe was born in 1856. The 1860 US Federal Census listed the Blain family living in Goshen. At the time the household included Hannah (43 yrs.), Frank (18 yrs., painter), Henry (15 yrs.), Susanna (13 yrs.), Augusta (11 yrs.), Joe (7 yrs.) and James H. (3 yrs.). James Harvey Blain, passed away two years later, on March 3, 1862.\n\nJoe’s father, John R. Blain, made the regional news a few times during the Civil War. On May 28, 1863, John R. Blain sent a letter to the “Goshen Times” about the Butternut War in Leesburg, Indiana (p.3), writing, “Butternut War in Kosciusko County. Leesburg, Ind., May 26, 1863. Dear Sire: – I will inform you how things stand in Kosciusko Co. Last Sunday there was a great battle fought three miles northwest of Warsaw, at a church. A young lady came to church with a Butternut breast pin on and a lady of the Union stripe walked up and took it off and fight ensued thereupon. About twenty engaged in the fight, the Federals came off victorious and the Butternuts retreated a little worse for wear so closed the fight. Yours Truly, John R. Blain”. A few years later, John Blain divested himself of Goshen property too. On Nov. 16, 1865, the “Goshen Times” reported, “Mr. Chas. Grosspitch has bought the John R. Blain property on Maine Street, containing a little over one lot, for about four thousand dollars.” By this time, Joe Blain was nine years old and the family was preparing to move west.\n\nThe 1870 US Federal Census listed the Blains living in Maroa, Macon County, Illinois. At the time Joe was 17 yrs. old. Maroa is located approximately halfway between Chicago and St. Louis. In Maroa, the Blain household included: John R. Blain (58 yrs., tin smith), Hannah (54 yrs.), Henry C. Blain (24 yrs., farmer), Emily (21 yrs., music teacher), Augusta (19 yrs., music teacher), Joe (17 yrs., works on farm) and Stephen (8 yrs.). Interestingly, all of the Blain children were born in Indiana, except Stephen, who was born in New York. In 1870, brothers Joe and Henry Blain purchased a 500-acre farm in Madison Township, Polk County, Iowa. For geographical context, their farm was approximately twenty miles northeast of Des Moines, Iowa. However, this was quite a distance from Maroa. For geographical context, Madison Township is approximately 325 miles northeast of Maroa. This move brings Blaine to Iowa, where he later meets Sosman.\n\nAfter partnering with Sosman in 1875, Blaine continued west to Larned, in central Kansas. For geographical context, Larned is located Pawnee County. I have yet to pinpoint when Blaine moved west. However, he is well known in town by 1879. On April 2, 1879, “The Larned Eagle-Optic” of Larned, Kansas announced, “Mr. J. C. Blaine has taken a quarter section of school land in this township and erected a house thereon. We wonder who is coming from the east to occupy it with Joe” (page 2). Blaine had purchased land in an area known as “South Pleasant Valley.” This was the same area where his future wife lived with her family. Their meeting may have prompted Blaine to secure better employment. On August 9, 1879, “The Larned Eagle-Optic” mentioned Blaine in the “South Pleasant Valley” Section of the paper: “J. C. Blaine put in appearance in this part of the first week. He has accepted a job in the paint department of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe railroad at Topeka” (page 3). Blaine moved to Atchison, Kansas.\n\nOn June 25, 1880, “The Larned Eagle-Optic” announced, “J. C. Blaine, formerly of this place but now of Atchison, was visiting friends here week before last” (page 3). Years later, Blaine was remembered in the Atchison newspapers, still owning property in town. On June 15, 1905, “The Atchison Daily Globe” reported, “J. C. Blaine, formerly an Atchison painter and decorator is in town. Blaine owns property in South Atchison. He has not been in Atchison before in ten years. He says he has been all over North America and South America. He formerly worked for A. B. McQueen. He located in Atchison some twenty-five years ago” (page 2). A. B. McQueen was a well-known individual who consistently placed advertisement in Atchison papers over the decades. In 1879, he primarily worked as a painter and glazier.\n\nHe was still living and working in Atchison in 1895, when Blaine last lived in town. That year, McQueen advertised as a house and sign painter, with paper hanging as a “specialty.”\n\nBetween 1880 and 1881, Blaine relocated to Ottawa with his new bride. On August 13, 1881, Joseph Cully Blain married Fanny W. Douglas Orrell (1860-1954). At the time, Fanny was 21 yrs. old, the eldest child of seven children in the Orrell household. Their mother, Mary Ann Montgomery Orrell, had passed away four years earlier, on Sept. 11, 1877, and was buried in the Larned cemetery.\n\nAs was the case with most nineteenth-century painters who secured work in larger metropolitan areas, Blaine headed to Kansas City. Anticipation of their first child may have been the cause. In the early 1880s, Kansas City bustled with opportunity. Theaters were rapidly being constructed throughout the region. Sosman & Landis even opened a branch office there in 1882. Numerous studios were hiring, offering ample opportunities to those willing to travel for work.\n\nOttawa is approximately 60 miles southwest of Kansas City.\n\nOn Dec. 22, 1881, Joe sent a letter to Fanny from Kansas City:\n\n“My Dear Wife\n\nI rec’d that nice long letter from you yesterday – was glad to learn that you were all well. I did think that I could get off this week but it don’t look much like it now. I have done well since you left. If I could have worked steady but it seems as if it all goes for board. I have only got myself a hat and boots and it seems as if that is all I can get. I have got the “blues” awful bad – you know how I act with them. I can make a living easy but that ain’t the thing. I want to get out of here so bad that I am nearly crazy. It would be nice if I could come there and live but you know there is nothing for me to do in the winter. I wish your father would go to Cali. Nothing would suit me better for that is a grand country. My tooth don’t hurt no more. I had to cut my boot in the instep in order to wear it. I will write another letter soon. Your friend Mrs. Murphy is dead. She was raving crazy for two weeks before she died. She suffered very much. It is snowing very hard. Let me hear from you soon.\n\nFrom your husband”\n\nWhat makes this letter significant is that it places Blaine in Kansas City at the same time that Sosman & Landis open a regional office in there. It also mentions California, where many Orrell family relations relocate, including Fanny by 1904.\n\nJoe and Fanny celebrated the birth of first child, Mark, in 1882. It does not appear that he survived past infancy. Their second child, James G. Blaine, was also born in Ottawa the following year. On a separate note, T. B. Harrison (Sosman’s scenic art instructor and friend) painted scenery for the Ottawa Opera House in 1882. On July 26, 1882, the “Ottawa Daily Republic” announced, “Mr. Harrison, the scenic artist of the new Opera House had begun work on the large drop curtain, and it promises to be one of the handsomest pieces of art in the state” (page 1). In a small town, it is unlikely that Harrison and Blaine didn’t meet, especially since both had worked with Sosman.\n\nFor historical context, between the summer of 1881 and 1882, Sosman & Landis delivered scenery to the following opera houses:\n\nOpera House, Detroit, Minnesota\n\nAcademy of Music, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nHill’s Opera House, Ann Arbor, Michigan\n\nHumblin’s Opera House, Battle Creek, Michigan\n\nOpera House, West Bay City, Michigan\n\nOpera House, Grass Lake, Michigan\n\nOpera House, Hancock, Michigan\n\nNew Opera House, Howell, Michigan\n\nUnion Opera House, Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\nArbeiter Hall, Ludington, Michigan\n\nOpera House, Montague, Michigan\n\nEdsell Opera House, Otsego, Michigan\n\nRussell’s Opera House, Bonham, Texas\n\nBrownsville Opera House, Brownsville, Texas\n\nMy Theatre, Fort Worth, Texas\n\nOpera House Gainsville, Texas\n\nOpera House, Mexia, Texas\n\nLeach’s Opera House, Somerville, Tennessee\n\nKahn’s Opera House Boliver, Tennessee\n\nKing’s Opera House, Jackson, Tennessee\n\nVicksburg Opera House, Vicksburg, Mississippi\n\nMcWhinney’s Opera House, Greenville, Ohio\n\nYengling Opera House, Minerva, Ohio\n\nCity Hall, Athens, Ohio\n\nOpera House, Nevada, Ohio\n\nBennett’s Opera House, Urbana, Ohio\n\nKrotz’s Grand Opera House Defiance, Ohio\n\nCity Hall, New London, Ohio\n\nFreeman’s Opera Hall, Geneseo, Illinois\n\nOpera House, Hoopeston, Illinois\n\nOpera House Cambridge, Illinois\n\nTurner Hall, LaSalle, Illinois\n\nOpera House, Greyville, Illinois\n\nOpera House, Carthage, Illinois\n\nMasonic Hall, Macomb, Illinois\n\nNew Hall, Good Hope Illinois\n\nTemperance Hall, Seneca, Illinois\n\nOpera House, Lockport, Illinois\n\nNew Opera House, Rockford, Illinois\n\nHolt’s Opera House, Anamosa, Iowa\n\nKing’s Opera House, Hazleton, Iowa\n\nOpera House, Denison, Iowa\n\nOpera House, Jefferson, Iowa\n\nOpera House Nanticoke, Pennsylvania\n\nOpera House Athens, Georgia\n\nStummer’s Hall, Washington, Georgia\n\nOpera House Reidsville, North Carolina\n\nOpera House, Wilson, North Carolina\n\nOpera House, Newbern, North Carolina\n\nOpera House, Goldsboro, North Carolina\n\nStouch Opera House, Garnett, Kansas\n\nGermania Hall, Blair, Nebraska\n\nKlaus’ Opera House, Jamestown, Dakota\n\nOpera House, Westville, Indiana\n\nGrand Opera House, Richmond, Indiana\n\nOdd Fellows Hall, Peshtigo, Wisconsin\n\nHyde’s Opera House, Lancaster, Wisconsin\n\nKlaus’ Opera House, Green Bay, Wisconsin\n\nStorie’s Opera House, Menominee, Wisconsin\n\nOpera House, Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin\n\nCity Hall, Mineral Point, Wisconsin\n\nKolter’s Opera House, Wausau, Wisconsin\n\nOpera House, Waupaca, Wisconsin\n\nSoldiers’ Memorial Hall, Milwaukee, Wisconsin\n\nMusic Hall, Eau Claire, Wisconsin\n\nOpera House, Stevens’ Point, Wisconsin (drop curtain, landscape with advertisements)\n\nCity Hall, Lewisburg, West Virginia\n\nOpera House Moberlv, Missouri\n\nOpera House, Unionville, Missouri\n\nOpera House, Eutaw, Alabama\n\nOpera House Demopolis, Alabama\n\nGrand Opera House, Cheyenne, Wyoming\n\nCosmopolitan Theatre, Miles City, Montana Territory\n\nOpera House, Harrodsville, Kentucky\n\nSosman & Landis were taking the nation by storm. No other scenic studio in the country was producing the sheer volume of work. And in 1882, the operated studios in Chicago, New York, and Kansas City.\n\nBlaine maintained a permanent residence in Ottawa, where he and Fanny celebrated the birth of ten children over the course of 22 years: Mark Blain (1882-?), James “Pete” Gillespie Blain (1883-1955), Dana Charles Blain (1886-1927), Lowell Henry Blaine (1889-1955), Mary Lena Blaine (1890-1966), Nelson Theodore Blain (1894-1914), Dorothea (b. abt. 1896), Kathryn Mae Blain (1898-1925), Orrell Maxine Blain (1901-1988) and Janice Meredith Blaine (1904-1974). A large family kept Blaine somewhat close to home. His name repeatedly appeared in Ottawa newspapers throughout the 1880s. Blaine began to focus more on decorative and sign painting. Here are a few newspaper announcements about Blaine’s painting projects:\n\nOn July 5, 1883, the “Independence-Journal” of Ottawa, Kansas, mentioned Blaine’s ornamental work. The article reported, “Have you noticed the water color decoration in the parlors of the Centennial House? This work was done by J. C. Blaine. Notice it” (page 3).\n\nOn Oct. 31, 1883, “The Ottawa Daily Republic” announced, “Mr. J. C. Blaine, who had the job of painting John Pollock’s new residence has completed his contract” (page 4).\n\nOn Nov. 23, 1883, “The Ottawa Daily Republic” reported, “One of the finest jobs of house decorating that we have observed in Ottawa is that which has just been completed by Mr. Blaine at Doc Bowles elegant residence. Mr. Blaine is evidently an artist, as well as a practical workman. The various rooms are finished in the most exquisite taste, and while no two are alike there is general harmony which makes a wonderfully complete whole. The library is a very handsomely finished antique style, and the ceiling of the front parlor in Renaissance. The side walls of this room are in graded paper of silver metal. An Adjacent bed-room is also a marvel of beauty and artistic effect. There is a gradation of tints from the ceiling down the walls, which only the mind and hand of an artist could conceive and execute” (page 4).\n\nBlaine still maintained connections with Larned in Pawnee county. His 1884 listing in the Ottawa Directory includes the ties: “Blaine, J C, fr Pawnee Co, Kas, painter, res es Locust 3 d s 5th.”\n\nOn April 10, 1884, “The Ottawa Daily Republic” reported, “No better evidence of the progression of things material in Ottawa could be produced than the growth of the aesthetic in her private homes. The artist, not the ‘painter,’ is now in demand in our city, and this fact is evinced by the superb character of the work being done in most of our residences, When decorative artists of genius and skill, such as Mr. J. C. Blaine find it profitable to locate in our city, it speaks with emphasis undoubted for the growing taste and wealth of the community. We have already a vast number of beautiful homes, and many more are being added rapidly. Take for instance, the magnificent residence of Mr. T. J. Warren, corner of Cedar and Seventh streets, which has just been artistically completed internally by Mr. Blaine, in black and white walnut; the handsome residence of Mr. Simpson, on Cedar Street, also finished by Mr. Blaine and his corps of artists, in beautiful chestnut grain, and almost completed residence of H. J. Smith, on Elm and Fifth, where Mr. Blaine has just completed the decorating. Nothing more attractive or artistic can be imagined than is the work in these elegant homes. Mr. Blaine, however, does not confine himself to residences; business houses and offices are also finished and decorated by him in the highest style of art, As witness the just completed work in the Goodin Bank, well worth a call to see. Here is a magnificent counter, finished in French and American walnut, lined up with gold, red-lake and ebony, in exquisite style. Mr. Blaine is an artist well deserving extensive patronage.”\n\nBy 1884, Blaine was running his own studio and hiring assistants. As the newspaper article stated: “Mr. Blaine and his corps of artists.”\n\nIn 1884, Blaine also decorated the local jail. On April 21, 1884, “The Ottawa Daily Republic” listed his invoice for painting and papering the jail; it was submitted to the Franklin County Board of County Commissioner, totaling $64.74 (page 2). He submitted additional amounts on April 24, 1884 (page 4).\n\nOn April 22, 1886, the “Ottawa Daily Local News” reported, “J. C. Blaine, the favorite painter, has engaged the services of Allan McElroy, late of Indianapolis, as assistant. Mr. Elroy is a first-class decorator and artist. Mr. Blaine is now better prepared than ever to do the best of work with dispatch” (page 3). That June, the “Ottawa Daily Local-News” reported, “Mr. J. C. Blaine has finished a very handsome job of painting on the Agricultural hall in the west died of Forest Park.” (9 June 1886, p. 3).\n\nOn May 26, 1887, “The Ottawa Herald” reported, “J. C. Blaine has the contract for painting the names of the street on boards to be placed on the street corners. The price is ten cents apiece. Mr. Blaine is an excellent workman, and the HERALD can vouch for the correct and prompt execution of the work” (page 5).\n\nOn March 30/31, 1888, “The Ottawa Daily Republic” published the following announcement: “Parties desiring plastering, patching work or flue repairing, can have their orders promptly attended to by leaving word at the office of J. C. Blaine, east side of Public Square. Signed F. M. Kirkham” (page 4).\n\nDuring the spring of 1889, Blaine was hired to work on the Hamblin’s College Addition as a decorative painter (Ottawa Weekly Republic, 21 March 1889, p 3).On June 27, 1889, “The Ottawa Herald” reported, “J. C. Blaine has gone to Atchison on business” (page 5). He submitted invoices to the City of Ottawa for $2\n\nOn July 4, 1889, the “Ottawa Weekly” reported, “In rescuing one of the horses which was in danger of suffocation, Mr. J. C. Blaine, painter, was struck in the stomach, but the injury does not appear to be dangerous. He was able to sit up last night and is no worse today” (page 3).\n\nIn 1890, Blaine shifted his focus back to theatre. On Nov. 20, 1890, “The Ottawa Herald” reported, “Sam Rohrbaugh has converted the old skating rink into a modern opera house and will open it about Christmas. J. C. Blaine will be manager” (page 5).\n\nThis shift coincided with his father’s visit, and the timing is just odd. Prior to managing the new opera house, Joe’s father arrived in town for a visit. He never left and soon passed away.\n\nOn September 8, 1890, “The Ottawa Daily Republic” announced, “J. R. Blain arrived last Friday from Decatur, Illinois, on a visit to his son J C Blaine. The old gentleman will be 79 years old Sept. 9 tomorrow, and is hale and hearty” (page 4). John’s health soon deteriorated. On Dec., 4, 1890, “The Ottawa Herald” reported, “J. C. Blaine’s father is very sick and not expected to recover” (page 5). On Dec 10, 1890, the “Chicago Tribune” published the obituary of Joe’s father (page 6): “Monticello, Ill., Dec. 9. – [Special.] – John R. Blaine, a cousin of James G. Blaine, died recently at the home of his son, Joseph Blaine, at Ottawa, Kas., aged 80. He has long been a resident of Central, Illinois, where he was well known. The remains were taken to Indiana, his former home, for burial.” On Dec. 11, 1890, the “Ottawa Herald” reported, “Mr. Blaine, father of James C. Blaine, the painter, died last Thursday of Heart disease at the residence of his son on Poplar St. His remains were sent to Decatur, Illinois for Burial. Mr. Blaine was a second cousin of J. G. Blaine, of national fame” (page 5).\n\nLess than a year later, J. C. Blaine was working at Sosman & Landis. What remains unclear is if Joe was working for the Kansas City or Chicago office; however, it was likely the KC branch. On October 9, 1891, the “Salina Weekly News” reported, “Scenery Here. The new scenery for the Salina Opera House is here. It is elegant in design and finish. Mr. J. C. Blaine of the house of Sosman & Landis is also here as stage carpenter and at work. He was given notice while at Sulphur Springs, Arkansas and came on immediately. The work will require one week to finish as the plans for carpenter work in the hanging did not come in time for Contractor Gilbert to complete before the arrival of Mr. Blain. The chairs are elegant and comfortable and are now being lined upon the floor in a large Semi-circle” (page 4). Now this was quite a trek, as Salina was approximately 320 miles northwest of Sulphur Springs, Arkansas; no short jaunt.\n\nBy 1893, Blaine was working in Decatur, Illinois. His older brother, Henry C. Blaine, also lived in Decatur, having lived there for quite a few years. Already in 1889, Henry C. Blaine had been listed as an employee of Haworth & Sons in the Decatur City Directory, residing at 1366 N. Water. Joseph C. Blain was listed as a painter in the 1893 Decatur City Directory, living at 241 E. Edmond. Blaine’s trips to and from Illinois were often announced in “The Ottawa Herald.” For example, on June 29, 1893, the newspaper reported, “J. C. Blaine is back home from Illinois” (page 5). When Blaine returned to Ottawa that summer, it was likely to celebrate the birth of another child. On July 20, 1893, “The Ottawa Herald” announced, “J. C. Blaine has a new baby at his house” (page 4).\n\nAround this time, Blaine begins to faulter, both with work and in his home town. On August 2, 1894, “The Ottawa Herald” announced, “J. C. Blaine was arrested by Ed Chenoweth for using harsh language. Blain was taken before Judge Robb and fined. He took an appeal to the district court” (page 5). Despite the bad press, Blaine remains in town for a while and begins to take on a variety of decorative projects again.\n\nOn Sept. 18, 1895, “The Ottawa Daily Herald” described another of Blaine’s Ottawa projects – decorating the Star Clothing House (page 3). The article reported “The store room (the one vacated by the Skinner establishment) has been in the competent hands of Mr. J C Blaine, and has been put in magnificent condition; it has been repapered and re-painted throughout, and is marvelously attractive.”\n\nSometime between 1895 and 1900, the Blaines move from Ottawa to nearby Harrison Township in Franklin County, Kansas.\n\nThe 1900 US Federal Census list the Blaine family residence in Harrison Kansas. The Blaine household included: Joseph C. (45 yrs.), Fanny (37 yrs.), James G. (son, 16 yrs.), Charles D. (son, 13 yrs.), H. Lowell (son, 11 yrs.), Mary Lena (daughter, 9 yrs.), Nelson (son, 6 yrs.) and Catherine M. (daughter 2 yrs.). Two more daughters were born in the next few years; Orrell M. in 1901 and Janice in 1904. This meant that there was a 22-yrs.-age gap between the oldest child, James G. Blaine, and the youngest child, Janice Blaine.\n\nBlaine continued to work as a paper hanger and painter. In fact, Joe C. and his two sons, James and Dana, were both listed as painters in the 1905 Ottawa City Directory. Joe’s address was 1212 E. 7th, with James’ address as 724 E. 6th, and Dana’s address was 831 E. 8th. Son Lowell was listed as a student at 1212 E 7th, and daughter Dorothy was a stenographer, boarding at 418 W. 2nd.\n\nLife was about to radically change for the Blaine family over the next few years,\n\nThe 1905 State Census that year listed Fannie and Joe Blain living with their children: Lowell (16 yrs.), Lena (14 yrs.), Nelson (11 yrs.), Catharine (7 yrs.), Orrell (4 yrs.) and Janeth (1 yrs.). However, Fannie was no longer living in Kansas. She moved to National City, California in 1904. According to family records, she left with her two youngest children, Orrell and Janice, to get away from Joe. Blaine’s grandchildren explain, “She was 44 and tired of having children.” Joe purportedly suffered from alcoholism too. Fanny would not return for seventeen years.\n\nWhy did Fanny pick California? Because of extended family. The Orrells had settled in National City during the 1880s. In later years, Fanny’s obituary remembered, “she came to California in 1904 to join her sisters and a brother. They were the late Mrs. Ida Jennings, San Diego, and Fran Orrell, National City, and Mrs. Al Addis, who still resides in National City. The 1900 US Federal Census listed Fanny’s father, William B. Orrell, living with his daughter, Ida B., and son-in-law Fred M. Jennings in San Diego, California.”\n\nJoe and the older Blaine children remained in Kansas until 1910. In 1907 Joe Blaine was listed in the “Painter and Paperhangers” section of the Ottawa City Directory. His place work and home address were both listed as 1212 E. 7th. Other Blaine family members who were listed in the City Directory at that same address in 1907 City Directory included sons Dana Blain (paper hanger) and Henry L. Blaine (student at Ottawa University). In 1907 Dana moved to Cherryvale, Kansas, where he was listed as a painter in the Cherryvale City Directory. In Cherryvale, Dana worked for J. B. Bricker, a paperhanging and decorative painting firm located at 106 N. Depot. By 1910, Dana relocated to Wichita, Kansas, where he continued to work as a decorative painter. That year, Dana worked for Young Bros. Decorating Co., 142 N. Main, Wichita. However, Dana continued to sporadically appear in the Ottawa Directory. Both Joe and Dana Blaine were still listed as paperhangers in the 1910 Ottawa City Directory, before Joe and the kids joined Fanny in National City. Dana Blaine, however, remained in Wichita until his passing seventeen years later, in 1927.\n\nAccording to Blaine descendants, there were numerous letters written from Joe and the children, pleading for Fanny’s return to Kansas. One of the letters that Blaine family descendants shared is dated March 16, 1908. Joe wrote:\n\nDear Wife,\n\nWell I thought I would try it again. This is Mon. Morn 5:30” o’clock. So you see we rise early. Early spring is sure here. This month has been just like summer. We only use the kitchen stove. The grass is up the elm buds are out fruit trees ready to bloom. Even the Red birds & Robins are going around in their shirt sleeves. Our hens are beginning to lay. Even the duck (the only one left) lays a big egg every other day. You asked whether I have changed my underclothes or not. Yes I have except my drawers. There is enough in the legs to make another pair of socks by turning them down so I thought I would wear them a week or two longer. Just as soon as we are sure the cold weather is over we will expect to start. Don’t you think there is a danger of your wearing your welcome out? Just as soon as you want to come we will try to raise the money. We are all about worn out roughing it. We would like to see the girls and of course I would like to see the old girl to for absence makes the heart grow fonder.”\n\nSome of the letter is illegible at this point and was not successfully transcribed’ it continues:\n\n“Well this is spring and of course the young man’s thoughts turns to love & pastry. I bought a davenport lounge with a pale green velour upholstering with a design of art novau [sic. nouveau] in it. Also a nice stand for the parlor. Tink has more in the Miller house across the river. Well work has commenced. I am doing the Christian Church also the inside of the Catholic Church. Residence outside work has open up. This has been the dullest winter we ever passed through. Well I will close to go to work.\n\nYour Joe\n\nDon’t forget to arrange about settling for the property for if we get anything, we will want to remodel the house this summer.”\n\nIn a, Aug. 1, 1910, letter from Joe to a child, nicknamed “Sam,” he provides a little insight into his current projects and observations regarding the painting industry. I have a gut feeling that “Sam” was Joe’s pet name for daughter Orrell. She would have been 8 yrs. old at the time, and likely wondering why her father didn’t want to come to California. Joe explained a few reasons, writing:\n\n“Dear Sam\n\nReceived your letter was glad to hear from you and hear you was well. Things are very dull here. I am working on the Washington School am doing it all through. Will amount to $500.00 so you see it is a big job. There is lots of work in my line…I found 15 men for every job of painting. When I came here I found 15 jobs for every man (in my line). So you see I am not very favorable impressed with the country. Your mother seems to think that anybody can do well there. She throws it up to me. How well your Aunt May is getting along on 60.00 per month. Well they may do it, but it cost me over $9.00 for their short stay there. So you see there is the difference…Write soon.\n\nYour Father,\n\nJoe Blaine”\n\nThat same year, Joe and the rest of their children joined her in National City, California. The 1910 US Federal Census listed the following Blaine family members living in National City: Joseph C. (50 yrs.), Fanny (49 yrs.), Lena (19 yrs.), Nelson (16 yrs.), Kathryn (12 yrs.), Orrell (8 yrs.) and Janeth (6 yrs.). James G. Blaine also ventured west, relocating from Tioga, Neosho Cty., Kansas, to National City, California. James “Pete” Blaine continued to work as a painter in California.\n\nIn 1912, Joe Blaine partnered with another California artist named Jamison, establishing Jamison & Blaine. Their firm was located behind the news offices in the W. T. Johnson Building. Home of the local Masonic Temple. On June 8, Jamison & Blaine were mentioned as sign painters, tenants at the W. T. Johnson building during a renovation. The article mentioned that other businesses in the lower level of the building included the News office, electricians Lozier & Blanchard, realty brokers Stinsman & Nioble. The Masons occupied the second story of the building (page 1).\n\nOn June 15, 1912, Jamison & Blaine placed an advertisement in the “National City Star-News” for paperhanging and sign painting services (page 4)\n\nWork was not as successful for Joe in California as Fanny predicted. The Blaine’s began to fall behind and were unable to pay their property taxes. In 1914, J. C. Blaine was listed as delinquent in property taxes for three lots. On Feb. 14, 1914, the “National City Star-News” (page 4) published the following notice, identifying J. C. Blaine as delinquent for city taxes in the year 1913-1914:\n\nBlaine, J. C. – Lot 1, Blk 1. Kimball’s sub 10 acre lot 4 qr sec 154, National Rancho.\n\nBlaine, J. C. – Lot 2, Blk 1. Kimball’s sub 10 acre lot 4\n\nBlaine, J. C. – Lot 3, Blk 1. Kimball’s sub 10 acre lot 4 qr sec 154, National Rancho.\n\nOverall, 1914 was a very difficult year for the Blaine family. On Oct. 28, son Nelson T. Blaine died from injuries sustained during a railroad accident. On Oct. 31, 1914, the “National City Star-News” reported, “Nelson Blaine was fatally injured as a result of an accident which threw him head first from the Santa Fe locomotive, on which he was working, near Pomona.” The boy was picked up and hurried to Los Angeles, where he died Friday evening, at the Santa Fe hospital. Relatives were summoned from this city to his bedside, but he never regained consciousness” (page 4).\n\nJoe continued to seek work.\n\nBy 1915, both Joe and James were still listed in the San Diego Directory:\n\nJames G. and his wife Ethel lived at es 1st av 1 s of 12th\n\nEarly in 1916, Joe and James headed back to Kansas, hoping for more work. Although Joe returned to California by winter, James did not. On Dec. 23, 1916. The “National Star-News” announced, “J. C. Blaine has returned to this city after spending some time in Kansas” (page 1). From 1916 until 1924, James G. Blaine was repeatedly listed in the Wichita City Directory. Both he and his brother, Dana, continued to paint. It was not until 1925, that James and Ethel returned to California.\n\nJames’ return to National City was announced in the “National City Star-News on Aug. 22, 1924 (page 4). The announcement read, “Mr. Pete Blaine, a former resident of National City, but who has not been here for ten years, arrived from Kansas recently and is visiting his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Blaine of National avenue and Eleventh street.”\n\nIt was not until 1925 that Fanny returned to Kansas. On May 15, 1925 the “National City Star-News” announced:\n\n“TO VISIT OLD HOME TOWN.\n\nMrs. J. C. Blaine and daughter Janice, are leaving next week on a three months visit among friends and relatives in Wichita, Kansas. Mrs. Blaine will visit one son she has not seen for seventeen years” (page 1).\n\nAnother version was published the next week – On May 22, 1925, “The National Star-News” reported, “Mrs. J. C. Blaine’s went back to Wichita wich is sum town in Kas. To see her son wich she ain’t seen in 17 years so I bet they will have a good time talkin about old times, Janice went also. For company I gess to stay 3 munths.”\n\nFanny’s son, Dana, passed away in Wichita two years later.\n\nIn regard to Joe, he continued to scramble for work in National City after his return in Dec. 1916. Blaine was listed in an article entitled “Board of City Trustees,” published in the “National City Star-News” on June 30, 1917. Blaine’s labor invoice was listed as part of an audit: “J. C. Blaine, printing St. Sign….2.50” (page 1). Not a big project.\n\nBlaine couldn’t pay his taxes again in 1917. He was again part of the delinquent tax list in the “National City Star-News” on Feb 16, 1918, for “Lots 1,2 and 3, Block 1, Kimball’s Sub in 10 Acre, Lot 4, ¼ Sec. 154, National Rancho” (page 2). This problem continued into the 1920s, with matters getting worse. On Feb. 11, 1927, Blaine was again listed as a delinquent taxpayer for the same three lots (page 4).\n\nIn regard to political party, Joe Blaine consistently listed himself as a Republican until 1918, when he became associated with the Socialist. He was again listed as a Socialist in the in California Voter Registrations in 1920. Throughout the 1920s, J. C. Blaine was listed in San Diego Directory as a decorator.\n\nInterestingly, the 1920 US Federal census listed Blaine as a decorator in the hotel industry. Blaine was the resident painter at the Coronado Hotel. That year, the Blain household included Joe, Fanny, and children: Katherine (21 yrs.), Orrell (18 yrs.), and Janeth (15 yrs.), all residing at the same home on 1107 National Ave. In 1920, the San Diego Directory listed Joseph working as a painter, Janeth as a student, Kathryn Mae as a telephone operator, Orrell as a nurse, and Lowell (unemployed).\n\nBy the onset of the Great Depression, Blaine shifted from “decorator” to “Painter.” The 1930 US Federal Census listed Blaine as a painter, and living with Fanny, Lowell (40, guard at prison camp), Mona (27) and lodger, Sarah M. Hanold.\n\nThe 1931-1933 San Diego Directories listed Joseph and James G. Blaine as painters. Joe, Fanny, Lowell H. and wife Mona Indy all lived at 1107 National av. James G., Ethel and son, James G. Jr. lived nearby at 1228 4th Av.\n\nJoe C. Blaine passed away on April 27, 1935, in National City, San Diego County, California.\n\nBlain’s obituary was published in the “National City Star-News” on May 3 1935 (page 1):\n\n“Joe C. Blaine Dies After Long Illness.\n\nSaturday morning Joe C. Blaine, a resident of this city for the past 25 years, died in his home on National Avenue after an illness covering several months. Mr. Blaine was well known to the residents here and his family went to school and were married and live in the city. Funeral services were conducted Monday by Mr. Dawson Funeral Home, Rev. Mr. Royer of the Methodist church officiating. Mrs. Olive Requa accompanied at the piano while Verna Hawkins sang. Burial was made in the family plot at Greenwood. Mr. Blaine leaves, besides his widow, Mrs. Fannie Blaine, three daughters, Mrs. O. D. Kelly [Lena], Mrs. Lyle Duncan of this city, Mrs. Ernest Gibbs of San Francisco, and James G. and Lowell Blaine of this city.”\n\nNo mention of any past successes or ties to Kansas. His life was so much more than the twenty-five years spent in California, but you would never know it.\n\nIn 1988, Blaine’s granddaughter briefly jotted down a few small snippets about her Grandpa Joe. They are also posted to geni.com. I feel compelled to share a few, as these memories paint a pretty vivid picture of Joe Blaine through the eyes of a child:\n\nCalled Joe most of the time, but also went by Cal other times.\n\nHe always wore a dark suit, white shirt and black shoes.\n\nHe sang some songs to us when he visited\n\nOne of the songs he sang was, “The moon went down, to take a peek. Oh Talollie hoo, Oh tallollie hoo.”\n\nHe chewed tobacco\n\nHe talked in a kind of brittle mid-eastern drawl\n\nHe slept in the back bedroom off of the kitchen. His bed was in a corner.\n\nHe walked with a stoop and kept to himself.\n\nHe liked dogs and he owned a greyhound, a tall skinny dog.\n\nHe poured his coffee in a saucer to cool, and always drank with his little finger poised out.\n\nFanny outlived her husband by almost two decades. She continued to live at their home on National Avenue throughout the 1940s. By 1950, however, she moved in with her younger sister Mary and brother-in-law Albert Addis at 1532 E. Ave. in National City.\n\nFanny passed away on Nov. 4, 1954 in San Bernardino, California. She was 94 yrs. old at the time. I wonder if there was ever any regret about relocating to California, or any reflection that Joe’s greatest successes were left in the Midwest.\n\nTo be continued…"
