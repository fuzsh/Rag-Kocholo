Mustered out October 9, 1865.\n\nRegiment lost during service 6 Officers and 116 Enlisted men killed and mortally wounded and 3 Officers and 194 Enlisted men by disease. Total 319.\n\nWhen President Lincoln, in 1861, called upon the loyal North for volunteers to aid the government of the United States in suppressing the rebellion in the Southern States, the County of Clark responded nobly. It then had within its borders about 120 families and a population, all told, of approximately 800. There are no records attainable relative to any enlistments for three months service, if there were any, but the county furnished to one company of the 14th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry about thirty men. They were all enlisted and enrolled in Co. I of that regiment for three years, and when they left the state to take the field the company was in command of Captain Calvin It. Johnson, of Black River Falls, an able lawyer and a good soldier.\n\nThe Fourteenth Regiment, it is said, was one of the best that Wisconsin put in the field. It left the state early in March, 1862, and in less than thirty days was engaged in the battle of Shiloh, where it lost nearly 100 men in killed, wounded and missing. In October of the same year the regiment lost ninety-five men killed, wounded and missing at the battle of Corinth.\n\nThe members of this regiment were with Grant at Vicksburg, in 1863, and in a charge before that city in May of that year they sustained the loss of 107 men. On the surrender of Vicksburg the regiment was given the post of honor and led the advance of the troops on their entry into the surrendered city. The members of the Fourteenth also saw service on the Re River expedition and a portion of it was with General Sherman in his Atlanta campaign. Early in 1865 they were sent to New Orleans, and shortly after were engaged with the enemy at Spanish Fort until its surrender, and were in various skirmishes along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. They were not mustered out until Oct. 9, 1865, about six months after the surrender of Lee to Grant at Appomattox Court House. General Sherman, in his memoirs, referring to regiments from Wisconsin, states that her regiments were kept filled with recruits, whereas other states generally filled their quota by new regiments, and the result was that he estimated a Wisconsin regiment equal to an ordinary brigade. The following is a list of the members of Company I, Fourteenth Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry, who resided in Clark County at the time of their enlistment :\n\nAyers, Charles Bacon, Charles F. Bone, Chauncey Blakeslee, Wilson S. Covill, My G. Chamberlain, Benjamin Darling, Charles W. Foote, James W. Ferguson, Benjamin Folsom, Alexander Green, Edward Houghton, Joseph Ives, John F. King, George R. King, Louis Lynch, Edward H. Markey, Andrew J. Manley, William Neverman, John ONeill, Nelson Osgood, Henry Ross, Robert F. Sturdevant, John It. Sturdevant, Washington Short, Schlinsog, Cyrus 0. Sturgeon, Thomas Vine, Ferdinand C. Wage and Thomas Whitmore.\n\nCharles G. Bacon was wounded at the battle of Shiloh and died as the result of his wounds. He was a son of Orson Bacon, one of the early settlers in the town of Pine Valley. The entire farm of the elder Bacon is now comprised within the boundaries of the city of Neillsville, and is quite extensively built up with handsome residences. The Grand Army Post at Neillsville is named in honor and memory of young Bacon. The following is a list of the Clark County members of Company I, who were either killed, died of wounds, or lost their lives by disease in the South in their line of duty:\n\nCharles G. Bacon, John ONeill, Henry Ross, Washington Short, Thomas Whitmore, Louis Lynch, Ayers, Schlinsog. Louis Lynch was a son of James Lynch, who was early located at Neillsville, and lived upon the block where the Congregational Church is now situated. John ONeill was a son of James ONeill, the founder of Neillsville. Washington Shorts family is still prominent in the county. Henry Ross was a brother of Robert Ross, the lumberman, who, for years, resided at what is known as Ross Eddy, about a mile from Neillsville. Young Schlinsog was a son of Carl Schlinsog, and a brother of William Schlinsog, a prominent farmer citizen of the town of Grant.\n\nOf these men in 1909, Robert J. MacBride wrote: \"Since the close of the war many members have died, and at the present time there remain living only ten of the original number. Those now living are: James Ferguson, who resides in the state of Washington, and who is engaged in the hardware business at Wenatchee. George R. King, whose home is at Humbird in this county, is a son of George W. King, a prominent man in early days, who held the offices of member of assembly, district attorney, sheriff and clerk of county board of supervisors of the county. Thomas R. Vine is one of the survivors and his home is in the town of Warner, his post office address being Greenwood. Joseph Ives is at present living at the Soldiers Home in the state of Oregon, near the city of Portland. John Lt. Sturdevant is living in the city of Neillsville. He is known more familiarly as Rufe Sturdevant. Since the war he has held the offices of district attorney and county judge, and at present is one of the court commissioners of the Circuit Court for Clark County. Edward Houghton is now a resident of Tacoma, Wash. He was the county treasurer of Clark County for two years. In the war times his home was at Houghtonberg in the southwestern part of the county, now in the town of Mentor. The hamlet took its name from the family, of which he was a member. Robert S. Sturdevant, whose home is at Olympia in the state of Washington, was, after the war, register of deeds, and also district attorney of Clark County. After becoming a resident of Washington he has held in that state the offices of states attorney and served a term as district judge, a court corresponding to our Circuit Court in Wisconsin. Both the Sturdevants, Robert F. and J. B., are sons of James W. Sturdevant, one of the old settlers, who was a resident here at the time of the organization of the county. Wilson S. Covill is engaged in the hotel business at Olympia, Wash. He married at Neillsville Isabella S. ONeill, the eldest daughter of James ONeill our first settler. She was the first white child born in Clark County. Mr. Covill held the office of sheriff of Clark County during the years 1869 and 1870. Among those who died after returning from the war, and who had held official position in Clark County, were William T. Hutchinson and Edward H. Markey. Mr. Hutchinson died at Neillsville, Oct. 4, 1876, in the thirty-ninth year of his age. He held the office of county treasurer at the time of his death, and had held the office of register of deeds for several years. For some years he was in Partnership with Judge Dewhurst in the real estate business, under the firm name of Dewhurst & Hutchinson. Edward H. Markey died at Neillsville Sept. 15, 1894, and for some years was clerk of the Circuit Court. Mr. Markey, in the early days, drove stage and carried the mail twice a week from Black River Falls to Neillsville and Weston Rapids. While he was not a county official, Andrew J. Manley, in 1866, was a candidate for county treasurer, but was defeated at the polls by E. H. McIntosh Mr. Manley died a number of years ago in Minnesota Charles F. Bone, who died a few years ago at Rice Lake, in Barron County was a step-son of Samuel Ferguson one of the very earliest of the settlers was a printer by trade and set type on the Clark County Advocate Clark County Republican and Clark County Journal. As a boy he was slim in stature, but was always jolly and good natured. He left Neillsville and removed to Barron County, where he established the Rice Lake Chrono-type, and continued in the newspaper business until the time of his death. In his later years he became excessively stout and was a fair rival in that respect with his brother editor, the late Col. George C. Ginty, of Chippewa Falls. Mr. Bones son still publishes a newspaper at Rice Lake. It is interesting to state that the whole membership of Company I was made up substantially of residents of Clark and Jackson counties. It was a Black River company, and a number of surviving members now reside in Jackson County.\n\nWhen William Neverman came home from the Civil War he began a carpenter trade, which he continued at until 1870. In 1869 he built a brewery and this brewed about 500 to 600 barrels a year.\n\nLater he made additions and improvements the expense of which cost $2000. and yet again even later he made more improvements at a cost of $4000. He employed two hands and did an annual business of $4000.\n\nHe married on Nov 24/30,1865 to Miss Sophia Sontag of Jefferson Co. They would have seven children - Mary, Carl, Otto B, Dora, Rudolph G, Alma and Edna.\n\nHe was on the Board of Supervisors of Neillsville and belonged to the Sons of Hermann (a German fraternal organization) and the Foresters.\n\nWilliam Nevermans mother came to Clark Co, WI with him and lived out her life at his home. She died May 14,1894 of Brights Disease. She was eighty-eight years old. at her death.\n\nSophia (Sontag) Neverman died June 17,1889.After William Neverman took a homestead near Columbia, which he developed and later sold. In 1903 he moved to the state of WA. Where he lived until 1915.He returned to end his days at the Veterans Home at Waupaca, WI\n\nHe homesteaded a farm one and a half miles south of Columbia in 1895 and there he built a home and cleared quite a lot of acreage. When Bruno Schendland came from Germany he stayed with Mr. Neverman for several years.\n\n*Henry Schendland also bought lots at the Columbian Exhibition. He had been an electrician in Germany and returned in 1893. In 1898 he sent his wife and four children Alfred, Rudolph, Edwin and Hertha to Columbia and he followed two years later. They could not speak English and had no place to move Rudolph, who was known as Bruno, traveled throughout the west where he married.\n\nWilliam Nevermans son, Otto drove with his horses and buggy, taking many promoters and salesmen to farm sites they wanted to sell. After William Neverman returned to Neillsville Ed Everson of Viroqua, Ed Thome of Whitewater and Fred Masterson of Janesville lived in the house several years. After other married other tenants lived there.\n\nFrom an article from the Waupaca Republican newspaper we know that on June 19,1891 William Neverman attended the fourth annual reunion of the 14th WI Volunteer Infantry held at Waupaca, WI. where about 110 members of the various companies attended the reunion. They came from various parts of the State and Iowa, Indiana, Minnesota, and North Dakota.\n\nHeadquarters were established at Woodworths building south of the Vosburg House and the old brass field gun, which the 14th captured from the Rebels on the famous April 7,1862 was hauled up in front of the building having been tendered to the regiment by the state authorities at Madison, in whose care and keeping the gun was reposed.\n\nThis field gun was connected with the battle that ended its career for the Confederacy at the Battle of Pittsburgh Landing on the above date. After a furious battle General Halleck sent a member of his staff to learn what regiment had captured the battery and the result was the presentation of this gun to the 14th WI in recognition of its valor in the battle.\n\nBy Tuesday noon the town was fairly well decorated with red, white and blue and National flags were flying from many public and private buildings. It was touching sight to see the meetings of the old comrades as the trains brought in new reinforcements. In some cases the greetings were supplemented with a little beer but among the old Fourteenth the best of decorum and gentlemanly bearing was noticeable throughout the occasion. The veterans all went in a body to the afternoon train followed by their rebel pet, the above-mentioned cannon to meet Captain Magdeburg, wife and daughter and other members of the Regiment. Captain Magdeburg owns big milling interests in Milwaukee which he conducted with as much enthusiasm and interest as he commanded Company G on the famous march from Atlanta, GA. to the Sea with General Sherman.\n\nHe is president of the Regiment Association and his graceful seventeen year old daughter was voted the Daughter of the regiment at the reunion in DePere the year before.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon a grand parade was held headed by the Waupaca Brass Band and followed by the cannon and caisson drawn four horses, each horse with a little boy rider dressed up in artilleryman uniform. After the parade they were supposed to go to visit the Veterans Home and have a picnic dinner but the weather looked so much like rain that they waited in town for dinner, after which they out in carriages and wagons to the Home accompanied by the Waupaca band who played some excellent pieces on the balconies of the dining hall and headquarters building while the visitors inspected the surroundings.\n\nIn the evening was arranged at the Opera House. The band opened the exercises and was loudly applauded. The Mayor being sick, Senator JH Woodnorth gave a short address of welcome, which was responded to by Captain Magdeburn in which he said It is an honor to hold a reunion in a city that had sent so many brave soldiers to the front. There were perhaps just as good soldiers, but there were not better men that went to war than Company B commanded by your old townsman, the brave and gallant Major Worden. It is an honor to come to a city that has contributed so much toward the State Veterans Home, an institution that affords shelter and relief to many worthy and deserving old soldiers, their wives and widows of soldiers. We have seen with our own eyes the evidences of the worthiness of this grand Home.\n\nCapt. Magdeburg closed the evenings exercises by a truthful and well-written article on the life and services of Gen. W. T. Sherman. The Capt. being a warm personal friend of Gen. Sherman during and since the war felt that the reading of this paper was a duty he owed to his old commander\n\nThursday morning the association met and the following preamble and resolutions were unanimously adopted:\n\nWHEREAS, It has come to the notice of the society of the 14th Wis. Vet. Vol. INF.
