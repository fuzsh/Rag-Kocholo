Scorecard

Rain and bad light kept the final day to 31 overs at Bellerive Oval, where Tasmania took the only points in the draw due to their first-innings lead. When play was called off the Tigers had 4 for 129 in what had become a meaningless second innings with George Bailey on 64 and Luke Butterworth on 29.

Rain delayed the start substantially and when play finally resumed Tasmania added 90 to their overnight total for the loss of one wicket. Much of the interest on the final day was in how many victims Peter George would end up with for the match, having grabbed eight wickets in the first innings.

He finished with three in the second innings, making the only breakthrough on the fourth day when he had Daniel Marsh caught for 4. It meant George ended up with match figures of 11 for 131, the best analysis by a South Australia bowler in a Sheffield Shield/Pura Cup match since Paul Rofe picked up 13 in a game in 2001-02.
