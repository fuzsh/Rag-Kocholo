WESTERN Australia and Queensland will open the 2009-10 domestic cricket season with a one-day match at the WACA Ground on Sunday, October 11.

Cricket Australia on Tuesday announced the summer's domestic schedule, which will feature 31 Sheffield Shield matches, 31 one-dayers and 17 Twenty20 clashes.

The Sheffield Shield will also start in October, when South Australia host Tasmania from October 13.

Victoria, last summer's Shield winner, will open their four-day campaign against the Redbacks in Adelaide on October 30.

The Bushrangers and NSW will make later starts to their domestic seasons because of their participation in the Twenty20 Champions League in India, scheduled to be staged from October 8-23.

The Australian domestic Twenty20 tournament will begin in late December and conclude on January 23.

The Shield final has been scheduled for March 17-21 and the one-day final has been set for February 28.

The Women's National Cricket League will begin on October 23, when the ACT and South Australia play in Canberra and Western Australia host Victoria in Perth.
