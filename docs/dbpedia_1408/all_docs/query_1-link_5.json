        "text": "Template:Use dmy dates Template:Use Australian English\n\nGeorge John Bailey (born 7 September 1982) is an Australian cricketer. He represents the Tasmanian cricket team in Sheffield Shield and Ryobi One-Day Cup matches, and also plays Twenty20 cricket for the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League and the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League. Bailey was announced as Twenty20 captain of the Australian national cricket team in 2012, succeeding Cameron White, in a series that ended 1-1. He became the second ever Australian to captain an international game, without having played an international game before, after Dave Gregory in the first ever test match.[1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nAfter playing his junior cricket with the South Launceston Cricket Club, Bailey was first selected to play for Tasmania 2005/06, due to injuries to regular players. The season saw him score 778 runs, hitting three centuries in the process. Further prominent performances in the coming seasons saw Bailey play for Australia against the All Star team in the All Star Twenty20 match in 2009. Bailey was appointed as the permanent captain of Tasmania for the 2009/10 season, replacing Daniel Marsh.[2]\n\nOn 14 February 2011, Bailey led Tasmania to a remarkable five wicket Sheffield Shield win over Victoria where he scored an unbeaten 160. Needing 130 in the final session, he and James Faulkner pushed the Tigers past the total in the 91st over of play on the final day to lift Tasmania to second on the table behind New South Wales.[3] He captained Tasmania to its second Sheffield Shield title against New South Wales at Bellerive Oval in 2010/11.\n\nReferences[]\n\nCricinfo profile\n\nTemplate:S-startTemplate:Succession box Template:Succession box Template:Succession box Template:S-end\n\nTemplate:Current national cricket captains Template:Tasmanian Tigers current squad Template:Chennai Super Kings Squad Template:Melbourne Stars current squad Template:Australia T20I cricket captains Template:Tasmania Squad 2004/05 ING Cup Template:Tasmania Squad 2006/07 Pura Cup Template:Tasmania Squad 2007/08 Ford Ranger Cup\n\n{{{header}}} {{{body}}}\n\nTemplate:Australia Squad 2012 ICC World Twenty20\n\nTemplate:Persondata\n\nTemplate:Australia-cricketbio-stub\n\npl:George Bailey"
