        "text": "The sports that are popular in Australia can be very different to elsewhere around the world, and in addition there are regional differences in the popularity of sports, for example the most popular football code in Sydney is Rugby League, while in Melbourne it is Australian Football. Here is a discussion and lists of the most popular sports in Australia. See more lists of top sports by country.\n\nAussie Rules is the most popular sport to watch\n\nWe have three lists of popular sports in Australia that can be compared, the list of the most popular sports search terms, the list of attendance figures for sports in Australia, and the number of participants in sports and activities. Australian Rules Football is clearly the most popular spectator sport in Australia with huge crowds attending matches each Winter throughout Australia. However, in terms of participation more men play golf, cricket and tennis. Rugby league is another popular sport, but not as a sport to play.\n\nIt is also interesting to see that what people are interested in and search for online can be quite different to what they actually go to watch. It also highlights the difficulty in defining 'popular' sport - is it what people are most interested in, what they play the most or what they watch? The lists are summarized below.\n\nRelated Pages\n\nLists of top sports by country.\n\nOther top 10 lists of the world's most popular sports\n\nAll about sport in Australia\n\nOld Comments\n\nCommenting is closed on this page, though you can read some previous comments below which may answer some of your questions."
