        "text": "May 10, 2010 12:01am\n\nTHE Tasmanian Tigers might have landed themselves the chunky former Australian one-day batsman Mark Cosgrove.\n\nCricket Tasmania operations manager David Boon confirmed the former South Australian has been offered a contract for next season.\n\n\"He is obviously in the round-one transfer pool and we've had a chat to him and his management,\" Boon said.\n\n\"We've made the offer of a contract but it hasn't been confirmed as yet.\"\n\nThe Mercury believes the Tigers are well placed to beat Western Australia in signing him before Thursday's cut off for state contracts.\n\nCosgrove, 25, is in England playing county cricket for Glamorgan.\n\nThere has never been any doubting Cosgrove's talent, with the aggressive left-hander averaging 40 in both Sheffield Shield and one-day cricket last season.\n\nHe averaged 30 in the Redbacks Twenty20 campaign that took them to the Big Bash final and a spot in the lucrative Champions Trophy, and his inclusion would be a huge boost for the Tigers who have struggled in the shortest, highly profitable form of the game in the past two seasons.\n\nBut after disciplinary issues about his weight, he was cut by the Redbacks last month.\n\nBoon said CT was not concerned with these issues.\n\n\"I think he would be good for Tasmania,\" he said.\n\n\"He's obviously very talented, so if we can procure him in the next couple of days I think it will give us a pretty strong squad to go into the next season.\"\n\nwhat is this?Share this article\n\nGood signing. Although I never rated him as a potential Australian Test player as many did when he burst onto the scene, I think his actual performances in recent times have been extremely under-rated. He became a bit of a joke and there's been a lot said about him under-performing over the past few seasons but his numbers last season were perfectly fine. There seems to be this stigma about him suggesting his weight problems are making him bat like a clown but he's performances matched his quality last season IMO. Maybe it's just because I don't actually think the guy is good enough to average 65 in the Shield regularly but I wouldn't be complaining with his output last season at all - he averaged high 40s IIRC.\n\nRatio of 100's to 50's overall suggests some fitness issues there, though. If you're good enough to make it regularly past 50 at FC level, you're good enough to get past 100 regularly. Comes down to fitness and mindset, Cosgrove has a heap of scores either just past 50 or just below 100. That's the difference between averaging 45 and 55+.\n\nFor mine, the guy is uber-talented and if Tassie beat him into shape, good luck to them., reckon he'll be pushing hard for a ODI spot with a good start next year. As long as he scores a pair against SA, I'm happy.\n\nNewcastle eyeing berth in T20's bigger bash CHLOE SALTAU\n\nMay 12, 2010\n\nNEWCASTLE has emerged as a second serious bidder for a franchise in Cricket Australia's expanded domestic Twenty20 league.\n\nA group known as the Newcastle Cricket Promotion Committee, of which former Newcastle Knights chairman Michael Hill is a member, wants one of two new licences expected to become available when Cricket Australia finalises the structure of its expanded Big Bash competition.\n\nThe Herald reported in March that a group of influential business leaders in Geelong is preparing a similar bid. The preferred model for the expanded league was a topic of fierce debate among CA board members at a meeting last week, but Newcastle and Geelong have leapt on to the front foot to be ready when the Big Bash is re-launched, possibly for the post-Ashes summer of 2011-12.\n\nThe Newcastle bid comes three years after Cricket NSW recruited league hero Andrew Johns, drawing a crowd of 10,500 to a Blues match in Newcastle. As a marketing ploy, the Johns experiment worked - but it also trivialised a form of the game that even then was commanding greater importance and more dollars.\n\nNow Big Bash games in Sydney and Melbourne draw crowds in excess of 30,000, international stars capture the public imagination and the finalists compete for a multi-million-dollar prize at the Champions League Twenty20.\n\nNewcastle thinks a local team would attract private investors and tribal interest, and hopes to install drop-in pitches at Energy Australia Stadium, home of the Knights in the NRL and the Jets in the A-League.\n\n''If you take the Hunter Valley and the Central Coast, we've got a drawing area of over a million people,'' said group spokesman Graham Faraday.\n\n''We have a possible venue which has the infrastructure, the grandstands, the big screen, a ground that isn't huge but fits that kind of format, with lots of sixes and attractive cricket. You've got a huge supporter base of the Knights and the Jets football club as well, and we believe we would attract 20,000-plus to our games.''\n\nCA is weighing up whether to bring the two new teams under the umbrella of state associations or seek full-scale private ownership, which would rely on significant investment from India and potentially push back the starting date.\n\nThe Australian board is also moving towards the implementation of a designated window for the Big Bash tournament from 2011-12, thus allowing Australia's international cricketers to participate in the tournament. Brad Haddin last week said he would support the disruption to the Australian international program to participate in the Big Bash.\n\n''In the perfect world that would be outstanding,'' Haddin said. ''We've got a great tool in the Big Bash â€¦ It's one of the best Twenty20 comps in the world. If we get our international players playing that with a couple of overseas players, it's going to go from strength to strength.\n\nTassie and the SA squads finalised, expect the other states to have their squads finalised very soon aswell. I'm pretty sure victoria's were finalised like a week ago because when they signed Mark Cleary and confirmed Keath was staying that finalised it for them. We will wait and see.\n\nIt has been confirmed that Mark Cosgrove has signed with Tasmania. ( has hit some form with Glamorgan aswell.\n\nPKF Tigers 2010-11 contracts finalised\n\nWednesday, 12 May 2010\n\nThe PKF Tasmanian Tigers have today finalised their contract list for the 2010-11 cricket season which will see four new faces join the squad amongst a total of 19 full contracts and six rookie contracts.\n\nThe first-round contract list released last week confirmed the signing of some new faces to the PKF Tigers squad with New South Welshman and successful Sydney grade cricketer Steven Cazzulino granted a full contract and 19-year-old Tasmanian bowler Hamish Kingston added to the rookie list for 2010-11.\n\nCazzulino was the leading run scorer in the New South Wales grade cricket competition last season with 19 matches, 24 innings including three centuries with a high score of 204 and 1289 runs at 71.61.\n\nPKF Tigers new rookie Hamish Kingston will be joined by another exciting recruit in 20-year-old batsman Ashton May, who played in six Futures League matches for the ACT last season making 352 runs at an average of 50.28 with a high score of 135 not-out.\n\nThe PKF Tigers will also bring back 2009-10 KFC Twenty20 Big Bash Player of the Year Rana Naved, who will join the full contract list, while ex-South Australian left-handed batsman Mark Cosgrove has also recently signed with Tasmania.\n\n25-year-old Cosgrove is currently overseas playing county cricket for Glamorgan where he recently helped lift his side to a five-wicket win recording his best one-day score for the side with 86 from 78 balls.\n\nPKF Tasmanian Tigers' coach Tim Coyle said the 2010-11 squad looks strong and is confident the team can contend in all forms of the game.\n\n\"We are very pleased with our new inclusions to the squad which overall has a really good mix of youth and experience,\" Coyle said.\n\nChanges to the PKF Tigers squad from 2008-09 include the loss of Dan Marsh to retirement and the promotion of Tim Paine to a Cricket Australia contract, while Michael Dighton, John Rogers and Wade Irvine have all been de-listed.\n\nCricket Tasmania has until the 24th of December to sign their international KFC Twenty20 Big Bash player for the 2010-11 competition.\n\nPKF Tasmanian Tigers 2010-11 Contract List\n\nFull Contracts\n\nGeorge Bailey\n\nTravis Birt\n\nLuke Butterworth\n\nSteven Cazzulino (NEW)\n\nEd Cowan\n\nMark Cosgrove (NEW)\n\nGerard Denton\n\nXavier Doherty\n\nAlex Doolan\n\nBrendan Drew\n\nJames Faulkner\n\nBrett Geeves\n\nAdam Griffith\n\nJason Krejza\n\nRhett Lockyear\n\nTim MacDonald\n\nAdam Maher\n\nRana Naved (NEW)\n\nJonathan Wells\n\nRookies\n\nBrady Jones\n\nTom Triffitt\n\nJeremy Smith\n\nHamish Kingston (NEW)\n\nMatthew Day\n\nAshton May (NEW)\n\nCricket Australia Contracts\n\nRicky Ponting\n\nBen Hilfenhaus\n\nTim Paine (NEW TO CA LIST)\n\nRedbacks full 2010 - 2011 list released.\n\nExperienced fast bowler, Ben Edmondson (WA) and all-rounder, Tim Lang (NSW) have been added to the squad, rounding out the list that was submitted to Cricket Australia today.\n\nMr Cox said Edmondson, 31 and Lang, 29 were selected to boost the Redbacksâ€™ fast bowling stocks and provide support to younger members of the team.\n\nIn addition to the full-contracted players, the Redbacks have named six rookies, including exciting young all-rounder Kane Richardson.\n\nMr Cox said all players will meet in Adelaide shortly, with the squad to begin pre-season fitness training later this month.\n\nRedbacks 2010-11 contracted players:\n\n1.

If we get our international players playing that with a couple of overseas players, it's going to go from strength to strength.\n\nInteresting. What would the make up of the team be? I'd suggest it would have to be made up of mainly Sydney grade players with major signings thrown in, not local Newcastle players.\n\nHave played a bit of cricket against Newcastle teams. They have some handy players but couldn't possibly compete."
