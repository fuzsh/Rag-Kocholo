        "text": "South Africa, New Zealand, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have been confirmed as Australia’s opponents for the 2016-17 summer, but the fate of a proposed day-night Test in Adelaide remains clouded.\n\nCricket Australia will continue efforts to persuade South Africa that the third Test of their upcoming series at the Adelaide Oval should be played under lights using a pink ball, with the visitors yet to agree to the timing of the match.\n\nCA today released the men's international schedule for the 2016-17 Australian summer with up to 41 days of international cricket across all formats scheduled, including six Test matches.\n\nImage Id: ~/media/1D4EDFBF9B3B48D5B5546C77F92B094F Image Caption: The current No.1 ranked Test nation will play six Tests this summer // Getty\n\nSouth Africa and Pakistan will each play a three-Test series against the home side – the first Test against Pakistan confirmed as a day-night match at the Gabba – and Pakistan will also play a series of five one-day internationals in January.\n\nThe third Test against South Africa has been confirmed to be hosted at Adelaide, but it is not yet certain it will be a day-night fixture, with South Africa’s players reportedly unwilling to face the pink ball.\n\nQuick Single: Steyn would 'love' to play day-night Test\n\nThe Black Caps will tour in early December for a three-match ODI series to defend the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, the matches scheduled in between the South Africa and Pakistan Test series'. And three T20 matches against Sri Lanka have been pencilled in for mid-February but venues are yet to be confirmed.\n\nProteas yet to accept pink-ball Test\n\nAustralia and New Zealand took part in the first-ever day-night Test last November, the match declared an enormous success by administrators after more than 123,000 fans streamed through the gates of the Adelaide Oval across three days and an average of two million fans watched on television.\n\nPakistan had no hesitation in agreeing to a day-night Test in Brisbane in December, but the Proteas are yet to commit.\n\nSouth Africa's reluctance stems from the fact none of their players have played with a pink ball under lights, while Australia's players have the experience of last summer's Test and several day-night Sheffield Shield matches in recent years.\n\nThe third Test has been confirmed for 24-28 November in Adelaide, but it remains to be seen if it will be played with a pink ball or a traditional red ball during the day.\n\nCA CEO James Sutherland said he would continue to work with Cricket South Africa with a view to ensuring the Test is a day-night contest.\n\nImage Id: ~/media/496C459FB8794E8A867B7162FCD56EDA Image Caption: The 2015 day-night Test broke crowd and television viewing records // Getty\n\n\"There is enormous expectation that we deliver another pink-ball Test match this summer in Adelaide,\" said Sutherland.\n\n\"Understandably, there is some concern from the South African players, but day-night Test cricket is all about the fans and a day-night match in Adelaide will be a bigger Test match crowd than the South African players will have ever experienced.\n\n\"The success of Adelaide last year demonstrates the huge potential the day-night format has in revitalising Test cricket all over the world, and it’s for that reason that it is our desire to stage another Test under lights at that venue.\n\n\"We believe that having the ability to move matches into the evenings provides cricket fans with greater access to the game, both at the ground and at home on TV, and there is no doubt that this will help grow interest in Test cricket.\n\n\"Even for cricket fans at home in South Africa there are benefits. The day-night Test hours will allow the match to be televised in a far more attractive time of day in South Africa.\"\n\nA day Test in Adelaide would start at 2am South African time, while a day-night Test would start at 5.30am, making viewing much more palatable.\n\nImage Id: ~/media/64D8D6661BD547B2ADCE0A138E8BDB39 Image Caption: The Proteas will be looking to repeat their 2012 series win // Getty\n\nDespite the possibility of playing a day-night tour match leading into the Test, as NZ did last year, the Proteas believe a pink-ball Test would hand the Australians a significant advantage.\n\n\"Our players are not in favour of playing the game under those conditions,\" Tony Irish, the head of South Africa's Players' Association, told News Ltd.\n\n\"The main reason is we feel disadvantaged. Not one of our players who will compete in that Test has played Test match cricket or any cricket with a pink ball.\n\n\"The reluctance to play is a sign of how much importance the South African players place on the series against Australia.\"\n\nThe Proteas have won their past two Test series in Australia, in 2008-09 and 2012-13.\n\nGabba to host day-night Test\n\nIn another major change to the international summer, the first Test will not be played at the Gabba for the first time in 13 years, with the WACA Ground in Perth to host the Proteas from November 3.\n\nWhile the Gabba has lost the opening Test of the summer, it will host the first of the Pakistan series, Brisbane’s maiden day-night Test to be held on December 15-19.\n\nThe Test will mark the 85th anniversary of the first Test played at the Gabba and will be take place at the start of the school holiday period in an effort to maximise crowd attendances.\n\n\"We believe that Queensland’s climate really lends itself to Test cricket in day-night conditions, making for a great fan experience,\" Sutherland said.\n\n\"Pakistan should be applauded for committing to and supporting the day-night Test initiative\n\n\"Their current bowling line up will put our batsmen to the test and I have no doubt this will be their major strength in the series.\n\n\"Day-night Test cricket, combined with this attack, will promise fans an exciting spectacle and we look forward to seeing a packed Gabba to welcome them.\"\n\nImage Id: ~/media/DBA5A3C63B8B488D90FCE45F2808AD10 Image Caption: Pakistan will play Tests in Australia for the first time since 2009-10 // Getty\n\nSince becoming a regular Test venue in the 1970s, the Gabba has more often than not hosted the opening Test of the international summer and Australia have built an imposing record there having not lost since 1988.\n\nPerth has been used as an alternative venue for the first Test a number of times, notably between 1981 and 1985 when the WACA was the scene of the summer’s first Test against Pakistan (twice), England and the West Indies respectively.\n\nPerth was also preferred for the summer’s first Test when New Zealand toured in 1989-90 and again in 1993-94, and for Zimbabwe’s sole Test series (to date) in Australia in 2003-04.\n\nAdelaide hosted the first Test of the 2014-15 summer, but that was due to a late change in the schedule following the sudden passing of Australia batsman Phillip Hughes.\n\nPakistan will also play in the traditional Boxing Day and New Year's Tests in Melbourne and Sydney respectively before a five-match ODI series that will conclude with an Australia Day clash in Adelaide.\n\nThe ODIs will be followed by the three-match KFC T20INTL Series against Sri Lanka on February 17, 19 and 22.\n\nChappell-Hadlee series returns to Australia\n\nThe Test summer will be separated by an ODI series for the first time since 2007-08, the three-match Chappell-Hadlee Trophy series against NZ to be played in Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne on December 4, 6 and 9.\n\nIt's the first time the Trophy will be contested in Australia since 2008-09 and is part of a commitment last year between the two nations to stage six ODI series over a four-year-period.\n\nImage Id: ~/media/20FB48266BD0438ABF4045278EF8C8AB Image Caption: NZ retained the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy earlier this year // Getty\n\nThe two sides will play a return leg in New Zealand in early 2017.\n\nNew Zealand are the current holders of the Trophy having won the three-match series in NZ 2-1 earlier this year. Both nations have won 12 Chappell-Hadlee matches since the concept was introduced in 2004.\n\nSouth Africa to play a Test in Hobart for the first time\n\nFollowing the opening Test of the summer in Perth, Australia and South Africa will travel to Hobart for the second Test on November 12-16.\n\nIt will be the first time the Proteas have played a Test at Blundstone Arena and just the second time they've played an international against Australia in Tasmania following a ODI between the two sides in 2009.\n\nAfter 15,343 fans watched Australia thrash the West Indies inside three days in Hobart last summer, Sutherland is hopeful the prospect of a more competitive contest between the current first- and third-ranked Test nations will entice locals to attend.\n\nImage Id: ~/media/92CA1A880172460CA8FC6595F29E0201 Image Caption: Hobart will host South Africa in a Test match for the first time // Getty\n\n\"We have worked very closely with Cricket Tasmania to provide some certainty over match content for the coming years, which we hope will grow interest and demand for attending international matches at Blundstone Arena, which is now a truly world-class venue,\" Sutherland said.\n\n\"This year’s match between Australia and South Africa presents a great opportunity for Tasmanian cricket fans to see two of the world’s great teams in action. We know how much Tasmanians love their cricket and we hope to see them in full force for this great fixture.\n\n\"This is a vital match for Australia and we know that the team will want to see a big turnout from Tasmanians to support them.\"\n\nMen's International Schedule, 2016-17\n\nCommonwealth Bank Test Series v South Africa\n\n3 – 7 November: WACA Ground, Perth\n\n12 – 16 November: Blundstone Arena, Hobart\n\n24 – 28 November: Adelaide Oval, Adelaide\n\nVictoria Bitter One Day International Series v New Zealand\n\n4 December: SCG, Sydney\n\n6 December: Manuka Oval, Canberra\n\n9 December: MCG, Melbourne\n\nCommonwealth Bank Test Series v Pakistan\n\n15 – 19 December: Gabba, Brisbane (Day-Night Test)\n\n26 – 30 December: MCG, Melbourne\n\n3 – 7 January: SCG, Sydney\n\nVictoria Bitter One Day International Series v Pakistan\n\n13 January: Gabba, Brisbane\n\n15 January: MCG, Melbourne\n\n19 January: WACA, Perth\n\n22 January: SCG, Sydney\n\n26 January: Adelaide Oval, Adelaide\n\nKFC T20INTL Series v Sri Lanka\n\n17 February: venue TBD\n\n19 February: venue TBD\n\n22 February: venue TBD\n\nTickets to the 2016-17 international summer of cricket will go on sale from 31 May 2016.
