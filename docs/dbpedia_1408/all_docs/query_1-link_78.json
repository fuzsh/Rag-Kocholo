        "text": "DESPERATE South Australia will open their chequebook to stop a batting and leadership malaise escalating to outright calamity next season.\n\nState selectors went back to the future in anointing keeper Graham Manou to replace out-of-form batsman Nathan Adcock as Pura Cup skipper.\n\nVeteran Adcock continues as one-day leader. It is understood SACA will pursue a headline act who can rebuild respect for SA cricket eroded through a decade of under-achievement. Addressing a systemic inability of batsmen to conquer quality bowling on or around off-stump must be a priority for SACA and high performance manager Rod Marsh, currently in Dubai.\n\nRegardless, there will be a comprehensive search for quality batting reinforcements.\n\nState chairman of selectors Paul Nobes indicated any recruiting process would begin next month. \"The bowling has been good and if we had been able to get our batting together we would have been flying. We haven't discussed long-term plans but that will happen within the next six weeks, once the season ends.\"\n\nTailender Jason Gillespie has the best average - 309 runs at 44.1 - of any Redbacks batsman to have played more than two games this season. SA's batting stocks are in a parlous state.\n\nMiddle order-batsman Callum Ferguson has the best statistics of the top six batsmen with 330 runs at a modest 36.7. Openers Matthew Elliott, Shane Deitz, forgotten tyro Mark Cosgrove, rookie Andy Delmont and Adcock all average less than 30 in the four-day competition this season.\n\nThe Redbacks' poor batting has also conspired to eliminate spin twins Cullen Bailey and Dan Cullen being chosen together with the attack perennially defending small totals.\n\nFilling the leadership void left by Darren Lehmann will not be easy, while SA cricket's record of internal instability will make it hard to attract a quality general.\n\nInterim skipper Manou will command the fourth-placed Redbacks for the final three games of the 2007-08 campaign. \"Choc\" Manou returns to favour a year after being dropped as vice-captain and custodian in favour of Deitz.\n\nSA has long coveted the services of Victorian run machine David Hussey but, now on the verge of Test selection, he is unlikely to switch states.\n\nA hardened first-class warrior like Hussey, Western Australia's injured skipper Marcus North or a white knight in the mould of former Test opener Justin Langer would be ideal candidates to steer SA.\n\nYounger leaders like Tasmania's George Bailey or Victoria's Cameron White would represent bold, exciting leadership options.\n\nIt is expected SACA, awash with funds, will move to address the Redbacks' silverware drought dating back to the Sheffield Shield win of 1995-96."
