        "text": "IN less than 12 months the Blundstone Arena pitch has turned from a batting minefield to a backbreaking graveyard for bowlers.\n\nAfter the first three Sheffield Shield games last season yielded an average first innings score of less than 100, Cricket Australia introduced an inspection policy to ensure wickets were up to scratch, with states potentially stripped of points for substandard offerings.\n\nBut if England's effort on day one of the tour match against Australia A is any indication, the days of the pitch being dubbed \"The Incredible Hulk\" - because it had such a strong green tinge to it - are long gone.\n\nThe tourists cruised to 0-318 on Wednesday, with skipper Alastair Cook (154) and Michael Carberry (153) largely untroubled throughout the day on a deck that after the first hour was as flat as a pancake.\n\nIt is almost a throwback to the mid to late 1990s and early 2000s, where often it seemed the only way to manufacture a Shield result was through multiple declarations and a large fourth innings run chase.\n\nSix of the eight highest successful fourth innings domestic run chases at Bellerive came prior to 2009-10.\n\nIn fairness, the resurfacing of Bellerive ahead of the start of last season meant the wicket took time to settle down, with Australia A gloveman Tim Paine declaring Wednesday unfolded similar to the end of Tasmania's 2012-13 campaign.\n\n\"The last half of last season it started to play that way, the start of last year it was obviously a brand new wicket, they cut the top off the ground so it played quite strangely for four or five Shield games,\" Paine said after day one.\n\n\"But towards the end of the season that's what we started to get a lot of.\n\n\"We certainly would like to see a bit more bounce and evenness in it, but that's what it is at the moment and we have to learn to play well on it, it was hard to get wickets today.\n\n\"We probably didn't use the new ball as well as we could of, we didn't bowl badly but certainly we were probably a fraction short.\n\n\"They (England) also played very well.\"\n\nA look at statistics from Tasmania's past four years also dispel the myth the venue has been a nightmare for batsmen and heaven for bowlers.\n\nSince crossing from NSW Ed Cowan has scored 1728 runs at an average of 59.5 at Bellerive - significantly better than his 874 at 31.2 on the road.\n\nIn fact, of the Tigers' leading run scorers in the past four years, only Alex Doolan has a better average away from Hobart.\n\nOf the pacemen, all-rounder Luke Butterworth averages 18.3 on the road compared to 24.9 at home, while James Faulkner, Jackson Bird and Ben Hilfenhaus don't have inflated figures, often suggested from playing regularly in Tasmania."
