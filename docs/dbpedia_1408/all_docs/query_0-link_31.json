        "text": "This week’s side is players that played just one Test for Australia. I have also included a side that played just one Test that was against Australia though there is an exception with one of these players Tests not against Australia. Normally my sides are from 1980 but I snuck a few from the 1970s that played but they were playing Shield cricket in the 1980s and even made a Test tour. The inspiration for this side is a book I recently read in by Ken Piesse called ‘Fifteen minutes of Fame’ where he has a chapter with three or four pages on each player.\n\nI have not included Will Pucovski as he is still young enough to add to his total.\n\nThe First XI\n\nPaul Hibbert – Vic\n\n1977, 15 runs, HS 13, average 7.50\n\nHibbert was 25 when he debuted against India in Brisbane in the First Test of 1977-1978. This series was the first since Kerry Packer’s World Series and Hibbert was one of six debutants with Wayne Clark, Tony Mann, David Ogilvie, Steve Rixon, and Peter Toohey. Hibbert was dropped for John Dyson for the Second Test. He played first class cricket until 1986-1987 and made 4,790 runs at an average of 39 with highest score of 163. Hibbert is one of only two men to make a century without hitting a boundary.\n\nWayne Phillips – Vic\n\n1992, 22 runs, HS 14, average 11\n\nPhillips was 29 when he was brought into the Australian side to replace vice-captain Geoff Marsh for the Fifth Test against India in Perth. Marsh was a West Australian, so this was not a popular decision for the locals nor captain Allan Border who loved his vice-captain. Phillips was not picked for the tour to Sri Lanka. Phillips started 1992-1993 strong with 205 against NSW and was selected for the ACB XI in Hobart where he scored 40 and 1 but missed out for the First Test and was never really close again. Phillips played until 1994-1995, made 3,859 runs and averaged 39.\n\nCallum Ferguson – SA\n\n2016, 4 runs, HS 3, average 2\n\nFerguson was 31 when selected for the Second Test against South Africa in Hobart and made his debut with Joe Mennie. Ferguson came in for Mitch Marsh and was run out for three in the first innings which took Australia to 5/17 before a total score of 85. He was dropped for the Third Test with Adam Voges in the middle order replaced by Peter Handscomb and Nic Maddinson. Ferguson played 30 one day matches for Australia from 2009-2011 and averaged 41 with a top score of 71*. Ferguson was a member of the 2011 World Cup Squad and averaged 37 in 147 first class matches with top score of 213.\n\nStuart Law – Qld\n\n1995, 54 runs, HS 54*, 3-0-9\n\nLaw was 27 when selected in the First Test against Sri Lanka in Perth. Law debuted with Ricky Ponting, but was only in because of an injury to Steve Waugh who returned for the next Test. Chasing 251 Australia scored 5/617 with Law and Ponting having a 121 partnership before Ponting was dismissed for 96. Law played 54 ODIs for Australia between 1994-1999 at an average of 27 with a top score of 110 and took 12 wickets. He was a member of the 1996 World Cup Squad and played 367 first class matches from 1988-2009, made 27,080 at an average of 50, scored 79 hundreds and took 83 wickets.\n\nJeff Moss – Vic\n\n1979, 60 runs, HS 38*, average 60\n\nMoss was 31 when selected for Australia against Pakistan in the Second Test at the WACA. Moss replaced Yallop in the side and did not get another chance as when Australia resumed in 1979-1980 the World Series Cricketers were then available. He was selected for the 1979 World Cup where he played one game against Pakistan and made 7. Moss played for Victoria until 1982-1983 and made 3,416 runs at an average of 44 with top score of 220.\n\nShaun Young – Tas\n\n1997, 4 runs, HS 4, average 4, 8-0-13\n\nYoung was 27 and playing county cricket for Gloucestershire in 1997 when he was selected for Australia in the Sixth Test against England at The Oval. Young and Kasprowicz were bought in for Jason Gillespie who was injured and Paul Reiffel who had gone home for the birth of his child. Australia was down to two quicks as Andy Bichel had gone home injured and Brendon Julian was also injured. Young and Shane Lee were both playing in England and auditioned for the match with games against Kent. Young played for Tasmania until 2001-2002 and in 138 first class matches made 7,212 runs at an average of 38 with top score of 237 and also took 274 wickets with best figures of 7/64.\n\nJames Faulkner – Tas\n\n2013, 45 runs, HS 23, average 22.50, 5 wickets, best bowling 4/51\n\nJames is the son of South African Rebel cricketer Peter and was 23 when he debuted against England in the Fifth Test at The Oval when he replaced Usman Khawaja. Faulkner made 23 off 21 balls in the first innings and then batted number three in the second innings to make quick runs – 22 off 22 balls. He claimed five wickets for the Test with Ian Bell his first wicket. Faulkner did not come under consideration in the 2013/2014 Ashes but remained in the one day side where he played 69 games from 2013-2017, made 1,032 at an average of 34, high score 116 and took 96 wickets. Faulkner was man of the match in the 2015 World Cup Final.\n\nPhil Emery – NSW\n\n1994, 8 runs, HS 8*, 5 catches, 1 stumping\n\nEmery was 30 when he got his chance to play for Australia for an injured Ian Healy. Emery’s debut was in the Third Test against Pakistan in Lahore. He claimed five catches and a stumping. Emery also made 8*, having come in as night watchman he broke his thumb and retired hurt before returning later in the innings. He also played 121 games for NSW where he averaged 26, took 337 catches and made 47 stumpings. Emery may best be remembered for an inglorious moment in 1994-1995 when Australia A played Australia and he was bowled by David Boon (not a noted wicket taker).\n\nMick Malone – WA\n\n1977, 46 runs, HS 46, average 46, 6 wickets, best bowling 5/63\n\nMalone was 26 when selected for the Fifth Test against England at The Oval. Malone came in for Lenny Pascoe and took 5/63 with England captain Mike Brearley his first wicket and then quickly followed up with Derek Randall and Tony Greig for a duck. He then made 46 in a 100 run partnership for the ninth wicket with Ray Bright. Despite an impressive debut Malone did not play another Test as he joined World Series Cricket. When the World Series players rejoined the establishment Malone toured Pakistan in 1980 without playing a Test. In 1981-1982 he replaced an injured Terry Alderman in the one day series against Pakistan and West Indies. Malone was an economical player: eight games for nine wickets with a best of 2/9 and economy of three runs an over. Selected 12th man for the Third Test against the West Indies in Adelaide, Malone retired at the end of 1981-1982. He played a total of 73 matches for 260 wickets at an average of 24.\n\nIan Callen – Vic\n\n1978, 26 runs, HS 22*, 6 wickets, best bowling 3/83\n\nCallen debut aged 22 made his debut against India in the Fifth Test in Adelaide replacing Sam Gannon.
