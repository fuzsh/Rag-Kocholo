        "text": "Cameron Green was earmarked as an international cricket from very early. Contracted to Western Australia as a schoolboy, he took 5 for 24 on his first-class debut against Tasmania in February 2017 as a 17-year-old. He was selected initially for his bowling given his 200cm frame and his ability to deliver fast outswing but was plagued by stress fractures. However, throughout his junior days with Subiaco-Floreat and WA’s junior teams, his technically sound batting and an unquenchable thirst for scoring runs saw him emerge as a genuine allrounder of rare ability.\n\nGreen didn’t play any first-class cricket in 2017-18 and spent the 2018 winter at Cricket Australia’s National Performance Centre in Brisbane. His game went to another level in 2019-20 after another stress fracture in his lower back forced him to stop bowling again. He made his maiden first-class century, producing scores of 87* and 121* to force an extraordinary draw against Queensland at the Gabba. He would score two more centuries that summer before posting a career-best 197 from 438 balls against New South Wales in October 2020.\n\nThat performance led to his first international call-up as he was named in Australia’s ODI and T20I squads to face a touring India side which was followed by a Test debut against the same opposition. He made half-centuries in each of his first four series then claimed a maiden five-wicket haul against South Africa the MCG in late 2022 – during a game where he badly broke his finger. Shortly after returning to side in India he made a maiden Test hundred in Ahmedabad.\n\nBy then, his cross-format skills had caught the eye after a pair of dazzling T20I fifties in India led to a bidding war in the 2022 IPL auction where Green fetched AU$3.15 million from Mumbai Indians.\n\nCameron Green Biography\n\nCameron Green Physical Statistics\n\nCameron Green Profile\n\nCameron Green is a young prodigy who rose through the ranks through grade cricket and burst onto the domestic scene with a 5-for on debut at the age of just 17. A precocious talent, the young fast bowler became the youngest bowler to take a five-wicket haul in the history of Shield cricket. Standing at 6’6 feet tall, Green bowls a ‘heavy’ ball and isn’t afraid of doing the grunt work. Add to that his exceptional batting talent and the ability to float up and down the order and it’s quickly evident why he’s rated so highly. That’s not even mentioning his fielding abilities – often snaffling half-chances at gully and backward points by using his extensive reach.\n\nGreen’s junior days were marred with injury and he had an injury scare during his 2nd Sheffield game as well, when he managed to dislocate his knee during warm-ups. However, this was immediately taken care of by the physio at the ground and he was cleared to continue playing.\n\nHis lower-order pinch-hitting talent came to the fore when he scored a 45 in his second first-class game, biffing three monstrous sixes off Baggy Green-holder James Pattinson, and extending his team’s lead from 104 to 168 while he was at the crease. In his second outing with the ball in that match, he ended with figures of 3/20, including the timely wickets of opposition skipper Cameron White and Dan Christian to earn his side an innings win for which he earned praise from his captain Adam Voges.\n\nHe made his List A debut in the tour match against Pakistan for the Cricket Australia XI and bagged 3 wickets, including that of veteran batsman Shoaib Malik, and bothered the Pakistan players with his accurate and rapid seam bowling. The prodigious teenager was handed a rookie contract by the Perth Scorchers ahead of the 2017/18 season.\n\nImpressive performances in the domestic circuit earned him his maiden Australia call-up for the tour to India in late 2020. He made both his ODI and Test debut in December 2020. His T20I debut came in the following year and he was named in Australia’s squad for the 2022 T20 World Cup as a replacement for an injured Josh Inglis. His maiden Test 5-fer came in the Boxing Day Test against South Africa in 2022.\n\nAhead of the 2023 IPL, Cameron Green was swept up by the Mumbai Indians for a whopping sum of INR 17.5 crore and this made him the second most expensive overseas player in the history of the IPL. That same season, Green scored his maiden IPL century, a 100* against the Sunrisers Hyderabad while opening the batting. Green’s maiden Test century came just a few months later in a Test against India at Ahmedabad where he scored 114. He was also a part of the Australian team that won the World Test Championship.\n\nGreen was named in Australia’s squad for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.\n\nCameron Green Career Stats\n\nBatting & Fielding\n\nBowling\n\nCameron Green IPL Auction Price History\n\nCameron Green’s Social Media Accounts\n\nSome Lesser-Known Facts About Cameron Green"
