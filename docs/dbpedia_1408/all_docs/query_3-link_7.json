        "text": "Template:David Warner cricket David Andrew Warner (born 27 October 1986) is an Australian cricketer. A quick-scoring left-handed opening batsman, Warner is the first Australian cricketer in 132 years to be selected for a national team in any format without experience in first-class cricket.[1] He currently plays for New South Wales, the Delhi Daredevils and the Sydney Sixers.[2]\n\nEarly life[]\n\nDavid Andrew Warner was born at Paddington, a suburb in eastern Sydney, New South Wales.[3] At the age of 13 he was asked by his coach to switch to right-handed batting because he kept hitting the ball in the air. However one season later he went back to batting left-handed and broke the U/16's run scoring record for the Sydney Coastal Cricket Club. He then made his first grade debut for the Eastern Suburbs club at the age of 15 and later toured Sri Lanka with the Australian under-19s and earned a rookie contract with the state team.[4]\n\nWarner attended Matraville Public School and Randwick Boys High School.[5]\n\nCareer[]\n\nWarner is known for favouring the aerial route with his aggressive left-handed batting style, and ability to switch hit, using the back of his bat or by taking a right-handed stance. He is an athletic fielder and also a part-time spin bowler. His bowling style is unique in that he mixes off-spin bowling with his more usual leg-spin bowling. At just 170cms Warner generates his power from strong forearms and uses his low centre of gravity to get underneath deliveries and hit them high in the air. In a Twenty20 match for New South Wales in 2009, he hooked a six off Shaun Tait that landed on the roof of the Adelaide Oval, only a month after hooking the same bowler 20 rows back at the SCG.[6]\n\nWarner's breakthrough innings for the New South Wales Blues came against Tasmania when he smashed 165* to record the highest one day score by a Blues player ever.[7] Warner later backed this up with a 54-ball 97 also against Tasmania to narrowly miss the record for the fastest ever century in Australian domestic cricket.[8]\n\nThis introduction to the domestic scene led to Warner being included in Australia's Twenty20 squad in January 2009.[9] Warner made his international debut for Australia in a Twenty20 International against South Africa at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 11 January 2009. He made an immediate impact, scoring 89 off 43 balls with 7 fours and 6 sixes, including the then second-fastest fifty in Twenty20 International history.[10] Warner was just 11 runs short of becoming only the second player after Chris Gayle to score a Twenty20 International century. His 89 was the second highest score on Twenty20 international debut; and the equal fifth highest score ever in Twenty20 internationals.[11] On 23 February 2010, playing a Twenty20 international against the West Indies at the Sydney Cricket Ground, he made a stunning 67 off just 29 balls. His 50 coming in at just 18 balls, breaking his old record of 19 and it became the second fastest 50 in Twenty20 International history after Yuvraj Singh.[12]\n\nWarner finally made his first-class debut playing for New South Wales against Western Australia in the final match of the 2008–09 Sheffield Shield competition at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 5–8 March 2009. Batting only once and coming in at number six in the batting order, Warner scored 42 runs off 48 deliveries.[13]\n\nOn 7 October 2011, Warner became the first cricketer to score consecutive Twenty20 hundreds, when he followed up an unbeaten 135 against Chennai Super Kings with an unbeaten 123 against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Both matches were in the Champions League.[14]\n\nHe made his Test debut on 1 December 2011 against New Zealand at Brisbane, Queensland in the first Test of the Trans-Tasman Trophy due to an injury to Shane Watson. He made a disappointing 3 runs in the first innings. In the second innings he scored 12 not out off just 4 balls, scoring the winning runs with a pull shot through mid on.\n\nWarner scored his first test hundred on 12 December 2011 in Australia's unsuccessful run chase against New Zealand in Hobart. Warner made 123 not out in his side's second innings total of 233. In doing so he became just the sixth person to carry his bat through the fourth innings of a test match.[15] Warner bowls a Right Arm Leg-Break and on his first delivery in Test Match Cricket, the ball was dropped in the outfield denying Warner a maiden Test Match Wicket.\n\nOn 13 January 2012, in only his fifth test match, Warner scored a 69-ball century against India at the WACA. At the time, this equalled West Indian Shivnarine Chanderpaul for the fourth fastest test century of all time, in terms of balls faced.[16] He ultimately built his innings to a score of 180 from 159 balls, setting a new personal high score in test match cricket.\n\nWarner scored 163 off 157 balls at the Gabba on 4 March 2012 in the first final of the CB Series against Sri Lanka. He batted until the last ball of the innings. It was his first ODI hundred for Australia. He followed it up with 100 and 48 in the other two finals at the Adelaide Oval. Warner's aggregate of 311 runs was the highest ever for the finals of a tri-series tournament in Australia, surpassing Greg Chappell's 266 runs in 1981.[17]\n\nDavid Warner changed record Australian one-day score He ate lots of innings, which came off just 141 balls and get 197 scores included 20 fours and 10 sixes, surpassed Jimmy Maher's previous high of 187 achieved 10 years ago in Brisbane.[18]\n\nIndian Premier League[]\n\nWarner was signed by IPL team Delhi Daredevils for the 2009–10 seasons.[19] During the 2009 tournament which was played in South Africa, Warner played in seven games, scoring 163 runs at an average of 23.28 and with a strike-rate of 123.48. His top score was 51.[20]\n\nIn the fourth season, Warner was contracted by Delhi Daredevils for US$750,000. In the fifth season he made a century in 54 balls.\n\nKFC Big Bash[]\n\nWarner made a record in KFC Big bash by completing his half century in 18 balls against Tasmania. The earlier record was held by George Bailey, who completed his half century in 19 balls.\n\nIn the first season of the newly re-vamped Big Bash League, Warner was named as Captain for the Sydney Thunder and in his first match for the Thunder scored 102 not out off just 51 balls with a Strike Rate of 200 runs per 100 balls and set the record for the most career sixes in the KFC Big Bash League with 38, previously held by David Hussey.\n\nEnglish County Cricket 2009[]\n\nWarner has played for English County Champions Durham for the English cricket domestic season.[21]\n\n2013 ICC Champions Trophy[]\n\nOn 12 June 2013, Warner was dropped for Australia's second match in 2013 ICC Champions Trophy match against New Zealand following an attack on an England cricketer.[22] It later emerged that this player was Joe Root. The event happened hours after Saturday's loss to England at Edgbaston earlier that day.[23] According to the sports journalist Pat Murphy, the incident took place at 2am at the Walkabout bar in the centre of Birmingham, UK. On 13 June 2013, the Australian Cricket Team announced that Warner was to be fined £7,000 (AU $11,500) and would not play for his country until the first Ashes' test on 10 July 2013. Warner subsequently missed the rest of the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy and the tour matches against Somerset and Worcestershire.[24]\n\nWarner attracted further controversy soon after. On 27 July 2013, whilst playing for Australia A against South Africa A in Pretoria he was involved in an on-field altercation with South Africa A wicket-keeper Thami Tsolekile. This was deemed serious enough for the umpires to step in twice, however no formal complaints were made and Warner tweeted later in the day describing it as \"friendly banter\". Despite this, writers called into question his return to the Australia squad for the third Ashes test against England, which seemed likely after scoring 193 in the first innings of this match.[25] He was eventually forgiven and was recalled but caused huge hilarity when he 'hooked another one to Root' as he put it himself, as he was caught on the boundary by Root.\n\nList of centuries by David Warner[]\n\nTest centuries[]\n\nTest Match Centuries of David Warner # Runs Match Against City/Country Venue Date 1 123* 2 Template:Cr Hobart, Australia Bellerive Oval 12 December 2011 2 180 5 Template:Cr Perth, Australia WACA 14 January 2012 3 119 11 Template:Cr Adelaide, Australia Adelaide Oval 22 November 2012 4 124 1 Template:Cr Brisbane, Australia The Gabba 23 November 2013\n\nWarner's century at the WACA in 2012, scored in 69 deliveries, is the fastest Test century by an opening batsman, and equalled the innings of Shivnarine Chanderpaul as the fourth fastest Test century.\n\nODI centuries[]\n\nOne Day International Centuries of David Warner # Runs Match Against City/Country Venue Date 1 163 19 Template:Cr Brisbane, Australia The Gabba 4 March 2012[26] 2 100 20 Template:Cr Adelaide, Australia Adelaide Oval 6 March 2012[26]\n\nTwenty20 centuries[]\n\nTwenty20 Centuries of David Warner # Runs Balls 4s 6s For Against Venue Year 1 107* 69 9 5 Delhi Daredevils Kolkata Knight Riders Delhi 2010 2 135* 69 11 8 New South Wales Blues Chennai Super Kings Chennai 2011 3 123* 68 6 11 New South Wales Blues Royal Challengers Bangalore Bangalore 2011 4 102* 51 6 6 Sydney Thunder Melbourne Stars Melbourne 2011 5 109* 54 10 7 Delhi Daredevils Deccan Chargers Hyderabad 2012\n\nReferences[]\n\nTemplate:Australia Cricket Team Template:New South Wales Cricket Team Template:Delhi Daredevils Squad Template:Sydney Sixers current squad Template:Australia Squad 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Template:Australia Squad 2010 ICC World Twenty20 Template:Australia Squad 2012 ICC World Twenty20"
