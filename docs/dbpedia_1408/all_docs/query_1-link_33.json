        "text": "Today Mitchell Starc created history and served an ominous Ashes warning by taking two hat tricks in the same match in the Sheffield Shield match against Western Australia at Hurstville Oval.\n\nBy doing this, Starc became the first person since 1978/79 to take two hat tricks in the same first-class match. He is also the first person to do this in an Australian first-class match.\n\nHe is also the third Australian to do this, after Albert Trott for Middlesex in 1907 and Jimmy Matthews in a Test Match in England in 1912.\n\nThe players who have achieved this feat are:\n\nAlfred Shaw for Nottinghamshire against Gloucestershire at Nottingham in 1884.\n\nAlbert Trott for Middlesex against Somerset at Lord’s in 1907. Trott took four wickets in four balls in this match.\n\nJimmy Matthews for Australia against South Africa at Manchester in 1912.\n\nCharlie Parker for Gloucestershire against Middlesex at Bristol in 1924.\n\nRoly Jenkins for Worcestershire against Surrey at Worcester in 1949.\n\nJS Rao for Services against Northern Punjab at Amritsar in 1963/64. Rao took two separate hat tricks in this match.\n\nAmin Lakhani for Combined XI against Indians at Multan in 1978/79.\n\nMitchell Starc for New South Wales against Western Australia at Hurstville in 2017/18.\n\nFormer ACT and Weston Creek Molonglo Cricket Club all rounder Tom Rogers will make his first-class debut for Tasmania in the second round of the Sheffield Shield season starting tomorrow. Rogers comes in for Andrew Fekete who has withdrawn from the squad for the match with a foot injury and Rogers has been diverted from making his Futures League debut for Tasmania to making his first-class debut against Queensland at Bellerive Oval.\n\nTom Rogers will become the 31st player to make his first-class debut after playing for the ACT. The initial first-class player from the ACT to play first-class cricket was Fred Johnston who played for New South Wales while a teacher in Canberra. The last player to play first-class cricket from the ACT was Aaron Ayre who made his debut for Victoria in 2015/16.\n\nIn addition to the 31 players to play first-class cricket, Greg Rowell (New South Wales, Tasmania & Queensland), Jason Floros (Queenland), Daniel King (Oxford University) & Ashley Ross (South Australia) have played first-class cricket but only represented the ACT at Youth Representative level.\n\nHe will also be the fifth player from the Weston Creek Molonglo club to play first-class cricket. The others being Michael Bevan, Huntley Armstrong, Jack Smith, and John Rogers who is Tom’s brother. They will also become the first set of brothers to play first-class cricket after playing for the ACT.\n\nThe list of first-class cricketers from the ACT are below:\n\nPlayer ACT Debut First-Class Debut First-Class Teams FB Johnston 1945/46 1946/47 New South Wales JW O’Reilly 1952/53 1953/54 New South Wales ML Clews 1969/70 1976/77 New South Wales RP Done 1973/74 1978/79 New South Wales WS Andrews 1974/75 1982/83 Western Australia JK Pyke 1983/84 1985/86 South Australia PD Bowler 1981/82 1986/87 Tasmania, Leicestershire, Derbyshire, Somerset MG Bevan 1987/88 1989/90 South Australia, New South Wales, Australia, Yorkshire, Sussex, Leicestershire, Kent, Tasmania PS Gerrans 1978/79 1990 Oxford University, Combined Universities GH Armstrong 1987/88 1990/91 South Australia MT Haywood 1987/88 1991/92 New South Wales JJ Haynes 1993/94 1996 Lancashire MA Higgs 1993/94 1998/99 New South Wales, South Australia BJ Haddin 1995/96 1999/00 New South Wales, Australia MA Tournier 1990/91 2000 Combined Universities SJ Karppinen 1993/94 2000/01 Western Australia GT Cunningham 1998/99 2002/03 Tasmania JA Voros 1995/96 2004 Sussex JK Smith 2000/01 2004/05 South Australia DG Dawson 2000/01 2004/05 Tasmania, New South Wales DA McNees 2003/04 2004/05 Tasmania DC Pascoe 2000/01 2009 Oxford University JW Rogers 2005/06 2009/10 Tasmania, Western Australia WD Sheridan 2005/06 2009/10 Victoria RGL Carters 2008/09 2010/11 Victoria, New South Wales NM Lyon 2008/09 2010/11 South Australia, Australia, New South Wales JP Behrendorff 2008/09 2011/12 Western Australia TC Thornton 2007/08 2011/12 South Australia SP Miller 2009/10 2012/13 South Australia A Ayre 2010/11 2015/16 Victoria TS Rogers 2013/14 2017/18 Tasmania"
