Victoria most recently claimed the 2018 JLT One-Day Cup title and JLT Sheffield Shield title in front of home crowds at the CitiPower Centre, Junction Oval.\n\nVictoria’s rich history of success includes winning 36 women’s National titles – a competition that has since been replaced by the Women’s National Cricket League (WNCL). Victoria has won the WNCL title on two occasions (2002-03 and 2004-05) and 3 T20 titles (now replaced by the Women’s Big Bash League) in 2009-10, 2010-11 and 2011-12."
