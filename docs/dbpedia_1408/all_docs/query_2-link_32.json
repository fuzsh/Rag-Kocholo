        "text": "At Lords in 1926, Bert Oldfield was out to a beamer from Roy Kilner. One report said the ball was above head height, another said it was shoulder height. Oldfield swung wildly and was caught at fine leg. Kilner was a slow bowler and the ball was accidental.\n\n********\n\nI have embarked on a little project to record the (descriptive) fielding positions of catches in as many Tests as possible. This is only really possible thanks to the wide collection of scores and reports that I have accumulated over the years. So far I have done 1877 to 1928 and also 1957 to 1967. Also most Tests since 1999, using online records. Generally, about 98 per cent of catches can be located in this way; it is a remarkable thing that I can do most of this sitting in my own office/library. The newspaper reports, rather than the scores, are most useful for this purpose.\n\nI hope this will help with more insights into changes in the game.\n\nCertainly one could say a lot about the results, but one example will suffice. I noticed that 'gully' as a catching position was never recorded before 1924. The first mention in a Test was in England in 1924 where it was spelled \"gulley\" and inverted commas were used. By 1926 it was being used in Australian papers with the modern spelling and no inverted commas.\n\nSearching the digital Times database, there was an isolated use of \"gully\" in a report of a Gentlemen v Players match in 1910, again with the inverted commas being used. I didn't find anything similar in the Australian Trove from the time. I don't know the derivation of the term. Perhaps others can speculate.\n\nSo what terms were used instead? Sometimes the area was part of the slips, but I also find indications that 'point' and 'third man' were broader terms than today and, depending on the writer, extended to what we call the gully. It might help explain how WG Grace took so many catches at 'point', which doesn't attract so many chances today.\n\nOther little observations:\n\nPre-1915, references to 'cover' or the 'the covers' were rare, almost non-existent, but 'cover-point' was commonly used.\n\nI found a grand total of two catches at longstop, both of them in the 1878-79 Test.\n\n'Midwicket' had not come into common use by 1928. The area, even out to the boundary, was often referred to, rather confusingly, as \"short leg\". Other terms were used, although it is difficult to unravel.\n\n********\n\nI found another case of a team scoring 200 runs in a session. At the Oval in 1928 against the West Indies, on the second day England was 235 for 1 when rain interrupted play before lunch. Play re-started at 2:30 and went to 4:55 when England was all out for 438. The rather irregular session produced 203 runs in 145 minutes.\n\n********\n\n12 December 2016\n\nThe Fastest Bowlers in the Game: Big Data\n\nCricinfo stores quite a lot of bowling speed data in attachments to their scorecards. They dont list the speed of every ball, but they do give averages and peak speeds for every bowler in every innings, for about 90 per cent of recent Tests, taken from automated speed gun readings. While some Tests are missing, this does give allow us a reasonable comparison of bowlers.\n\nI have downloaded all the Test data since early 2014 and distilled it into averages. I dont know if anyone at Cricinfo has already done this, but it is the sort of thing they should do! The bowlers with the fastest average speeds, since early 2014, are\n\n# innings\n\nmph\n\nkph\n\nMitchell Starc\n\n27\n\n87.9\n\n141.5\n\nVarun Aaron\n\n10\n\n87.5\n\n140.8\n\nShannon Gabriel\n\n27\n\n87.4\n\n140.6\n\nMitchell Johnson\n\n24\n\n86.8\n\n139.7\n\nWahab Riaz\n\n21\n\n86.7\n\n139.5\n\nMorne Morkel\n\n17\n\n86.4\n\n139.1\n\nKagiso Rabada\n\n10\n\n86.2\n\n138.7\n\nMark Wood\n\n17\n\n85.7\n\n137.9\n\nUmesh Yadav\n\n24\n\n85.6\n\n137.7\n\nJerome Taylor\n\n27\n\n85.3\n\n137.2\n\nMohammed Shami\n\n25\n\n85.1\n\n136.9\n\nChris Jordan\n\n12\n\n84.9\n\n136.6\n\nNuwan Pradeep\n\n24\n\n84.8\n\n136.4\n\nDale Steyn\n\n11\n\n84.7\n\n136.3\n\nIshant Sharma\n\n32\n\n84.7\n\n136.2\n\nBen Stokes\n\n41\n\n84.6\n\n136.1\n\nSteven Finn\n\n24\n\n84.3\n\n135.6\n\nRahat Ali\n\n20\n\n84.2\n\n135.5\n\nChris Woakes\n\n20\n\n84.2\n\n135.5\n\nMohammad Amir\n\n11\n\n83.8\n\n134.8\n\nJosh Hazlewood\n\n35\n\n83.4\n\n134.2\n\nKemar Roach\n\n22\n\n83.2\n\n133.9\n\nDhammika Prasad\n\n18\n\n83.2\n\n133.8\n\nMinimum 10 innings. These are not precise averages because no allowance has been made for varying length of innings. Some bowlers are affected more than others by missing data, in Tests in Australia in particular.\n\nIt would probably be better to be able to calculate median rather than average speeds, as an indicator of typical speed, because fast bowlers who use the slower ball more often would have their averages depressed.

Even though Aaron is a very fast bowler, the 100 mph ball has to be dubious. The source is here. Note that Aaron bowled no balls faster than about 92 mph in that innings except for the one ball at 100. This is most likely a measurement error.\n\nNotice also the evident errors in Karn Sharmas figures in that innings. This is probably due to misidentification of the bowler. This happens fairly regularly in the data.\n\nAnother glitch evident in the above table is the ball supposedly bowled by Nathan Lyon at over 95 mph.\n\nI still think that the average data is useful, but the fastest recorded data should be treated with caution and scepticism. Even if only one ball in a thousand is a serious glitch, if you record hundreds of thousands of balls, eventually most of the most extreme records are likely to be glitches. The other trouble with speed guns is that there is no way of independently confirming a result after the event.\n\nIncidentally, the slowest bowler in the data is Shakib al Hasan at an average of 48.4 mph/ 77.9 kph.\n\nAlso incidentally, major league baseball currently has a pitcher, Aroldis Chapman, who can pitch at over 105 mph.\n\n********\n\nGreg Chappell Reality\n\nI happened to see one of Robert Crash Craddocks TV interviews in his fine Cricket Legends series, with Greg Chappell. The conversation turned to Chappells Test debut, where he made 108 runs at Perth, after coming in with Australia in trouble. Chappell repeated, with absolute conviction, the folklore that Ian Redpath offered to protect Chappell from the bowling of John Snow. There is a quote at the Cricket Country website:\n\nI came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 107 for five to join Redders, who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. The English left me largely untouched while zeroing in on Redders just about the toughest batsman to dislodge. They figured if they got him the tail would capitulate. John Snow put all his energy into trapping Redders down at his end and bombarding him. They picked the wrong bloke.\n\nI have no doubt that Chappell honestly remembers it this way, but the scorebook tells a different story. For a start, there had been two quick wickets, and not three, and one of those was a run out. When Chappell first came in, Redpath might well have said Ill take Snow, but the reality was that any protection was moot; Snow was taken off almost immediately, and in fact bowled just one over during Chappells first 80 minutes at the crease! That Snow over cost 10 runs and ended a good but unspectacular spell of eight overs, one for 30. In Chappells defence, he does say, in the Craddock interview, that his memory of the early part of the innings is a bit of a fog.\n\nIn those 80 minutes before lunch, Chappell actually faced 71 balls to Redpaths 56. Snow returned after lunch and had four overs, Redpath facing 18 balls to Chappells 14. However, Chappell faced 13 balls to Redpaths 11 in the first three of those overs, with no evidence of strike-farming.\n\nLater, Snow took the new ball. This time Redpath did get more of the strike, but by this time Chappell was on 47 and had been batting more than three hours. I doubt if there was any deliberate strike-shielding going on by then, because Greg hammered 37 runs from 35 balls with the new ball before Snow was replaced. Chappell went from 50 to 100 off 47 balls. The sixth-wicket partnership was eventually worth 219 off 434 balls.\n\nWe don't know what speed fast bowlers bowled in the old days, but occasionally there is a hint that they must have bowled at a reasonable clip. In the first Test of 1899, Ernest Jones hit the middle stump of CB Fry and the ball went to the boundary. However, a no ball had been called and so the call was four no balls. How often do you see a ball go to the boundary after hitting middle stump?\n\nI might add, while reading up on this Test, that WG Grace, on his last day in Test cricket took a great one-handed catch at point \"just clear of the grass\" to a shot from Hill that was \"hard, low and square\". It was said that Grace retired because the \"ground was getting too far away\", but it seems he still had the skill. He still has one of the highest ratios of catches per match of any non-keeper.\n\nIncidentally, there is no hint in the newspaper reports that Grace was playing in his last Test. I can't find any mention in The Times of Grace retiring or being dropped, apart from an announcement of the second Test team a few days prior and a comment that the changes were \"radical\": five changes were made.\n\nSome statistician colleagues related the following accounts of the end of Graces career.\n\nIt was not decided until just before the next Test. Fry and Grace were part of the selection committee. According to CB Fry's version, Fry arrived late for the selection committee meeting. As soon as he arrived, Grace asked him whether Archie MacLaren should be part of the team for the second Test. Fry replied in the affirmative.\n\nOnly a little later did Fry realise that Grace was asking him whether he (Grace) should be replaced by Maclaren.\n\nThe version I heard (can't remember where) was that Grace said to Stanley Jackson after the Trent Bridge match \"It's over - I shan't play again.\" Sounds like he made the decision at that point but chose not to announce it publicly (presumably trusting Jackson not to reveal it), and by asking that question he was effectively allowing Fry to confirm it.\n\nA book that I now just checked tells both stories and says that it appears that he was ready to play in the second Test before the Fry incident.\n\nGrace actually played for MCC and Ground versus the Australians in between the two Tests, and scored 50 and 7 and took 3 for 42.\n\nI think it is interesting that just before the second Test, after the teams were selected, it was announced that the hours of play would be extended by 30 minutes per day.\n\n********\n\nOn his Test debut in 1958, Conrad Hunte scored 50 out of the first 55 runs scored in the match. 142 not out overnight, Hunte was out to the first ball of the second day.\n\n********\n\nIn the England/South Africa Test at Lords in 1912, there was no play before lunch on the first day, but South Africa was bowled out for 58 before tea. Barnes and Foster took five wickets each, and were also responsible for all three catches.\n\nThere is only one other completed Tests innings where just two players were completely responsible for all the wickets, including catches. At Joburg in 1927, South Africa was bowled out for 196, with George Geary and Greville Stevens sharing the wickets, and the two catches were both taken by Geary.\n\n********\n\nPossibly the only (former) Test player to die while watching a Test match was former captain Bill Murdoch, who passed away while watching a Test at the MCG in February 1911. Murdoch, who was resident in England, was only visiting Melbourne at the time, and his body was embalmed and taken back to London where he was buried.\n\n********\n\n28 November 2016\n\nI am posting a few interesting images that I have come across, or have been sent. I will link to them rather than insert them here, for memory reasons.\n\nIn 1979, Cricketer magazine reported a bowler, Mike Walters, taking eight wickets in eight balls in an Army match. A picture of the scorebook was taken. I have heard claims of bowlers taking nine wickets in nine balls, but Walters effort does have the advantage of solid documentary evidence, and it was in an adult match. Childrens cricket records, such as the recent claims of a boy in India scoring a thousand on a tiny field, against opposition that basically didnt know how to play cricket, are best put in a separate category, and at worst, disregarded. I consider the real innings record outside of first-class cricket to be Charles Eadys 566 in Tasmania in 1902.\n\n***\n\nNot long ago I posted a wagon wheel for a Victor Trumper century. Here is another, for Trumpers 113 at the SCG in 1911-12. This is quite different in style to the earlier one, and is obviously the work of Bill Ferguson. As such, it is the earliest Fergie Wagon Wheel known. The report, which was in the Sydney Morning Herald on 18 Dec 1911 (three days after the event), also includes detailed information on balls faced, in unprecedented detail. Unfortunately, this level of reporting was rarely followed up.\n\n***\n\nBetween about 1895 and 1920, the size of some Australian grounds was reduced by the installation of a cycling track around the playing surface. It was in response to the sudden craze for cycling, and due to the fact that no dedicated cycling venues existed with large spectator capacity. Here is a picture of a novelty cycling race at the SCG in 1900, sent to me by Colin Clowes. Colin also noted adverse comments about the track at the time, such as\n\nNSW vs S.A. 18th-22nd February 1898.\n\nFor the most part, the tracks were not considered part of the cricket field. However, there was a strange exception. At Adelaide Oval in 1902, Clem Hill, on 98, was caught by a fielder on the cycling track. The dismissal was upheld even though the fielder was outside the normal field of play, and the shot would have been called six had it landed. Shots along the ground were called four on reaching the track, so if the shot had bounced, Hill would have reached his century. Apparently the captains had agreed before the game that such catches would count. The dismissal was part of Hills unique sequences of scores of 99, 98, and 97.\n\nThe tracks had an effect on scoring, and may have contributed to the Golden Age of cricket. Here is the ratio of boundary hits at the SCG: before, during, and after the cycling track\n\n% Runs as fours and sixes at SCG\n\npre-1896\n\n38%\n\n1897-1912\n\n48%\n\n1920-1937\n\n36%\n\n***\n\nPoor Norman ONeill. In 1958, at age 20, he makes one double century, and immediately he is hailed as the new Bradman on the front page of newspapers (in this case the Sun-Herald in Sydney, which I believe was Australias largest-selling newspaper at the time). It was an impossible standard to live up to, although ONeill did enjoy a fine career. Other players burdened with the next Bradman sobriquet, include Neil Harvey, Ian Craig and Doug Walters. The fashion eventually wore thin.\n\n********\n\nHere is an article I wrote, a review of the 2015-16 Australian season, which was published a little belatedly in Between Wickets. I have included an image of the first page of the article as published, since it includes an introduction that I swear I did not write.\n\n********\n\nIn a Test at Sharjah, Kraigg Brathwaite (142*, 60*) remained unbeaten through sixteen consecutive partnerships. This is the most by any player in a single Test, but was matched by Victor Trumper across two Tests in 1903-04. In Trumper's case all sixteen batting partners were dismissed, which is not the case for Brathwaite, although he has a chance to extend his run.\n\nWhen looking at this, I noticed that in 1903-04 Australia had 35 consecutive partnerships that involved either Trumper or Monty Noble (or both).\n\n********\n\nHighest first-class scores by a batsman who was involved in only one partnership. I have included opening stands but I think the other cases are more remarkable.\n\n324 Waheed Mirza, Karachi Whites v Quetta 1977 (partnership 561 for 1st wicket with Mansoor Akhtar)\n\n319 RR Rossouw, Eagles v Titans 2010 (480 for 2nd wicket with D Elgar)\n\n319 Gul Mohammad, Baroda v Holkar 1947 (577 for 4th wicket with V Hazare)\n\n313 H Sutcliffe, Yorkshire v Essex 1932 (555 for 1st wicket with P Holmes)\n\n300 DCS Compton, MCC v NE Transvaal 1948 (399 for 3rd wicket with RT Simpson)\n\n293 VT Trumper, Australians v Canterbury 1914 (433 for 8th wicket with A Sims)\n\n290 WN Carson, Auckland v Otago 1936 (445 in 268 mins for 3rd wicket with PE Whitelaw)\n\n289 Aamer Sajjad, WPDA v SSGC 2009 (580 for 2nd wicket with Rafatullah Mohmand\n\nAaron Finch scored 288* for Cricket Australia XI v New Zealanders 2015 in a farcical match that was abandoned after the first wicket fell.\n\n9 November 2016\n\nHead to Head Against the Best\n\nQuite a few years ago, on this very blog (which has been running for a disturbingly long time), I remarked that a head-to-head, batsmen v bowler, analysis would be quite interesting if we just looked at superior batsmen; that is, how do the top bowlers compare when they are bowling to the top batsmen, with averages over 45?\n\nBack then, I found that Glenn McGrath was well ahead of any of his contemporaries. Now I have much more data, and we can do some historical comparison.\n\nI simply calculated the head-to-head figures for all bowlers when they were bowling to batsmen whose career averages are over 45. Here is the table\n\nBowler\n\nR\n\nW\n\nAv\n\nGD McGrath\n\n2198\n\n88\n\n25.0\n\nCEL Ambrose\n\n1239\n\n49\n\n25.3\n\nWasim Akram\n\n1232\n\n40\n\n30.8\n\nSCJ Broad\n\n3176\n\n102\n\n31.1\n\nJA Snow\n\n1503\n\n47\n\n32.0\n\nDW Steyn\n\n2799\n\n86\n\n32.5\n\nFS Trueman\n\n2286\n\n70\n\n32.7\n\nSM Pollock\n\n2214\n\n66\n\n33.5\n\nAV Bedser\n\n2531\n\n75\n\n33.7\n\nShoaib Akhtar\n\n1423\n\n42\n\n33.9\n\nPM Siddle\n\n2349\n\n67\n\n35.1\n\nWW Hall\n\n1476\n\n41\n\n36.0\n\nImran Khan\n\n1544\n\n42\n\n36.8\n\nWJ O'Reilly\n\n1905\n\n51\n\n37.4\n\nRR Lindwall\n\n1573\n\n42\n\n37.5\n\nQualification: 40 dismissals of top-ranked batsmen, or 1500 runs (50 dismissals for current players).\n\nI should explain that entries in italics included some estimated data, because I dont have all Tests ball-by-ball. This is not as bad as it seems; in most cases where estimates are included, a large majority of the data for that bowler is known exactly, and the estimates form a minority component. There are no pre-1920 bowlers because almost no batsmen averaged over 45 in those days.\n\nReaders may make of this list what they will. Obviously pace bowlers are dominant, with Bill OReilly the top-ranked spinner. The truth is that wickets for almost all spinners are weighted towards the tail end, and even the best spinners were often hammered by the best batsmen. Brian Lara averaged over 100 against the combined bowling of Murali, Warne, Danish Kaneria and MacGill, but only 27 off McGrath.\n\nI suppose that pace bowlers have one advantage in that when top-order batsmen fail, it is sometimes before the spinners come on. I wouldnt think that this was an overwhelming factor though.\n\nThe figures do confirm my impression that Glenn McGrath was the most difficult bowler of the modern era. While Shane Warne was acclaimed the Bowler of the Century by Wisden, I am not even sure he was the best bowler in his team.\n\nWarne, incidentally, is 33rd of 81 bowlers on the list with an average of 45.3. I wont dwell on the bottom of the table except to say that John Emburey has the highest average of those that qualify, at 98.0.\n\nIt did occur to me that in different eras, bowlers will bowl to different sets of top batsmen. So I normalised the averages so that instead of treating all 45+ batsmen equally, bowlers were rewarded more for dismissing the very best batsmen. (A career batting average of 45 has no adjustment, 50 has some adjustment, while bowling to Bradman gets a big adjustment). The adjusted averages are below; not much different but some changes occur.\n\nBowl\n\nAdj Av\n\nGD McGrath\n\n22.6\n\nCEL Ambrose\n\n22.9\n\nSCJ Broad\n\n27.6\n\nWasim Akram\n\n28.4\n\nJA Snow\n\n28.7\n\nAV Bedser\n\n28.9\n\nDW Steyn\n\n29.4\n\nFS Trueman\n\n29.6\n\nSM Pollock\n\n29.8\n\nShoaib Akhtar\n\n31.0\n\nPM Siddle\n\n31.6\n\nRR Lindwall\n\n31.7\n\nWJ O'Reilly\n\n31.9\n\nH Verity\n\n32.0\n\nImran Khan\n\n33.2\n\nThis analysis lifts Alec Bedser and Hedley Verity, the reason being that they bowled to Bradman, and enjoy the greatest beneficial adjustment as a result. Verity had the best record of any bowler against Bradman, with eight dismissals and an average of 49.8.\n\n********\n\nHere's a nice little find that pleases me. I have a section in my records of bowlers who took five wickets in fewest balls, also the subject of a recent question in Ask Steven. The record is 12 balls by Kallis, or, if we ignore Bangladesh, 13 balls by Laker in THAT Test. There was one uncertain one that is a candidate: at Melbourne in 1901/02, Monty Noble took the last five wickets of his 7/17 very rapidly, but I was unable to get an exact number, in spite of checking numerous newspapers.\n\nAnyway, I have found an account in a newspaper called the Port Phillip Herald that settles the matter. Noble took wickets with the last two balls of his sixth over, another in his seventh, then two more in four balls to finish the innings. That is five wickets in twelve balls, a match for Kallis. The sequence was\n\nW, W, 0, 0, 2, W, 0, 0, 0, W, 4, W\n\n23 October 2016\n\nHeres a link to an article of mine that has been published on the Cricket Monthly website. I will also post it in my Longer Articles page I hope you like it as much as some of the people who posted comments. I certainly enjoyed reading them!\n\nhttp://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1056115/tracking-the-misses\n\nWhile I have it in mind, I will add the following note:\n\nThe overall average cost of dropped catches is similar to the overall batting average, at around 33 runs.\n\nI suppose one way to evaluate a keeper in a match is to tally the total number of chances he receives. Then calculate how many of these an average keeper would be expected to drop. Take the difference between this and the actual number of drops, multiply by 33, and you have a runs value for the keepers catching.\n\nSay that a keeper received 8 catching chances in a match, and catches 5. The average keeper would be expected to drop 15%; that is, 1.2 catches. Our keeper has dropped 3, so he has an excess of 1.8. At 33 runs per drop, our keeper has cost the team about 60 runs.\n\nBy the same calculation, a keeper who received 8 chances, and catches them all, has gained his team an advantage of about 40 runs.\n\nStumpings would be calculated separately. One might also do separate calculations for pace and spin bowling, since these have very different drop rates for keepers. This would require ball-by-ball records.\n\nOf course, you can add in other factors, such as the value of the batsmen dismissed. This can create difficulties, because there are many possible factors. When you use lots of factors, the final result becomes rather arbitrary, depending on the weight you place on each factor.\n\n********\n\nOne-Handed Batting\n\nWith the help of Sreeram and others, I have made a list of batsmen who have batted, in effect, with one hand, due a broken bone or other serious injury.\n\nLH Tennyson, Leeds 1921\n\nRT Simpson, Leeds 1953\n\nJT Murray, Sydney 1962-63\n\nMC Cowdrey, Lord's 1963 (did not face)\n\nMD Marshall, Edgbaston 1984\n\nVP Terry, Old Trafford 1984\n\nSalim Malik, Faisalabad 1986-87\n\nA Ranatunga, Rawalpindi 1999-00\n\nGC Smith, Sydney 2008-09\n\nWahab Riaz, Colombo PSS 2015\n\nUPDATE: J Srinath, Mumbai 2001 (2nd innings) (H/T Abhishek)\n\nTalat Ali, Adelaide 1972-73\n\nNick Knight batted one-handed in an ODI in 1997 (Auckland)\n\nInzamam-ul-Haq 1st Test Harare 1994-95\n\nThe extent to which Simpson was playing one-handed is uncertain. In the same series, there is a picture of Len Hutton hitting a one-handed shot at Lords. The puzzle here is that Hutton scored 145, and gave full rein to his shots according to The Times, which, although it mentions an injury (suffered while fielding), does not mention Hutton batting one-handed.\n\nMalik batted both left-handed and right-handed during his innings, perhaps the only batsman to do so in Tests. Cowdrey was prepared to do so, but did not face. Terry was probably the most seriously injured of these players; he is the only one on the list to bat with his arm in a sling, in what was his last Test innings.\n\n********\n\nThe fastest century makers. These are the batsmen with fastest average balls faced to 100. (First 100 runs mind you, not whole innings). With a minimum of 10 Test centuries, the Top Five are Gilchrist (107 balls), Warner (116), Sehwag (119), McCullum (122), and Pietersen (139). Jayasuriya and Botham are very close to Pietersen on 139.\n\nThey are followed by Dilshan (141), Gayle (143), Clive Lloyd (147), Viv Richards (148) and Lara (150)\n\nAt 5-9 centuries there is also Afridi (104), Kapil Dev (108), with Cairns and Prior on 125.\n\nWith no minimum, there is Gilbert Jessop, whose only century was reached in 76 balls.\n\n********\n\nThe most runs in a calendar year is 5200 by Martin Crowe in 1987 (first-class + List A). Jimmy Cook scored 14,167 runs in three consecutive years, 1989-1991. It might surprise people to learn that such players were playing more cricket 30 years ago than our supposedly 'overloaded' players do today.\n\nThe most in first-class alone is 4962 by Denis Compton in 1947. Compton scored 5476 runs between October 1946 and September 1947.\n\nIt will be difficult to exceed these totals because the effect of T20 cricket has been to depress the number of runs scored and wickets taken, not increase them. Last time I checked, the most runs in a year that included T20 games was 3788 by JA Rudolph in 2010, so Kohli may beat that.\n\nCharles Turner took 365 first-class wickets in calendar year 1888. I dont think this has been surpassed in f-c, or in combined formats.\n\n********\n\n1 October 2016\n\nThere is an update to the HOT 100 list, the fastest and slowest batsmen in Test cricket. I only update this annually now, since scoring speed is a relatively constant characteristic of batsmen, and less variable than batting average. The lists change only slowly, although David Warner has crept up a place into 5th. Brendon McCullum also moved up, just before his retirement, thanks in part to his extraordinary 145 off 79 balls at Christchurch.\n\n********\n\nI spent a little time last week in the National Library in Canberra copying some early ODI scores that they have (the Library obtained them from the MCC), including the original ODI in January 1971.\n\nThere was a curiosity with that 1971 score. The original team names were given as \"An Australian XI\" v \"M.C.C.\". These names had been crossed out and replaced with \"Australia\" and \"England\". Next to these changes is a scrawled note which is a little difficult to read\n\n\"(Title of match [revised, or request] by Sir Donald Bradman and Sir Cyril Hawker)\"\n\nThe match was scored by Geoffrey Saulez and R.W. Bright.\n\nThere certainly was some confusion at the time as to the category of the match, and it certainly indicates that the idea of a \"One Day International\" came later. Initial newspaper reports of the match did not know quite what to call it; the odd phrase \"knockout match\" was used. Wisden mostly ignored the match, giving it just a two-line potted score and no match report.\n\nOne-Day cricket was known in Australia at the time, having started in 1969-70. However, it might have been the first such game for some of the players.\n\nI had to look up who Sir Cyril Hawker was: he was President of the MCC at the time. Although he had played one f-c match, his main background was as a banker (Governor of the bank of England, in fact).\n\n********\n\nA Trumper Wagon Wheel\n\nI also found a wagon wheel of a major Trumper innings, his 166 in the final Test of 1907-08. I havent seen such a thing for a Trumper innings before.\n\nMost striking is the lack of runs through cover and around to third man. Trumper favoured the straight hit or scored on the leg side. I would think that what is called short leg includes longer hits to mid-wicket.\n\nXx\n\nxx\n\n17 September 2016\n\nFew cricket fans imagine that they could be successful at Test cricket, but there are millions of people out there who see themselves as better at selecting Test teams than the people who have the job. The cutting below shows that this has been the case for many generations. It is from a Test in 1901/02 and mentions the heavy fire that faced selectors who had named Reggie Duff and Warwick Armstrong in the Australian team.\n\nBut sometimes it is the selectors who get it right. Duff top-scored in both innings in what was his Test debut, while Armstrong scored 4* and 45*.\n\nI came across this while trying to nail down the number of balls bowled by Monty Noble in taking his last five wickets in the first innings in that Test. The record for fewest balls bowled is 12 by Jacques Kallis, although that was against Bangladesh; in a proper Test match it is 13 balls by Jim Laker. This was probably matched by Noble, but I am still unable to come up with an exact figure. It could be as low as 12, or as high as 14.\n\n********\n\nNo bowler spent more time bowling to the famed Three Ws than Jim Laker, whose encounters with the West Indies greats spanned almost a decade. The curious thing is that while Weekes and Worrell both tamed Lakers spin thoroughly, Walcott had nothing but trouble.\n\nBat\n\nBowl\n\nInns\n\nRuns\n\nWkt\n\nAvge\n\nR/100 b\n\nEdeC Weekes\n\nJC Laker\n\n15\n\n201\n\n2\n\n100.5\n\n53.5\n\nFMM Worrell\n\nJC Laker\n\n13\n\n218\n\n0\n\n218+\n\n32.3\n\nCL Walcott\n\nJC Laker\n\n19\n\n236\n\n11\n\n21.5\n\n44.3\n\nThe innings count is only those innings in which Laker actually bowled to the batsman. Laker at one stage dismissed Walcott in nine consecutive innings in which he bowled to him (there were one or two other innings in between where Walcott did not face Laker). This is the most for any head-to-head pair in the database.\n\n********\n\nMost international runs in a 365-day period. Dates are 365 days ending, not calendar years.

Garfield Sobers played in a Sheffield Shield match in Adelaide that ended on 13 Feb 1962, but also played in a Test in Trinidad starting on 16 Feb 1962. In between, he made a 55-hour flight on three airlines, covering 12,600 miles and arriving in the middle of the night of the first morning of the Test. Without the time difference, he would not have made it. The final drive to the cricket ground was an additional two hours.\n\nFrom Adelaide, the West Indies is one of the most distant places to travel to by air. That is true to this day.\n\nNowadays our overloaded players expect longer breaks than this between T20 games at the same ground.\n\nIn the two matches, Sobers scored a combined total 293 runs and took 15 wickets. The guy was unbelievable. In the Shield match, he scored 2 and 251, and took 3/51 and 6/72.\n\nEverton Weekes was once selected to play for West Indies (Kingston 1948), after he was previously told he had been dropped, but word got to him so late that he couldn't make it to the ground on time, and actually saw play in progress from the air as he flew in.\n\nhttp://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/25/25321.html\n\nhttp://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Arc /Scorecards/ /25328.html\n\n25 August 2016\n\nThe project to upload detailed scores of all Tests from the 1950s has been completed, and the database now covers all Tests from 1920 to early 1960. I hope to post more in the future, starting with pre-1920 Tests, but there is no schedule at the moment.\n\n********\n\nA couple of new discoveries\n\nI visited Headingley more than a decade ago, and went through all their scorebooks, and copied all the Test matches that I could find. Time was limited, and unfortunately I failed to fully copy the 1912 and 1965 Tests. I was unable to find the 1957 Test and the 1952 Test in the time available.\n\nA problem was that most of the Tests were in scorebooks other than the year in question. This was because the main county scorebook travelled with the Yorkshire team, and Yorkshire played away while Headingley Test matches were on. Most Test scores that I found were either in a Second XI book or in a First XI book for a different year. There was no telling where a Test score would turn up, so I had to leaf through every page of every book to find them.\n\nSince then, the scorebooks have been donated to the West Yorkshire Archive Service. After a bit of correspondence with them, they searched the books again and found all the missing material. Well done! They have supplied me with copies, and I have re-scored them into digital form. The 1952 and 1957 Tests have now been posted in my Online Database.\n\nAll Tests ever played at Headingley are now represented by scorebooks or ball-by-ball records, and have been re-scored. Going back to 1899, this is the longest and most complete record for any major Test match ground (although the 1902 match at Sheffield has unfortunately not been found). Lords goes back to 1921, and Sydney to 1910; in both cases earlier records exist, but there are gaps. Other major grounds have more recent gaps (Perth is complete, but only started in 1970).\n\nThe most recent Test in England that has no scorebook is now The Oval 1951 (v South Africa). The other post-War Tests in England that are missing are The Oval 1946 and 1949, and Trent Bridge 1947.\n\n********\n\nCulture Clash\n\nThis is a bit of a departure, but I thought I would post a newspaper article unearthed by John Kobylecky, concerning an extraordinary incident during the M.C.C. tour of Pakistan in 1955-56. This tour, perhaps unfortunately, is not regarded as an official Test tour, although the major matches were very much regarded as Tests in Pakistan itself. The attitude of the M.C.C. to these matches is a strange contrast to the Tests in India of 1951-52, which have official status, even though that M.C.C. team was also far from representative.\n\nIn any case, the article describes the mistreatment of one of the umpires, by English players including the captain, on the rest day of the 3rd Test in faraway Peshawar in January 1956. Although there was an attempt to excuse the behaviour as university-style ragging, it sounds awful. It best, gross cultural insensitivity, at worst, inexcusable assault.\n\nThe incident was reported in The Times, but only in brief outline. Some readers may already be aware of it, but I had not heard about it before, so it might be new to others.\n\nEXCERPTS FROM FRONT PAGE ARTICLE ON 28 FEBRUARY HEADED: UMPIRE BEG ACCEPTS APOLOGY (full article embraces 9 columns).\n\nUmpire Idris Beg has accepted apologies offered by the MCC manager, Mr. Geoffrey Howard, on behalf of all persons concerned in last nights incident. Umpire Idris Beg was last night forcibly taken away in a tonga by some members of the MCC party, including Donald Carr (captain) and Sutcliffe (vice-captain), to their hotel where water was poured on him. During Mr. Begs efforts to escape from the MCC cricketers, he had his shoulder sprained. Mr. Howard issued the following statement after conferring with Mr. Beg.\n\nI have offered Mr. Idris Beg my apologies on behalf of all persons concerned which he has accepted in the best possible spirit. He has told me that he regards the matter as closed, and joins me in the hope that friendly relations between cricketers of both the sides will be continued throughout the remainder of the series.\n\nAccording to Mr. Beg the MCC party gagged him and dragged him in the tonga and while he was in the room of one of the MCC cricketers he was also dealt blows. The MCC camp, however, denied this, and it was said that only water was poured on Mr. Beg as part of a ragging.\n\nAccording to our correspondents version in continuation of yesterdays story, the MCC captain Carr and vice-captain Sutcliffe allegedly kidnapped umpire Idris Beg from his hotel and beat him up, dislocating one of his arms. Just past ten last night, it is stated, an eight-man party including Carr, Sutcliffe, Close, Richardson, Swetman and Stevenson  all members of visiting team  and two others, arrived at the Services Hotel in search of Idris. He was there standing outside on the lawn talking to a friend when, accosted by the invading party, he unsuspectingly obliged only to be allegedly gagged and hustled into a tonga and whisked away to the tourists hotel.\n\nWith the gagged umpire in their custody, the MCC party and their two associates, described here as the official MCC scorer and an ex-British army officer, drove off to the Deans Hotel, where the visitors were staying. In room number 18 worse was in store for the unfortunate umpire, who had been the target of bitter British press comments. It is said once inside room number 18, Idris Beg was subjected to harsh handling. Whisky was, it is alleged, forced down his throat for the first time in this teetotallers life, water was thrown on his person, and he was given a thorough beating.\n\nMeanwhile, the news of the strange kidnapping spread like wildfire. Pakistans fast bowlers Khan Muhammad and Mahmood Husain dashed off to Idris Begs help and found the injured umpire lying on the veranda floor. He was picked up and brought back to his hotel. By now the entire Pakistan team, fast asleep after a historic days play, had been awakened, and at the dead of night, things began to happen. Pakistan captain Kardar and Cricket Control Board Secretary Cheema rushed to meet MCC Captain and Manager Geoffrey Howard. There was heated argument at this meeting, and it is believed the visitors captain Carr, offered to apologise, obliging by admitting that a mistake had been committed.\n\nA strange sort of press conference was summoned in the early hours of the morning at which no more than two correspondents were present  Crawford White of the London News Chronicle and Omar Quershi, Radio Pakistan commentator. The visitors captain is stated to have told the press conference he realised that they (the MCC stalwarts) had done something wrong which would lower the prestige of the game and bring upon them the wrath of every sportsman.\n\nA message from Karachi adds: Group Captain Cheema, Secretary of the Pakistan Cricket Board, who flew into Karachi from Peshawar this afternoon, had a meeting with the Governor-General, Major-General Iskander Mirza, President of the Board, about the manhandling of umpire Idris Beg by the touring MCC cricketers. Group Captain Cheema told the APP tonight:\n\nI have placed all the facts before the President along with the written apology of MCC skipper Donald Carr. Major-General Iskander Mirza would decide what is to be done about it\n\nThe Test Match, he said, would be played tomorrow, as scheduled. A message from London adds: No comment is being made by the MCC, London, until a full report of the incident involving Pakistani umpire Mr. Idris Beg and some MCC players has been received. Mr. S.C. Griffiths, Assistant Secretary of the MCC, confirmed today that a cable mentioning the matter had been sent to London by Mr. Geoffrey Howard, the MCC team Manager. The cable also stated that Mr. Howard was writing to the Lords.\n\nUntil we receive this letter said Mr. Griffiths, we can say nothing at all.\n\n11 August 2016\n\nIts been reported in many places, but Peter Nevill and Steve OKeefe, assisted by Josh Hazlewood, smashed all previous records for scorelessness, by stringing together 154 balls without a run in the Kandy Test. While plenty of teams have been in ultra-defensive situations like this before, this was a unique combination of circumstances. There were no specialist batsmen so no attempt to farm the strike. One batsman was injured and so no running was attempted. I think that if there had been a runner for OKeefe, occasional runs would have been taken, so it is all due in part to the strange rule that disallows use of runners.\n\nNevill faced 90 balls without scoring, just shy of the 95 by Bruce Mitchell in 1931. The number for Mitchell, unfortunately, is only an estimate; however, I would say that, at the low end, it is a fairly precise estimate, but the exact number is not known (could be a bit higher). It is quite unlikely that Mitchell faced 90 balls or less. However, Nevill batted 108 minutes without scoring, and that is without doubt the longest time without scoring in a Test innings.\n\nIn the next Test, at Galle, Nevill was out first ball in the first innings and scored off his second ball when he batted again. This gave him a total of 92 consecutive balls without scoring. So Tony Locks record of 115 balls across multiple innings remains safe. OKeefe, for his part, has an open-ended sequence of 76 balls without scoring to continue. Hope he gets the chance.\n\nThe Unusual Records entry has been updated.\n\n********\n\nHere are the fourth-innings scores at each fall of wicket, closest to the target, by teams losing the Test match.\n\nMost of these records were set in the original Ashes Test of 1882, but Manchester 1902 and a couple of others also turn up\n\n15/1 (70 runs: target 85) Eng v Aus, The Oval 1882\n\n68/2 (56 runs: target 124) Eng v Aus, Manchester 1902\n\n51/3 (34 runs: target 85) Eng v Aus, The Oval 1882\n\n53/4 (32 runs: target 85) Eng v Aus, The Oval 1882\n\n92/4 (32 runs: target 124) Eng v Aus, Manchester 1902\n\n66/5 (19 runs: target 85) Eng v Aus, The Oval 1882\n\n70/6 (15 runs: target 85) Eng v Aus, The Oval 1882\n\n70/7 (15 runs: target 85) Eng v Aus, The Oval 1882\n\n109/7 (15 runs: target 124) Eng v Aus, Manchester 1902\n\n75/8 (10 runs: target 85) Eng v Aus, The Oval 1882\n\n110/9 (7 runs: target 117) Aus v SAf, Sydney (SCG) 1993/94\n\n184/10 (2 runs: target 186) Aus v WI, Adelaide 1992/93\n\nThe Tied Test in Brisbane would beat some of these if you want to include it\n\n226/7 (7 runs: target 233) Aus v WI, Brisbane 1960/61\n\n228/8 (5 runs: target 233) Aus v WI, Brisbane 1960/61\n\n232/9 (1 run: target 233) Aus v WI, Brisbane 1960/61\n\n232/10 (1 run: target 233) Aus v WI, Brisbane 1960/61\n\n********\n\nI have been studying some old ODI scores, and have come up with some interesting material on Simon ODonnell, one of the more underrated ODI players.\n\nBowlers taking wickets in five consecutive overs in an ODI (where known)\n\nSP O'Donnell\n\nv New Zealand, Christchurch 1990\n\nWaqar Younis\n\nv England, Leeds 2001\n\nSB Styris\n\nv West indies, Port of Spain, 2002 (two spells)\n\nGD McGrath\n\nv Namibia, Potchefstroom, 2003\n\nAlso in 1990, ODonnell played an innings of 74 off 29 balls in an ODI at Sharjah against Sri Lanka. At the time, his 50 off 18 balls was an ODI record. The innings, as recorded on the scoresheet, makes unusual reading\n\n0,0,1,6,1,1,1,2,6,2,2,4,6,4,6,1,6,1,1,1,2,1,1,4,1,4,3,6,W\n\nODonnell actually scored his 74 runs in the space of 26 balls, without a dot ball. In that innings, runs were scored off the bat by the Australians for 43 consecutive balls, with the exception of the ball that took ODonnells wicket.\n\nOnly Sanath Jayasyuriya (76 off 28 in 1996, setting a new record with 50 off 17) and Brendon McCullum (using a super bat) have played higher innings off fewer balls than ODonnell.\n\nAgainst Zimbabwe in 2012, McCullum (119) scored off 30 consecutive balls faced, as did Ian Trott (112) against New Zealand in 2013. Neither scored as many runs as ODonnell without facing a dot ball, but Chris Gayle (215) equalled it with 74, scoring off 23 consecutive balls without a dot ball against Zimbabwe in last years World Cup. (For this analysis, sundries are considered dot balls.)\n\nODonnell, incidentally, hit the longest six ever accurately recorded at the MCG. It was in a Sheffield Shield match in 1993, off the bowling of Greg Matthews. The shot reached the third level (out of four) of the Great Southern Stand. The location has been marked by a yellow-coloured seat that can even be seen on Google Earth. The distance is equivalent to 122 metres (unimpeded).\n\n16 July 2016\n\nDropped Catches Report for 2015\n\nI have collated a list of dropped catches in Tests in 2015 (specifically, April 2015 to January 2016, between pauses for World Cup and World T20). This extends my analysis of Cricinfo ball-by-ball texts that started in 2001. For a number of Tests, I backed up the analysis by also checking the texts archived by Cricbuzz. In general, this confirmed the searches of Cricinfo, but a few other missed chances were found. It is also apparent that some dropped catches are a matter of opinion, with the sources coming to conflicting conclusions where technical or half chances are concerned; also whether or not balls carried or missed the bat. The disputed or uncertain cases might amount to about five to ten per cent of missed chances. As such, most chances are clear-cut, but the totals are a little fuzzy, and should be interpreted with that caveat.\n\nIn 45 Tests I found 281 missed chances (including stumpings but not run outs). Taking the successful catches and stumpings into account, the miss rate was 23.8%. Overall, there is a downward trend in this figure over the years, suggesting gradual improvement in catching. However, it is not quite as low as the 23.2% recorded in 2012.\n\nMore surprising is the improvement apparent compared to the rate of 27.2% in 2014. Some of the changes can be seen in this summary table\n\n% Missed Chances in Tests\n\nWhile the incidence of dropped catches appears to be falling, the high figure for 2014 remains a bit odd. Part of this is due to Bangladesh playing more Tests in that year: Bangladesh drops a lot of catches and bumps up the average, but even with them, the rate was still elevated. For reasons unknown, Australia dropped more chances in 2014 than in the previous or following years. I have checked the results with some care, but it seems to be a real result.\n\nThe team results for 2015 are as follows\n\nNew Zealand\n\n21%\n\nSri Lanka\n\n21%\n\nBangladesh\n\n22%\n\nAustralia\n\n22%\n\nSouth Africa\n\n23%\n\nIndia\n\n23%\n\nEngland\n\n25%\n\nWest Indies\n\n28%\n\nPakistan\n\n28%\n\nI would disregard Bangladesh in this list, because they played only five Tests and took only 25 catches during the year, a very small sample size. Bangladesh had a drop rate of 34% in the previous year. The most striking result is Sri Lanka, whose catching has improved enormously in the last few years, from 34% dropped in 2013 and 29% in 2014 to 21% last year. I have looked through the Sri Lanka results carefully, using both Cricinfo and Cricbuzz, and the result seems to be genuine.\n\nAdam Voges 269* at Hobart appears to have been chanceless. The highest score in 2015 by a batsman dropped was 290 Ross Taylor at Perth, dropped on 137. The most expensive drop of the year was 165 runs for Steve Smith at Lords, dropped on 50 and went on to make 215. The only batsman dropped on 0 who went on to make a century was Joe Root, dropped second ball in his ashes-critical 134 at Cardiff.\n\nZulfiqar Babar was the most unfortunate bowler in 2015, with 17 catches missed off his bowling. Azhar Ali dropped nine chances, mostly at the difficult short leg and silly point positions, five of them off Zulfiqar.\n\nThe dropped catches report for 2014 is here.\n\n*******\n\nNotes on the earliest international tours to use air transport\n\nThe 1945-46 Australian team flew to New Zealand: \"At dawn on 26 February 1946 the team flew from Sydney. The New Zealand Air Force provided a Catalina for the long flight across the Tasman Sea.\" They returned on the 8th of April, again with the NZ Air Force out of Auckland, but this time in a DC3.\n\nThe flight over took eight hours (Catalinas flew at less than 200kph), and the flight back on the (somewhat faster) DC3 was eventful, with the plane turning back to New Zealand after a short time due to an oil pressure problem, but completing the flight successfully later on the same day.\n\nThere is an odd aspect to this: regular commercial flights between Sydney and Auckland were available at the time, so why did the team fly on specially organised NZAF planes? At the time, an airline called T.E.A.L., the predecessor of Air New Zealand, had three flights a week on flying boats, and in fact had operated them even during the war.\n\nI wonder if it was at the insistence of the Australian Cricket Board, getting the New Zealanders to pay?\n\nThe day they got back also happened to be the day that flights from Australia to Britain via Singapore resumed, using civilian versions of wartime bombers (Liberators and Lancasters). These were the first civilian planes to use the Changi airport that had been built by PoWs. Earlier post-War flights had taken a route via Colombo, which required a very long trans-ocean leg.\n\nThe 1946 Indian team to England and the 1947/48 team to Australia both travelled by air. The latter had a rather long and harrowing flight, and decided that the return trip would be by sea.\n\nIn 1947/48, Len Hutton flew out to the West Indies as a replacement player for the MCC. It took him 3 days to get from London to Georgetown.\n\nInformation from the fascinating \"Test Cricket Tours\" website.\n\nAshru Mishra reports that a Lancashire team flew from Cardiff to Southampton in 1935, on a privately organised flight.\n\nThe last tour to travel by ship was the 1964 Ashes tour, although the sea leg was limited to Perth-Colombo. The team returned to Australia by air, playing Tests in Pakistan and India.\n\n(Thanks also to Ashru and Sreeram.)\n\n********\n\nHere is an article of mine that was published in Cricket Monthly, on the subject of the longest sixes:\n\nhttp://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/1026113/the-longest-shot\n\nand heres an interview I did for Cricket Country, which was actually a written Q&A rather than spoken interview.\n\nhttp://www.cricketcountry.com/articles/meet-charles-davis-who-found-those-4-runs-don-bradman-needed-464163\n\nIn both of the above, the headlines and photo captions were not written by me. Nor was the introductory blurb in the interview, which I do not necessarily agree with. The interviewer seemed to think that I had proved that Bradman had averaged 100, but I tried to hose that down in my comments.\n\n********\n\nHere are some figures for the highest percentage of a teams runs f-c cricket, based on batting position. Note that in practice many old scorecards do not really distinguish between #1 and #2 batsmen. (Scorers often write the names down before the ends are chosen.)\n\nAlso, there is some doubt about batting orders in many very old games. For example, G Beldam is given 31* out of 63 batting at #11 in 1800, but I doubt if he really batted in that position. I think that some very old scorecards list batsmen in the order they were out, not the order they came in.\n\nGiven the age of many of these records, the recent one by Glenn Maxwell is remarkable. He came to the crease at 9 (runs) for 6 (wickets) and scored 127 off 102 balls.\n\nPosition\n\n1\n\n83.4%\n\nGM Turner\n\n141* out of 169\n\nGlamorgan v Worcestershire, Swansea 1977\n\n2\n\n78.3%\n\nJ Noel\n\n18 out of 23\n\nVictoria v South Australia, Melbourne-EM 1882/83\n\n3\n\n71.5%\n\nFE Woolley\n\n103* out of 144\n\nKent v Warwickshire, Folkestone 1931\n\n4\n\n81.6%\n\nG Snyman\n\n230 out of 282\n\nKenya v Namibia, Sharjah 2007/08\n\n5\n\n78.0%\n\nHR Kingscote\n\n32 out of 41\n\nKent v Surrey, Sevenoaks 1828\n\n6\n\n78.8%\n\nS Nazir Ali\n\n52 out of 66\n\nYorkshire v Indians, Harrogate 1932\n\n7\n\n70.0%\n\nE Smith\n\n70 out of 100\n\nOxford University v Marylebone Cricket Club, Oxford 1891\n\n8\n\n68.3%\n\nGJ Maxwell\n\n127 out of 186\n\nNew South Wales v Victoria, Sydney 2013/14\n\n9\n\n63.6%\n\nBL Cairns\n\n110 out of 173\n\nWellington v Otago, Lower Hutt 1979/80\n\n10\n\n54.8%\n\nACS Pigott\n\n63 out of 115\n\nSussex v Nottinghamshire, Hove 1983\n\n11\n\n43.8%\n\nJW Martin\n\n14 out of 32\n\nHampshire v Kent, Southampton 1952\n\nThe highest for a #12 batsman is 13 out of 44 by TC Elliot for Hampshire v All England in 1848.\n\nNote also WG in 1876\n\n1 79.2% WG Grace 126 out of 159 United North of England v United South of England, Hull 1876\n\n1 July 2016\n\nHeres a list of the fastest batsmen to reach major Test milestones. Fastest in this context means fewest balls faced, not matches or innings or time. The Balls Faced in the table is the exact number when the milestone was reached, in mid-innings. For example, Southee passed one thousand runs during his 61st innings, and finished that innings with 1009 runs off 1180 balls. His one thousandth run came off his 1167th ball.\n\nRuns\n\nFastest\n\nBalls Faced\n\nInnings batted\n\n1,000\n\nTG Southee\n\n1167\n\n61\n\n2,000\n\nAC Gilchrist\n\n2482\n\n41\n\n3,000\n\nAC Gilchrist\n\n3609\n\n63\n\n4,000\n\nAC Gilchrist\n\n4896\n\n94\n\n5,000\n\nAC Gilchrist\n\n6098\n\n122\n\n6,000\n\nV Sehwag\n\n7566\n\n123\n\n7,000\n\nV Sehwag\n\n8589\n\n134\n\n8,000\n\nV Sehwag\n\n9753\n\n160\n\n9,000\n\nGC Smith\n\n15085\n\n195\n\n9,000\n\nBC Lara\n\n15095\n\n177\n\n10,000\n\nBC Lara\n\n16697\n\n195\n\n11,000\n\nBC Lara\n\n18252\n\n213\n\n12,000\n\nRT Ponting\n\n20175\n\n247\n\n13,000\n\nRT Ponting\n\n22020\n\n275\n\n14,000\n\nSR Tendulkar\n\n25811\n\n279\n\n15,000\n\nSR Tendulkar\n\n27830\n\n300\n\nThe leader in each category is quite clear cut, except at 9,000 runs, where Graeme Smith and Brian Lara are extremely close. Tendulkar, of course, is alone in the last two categories.\n\nAll these players are relatively recent. Although some data is missing for earlier players, none of them are contenders for a place in this table, so even with complete data this table would not change. Chances are though, that Gilbert Jessop (1899-1912) would be the faster than any modern batsman to 500 runs (about 450 balls), but Jessop never made it to 1000.\n\n********\n\nAfter a question on AskSteven, I became curious about the story that Bill Woodfull refused a knighthood offered to him for his contribution to cricket. Being of sceptical mind, I looked into it.\n\nThe earliest published source for this seems to be Chris Hartes History of Australian Cricket (1993, p357). Hart says the offer came on the occasion of Woodfulls farewell match in November 1934. Harte even quotes (after a fashion) from a citation. However, there is no reference offered and no direction to any primary source.\n\nThe story is also absent from all other older sources, including Pollards books, The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket and Robinsons much-admired On Top Down Under, which has a detailed chapter on Woodfull.\n\nStill sceptical, I borrowed a copy of a Woodfull biography by Alan Gregory, published recently (2011). However, Gregory does confirm the story, saying that he checked it with Woodfulls son and daughter, who had heard it from their mother.\n\nSo perhaps we should accept that at face value. Yet it is still a stretch. Gregory also reports that John Dew attempted (energetically) to get confirmation from both Buckingham Palace and Government House (Melbourne, the supposed source of the offer), but none was forthcoming. There are therefore still no documents or primary evidence.\n\nHaving done some family research in my time, I would certainly say that some stories that get circulated by word of mouth around families, and repeated decades later, are not necessarily true! (No disrespect intended). Others have a kernel of truth, but get exaggerated over the years. Casual chatter at an official function, perhaps?\n\nI still wonder about other factors. In 1934, no senior player, not even WG Grace, had ever been knighted for services to cricket; that fashion lay well into the future. There is another element to the story  that Woodfull responded that he would have instead accepted a knighthood for his teaching  and this also has an odd ring. He was just 37 at the time, he had spent a good part of his adult life playing cricket, and he was not a senior teacher yet; it also doesnt sound in character. Gregory mentions that no Australian teacher had ever received a knighthood at that time either; I think Woodfulls claimed statement sounds very unrealistic.\n\nGregory added that he had asked Harte about the citation, but Harte could not recall his source.\n\nRefusing a knighthood would have been a big deal in 1934, especially from Woodfull, who was a great admirer of the Crown, and referred to England in his speeches as the Mother Country.\n\nI also think the offer would have been unlikely politically, coming so soon after Bodyline.\n\nWoodfull did have an outstanding teaching career after 1934, and did accept an OBE, for his contribution to teaching, in 1963, after his retirement. He died, on a golf course, in 1965.\n\n********\n\n12 May 2016\n\nHow Effective is the (Second) New Ball?\n\nHere are some statistics from the database concerning the effectiveness of the new ball in Tests. The data covers about 280 Tests from 2007 to 2015.\n\nThere were 472 innings where the new ball was available. In only 44 was it not taken at all, whereas it was taken in the first five overs (overs 81-85) on 336 occasions. The longest innings without a new ball was 145 overs by West Indies against Australia (439/5) at Bridgetown in 2008; the latest taking of a new ball was 146.1 overs by India at Durban in 2013. There were only 25 cases of no new ball by the 100 over mark.\n\nIn innings that lasted at least six overs after the new ball, I compared the number of wickets in the six overs after with the number in the six overs before. There were 405 such innings. I also looked at windows of plus or minus four overs and two overs.\n\nWindow\n\nWkts before New Ball\n\nWkts after\n\nRatio\n\n± 36 balls\n\n96\n\n261\n\n2.72\n\n± 24 balls\n\n54\n\n177\n\n3.28\n\n± 12 balls\n\n24\n\n93\n\n3.88\n\nA Ratio of more than one indicates a benefit to taking the new ball. In the six overs before the new ball, there were wickets in only 87 innings, against 195 innings after the new ball. Overall, there were 2.72 times as many wickets in the six overs after the new ball than in the previous six overs, with even greater benefits with narrower windows.\n\nThese numbers suggest that early taking of the new ball is very beneficial, but it would be unwise to read too much into this. The taking of the new ball is not a random event: captains usually choose to do so when wickets are not falling, and they sometimes use part-time bowlers in the overs just before the new ball.\n\nIndeed if you look at the minority of innings where wicket(s) fell in the six overs before a new ball was actually taken (87 cases) the number of wickets falling in the six overs after the new ball is rather reduced  only 63 wickets. In these cases where bowlers are already taking wickets, the new ball has had no beneficial effect.\n\nI also looked at overs numbered 81-86 in all innings of sufficient length, and compared those with the new ball to those without. There were 347 innings with a new ball and 125 without (many of which took the new ball later on). In those without a new ball, the average was 0.68 wickets falling in the six overs, but in innings with a new ball it was only 0.67 wickets. This suggests no benefit to the new ball at all! However, it is not quite so simple, since a significant number of new balls are taken late in the 81-86 over window. If you restrict the comparison to those innings where the new ball was taken in the 81st over (218 innings), then the return rises to 0.78 wickets in six overs. There is some benefit evident here, but not as much as might be expected.\n\nOverall, I would say that captains do a competent job in choosing when to use the new ball. Mostly. However, the effects of the new ball are sometimes exaggerated, because captains are likely to call for it during a spell without wickets, and particularly by the choice of second-string bowlers just before it becomes available.\n\n********\n\nHighest averages in a calendar year (Tests beginning in the year in question)\n\nDG Bradman 1932 402.0 (3 inns)\n\nJN Gillespie 2006 231.0 (3)\n\nCP Mead 1921 229.0 (2)\n\nH Sutcliffe 1931 226.0 (2)\n\nMS Sinclair 1999 214.0 (1)\n\nDG Bradman 1946 210.5 (2)\n\nBradman also made a score of 167 in a Test in 1932, but the Test began in 1931. If the 167 is included in 1932, his average becomes 284.5.\n\nAdd this one to the list of unlikely achievements of Jason Gillespie.\n\nSreeram points out that since Sinclair played only one innings in 1999, that being his 214 on debut, he holds the record for highest average by any batsman in the 20th Century.\n\n********\n\nAdditions to the 1950s database will be suspended shortly. Holidays beckon.\n\n3 March 2016\n\nBowlers taking last two available wickets in consecutive balls in a Test match; thus deprived of a chance for a hat-trick\n\nWasim Akram\n\n5 times\n\nSK Warne\n\n3\n\nLO Fleetwood-Smith\n\n2\n\nCA Walsh\n\n2\n\nMore than 50 other bowlers have done it once.\n\nAs far as I can tell, none of these bowlers took a wicket with his first ball of the next match, thus claiming a non-hat-trick, except for the special case of George Lohmann in 1895/96, who finished the first Test with a hat-trick, then took a wicket with his first ball of the second Tests, thus taking four in four.\n\nSo it appears that these non-hat-tricks are extremely rare. Hardik Pandya of India recorded one in the past week, playing T20s against Pakistan and then Sri Lanka. Apart from Lohmann, there are no other similar cases at all in my database of Tests, ODIs and T20i. This data is, of course, not complete, but with about 75% of matches available (almost five thousand matches), it gives an idea of how rare this must be.\n\nWhen you think about it statistically, it is not surprising that hat-tricks or non-hat-tricks across multiple innings are rare. Within one innings, there could be hundreds of sets of three balls where hat-tricks are possible for each bowler, but across two innings, there are only two such sets. The final wicket(s) of such hat-tricks will also probably have to be a top-order or well-set batsman. It is a remarkable thing that two multi-innings hat-tricks occurred in the 1988/89 Test series in Australia: Merv Hughes and Courtney Walsh. Jermaine Lawson also had a two-innings hat-trick, in 2003.\n\nWaqar Younis took three wickets in four balls across two Tests against West Indies and Sri Lanka in 2002. In Ashes Tests, Jason Gillespie took five wickets in seven balls across two Tests against England that were 2 years apart, starting at Perth in 1998/99. He was dropped from the team between the two Tests, but also played against other countries during those two years.\n\n******\n\nHere is some complete data placing Adam Voges record-breaking sequence of runs without dismissal in context.

It shows Lawrence Rowe being caught by Ian Chappell off Jeff Thomson at the MCG on Boxing Day 1975. Those familiar with Australian cricket photography will not be surprised to learn that it was taken by Patrick Eagar.\n\nThe occasion was the morning of one of the first Boxing Day Tests. Some 85,000 people were present, and in those days the MCG stands were physically smaller than now. Such was the crush of spectators that large numbers were sitting even right behind the sight screen.\n\nAs you can see, the photo is on the cover of a Bill Frindall book of scores from that time. While it is not a rare book, it is by no means common and so I hope that no one concerned will mind the reproduction. Unfortunately, my copy is worn by use, and so I have photoshopped out some scratches and abrasions.\n\nWhy do I like it? Unlike most cricket photography, it presents a dramatic moment in a Test match much as a spectator experiences it, with a wider field of view than normally seen. Many modern telephoto shots, usually taken from the boundary at ground level, are so extreme that they sometimes struggle to get even the batsmans face and bat into the same frame.\n\nI like the elevated viewpoint and the composition. The participants are placed neatly, and all eyes are on the ball, directing the viewers attention to the main action. The power of Thomson is suggested by his position, still in mid-air even though the ball has reached the slip fielder. The catchers position is also dynamic, and shows perfect technique. The packed crowd looming at the top of frame increases the sense of drama.\n\nI also really like the lack of intrusive advertising (although I will admit to photoshopping out one small ad).\n\nI did not go to that match, but I did see, with my brother, the equivalent day in the Sydney Test. Even though we got into the ground more than an hour before the start, there were no seats left in the stands (tickets were not numbered or pre-sold) so we sat on the steps of the Sheridan stand, among 53,000 people; the SCG would never see such a crowd again. Jeff Thomson retired hurt three different batsmen that day; for atmosphere and drama, I have not been to a days cricket since that quite matched it.\n\nI believe that only fragments of video of these Tests have survived.\n\n********\n\nAn article on the most extreme Test performances of the last 50 years, combining batting and bowling performances on the same scale. This is an extended version of an article written for Cricket Monthly online. It should be stressed that my list is most extreme, in a statistical sense, rather than greatest.\n\n********\n\nSome notes on the question: in 1975, did Denis Amiss break the ODI record score before Glenn Turner?\n\nOn 7 June 1975 the ODI record stood at 116 (David Lloyd in 1974). That day, Amiss scored 137 and Glenn Turner 171*. Both opened the batting in World Cup matches, with simultaneous starting times, one at Lord's the other at Edgbaston.\n\nAt lunch (1pm), Amiss was 98 in 35 overs and Turner 82 in 40 overs. Amiss reached 100 off 112 balls. None of the reports available say exactly what happened next, but it is very probable that Amiss would have reached 116 first. The partnership between Amiss and Fletcher was very fast in the latter stages and would have reached a crescendo going from 150 to 230 after lunch. Turner, however, also scored extremely quickly after lunch.\n\nLess certain is whether Amiss still held the record when he was out. Again there are no exact figures, but Amiss was out in the 51st over, while I calculate from the later falls of wicket that Turner was about 142 in 54 overs. However, the over rate was higher in Turner's case, so his 54 overs may well have preceded Amiss' 51 overs. Minutes batted data would be useful here but is lacking.\n\nAmiss, who had scored the first two ODI centuries in 1972 and 1973, before ceding the record to Lloyd, had probably retaken the record, but for less than half an hour, and perhaps only for the time equivalent of five or six overs.\n\n********\n\nAustralia has selected a touring team to New Zealand with all six states represented.

(Yet these matches can be some of the best ODIs to watch). In the last few years the unusual has become decidedly rare. It is another sign of the increasing dominance of bat over ball that is distorting the game. Here is historical incidence of teams bowled out batting first which then went on to win. Games involving Test-ranked teams only. Duckworth/Lewis results excluded.\n\nWinning team all out\n\nMatches\n\n1980s\n\n23\n\n516\n\n4.5%\n\n1990s\n\n57\n\n933\n\n6.1%\n\n2000-04\n\n28\n\n671\n\n4.2%\n\n2005-09\n\n27\n\n734\n\n3.7%\n\n2010-13\n\n29\n\n514\n\n5.6%\n\n2014-16\n\n5\n\n270\n\n1.9%\n\nWhile there were fluctuations in the past, the most recent results show a sudden and significant fall-off.\n\n********\n\nSome questions from Ask Steven:\n\nIn the 2nd ODI between NZL and SL, Sri Lanka spinner Jeffry Vandersay conceded 26 runs in his debut over. (3 sixes and 2 fours).\n\nNo one has else has conceded 26 or more runs in an over on debut or during the first ODI in which they bowled. Matthew Hayden conceded 18 runs in his only over in ODIs, and I can't find anyone else since then who has conceded more in their first over.\n\n********\n\nDean Elgar and Stiaan Van Zyl were the last two South African bowlers when England was bowled out in the 2nd innings of the 1st test and then they opened the innings for Proteas. Is it a unique event in test cricket when both the opening bowlers were the last two bowlers to finish opponents innings?\n\nIt's quite rare, when circumstances are exactly as described. At Chittagong in 2009, Imrul Kayes and Tamim Iqbal bowled the last two overs of an innings against Sri Lanka, and then opened the batting immediately afterwards. However they did not bowl the opposition out; there was a declaration. There are one or two similar cases in the last 20 years, where an innings ended in a declaration. There are one or two other occasions where a pair of opening batsmen bowled the last two overs of an innings, but these were last two overs of a drawn match.\n\nAt Rawalpindi in 1994, Taylor and Slater bowled the last two overs in Pakistan's second innings and then opened. In this case, Pakistan was bowled out. I can't find any other cases in the last 30 years and 1200 Test matches.\n\nSlater, who took the last wicket in that innings, bowled only 4.1 overs in his whole Test career.\n\nhttp://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/59/59528.html\n\n********\n\nLongest wait to complete an over in a Test: A couple of extreme cases were very recent. Against Bangladesh last year, Dale Steyn waited 4 days to finish an over. However, he never did finish it as the match was washed out. For bowlers who did eventually complete their over, Josh Hazlewood waited three days in the Sydney Test just a couple of weeks ago. Hazlewood's over was interrupted at about 1:40 pm, so he had to wait about 2 hours short of a full three days. Chris Martin also waited until the third day at Johannesburg in 2000, but his over was interrupted at 6:26 pm and restarted at 10:45.\n\nTony MacGibbon waited 4 days, including a rest day, at Dunedin in 1955, but when play restarted, England declared, so he didn't complete the over.\n\n********\n\nReaching 100 and 200 in the same session\n\nCA Roach WI v Eng, Georgetown, Guyana 1930\n\nDG BradmanAus v Ind, Adelaide Oval 1947/48\n\nDCS ComptonEng v Pak, Nottingham (Trent Bridge) 1954\n\nNJ Astle NZ v Eng, Christchurch 2001/02\n\nMS DhoniInd v Aus, Chennai (Chepauk) 2012/13\n\nBA Stokes SAf v Eng, Cape Town 2015/16\n\n18 December, 2015\n\nRe-writing some Slow-Moving Records\n\nMost of the records for slowest scoring Tests date from many years ago, with few recent additions. It seemed to be getting less and less likely that such records would be much added to, what with the modern game dominated by flat-track bullies using super bats on shrunken grounds.\n\nBut then the South Africans came along with an innings of 143 in 143.1 overs at the Delhi FSK ground. The only real parallel was Indias 187 off 185 overs at Bridgetown in 1962. The details of the South African innings challenge and sometimes even surpass anything from olden times. Hashim Amlas 25 off 244 balls (10.25 R/100 b) and AB de Villiers 43 off 297 (14.48 R/100b) rival anything from earlier times.\n\nHere are some other slow innings in the same range, not on Cricinfo:\n\n8.97Hanif Mohammad (20 off 223 balls) Lord's 1954\n\n11.76 HL Collins (40 off 340) The Oval 1921\n\n12.36 WH Scotton (34 off 275) The Oval 1886.\n\nBizarre to think that de Villiers started off the year by hitting a century off 31 balls in an ODI, more than twenty times faster than his Delhi marathon.\n\n********\n\nFewest runs by individuals in a complete session (minimum two hours, 24 overs)\n\n4 (90 balls) MD Crowe (19*), Colombo 1983 Day 5, Session 2\n\n5 (78 balls) Arshad Khan (9*), Colombo 2000, Day 3, Session 2\n\n6 (113 balls) HM Amla (25), Delhi 2015, Day 4, Session 2\n\n7 (124 balls) AC Bannerman (41), Melbourne 1892, Day 3, Session 2*\n\n8 (~135 balls) B Mitchell (58), Brisbane 1931, Day 5\n\n8 (93 balls) MC Cowdrey (27), Lords 1956, Day 4, Session 3\n\n8 CPS Chauhan (79), Kanpur 1979, Day 1, Session 1\n\n8 (99 balls) RC Russell (29*), Johannesburg 1995, Day 5, Session 2\n\n8 (49 balls) GA Gooch (84), The Oval 1988, Day 3, Session 1\n\n*possibly less than 2 hours, but about 45 overs were bowled.\n\nTE Bailey scored 8 in 121 minutes (135 balls) after lunch on Day 5, Leeds 1955.

He was out before the end of the session.\n\nDanny Morrison scored 7 runs off 68 balls in a session of about 2 hours but only 21 overs at Faisalabad 1990/91.\n\nThe Chauhan case is certainly an odd and unexpected one in that the batsman finished with 79 off 162 balls, but his eight runs is the least in a complete opening session of a Test. Gooch was an extreme case of sustained strike deprivation, combined with a slow over rate; only 24 overs were bowled in the session.\n\nChris Tavare scored 18 runs in two sessions (9+9) at Chennai in 1982.

Putting this together was occasioned by the discovery of the Turner innings, which included a stretch of 58 balls on a score of 6; the Auckland 1968/69 Test scoresheets were among a recent find from a recent research trip to New Zealand. Some of the other figures are uncertain, due to imprecise placement of byes and leg byes in the originals. The Moses figure is from an over-by-over analysis only.\n\nThe innings by the dashing Compton is a surprise.\n\nHashim Amlas recent effort fell short of this list, reaching 10 off 122 balls.\n\n********\n\nI have added two new record categories to the Unusual Records files: slowest teams to reach 50 and 100. In the latter, the Delhi marathon beats all comers, with previous records being clustered around the funereal period of the fifties and early sixties.\n\nThis is a difficult area to nail down definitively, because many extreme cases tend to come from an era that is poorly represented by detailed data. However, I have done as much checking as possible, and I think there would be few cases that escape notice completely. Estimates of some sort are possible in most cases where scorebooks or other exact data are not available. Here is a part of the tables\n\n********\n\nBatsmen out twice in shortest space of time\n\nMins\n\nBalls\n\nPW Sherwell\n\n11\n\n23\n\nSAf v Aus, Sydney (SCG) 1910/11\n\nFM Engineer\n\n21\n\n?\n\nInd v NZ, Mumbai (Brabourne) 1964/65\n\nTM Dowlin\n\n25\n\n37\n\nWI v Aus, Brisbane ('Gabba') 2009/10\n\nDM Bravo\n\n26\n\n36\n\nWI v Aus, Hobart 2015/16\n\nJ Iddon\n\n28\n\n51\n\nEng v WI, Kingston, Jamaica 1935\n\nRF Surti\n\n30\n\n47\n\nInd v Eng, Leeds (Headingley) 1967\n\nVT Trumper\n\n34\n\n64\n\nAus v Eng, Birmingham (Edgbaston) 1902\n\nBalls estimated for Engineer: 30-35. Times do not include change of innings or breaks in play. Dowlin and Surtis dismissals were in different sessions; Iddons and Trumpers were on different days, almost 24 hours later in Trumpers case, in a heavily rain-affected match.\n\nThere are perhaps 50 or more cases of a batsman being out twice in the same session. However, with over rates slowing down in recent decades, it has become quite uncommon. Before Bravo, the last case was Salman Butt at Lords in 2010.\n\nApart from Sherwell above, I know of only one case of two consecutive wickets falling in a Test, with the same batsman dismissed both times: that was Willie Watson at Adelaide in 1958/59. In Bravos case at Hobart, there was just one intervening wicket.\n\n16 October 2015\n\nI have updated the Hot 100 list, the fastest-scoring and slowest-scoring batsmen in Test cricket. I do this about once a year. It is a characteristic of most batsmen that their scoring rates change from year to year much less than their batting averages, so there has been only slow change in the rankings. The notable movers are Brendon McCullum, up eight places after a stellar year, and Shakib al Hasan of Bangladesh.\n\nSteve Smith (#59) and Mohammad Hafeez (#55) are also making strong moves, Smith rising more than 20 places.\n\n[Note that, due to a subtle error, Chris Gayle and a couple of others were left off last years list.]\n\n********\n\nThe list of batsmen reaching an ODI century off the last possible ball has been updated (19 August 2015). At Kanpur, AB de Villers became only the fifth confirmed case of achieving this with a six: Mohammad Yousuf (twice), Kevin Pietersen and Mahela Jayawardene Craig McMillan being the others.\n\nUPDATE UPDATE. Rajneesh Gupta adds the following:\n\n-Allan Lamb also reached his hundred off the last ball of innings (Eng v Aus, Nottingham, 1989) in a 55 over game.\n\n-Javed Miandad did so in a 43-over game (Pak v WI, Georgetown, 1988)\n\n-One more ball was bowled in Zimbabwean innings after Sikandar Raza reached his hundred off a no-ball. Raza lost the strike while taking the single to complete his hundred.\n\n-Ramiz Raja was out obstructing the field on 99 while going for the second run (which would have taken him to his 100) in a 44-over game (Pak v Eng, Karachi, 1987).\n\n********\n\nI wrote some time ago that the first batsman to hit sixes off consecutive balls was Warwick Armstrong at the MCG in 1908. There is, however, an earlier example. JJ Lyons, at the Oval in 1893, hit five consecutive balls faced for four (two off Briggs and three off Lockwood. He was out next ball). The last two hits, although they only counted four at the time, cleared the boundary and would be regarded as sixes today. The first of these hits he drove straight to the roof of the pavilion, the ball bounding over. That was one mighty hit, perhaps exceeding 115 metres.\n\n********\n\nRunner run out in Tests, where known (Batsman given out named, runner in brackets)\n\nNJ Contractor (Borde) 1958\n\nWazir Mohammad (Mathias)1959\n\nJHB Waite (unk) 1965\n\nEW Freeman (Sheahan) 1970\n\nCJ McDermott (M Waugh) 1995\n\nSR Waugh (Blewett) 1998\n\nSteve Waugh was run out only four times in Tests, and it turns out that one of those involved his runner.

Macleod was nearly deaf, and his run out has to be described as just not cricket, old chap.\n\n********\n\nIn his 245 in the Test at Abu Dhabi, Shoaib Malik made scoring shots for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. I have records of about 60 other cases, but there are probably a couple of dozen others not recorded. The smallest score to include all these shots is 39 by EA Brandes for Zimbabwe at Auckland in 1996. No one has added a 7 to the complete set, although Andrew Sandham scored both a five and a seven in his 325 in 1930. However, he hit no sixes.\n\nIt even happens sometimes for one batsman off one particular bowler. At the Gabba in 2000, Brett Lee (62*) scored 22 runs off Marlon Black, including one six, one five, one four, one three, one two and two singles (plus 18 dot balls).\n\n10 September 2015\n\nHere is some further data on the subject of the follow-on. I also looked at this subject on\n\n17 February 2014 . It occurred to me that a primary factor behind the success of follow-on decisions by captains might be the amount of time left in the match, rather than the runs lead.\n\nSo I looked at the outcomes of matches where a follow-on was available, in terms of the stage of the match where the follow-on decision was made. The data in the table covers matches since 1995; Tests involving Bangladesh or Zimbabwe, which have inevitable results, have been excluded.\n\nWin % in follow-on situations, according to session of play\n\nDay\n\nSession\n\nFO: Times Enforced\n\nEnforced Win %\n\nFO: Not Enforced\n\nNot Enforced Win %\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n100%\n\n2\n\n100%\n\n2\n\n3\n\n5\n\n100%\n\n3\n\n100%\n\n3\n\n1\n\n10\n\n90%\n\n5\n\n100%\n\n3\n\n2\n\n9\n\n78%\n\n11\n\n100%\n\n3\n\n3\n\n23\n\n70%\n\n17\n\n82%\n\n4\n\n1\n\n8\n\n75%\n\n2\n\n50%\n\n4\n\n2\n\n5\n\n60%\n\n2\n\n0%\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n50%\n\n1\n\n0%\n\nNot surprisingly, the more time is available, the higher the likelihood of winning the match. Leading by over 200 with more than 3 days to play just about guarantees a win, regardless of the decision. However, there are some interesting differences in the outcomes on the third and fourth days.\n\nEnforcing the follow-on: with each successive session, from the beginning of the third day, the Win % declines. The decline is gradual, and enforcing the follow-on on the fourth day still has good positive outcomes.\n\nNot enforcing the follow-on: there are excellent outcomes on the third day, but the success rate plummets on day four.\n\nBottom line: do not enforce when time is available on the third day, but enforce the follow-on when time is short (day four). Given that follow-on situations arise more frequently on the third day, it is better in general NOT to enforce the follow-on.\n\nTeams not enforcing have a 100% record if the decision comes up before tea on the third day. This is quite remarkable when you think about it; at the very least you would expect the occasional such Test to be washed out, but no trailing team in the last 20 years has managed to recover from this, if asked to bowl again.\n\nThere is some surprise in this data, in that it runs counter to the observation that it is easier to win a Test by wickets than runs if time is an issue, because you only need to score one extra run for a wickets win. The tiring of a bowling attack when the follow-on is enforced seems to be a very important factor.\n\n********\n\nShane Watson has retired from Tests after a successful if oddly unsatisfying career. One aspect of his play that has received negative comment are claims that Watson overused the DRS system, and asked for too many improbable reviews of LBW decisions. This is something that can be checked with stats.\n\nThere have now been more than 150 Tests that used the DRS system. In those Tests, on-field umpires have made 781 lbw decisions (initially) against batsmen. Batsmen have challenged those lbw decisions a remarkable 459 times, 59% of the time. For top order batsmen, the percentage is even higher, about 65%.\n\nDecisions were overturned in the batsmans favour 126 times, representing 27.5% of the reviews (about 29% for top-order batsmen).\n\nSo how does Watson compare to other batsmen? He was given out lbw (initially, on-field) 15 times, which places him third after Alistair Cook (19) and Brendon McCullum (16). Watson challenged eleven of those decisions, so his percentage of 73% is indeed higher than the typical top order batsman. In two out of the eleven challenges, the decision was overturned, or 18%, which is rather lower than the 29% of other similar batsmen. The sample size getting quite small here, so dont read too much into those last figures.\n\nNevertheless, this is evidence that Watson did overuse the system, but not radically so. I would say that the data does not strongly support the complaint, given that half of all batsmen will, by definition, have more than average number of challenges, so Watson has plenty of company. One other factor is that Watson was more prone to lbw than most other batsmen, so the review situation arose more often, and so attracted more notice. Watson was also subjected to lbw reviews by bowling teams more often than any other batsman: 17 times, ahead of Ian Trott on 16. Only two of these resulted in overturns, and Watsons dismissal.\n\nWatson has not been the leading challenger of decisions: Misbah-ul-Haq has challenged 13 out of 14 decisions against him, with three overturns. Curiously, Alistair Cook has challenged only seven out of 19 lbw decisions against him, with two overturns.\n\n*******\n\nTop Order Batsmen Making their Maiden First-Class Century in a Test match.\n\nIt has happened occasionally with Zimbabwe players like GW Flower, BRM Taylor and AG Cremer, and some Bangladeshis.\n\nBut in the last 30 years I daresay the most prominent player who meets the criteria is (believe it or not) Kumar Sangakkara. Sangakkara's maiden first-class century came in his 10th Test match; it was his 50th first-class match and 76th innings. Remarkable. He played 103 innings before making a first-class century that was not in a Test match, and 140 innings before doing so in Sri Lanka.\n\nPerhaps 20 players from the last 30 years also fit. Most of them ore not particularly prominent, but Salman Butt had a highest score of 60 and only one fc half-century (average 13.7) when he opened for Pakistan v Bangladesh in 2003.\n\nDavid Warner, of course, played for Australia before he played first-class cricket, but that was in T20. He had a few fc centuries by the time he played Tests.\n\n19 August 2015\n\nHere are a couple of recent published articles.

Australias loss of five wickets in the first 4.1 overs of the Trent Bridge Test was unprecedented, not only on the first morning of a Test match, but in any Test innings. The 25 balls bowled beat the old mark of 28 balls by India (6 runs, 5 wickets) at The Oval in 1952. Even Bangladeshs worst  29 balls at Harare in 2004  was no match.\n\nEarliest Fall of Wickets in Test Innings\n\nWkt\n\nOvs\n\nBalls Bowled\n\nFoW\n\nBatting Team\n\n2\n\n0.3\n\n3\n\n2\n\nIndia (66)\n\nInd v SAf, Durban (Kingsmead) 1996/97\n\n3\n\n0.6\n\n6\n\n0\n\nPakistan (245)\n\nPak v Ind, Karachi (National) 2005/06\n\n4\n\n2.2\n\n14\n\n0\n\nIndia (165)\n\nInd v Eng, Leeds (Headingley) 1952\n\n5\n\n4.1\n\n25\n\n21\n\nAustralia (60)\n\nAus v Eng, Trent Bridge 2015\n\n6\n\n7.3*\n\n31\n\n7\n\nAustralia (70)\n\nAus v Eng, Manchester (Old Trafford) 1888\n\n7\n\n8.5\n\n55\n\n23\n\nSouth Africa (30)\n\nSAf v Eng, Birmingham (Edgbaston) 1924\n\n8\n\n9.4\n\n60\n\n24\n\nSouth Africa (30)\n\nSAf v Eng, Birmingham (Edgbaston) 1924\n\n9\n\n11.4\n\n70\n\n21\n\nAustralia (47)\n\nAus v SAf, Cape Town 2011/12\n\n10\n\n12.2\n\n77\n\n30\n\nSouth Africa (30)\n\nSAf v Eng, Birmingham (Edgbaston) 1924\n\n* 4-ball overs\n\nAustralia was all out before lunch for 60, with just 39 runs coming off the bat. Those 39 runs represents the worst showing by Australias batsmen since 1902, bowled out for 36 (33 off the bat) on an unplayable pitch at Edgbaston.\n\nStuart Broad (8 for 15) made a mess of all previous records for bowling on the first morning of a Test. I have updated various sections of the Unusual Records that were affected by this assault. Note that most of the other entries of this type involved at least some tail-end batsmen. The most astonishing aspect of Broads demolition is that it involved so many top order batsmen.\n\nIncidentally, Englands declaration before lunch on the second day is unprecedented for a team batting second, with the exception of one Zimbabwe Test.\n\n********\n\nReaching 100 on the last possible ball of a (full length) ODI innings (UPDATED)\n\nDI Gower\n\nAustralia v England, Melbourne (MCG) 1979\n\nWJ Cronje\n\nAustralia v South Africa, Peshawar (Arbab Niaz) 1994\n\nCL Hooper\n\nEngland v West Indies, Sharjah 1997\n\nMohammad Yousuf\n\nIndia v Pakistan, Dhaka 2000*\n\nCD McMillan\n\nNew Zealand v Pakistan, Christchurch 2001*\n\nDPMD Jayawardene\n\nSri Lanka v England, Colombo (Khettarama) 2001\n\nMohammad Yousuf\n\nZimbabwe v Pakistan, Harare 2002*\n\nRR Sarwan\n\nBangladesh v West Indies, Dhaka 2002n\n\nDR Martyn\n\nAustralia v England, Hobart (Bellerive) 2003\n\nKC Sangakkara\n\nKenya v Sri Lanka, Sharjah 2003\n\nVVS Laxman\n\nAustralia v India, Brisbane ('Gabba') 2004\n\nKP Pietersen\n\nSouth Africa v England, East London 2005*\n\nSR Tendulkar\n\nIndia v West Indies, Vadodara 2007\n\nKS Williamson\n\nZimbabwe v New Zealand, Bulawayo (Queen's) 2011\n\nDM Bravo\n\nWest Indies v Zimbabwe, Grenada 2013\n\nSikandar Raza\n\nZimbabwe v New Zealand, Harare 2015\n\nAB de Villiers (104)\n\nSouth Africa v India, Kanpur 2015*\n\n*reached century with a six.\n\nThere are possibly one or two others in early ODIs that have been overlooked, but unlikely. Pietersen is the only one to do it in the second innings; not surprisingly, he hit the winning runs with the same ball. McMillan and Williamson benefited from a second crack at the last ball because the bowler bowled a no ball.\n\nSreeram has mentioned Ravi Shastri reaching 100 on the last ball against Sri Lanka, Nagpur 1990/91, in a reduced overs game (45 overs).\n\nAt Wellington in 2001/02 (NZ v Bangladesh), play on the fourth day did not end until 8:06 pm local time. This is the latest stumps time that I have recorded for a Test match day. Play had been washed out on the previous day, and did not start until 1:00 pm on the day in question. Even so, 88 overs were bowled in the day.\n\nThere was a period in the late 90 and early 2000s when day lengths were very flexible when making up lost time, and days could run up to 7.5 hours play or even more. Eventually (by 2005) this was limited to a maximum 7 hours  or 6.5 hours, if no time had been lost  with maximum 30 minutes extension at start and finish in most countries. I think that play in England never starts early, but can extend 60 minutes at the end of the day to make up lost time.\n\nThere have been a couple of other days in New Zealand where time was called at or just after 8pm.\n\n********\n\nThe most balls bowled between wickets by an individual bowler in Tests is 952 balls by Maurice Tate spread over two series in 1929.\n\nA Queensland medium pacer named Alfred Ryan went wicketless for more than 1112 balls in fc cricket in 1936. Can't say the exact number, or if it is the record, but it seems to be the only case of more than a thousand if you just look at complete innings.\n\n********\n\nA search for most boundaries conceded in a Test produced an interesting result. Brett Lee conceded 44 boundaries at the SCG in 2003/04. Next highest is 42 by Jason Krezja on debut at Nagpur, John Gleeson at Port Elizabeth in 1970, and Tim Southee at Lord's just last May.\n\nLee also has most in an innings with 35, equal with Bill O'Reilly at Old Trafford in 1934.\n\nThere are some other possible candidates for which there is no data, but most of the 'most likely' cases have been covered. That includes cases like OC Scott in 1930, Fleetwood-Smith in 1938, and Fazal Mahmood & Khan Mohammad in 1958, all of whom conceded fewer boundaries than the above. Sri Lankas 952 in 1997 is also covered.\n\n9 July 2015\n\nI have been away for a few weeks, including a brief visit to England to visit family. I have posted a picture I took of a cricket match, which shows cricket as it is perhaps meant to be. A lovely setting and village green atmosphere. The bowler is my brother, still bowling fast(ish) at age 55. At mid-off is his son, also a quickish bowler. The match was at Wells, Somerset. One modern aspect: it was a Twenty20 game that started at 6:30 pm and still finished before sunset. You cant do that everywhere.\n\n********\n\nThe Longest Overs\n\nI have compiled a list of the longest single overs in the database, those with more than 10 deliveries. It is restricted to six-ball overs; there are quite a number of eight-ball overs that qualify, but I have excluded those. None of those eight-ball overs had more than 12 deliveries.\n\nMost Deliveries in a Six-Ball Over, where known\n\nDeliveries\n\n15\n\nCEL Ambrose\n\nWI v Aus, Perth (WACA) 1996/97\n\n13\n\nGOB Allen\n\nEng v Aus, Manchester (Old Trafford) 1934\n\n13\n\nJ Garner\n\nWI v Aus, Melbourne (MCG) 1984/85\n\n12\n\nDK Lillee\n\nAus v Ind, Melbourne (MCG) 1980/81\n\n12\n\nGR Dilley\n\nEng v Pak, Faisalabad 1983/84\n\n12\n\nJ Garner\n\nWI v Aus, Perth (WACA) 1984/85\n\n12\n\nCEL Ambrose\n\nWI v Aus, Perth (WACA) 1996/97\n\n11\n\nJT Sparling\n\nNZ v Eng, Auckland 1962/63\n\n11\n\nCC Griffith\n\nWI v Eng, Manchester (Old Trafford) 1966\n\n11\n\nJaved Miandad\n\nPak v Eng, Leeds (Headingley) 1978\n\n11\n\nRGD Willis\n\nEng v Aus, Brisbane ('Gabba') 1982/83\n\n11\n\nPIC Thompson\n\nWI v NZ, Bridgetown, Barbados 1996\n\nThe two appearances by Ambrose occurred in the same innings. The Sparling over was all legal deliveries, and was thanks to a severe miscount by the umpire. Most of these overs are concentrated in the time after the front-foot no ball rule, but before the decline in no ball counting in this century (partly because some umpires dont seem to bother much with watching for no balls any more). Still, it is surprising that no cases since 1997 can be found.\n\nI have not included the two double overs known in Test cricket (Armstrong in 1921 and Moir in 1950/51), where a bowler was mistakenly allowed to bowl two consecutive overs before and after a break.\n\nThere are a number of other cases where a bowler bowled a full over to end an innings and then bowled the first over when a follow-on was enforced. Merv Hughes did this twice. Technically, the most consecutive balls bowled by the same bowler in Tests was 17 by Ray Lindwall in 1946/47. He finished one Test (the third in Melbourne) with a nine-delivery over (eight balls plus one no ball) and sta"
