Andrew Balbirnie will captain the side, who start in a difficult group with Australia, South Africa and United States.\n\nEight of the fifteen named played in the 2008 tournament when Ireland couldn't pass the group stages, although they did manage consolation wins over Bermuda and Zimbabwe.\n\nIreland are chasing full-member status from the ICC and after the senior side's strong showing in the 50 and 20-over World Cups it will be important for the youngsters to show their ability. Their passage to New Zealand came after winning the World Cup Qualifying tournament in Canada and Matt Dwyer, the Ireland coach, is confident that his side can maintain the good run.\n\n\"We've got a very talented group of players who have been working hard in the gym and the nets to give themselves the best possible chance. They all play at senior level in Ireland and many of them have attracted the attention of English county sides.\n\n\"They know there's a senior World Cup coming up in the sub-continent in 2011, and a good showing in this tournament could well see them joining Paul Stirling in becoming a regular feature in the senior men's squad.\"\n\nBrian Walsh, the Ireland manager, echoed these sentiments and thinks that Ireland could stir a surprise in New Zealand. \"There's never been a greater opportunity for the players to progress, and there's no better motivation than a World Cup place. I've been impressed by their commitment and dedication in the build up.\n\n\"They've all been given fitness and conditioning schedules and their progress has been closely monitored by the backroom staff. It wasn't easy selecting a final group of 15, and there were some difficult choices to make. There's no doubt it's not the easiest of groups, but if we play to our potential, we certainly have the ability to cause a shock.\"\n\nSquad Andrew Balbirnie (Captain), Ben Ackland, Adrian D'Arcy, George Dockrell, Eddie Richardson, Graham McDonnell, Jordan Coghlan, Shane Getkate, Graeme McCarter, Lee Nelson, James Shannon, Stuart Poynter, Paul Stirling, Stuart Thompson, Craig Young.\n\nEmail Feedback Print\n\nICC Under-19 World Cup 2009-10\n\nMitchell Marsh to lead Australia's U-19 World Cup squad\n\nCricinfo staff\n\nDecember 18, 2009\n\nText size: A | A\n\nMitchell Marsh, the Australia Under-19 captain, has played two first-class matches this season Â© Getty Images\n\nRelated Links\n\nPlayers/Officials: Nick Buchanan | Josh Hazlewood | Alister McDermott | Mitchell Marsh\n\nSeries/Tournaments: ICC Under-19 World Cup\n\nTeams: Australia\n\nMitchell Marsh, the Western Australia batsman, has been named captain of the Under-19 squad for the World Cup in New Zealand in January 2010. Marsh, who played state cricket at the age of 17, was youngest player to play in Australia's domestic one-day competition and comes from a strong sporting family - his father, Geoff, played 50 Tests for Australia and his brother, Shaun, has played 19 ODIs.\n\nThe 15-man squad also includes two other players with fathers who played prominent roles in Australian cricket: Nicholas Buchanan, the son of former national coach John Buchanan, and Alister McDermott, the son of Craig McDermott. Alister McDermott made his first-class debut against the touring West Indians in November and picked up three wickets.\n\nSouth Australia fast bowler Kane Richardson is the other player with state experience in the squad, having played two List A matches and a Twenty20 game. Josh Hazlewood, the fast bowler from New South Wales, is the only one to have been part of the 2008 World Cup in Malaysia.\n\n\"I think we've got a side that will acquit itself well in the competition,\" Greg Chappell, chairman of the youth selection panel, said. \"Obviously we've got a couple of players that have played state cricket this season which stands them in good stead for the competition we're up against in New Zealand.\n\n\"The fact that the tournament is being played in New Zealand probably helps us a little bit in terms of providing similar wickets to that of Australia and the strong subcontinent teams maybe slightly disadvantaged by that. The subcontinent teams are always very strong and have some great young talent and if we were playing them in their own conditions I think it would be a very difficult challenge.\n\n\"I would expect that we'll get through to the semi-finals, I'd be very disappointed if we didn't make it that far and if you get a bit of luck once you make it there, then anything can happen. I'm confident we'll acquit ourselves pretty well.\"\n\nAustralia are seeded sixth in the tournament and were grouped with South Africa, Ireland and USA, against whom they will play their opening game in Queenstown on January 16.\n\nSquad: Mitchell Marsh (WA/capt), Timothy Armstrong (NSW), Tom Beaton (WA), Nicholas Buchanan (Qld), Jackson Coleman (Vic), Luke Doran (NSW), Benjamin Dougall (SA), Jason Floros (Qld), Josh Hazelwood (NSW), Alexander Keath (Vic), Nicolas Maddinson (NSW), Alister McDermott (Qld), Kane Richardson (SA), Thomas Triffitt (Tas), Adam Zampa (NSW).\n\nZimbabwe U-19 World Cup Squad Named\n\nThursday, 17 December 2009 19:02\n\nZIMBABWE Cricket have named their 15-man squad for the Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand in January.\n\nTalented top-order batsman Dylon Higgins, who turns out for the Midwest Rhinos franchise, captains the side.\n\nThe most experienced members of the squad are vice-captain Peter Moor and spinning all-rounder Tino Mutombodzi, who will be making their second appearance in the Under-19 World Cup after playing in the 2008 tournament in Malaysia.\n\nMutombodzi, of Mashonaland Eagles, Rhinos batsman Nathan Waller, as well as Manicaland Mountaineers legspinner Natsayi Mushangwe and his pace bowling teammate Tendai Chitara have all enjoyed regular first-class action with their respective franchises this season.\n\nIn preparing for the World Cup, Zimbabwe hosted Pakistan Under-19 in October, losing the youth ODI series 5-1 in Harare. They then toured Bangladesh last month with a depleted side and were duly whitewashed 5-0.\n\nThe team leaves on January 2 via Cape Town, where they will play warm-up matches against local youth teams. The World Cup will run between January 15 and 30.\n\nCoach Kevin Curran said of the squad: âWe have three legspinners and an offspinner. We will probably play two spinners depending on conditions. In the seam department we have six fast bowlers of which three are all-rounders. Weâve got good balance all round. Guys will be pushing for places.â\n\nZimbabwe are in Group C with hosts New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Canada.\n\nâWe need two wins to go into the Super Eight. We should beat Canada easily and try to get another win over Sri Lanka or New Zealand,â said Curran.\n\nThe 16-team tournament, which was inaugurated in 1988, showcases the best young players in the world and has served as a launch pad for a number of present and retired international stars.\n\nFull squad\n\nDylon Higgins (captain), Peter Moor, Gary Chirimuta, Dean Mazhawidza, Andrew Lindsay, Tinotenda Mutombodzi, Nathan Waller, Natsayi Mushangwe, Callum Price, Steve Chimhamhiwa, Richard Muzhange, Simon Mugava, Scott Daly, Mazvita Zambuko, Tendai Chitara.\n\nU-19 World Cup Titbits\n\nNotable past and present international players who have competed in the ICC Under-19 World Cup: Brian Lara, Sanath Jayasuriya, Nasser Hussain, Mike Atherton, Inzaman-ul-Haq, Chris Cairns, Chris Gayle, Ramnaresh Sarwan, Graeme Smith, Yuvraj Singh, Mehraib Hossain, Wayne Parnell.\n\nIn 1998, current West Indies captain Chris Gayle was the tournamentâs leading run-scorer with 364 runs. Zimbabwean Mluleki Nkala and West Indian Ramnaresh Sarwan were the leading wicket-takers with 16 wickets.\n\nIn the 2002 World Cup, Zimbabwe easily won the plate competition beating Nepal in the final. Zimbabwe captain Tatenda Taibu was named Man of the Tournament for his 250 runs and 12 wickets. He also kept wicket in between bowling stints!\n\n13 Zimbabwean players have competed in two Under-19 World Cups: Conan Brewer (2000-2002), Elton Chigumbura (2002-2004), Graeme Cremer (2004-2006), Sean Ervine (2000-2002), Greg Lamb (1998-2000), Alester Maregwede (1998-2000), Stanley Marisa (2002-2004), Hamilton Masakadza (2000-2002), Prince Masvaure (2006-2008), Mluleki Nkala (1998-2000), Tatenda Taibu (2000-2002), Brendan Taylor (2002-2004), Sean Williams (2004-2006).\n\n29 Zimbabwe Under-19 World Cup representatives have gone on to play for the senior Zimbabwe team at ODI or Test level.\n\nEnock Muchinjo\n\nDecember 20, 2009\n\nText size: A | A\n\nMichael Bracewell played in the 2008 edition of the Under-19 World Cup Â© Getty Images\n\nRelated Links\n\nPlayers/Officials: Doug Bracewell | Michael Bracewell\n\nSeries/Tournaments: ICC Under-19 World Cup\n\nTeams: New Zealand\n\nNew Zealand, the hosts of the Under-19 World Cup, have named a 15-man squad for the tournament which begins in January. They are yet to name their captain, but the squad features some players who've had exposure to the World Cup, having represented New Zealand in the previous edition of the competition in 2008 in Malaysia, where they finished third.\n\nAllrounders Corey Anderson and Harry Boam participated in the 2008 World Cup, so did wicketkeeper Michael Bracewell, the nephew of former coach of the senior team John Bracewell. Anderson and Boam are in their second year in first-class cricket along with Doug Bracewell, cousin of Michael.\n\n\"The Under-19 Cricket World Cup gives our younger players a wonderful opportunity to test their ability against the best of their peers in the international arena and to set the platform for successful first-class playing careers\" the team's coach Chris Kuggeleign said. \"The team is well balanced, with half the team having already played for the New Zealand Under-19s and a number who impressed at the recent National Under-19 tournament.\"\n\nNew Zealand, who will be based in Christchurch for the group round of the tournament, will begin their campaign against Canada on January 16. The other teams in New Zealand's pool are Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Prior to the competition, the hosts will take on Pakistan in a warm-up three-match series in Blenheim between January 3 and January 7.\n\nSquad: Corey Anderson (Canterbury), Tom Blundell (Wellington), Harry Boam (Wellington), Doug Bracewell (Central Districts), Michael Bracewell (Otago), Craig Cachopa (Auckland), Dane Cleaver (Central Districts), Jono Hickey (Northern Districts), Tim Johnston (Canterbury), Tom Latham (Canterbury), Jimmy Neesham (Auckland), Bevan Small (Central Districts), Mattie Thomas (Northern Districts), Logan van Beek (Canterbury), Ben Wheeler (Central Districts).\n\nICC Under-19 World Cup 2009-10\n\nChilly weather will test India - Chandrakant Pandit\n\nNagraj Gollapudi in Mumbai\n\nDecember 19, 2009\n\nText size: A | A\n\nCaptain Ashok Meenaria said the team's impressive tour of Australia this April has boosted their confidence Â© Getty Images\n\nRelated Links\n\nNews : Mike Young praises India Under-19's fielding\n\nPlayers/Officials: Ashok Meenaria | Chandrakant Pandit\n\nSeries/Tournaments: ICC Under-19 World Cup | Tri-Nation Under-19s Tournament in South Africa\n\nTeams: India\n\nChandrakant Pandit, India's Under-19 coach, has said his team's biggest challenge at the forthcoming World Cup in New Zealand will be the cold conditions. The biennial tournament starts on January 15 with India, the reigning champions, starting their campaign against Afghanistan in Lincoln. The final will be played at the same venue on January 30.\n\n\"It will be a little more chilly and windy out in New Zealand so the conditions will be different and the biggest challenge,\" Pandit said in Mumbai on the eve of the squad's departure to South Africa, where India will play a tri-series from December 27-January 5 that includes Sri Lanka. \"The boys need to get acclimatised as early as possible. We should be ready from the first game to handle the conditions.\"\n\nThe 15-member squad, led by allrounder Ashok Meenaria from Rajasthan, was a picture of confidence as it faced the media contingent at the Bandra Kurla Complex in Mumbai. Both captain and coach said the players have bonded well over the last year, when they've been together. Most of them were also part of the tour of Australia in April this year, where India won the ODI series 2-1 and drew the Tests 1-1.\n\nThe Indians finished a 10-day camp in Mumbai on Friday and Pandit said it was a fruitful exercise, with every player made aware of his role. \"Our plan was to go step by step,\" Pandit said. \"To begin with, we placed individual responsibilities in the camp. We want to do well in South Africa and finally come up with our best performance in New Zealand.\"\n\nThe seriousness of India's campaign can be gauged from the fact that guest speakers like Sachin Tendulkar, former Australian fielding coach Mike Young and sports psychologist Dr Bhimeshwar Bam spent quality time with the youngsters.\n\nPandit, a former team-mate of Tendulkar's, said the 45-minute conversation Tendulkar had with the players would stand them in good stead. \"Tendulkar spoke on how to approach a game. His technical feedback was really valuable,\" Pandit said. \"For example, he told the fast bowlers that when they run towards the target [batsman] they have to keep their head forward. We would Probably have learnt that after going there,\" Pandit said with visible excitement.\n\nHe said Tendulkar's most valuable advice was on \"trusting the teammate\". \"He told them that \"if you are going to stand next to each other you need to have the confidence in the other. Only then can the team perform\". The boys seemed to have understood the message as they started looking at the other from there onwards,\" Pandit said.\n\nAs for Young, he managed to instill a more enthusiastic approach to fielding. \"He made us enjoy fielding,\" Saurabh Netravalkar, one of the fast bowlers in the squad, said. \"He started with the basics of fielding, about how to start, how to position yourself, and made fielding easy.\"\n\nYoung just focussed on refining certain basics as he felt that Pandit had been carrying out the right drills and there was no need for him to introduce anything new.\n\nPandit said India haven't missed anything by way of preparation. \"We need to now look at how we are going to implement what we have been working on during the actual games.\"\n\nMeenaria said the defending champions were not in any way burdened by expectation. \"There is no pressure, instead we are more confident now - especially after winning in Australia,\" he said. \"I'm confident we are favourites to win the World Cup. But for now, our focus is on the South African tour.\"\n\nIndia play their first game against South Africa in Johannesburg on December 28.\n\nNagraj Gollapudi is an assistant editor at Cricinfo\n\nFeeds: Nagraj Gollapudi"
