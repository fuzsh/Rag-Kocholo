        "text": "Purpose: This article presents the development and validation of the Universal Transformational Management Framework (UTMF), an entrepreneurial tool to guide the development of inclusion-driven strategic management, planning and practice in sport organizations. Methodology: A range of qualitative data collection techniques were undertaken in this action research: 7 cross-sectoral semi-structured interviews; one focus group with sports professionals; a qualitative survey and research group consultations. A matrix analysis, a thematic analysis and secondary research were undertaken to analyse data. Findings: The UTMF is a staged framework that embeds principles of behavioural, organizational and transformative change theory, guiding strategic development towards inclusion from a contemplation phase towards an action and maintenance stage. The UTMF is composed of fourteen fundamental components identified as key areas that sport entrepreneurs should recognise and address for planning and delivering sport services that leave no one behind. Practical implications: Policy makers, management and sport professionals have at their disposal an inclusion-driven framework that challenges their systems and establish mechanisms to leave no one behind. Social implications: Organizational transformation can ultimately produce a contagion effect advancing equality and inclusion in society. The UTMF offers a structure for sport entrepreneurs aiming to facilitate and activate social transformation in and through sport. Originality: The UTMF is a wide-ranging framework to facilitate an orchestrated transformation of sport organizations in order to provide universal services that include marginalised groups and address global challenges identified in intersectional agendas like the SDGs.\n\nTheory development around sport for social change agendas has received greater attention from scholars over the past 10 years. Yet, it remains underdeveloped when compared to theoretical advancements and innovations in other aspects of the sport industry. This special issue answers calls to explore the nature of theory development within the sport for social change landscape. It invited scholars to explore and consider how theory can inform practice in sport for social change, and vice versa.\n\nObjective: To establish if consistent concepts exist amongst sports medicine professionals working within elite cricket when developing a multi-disciplinary performance team. Design: An exploratory research design was adopted and the findings were coded using a thematic analysis approach. Method: 6 semi structured interviews were conducted: England and Wales Cricket Board (n=3) Board of Control for Cricket in India (n=3). Each board comprised of Head of Physiotherapy, Head of Strength and Conditioning Coach and Head Coach. Data sets were analysed utilising thematic analysis. Results: Thematic analysis generated 226 codes, 9 sub-themes and 3 main overarching themes. Each theme was defined. The main themes were: ‘communication’, ‘performance parameter’ and ‘structure and governance’. Conclusion: Communication is key to collaborative work within a multidisciplinary team. However, several other factors must be considered when developing an MDT, which include innovation and strong struct..."
