        "text": "While enjoying the cracking first ODI in Melbourne this evening it struck me that perhaps Australia could use Nathan Bracken instead of a spinner when the team begins the return Test series in South Africa next month.\n\nI’m not suggesting that Nathan slow his delivery or shorten his run-up, what I am suggesting is that he be utilised in the spinner’s role be it as an attacking or defensive option.\n\nHe is a canny bowler that can bowl long accurate spells and if given the job I think it reasonable that he would be more penetrative than and as economical as his New South Wales team-mate Nathan Hauritz. Imagine a perfectly manicured Derek Underwood with beautiful hair and a diamond earring.\n\nObviously, I am not suggesting that Nathan Bracken is in the same class as the man they affectionately call Deadly but I think he could do a similar job for his team.\n\nUnderwood often bowled his spinners at a clip which were near unplayable on a damp surface but his greatest weapon was an inswinging arm ball that bent and dipped late. In today’s vernacular his arm ball would be identified as reverse swing but the ’70s were simpler times when everything that moved in an arc through the air was identified as swing no matter where the shiny side was facing.\n\nBracken’s stock ball has become a cutter and while I’d never expect him to move the ball off the pitch like Underwood, he does bowl a consistent line and length, varies his pace continuously, gets some movement even from the deadest surfaces and can bowl seam up when required. Most importantly he can apply pressure from one end allowing the captain the luxury of attacking at the other, an essential element if a team is to consistently take 20 wickets per match.\n\nA few weeks back I had the pleasure of watching the Sheffield Shield match between Tasmania and New South Wales at Bellerive and although on the losing team Bracken’s contribution and control were outstanding.\n\nHis match figures of 42-18-69-8 failed to win the match but his efforts certainly impressed the parochial Tasmanian crowd. The conversations after a tight and incredibly tense finish didn’t focus on the fighting match-winning partnership between Dan Marsh and Tim Paine but on the exceptional performance of Nathan Bracken.\n\nI understand that the conservatism of the Australian selection panel would prevent any such thoughts being aired during their meetings but I do consider it a worthy suggestion and I would be grateful knowing our readers’ views on Australia using Nathan Bracken not as a spinner but in the place of a traditional Test match slow bowler.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated\n\nMetatone,\n\na spinner will get some footmarks to work with on days 4/5…\n\nNot sure I subscribe either. How often has this happened? OK, now take Warne and Murali out of the equation, and how often has it?\n\nSlow/medium’s have probably had more impact in the last decade than spinners (except those two).\n\nHaving said that, I’ve been wondering about Krezja, was he so bad in Perth that he needed to be dropped? The ball with which he dismissed Amla was superb, and he deserved another game for that ball alone. And dropped for Hauritz?\n\nI agree it’s odd Bracken hasn’t been given a Test run (and I read a pointed interview with him in the SMH where he thought it was odd too), but it would still be nice to have a spinner in the side, not sure if Bracken could hold up an end on his own for extended periods.\n\nThanks for that link David, it was an interesting article and I’m heading up the nets shortly with a box of balls to see if I can bowl all three types of swing.\n\nToots, highlights by their very nature lack context and while entertaining they rarely tell the whole story.\n\nBoth Bracken and Hilfenhaus were let down by their captain last night who in the final powerplay (overs 45-49) changed the field every second ball.\n\nBasically, Ponting was at a loss tactically and admitted as much straight after the match. Although, he added that he’d be sitting down with the bowlers before the next match to work a strategy to use going forward.\n\nI know he is a busy fellow but it would have been helpful if he did that before the series began and not after. Still a great match that ebbed and flowed where once again JP Duminy was excellent without once breaching the boundary.\n\nNot sure about the team make-up excuse but Ponting said he hadn’t played under the new rule and was still to fully understand its implications.\n\nFair enough I suppose, as he also said that there are 80 odd ODIs to the next World Cup and everything and everyone will be tried so that when it comes around the team will be fully prepared to defend their title.\n\nBasically, every match is an experiment two years out and the strategy of not worrying too much about seemingly unimportant matches has worked very successfully in the past.\n\nTherefore, I assume, if a player will not be around in 2011 then their chances of selection are very thin as Noffke and Hodge have discovered recently.\n\nAs for the Test team, Jaques is looking a risk as he couldn’t get through training let alone three gruelling Tests in three weeks.\n\nMy personal opinion is that fit and proven players should be picked for South Africa and that means Brad Hodge and Chris Rogers should be in the squad regardless of their age. Obviously, choose Phillip Hughes as a backup but there is no need to throw the kid to the wolves. Hayden debuted too young in South Africa in 1993, and it set his development back more than a few years.\n\nLen – that’s a great story re Bob Appleyard, with such tragedy woven into such achievement and pleasure (in seeing through Maxwell and defeating the old monster). If Nesta doesn’t review the book himself, I’ll hope to do so here during the Ashes summer.\n\nThe older I get, the more convinced than ever I am that most of the problems one faces can be cured with careful application of imagination (allied to a little money / talent / luck / health etc). Appleyard’s style of bowler is often said to be obsolete in the age of uncovered wickets, but why is that so? A generation back, Test quality wrist spinners appeared to be a dying breed, as does the specialist keeper now (save the sublime Prasanna Jayawardene, and he doesn’t play every game).\n\nIn the same way that Ajantha Mendis has re-discovered some deliveries, might not Hoggy or Bracken or even someone like Dwayne Bravo or Jacob Oram attempt to bowl cutters and swingers at genuine medium pace (eg 120kmh)? With keeper standing up, off a shortish run to hurry the batsmen, I can see them being a handful in ODI cricket. After all, NZ’s Chris Harris (about the only such bowler I can think of in recent years) played 250 ODIs and delivered an economy rate of 4.28. If someone could regularly post figures of 10-1-42-1 in the middle overs of an ODI, they would be on the winning side more often than not. And surely Bracken, Hoggy, Bravo and Oram have ten times the bowling talent of Harris?\n\nNestaquin & TTT: To be honest, 99.94% of LotSW is devoted to Yorkshire CCC, so may not be of massive interest to you – although it seems to have developed a following amongst other county fans who bemoan the lack of a similar blog about their own club. Having said that, I do occasionally muse about lesser teams (mostly England).\n\nThe most interesting part of that video is when Appleyard shows his grip, it reminded me of an article I found once about the Iverson-Gleeson bent middle finger grip:\n\nhttp://planetnz.com/palmheads/myhacks.php?pg=bent_finger\n\nYou need to scroll past the Linux hacks at the top of the page to get at the article.\n\nIt makes you wonder, now that Mendis has had such an impact on his introduction to international cricket, if we’ll see imitators. I know that Azeem Rafiq, a young player on Yorkshire’s books and currently touring SA with the England U19 side, has experimented with the Mendis ‘carrom ball’. I believe he’s at the stage of being confident enough to bowl it in matches, although I think he said he’s yet to take a wicket with it.\n\nBtw, TTT: Appleyard is still active with Yorkshire, being President in 2007. So I would imagine he’s had conversations to Hoggard about bowling.\n\nAppleyard may not be well known to the general cricket fan, but in Yorkshire he’s well known and respected. But for injury and illness he would have broken many more records, and that despite not playing fist-class cricket until he was 26.\n\nShane looks very comfortable in retirement and although he is the best spinner in the country he doesn’t want to play. I don’t blame him. He had the fairytale finish and I know he is very satisfied with life.\n\nSo we must continue without him.\n\nAs for the malaise. It IS more than experienced players retiring. Ricky is struggling with the captaincy and soon that pressure and worry will affect his batting. Something the team can ill afford.\n\nI think the whole team needs further shaking up but unfortunately that won’t happen unless they fail to retain The Urn.\n\nI think the selectors have twigged that an era has ended and the statements about building towards a long term goal like the 2011 World Cup are encouraging. It’s a relief to know they are planning after doing bugger all for most of this century but they need reminding that a wrist spinner is far more important than mythical allrounders.\n\nThe Test team played very well at times but couldn’t sustain the excellence for long enough periods and although not the team of the past they are competitive and the nations that have beaten them of late, India and South Africa, have played exceptionally.\n\nSo, all is not rosy for the national team but they are still far from easybeats even with their best bowler displaying his skills in the commentary box on not and the paddock.\n\nI think the team and selectors are on the right track and like every exciting journey or story there’ll be some obstacles and errors made along the way.\n\nOn another subject – It’s been very dry in Hobart and a score of 300 may not be enough tomorrow. Pity the bowlers especially the seamers who I suspect will be punished without mercy."
