        "text": "Date of Birth - 28 July 1979\n\nClub - Bayswater-Morley\n\nPlaying Style - LHB, OB\n\nFirst Class Debut - (CBCA) v Matabeleland Invitation XI 1998-99\n\nPut aside the disappointment of an injury-interrupted debut season as Retravision Warriors Captain with a stunning 2008-09 which culminated in a long-awaited Test debut on the VB Tour of South Africa. He struck 117 in the first Test in Johannesburg, becoming the 18th Australian, and the first Western Australian, to achieve a century in his maiden Test appearance. He also went into the record books after scoring 103 & 141 in the Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield match against Victoria in November – accomplishing that feat of centuries in both innings for the second time, the first Western Australian to do so. He also led the Warriors' run-scorers in the Ford Ranger Cup, with 343 at 57.16, and notched 448 runs in just four innings for Bayswater-Morley in the Retravision Shield.\n\nDate of Birth - 4 October 1979\n\nClub - Melville\n\nPlaying Style - RHB, SLA\n\nFirst Class Debut - v TAS 2002-03\n\nThe Warriors' vice captain was one of the team's shining lights in the Ford Ranger Cup last summer, scoring 311 runs in eight matches, which included a match winning 104 not out against South Australia in Adelaide. His potential in the shorter forms of the game was underlined when he was selected in the Australian squad for the Commonwealth Bank Series and KFC Twenty20 International against New Zealand. His freakish catch on the boundary rope in the Twenty20 match to dismiss explosive Black Caps wicket-keeper Brendon McCullum is sure to feature in the highlight reels for many years to come. Married his long-time partner Kristy at the conclusion of the 2008-09 season before embarking on a stint with English county team Nottinghamshire in the northern summer.\n\nDate of Birth - 26 December 1980\n\nClub - Claremont-Nedlands\n\nPlaying Style - LHB, LM\n\nFirst Class Debut v QLD 2008-09\n\nThe emergence of Robinson as a quality batsman at first class level was a highlight for the Retravision Warriors in 2008-09. Earning his first interstate contract at 27 years of age after several prolific seasons in the Retravision Shield competition, the left-hander made his first class debut against Queensland at the WACA Ground, taking the place of Shaun Marsh who was summoned to join the Australian Test squad in India. Robinson scored his maiden century, a patient 141, in his second match – against SA at the Adelaide Oval. He finished as the Warriors' second highest run-scorer in the Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield with 531 at an average of 37.93. Robinson has spent the 2009 off-season playing for Shrewsbury in the Birmingham & Districts Premier League.\n\nDate of Birth - 18 June 1988\n\nClub - Melville\n\nPlaying Style - RHB\n\nFirst Class Debut v TAS 2008-09\n\nTowers earned a call-up to the Retravision Warriors team for the final three Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield matches of 2008-09 after a stellar season at lower levels. He was one of the leading batsmen in the Retravision Shield, scoring 674 runs at 39.65 for Melville and playing a leading role in their charge to the Minor Premiership. Was promoted to the WA Second XI for the Cricket Australia Cup match against QAS in Brisbane and went on to carry his bat in the first innings to score an unbeaten 143. One week later he notched up another century for a WA ‘A' team in a practice match against an English Academy side which secured his promotion to first class level.\n\nDate of Birth - 09 July 1983\n\nClub - Fremantle\n\nPlaying Style - LHB, RM\n\nFirst Class Debut v SA 2000-01\n\n?\n\nHas secured a Cricket Australia contract for the second successive season after a strong start to his international career in 2008-09. The big-hitting left-hander played 15 one-day internationals, scoring 582 runs at an average of 41.57, with five half-centuries and a highest score of 81. He also played three Twenty20 Internationals before hamstring injuries brought a premature end to his 2008-09 season during the Commonwealth Bank Series against New Zealand last February and again in the Chapal Cup series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. Earlier in the summer, Marsh was rushed to India as a replacement player for Australia's four-Test tour after fellow opener Phil Jaques was forced to return home with a serious back injury.\n\nDate of Birth - 20 October 1991\n\nClub - Fremantle\n\nPlaying Style - RHB, RFM\n\nFirst Class Debut vs New South Wales, 2009/2010\n\nUpon making his debut for the Retravision Warriors in the Ford Ranger Cup match against South Australia in Bunbury, Marsh became the youngest man to ever play in Australia's one-day domestic competition, and he was also WA's youngest debutante for over 70 years. His promotion to the Warriors' one-day team came a week after he broke Fremantle Cricket Club's record for the highest individual score in a Retravision Shield match, posting 208 against Gosnells, an innings which featured 26 boundaries and nine sixes, and surpassing the unbeaten 202 scored by the late Mark McPhee in 1993. Marsh has chosen to follow older brother Shaun and father Geoff into cricket, putting aside a promising career in Australian Rules football.\n\nDate of Birth - 25 April 1985\n\nClub - Scarborough\n\nPlaying Style - RHB, RM\n\nFirst Class Debut vs 2007-08 v SA\n\nStarted 2008-09 with a bang, scoring a patient 58 not out to take the Warriors to outright points in a low-scoring Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania at the WACA Ground, and followed up two days later with a brilliant 92 that earned him a Man of the Match award in the Ford Ranger Cup clash with the Tigers at the same venue. With those performances following a promising season in 2007-08, the focus is on Doropoulos to progress further and deliver on the potential he exhibited in a decorated under-age career. He finished last summer on a high by playing in Scarborough's third consecutive Retravision Shield premiership win.\n\nDate of Birth - 23 April 1981\n\nClub - Perth\n\nPlaying Style - RHB, WKT\n\nFirst Class Debut vs TAS 2002-03\n\nRonchi experienced the highs and lows of cricket in 2008-09. He was called into the Australian team for two KFC Twenty20 International matches against South Africa as Brad Haddin was given the opportunity to have a rest following a gruelling 3 mobile Test Series campaign. But one month after those games in Melbourne and Brisbane, Ronchi was dropped from the Warriors team for the Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield and Ford Ranger Cup matches against Tasmania in Hobart. The explosive wicket-keeper and batsman is determined to regain his place in the Warriors line-up in 2009-10 and it would be foolish to suggest he is incapable of reclaiming his place as one of Australia's premier glovemen.\n\nDate of Birth - 30 April 1977\n\nClub - Mount Lawley\n\nPlaying Style - RHB, RF\n\nFirst Class Debut vs (CBCA) v Zimbabwe A 1998-99\n\nPrized off-season recruit who has agreed to join the Retravision Warriors for the next two seasons. Noffke played two Twenty20 internationals and a one-day match for Australia in 2007-08, and in that same summer he became just the third player in the history of the Sheffield Shield / Pura Cup competitions to capture 50 wickets and score 500 runs in a season. He is also the only Queensland player to have won two consecutive Ian Healy Medals as Bulls Player of the Year. Noffke was Man of the Match in the Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield match against the Warriors at the WACA Ground last summer after taking seven wickets for the game and scoring a vital 40 from as many deliveries in the second innings.\n\nDate of Birth - 19 July 1978\n\nClub - Subiaco-Floreat\n\nPlaying Style - RHB, RM\n\nFirst Class Debut vs SA 2005-06\n\nEnjoyed his most consistent season for the Warriors in 2008-09, despite suffering horrific facial injuries after being felled by a short ball from Victorian paceman Dirk Nannes in a Ford Ranger Cup match at the MCG in December. Bandy's season looked to be over, but he finished with an unbeaten 87 in the final Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales at the SCG – heavy rain and bad light preventing him from the chance of a maiden first class century. He scored 322 runs at 35.78 in the Shield competition, and took five wickets at 28.80, and also averaged 35 in the Ford Ranger Cup. The summer ended with Bandy playing in a third consecutive Retravision Shield premiership with Scarborough.\n\nDate of Birth - 3 October 1977\n\nClub - Fremantle\n\nPlaying Style - RMF, RHB\n\nFirst Class Debut vs QLD 2004-05\n\nDorey reaped the benefits of an uninterrupted pre-season with arguably his best and most consistent season for the Warriors in 2008-09. The towering paceman was the leading wicket-taker in the Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield with 42 at an average of 24.11, which included his first ten wicket match haul against Queensland at the Gabba. He also led the Warriors' bowlers in the Ford Ranger Cup competition, picking up 13 wickets at 26.84, and skippering the team in the historic fixture against South Australia in Bunbury following the late withdrawal of Marcus North due to a finger injury. The accolades flowed at the end of the season – judged the inaugural MasterCard Interstate Most Valuable Player and taking out the Players Choice and Excalibur gongs at the WACA Premier Cricket Awards.\n\nDate of Birth - 17 December 1979\n\nClub - Melville\n\nPlaying Style - RFM, LHB\n\nFirst Class Debut vs Tas 2004-05\n\nAfter an excellent season in 2007-08 when he emerged as the Retravision Warriors' leading paceman across all forms of the game, Magoffin began the 08-09 summer with his maiden ten wicket haul in a first class match, taking 10-102 in the Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield clash with New South Wales at the WACA Ground. He went on to pick up 38 scalps in the Shield competition at 22.87, placing him second overall in the wicket-takers list behind Warriors team mate Brett Dorey. Magoffin's performances and consistency were recognised by Cricket Australia's National Selection Panel earlier this year when they rushed him to South Africa to act as a stand-by player for the Australian squad ahead of the second Test in Durban.\n\nDate of Birth - 29 October 1981\n\nClub - University\n\nPlaying Style - LHB, RF\n\nFirst Class Debut (VIC) vs NSW, 2004-05\n\nFormer Victorian Bushrangers paceman who moved west to play for University in the Retravision Shield for the latter half of the 2008-09 season. After taking seven wickets for the WA Second XI in a CA Cup match, Knowles was promoted to the Retravision Warriors team for their last two Ford Ranger Cup matches – against South Australia in Bunbury and Tasmania in Hobart. He took 5-62 against the Tigers, falling just short of the best bowling performance by a WA player in the Australian domestic limited-overs competition. He also made his first class debut for the Warriors in the final Weet-Bix Sheffield Shield match of the summer against New South Wales at the SCG.\n\nDate of Birth - 31 May 1981\n\nClub - Fremantle\n\nPlaying Style - RHB, RF\n\nFirst Class Debut -\n\nHogan has earned his first state contract after an impressive summer in Sydney grade cricket where he captured 54 wickets for Northern Districts at the superb average of 16.33, placing him fifth in the competition's leading wicket taker list. The strongly-built paceman played in his hometown of Newcastle with Mereweather before moving to Sydney in 2005-06 to try his luck. He returned to Newcastle the following summer, and after two seasons where he represented NSW and Australian Country, he headed back to Northern Districts in 2008-09, where his tremendous form saw him promoted to the NSW Second XI team for a CA Cup match against SA in Adelaide. Hogan also worked for Hornsby Shire Council as a groundsman at Northern Districts' home ground Waitara Oval."
