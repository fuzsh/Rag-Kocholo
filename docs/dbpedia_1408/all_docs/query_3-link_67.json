Close also captained Yorkshire and I later went on to captain Somerset, where he is widely credited with developing the county into a hard-playing team, and helping to mould Viv Richards and Ian Botham into the successful players they became.\n\nAfter being sacked by Yorkshire, the 39-year-old Close received offers from many other counties but preferred to accept a non-captain’s role at Somerset.\n\nThe rest from the captaincy did Close good; he went through the 1971 season without injury, and scored 1,389 runs, including a century in his first game for Somerset and a century in the game against Yorkshire.\n\nIn 1972. he was awarded the CBE by the Queen for his services to cricket. Close was also promoted to Somerset captain.\n\nDuring his time at Somerset Viv Richards and Ian Botham joined the county squad, and Close’s leadership and discipline helped them become great cricketers. Botham said of Close, “There was a genuine enthusiasm for cricket which rubbed off on all those playing alongside him. You couldn’t help but get excited by the game.”\n\nBrian Close retired from county cricket at the end of the 1977 season.\n\nThe Somerset Cricket Quiz – Answers 1 – 20\n\nThe Somerset Cricket Quiz – Questions 101 – 120\n\nJACK WHITE\n\n101What was White’s “Miracle of Brisbane’?\n\n102 On that tour in 1928 he was vice-captain.

More recently he has served as president of Somerset County Cricket Club from 2004 to 2015.\n\nIn 1961, he played for Somerset’s second eleven in the Minor Counties that season, being part of the team that won the Minor Counties Championship for the first time.\n\nIn August 1962, he played for six times for Somerset’s first team, batting middle-order batsman, but did not bowl.\n\nRoy played for Cambridge in the first half of the 1964 season and in the second half of the season, he again played regularly for Somerset. His best bowling figures, six for 83 were against Hampshire at Bournemouth.\n\nAfter the 1964 season, Roy went into legal practice and did not play first-class cricket at all in the following three seasons. In 1968, however, following the retirement as Somerset captain of Colin Atkinson, he reappeared as captain of the side, but an injury before the start of the season meant that he was able to play in only one of the opening six matches.\n\nAt the end of that season, he returned to the law and did not play first-class cricket for the county side again.\n\nPhoto from SCCC Players, Photographs and Statistics – available in the Museum and Library\n\nSomerset Cricket Club Players Gallery. Colin Atkinson.\n\nColin Ronald Michael Atkinson CBE (23 July 1931 – 25 June 1991) was an English first-class cricketer, schoolmaster and the headmaster of Millfield School.\n\nHe played from 1951 to 1958 for Northumberland and Durham, then also a Minor County, and appeared for the Minor Counties representative side in the first-class match against the Indian touring side, his first first-class appearance.\n\nHaving joined the staff at Millfield, he was approached to join Somerset for the 1960 season, the new captain at Somerset that season being, like Atkinson, a Teessider, Harold Stephenson. In 1960, He only appeared in the school holidays, and took his first five-wicket haul, five for 56, against Kent at Clarence Park, Weston-super-Mare.\n\nIn the following two seasons, released from his school duties for the summer terms, he played almost all matches for Somerset. He was awarded his county cap in 1961 and made his first half-centuries in 1962. His seven wickets for 54 runs against Gloucestershire at the County Ground, Taunton in 1962 remained his best bowling performance.\n\nThen, at the end of the 1964 season, Harold Stephenson, stepped down from the Somerset captaincy and Atkinson was released from school duties to take the job for 1965. He was an instant success: Somerset led the County Championship table in June 1965, eventuality finishing seventh and third in 1966, equalling their then highest-ever placing in the Championship. His final duty in 1967, was to lead Somerset in the Gillette Cup knock-out final at Lord’s, but the game was a disappointment, and Kent won the match. (See the article The Forgotten Final by Richard Walsh).\n\nPhoto from SCCC Players, Photographs and Statistics – available in the Museum and Library\n\nLympsham and Belvedere Cricket Club – Club History\n\nOur club is the result of a very successful merger in 2017, which created a thriving and very successful community-based club.\n\nThere has been a cricket club at Lympsham, a village halfway between Weston and Burnham, for many years, playing its cricket on what was no more than a field with a very small run-down cricket pavilion/shed. In 1992, with the help of a local landowner, the village created a brand new cricket pitch, together with a proper cricket pavilion and hard tennis courts, all of which was opened by HRH the Princess Royal on the May Bank Holiday with Somerset CCC (Trescothick, Caddick and all) coming to play the first match (and losing, of course!).\n\nContinue reading “Lympsham and Belvedere Cricket Club – Club History”\n\nSomerset Cricketers Players Gallery – Harold Stephenson\n\nHarold William Stephenson (18 July 1920 – 23 April 2008) was an English first class cricketer who played for Somerset, who captained Somerset from 1960 until his retirement in 1964.\n\nHarold Stephenson is the most successful wicket-keeper in history for Somerset, and is the county’s only cricketer to have taken 1000 dismissals. He also holds the county record for the most stumpings in a season as well as most catches in a season.\n\nHe joined Somerset for the 1948 season, but played in only eight matches. He kept wicket in only two of them, and was used mostly as an opening batsman, not with any great success.\n\nThe following season, however, he succeeded the long-serving Wally Luckes as the regular wicketkeeper and, despite missing half a dozen matches, he set a new county record for dismissals, with 39 catches and 44 stumpings.\n\nThe 1949 season set the pattern for Stephenson, he was at or near the top of the wicketkeepers’ lists for dismissals for the next decade, setting the Somerset record with 86 dismissals in 1954.\n\nAt end of the 1959 season, Maurice Tremlett, who had been Somerset’s captain since 1956, the first professional to hold the job in modern times, stood down from the job and Stephenson, at 39, was chosen to replace him.\n\nHe stayed in the captain’s job for five seasons and was successful: in 1963 he led the side to third place in the County Championship, equalling the best-ever position.\n\nStephenson retired from first-class cricket, apparently with some reluctance and continued to live in Taunton, but from 1965 to 1968 played regular Minor Counties cricket for Dorset. Apparently he didn’t return too often to the County Ground!\n\nPhoto from SCCC Players, Photographs and Statistics – available in the Museum and Library\n\nSomerset Cricketers Players Gallery – Gerry Tordoff\n\nGeorge Gerald “Gerry” Tordoff (6 December 1929 – 16 January 2008) played first-class cricket for Somerset, Cambridge University and the Combined Services in the 1950s and early 1960s.\n\nHe was a left-handed batsman who could open the innings or bat in middle order and a right-arm medium-pace change bowler and had two seasons of virtually full-time cricket in 1952 and 1955, but was otherwise restricted by his career in the Royal Navy to occasional matches. He was given leave of absence by the Navy to captain Somerset in the 1955 season, but when the season was over, he resigned the captaincy and never appeared again for the county side.\n\nPhoto from SCCC Players, Photographs and Statistics – available in the Museum and Library\n\nSomerset Cricketers Players Gallery – Stuart Rogers\n\nStuart Scott Rogers (18 March 1923 – 6 November 1969) played first-class cricket for Somerset and captained the side from 1950 to 1952.\n\nAfter one first-class appearance in India in 1946–47, he joined Somerset as an amateur player in 1948, appearing in seven matches but making little impact.\n\nAt the end of the 1949 season, George Woodhouse, the Somerset captain, retired to the family brewery business. Somerset, who had struggled through 1948 under a series of temporary captains, were not keen to repeat the experience. Rogers was the only available amateur willing to commit to a full season, and was duly appointed captain for 1950.\n\nRogers captained Somerset for three seasons of mixed fortunes. The 1950 season saw the side finish equal seventh in the Championship, and eight victories were exceeded by only three teams\n\nRogers’ second season as Somerset captain, 1951, was more difficult than the first. Rogers made only 784 runs in Championship games with a top score of 58, although his season average and total was improved by an unbeaten 107 in 160 minutes against the South African touring team.This was to prove his highest score in first-class cricket. With both batting and bowling inadequacies, Somerset dropped back to 14th in the Championship, with only five victories and 15 defeats.\n\nWorse followed in 1952 and Somerset fell to the bottom of the Championship table for the first time since 1913. At the end of the season he stood down from the captaincy, and though he appeared again in nine matches in 1953, he was not successful and left first-class cricket.\n\nPhoto from SCCC Players, Photographs and Statistics – available in the Museum and Library\n\nSomerset Cricketers Players Gallery – George Woodhouse\n\nGeorge Edward Sealy Woodhouse (15 February 1924 – 19 January 1988) had two careers: one as a cricketer for Somerset and Dorset, the second as the chairman from 1962 to his death of the family brewing company Hall and Woodhouse. As a cricketer, he was known as George Woodhouse; as a businessman, he was known as Edward Woodhouse.\n\nWoodhouse was a right-handed middle-order batsman, a very occasional medium-pace bowler and, once in his first-class career, a wicketkeeper. He played a couple of times for Somerset in 1946, and then fairly regularly in both 1947 and 1948, winning his county cap in 1947 after an innings of 109 against Leicestershire which proved to be his only first-class century.\n\nIn 1948, Somerset struggled to find a full-time captain, and Woodhouse officially shared the job with Mandy Mitchell-Innes and Jake Seamer, though at least two other players captained the side for occasional matches. In 1949, Woodhouse took over the captaincy full-time and played his only full season of cricket: he made 849 runs, though his highest score was only 59, at an average just below 20 runs an innings. He led the team to equal ninth in the County Championship table, and only three matches all season were drawn. But at the end of the season he stepped down to go into the family business, and he played only a few more times in first-class cricket, finally finishing in 1953.\n\nSomerset Cricket Players Gallery – Jake Seamer\n\nJohn Wemyss “Jake” Seamer (23 June 1913 – 16 April 2006) was a right-handed batsman who played for Oxford University and Somerset either side of the Second World War.\n\nSeamer joined the Sudan Political Service, which limited his first-class cricket appearances to periods of leave. He was named as one of three amateurs to captain Somerset in 1948, leading the team during June and July. That season was his last for Somerset, and he made only one further first-class appearance.\n\nDuring his time at Oxford, Seamer had become good friends with Mitchell-Innes; the pair both attended the same college, and played together for both the university and Somerset.\n\nSeamer did not appear again for Somerset after his period as captain in 1948. In total for the county, he scored 1,405 runs at an average of 15.61. He made his final first-class appearance the following season, appearing for the Free Foresters against Oxford University.\n\nPhoto from SCCC Players, Photographs and Statistics – available in the Museum and Library\n\nSomerset Cricket Players Gallery – Mandy Mitchell-Innes\n\nNorman Stewart “Mandy” Mitchell-Innes (7 September 1914 – 28 December 2006) was an amateur cricketer for Somerset, who played in one Test match for England in 1935. Between 1931 and 1949 Mitchell-Innes played 132 first-class matches, appearing 69 times for Somerset, and 43 times for Oxford University. He made his debut for Somerset while he was still a schoolboy at the now, Lancashire CCC, out ground Sedbergh School in 1931.\n\nMitchell-Innes was named as one of three captains of Somerset in 1948. Jack Meyer had reluctantly captained the side in 1947, but stepped down at the end of the season: he was having problems with his sight, and required daily painkillers for lumbago. There was no obvious replacement for Meyer; like many counties Somerset would not consider having a professional captain, and finding an amateur with the time and money to lead the side was proving troublesome.\n\nWhen Mitchell-Innes left the team for the Sudan, they were bottom of the County Championship with no points; they finished the season 12th of 17 after collecting 92 points, including five wins. Batting was identified as Somerset’s weakest area in both 1947 and 1948; Mitchell-Innes’ batting average of 22.20 placed him sixth in the county averages in 1948.\n\n1949 was his last season of first-class cricket, and he played his final match in May 1949 against Hampshire and died on 28th December 2006.\n\nPhoto from SCCC Players, Photographs and Statistics – available in the Museum and Library\n\nCleeve Cricket Club – Club History\n\n1998 was very important year In the life of Cleeve Cricket Club, The Club committee have been very busy organising events for their 50th year celebrations.
