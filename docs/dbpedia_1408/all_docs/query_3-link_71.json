        "text": "PR: Rod, congratulations on Heroes of the Heath winning the Bill Whittaker Award for best new book on Australian racing. Do you remember the first Caulfield Cup you saw live?\n\nRN: Thanks, Paul. I certainly do remember it. It was Big Philou's win on protest in 1969.\n\nWow. Big one to start. Were you working as a journalist or there as a spectator?\n\nI was a cadet journalist with the (Melbourne) Herald. The legendary Jack Elliott was my boss and I was just a kid. My job was to watch the race in a stand above the press room and jot down the one-two-threes (first, second and third) as they went over the line. Then I had to climb down a ladder into the press room, go into a phonebox and call the office with the details. Jack was in the booth next to me ringing through his cup story. He was beside himself - he'd backed Nassouri, who was first past the post. I'll never forget it. (Fellow journo) Bill Cosgrove came in and tapped on the window. \"The protest siren's just gone. Tell Jack, can you?\" I knocked on Jack's window and told him. He said, \"They don't protest in the Caulfield Cup,\" slammed the door and kept reading his copy. Usually after a race the press room is packed with people getting their copy organised, but this time they'd all gone outside because of the protest. I knocked on Jack's door again and said, \"Sorry, Mr Elliott, but …\" and before I could finish he looked out and asked, \"Where is everyone?\" I explained and he stormed off to the stewards' room.\n\nAnd what was he like when the protest was upheld?\n\nHe was ropeable. Not just because his bet had lost, but because he had to rewrite his story. These were the days when you could buy The Herald out the front of the track after the last. There was so much pressure to get the copy rung through accurate and on time. There were Melbourne Cup editions in the 1970s where we had a truck with a darkroom in the back. They'd get the film from the photographer and develop it as the truck drove back into town. The journos would ring the copy through. The truck would arrive, they'd run the print of the cup finish inside, they'd print off 10,000 copies or whatever and it would be back at the track to sell within an hour of the cup being run.\n\nI assume you were working at the Melbourne Cup a few weeks later when Big Philou was a late scratching after being doped.\n\nIt was an incredible time. I was only on a six-month cadetship and it was due to run out just after the cup. On cup day, I'm not sure why I was there, but I was walking past the birdcage area and I could see stewards and vets converging on a stall. Clearly something was wrong, so I raced back to the press room and told Jack. He charged off then came rushing back with the scoop that the Melbourne Cup favourite had been doped. The paper extended my cadetship for another three months and got me to work on the Big Philou story. I had to keep tabs on everything that was going on. You had one vet saying it was this and another saying it was that. Whenever a lead came up, Jack would send me off to interview someone.\n\nLes Lewis admitted to doping Big Philou some 30 years on. Did his name come up at all at the time?\n\nYes, his name was mentioned pretty early on. I chased him a few times for a quote, but had the door slammed whenever we asked if he was around.\n\nI'll come back to your time as a journalist in part two, but let's turn to the book. How did the idea come about?\n\nI was keen to work on a history of racing at Caulfield and Peter Le Grand (Melbourne Racing Club chairman 2018-22) also liked the idea. I didn't think readers would be that interested in the minutes of meetings and details of the finances, but I thought they'd be keen for stories on the participants or how the track has developed, so it became Heroes of the Heath rather than a traditional history.\n\nIt's almost a history of racing in Melbourne, rather than just Caulfield.\n\nYeah, we've covered all the star horses and jockeys and pinpointed how they went at Caulfield, as well as mentioning their other achievements.\n\nWhere did you start your research?\n\nWe tried to start with the commencement of the club, but there aren't a lot of records around from those days. The people at the Australian Racing Museum and Library were a great help with old newspaper clippings, while Caulfield has quite a collection of old racebooks, some dating back to early last century, as well as more recent stuff. I'd also kept tapes from interviews I did over the years.\n\nTapes as in the old plastic cassettes?\n\nYep, lucky I kept them. I've got chats with Scobie Breasley, Ron Hutchinson and Roy Higgins among them. Of course, Hutchy is still going strong at 96, so I was able to catch up with him for a chat. He was brilliant. He rode in the 1946 Caulfield Cup, when there were 108,213 there. They were on the infield as well as the grandstands. It must have been quite a sight.\n\nWhat was the most interesting story you came across that you didn't already know?\n\nThere were quite a few, but probably how TJ (Tommy) Smith and George Moore met at the cricket ground behind the track. TJ didn't have a trainer's licence then, but he was in Melbourne with a few horses. There was a trainers-and-jockeys cricket match going on and apparently TJ walked up to George and said, \"I'm going to train a derby winner one day and you're going to ride it.\" Legend has it that George thought, \"Who is this lunatic?\"\n\nThen there's the story of a property and stable next to the track called Tecoma, at 32 Booran Road. In the early days, Frank and Jack Godby had a lot of success training out of there. Later Angus Armanasco trained there and won seven Victorian trainers' titles, Peter Moody was there for another three, then Ciaron Maher and David Eustace moved in and won another five.\n\nIt's extraordinary that so many good trainers and horses came out of the same address.\n\nIt is, isn't it? There was also a run there where Weekend Hussler (2007-08), Typhoon Tracy (2009-10), Black Caviar (2010-11, '11-12, '12-13), Lankan Rupee (2013-14) and Dissident (2014-15) all won the Australian Horse of the Year award. In six of seven years, the best horse in the land was trained out of Caulfield.\n\nAnother part of the book I found fascinating was a list of the streets where trainers had stables.\n\nI was great friends with the late Jim Meek, who became known as a top trackman but at one stage trained horses from Rosebery Grove. Many years back he took me for a walk around the area and pointed out who'd trained from where. Basil Conaghan was in Bond Street, Geoff Murphy and Jack Godby in Booran Road. The Leeks - Herbie, Norm and Paddy - trained from Queens Avenue. There were other trainers in Manchester Grove, Eskdale Road and Redan Road, but most of them were in Rosebery Grove, at the back of the track. Guys like Des Judd, Ken Hilton and Colin Little had stables there.\n\nDo you remember the off-course stables?\n\nOh, yes. I can clearly remember driving along Neerim Road, which runs parallel to the back straight, and having to stop while horses crossed.\n\nDo you have a favourite Caulfield Cup?\n\nI've seen a few. The one that I feel closest to was Elvstroem in 2004. I mention it in the book, but one evening Jim Meek and I were having a quiet beer at the Caulfield Tabaret and Tony Vasil joined us. He had Elvstroem at the time and he told Jim that he was thinking of keeping him for the Cox Plate. Jimmy, in his usual straight-to-the-point way, said, \"You're a local kid who sold newspapers here after the last race. You were a Caulfield jockey. Now you're a Caulfield trainer. The Caulfield Cup's worth $2.5 million, and you're talking about giving it a miss?\" Then he took a breath and added, \"Seriously, Tony. You are a mug with a good horse.\"\n\nTony was convinced to change his mind and, when he won, he thanked Jim for his advice. I was standing near Jim, and it meant a lot to him. I sort of felt part of it, having listened in on the conversation.\n\nJohn Wren is a fascinating character from early last century. I didn't realise he was banned from Caulfield.\n\nYes, he won a fortune when he backed his horse Murmur to win £50,000 in the 1904 Caulfield Cup. With his winnings, he planned to open a racecourse at Eltham (24km northeast of the Melbourne CBD) and run an annual £10,000 race. The Melbourne Cup was only worth £6374 back then. Naturally the VRC (Victoria Racing Club) didn't like the idea so they banned Wren from entering any horses at their meetings. The VATC (Victoria Amateur Turf Club) at Caulfield did the same.\n\nI knew the story of Melbourne gangster Squizzy Taylor burning down the grandstand on Caulfield Cup Day 1922. But after reading your book, I'm starting to wonder if it was an insurance job.\n\nHa ha. Well, whoever it was probably did the club a favour as they wanted to replace the stand. When it burnt down, the insurance money helped build a new one.\n\nI wasn't aware that a future US president, Richard Nixon, went to a Caulfield Cup.\n\nI didn't know that either. We found a great picture from the paper the day after the 1953 Caulfield Cup of him watching the race with Sir Charles Lowe (Chief Justice of Victoria) and John Cain (senior, Victorian Premier). Nixon was vice-president then (president 1969-1974).\n\nThere was an interesting story to Yangtze's cup win in 1964.\n\nThis was another one I wasn't aware of. Apparently the public-address system went down just before the race and didn't start working again until well after Yangtze led all the way. There were 62,814 there and most of them had no idea who'd won.\n\nI also liked the story about the windsock along the side of the track.\n\nSid Hill was a leading bookmaker in the 1980s who used to walk the track back before it was a popular thing to do. He worked out that leaders couldn't win at Caulfield if there was a strong headwind coming down the side. He used to get down from his stand between races to check the flags on the grandstand roof to see which way the wind was blowing. If it was blowing in the direction of the turn towards the back straight, he knew it was hard for leaders to win and would set his board accordingly. Later a windsock was installed near the turn and it became known as \"Sid's sock\".\n\nLet's get into your time as a journalist. When did you start?\n\nI managed to get a cadetship at the (Melbourne) Herald straight out of school, So I was 18. It was 1969 and back in those days there were six VFL (Victorian Football League) games each Saturday. The legendary Alf Brown was in charge of the football department and each journo would be assigned a game to go and report on. One day, one of the reporters had the flu and couldn't go, so everyone moved up a slot and I was given the supposed sixth-best game of the round. Alf got a cardboard press pass organised and I jumped on the train out to Glenferrie Oval (Hawthorn) to work on my first ever game. It was Hawthorn versus Melbourne (May 3, 1969) and (Hawthorn full forward) Peter Hudson kicked 16 goals. At that stage I'd written a few four-paragraph stories about 10 pages in from the back. All of a sudden, I had a story about Huddo kicking all these goals on both the front and back page. It was quite a start.\n\nLater that year you covered Big Philou's controversial Caulfield Cup win, which we spoke about last week. Did you already like racing or did it come with the job?\n\nI did like racing. It was so big in the 1960s everyone followed it. At the end of the footy season in 1969 I'd switched over to the racing section for the rest of my cadetship. Three years later I became the paper's cricket writer and did that for 21 years, before returning to racing. I was still doing racing carnivals as well, when it didn't clash with the cricket.\n\nSo did you go on the overseas cricket tours?\n\nYes, I went on four Ashes tours to England, as well as a memorable tour to India, New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies.\n\nWere you on the 1977 Ashes tour when the World Series Cricket story broke?\n\nWould you believe I missed that one. I'd been working on Greg Chappell's book, The 100th Summer, so I couldn't get away for that tour. I did go to the first World Cup (1975), which was an amazing time, and then stayed for the Ashes tour that followed. I was able to get the exclusive on the pitch being dug up at Headingley during that series.\n\nReally? What happened?\n\nI was coming home from a disco of all things. The reporters were close to the team back then and remarkably I was in a cab with Ian Chappell, Rod Marsh and Dennis Lillee heading back to our hotel. At the end of day four Australia had lost three wickets and needed another 225 to win. It was all set up for a classic finish to a test match. Marsh (bowled Underwood, 12) and Chappell (lbw Old, 62) were already out so they knew they wouldn't be batting while Dennis was going to be well down the order, so they all went out and had a good time. As the taxi went past the ground, I could see all these lights on, which seemed strange. After the boys got dropped at the hotel, I headed back to the ground to check it out. There was a policeman on the gate, and I asked him what was going on. He told me some people had dug up the pitch. I mentioned I was a reporter, and he took me out to the centre. We found holes had been dug into the pitch and oil poured into some of them. Outside the ground, the protesters had painted, \"George Davis is innocent.\" Old George had been jailed for 20 years for armed robbery and a few of his mates didn't think he'd done it. (Davis was released the following year, only to be found guilty and jailed subsequently for his involvement in two other robberies.) I had the story in the early hours of the morning and phoned it through to the paper in time for it to make an early edition of The Herald in Melbourne. The news was out in Australia before the local English (journos) knew anything about it. They weren't happy when all their editors started asking them what the hell was going on.\n\nYou mentioned a memorable tour of India.\n\nThat was in 1979. They had six tests in eight weeks, but it came just after Graham Yallop had been sacked as captain, plus World Series Cricket had just finished up. The Australians were travelling around India in cattle class on trains and staying 10 to a room on occasions. Meanwhile, the World Series guys are back in Australia playing Sheffield Shield and staking their claims to take the places of the guys on tour. Throw in that India in 1979 wasn't as modern as it is now, and it was amazing we all survived it. It was such a memorable trip though. They were a great bunch of guys on that tour - Allan Border, Rodney Hogg and co.\n\nWhen did you return to doing racing more often?\n\nIt would have been the early 1990s. I took over as racing editor of the Sunday Herald Sun. I always enjoyed working on racing more than cricket or footy. In cricket, if Dennis Lillee comes out and takes three wickets in his first spell, which he often did, you wouldn't get to talk to him until after the day's play, six hours later. Same with the footy. If someone does something really good in the third quarter, you don't get to speak until it's all calmed down. In racing, you get the build-up to the race, the great adrenaline rush and excitement of the contest and then within seconds you can speak to the trainer, owner and jockey. And often in racing, there are so many different stories, as the participants and owners come from such varied backgrounds. I also loved the politics of racing.\n\nThere's been no shortage of material there.\n\nHa ha, there certainly hasn't. When I came back to racing in the 1990s, it was a hundred miles behind the other sports in terms of getting in the news. I remember having a chat with David Bourke (VRC chairman 1991-98) and pointing out how cricket operated with the media. How a story is a story, and it's better to have it out in the public, as it gets your sport in the public vision. The same with Peter Young at the Melbourne Racing Club. When we pointed out Taufan's Melody wasn't qualified for the Caulfield Cup (1998), it was front-page news four days in a row - three in the lead-up and the day after he won. The race had never had so much publicity.\n\nWhat was the biggest racing story you broke?\n\nGee, there were a few. I suppose one of the more satisfying was the back story of Michael Bastion, who was a con man who stung racing people for millions in Hong Kong with a scam promising them a massive return on their investments. He lived a high life, so everyone thought he had money and bought horses for him or invested with him. But he didn't have it and ended up mysteriously falling to his death from a building in Hong Kong (June 2000), while David Hayes was downstairs waiting to have dinner with him. It turned out he owed Hayes a million bucks and a few other racing people were conned out of up to $8 million. I worked on that story for a week before we broke it in the Sunday Herald Sun. It caused quite a stir with the guys who were working at the weekday edition of the paper. The boss, Peter Blundell, who is a huge racing fan, called all the racing guys in and gave them a dressing-down - \"How does this bloke, who only works one day a week, get a story you guys don't?\" Hayes ended up having to stay in Hong Kong a few more years than he'd initially planned, as all the money he'd earned in the first few years was spent by Bastion.\n\nWhile doing the Backtrack column on page four of Winning Post I've come across the Rails Run column you used to do in the Sunday Herald Sun in the 1990s. It makes great reading 25 years on. It covered plenty of tidbits but I notice you didn't hold back with a few of your opinions either. In recent weeks I found you suggesting the Adelaide Cup shouldn't be a Group 1 (which it no longer is) and pointed out a high-profile person claiming an idea that wasn't his. Did you often upset people?\n\nOh, yes, there were plenty of times I got some feedback that wasn't necessarily positive. But the idea of the column was to offer an opinion. If I had one, I was happy to get it out there. While we upset a few, we also had some pretty good ideas.\n\nSuch as?\n\nWe managed to convince the VRC that they should provide miniature cups to the jockey and trainer who won the Melbourne Cup. Up until the 1960s the jockey used to get a whip, but that had stopped. The jockey and trainer had nothing to show for their great effort. We wrote about it and the VRC took it on board. They brought them back and backdated it as well.\n\nAny others?\n\nThe other one was convincing the bookmakers to change their boards to decimal odds, in line with the TAB dividends. So, rather than the boards showing 11/8 or 15/4, they displayed $2.40 or $4.75 instead. We figured it was easier for everyone if the prices were displayed in the same terms, plus it was better for the next generation of punters and those who only watched races at carnival time.\n\nWhen did you give it away at the Herald Sun?\n\nI finished up in December 2017. I'd been there for 48 years. It got to the stage where you'd work for a week getting an exclusive story and then it would be on some website 60 seconds later with no attribution. No one knew who'd written it. And it's actually worse now. I thought, what's the point? I lost my zest for it all and decided I'd had enough. I'd had the best time, but it wasn't as much fun.\n\nAnd you've written a book since.\n\nYes, it has taken up plenty of time.\n\nWhere can our readers get a copy?\n\nIf they go to the Melbourne Racing Club's website mrcshop.com.au they can find a link there.\n\nThanks, Rod.\n\nMy pleasure, Paul. Great to catch up."
