His father was a glovemaker and wool merchant and his mother, Mary Arden, the daughter of a well-to-do local landowner. Shakespeare was probably educated in Stratford's grammar school. The next documented event in Shakespeare's life is his marriage in 1582 to Anne Hathaway, daughter of a farmer. The couple had a daughter the following year and twins in 1585. There is now another gap, referred to by some scholars as 'the lost years', with Shakespeare only reappearing in London in 1592, when he was already working in the theatre.\n\nShakespeare's acting career was spent with the Lord Chamberlain's Company, which was renamed the King's Company in 1603 when James succeeded to the throne. Among the actors in the group was the famous Richard Burbage. The partnership acquired interests in two theatres in the Southwark area of London, near the banks of the Thames - the Globe and the Blackfriars.\n\nShakespeare's poetry was published before his plays, with two poems appearing in 1593 and 1594, dedicated to his patron Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton. Most of Shakespeare's sonnets were probably written at this time as well. Records of Shakespeare's plays begin to appear in 1594, and he produced roughly two a year until around 1611. His earliest plays include 'Henry VI' and 'Titus Andronicus'. 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', 'The Merchant of Venice' and 'Richard II' all date from the mid to late 1590s. Some of his most famous tragedies were written in the early 1600s including 'Hamlet', 'Othello', 'King Lear' and 'Macbeth'. His late plays, often known as the Romances, date from 1608 onwards and include 'The Tempest'.\n\nShakespeare spent the last five years of his life in Stratford, by now a wealthy man. He died on 23 April 1616 and was buried in Holy Trinity Church in Stratford. The first collected edition of his works was published in 1623 and is known as 'the First Folio'.\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: Howard\n\nhttp://newdesktopwallpapers.info/WWE%20Wallpapers%202/John%20Cena%20You%20Can%27t%20See%20Me.jpg\n\nHey Ninny,you can't see me! ;D\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: CatwomanofV\n\nWhat a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how\n\ninfinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and\n\nadmirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like\n\na god! the beauty of the world, the paragon of animals—and yet,\n\nto me, what is this quintessence of dust?

McGee was also often the announcer on Hill's TV programme, delivering the upbeat intro \"Yes! It's The Benny Hill Show!\"\n\nBorn as Henry Marris-McGee in South Kensington, London, and educated at Stonyhurst College, McGee hoped to become a doctor, but the death of his father when he was 17 put financial strains on the family that ended his plans. Having enjoyed acting as a boy, McGee decided to follow his mother's side of the family, which could trace its involvement in acting back to Kitty Clive. He went on to play supporting roles in films and television series and dramas, including The Saint and The Avengers, but it is for comedy roles that he is best remembered, primarily and most famously for his straight man interviewer in the Benny Hill Show. He was also remembered by some as the 'mummy' of Honey Monster, a large, yellow, furry creature in advertisements for the breakfast cereal Sugar Puffs.\n\nMcGee played Two-Ton Ted in the video of Ernie (The Fastest Milkman In The West). Other comedy roles included the holiday centre manager in the 1973 film Holiday on the Buses, opposite Charlie Drake in the ATV/ITV situation comedy The Worker (1965–1970), and There Was An Englishman, An Irishman and a Scotsman for a BBC Scotland comedy series written by Lew Schwarz. McGee was the Englishman, with Harry Towb and Roy Kinnear in their respective roles. The show ran for 1 season in 1972. He also appeared in an episode of Rising Damp as a conman, Seymour. He had a long and successful theatre career, during which he tackled a wide range of roles, receiving plaudits for deadpan delivery in farces such as Plunder.\n\nMcGee had one daughter, Stephanie (born 1963). He spent his last six months in a nursing home, suffering from Alzheimer's disease. He is buried at Brompton Cemetery, London.\n\nhttp://images.tvrage.com/people/14/41434.jpg\n\nhttp://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/41278000/jpg/_41278374_mcgee203bbc.jpg\n\nWith Benny Hill.\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: Howard\n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/_9kdqHSTS5-0/Sww-GYamIuI/AAAAAAAABAg/9GK31u0sFjg/s1600/dontstandanotherchance.jpg\n\nThis album was 1982 and today she still looks good for 45 years old. :)\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: CatwomanofV\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lufvZTnaIrg\n\nCat\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: Philip Eno\n\nBritish Person of the Day: Margaret Rutherford\n\nDame Margaret Taylor Rutherford DBE (11 May 1892 – 22 May 1972) was an English character actress, who first came to prominence following World War II in the film adaptations of Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit, and Oscar Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest. She is best-known for her 1960s performances as Miss Marple in several films based loosely on Agatha Christie's novels.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Balham, London, she was the only child of William Rutherford Benn and his wife Florence, née Nicholson. Her father's brother Sir John Benn, 1st Baronet was a British politician, and her first cousin once removed is British politician Tony Benn.\n\nHer father suffered from mental illness, having suffered a nervous breakdown on his honeymoon, and was confined to an asylum. He was eventually released on holiday and on 4 March 1883, he murdered his father, the Reverend Julius Benn, a Congregational church minister, by bludgeoning him to death with a chamberpot; shortly afterward, William tried to kill himself as well, by slashing his throat with a pocketknife. After the murder, William Benn was confined to the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Several years later he was released, reportedly cured of his mental affliction, changed his surname to Rutherford, and returned to his wife, Ann (née Taylor).\n\nAs an infant Rutherford and her parents moved to India but she was returned to Britain when she was three to live with an aunt, professional governess Bessie Nicholson, in Wimbledon, England, after her mother committed suicide by hanging herself from a tree. Her father returned to England as well. His continued mental illness resulted in his being confined once more to Broadmoor in 1904; he died in 1921.\n\nMargaret Rutherford was educated at Wimbledon High School, and, from the age of about 13, at Raven's Croft School, a boarding school at Sutton Avenue, Seaford, where she is listed, aged 18, on the 1911 census.\n\nStage Career\n\nHaving worked as a teacher of elocution, she went into acting later in life, making her stage debut at the Old Vic in 1925, aged 33. Her physical appearance was such that romantic heroines were out of the question, and she soon established her name in comedy, appearing in many of the most successful British plays and films. \"I never intended to play for laughs. I am always surprised that the audience thinks me funny at all\", Rutherford wrote in her autobiography.\n\nRutherford made her first appearance in London's West End in 1933 but her talent was not recognised by the critics until her performance as Miss Prism in the play The Importance of Being Earnest at the Globe Theatre in 1939. In 1941 Noel Coward's Blithe Spirit opened on the London stage at the Piccadilly Theatre, with Coward himself directing. Rutherford played Madame Arcati, the bumbling medium, a role which Coward had earlier envisaged for her.\n\nRutherford had a distinguished theatrical career alongside her film successes. Totally against type, she played the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers in Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca at the Queen's Theatre in 1940. Her post-war theatre credits included Miss Prism in The Importance of Being Earnest again at the Haymarket Theatre in 1946 and Lady Bracknell when the same play transferred to New York in 1947. She played an officious headmistress in The Happiest Days of Your Life at the Apollo Theatre in 1948 and such classical roles as Madame Desmortes in Ring Round the Moon (Globe Theatre, 1950), Lady Wishfort in The Way of the World (Lyric Hammersmith, 1953 and Saville Theatre, 1956) and Mrs Candour in The School for Scandal (Haymarket Theatre, 1962).\n\nHer final stage performance came in 1966 when she played Mrs Malaprop in The Rivals at the Haymarket Theatre, alongside Sir Ralph Richardson. Unfortunately, her declining health meant she had to reluctantly give up the role after a few weeks.\n\nFilm career\n\nAlthough she made her film debut in 1936, it would be Rutherford's turn as Madame Arcati in David Lean's film of Blithe Spirit (1945) that would actually establish her screen success. This would become one of her most memorable performances, with her bicycling about the Kent countryside, cape fluttering behind her. Interestingly, it would also establish the model for portraying that role forever thereafter.\n\nSome of Rutherford's finest screen work was done when she was in her fifties and beyond. She was Nurse Carey in Miranda (1948) and Professor Hatton Jones in Passport to Pimlico (1949). She reprised her stage roles of the headmistress alongside Alastair Sim in The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950) and Miss Prism in Anthony Asquith's The Importance of Being Earnest (1952).\n\nMore comedies followed, including Trouble in Store (1953) with Norman Wisdom, The Runaway Bus (1954) with Frankie Howerd and An Alligator Named Daisy (1955) with Donald Sinden and Diana Dors. Rutherford then rejoined Norman Wisdom in Just My Luck and co-starred in The Smallest Show on Earth with Virginia McKenna, Peter Sellers and Leslie Phillips (both 1957). She also joined a host of distinguished comedy stars, including Ian Carmichael and Peter Sellers, in the Boulting Brothers' satire I'm All Right Jack (1959).\n\nIn the early 1960s she became synonymous with Miss Jane Marple in a series of four films loosely based on the novels of Agatha Christie. Rutherford, then aged 70, insisted on wearing her own clothes for the part and having her husband appear alongside her. In 1963 Christie dedicated her novel The Mirror Crack'd : \"To Margaret Rutherford in admiration\". Christie reportedly did not approve of the 1960s films as they portrayed Marple as a comedy character and were not faithful to the original plots.\n\nIn 1963 Rutherford was awarded an Academy Award and Golden Globe as Best Supporting Actress for her performance as the absent-minded, impoverished, pill-popping Duchess of Brighton, the only light relief, in Terence Rattigan's The V.I.P.s, a film featuring a star-studded cast led by Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.\n\nShe appeared as Mistress Quickly in Orson Welles' film Chimes at Midnight (1965) and was directed by Charlie Chaplin in A Countess from Hong Kong (1967), starring Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren, which was one of her final films.\n\nRutherford was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1961 and was raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in 1967.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nRutherford married character actor Stringer Davis in 1945 and the couple appeared in many productions together. They were happily together until Rutherford's death in 1972. Davis adored Rutherford, with one friend noting: \"For him she was not only a great talent but, above all, a beauty.\" Davis rarely left her side. He was private secretary and general dogsbody - lugging bags, teapots, hot water bottles, teddy bears and nursing Rutherford through periods of depression. These illnesses, often involving stays in mental hospitals and electric shock treatment, were kept hidden from the press during Rutherford's life. In the 1950s, Rutherford and Davis unofficially adopted the writer Gordon Langley Hall, then in his twenties. Hall later had gender reassignment surgery and became Dawn Langley Simmons, under which name she wrote a biography of Rutherford in 1983.\n\nDeath\n\nRutherford suffered from Alzheimer's disease at the end of her life and was unable to work. Davis cared for his wife devotedly at their Buckinghamshire home but she died on 22 May 1972, aged 80. Many of Britain's top actors, including Sir John Gielgud, Robert Morley and Joyce Grenfell, paid tribute at a memorial service, where 90-year-old Sybil Thorndike praised her friend's enormous talent and recalled that Rutherford had \"never said anything horrid about anyone\".\n\nRutherford and Davis (who died in 1973) are interred alongside each other in the graveyard of St. James Church, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire.\n\nFilmography\n\n1936 Dusty Ermine\n\n1936 Talk of the Devil\n\n1937 Beauty and the Barge\n\n1937 Big Fella\n\n1937 Catch as Catch Can\n\n1937 Missing Believed Married\n\n1940 Quiet Wedding\n\n1941 Spring Meeting\n\n1943 The Yellow Canary\n\n1943 The Demi-Paradise\n\n1944 English Without Tears\n\n1945 Blithe Spirit\n\n1946 While the Sun Shines\n\n1947 Meet Me at Dawn\n\n1948 Miranda\n\n1949 Passport to Pimlico\n\n1950 The Happiest Days of Your Life\n\n1950 My Favourite Husband\n\n1951 The Magic Box\n\n1952 Curtain Up\n\n1952 The Importance of Being Earnest\n\n1952 Castle in the Air\n\n1952 Miss Robin Hood\n\n1953 Innocents in Paris\n\n1953 Trouble in Store\n\n1954 The Runaway Bus\n\n1954 Aunt Clara\n\n1954 Mad About Men\n\n1955 An Alligator named Daisy\n\n1957 The Smallest Show On Earth\n\n1957 Just My Luck\n\n1959 I'm All Right, Jack\n\n1961 On the Double\n\n1962 Murder She Said\n\n1963 Mouse on the Moon\n\n1963 The VIPs\n\n1963 Murder at the Gallop\n\n1964 Murder Ahoy\n\n1965 Murder Most Foul\n\n1965 The Alphabet Murders\n\n1966 The Chimes at Midnight\n\n1966 A Countess From Hong Kong\n\n1968 Arabella\n\nhttp://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Margaret_Rutherford.gif\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: Howard\n\nAlways nice to hear one of Elton's songs.\n\nSubject: Re: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day\n\nWritten By: CatwomanofV\n\nThere is a rumor that Bob Dylan may be getting back together again.\n\nCat\n\nNEXT PAGE: ninny's New Person & Word of the Day"
