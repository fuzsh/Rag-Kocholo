        "text": "Archived News : September-October 2009\n\n31.10.2009\n\nONOFORO LEADS PERTH TO GRAND FINAL GLORY\n\nPerth SC captain David Onoforo turned in a best on ground performance to guide his team to a 2-0 Grand Final victory - and the title of State Champions for 2009 - over Western Knights on a sunny afternoon at Clipsal Stadium. Ian McMurray put one Perth hand on the trophy when he opened the scoring early in the second half with Onoforo sealing the win after 72 minutes. It was a great all-round team performance from us today, said Onoforo, clearly delighted with his teams performance. We spoke about it in the week, about being focused and every player, including the subs, contributed to a great victory for the club today.\n\nThe bumper crowd of 1,720 had hardly time to settle into their seats when the Knights threatened for the first time through Anthony Campbell whose cross-shot from the right drifted wide of the post. Perth werent to be outdone and four minutes later a crisp first time shot by Matt Danskin brought a good low save out of Frazer Siddall. There was no let up in the tempo with the two teams trading attacks in search of an opening goal. On the quarter hour Andy Bourakis long-range attempt was held by the Knights custodian, the ball was quickly spirited to the opposite end where Campbell flashed a header wide from Barry Devlins cross.\n\nPerth had the benefit of a swirling breeze for the first half and in the 30th minute Bourakis 25-metres free-kick was caught by the wind, forcing Siddall to back pedal and tip the ball on to the crossbar at the last moment. Five minutes later Siddall again came to his sides rescue, saving well from Danskins long-range shot. At the other end, Perth youngster Luke Martino had to be alert to punch clear a David Micevski in-swinging corner. But it was Perth who ended the half on top with another Bourakis free-kick tipped over by Siddall, then minutes later Danskins shot from the right whistled narrowly the wrong side of the upright.\n\nThe second half was given a crackerjack start with Dom De Felice crashing the ball into the base of the post with Siddall well beaten, and soon after Greg Sharlands first time strike whizzed just wide. The Knights should have taken a 53rd minute lead through Devlin but after driving inside the 18-yard box the midfielder blazed high from 10-metres. It was a costly miss as, three minutes later, Bourakis superbly released Onoforo whose low centre from the by-line was rammed into the net at close-range by McMurray. Controversy reigned soon after when Stuart Fergusons header was prevented from entering the net by De Felice, despite Knights claims the Perth midfielder was over the line.\n\nWith the Knights committing players forward they were always running the risk of being caught out at the back. And thats exactly what happened on 72 minutes when Sharlands terrific diagonal long ball found Onoforo, who expertly skipped around Ivan Zuvela before angling his low shot beyond Siddalls reach to double Perths lead. Campbell and Danskin were fortunate to remain on the park following a heated clash that sparked an ugly melee, however, referee Mathew Cheeseman was quick to defuse the situation. Craig Simpson had a header clear off the line by Zuvela as Perth attempted to add a third to their tally\n\nThe Knights werent ready to throw in the towel by any means and bombarded their opponents goal throughout the closing stages. Marco Warmt-Murrays low shot was well saved by Martino, then David Annall should have done better that lift over the bar from 8-metres. 82 minutes were on the clock when Daniel Micevski teed up brother David but the midfielder blazed disappointingly high from the edge of the box. David Micevski almost made amends soon after with a cracking volley from 15-metres which cannoned back off the bar, before the final chance of the day saw Martino deny Daniel Trim.\n\nWith the final whistle came the beginning of a long night of celebrations for Perth, whose coach Graham Normanton was over the moon with his teams performance. We played really well today. We were primed for it and ready to go, he said. The conditions were difficult, the wind caused us problems. But we played some good football and the goals really speak for themselves, both were well set up and well finished. We could have scored a couple more but to win 2-0 in a final - Im delighted!\n\nKnights coach Paul Price was disappointed to have fallen at the last hurdle. Perth was the better side on the day, we had some chances but it wasnt our day, said Price, who rued the decision not to award a goal for Fergusons second half header. The boys were convinced the ball was over the line which would have made it 1-1. Those things can change matches, but to be honest we had a few players that didnt perform particularly well today, and Perth deserved their win.\n\nPerth SC: Luke Martino, Trent Kay, Michael Icanovski, Craig Simpson, Matt Danskin (Andres Oliveira 84), Greg Sharland, Gary Greenhill (Michael Black 75), Dom De Felice, Andrew Bourakis, David Onoforo, Ian McMurray\n\nWestern Knights: Frazer Siddall, Ivan Zuvela, Stuart Ferguson, David Annall, Cormac Dawson (Stanford Hepburn 70), Daniel Micevski, Barry Devlin, David Micevski, , Marco Warmt-Murray (Karl OReilly 87), Anthony Campbell, Daniel Trim\n\nBookings: Devlin (41), Campbell (75), Danskin (75)\n\nDismissals: Nil\n\nReferee: Mathew Cheeseman\n\nAttendance: 1,720\n\n31.10.2009\n\nBRISBANE WOMEN THRASH GLORY\n\nDefending champions Brisbane Roar have confirmed their status as W-League pacesetters with a clinical 6-0 thrashing of third-placed Perth Glory at Ballymore Stadium. The home team came out firing and had secured the three points on offer inside the quarter hour by slotting in three unanswered goals. Lana Harch started the rout in the 8th minute by going around Collette McCallum before unleashing a powerful strike that goalkeeper Emma Wirkus could do little about. The margin was doubled as Wirkus failed to take cleanly Kate McSheas looping cross, which was sent into the net by Courtney Beutel. And another scrap inside the 18-yard box on 13 minutes ended with Ellen Beaumont firing sharply in the hosts third.\n\nThe second half started much like the first, Brisbane piling the pressure on their opponents. It was Harch who found the back of the net on 54 minutes by calmly sliding the ball under Wirkus after getting on the end of a cross. Casey Dumont was little more than a spectator for much of the afternoon but on 77 minutes was beaten by Alex Singer, who was denied a consolation by Pam Bignolds clearance. Beaumont grabbed her second, beating several defenders before putting a sweet left-footed strike into the net ten minutes from the end. But Brisbane werent yet finish and in stoppage time substitute Sasha McDonnell rounded off the win with a spectacular shot from just inside the box to bringing the final margin to six goals, the biggest of this W-League season.\n\n31.10.2009\n\nGLORY CROWDS UP!\n\nThe perception is A-League crowds are falling - but that is certainly not the case with Perth Glory. Western Australias national league representative has gone back in time to the National Soccer League days with the number of spectators attending home games this season well and truly up. Glorys average for the first five games of the 2009/10 summer is 9,843 - a 24% increase over last season and the biggest of any A-League club. The climb was capped with a season-high 12,872 for the round nine outing with North Queensland Fury.\n\nOwner Tony Sage said he was ecstatic with Glorys attendances ahead of tomorrows game against second-placed Melbourne Victory at ME Bank Stadium. The FFA is very happy with the off-field performances of Perth Glory in relation to is crowds, so that was a ringing endorsement since last year when they were hammering me every week to try and entice more crowds, said Sage, who took the off-season gamble of bringing Jacob Burns, Mile Stejovski, Chris Coyne, Andy Todd and Branko Jelic to the club. I think the fans out there realise now that Perth Glory is here to stay.\n\nA-League crowds are up for four of the clubs who were in the league last season, and down for the other four. Glorys 24% rise is mirrored by New Zealand outfit Wellington Phoenix (13%). However, the news is not all rosy with Brisbane Roar shedding around 25% of their 2008/09 average attendance, while at Newcastle the drop off is a staggering 38%. Newcomers Gold Coast United have brought with them the competitions smallest average crowd, as well as heavily criticised plans to cap their attendance at 5,000 to save money.\n\n31.10.2009\n\nMRDJA FIGHTS FOR HIS FUTURE\n\nNik Mrdja accepts he is fighting for his A-League future as he battles to show Lawrie McKinna and other possible suitors that he is worth a fresh deal. Mrdja, 30, is out of contract at the end of the season and the injury-riddled striker needs some big performances to convince coach McKinna he is worth keeping for another year. His statistics this season do not make great reading - he still hasn't found the back of the net at first team level this campaign - but Mrdja is likely to be included in the Mariners squad for this evening's match with Adelaide United.\n\nMrdja received a much-needed confidence when he netted a hat-trick for in the National Youth League game against Newcastle United last week and he believes a goal in the A-League is not far away. \"Eventually I'll come good,\" Mrdja said. \"I'd like to keep playing in the A-League and I would like to stay on the coast. I haven't had a great record with injuries - that's what has stopped me. But I feel I've got on top of that now.\" McKinna has shown great faith in Mrdja while he has been out for long periods with injury and still believes he has the potential to be a consistent scorer at national league level.\n\n31.10.2009\n\nGLORY YOUTH BEEF UP (courtesy Perth Glory)\n\nPerth Glory Youth will be close to full strength for tomorrows home clash with Melbourne Victory as the clubs horror run of injuries finally looks to be behind them. The young West Australians have struggled to field a side this season and relied on replacement players for the most part, at one stage having eleven of sixteen contracted players unavailable. Despite those setbacks Glory Youth have shown plenty of character to be equal on points with third placed Adelaide United. Utility players Ryan Pearson and Adam Taggart return to the squad this week and follow five of their team mates who returned in a thrilling 4-3 win against the Australian Institute of Sport last weekend.\n\nDefender Dean Evans, one of those to return to action last weekend, says it has been a big confidence boost to have the majority of the squad back up and running. Weve had a lot of injuries but were slowly getting everyone back in the side, Evans said. We had quite a few guys come back last week and they did really well and it just adds more strength to the side when the coach has a fit squad to pick from. That said, the boys that come in and covered did really well and stepped up to the plate when we needed to get the job done.\n\nPegging back the AIS after falling behind on numerous occasions showed a resolve that will benefit the young Glory side for the remainder of the season according to Evans. Coming back from two-nil down last week showed good character among the boys. We stuck to our tactics and never gave up. We just played our game and worked really hard to get back in there and got the result in the end which was great, commented Evans, who concedes a home record of a win, a draw and a loss needs improvement. We think we can win every game with the squad weve got. Weve got to start making our home ground a fortress and make it tough for every team that comes over here.\n\nAfter making an impressive debut in the inaugural National Youth League season, Evans was looking forward to backing that up this season but has endured a frustrating injury battle and missed the opening six rounds with a knee complaint. He made an impressive comeback against the AIS and cant wait to get back onto the pitch this weekend as he and the rest of the squad test themselves against a quality Melbourne side. There are a well organised side and we know what theyre capable of from what they achieved last year. Were definitely expecting a tough game but well be ready for Melbourne, he said. Its great to be back. I always like playing in front of our home crowd and I know the boys are pumped up to get another win on the board.\n\n30.10.2009\n\nFAMILIAR FOES GO ROUND ONE FINAL TIME\n\nPerth SC v Western Knights (Referee: Mathew Cheeseman)\n\nThe 2009 season comes to a close tomorrow afternoon when Western Knights takes on long-time rival Perth SC in the Grand Final of the Flexible Signage Solutions at Clipsal Stadium (3.00pm). The Knights won through to the season finale with a hard fought 2-1 win over Floreat Athena last week and will be hoping to turn end a three-game losing streak to Perth. The teams met for the first time this year in late June when Perth ran out 3-1 winners at Nash Field courtesy of goals from Genaveo Human, David Onoforo and Phil Arnold, with Mario Marcinko on target for the hosts. Then on the final day of the regular season Onoforo scored both goals in the Blues 2-0 win at Dorrien Gardens.\n\nThe teams met again only a fortnight ago in the Major Semi-Final when Graham Normantons side came out on top 3-2. Perth started the year by winning the Night Series and their coach is hopeful of adding the Top Five series trophy to the cabinet at Dorrien Gardens. We have beaten them three times this year but that all counts for nothing especially when it comes to a Grand Final, commented Normanton. We are confident that we can do well but we are not over-confident. We fully respect Western Knights and their achievements this year so there is no way we can go into this game over confident or complacent in anyway shape or form.\n\nNormanton expects Saturdays game to be a true spectacle for the neutral observer. There will be two distinctly different styles of football being played so it will be interesting to see which of us can impose ourselves over the other. Both sides are capable of scoring freely so Im sure that it will be a very entertaining game with lots of chances, he said. The Knights have some very good players that we will have to take care of but we cant concentrate on just those players as every player can hurt you if you dont show them the respect that they deserve. David Micevski proved last week what ability he has to turn a game on his own he is a player that we cant allow to have a major influence on the game.\n\nPaul Price, coach of the Knights, was glad to get back in the winners circle last week after going three games without sampling victory. It was nice to win a game after losing two and drawing one since we won the League in September, so were looking forward to the game on Saturday and go into it full of confidence, said Price. Perth has beaten us three times this season but thats in the past. We hope Inglewoods ground is in good condition and it will be a showpiece for West Australian football. You have to take your chances in all games you play, especially finals, or you are put under pressure. Fortunately we did that against Floreat (and) Saturday will be know different, the side that converts their chances will win.\n\nThere may be a trophy riding on the outcome of Saturdays game but as far as Price is concerned its just another game they want to win. Were treating the game like any other as a number of our players have set routines, especially Stuart Ferguson who has to be last out of the dressing room, so we will not change a thing for Saturday, he the former Welsh international. Its a Cup Final so I shouldnt have any problems getting the players ready for the game. Weve worked on a few things this week in training, we conceded two goals from free-kicks against Perth in the Preliminary Final - one was an unstoppable shot but the other was just poor defending - so we have to watch that on Saturday.\n\n30.10.2009\n\nMICEVSKI AND SHARLAND HAVE THE FINAL WORD\n\nJust how great an influence David Micevski and Greg Sharland can assert on tomorrows Top Five play-off final will go a long way to determining which clubs has their hands on the trophy at days end. The pair are no strangers to the pressures of football, Micevski having played professionally for Perth Glory and at youth international level with Australia whereas Sharland spent a season with English club Charlton Athletic either side of season-long stints with Wollongong Wolves and Glory.\n\nMicevski was best on ground when the Knights downed Floreat Athena in last weeks Preliminary Final, scoring once and setting up the other for Anthony Campbell. We have played Perth four times this season and only beaten them once - a 1-0 win in the opening round of the Night Series, said the talented midfielder. You could say Perth has had the wood on us but its finals football and the best team on the day will win. We finished the regular season on top for a reason and well all be going into Saturdays final full of confidence.\n\nSharland, who has been outstanding this season, strongly believes the best two teams of 2009 are meeting in Saturdays showcase. It is a great way to end the season with the top two teams from the season fighting out for the major title, he said. One confidence booster I feel is the game being played on a pitch like Perths, we have been training all year on a large ground we will be able move the ball around how we like. The Knights have had an outstanding season at their ground, so Im very happy it is away from Nash Field.\n\nTheres a rat deal of mutual respect between Micevski and Sharland, with both well aware of the others capacity for turning a game. Dave has had a great year, said Sharland. I have only seen him three times this year, however, a lot of talk from the Knights has been about him hopefully he can get another crack at the big leagues soon. Those sentiments were echoed by Micevski, Greg is a player you cant give a lot of space to. His crossing and delivery from set pieces are dangerous, so we have to make sure we dont give him much time on the ball.\n\nPerths hopes of lifting the final piece of silverware on offer this year received a blow with the suspension of Phil Arnold, however, Micevski says his former club have several players capable of causing problems. Obviously Phil is a loss for Perth as he gives them that extra pace going forward. But they have other players who can step up and do a job, he explained. Both sides like to attack which will hopefully make it an exciting game for the supporters. Last time we met the majority of goals were scored from dead ball situations and again I feel this could be the difference between on the day.\n\nThe Knights enter the game with pretty much a full compliment of players for coach Paul Price to select from. Sharland feels that, in all likelihood, the final game of 2009 will go down to the wire. I agree with David, in a major Final there probably wont be many chances. Whichever team can make the most of their chances will come out on top by the end, and I hope its us, he said. The live and exclusive broadcast of the Flexible Signage Solutions Grand Final commences from 2.30pm on 107.3 Heritage FM, with match highlights available on footballwest.tv from Monday afternoon.\n\n29.10.2009\n\nLEGENDS TO KICK OFF GRAND FINAL\n\nA host of retired State League champions will don their boots in the curtain raiser to Saturdays Top Five play-off Grand Final. The West Australian Ex-State and International Masters will take on a Football West Legends Select side prior to the season finale between Perth SC and Western Knights at Clipsal Stadium. The Masters team, joint winners of the Seniors World Cup in April, features one-time Perth Glory striker Bobby Despotovski, dual Gold Medallist Norrie Sutton and the versatility of Alan Pottier. Amongst the Legends number are inaugural Glory captain Gareth Naven, former Socceroos defender Robbie Dunn and goalkeeping extraordinaire Willie McNally. The West Australian Ex-State and International Masters go head-to-head with the Football West Legends Select side from 1.30pm.\n\n29.10.2009\n\nKERR FAMILY SHINES AS CODE-BREAKERS (courtesy the 'West Australian')\n\nTheir respective football codes may be rivals, but siblings Sam and Daniel Kerr save their competitive instincts for the field. Sam, a member of Perth Glory Women, is proving her older brother and Eagles player is not the only talented athlete in the family. The teenager returned home from Myanmar last week fresh from scoring two goals in Australia's 8-0 victory over Thailand in the ASEAN Football Federation Under-16 women's championships final. The performance enhanced the 16-year old's growing reputation, with the youngest member of the Kerr household having made her international debut for the Matildas in February.\n\nSam, an attacking midfielder, showcased her credentials by starring in last weekend's 1-0 victory over Adelaide United, just days after returning from international duty. Despite the best on ground performance, she readily admits her game is not without faults. \"I'm a lazy defender,\" she joked. \"I like running with the ball, running at people. It's fun and I like scoring goals, but I hate defending.\" Sam left Perth on Wednesday to join Australia's squad for the Asian Football Confederation's under-16 titles in Thailand. The competition will double as the qualifiers for next year's Under-17 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nDaniel, who returns to pre-season training with the Eagles next week, said he shared a love for the round-ball sport. \"Probably if I had my time again, I wouldn't mind having a crack at it myself,\" he said. \"It's probably a little bit easier on the body. It's a very interesting game to watch. I follow a lot of international soccer and the Glory men as well, so I love her playing soccer. It gives me more of an opportunity to watch the game.\" Daniel is happy to shelve any protective big brother instincts when it comes to watching Sam in action. \"She's big enough and old enough to handle herself against other women now,\" he said.\n\n29.10.2009\n\nUWA-NEDLANDS THE NEW FORCE IN FOOTBALL\n\nThere's a new football power emerging in the western suburbs with the formation of UWA-Nedlands. An amalgamation of amateur giants University of WA and the juniors of Nedlands, the new club will be one of the largest in Western Australia and is expected to become a major player on the local scene in the years ahead. \"We're very excited by growing the club through this merger,\" said UWA-Nedlands president Guy Hattersley. \"UWA were the most successful club in the Amateur competition this year and with this union we hope to build a very strong youth development program which will drive are progression into the top echelons of WA football.\"\n\nThe establishment of UWA-Nedlands is very much a win-win situation for both foundation clubs. \"Nedlands were looking for a progression for their talented juniors and UWA needed a youth structure to progress to Saturday State League competition, so a merger was the natural response to meeting both clubs desires,\" commented Hattersley. \"The club will provide a 'cradle to grave' opportunity for players of all levels of ability. Our long-term plans include developing a quality facility in the UWA sports complex as well as providing a variety of football levels within the club.\"\n\n29.10.2009\n\nGUESS WHOS COMING TO DINNER? (by Ashley Morrison, Not the Footy Show )\n\nThe Football West Gold Medal dinner has quite rightly become the main event in the football calendar in Western Australia, and congratulations must go to Anthony Green and Jodie MacCullum for raising the bar during their time with the association. Also to Ben Fitzpatrick and Kiera Treloar for picking up the baton and continuing to maintain and improve the standard set. All we have to do now is make sure that the players respect the event and dress appropriately.\n\nIt is a measure of how big the event is now that decisions have had to be made as to how many people receive invitations to attend free of charge. During my brief time at Football West that number was reduced from close to 200 free tickets to under 100 as we tried to claw back a $35k loss on the night from the previous year. This year it appears that the administration is trying to do the same, as again they are limiting the number of free tickets issued - or are they?\n\nWe have been advised that the board have taken a decision to invite only the mainstream media, at the expense of some of the local outlets who have supported the game. By mainstream media it is supposed that this will mean the West Australian and the Sunday Times. The latter has, to be fair, given the league coverage - the West has not but will be the best way of giving major sponsor McInerney Ford exposure as they are bound to give the winner exposure in the Saturday edition. And, ultimately, that is good for the game.\n\nWe hear that Heritage FM, who covered the league on the radio all season, have not been given free tickets, which if true is downright embarrassing. The same applies to the team at footballwa.net - these guys gave the only internet coverage to the State League for many years and are still the first point of call to many followers of the game so to shun them now is rude and downright foolish. What we do hope we will not see on the night are the board members attending with their partners and having claimed two tickets free of charge.\n\nIt is also hoped that we do not see commercial television and radio stations who refuse to acknowledge the existence of the State League being given tickets ahead of people dedicated to the game, who work week in week out trying to promote it on community radio. These people have kept the game alive and it is wrong to ignore that fact. If the commercial media are invited and there is no extra coverage gained next season we as stakeholders in the game need to look at why they were invited, and if was it for footballs gain or for their own or the board members business gain?\n\nAs annoying and unjust as this whole ticket issue appears to some, the stakeholders need to start looking inward. The stakeholders appoint the standing committees who in turn appoint the board. Are the right people on the standing committees? Are the standing committees doing what the Crawford Report gave them power to do? This has to be brought into question as two of the standing committees at the last board election, had no representation - and one still does not to this day. Should one person be allowed to be a representative on two standing committees? Does a standing committee of two people represent the views of the whole state, and if their views differ how do they vote? These are all questions that the stakeholders need to address.\n\nThe whole idea of the Crawford Report was to give the power to the stakeholders, however, it appears that the stakeholders in a lot of cases show little regard in the processes, and then are very quick to moan when their voices are not heard. The stakeholders appoint the board and trust them to oversee the running of the game by those employed by Football West. Too often the board interferes with the day to day running of the game, and that is why I believe the structure needs to be reviewed, but if we are sticking with the same structure a strong CEO appointed. The latter is unlikely as the board are not going to what a strong CEO who stands up to them.\n\nOne question that still has not been answered is Why, when the last CEO left in June of 2009, are we waiting for a new CEO to be appointed after the end of the season? Luke Martin appears to be trying very hard to run Football West but it is not right for the game to be run by a board member. Mr Martin inherited an organisation short on finances and is looking to minimise the losses on the Gold Medal night, a commendable and understandable. However, it is a tightrope that is being walked in regards to looking after those who have genuinely assisted with the promotion of the league in 2009 and who honestly merits a free ticket to our gala night.\n\n29.10.2009\n\nSTERJOVSKI 90% CHANCE OF PLAYING AGAINST MELBOURNE\n\nSocceroo Mile Sterjovski is almost certain to take part in Perth Glorys vital home game against Melbourne Victory this weekend. Sterjovski missed Glorys past two games due to an ankle problem but has made steady progress in his recovery and trained solidly with the team today. Its definitely better than it was last week, Sterjovski said. I thought I was going to be fine for the game against North Queensland (last Saturday) but after the final training session I pulled up a bit sore. We didnt want to risk it and cause any further damage so thats why Ive rested it until now. The way Im feeling Id say Im about a 90% chance of playing, Ive got about four or five days to give it a good test so well see how it goes. Im pretty confident that its going to be okay.\n\nGetting back to full fitness has taken on added importance for Sterjovski, who revealed he missed the chance to join the Socceroos recent camp in Melbourne due to the injury. Pim (Verbeek) asked me to come into the camp on the Sunday, but unfortunately I was injured after the Adelaide game on the Friday night and couldnt make it, he explained. That was the most disappointing thing for me because it might have given me a chance to play but the World Cup is still a long time away and Ive got plenty of time to make it into the squad. The same thing happened to me last time (2006 World Cup) and I ended up making the team in the final selection so Im not too worried at the moment. The most important thing is to keep playing regularly, play well and to win games.\n\n28.10.2009\n\nAMPHLETT IS JOONDALUPS TOP PLAYER\n\nLivewire attacker Tommy Amphlett could not have been happier with the outcome of ECU Joondalups annual presentation evening. Amphlett picked up his clubs highest individual honour, the Players Player of the Year, along with the trophy as Top Goal Scorer. Dale McCulloch picked up the Coaches Award with versatile teenager Jake Benson-Cooper was voted the Young Player of Year. Former State Schoolboys representative Damien Houston was voted the Players Player of the Year at Reserve team level where the other awards went home with Craig Cheeseman (Coaches Player of the Year) and Joseph Lado (Top Goal Scorer). Australian Under-17 international Alex Grant was installed as Youth team Players Player of the Year, Brandon ONeill collected the Coaches Player of the Year with the Top Goal Scorer shared by Jonathan Stynes, Josh Brook and Robert Rixer.\n\n28.10.2009\n\nMATILDA DE VANNA SUSPENDED\n\nStar striker Lisa De Vanna has been slapped with a two-match suspension after being found guilty of offensive behaviour and intimidation of a match official during Perth Glory's W-League win over Adelaide on Saturday. De Vanna was angry when Glory coach John Gibson decided to substitute her in the 31st minute, prompting her to swear at the coaching staff and a fourth official as she made her way off the pitch. She then raised her middle finger towards a few members of the crowd as she went down the tunnel to the change room.\n\nFootball Federation Australia found De Vanna guilty of bringing the game into disrepute on two fronts. FFA deemed she displayed \"offensive behaviour, including offensive, obscene, provocative or insulting gestures or language\" as well as \"intimidation of match officials, including derogatory or abusive words toward a match official\". One match of De Vanna's two-game ban will be suspended for a period of six months, meaning she will only miss this weekend's away match with Brisbane Roar unless she re-offends before 24 April.\n\n28.10.2009\n\nSTRACHAN WILL HELP BORO: WILLIAMS\n\nRhys Williams has revealed that the arrival of a new manager has brought a spring to the step of the entire Middlesbrough squad. This weeks appointment of former Scotland international Gordon Strachan, who took over at the Riverside from Gareth Southgate this week, has had an immediate effect on the clubs players. Nobody is guaranteed a place. We know that every spot is up for grabs. We have to work hard if we want to be in the team, commented Williams, who spend the past few days training under Strachan and his assistant Garry Pendrey. The new gaffer and Garry are putting their stamp on things and I think it can only benefit the team. Training has been good - its disciplined and at a higher tempo.\n\nWilliams revealed that Strachans playing pattern, which he wants the Boro players to adopt, was already beginning to emerge. The gaffer likes us to play. He wants everyone to have the ball. You can tell that he is a good coach. We are a young set of lads and you can see that he believes he can help us, added Williams, who is looking forward to improving his game under the new coaching team. I want to be more comfortable on the ball, and effecting the game more, and hopefully he will help me with that. So everybody is working hard. If I work hard then hopefully I will be given my chance.\n\nBoro, currently fourth in the English Championship, entertain second-from-bottom Plymouth Argyle this weekend. Victory on Saturday in combination with other results go in Boros favour could propel them to the top of the table. We could be better placed, but top spot is not too far off and thats what we have to aim for, said Williams. If you go on a good run of games without losing then you will end up at the top. Burnley lost just two out of 17 when I was there last season and that was the secret of their success. The league is just as tight as it was last season. Thats why a run of games will make all the difference.\n\n28.10.2009\n\nINJURY GETS THE BETTER OF SIKORA\n\nPerth Glorys injury woes have continued with striker Victor Sikora to miss the clubs next two matches with a hamstring tear. The 31-year old Dutch international injured his right hamstring during Saturdays 2-1 loss to North Queensland Fury soon after netting midway through the first half. Sikora, who has scored twice in three games, was replaced just before the interval after feeling tightness in his leg. I thought it was feeling tight only but the scans showed there were two tears, it really was a nasty surprise, Sikora said. I have felt more tightness in games before and nothing has happened, but unfortunately this time something was there. He is expected to return for the 22 November game with A-League leaders Sydney FC at ME Bank Stadium.\n\n28.10.2009\n\nPETKOVIC CONSIDERS AUSTRALIAN RETURN\n\nSocceroos goalkeeper Michael Petkovic could be tempted to don the gloves of A-League newcomers Melbourne Heart in their inaugural campaign. Petkovic, currently with Turkish Super League outfit Sivasspor, has voiced a desire to return home and play in the A-League, possibly following next year's World Cup. \"It's something that I've always wanted to do,\" said 33-year old Petkovic, who comes off contract at Sivasspor after this European season. \"I started my career in Australia in the national league back then, so with the new league that's been formed there, I'd like to go back and play as long as I can before I finish my career. We'll see, we've still got time, we'll see what happens after this season.\"\n\nIdeally, Petkovic would prefer to return home to Perth and follow in the footsteps of older brother Jason, who played 177 times for Perth Glory between 1999 and 2008. \"I would like to go home and actually play in my hometown where I grew up,\" said Petkovic, who would need to unsettle youngsters Tando Velaphi and Aleks Vrteski in order to occupy the role between the posts. \"I played most of my career in Melbourne and overseas so going home and playing in Perth would be something nice and something that I would love to do. But, there's only ten teams there so I don't think you can pick and choose where you want to go.\"\n\nPetkovic would also fancy a return to Melbourne, where from the 2010/11 season there will be twice as many A-League goalkeeping spots up for grabs. \"I had some great success in Melbourne and have a lot of friends and family there as well,\" added Petkovic, whose career blossomed at South Melbourne where he was a key contributor to the club's back-to-back National Soccer League titles of 1998 and 1999. \"I want to play in the A-League and wherever it is, I'd love to take the opportunity. To play and with a Melbourne team, it'd be a great opportunity.\" Newly-appointed Heart coach John vant Schip has yet to sign any players to his foundation roster since his appointment on 12 October.\n\n27.10.2009\n\nGLORY OUT FOR VICTORY (courtesy Perth Glory)\n\nJacob Burns says his team will be looking to extend their unbeaten home run and continue an excellent record against Melbourne Victory in Sundays all-important clash at ME Bank Stadium. Perth Glory has taken maximum points from Victorys last four trips to the west, however, Burns says they wont be banking on past results to get them over the line this weekend. Everyone keeps saying that were good against Melbourne and in the past weve done this and weve done that but this is a crucial clash and we cant take anything for granted, Burns said. Well take a positive attitude into the game and are looking forward to taking on Melbourne however past results means little, theyre a great side and we need to be on our toes.\n\nGlory are coming off back-to-back losses away at Brisbane Roar and North Queensland Fury, results which were not a true reflection of their performances. The side remains in fourth place, only five points away from top spot, after several weekend results fell their way. Burns says its time Glory takes their destiny into their own hands and start reaping the rewards that recent on-field efforts deserve. Weve been very fortunate with some of the results that have gone our way so its kept us there, but we cant keep slipping up and relying on other results. We need to look at our own game, tighten up the areas that we need to and really put on a good performance to keep us up there, commented Burns.\n\n27.10.2009\n\nCANNING SALUTE CAPTAIN VAN DONGEN\n\nPaul Van Dongen has been rewarded for a superb season in the middle of the park for Canning City by winning the club's two highest awards - the Players' Player of the Year and Coaches Player of the Year. \"Paul had probably his best ever season and thrived in the attacking central midfield role that he prefers,\" said club president Malcolm Watson. \"His work rate and distribution have always been top notch but this year his runs from midfield really showed what an intelligent player he is. Paul has the potential to do even more and is already rated in top five midfielders in the state.\"\n\nStar in the making Nathan Hubbard was awarded the Mitchell Allomes Memorial Trophy. \"Nathan's progress from our Under-16s to making his first team debut in the space of a season reflects his great attitude and commitment to go with his natural talent,\" commented Watson. Midfielder Emlyn Whetnall went home with his second successive Players' Player of the Year for the Reserves, where the Coaches Player of the Year was presented to Dave Evans. Michael Everett's efforts were recognised with the Youth team Players' Player of the Year, while Simon Correia was named Coaches Player of the Year.\n\n26.10.2009\n\nYOUNG SOCCEROOS CALL-UP FOR WA TRIO\n\nThree of Western Australia's brightest young talents will wear the green and gold for next month when the Young Socceroos line-up in the AFC Under-19 Championship qualifiers in Indonesia. Adelaide United's Mark Birighitti is one of two goalkeepers in the 23-player squad where he's joined by striker Eli Babalj and defender Trent Sainsbury, both currently at the Australian Institute of Sport and part of the Next Young Socceroos squad that finished as runners-up at the recent AFF Under-19 Youth Championship.\n\nBirighitti is looking forward to the chance of once again representing his country after putting behind him the disappointment of narrowly missing out on a place in the Australian for the recent Under-20 World Cup. Missing out on the Under-20 World Cup was obviously disappointing but Im thrilled to get another chance to represent my country and I look forward to helping the team do well, Birighitti said, who was an integral part of the Next Young Socceroos squad that finished runners-up at the ASEAN Football Federation Under-19 Championship in August.\n\nThe Young Socceroos will assemble for a short training camp in Sydney prior to departure for Indonesia. Their opening game is against Hong Kong on 7 November, and over the course of the following week and a half Australia plays Chinese Taipei, Singapore, Indonesia and Japan at the Si Jalak Harupat Stadium in Bandung, Indonesia. The top two ranked teams will progress to the 2010 AFC Under-19 Championship next November. The host nation for the tournament will be determined next month with the Competitions Committee considering bids from China, Thailand and Indonesia.\n\nThe Australia squad for the AFC Under-19 Championship 2010 qualifiers is Mark Birighitti, Matthew Leckie (Adelaide United), Eli Babalj, Chris Bush, Jared Lum, Trent Sainsbury, Nikola Stanojevic, Lawrence Thomas (Australian Institute of Sport), Daniel Bowles, Thomas Oar (Brisbane Roar), Steven Lustica (Gold Coast United), Dylan McGowan (Hearts), Petar Franjic, Kliment Taseski (Melbourne Victory), Benjamin Kantarovski, Robbie Kolak, James Virgili (Newcastle Jets), Jason Davidson (Pacos de Ferreira), Karem Bulut, Kofi Danning, Sam Gallagher, Rhyan Grant and Dimitrios Petratos (Sydney FC).\n\n26.10.2009\n\nFAIREST AND BEST AWARD HAS BOWYER STUMPED\n\nArmadale captain Andy Bowyer is still coming to terms with being named his club's Fairest and Best player of 2009. \"To be honest I'm shocked at receiving the 'Fairest and Best' because the name itself does not represent the player that I am,\" he commented. \"I struggled to come to terms with the new FIFA ruling of no swearing on the pitch. I was penalised for it early on in the season and from there it escalated and before you know it I had three red cards and spent seven games on the sidelines, hence why I should not have won the Fairest and Best award. If the award was renamed the \"Go out there, wrap your sleeves up and put your body on the line for Armadale\" award then I wouldn't have been so surprised.\"\n\nEven so, Bowyer says he'll cherish his first Fairest and Best win. \"I am honoured as it is the fans and committee members who pick the award so they obviously believe in me as much as I believe in the club ... and for that reason alone I feel that I have to play on next year,\" said 34-year old Bowyer. \"Armadale is too good a club to be fighting relegation and the quality of 'the boozer' (Brad Hassell) as coach is recognised by all. We just need a few more players who are going to put their hands up to win the \"Go out there, wrap your sleeves up and put your body on the line for Armadale\" award. And I owe the club a season of discipline and if that can be accompanied with a team of fighters, then look out league - Armadale are on the move!\"\n\n25.10.2009\n\nSAMMUT SIGNS WITH SWAN\n\nPaul Lincoln has strengthened his squad for 2010 with the recruitment of former Perth Glory Youth player James Sammut. The talented midfielder, who has played locally with Inglewood United, Floreat Athena and ECU Joondalup, has agreed terms on a two-year deal having been top of Lincolns wanted list. James is a player Ive been trying to sign for a while, explained the Swan United coach. He has a great engine and has a great football brain. Were delighted he chose to come to Francis Street and he is the first of a number of new faces we are hoping to get to the club for next season.\n\nEstablishing himself in a new home is a challenge Sammut is looking forward to. Ive spoken to Lincs on a few occasions and he showed a great deal of interest on getting me down at the club, said the youngster. Ive heard a lot of good things about the club and know a few of the lads that are playing there. The club has a good future ahead of them and hopefully I can bring something to the team. Paul has spoken to me about the way he wants his side to play football and they are very similar to the style of game I like to play.\n\nSwan surprised many last season and Sammut is keen to take the successes of 2009 and build on them. Swan played some good football the style of football Lincs wants his team to play is how I enjoy playing so hopefully my attacking game will fit in well, he said. Just talking to Lincs you can tell he has a good understanding of the game. Im a player who likes to get on the ball and play football which Lincs wants his team to do so I think I will fit right in. Hopefully next season I can get back to scoring goals and make 2010 the best season I have had.\n\nLast season was one of frustration for Sammut who failed to make an impact at Floreat before a mid-season move to Joondalup. Obviously last year was very disappointing for me. At Floreat it was difficult not getting a lot of game time with not doing any of the pre-season because of Glory commitments and then making the move to ECU, he said. That move was one that I needed to make because I needed to be getting game time I just wanted to enjoy the second half of the season with ECU and starting getting back to playing the good football I know I can.\n\n25.10.2009\n\nMICEVSKI PUTS KNIGHTS INTO GRAND FINAL\n\nWestern Knights captain David Micevski turned in a best on ground display to lead his team to a 2-1 victory over Floreat Athena on a windy afternoon at Nash Field. Micevski scored one goal and laid on the other for Anthony Campbell as the Knights set up a date with Perth SC in next weekends Flexible Signage Solutions Grand Final. Coach Paul Price had nothing but praise for this his teams performance after the game, but hailed the performance of his captain in particular. David Micevski played his best game of the season today, he said. But I dont want to single anybody out because the whole team played well.\n\nThe opening exchanges produced little in terms of chances on goal as the teams sounded each other out on a poor quality surface. Floreat created the first opening after 13 minutes when John Migas deflected drive forced Frazer Siddall into saving well down low. It took only a minute for the hosts to reply via a David Micevski free-kick that curled just beyond the far post. Migas should have put his side ahead when he charged through on the quarter hour but the midfielders lob was weak and far too close to the goalkeeper. The action soon switched to the opposite end where Daniel Trims firm header flashed wide from Daniel Micevskis cross.\n\nAdam Bachillers under hit back pass let in Anthony Campbell but thankfully Alex Dun was alert, however, the keepers clearance was straight to David Micevski who was denied a shot on goal but the Floreat defence. Jason Barrera slammed a half-volley over the crossbar on 34 minutes and shortly after Migas driving run was illegally halted by David Micevski, who became the first player in the referees book. The Knights should have taken the lead five minutes out from half-time when Campbell shook off his marker and squared to Daniel Trim, who in turn laid the ball into the path of David Micevski but his effort was deflected wide.\n\nThe tempo was taken up a notch for the second half as Barry Devlins free-kick from distance rattled the Floreat bar. Daniel Neiderberger then played in for Branimir Mikulic but after rounding Siddall the attacker was pulled up for offside. The Knights hit the front on 53 minutes, David Micevski beating two opponents in making his way down the right from where he delivered a fine low cross which Campbell turned into the net at the front post. This triggered a lengthy period of pressure from Floreat, however, the visitors failed to create many clear-cut chances. Barrera fired over after a strong run by Mikulic, who not long after had a cross plucked off his head by Siddall.\n\nThere was not such wastage from David Micevski who, on 76 minutes, Micevski fired the ball wide of Dunn from the edge of the area after Floreat failed to sufficiently deal with a Daniel Micevski cross in from the right. Floreat werent about to let their season end without a fight and five minutes later Neiderbergers shot was parried by Siddall with Mikulic reacting quickest to head in from close-range. This set up a tense final ten minutes but the closest Floreat would come to adding a second was a weak Mirco shot that was gratefully scooped up by Siddall. Despite some red-hot pressure, the Knights defence held firm until David Costellos final whistle signalled the start of celebrations.\n\n24.10.2009\n\nANOTHER PAINFUL AWAY LOSS FOR GLORY\n\nNorth Queensland Fury have put their goal scoring problems behind them and secured a first home A-League win by defeating Perth Glory 2-1 at Dairy Farmers Stadium. The early signs were positive for Glory with Victor Sikora slotting in midway through the first half. However, Robbie Fowlers quickly taken 65th minute free-kick brought the sides level with a stunning effort six minutes later from Dyron Daal securing the home team victory. I think it has been building (the win), I said before that North Queensland have be looking very good at home and tonight they played very well and deserved to win, said Glory boss David Mitchell. It was disappointing to have a one-nil lead and then conceded a goal off a free-kick. They deserved to win, they fought well and had a quite a few players missing from their team and they came at us and caused all sorts of problems.\n\nGlory sounded their intentions in the 4th minute when Branko Jelics diving header smacked into the crossbar on the end of a flowing move that featured Victor Sikora, Adriano Pellegrino and Todd Howarth. With that lucky escape behind them, Fury lifted the tempo and on the quarter hour James Robinson found Fowler but his powerful long-range attempt was high. Against the run of play Glory took the lead on 24 minutes, Howarths long ball down the left appeared to have gone out of play when Jelic exploded past John Tambouras to whip in a cross which Sikora stroked into the net at close-range. The home side almost drew level on 33 minutes with Jason Spagnuolo sending in a cross to James Robinson, whose desperate shot bounced over the bar. And shortly after Chris Tadrosse delivered the ball to an unmarked David Williams but the youngster headed wide when well placed.\n\nThe home side were out quickly for the second half, Ufak Talay sending a free-kick straight at Tando Velapi and minutes later Robinson flashed wide from distance. Glory went close on the hour, Jelic cutting in from the right but shooting wide, and a few minutes later the Serbians volley from 5-metres was narrowly over the bar. Chris Coynes foul on Robinson presented Fury with a free-kick on top of the 18-yard box, and with Glory lining up their wall Fowler drilled in the equaliser. Fury then took the lead via Daal who, after being found by Fowler, twisted and turned away from two defenders before unleashing a powerful drive into the top corner. The final margin could have been greater but Jeremy Brockie curled past the post.\n\n24.10.2009\n\nVITTIGLIA BRILLIANCE SECURES GLORY\n\nA stoppage time strike by returning midfielder Reece Vittiglia earned Perth Glory Youth a nail-biting 4-3 win against the Australian Institute of Sport at McKellar Park in Canberra. The three points gained moves Glory into fourth on a congested Youth League table, much to the delight of captain Steve Hesketh. It was good performance from the side today and to come back from two-nil down to win showed the side has great character, said Hesketh. It was a case of deja vu as we did the same against the AIS earlier in the season. Its great to get Reece Vittiglia back today from injury and he popped up late with the winner so it made the flight home a little more enjoyable.\n\nThe AIS and Glory both pressed early on but found the opposing defensive lines held the upper hand. The hosts got the breakthrough in the 16th minute when Eli Babalj fired into the net from a tight angle after goalkeeper Alex Pearson had blocked his initial effort. The former Stirling Lions striker added his and the teams second just two minutes later by heading in a well-flighted John Martinoski cross. Play was pretty much one-way with the AIS, looking for their first victory of the season, pilling on the pressure and if not for Pearson they would have had a third goal in the 26th minute. Glory came back into the contest late in the half, however, they were unable to find the back of the net before the half-time whistle blew.\n\nGlory opened the second period determined to reel in the deficit, and after a prolonged period in control thats exactly what they did. Cameron Edwards brought the difference back to a single goal by converting at a 66th minute corner, and a couple of minutes later set-up the equaliser struck by Josh Risdon. The home side hit back with John Matrinovski curling in a free-kick from the edge of the 18-yard box after 75 minutes. With eleven minutes to play Ludovic Boi intercepted a poor back pass by Nikola Stanojevic before applying a clinical finish to restore parity. The decider arrived three minutes into stoppage time when Glen Trifiros pass sent clear Vittiglia, who manoeuvred his way through traffic and struck a final blow into the heart of the AIS.\n\n24.10.2009\n\nGLORY WOMEN JUMP TO THIRD\n\nSam Kerr came off the bench to inspired Perth Glory Women into joint third on the W-League table courtesy of a tight 1-0 victory over Adelaide United at Hindmarsh Stadium. The visitors were indebted to goalkeeper Emma Wirkus and some terrific defending by Dani Calautti and Sadie Lawrence as the home team dominated the opening passages. Kerr made her entry as a 31st minute replacement for Lisa De Vanna and was immediately in the thick of the action, dancing past Ebony Weidenbach to go one-on-one with goalkeeper Sian McLaren who made the save.\n\nThe second half was only three minutes old when Kerrs bouncing cross was sent into the roof of the net by American import Alex Singer from 7-metres. Elisa DOvidio almost doubled Glorys lead minutes later but her effort from the top of the 18-yard box crashed off the crossbar. Rachael Quigley was lively up front for the home side and in the 58th minute sent the ball goalward only to have Calautti clear off the line. Kerr was at the heart of Glorys better attacking moves but three times was prevented from adding her name to the scoresheet in one-on-one situations with McLaren. DOvidio also went close on a handful of occasions as Glory sought to finish the day with a few more goals to their credit.\n\n24.10.2009\n\nGARCIA PATIENT OVER PREMIER RETURN\n\nHull City midfielder Richard Garcia is hoping to force his way back into first team contention after a successful return in the reserves. But the 28-year old Socceroo accepts he still has some way to go and says he would be happy to secure a Premier League recall within the month. Garcia's versatility ensured he played a key role in the Tigers' first top flight season, making 23 appearances in total, but hasn't featured at all this term after rupturing knee ligaments weeks out from the start of the new campaign. He took the first steps on the road to recovery with a 60 minute run out for Hull's second string in the 2-1 defeat at Wigan Athletic last week.\n\nWith World Cup selection to play for, Garcia is reluctant to rush back into the first team until he knows his knee is 100%. \"Hopefully I'm not too far off and I'd say within the next month,\" he told sporthull.co.uk. \"I'm saying a month as although I feel I can play now, it's one of those thing that you have to be a bit careful with. I have to make sure I'm fully fit and don't pull a hamstring or anything that will put me out for longer. It's good to get some playing time under my belt. Hopefully I'll be available for selection sooner rather than later. If I'm called upon, I'm more than happy to give whatever I've got but I'm still trying to work my way back into it and slowly build up to 90 minutes.\"\n\n24.10.2009\n\nWILLIAMS EYES VICTORY\n\nMatildas goalkeeper Lydia Williams and Melissa Barbieri will be at opposite ends of the park this afternoon when Canberra United hosts Melbourne Victory. The pair will battle for superiority as both look to be Australias first choice with a number of important international fixtures on the horizon. Every game we go up against each other theres a point to prove and a little bit more individual competition rather than a team competition so Im really excited to play against her, Williams told Chris Gottaas of canberraunited.com.au\n\nLast season it was Williams who claimed the honours in both encounters with Canberra defeating Melbourne 1-0 away followed by a thrilling 4-3 home win. But previous encounters will mean little though as Melbourne go into the match in good form whereas Canberra are still looking for their first win of the campaign. I think were pretty desperate for a win this weekend, Williams said. Melbourne is going to be a really tough game so to get a win against them will really boost our confidence for the rest of the season.\n\n23.10.2009\n\nFLOREAT OUT TO END THE KNIGHTS CHARGE\n\nWestern Knights v Floreat Athena (Referee: David Costello)\n\nThe season goes on the line for Western Knights and Floreat Athena when they meet in Saturday's Flexible Signage Solutions Preliminary Final at Nash Field (3.00pm). To the victors will go a Grand Final showdown with Perth SC next weekend, however, for the vanquished it'll be mothballs and time to start planning in earnest for 2010. The two sides have met on three previous occasions this year with the Knights holding the balance of power two-one. Floreat snatched a 2-1 semi-final Night Series win, however, both regular season fixtures ended in the Knights favour, 3-1 at Nash Field in Round Four with August's return match being 3-1.\n\nWhile midfield maestro David Micevski has been the standout performer this season, Paul Price's team have major strengths all over the park. David Annall and summer recruit Frazer Siddall are at the heart of the State League's tightest defensive unit, Daniel Micevski and Cormac Dawson are constant threats out wide in providing an endless supply of ammunition for import striker Anthony Campbell. The Knights are as near to full strength as possible with David Price and Mario Marcinko, whose contributions were vital to their regular season success, the only absences due to Perth Glory Youth commitments.\n\nThe Knights went down at home to Perth SC last week with goalkeeper Siddall contributing his teams rusty performance to a lengthy lay-off. \"Not playing as a squad for three weeks, and as a full team for five weeks turned out to be a disadvantage for us,\" he said. \"The break caused us to lose the match sharpness we've had all season - you can't keep match sharp only by training, you need to be playing at a high level each week. The lads have come to training this week with the bad taste of defeat in our mouths, we all hate losing with a passion and that makes us want all the more to win on Saturday.\"\n\nSiddall says his team's strong record against Floreat this year means very little in the context of finals football. \"It's true we have a good record against Floreat this season but on Saturday past results count for nothing. Both teams are very even and the games between the two clubs this year could have gone either way,\" said Siddall, who is already plotting the downfall of Perth in the season finale. \"It's going to be a very entertaining game on Saturday and, hopefully, we'll come out on top and get the opportunity for revenge on Perth in the Grand Final.\"\n\nFloreat boast one of the strongest squads on the local stage. Branimir Mikulic, Daniel Neiderberger and Johnny Mirco have shown themselves capable of winning games off their own boot with great support from Jason Barrera, John Migas and Dean Apelgren. While Miki Vujacic and Jovo Pavlovic come back into the squad, coach Michael Roki is without the services of Josip Madgic (foot), Callum Roberts (shoulder) and Miro Akeksic (returned to Serbia) while former New Zealand international Brad Scott remains doubtful with an ankle injury.\n\nIt's been an intense week of rehab at Floreat after enduring 120 minutes played in stifling 37-degree temperatures before seeing off Mandurah City. \"It was pretty heartbreaking when we lost to Perth in extra-time (a fortnight ago) and when it went to extra-time against Mandurah we knew we had that little bit more in the tank,\" said Alex Dunn. \"We had a thin squad that day due to some of the boys having other commitments and we didn't falter even through Mandurah pushed us for 120 minutes. And it was great to see David Foster get the winner because it shows the sort of quality we have coming off the bench.\"\n\nDunn readily acknowledges the psychological advantage the Knights hold going into Saturday's game but feels the time is right for Floreat to turn the tables. \"The Knights have had a great season - they're solid defensively and scoring at will with David Micevski pulling the strings in midfield,\" commented the Floreat 'keeper. \"They definitely have the wood over us this year but we're confident and playing some really good football at the moment. We know we can play 120 minutes in really hard conditions if needed, and we are read for nothing less than a real battle.\"\n\n23.10.2009\n\nSELECTION DILEMMAS FOR MITCHELL (courtesy Perth Glory)\n\nYou wont hear too many complaints from David Mitchell over current dilemma. The Perth Glory coach has been wrestling with a variety of combinations available to him plus the expected addition of striker Mile Sterjovski leading into Saturdays A-League showdown with North Queensland Fury. There are options for this game and were looking at a few scenarios which we think can turn the outcome in our favour, thats what selection time is all about, said Mitchell, who was pleased with his teams second half against Gold Coast United last weekend. The boys that came in last week have done well and we have good players who are vying for a spot, there is a bit of selection headache but that is a good thing and it is healthy to have that competition in the squad.\n\n19-year old attacker Howard Fondyke has been rewarded for some outstanding performances with Glory Youth by being added to Mitchells extended match day squad. Glory has enjoyed an ideal preparation for their game against Fury by staying on the east coast rather than fly to and from Queensland twice in a week. The players have enjoyed it and with everyone together in the same place weve been able to go through things in depth and theyre all looking forward to the challenge this week, Mitchell said. I was really pleased with our second half last week and will be looking for another performance like that over the 90 minutes against the Fury. Itll be a tough game, I dont think North Queensland has been getting their just rewards from their performances and theyre due a win, so well be doing everything to make sure it doesnt come at our expense.\n\n23.10.2009\n\nBOOST FOR GLORY YOUNG GUNS (courtesy Perth Glory)\n\nPerth Glory Youth will finally start to resemble the side Gareth Naven had planned with the injury hampered side welcoming back five players for Saturdays clash against the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. Glory was without eleven of their sixteen contracted players last weekend, leaving the side desperately short on numbers. Despite drafting in replacements they were forced to play Gold Coast United with just one outfield substitute on the bench.\n\nSaturdays match though is a different proposition with experienced pair Dean Evans and Reece Vittiglia returning alongside Australian representative Cameron Edwards, while rookies Sam Mitchinson and Josh Risdon came in for their first games of the season. Anthony Skorich, now a senior listed player, is also set to take to the field after shaking off a long run of injuries that has plagued him since playing a starring role for the youngsters in their 2008/09 campaign.\n\nGlory Youth physiotherapist, Sarah Cunningham, is delighted the majority of the side are again ready for action. We have been careful in managing their recovery and, if anything, we have been more cautious because we want to ensure they dont suffer any relapse, said Cunningham. Our primary concern is to get them healthy and give them the best opportunity to spend as much time as they can on the pitch. Glory Youth followers can tune in to 990am Information Radio from 12.00noon tomorrow for Ashley Morrisons play-by-play account of the AIS fixture.\n\n23.10.2009\n\nWOMEN ON THE HUNT FOR THREE POINTS (courtesy Perth Glory)\n\nPerth Glory Women are in the national spotlight this Saturday when victory over Adelaide United could propel them to within striking distance of the finals. Glory Women are currently fifth but only two points outside the top four. It is a must win for us this weekend, we want to continue our recent form, play a solid ninety minutes and its a game that we go into really wanting to win said coach John Gibson. We were disappointed to drop two points last week (against Canberra United), it was one of our best performances for the year, our first half was outstanding. We had a few lapses of concentration in the second half and that cost us.\n\nAlthough exciting teenager Sam Kerr returns from international duty, Gibson says its no guarantee shell play. We have a pretty settled line up this week, Sam (Kerr) is back into the squad after her international duties but overall we should be very, very similar in squad composition to the Canberra game Gibson added. We will assess tomorrow when we get to Adelaide and see how Sam has pulled up and how she goes in training. She has done a fair bit of travelling recently so we dont want to push her too hard ... Whenever she comes on she makes a positive difference to the team.\n\nGibson realises that in a short ten-game season, each win is crucial in the teams finals aspirations. After this week we are half way through the season. It is a must win game, and going into the next few weeks, the games will get tougher so we need to capitalise this weekend. Most of the Adelaide squad are home grown and very similar to us so it should be a great game he said. Home town fans can watch Glory Womens game with Adelaide tomorrow from 3.00pm on ABC 1.\n\n22.10.2009\n\nMAKAROUNAS FIRES FOR NATIONAL TEAM\n\nA series of sparkling performances for the national youth side has served to underline how much teenager Jessie Makarounas has to offer Australian football. The 15-year old striker scored three goals in four games last week as the Joeys swept through qualifiers for next years AFC Under-16 Championship unbeaten. I was very happy with the way I played in Canberra, commented Makarounas, Australias joint top goal scorer at the qualifying tournament. I feel I played well in every game, I helped my team by scoring a few goals and also setting up a few more.\n\nMakarounas is understandably over the moon at having played his first recognised game for Australia, having previously lined-up in a practice match with the Japan Under-15s in April. It felt amazing to pull on the green and gold shirt for the first time, it gave me a terrific sense of achievement knowing that I was representing my country in the sport I love, he said. And Im thrilled to have scored my first three goals for Australia. I hope I get the chance to play and score a few more for my country in the future.\n\nAustralia completing the Group H qualifiers in Canberra without loss to book a spot at the 2010 AFC Under-16 Championship. The team played some very good football during the tournament, said Makarounas. Over the past year weve been travelling to Canberra for training camps and I believe all the hard work showed in the way the team performed. We controlled and dictated both games against Laos, but found it a bit harder against Malaysia as they were pressing us and not giving us much time on the ball.\n\nHaving done his bit to get Australia to the finals tournament, Makarounas is now more determined than ever to press on and take his development to the next level. For the next twelve months I plan to keep working and training hard to improve myself in every aspect of my game, said Makarounas, who honed his considerable skills with the National Training Centre over the winter months. Im waiting to hear whether Ill be offered a scholarship with the Australian Institute of Sport and, hopefully, Ill get the chance to move there and be in a 24/7 football environment.\n\n22.10.2009\n\nHOWARTH TAKES HIS CHANCE\n\nTodd Howarth says he's determined to take any chance that comes his way as Perth Glory strives to qualify for their first A-League finals. Despite playing in just his eighth national league game, the former Perth SC player demonstrated his quality last weekend by slotting in his first goal at the top level, firing home a 54th minute equaliser against Gold Coast United. And while it was only a temporary reprieve - Gold Coast reclaimed the lead inside a minute of the restart - but for many it was conclusive evidence Howarth belonged at this level.\n\nAnd there appears plenty more in store from Howarth as he looks to make the best of an opportunity he thought had passed him by. \"I'd had a few trials with the Glory a few years before and that didn't work out,\" said Howarth from the club's temporary base on the Gold Coast. \"I was always hoping they'd come knocking at my door again (but) I thought my chance had passed me by, so I went overseas for a couple of years and had a bit of a break from football and then came back and got into it. I just pretty much concentrated on the game and played State League and the opportunity came up and I knew that if I was ever given a chance, it only comes around once in a lifetime, I thought I would be stupid if I said no to it.\"\n\nHowever, when opportunity did come knocking there were still some issues to be deal with such as Howarth leaving his day job and Glory squeezing him in under the salary cap. \"The weeks leading up to it were a bit iffy, because of the salary cap and we had some pretty good players coming into the team and they came in quite late so I was notified quite late that I'd be signed,\" Howarth said. \"It took me a few weeks to get up to speed (but) I suppose I've got a few minutes under my belt and got a little bit more confident and things are going okay now. I'm just pleased that it worked out well because it sort of looked like I wouldn't get in there.\"\n\n22.10.2009\n\nSOCCEROO EXPERIENCE TO BOLSTER WOMEN (courtesy Football West)\n\nShaun Murphy has been confirmed as assistant coach to Perth Glory Women for the remainder of the 2009 W-League season. Murphy played over 400 games during a decade-plus career with Notts County, West Bromwich Albion, Sheffield United, Crystal Palace and Perth Glory, who he captained to Grand Final victory in 2003/04. \"I've known (head coach) John (Gibson) for quite a number of years, we went to the AIS together and he was looking for an assistant, and I'm not doing much at the moment so have decided to get on board,\" said the former Socceroos defender. \"I have been looking to do some real coaching. I haven't been doing a lot of hands on coaching in the men's game, so John has promised some hands on coaching opportunities which I am really looking forward to.\"\n\nDespite not having experience in the women's game, Murphy is excited at having the opportunity to positively impact Glory players and the W-League as a whole. \"I haven't been involved with the women's game at all previously, but I like what I see so far, the girls want to learn,\" said Murphy. \"The women's league is in its infancy, it's only the second season so hopefully I can impart a bit of my experience on the girls and help to improve the league and get it on a par with some of the other women's leagues such as the US and Swedish leagues. I think realistically we have got to try and make the top four this season, which would be a massive step forward after last season.\"\n\n22.10.2009\n\nMITCHELL STANDS BY NEVILLE\n\nPerth Glory coach David Mitchell will keep faith in his remodelled defence for Saturday's away game with bottom-of-the-table North Queensland Fury. Young defender Scott Neville was included in the starting line-up against Gold Coast United last Sunday in the absence of the suspended Andy Todd, but played an unfortunate role in the 2-1 defeat. The former Sorrento player put the ball in his own net for Gold Coast's opener after 12 minutes and his collision with fellow defender Jamie Coyne after 56 minutes allowed Shane Smeltz to score the decisive goal.\n\nMitchell said the spirit among the squad had been good despite the defeat. He reiterated his view that Neville was a \"fantastic talent\" and said the 20-year old would learn from his mistakes. \"There were really just unfortunate errors that happened and from a coaching point of view, it's just a communication thing with the players,\" he told Dale Miller of the 'West Australian'. \"There's nothing fundamentally wrong. I'm pretty happy with the way we played and like I said, I'm just disappointed with the outcome.\"\n\nFormer Socceroo Shaun Murphy delivered a vote of confidence in Glory's defence, labelling it as the key to their A-League title hopes. \"Glory have got firepower up front and you just know if they hang on in games where they're defending well, they'll pinch things,\" Murphy said. \"I think Andy Todd has been a big plus for them. I think Chris Coyne is probably finding his feet a little bit, but he'll be a really good player for them as well and I can't see them conceding too many goals.\"\n\nSaturday's game with North Queensland looms as a crucial fixture for fourth-placed Glory with Mitchell warning his players not to take their hosts lightly. \"The situation is that everyone says we're playing the bottom team, but they're due a win,\" Mitchell said. \"They're a tough team with the conditions starting to heat up up there. They've been very, very unlucky with some of their results and this'll be a very, very tough game for us. It's by no means a foregone conclusion.\"\n\n21.10.2009\n\nCANNING VIBES RIGHT FOR RUSSELL\n\nA couple of years out of the coaching spotlight have done nothing to dim Billy Russells enthusiasm for the game. Russell says the sense of belonging he experienced during discussions with newly demoted Canning City played a big part in him taking on the senior coaching position for 2010. After a meeting with the Canning president, Malcolm Watson, I have a similar feeling to when I joined Armadale - the club was filled with nice people and there was a good atmosphere about the place, commented Russell, who selected Tom Kilkelly as his assistant. Its good to be involved again, both Tom and myself will give our all for this club.\n\nWhile Cannings inaugural season in the Premier League didnt go quite as the club had planned, several players proved themselves more than capable of matching it with the best the State League has to offer. As such, Russell accepts that the squad hell work with next year may be considerably different to that he inherited from out-going coach Frank Longstaff. I think we will lose some players to Premier League clubs but we have already started asking players down, explained Russell. There are also some good young players at the club whore looking forward to working with and progressing to the first team.\n\nRussell is looking forward to his new job after a spell as Stuart Curries assistant at Mandurah City. I spent last two years at Mandurah as assistant and - being honest - it didnt suit me 100%. Through no fault of Stus, it seemed something happened every week and we spent more time in the board room than the training ground, said Russell, who in 1987 moved from Glasgow to Perth. His coaching successes include guiding Rockingham City (1999) and Armadale (2004) into the Premier League, at which level hes coached Cockburn City and Armadale.\n\n21.10.2009\n\nSUBIACO OVAL TOO SMALL FOR WORLD CUP SEMIS\n\nFootball Federation Australia is warning that Perth will have no chance of hosting a World Cup semi-final unless the State Government urgently commits to significantly increasing Subiaco Oval's capacity. The sports national body is demanding the Government confirm its plans for Subiaco Oval in the next few weeks to help finalise a \"bidding agreement\" by the 11 December deadline set by FIFA. The FFA's demands increase pressure on Premier Colin Barnett to either resurrect the Carpenter government's plan for a new $1.1 billion multi-purpose stadium or embrace the WA Football Commission's Subiaco Oval \"rebuild\" option which would cost about $300 million.\n\nAustralia is among ten nations bidding for the rights to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cup but the $45 million bid needs considerable co-operation from the States to comply with FIFA's venue requirements. It is understood FFA chief executive Ben Buckley is seeking urgent talks with Barnett to settle issues surrounding the Perth venue which, because of the time zone, may be an attractive place to host high-profile games. Under FIFA's rules World Cup group games must be played in stadiums with a capacity of at least 44,000, and to be in the reckoning for a semi-final game the venue must hold 60,000 fans. Subiaco Oval's maximum capacity is 43,000 with its yet-to-be-finalised redevelopment plans likely to take it to 50,000.\n\n21.10.2009\n\nSCALI, COLE SHARE TOP HONOURS AT SWAN\n\nSwan United legend Damian Scali has bowed out of football by sharing his clubs Fairest and Best award with defensive mainstay Aaron Cole. It really was a night to remember for Scali, the veteran picking up his fifth successive and club record ninth Golden Boot trophy before finishing level with Cole in the club's highest individual award. \"Sharing the trophy with the icon of Swan is an honour and privilege that I will always treasure,\" commented Cole, who became first player in Swan history to win the award two years in a row. \"Winning any Fairest and Best is great but to do it back-to-back makes it even more special for me.\" The trophy as Reserve team Fairest and Best player was won by defensive mainstay Ben Lees. It was a three-way tie for Runner-Up Fairest and Best between Matt Wood, Andrea Terni and Niall Hughes, that latter also going home with the Golden Boot. Dara McNally collected the Youth team Fairest and Best ahead of Tim Hill.\n\n21.10.2009\n\nMITCHELL DISMISSIVE OF FRICTION SUGGESTIONS\n\nDavid Mitchell has denied there's bad blood between midfielders Jacob Burns and Victor Sikora after the pair argued during Perth Glory's weekend loss to Gold Coast United. Burns ran over to Mitchell on the sideline asking for Sikora to be taken off just before half-time after the Glory captain was forced to mop up a mistake by the former Dutch international. But Mitchell said Burns' merely over-reacted to the error, saying there were no issues between the players off the pitch. \"That's a heat of the moment scenario but nothing to do with how Victor was playing,\" said Mitchell from the club's temporary base on the Gold Coast this week. \"I think it was a situation where Jacob had to make a long run because Victor let a ball run through his legs and then Jacob had to run 70 metres and he was frustrated. He was just a bit annoyed (but) next time it could be Victor shouting at Jacob. When someone doesn't do something when they expect them to do it, they get on their back.\"\n\n20.10.2009\n\nMUSEUM GETS NORMANTONS BLESSING\n\nWestern Australias most successful coach, Graham Normanton, is a strong supporter of the Football Hall of Fames push to establish a Football Museum. Its a marvelous idea - and something, I believe, is long overdue, Normanton said in the the Fame Game Issue 7 (pdf, 656kb). The Committee of the Hall of Fame have to be commended for what they have done to help preserve the history of the game in WA. But that now needs to go a step further. Football is part of the heritage of this State. It reflects the immigration and deserves to be showcased. Establishing a Museum is certainly something that would get my full backing. Normantons record of winning seventeen trophies during a decade as coach of Perth SC were saluted with entry into the Hall of Recognition at last years Football Hall of Fame induction ceremony.\n\n20.10.2009\n\nGONZALES NAMED BAYSWATERS BEST\n\nColumbian import Cesar Gonzales has marked his first winter in Perth by winning Bayswater Citys Fairest and Best player award. Gonzales made his Bayswater debut in round seven and near no time at all had cemented his place in the line-up. Midfielder Paul Hickey came in as Runner-Up Fairest and Best with Damir Kuduzovic collecting the Coaches Award. Andy Reale was awarded the Reserve team Reserves Fairest and Best ahead of Josh Pirone, and the Coaches Award went home with Alex Duncan. The Youth team Fairest and Best was presented to Amer Kujovic, Jordan Mitasch came in Runner-Up and Blaise Pillera collected the Coaches Award.\n\n20.10.2009\n\nVALE MAL BROWN\n\nMal Brown, one of state's most accomplished and respected coaches, passed away yesterday at the age of 79. Born in Scotland, Brown arrived in Western Australia in the late 1960's and within a few years had taken on the role of State Director of Coaching. He commenced what would be a two-year spell as coach of Perth Azzurri in 1973, winning the Night Series and D'Orsogna Cup in his first year and guiding the side to second in the Premier League twelve months later. Brown later coached Kingsway Olympic, Cracovia and Inglewood Kiev as well as the State Under-18 team. In 1998 he was awarded the WA Junior Coach of the Year, and in 2008 was inducted into the Football Hall of Fame Western Australia.\n\n19.10.2009\n\nDYSON SCOOPS ROCKINGHAM'S POOL\n\nDefender Danny Dyson went home a happy man from Rockingham City's annual presentation evening at Golden Ponds Function Centre in Baldivis. Dyson picked up his club's highest individual honour, the Player of the Year, and was also voted the Players' Player of the Year by his peers. Summer signing Peter Kuzet was runner-up in th main award, Ryan Stewart collected the Coaches Player of the Year and Tom Downes the Shield Award. The trophy as Reserve team Player of the Year went to Cameron Harvey, who also received the Players' Player of the Year. Runner-Up Player of the Year was Jake Murray with the Coaches Player of the Year presented to Liam Harvey. The Youth team trophies were shared between Elliott Jones (Player of the Year), Brad Burton (Runner-Up Player of the Year), Brad Lewis (Players' Player of the Year) and Hilario Nunes (Coaches Player of the Year).\n\n19.10.2009\n\nTOMBIDES SCORES ON WEST HAM DEBUT\n\nTeenager Dylan Tombides made a stunning debut for West Ham Uniteds Under-18 side by getting on the scoresheet in the 2-0 FA Premier League win over Portsmouth on Saturday. Tombides, 15 and the son of former Kingsway Olympic player Jim Tombides, had been in red-hot form for the Hammers Under-16 team and made the most of his first start at the next level. Were going to blood a young schoolboy who has done very well for us, said coach Tony Carr prior to the game of Dylan. Hes a striker and is not 16 till March, hes had a couple of sub appearances so this will be his first start. Weve had a few injuries so its an opportunity for Dylan to show us what he can do.\n\nTombides started out as a junior at Wembley Downs and played academy football at Stirling Lions and Perth SC prior to taking up trials with West Ham in 2008. What an amazing start to young Dylans career at West Ham, said Stirling president Don Evans. His parents, Jim and Tracy Lee, are so proud of their son as our club is of this first big and important step in Dylans dream for a pro league contract. It proves that the local talent in WA can mix it in one of the best leagues in the world and we hope Dylan is the tip of the development iceberg for the Stirling Lions youth development focus.\n\nThe name Tombides is synonymous with football in this state, the family heavily involved in the game since the formation of the Western Australian Soccer Federation in 1960. Peter Tombides, Dylans grandfather, was a prolific goal scorer in the 1950s and 1960s with Olympic Macedonia while his father, Jim, was also handy at finding the back of the net at Olympic Kingsway. Steve and Paul Tombides, uncles to Dylan, were part of the powerful Kingsway side that won two State League titles and two Night Series trophies in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\n19.10.2009\n\nSTERJOVSKI SET TO RETURN\n\nPerth Glory coach David Mitchell expects to welcome back Mile Sterjovski for this Saturday's away game with North Queensland Fury after the marquee player missed yesterday's 2-1 setback at Gold Coast United. The Socceroos international pulled out of the game just hours before kick-off after succumbing to a leg injury picked up the previous week against Adelaide United. \"Mile trained the day before the game and did well but woke up on Sunday feeling sore and we thought it best not to push it for this game,\" Mitchell said. \"Mile knows his body better than any one else and felt that he'd be able to shake off the knock but on Sunday morning we spoke about it together and decided not to risk it. Mile didn't want to start the game and after twenty minutes have to be replaced if he was hurting because that would disrupt our flow during the game. He is a team man and wanted what was best for his team mates.\" Glory will stay on the east coast this week as they look to get their finals push back on track after yesterday's loss.\n\n19.10.2009\n\nGOLD COAST GO TOP AFTER CONTROVERSIALLY DOWNING GLORY\n\nA fortunate Gold Coast United moved to the top of the A-League ladder with a 2-1 win over a spirited but luckless Perth Glory at Skilled Park. Glory had every reason to feel robbed of at least a draw after striker Branko Jelic was denied a goal midway through the second half for what replays showed was an incorrect offside call. We got the (second half) goal we justly deserved and then a couple of decisions went against us that cost us the game, said Glory coach David Mitchell, who was critical of the decision. The linesman or referees are supposed to go in favour of the strikers - certainly when you are level, youre onside - but I think theres a lot of grey mist with decisions with offside. I think FIFA or the FFA should come out and made a rule saying if there is clear daylight between the striker and the defender then youre offside because this level is confusing everyone.\n\nJelic should have put Glory ahead after just 90 seconds but failed make the most of a sweetly timed through ball from Adriano Pellegrino. It was a miss that was compounded in the 13th minute when a Jason Culina free-kick struck Scott Neville, stranding Tando Velaphi with the ball deflecting into the goalkeepers net. Glory didnt dwell too long on either event and remained very much in the game, although it did take until the second half for them to really get into rhythm with star striker Mile Sterjovski watching from the bench. The visitors best chance came shortly before the interval when Wayne Srhoj attempted to beat Jess Van Strattan at his near post when they better option would have been to shoot across the goalkeeper.\n\nGlory emerged from the break a different proposition but was left wondering what they had to do when referee Matthew Breeze ignored appeals for a penalty after Kristian Rees had dragged down Jelic. Their answer arrived on 55 minutes, Todd Howarth showing great poise in slotting under Van Strattan after being played into the box by Victor Sikora. However, Glory were again chasing the game just moments later when a collision between Jamie Coyne and Neville allowed Joel Porter to deliver a perfect cross which Smeltz netted at close-range. Jelic continue to threaten and on 67 minutes the striker tucked away the loose ball after Van Strattan spilled a shot at goal by Jamie Coyne only to be controversially ruled offside.\n\n18.10.2009\n\nDE FELICE SENDS PERTH INTO GRAND FINAL\n\nPerth SC became the first team through to the Flexible Signage Solutions Grand Final by defeating Western Knights 3-2 in today's Major Semi-Final at Nash Field. Blues midfielder Dom De Felice grabbed a brace to compliment Andrew Bourakis' opening goal in an entertaining match that went right down to the wire. Despite the loss, the Knights have another chance to make the Final after finishing top of the table in 2009 and they will take on Floreat Athena next weekend in the Preliminary Final.\n\nPerth were given the best possible start when, with 2 minutes on the clock, Bourakis clipped a delightful free-kick over the defensive wall and into the bottom corner, beyond the diving goalkeeper. The margin was very nearly doubled soon after as Okwy Diamondstar's mis-kick allowed in Phil Arnold, but having danced between two defenders he dragged across the face of goal. The Knights drew level in the 10th minute through David Micevski's well-flighted a corner into the 6-yard box which Anthony Campbell headed powerful into the net. Duuane Hepburn spurned a golden opportunity to put the Knights in front by failing to connect cleanly with a centring ball from the left by Campbell, giving Bourakis ample time to get back to concede the corner.\n\nThe Knights would pay dearly for that missed opportunity in the 22nd minute when a De Felice was permitted to drift into the area and arrow in his header from a deep Bourakis corner. Hepburn was guilty of wasting another good opening, blasting well high of the crossbar after skipping away from Trent Kay after he lost his footing. Perth posted their third goal in the 33rd minute, David Onoforo playing down the right to Matt Danskin who cleverly switched play to the opposite flank where Arnold nodded the ball back across the top of the area for an unmarked De Felice to sidefoot precisely in from 12-metres.\n\nAppeals for a legitimate Perth penalty were waved away by referee Paul Anderson after Onoforo appeared to be tripped by Annall shortly after the interval. Perth were eager to kill the game off with a fourth goal and Danskin's rasping drive was parried by Fraser Siddall, whose had his gloves stung again soon after by Arnold's effort from 16-metres. The Knights were also attacking at every opportunity, however, their preference for playing the ball long to Campbell and Hepburn did them no favours as it cut the creativity of David Micevski out of the game.\n\nEven so, the hosts did have claims for a penalty dismissed after Barry Devlin went down under Michael Icanovski, while David Micevski's shot in a congested area was deflected wide off defender. The Knights were eventually rewarded in the 79th minute when David Micevski's corner was cleared only as far as substitute Daniel Trim, who clipped the ball back to the top of the 6-yard box where Annall neatly headed past a flat-footed 'keeper. Craig Simpson came to the rescue when Luke Martino failed to take Trim's ball into the area, while late in the piece the young 'keeper punched a speculative long ball clear under pressure from Daniel Micevski.\n\n18.10.2009\n\nSUPER SUB KERR HELPS AUSTRALIA WIN CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nPerth Glory Women midfielder Sam Kerr scored twice as Australia clinched the ASEAN Football Federation Under-16 Women's Championship by thrashing Thailand 8-0 in this evenings final. \"I am very pleased with the team performance tonight and through the tournament,\" said coach Robbie Hooker upon conclusion of the tournament played in Yangon, Myanmar. \"I still think there are some things we need to work on including finishing, but it was a good result and valuable experience heading into the AFC Championships.\"\n\nThe Young Matildas made commanding start to their ASEAN Cup push, hitting six first half goals before plundering a further eight to whallopping the Philippines 14-0 on Saturday 10 October. Alanna Kennedy lead the way with four, substitute Caitlin Friend grabbed a hat-trick, there were two each for Teigen Allen and Heidi Markillos with Kerr, Ashlee Faul and Brittany Whitfield getting the remainder. Kerr played the first half before being replaced by Rebekah Stott.\n\nA place in the semi-finals was secured two days later when Australia overwhelmed Vietnam 5-0. Nicola Bolger's opportunistic strike after 18 minutes got the ball rolling and soon after Friend tore down the centre, side stepped a couple of defenders and lashed into the net. Foord was on target again on the half hour with early second half strikes from Brittany Whitfield and Friend sealing the win.\n\nDespite the hot conditions of a mid-afternoon start, Australia hit another twelve goals without reply in accounting for Myanmar 'B'. Faul scored twice with Allen and Whitfield also on the scoresheet to give the Young Matildas a handy four-goal half-time buffer. Makrillos then went on a goal-scoring spree, scoring five times in twenty minutes, before Whitfield completed her hat-trick and captain Hannah Brewer converted a penalty. Kerr watched the entire game from the bench as an unused substitute.\n\nThe Young Matildas were hardly troubled in defeating Myanmar 'A' 6-1 in the semi-finals. The scene was set early with Friend putting Australia ahead inside a minute, and Myanmar losing goalkeeper Zar Zar Myint to injury. To their credit, Myanmar conjured up an equaliser soon after but found themselves under pressure for lengthy periods before Kerr and Kennedy scored late in the half, with Tara Andrews, Whitfield and Emily Van Egmond netting after the break.\n\nAustralia's total dominance of this evening's final was underlined by the 8-0 winning scoreline over Thailand, who contested the first half strongly but fell of the pace after the interval. Whitfield scored the only goal of the first half and it wasn't until Foord netted in the 59th minute that the floodgates opened. Kerr came off the bench on the hour and scored twice in fifteen minutes, between which Makrillos netted the teams fourth. Foord picked up her second, Allen scoring directly from a corner before Van Egmond completed the scoring with the last kick of the game.\n\n18.10.2009\n\nSIBLING RIVALRY IN THE PAST FOR COYNE BOYS\n\nAfter growing up as the fiercest of rivals Chris and Jamie Coyne are now the best of friends. Having spent almost their entire careers on opposite sides of the world the brothers will on Sunday stand side by side. The pair were reunited at Perth Glory this season when older sibling Chris returned home from a 13-year career in the United Kingdom. Despite being a little more than two years between them, the pair never played in the same junior team, giving this season extra significance. \"We've always got on well as mates off the pitch and it's a good experience,\" Chris said. \"Once you cross that white line the nepotism goes out the window. It's just two players trying to do a good job.''\n\nA heated sibling rivalry played a significant part in firing the competitive instincts that have spurred both Coyne boys on during their professional careers. \"I think every time we went for a kick the ball got left over at the school or the park, because we ended up having a fight with each other and that was it,\" 28-year old Jamie told Braden Quartermaine of the 'Sunday Times' newspaper. \"There are a lot of similarities in our attitude. We're both very committed and very aggressive and we have a win at all costs attitude.\"\n\nBoth brothers credit their father John, who played for the Socceroos in the 1970s, as a big influence on their early development. \"He was teaching us stuff at a young age that you don't even realise,\" Jamie said. \"Things other people weren't learning till they were 16, 17 and you were learning when you were six years old. I think that was great. When we were growing up you'd cop a bit of stick off your mates, we maybe knew only three or four other kids in our whole neighbourhood who sort of liked soccer.\"\n\nChris, 30, joined his father in the Socceroos club when Pim Verbeek selected him to make a belated national team debut aged 29 last year. \"I always said to my old man I'd get there eventually so to get that initial call-up was a dream come true and hopefully one the little fella (Jamie) can emulate,\" said the former Luton Town and Colchester United captain. The Coyne brothers are likely to partner each other in the heart of the Glory defence against Gold Coast United this afternoon as a result of a two-game ban handed to central defender Andy Todd.\n\nJamie, who played in two National Soccer League championship sides with Glory, said playing alongside his brother has been a long held goal. \"We always talked about it over a few beers, that it'd be nice to play the last couple of years of our careers together and obviously it's ended up happening a bit earlier,\" he said. \"We get on really well and to have the opportunity to live in the same city again is great and the old man doesn't have to run home from my games and then stick the TV or radio on to listen to Chris' (overseas) games at night.\"\n\n17.10.2009\n\nFOSTER FIRES FLOREAT INTO LAST THREE\n\nFloreat Athena kept their play-off dreams alive with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Mandurah City on a warm afternoon at Litis Stadium. Substitute David Foster grabbed the decisive goal after 107 minutes of play to send Floreat into next weekends Preliminary Final with regular season winners Western Knights. The home side had taken the lead early through Daniel Neiderberger and looked set for victory until Jake Loreto snatched the equaliser in the 91st minute of a game that was played in near 37-degree heat.\n\nChristian Paschkewitz was gifted a great opportunity to give Mandurah a dream start but headed tamely at goalkeeper Alex Dunn inside a couple of minutes. It was a miss that would prove costly as with 5 minutes on the clock Mark Walshs under-hit back-pass was pounced on by Daniel Neiderberger who, although forced wide by Phil Straker, stroked neatly into the net from a narrowing angle. Mandurah then had appeals for what looked a legitimate penalty dismissed by referee Ton Klaver, whose only response was to speak sternly to Stephen Payne after he went down under the challenge of Adam Bachiller.\n\nThe match official saw it differently in the 20th minute by awarding a Mandurah penalty for James Isaias soft foul on Nicky Platt, however, justice was seen to be done when Paynes explosive spot kick rebounded back into play off the post. Floreat were playing with greater composure and fluency, and Mikulic really should have done better than push the ball straight into goalkeeper Phil Straker after meeting a low John Migas cross on top of the 6-yard box. The halves final opening came in stoppage time at the opposite end with Paschkewitz heading high a long ball into the area by Payne.\n\nThe main talking point of a sluggish start to the second half was the inconsistency of Klaver, the referee awarding Mandurah a free-kick on top of the 18-yard box despite a clear handball by Payne and yet ignored a succession of bone-jarring challenges on Mikulic. The game didnt spark back into life until the 69th minutes when Migas blazed over the bar following a neat exchange of passes with Foster down the left. Four minut"
