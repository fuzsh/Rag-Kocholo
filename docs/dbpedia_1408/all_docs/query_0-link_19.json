The Aussie girls are pictured at…\n\nRarely has Australia ever boasted such an abundance of evolving young talent. The Ashes have been successfully defended but the final XI which forfeited the final Ashes Test at The Oval will never play together again. Just three of the team were under 30: Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne (both 29) and Todd Murphy, 22. Tough decisions are inevitable, the blooding of many newcomers at ODI and Twenty20 level in spring a forerunner for sweeping change across all three levels. Within 12 months, almost all of those in their mid 30s will either decide to depart, like David Warner, or be told that their days in Test cricket are numbered. The champion new ball combine of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood is unlikely to be seen again. ‘IT WAS THE MOST HIGH-PROFILE OF…\n\nMEN TEST CRICKET Batsmen 1. Kane Williamson (NZ) 2.

For Todd Murphy, Australia’s first ever New Millennium born Test cricketer, that moment arrived in February when he had India’s champion Virat Kohli caught at the wicket on his Test debut in Nagpur. Only then did the tyro off-spinner realise he could compete at the game’s highest level. He would finish that innings with a fantastic seven wicket haul; the third best ever debut by an Australian spinner. ‘It will always be a highlight for me because of who he is and how good he has been,’ Murphy says. ‘It was exciting, the battles I had with him and a little surreal for me to be out there in the first…\n\nFast bowlers quick enough to make even the best dither and dance are sheer gold. In Australia, one man from the Golden West is in a league of his own. No one is more rapid, or as unsettling. And Lance Morris just might be in the right place at the right time in 2023. Already known as ‘The Wild Thing’, Morris hails from Scarborough via the small West Australian country town of Dunsborough near Busselton. He’s our new Thommo, or for the younger fans, our new Mitchell Johnson; except he’s right-arm. By physique, instinct and breeding, Morris, 25, is a yard quicker than anyone in Australia and NZ. At upwards of 145 km/h (90 mph), he is seriously sharp, right up there with the South African express Anrich Nortje. Only injury precluded his…\n\nA mid the hammering of the West Indies last summer, the shining promise of one young man was undeniable. Guyanese opening batsman Tagenarine Chanderpaul was not even in the original touring party named for the two-Test tour late in 2022. He received a late call up only after Jamaican John Campbell was banned for an anti-doping violation. The rookie left-hander slotted in as captain Kraigg Brathwaite’s new opening partner and played brilliantly. The pair’s first wicket stands of 78 and 116 in Perth were in the Greenidge-Haynes class – and there was more to come in Adelaide when Chanderpaul refused to buckle, despite the chaos around him and top scored in each innings. At the cavernous, mostly empty Perth Stadium, the two West Indians scored comfortably at three runs an over against the much-vaunted…"
