        "text": "“Their name shall be M.U.C.C.” 1967-72\n\n​\n\nThe formation of the Macquarie University Cricket Club in September 1967 was largely due to the work of Professor G.A.“Blue” Barclay and Jim “Colonel” Campbell. Their links to the fledgling Sports Association and interest in the sport enabled a platform for cricket at Macquarie University. At a staff barbeque they convinced a member of the university staff, Bob Vagg, who had previously had cricket connections at the University of New South Wales, to captain this team. The very first team at Macquarie had a prominent smattering of rugby players looking for something to occupy their time during non-rugby periods of the year. The team was entered in the Municipal and Shires competition at the ‘C’ Grade, current Third Grade level.\n\n​\n\nAn account of the initial match against Pennant Hills, from the very first student publication, named appropriately enough Premiere (October 1967), in the sporting section entitled This Sporting Life, records that “their name shall be M.U.C.C., something that had been decided before the match”. Macquarie made 79 and 61. Pennant Hills replied with 100 and were 9 for 21 in their second innings when a light appeal was upheld- “ the umpires from our own team yet! “Captain Bob Vagg's match return was 7 for 16 and 7 for 6, but still insists this was largely due to the fact there was no-one else in the side who could bowl. Amid references to “green power” and the “cads from Pennant Hills” Macquarie University Cricket Club was under way.\n\n​The first season was a difficult one, with only one victory, against Ryde-Balmain. The second season, 1968-69, was more successful results-wise, with a second team competing in the City and Suburban competition, a pattern the club was to maintain for the next four seasons. Even though the club finished tenth, core-players like Bob Vagg and Peter Barclay were strengthened by the arrival of new talent like Michael Redden, players who were to see the club’s strength rapidly expand.\n\nThe second season also saw the arrival of an interested, elderly spectator who drove a Mercedes, nearly always wore a cloth cap, smoked a pipe and was what we’d term today “a cricket tragic” - Ross Gwilliam. Ross was to be an enormous influence on cricket at Macquarie. He was President from 1969 to 1979. He donated a trophy to the club, to be awarded to the season’s best-performed player. The original ground is now named the Gwilliam Field in recognition of his invaluable contribution to our development. His considered opinions were always valued.\n\n​The 1969-70 season saw continued improvement. Peter Saunders enshrined himself in Macquarie folklore by hitting the last ball of the match against the University of New South Wales for six to tie the match. Paul Smith made the club’s first century with 108 against Lindfield. Michael Redden had an excellent season with the ball taking 50 wickets at 8.48. Playing strength was increasing with players joining the club of the calibre of Bob Porter, John Slack, Martyn Mills and John Stokes. The side finished sixth and things were definitely improving.\n\n​Season 1970-71 saw a continued improvement, although maybe not in our outward appearance. Australian Cricket magazine described us as “having more bearded, long-haired and bewhiskered players per capita than any in Sydney”. The club welcomed the arrival of talented all-rounder Peter Miller, who was to take over 300 wickets for the club, and the mercurial Frank Alley. After round three, the side lost no more matches. Alley took 42 wickets at 7.50 and Paul Smith was again amongst the runs with 459 at 35.30. The team finished fourth. The general feeling was that premiership success was now a distinct possibility. No-one realized how soon or emphatic it was to be.\n\nThe remarkable season of 1971-72 saw the promised breakthrough. The facts: ten out of thirteen matches won outright, one first innings loss, Auburn brushed aside by ten wickets in the final. The squad was Michael Redden (captain), Frank Alley (vice-captain), John Guiffre, Peter Miller, Martyn Mills, Peter Barclay, Bernie Clifton, Andrew Faulks, Phil Flynn, Mick Mittiga, Bob Porter, Tony Reading, John Slack and Paul Smith. In a season of outstanding performances, it is no wonder the side won so convincingly. Peter Miller 494 runs, including a 155 against Burwood carrying his bat in the semi-final, and 58 wickets at 6.92, John Guiffre 380 runs and 42 wickets, including match figures of 11 for 72 against Burwood in the semi-final, at 9.50, Bob Porter 410 runs at 68.34 and Frank Alley, a mind-numbing 86 wickets at 8.52 including the club’s first hat-trick. At the time of publication (October 2019) Frank’s performance has not been surpassed by any bowler at Third Grade level. The club was simply a juggernaut at this standard of cricket.\n\nIt is also worthy of note that the cricket club’s only Full Blue was awarded to Kerry Mackay in 1971. Although he didn’t play for the club, he did represent us at Intervarsity level, scoring 96 against Newcastle University. At that time, Kerry was also representing New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield competition.\n\n​​While being disappointed at not being elevated to A and B level shires, the following season was anything but an anti-climax. The club was to repeat the premiership victory of the previous season, emphasizing its dominance by playing a second Macquarie side in the Final on the new main oval, now known as Roger Sheeran Oval. John Guiffre with 547 runs, including a power laden 148 against Burwood in the semi-final and 44 wickets, Peter Miller 405 runs and 42 wickets, Frank Alley 329 runs and 62 wickets, Geoff Frankish 493 runs, Bob Porter 353 runs, with 110 in the semi-final against the University of New South Wales and Mick Redden’s 42 wickets, all reflected the club’s awesome power at this level of cricket. \"We were too strong for C Shires but too weak for A Shires\", Frank Alley reflected recently. The final itself was a little disappointing being a rain-affected game and containing a great deal of tension.\n\n​​Under Frank Alley’s inspirational captaincy, including a renowned pre-match “psyche-up”, Macquarie finished a very creditable fourth out of twelve at the Inter-Varsity carnival held in Adelaide at Flinders University in 1973, with victories over La Trobe and a strong Melbourne University that contained a then current Shefffield Shield player. Some players admitted to Frank, some years later, that his pre-match \"talks\" were both inspirational and frightening! Season 1972-73 found a third Macquarie team playing in the Gordon District competition, something that was to be renewed two decades later. A women’s team competed in the Sydney Metropolitan Women’s Cricket competition, something that which was not to be repeated for nearly twenty years. Macquarie had come from being a new, struggling club to a powerhouse in six seasons, a remarkable achievement.\n\nThe only sadness in this momentous season was the tragedy involving the Sports Association’s Head Groundsman, Stanley Moss, in September 1972, while on duty. He took pride in his work and the number one oval remains a lasting tribute to the man who did so much to create it. His replacement, Charles “Charlie” Seaton was to prepare the pitches for the next decade and a half and it’s fair to say that Stan’s standard was more than capably maintained. It’s amazing to think that Charlie never had a sit-on roller, he worked with a push-roller, but his wickets were of an excellent standard. His routine was always the same. On Friday the last job was always the mowing of the outfield after the wickets had been completed. His departure was certainly felt by the club who have not enjoyed the same dedication and cricket sense by the groundstaff that have followed Charlie. On more than one occasion a sometimes-desperate Macquarie captain could get Charlie to turn up early on a Saturday after rain had affected wicket preparation during the week. The cost for this extra work-generally a case of VB! One wonders what he could have produced had he had the equipment we enjoy today!\n\n​​“Full Shires Status” 1973-79\n\nBecause of the success of the previous two summers, the club was rightfully given full representation in A, B and C Shires cricket in the 1973-74 season. The first few seasons did not reflect the dominance of the previous ones but there were some significant steps in the club’s development. Brian Croke scored B grade’s first ‘ton’, 120 against Roseville in 1973-74. Off-spinner Steve Wiblin recorded A grade’s first hat-trick against Roseville in 1975-76. Peter Barclay’s 1975-76 C grade team were runners-up after finishing minor premiers, Frank Alley, returned from retirement to take 48 wickets and score 460 runs proving that he still ‘had it’. That same season, Neville Castle scored A grade’s first century, 101 not out against Pennant Hills.\n\nIn 1976-77 Laurie Ager joined from Dubbo and took 398 wickets for the club. Although he assured us, repeatedly, that his best cricket was behind him, “Tenny” Ager proceeded to take 55 A grade wickets in his first season at Macquarie, with a best of 8 for 17 against Roseville. Bowling with an economical “kangaroo jump” action, Laurie bowled prodigious and accurate in-swing. Many opposing batsman at different levels of cricket paid the price for underestimating his seemingly unthreatening bowling.\n\nCricketers in the mid-seventies who couldn't get enough cricket, often had the opportunity to play matches on Sundays against various opposition. District sides, clubs like the 729 club (people associated with working for channels 7, 2 and 9), different university sides, visits to the country to participate in seven-a side matches, were all chances for players to break into playing for the club, try and regain some form or just travel to the country for a \"different\" cricket experience. Peter Clarke was a driving force in making these extra matches possible.​\n\nThe end of season 76-77 saw the first stage of the construction of what was to become the Blue Barclay Pavilion. When the second stage was completed, the club enjoyed one of the finest and most envied facilities in the competition.\n\n​\n\n​From 1976 to 1979 the club had two C grade sides, these games often being some of the most hard-fought and bitterly contested games of the season. Seldom, if ever, did the fancied, more credentialed C team emerge victorious, sending the selectors into confusion about which players should be in the more ‘powerful’ team. In 1977-78 performances were on the upswing. All three grades, Andrew Faulks’ A team, Graeme Blues’ B team and Warrick Folkard’s C team all made the semi-finals, As and Bs for the first time. All finished in fourth position. Again, like the early seventies, the momentum seemed to be building.\n\n​\n\n​The season of 1978-79 was, and has been, the club’s most successful one, with successful campaigns in both B and C grades. Graeme Bleus’ B grade premiers did so from fourth position.​The side scraped in to fourth position position on percentages, were not in, were back in, were back out and then finally awarded fourth position. Secretary John Wickham worked frantically and successfully to ensure our participation. The strength of the side was decidedly in the bowling with Mick Leslie, Andy Hercus, the perennial Bob Vagg and leg-spinner Andy Corish the mainstays of the attack. In the first semi-final we defeated minor premiers Canterbury, the side's innings being \"inspired\" by the oppostion's captain \"Mankading\" one of our batsmen in the over before lunch. With rain threatening our charge for victory on the second day, at 5.25pm Canterbury were 5 for 135, the target of 321 being well beyond them. Ten minutes later, they were all out at the same score! In the final, 209 at Mona Park against Auburn-Lidcombe was always going to be difficult for the home team and an overnight score of 4 for 91 became 121 all out. Batting a second time, they could muster only 90. Leslie, Hercus and Vagg were the destroyers. We caught brilliantly on the second Saturday and by early afternoon we had gained our highest-ranking silverware. Bleus put it down to the fact that we “played better at the end of the season than during the season”.\n\nThe ‘C’ Grade premiers defeated two Epping sides on their way to victory.​In a see-sawing final, Gerry Quinn and Brian Van Zuylen played under pressure to steer the side to victory. Gerry Quinn 335, Peter Garty 380 and Brian Jones 291 were the main contributors with the bat. In the bowling, Sheffield-born Mark ‘Wes’ Hall with 36 wickets, Dave Baker with 28 wickets, Andy Pavlov with 24 wickets and Laurie Wiblin with 24 wickets were the stars with the ball. The Annual Dinner at the end of the year at the University Function Rooms was one of the best and most joyous we’ve had, reflecting two premiership victories.\n\n​\n\n​During this period of success, it is worth noting that the club’s playing success reflected the fruits of a sound and stable administration. Ross Gwilliam had been President for a decade, John Wickham had been a keen and efficient Secretary since 1976 and Chris Welsby had begun his twelve-year reign as Treasurer in 1978. We were in possession of probably the most impressive facility in the competition, the Blue Barclay Pavilion. The Roger Sheeran Oval was generally kept in excellent condition and the wickets that Charlie Seaton produced week after week were also excellent. In the club's first Annual Report of 1972-73, the first page optimistically stated that \"our long-term goal must be promotion to Grade cricket\" and just six seasons later, the New South Wales Cricket Association offered us participation in the prestigious Sydney Grade Cricket competition! But there were some strings attached.​\n\n​\n\n“The Grade Experience” 1979 – 1985\n\nFor most club members, the prospect of pitting skills against grade players was greeted with a nervous enthusiasm. There was some hesitancy expressed by some members about this quantum leap in the development of the club. Could we ‘cut it’ in grade? Would we attract new players and the quality players we required if we were to perform well? Would there ever be another\"offer\" to play Grade Cricket? What would happen to our non-grade teams? ​We joined with fellow grade debutants Southern Districts but only at Third and Fourth Grade level. With no immediate prospect of playing First or Second Grade, and most significantly, no announced plan for our future development or ultimate evolution, we were caught in a not immediately obvious but dangerous bind. We couldn’t attract First or Second Grade standard players from other clubs, and the players we could attract and develop would obviously want to go on to a higher level. We were left to ‘bumble along’ as best we could. We were a youthful club, with a youthful executive and the professional approach of the nineties was not an obvious solution to us, or indeed many other clubs in the early nineteen eighties.\n\n​\n\n​On the positive side, we certainly fulfilled the criteria the grade committee required for participation. We had a magnificent home ground, a second ground, with a third in prospect, turf practice wickets, excellent change rooms, the palatial Blue Barclay Pavilion​and excellent tea-time facilities, all the requirements that they were demanding. Potentially, we had a potent cricket-drawing population, many distinguished cricketers attending the University. The club’s administration was in excellent hands, with Allan Mahoney as Secretary and Chris “Grizzle” Welsby as Treasurer. The financial condition of the club was sound and getting stronger.\n\n​\n\n​It is interesting to contemplate who were the main instigators for our promotion. Certainly, the other Universities would have been supportive of it. Ross Gwilliam was very complimentary of Allan Barnes and Bob Radford. Fred Bennett, as a local resident, was very aware of our facilities Ultimately our case for retention in the grade competition failed. There were calls, quite justified, for a “re-organisation” of grade cricket. Why were we the ones, along with Sydney Cricket Club, the ones to go? Some members of the Grade Committee were very anti-university claiming that universities did not do anything to develop young cricketers. Some felt there was an over-emphasis on northern Sydney teams, the game had to spread to the west where the expanding population was, even though the population may not have reflected a corresponding interest in cricket. Despite a club submission, a detailed and logical case for our retention put forward by Secretary Mahoney and Treasurer Welsby that the Association acknowledged was “impressive”, we were uninvited after season 1984-85. What is particularly irritating is that despite all its plans, all its leaked pronouncements, all its submissions and time-consuming meetings, there has been almost no change in the structure of Grade Cricket in the intervening period.\n\nIn fairness our on-field results did not assist our cause. We needed impressive performances to secure our precarious foothold. One wonders had we achieved this or got somewhere near this, would it have made a difference? Regardless, the best we could offer was a seventh out of twenty teams for Third Grade in 1983-84 and a tenth out of twenty teams for the Fourth Grade in 1981-82. Individually there were some performances that rank among the club's best. Third Grade captain John Guiffre’s 108 at a rain-sodden Penrith was our first Third Grade century in our first season. Ian Harding’s 113 against Sydney was our first Fourth Grade century in 1980-81. In 1981-82, former New Zealand 1972 schoolboy tourist, Grant Craighead, took a staggering 59 wickets at 14.53 in Fourth Grade. Grant was to captain the Fourth Grade and Third Grade teams in later seasons and was a thoroughly professional medium-pacer who was a very awkward proposition especially if the pitch offered any sort of encouragement. Despite knee problems in the latter part of his career that necessitated a shorter run-up, Grant continued to take wickets at Third Grade level. In 1981-82 wicket-keeper Phil Dignan, with a total of 40 dismissals, enjoyed an excellent season.​\n\n​\n\n​Former First Grade Shires captain, Tony Monaghan, was responsible for Macquarie’s most outstanding individual performances in batting. After a moderate first season in mainly Fourth Grade, in his second season for the club in 1982-83, he aggregated 771 runs in eleven matches, at 55.07, and batted as well as anyone has seen at Third Grade level. Tony’s batting was characterized by aggressive but smoothly orthodox stroke play and like all class players when he was set he inevitably amassed big scores. Anyone who witnessed his breath-taking batting that season knew he was bound for higher honours. He was later to play First Grade at Western Suburbs in a strong side that contained then current test players Dirk Wellham, Greg Mathews and Dave Gilbert. Three big hundreds- 189 against Balmain on Ryde Oval, ended by a catch at fine leg that was heading for another six, 150 not out against Manly at Graham Reserve on a wicket that was very wet, and 137 against the University of New South Wales on the main oval ( Roger Sheeran oval ) left an indelible imprint. It is worth noting that Tony missed two matches that season! Tony was to return a decade later to captain First Grade Shires to its first and only Premiership victory.\n\nTreasurer, club stalwart and reliable opener, Chris “Grizzle” Welsby aggregated 620 Third Grade runs in a tremendous 1983-84 season. That same season, Andrew Lindsay achieved a wonderful all-round double of 516 runs and took 44 wickets with his left-arm orthodox. Mark Denny, later to play First Grade at Penrith, was a “quickie” we unearthed and due to his extreme pace had great difficulty in helping him in the slip cordon! During our five-season grade stint, Laurie Ager was still rolling along, totalling 143 Third Grade and 94 Fourth Grade victims. We encounted a number of players who were later to make their name at state or national level. The 1980-81 Third Grade side were lucky enough to pit their skills against a sixteen year old who enjoyed himself to 138 not out at our expense - his name - Stephen Waugh! Ironically enough, Third Grade’s proud record of never losing outright was to end at home in our very last match against Sutherland, when we were caught on a “sticky” at home. During this final Grade season, two Third Grade matches were covered by the film and television school with \"guest\" commentator Kerry\"Skull\" O'Keefe covering the first of these matches played against the University of New South Wales. The second of these matches was against Sydney Cricket Club and the games were taped.\n\nMention must be made of the Shires’ situation during the Grade period. Apart from a surprising ‘B’ grade semi-final appearance in 1979-80, the era is littered with constant defeat, many of them huge. Our initial feeling was that players who could cope with ‘A’ Shires could more than cope with Fourth Grade, and therefore A and B Shires was worth persisting with. While this was certainly the case, the fact was that few players emerged unscathed from constant defeat. Our Third and Fourth teams were confronting sides that could probably hold their own in at least Fourth Grade. We were a club that had got used to a degree of success, now, we had a generation of players who had seldom experienced victory. Understandably, many would not take the prospect of almost inevitable defeat. In retrospect, maybe ‘C’ Grade Shires would have been a better alternative for the club’s third and fourth teams. ​It was announced that for season 1985-86, Sydney grade club was to be dissolved, Southern Districts / Fairfield gained First Grade status, Macquarie University were to return to Shires, the \"experiment\" was over. Concerned club members wondered what sort of impact this would have.\n\n​\n\n​​“Post-grade malaise and re-building” 1986-90\n\nThe club lost a number of players but thankfully a reliable core of experienced players remained to try to re-establish ourselves as a force in Shires. Improvement tended to come in the lower grades at first, there now being an official fourth tier of Shires cricket - D Grade. During this re-building phase, the A’s finished no higher than sixth, this being no fault of Steve O’Reilly who established himself as A Grade’s most consistent and reliable batsman. Chris Welsby’s B Grade teams consistently threatened the semi-finals but the limited-over, end-of-season trophy of 1986-87 was the only success. Nick Rountree’s C Grade team of 1986-87 finished third, while Craig Anderson’s 1987-88 C Grade team finished runners-up. Chris Cohen, although primarily an opening bowler of some considerable pace, made D Grade’s first century with 101 against Strathfield in 1986-87. On the First of February 1987, the club held a combined Old Boys versus the Present Players on the Main Oval and the Gwilliam Oval to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the club. Ross Gwilliam spoke to the audience during the luncheon interval. In 1987-88 the club gained its third ground, what was to become known as the Northern Oval. It was also the debut season for a young player from Epping who was to become the club's greatest wicket-taker and has taken over a thousand wickets for the club, Greg Brown. In 1988-89 Michael “Roy” Denlow became the first player in the club’s history to play over 200 games. Allan Mahoney’s 1989-90 D Grade team were minor premiers by 18 points. Day one of the Final was washed out. On the second day when no other cricket was played in other parts of Sydney, the umpires decided that some cricket would be possible. As it turned out we lost the toss and Burwood got the opportunity to exploit a terribly under-prepared wicket. They were well motivated and maybe we were contemplating our first silverware in over a decade without making sure it had to be defended for an important couple of hours. The result was an absolute catastrophe and still galls the players involved. Their highly controversial loss in a rain-sodden final by a team they had belted in the competition proper, seemed to epitomise the frustration of the eighties for the club in general. Something was required to mesh the desire for credibility, the influx of new players and the desperate desire to win some sort of title. The catalyst was to be the club’s most ambitious project-a tour to the home of cricket- the United Kingdom.\n\n​\n\n​​“U.K. Tour and improved fortunes” 1990-2000\n\nThe prime motivator/ organiser of the tour was new President, Allan Davies. His dreams reached fruition in June 1990, when a party of seventeen left Sydney bound for the English midlands and Wales. Among the “cricketing highlights” were matches on some picturesque grounds, playing at “The Parks”- Oxford University’s home ground, a tour of Lords and the famous cricket museum and a photo session at the Cricketers Club London with England “great” Dennis Compton, who, as I recall, had very fond memories of Adelaide in 1947-48, “ They drink West-End there you know ”, and was pleased old mate Keith Miller was arriving soon, “ Do you know Keith?” We sadly had to inform him we didn’t but Craig Anderson did spend some time in Adelaide!\n\nWe were blessed with generally very good weather although it did get very cold at places like Shifnal. Most of the fourteen-match tour ended in victory for the tourists. Paul Notaras, with two centuries and Craig Edwards, the leading wicket-taker were the stand-outs, although it’s fair to say that everyone chipped in with some performance of note at some stage of the tour. In the final match of the tour in Cardiff, players noticed a very impressive car with blackened windows pull up at the ground. Its owner emerged- Issac Vivian Richards, who was moving from Somerset to Glamorgan. Luckily, he wasn't here for a mid-week net! The ground is now the test ground in Cardiff. We played so frequently that players actually began to look forward to a game off and join the non-players on some trip to various parts of the U.K. usually noting that an Australian soap opera would inevitably be playing in a pub at lunch time!​\n\n​​\n\nThe impact of the tour was immediate and dramatic. Along with the acquisition of a professional coach/player, Greg Gavin, hardened by many years of First Grade at Penrith, the tour galvanised the club for a committed effort for 1990-91. Seventeen centuries were scored that season, eight in the top grade. Three batsmen - Steve O’Reilly 669, Greg Gavin 634 and Paul Notaras 626 - smashed the previous A Grade record aggregate. Paul hammered a new high individual score for Macquarie - a thumping 201 not out (34 boundaries) against Canterbury. His partner appropriately enough was Steve O’Reilly in a team score of 2-342, after Canterbury batted 14 overs into the second week. A Grade finished fourth, their first semi-final appearance since 1977-78. Chris Welsby, passing the 200 game mark, led his B Grade side into the semi-final series after being clear minor premiers. They finished a disappointing third after being surprisingly beaten in the semi-final. Allan Mahoney, also passing the 200 game mark, saw his team finish a creditable fourth.\n\nThe University Sports Association recognised our achievements by awarding us the “Club of the Year Award “ but the crowning glory was the attainment of the treasured Club Championship trophy. Few will forget the excruciating wait for the C Grade to return to the Blue Barclay Pavilion with news of their match. We learned that six points from a first innings win would not be enough, Roseville would head us by two points. They meandered in at about 8.00 p.m. oblivious of what their result meant. They had been involved in an outright tie, via a Trevor Lockett leg-bye, - we had stalled Roseville’s charge by a miniscule number of points. We’d done it ! Our first major trophy for many, many seasons. The sense of relief was immense. The euphoria lasted long into the night and even the wizened club coach was seen to shed a few quiet tears.\n\n​\n\n​Season 1991-92 was another step forward. Acquisitions for A Grade were Dave Budge, a left-arm medium pacer, Peter Murphy a competitive cricketer with years of grade experience and lanky David Webb, who gave us a preview of things to come with 31 wickets at 10.22. Over a decade later, the lynchpin of Macquarie’s First Grade attack took 479 wickets in First Grade, a great achievement. Greg Gavin’s As and Mark Ramsland’s Cs were unluckily affected by rain in the first semi-finals. Both teams were in excellent positions until the elements intervened. Todd Ritchie’s Bs cemented their position in the final with a slow but purposeful 6-308 against Warringah in the semi-final only to finish second due to a drastically shortened final due to rain. The club also expanded its teams to six with an additional men’s team in the N.D.C.A. and a women’s team. Barry Brien re-wrote the record books for individual bowling excellence, damaging Roseville Bs to the extent of 9 for 63 . Dave Webb registered our first century at Frank Gray level with an undefeated 104 against Pennant Hills.\n\n​The 1992-93 season saw Greg Gavin’s A Grade make the semi-finals for the third successive season, this time reaching the final for the first time. After a rain-delayed beginning the As reduced Lindfield, containing former Australian test batsman Peter Toohey, to an even hundred after they had been 3 for 70 at one stage. Dave Webb starred with 6 for 31 from 14 menacing overs. The wicket was not a good one, especially for a Final and we knew our work would be cut out obtaining these runs. However, our mood was sobered by the loss of three late wickets, our position deteriorating from 0-21 to 3-21 overnight. Sunday saw more than a slight deterioration, the side crashing to a disastrous 8 for 38. A recovery to 9 for 86 and then a gut-wrenching 95 all out meant that we had fallen five short of our first A Grade title.\n\n​\n\n​Allan Mahoney’s B Grade finished minor premiers and took no chances. They made two huge scores. The first was 8 for 415 against Baulkham Hills in the first semi-final. Records now reveal that a young Simon Taufel was the umpire for this club record score. They followed this with 7 for 329 against Lindfield, not allowing their opponents to bat for the last four days of the season. So consistent was the scoring that in neither match was a century scored. We had equalled our victory of 1978-79 at the second highest level of Shires cricket. For the premiers, Mahoney 413, Greg Brown 323 had good seasons with the bat, while Barry Brien, 31 wickets, was the outstanding bowler. The performances of the women’s team were also on the improve and a fifth men’s team renewed our association with the Gordon district competition.\n\n​\n\n​Season 1993-94 saw Ken Dixon’s C Grade, undefeated all season, fall to Burwood in the final. The captain led the way with a 49 wicket season. Doug Latto’s D Grade won our first title at this level, batting consistently and purposefully to set Roseville the impossible task of obtaining 350 in half a day. Simon Burchett with 343 runs led the batting effort and Mark Smith with 22 wickets led the bowling. As an indication of the club’s growth, the number of male teams rose to six, with the entry of two teams in the Gordon competition.\n\n​\n\n​A pleasing development for the club was the initial success of our women’s team. Janine Newby’s Fifth Grade team reaped the benefit of gradual improvement in their third season. They defeated Blacktown, a team they hadn’t previously beaten, in a memorable final. Coach Amanda Pearton, averaging over seventy an innings and Betina Langerhuus, averaging forty seven, were the batting stars. Angela Woods, 31 wickets and Kerri Yule, 22 wickets, were the bowling stand-outs in a team where the strength of the side was its bowling.\n\n​Season 1995-96 was to be one long remembered as the club's First Grade team collected its only premiership to date, winning the final against Holroyd. With Tony Monaghan returning to the club as captain, this team had many strong performers, but it was the ​bowling of David Webb with 67 wickets, a new First Grade record, who led the way. Jamie Breden (571 runs) and Monahan (517), did most of the damage with the bat. After a tense semi-final against Lindfield, containing former Test batsman Peter Toohey, the Grand Final at Weldon Park was played on a very thick and slow outfield, with a total of 190 being a great deal more challenging than it looked. Skipper Monaghan with 60, was the the lynch-pin of the innings. Holroyd faced a testing spell before stumps, with Paul Notaras and Dave Webb bowling with great speed and intimidation. Holroyd were 6 for 33 at stumps and never really recovered. This was the club's second appearance in a First Grade Grand Final and the relief of victory was enormous. Season 1997-98, the 30th Anniversary of the club, was celebrated with a black-tie evening at the Australian Museum, an event that was enjoyed by the full house that attended. Ian Jessup composed an \"Ode to Macquarie\" as a 30th Anniversary dedication and can/should be read on the last page of Annual Report 1997-98. The final flings of this most productive decade were the Second Grade competing in the Grand Final of 1997-98 and the Women's team finishing third in 1999-00. In retrosrect, the nineties were an epoch in our history.\n\n​​The new millenium, 2000 and beyond\"\n\n​\n\n​​The new millennium began with our entry into the Metropolitan Cup for season 1999-00, a competition played on turf for players not selected in the first four Shires’ sides. While it was a tough initiation, it did mean our fifth team was playing on turf and in theory would find playing at higher levels a little easier. The following season the side made the semi-finals, with Paul Batten making 305 runs and taking 28 wickets. Ashley Robinson made our first century, with 153 not out against Canterbury-Bexley in 2001-02. Season 2001-02 saw our first participation in the Sydney Masters competition. Former First Grade captain Neil Howlett made 87 against Penrith, still our highest individual score in this competition and also made 303 runs, averaging over 75 per innings. This season also saw Ash Singh take a record 44 wickets in the Gordon competition.\n\n​\n\n​In 2002 the club ventured to the UK for the second time. Unfortunately, the weather was not so kind as the previous visit, with rain intervening in the early part of the tour. One of the wash-outs was against Ramsbottom, containing future Australian Captain, Michel Clarke. Despite this, the trip was still greatly enjoyed. Dave Smith was the leading wicket-taker and Chris Savage recorded our highest individual score in the UK with 148 against Kiveton Colliery and also made 299 runs. One of our tourists was mistaken for Kerry Packer in the Lords Museum! Maybe the team photo might provide a clue!\n\n​The following season 2002-03 saw a premiership in the GordonJun​ior District Cricket Association. Viv Samdarshi with 384 runs led the batting.Steve Johnson made a tremendous 142 not out when the side was deep in trouble. Tony Barnes with 30 wickets was the most successful bowler. Kain Walker impressed with 28 dismissals as keeper and supplemented this with a touch under 300 runs.\n\n​Mention must be made of the highly controversial demise of two potential finalist sides of the season 2003-04. Mark Hughes’ Fourth Grade side as lower finishing team, had to win the qualifying final scheduled for St. Lukes. They bowled the opposition out for 206 and were none for 28 at the close of day one. Day two was impacted by a very unusual rain pattern that manifested itself in the wicket being used unusually affected by water. The bone dry square was in contrast to a water-logged wicket. While we were no certainties, the situation was aggravated by the groundsman’s decision to roll the wet wicket. The team was then confronted with a don’t play/take your chances option which ultimately led to defeat. Despite a protest, nothing resulted. The pitch “vandalism” was a very unusual one with the “vandals” knowing where the St. Luke’s watering system was located, an amazing capability due the lack of light during the night, no violent vandalism was committed on the system to break into it, which generally characterises most senseless acts of antisocial behaviour, and an amazingly accurate selection of the correct wicket on the square to impact the current match. Mark Hughes commented that Third Grade, who were to play the following week against the same opposition at the same venue, should have someone camp overnight if things got “interesting”. Forward a week, and Third Grade made the “mistake” of setting the home team over 250 to win and taking a wicket prior to stumps. Come Day Two, the same “vandalism” occurred with the identical characteristics. Half the day was lost, the wicket received hours of rolling so any natural deterioration in the wicket was negated. Dave Smith's Third Grade took seven wickets but had to accept that their season had come to a cruelly premature end. Unfortunately, this was not the last time a final was affected by “outside” intervention against the same opposition. Warringah also were affected by “odd” happenings against the same opposition at St. Lukes.\n\n​The Masters broke through for their first of four premierships in 2004-05 winning without dropping a match. Steve O'Reilly with 333 runs powered the batting with Danny McVey leading the way with the ball as he had in the previous season. In 2005-05 Second Grade Captain Brent McKnee broke Second Grade's batting aggregate with 580 runs and surpassed this the following season with 620, a remarkable 1200 runs in two seasons! In the same season our Metropolitan Shield side made its first Grand Final. Batsmen Ron Roussetly 335 runs and Michael Cooke 305 runs, had good batting seasons while Paul Nelson 29 wickets and Ash Singh 23 wickets were the leading bowlers. The side fell at the final hurdle against Auburn.\n\n​\n\n​The season of 2005-06 saw the first Shires' premiership of the new century with Paul McInnes' Fourth Grade side. Mark Hughes, Paul McInnes and John Sutton all had 300 plus runs seasons. Four bowlers, Tim Spencer, Andrew Tosolini, John Sutton and Paul McInnes, all had wicket totals in the twenties. Chris Anstiss set a new bench mark for keepers in all grades, with a season total of 43 victims which was also a Shires' record for Fourth Grade. Undoubtedly the undisputed player of the season was Paul Chapman. He made 479 runs at the top of the order, with a century against South Sydney, took 10 slip catches and 50 wickets at 7.24. Paul's continued improvement over the proceeding years was enormous. Paul, who had taken 4 for 21, and Mark Hughes, who made 81, put on 88 for the first wicket in the chase for 168 for victory which was achieved for the loss of 5 wickets. The following season Greg Brown's Fourth Grade took all before them not losing a game until the last afternoon of the competition. Dave Gracie and Milon Biswas both passed 500 runs for the season with Dave setting a new benchmark of 539 for Fourth Grade. The skipper had a useful year with 461 runs and 45 wickets. The following season of 2007-08 saw Fourth Grade win again. Dave Gracie and Steve O'Reilly both made over 400 runs and Greg Brown led the way with the ball with 45 wickets. That season's campaign was highlighted by the \"Great Escape\" in the semi-final against Auburn. Auburn ended day one at 4-310 and continued batting into Sunday calling it quits at 384 leaving a tired and uneasy side to survive 96 overs. At 8 down with 23 overs left the situation looked dire. However, Greg Brown and young Jehan Bilimoria repulsed everything Auburn could hurl at them both physically and verbally and survived the 23 overs unparted.\n\n​\n\n​Fourth Grade were primarily responsible for keeping Macquarie’s successful profile in Shires in the early part of the new century, with victories in 2005-06, 2007-08 and 2010-11. In addition, they were runners up in 2006-07, losing just one match, and also 2009-10. Our Gordon District side won their first premiership in 2001-02 and won again in 2010-11. The Frank Gray side played its first Grand Final in 2009-10 but unfortunately were not successful. To supply cricket for the more mature cricketers 40 and over, the club entered the Sydney Masters competition in 2001-02 and the Masters recorded 4 premierships along the way, their most recent in 2008-09. The side has been very competitive and at one stage were unbeaten for 37 matches! Third Grade won their fifth premiership with victory in a low-scoring Grand Final in 2013-14. Premiership victories were obtained in the Tim Creer Cup were recorded in 2009-10 and 2015-16. The Chappelow Cup side of 2019-20 were our most recent premiers, the finals being affected by the arrival of the Corona virus. Nigel Castellino broke Steve O’Reilly’s First Grade aggregate record setting a new benchmark with 729 runs in season 2014-15. In 2015-16 Greg Brown took his 1000th wicket for the club, with an incredible fifty-four 5-wicket halls. Steve O’Reilly, with 9 centuries, is our leading all-time run-getter, with fewer than 100 runs to reach the outstanding 10,000 mark.\n\n​\n\nThe Macquarie University Cricket Club faced some major challenges particularly from the 2010s onwards. These revolved around financial and facility issues.\n\nThe Main Oval and its accompanying Facilities were viewed as a financial “opportunity”. It had a few incarnations as a restaurant, one name being, appropriately enough, The Middle of Nowhere. It was used as a golf driving-range. Because of these new roles the use of changing facilities was now something that was not a given. The biggest disappointment was the loss of the clubhouse which had been the envy of visiting teams since its construction in the late seventies. It was built for university sporting teams and was now no longer freely accessible. The main ground itself was slowly but gradually losing its attraction as our prime cricket resource. The outfield lost its predominantly couch grass basis and became thicker and consequently, the loss of speed made scoring slower and matches more attritional. The things that had been some decisive factors in our elevation to Grade cricket in previous decades were now weaknesses, our player/umpire change room facilities questionable and our major playing area unconducive to enjoyable cricket.\n\nA move to the Northern Oval was seen as the best solution to improve the situation. Used since season 1987-88, the outfield was still largely couch-based and was reasonably quick. The wicket was generally excellent. However, the major concern was the lack of any player facilities. Despite encouraging noises about possible developments, none materialised. This had a demoralising impact on club members and was a source of irritation to visiting umpires and teams. One visiting player was heard to remark that, “This is where cricket comes to die”. This was an understandable sentiment and a sad refection on the situation. In later seasons there were some unique ground staff practices such as covering the wicket-square all week, even if there was little prospect of rain which seemed to contradict most usual wicket-production practices! What it did for grass growth on the wicket-square is also questionable. Practice wickets became an increasingly continued source of frustration. Despite the availability of what seemed like an adequate number of staff and the availability of two wicket blocks, they sadly reflected a lack of effort put into their preparation. They were often soft, dangerous and too readily unavailable for use. This was particularly so after the season had commenced. This took the oxygen out of too many trainings and meant players gave up on training after a minimal amount of precipitation entrenched an expectation of “unavailability”.\n\n​\n\nShires Cricket at Macquarie University was now viewed as an unsustainable financial burden not worth supporting. The only “answer” suggested was to increase already exorbitant player fees to cover the costs of the grounds. With no player facilities on the Northern and only minimal on Gwilliam Field, most potential players would view the cost as a less than satisfactory return on their not unsubstantial season financial charges. Of great concern was the fact there was no guarantee of a limit to escalating ground hire charges. Comparative costs at other Shires clubs were also not flattering. Various business models proposed by the cricket committee were all rejected.\n\nConsequently, the grave result was the end of Macquarie University’s existence as a Shires’ cricket club. Our relationship with this competition had existed for over half a century, beginning in the summer of 1967-68 with the beginning also of Macquarie University.\n\nThe club continues with a faint pulse in the Northern Cricket Union competition but would benefit from participation in a turf potential competition. Hopefully, a renewed interest from Campus Life would be highly significant in sustaining the club’s existence, one which has continued for over fifty-five years."
