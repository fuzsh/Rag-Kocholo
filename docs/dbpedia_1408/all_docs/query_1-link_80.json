        "text": "AUSTRALIA has the chance to lift the ICC Under-19 World Cup trophy for the first time since 2010 when they take on India at Tauranga’s Bay Oval in New Zealand on Saturday.\n\nIt has been eight years since Australia claimed their last U19 title, when Mitch Marsh captained the team to a 25-run win over Pakistan.\n\nMarsh was one of three players in the final XI, alongside player-of-the-final Josh Hazlewood and Nic Maddinson, to go on and represent Australia at Test level.\n\nSouth Australian speedster Kane Richardson has also featured for his country in senior ranks, playing 15 One-Day Internationals and three Twenty20s.\n\nBut what happened to the rest of them?\n\n2010 Under-19 World Cup final at Lincoln, New Zealand.\n\nAustralia 9-207 (K. Richardson 44, T. Armstrong 37, J. Floros 35) defeated Pakistan 182 (J Hazlewood 4-30, L Doran 3-32)\n\nNIC MADDINSON\n\nTests: Three matches, 22 runs at 6.75\n\nT20Is: Two matches, 38 runs at 19\n\nFirst-class: 70 matches, 4040 runs at 34.52\n\nList A: 66 matches, 2324 runs at 38.09\n\nT20s: 73 matches, 1549 runs at 23.11\n\nThe hard-hitting left-hander made his Sheffield Shield debut for New South Wales nine months after Australia’s World Cup win, his first of 70 first-class appearances.\n\nMaddinson’s Test career was brief, playing three consecutive Tests against South Africa and Pakistan in the summer of 2016-17 before getting the axe.\n\nWhile he has fallen well down the pecking order in Australia’s red-ball cricket plans, Maddinson’s Big Bash performances for Sydney Sixers suggest he’s not far away from adding to his two Twenty20 internationals.\n\nTOM BEATON\n\nFirst-class: 12 matches, 345 runs at 17.25\n\nList A: 11 matches, 268 runs at 26.8\n\nT20s: 22 matches, 301 runs at 23.15\n\nA former captain under-19s level, Beaton has been in the domestic cricket wilderness for the past couple of seasons after losing his WACA contract.\n\nThe West Australian burst onto the domestic scene with a vital 71 on debut against Queensland in the Ryobi Cup one-day tournament, putting on 141 with captain Adam Voges.\n\nBeaton performed better in white-ball cricket than Sheffield Shield, where he averaged just 17.25 in 11 matches.\n\nHe more recently played for Big Bash side Melbourne Renegades as a middle-order batsman, but lost his spot on their list this summer.\n\nBeaton, who also works as a fitness professional, is back playing for Mt Lawley in the WACA first grade competition after a stint in Melbourne.\n\nMITCH MARSH (CAPTAIN)\n\nTests: 24 matches, 994 runs at 29.23, 29 wickets at 42.03\n\nODIs: 53 matches, 1428 runs at 35.7, 44 wickets at 35.54\n\nT20Is: Nine matches, 133 runs at 22.16, four wickets at 36.25\n\nFirst-class: 3809 runs at 32, 116 wickets at 30.06\n\nList A: 2875 runs at 37.33, 84 wickets at 30.05\n\nT20s: 1320 runs at 32.19, 40 wickets at 26.32\n\nMitch Marsh had already made his first-class, domestic one-day and Twenty20 debut by the time he captained the Australian under-19s to victory.\n\nOne of two current Test players to feature in the world cup triumph, Marsh cemented his spot with a brilliant 181 in the third Ashes Test at the WACA Ground last month.\n\nThe hard-hitting allrounder also took over the captaincy at WA from long-term skipper Adam Voges at the start of the summer, leading the Warriors to victory in the JLT One-Day Cup final with a player-of-the-match performance.\n\nMarsh has played for Australia in all three formats, with 24 Tests, 53 ODIs and nine T20Is under his belt.\n\nALEX KEATH\n\nFirst-class: Seven matches, 174 runs at 17.4, four wickets at 18.25\n\nList A: 16 matches, 250 runs at 19.23, three wickets at 32.66\n\nT20s: Five matches, 30 runs at 13.33\n\nKeath has had a remarkable sporting career for someone his age, playing professionally at both cricket and footy.\n\nWhile he was still in high school, the talented allrounder turned his back on an AFL career with the Gold Coast Suns to sign a three-year deal with Victoria.\n\nBut he struggled to make an impact at domestic level and eventually lost his Bushrangers contract after seven first-class and 16 List A appearances.\n\nHe has since moved to South Australia where he was picked up by the Adelaide Crows as a Category B rookie, playing seven AFL matches as a key defender.\n\nJASON FLOROS\n\nFirst-class: 15 matches, 524 runs at 22.78, 26 wickets at 44.46\n\nList A: 28 matches, 380 runs at 23.75, 17 wickets at 34.88\n\nT20s: 27 matches, 225 runs at 15, three wickets at 93.33\n\nA Canberra native, Floros moved to Queensland ahead of the 2009-10 season after getting a Bulls rookie gig.\n\nHe was important with bat and ball in the under-19 final at Lincoln, making 35 before an economical 1-19 off eight overs.\n\nThe off-spinning allrounder is still contracted at Queensland and captained the state’s one-day side last summer.\n\nFloros has struggled for opportunities this season, featuring twice in the JLT One-Day Cup to go with the solitary appearance with Brisbane in the BBL.\n\nTIM ARMSTRONG\n\nList A: Two matches, one run at 0.5, one wicket at 53\n\nT20s: Six matches, 54 runs at 13.5\n\nAustralia’s leading run-scorer in the tournament with 240 runs at 48, Armstrong held a New South Wales rookie contract for one season before moving west in search of more first XI opportunities.\n\nThe allrounder played for the Warriors and Perth Scorchers without ever getting a WACA contract.\n\nArmstrong was sanctioned by the WACA after an incident involving Tom Triffitt on a Future’s League trip to Queensland, with both players withdrawn from the match.\n\nHe’s currently working in London for Stocks Digital, a media investor platform, and playing cricket for Teddington Cricket Club in the Middlesex Premier League.\n\nTOM TRIFFITT (WICKETKEEPER)\n\nFirst-class: 24 matches, 1036 runs at 25.9, 96 dismissals\n\nList A: 13 matches, 154 runs at 14, 17 dismissals\n\nT20s: 30 matches, 202 runs at 12.62, 23 dismissals\n\nThe talented wicketkeeper-batsman endured a rollercoaster first-class career with Tasmania and Western Australia.\n\nA member of the Tigers’ 2010-11 Sheffield Shield-winning team, Triffitt left Tasmania for WA after the following season.\n\nTriffitt was released from his Warriors contract after an alcohol-fuelled incident in Brisbane in 2014, where he was charged with one count of wilful damage and two counts of stealing.\n\nHe returned to Tasmania’s first-class ranks after a successful stint with the Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash, earning a Tigers contract for 2015-16 and playing eight of a possible 10 Shield games.\n\nThe 27-year-old has since lost his contract and longer plays cricket at any level.\n\nHe currently works in the real estate industry in Hobart as a residential sales consultant.\n\nKANE RICHARDSON\n\nODIs: 15 matches, 21 wickets at 33.23\n\nT20Is: Three matches, one wicket at 82\n\nFirst-class: 28 matches, 90 wickets at 31.32\n\nList A: 65 matches, 105 wickets at 28.1\n\nT20s: 70 matches, 75 wickets at 26.26\n\nWhile he is yet to reach great heights at international level, Kane Richardson has been a mainstay of South Australia’s bowling attack for many years.\n\nThe Northern Territory product has been in dominant form for Melbourne Renegades in BBL07, including back-to-back four-wicket hauls, after crossing from Adelaide Strikers on a five-year deal.\n\nHe was rewarded with a spot in Australia’s Twenty20 side for their trans-Tasman series against England and New Zealand this month.\n\nA right-arm fast-bowler and handy lower-order batsman, Richardson top-scored in Australia’s Under-19 World Cup final win with a run-a-ball 44 batting at No. 8.\n\nHis best performance at in the ODI arena came against India in Canberra in 2016, where he took 5-68 in a man-of-the-match effort.\n\nJOSH HAZLEWOOD\n\nTests: 36 matches, 139 wickets at 25.77\n\nODIs: 41 matches, 69 wickets at 24.27\n\nT20Is: Seven matches, eight wickets at 33.62\n\nFirst-class: 68 matches, 255 wickets at 24.74\n\nList A: 86 matches, 140 wickets at 26.37\n\nT20s: 30 matches, 37 wickets at 24.35\n\nJosh Hazlewood was Australia’s best-performed bowler in the tournament, taking 13 wickets at 15 including 4-26 in player-of-the-match effort in the final.\n\nLike his under-19 captain Mitch Marsh, the reliable fast-bowler has gone on to represent Australia in all three formats.\n\nThe New South Welshman is has formed an exciting pace attack alongside Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins.\n\nHe had an impressive Ashes campaign this summer, grabbing 21 wickets at 25.9 in Australia’s 4-0 series triumph.\n\nLUKE DORAN\n\nList A: Three matches, eight wickets at 17.62\n\nT20s: 15 matches, eight wickets at 35.87\n\nThe left-arm spinner was a New South Wales rookie when he featured in Australia’s under-19 success.\n\nDoran, who took 3-32 in the final against Pakistan, played in three domestic one-day matches for the Blues before losing his contract after the 2012-13 season.\n\nHe also lined up in the Big Bash for the Sydney Thunder and Sydney Sixers, with his last appearance in 2014.\n\nThe older brother of Tasmanian wicketkeeper Jake Doran also lives in the Apple Isle where he captains Lindisfarne in the Cricket Tasmania Premier League and works for cricket equipment brand Icon Sports.\n\nALISTER MCDERMOTT\n\nFirst-class: 20 matches, 75 wickets at 24.77\n\nList A: 27 matches, 48 wickets at 24.7\n\nT20s: 25 matches, 29 wickets at 23.1\n\nThe son of former Australian quick Craig McDermott looked destined to forge an international career of his own when he debuted as a teenager for Queensland in a Twenty20 match back in 2008-09.\n\nA red-headed Queenslander with pace the burn, McDermott held a rookie contract at the Bulls while he was still in high school.\n\nHe played a vital role in Brisbane Heat’s first Big Bash title in Perth back in 2012-13, grabbing 2-21 from four overs in his side’s upset win over Perth Scorchers at the WACA.\n\nBut, despite averaging less than 25 with the ball in all three formats, he was cut alongside his younger brother Ben, who now plays for Tasmania, at the end of 2014-15.\n\nMcDermott also had a stint at Sydney Thunder but has since disappeared into the domestic cricket wilderness.\n\nHe still plays first-grade club cricket in Brisbane for Wynnum Manly as well as working in commercial real estate."
