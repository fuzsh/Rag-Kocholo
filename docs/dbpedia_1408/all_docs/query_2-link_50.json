He then taught until 1904, when he entered the United States Military Academy. He was made a cadet corporal, cadet first sergeant, and eventually cadet captain. Peterson was a skilled rifleman and played for the school's polo team.[1] He graduated third of 108 in the United States Military Academy class of 1908. Upon graduation, Peterson was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Corps of Engineers.[2]\n\nMilitary service\n\nJunior officer\n\nUnited States Army Corps of Engineers logo\n\nFrom February to May 1908, Peterson was stationed at Fort Leavenworth. Until September, he was at Fort Riley, when he was assigned to map work in Fort Benjamin Harrison. From 30 June to 13 July 1909, he was at the military tournament in Toledo, Ohio. Peterson then attended the engineering school at Fort Lesley J. McNair, graduating on 5 November 1910. He was stationed with the 3rd Battalion of Engineers at Fort Leavenworth until 9 March 1911, during which he performed various duties and embarked on several short map-making tours in Ohio and Indiana. Peterson was then stationed in San Antonio with the Maneuver Division until 4 November 1911, when he was sent to the Philippines. First at Camp Stotsenburg, Peterson worked on a topographical survey of Luzon from 5 February to 1 May 1912. He was in charge of construction of a mechanical and electrical plant on Corregidor Island until 1 September 1913. Peterson then served as an aide-de-camp to J. Franklin Bell until 15 September 1914. He also supervised the construction of a hydroelectric plant and officers barracks. He then returned to the United States in late 1914.[3][4]\n\nOn February 28, 1915, Peterson was made a captain.[5] From February 1915 to August 1918, Peterson commanded groups; including the 9th Engineer Battalion and the 8th Engineer Mounted Battalion, at various camps; including in Brownsville, Texas, the Washington Barracks, and in El Paso, Texas.

For his service he received the Army Distinguished Service Medal.[9]\n\nRise and infrastructure work\n\nPeterson left Camp A. A. Humphreys to attend the United States Army War College to November 1918.[8] Peterson was then the commandment of the engineering school at Camp Humphreys from November 1918[3] to June 1920, and served as the assistant to the District Engineer in Boston until 31 December 1920.[8] During his tenure he was credited with increasing the quality of education for engineers, while shortening the course length. After 1920, he spent his time in New England, in various engineering districts, with the majority as Providence, Rhode Island district engineer.[7]\n\nAt the United States Army Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Peterson was a student from August 1924 to June 1925. Until 1929, he was an instructor at the school. He then was Assistant Director of Public Buildings and Public Parks of the Capitol in Washington D.C. until 30 March 1930. Peterson next was an assistant to the United States Army Corps of Engineers Chief of Engineers, as chief of the Miscellaneous Civil Section from April 1930[7][8] to August 1932, during which he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel on 1 November 1931.[10] As chief of the section, he oversaw the study of projects, preparation of correspondence, and recommendations in all matters relating to the establishment of and changes in harbor lines; the removal of wrecks and other obstructions to navigation; the bridging of navigable waters; the supervision of New York Harbor; the lakes survey; the water supply and the public buildings and grounds of Washington, D.C.; the preservation of Niagara Falls; the national parks; and other miscellaneous matters.[11]\n\nHe spent a year at the United States Army War College, where upon graduating he was appointed district engineer of the Los Angeles Engineering District. From February 1934 to February 1936, Peterson commanded the 3rd Engineers at Schofield Barracks. From May 1936 to March 1938, he served as the district engineer of the Detroit River and Harbor District.[10] From March 1938 to February 1940, Peterson was chief of staff at the headquarters of the Sixth Corps Area in Chicago.[12]\n\nInspector General\n\nOn February 27, 1940, Peterson was appointed to Inspector General of the United States Army.[10] As Inspector General, he was credited with \"seeing more men, maneuvers, and facilities than any other officer in the Army.\"[7]\n\nIn this role, he helped instill a number of policies that would guide the military through coming cultural shifts. In the spring of 1942, he recommended forming fewer black units due to slow deployment of black units because staff at overseas theaters often refused to accept them. Peterson argued that it was more important to focus on supplying the army with adequate combat forces. The suggestion was not acted upon.[13] He investigated the treatment of Japanese American soldiers at Fort Riley and in Arizona.[14][15]\n\nHe was charged by George Marshall to investigate whether training and maneuvers knowledge were adequate among soldiers.[16] Peterson advocated for forecasting the construction of cantonments so that there would be fewer material shortages, which was successfully incorporated.[17] He was hesitant towards the Psychological Warfare Division in its early stages, feeling it provided unclear value to the army; Peterson's recommendations led to changes in the structure of the department.[18]\n\nLater life\n\nThe amount of work began to affect his health, and after having a heart attack, was reassigned to the Army Service Corps.[7] Peterson retired from the Army on 28 February 1946.[19] He received the Army Distinguished Service Medal (presented as an oak leaf cluster) for his work as Inspector General.[6] In his column Washington Merry-Go-Round, Drew Pearson claimed that Peterson was \"not a brilliant success,\" and he received his post of Inspector General as a result of his friendship with Edwin Watson.[20] Peterson lived in Washington, D.C. until his death on 15 February 1956.[21]\n\nАноним 07/05/20 Чтв 17:57:34 №219644191105\n\nGhost Trouble: The Casefiles of Eli Mothersbaugh is a collection of mystery fantasy short stories by American writer Richard Parks, gathering together the stories featuring his ghost hunter character Eli Mothersbaugh.

A government agency, the Bureau of Bio-Remnant Reconciliation, has been established to deal with them, and that's the job of field agent Eli Mothersbaugh, physically sensitive to ghosts' psychic energy fields and possessed of the latest high tech detection gear. He is aided in four of the last six cases by academic Bonnie Simmer, whom he meets in the story \"Diva.\" The book collects all twelve of Eli's adventures, including five previously unpublished.\n\nContents\n\n\"Wrecks\" (from Odyssey, issue 2, 1998) – High-tech ghost hunter Eli Mothersbaugh tries to bring peace to a ghost haunting a train station—and the ghost's living daughter.\n\n\"The God of Children\" (from Asimov's Science Fiction, v. 24, no. 12, Dec. 2000) – Eli is summoned to Japan by his old friend Hiro Yamada, whose mother is haunted by an unusual spirit.\n\n\"A Respectful Silence\" (from Realms of Fantasy, v. 8, no. 2, Dec. 2001) – At an abandoned airfield, Eli assists a pilot's ghost in making her final report.\n\n\"A Hint of Jasmine\" (from Asimov's Science Fiction, v. 28 no. 8, Aug. 2004) – Eli is commissioned to solve a mystery involving the ghosts of Water Oaks Plantation.\n\n\"Voices in an Empty Room\" (from Haunted Holidays, Oct. 2004) – Eli investigates the ghostly mystery behind a terrorist attack that rocked the town of Canemill, Mississippi.\n\n\"Hanagan's Kiyomatsu, 1923\" (from Worshipping Small Gods, 2007) – A rare Japanese print has been destroyed by the ghost of its late owner; Eli must discover why.\n\n\"Diva\" (from Worshipping Small Gods, 2007) – Eli is asked to exorcise a ghost of an opera singer haunting the auditorium of Armfield State University. But should he?\n\n\"Beacons\" – Eli investigates a report of a phantom storm hitting a barrier island, only to find no evidence of its energies—until he realizes he's looking in the wrong place.\n\n\"Muramasa's Rage\" – Hiro Yamada calls Eli and Bonnie back to Japan to look into the threatened theft of a legendary sword—by a ghost. Which, they discover, has been making the attempt the past four hundred years. But it's getting stronger...\n\n\"His Hour Upon the Stage\" – Larry Williams, key actor of the Cobblestone Players, is dead, and his ghost is apparently disrupting their latest production. It's up to Eli to find out why.\n\n\"Souvenirs\" – Susan Christensen must auction off her late father's World War II memorabilia to avoid foreclosure on her home, which seems to disturb her father's spirit.

As she has gone missing, a rescue expedition is in order—but the rescuers soon find they need rescuing themselves.\n\nReception\n\nReviewer Don D'Ammassa puts \"'The God of Children' [among] my two personal favorites\" in the stories that appeared in Parks's first short story collection, The Ogre's Wife.[2] He cites the four Eli Mothersbaugh tales appearing in Parks's second collection, Worshipping Small Gods, as evidence their writer is not \"a one note author,\" noting their \"contemporary settings and a much more somber tone ... closer to horror fiction, [though] the approach is more matter of fact and there is little actual menace, though certainly considerable mystery. ... I liked 'A Hint of Jasmine' and 'Diva' the best of these.\"[3]\n\nPublishers Weekly highlights \"Voices in an Empty Room\" as among the stories particularly noteworthy in its review of Worshipping Small Gods, finding it \"[t]he most compelling entry\" in the collection.[4]\n\nRay Olson of Booklist calls the \"stories [that] feature benevolent ghostbuster Eli Mothersbaugh of Canemill, Mississippi, ... so fine, sensitive, and southern that Eudora Welty might approve of them.\"[5]\n\nRichard Larson calls the Mothersbaugh stories \"about truth, as any good mystery story should be: the visible truth, the hidden truth, the false truth, and the real truth ... often conflicting, especially when people don't want to know the truth at all ... they want the ghosts gone, but they rarely want to deal with why the ghosts are there in the first place.\" He notes that the series \"creates a hybrid genre—science fiction/fantasy/mystery—that convincingly and delightfully creates a world ... in which the past is a bothersome but ever-present encroachment upon daily life.\" Regarding the individual tales, he feels \"A Hint of Jasmine\" \"clips along like any solid mystery with a steady drip of clues,\" while rating \"Voices in an Empty Room\" a \"weaker story\" and \"Hanagan's Kiyomatsu, 1923\" \"a simple trotting out of Parks's developing formula.\" \"Diva,\" on the other hand, is \"sweet and unabashedly sentimental, a journey to restore things to the way they once were, and it functions strongly as an end to the arc by commenting on what has come before.\" Larson praises it for combining \"all the notable aspects of Parks's skill set: compassion for his protagonist, a mystery to be solved, an endearing love story, a past to uncover, and the quirkiness that is painfully lacking in some of the more minor stories.\"[6]\n\nАноним 07/05/20 Чтв 17:58:54 №219644283108\n\nThe All Sky Automated Survey (ASAS) is a Polish project implemented on 7 April 1997 to do photometric monitoring of approximately 20 million stars brighter than 14 magnitude all over the sky.[1] The automatic telescopes discovered two new comets in 2004 and 2006. The ASAS-South, located in Chile and ASAS-North, located in Hawai'i, are managed by Grzegorz Pojmański of the Warsaw University Observatory via the internet.[not verified in body]\n\nThe idea was initiated by the Polish astronomy Professor Bohdan Paczyński of Princeton University. The prototype instrument and data pipeline were designed and built by Grzegorz Pojmański. The work on the ASAS program began in 1996 with a mere $1 million budget. The automatic telescope, located in Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, was designed to register the brightness of circa one million stars in the Southern Hemisphere. However, it proved very efficient and helped to find many new variable stars. The project was then expanded, and now operates four telescopes located in Las Campanas Observatory. The Chilean observatory is operated by the Carnegie Institution of Washington.[2]\n\nSo far, ASAS has discovered 50,000 variables located south of declination +28°, which means that it has covered 3/4 of all the sky. Pojmański comes to Chile only once every year. The telescope works automatically. Routine work such as exchanging of the data is done by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) observers. Such an intervention is needed once a week. On each starry night when an OGLE observator opens or closes the dome, the ASAS booth is opened or closed automatically.[3]\n\nGrzegorz Pojmański is supported in the project by the State Committee for Scientific Research, Poland. The project is assisted by OGLE observers. Paczyński was supported by William Golden.[citation needed]\n\nContents\n\n1 The ASAS 1-2 systems\n\n2 The ASAS-3 system\n\n3 Selected discoveries\n\n3.1 Comets\n\n3.2 Novae\n\n3.3 Dwarf Novae\n\n4 ASAS Alert System\n\n5 ASAS publications\n\n6 References\n\n7 External links\n\nThe ASAS 1-2 systems\n\nThe prototype ASAS instrument, equipped with 768x512 Kodak CCD and 135/1.8 telephoto lens, and mounted on the computer controlled robotic mount, operated from 7 April 1997 until 6 June 2000. Prototype took about 15 3-minute exposures (covering 90 sq. deg.) per hour (over 120 per night) with limiting I-magnitude 13 and resolution of 14 arcsec/pixel.

Bakshi is quoted as saying that the animation is \"probably higher quality than anything I ever made, at a cost so low it's embarrassing. Everything I used to do in my old movies that required hundreds of people and huge salaries is now done in a box. It took 250 people to make Heavy Traffic, now I'm down to five. I kiss the computer every morning — f-----' unbelievable!\"[2]\n\nProduction was announced in 2006, attracting much interest, but no official funding, and according to Bakshi, \"I had about eight minutes of film and a completed script. I thought budget was a slam dunk. For a Bakshi comeback film, it seemed like a no-brainer. [...] I asked one guy [in Hollywood], 'Should I have a budget of $150 million and pocket the rest?' He said, 'Yeah, but you have to make it PG'\".[3] Bakshi ended the production to rethink his approach towards the film. Its production status was left uncertain.[4]\n\nOn October 20, 2012, at Dallas Comic-Con: Fan Days, Ralph Bakshi participated in a Q&A where it was stated that he would take Last Days of Coney Island to Kickstarter in an attempt to crowdsource the funding.\n\nA Kickstarter campaign was launched on February 1, 2013 to complete funding for the first short in the film.[5][6][7] On March 3, the film was successfully funded and raised $174,195 from 1,290 backers, and Bakshi confirmed production had begun.\n\nCasting\n\nWhen the project was first announced on Kickstarter, voice actress Tina Romanus, who had previously worked with Baskhi on Wizards and Hey Good Lookin', was confirmed to play the role of Molly, the main character's love interest.[5] In February 2013, actor Matthew Modine was cast in the film after coming across the film's Kickstarter campaign online in the role of Shorty, described as \"a 4-foot-tall mafia collector who thinks he's Elvis Presley and sings like Chet Baker\".[8][9]\n\nOmar Jones ended up replacing Matthew Modine in the lead role of Shorty.[10] Other voices include Ralph himself, Eddie Bakshi, Jess Gorell, Jonathan Yudis, Joey Camen and Ron Thompson.\n\nAnimation\n\nMuch of the production was aided with the use of Toon Boom Studio, computer software designed to assemble 2D animation. Ralph Bakshi is quoted as saying \"Eddie [Bakshi's son] began some coloring and refining of artwork in Photoshop then gradually moved over to doing this in Toon Boom Studio. The crossover was relatively painless. The programs worked well together. [...] I set up the picture in a traditional manner then Eddie uses Toon Boom Studio to do everything else. My animator Doug Compton also uses Toon Boom Studio to assemble and send pencil tests and animatics. Toon Boom Studio essentially becomes the studio.\"[11]\n\nEarly on, Colleen Cox was announced to be the lead animator of the film. Tsukasa Kanayama was also hired as a storyboard artist, with Joseph Baptista helping with the storyboarding and also helping with some of the character designs. Animator Elana Pritchard was also hired to contribute a sequence in January 2014.[12] British illustrator Ian Miller was hired to help with the background art for the film; Miller had previously worked with Baskhi on Wizards and Cool World.[5]\n\nRelease\n\nLast Days of Coney Island premiered on Bakshi's 77th birthday on October 29, 2015 on Vimeo.[10] Bakshi released the film for free on YouTube on October 13, 2016.[13][14]\n\nАноним 07/05/20 Чтв 18:00:31 №219644407113\n\nDelegation theory refers to the process by which a manager shifts some of the responsibilities for a given task implementation to another team member with the view of achieving maximum result.\n\nContents\n\n1 Applications of Delegation Theory\n\n1.1 Independent Central Banks and Non Majoritarian Institutions\n\n1.2 The European Union\n\n2 Delegation in Spain\n\n3 References\n\n4 Sources\n\nApplications of Delegation Theory\n\nIndependent Central Banks and Non Majoritarian Institutions\n\nOne of the most important areas where delegation theories have been applied has been in the debate over the merits of Independent Central Banks (ICBs) such as the Bank of England or the European Central Bank. This debate has corresponded to the theories of credible commitments and can be understood as a solution to problems posed by the two democratic pressure problems mentioned above where monetary policy is concerned. Those in favour of the creation of ICBs have primarily focused on interest rates and have argued that democratic pressures tend to have an inflationary effect as governments will often be tempted to advocate lower interest rates immediately prior to an election so as to manufacture short term booms in the economy and boost their support - but to the detriment of long term economic health. A variant of this argument is that as most democracies incorporate two main parties split on economic policy between left and right, the party of the left winning power will often result in damaging inflation raising policies immediately after the election in an effort to distance itself from the previous government. A solution to these problems has naturally been sought in the creation of an independent institution which can decide interest rates outside of the influence of democratic pressures - the ICB.\n\nThis argument has been highly influential and the number of ICBs has risen dramatically since the 1980s however it is not without its critics. Many scholars (for instance Kathleen Mcnamara) have questioned the premises of the ICB argument, making the case that democratic pressures will not result in high inflation and that high inflation is not inherently bad for the economy long term. Broadly speaking the empirical evidence on these points has tended to be inconclusive for both sides. An alternative criticism has come from certain branches of New institutionalism who have sought to explain the increase in ICBs not by the 'rational' argument outlined above, but as a process of symbolism, where governments will create ICBs because they are seen to be respectable institutions by other actors, particularly by foreign investors who, it is argued, will view a country with an ICB as a modern state worthy of investment.\n\nThe European Union\n\nDelegation theories have also been applied extensively in studies of the European Union. The dominant approach has undoubtedly been the principal-agent approach, but there have also been variations from the classic form by intergovernmentalist approaches and the fiduciary model laid out by Giandomenico Majone.\n\nAndrew Moravcsik is perhaps the most prominent intergovernmentalist theorist who has written on delegation and his work can essentially be thought of as applying the principal-agent model in a manner which stresses minimal agency loss. The model is not a simple principal-agent model however, as he conceives of the EU as delegation on three levels. Firstly there is the delegation from European electorates to national governments (who in this sense act as agents), secondly there is the delegation from national governments (who now act as principals) to European institutions such as the European Commission. Moravcsik has been particularly interested in the informational asymmetries which arise from delegation in the European Union and has argued that whilst there is minimal agency loss between the national governments and the European institutions, the national governments gain significant informational advantages over European electorates which allow them to carry out policies at home which they would not be able to do in the absence of the European Union. In this sense the delegation process strengthens the national governments rather than weakening them (as is traditionally assumed where the European Union is concerned). This has nevertheless been seen as inconsistent by some scholars (for instance Mark Pollack) who take issue with the assertion that informational advantages only allow national governments to gain freedom from European electorates and that the same principle applies with European institutions gaining an advantage over their principals through informational asymmetries.\n\nIn contrast Giandomenico Majone has formulated a theory of delegation which stresses the importance of credibility problems in the decision to delegate to European institutions. Not only is this explained as a mechanism to ensure member states comply with treaty obligations, but employing similar logic as that used in the ICB debates he makes a defence against democratic deficit arguments which advocate a directly elected European Commission. Much in the same way as in the ICB debate democratic pressures are seen as impacting negatively on what is a primarily regulatory institution and as such for Majone the Commission should be insulated from democratic pressures if it is to fulfil its functions effectively.\n\nDelegation in Spain\n\nA delegation (of Latin deputatione) is, in a broad sense, a body of deputies of an assembly (persons to which the assembly delegates its authority) and its respective activities. In Spain, the term is used in a stricter sense in order to designate the administration of some provinces on behalf of the central authority, be it the King or, in modern times, a democratically elected Parliament.\n\nThe delegations (in Aragonese deputazions, in Catalan diputacions, in Basque aldundia and in Galician deputación) have territorial character and their function is to manage the economic and administrative interests of the provinces. In the Canary islands the functions of the delegations are exerted by each island's town halls (delegaciones insulares), and in the Balearic islands insular councils (in Catalan consells insulars).\n\nThe history of the delegations traces back to 1812 with the enactment of the Constitution of Cadiz, the first democratic Constitution in Spain, having had different roles over the centuries, such as tight control from central government in Francoist Spain.\n\nThe members of the delegations are elected in an indirect way, by computing the total result of local elections in each province. However, the members of the town halls and insular councils always have been chosen in direct election, in elections separated from the autonomic or joint with the autonomic elections in the Balearic islands, until the Statute of Autonomy reform in 2007.\n\nThe three Basque delegations (and previously also the Delegation of Navarre) are known with the name delegaciones forales, since these four territories still preserve their fueros or Medieval privileges. The Delegación foral is an executive branch that depends on the General Meetings (the legislative). The General Meetings are the parliaments of each historical territory whose members (junteros or solicitors) are chosen by popular voting, expressed during local elections.\n\nАноним 07/05/20 Чтв 18:09:35 №219645089127\n\nHancocks & Co is a retail jeweller in London, founded on 1 January 1849 by Charles F. Hancock, a former partner of Storr and Mortimer. The first shop was opened at a corner of Bruton Street and New Bond Street, in London. It has moved several times since then. Hancocks has become notable for the manufacture of the Victoria Cross medals and also for the various Royal Warrants that it holds. It has been based in The Burlington Arcade in London since 1998.\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 Royal Appointments and Warrants\n\n3 S.J.Rood\n\n3.1 The \"For...\" series of rings\n\n4 Current business\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nHistory\n\nThe Great Exhibition at The Crystal Palace.\n\nHancocks first gallery opened at a corner of Bruton Street and New Bond Street, in London in 1849. Hancocks subsequently moved in 1917 to Vigo Street, in 1970 to Burlington Gardens and 1998 to its current location at 52 & 53 Burlington Arcade. Hancocks has exhibited at several renowned exhibitions. The first exhibition that Hancocks attended was The Great Exhibition of 1851 at The Crystal Palace in London. It then participated in exhibitions in Paris in 1867 and Vienna in 1873 where Hancocks was awarded medals of excellence. Hancocks continues to participate in major exhibitions such as Grosvenor House, Maastricht and New York.[1]\n\nIn 1998, Hancocks acquired the business of S.J.Rood, diamond merchants and jewellery manufacturers. S.J.Rood were themselves awarded The Royal Warrant by Queen Mary (wife of King George V) in 1921 and are famous as the creators of the “For....” series of rings which were gifted to Queen Mary’s ladies-in-waiting on their marriage.[2] Hancocks currently occupy the former S.J.Root premises in Burlington Arcade.\n\nRoyal Appointments and Warrants\n\nOn 13 August 1849, after only eight months in business, Hancocks received the Royal Appointment of Queen Victoria. Many of the principal sovereigns of Europe also became regular patrons. There can be little doubt that the rapid expansion by Charles Hancock during the formative years of the Company led to Hancocks being entrusted with the design and production of the Victoria Cross on the inception of the award in 1856.[3] This medal is still made exclusively by Hancocks.[4]\n\nIn 1962 the Company was granted the Royal Warrant as Goldsmiths and Silversmiths to Queen Elizabeth, The Queen Mother.\n\nS.J.Rood\n\nS.J. Rood was established in London’s Burlington Arcade in 1873 and operated independently until they were acquired by Hancocks in 1998. Hancocks then took over the Rood premises in Burlington Arcade from where they remain trading today.\n\nS.J.Rood was established by the Allen family who were diamond merchants in addition to their primary role as jewellery manufacturers and retailers to the rich and famous. From 1900 onwards the firm enjoyed great success with affluent Londoners and was awarded the Royal Warrant by Queen Mary, wife of George V, who reigned from 1910 until 1936 (and was then Queen Mother from 1936 until her death in 1952).\n\nQueen Mary was an excellent customer and commissioned many pieces with S.J.Rood, both for herself and as gifts for others. Many of these pieces now sell for hefty premiums when they (all too rarely) come onto the open market.\n\nS.J.Rood are perhaps most famously known as the manufacturers of the historic “For.....” series of rings which were created for Her Majesty Queen Mary and which were presented to her ladies-in-waiting on the occasion of their engagement. At least twelve rings are known to have been presented between 1918 and 1952. As Queen Mary was of German descent, her staff were a mixture of English and German ladies. As a consequence, many of the “For.....” rings are now located in either London or Bavaria.\n\nThe \"For...\" series of rings\n\nIn total, S.J.Rood made 12 rings in the \"For....\" series which are known to have been presented by Queen Mary to her ladies-in-waiting on the occasion of their engagement. These are:-\n\nThe ring \"For Mary\" - presented by Queen Mary in 1918.

Just as every Lie group has a Lie algebra, every Lie groupoid has a Lie algebroid.\n\nContents\n\n1 Examples\n\n2 Morita Morphisms and Smooth Stacks\n\n2.1 Examples\n\n3 External links\n\nExamples\n\nAny Lie group gives a Lie groupoid with one object, and conversely. So, the theory of Lie groupoids includes the theory of Lie groups.\n\nGiven any manifold {\\displaystyle M}M, there is a Lie groupoid called the pair groupoid, with {\\displaystyle M}M as the manifold of objects, and precisely one morphism from any object to any other. In this Lie groupoid the manifold of morphisms is thus {\\displaystyle M\\times M}M\\times M.\n\nGiven a Lie group {\\displaystyle G}G acting on a manifold {\\displaystyle M}M, there is a Lie groupoid called the translation groupoid with one morphism for each triple {\\displaystyle g\\in G,x,y\\in M}g \\in G, x,y \\in M with {\\displaystyle gx=y}gx = y.\n\nAny foliation gives a Lie groupoid.\n\nAny principal bundle {\\displaystyle P\\to M}P\\to M with structure group G gives a groupoid, namely {\\displaystyle P\\times P/G}P\\times P/G over M, where G acts on the pairs componentwise. Composition is defined via compatible representatives as in the pair groupoid.\n\nMorita Morphisms and Smooth Stacks\n\nSee also: differentiable stack\n\nBeside isomorphism of groupoids there is a more coarse notation of equivalence, the so-called Morita equivalence. A quite general example is the Morita-morphism of the Čech groupoid which goes as follows. Let M be a smooth manifold and {\\displaystyle \\{U_{\\alpha }\\}}\\{U_{\\alpha }\\} an open cover of M. Define {\\displaystyle G_{0}:=\\bigsqcup _{\\alpha }U_{\\alpha }}G_0:=\\bigsqcup_\\alpha U_\\alpha the disjoint union with the obvious submersion {\\displaystyle p:G_{0}\\to M}p:G_0\\to M. In order to encode the structure of the manifold M define the set of morphisms {\\displaystyle G_{1}:=\\bigsqcup _{\\alpha ,\\beta }U_{\\alpha \\beta }}G_1:=\\bigsqcup_{\\alpha,\\beta}U_{\\alpha\\beta} where {\\displaystyle U_{\\alpha \\beta }=U_{\\alpha }\\cap U_{\\beta }\\subset M}U_{\\alpha\\beta}=U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta\\subset M. The source and target map are defined as the embeddings {\\displaystyle s:U_{\\alpha \\beta }\\to U_{\\alpha }}s:U_{\\alpha\\beta}\\to U_\\alpha and {\\displaystyle t:U_{\\alpha \\beta }\\to U_{\\beta }}t:U_{\\alpha\\beta}\\to U_\\beta. And multiplication is the obvious one if we read the {\\displaystyle U_{\\alpha \\beta }}U_{\\alpha\\beta} as subsets of M (compatible points in {\\displaystyle U_{\\alpha \\beta }}U_{\\alpha\\beta} and {\\displaystyle U_{\\beta \\gamma }}U_{\\beta\\gamma} actually are the same in M and also lie in {\\displaystyle U_{\\alpha \\gamma }}U_{\\alpha\\gamma}).\n\nThis Čech groupoid is in fact the pullback groupoid of {\\displaystyle M\\Rightarrow M}M\\Rightarrow M, i.e. the trivial groupoid over M, under p. That is what makes it Morita-morphism.\n\nIn order to get the notion of an equivalence relation we need to make the construction symmetric and show that it is also transitive. In this sense we say that 2 groupoids {\\displaystyle G_{1}\\Rightarrow G_{0}}G_1\\Rightarrow G_0 and {\\displaystyle H_{1}\\Rightarrow H_{0}}H_1\\Rightarrow H_0 are Morita equivalent iff there exists a third groupoid {\\displaystyle K_{1}\\Rightarrow K_{0}}K_1\\Rightarrow K_0 together with 2 Morita morphisms from G to K and H to K. Transitivity is an interesting construction in the category of groupoid principal bundles and left to the reader.\n\nIt arises the question of what is preserved under the Morita equivalence. There are 2 obvious things, one the coarse quotient/ orbit space of the groupoid {\\displaystyle G_{0}/G_{1}=H_{0}/H_{1}}G_0/G_1 = H_0/H_1 and secondly the stabilizer groups {\\displaystyle G_{p}\\cong H_{q}}G_p\\cong H_q for corresponding points {\\displaystyle p\\in G_{0}}p\\in G_0 and {\\displaystyle q\\in H_{0}}q\\in H_0.\n\nThe further question of what is the structure of the coarse quotient space leads to the notion of a smooth stack. We can expect the coarse quotient to be a smooth manifold if for example the stabilizer groups are trivial (as in the example of the Čech groupoid). But if the stabilizer groups change we cannot expect a smooth manifold any longer. The solution is to revert the problem and to define:\n\nA smooth stack is a Morita-equivalence class of Lie groupoids. The natural geometric objects living on the stack are the geometric objects on Lie groupoids invariant under Morita-equivalence. As an example consider the Lie groupoid cohomology.\n\nExamples\n\nThe notion of smooth stack is quite general, obviously all smooth manifolds are smooth stacks.\n\nBut also orbifolds are smooth stacks, namely (equivalence classes of) étale groupoids.\n\nOrbit spaces of foliations are another class of examples\n\nАноним 07/05/20 Чтв 18:12:31 №219645279133\n\nSami Amin Al-Arian (Arabic: سامي أمين العريان‎; born January 14, 1958) is a Palestinian civil rights activist who was a computer engineering professor at University of South Florida. During the Clinton administration and Bush administration, he was invited to the White House. He actively campaigned for the Bush presidential campaign in the United States presidential election in 2000.\n\nAfter a contentious interview with Bill O'Reilly on The O'Reilly Factor following the September 11 attacks, Al-Arian's tenure at University of South Florida came under public scrutiny.\n\nHe was indicted in February 2003 on 17 counts under the Patriot Act. A jury acquitted him on 8 counts and deadlocked on the remaining 9 counts. He later struck a plea bargain and admitted to one of the remaining charges in exchange for being released and deported by April 2007. However, as his release date approached, a federal prosecutor in Virginia demanded he testify before a grand jury in a separate case, which he refused to do, claiming it would violate his plea deal. He was held under house arrest in Northern Virginia from 2008 until 2014 when federal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss charges against him.[1]\n\nHe was deported to Turkey on February 4, 2015.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life and education\n\n1.1 Kuwait and Egypt\n\n1.2 United States\n\n2 Tenured at University of South Florida\n\n3 Activism\n\n3.1 Community involvement and WISE\n\n3.2 Emerson film and investigation\n\n3.3 Citizenship\n\n3.4 Mazen Al-Najjar\n\n3.5 Political involvement\n\n3.6 Education\n\n4 O'Reilly controversy\n\n4.1 Television interview\n\n4.2 Academic freedom\n\n4.3 Loftus Lawsuit\n\n5 Indictment\n\n5.1 Indictment\n\n5.2 Trial\n\n5.3 Plea agreement\n\n5.4 Sentencing\n\n6 Civil and criminal contempt prosecutions; 2006–present\n\n6.1 Grand jury subpoenas, refusal to testify, civil contempt, and hunger strikes\n\n6.2 Criminal contempt proceedings; house arrest; deportation\n\n7 Personal life\n\n7.1 Film\n\n8 Notes\n\n9 See also\n\n10 References\n\n11 External links\n\nEarly life and education\n\nKuwait and Egypt\n\nAl-Arian was born on January 14, 1958 in Kuwait. His parents, Amin and Laila Al-Arian, were Palestinian refugees after the creation of Israel in 1948.[3][4] After the 1948 Palestine war, Amin had to leave behind the family soap factory in Jaffa and flee towards the Gaza Strip's refugee camps.[5] Amin's family migrated to Kuwait in 1957 where Sami Al-Arian was born.[5] Under Kuwaiti law, his parents had legal resident status but he was not eligible for citizenship.[6] In 1966, his family was expelled from Kuwait after refusing to become informants for Kuwaiti intelligence.[4] He received his primary and secondary education at Cairo, Egypt.[6][7] During the early 1970s, Sami learned English from American TV shows, including Kojak, Starsky and Hutch, Baretta, and The Fugitive.[5] He left Egypt in 1975, and returned in 1979 for a visit when he married Nahla Al-Najjar.[6]\n\nUnited States\n\nAmin Al-Arian used all of his life savings to send Sami to America for an education.[5] In 1975, Al-Arian came to the United States to study engineering at Southern Illinois University.[8] In 1978, he graduated with a major in Electrical Sciences and Systems Engineering.[9] At North Carolina State University, he earned his master's degree in 1980 and doctorate in 1985.[6][9]\n\nTenured at University of South Florida\n\nHe moved to Temple Terrace after he was hired as an assistant professor to teach computer engineering at University of South Florida on January 22, 1986.[6][7][10] He was granted permanent resident status for United States in March 1989.[11] He was promoted from an assistant professor to an associate professor with tenure.[6] He received many accolades relating to teaching including the Jerome Krivanek Distinguished Teacher Award in 1993 and a salary raise based on merit grades via the Teaching Incentive Program in 1994.[6]\n\nActivism\n\nCommunity involvement and WISE\n\nHe was very involved in the local community. He served as an imam for a local mosque and as a charter officer for the local religious school.[5][6] In 1992, he hosted a local cable-access show — Peace be upon you.[5]\n\nHe rose to national prominence for his pursuit of civil rights of Muslim-Americans and raising awareness of the Palestinian plight. Al-Arian criticized the peace process led by Palestinian Authority president Yasser Arafat and advocated support for the Palestinian uprisings against Israeli occupation during the 1980s and early 1990s.[12][13] On October 20, 1988, Al-Arian established the Islamic Concern Project, which included a committee devoted to raising charity for Palestine.[8][14] In 1990–91, his continued involvement in promoting dialogue between the West and Middle East[15] led to the creation of World and Islam Studies Enterprise (WISE), which served as a think tank that promoted public policy initiatives.[6][8] WISE and University of South Florida formally agreed to cooperate on March 11, 1992.[6][16][17] WISE published journals, supported graduate student education, and held seminars between American and Middle Eastern scholars.[18]\n\nEmerson film and investigation\n\nSteve Emerson published a controversial film in November 1994 that accused WISE as a terrorist front organization which Al-Arian vehemently denied.[19] In May 1995, Michael Fechter of the Tampa Tribune expanded on Emerson's film. Fechter's articles were criticized by fellow journalists for instigating bigotry through reckless journalism.[18][20] Sami Al-Arian's daughter, Laila Al-Arian, lambasted Emerson and the Tribune for publishing photographs of their home, school, and family car.[21] In November 1995, federal agents investigating \"violations of perjury and immigration laws\" searched Sami Al-Arian's home for six hours to seize bank statements dating as far back as 1986, airline passes, telephone bills, AAA travel maps, family videotapes, audiotapes, and computer disks.[8][22] A three-month independent inquiry was led by prominent Tampa lawyer and former USF President William Reece Smith that involved hundreds of documents and 59 interviews.[23] The investigation reported in May 1996 that there was \"no evidence\" to support the allegation that Al-Arian or WISE supported terrorism.[23] The report went on to conclude that University of South Florida officials acted appropriately in collaborating with WISE.[23] The 99-page report was lauded by USF President Betty Castor for its \"comprehensive, thoughtful, and detailed analysis\".[23] In June 1996, Florida universities Chancellor Charles Reed also said their investigation found no links between WISE and terror organizations.[24]\n\nIn May 1996, Villanova University canceled a seminar that involved many speakers including Al-Arian after the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) complained about the possibility of riots.[12] The Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA), the United States's largest association of Middle East scholars, approved a resolution that rebuked ADL for \"creating an atmosphere of intimidation that resulted in the cancellation of an academic event\".[25] USF placed Al-Arian on paid administrative leave in May 1996 pending the outcome of a federal investigation which had an indefinite time frame.[8] Students complained in August 1997 after a graduation requirement course taught by Al-Arian was cancelled.[26] After consultation with authorities who brought no charges after a three-year federal investigation,[27] USF decided to reinstate him in August 1998.[28]\n\nCitizenship\n\nHe applied for U.S. citizenship in January 1994. Although he was informed that he passed all of the requirements to obtain citizenship in September 1994, he was neither granted nor denied citizenship. Federal law requires notification within 120 days after the citizenship examination. In October 1995, he filed suit for a judge to award him citizenship directly.[29] His petition for citizenship was denied in March 1996 under the pretense of unlawfully voting in a 1994 Hillsborough County local election.[30][31] But a state investigation discovered no discrepancies and vindicated him because voter registration deputies gave Al-Arian the voter registration card via mail to vote in the 1994 local election.[citation needed][clarification needed]\n\nMazen Al-Najjar\n\nSami Al-Arian's brother-in-law Mazen Al-Najjar was jailed for nearly five years, accused of having links to Palestinian terrorists.[32] In May 1997, Al-Najjar was incarcerated in Miami, Florida without charge and was held in jail indefinitely on the basis of secret evidence.[13][33] Although Judge McHugh found Al-Najjar to be a respected member of a community, McHugh denied bail on the basis of secret evidence in May 1997.[13] In May 2000, U.S. district judge John A. Leonard ordered a rehearing because Al-Najjar's right to due process had been violated when the government did not cede evidence in order for Al-Najjar to defend himself.[34][35] During the first day of the rehearing in August 2000, the government called Al-Arian to testify. Several legal analysts and Al-Arian were convinced that Al-Arian, not Al-Najjar, was the focus of the Al-Najjar's court case.[36] On the advice of his attorney, Al-Arian cited the 5th Amendment to 99 of 102 questions.[34] Because Al-Najjar was a Palestinian born in Gaza during Egyptian control of the region, Al-Najjar essentially had no citizenship anywhere and the allegations that he was connected to terrorists had ruined attempts to find a country to take him, his wife, and three young daughters.[35] Al-Najjar was released in December 2000 after a judge ruled the government had no evidence to continue holding him.[37][38][notes 1] He overstayed his US student visa, and was deported in August 2002.[32]\n\nPolitical involvement\n\nInspired by Al-Najjar's predicament, Al-Arian co-founded the Tampa Bay Coalition for Peace and Justice, which focused on the use of secret evidence and other civil rights issues in Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 and Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. In 2000, Al-Arian co-founded and led the National Coalition to Protect Political Freedom.[39] Newsweek named him as a \"premier civil rights activist\" for his efforts to repeal the use of secret evidence in trials.[7]\n\nAl-Arian visited the White House four times from 1997 to 2001.[40]\n\nDuring the 2000 presidential election, Al-Arian contacted Al Gore's campaign and Bush's campaign to address the use of secret evidence to detain U.S. citizens without charge.[5] Al-Arian met Bush during a campaign stop at the Florida Strawberry Festival to remonstrate against the Clinton administration's use of secret evidence.[41] After presidential debates in which Bush decried the use of secret evidence as a form of racial profiling against Arab-Americans, Al-Arian began campaigning for Bush as the candidate most likely to end discrimination.[5] During the White House briefing that announced Bush as the winner of the election, Al-Arian received a spot in the front row for his voter outreach efforts in Florida.[5] On June 20, 2001, Al-Arian joined 160 Muslim-American activists in a White House briefing with Bush senior adviser Karl Rove.[42] But in a separate White House event on June 28, his son Abdullah – a congressional intern – made national headlines when he was escorted out by Secret Service without explanation. Twenty four Muslim community leaders walked out also to protest Abdullah's ejection.[39][40] The Secret Service later apologized for the incident citing \"confusion by one of its guards\".[40] President Bush personally apologized in a letter to Nahla and thanked the family for their charitable contributions to the Muslim communities around the world.[5]\n\nThe Tampa Bay Muslim Alliance (TBMA) and Al-Arian had helped the resettlement of 50 families fleeing from the Bosnian War. Al-Arian and other leaders of TBMA condemned the September 11 attacks in the immediate aftermath. Al-Arian encouraged the nation to pursue those responsible but simultaneously discouraged acts of war that might impact innocent people. He discouraged radio talk show hosts from spreading hate-filled rhetoric and called for national unity.[43] Al-Arian led the local Muslim community in organizing a blood drive in solidarity with the victims of September 11.\n\nAl-Arian had opposed the War in Iraq and even spoke at an anti-war rally against the war. He had also been critical of neoconservatism and the Zionist movement.[44]\n\nEducation\n\nAl-Arian co-founded the Islamic Academy of Florida. After his criminal indictment, the school dissolved itself in 2004, with the new American Youth Academy using the former Islamic Academy buildings and equipment, with most of the students remaining.[45]\n\nO'Reilly controversy\n\nTelevision interview\n\nOn September 26, 2001, Al-Arian was invited to appear on The O'Reilly Factor to discuss Arab-American reactions to the 9/11 attacks.[5][46] O'Reilly never addressed the reactions of Arab-Americans[5] and confronted Al-Arian with a 1988 recording of him shouting \"death to Israel\".[47]\n\nO'REILLY: In – in 1988, you did a little speaking engagement in Cleveland, and you were quoted as saying, \"Jihad is our path. Victory to Islam. Death to Israel. Revolution. Revolution until victory. Rolling to Jerusalem.\" Did you say that?\n\nAL-ARIAN: Let me just put it into context. When president Bush talked about crusade, we understand what he meant here. The Muslim world thought he is going to carry a cross and go invade the Muslim world and turn them into Christians. We have to understand the context. When you say \"Death to Israel\", you mean death to occupation, death to apartheid, death to oppression, death to ...

He was Nawab of Bhopal until 1971, when India abolished royal entitlements through the 26th Amendment to the Constitution of India.[4] He was an Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year in 1962, and a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1968. He published an autobiography, Tiger's Tale, in 1969. He was the manager of the India team in 1974–75, and referee for two Ashes Tests in 1993. He was later a member of the council of the Indian Premier League.[5] Mr. Pataudi was admitted to New Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on 22 September 2011 with an acute lung infection caused by chronic interstitial lung disease which prevented his lungs from exchanging oxygen properly. He died of respiratory failure the same day.[6]\n\nThe BCCI decided to start the memorial lecture after Mr Pataudi's wife and Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore wrote a letter to the BCCI President N. Srinivasan. In the letter she criticised the BCCI for delaying the decision to institute the lecture. She also requested that the 2012 India-England cricket series be named after her husband. But the BCCI at that time expressed its inability to do so since the series had already been named the Anthony De Mello Trophy to honour the first BCCI secretary Anthony de Mello.[1][7]\n\nOn the day of the memorial lecture's institution, the BCCI said in a press release,\n\n\"The annual lecture will be a part of the Indian Cricket season.

Möngke Khan, the fourth khan of the Mongol Empire, lost his life in this battle, making it the only battle where the Mongols lost their khan during their campaigns of conquest. This battle was preceded by the Siege of Baghdad in 1258. The siege of Diaoyucheng was a setback for the Mongol conquest.\n\nContents\n\n1 Background\n\n2 In Sichuan\n\n3 Defense by Yu Jie\n\n4 Offensive by Möngke\n\n5 Siege of Diaoyu Castle\n\n6 Aftermath\n\n7 References\n\nBackground\n\nThe Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan conquered vast lands and subjugated nations. Genghis Khan's last battle was fought in Western Xia but his life had come to an end before he was able to conquer it. His successors carried on his ambition. In the year 1234, the Mongols conquered the Great Jin with the assistance of the Song dynasty.[2]\n\nIn the same year, Song China attempted to take back its northern territories originally occupied by the Jin. In September 1234, the Mongols responded with the siege of Luoyang. The Song army holding Luoyang was short of food supplies. Additionally, the Mongols led the water of Yellow River into the city causing great casualties among the Song army.[3]\n\nThe fall of Luoyang was simply a prologue of a series of upcoming battles which lasted decades. The Mongols blamed the Song for \"breaking the alliance\". However, it was more of an excuse for further Mongol expeditions.\n\nIn Sichuan\n\nAfter 1234, the Mongols launched an all-out war against the Song dynasty. They attacked from both the east and west flanks, crippling the Chinese defenses. Despite these initial military successes, the Song army managed to retaliate. No significant advancement was made.\n\nUnder the command of Meng Gong, Yu Jie, and other generals, the Song army fended off the advancing Mongols. In Sichuan, Meng Gong led the Song army as it held its position against the Mongols in 1239 and 1240.\n\nDefense by Yu Jie\n\nIn 1243, Yu Jie was appointed the commander of the Song army in Sichuan.[3] When he actually came to Sichuan, he discovered that, due to the Mongol invasion, the Sichuan region was in a state of anarchy. The Song army was able to defend itself by forming smaller military units that did not have superiority over each other. In order to reverse the dire situation in Sichuan, Yu sought the advice of the people under his command. Ran Lian and Ran Pu, two hermits of Bozhou, came to his office and offered him the plan of building a castle in Hechuan. Specifically, the plan was to build a castle on Diaoyu mountain of Hechuan. Hechuan sits at the eastern entrance of Sichuan region, the Mongols had to pass it before advancing further into the interior of Sichuan. Thus, the Diaoyu mountain was a great defensive vantage point for the Song army.\n\nYu Jie ordered the construction of dozens of castles in different counties and made these castles the administrative centre of local government. All the castles that were built were situated on the tops of mountains which made them extremely formidable against any offensive.[3] Diaoyu Castle was built in March 1243 and became the administrative center of Hechuan county.[4]\n\nMeanwhile, the Mongols began to cultivate lands in occupied territories in Sichuan. This action distressed the Song army since they would not be able to recover these lost territories once the Mongols acquired a permanent source of food and supplies.\n\nOffensive by Möngke\n\nThe long-term standoff between Song and Mongols lasted till 1258. After receiving the news of Hulagu reporting the demise of Baghdad and its Khalifa, Möngke Khan decided to break the standoff by leading a large army into Sichuan himself.[1] He also ordered his younger brother Kublai to march towards Hangzhou, the capital of Song. The offensive consisted of three waves of armies. Möngke led his troop across Dasan Pass and entered the city of Hanzhong while the other two waves of advancing forces made their way to Micang pass and Mianzhou.\n\nThe resistance of the Song army in Sichuan was ineffective. By the spring of 1259, Möngke reached the city of Hechuan. In order to take Hechuan, the Mongols had to capture Diaoyu Castle.\n\nSiege of Diaoyu Castle\n\nMöngke's siege of Diaoyu Castle began sometime between 24 February and 25 March 1259. The siege lasted for approximately five months.\n\nThe commander of the Song forces in the castle was Wang Jian. Möngke sent his general Wang Dechen as the vanguard of the Mongol army. The Mongols initially tried to break the castle's gates. When this strategy was proven ineffective, they started night raids on the outer part of the castle on minor defensive structures. Although these raids surprised the Song army at first, the Mongols were not able to break into the castle. During these attempts, Wang Dechen was killed by a Song mangonel.[5]\n\nIn the seventh month of the first year of Kaiqing, Möngke had given up the plan of capturing the castle before sending the remaining forces to attack Chongqing. In the fifth month, Möngke caught an illness. His illness went on untreated. On August 11, 1259, Möngke died of disease in the Diaoyu Mountain, Hechuan. The siege ended before his death.\n\nAfter receiving the news that his brother died, Kublai decided to withdraw his troops. He threatened the Song that he would attack Lin'an, the capital of Song, to deter any possible retaliation by the Song armies.[6] His strategy proved effective. The prime minister of Song Jia Sidao soon sent his ambassador to negotiate a peace treaty.\n\nDiaoyu Castle remained in the hands of Song armies. Mongols under Kublai tried to take it in 1263 but failed again. In the following decade, the Mongols routinely returned to the castle every autumn.[7] In 1279, the garrison of Diaoyu Castle surrendered to the Mongols two months before the end of the Song dynasty.[8]\n\nAftermath\n\nFrom 1246 to 1279, the Chinese resistance to Mongol conquest in the region of Sichuan lasted 36 years. The unexpected stubborn defense of the Chinese garrison in Diaoyu Castle caused the Mongols much trouble, such as the Mongol defeat in Egypt as a result of Hulagu's sudden retreat after the death of Möngke.[9]\n\nThe death of Möngke led to the division of the Mongol Empire. Hulagu remained in Persia permanently while Kublai and Ariq Böke tried to seize the title of Khan for themselves. The Song dynasty was temporarily rescued from the brink of destruction. However, Kublai eventually marked the end of Song dynasty in the year of 1279, 20 years after the siege of Diaoyu Castle. Both events were irreversible and had great significance in Chinese, Mongolian, and world history.\n\nАноним 07/05/20 Чтв 18:16:58 №219645628147\n\nPeter J. Cutino (April 3, 1933 – September 19, 2004) was an American swimming and water polo coach and educator for over 40 years and the author of several books and numerous articles on coaching aquatic sports. In his 26 years as head coach at the University of California, Berkeley, his Cal teams won eight NCAA titles. He was the all-time winning coach in U.S. water polo history. His efforts for water sports training, development of facilities for competition and philanthropic support of athletes earned him national recognition. In 1999, the Peter J. Cutino Award was established in his honor by the San Francisco Olympic Club, and is presented annually to the top American male and female collegiate water polo players.\n\nContents\n\n1 Coaching\n\n2 Awards and honors\n\n2.1 Won by Peter Cutino\n\n2.2 Named for Peter Cutino\n\n3 Quotes\n\n4 Personal\n\n5 References\n\n6 External links\n\nCoaching\n\nCutino attended college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and received a master's degree in education in 1959. At Cal Poly, he made the varsity water polo and swimming teams, was selected three-time water polo all-conference and held multiple school records. From 1958 to 1963, Cutino was head water polo and swimming coach at Oxnard High School, where his swim teams compiled a 64–8 record and five county championships and several Southern California championships, while his water polo team went 80–12.\n\nIn 1961, his team played El Segundo High School coached by 1964 Olympic coach Uri Saari. The El Segundo team had several Olympians-to-be on its team. But Pete had home pool and the refs. Home pool had a shallow end, and both the goalie and O hole defender of Oxnard skillfully used the bottom. In a classic momentum shifting tug of war, Oxnard won.\n\nIn 1963 Cutino became head coach of both the UC Berkeley men's water polo and swimming programs. In 1974 Hall of Fame coach Nort Thornton took over the swim program, leading Cal swimmers to two national championships.\n\nCutino directed Golden Bear water polo teams to eight national championships and a 519-172-10 career record during his 25-year tenure. His last team in 1988 won a school-record 33 games on the way to a second straight NCAA title. Cutino coached 68 All-Americans, six Pac-10 and NCAA Players of the Year, and five Olympians.\n\nThe Cutino presence at Cal water polo matches was both showmanship and strategy. Known for his passion, he would pace the edge of the pool, shouting and a congratulating, and constantly working the officials. His athletes learned quickly about his training system. \"He taught us that anything worth accomplishing would not come without discomfort,\" recalls Kirk Everist, who played for Cutino at Cal and is now the head coach there. \"And he was always there to administer the discomfort.\"\n\nCutino served as head coach of the US National Team (1972–76), the US Olympic Team (1976), and the US team at the World University Games in Yugoslavia (1987). He was elected to the FINA Technical Water Polo Committee, the international governing body of the sport, as well as leadership roles in the NCAA and USA Water Polo.\n\nAfter retiring as Cal head coach in 1989, Cutino continued to conduct clinics and coached Olympic Club teams. He participated at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, as a water polo official and served as chairman of the Men’s International Olympic Committee. His special interest was advocating for construction of pools suitable for water polo and swimming training and competition. To recognize his role promoting and raising funds for Cal Aquatics, the Peter J. Cutino Scholarship Fund was established in 2003 to provide financial support to qualified UC Berkeley athletes.\n\nAwards and honors\n\nWon by Peter Cutino\n\nCollege Swim Coaches Association Master Coach Award, considered the most distinguished accolade in aquatics.\n\nFour-time NCAA and Pac-10 Coach of the Year.\n\nUC Berkeley Alumni Centennial Award and Chancellors Commendation.\n\nAIA Gold Pin award from the Association International des Arbitres\n\nSilver Pin Award from FINA\n\nCal Poly Athletics Hall of Fame, 1989.\n\nUS Water Polo Award, highest honor in the sport\n\nUniversity of California Athletic Hall of Fame, 1994\n\nUSA Water Polo Hall of Fame, 1995\n\nItalian Hall of Fame 2002\n\nUS Congressional Award, as an educator and a coach\n\nOlympic Club Hall of Fame 2007\n\nMonterey Peninsula Hall Of Fame 1999\n\nNamed for Peter Cutino\n\nPeter J Cutino Award (presented annually to outstanding collegiate male and female water polo player)\n\nCutino Cup Channel Islands Award (high school league swim champion)\n\nPeter Cutino Award (given annually to the Athlete of the Year at Monterey Peninsula College)\n\nQuotes\n\n\"Imagine for a moment that you are an athlete on a team that I coach. This is what I would say to you: youth only comes once in a lifetime. The opportunity to compete in sport is short lived, and to compete at this level is truly extraordinary. So it is important to pause for and reflect on the values and principles inherent in what you do. These principles can, depending on you, guide your future.\"\n\n\"Make your luck.\"\n\n\"To compete in sports is to eliminate the comfort zone.\"\n\n\"The opportunity to compete in sports is short-lived, and to compete at this level is truly extraordinary. So it is important to pause and reflect on the values and principles inherent in what you do. These principles can, depending on you, guide your future.\"\n\n\"If you are a champion, you become the standard, the target, and that is as it should be - in order for you to constantly develop towards excellence.\"\n\n\"Do not trade long-term values like character and dignity for temporary bravado and the in-your-face mentality.\"\n\n\"Do sports build character? I contend they reveal it.\"\n\n\"You pay a price to get there, you pay a price to stay there.\"\n\nPersonal\n\nPete Cutino grew up in and around Monterey Bay, the second of four children in Sicilian fishing family of Paul and Rose Cutino. Young Pete wanted to become a fisherman like his father, and worked on board the boat frequently as a boy. He later said many of the coaching techniques he used were learned working with his father's crew. \"They had ways of just motivating you on the boat. Everything was competition,\" he said. \"It was a macho thing...but it was exciting as hell.\" He recalled that when he was in his 40s, he came home to find his father needed another hand on the boat. \"I said, I went to the greatest university in the world, they call me professor, I'm going to take my vacation.\" There was silence. Then his father said, You gonna go fishing or you gonna be a bum?\"\n\nMonterey was home. He starred on the swim team at Monterey High School, where his wife, Louise, was a cheerleader. Leon Panetta, the former congressman and White House chief of staff, grew up, like Cutino, in the section of Monterey between Calle Principal and the Presidio, the neighborhood Cutino wrote about in his memoir Monterey: A View from Garlic Hill, a book on the local Italian-American community. In 1989 when he stepped down as UC Berkeley's head water polo coach, he returned to run the Monterey Sports Club, promoting athletics in the local community. When Pete Cutino died in 2004 at age 71, some 1200 of his former players —along with friends, family, local and national sports and community leaders — attended his memorial service.\n\nHis son, Peter J. Cutino Jr. was a two-time All-American at UC Berkeley, and helped lead the Bears to the NCAA National Championship. He was also named Pac-10 Conference Player of the Year, 1983 NCAA Collegiate Co-Player of the Year, and Co-MVP of the NCAA Tournament. Peter Cutino Jr. is the president of the Seville Water Polo Foundation.\n\nHis brother, Bert Cutino, is a successful local restaurateur, distinguished executive chef of the American Academy of Chefs and co-sponsors a national hospitality scholarship program.\n\nАноним 07/05/20 Чтв 18:18:48 №219645785152\n\nGhost Stories is an American paranormal television series that premiered on October 16, 2009 on the Travel Channel.

He married fellow Titanic survivor Eloise Hughes Smith in 1914, but divorced in 1923. [3] On December 6, 1923, Daniel married Margery Durant, daughter of automobile executive William C. Durant, and they had one daughter, Margery Randolph Daniel (November 2, 1924 – May 23, 2013). They too divorced and Daniel married Charlotte Bemiss Christian, a widow, who survived him. They had one son, Robert Williams Daniel, Jr. (March 17, 1936 – February 4, 2012).\n\nA descendant of William Randolph, his great-grandfather Peter V. Daniel, was an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court, his great-great-grandfather Edmund Randolph, was the seventh Governor of Virginia, the first Attorney General of the United States and later served as Secretary of State.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Virginia, Daniel embarked on a career in banking and management. His first job was in the traffic manager's office of the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad. His grandfather, Peter V. Daniel, Jr., had been president of the railroad from 1860 to 1871. About 1905, Daniel left RF&P and entered the insurance business, becoming attached to the firm of Williams and Hart. He eventually succeeded Williams as district superintendent for the Maryland Life Insurance Company. In 1906, Daniel and a fellow district manager of Maryland Life, Charles Palmer Stearns, formed the insurance firm Daniel and Stearns.\n\nBy 1911, Daniel was employed as a banker and living in Philadelphia. Business travel sometimes took him to Europe. In late 1911 while staying at the Carlton Hotel in London, the building caught fire and Daniel managed to save the life of a friend who was also staying at the hotel.[2]\n\nSurvivor of the RMS Titanic\n\nDaniel boarded the RMS Titanic in Southampton as a first-class passenger on the morning of 10 April 1912 to return to Philadelphia from a business trip to London. He paid £30 10s (approximately USD$3,855 in 2020) for his ticket and was assigned one of the first-class staterooms at the forward end of Titanic's A-Deck.[4] He brought along his champion French bulldog, named Gamin de Pycombe, which he had recently purchased for £150 (the equivalent of about $18,960 in 2020).[5][6][7][8] Later that evening when the ship stopped in Cherbourg, Daniel sent a brief three word telegram to his mother in Richmond to let her know he was \"on board Titanic.\"[9] His dog was lost in the sinking.[2]\n\nDaniel survived the tragedy, though the exact manner of his escape from Titanic remains a mystery and there is confusion over what lifeboat Daniel was rescued in. Press reports varied; at least one account claimed that he swam completely nude in the frigid North Atlantic for a number of hours before being hauled aboard a lifeboat barely conscious. It is much more plausible, given the below freezing water temperature, that Daniel simply climbed into one of the early lifeboats being launched from the starboard side of the stricken liner. "
