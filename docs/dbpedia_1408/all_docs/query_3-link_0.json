The tournament is contested between teams representing the six states of Australia. The Sheffield Shield is named after Lord Sheffield.\n\nPrior to the Shield being established, a number of intercolonial matches were played. The Shield, donated by Lord Sheffield, was first contested during the 1892–93 season, between New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria. Queensland was admitted for the 1926–27 season, Western Australia for the 1947–48 season, and Tasmania for the 1977–78 season.\n\nThe competition is contested in a double-round-robin format, with each team playing every other team twice, i.e. home and away. Points are awarded based on wins, draws, ties and bonus points for runs and wickets in a team's first 100 batting and bowling overs, with the top two teams playing a final at the end of the season. Regular matches last for four days; the final lasts for five days.\n\nThe Sheffield Shield is supported by a Second XI reserves competition.\n\nHistory of Australia cricket\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1891–92 the Earl of Sheffield was in Australia as the promoter of the English team led by W. G. Grace. The tour included three Tests played in Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide.\n\nAt the conclusion of the tour, Lord Sheffield donated £150 to the New South Wales Cricket Association to fund a trophy for an annual tournament of intercolonial cricket in Australia. The three colonies of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia were already playing each other in ad hoc matches. The new tournament commenced in the summer of 1892–93, mandating home and away fixtures between each colony each season. The three teams competed for the Sheffield Shield, named after its benefactor. A Polish immigrant, Phillip Blashki,[1] won the competition to design the trophy, a 43 in × 30 in (109 cm × 76 cm) silver shield.\n\nThe competition therefore commenced some 15 years after Australia's first Test match.\n\nIn 1999, the Australian Cricket Board (now Cricket Australia) announced a sponsorship deal which included renaming the Sheffield Shield to the Pura Milk Cup, then to the Pura Cup the following season.[2] Pura is a brand name of National Foods, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bega Cheese. The sponsorship increased total annual prize money to A$220,000, with the winners receiving A$75,000 and the runners up A$45,000.\n\nOn 16 July 2008 it was announced that Weet-Bix would take over sponsorship of the competition from the start of the 2008–09 season, and that the name would revert to the \"Sheffield Shield\" or the \"Sheffield Shield presented by Weet-Bix\".[3] Weet-bix is a cereal biscuit manufactured by Sanitarium Health Food Company.\n\nIn the 2019–20 season, Marsh took over the sponsorship for the competition. This followed Marsh & McLennan Companies' acquisition of JLT, which had sponsored the competition since 2017.\n\nTeams\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1977–78, all six states of Australia have fielded their own team. There is no team for any of the territories. Details of each team are set out below.\n\nTeam name\n\nTeam nickname Home ground/s[a] Inaugural season First title Last title Shield titles Wooden spoons Team captain/s New\n\nSouth\n\nWales\n\nBlues[b]\n\nDrummoyne Oval\n\nNorth Dalton Park\n\nBankstown Oval\n\nSydney Cricket Ground\n\n1892–93 1895–96 2019–20 47 12 Kurtis Patterson Queensland\n\nBulls[c]\n\nAllan Border Field\n\nBrisbane Cricket Ground\n\n1926–27 1994–95 2020–21 9 24 Usman Khawaja South\n\nAustralia\n\nRedbacks[d]\n\nAdelaide Oval\n\nKaren Rolton Oval\n\n1892–93 1893–94 1995–96 13 49 Travis Head Tasmania\n\nTigers\n\nBellerive Oval\n\n1977–78 2006–07 2012–13 3 14 Matthew Wade Victoria\n\nBushrangers[e]\n\nJunction Oval\n\nMelbourne Cricket Ground\n\n1892–93 1892–93 2018–19 32 18 Peter Handscomb Western\n\nAustralia\n\nWarriors[f]\n\nPerth Stadium\n\nWACA Ground\n\n1947–48 1947-48 2023–24 18 5 Mitchell Marsh\n\nVenues\n\n[edit]\n\nBelow are the venues that will host Sheffield Shield matches during the 2022–23 season.\n\nAdelaide Oval Allan Border Field Blundstone Arena Citi Power Centre Adelaide, South Australia Brisbane, Queensland Hobart, Tasmania Melbourne, Victoria Capacity: 53,500 Capacity: 6,500 Capacity: 20,000 Capacity: 7,000 Drummoyne Oval The Gabba Karen Rolten Oval Melbourne Cricket Ground Sydney, New South Wales Brisbane, Queensland Adelaide, South Australia Melbourne, Victoria Capacity: 5,500 Capacity: 42,000 Capacity: 5,000 Capacity: 100,024 North Dalton Park Sydney Cricket Ground WACA Ground Wollongong, New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales Perth, Western Australia Capacity: 5,500 Capacity: 48,000 Capacity: 24,000\n\nCompetition format\n\n[edit]\n\nEach side has played each other both home and away every season with the following exceptions:\n\nSouth Australia had no home game with: Victoria in 1901–02 or 1903–04; either opponent in 1907–08; New South Wales in 1910–11.\n\nQueensland and South Australia played only once (in South Australia) in 1926–27.\n\nWestern Australia played each team only once from their debut in 1946–47 until 1955–56 inclusive.\n\nTasmania played each team only once from their debut in 1977–78 until 1981–82 inclusive.\n\nIn 2019–20 the season was curtailed after nine rounds due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[6]\n\nThe 2020–21 season was heavily affected by COVID-19 lockdowns, with QLD playing 9 games, Tasmania and South Australia 8, and Western Australia, New South Wales and Victoria playing 7 each. Unusually for the Sheffield Shield, Victoria and New South Wales played each other 3 times during the home and away portion of the season.\n\nWhere the teams played an unequal number of games, their final points were calculated on a pro-rata basis.\n\nMatches were timeless (i.e. played to an outright result, weather and schedule permitting) up to 1926–27. A four-day time limit has applied since 1927–28.[7]\n\nIn 1940–41, however, the Sheffield Shield was not contested but ten first-class “friendly” matches were played between the States for patriotic funds;[8] however financially these were unsuccessful.[9]\n\nThe Sheffield Shield was not contested during the 1941–42 Australian first-class season - instead an “Interstate Patriotic Competition” was held, with all proceeds going to the war effort. Only one match was played (Queensland v NSW at the Gabba) before the competition was cancelled due to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour on December 7, 1941.[10]\n\nFinal\n\n[edit]\n\nSince 1982–83, the top two teams after the home and away rounds have met in a final, played over five days at the home ground of the top-ranked team. Between 1982–83 and 2017–18, in the event of a draw or tie, the Shield was awarded to the top-ranked team.[7] Since the 2018–19 summer, in the event of a draw or tie, the team which scores more first innings bonus points, based on the system used in regular season matches, wins the Shield.[11] No final was played in 2019–20 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[12]\n\nPoints system\n\n[edit]\n\nA number of different systems have been used over the years. Currently, points are awarded for each match during the home and away season according to the following table.\n\nResult Points [13] An outright win (irrespective of the first innings result) 6 A tie (irrespective of the first innings result) 3 An outright loss (irrespective of the first innings result) 0 Abandoned or drawn matches (irrespective of the first innings result) 1 Bonus batting .01 for every run above 200 in the first 100 overs of the first innings of each team only Bonus bowling 0.1 for taking each wicket in the first 100 overs of the first innings of each team only\n\nBonus point example – If after 100 overs the score is 8/350, the batting team would receive 1.5 points ([350 − 200] × 0.01), and the bowling side would receive 0.8 points (0.1 for each wicket)\n\nQuotient (team's batting average divided by its bowling average) is used to separate teams which finish on an equal number of points.\n\nTeams can be penalised points for failing to maintain an adequate over rate.\n\nThe bonus bowling points were modified for the 2016–17 season. For the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons, the bowling team received 0.5 points for taking the 5th, 7th and 9th wickets (a maximum 1.5 points).\n\nPrevious systems\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Shield was initially envisaged as a match-by-match challenge trophy; it was originally determined on 4 January 1893 that it would first be awarded to the winner of the next inter-colonial match (which was, in fact, the fourth of the season), and then would pass in perpetuity to any team which defeated the holder of the trophy;[14] But on 30 January, it was decided instead to award the Shield to the team which won the most intercolonial matches across the season.[15]\n\nThe quotient has been used as a tie-breaker for teams on equal points since 1893–94.\n\nFirst innings points were introduced in 1932–33 and used until 1970–71.[16][17]\n\nBonus points for first innings batting and bowling were used from 1971–72 to 1980–81 inclusive. During the first 100 (eight-ball) overs of each side's first innings, a maximum of 10 batting bonus points could be attained. They were awarded for every 25 runs scored from 175 to 400 inclusive. A maximum of 5 bowling bonus points were available, initially upon capture of the second, fourth, sixth, eighth and last wickets. This was later changed to wickets 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 as batting teams often declared when 9 wickets down to deny the bowling side the additional bonus point.\n\nCompetition placings\n\n[edit]\n\nPrior to the introduction of a Final in 1982–83, the team with most points after the home and away rounds was declared the winner. With the introduction of the Final, the top team hosts the second placed team in a five-day match. Until 2018–19, the visiting team was required to win the Final to win the championship; the home team won the championship in the event of a tied or drawn Final. Since the 2018–19 summer, in the event of a draw or tie, the team which scores more first innings bonus points, based on the system used in regular season matches, wins the Shield. Further details including match scorecards are available at Cricinfo[18] and the Cricket Archive.[19]\n\n1892–93 to 1925–26\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason Winner Second Third 1892–93 Victoria South Australia New
