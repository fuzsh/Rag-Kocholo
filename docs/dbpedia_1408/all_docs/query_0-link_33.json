        "text": "Watch WNCL here on Kayo and scroll down for all the news you need to know.\n\nAlyssa Healy, Ellyse Perry and Beth Mooney have all stepped out for their states to begin the summer with the opening matches of the WNCL set to continue this week.\n\nPerry starting her summer with 117 not out against South Australia sharing an unbeaten 209-run partnership with star of the future Annabel Sutherland (110 not out from 101). Beth Mooney also made a statement, in her second match for her new state, smashing 151 not out for WA.\n\nWhat has changed this season?\n\nFollowing two Covid-interrupted seasons the Women’s National Cricket League returns to a full schedule with every team playing the other twice, for the first time since season 2009-10, but will not be home and away.\n\nWho are the defending champions?\n\nTasmania who defeated South Australia in the final, at Blundstone Arena, late March.\n\nIt was a momentous first title for the Tigers’ women.\n\nWho has the most titles?\n\nThe NSW Breakers hold the record winning 20 of the first 24 editions, making the Grand Final in each of those seasons.

With a number of player movements. The Perth Scorchers are the defending champions.\n\nFull fixture list here.\n\nHow each WNCL squad stacks up?\n\nACT Meteors\n\nAngela Reakes, Katie Mack, Kayla Burton, Gabrielle Sutcliffe, Chloe Rafferty, Carly Leeson, Matilda Lugg, Olivia Porter, Rebecca Carter, Amy Yates, Zoe Cooke, Holly Ferling, Alisha Bates, Angelina Genford and Annie Wikman.\n\nFormer Australian pace bowler Holly Ferling is a key recruit making the switch from Queensland.\n\nNew South Wales Breakers\n\nAlyssa Healy, Jade Allen, Maitlan Brown, Erin Burns, Stella Campbell, Lauren Cheatle, Hannah Darlington, Ashleigh Gardner, Saskia Horley, Emma Hughes, Sammy Jo-Johnson, Anika Learoyd, Phoebe Litchfield, Claire Moore, Lauren Smith and Tahlia Wilson.\n\nHuge change with Rachael Haynes retiring from domestic one-day and international cricket on the eve of the season. Talented young batter Rachel Trenaman heading to Tasmania is the only other major change replaced by Saskia Horley on the full-time list.\n\nQueensland Fire\n\nLucy Hamilton, Nicola Hancock, Grace Harris, Laura Harris, Mikayla Hinkley, Ellie Johnston, Ruth Johnston, Jess Jonassen, Charli Knott, Caitlin Mair, Grace Parsons, Georgia Prestwidge, Georgia Redmayne, Courtney Sippel and Georgia Voll.\n\nFast bowler Nicola Hancock joins the Fire and many of her Brisbane Heat teammates at the Queensland Fire. Hancock took a wicket in each of her first two matches for Queensland. Georgia Voll, 19, announced herself against NSW in the opening match of the season with 145 from 161 deliveries.\n\nSouth Australia Scorpions\n\nJemma Barsby, Sam Betts, Darcie Brown, Emma de Broughe, Josie Dooley, Ellie Falconer, Paris Hall, Brooke Harris, Tahlia McGrath, Annie O‘Neil, Bridget Patterson, Madeline Penna, Kate Peterson, Megan Schutt, Courtney Webb, Amanda-Jade Wellington and Ella Wilson.\n\nPowerful middle-order batter for the ACT Meteors and Adelaide Strikers Madeline Penna makes the move south. Penna failed to make an impression in her first two games, but Tahlia McGrath certainly did, carrying her state over the line with 111 not out in South Australia’s first game of the season against Victoria.\n\nTasmania Tigers\n\nNicola Carey, Julia Cavanough, Maisy Gibson, Heather Graham, Emma Manix-Geeves, Sasha Moloney, Clare Scott, Hayley Silver-Holmes, Amy Smith, Naomi Stalenberg, Molly Strano, Emma Thompson, Rachel Trenaman, Elyse Villani and Callie Wilson.\n\nTrenaman, 21, is the biggest addition following the arrival of Australian players Elyse Villani and Molly Strano the previous season.

She already has a century to her name, but the star for WA in their opening two wins against ACT was undoubtedly leg-spinner Alan King with eight for 43 across the two matches, including 5/12 in the first.\n\nVictoria\n\nTiana Atkinson, Sam Bates, Makinley Blows, Lucy Cripps, Sophie Day, Nicole Faltum, Tess Flintoff, Kim Garth, Ella Hayward, Olivia Henry, Rhys McKenna, Sophie Molineux, Rhiann O‘Donnell, Ellyse Perry, Sophie Reid, Annabel Sutherland, Tayla Vlaeminck and Georgia Wareham.\n\nCaptain Meg Lanning is the biggest name missing after deciding to take an indefinite break from cricket due to personal reasons.\n\nWhere can you watch more domestic cricket?\n\nYou can watch much of the WNCL season and more domestic men’s cricket live on Kayo.\n\nLatest cricket news I need to know\n\nFor all the latest cricket news and features from around the world, visit CODE Sports here.\n\nUPCOMING CRICKET FIXTURES\n\nFor extensive, searchable and time zone-accurate fixture information for all sports, go to Fixture Calendar."
