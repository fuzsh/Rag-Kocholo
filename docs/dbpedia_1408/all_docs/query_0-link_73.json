        "text": "David Andrew Warner is an Australian cricketer. A quick-scoring left-handed opening batsman, Warner is the first Australian cricketer in 132 years to be selected for a national team in any format without experience in first-class cricket.[1] He plays for New South Wales, Durham and the Delhi Daredevils.[2]\n\nContents\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 Career\n\n2.1 Indian Premier League\n\n2.2 KFC Big Bash\n\n2.3 English County Cricket 2009\n\n3 Sponsorship\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nEarly life\n\nDavid Andrew Warner was born on 27 October 1986 at Paddington in Sydney.[3]\n\nAt the age of 13 Warner was asked by his coach to switch to right-handed batting because he kept hitting the ball in the air. However one season later he went back to batting left-handed and broke the U/16's run scoring record for the Sydney Coastal Cricket Club. He then made his first grade debut for the Eastern Suburbs club at the age of 15 and later toured Sri Lanka with the Australian under-19s and earned a rookie contract with NSW.[4]\n\nWarner attended Matraville Public School and Randwick Boys High School.[citation needed]\n\nCareer\n\nWarner is known for favouring the aerial route with his aggressive left-handed batting style, and ability to switch hit, using the back of his bat or by taking a right-handed stance. He is an athletic fielder and also a part-time spin bowler. His bowling style is unique in that he mixes off-spin bowling with his more usual leg-spin bowling. At just 170cms Warner generates his power from strong forearms and uses his low centre of gravity to get underneath deliveries and hit them high in the air. In a Twenty20 match for New South Wales in 2009, he hooked a six off Shaun Tait that landed on the roof of the Adelaide Oval, only a month after hooking the same bowler 20 rows back at the SCG.[5]\n\nWarner's break through innings for the New South Wales Blues came against Tasmania when he smashed 165* to record the highest one day score by a Blues player ever.[6] Warner later backed this up with a 54-ball 97 also against Tasmania to narrowly miss the record for the fastest ever century in Australian domestic cricket.[7]\n\nThis introduction to the domestic scene led to Warner being included in Australia's Twenty20 squad in January 2009. [8] Warner made his international debut for Australia in a Twenty20 International against South Africa at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on 11 January 2009. He made an immediate impact, scoring 89 off 43 balls with 7 fours and 6 sixes, including the then second-fastest fifty in Twenty20 International history.[9] Warner was just 11 runs short of becoming only the second player after Chris Gayle to score a Twenty20 International century. His 89 was the second highest score on Twenty20 international debut; and the equal fifth highest score ever in Twenty20 internationals.[10] On 23 February 2010, playing a Twenty20 international against the West Indies at the SCG, he made a stunning 67 off just 29 balls. His 50 coming in at just 18 balls, breaking his old record of 19 and it became the second fastest 50 in Twenty20 International history after Yuvraj Singh.[11]\n\nWarner finally made his first-class debut playing for New South Wales against Western Australia in the final match of the 2008–09 Sheffield Shield competition at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 5–8 March 2009. Batting only once and coming in at number six in the batting order, Warner scored 42 runs off 48 deliveries.[12]\n\nOn 7 October 2011, Warner became the first cricketer to score consecutive Twenty20 hundreds, when he followed up an unbeaten 135 against Chennai Super Kings with an unbeaten 123 against Royal Challengers Bangalore. Both matches were in the Champions League. [13]\n\nIndian Premier League\n\nWarner was signed by IPL team Delhi Daredevils for the 2009–10 seasons.[14] During the 2009 tournament which was played in South Africa, Warner played in seven games, scoring 163 runs at an average of 23.28 and with a strike-rate of 123.48. His top score was 51.[15]\n\nIn the fourth season, Warner was contracted by Delhi Daredevils for US$750,000.\n\nKFC Big Bash\n\nWarner made a record in KFC Big bash by completing his half century in 18 balls against Tasmania. The earlier record was held by George Bailey, who completed his half century in 19 balls.\n\nEnglish County Cricket 2009\n\nWarner is played for English County Champions Durham for the English cricket domestic season.[16]\n\nHe is sponsored by Gray-Nicolls, and has trialled their unique double-sided bat in the domestic competition. He uses a bat from the Kaboom range and has pads and gloves from the Ignite range. He has previously used bats from the Ignite range.\n\nReferences\n\nPlayer profile: David Warner from ESPNcricinfo\n\nPlayer Profile: David Warner from CricketArchive"
