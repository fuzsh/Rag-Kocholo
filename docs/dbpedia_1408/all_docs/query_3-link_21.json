        "text": "Nathan Michael Hauritz ( ; born 18 October 1981) is a former Australian cricketer who has represented Australia in Tests, One-dayers and Twenty20 Internationals. He is mainly noted for his off spin bowling. He was a part of the Australian squad which won the 2003 Cricket World Cup.\n\nAfter representing Australia at Under-19 level and making his ODI debut in 2002 at the age of 20, Hauritz made his Test debut in 2004 in India, where he turned out a credible performance. Upon his return to Australia, however, his form at first class level did not live up to expectations and as a result he found himself out of the Australian side and struggling to hold a place in the Queensland side. As a result, he switched to playing State cricket for New South Wales in the 2006–07 season. Nevertheless, even after the move Hauritz's opportunities to play regularly in senior cricket were limited.\n\nOn the eve of the 2nd Test against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval in November 2008, Hauritz found himself unexpectedly called into the Australian side, four years after making his debut, as Australia searched for a spinner to replace Shane Warne. He went on to play three Tests during the 2008–09 Australian home season and was subsequently selected for Australia's tour to South Africa. Although he did not play in any of the Tests, he played in all of the One Day Internationals. Later during Australia's one-day series against Pakistan, Hauritz was Australia's leading wicket-taker. These performances were enough for the Australian selectors to include Hauritz in the squad for the 2009 Ashes series."
