Opener James Smith scored a maiden first-class century as South Australia dominated the second day of the Sheffield Shield match against Tasmania in Adelaide.

The 21-year-old scored 116 off 189 deliveries, steering the Redbacks to 4 for 225 at stumps in reply to the Tigers' 236 at the Adelaide Oval.

Mark Cosgrove was 46 not out at the close.

Smith's innings easily eclipsed his previous best of 50, also scored against the Tigers last season.

He put on 94 for the opening wicket with Daniel Harris, who scored 29.

Last year's leading domestic run-scorer Michael Klinger had a poor start to the campaign, bowled by Tigers off spinner Jason Krejza for 3.

Krejza has 3 for 43 for the visitors.

Tasmania's first innings total would have been even smaller save for a fighting unbeaten 45 from debutant wicketkeeper Brady Jones.

Former Tigers bowler Chris Duval claimed 2 for 39 for the Redbacks, while Peter George, Dan Christian and part-timer Mark Cosgrove also took two wickets apiece.
