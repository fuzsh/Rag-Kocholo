Australian Twenty20 legspinner Cameron Boyce has quit Queensland cricket to make the fulltime move to Tasmania. Boyce, who already plays for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League, played just one Sheffield Shield match for the Bulls last summer following the emergence of rookie Mitchell Swepson.

The 26-year-old will likely become Tasmania’s first-choice wrist-spinner as he looks to press for further international honours. “As a coach you don’t like to see players leave the squad but you also don’t want to stand in the way of people pursuing their goals and making the best of their skills,” Queensland coach Phil Jaques said.

Boyce has played seven T20 internationals for Australia, but was controversially overlooked for Australia’s doomed World T20 campaign in India last month. He has taken 92 wickets in 45 first-class matches for Queensland and Australia A, including a five-wicket haul in the final of his rookie 2009-10 season.

Boyce will be joined in Tasmania by fellow Queenslander Simon Milenko, the all-rounder having made the decision to leave the Bulls after four first-class matches. The Tigers also confirmed the signing of Victorian Premier League cricketers Cameron Stevenson, Andrew Perrin and Jake Hancock, ACT allrounder Mac Wright and locals Corey Murfet and Cameron Wheatley.
