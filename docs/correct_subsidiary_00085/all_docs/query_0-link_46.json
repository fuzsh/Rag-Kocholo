He was executive vice president for global operations at VeriFone, executive chairman of LeadCom Integrated Solutions Ltd., is a director of Frutarom Industries Ltd., and was a director for Retalix Ltd. in 2012 until it was acquired in 2013.\n\nAngel also has been active in managing his own investments and supporting philanthropic endeavors in recent years, according to the Ormat release.\n\nBronicki called Angel a proven leader and Gillon Beck, Ormat’s board chairman, added that Angel is talented, experienced and a visionary executive.\n\n“Ormat,” said Angel, “is well positioned to generate strong growth on both the electricity and products sides of its business.”"
