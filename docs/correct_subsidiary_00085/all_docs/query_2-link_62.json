Regulatory requirement that U.S. applicants be rejected solely for lawful job-related reasons\n\nBurden is on the employer to show applicant is rejected for other than lawful, job-related reasons. Employer did not meet burden because she relied on unavailability of the applicant but she spoke only with the applicant's stepfather. Further, a letter sent by the employer's agent stating that Employer's side of a conflicting account of an interview is not persuasive. Louise M. Borg , 94-INA-570 (Nov. 26, 1996).\n\nWhere Employer rejected an applicant for the position of \"roofing mechanic\" because \"he does not have no experience in E.P.D.M., wood shingles or slate shingles,\" but the applicant alleged to have had 20 years of roofing experience, labor certification was properly denied because \"Employer has not provided an objective, detailed basis for its conclusion\" that the applicant was not qualified. See Impell Corp. , 88-INA-298 (May 31, 1989); Japan Budget Travel Int'l , 90-INA-277(Oct. 7, 1991). Rafa's Roofing, 95-INA-287 (Dec. 19, 1996).\n\nII. Qualifications of U.S. applicants, generally\n\nA. Applicant meets minimum requirements\n\nLabor certification is properly denied where Employer rejected a U.S. worker who met the stated minimum requirements for the job. Sterik Co. , 93-INA-252 (Apr. 19, 1994). See also Cynthia arks , 93-INA-209 (Aug. 16, 1994); Ronell's Stores, Inc. , 93-INA-352 (Sep. 29, 1994)(applicant meets alternate experience requirement); International Printing Translation and Publishing Co. , 93- INA-326 (Oct. 11, 1994); Santa Barbara Immigration Ctr. , 93-INA-559 (Nov. 30, 1994)(contrary to employer's assertion, applicant appeared to meet immigration-law experience requirement); ABC Home Video Corp. , 93-INA-480 (Nov. 16, 1994)(applicants meet alternate experience requirement); Bankers Trust Co. , 93-INA-486 (Nov. 16, 1994); Conrad's, Inc. , 93-INA-495 (Mar. 22, 1995)(as applicant's resume indicates accounting experience with store selling women's and men's apparel, without further investigation employer cannot reject applicant as having no related background experience in retail fashion industry); Picasso Travel , 93-INA-562 (Mar. 31, 1995)(two applicants who were rejected met the requirements for a tour director to Turkey); Francisco Potestas , 94- INA-204 (Apr. 26, 1995).\n\nLabor certification was properly denied where Employer rejected two U.S. applicants who met the minimum requirements. The panel did not accept Employer's contention that while the applicants met the three month experience requirement they were nevertheless properly rejected because that experience was too remote to be considered. The panel noted that the job duties mainly involved loading and unloading trucks and that it was purely speculative for employer to conclude that the applicants would be unable to perform the job due to remoteness of experience. Lyndhurst Trading Corp. , 93-INA-37 (Mar. 25, 1994).\n\nIn light of employer's subsequent concession that the U.S. applicants education and experience was beyond the minimum requirements for the job, Employer unlawfully rejected the applicant prior to interview because the applicant's resume failed to specify the required B.S. degree in Production/Industrial. Engineering CSC Partners , 92-INA- 433 (Aug. 16, 1994).\n\nLabor certification was properly denied where applicant's resume lists minimum requirements for the job and employer's assertion that applicant is unqualified was not supported by any objective evidence. A.E.W. North Am., Ltd. , 93-INA-471 (Oct. 31, 1994).\n\nEmployer unlawfully rejected qualified U.S. workers and labor certification was properly denied where the CO reviewed the resumes of U.S. applicants and determined that their particularly stated Master's degrees should have been considered qualifying. The panel found that, essentially, the CO challenged Employer's degree requirement as unduly restrictive and afforded employer the opportunity to change the requirement or provide business necessity. The fact that the CO made this determination after reviewing the qualifications of U.S. applicants did not mean that the CO improperly substituted her judgement for employer's unchallenged job requirements as precluded by Bronx Medical and Dental Clinic , 90-INA-479 (Oct. 30, 1992)(en banc). The panel distinguished this situation from one described in AFS Intercultural Programs , 92-INA-358 (May 11, 1994), where the CO's challenge of the minimum requirements was \"inextricably linked\" to review of U.S. applicants properly rejected for not meeting the otherwise acceptable minimum requirements. Here, unlike in AFS , employer admitted that the particular degree requirement was unduly restrictive but was unable to convincingly explain why it would not expand the degree requirement as instructed. Council on Int'l Educ. , 93-INA-136 (Nov. 10, 1994).\n\nLabor certification properly denied where applicant meets the minimum requirements for a basic Jeweler position. Employer's objection that applicant does not possess specific \"form modeling\" experience appears unfounded as the basic duties already possessed by the applicant seem to include such \"form modeling\" experience. Alternately, even if the applicant did not possess specific \"form modeling\" experience, it is evident that he meets the minimum requirements for a basic jeweler, and as there need not be a complete matching of duties between the job offered and the applicants experience, rejection of applicant unlawful. Pronto Jewelry , 94-INA-68 (Nov. 30, 1994).\n\nLabor certification properly denied where U.S. applicant was rejected for not meeting the employer's two year training requirement and the CO properly concluded that the applicant was nevertheless qualified for the position pursuant to section 656.24(b)(2)(ii). The panel noted that the applicant in fact graduated from the same training course cited to by Employer to justify its two year requirement; the fact that the applicant completed the course in 18 months does not obviate that the applicant is qualified for the position. Marriot Food Serv. , 94-INA-233 (Apr. 17, 1995).\n\nLabor certification is properly denied where the employer rejected a U.S. worker who met the stated minimum requirements for the job. Banque Francaise Du Commerce Exterieur , 93- INA-44 (Dec. 7, 1993)(applicant meets primary and alternative minimum requirements for V.P./Financial Analyst position); State of California, Bd. of Equalization , 93-INA-42 (Dec. 7, 1993); Centurian Technology Sys., Inc. , 92- INA-314 (Dec. 15, 1993); Crown Cork & Seal, Inc. , 92-INA-292 (Oct. 26 1993); Kam Kuo Foods Corp. , 92-INA-395 (Oct. 25, 1993); Newtown Metal Corp. , 92-INA-350 (Sept. 29, 1993); Petrossian, Inc. , 92-INA-41 (Sept. 1, 1993); Sparks Steak House , 92-INA-29 (Aug. 25, 1993); Jacob Camrad , 92-INA-379 (July 28, 1993) (employer conceded applicant met the job requirements); Andre's Hungarian Pastries, Inc. , 93-INA-85 (Jan. 4, 1994); Y. Moussaieff (U.S.A.) Ltd. , 92INA-244 (July 26, 1993); Brennan, Beer, Gorman Architects , 92-INA-300 (July 1, 1993); Managment & Hotel Assoc. , 90-INA-150 (June 16, 1993); Celini P.V.C. , 92-INA-233 (May 28, 1993); California Dept. of Food & Agriculture , 91-INA-292 (Oct. 28, 1992); Senior's Too, Inc. , 91-INA-244 (Aug. 28, 1992); International Camera & Electronics , 90-INA-500 (Aug. 31, 1992); Empress Foods, Inc. , 91-INA-235 (Sept. 1, 1992); Obermeyer Ski Wear , 91-INA-268 (Aug. 14, 1992) (rejection for lack of knowledge in outerwear or ski wear unlawful where job description required \"only experience in the garment industry as a whole\"); Juzcel anagement, Inc ., 90-INA-107 (Aug. 4, 1992); Chi W. Cheung , 91-INA-249 (July 21, 1992); Joseph General Elec. Contractor , 91-INA-173 (July 14, 1992); G & T Children's Wear, Inc ., 90-INA-594 (June 30, 1992); Kem Medical Products, Corp ., 91-INA-196 (June 30, 1992); Cristina McGinniss , 91-INA-191 (June 30, 1992); Croissant Show, Inc ., 91-INA-38 (June 19, 1992); John Hancock Financial Serv. , 91-INA-131 (June 4, 1992); Lifeline Health Serv. Int'l Corp. , 91-INA-113 (May 18, 1992); Pan Am. Diamond Corp. , 90-INA-445 (May 14, 1992); Deloitte Touche & Co. , 91-INA-35 (May 13, 1992); Danbury Hilton Inn , 90-INA-281 (Apr. 17, 1992); Joy Kesaris , 93-INA-156 (April 8, 1994); Eileen Mayo Ames , 93-INA-176 (May 28, 1994).\n\nLabor certification was properly denied where the employer rejected U.S. workers for failure to meet a foreign language requiement which Employer conceded was mistakenly omitted from the ETA-750 and advertisements. Arnold Shapiro Prod., Inc. , 92-INA-77 (July 19, 1993).\n\nHowever, an employer may reject a U.S. worker who meets the minimum specified requirements where Employer provides an objective, detailed basis for concluding that the applicant could not perform the core job duties. Therefore, a panel concluded that \"[a]lthough the U.S. applicant has many years of engineering experience none involve(d) the core duties for the job, which entail design and analysis of pipeline systems. Formosa Plastics Corp., U.S.A. , 91-INA-141 (Aug. 14, 1992). See also Ahn & Han Architects , 91-INA-229 (Mar. 25, 1993) (applicant not have experience in core job duties of planning, designing, and furnishing residential and commerical buildings); C.W. Designs , 91-INA-287 (Dec. 11, 1992) (in assessing an applicant's experience, \"the relevant inquiry is whether the U.S. worker has had experience in the duties described, not whether she was employed with a specific job title\"); A.V. Giordano Co. , 91-INA-298 (Nov. 30, 1992); Barolo Ltd. , 91-INA-261 (Oct. 5, 1992); D'Alem Const. Corp. , 91-INA-258 (Aug. 5, 1992).\n\nEmployer could not reject U.S. workers for lack of experience in each duty listed where it required experience in the job offered or, in the alternative, two years of experience in any combination of office, supervisory, or maintenance work which is a more generalized requirement. Total Bldg. Maintenance, Inc. , 90-INA-473 (Apr. 12, 1993).\n\nThe employer unlawfully rejected U.S. workers for lack of stenographic abilities where the ETA-750 and job advertisements did not contain this requirement. Motor Club of Am. , 91-INA-146 (Oct. 31, 1992).\n\nApplicants were unlawfully rejected for the job of Group Teacher based upon unstated requirements of \"courses in Early Childhood Education, 150 hours of student teaching on the pre-school level and approval by the N.Y. City Department of Health.\" Robert F. Kennedy Day Care Ctr. , 92-INA-293 (June 1, 1993).\n\nThe employer unlawfully rejected a U.S. worker with one and one-half years of experience as a Kitchen Helper where the employer required only one month of experience. Rossini's Place, Inc. , 92-INA-299 (June 1, 1993).\n\nLabor certification was properly denied where an applicant had the requisite experience and Employer failed to document \"that the field has changed substantially, or, if so, has not reasonably specified what has changed, thereby making the applicant's knowledge and experience obsolete.\" The panel thus distinguished the decision in Texas Instruments , 88-INA-413 (May 13, 1989)(en banc) in which Employer documented with evidence from the applicant's interview, that his lack of current knowledge of semiconductor devices would require a long period of training. HGHB , 92-INA-267 (June 3, 1993). See also Envelope Mfg. Corp. , 92-INA-356 (Nov. 29, 1993)(citing HGHB ). Compare Messina Music, Inc. , 92-INA-357 (July 20, 1993) where the same panel affirmed the denial of labor certification on grounds that Employer failed to provide specific support for its assertion that the applicant's experience was outdated.\n\nLabor certification was properly denied where the employer rejected U.S. workers for an unstated requirement, \"their alleged lack of ability to do hand detailing and hand carving of wood.\" The panel further held that the CO properly denied Employer's request to re-recruit with more restrictive requirements.\" Lewis Mittman, Inc. , 92-INA-230 (May 28, 1993).\n\nThe employer improperly rejected a U.S. worker who met Employer's alternative requirement of two years of experience as a Machinist/Sheet Metal Fabricator. Pro Parts, Inc. , 92-INA-289 (July 19, 1993); See also Champion Serv., Inc. , 93-INA-46 (Dec. 15, 1993)(applicant meeting alternative 2 year experience requirement improperly rejected).\n\nLabor certification properly denied where U.S. applicant rejected for lack of experience in electronic equipment and fork lift operation where neither requirement is stated as a minimum requirement on the Form ETA 750 or in the advertisement for the position. The panel did not accept Employer's argument that since the position offered is a warehouse supervisor in an electronics firm, the 1 year experience requirement as a warehouse supervisor or in the related occupation of assistant warehouse supervisor necessarily incorporates experience operating a fork lift and in electronic equipment. Tel-Ko Electronices, Inc. , 92-INA-28 (Sept. 1, 1993).\n\nEmployer improperly rejected U.S. applicants who possessed the academic requirements for the position and had one year required experience as an accountant, notwithstanding that employer listed the one year experience requirement as \"cash manager\". Noting that the significant operative phrases used by employer to describe the position closely parallel the DOT description of an accountant, The panel agreed with the CO that experience as an \"accountant\" was the same as experience as a \"cash manager\". Countrymark Cooperative, Inc. , 92-INA-304 (Dec. 8, 1993).\n\nLabor certification properly denied where rejected applicant appeared to meet Employer's minimum stated requirements. Employer's later attempt to distinguish the applicant's specific experience from that required was not found persuasive because if such specific experience is in fact required, it must be distinctly listed as a minimum requirement on the ETA 750A. J. Taylor Equip. Co., Inc. , 92-INA-353 (Dec. 10, 1993).\n\nEmployer improperly rejected a U.S. applicant meeting the minimum stated requirements as specified on the ETA 750A. The fact that the applicant did not meet the requirements for the position as advertised was not determinative since the actual minimum requirements must be those as appear on ETA 750A in order that the Certifying Officer can review and challenge them where unduly restrictive. The panel noted that the employer did not document that Alien in fact possessed the minimum requirements as listed in the advertisement. Lakeview Food Stores , 92-INA-258 (Dec. 22, 1993).\n\nEmployer improperly rejected a U.S. applicant for failing to possess a drivers license which was not listed as a minimum requirement. Robert and Elizabeth Fisher , 92-INA-204 (Jan. 4, 1994).\n\nEmployer improperly rejected U.S. applicants who met minimum stated requirements. The employer's contention that the applicants could not perform the stated job duties despite possessing the minimum stated requirements was not objectively detailed and, therefore, the employer did not meet its burden of proof. Champion Zipper Corp. , 92-INA-174 (Jan. 4, 1994).\n\nEmployer improperly rejected U.S. applicant who appeared to meet the minimum stated requirements for the position. Considering the extensive experience listed on the applicant's resume, Employer is required to produce objective and detailed reasons for rejecting the applicant after interview. Orient Computer Corp. , 91-INA-322 (March 18, 1994).\n\nEmployer improperly rejected U.S. applicant who meets the minimum stated requirements (a degree, Lotus 1-2-3 experience, general ledger and accounts payable and 18 months accounting experience) for lack of specific experience in managing a personnel office which, though listed in the job duties, was not specified as a minimum requirement. YMCA of Central and N. Westchester , 93-INA-6 (Mar. 28, 1994).\n\nEmployer improperly rejected U.S. applicant with extensive private foreign language teaching experience for lack of 3 months teaching experience in an institutional setting. The employer required 3 months experience as a Language Teaching Assistant and did not specify institutional experience as the only qualifying experience. Columbia Grammar & Preparatory Sch. , 92-INA-410 (April 6, 1994).\n\nLabor certification denied where applicant's resume indicates over 3 months experience as required. As the applicant's previous employer's name, address and phone number were submitted along with the resume, Employer's contention that she could not verify such experience was not found credible. In addtion, the panel found that part time (4 hours/day) experience performed for six months was qualifying experience and equals 3 months experience as required for the position. Yolanda Navarro , 93-INA-77 (Mar. 28, 1994).\n\nIf applicant clearly meets minimum qualifications for job, they are considered qualified. UPS, 90-INA-90 (Mar. 28, 1991). In general, employer unlawfully rejects workers who meet minimum education and experience requirements American Cafe , 90-INA-26 (Jan 23, 1991). Labor certification properly denied when employer rejects U.S. worker who meets minimal requirements Sterik Co. , 93-INA-252 (Apr. 19, 1994). Luis A. Morillo , 94-INA-223 (July 26, 1995).\n\nEmployer may lawfully reject applicant who does not meet unchallenged job requirements. Bronx Medical & Rental Clinic, 90-INA-479. (Oct. 30, 1993) (en banc). Sherwood Hall Shell , 94-INA-416 (Oct. 13, 1995).\n\nWhere job advertisement stated that experience might be a substitute for education, employer may not reject a U.S. applicant for failure to meet both experience and educational requirements where applicant did have the required experience, as the ad requested. SLS-Specimen Lab. Specialist , 94-INA-477 (July 28, 2995).\n\nEmployer sought labor certification for the position of Live-in domestic,\" its duties including general \"housework, laundering, cleaning, cooking and child care.\" The Employer required 3 months of experience for the position and 1 of 4 applicants met that job requirement. The Employer argued that the 1 qualified applicant was currently operating a day care business \"that she was unwilling to give up.\" However, the applicant denied the Employer's assertion as \"an absolute lie\" and instead stated that she had told the Employer that she would be willing to give up her child care business for a live-in position of $300.00 per week. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. It reasoned that the applicant was qualified because she met the minimum requirements specified by the Employer's application for labor certification. See The Worcester Co., Inc. , 93-INA-270 (Dec. 2, 1994); First Michigan Bank Corp. , 92-INA-256 (July 28, 1994). Jane R. Fuerst , 94-INA-506 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nAn applicant was ostensibly qualified for the position of \"Tile Mason\" but the Employer claimed initially that the applicant was uninterested in the work location. However, the applicant claimed that \"I asked...[Employer] about the location of the job and told her that I would be able to work anywhere.\" The applicant further claimed that he was uninterested in the position because the Employer's agent informed him on the telephone that the wage would be $12.00 per hour even though the advertised wage was $26.54 per hour. In rebuttal to the NOF Employer claimed that the Employer's agent informed the applicant that the advertised salary \"was in accordance with Department of Labor regulations although Employer had initiated the application with a starting salary of $12.00, and therefore, would be [sic] the ultimate decision of Employer as to the specific salary...\" The Employer claimed that its agent was \"merely providing an administrative albeit tedious and time consuming, function of facilitating the prospective applicant to meet with Employer...\" The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. The Board reasoned that the applicant met the minimum requirements specified for the position and Employer had an obligation to contact him. See The Worcester Co., Inc, 93-INA-270 (Dec. 2, 1994). Striano Contracting Corp. , 94-INA-509 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nSee also Worldwide Seafood Imports, Ltd. , 94-INA-526 (Aug. 1, 1996); Service Today, Inc. , 95-INA-85 (Oct. 1, 1996); Jeepney Grill , 94-INA-401 (July 3, 1995); DNT Int'l, Inc ., 93-INA-463 (Mar. 15, 1996).\n\nWhere a U.S. applicant is facially qualified , employers have a duty to investigate further by interviews or otherwise. See Gorchev & Gorchev , 89-INA-118 (Nov. 29, 1990). Here, the recruitment report indicated that 1 applicant was not contacted for the position of automated systems specialist because he did not have educational or work experience background. In rebuttal, Employer stated that the applicant was rejected because he did not have the required 3 years of experience as an automated systems specialist or experience designing systems for diversified uses. The Board found, however, that the applicant had been a comperterized accountant since the 1960s and with such an extensive background, the applicant should have been interviewed. Pico Inv. Co. , 94-INA-249 (oct. 4, 1995).\n\nLabor certification is properly denied where Employer rejects a U.S. worker who meets the stated minimum requirements for the job. Coventry Place , 95-INA-319 (Feb. 6, 1997).\n\nWhere for the position of Dressage horse trainer Employer rejected 1 applicant on the basis that he possessed no experience in breaking horses and analyzing the potential for new horses, where the applicant objects vigourously to this contention in saying that breaking horses is such a basic skill that he did not place it on the resume but instead listed more advanced skills, and further argued that, in fact, he was experienced in analyzing young horses, then labor certification was properly denied because when an applicant's resume indicates a broad range of experience, Employer must further investigate the specifics. See , Dac Data Sys. Corp. , 94-INA-147 (May 15, 1995). Fritz R. Kundrun , 94-INA-240 (Jan. 10, 1996).\n\nWhere applicant lists \"Diesel Mechanic\" as position sought even though he applied for position of cement mason, where Employer rejects applicant because he only had experience in office work and not as a bricklayer, but where applicant's resume indicates 5 years of experience as a bricklayer dealing with \"construction of all phases of masonry,\" then labor certification was properly denied because the applicant \"clearly\" had the 2 years experience required for the position, and the fact that the applicant's resume listed \"mechanic\" as the position appplied for is irrelevent because \"it is obvious\" that the applicant knew this position offered was not that of a diesel mechanic. Keiter Constr. Co. , 94-INA-188 (July 17, 1995).\n\nApplicants are considered qualified for the job if he or she meets the minimum requirements specified by an employer's application for labor certification. See The Worcester Co., Inc. , 93-INA-270 (Dec. 2, 1994). Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of software research associate because the applicant had not already (although he was currently) taken a course in information management and because he \"had extremely little experience in the field and he has he has no experience in developing utility program.\" However, the applicant's resume suggested that he had over 9 years of experience in information management, including experience as an application programmer, system administrator, and college teacher; he had experience writing soft wareand know multiple programming languages, inlcuding assembly language and the applicant had a Master's Degree in Electrical engineering from a chinese universityand is currently working on a doctorate in comptuter science. Certification was proplerly denied. Software Sys. Technology, Inc ., 94-INA-299 (June 27, 1995).\n\nAn employer unlawfully rejects a U.S. applicant who satisfies the requirements specified by an employer in its application and advertisements for the position. See American Cafe , 90-INA-26 (Jan. 24, 1991). In the recruitment report the Employer rejected the applicant on the basis that she did not drive and did not swim. Neither of these reasons were stated as requirements in the Employer's application or advertisements. Certification was properly denied. Sarah and Norman Jaffe , 94-INA-513 (Oct. 30, 1995).\n\nAn employer must state all the requirements for the position on the application and if an applicant meets the requirements as stated by Employer, he or she is deemed qualified for the job. See Bell Communications Research, Inc. , 88-INA-26 (Dec. 22, 1988) (en banc). But see Ashbrook-Simon Hartley v. claughin , 863 F. 2d 410 (5th Cir. 1989). Employer rejected several applicants for the position of maintenance mechanic on the basis that they could not perform the job duties as listed in item 13 of the ETA 750A (job duties). See Ashbrook-Simon Hartley v. Mclaughin , 863 F. 2d 410 (5th Cir. 1989). However, the Board found that the actual test was whether the applicant met the job requirements in item 14 (requirements). See Bell Communications Research, Inc. , 88-INA-26 (Dec. 22, 1988) (en banc). In any case, the Board reasoned that several applicants could perfomr the duties listed in item 13. Bo Packing , 94-INA-443 (Feb. 6, 1996).\n\nAn applicant who meets the alternative minimum requirements for a position is considered qualified. See Ronell's Stores, Inc. , 93-INA-352 (Sept. 29, 1994). The Employer unlawfully rejected an applicant for the position of maintenance mechanic on the basis that he had insuffucient experience in refrigeration and because he had no experience in general building maintenance. The Board reasoned that the applicant had 16 years of combined experience repairing machines and he had a \"major\" from a vocational school in heating and A/C refrigeration and had extensive experience servicing and repairing refrigeration units. Further, the Board reasoned that there was no suggestion that the job in question entailed genreal buiding maintenance. Bo Packing , 94-INA-443 (Feb. 6, 1996).\n\nWhere an applicant's resume shows a broad range of experience, education and training that raises a reasonable possability that the applicant is qualified, even if it does not state that he or she meets all requirements, an employer should further investigate the applicant's credentials by interview or otherwise. See Dearborn Pub. Sch. , 91-INA-222 (Dec. 7, 1993). The Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of accountant in the recuitment report on the basis that he lacked auditing experience. The Employer later stated that the applicant was rejected on the basis that the applicant had not \"internal auditing experience.\" The Board affirmed the CO's denial of labor certification, reasoning that the applicant's resume actually reflected the required auditing experience and that the internal auditing experience was not job requriment for the position. Pouyan, Inc., d/b/a Dominos Pizza , 94-INA-414 (Oct. 12, 1995).\n\nAn employer may reject an applicant who meets the stated job requirements but is nevertheless demonstrably incomptetent to perform the main duties of the job, based on the information obtained from references or objective testing during the interview. See First Michigan Bank Corp. , 92-INA-256 (July 28, 1994). The Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of accountant in the recuitment report on the basis that he lacked auditing experience. The Employer later stated that the applicant was rejected on the basis that the applicant had not \"internal auditing experience.\" The Board affirmed the CO's denial of labor certification, reasoning that the applicant's resume actually reflected the required auditing experience and that the internal auditing experience was not job requriment for the position. Pouyan, Inc., d/b/a Dominos Pizza , 94-INA-414 (Oct. 12, 1995).\n\nAn applicant is considered qualified for a job if he or she meets the stated minimum requirements for the job. See United Parcel Serv. , 90-INA-90 (Mar. 28, 1991). The Employer unlawfully rejected an applicant for the position of maintenance mechanic on the basis that he had insuffucient experience in refrigeration and because he had no experience in general building maintenance. The Board reasoned that the applicant had 16 years of combined experience repairing machines and he had a \"major\" from a vocational school in heating and A/C refrigeration and had extensive experience servicing and repairing refrigeration units. Further, the Board reasoned that there was no suggestion that the job in question entailed genreal buiding maintenance. Bo Packing , 94-INA-443 (Feb. 6, 1996).\n\nEmployer sought certification for the position of Computer Programmer and required a high school education and 3 years of experience in the job offered. The Employer listed no special requirements in its ETA 750A. One applicant had experience in Basic; Cobol; RPGII programming; local area networks, particularly Novell Netware v2.2; Lotus 113; WordPerfect; icrosoft Excel; Carbon Copy; IBM S/36; and had converted files from IBM S/36 to PC Lan. The Employer rejected him because he was inexperienced in Micro Focus Cobal and Novell Netware Operating Systems, arguing that the applicant's experience was unrelated to the experience required for the position. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. Citing American Cafe , 90-INA-26 (Jan. 24, 1991), the Board noted that applicants who meet the minimum requirements specified in the ETA 750A and the advertisement for the position are considered qualified. Here, the Board reasoned, the applicant was rejected for not having specific programming experience which was not included in the ETA 750A. Pacific Shores Financial Corp. , 95-INA-115 (Jan. 28, 1997).\n\nThe Board distinguished 1 case from Bronx Medical and Dental Clinic , 90-INA-479 (Oct. 30, 1992). The Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of accountant in the recuitment report on the basis that he lacked auditing experience. The Employer later stated that the applicant was rejected on the basis that the applicant had not \"internal auditing experience.\" The Board affirmed the CO's denial of labor certification, reasoning that the applicant's resume actually reflected the required auditing experience and that the internal auditing experience was not job requriment for the position. Bronx was found not to control because internal auditing experience was \"not a job requirement.\" Pouyan, Inc., d/b/a Dominos Pizza , 94-INA-414 (Oct. 12, 1995).\n\nEmployer sought certification for the position of Auto Mechanic for foreign automobiles. Its only requirements were 2 years experience in the job offered. The Employer rejected 1 applicant with 28 years of experience because the applicant had no experience in fuel injection. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. Citing United Parcel Serv. , 90-INA-90, (Mar. 28, 1991), the Board noted that applicants who meet the minimum experience listed in the ETA 750 for the position are considered qualified. Here, the Board reasoned, neither the ETA 750A nor the advertisement stated that expertise in fuel injection was a requirement for the position. G.M. Hotlunch Truck MFG., Corp. , 95-INA-116 (Jan. 28, 1997).\n\nWhere an applicant's resume shows a broad range of experience, education and training that raises a reasonable possability that the applicant is qualified, even if it does not state that he or she meets all requirements, an employer should further investigate the applicant's credentials by interview or otherwise. See Dearborn Pub. Sch. , 91-INA-222 (Dec. 7, 1993). The Employer failed to provide sufficient documentation in support of its rejection of 11 U.S. workers for the position of geotechical engineeer. Only 3 applicants were interviewed, so the Employer's assertion that 2 other applicants had no software experience was not made after reasonable inquiry. The rejection of 3 additional applicants on the basis that they lacked business training was invalid because that requirement was unsupported by business necessity. As to the Employer's assertion that that 1 applicant had no work authorization, more was required than a \"general statement\" that persons unknown had said that the applicant lacked authorization. Although 3 other applicants either lacked experience or undergraduate degrees, these applicants had impressive credentials and their rejections further adds to the impression that there lacked good faith recriutment. Twin City Testing , 94-INA-415 (Oct. 12, 1995).\n\nUpholding a CO's denial of labor certification, the Board recently cited United Parcel Serv. , 90-INA-90 (Mar. 28, 1991) (holding that the Board considers an applicant qualified if he meets the minimum requirements for the position). The Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of Pharmacist on the basis that he had poor communication skills. However, Employer listed only a B.S. in Pharmacy and a California practitioner's license as requirements for the position. In upholding the denial of certification, the Board reasoned that Employer had presented no new evidence designed to rebut the applicant's qualifications for the position and for that reason, the applicant would be deemed qualified for the position. Save-On Drugs , 95-INA-250 (Jan. 30, 1997).\n\nUpholding a CO's denial of labor certification, the Board recently cited American Cafe , 90-INA-26 (Jan. 24, 1991) (holding that employers unlawfully reject U.S. applicants who meet the minimum requirement specified in the ETA 750A and the advertisements for the position). The Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of Pharmacist on the basis that he had poor communication skills.

Save-On Drugs , 95-INA-250 (Jan. 30, 1997).\n\nEmployer rejected a U.S. applicant for the position of Diesel Mechanic whose resume indicated that he had 4 years experience for the position. The Employer reasoned that his resume did not show \"ANY EXPERIENCE as Diesel mechanic except for the title if [sic] you review the job description on his resume you will agree with me that they do not even resemble the job to be performed.\" Rather than contacting the U.S. applicant to interview him, Employer stated that he checked with unspecified people for whom the applicant worked. Rather than producing documentation of these conversations after the CO requested them, Employer merely stated that the U.S. mechanic's resume showed no experience as a diesel mechanic, \"except for the title.\" The Employer \"reiterated that he tried to clarify ...[the applicant's] experience with his previous employers, and again failed to provide specifics or documentation regarding such contacts. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. It reasoned that the applicant's resume indicated on its face that there is a reasonable possibility that he possessed 4 years of experience as a diesel mechanic and Employer had an obligation to investigate his credentials further. See Gorchev & Gorchev Design , 89-INA-118 (Nov. 29, 1990 (en banc). Cavalier's Bay Ctr., Inc., 95-INA-90 (Jan. 27, 1997).\n\nThe Board held on appeal after a Motion to Reconsider that the case should be remanded. The CO failed to consider an Employer's vice president's assertion that an applicant \"had a hard time understanding the interviewing officer and, when he answered the questions he, could not bring out his knowledge...\" The vice president had further stated that the applicant \"could not express ...[himself] in words...,\" although he was \"academically intelligent.\" The Board disagreed with the CO's finding that a response submitted by the applicant wherein he wrote, \"I have experience in civil/stru/soil eng'g...If I was not hired, there might have someone they thought more appropriate...I got letter [sic]...,\" demonstrated a command of the English language. The Employer lastly stated that clients in the past have asked for replacements when faced with an employee who cannot speak English well. The Board reasoned that the applicant failed to meet the minimum requirements for the position. Testwell Craig Labs of N.J., Inc. , 94-INA-512 (Dec. 2, 1996).\n\nEmployer filed an application for labor certification for the position of \"Elementary School Teacher\" and the duties included the \"Sacramental preparation of students.\" The Employer required one year experience in the job offered. An alternative to the requirement of one year experience in the job offered was one year experience in the related field of \"Teacher.\" The Employer rejected 6 applicants on the basis that they lacked experience necessary for the Sacramental preparation of the students. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. The Board reasoned that Employer could not reject 6 applicants on the basis that they lacked experience in the \"Sacramental Preparation of Students\" because applicants are considered qualified for the job if they meet the minimum requirements by an employer's application for labor certification and because one year experience as a \"Teacher\" was an alternative to the requirement of one year experience in the job offered. Sacred Heart Sch. , 94-INA-510 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nWhere the only requirement for the position of \"Bookkeeper I Bilingual,\" was 2 year's experience, where an applicant was \"ostensibly qualified\" for the position, where Employer asserted that the applicant was rejected because of lack of interest, but where the applicant denied that she was uninterested, then labor certification was properly denied because the applicant was considered qualified for the position and the Employer's recruitment was not conducted in good faith. Wah Yuan Trading Corp. , 94-INA-507 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nEmployer sought alien labor certification for the position of \"Monitor, Sleep-In, Household\" and the state agency determined that one U.S. applicant was qualified for the position. However, Employer failed to either contact the applicant or submit a recruitment report (even though Employer did submit a letter addressed to the applicant and did submit a narrative recounting its recruitment efforts concerning another applicant). The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. The Board reasoned that the applicant met the minimum requirements specified for the position and Employer had an obligation to contact her and therefore labor certification was properly denied. See The Worcester Co., Inc, 93-INA-270 (Dec. 2, 1994). Cristina Clark , 94-INA-508 (Oct. 31, 1996).\n\nWhere the only requirement for the position of \"Bookkeeper I Bilingual,\" was 2 year's experience, where 2 applicants \"clearly\" met that requirement and where the Employer's basis for their rejection was inability to contact their references and the applicants' failure to return a phone call, then the applicants are considered qualified for the position and the Employer's recruitment was not conducted in good faith because both applicants denied having received phone calls and the Employer's efforts in contacting references through directory assistance without obtaining additional information from the applicants appeared \"highly unusual and did not at all afford the U.S. workers applying for the job any opportunity to present their qualifications, credentials, or references.\" Wah Yuan Trading Corp. , 94-INA-507 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nWhere Employer rejected a U.S. applicant for purportedly failing to have experience in directing an organic/inorganic laboratory, establishing laboratory protocols and \"QA-QC procedures, then Employer unlawfully rejected the U.S. worker because none of these requirements were stated on the ETA-750 or in the job listing and an employer unlawfully rejects a U.S. worker who satisfies the minimum requirements specified on the ETA 750A and in the advertisement for the position. Spectrum Analytical, Inc. 95-INA-324 (Jan. 19, 1997).\n\nEmployer sought certification for the position of \"Staff Accountant\" in a trading company and rejected an applicant due to lack of experience in the import/export field. The Employer maintained that the only experience the applicant had was with Golden Financial Group for a year and 7 months and that his other experience was in the area of operation analyst for financial companies rather than as assistant accountant for a trading company. The applicant, contradicting Employer, described Golden Financial Group as a trading company. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed, reasoning that the applicant had been unlawfully rejected. It appeared \"clear\" to the Board that Polly Peck International Enterprises, another previous employer of the applicant, was a trading company and not a financial company. According to the Board, the applicant's experience at Poly Peck in the absence of other evidence, seemed to have spanned 18 months. In addition, the Board reasoned that while the applicant did not specifically show that he dealt with collection matters in either of the above positions, this lack was not assigned as a reason for rejection in either the recruitment report or the rebuttal. oreover, his resume did disclose his having been involved with accounts receivable in other positions such as an international banking facility. First Nat. Trading Co., 95-INA-97 (Jan. 27, 1997).\n\nUS applicant may not be lawfully rejected for being overqualified or because he may only stay in the position a short time.

IPF Int'l, Inc. , 94-INA-586 (Jul. 24, 1996).\n\nEmployer who gives the job one title (foreman/factory) when the actual duties resemble another (supervisor/demolition) cannot show that there are no qualified US workers because the applicants cannot even be considered until the job duties are clear. Calvin aintenance , 94-INA-552 (Nov. 18, 1996).\n\nB. Applicant does not meet requirements\n\nThe CO was reversed and labor certification was granted where CO admitted that the applicant did not meet the minimum requirements for the position but nonetheless denied certification based the CO's belief that the applicant could nevertheless perform the job duties. The panel held that the minimum requirements were those normally required for the position as defined in the DOT. Therefore, the fact that the CO questioned the minimum requirements as restrictive did not obviate the fact that U.S. applicant did not meet the accepted minimum requirements for the position. AFS Intercultural Programs , 92-INA-358 (May 11, 1994).\n\nLabor certification granted where the U.S. applicant did not meet an unchallenged license requirement. The CO improperly substituted her own judgement pursuant to 656.24(b)(2)(ii) in concluding that despite the applicant's lack of the required license, he was qualified to perform the job. Payless Drug Store , 93-INA-459 (Jul. 26, 1994)(citing Bronx edical and Dental Clinic , 90-INA-479 (Oct. 30, 1992)(en banc)).\n\nDenial of labor certification reversed where all applicants were lawfully rejected since their resumes and job service questionnaire forms demonstrate that none possessed the required experience in the all of the core job duties. Indarjit Jadoo , 93-INA-492 (Nov. 29, 1994).\n\nLabor certification properly denied where Employer indicated that he rejected U.S. applicant because he was unable to verify the 20 years of experience listed on the applicants resume, but where Employer only required two years of experience. Willy Leon Photographers , 94-INA-224 (May 25, 1995).\n\nThe employer properly rejected U.S. workers for failure to meet the stated, actual minimum requirements for the job.

See also Eastern Int'l Impex Corp. , 91-INA-130 (May 8, 1992).\n\nThe employer properly rejected an applicant for the job of production manager where the applicant's experience was in food distribution, not food production, as required by the employer in the ETA-750. El Centro Foods/Pizzaman , 92-INA-330 (July 12, 1993).\n\nAlthough driving and a good driving record were not stated requirements for plumbing position, because Employer consistently emphasized the residential nature of the work environment and the individual \"troubleshooting\" aspects of the job, Employer could reasonably have expected such to be an implicit requirement for the position. Saturn Plumbing , 92-INA-194 (Feb. 3, 1994).\n\nOne panel held that rejection of a U.S. worker for lack of experience in a stated job requirement is proper if it is a \"'key duty'\" as opposed to a \"minor duty which can be learned by someone . . . through a quick orientation once hired for the job.\" Thus, if a job duty does not fall within the \"minor duty\" exception, and it is not unduly restrictive, then the employer may properly reject a U.S. worker for failure to meet this requirement. Marie M. Runyon , 91-INA-380 (Mar. 31, 1993).\n\nThe Board (per Judges De Gregorio, Glennon, Litt, and Williams) has recently held in a plurality opinion that a CO may not deny labor certification under ยง 656.24(b)(2)(ii) on grounds that a U.S. worker may meet a job's stated requirements through a combination of education, training, and experience where the job's requirements are unchallenged. The Board reasoned that, to hold otherwise, would \"require an employer . . . to judge job applicants on the basis of all possible combinations of education, training, and/or experience that a CO might consider qualifying . . ..\" The Board then concluded that there is no requirement \"for a CO substituting, after the fact, his/her own judgment for Employer's job requirements, and then penalizing the Employer for having acted without regard to that judgment.\" Bronx Medical and Dental Clinic , 90-INA-479 (Oct. 30, 1992) (Judge Romano concurred to stated that ยง 656.24(b)(2)(ii) does not set forth a separate standard except in regard to any work experience requirement. Judges Brenner, Groner, and Guill concurred in the result only and reasoned that the CO may challenge the rejection of U.S. workers under ยง 656.24(b)(2)(ii) but he or she has the burden of showing that the \"U.S. applicant's qualifications . . . specifically compensate for the failure to meet the stated requirements and therefore enable the applicant to perform the employer's job.\" Judge Clarke dissented to state that the Act is intended to protect U.S. workers and the burden, therefore, should be placed on Employer to establish that each U.S. worker was rejected for lawful, job related reasons under 20 C.F.R. ยง 656.24(b)(2)(ii).

See also Multi-Fineline Electronix, Inc. , 91-INA-42 (Apr. 30, 1992).\n\nThe CO properly denied labor certification where the employer declined to interview any of the 197 (or 333 as maintained by the CO) seemingly qualified applicants for the job offered as Architect on grounds that the \"employer is a very small operation not having the resources or manpower or time to interview all the applicants . . ..\" The panel noted that this argument had a \"certain refreshing novelty\", but was contrary to the purpose of the Act. H.L. Walker & Assoc. , 92-INA-328 (June 2, 1993). See also Nancy Ltd. , Case No. 89-2257-CIV-TES (S.D. Fla. 1989), aff'd , 946 F.2d 904 (11th Cir. 1991) (reversing the Board's holding in Nancy Ltd. , 88-INA-358 (Apr. 27, 1989)(en banc)).\n\nAn employer may reject an applicant who does not meet unchallenged job requirments . See Bronx Medical and Dental Clinic , 90-INA-479 (Oct. 30, 1993) (en banc). The Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of sample maker, children's clothing because he had 2 years experience as a sample maker but not as a sample maker in children's clothing. The Board determined the requirement of 2 years experience in the position of sample maker, children's clothing, as unduly restrive. Accordingly, Employer unlawfully rejected the applicant. Florinda Fashions, Inc ., 94-INA-458 (Oct. 13, 1995).\n\nA. Regulatory provision\n\nno new cases\n\nB. Burden on CO to explain why applicant is qualified\n\nno new cases\n\nC. Persuasiveness of CO's explanation\n\nno new cases\n\nD. Relationship of ยง 656.24(b)(2)(ii) to Ashbrook-Simon-Hartley\n\nE. Employer's rebuttal to CO's finding that U.S. worker is qualified\n\nno new cases\n\nF. Reasonable period of on-the-job training\n\n1. Applicant capable of performing duties with nominal training\n\nEmployer, a medical center, sought certification for the position of accountant and required 2 years experience in accounting or finance and a B.S. in Accounting or a business related major. Receiving 14 applications in response to its advertisement, 1 applicant was rejected due to lack of experience in the software programs used by Employer (Microsoft, Lotus 123, Excel 123 and Medisoft) and for having no previous experience in the medical facilities and no medical billing experience. The CO issued a NOF proposing to deny certification because Employer had not required applicants to have knowledge of specific software programs, medical clinic experience, or 2 years only in the position offered. In rebuttal, Employer contended, inter alia, that the applicant was unfamiliar with the software programs used by Employer and Employer lacked the resources to train him. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. As for the lack of experience with the computer software, the Board noted that the applicant's resume did show experience in Lotus 123 and many other accounting programs, the completion of a course in computerized accounting and the use of computers for over 6 years. Citing Mindcraft Software , Inc. , 90-INA-328 (Oct. 2, 1991) the Board reasoned that the applicant met the Employer's minimum alternative requirements and could perform in the position with nominal training. St. George's Medical Ctr. , 95-INA-111 (Jan. 29, 1997)\n\n2. Burden of proof on CO\n\nno new cases\n\n3. Illustrative cases\n\nWhere applicant's resume includes a broad range of experience in various aspects of the main requirements for the position, it is difficult for Employer to contend that two aspects of the job, listed under \"special requirements\", are essential core duties that cannot be quickly learned in on-the-job training by someone with the applicant's experience. The Weck Corp. d/b/a/ Gracious Home , 93-INA-35 (Mar. 8, 1995).\n\nWhere two applicants indicated that they had training in CPR, employer could not reject them because neither had current certification. The panel noted that CPR certification had to be renewed yearly and would not require too much effort for either applicant to become certified. United Rehabilitation Serv. , 93-INA-253 (Apr. 13, 1995).\n\nApplicant for the position of Cook, Mexican Style Food, with 10 years experience as Head Cook and experience specializing in preparation of Mexican food was improperly rejected where Employer claimed that the applicant had no experience cooking charbroiled chicken. The panel concluded that it was reasonable to assume that the applicant could learn the particular cooking technique in a reasonable amount of time given her 10 years experience as a cook. El Pollo Grande Restaurant , 94-INA- 181 (Apr. 26, 1995).\n\nIV. Particular grounds for rejection\n\nA. \"Able\" worker\n\nCertification granted where employer pre-school contacted references of interested U.S. applicant and where prior employer stated he \"chose not to\" re-hire the U.S. worker although the position remained open. Rejection of the U.S. applicant held to constitute lawful and job related. The Broadway Baptist Child Dev. Ctr. , 92-INA-405 (Sept. 30, 1993).\n\nB. Alien more qualified\n\nLabor certification properly denied where employer admitted that U.S. applicant meets minimum education and experience requirement of the position, but that \"taking into consideration suitability, alien has the advantage . . .\" The fact that the alien may be better qualified is not a lawful, job-related reason for rejecting a qualified U.S. applicant. V.I. Water and Power Auth. , 93-INA-322 (Oct. 11, 1994).\n\nEmployer required a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and either four years experience in the job (Mechanical Engineering Consultant), or four years experience in the related occupation of echanical Engineer. The CO incorrectly concluded that under ยง656.24(b)(2)(ii) a U.S. applicant was qualified for the job by virtue of his electrical engineering experience. Randolph- Rand Corp. , 93-INA-70 (Dec. 2, 1994)(citing Bronx edical and Dental Clinic , 90-INA-479 (Oct. 30, 1992)(en banc).\n\nLabor certification properly denied for position of \"high fashion hair and make-up designer\" where a U.S. applicant met the minimum requirements designated by the Employer but was not a \"household name\" with \"a proven track record of the highest quality in leading high-fashion publications\" as was Alien. Network Representatives, Inc. , 94-INA- 123 (April 14, 1995).\n\nAn assertion that the alien is more qualified does not constitute a lawful, job related reason for rejection of a U.S. worker. Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn , 90-INA-453 (Apr. 13, 1992); Gabriel Rubanenko, M.D. Inc. , 92-INA-370 (Dec. 22, 1993); State of California, Bd. of Equalization , 93-INA- 42 (Dec. 7, 1993).\n\nWhere Employer applied for alien labor certification to fill the position of \"Technical Director/ Lab Manager, where Employer rejected a U.S. applicant for purportedly failing to have experience in directing an organic/inorganic laboratory or establishing laboratory protocols and \"QA-QC procedures,\" but where this requirement was not listed in ETA 750A or job listing, then Employer improperly rejected the applicant because an employer may not reject a qualified U.S. applicant merely because an alien is more qualified. Spectrum Analytical, Inc, n.1 95-INA-324 (Jan. 19, 1997)\n\nC. Artistic ability\n\n1. Appropriateness of artistic ability as a factor for assessment of applicants\n\nno new cases\n\n2. Vague or unsupported statement of deficiency in talent\n\nWhere an Employer rejects an applicant for the position of Dressage Horse Trainer on the basis, among others, that he utilized the freestyle technique rather than the traditional technique of dressage, and where the Employer's application for labor certification lists no requirement that experience in a particular technique of dressage was required, then labor certification was properly denied because where the job offer requires talent, an employer may not reject U.S. applicants based upon vague, undisclosed or general deficiencies. See Anderson-Mraz Design , 90-INA-142 (May 30, 1991). Fritz R. Kundrun , 94-INA-240 (Jan. 10, 1996).\n\n3. Position not requiring production of art works\n\nno new cases\n\nD. Availability of applicant\n\n1. Rejection proper if lack of availability is documented\n\nEmployer applied for certification for the position of Caretaker. The Employer rejected 1 applicant, saying that he \"would not commit to giving up his own business.\" A 2d applicant was rejected because \"he stated that he has his own full-time business and can only do piecemeal work.\" Disagreeing with Employer, the 1st applicant asserted that \"he was told that the job was filled and was not as described. The 2d applicant stated that Employer only contacted him after he had called and left 2 messages with Employer and mailed her references. The Employer informed him that he was not hired because he had his own business. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. Citing Monica urphy , 91-INA-281 (Aug. 17, 1992) (holding that an employer unlawfully rejects a U.S. worker as unavailable, without first offering the job to the applicant, on grounds that the worker was presently employed), the Board held that the applicant could not reject the applicants based on the assumption that they were uninterested without first offering them the position. Dr. Donna Rohlf, Ph.D. , 95-INA-148 (Nov. 21, 1996).\n\nApplicant improperly rejected as unavailable where employer only asserted that the applicant currently lives out of state. Celina's Deli , 93-INA-247 (Jun. 14, 1994).\n\nIt was improper for an employer to reject U.S. applicants as unavailable prior to offering the job where, as the panel noted, one applicant was \"in technical school at the time of the initial consideration, but he could have left technical school and accepted the job, had it been offered.\" The other applicant \"attempted to negotiate employment terms during the initial telephone contact\" but stated that he would have accepted the job had it been offered. Warmington Homes , 91-INA-237 (Mar. 22, 1993).\n\nThe employer unlawfully rejected a U.S. worker as unavailable, without first offering the job to the applicant, on grounds that the worker was \"presently employed\". The panel noted that there was \"no evidence that the applicant is unwilling or unable to change jobs\". Monica Murphy , 91-INA-281 (Aug. 17, 1992).\n\nAn employer properly rejected two applicants who were neither U.S. citizens nor lawful, permanent residents as these applicants were not \"available\". Lotus Corp ., 91-INA-203 (July 28, 1992).\n\nLabor certification was granted and a U.S. worker was properly rejected for the job of live-in Child Monitor/Housekeeper where she would bring her own children with her while caring for Employer's children and, \"[a]lthough the advertisement did not explicitly mention the requirement that there be no additional small children competing for the Child onitor's attention and ministrations, we believe that a fair reading of the job description reflects the assumption that Employer's child will enjoy the incumbent's full-time attention.\" The panel noted that Employer's other ground for rejection of the worker, that the applicant was unemployed for a period of time, was not valid. Mrs. Jacki Evans , 92-INA-341 (June 3, 1993).\n\nLabor certification properly denied where admittedly qualified U.S. worker was rejected as unwilling to accept school teaching position immediately, as of March 1991. The panel noted that it is reasonable to conclude that the position was really set to begin in September, the start of the new school year. More determinative, the employer failed to establish that the applicant was unwilling to accept the position as the record contains no evidence that applicant was specifically asked whether she could start immediately. Cincinnati Bd. of Educ. , 92-INA-218 (Oct. 26, 1993).\n\n2. Failure to respond\n\nThe only requirement for the position of \"Bookkeeper I, Bilingual\" was 2 year's experience and 2 applicants \"clearly\" met that requirement. The Employer's basis for their rejection was inability to contact their references and the applicants' failure to return a phone call. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. The Board reasoned that the applicants considered qualified for the position and the Employer's recruitment was not conducted in good faith because both applicants denied having received phone calls. In addition, it reasoned, the Employer's efforts in contacting references through directory assistance without obtaining additional information from the applicants appeared \"highly unusual and did not at all afford the U.S. workers applying for the job any opportunity to present their qualifications, credentials, or references.\" Compare the instant case with H.C. LaMarche Ent., Inc. , 87-INA-607 (Oct. 27, 1988), a seminal case allowing the rejection of U.S. workers who fail to respond to letters offering an interview. Wah Yuan Trading Corp. , 94-INA-507 (Nov. 14, 1996)\n\n3. Applicant who intends also to work another job\n\nno new cases\n\n4. Conflicting hours of employment\n\nno new cases\n\n5. Medical incapacity\n\nno new cases\n\n6. Non-competition clause [NEW]\n\nA panel held that an admittedly qualified U.S. applicant could not be lawfully rejected based on a non-competitive hiring agreement between employer and another employer with whom the rejected U.S. applicant was concurrently seeking employment. The panel noted that the applicant was a prospective employee and not yet an actual employee of both employers. W.F. Amams, Inc. , 93-INA-95 (Jan. 4, 1994).\n\nE. Changed requirements or job description\n\nLabor certification denied where employer's use of the term \"human awareness counseling\" to mean 6 months experience in \"human sexuality awareness\" was not patently obvious, nor merely a term of art. The panel found such usage confusing and a failure to clearly describe the minimum experience requirements at the initial recruitment stage. Accordingly, employer's rejection of an otherwise qualified U.S. applicant for lack of 6 months experience in \"human sexuality awareness\" was unlawful. Fairfield County Bd. of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities , 93-INA- 34 (Apr. 15, 1994).\n\nLabor certification properly denied where prior to review of U.S. workers applications, employer did not distinguish or specify experience in industrial refrigeration systems as opposed to commercial refrigeration systems. Moreover, the DOT description of refrigeration mechanic makes no distinction between industrial and commercial refrigeration experience. Accordingly, employer's rejection of otherwise qualified U.S. workers for lack of unstated industrial refrigeration experience was unlawful. Industrial Refrigeration Inc. , 93-INA-206 (Jul. 6, 1994).\n\nA U.S. worker was unlawfully rejected where the employer intentionally discouraged him by \"belittling\" his experience and offering less favorable terms and conditions of employment; namely, asking if the U.S. worker would consider a lateral more to a position paying a lower wage rate and indicating that the applicant would have to work 50-55 hours per week as opposed to 40 hours per week as stated on the application for labor certification. Kamashian Eng'g , 90-INA-408 (Feb. 6, 1992).\n\nThe employer unlawfully rejected U.S. workers where it merely asserted that a man was preferred for the job and the hours of employment were misrepresented. Manuella Wholesalers, Inc. , 90-INA-482 (Feb. 4, 1992).\n\nA case was remanded \"to the CO with instructions to have Employer clarify the minimum requirements for the job and resolve the discrepancies which exists between the job application, job posting and advertisements.\" Rockingham Ventures , 91-INA-215 (Jan. 6, 1993).\n\nF. Communication skills\n\n1. Poor communication skills, generally\n\nno new cases\n\n2. Applicant's inability to speak English\n\nThe Board held on appeal after a Motion to Reconsider that the case should be remanded. The CO failed to consider an Employer's vice president's assertion that an applicant \"had a hard time understanding the interviewing officer and, when he answered the questions he, could not bring out his knowledge...\" The vice president had further stated that the applicant \"could not express ...[himself] in words...,\" although he was \"academically intelligent.\" The Board disagreed with the CO's finding that a response submitted by the applicant wherein he wrote, \"I have experience in civil/stru/soil eng'g...If I was not hired, there might have [sic] someone they thought more appropriate...I got letter [sic]...,\" demonstrated a command of the English language. The Employer lastly stated that clients in the past have asked for replacements when faced with an employee who cannot speak English well. The Board reasoned that Employer met its burden of demonstrating that the applicant is not qualified for the position of Assistant Civil Engineer. See Spizer, Inc. , 94-INA-383 (Oct. 25, 1995); Impel Corp. , 88-INA-298 (May 31, 1989) (en banc). Testwell Craig Labs of N.J., Inc. , 94-INA-512 (Dec. 2, 1996).\n\nUpholding a CO's denial of labor certification, the Board recently cited Juanito N. Roque , 88-INA-04 (Apr. 5, 1988) (allowing employers to reject applicants on the basis of poor communications skills). The Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of Pharmacist because of poor communication skills. The Employer argued that the \"applicant was unable to comprehend and answer basic questions asked at his interview and that he could not answer questions regarding his short term goals and what he considered his best qualities.\" However, Employer listed only a B.S. in Pharmacy and a California practitioner's license as requirements for the position. In upholding the denial of certification, the Board agreed with Employer that pharmacists need to be able to speak English. However, the Board reasoned that Employer failed to comply with the CO's request in the NOF that it demonstrate the applicant's lack of qualifications for the position. Looking at all the record evidence, including the applicant's resume showing several years of pharmaceutical employment in the U.S., the fact that the applicant had received a California pharmacy license, and the fact that the applicant had been in the U.S. since 1987, the Board found that the Employer had not met its burden of proof. Save-On Drugs , 95-INA-250 (Jan. 30, 1997).\n\nUpholding a CO's denial of labor certification, the Board recently cited Impell Corp. , 88-INA-298 (May 31, 1989) (placing the burden of proof on employers to demonstrate that an applicant cannot speak English). The Employer rejected 1 applicant for the position of Pharmacist on the basis that he had poor communication skills. The Employer argued that the \"applicant was unable to comprehend and answer basic questions asked at his interview and that he could not answer questions regarding his short term goals and what he considered his best qualities.\" However, Employer listed only a B.S. in Pharmacy and a California practitioner's license as requirements for the position.

Save-On Drugs , 95-INA-250 (Jan. 30, 1997).\n\n3. Applicant's inability to understand the employer's accented speech\n\nno new cases\n\nG. Conflict of interest\n\nThe employer failed to provide a lawful, job related reason for rejection of a U.S. worker where it conceded that the applicant met the requirements of the job but the employer offered an undocumented assertion that \"(the applicant's) ownership and operation in a retail business in the same market as Employer which Employer contends the applicant is not likely to sell . . . (will render the applicant) unable to devote himself to Employer's full time job, as well as putting Employer's business as great risk given that (the applicant's) business is a potential competitor\". Fashions From India, Inc. , 92-INA-26 (Feb. 4, 1993).\n\nH. Diversion of U.S. worker/alien\n\nThe panel reiterated the Board's well established holding that an employer may not hire a U.S. worker for the job offered and then hire the alien for an identical position by asserting multiple openings where only a single opening was listed in the advertisement and ETA-750. Nonetheless, the panel granted certification in this case based on employer's willingness to comply and its statement to the local employment agency that multiple openings were in fact available. Children's Hosp. of Michigan , 93-INA-160 (Jul. 26, 1994).\n\nDenial of certification vacated and case remanded to the CO where there were two aliens, two openings were advertised and the CO found that only one U.S. worker was unlawfully rejected. Garibay Maintenance , 92-INA-399, 400 (Oct. 27, 1994).\n\nLabor certification was properly denied where the employer indicated the availability of only one opening for the petitioned position which was subsequently filled by a U.S. worker. Premark Int'l , 91-INA-167 (May 18, 1992). See also Casa San Miguel, Inc. , 92-INA-73 (July 2, 1993) (employer could not assert multiple openings in its rebuttal where the ETA-750 and advertisements listed only one opening); IMT Italian Marble & Tile Co. , 91-INA-179 (Dec. 11, 1992) (employer's assertion of multiple job openings on appeal not sufficient where a single opening was listed in the advertisements and ETA-750); Sam's Exxon , 91-INA-362 (Dec. 11, 1992) (employer determined that U.S. worker was overqualified and offered higher paid position but panel held improper diversion) ; Aloha Airlines , 91-INA-181 (June 1, 1992).\n\nLabor certification was improperly denied and a remand was necessary because the panel stated that it was \"basically unfair for the CO to have consolidated these 13 cases and then to have denied all of the certification applications because three potentially qualified U.S. worker(s) were not hired.\" Without assessing the merits of the rejections of the U.S. applicants, the panel remanded the case \"to the CO with instructions to determine each case separately and to allow Employer an opportunity the readvertise the jobs with (the) actual minimum requirements for each position.\" The Budd Co. , 91-INA-204, 205, 209-214, 217, 219, 220, 92-INA-207, 208 (Aug. 4, 1993).

Applicant with only general or related experience\n\nno new cases\n\n3. Applicant possessing only alternative experience\n\nno new cases\n\nJ. Job duties, generally\n\n1. Ashbrook-Simon-Hartley ; DOL must consider the stated job duties\n\nno new cases\n\n2. Ability to perform main job duties\n\na. Employer's burden to provide detailed basis for its conclusion\n\nDenial of labor certification inappropriate where the CO completely disregarded the employer's detailed discussion why the U.S. applicant was unable to perform the job duties despite the qualifications listed on his resume. The panel concluded that employer had established a prima facie case for rejecting the applicant. Once employer satisfied its burden of presenting an objective detailed basis why, notwithstanding the apparent qualifications listed on his resume, the applicant was not capable of performing the job duties, the CO could have disputed this in various ways, including sending the applicant a follow-up questionnaire, and issuing a second NOF disputing employer's statements. LA Dye & Print Works, Inc. , 93- INA-223 (Apr. 13, 1995).\n\nThe only requirement for the position of \"Bookkeeper I Bilingual,\" was 2 years of experience and 2 applicants \"clearly\" met that requirement. The Employer rejected these applicants, arguing that it was unable to contact their references and that the applicants had failed to return a phone call. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. It reasoned that the applicant was not, based on information obtained from references or objective testing during the interview, demonstrably incompetent to perform the main duties of the position such that Employer could reject the applicant even though they met the stated requirements. See First Michigan Bank Corp, 92-INA-256 (July 28, 1994); Quality Inn , 89-INA-273 (May 23, 1990). Wah Yuan Trading Corp. , 94-INA-507 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nThe Board held on appeal after a Motion to Reconsider that the case should be remanded. The CO failed to consider an Employer's vice president's assertion that an applicant \"had a hard time understanding the interviewing officer and, when he answered the questions he, could not bring out his knowledge...\" The vice president had further stated that the applicant \"could not express ...[himself] in words...,\" although he was \"academically intelligent.\" The Board disagreed with the CO's finding that a response submitted by the applicant wherein he wrote, \"I have experience in civil/stru/soil eng'g...If I was not hired, there might have [sic] someone they thought more appropriate...I got letter [sic]...,\" demonstrated a command of the English language. The Employer lastly stated that clients in the past have asked for replacements when faced with an employee who cannot speak English well. The Board reasoned that the applicant may be, based on information obtained from references or objective testing during the interview, demonstrably incompetent to perform the main duties of the job such that Employer could reject him even though he met the stated requirements.

Testwell Craig Labs of N.J., Inc. , 94-INA-512 (Dec. 2, 1996).\n\nAn applicant was ostensibly qualified for the position of \"Tile Mason\" but the Employer claimed initially that the applicant was uninterested in the work location. However, the applicant claimed that \"I asked...[Employer] about the location of the job and told her that I would be able to work anywhere.\" The applicant further claimed that he was uninterested in the position because the Employer's agent informed him on the telephone that the wage would be $12.00 per hour even though the advertised wage was $26.54 per hour. In rebuttal to the NOF Employer claimed that the Employer's agent informed the applicant that the advertised salary \"was in accordance with Department of Labor regulations although Employer had initiated the application with a starting salary of $12.00, and therefore, would be [sic] the ultimate decision of Employer as to the specific salary...\" The Employer claimed that its agent was \"merely providing an administrative albeit tedious and time consuming, function of facilitating the prospective applicant to meet with Employer...\" The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. The Board held that the applicant was not, based on information obtained from references or objective testing during the interview, demonstrably incompetent to perform the main duties of the job such that Employer could reject him even though he met the stated requirements. It noted that the agent's initial contact was designed to discourage the applicant from pursuing the employment in question. See First Michigan Bank Corp, 92-INA-256 (July 28, 1994) ; Quality Inn , 89-INA-273 (May 23, 1990). Striano Contracting Corp. , 94-INA-509 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nEmployer sought labor certification for the position of \"Monitor, Sleep-In, Household\" and the state labor agency determined that one U.S. applicant was qualified for the position. However, Employer failed to either contact the applicant or submit a recruitment report (even though Employer did submit a letter addressed to the applicant and a narrative recounting its recruitment efforts concerning another applicant). The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. The Board reasoned that the applicant was not, based on information obtained from references or objective testing during the interview, demonstrably incompetent to perform the main duties of the job such that Employer could reject her even though she met the stated requirements. See First Michigan Bank Corp, 92-INA-256 (July 28, 1994) ; Quality Inn , 89-INA-273 (May 23, 1990). Cristina Clark , 94-INA-508 (Oct. 31, 1996).\n\nThe only requirement for the position of \"Bookkeeper I, Bilingual,\" was 2 years of experience and an applicant was \"ostensibly\" qualified for the position. The Employer rejected her, arguing that the applicant expressed a lack of interest. The applicant denied that she was uninterested and the CO denied labor certification. The Board affirmed, reasoning that the applicant was not, based on information obtained from references or objective testing during the interview, demonstrably incompetent to perform the main duties of the job such that Employer could reject the applicant even though she met the stated requirements. See First Michigan Bank Corp., 92-INA-256 (July 28, 1994) ; Quality Inn , 89-INA-273 (May 23, 1990). Wah Yuan Trading Corp. , 94-INA-507 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nEmployer sought labor certification for the position of live-in domestic, its duties including general \"housework, laundering, cleaning, cooking and child care.\" The Employer required 3 months of experience for the position and 1 of 4 applicants met that job requirement.

The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. It reasoned that the applicant was not, based on information obtained from references or objective testing during the interview, demonstrably incompetent to perform the main duties of the job such that the Employer could reject the applicant even though she met the stated requirements. See First Michigan Bank Corp, 92-INA-256 (July 28, 1994) ; Quality Inn , 89-INA-273 (May 23, 1990). Jane R.

The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. The Board reasoned that Employer could not reject 6 applicants on the basis that they lacked experience in the \"Sacramental Preparation of Students.\" Their resumes demonstrated that they met the alternative minimum requirement of one year as a teacher. The applicants were not, based on information obtained from references or objective testing during the interview, demonstrably incompetent to perform the main duties of the job such that Employer could reject them. See First ichigan Bank Corp, 92-INA-256 (July 28, 1994) ; Quality Inn , 89-INA-273 (May 23, 1990). Sacred Heart Sch. , 94-INA-510 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nEmployers may reject applicants who meet the stated minimum requirements but is nonetheless demonstrably incomepetent to perform the main duties of the job, based on information obtained from references or objective testing during interview.

Incorporation of job duties into requirement of \"experience in the job offered\"\n\nEmployer applied for certification for the position of Cook, Domestic, Live-in or Live-out. The Employer required 2 years of experience in the job offered. The CO issued a NOF proposing to deny certification because, among other reasons, it appeared as if the Employer hired Alien without the required experience. In rebuttal, Employer argued that Alien had experience in the job duties of Cook, domestic as opposed to the job title. A letter from a previous employer attached to the rebuttal and previous experience listed on the ETA 750A indicated that Alien had performed similar work for over two years. The CO denied certification and the Board affirmed. Citing National Inst. for Petroleum and Energy Research , 88-INA-535 (Mar. 17, 1989) (en banc) and Integrated Software Sys., Inc. , 88-INA-200 (July 6, 1988), the Board noted that \"experience in the job offered\" includes experience in the job duties as described and not just experience in the job title.

Currency of knowledge\n\nWhere Employer submits no documentation supporting its claim that applicant for the position of landscape gardner is unqualified because he has not worked for 3 years, then labor certification was properly denied because employers cannot reject an applicant for not possessing current knowledge without documentation. Ernie Vejar Landscape aintenance , 94-INA-189 (July 19, 1995).\n\nL. Lack of interest\n\n1. General lack of interest\n\nEmployer's unsubstantiated assertions that a U.S. worker was not interested in a managerial position is insufficient to establish lawful job-related reasons for rejecting the applicant where this is contradicted by the applicant. Topline Fashion , 94-INA- 398 (Apr. 19, 1995).The Employer unlawfully rejected a U.S. worker on grounds that the applicant \"was pursuing another position which paid significantly more than the job at issue. . ..\" The panel noted that there was no evidence of record to indicate that the job was offered to the applicant and rejected.

One applicant was \"ostensibly\" qualified for the position, although Employer asserted that the applicant was rejected because of lack of interest. The applicant denied that she was uninterested. The CO denied the Employer's application for certification and the Board affirmed. It reasoned that the applicant was considered qualified for the position and the Employer's recruitment was not conducted in good faith. Wah Yuan Trading Corp. , 94-INA-507 (Nov. 14, 1996).\n\nWhere an applicant has 6 years of experience applied for a job that requires 2 years, where Employer states that he was rejected because applicant said that he \"realized the job was too distant from his residence,\" then labor certification was properly denied because there is no documentation showing that Employer was ever contacted, was offered the job, and showed no interest in the job, or declined the job. Keiter Constr. Co. , 94-INA-188 (July 17, 1995).\n\nWhere Employer rejects 1 applicant for the position of landscape gardner on the basis that he did not show enthusiasm, then labor certification was properly denied because such a basis is not lawful without documentation. Ernie Vejar Landscape Maintenance , 94-INA-189 (July 19, 1995).\n\n2. Applicant's long-term career goals\n\nEmployer cannot assume that an applicant is not interested in long-term employment because his present job is in a different field. Tahoe Sierra Serv. , 93-INA-504 (Nov. 29, 1994).\n\nThe employer unlawfully rejected a U.S. applicant for \"'fear he would not be long-term (with) intensive training and possibility of conflict of interest\" and asserting that the applicant \"'does not appear to have long term job/craft in mind; and I see no talent towards the end of working (with) his hands, creatively.\" Roger Bowman Upholstering , 91-INA-163 (May 18, 1992).\n\nAn employer may not reject a U.S. worker where the employer filled the petitioned position with a U.S. worker who quit three days later and Employer never contacted a second U.S. worker who applied for the job.

Roy Rogers Restaurant , 92-INA-288 (July 1, 1993).\n\nM. Overqualified U.S. applicant\n\nLabor certification denied where applicant rejected as \"overqualified\". oreover, the applicant's failure to appear at a post-NOF interview scheduled 2-3 weeks after the initial recruitment does not document that the applicant was uninterested in the position at the time of initial recruitment.
