No. 337-TA-524\n\nITC INSTITUTES SECTION 337 INVESTIGATION ON CERTAIN POINT OF SALE TERMINALS AND COMPONENTS THEREOF\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has voted to institute an investigation of certain point of sale terminals and components thereof. The products at issue in this investigation are point of sale terminals for credit and debit transactions, which are used at checkout counters in retail establishments. These terminals process transactions as either a debit or a credit one based upon data recorded on the card.\n\nThe investigation is based on a complaint filed by Verve, L.L.C., of Austin, TX, on August 2, 2004, alleging violations of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 in the importation into the United States, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain point of sale terminals and components thereof that infringe a patent owned by Verve L.L.C. Supplements to the complaint were filed on August 9, 19, and 23, 2004. The complainant requests that the ITC issue an exclusion order and cease and desist orders.\n\nThe ITC has identified the following as respondents in this investigation:\n\nThales e-Transactions, Inc., of Atlanta, GA;\n\nThales Group of France;\n\nCyberNet, USA, Inc., of San Jose, CA;\n\nCyberNet, Inc., of Korea;\n\nLipman USA, Inc., of Syosset, NY;\n\nLipman Electronic Engineering, Ltd., of Rosh Haayin, Israel;\n\nHypercom Corporation of Phoenix, AZ;\n\nVeriFone, Inc., of Alpharetta, GA;\n\nIngenico Corp. USA of Atlanta, GA;\n\nIngenico of France;\n\nTrintech Inc. of Addison, TX; and\n\nTrintech Group PLC of Ireland.\n\nBy instituting this investigation (337-TA-524), the ITC has not yet made any decision on the merits of the case. The case will be referred to the Honorable Charles E. Bullock, an ITC administrative law judge, who will schedule and hold an evidentiary hearing. Judge Bullock will make an initial determination as to whether there is a violation of section 337; that initial determination is subject to review by the Commission.\n\nThe ITC will make a final determination in the investigation at the earliest practicable time. Within 45 days after institution of the investigation, the ITC will set a target date for completing the investigation. ITC remedial orders in section 337 cases are effective when issued and become final 60 days after issuance unless disapproved for policy reasons by the President of the United States within that 60-day period.\n\n-- 30 --"
