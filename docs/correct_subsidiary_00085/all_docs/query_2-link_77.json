        "text": "•\n\nNorth America net revenuesdecreased$69.9 million, due primarily to reduced demand for our EMV capable terminals by customers that had upgraded to products that support EMV requirements in the prior year.\n\n•\n\nLatin America net revenuesincreased$2.2 million, due primarily to a $13.3 million increase in Brazil as a result of the timing of purchase decisions by large customers, partially offset by an $11.1 million decrease throughout other Latin America markets.\n\n•\n\nEMEA net revenuesdecreased$2.3 million, due primarily to a $20.1 million decrease as a result of changes in timing of purchase decisions by large customers. The decrease was partially offset by an $8.1 million increase due to higher demand in new markets in the Middle East and a $10.3 million increase in net revenues from the acquisition of InterCard in December 2015. Net revenues also included a $6.8 million negative impact due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations.\n\n•\n\nAsia-Pacific net revenues increased$10.3 million, due primarily to a $16.8 million increase in India as a result of increased demand due to government demonetization initiatives. The increase was partially offset by a $5.4 million decrease in Australia due to reduced demand from some of our large banking customers that were upgrading and expanding terminals at their merchant customers in prior year.\n\n•\n\nNet revenues from the sale of countertop and pinpad devices decreased $56.6 million, due primarily to reduced customer demand for our EMV capable terminals in North America, as well as certain territories in Latin America due primarily to timing of purchase decisions by large customers.\n\n•\n\nNet revenues from the sale of multilane products decreased $19.2 million due primarily to reduced demand for our EMV capable devices by certain Tier 1 retailers in North America that had upgraded to products that support EMV requirements in the prior year.\n\n•\n\nNet revenues from the sale of portable and mobile devices increased by $5.3 million due primarily to increased demand in India related to the demonetization initiatives and changes in demand in Brazil and Europe related to the timing of customer tenders and projects.\n\n•\n\nOperating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased due primarily to changes in geographic and product mix, such as changes from Systems net revenues from North America, which generally have a higher margin compared to other geographies.\n\n•\n\nintroductions of competitive products, including products that customers may perceive as having better functions and features, and alternative payment solutions, such as mobile payments and processing, at the POS; and\n\n•\n\ndelays in the implementation, including obtaining certifications, delivery and customer acceptance of our products and services, which may impact the timing of our recognition, and amount, of net revenues;\n\n•\n\ndevelopment of new customer and distributor relationships or new types of customers, penetration of new markets and maintenance and enhancement of existing relationships with customers, distributors and strategic partners, as well as the mix of customers in a particular quarter;\n\n•\n\nchanges in credit card interchange and assessment fees, which are set by the credit card networks and are a component of the cost of providing some of our product offerings, including transaction services and in-taxi payments solutions;\n\n•\n\nthe introduction of new or stricter laws and regulations in jurisdictions where we operate, such as data protection and privacy laws and regulations, laws and regulations covering hazardous substances, or employment laws and regulations, that may cause us to incur additional compliance or implementation costs and/or costs to alter our business operations;\n\n•\n\nthe introduction of new laws and regulations, or changes in implementation of existing laws and regulations, in jurisdictions where we operate that may create uncertainty regarding the business operations of our customers or distributors, which may in turn lead to deferred or reduced orders from our customers or distributors; and\n\n•\n\nbusiness and operational disruptions or delays caused by political, social or economic instability and unrest, such as the ongoing significant civil, political and economic disturbances in Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and their spillover effect on surrounding areas as well as the political and military conditions in Israel and the Palestinian territories.\n\n•\n\nadapting our solutions to meet local requirements and regulations, and to target the specific needs and preferences of foreign customers, which may differ from our traditional customer base in the markets we currently serve;\n\n•\n\nchanges in trade relations and trade policy as a result of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, including implementation of or changes to trade sanctions, tariffs and embargoes;\n\n•\n\ndifferent and/or more stringent labor laws and practices, such as the mandated use of workers' councils and labor unions, or laws that provide for broader definitions of employer/employee relationships;\n\n•\n\nthe need to integrate the operations, business systems, and personnel of the acquired business, technology or product, including coordinating the efforts of the sales operations, in a cost-effective manner;\n\n•\n\nthe need to migrate our acquired businesses to our common enterprise resource planning information system and integrating all operations, sales, accounting, human resources and administrative activities for the combined company, all in a scalable, cost-effective and timely manner;\n\n•\n\nin the case of international acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different jurisdictions, cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, foreign currency, political, legal, compliance and regulatory risks, including with respect to countries where we previously had limited operations;\n\n•\n\nthe need to integrate each company's accounting, legal, management, information, human resource and other administrative systems to enable effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or unsuccessful;\n\n•\n\nthe need to implement controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a larger public company at companies that prior to acquisition had lacked such controls, procedures and policies and the potential stress on our existing controls, particularly in integrating multiple acquired companies;\n\n•\n\nthe risk that increasing complexity inherent in operating a larger global business and managing a broader range of solutions and service offerings may impact the effectiveness of our internal controls and adversely affect our financial reporting processes;\n\n•\n\nthe failure to adequately identify or assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to acquiring a company, which could result in unexpected litigation, unanticipated liabilities, additional costs, unfavorable accounting treatment or other adverse effects; and\n\n•\n\nthe dependency on the retention and performance of key management and employees of acquired businesses for the day-to-day management and future operating results of these businesses.\n\n•\n\nthe manufacturing processes at our third-party contract manufacturers could become concentrated in a shorter time period. This concentration of manufacturing could increase manufacturing costs, such as costs associated with the expediting of orders, and negatively impact our gross margins. The risk of higher levels of obsolete or excess inventory write-offs would also increase if we were to hold higher inventory levels to counteract this effect;\n\n•\n\nthe higher concentration of orders may make it difficult to accurately forecast component requirements and, as a result, we could experience a shortage of the components needed for production, possibly delaying shipments and causing lost orders;\n\n•\n\nif we are unable to fill orders at the end of a quarter, shipments may be delayed. This could cause us to fail to meet our revenue and operating profit expectations for a particular quarter and could increase the fluctuation of quarterly results if shipments are delayed from one fiscal quarter to the next or orders are canceled by customers; and\n\n•\n\nin order to fulfill orders at the end of a quarter, we may be forced to deliver our products using air freight which would result in increased distribution costs.\n\n•\n\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less-leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources.\n\n•\n\nauthorization of the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock without the need for action by stockholders;\n\n•\n\nthe amendment of our organizational documents only by the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the shares of our capital stock entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n\n•\n\nprovision that any vacancy on the board of directors, however occurring, including a vacancy resulting from an enlargement of the board, may only be filled by vote of the directors then in office;\n\n•\n\nchanges in our financial guidance or financial estimates by any securities analysts who might cover our stock, or our failure to meet our financial guidance or the estimates made by securities analysts;\n\n•\n\nchanges in the market valuations of other companies operating in our industry or in the technology sector;"
