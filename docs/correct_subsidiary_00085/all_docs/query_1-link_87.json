This expansion aligns with our multiyear capacity expansion targets and further strengthens our earnings generation capabilities in 2024 and beyond.\n\nOur strong results in 2023 were the result of the successful operation of new projects that we launched in 2022 and the commercial operation of our geothermal, solar PV and energy storage portfolio throughout the year. In addition, in May 2023, we successfully brought our Heber 1 power plant in California back online following a shutdown due to a fire incident that occurred in February 2022. The Heber complex is now generating approximately 91MW.\n\nIn 2024, we expect to continue capturing the benefits of our successful growth strategy, further expand our capacity in the electricity and storage segments and increase our revenues. We are committed to investing in high-quality geothermal and energy storage assets to position us for continued growth, while also contributing to the global push to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions and utilize the worlds renewable energy resources.\n\nOur core business operations are dedicated to addressing critical energy resilience and climate challenges and we are currently benefiting from the tailwinds supporting domestic geothermal and energy storage driven by such global decarbonization efforts.\n\nWe remain firm in our dedication to delivering value to our stockholders and advancing sustainable communities and economies in the regions in which we operate.\n\nIn 2023, we issued a comprehensive sustainability report for 2022 in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards and the standards of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”). This was the Company’s fifth sustainability report written according to the GRI standards and the third guided by SASB’s requirements and recommendations. During 2022, we saw an impressive 19% reduction in our annual average Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and a 25% reduction in GHG emissions intensity, compared to our 2019 baseline levels.\n\nAs a renewable energy company with unique geothermal technology, we believe that renewable energy providers like us play a pivotal role in the global fight against climate change. We offer communities around the world a clean, reliable and sustainable power source. We take this role very seriously and are proud of our dedicated and talented workforce and their commitment to Ormat’s mission. We see a bright future at Ormat and appreciate your trust and confidence in our company.\n\nThank you for your investment in Ormat.\n\nIsaac Angel\n\nChairman of the Board Doron Blachar\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nNOTICE OF 2024 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 4 2024 PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 7 Who We Are 7 Our Executive Officers 11 PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 15 Nominees For Election To The Board Of Directors In 2024 15 Our Board’s Skills, Experience And Backgrounds 19 How Our Board Is Selected And Evaluated 21 How Our Board Is Organized And Governed 22 How Our Board Exercises Oversight 28 Director Compensation 31 PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 32 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 33 Executive Summary 34 2023 Highlights 34 Compensation Objectives And Design 35 Compensation Elements 36 Views Of Our Stockholders 37 Compensation Governance 37 Roles And Responsibilities 37 2023 Compensation Determinations 38 Other Compensation Elements 43 Fiscal 2024 Compensation 44 Compensation Committee Report 44 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 45 Summary Compensation Table 45 Grants Of Plan-Based Awards In 2023 46 Employment Agreements 47 Outstanding Equity Awards At Fiscal Year End 49 Option Exercises And Stock Vested In 2023 51 Pension Plans 51 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation 51 Potential Payments Upon Termination Or Change In Control 52 PAY RATIO 54 CEO Pay Ratio 54 Identifying The Median Employee 54 PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE 55 Pay Versus Performance Table 55\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\nPROPOSAL 3 – RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 59 Appointment Of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 59 Audit And Non-Audit Fees 59 Audit Committee Pre-Approval Procedures For Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 60 Audit Committee Report 60 PROPOSAL 4 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY’S FOURTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION TO LIMIT THE LIABILITY OF CERTAIN OFFICERS 61 PROPOSAL 5 – APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT TO THE COMPANY’S SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED 2018 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN TO INCREASE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED THEREUNDER 63 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 71 Transactions With ORIX 71 REVIEW, APPROVAL OR RATIFICATION OF TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS 73 EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN INFORMATION 74 SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 75 DELINQUENT SECTION 16(A) REPORTS 76 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 77 OTHER MATTERS 80 OTHER INFORMATION 80 Householding Of Proxies 80 Additional Filings 80 Annual Report To Stockholders 80 Stockholder Proposals For 2025 Annual Meeting Of Stockholders 81 CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 82 Helpful Resources A-1\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT\n\nNOTICE OF 2024 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS\n\nThe Board of Directors (the “Board”) of Ormat Technologies, Inc.

(“Ormat” or the “Company”) is making this Proxy Statement available to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies on its behalf for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the “Annual Meeting” or the “2024 Annual Meeting”). The Annual Meeting will be held on May 8, 2024 at 3:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time. The Annual Meeting will be a completely virtual meeting, which will be conducted via live audio webcast.\n\nThis summary highlights information about the Company and certain information contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. You should read the entire Proxy Statement carefully before voting.\n\nWHO WE ARE\n\nAt Ormat, we’re always on, delivering renewable power and energy solutions to our customers around the clock and around the world. Clean, reliable energy solutions provided from geothermal power, recovered energy, as well as solar photovoltaic (“PV”) and energy storage solutions, is our expertise, commitment and focus.\n\nWith over five decades of experience, Ormat is a leading geothermal company and the only vertically integrated company engaged in geothermal and recovered energy generation (“REG”), with robust plans to accelerate long-term growth in the energy storage market and to establish a leading position in the U.S. energy storage market. Ormat owns, operates, designs, manufactures and sells geothermal and REG power plants primarily based on the Ormat Energy Converter—a power generation unit that converts low-, medium- and high-temperature heat into electricity. Ormat has engineered, manufactured and constructed power plants, which it currently owns or has installed for utilities and developers worldwide, totaling approximately 3,200MW of gross capacity, including geothermal and REG sites, as of December 31, 2023. Ormat leverages its core capabilities in the geothermal and REG industries and its global presence to expand its activities in clean energy production and energy storage solutions.\n\nOrmat’s current total generating portfolio is 1,385MW with a 1,215MW geothermal solar PV and REG generation portfolio that is spread globally in the U.S., Kenya, Guatemala, Indonesia, Honduras, and Guadeloupe, and an 170MW energy storage portfolio that is located in the U.S. We are motivated to identify our opportunities and risks with respect to climate change and take efforts to reduce our environmental impact as it relates to climate, water use, and waste reduction. Our geothermal power plants have significantly lower emissions of carbon dioxide compared to power plants that run on coal or other fossil fuels and provide a consistent and stable power supply, making them an ideal source of renewable ‘baseload’ power.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 07\n\nAt the core of our business strategy, we strive to advance a number of goals and work toward accomplishing them in several ways:\n\nOrmat has been sustainably generating power since 1965, and we remain committed to providing renewable energy safely, economically, and in an environmentally responsible manner. We are committed to accomplishing our goals in a transparent, ethical manner that supports the development and growth of our employees, partners, investors, and the communities in which we operate. As such, a focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues is part of our DNA, and we seek to ensure that our business and ESG strategies are fundamentally aligned. We previously set a target of five percent annual average absolute reduction in Scope 1 (direct emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions) GHG emissions measured against the 2019 base levels and exceeded this target in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nDue to our growth and expected future growth both in the geothermal and energy storage segments, we determined in 2023 to set an intensity reduction goal, as opposed to an absolute reduction goal, which we believe is better suited to our emissions profile. Our target is now five percent annual reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity (tCO 2e/MWh) compared to our 2019 base year.\n\nEstablishment of ESG Committee in 2023\n\nIn 2023, the Board of Directors established an ESG Committee as part of the Company’s commitment to environmental, social and governance matters, with a particular emphasis on environmental matters.\n\nWe also align our disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”), as well as with the GRI Standards and SASB standards.\n\nWe report our progress on environmental goals and commitments annually in our Sustainability Reports, including, but not limited to, our climate change mitigation measures, biodiversity conservation, and water management efforts. A copy of our most recent Sustainability Report is accessible, free-of-charge, in the Sustainability section of our website at www.ormat.com. The contents of our website, including the Sustainability Reports, are not part of or otherwise incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement.\n\nAt Ormat, we are committed to the advancement and development of people—both our employees and the members of the communities where we operate. We are dedicated to creating a work environment that is diverse and inclusive, based on the principles of equality for all people. We believe diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) is a key component for developing innovative, diverse ideas and for supporting every employee in reaching their individual potential. As of December 31, 2023, we employed 1,576 employees and are committed to hiring from local communities.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 08\n\nKey Highlights\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 09\n\nStrategic Highlights\n\n• Completed a 6MW upgrade to the Dixie Valley power plant in Nevada, which allows the Company to maximize its favorable long-term power purchase agreement. • Completed the 6MW Brady solar facility that supply the auxiliary needs of the Brady geothermal power plant and thereby increasing the net geothermal power sold to the grid. • Successfully resumed operations at the Heber 1 power plant in California, after the plant temporarily shut down due to a fire incident that occurred in February 2022. • Received Hawai‘i Public Utilities Commission’s approval of the Power Purchase Agreement between Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) and Hawaiian Electric.

Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has considered and nominated the following slate of nominees for a one-year term expiring in 2025: Isaac Angel, Ravit Barniv, Karin Corfee, David Granot, Michal Marom, Mike Nikkel, Dafna Sharir, Stanley B. Stern, and Byron G. Wong. Hidetake Takahashi has not been nominated for re-election and will serve until the expiration of his current term at the Annual Meeting; Mr Takahashi was previously nominated by ORIX, whose nomination rights were reduced as a result of its equity sell-down in 2023. For more information, see “Transactions with Related Persons—Transactions with ORIX.” The Board, based upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, determined to nominate Ravit Barniv to serve as a director if she is elected by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Action will be taken at the Annual Meeting for the election of these nominees.\n\nIt is intended that the proxies delivered pursuant to this solicitation will be voted in favor of the election of Isaac Angel, Ravit Barniv, Karin Corfee, David Granot, Michal Marom, Mike Nikkel, Dafna Sharir, Stanley B. Stern, and Byron G. Wong, except in cases of proxies bearing contrary instructions. In the event that these nominees should become unavailable for election, the persons named in the proxy will have the right to use their discretion to vote for a substitute in accordance with SEC rules.\n\nElection of each director nominee requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of votes cast for the election of each director at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and “broker non-votes” will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.\n\nOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES NAMED ABOVE.\n\nNOMINEES FOR ELECTION TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 2024\n\nThe following information describes the offices held and other business directorships of each nominee required to be disclosed by SEC rules. Beneficial ownership of equity securities of the nominees is shown under the section entitled “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management” below.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 15\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 16\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 17\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 18\n\nOUR BOARD’S SKILLS, EXPERIENCE AND BACKGROUNDS\n\nBoard Highlights\n\n6 directors with gender and/or ethnic or racial diversity 1 director former CFO 4 directors current or former CEOs 7 directors with international experience\n\nBoard Credentials and Diversity\n\nIn considering each director nominee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board evaluated such person’s key qualifications, skills, experience and perspectives that he or she could bring to the Board, as well as existing commitments to other businesses, professional experience, understanding of the Company’s business environment and the composition and combined expertise of the existing Board. Certain of the skills considered by the Board are summarized in the matrix below. The fact that a particular qualification, skill, experience or perspective is not listed below does not mean that the nominee does not possess it or that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board did not evaluate it.\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers traditional diversity factors such as age, gender and ethnic and racial background as set forth in the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. In addition, under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board shall at all times include a minimum of two female directors, subject to periods of director transitions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee makes recommendations to the Board to ensure it is composed of directors with sufficiently diverse and independent backgrounds. The matrix below also provides additional information regarding our directors’ self-identified gender and race/ethnicity. Aggregate information regarding the Board throughout this section assumes Ms. Barniv’s election.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 19\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 20\n\nBoard Tenure\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee strives to maintain a healthy degree of Board refreshment and prevent entrenchment, while weighing the strong contributions delivered by directors with deep knowledge of our Company’s history and strategic long-term goals. Our Board is periodically refreshed with the addition of candidates whom we believe bring new ideas and fresh perspectives into the boardroom. We have added four new directors since 2019. As shown below, the Board’s balanced approach to Board tenure has resulted in an appropriate mix of long-serving and newer directors (which reflects the composition of the Board following the Annual Meeting assuming the election of all director nominees).\n\nHOW OUR BOARD IS SELECTED AND EVALUATED\n\nDirector Independence and Independence Determinations\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange listing standards require a majority of our directors and each member of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to be independent. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE rules, a director is not independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that he or she does not have a direct or indirect material relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Board’s policy is to review and determine the independence of all incumbent directors annually, and to review and determine the independence of new director nominees and appointees when nominated or appointed.\n\nThe Board has established guidelines of director independence to assist it in making independence determinations, which conform to the independence requirements in the NYSE listing standards. In addition to applying these guidelines, which are set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board will consider all relevant facts and circumstances in making an independence determination. In the event a director has a relationship with the Company that is relevant to his or her independence and is not addressed by the independence guidelines, the Board will determine in its judgment whether such relationship is material.\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee undertook its annual review of director independence and made a recommendation to our Board regarding director independence. As a result of this review, our Board affirmatively determined that all of the director nominees and directors serving during Fiscal 2023, other than Mr. Angel, are independent under the guidelines for director independence set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and for purposes of applicable NYSE standards, including with respect to committee service.\n\nOur Board has also affirmatively determined that (i) each current member, each member who served during Fiscal 2023 and each nominee who will serve on our Audit Committee, assuming his or her election, is “independent” for purposes of audit committee membership under the applicable SEC rules and NYSE listing standards, and (ii) each current member, each member who served during Fiscal 2023 and each nominee who will serve on our Compensation Committee, assuming his or her election, is “independent” for purposes of compensation committee membership under the applicable SEC rules and NYSE listing standards.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 21\n\nBoard Recruitment Process\n\nCandidate Identification\n\nCandidates may come to the attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee through current Board members, management, stockholders or other persons. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also utilize the services of professional search firms to identify and recruit qualified candidates for the Board.\n\nDirector candidates identified by stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner in which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates any other director candidates, as described below.\n\nAll recommendations for nomination received by the Corporate Secretary that satisfy our bylaw requirements relating to such director nominations will be presented to the Board for its consideration. Stockholders must, in particular, satisfy the notification, timeliness, consent and information requirements set forth in our bylaws. These requirements are also described under the section entitled “Stockholder Proposals for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.”\n\nCandidate Evaluation\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for conducting appropriate inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of potential director candidates and their suitability for service on our Board. In evaluating each candidate, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers guidelines it has developed that set forth the criteria and qualifications for Board membership, including, but not limited to, relevant knowledge and individual qualifications (including professional experience, understanding of the Company’s business environment, and diversity of background and experience), personal qualities of leadership (including strength of character, wisdom, judgment, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, and the ability to work collegially with others), potential conflicts of interest, existing commitments to other businesses, and legal considerations such as antitrust issues, independence under applicable SEC rules and regulations and the NYSE listing standards, and overall fit with the composition and expertise of the existing Board.\n\nThe Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to achieve diversity within the Board and works to further the Company’s goal of maintaining an environment free from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, national origin, disability, veteran status or any protected category under applicable law.\n\nThis process is designed to provide that the Board includes members with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience, including appropriate financial and other expertise relevant to the business of the Company. Accordingly, in determining the pool from which Board nominees are chosen, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is committed to seeking out highly qualified women and minority candidates, as well as candidates with diverse backgrounds, and experiences with the relevant mix of skills and other qualifying criteria as described above.\n\nHOW OUR BOARD IS ORGANIZED AND GOVERNED\n\nOur Board manages or directs the business and affairs of the Company, as provided by Delaware law, and conducts its business and affairs through meetings of the Board and five standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Investment Committee, and the ESG Committee. In addition, from time to time, special committees may be established under the direction of the Board of Directors when necessary to address specific issues. The following shows an overview of the composition of our Board, as further detailed in the below sections of this Proxy Statement.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 22\n\nBoard Leadership Structure\n\nOur Policy\n\nThe Board maintains the flexibility to determine whether the roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO should be combined or separated, based on what it believes is in the best interests of the Company at a given point in time. The Board believes that this flexibility is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. The Board believes that one leadership structure is not more effective at creating long-term stockholder value, and the decision of whether to combine or separate the positions of CEO and Chairman should depend on a company’s particular circumstances at a given point in time. Specifically, an effective governance structure must balance the powers of the CEO and the independent directors and ensure that the independent directors are fully informed, are ready to discuss and debate the issues that they deem important, and are able to provide effective oversight of management. Our Board also believes that it should retain the flexibility to make this determination in the manner it feels will provide the most appropriate leadership for the Company from time to time. Our Chairman is appointed annually by the Board.\n\nOur Current Board Leadership Structure\n\nThe Board’s leadership structure is designed to promote Board effectiveness and to appropriately allocate authority and responsibility between the Board and management. The Board believes that separating the Chair and CEO positions continues to be the appropriate leadership structure for the Company at this time, as it provides the Company and the Board with strong leadership and independent oversight of management and allows the CEO to focus primarily on the management and operation of our business. Factors that the Board considers in reviewing its leadership structure and making this determination include, but are not limited to, the current composition of the Board, the policies and practices in place to provide independent Board oversight of management, the Company’s circumstances and the views of our stockholders and other stakeholders.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 23\n\nBoard Committees\n\nThe Board of Directors has adopted written charters for each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, ESG Committee and Investment Committee. The charters of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, ESG Committee and Investment Committee are available on the Company’s website in the “Investor Relations” section of our website at www.ormat.com. As noted above, all members are “independent” under applicable standards.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 24\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 25\n\nBoard Service Policies\n\nTime commitment and expectation on meeting attendance and active participation\n\n• All directors are expected to make every effort to attend our annual meeting of stockholders.\n\n• All directors are expected to make every effort to attend all meetings of the Board and meetings of the committees of which they are members, and to meet as frequently as necessary in order to properly discharge their responsibilities.\n\nOverboarding policy\n\n• The Company values the experience that our directors bring from other boards on which they serve but recognizes that those boards may also present demands on a director’s time and availability and may present conflicts or legal issues.\n\n• In 2023, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended, and the Board approved, an amendment to our Corporate Governance Guidelines which provided that no director may serve on more than four public company boards (including the Company’s Board).\n\n• No member of the Audit Committee may serve on more than three public company audit committees (including the Company’s Audit Committee).\n\n• Without specific approval from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, directors who also serve as chief executive officers or in equivalent positions generally should not serve on more than two public company boards (including the Company’s Board), in addition to their employer’s board.\n\nTerm limits\n\n• The Board has a 15-year term limit. We believe that maintaining an appropriate balance of tenure on the Board allows us to benefit from both the historical and institutional knowledge of longer-tenured directors as well as the additional, fresh perspectives contributed by newer directors.\n\n• Under this policy, directors will not be nominated for re-election to the Board if they have served on the Board for more than 15 years at the time of such proposed nomination, subject to such waivers as may be granted under our Corporate Governance Guidelines.\n\nMeeting Attendance\n\nAll of the directors serving at the time of the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders attended the meeting. During 2023, (i) the Board met eight times, (ii) the Audit Committee met six times, (iii) the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met two times, (iv) the Compensation Committee met five times, (v) the ESG Committee met two times, and (vi) the Investment Committee met two times. No member of the Board attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board (held during the period for which he or she was a director) and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which such director served (held during the period that such director served).\n\nExecutive Sessions\n\nThe Board regularly meets in executive session, chaired by the Lead Independent Director, with no members of management present. The independent directors of the Board also meet in executive session with no members of management present. Each of the committees of the Board also meets regularly in executive session.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 26\n\nBoard and Committee Evaluations\n\nEvery year, the Board and each of its committees evaluate and discuss their respective performance and effectiveness. The Board and committee evaluation for 2023 was led by our General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary. These evaluations were conducted by providing each director with detailed questionnaires relating to the Board and its committees, covering a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to, the fulfillment of the Board and committee responsibilities identified in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and committee charters. All responses from directors are kept confidential and anonymous.\n\nSTEP 1:\n\nInitiation of Evaluations\n\nOur General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary initiates the annual evaluation process by presenting the proposed approach to the Board and distributing questionnaires to each director soliciting his or her opinions on Board performance and effectiveness.\n\nSTEP 2:\n\nBoard and Committee Assessment Questionnaires\n\nEach director completes a questionnaire addressing the Board’s knowledge and understanding of, and performance with respect to, the Company’s business, strategy, values, plans and mission, the appropriateness of the Board’s structure and composition, the communication among the directors and between the Board and management and the Board’s meeting process. Committee members additionally assess, among other topics, how the committee has satisfied the responsibilities contained in its charter, the organization of the committee, the committee meeting process and the committee’s oversight.\n\nSTEP 3:\n\nFollow-Up Interviews\n\nOur General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary reviews each questionnaire and conducts follow-up interviews with each director as necessary.\n\nSTEP 4:\n\nPresentation of Findings\n\nOur General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Secretary prepares and presents to the Board a report aggregating and summarizing for the Board and its committees the findings from the questionnaires and interviews.\n\nSTEP 5:\n\nImplementation of Feedback\n\nThe Board and its committees discuss the findings and consider what, if any, actions should be implemented to enhance future performance.\n\nGovernance Documents\n\nCode of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines\n\nWe have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that is applicable to all of our employees, executive officers and directors, as well as a Code of Ethics Applicable to Senior Executives that is applicable to our principal executive officers, principal financial officers, principal accounting officer and controller, and all persons performing similar functions, including our chief executive and senior financial officers. If we make any amendments to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or our Code of Ethics Applicable to Senior Executives or grant any waiver, including any implicit waiver, from a provision of either code applicable to our CEO, CFO, or principal accounting officer, we intend to disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our website within four business days to the extent required by SEC rules.\n\nWe have also adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, which, together with our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, establish the governance framework for the management of the Company. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are intended to align the interests of directors and management with those of our stockholders. The guidelines address, among other matters, the role of our Board, Board composition and committees, Board membership criteria, director independence, Board meetings, performance evaluation and succession planning.\n\nOur Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Code of Ethics Applicable to Senior Executives and Corporate Governance Guidelines are available in the “Investor Relations” section of our website at www.ormat.com.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 27\n\nORIX Governance Agreement\n\nOn May 4, 2017, the Company entered into a governance agreement with ORIX (the “Governance Agreement”) in connection with an agreement between ORIX, certain former stockholders of the Company, Isaac Angel, the Company’s current Chairman of the Board and former CEO, and Doron Blachar, the Company’s CEO, pursuant to which ORIX agreed to purchase approximately 22.1% of our shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), for approximately $627 million (the “ORIX Transaction”). The Governance Agreement, which became effective on July 26, 2017 upon the closing of the ORIX Transaction, provides ORIX the right, for as long as ORIX and its affiliates collectively hold at least 18% of the voting power of all of the Company’s outstanding voting securities, to nominate three directors to our Board and jointly propose and nominate with the Company a director who is independent in accordance with the listing standards of the NYSE and SEC rules and regulations and who does not have, and within the three years prior to his or her becoming a director nominee of the Company has not had, any material relationship with ORIX or its affiliates (the “Independent ORIX Director”). If ORIX and its affiliates collectively hold less than 18% of the voting power of all of the Company’s outstanding voting securities but greater than or equal to 13% of the voting power of all of the Company’s outstanding voting securities, ORIX has the right to nominate two directors to our Board and jointly propose and nominate with the Company the Independent ORIX Director. If ORIX and its affiliates collectively hold less than 13% of the voting power of all of the Company’s outstanding voting securities but greater than or equal to 5% of the voting power of all of the Company’s outstanding voting securities, ORIX will have the right to nominate one director to our Board, but will no longer have the right to jointly propose and nominate with the Company the Independent ORIX Director. If ORIX holds less than 5% of the voting power of all of the Company’s outstanding voting securities, ORIX does not have the right to nominate any directors to our Board. Additionally, (i) the Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and all other Board committees (other than the Audit Committee) must consist of two directors designated by the members of our Board that were not designated by ORIX and one director designated by ORIX and (ii) the Audit Committee must consist of two directors designated by the members of our Board that were not designated by ORIX and the Independent ORIX Director.\n\nOn April 13, 2020, the Company and ORIX entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Governance Agreement that facilitated the expansion of the Board of Directors in order to allow the addition of Mr. Angel as a director prior to his retirement as CEO of the Company on July 1, 2020. See “Transactions with Related Persons” below for further information concerning the ORIX Transaction, the Governance Agreement and the Amendment.\n\nIn November 2022, ORIX sold 4,312,500 shares pursuant to an underwritten secondary offering, resulting in it and its affiliates collectively owning 11.9% of the voting power of our outstanding voting securities. ORIX now has the right to nominate one director to our Board, but no longer has the right to jointly propose and nominate with the Company the Independent ORIX Director. Pursuant to the Governance Agreement, ORIX was required to use its reasonable best efforts to cause two of the directors nominated by it to tender their resignations, unless a majority of the directors other than the directors appointed by ORIX agreed in writing that such directors were not required to resign. A majority of the members of our Board agreed that none of the directors nominated by ORIX were required to resign following the offering in 2023 and that such directors could continue to serve on our Board until the 2024 Annual Meeting.\n\nFor the Annual Meeting, ORIX has proposed the nomination of one director, Mr. Nikkel. ORIX additionally has the right to appoint one member to the Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Investment Committee and ESG Committee, and the Board has, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determined not to change the composition of certain of these committees following the Annual Meeting, assuming the election of all director nominees (specifically, with Mr. Nikkel to continue serving on the Compensation Committee and Investment Committee, and ORIX declining to use its right to appoint Mr. Nikkel to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the ESG Committee). For more information, see the second table under “Board Committees” above.\n\nHOW OUR BOARD EXERCISES OVERSIGHT\n\nThe Board directs and oversees the management of the business and affairs of the Company in a manner consistent with the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders and focusing on multiple factors.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 28\n\nStrategy\n\nThe Board takes an active role in assisting management with the development of the Company’s strategy, strategic oversight of operations, and financial and investment activities. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, at least one Board meeting annually is devoted to our long-term business strategy. At these meetings, the Board and management discuss the competitive landscape in our industry, emerging technologies, significant business risks and opportunities, and strategic priorities of the Company. Specific short- and long-term strategic plans are also discussed on an as-needed basis throughout the year, and our senior management team regularly reports to the Board on the execution of our long-term strategic plans, the status of important projects and initiatives, and the key opportunities and risks facing the Company.\n\nRisk Oversight\n\nOur Board’s role in risk oversight at the Company is consistent with the Company’s leadership structure, with the CEO and other members of senior management having responsibility for assessing and managing the Company’s risk exposures, and our Board and its committees providing oversight in connection with those efforts and attempts to mitigate identified risks.\n\nOur Board assesses on an ongoing basis the risks faced by the Company in executing its business plans, in part based on regular updates from management and its committees on such risks and the related risk mitigation measures. Updates from management include quarterly reports by our CEO and CFO outlining operational risks and financial risks, respectively. Our Audit Committee oversees the Board’s responsibilities relating to cybersecurity risks, and is informed of such risks through reports from our Chief Information Officer on at least an annual basis. ESG and climate change considerations are factored into the business strategy through the recognition of risks and opportunities.\n\nWhile our full Board is ultimately responsible for oversight of risk management, its committees critically assist the Board in fulfilling its monitoring responsibilities in certain areas of risk, as shown below.\n\nBoard/Committee Key Areas of Risk Oversight Entire Board\n\n• Strategic, financial, industrial, competitive and operational risks and exposures;\n\n• Technological risks, including cybersecurity and information technology risks and developments;\n\n• Litigation and regulatory exposures;\n\n• Climate change, social and other ESG related risks, strategies and approach; and\n\n• Other current matters that may present material risk to our operations, plans, prospects or reputation, both from a global perspective and on a power plant-by-power plant basis.\n\nAudit Committee\n\n• Risks and exposures associated with financial matters, including financial reporting, tax, accounting, and disclosure;\n\n• Audit oversight;\n\n• Internal control over financial reporting (including the internal controls related to ESG disclosures and metrics);\n\n• Internal audit; and\n\n• Cybersecurity and information technology risks and developments.\n\nCompensation Committee\n\n• Risks relating to whether compensation plans, policies and practices are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company; and\n\n• Risks relating to alignment of compensation with Company performance goals and appropriate balance between different types of compensation.\n\nInvestment Committee • Financial risk exposures, particularly risks and exposures associated with cash investment guidelines, financial risk policies and hedging activities. ESG Committee • ESG risks and opportunities, including climate-related risks and opportunities\n\nManagement Succession Planning\n\nWe believe succession planning, including succession in the event of an emergency or retirement of our CEO, is an important function of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, with input from our CEO, is responsible for identifying possible successors to our CEO and developing a succession plan, which includes, among other things, an assessment of the experience, performance and skills for possible successors to the CEO. As provided by our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the plan is annually reviewed by the entire Board.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 29\n\nStockholder Engagement\n\nStockholder engagement is fundamental to our commitment to good governance. We engage regularly with our investors to share updates on our strategic, financial and operating performance, and to listen to valuable feedback on issues our Stockholders care about most. Additionally, at least once a year our management invites the Company’s largest stockholders to engage in a dialogue regarding governance, compensation, sustainability and other matters important to them. Management reports on the conversations with those investors to the Board and also, as appropriate, to the Compensation Committee.\n\n| Ormat’s 2022 Analyst Day, New York\n\nCommunicating with our Board\n\nStockholders and other interested parties may communicate with a member or members of our Board, including the chairman of the Board, chair of the Audit, Compensation or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees or to the non-management or independent directors as a group by addressing such communications to the Corporate Secretary, Ormat Technologies, Inc., 6140 Plumas St., Reno, Nevada 89519. Such communications received from stockholders may be done confidentially or anonymously. Complaints or concerns relating to our financial reporting, accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing will be referred to the Chair of our Audit Committee. Correspondence will then be directed to the group of directors, or to an individual director, as appropriate.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 30\n\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nFISCAL 2023 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM\n\nThe compensation of our non-employee directors for Fiscal 2023 was as follows:\n\nAnnual Board Retainer $95,000 and an annual equity grant with a value of $120,000* Annual Retainer for Non-Employee Chairman of the Board $100,000 consisting of a $40,000 cash retainer and an equity grant with a value of $60,000* Annual Cash Retainer Committee Chair $10,000, except $20,000 for Audit Committee\n\n* Equity grant is in the form of RSUs, with the actual number of RSUs based on the closing price of our Common Stock on the next business day following the date of grant. The RSUs vest in full on the first anniversary of the grant date.\n\nWe also promptly reimburse all directors for transportation and lodging expenses actually incurred to attend meetings of our Board or committees.\n\nThe timing of compensation and the annual equity grants to non-employee directors runs from the time of the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders rather than at the end of each fiscal year and cash retainers, which are paid quarterly, are based on the annual meeting cycle rather than the fiscal year-end cycle.\n\nThe directors affiliated with ORIX at the time of the grant of the equity portion of the annual board retainers, Messrs. Nikkel and Takahashi, declined the grant of, and thus were deemed never to have acquired, the RSUs, which were subsequently cancelled for no value. They also forwent their cash compensation for the 2023 Board Term.\n\nThe following table sets forth the total compensation paid to each member of our Board during Fiscal 2023:\n\nName Fee Earned or\n\nPaid in Cash ($) Stock\n\nAwards($)(1) Total ($) Isaac Angel 135,000 180,000 315,000 Karin Corfee 105,000 120,000 225,000 David Granot 105,000 120,000 225,000 Michal Marom 115,000 120,000 235,000 Mike Nikkel(2) — — — Dafna Sharir 105,000 120,000 225,000 Stanley B.

At our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders voted to hold the non-binding stockholder vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers every year. Accordingly, the Company currently intends to hold such votes annually. The next such non-binding vote on executive compensation will be held at the Company’s 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\nThe present vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers is advisory and therefore not binding on the Company, our Board or our Compensation Committee. However, participating in such vote is an important mechanism by which our stockholders may convey their views about our executive compensation programs and policies. Our Board and Compensation Committee value stockholder input on these matters and will consider the results of this advisory vote, among other factors, in making future decisions about executive compensation for our named executive officers.\n\nThis vote relates to the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the following sections of this Proxy Statement:\n\n• the information set forth in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” on pages 33 to 44, which describes our compensation objectives and the various elements of our compensation program and policies applicable to our named executive officers; and • the accompanying tables, narrative disclosures and other information on pages 45 to 53, which describe how we have compensated our named executive officers.\n\nAs described in detail in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers and to incentivize superior performance. We believe that our executive compensation program directly links executive compensation with our performance and aligns the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders.\n\nThis vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation or any specific named executive officer, but rather the overall compensation of all of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we recommend that our stockholders vote upon the following resolution at the Annual Meeting:\n\n“RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the ‘Compensation Discussion and Analysis’, compensation tables and related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.”\n\nApproval of the compensation of our named executive officers on an advisory basis requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of our shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. Abstentions will count as votes “against” and “broker non-votes” will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.\n\nOUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE “FOR” THE APPROVAL, ON A NON-BINDING AND ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 32\n\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 34 - 2023 Highlights 34 - Compensation Objectives and Design 35 - Compensation Elements 36 - Views of Our Stockholders 37 COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE 37 - Roles and Responsibilities 38 - Other Compensation-Related Policies 38 2023 COMPENSATION DETERMINATIONS 38 - Annual Salary 38 - Management Plan 38 - Equity Awards 42 - Other Compensation Elements 43 FISCAL 2024 COMPENSATION 44 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 44\n\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis is designed to provide our stockholders with a clear understanding of our compensation philosophy and objectives, compensation-setting process and the Fiscal 2023 compensation of our named executive officers (“NEOs”). For 2023, our NEOs were:\n\nDORON BLACHAR ASSAF GINZBURG SHIMON HATZIR Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President\n\n—Electricity Segment\n\nOFER BEN YOSEF JESSICA WOELFEL Executive Vice President General Counsel, —Energy Storage and Chief Compliance Officer Business Development and Corporate Secretary\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 33\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n2023 Highlights\n\nDuring Fiscal 2023, we successfully executed our strategic plan by expanding our portfolio and improving our operational performance.\n\nWe believe that the Fiscal 2023 compensation of our NEOs appropriately reflects and rewards their significant contributions to the Company’s strong performance during a year that presented unique and unprecedented challenges for our executive team to manage.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 34\n\nCompensation Objectives and Design\n\nThe overall objective of our executive compensation program is to offer short-term, medium-term and long-term compensation elements that enable us to attract, motivate and retain talented executives who contribute to our continued success. Equally important to us is to align the interests of our NEOs with those of our stockholders by designing our executive compensation program to “pay for performance” and to incentivize the creation of stockholder value.\n\nWe aim to design executive compensation packages that meet competitive compensation averages for NEOs with similar responsibilities at companies with similar financial and operating characteristics in similar locations. In 2023 we did not benchmark to a particular industry or companies, but we informally considered published data, such as labor indices and compensation surveys, in formulating our executive compensation packages and consulted with compensation consultants in both the United States and Israel.\n\nThe key features of our executive compensation program are summarized below.\n\nWhat We Do What We Don’t Do Design key elements of our compensation program to pay based on our financial and operating performance. Use financial or operational metrics that promote excessive risk-taking. Use metrics important to our business in our incentive compensation plans and set challenging performance targets. Provide preferential payments or above-market returns on any deferred compensation plan. Use a variety of equity award structures, including PSUs and RSUs (as well as SARs and options historically), to tailor our compensation to our performance. Provide excessive perquisites to our executive officers. Regularly evaluate risk in light of our compensation programs. Allow our executive officers, employees or directors to hedge or pledge our stock. Cap the amount of our annual incentive pay at reasonable levels. Re-price underwater options. Promote long-term focus through multi-year vesting of our equity awards. Pay tax gross-ups. Grant PSU awards with a three-year performance period, and a four-year service period, based on challenging relative total shareholder return and Megawatts goals. Pay out dividends or dividend equivalents on equity awards prior to vesting. Maintain a formal claw-back policy applicable to our current and former executive officers. Pay guaranteed bonuses. Engage an independent compensation consultant. Provide automatic salary increases.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 35\n\nCompensation Elements\n\nOur executive compensation program consists of three elements, namely, annual salary, annual bonus and equity awards, with an emphasis on at-risk and/or long-term compensation\n\nElement Purpose Key Features SHORT-TERM FIXED COMPENSATION Annual Salary\n\n•\n\nMonthly cash compensation\n\n•\n\nProvides a predictable annual income at a level consistent with the individual’s contributions of our executive officers\n\nSee page 38 for more details MEDIUM-TERM VARIABLE COMPENSATION Management Plan\n\n•\n\nAnnual bonus opportunity based on challenging, pre-set performance metrics or other incentive- based compensation\n\n•\n\nLinks our executive officers’ compensation to the Company’s overall annual performance, as well as, in most cases, individual achievement\n\n2023 Metrics:\n\n•\n\nCompany Performance Metrics (Revenue, Adjusted EBITDA)\n\n•\n\nQuantitative individual performance criteria\n\n•\n\nQualitative CEO goals\n\nNo bonus paid unless net income is positive\n\nSee pages 42-43 for more details\n\nLONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS:\n\nMix of equity awards, typically granted each year, to promote long-term leadership and align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders\n\nPerformance Stock Units (PSUs)\n\n•\n\nFocuses executives on the achievement of specific long-term financial performance goals directly aligned with our operating and strategic plans\n\n•\n\nIncreased weight of PSUs (to approximately 60%)\n\nVesting: 3-year performance period (4-year service period)\n\nPerformance Metrics:\n\n•\n\n50% relative TSR\n\n•\n\n50% Megawatts capacity targets\n\nTSR Payout capped at 100% if absolute TSR is negative\n\nSee pages 42-43 for more details\n\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\n\n•\n\nAssists in retaining our executives to ensure execution of our long-term strategies\n\nVesting: 4 years\n\nWe determine each element individually based on the relevant criteria described in this discussion.\n\nIn addition to these main compensation components, our NEOs who are residents of Israel receive, as a function of their salary payments, the standard social benefits (namely, severance pay, defined contribution plan, and disability) paid to all of our employees who are based in Israel. These social benefits are fixed as a percentage of the NEO’s salary and are not subject to discretionary adjustments. NEOs who are residents of the United States participate in a defined contribution plan (401(k) plan) and receive health insurance benefits, in addition to Social Security. We do not cover any tax payments or otherwise “gross-up” any part of the compensation packages of our executive officers regardless of their location.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 36\n\nViews of our Stockholders\n\nThe Compensation Committee is committed to regularly reviewing, assessing and, when appropriate, adjusting the Company’s compensation programs based on feedback from our stockholders, best practices and compensation trends. At our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we received substantial support for our executive compensation program, with approximately 95% of the vote (excluding “broker non-votes”) for the approval of our annual “say-on-pay” proposal. We have ongoing discussions with many of our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program, and the Compensation Committee considers these discussions when reviewing our executive compensation program and will continue to consider stockholder feedback and the results of “say-on-pay” votes when making future decisions. The Compensation Committee believes the results of the fiscal 2023 “say-on-pay” vote convey positive stockholder support for its decisions on annual executive compensation and illustrate that the Company’s executive compensation program is aligned with our stated compensation philosophy and objectives and thus determined that significant changes to our executive compensation program were not warranted as a result of the outcome of the 2023 “say-on-pay” vote.\n\nCOMPENSATION GOVERNANCE\n\nRoles and Responsibilities\n\nRole of the Compensation Committee\n\nThe Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, oversees our executive compensation programs and met throughout Fiscal 2023. The Compensation Committee administers our annual cash bonus and long-term equity incentive plans and reviews performance levels relevant to compensation. It also decides the compensation of all named executive officers other than our CEO, seeks to ensure that all executive compensation is fair and aligned with our compensation policy, and makes recommendations to our Board of Directors with respect to the compensation of the CEO and our compensation practices generally. The CEO recuses himself from all Board discussions and decisions on his own compensation.\n\nThe Compensation Committee reviews all information presented and discusses the recommendations with the CEO and with our compensation consultant. In making decisions regarding pay levels and practices for our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers a variety of factors, including:\n\n• absolute corporate performance relative to our objectives; • creation of long-term value for our stockholders and stockholder views on compensation; and • feedback from stockholders and proxy advisers as part of outreach efforts.\n\nThe duties and responsibilities of the Compensation Committee are laid out in its charter, which can be found on our website, and described above under “How our Board is Organized—Board Committees.”\n\nRole of the Independent Compensation Consultant\n\nAs outlined in its charter, the Compensation Committee has the right to retain compensation consultants (and other outside consultants) to provide independent advice to the Compensation Committee. In Fiscal 2023, the Compensation Committee appointed F.W. Cook & Co. (“F.W. Cook”) as an independent outside compensation consultant. During Fiscal 2023, F.W. Cook provided general market data on compensation levels for the Company’s named executive officers, emerging trends in incentive metrics in executive compensation programs, and trends related to the executive clawback policies. As part of its annual independence assessment during Fiscal 2023 (cited under “—Annual Process” below), the Compensation Committee considered the six factors specified by the SEC in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and by Section 303A.05 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual to monitor the independence of its compensation consultant, and determined that F.W. Cook’s provision of services to the Company did not raise a conflict of interest.\n\nRole of Management\n\nEach year, the CEO provides an assessment of the performance of each named executive officer, other than himself, during the prior year and recommends to the Compensation Committee the compensation to be awarded to each such named executive officer, which is then determined by the Compensation Committee. The CEO’s recommendations are based on numerous factors including:\n\n• corporate and individual performance; • leadership competencies; and • market competitiveness.\n\nThe CEO also provides a self-assessment of his achievements for the prior year, which the Compensation Committee reviews and considers when making a recommendation for an appropriate level of compensation for the CEO to the Board for approval. The CEO does not participate in any deliberations regarding his own compensation.\n\nManagement of Compensation-Related Risk\n\nIn 2023, in consultation with our CEO and F.W. Cook, our Compensation Committee assessed our compensation plans, policies and practices for the named executive officers and other employees and concluded that they do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our Company. This risk assessment included, among other things, a review of our cash and equity incentive compensation plans to ensure that they are aligned with our Company performance goals and overall target total direct compensation to ensure an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay components. Our Compensation Committee conducts this assessment annually.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 37\n\nOther Compensation-Related Policies\n\nClaw-back Policy: We maintain a claw-back policy as required by the rules of the NYSE. Our claw-back policy covers each of our current and former executive officers. The policy provides that, subject to the limited exemptions provided by the NYSE rules, if the Company is required to restate its financial results due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements under the securities laws, the Compensation Committee must reasonably and promptly seek recovery of any cash- or equity-based incentive compensation (including vested and unvested equity) paid or awarded to the executive officer, to the extent that the compensation (i) was based on erroneous financial data and (ii) exceeded what would have been paid to the executive officer under the restatement. Recovery applies to any such excess cash- or equity-based bonus/other incentive compensation received by any covered executive officer, while he/she was an executive officer, on or after October 2, 2023 during the three completed fiscal years immediately preceding the date on which the Company determines an accounting restatement is required. For more information, see the full text of our claw-back policy, which is filed as an exhibit to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nAnti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies: Our insider trading policy prohibits, without exception, our executive officers, employees and directors from engaging in speculative transactions designed to decrease the risks of holding Company securities, such as short sales of Company securities and transactions in puts, calls, publicly-traded options and other derivative securities with respect to Company securities. The policy also forbids all of our executive officers, employees and directors from entering into hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts, which allow such individuals to continue to own Company securities without the full risks and rewards of ownership. In addition, our executive officers, employees and directors are prohibited, without exception, from pledging Company securities as collateral for loans and may not hold Company securities in margin accounts.\n\n2023 COMPENSATION DETERMINATIONS\n\nAnnual Salary\n\nConsistent with our objectives with respect to our executive officers, the Compensation Committee provides guidance in setting base salaries for the Company’s executive officers at levels that reflect the Compensation Committee’s interpretation of competitive compensation averages for individuals with similar responsibilities at companies with similar financial, operating and industry characteristics, in similar locations. From time to time, the Compensation Committee will undertake or commission a formal study or survey to benchmark compensation to a particular industry or to particular companies. The members of the Compensation Committee also evaluate executive compensation using their accumulated individual knowledge and industry experience, as well as publicly available compensation information with respect to companies that have a similar market capitalization or similar annual revenues, and that operate under a business structure similar to ours (although not necessarily in the same industry).\n\nIn addition, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration the performance of the Company, individual performance of each executive officer, and the individual executive officer’s scope of responsibility in relation to other officers and key executives within the Company. Salaries also reflect current practices within the specific geographic region and among executives holding similar positions. In addition to these factors, the annual salary for an executive officer depends on a number of more subjective factors, including our evaluation of the executive’s leadership role, professional contribution, experience and sustained performance.\n\nFollowing publication of the prior fiscal year’s audited financial statements, the CEO recommends to the Compensation Committee whether and the degree to which salary increases should be awarded to any of the executive officers. The CEO and the Compensation Committee will consider factors such as, but not limited to, the net income of the Company during the prior year, the need for a salary adjustment to remain competitive with compensation averages for executives in similar positions, and the individual executive officer’s effectiveness in supporting the Company’s long-term goals. We also consider the contribution to our success of the department of which the executive officer was in charge, as well as our general achievements made within that department and by the executive officer during the prior fiscal year. In 2023, the Compensation Committee increased our NEOs’ base salaries in amounts ranging from less than 1% to 13%, based on market data, job performance and each NEO’s responsibilities for Fiscal 2023. For Fiscal 2023, the base salaries of the NEOs were as follows: for Mr. Blachar, $565,000; for Mr. Ginzburg, $425,000; for Mr. Hatzir, $368,000; for Mr. Ben Yosef, $332,000; for Ms. Woelfel, $360,000.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 38\n\nManagement Plan\n\nEach year, following publication of our financial statements for the prior fiscal year, the Compensation Committee determines and approves the amount of any annual bonus payable to our CEO and, based upon the recommendations of our CEO, reviews and approves the annual bonus payable to our other executive officers.\n\nAnnual bonuses for our executive officers are payable in accordance with the Company’s Management Plan. Mr. Blachar’s eligibility for an annual cash bonus under the Management Plan is also governed by additional terms provided in his employment agreement (the “Blachar Employment Agreement”), which are described under “Executive Compensation Tables—Employment Agreements” below.\n\nThe Management Plan provides for annual cash bonuses for participating employees based on the achievement of certain performance metrics. At the beginning of each fiscal year, our CEO and the Compensation Committee review the Company’s objectives under the Company’s strategic plan and annual budget, the compensation practices of our peers, and other market data, and the CEO recommends performance metrics, which are measurable financial and operational goals, for the upcoming fiscal year for all executive officers other than himself. These measurable financial and operational goals may be with respect to the performance of the Company on a consolidated basis, the performance of the Company in a particular country or region, or the performance of a business unit or operating segment of the Company, including a geographically-based business unit.\n\nPerformance Metrics\n\nAfter taking into account the CEO’s recommendations, the Compensation Committee establishes (i) Company Performance Metrics (as defined in the Management Plan) applicable to all executive officers, (ii) other quantitative individual performance criteria for each executive officer (the “Individual Performance Metrics”) and (iii) qualitative “CEO Goals” for each executive officer. The “CEO Goals” include certain operational objectives for each executive officer, thus enabling the Compensation Committee to evaluate achievement based on both the executive officer’s individual performance and our overall Company performance during the covered fiscal year. Collectively, the metrics focus on financial and operational performance, our execution of our business plan, the individual performance of the executive officer, certain subjective assessments of the executive leadership and other contributions to and impacts by the executive officer on the Company.\n\nThe Compensation Committee sets target levels of achievement under each of such Company Performance Metrics, Individual Performance Metrics and CEO Goals, and assigns a weight to each of these three elements reflecting the contribution of achievement to the total payout. The Compensation Committee has the ability to adjust the targets once they are set for extraordinary events. The Management Plan provides that, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, for executive officers (other than Mr. Blachar) the Company Performance Metrics may not have a collective weight of less than 50%. The Compensation Committee determined that the Company Performance Metrics should have a weight of 40% in 2023 for these NEOs. For Mr. Blachar, as dictated by the Blachar Employment Agreement, the Company Performance Metrics and the Individual Performance Metrics must have a collective weight of 75%, and the CEO Goals must have a weight of 25%.\n\nORMAT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. | 2024 PROXY STATEMENT 39\n\nThe chart below indicates the rationale for the Company Performance Metric, the Individual Performance Metrics (as a group) and the CEO Goals (as a group), and the weighting of each"
