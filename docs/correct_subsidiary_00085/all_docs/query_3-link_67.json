        "text": "On Aug. 31, electronic payments equipment maker VeriFone Holdings (NYSE:PAY) released Q3 2006 earnings for the period ended July 31.\n\nWider margins plus increased sales equals happy shareholders, and VeriFone delivers on both counts this time.\n\nShare dilution is somewhat disappointing, though not outrageous. Those extra shares also complicate the finances a bit, accounting for $1.7 million of the operational costs.\n\nCash flows turned south because of a $40 million increase in inventories in the quarter. That's presumably a stock buildup in anticipation of a new product release in the next quarter, a touch-screen device that can accept EMV \"smart card\" payments.\n\n(Figures in thousands, except per-share data)\n\nIncome Statement Highlights\n\nGet back to basics with a look at the income statement.\n\nMargin Checkup\n\n*Expressed in percentage points.\n\nMargins are the earnings engine. See how they work.\n\nBalance Sheet Highlights\n\nLearn the ways of the balance sheet.\n\nCash Flow Highlights\n\nFind out why Fools always follow the money.\n\nRelated Companies:\n\nMicros Systems (NASDAQ:MCRS)\n\nTrintech Group (NASDAQ:TTPA)\n\nLipman Electronic Engineering (NASDAQ:LPMA)\n\nHypercom (NYSE:HYC)\n\nNCR (NYSE:NCR)\n\nDiebold (NYSE:DBD)\n\nRelated Foolishness:\n\nVeriFone: Doubling Down on Emerging Markets\n\nCredit or Debit, It's Too Late to Buy Here\n\nMicros Comes Up Huge: Fool by Numbers\n\nDiebold is a Motley Fool Inside Value recommendation, while Hypercom is a former Stock Advisor pick.\n\nFool by Numbers is designed to give you the raw earnings information in a timely fashion, putting all the numbers you need in one easy-to-read place. But at The Motley Fool, we believe numbers tell only part of the story, so check Fool.com for more of our in-depth discussion of what the numbers mean."
