        "text": "Filed by VeriFone Holdings, Inc.\n\nPursuant to Rule 425 under the Securities Act of 1933\n\nand deemed filed pursuant to Rule 14a-12\n\nof the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n\nSubject Company: Lipman Electronic Engineering Ltd.\n\nCommission File No.: 000-50544\n\nFrom: Doug Bergeron.\n\nSent: Friday, September 08, 2006 7:12 AM\n\nTo: i_staff\n\nSubject: Update Announcement\n\nOn September 6, we passed another milestone with the announcement that the Department of Justice in the U.S. has cleared our pending acquisition of Lipman with no conditions.\n\nId like to take this opportunity to update you on where we stand. The remaining key steps prior to closing will be the Lipman and VeriFone shareholder meetings, which have been scheduled, respectively, for September 14 and 15.\n\nIsraeli law requires a 30-day waiting period after the conclusion of the Lipman shareholder meeting. So, therefore, the earliest we could close is October 14. For a number of practical reasons, we expect to complete the acquisition on November 1 to coincide with the start of our new fiscal year 2007.\n\nA few days ago, I sent out a note about the integration program we have developed to ensure we are ready for business on Day One of the merged company. Our Day One planning is proceeding along all three key tracks - - sales and marketing, supply chain, and administration.\n\nWith our successful integrations of GO Software and Trintechs Payment Systems Business, we have demonstrated our ability to acquire companies without missing a beat. I am fully confident in the abilities of our teams to meet the goals we have set out to ensure that the two companies will be 100% ready to conduct business as one on all fronts come November 1.\n\nThe industrial logic behind this acquisition remains as compelling as it was when we announced it. VeriFone and Lipman are the fastest growing and most profitable providers of point of sale electronic payment technologies, and geographically, the two companies are fully complementary. There has been minimal adverse impact on our businesses since the initial announcement. We believe the fact that most of our business has been unaffected by the initial announcement reflects the complementary nature of the markets that we serve.\n\nFrom November 1, the new VeriFone will represent tremendous geographical and product diversification that no other company in our industry can match. This will create\n\ngreat opportunities for our employees as a whole as we continue to provide increased value to our customers.\n\nI hope you remain excited by what this acquisition represents and are each working to do your best to ensure we meet our goals for integrating Lipman into our organization.\n\nDoug\n\nNOTE: In connection with the proposed transaction, VeriFone has filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-134928), including a proxy statement of VeriFone, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Investors and securityholders are urged to read the registration statement, including the proxy statement (and all amendments and supplements to it) and other materials that VeriFone may file with the SEC when they become available, because they contain important information.

Information regarding VeriFones directors and executive officers is available in VeriFones 2005 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on December 20, 2005 and VeriFones preliminary proxy statement for its 2006 annual meeting of stockholders, filed with the SEC on February 17, 2006, and information regarding Lipmans directors and executive officers is available in Lipmans 2005 Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on March 9, 2006. Additional information regarding the interests of such potential participants is included in the registration statement and proxy statement, and the other relevant documents filed with the SEC when they become available.\n\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nWe have included or incorporated by reference in this document financial estimates and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
