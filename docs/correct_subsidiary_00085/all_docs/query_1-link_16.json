        "text": "9th Cir.\n\n11-15860\n\nThe court of appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a district court judgment. The court held that when a class action plaintiff’s allegations of securities fraud were viewed holistically, the plaintiff adequately alleged securities fraud violations against a company and its top-ranking executive officers who were alleged to have manipulated financial reports with intentional fraud or deliberate recklessness.\n\nLead plaintiff National Elevator Industry Pension Fund brought a securities fraud class action against VeriFone Holdings, Inc., Douglas Bergeron, and Barry Zwarenstein. Bergeron was VeriFone’s Chief Executive Officer and former Board of Directors Chairman. Zwarenstein was VeriFone’s former Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President. National Elevator brought the action on behalf of investors who bought VeriFone shares between August 31, 2006 and April 1, 2008.\n\nAccording to National Elevator, in 2006 VeriFone bought Lipman Electronic Engineering Ltd. and began merging the companies. VeriFone said the merger was likely to improve its financial condition, increasing its gross margins from 41-44 percent to 42-47 percent. This, despite the fact that VeriFone’s recent gross margins had never exceeded 45.6 percent and Lipman’s had just dropped to under 42 percent after years of declines.\n\nNational Elevator’s complaint asserted that in the first three quarters of 2007, VeriFone reported gross margins of from 47-48 percent. The reports were false and were contradicted by the company’s internal financial reports, which reflected gross margins well short of the company’s projections. Bergeron and Zwarenstein provided accounting “adjustments” to the company’s supply chain controller that had no basis other than a desire to meet market expectations.\n\nThree consecutive times, according to National Elevator, Bergeron and Zwarenstein supervised accounting staff as they made baseless multimillion-dollar adjustments that brought reported results in line with expectations. Each time, the CEO and CFO accepted the adjustments without question, representing publicly that a recent merger was driving the company’s success even as the adjustments grew in size and negatively impacted key metrics.\n\nThe accounting irregularities came to light after an outside audit. In December 2007, VeriFone issued a restatement of its consolidated financial statements for the first three quarters of the year, resulting in substantial reductions in reported net revenue, with attendant drops in gross margins. VeriFone’s shares dropped in value precipitously.\n\nNational Elevator’s ensuing complaint asserted violations of §§10(b), 20(a), and 20A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10-b in connection with the restatement of financial results. The complaint relied on a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint that charged VeriFone and Periolat with books and records violations.\n\nThe district court dismissed National Elevator’s complaint for failure to sufficiently allege scienter as to each of the defendants.\n\nThe court of appeals reversed in part, holding that National Elevator adequately pleaded securities violations as against VeriFone, Bergeron, and Zwarenstein.\n\nThe court of appeals noted that the falsity of the financial reports was undisputed, so that the only issue on appeal was whether National Elevator’s allegations were sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter as required under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.\n\nThe court acknowledged that, viewed in isolation, any particular allegation set out by National Elevator might not compel an inference of scienter. When the allegations were considered holistically, however, as directed in Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, 131 S. Ct. 1309 (2011), the inference that Bergeron, Zwarenstein, and VeriFone were deliberately reckless as to the truth of their financial reports and related public statements was “at least as compelling as any opposing inference.”\n\nThe court distinguished its pre-Matrixx “dual inquiry” approach to determining the presence of scienter from its post-Matrixx cases, which employed a variety of approaches to address the same question. This did not run afoul of Matrixx because the Court in that case did not mandate a particular approach, so long as the whole picture was retained, and the analysis did not proceed on a piecemeal basis that unduly focused on the weakness of individual allegations.\n\nHere, the district court erred by unduly discounting National Elevator’s claims and concluding that no inference of deliberate recklessness was warranted.\n\nNational Elevator’s complaint alleged a series of repeated accounting manipulations in which Bergeron and Zwarenstein attempted to “remedy” VeriFone’s “unacceptable” results for the first three quarters of 2007. The men made specific adjustments, providing accounting staff with dollar amounts and changes intended to bring corporate results in line with projections. The men monitored the effects of the changes on earnings and margins, with a sole focus on accounting results rather than the substantive performance of the company’s operations.\n\nIn short, the men made false adjustments to the company’s financial and performance records with overt “winks” to proper accounting, and with a blind eye toward the real substance of the company’s operations.\n\nThe court cautioned that it could be the case that, as the district court concluded, the complaint did not establish or create a strong inference that anyone at VeriFone, including Periolat, actually knew that the manual accounting adjustments were improper. However, that was not the only permissible inference. Recklessly turning a “blind eye” to impropriety is equally culpable conduct under Rule 10b-5.\n\nThe court admonished that National Elevator’s allegations, viewed holistically, gave rise to a strong inference that Bergeron, Zwarenstein and VeriFone were deliberately reckless to the truth or falsity of their statements regarding VeriFone’s financial results, particularly gross margin percentages. This inference was cogent and equally as compelling as the competing inference that VeriFone “was simply overwhelmed with integrating a large new division into its existing business.” The logical inference was that VeriFone’s priority was meeting projections even at the expense of accuracy.\n\nGiven the sufficiency of National Elevator’s detailed allegations, the district court erred in dismissing the complaint’s §10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims. The court’s reversal of that dismissal also required reversal of the district court’s dismissal of the §20A claims.\n\nDismissal of National Elevator’s §20(a) control person claims was appropriate, however, becuase there was no underlying claim against the “controlled” person, namely Periolat. Absent a securities violation by Periolat, National Elevator could not sustain its §20(a) control person liability claims."
