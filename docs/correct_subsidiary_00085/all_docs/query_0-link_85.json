        "text": "The Risks and Challenges of the US Banking System Revealed\n\nRecently, cracks in the US financial system have been exposed, with thousands of small and medium-sized banks facing risks. Initially, a small crisis at a local bank in California was reported, but within days, it pushed the world's largest central banks to cooperate and provide liquidity to the financial system. The move came after the Swiss Central Bank provided a safety net of $110 billion to prevent the collapse of Credit Suisse, which could have led to a major upheaval in the global financial markets.\n\nTo tackle the crisis, the Fed introduced a new program to help banks called the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), which guaranteed all banks and financial institutions in the United States the possibility to receive loans from the Fed against approved assets. The loans were given for a period of one year and with an interest rate of about 4.2%. The program was immediately in demand, and in just two weeks, the Fed's balance sheet increased by $391 billion, erasing all the reductions made since October 2022.\n\nThe capital and collateral crisis of the banks, initially perceived as a small, local issue, is spreading. According to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), all US banks together have unrealized losses of about $620 billion on bonds, and the American banking system has a deficit of $2.2 trillion on the value of its assets, compared to the value recorded in the books, according to researchers from Columbia University.\n\nThe risks are significant, as even if only half of the depositors not insured by the FDIC, who hold about $9 trillion, were to withdraw their money, 190 banks would have collapsed. If 100% of the uninsured deposits were withdrawn, more than 1,600 banks would collapse, including very large banks.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2008 revealed the fragility of the US banking system, and the current situation suggests that more work is needed to ensure its stability. While the central banks have taken measures to address the crisis, the risks and challenges faced by the US banking system are significant and should not be underestimated.\n\nBy Martijn Peters\n\nPresident of Globalscope,\n\nFounder of DEX international M&A\n\nCross-border M&A fell to $1.57 trillion worldwide in 2022, down from an all-time high of $1.7 trillion in 2021, according to Pitchbook, a financial database. The number of international deals actually dropped to 9156, a total decline of 11%.\n\nBut from a broader perspective, it’s not particularly bad news. As a comparative trend, cross-border M&A transactions are still higher than they have been historically, in spite of the more recent—and potentially temporary—slowdown.\n\nCurrent economic and political challenges have created a combination of factors that have fueled uncertainty, caution, and a bit of a “wait until the storm passes” attitude in the minds of buyers, sellers, and financial lenders worldwide.\n\nThree trends particularly stand out:\n\n1. Steadily increasing interest rates, combined with decreased availability of debt in certain regions, had an overall tempering effect on dealmaking last year, and to some extent, it still does in 2023.\n\n2. Geopolitical events, most significantly the war in Ukraine, took a measurable toll on international transactions—and confidence.\n\n3. Concerns about the impact of inflation worldwide add even more fear and hesitancy when it comes to cross-border M&A decisions.\n\nDespite the recent slowdown, long-term trends in cross-border M&A are clearly upward\n\nLong-term growth in cross-border M&A is driven by two major buyer groups: 1. Large corporations who continue to expand their businesses into foreign territories and find that M&A is a faster and more certain way to gain access to new markets, rather than going “greenfield”. 2. Private equity firms also increasingly deploy international buy-and-build strategies to accelerate the value creation process, especially after having acquired a first-platform company in a given industry. PE firms have learned that breaking into new markets and turning a national leader into an international player has a directly positive effect on valuation levels when selling the company.\n\nNew Challenges, New Opportunities\n\nThis is not to say, however, that everything is rosy in the international M&A arena, nor is it by any means simple. International mergers and acquisitions are driven by various factors, like reducing competition, penetrating new markets, diversifying product lines or services, and gaining rights to intellectual property such as patents, trademarks, and copyrights. As a result, international M&A often follows trade. Most cross-border transactions take place between countries that do a lot of business with each other. And from a mid-market perspective, I estimate roughly 1/3 of M&A transactions are cross-border in the sense that the buyer and seller come from different countries. This number is typically higher in smaller countries like The Netherlands that are more accustomed to working internationally than their larger counterparts, such as the United States. Manufacturing, consumer, and professional services have historically been sectors with high volumes of cross-border M&A, but during the last decade, technology, media, and telecom (TMT) have shown the largest increase in the number of deals and value. The bottom line is that cross-border M&A adds further challenges to the already complex process that characterizes dealmaking. Cross-border transactions bring additional risk and complexity due to differences in cultural, political, economic environment, law, tax rules, and accounting, not to mention disparities in corporate culture itself. But there is another bottom line to also consider. International M&A can offer a level of financial rewards and business growth that cannot be achieved by regional or national deals alone. More and more, M&A opportunities for mid-market companies are becoming increasingly international. Cross-border M&A growth is good news for mid-market buyers and sellers who are looking for more strategic deals, increased market share, and worldwide expansion and growth. # # # Martijn Peters is Founder and Managing Director of DEX international M&A, a Netherlands-based company specializing in structuring and managing M&A transactions. He has broad experience as an international deal maker and currently serves as President of Globalscope Partners.\n\nParamax Advised on the Sale of Thermopatch Corporation to Avery Dennison\n\nThermopatch Corporation (“Thermopatch”) (www.thermopatch.com) is a global leader specializing in labeling, embellishments, and transfers for textiles\n\nprimarily to the industrial laundry, workwear, hospitality, and sports markets.
