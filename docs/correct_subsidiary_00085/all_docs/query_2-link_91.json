        "text": "VeriFone Systems had outstanding results this year, reflected by its share price soaring 150%. But Dan Soffer, vice president for marketing, development, mergers and acquisitions for Europe and Asia, insists that the real revolution will come in 2011 from the company's dominant position in the innovative field of paying by cell phone. The idea is that the cell phone will turn into a cell wallet which consumers can use to make their store purchases instead of presenting a credit card.\n\nThe technology, Near Field Communication (NFC ), which allows payment without any physical contact with the cash register or its interface, involves a dedicated chip inside the cell phone interacting with a compatible device installed at the retailer's point of sale. VeriFone's device includes a touch-screen for signing the bill.\n\nNFC isn't common yet in Israel though it is supported by major credit cards, including MasterCard and Visa. Currently in testing stages in many locations, it has already seen commercial use in Japan, Korea and Malaysia. Purchases can even be made by holding a cell phone up close to special marketing posters, according to Soffer.\n\n\"In 2009, more than 81 million purchases were made using a cell phone, mostly in Asia and Europe,\" says Soffer. \"And more than 110 million registered users will make payments through their cell phone by the end of 2010, according to projections. Based on experience from China, acceptance of this application takes only a few months.\"\n\nNFC is expected to change the rules of the game in purchasing methods, and VeriFone is in an excellent position to make a killing in this market.\n\nSoffer, 36, is responsible for identifying and purchasing software companies synergetic with the company's main business. VeriFone, which expanded into Israel in 2006 with its purchase of competitor Lipman Electronic Engineering, provides retailers with secure electronic payment systems. The company is considered the world's leader in the development and sales of credit card and smartcard reading devices and equipment.\n\nWith its largest branch located in the industrial park of Rosh Ha'ayin, VeriFone employs 400 staff in Israel, with 2,400 employees worldwide. Its distribution network includes banks and direct retailers, providing them with added value services for payment clearance. The company outsourced all production activities to China in 2006.\n\nVeriFone is listed on the New York Stock Exchange at a current valuation of $3.44 billion. Previously dual-listed, it was taken off the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange earlier this year for technical and cost-saving reasons.\n\nDespite its impressive 150% gain this year, VeriFone's share price, beginning the week at around $40, is well below its peak. It reached $48 near the end of 2007 before diving 50% in one day due to an accounting error found in its financial statements. The economic crisis further impacted the shares, which fell at one point to a mere $3.50.\n\n\"Revolutionary model\"\n\nOver the last year VeriFone bought up five companies in the field of electronic payments and related activities. Last month, it announced the acquisition of its European competitor Hypercom for $485 million, transforming VeriFone into the world's largest electronic payment company.\n\nNFC is already embedded in a range of VeriFone products in Australia, the United States, Poland, the United Kingdom and Mexico, but just at the pilot stage for now.\n\nAsked why NFC isn't already in use in Israel, Soffer replies: \"One reason is the chicken and the egg effect. The cell phone and credit card companies don't want to get involved before retailers invest in payment infrastructure and system integration, while retailers aren't prepared to independently install infrastructure before seeing significant demand.\"\n\nThe second reason, according to Soffer, is that most cell phones don't support NFC. Just one Nokia device integrates NFC, but the company announced that starting next year all its phones will support the new technology. VeriFone's technology also allows for support via SIM cards, without the need to build the capability into the phone.\n\n\"Security is the name of the game. Cell phones are considered as not being secure, and credit card companies must conform to the most rigorous security standards. Using VeriFone's encryption technology in the cell phone solves the problem,\" says Soffer."
