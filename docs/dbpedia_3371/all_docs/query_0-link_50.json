        "text": "Lewis Grimm has over two decades of leveraged finance experience working on marquee deals in New York, Europe, and Australia. He represents financial institutions, direct and institutional lenders, and corporate borrowers on cutting-edge domestic and cross-border leveraged and investment-grade lending and high yield transactions as well as high-profile restructuring and bankruptcy matters.\n\nHis financial institution clients include Citizens, Jefferies, KeyBank, M&T Bank, TD Securities, U.S. Bank, and Wells Fargo. Corporate borrowers include Century Aluminum, Cumulus Media, FTI Consulting, Kern River Holdings, Outfront Media, Texas Instruments, and TransDigm.\n\nLewis's high-profile deals include assisting the majority term loan lenders in the restructuring of the U.S. facility agreement of Atlas Iron through an Australian creditors' scheme of arrangement. This was a great example of how a company can successfully restructure when all parties work together. It was awarded Insolvency & Restructuring Deal of the Year at the 2016 Australasian Law Awards and Restructuring Deal of the Year at the 2016 Turnaround Management Association Awards.\n\nHe also represented the majority secured term loan lenders in the chapter 11 cases of Southcross Holdings and its affiliated debtors. This plan received approval within 15 days of filing, making it the fastest ever chapter 11 reorganization for a debtor having at least $500 million in liabilities.\n\nLewis was recognized by New York Metro Super Lawyers as a \"Rising Star\" for four consecutive years, designated by M&A Advisor as one of 40 leading lawyers under the age of 40, and named by The Legal 500 US as a \"Next Generation Lawyer.\""
