        "text": "In 1861, at age 15, James H. Wolff volunteered to serve in the U.S. Navy for the Union during the Civil War. He was admitted to the Massachusetts bar in 1875 after a year at Harvard Law School. He was appointed by Governor John D. Long as a clerk in the Adjutant General’s Office, and he served until 1883. He co-founded Walker, Wolff & Brown, which was the first comprehensive black law firm in Massachusetts. He was active in the late 19th-century struggle for civil rights in Massachusetts. In 1901, Wolff was appointed judge advocate general in the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.), a racially integrated organization of honorably discharged Civil War veterans.\n\nWhile a student at Harvard Law School in the 1890s, William H. Lewis was refused a haircut by a white barber in Cambridge (see Litigants and Landmark Cases exhibit). He and Butler Wilson, Esq., persuaded the Massachusetts legislature to broaden the state’s anti-discrimination statute to include barbershops and other places of public accommodation.\n\nWhen a law student, Lewis became the first African American to be named to the Walter Camp All-American Football Team in 1892. He was named to the team again in 1893.\n\nIn 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt named Lewis to be the first black Assistant United States Attorney. In 1911, he was appointed by President William H. Taft as the first African American assistant attorney general in the United States Justice Department, the highest office in the executive branch of government offered to any black man. He later returned to Massachusetts and entered the private practice of law, representing clients from every walk of life. He was an outstanding lawyer with extensive trial experience in Massachusetts courts, as well as appearances before the Supreme Court of the United States. Although President Taft recommended him for the Massachusetts Superior Court in 1913, Massachusetts Governor Eugene N. Foss never appointed him to the position.\n\nA graduate of Wayne State University Law School, Wayne A. Budd has been engaged in the private practice of law in a variety of settings. He also served in the public sector as United States Attorney for Massachusetts and associate attorney general of the United States in the George H.W. Bush Administration. He was senior executive vice president and general counsel of John Hancock Financial Services. In 1979, Budd became the first African American president of the Massachusetts Bar Association, and at that time, he was the youngest president of any state bar association. He is currently Senior Counsel at the law firm Goodwin Procter.\n\nThe son of a New York City police officer, Ralph C. Martin, II, began his legal career in 1983 as a prosecutor in the office of the district attorney of Middlesex County after graduating from Boston College Law School. In 1985, he became an assistant United States attorney. In 1992, Governor William Weld appointed him to complete the unexpired term of district attorney of Suffolk County, thereby becoming the first African American to hold that position. Voters retained him in this position following a general election in 1994 and 1998. Martin then became the managing partner of the Boston office of the law firm Bingham McCutchen. He held that position until 2011, when he became Senior Vice President and General Counsel at Northeastern University.\n\nA graduate of Harvard Law School, Thomas I. Atkins was associate trial counsel for the plaintiffs in Morgan v. Hennigan, 379 F. Supp. 410 (D. Mass. 1974), the Boston school desegregation case. He was named interim president of the Boston branch of the NAACP in 1974 and then elected to serve as president for a two-year term. On October 26, 1971, Atkins was appointed Secretary of Communities and Development under Governor Francis Sargent, becoming the first African American to serve as a state Cabinet Secretary. In 1967, he became the first African American elected to the Boston City Council in the 20th century. Atkins died in 2008.\n\nEdward W. Brooke graduated Boston University School of Law in 1948, where he was a member of the law review. When he was unable to find employment with a major law firm, he began his career, like many black lawyers, as a single practitioner in Roxbury. In 1962, he was elected Attorney General of Massachusetts, becoming the first African American to hold the office in the United States. In 1966, he was elected to the United States Senate from Massachusetts, becoming the first African American elected to that body since Reconstruction. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009.\n\nMore\n\nGeraldine S. Hines began her legal career in 1971 as a staff attorney with the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute after graduating from University of Wisconsin Law School. She served as a public defender with the Roxbury Defenders Committee from 1973–1977. In 1982, she entered private practice. She has been an adjunct professor of law at Northeastern Law School since 1980. She served on the Judicial Nominating Commission and the steering committee of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. She was appointed as the first African American woman to serve on the Supreme Judicial Court in 2014 by Governor Deval Patrick.\n\nMore\n\nA graduate of Boston College Law School, Marie P. St. Fleur began her legal career in 1987 in the Office of the District Attorney of Middlesex County. In 1991, she was appointed assistant attorney general in the Trial Division of the Office of the Attorney General, where she rose to become chief of the Unemployment Fraud Division. In 1999, she was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives from the Fifth Suffolk District. She is the first Haitian American ever to hold state elected office in Massachusetts and in the United States. In 2010, she was appointed Chief of Advocacy and Strategic Investment for the City of Boston. In 2013, she continued her career in public service when she joined the Bessie Tartt Wilson Initiative for Children, a non-profit research and advocacy organization."
