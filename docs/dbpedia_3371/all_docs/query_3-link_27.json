        "text": "NAARDEN, The Netherlands and MIAMI, Jan. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NewAmsterdam Pharma Company N.V. (Nasdaq: NAMS or “NewAmsterdam” or the “Company”), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing oral, non-statin medicines for patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease with residual elevation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (“LDL-C”), for whom existing therapies are not sufficiently effective or well-tolerated, today announced the appointment of William H. Lewis, J.D., M.B.A., as Chair of its Board of Directors. Mr. Lewis has served as Chief Executive Officer of Insmed Incorporated, a global commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company, since 2012, and as Chair of Insmed’s Board of Directors since 2018. Mr. Lewis succeeds Sander Slootweg, Managing Partner at Forbion, who has served as Chairman of NewAmsterdam’s Board of Directors since inception.\n\n“Will is a leader in the biotechnology industry, widely recognized for his commitment to putting patients first, championing those who are underserved by existing treatment options, and translating breakthrough science into first-in-disease medicines,” said Michael Davidson, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of NewAmsterdam. “I have long admired Will for his deep knowledge of the clinical and regulatory landscape, as well as his proven ability to advance new therapies for serious and rare diseases. He will be a tremendous partner, who I have known for many years, and as Chair of our Board I look forward to his contributions as we advance our CETP inhibitor toward market and work to deliver a simple, oral, once-daily option to millions of people living with dyslipidemia. I would also like to thank Sander for his support and contribution as our Chairman over the last several years. His guidance has been invaluable in getting NewAmsterdam to where we are today.”\n\n“Over the past several years, I have had the unique privilege of partnering with Will as both an investor and colleague. He is a remarkable leader, with experience advancing novel molecules through late-stage development, launching into sizeable markets and establishing new standards-of-care,” commented Mr. Slootweg. “I am confident he is the right partner to support NewAmsterdam as it enters its next phase of growth, with multiple pivotal data readouts expected in 2024 and, if approved, its plans to commercialize obicetrapib.”\n\nMr. Lewis has more than 30 years of executive experience in the pharmaceutical and finance industries both in the U.S. and internationally. Prior to joining Insmed in 2012, Mr. Lewis served as Co-Founder, President, and Chief Financial Officer of Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by Amryt in 2019. Prior to Aegerion, he spent more than 10 years working in investment banking in the U.S. and Europe. He also previously worked for the U.S. government. Mr. Lewis holds a J.D. with Honors and an M.B.A., both from Case Western Reserve University, and a B.A., cum laude, from Oberlin College. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of Case Western Reserve University and of BioNJ, the life sciences association for New Jersey.\n\n“NewAmsterdam was founded in hopes of delivering a new option to high-risk cardiovascular disease patients, many of whom fail to achieve their risk-based LDL-C goals despite treatment with statin therapy,” said Mr. Lewis. “Based on data generated from its five Phase 2 trials to date, it is clear that obicetrapib is designed to be a powerful therapy, with the potential to safely and effectively improve LDL-C, as well as other key markers of cardiovascular disease risk. I am excited to join NewAmsterdam’s Board of Directors and look forward to partnering closely with management to complete the ongoing Phase 3 program and bring obicetrapib forward.”\n\nAbout Obicetrapib\n\nObicetrapib is a novel, oral, low-dose CETP inhibitor that NewAmsterdam is developing to overcome the limitations of current LDL-lowering treatments. The Company believes that obicetrapib has the potential to be a once-daily oral CETP inhibitor for lowering LDL-C, if approved. In the Company’s Phase 2b ROSE trial, obicetrapib demonstrated a 51% lowering of LDL-C from baseline at a 10 mg dose level on top of high-intensity statins and, in the Company’s Phase 2 ROSE2 trial, the combination of a 10 mg dose of obicetrapib and a 10 mg dose of ezetimibe demonstrated a 63% lowering of LDL-C from baseline. In all five of the Company’s Phase 2 trials, ROSE2, TULIP, ROSE, OCEAN, and TA-8995-203, evaluating obicetrapib as monotherapy or combination therapy, the Company observed statistically significant LDL-lowering combined with a side effect profile similar to that of placebo, including no increase in blood pressure or muscle related side effects. Obicetrapib has demonstrated strong tolerability in more than 800 patients with elevated lipid levels (“dyslipidemia”) in NewAmsterdam’s clinical trials to date. The Company is conducting two Phase 3 pivotal trials, BROADWAY and BROOKLYN, to evaluate obicetrapib as a monotherapy used as an adjunct to maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapies to provide additional LDL-lowering for high-risk cardiovascular disease (“CVD”) patients. The Company began enrolling patients in BROADWAY in January 2022 and in BROOKLYN in July 2022 and completed enrollment of BROOKLYN in April 2023 and BROADWAY in July 2023. The Company also commenced the Phase 3 PREVAIL cardiovascular outcomes trial in March 2022, which is designed to assess the potential of obicetrapib to reduce occurrences of major adverse cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and non-elective coronary revascularization.\n\nAbout NewAmsterdam\n\nBased in the Netherlands, NewAmsterdam (Nasdaq: NAMS) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company whose mission is to improve patient care in populations with metabolic diseases where currently approved therapies have not been sufficiently adequate or well tolerated. We seek to fill a significant unmet need for a safe, cost-effective and convenient LDL-lowering therapy as an adjunct to statins, a class of lipid-lowering medications that are the current standard of care for high-risk CVD patients with high cholesterol. NewAmsterdam is investigating obicetrapib, an oral, low-dose and once-daily CETP inhibitor, as the preferred LDL-C lowering therapy to be used as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy for high-risk cardiovascular disease patients.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements included in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
