        "text": "Residents Reminded to Prepare for Flood After Fire\n\nPublished on July 31, 2024\n\nHelena, MT – With the Horse Gulch Fire at 100 percent containment, Lewis and Clark County Floodplain Program in partnership with Lewis and Clark County Emergency Management would like to remind residents in and around the burn scar to remain vigilant. Flood-after-fire debris flows and mudslides can impact residents for several years after the fire is out.\n\nLewis and Clark County Enters Stage 1 Fire Restrictions\n\nPublished on July 30, 2024\n\nHelena, MT – With fire danger rising and to reduce the risk of human-caused fires, the Lewis and Clark County Board of Commissioners passed a resolution today to establish Stage 1 Fire Restrictions throughout the county.\n\nCountry Club Avenue Pavement Improvements Begin July 8, 2024\n\nPublished on June 27, 2024\n\nHelena, MT – Lewis and Clark County Public Works and Helena Sand and Gravel will conduct a pavement improvement project on a 1.4-mile section of Country Club Avenue in Helena from July 8 through July 19, 2024.\n\nSeasonal weight limit restrictions in effect for certain County roads\n\nPublished on March 07, 2024\n\nHelena, MT – Temporary weight limit restrictions will go into effect on certain County roads beginning Monday, March 11, 2024, to prevent damage during spring thaw. As the ground thaws, base gravel in the roadbed becomes saturated, causing surface break up and premature failure. In these conditions, fully loaded vehicles can cause severe road damage."
