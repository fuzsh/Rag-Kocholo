        "text": "Chris Lewis is everything you need in a trial lawyer…\n\nIntelligent, knowledgeable, experienced, energetic, strategic, and fearless. And, he has surrounded himself with a staff who complement his competency and intensity. He is truly gifted in simplifying the complex – without diluting the details necessary for effective communication to the jury. His cross examination skills are precise in exposing the weaknesses of opposing witnesses and counsel. His engaging personality and presentation capture and hold the attention of everyone in the courtroom. My family and I are truly grateful to have had Chris and his team as advocates and counsel – they are incredible!\n\nFORMER CLIENT\n\nAn attorney you can trust\n\nI cannot say enough great things about Chris and his firm. Unfortunately, I found myself in an awkward position with the law and needed the professional help and skill of Chris Lewis. He met with me to get the details and then quickly went to work on my case. While I was in an embarrassing situation, Chris was very professional and courteous, and put me at ease. At the conclusion of the ordeal, my case was dismissed and I was able to move on without the possible shadow on my record and career. I am grateful for professionalism and sincerity Chris gave me and to my case. If you’re in need of a lawyer, Chris Lewis is the one to call on.\n\nFORMER CLIENT\n\nHero of Lawyers\n\nChris is intelligent, incredibly hard-working, zealous, and, sometimes, downright scary. He commands the respect of all of his peers (defense attorneys and prosecutors alike) and of the judges. Whenever my husband saw Chris at court, my husband would light up and feel encouraged because he “felt safe.” He knew Chris would protect him and had his best interest in mind. If you want to be impressed and to witness the definition of a top advocate, you must watch Chris perform in the courtroom.\n\nA.D.\n\nThe Real Deal.\n\nSeveral years ago I was arrested for DWI. I began by hiring probably the most expensive DWI lawyer in my city, and was soon disheartened by how his office treated me. I quit the first attorney and hired Chris Lewis, and that decision ultimately saved me. From the outset, Chris had a strategy for my case that was insightful and practical. He evidently had the respect of judges and others in the courthouse, because his arguments convinced the judge to suppress nearly all of the evidence against me. The prosecutor finally dismissed the charges.\n\nMr. Lewis could have done what so many mediocre lawyers do (the minimum), but instead he went to bat for me in a big way, and won my case. I am forever grateful. He is a shining example for others in his field; simply the best.\n\nFORMER CLIENT"
