        "text": "CAYUGA COUNTY, N.Y. -- A Central New York man was sentenced to more than 50 years in prison after he was found guilty last month of sex crimes against three young girls, according to the Cayuga County district attorney's office.\n\nWilliam H. Lewis, 30, of 2560 East Mechanic St., Cato, was found guilty of two counts of predatory sexual assault against a child, a felony; first-degree sexual abuse, a felony; and three counts of endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor, after a five-day trial in October.\n\nThe Cayuga County Sheriff's Office began investigating Lewis after they were notified that he had been having sexual contact with multiple young girls since 2014. He was arrested in March 2017.\n\nThe three girls, who were ages 6, 8 and 10 when the abuse began, testified during the trial saying Lewis molested them and sexually assaulted them for years, District Attorney Jon Budelmann said.\n\nLewis originally admitted to the abuse in a taped interview with police, but later backtracked over the course of the investigation and trial, Budelmann said.\n\n\"Having the defendant try to blame these three young victims for his own despicable acts is plain evil,\" Budelmann said. \"This defendant demonstrated no concern for these children and displayed absolutely no empathy, either during the trial or at sentencing.\"\n\nLewis was sentenced to 57 years to life in prison, Budelmann announced Thursday. Budelmann said the conviction should send a message that those that abuse children will be held accountable."
