I wanted to model myself after him.”\n\nLemon spent some 35 years researching Ridley and the case of Alexander McClay Williams, and he still lives in Ridley’s Olive Street home.\n\n“His parents arrived in Media during the Civil War as runaway slaves,” Lemon said, noting that of the 4 million people in bondage in 1860, only 1% successfully escaped.\n\nAfter being housed by Quakers from the Providence Friends Meeting, the family eventually moved into the Minshall House at Front Street and Providence Road. There, Ridley was born in 1867.\n\n“He was sickly as a child,” Lemon said. “It affected his vision so he wore glasses the rest of his life.”\n\nRidley graduated with honors from Media Public High School in 1887.\n\n“Beginning that year, he read law,” Lemon said. “That was the more common practice as opposed to attending law school. He read law in the office of Louis H. Richards … He became the first member of color of the Delaware County Bar in 1891.”\n\nLemon noted that the next Black member of the bar association was a Wilmington, Del., man named Byrd in the 1940’s, who was followed by the next, Richard A. Wright Sr., in 1960.\n\nLemon said Wright recalled Ridley: “Whenever he came to the house, Mr. Ridley would be in the living room with a law book in his hand and a jacket and tie.”\n\nRecalling his ancestor’s patriotism, Lemon noted that Ridley enlisted in the Army during the Spanish American War but the war ended before he was sent to Cuba. So, he pushed his age back so that he served during World War I.\n\nMcClay Williams matter\n\n“Ridley had a remarkable law practice that spanned 54 years,” Lemon said, adding that it was stories in his grandmother’s house of the Alexander McClay Williams case that led him to spend more than three decades investigating it.\n\nWilliams, who was Black, was sentenced to death by Delaware County Court of Common Pleas Judge W. Roger Fronefield after being convicted by an all-white jury with the assault and murder of 34-year-old white woman Vida Robare at the Glen Mills School for Boys on Oct. 3, 1930.\n\nOn June 8, 1931, he was executed.\n\nIn June 2022, Court of Common Pleas Judge Kevin F. Kelly granted a motion for a new trial for Williams, then promptly ordered a motion to withdraw all charges against him.\n\nAttorney Robert Keller worked with Lemon and the Williams family in that matter.\n\n“It’s just ungodly what happened here,” he said. “Ridley was asked to be the attorney for this boy because he was the only African American lawyer in our county. He was given $10 in costs, a $200 fee for this capital murder case, given 60 days to prepare for a murder case.”\n\nHe noted the scales of justice were not in favor of Williams or Ridley.\n\n“Ridley there was by himself trying to defend this little boy,” Keller said. “His hands were tied behind his back. He didn’t have a chance. The trial lasted about eight hours. Within 60 days of the arrest, the boy had been forced to give confessions and was convicted of first-degree murder and then put to death within six months of the trial.”\n\nKeller called the effort the highlight of his career.\n\nThere were other stories about Ridley and his courage.\n\n“He faced a group of KKK klansmen who showed up in his backyard carrying torches and wearing hoods one evening,” Lemon said. “They were searching for somebody that they mistakenly thought was in the house, but he stood up to them.”\n\nLemon said he thanks Ridley every day for being his ancestor.\n\nThe attorney passed away in 1945.\n\n‘Legacy is important’\n\nDelaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer, who also lobbied to have Williams’ name cleared, called Ridley a trailblazer.\n\n“His life was hard,” he said. “His practice was hard. He was given an impossible case to set him up for failure.”\n\nStollsteimer praised Kelly and led a round of applause for his actions involving Williams.\n\n“It was Judge Kelly who gave us the grounds to overturn this conviction and it was his decision to vacate that sentence and only he could do that,” the district attorney said. “That speaks volumes of him as a human being. It also speaks volumes of the people we have on our bench in Delaware County.”\n\nThe district attorney noted Ridley’s inspiration: “A lot of us wouldn’t be lawyers if it wasn’t for people like William Ridley.”\n\nLatoison said a lesson he has garnered from his great-great-grandfather is preserving the past.\n\n“Legacy is important and legacy matters,” he said.\n\nHe shared how he grew up in Chester, graduated from Chester High School and planned to get a job at Red Lobster instead of going to college. Even as time passed, he always knew his relation to Ridley.\n\n“I was pretty damn proud of it,” he said. “It just kind of kept me with some direction.”\n\nYears later, Latoison, inspired in part by his family relation, graduated law school at the age of 30.\n\n“A legacy is important,” he said from the steps of his law firm, where the Ridley plaque now stands. “You never know what inspiration that is which will help somebody like myself who was lost to get to that next level.”\n\nOriginally Published: September 19, 2023 at 6:21 p.m."
