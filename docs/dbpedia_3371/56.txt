Biography Overview

William B. Lewis is the Managing Partner of the firm’s Southeast Florida offices.

William is an experienced trial attorney with an established track record of significant recoveries. He has won jury trials, bench trials, and arbitrations in venues throughout Florida.

William’s trial experience has earned him membership into the American Board of Trial Advocates (“ABOTA”) – a invitation-only group of experienced trial lawyers and judges dedicated to the preservation of the right to civil jury trials.

William litigates cases on a contingency-fee basis, which allows his clients to level the playing field against larger, wealthier, or insured opponents. He is driven by the philosophy that justice requires cases to be decided on the merits – not by the size of a corporation’s or insurance company’s legal budget.

While in law school, William interned at the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the State Attorney’s Office, where he prosecuted multiple successful jury trials.
