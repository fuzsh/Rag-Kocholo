Gaming computer specialist Alienware has announced that it is now accepting bitcoin payments.

The company, a subsidiary of Dell, Inc., announced the move on its official Twitter account today. In addition to the bitcoin integration, Alienware is offering a promotional discount worth up to $150 on orders purchased with bitcoin.

The decision by Alienware to take digital currency represents yet another high-profile bitcoin integration by a technology company. Alienware specializes in high-performance gaming hardware, including desktops and laptops. Originally founded in 1996, Dell later purchased Alienware in 2006.

Despite the ownership, Alienware functions with relative autonomy and focuses on a more narrow market segment.

Owing to its owner-company’s adoption of bitcoin, it makes sense that the popular gaming computer maker would tap the digital currency for payments of its own.

As the company said on Twitter:

Bitcoin's merchant ranks swell

As with Dell, California-based bitcoin payments company Coinbase acts as Alienware's processing partner.

Earlier this month, Dell became the largest company to date to accept digital currency payments. Like Alienware, Dell is aiming to give its new integration a boost with a 10% discount on bitcoin payments.

At the time, Dell told CoinDesk that bitcoin integration is part of the company’s commitment to responding to consumer demands. Dell sees digital currency adoption as a means of providing additional avenues to do so, saying:

“The first thing to provide a payment method for our business and bitcoin is a great example of how we can show some innovation. We’re always going to be looking for new, innovative ways to ensure we’re driving the right experience.”
