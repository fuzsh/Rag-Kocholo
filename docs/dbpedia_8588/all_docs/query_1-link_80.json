        "text": "Some of the best deals on gaming laptops and even MacBooks have surfaced for Cyber Monday. One of those deals happens on to be on last year’s Alienware Area-51m.\n\nDell is currently slashing $400 off the cost of the modular gaming laptop as part of its Cyber Monday sales, bringing it down to one of its lowest prices yet at roughly $2,700.\n\nWhile $2,700 might seem like a lot to spend on a laptop, it is worth noting that this Alienware Area-51m is a laptop unlike any other. It’s equipped with the Intel Core i7-9700K, which has a total of eight cores. It also sports the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 GPU inside, as well as a total of 16GB of RAM and a 256GB solid-state drive. This Intel processor is something that is usually found on desktops, so the Alienware Area-51m is truly a beast that can handle almost any game or task you throw at it without experiencing slowdown or lag.\n\nThe laptop is also quite modular. At this price, that means you’re not stuck with the specs and components you paid for. Unlike with other gaming laptops in this price range, you’re able to open up the rear of the Area-51m and upgrade components beyond just RAM and hard drives. Both the CPU and GPU are upgradable in this laptop, similar to what you can do on a desktop.\n\nElsewhere, the Alienware Area-51m has a design that is quite futuristic and unique, which helps set it apart from competing laptops from both Razer and HP. It’s sleeker and softer. There is even a futuristic ring of lighting on the back hump that you can customize to your liking."
