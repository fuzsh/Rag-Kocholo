        "text": "The Dell Alienware AW3225QF and the ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM are similar 4k, 240Hz QD-OLEDs that use the same panel. The Dell has a curved screen, while the ASUS is flat, so you may find the ASUS a better choice if you don't like curved displays. Other than that, the Dell is the better choice for console gaming as it has lower input lag at 120Hz and 60Hz. However, the ASUS is better for productivity, especially in a bright room, as it gets brighter and has a few more perks, like a KVM switch.\n\nThe Dell Alienware AW3225QF and the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8/G80SD S32DG80 are both 4k @ 240Hz QD-OLED monitors. The Samsung is the better choice if you plan to use the monitor as a TV, as it has a remote and integrated apps like Netflix. It's also a better choice if you're in a brighter room, as deep blacks look less purple when a considerable amount of light shines on the screen. However, if video quality is very important to you, then the Dell is the better option, as it supports Dolby Vision, and content available in that format will look better.\n\nThe Dell Alienware AW2725DF and the Dell Alienware AW3225QF are both flagship QD-OLED gaming monitors from Dell. They both have extremely similar performance, though the AW2725DF has a 27-inch, 360Hz 1440p display, while the AW3225QF has a 32-inch, 240Hz 4k display. The AW2725DF has a higher refresh rate and requires a less powerful graphics card to drive its 1440p resolution while still having exceptional image quality. If you prefer a larger, more immersive experience, as well as something with Dolby Vision support, the AW3225QF is a great choice. It's also a better choice for console gamers due to its 4k display and HDMI 2.1 bandwidth. However, it requires a more powerful computer to drive its 4k display at its maximum refresh rate.\n\nThe Dell Alienware AW3423DWF and the Dell Alienware AW3225QF are different types of QD-OLED monitors. The AW3225QF is better for most gamers as it has a higher refresh rate and HDMI 2.1 bandwidth, meaning it's ideal for both high-end PC and console gaming. The AW3225QF also has a higher 4k resolution, resulting in more detailed images and improved text clarity, but the AW3423DWF's ultrawide format has an advantage for atmospheric games. Lastly, the AW3225QF has a few extra features, like an eARC port and support for Dolby Vision. Besides that, the picture quality is similar, even if the AW3225QF uses a newer type of QD-OLED panel.\n\nThe Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 S32BG85 and the Dell Alienware AW3225QF are both 4k, 240Hz gaming monitors. They have a few differences, though, particularly with the picture quality, as the Dell has a QD-OLED panel with better blacks and more vivid colors than the Samsung. The Dell doesn't have the same bugs as the Samsung, like with scanlines. On the other hand, the Samsung is the better choice for use in well-lit rooms as it gets bright and doesn't risk burn-in with constant exposure to the same static elements over time.\n\nThe Gigabyte AORUS FO32U2P and the Dell Alienware AW3225QF are 32-inch QD-OLED gaming monitors that have a very similar performance. If you prefer a curved display or plan to watch a lot of movies, the Dell is the better choice, as it has a 1700R curve, supports Dolby Vision, and has an eARC port for sending audio to a soundbar or receiver. However, if you plan to use your monitor for editing or productivity work, the Gigabyte is a better option. In addition to having a flat panel, it also has a KVM switch, provides 65W of power delivery over USB-C, and supports DisplayPort Alt mode.\n\nThe ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM and the Dell Alienware AW3225QF are both OLED gaming monitors with a few differences. The Dell delivers better overall picture quality thanks to its QD-OLED panel, which displays more vivid colors and brighter highlights. It also delivers more detail thanks to its 4k resolution. The Dell can also take full advantage of gaming consoles and HDMI 2.1 graphics cards thanks to its HDMI 2.1 bandwidth. One advantage of the ASUS is that it maintains its perfect black levels even in bright rooms, as black levels rise with ambient light on the Dell.\n\nThe Dell Alienware AW3225QF and the ASUS ROG Strix OLED XG27AQDMG are OLED gaming monitors. The Dell is the better choice if you want an immersive experience, as its larger screen and more detailed images create a more immersive experience. However, the ASUS is a better option if you don't have a very powerful gaming PC, as your computer can run games at a higher frame rate on the monitor's native 1440p resolution than the Dell at its native 4k resolution. The ASUS is also a better choice if you're in a room with a fair bit of ambient light, as deep blacks don't appear slightly purple on the ASUS in that setting.\n\nThe Dell G3223Q and the Dell Alienware AW3225QF are both 4k, 32-inch gaming monitors, but they have a few differences. The AW3225QF is better in most areas as it uses a QD-OLED panel with a better contrast ratio and has brighter highlights and improved overall picture quality. The AW3225QF also has a higher 240Hz refresh rate, making it the better choice for PC gamers. That said, the G3223Q is a bit more versatile if you need something for office work, too, as it gets bright and doesn't risk permanent burn-in with constant exposure to the same static elements over time.\n\nThe ASUS ROG Swift OLED PG34WCDM and the Dell Alienware AW3225QF are large, premium OLED gaming monitors. Both have a 240Hz refresh rate and fantastic gaming and HDR capabilities. However, the Dell has considerably better text clarity, making it better suited to occasional productivity use. However, some may find the ASUS's ultrawide screen more immersive, and it's a better choice if maintaining a high frame rate is important to you, as its lower resolution makes it easier to drive higher frame rates. You may also prefer the ASUS if you're gaming in a brighter environment, as deep blacks won't appear purple in a bright room as they do on the Dell.\n\nThe Dell Alienware AW3225QF and the Cooler Master Tempest GP27U are both 4k gaming monitors with different characteristics. They use different panel technologies, like the Dell monitor's QD-OLED panel, which displays perfect blacks without any blooming, making it the better choice in dark rooms. However, if you want something for bright rooms, the Cooler Master has an advantage because of its high peak brightness. Besides that, the Dell is superior for gaming thanks to its higher refresh rate and faster response time, but the Cooler Master is better for general work use as it doesn't risk permanent burn-in.\n\nThe build quality is excellent. The plastic materials are solid and don't flex easily. The stand is sturdy as it doesn't wobble, and the cable management is easy to use. Overall, it feels great, and there isn't any audible noise coming from a fan. One downside is that the joystick control is loose and creates an audible noise when you use it.\n\nAnother downside is that the packaging it comes in causes some scratches and bubble marks on the screen, which is an issue that others have reported. You can see an example of this in the top right corner of this picture. This isn't so much an issue with how the monitor is made but rather how it's packaged.\n\nThe Dell AW3225QF has decent HDR peak brightness. It gets brightest with small highlights, meaning they really pop against the rest of the image for a vivid HDR experience. However, highlights quickly get dimmer the larger they are. The EOTF follows the target well for most dark and mid-tone scenes until there's a slow roll-off at the peak brightness, meaning it doesn't let highlights get the brightest they can.\n\nThese results are in the 'HDR Peak 1000' Smart HDR mode with the Brightness locked to 75 and Console Mode off. Enabling Console Mode causes the EOTF to have a sharper roll-off, as you can see here.\n\nThe 'HDR Peak 1000' mode is brighter than 'Custom Color HDR,' which has a Real Scene brightness of 356 cd/m², and highlights don't get brighter than 450 cd/m². However, the EOTF has a sharper roll-off later in 'Custom Color HDR,' meaning it doesn't perform any tone mapping before your source does, as you can see here.\n\nThe monitor supports Dolby Vision, and you need to make sure you have the monitor updated to firmware M2B103 or newer for the best performance. As of this firmware update, which was released in Feb. 2024, you can turn Dolby Vision on or off as needed. Before the update, it automatically stayed on, even in Windows HDR, leading to washed-out colors and some issues. Lastly, updating it to this firmware allows Dolby Vision to work with a Blu-ray, as it didn't before.\n\nThe Dell AW3225QF has remarkable accuracy before calibration. The 'Creator' Preset Mode acts as its sRGB mode and locks colors well to the sRGB color space, so they aren't oversaturated. The white balance and most colors have minimal inaccuracies, and even the color temperature is extremely close to the 6500K target. Although it's slightly overbrightened throughout, gamma follows the target curve well. However, to fix this issue, you need to update the firmware to M2B102, which Dell released on Feb. 6, 2024. Otherwise, gamma is worse on older firmware.\n\nLuckily, the 'Creator' mode only locks the RGB settings, so you can still access other settings. Other modes like 'Custom Color' are less accurate, as you can see here.\n\nThe Dell AW3225QF has excellent text clarity. Thanks to its high pixel density, text looks very sharp, and enabling Windows ClearType (top photo) improves the boldness of letters. While it isn't as good as other 4k monitors, like the Dell G3223Q, because programs don't render text well with its triangular subpixel layout, it's still better than other ultrawide QD-OLEDs, like the Dell Alienware AW3423DW. These photos are in Windows 10, and you can also see them in Windows 11 with ClearType on and with ClearType off.\n\nDue to the triangular subpixel layout, there's still some color fringing around letters, and at the edge of windows. It's hard to see unless you look closely at the monitor. Although we didn't experience any eye strain during testing, even with long periods of use, this is something that changes from person to person, and it depends on how sensitive you are to this subpixel layout.\n\nWhile you can reach the max refresh rate with a 4k resolution over DisplayPort and HDMI, your graphics card needs to support Display Stream Compression (DSC) to reach it, which most modern graphics cards support anyway. If you're looking for a monitor that doesn't require DSC to reach 4k @ 240Hz, check out the Gigabyte AORUS FO32U2P, which has DisplayPort 2.1 bandwidth with compatible graphics cards.\n\nSome people have reported connection issues over HDMI, but we didn't experience the same issues with various computers, including those with RTX 3060, 4070, and 4080 graphics cards. That said, your experience may vary.\n\nThe monitor works well with the Xbox Series X|S and supports 4k up to 120Hz thanks to its HDMI 2.1 bandwidth. While you don't need to enable Console Mode for the best compatibility, Dell suggests using it for the best experience with consoles. It also supports Dolby Vision with the Xbox, but it only works with firmware M2B103 and newer. There are some downsides, as you need to enable the console's HDMI override setting to get 1440p @ 60Hz, which also disables VRR. Even with a 1440p @ 60Hz signal, you can't switch it to 120Hz, as you can see here, and the same issue occurs even with firmware M2B105. The Xbox doesn't support HDR with 1080p or 1440p signals, so that isn't an issue with the monitor.\n\nThe Dell AW3225QF works well with macOS. The max refresh rate with a DisplayPort connection is 120Hz, but you can get the max 240Hz refresh rate with an HDMI 2.1 connection with the macOS firmware updated to Sonoma 14.4.1 or newer. If you use an older Mac limited to HDMI 2.0 bandwidth, the max refresh rate is 60Hz, and it doesn't support VRR. HDR looks good in games, but SDR looks better on the desktop, so it's better to turn HDR off for general work use. If you're using a MacBook, windows go back to their original position after reopening the lid or waking the laptop up from sleep.\n\nThe Dell AW3225QF has a few extra features, including:\n\nAlienware Command Center: Application to control the RGB backlighting and other basic functions like power consumption and color profiles. This software is only available on Windows, but you can still change the backlighting colors through the OSD if you have a macOS device. Unfortunately, there's a bug with the RGB lighting. If you change inputs or even power the monitor off and on again, the lights turn on, even if you had them set to off in the Alienware Command Center or in the OSD.\n\nAlienVision: Provides different crosshairs and vision modes. Your game's anti-cheat tool won't detect this, giving you a competitive advantage.\n\nDark Stabilizer: Changes gamma in games so that you can see your opponents more easily in darker areas.\n\nGame Enhance Mode: Provides timer, frame rate counter, and display alignment features.\n\nPIP/PBP: Allows you to display images from two inputs at once, and you can customize the location and size of the windows.\n\nAs expected for an OLED panel, it has a few settings under OLED Panel Maintenance to help reduce the risk of burn-in. Dell also offers a 3-year burn-in warranty.\n\nPixel Refresh: The monitor runs a pixel refresh cycle after every 4 hours of usage, and it takes 6-8 minutes to complete.\n\nPanel Refresh: This is a more complicated process that refreshes the whole panel and takes about an hour to do, but it only runs after 7,000 hours of usage, or you can manually enable it.\n\nThere's also a Panel Health indicator that displays a colored dot to show the status for when you need to run a pixel or panel refresh cycle. While there's no setting for pixel shifting, the monitor automatically performs pixel shifting, although it isn't clear how often."
