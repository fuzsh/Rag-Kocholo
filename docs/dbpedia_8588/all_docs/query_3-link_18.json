Two Alienware branded headsets, several new display technologies, a new esports investment in education, blue light reduction, and custom home installation round out the offerings.\n\n\"Gamers across the globe have high expectations from Alienware and Dell when it comes to our gaming products and without a doubt our latest announcements will exceed even the highest of expectations out there,\" said Frank Azor, vice-president, and general manager of Alienware, G Series, and XPS at Dell. \"To get to this point it has taken over two decades of uncompromising commitment to gamers, the collaboration of an incredibly talented and devoted team, and an ever-expanding group of top-tier partners.\"\n\nNew Alienware m15 and m17 designed from the ground up to be thinner and more powerful with the Legend design\n\nAlienware introduces a totally redesigned Alienware m15 and m17 that is leaner, more advanced and more powerful than its predecessor. With a starting weight under 4.7lbs and 5.8lbs* respectively, Alienware is proud to release its thinnest 15\" and 17\" gaming laptops to date.

Additional design features include an all-magnesium chassis, smooth-edge, narrow-bezel design, re-engineered keyboard, precision-point glass touchpad, SSD-only storage, and per key RGB LED AlienFX lighting.\n\nDell G3 15 introduces mobile gaming at an entry level price point, and new Game Shift feature to optimize performance and productivity\n\nIn its G Series family of gaming laptops for budget-conscious and entry-level players, Dell's G3 15 comes to this year's Computex with even more to offer at a competitive price point. Delivering plenty of power and performance, the new Game Shift feature enables maximum fan speed for optimal processor performance during periods of intense gaming with the click of one button. The 15-inch G3 also shows its outward innovations through a thin-and-sleek design, narrow borders, optional 144Hz gaming display, 4-zone RGB backlit keyboard and a new S-curve design to accommodate larger component ports near the back.\n\n9th Gen Intel Core mobile Processors and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 20-series and GTX 16-series GPUs options drive performance that gamers demand within Alienware m15, m17 and G3 15\n\nThe 9th Gen Intel Core mobile CPUs offer desktop-caliber performance to gaming and creator laptops, delivering up to 5.0 GHz Turbo, 8 cores, and 16 threads, on a platform that handles everything from demanding AAA games to taxing creative workloads like editing and rendering, even when on the go. Complementing this is NVIDIA's new GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphic cards, built with the breakthrough graphics performance of award-winning NVIDIA Turing architecture, a blazing-fast supercharger for today's most popular games. Available on GeForce GTX 1660Ti and RTX 2060, 2070 and 2080 graphics options, HyperEfficient VR technology delivers up to 8-phase graphics voltage regulation and 6-phase processor voltage regulation for longer sustained high-performance.\n\nAlienware debuts two iconic audio devices, the Alienware 7.1 Gaming Headset | AW 510H and Alienware Stereo Gaming Headset | AW 310H\n\nListening closely to the gaming community and catering to the needs of different gamers, Alienware is excited to launch the next generation of wired gaming headsets - the Alienware 7.1 Gaming Headset and Alienware Stereo Gaming Headset.\n\nThe new range of headsets feature hand-picked 50mm high resolution drivers that have been custom-tuned to provide amazing audio clarity. The specially sculpted, deeper audio chambers amplify the resonance and the memory foam ear pads provide a high level of noise isolation. All this is packaged into a sleek, iconic Alienware Legend Design with non-exposed extenders, and a retractable boom microphone that help create a beautiful seamless outline.\n\nEnjoy a fully immersive surround sound gaming experience with the Alienware 7.1 Gaming Headset, with pinpoint accurate sound positioning and astounding clarity. The retractable boom microphone provides consistent voice clarity in team gameplay. Comfort fit earcups incorporating a hybrid of leatherette, sports fabric and memory foam create a deeper acoustic chamber with noise isolation that complements the high-resolution audio. The cushioned leather headband with the ideal clamp force ensures no slippage during those long hours of gaming.\n\nCreated to provide unparalleled clarity, the Alienware Stereo Gaming Headset combines the high-resolution audio of the hand-picked 50mm drivers in custom-tuned audio chambers which allows for fuller, more resonant sound and incredible clarity even during the most chaotic gameplay. Combining both plush memory foam and sports fabric in the ear cups and textured fabric headband, the headset provides optimal cooling, comfort and noise isolation during marathon gaming sessions.\n\nGamers will also enjoy the cross-platform compatibility these headsets provide via the detachable 3.5mm cable that makes it compatible with a variety of gaming platforms.\n\nInnovative Eyesafe® display - low blue light technology for Alienware and G Series\n\nDell G7 17\" and Alienware m17 will be first to offer next generation Eyesafe® display optimized to reduce blue light exposure. This display option will be added to the Alienware Area-51m in June; Dell plans to expand Eyesafe® display across the entire Alienware portfolio in coming months.\n\nEyesafe® reduces high energy blue light emissions while maintaining color accuracy. With many gamers engaging in extended screen time, this added functionality intelligently manages light energy at the source, selectively reducing potentially damaging blue light and dispersing it across the light spectrum. Prolonged exposure to blue light from a typical display may have health impacts that can lead to dry, irritated eyes, trouble sleeping, blurred vision reduced attention span and concentration1.\n\nDell Home Installation Services – the easy, time saving way to set up your new gaming PC at home\n\nThe new Dell Home Installation Services provide a super simple, fast and convenient way to setup latest gaming PCs at home. A technician unpacks and installs the PC, performs the system startup and connects it to your network and peripherals to optimize PC gaming experiences. Optional add-on services are available for an additional cost, including migrating your saved game data or personalized performance settings from the previous PC, and installing additional components like memory, sound cards, video card, a secondary hard drive, optical drive, and multiple monitors.
