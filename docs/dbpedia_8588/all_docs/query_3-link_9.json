        "text": "Beginning a new semester has entitled me to create this new blog account for Consumer Behaviour. Having worked in retail I personally can’t think of that many “good” consumers, so I’ve decided to write about my favourite product instead. ALIENWARE!\n\nAlienware is a gamers computer owned by Dell. As a solid Mac hater, I’m in love with my Alien! Mac has the whole futuristic i’m pretty thing going for it. Though for me I just cant find many advantages. They’re slimline and semi-pretty. However, every single time I use one they end up freezing and not being able to cope with what I’m doing. They aim to be the best, but in doing so, that means they need to please a broad spectrum of consumers, which leaves out some of the niche markets.\n\nI don’t want to be part of the norm…\n\nInstead, my Alienware serves it’s purpose to the fullest. Alienware are gamer positioned laptops and computers, aiming for the best game play possible. I personally don’t play many games on my laptop, though i never experience the spinning wheel of death as I do on apples. Alienware also has features that apple have not got, or are less good, in comparison to Alienware. One of these being the lights which feature on the keyboard, touch pad, the name and around the laptop. The colours for each area can be changed and have options to pulse, fade or stay the same. Even though this may be a minor detail and seem petty, it serves my wants, and therefore they have gained a loyal customer.\n\nLast semester i actually had a girl ask me if my laptop was from 10 years ago, just because it’s thicker than most. i had to describe that mine was actually the newest model and much more powerful than her apple was… some people just don’t get it.\n\nIts good not to be with the crowd. I know it’s just a laptop, but i enjoy that not everyone has what I have. I don’t need to fit in, the laptop helps form my identity. Dell have clearly thought about what their consumers want. They’ve placed their computers in a different category to most and therefore consumers have a greater treasure in their hands. Dell have thought about a smaller market and produced a monster. This benefits both the company and us consumers. They receive more profit, and we get the pure benefits from being different and having a powerful gaming machine.\n\nThis is why this must be one of the best products I’ve purchased up to date. It’s functional and performs well. I have not experienced one issue with it. Dell have done us proud."
