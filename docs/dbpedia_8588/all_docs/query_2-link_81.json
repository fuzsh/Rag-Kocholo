        "text": "The best Alienware gaming laptops offer some incredible power, but they can be pretty pricey. Outside of sales (and we do see a lot of sales) new releases can climb well into high-end ranges, especially once you start throwing RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 graphics cards around. However, compared to the rest of the market, the value proposition in these rigs can often outweigh their higher prices. They remain popular among PC players for good reason, with a solid quality build and excellent engineering.\n\nTo help break the choice down a little, we've rounded up a shortlist of all the best Alienware laptops available right now. Based on our own testing, and the components up for grabs in each model, this list is compiled from both hands-on experience and price-checking competitors for value for money. These are some of the best gaming laptops on the market, especially in their upper configurations.\n\nWe've also listed all the lowest prices from around the web to ensure you save as much money as possible while making such a sizeable, but well-placed, investment.\n\nThe Quick List\n\nThe best Alienware laptop overall\n\nOur favorite configuration:\n\nThe Alienware M18 marks the brand's return to big-screen gaming laptops, but it does so much more than slap an 18-inch display across its hulking chassis. This is a powerful machine running the latest components but still managing to stay within a reasonable price tag.\n\nDesign: Let's get one thing out the way first, this is a giant laptop. Its 18-inch display has to be housed with something after all. However, we were surprised that the M18 doesn't feel as big as it should, thanks to its curved lines and particularly effective sloped front lip. Compared to the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18, a fairly boxy design, this thing feels sleek. We're not getting carried away here, though - this is still a 4.23kg machine so regular transport is out of the question.\n\nEverything else remains as you would expect from Alienware. Yes, that embossed number and cool gray lid, hexagonal grills and narrow keyboard all feels a little tired now, but it's an aesthetic that works and remains subtle while still giving you that RGB glow.\n\nFeatures: That 18-inch display is going a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to features. It's an expansive panel and the best option for anyone after the best Alienware laptop for pure immersion. You've got two display options, a 165Hz QHD+ model and a super speedy 480Hz FHD+ model. It would have been nice to see a split down the middle here, as Asus, Razer, and MSI all offer QHD+ panels in this size with a 240Hz refresh rate.\n\nNevertheless, motion remains slick and the overall picture is still solid - if a little darker due to the matte coating. You'll also find an expansive selection of ports to play with, an impressive 1080p webcam, and a super tactile keyboard with a full-sized number pad built in.\n\nPerformance: The M18 also benefits from have a wide range of configuration options - far more than Asus's competitor. That means you can run from an i7 / RTX 4060 model all the way up to Intel's turbo charged i9 processors and RTX 4090 graphics. We had a top end build in for review, and were blown away by the results. The M18 nearly bested the Asus ROG Strix Scar 18 (the most powerful gaming laptop we've ever had our hands on), offering some benchmark numbers that skirted a little higher than Asus overall.\n\nVerdict: The Alienware M18 isn't without its drawbacks, but if you're after Dell's biggest and best rig you've come to the right place. With a massive range of configuration options, and the power to draw all the best parts of those components out, this is our favorite Alienware laptop overall.\n\nRead more: Alienware M18 review\n\nThe best Alienware laptop for most\n\nOur favorite configuration:\n\nThe latest generation Alienware M16 R2 brings design changes to the forefront of the lineup, but has also dropped higher-end GPUs from its configuration lineup. The resulting RTX 4070 rig is tuned for excellent 1080p play and solid high-settings QHD+ play, with an expansive screen and one of the best keyboards we've seen in a gaming laptop so far. This is the best value Alienware gaming laptop on the market right now, making it the right option for most casual players.\n\nDesign: Alienware has finally listened and dropped that annoying back shelf off its M16 gaming laptops. That means you're getting a normal-shaped machine that can easily fit into a backpack or slot into a desk setup. The thing is, that's not even the best part. We were surprised by just how luxurious the new model feels under hand. Of course, you're still getting the rock solid build quality expected from this brand, but with a matte soft-touch main deck, incredibly tactile feeling keyboard, and a more compact feel overall this feels like a marked step up from previous iterations.\n\nFeatures: Yes, the M16 R2 does tap out at an RTX 4070 GPU, but you're getting a full 175W TDP model here which means you're getting some healthy juice at the same time. That's not something all 16-inch models boast. A 240Hz QHD+ display keeps things humble with a solid panel but without extra HDR or variable refresh rate features to break the bank. Plus, we've still got an excellent array of ports (handily split between the sides and the back) to keep everything connected as well.\n\nPerformance: The Alienware M16 R2 can outperform slimmer models and cheaper, larger devices in more clinical benchmark tests like Fire Strike and Time Spy, and in fairly demanding titles at both high and ultra settings. However, it does struggle with more complex tasks, like Returnal's benchmark. These heavier games can run at a smooth 60fps with a few graphical tweaks, though, and with a strong 1080p performance there's excellent flexibility baked in.\n\nVerdict: The Alienware M16 R2 is more of an all-rounder than a storming gaming device, but if you're looking for a workhorse productivity machine that can also turn its hand to fairly demanding games it's a gem. This is the best value for money on Alienware's shelves overall right now, making it the best choice for most players.\n\nRead more: Alienware M16 R2 review\n\nThe best 15.6-inch Alienware laptop\n\nOur favorite configuration:\n\nDell refreshed both the x15 and x17 back in 2022, though even today these are not cheap rigs. That said, paying for luxury certainly has its benefits - this was one of the best looking and feeling Alienware laptops we've ever had our hands on. Plus it's certainly not as pricey as the 17-incher.\n\nDesign: If you're familiar with the Alienware X-Series nothing's going to shock you here. The crisp white shell of our test unit made the already super slim form factor feel all the more slick, and that 2.2kg is a feat of considerable engineering considering the components underneath. The inset hinge does add a little more to the footprint overall, but it's not as egregious as some of the more recent Alienware gaming laptops, and the RGB LEDs keep everything looking sharp in the meantime.\n\nFeatures: The Alienware X15 R2 brings with it Intel's new 12th generation processors, the capacity to build up to that Nvidia's RTX 3080 Ti GPU, and extra attention paid to the LEDs running along the back of the chassis. It's still the slimline, highly powerful rig we've all come to welcome onto the premium shelf, but refreshed to keep up with 2022's components.\n\nWith four fans and the brand's 'Element 31' cooling solutions under the hood, Alienware has paid more attention to keeping things running smoothly. Unfortunately, it's still not quite enough to keep those temperatures down - the x15 R2 still runs particularly hot at full whack, with some impact to performance after around an hour of gameplay. Still, you're getting a gorgeous screen up top, a handy rear IO placement, and a snappy tactile keyboard - though the mechanical option will cost you extra.\n\nPerformance: If you do want to go all out in your configuration, you're in safe hands here. Our RTX 3080 Ti test unit posted some seriously impressive numbers - outpacing the Razer Blade 15 in industry testing and storming through in-game benchmarks. Three figure framerates were the norm in titles like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and Total War: Three Kingdoms, with more demanding games like Metro Exodus and Red Dead Redemption 2 still posting well above 60fps at Ultra settings.\n\nVerdict: You're still getting that sleek form factor, Intel 12th generation chipset, and radical RTX 3080Ti opportunities, but without dropping an insane amount of cash like you would with the 17.3-inch version. Don't get us wrong, these are still premium machines - but with prices cutting slightly under those of the 17-incher things are that little bit more reachable here.\n\nRead more: Alienware x15 R2 review\n\nThe best 14-inch Alienware laptop\n\nOur favorite configuration:\n\nDell has shrunk its premium line of gaming laptops with the Alienware x14. Taking the luxury design of the x15 and x17 models and whittling it down to a new 14-inch form factor, this is the smallest Alienware laptop currently on the market. That means you're dropping down a few pegs in terms of your configuration, especially compared to the high-flying specs of the larger models.\n\nDesign: The Alienware x14 is all about its design. It's an impossibly slimline machine, measuring just 14.4mm thick. That's the skinniest machine we've ever tested, so if you're after a portable device this is where you need to be looking. Of course, you've still got that luxury X-Series build quality and aesthetic, with a crisp '14' embossed on the lid, and a futuristic but still refined design overall. The larger area behind the hinge may cause some transportation issues if you've got a particularly tight fitting backpack, and it's a little frustrating to see in this smaller form factor machine, but overall this thing is built to go everywhere with you.\n\nFeatures: The x14 comes with an RTX 3050, RTX 3050 Ti, or RTX 3060 GPU, paired up with either an Intel i5-12500H or i7-12700H processor. Those smaller specs mean that this is one of the cheapest Alienware laptops currently available, when configured as such. We tested an RTX 3060 / i7 configuration, but that rig costs close to $2,000. We thought that was a little hard to swallow considering every Alienware x14 ships with the same 1080p 144Hz display. However, down at the bottom end of the price scale there's actually some solid value for money. That's why we'd recommend checking this machine if you're after form factor over performance, aiming for an RTX 3050 GPU.\n\nPerformance: Straight out the gate, it's clear this isn't a gaming laptop designed to prioritise performance. We were impressed with the 108 average frames per second on Highest settings in Shadow of the Tomb Raider, and while more demanding titles like Red Dead Redemption 2 did present more of a challenge, we were still benchmarking at 55fps in High. Your performance is hampered by the slimline design, but if you're just looking for a casual machine you'll get by.\n\nVerdict: You're paying for the high-end engineering, design, and build quality here - all wrapped up in a super skinny machine that can slide easily into any backpack. While that means the Alienware x14 isn't going to win any benchmark comparisons, it does provide an excellent all-round approach to portable work and lighter play.\n\nRead more: Alienware x14 review\n\nBack to top\n\nBest Alienware laptops: FAQ\n\nWhat is the best Alienware laptop?\n\nThe best Alienware laptop overall is currently the Alienware M18 as it performs the best out of each model and packs the largest screen to boot.\n\nIs Alienware still the best?\n\nAlienware gaming laptops have been top tier for years now, but other brands have caught up. As it stands, Alienware is an expensive option with configurations (particularly of the more premium X-Series) often costing far more than cheaper machines. However, the engineering and build quality of these machines is among the best in the business. Whether or not Alienware is the best brand for you comes down to your budget and how you want to use your machine. For portability? No, Alienware isn't the best. For a static rig designed for raw power? This could be the right brand for you.\n\nAre Alienware laptops worth it?\n\nAt first glance, Alienware laptops might seem overpriced - you'd be justified in calling them the 'Apple' of gaming. However, they earn that price tag with accessibility, ease-of-use, and smart design that sets them apart from other manufacturers.\n\nAlongside fierce technical capabilities that allow them to run today's games at their best, Alienware gaming laptops come ready-made and good to go, without a thoughtful design in both engineering and aesthetic.\n\nHappily, Alienware is keen to make sure there's something to suit your budget as well. The official website lists a variety of builds with different costs, allowing you to pick and choose what you want. And if you decide you should have opted for more power down the line? It's often easy enough to open the case and upgrade your rig yourself.\n\nHow we test Alienware laptops\n\nFinding the very best Alienware laptops is no mean feat. Of course, Dell only produces so many ranges and models per year - but not each one carries its price tag the same way. We run all gaming laptops that pass our desks through a series of industry tests, while working and playing with them for a considerable amount of time in every day life. That way we can accurately judge the value proposition on offer, and determine just how far that price tag will take you.\n\nOur testing covers everything from GPU performance to storage speeds, using 3D Mark, Cinebench, PC Mark 10, and Crystal Disk Mark to ensure we have a set of baseline data to compare models. After that, we see how each Alienware laptop fares in the real world, with framerate tests across Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Total War: Three Kingdoms, Metro Exodus, The Division 2, and Red Dead Redemption 2.\n\nThese laptops also slot directly into our everyday lives when we're testing, which means we have the chance to see exactly how they fare against daily work and play, while also testing battery, portability, and overall quality of life as well.\n\nYou can find more information on how we review the products we recommend in our full Hardware Policy, and we're also showing you exactly how we test gaming laptops for more details as well.\n\nBack to top"
