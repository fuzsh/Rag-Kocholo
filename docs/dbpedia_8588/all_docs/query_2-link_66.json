        "text": "This post contains affiliate links. OzBargain might earn commissions when you click through and make purchases. Please see this page for more information.\n\nCheaper than last time it was posted on OzBargain. Equal all time low, as it was posted near the start of the year for $351.93 if you had access to the Dell Student purchase program.\n\nYou need to generate a unique TechRadar coupon code for 7% off Dell monitors and apply it in the checkout to get this price. This is a limited time deal, as the coupons only last till the 8th of August unless they run out sooner. Or Dell might increase the price.\n\n27-inch IPS panel\n\n4K 3840 x 2160 at 60Hz\n\n99% sRGB colour gamut\n\nBrightness: 350 cd/m²\n\nContrast Ratio: 1000:1\n\nResponse Time: 4 ms\n\nInputs: 2 x HDMI 2.0\n\nInput: USB-C upstream – DisplayPort with Power Delivery (DisplayPort 1.4 mode / power up to 65W)\n\n2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports for plugging in things like external drives, one does charging (for a phone)\n\nStand: Height, pivot (rotation), swivel, tilt\n\n3 Watt speakers\n\nAMD FreeSync\n\nThe S2722QC is nice because you can plug a laptop in and charge it at the same time and it means you don’t need a dock.\n\nDell Manual\n\nRtings.com review\n\nI work for TechRadar AU and I have trawled the Dell website and can’t find any other monitors that are a good deal currently with the 7% off. Some are an ok deal, and the 7% coupon discount worked on every consumer display I tried. So Gaming, S series and Alienware monitors. (But not P or E series, or Ultrasharp) I couldn’t find any other coupons that stack unfortunately!\n\nKeep in mind that the coupon may not work with cashback – I can’t confirm either way but others have mentioned it before.\n\nOh and @freshofftheplane – this deal is just for you."
