        "text": "AMD is looking to take the enthusiast gaming PC market by storm with its upcoming Ryzen Threadripper family, and Dell is apparently more than happy to embrace the new many-core processors. Today at E3, Dell announced the new Alienware Area-51 Threadripper Edition, which as its name implies, is backed by AMD’s top-of-the line consumer CPUs.\n\nThe Area-51 Threadripper Edition of course features an AMD X399 chipset-based motherboard and is available with either 12- or 16-core Ryzen Threadripper processors, delivering a total of 24 or 32 threads respectively. In addition, Dell says that both processors will be unlocked and overclocked from the factory across all cores and threads. Cooling for this potent new processing power plant will be provided by Alienware’s most powerful liquid-cooling system ever.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that throughout the rest of 2017, Dell will be the exclusive OEM partner for delivering pre-built, 16-core AMD Ryzen Threadripper systems to customers.\n\nIn addition, Dell is co-announcing that it will have a version of the Area-51 that will be powered by Intel’s newly announced Core-X Series of enthusiast-class processors. Base systems will come with the 6-core Core i7-7800X, while the flagship will come with a 12-core Core i9-7920X. This Intel-flavored Area-51 uses the all-new X299 chipset and offers something that the AMD-based systems won't — support for Intel Optane Memory in 16GB and 32GB configurations.\n\nNo matter if you select AMD or Intel power, you will find plentiful storage options (SATA and M.2 PCIe), support for up to three graphics cards (NVIDIA SLI, AMD CrossFire), with the most powerful single-card option being the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti. Dell says that the cutting-edge processors and GPUs available in the Area-51 will enable a suitable platform for virtual reality, 4K or even 8K gaming.\n\nDell says that the AMD Threadripper Edition will be available on July 27th, and pricing will be announced “soon.” The Area-51 with Intel Core X-Series processors will debut in “late summer.”\n\nDell is complementing its revamped Area-51 lineup with three new Alienware gaming monitors. The first is the AW2518 that measures 24.5-inches of display real estate, has a Full HD resolution, a native refresh rate of 240Hz and 1ms response times with overdrive. It will be available in NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync versions, priced at $499.99 and $699.99 respectively.\n\nAvailability for this new Alienware gaming monitor hasn’t been announced at this time, but we’re assuming that it will coincide with the launch of the Area-51 Threadripper Edition."
