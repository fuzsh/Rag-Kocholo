They don't want to support the CPU for X years but general warranty and support for 2 years or whatever the company agreement is with the buyer/corp account.\n\nPosted on Aug 7th 2024, 22:55 Reply\n\n#2\n\nRavenmaster\n\nI think it would be a neat gesture of good will if Intel were to setup a trade-in program with their retail partners so that customers who bought a 13th or 14th gen CPU can trade them in against a new Arrow Lake CPU to get a partial discount towards the upgrade. That way they get to semi-recall their faulty stock without calling it a recall and customers get a better replacement.\n\nPosted on Aug 7th 2024, 23:54 Reply\n\n#3\n\nthesmokingman\n\nHaha, the irony!\n\nThis is followed by Puget Systems which will offer three years\n\nPosted on Aug 7th 2024, 23:59 Reply\n\n#4\n\ntfp\n\nthesmokingmanHaha, the irony!\n\nIt helps their numbers if they can ignore issues after 3 years or what ever the standard warranty period is\n\nPosted on Aug 8th 2024, 0:05 Reply\n\n#5\n\nthesmokingman\n\ntfpIt helps their numbers if they can ignore issues after 3 years or what ever the standard warranty period is\n\nIt's ironic cuz Puget's ceo is on the Intel board.\n\nPosted on Aug 8th 2024, 0:23 Reply\n\n#6\n\nVisible Noise\n\nthesmokingmanIt's ironic cuz Puget's ceo is on the Intel board.\n\nNo, he is not.\n\nwww.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/board-of-directors.html?filters=%5B-7300596454,2661798488%5D#gs.adu4oi\n\nPosted on Aug 8th 2024, 1:02 Reply\n\n#7\n\numeng2002\n\nYou wut m8?\n\nPosted on Aug 8th 2024, 1:22 Reply\n\n#8\n\nthesmokingman\n\nVisible NoiseNo, he is not.\n\nwww.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/board-of-directors.html?filters=%5B-7300596454,2661798488%5D#gs.adu4oi\n\nOf advisors...\n\nPosted on Aug 8th 2024, 1:43 Reply\n\n#9\n\nVisible Noise\n\nthesmokingmanOf advisors...\n\nYes, and?

The expected way for OEM to be sold is as part of a system, not standalone.\n\nPosted on Aug 8th 2024, 9:22 Reply\n\n#19\n\n_roman_\n\nIf you bought a soldered CPU on a mainboard or a prebuild system deal with it.\n\nIt's a customer choice to pay someone to use proper parts to build something or replace something (repair is something different as replacing non functioning parts).\n\nA customer should inform himself before he buys something. I went to desktop computer because there are hardly any modular laptops anymore available since Intel ivybridge.\n\nPosted on Aug 8th 2024, 10:06 Reply\n\n#20\n\nHecate91\n\nTheinsanegamerNI think one of the biggest issues for Intel is actually ensuring the problem is fixed.

Although i've seen posts saying recent RMAs come with the updated microcode on the CPU.\n\n_roman_A customer should inform himself before he buys something. I went to desktop computer because there are hardly any modular laptops anymore available since Intel ivybridge.\n\nIt isn't the consumers fault for these issues, there is no way anyone could've known when buying a system with an Intel CPU, and in my opinion the way Intel has handled the issues with laptop or soldered CPUs has been unacceptable, because there are reports of crashing with laptops but Intel hasn't even admitted to the issues.\n\nlexluthermiesterJon being on an advisory board at Intel is no different from being a consultant for the government.

Like, where's the foul play in them showing that AMD is faster in photoshop or after effects ?\n\nPosted on Aug 8th 2024, 11:48 Reply"
