It's buying Miami-based Alienware. The company's high-ends P-Cs are widely acclaimed by gaming fanatics for their fast performance and sleek, U-F-O-themed looks.\n\nDell hasn't announced terms of the deal, which will help expand its offerings for the lucrative gaming and multimedia market. Dell says Alienware would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary and will keep its brand name and many of its own operations.\n\nAlienware was founded in 1996 by Nelson Gonzalez and Alex Aguila, two childhood friends who have built a cult-like following for their P-Cs that cost an average of about three- to four-thousand dollars. They will continue to run the company as a standalone unit of Round Rock, Texas-based Dell."
