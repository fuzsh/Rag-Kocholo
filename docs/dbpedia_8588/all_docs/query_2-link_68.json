        "text": "There is no fix for Intel’s crashing 13th and 14th Gen Raptor Lake desktop processors. If your chip isn’t yet damaged, please apply motherboard BIOS updates early and often to prevent issues. If it’s already damaged, your only option is to exchange it.\n\nBut what if you didn’t buy a chip — but, rather, an entire PC? Will PC makers have your back? Will they pass along the extra two years of warranty that Intel just theoretically granted them, or will they perhaps try to save money at your expense?\n\nOn Tuesday, Intel confirmed it will extend its warranty by two entire years for 24 different CPUs that may be affected.
