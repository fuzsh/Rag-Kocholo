        "text": "I cannot answer your question directly but I can offer some thoughts.\n\nIf the device last the first year when it is under warranty then it is likely to have a long low problem life after that. This is the bathtub curve idea of reliability with age. Your experiences appear to be an example of this. It means that buying extra years of warranty to add to the first year may not be cost effective as the incidences of hardware problems are low anyhow and perhaps it is better to have a spare PC or laptop.\n\nI am not certain that more expensive business grade laptops last that much better in a rough environment that home consumer grade laptops. Plenty of schools use Chromebooks without too much hardware problems.\n\nWhat do you mean by Dell Business? Do you mean the Vostro line, or Optiplex? There’s a huge difference. Also, are you including XPS?\n\nBy my reckoning, Inspiron and Vostro are pretty similar. Vosto will more likely come with Windows Pro, but the products have much shorter manufacturing timelines like Inspiron, and there are a plethora of models, each slightly tweaked depending on which components Dell can most easily get, or for specific channels. Inspiron and Vostro are aimed mostly by price.\n\nOptiplex and Latitude are built for long lifecycles, where Dell has commitments to have replacement parts available for at least 5 years after sale of the last device, with predictable lifecycles. Heck, they publish the availability dates and lifecycle for products they haven’t even shipped yet (requires Dell Premier account access). Having something predictable and not flavor of the month has greater costs to supply, and the costs are greater. These are also aimed at organizations that could buy buying tens of thousands of units at a time. Those units need to all be the same, and be of higher initial and ongoing quality. You should also get directed to support queues that are meant for supporting IT professionals, not random end users.\n\nAs far as I can tell from the Dell website the only overlap is the XPS line which I don’t truly consider to be a business line. It’s better than Inspiron, but not in the the same class as the Latitude, Optiplex and Precision lines. I don’t bother with the Vostro line as I have never heard anything good about them.\n\nWe buy almost exclusively Latitudes, Optiplexs and Precisions based on needed use. The couple of times I bought XPS computers because they had a feature (small and really really lightweight) that wasn’t available in the true business lines at the time, they never lasted as long or held up as well. We run our laptops 3-4 years and desktops 5 years for daily use. And then we move them out of daily use into special projects with light usage and hold on to them for a few more years. The XPS machines were always lucky to make it to 3 years.\n\nIn short, Dell have a few brands (or lines) like Alienware (Gaming PC & Lappy), Vostro (SMB PC & Lappy), Precision (workstation & mobile workstation), XPS (advanced SMB & home lappy), Inspirion (Home PC & lappy), Latitude (Business Lappy) & Optiplex (Business PC).\n\nIf you choose Dell home, you get gaming, home & SMB range of machines\n\nIf you choose Dell business, you get SMB range & Business range of machines. In some cases for SMB range, you also get Dell Pro-support options & longer support terms (like 5 yrs, for some models).\n\nThen as most of the Dell support is onsite, they need to at least get a rough idea of what is wrong so that the onsite engineer can bring the correct parts. Sadly if you get monkey or human really depends on the manpower resources available but it is known that the business support especially the pro-support numbers get better quality staff. I have been to their call center in KL and noticed that some of them are tagged with model series on their screen so that only under busy conditions, a person “not qualified” to handle that model is then assigned to handle calls for another model. However I did not visit their “home” call center so I do not know what it is like there.\n\nAs for DOA…it really depends on the Dell logistics company. I have lappy that came with melted screens (all 100 or 150 of them) while I have deliveries where there are not even scratches on the boxes while some have dents at the corners etc.\n\nLike what Kevin mentioned, the Dell Prevision, Optiplex & Latitude do carry parts for 5yrs or even 7yrs as of EOS (End of Sale). Just that you may have to pay more if your system have expired warranty and IF Dell is willing to sell you that part.\n\nIn my experience, The Latitude and Optiplex lines have been rock solid. With that said. Every few years, they seem to have what I have come to call a Lemon Year Model. For example, the Optiplex 745’s were impossible to kill, while the 755’s I had constant problems. The 960’s were really good though. This trend seems to be the same with laptops. The D610, I had tons of issues but the D620 was a tank. The E6420 was one of the best and longest laptops I have worked with, while the E6400 was mostly problematic. I seen the same issue with Precision Laptops too. What I noticed is the ones with a ton of BIOS updates that tend to go above the A30’s seems to have the most problems. With that said, I think I have had more problems with their Home line than their business line. They use cheap plastic shells, they have all these unnecessary buttons that need you to install crappy software to get to work. Usually the cooling is inadequate.\n\nThis, to me has seemed to be the trend with Dell, since that is what I have been using for years. It feels like you usually end up beta testing the next model that has all the issues the previous model had. The sad truth is, HP, Dell, Lenovo, and other OEM’s all get their internal hardware made from the same few companies. So it really comes down to where you want to end up getting support from. I personally have had much better Support with Dell Business myself.\n\nWith the current situation with the silicon shortage, I think that QC has gone down with every company. They are simply taking what they can get right now just to be able to sell something."
