        "text": "The best Alienware gaming PC builds are some of the most unique-looking rigs out there, but they boast more than just sci-fi style. Dell uses a bunch of different configurations within its striking cases, with flagship models sporting powerhouse Nvidia and AMD GPUs. Not to mention you'll end up with fantastic CPU and RAM combos that'll make short work of system requirements. Whether you're looking for a 4K system that can crunch UHD visuals with an RTX 4090, or a great value powerhouse that balances capabilities and cost, we're here to help you find a reliable rig with space-age flair.\n\nRight now, our best Alienware gaming PC we've tested is the Aurora R15, as it boasts tremendous specs and an iconic case-design. It's worth noting that the new Aurora R16 boasts qualities that are worth checking out, like a refined cooling system, but you're more likely to find the previous version for a better price than the flagship. It's also worth keeping an eye out for older models like the R13 too, as the model still packs contemporary specs and sometimes like to pop up in bargain bins across the web.\n\nTo help you get in on the Aurora action, we've whipped up a list of the best Alienware rigs available now. Our list covers shiny new Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 builds, older models, and everything in between, so there's something for all players below. That said, it's worth keeping in mind that Dell likes to discontinue previous versions of its gaming PC line-up once the latest version is out. To combat this, we've rounded up the best specs and builds to aim for at other third-party retailers while stock is still around.\n\nThe quick list\n\nThe best Alienware gaming PC\n\nThe Alienware Aurora R15 is a powerhouse pre-build that'll make short work of your Steam library, even at 4K with ultra ray tracing enabled. The rig's lofty specs and curious case design embody the brand's out-of-this-world vibe more so than even the newer Aurora R16, but there are a few caveats to consider when it comes to upgradability.\n\nDesign: Dell's Alienware rigs traditionally look a little funky, but the R15 could be the last machine to feature an otherworldly aesthetic. Its space-capsule inspired case isn't going to be everyone's jam, and you certainly won't be able to lazily sit things on top of this beast. However, its RGB lighting and weird shape are iconic and will turn a few heads at LAN events should you lug it to any big multiplayer outings.\n\nWhile there's nothing stopping you cracking open Dell's capsule PC and tinkering inside, you might find there's little you can actually change. The proprietary motherboard inside only features two DIMM slots, meaning your options are limited when it comes to upgrading RAM. There's also not much space unoccupied within the case, so trying to squeeze different parts inside could be something of a difficult voyage.\n\nFeatures: Some of the R15's biggest features are tied to its aesthetic, with a custom motherboard and AIO cooler working to provide a unique flair and elevated efficiently. Compared to the R14, Dell says it has increased airflow by 19%, and resulting GPU noise has been reduced by 32%. Not that you want this rig to blend into the background, which explains why it features flamboyant RGB lighting throughout its design that can be customised using AlienFX software.\n\nPerformance: We've put the Aurora R15 through our usual benchmarking tests, and it's clear that the rig has awesome capabilities. Supporting up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, Intel Core i9-13600K CPU, and 32GB DDR5 RAM, we're talking about specs that could rival any machine in the market. The result? Well, the setup can run Cyberpunk 2077 at 147fps at 4K with ultra ray tracing settings enabled, albeit with a helping hand from DLSS 3 AI upscaling.\n\nThe Aurora R15 also isn't the quietest system around, but not because it's overly noisy. Its plastic case seems to create strange acoustics that produce an eerie sound, which is perhaps appropriate given its extra territorial design. It also tends to creak a little as internal temperatures rise and fall, which sort of sounds like it's going to transform and take off.\n\nVerdict: The Aurora R15 is the best Alienware gaming PC we've tried to date, and it's got plenty to offer on the performance front. That fact alone might maybe up for its upgradeability pitfalls, as you probably won't need to even think about switching out its core parts for many years to come.\n\nRead more: Alienware Aurora R15 review\n\nThe best budget Alienware gaming PC\n\nThe Alienware Aurora R13 isn't the newest Alienware rig, but we still hold it in high regard. Not only did it set the stage for the R14 and R15 in terms of case design and approach, its innards will still make short work of your Steam library without compromise.\n\nDesign: Yes, the older R13 does look almost identical to the newer R15 model, which could be a strong reason to opt for it if one becomes available. Let's be real, many of you out there simply want a rig that'd feel at home in the Alien franchise, and up until the release of the R16, Dell has been following the same design blue print we've come to love. RGB lighting and that unique looking AIO cooler help provide flair from within thanks to the Aurora's glass side panel, so it's just as flashy than some of the latest Alienware builds out there.\n\nFeatures: In a way, we have the Aurora R13 to thank for the R14 and R15, as it was the first Alienware rig to feature a Cryo-Tech AIO cooler. There are still fan options available, but this machine comes with the benefit of lower temps in even the most demanding gaming scenarios. Intel's 12th gen CPUs can generate a fair amount of heat, so using liquid rather than purely air does help prevent the system's quirky design succumbing to toasty temperatures.\n\nPerformance: The main weakness of the Alienware Aurora R13 is the same issue that's plagued many of the systems in our roundup, and that's cooling. Dell has opted for a 120mm AIO water cooler in this machine this time around, and while a marginal improvement given the hardware here, the small-size radiator/pump combo does struggle to cool the demanding components sometimes. It's loud, too. Still, the performance on display certainly speaks for itself, still holding up even in 2024.\n\nIf you're able to find an R13 today for the right price, those cooling pitfalls shouldn't deter you from a bargain. Afterall, we're still talking about a high-spec build that comes in RTX 3090 flavors, and while enthusiasts will rightly find reason to grumble about temps, you're still going to be able to boost fps to ridiculous heights compared to an average machine. It perhaps better serves as a 1440p option since it'll serve up frame rates well over 170fps in the likes of Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but it should be able to pull off 4K in many scenarios.\n\nVerdict: Even today, the Alienware Aurora R13 stands as a great gaming PC capable of exceptional QHD results. You'll naturally want to make sure you're paying much less for it than newer models, but it seems to be the system that likes to pop up for less whenever retails come across old stock. It'll no doubt fall off the list eventually as more Aurora models arrive, but we're still holding onto this glorious oddball for now.\n\nRead more: Alienware Aurora R13 review\n\nThe best premium Alienware gaming PC\n\nThe Aurora R16 is the newest Alienware gaming PC you can buy, and it features a rather down to earth design that's both more subtle and provides better cooling. Dell has removed a lot of the redundant materials from its boutique build in the name of optimisation, but the innards of this system are still unmistakeably Alienware.\n\nDesign: Dell claims the Aurora R16 runs 7% cooler than its R15 predecessor, and it's 20% quieter to boot. That's going to appeal to anyone worried about high spec gaming thermals, as the new design allows the build's AIO cooler to perform efficiently. Arguably, it also looks better than previous models, featuring a case that looks conventional. That said, if you're an Alienware fan, you're likely not looking for a down to earth system in the first place.\n\nFeatures: There are a few constants with Aurora gaming rigs, like AIO coolers, custom motherboards, and RGB lighting. That said, the R16 ditches a lot of Dell's usual DNA for a more refined approach, focusing instead on getting the most out of the expensive parts inside than acting like a PC peacock. Now that the company's systems come with DDR5 options and speedy M.2 drives, it feels like Alienware rigs are properly equipped to take on conventional rivals and receive less scrutiny from enthusiasts.\n\nPerformance: The newest Aurora supports up to an RTX 4090, 13th gen Intel i9 CPU, and 32GB DDR5 RAM. Technically, that means it's not really offering anything over and above the previous R15 model, but Dell's pitch this time around focusses on the system's overall redesign and extra efficiency. If you're not really into conventional looks, that's not going to appeal to you. Otherwise, this is arguably the definitive Alienware rig.\n\nVerdict: We know some of you out there will be disappointed with the Aurora R16's fairly conventional approach to case design. However, when it comes to raw performance and having universal appeal, the new Alien on the ship wins out. With various configurations available and flashy innards throughout the board, Dell has seemingly found a way to make an otherworldly machine without falling folly to over engineering and style over substance.\n\nBest Alienware gaming PCs - Frequently asked questions\n\nIs Alienware just Dell?\n\nSort of! Alienware is a subsidiary of Dell, which means they're a company that is directly owned, and will be influenced by Dell, but they aren't Dell directly. Alienware focuses directly on the gaming PC and gaming laptop market, and a lot of their products tend to take on a lot more flashy design work that isn't typically found in Dell's product ranges.\n\nIs Alienware good for gaming?\n\nAlienware is one of the best gaming PC brands with hardware and software geared specifically around gaming. Programmes such as Alienware Command Centre gives users good control over how their system operates in everything from the fan speeds to the RGB colors, too. In our testing, we've found Alienware machines to work incredibly well depending on their overall configuration.\n\nDoes Alienware still exist?\n\nYes, Alienware PCs still exist, and they rank among the best pre-built gaming PC options out there. While you potentially last rocked an Alienware rig back in the early 2000s, Dell's premium range has kept up with the times, and builds bearing the Alien head emblem wield high-spec GPUs and CPUs.\n\nWhy is Alienware so expensive?\n\nAlienware gaming PCs are high end builds, and the parts dwelling within Dell's rigs aren't cheap. You can customise some components if you're on a budget, but you're ultimately going to end up with system armed with the latest Nvidia or AMD graphics card paired with a shiny new CPU.\n\nIs Alienware worth it?\n\nWe think that Alienware is worth the price of investment despite the premium price tag these machines usually carry. All Alienware machines that we've had our hands on have been very well built and able to be pushed to their limits. One thing we can tell you, though, is that Alienware PCs do get quite loud and warm under stress, but that's ultimately par the course depending on how high-end you go for.\n\nHow much does an Alienware gaming PC cost?\n\nAlienware gaming PCs generally start from around the $1,100 mark depending on what hardware you opt for in your machine. It's entirely possible to find Alienware gaming PC deals all year round, but you can also find deep discounts often, too, with frequent special events.\n\nBest Alienware gaming PC 2024: Minimum specs to look for\n\nWhen looking for the best Alienware gaming PC, you want the most bang for your buck as possible, especially when Alienware products aren't the cheapest you'll find. You want to make sure that your rig is futureproofed with solid specs, but what are these? We've supplied our minimum spec recommendations for in 2024 down below.\n\nIn particular, we'd look to secure an NVMe, Gen 4 M.2 SSD, as we consider these the best SSDs for gaming. As for capacity, don't get your wallet out for anything less than 500GB. Yes, there are some exceptions. If a prebuilt PC comes with a hybrid storage system, so 250GB of SSD combined with 2TB of HDD, maybe it's alright. But ideally, you don't want an SSD in your machine that's less than 500GB.\n\nElsewhere, look for a 13th Gen Intel Core i9, or AMD Ryzen 5 or 7 processor, as these are often the best CPUs for gaming. 11th Gen, or 5000 series AMD CPUs are the absolute minimum we'd shoot for in the year of our lord 2024. These chips will perform just fine, but they won't be futureproofed going forward. Also worth keeping in mind, is that DDR5 RAM is only compatible with certain motherboards, and by proxy, will only reach its top speeds with a newer generation CPU.\n\nThe choice that will impact price the most, is whether or not you get one of the best graphics cards. At this point in time, we'd recommend an RTX 4060 and above, since these are now readily available and much more affordable. If you've got the budget, you'll perhaps want to pick up a build with a shiny new RTX 4090 inside, as that way you'll be able to smash through system requirements for new releases with no compromise. That said, the new Aurora R16 actually caps out at the RTX 4080, so keep that in mind if you're looking for the absolute best Aurora rig in terms of performance.\n\nIn terms of memory, we'd look for 16GB of DDR4 as a minimum. If you can get DDR5, then even better, just make sure your motherboard supports it. It's also worth noting that some builds only come with two DIMM slots, meaning there will be limits on how many modules you can use to upgrade.\n\nLastly, it's important to highlight that there are major design differences between the the Aurora R16 and previous machines, as the latest version features a more traditional shape and refined cooling system. So, if you'd rather opt for something less flashy, picking up the newest model might make all the difference.\n\nHow we test Alienware gaming PCs at GamesRadar+\n\nOur expert team spends countless hours putting gaming PCs through their paces, and Alienware rigs are no exception. While performance capabilities are at the forefront of our testing, we also closest consider specs, design, features, and price to determine whether a system should make our recommended list.\n\nIn a way, gaming PCs are multiple products in one, and our tests involve benchmarking each system's graphics card and CPU in addition to the entire rig. To maintain consistency, we use a set collection of games to collect data on frame rates, temperatures, and general performance, which can be then used to compare against alternatives.\n\nOur a full rundown, check out how we test gaming PCs for more information on our benchmark procedures.
