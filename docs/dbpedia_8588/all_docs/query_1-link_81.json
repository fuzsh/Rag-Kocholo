        "text": "Synopsis\n\nIt's the first gaming laptop that lets you upgrade the CPU and GPU just like a desktop.\n\nDell Alienware Area-51m\n\nPrice: Rs 2,53,890 onwards\n\nRating: ****\n\nSpecifications: 17.3-inch IPS LCD (144Hz, 1920 x 1080 pixel display), 9th gen Intel Core i7/i9 processor, 16/32GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 2070/2080 GPU with 8GB memory, 512GB SSD + 1TB HDD, 3 x USB 3.0 ports, USB Type-C port, Alienware Graphics Amplifier port, HDMI out, Ethernet, WiFi ac, Bluetooth 5.0, HD webcam, 3.5mm headphone jack + headphone/mic combo jack, Windows 10 Home, 3.87 kg\n\nPros: Desktop-class performance on a laptop, high quality & fast refresh rate screen with slim bezels, loud audio, plethora of ports, CPU and GPU can be upgraded when required, premium design with futuristic elements, great keyboard, 2.5Gbps Ethernet support\n\nCons: White colour on top model tends to pick up dirt quickly, heavy at 3.87kg, requires 2 power adapters for full performance (both supplied in box), no 4k screen option, no gaming accessories bundled in the price, webcam quality is a letdown considering the hardware and price\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nAsus ROG Zephyrus S GX701 review: A lightweight gaming laptop with top-notch specs\n\nAlienware is a name associated with top-spec gaming machines. With a lot more brands jumping into the fray, it was up to Alienware to shake things up again. This is where the latest Alienware 51m laptop comes in.\n\nWith the Alienware 51m, Dell has completely revamped expectations from a gaming laptop. We’re not just talking about design but the overall capability too. The 51m gives you desktop class performance with several hardware upgrade options, just like a desktop. No other laptop offers the kind of flexibility that the 51m does. There are a few components that enable this. First, a desktop-class processor (laptops normally use lower power chips for efficiency and battery life — but not the 51m). The processor is upgradeable, which means you can just open up the panel and swap the processor with a better one in the future. Second, the GPU can be upgraded too, either by replacing the onboard graphics module or by using the external Alienware Graphics Amplifier. Considering the top-end specifications, it already has out of the box, these features mean you can stay on the cutting edge with new components without having to change the whole machine.\n\nOur review unit was the top-of-the line configuration with Core i9, 32GB DDR4 RAM and RTX 2080 GPU. As for performance, we got 110fps (frames per second) with games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider and 150+ fps with games like FortNite & Apex Legends. These are the frame rates with graphics settings kept at the maximum possible. There is no other laptop that even comes close to this level of gaming performance. If that’s not enough, you can also overclock the GPU from the included command centre software.\n\nTo complement all that power, you need some serious heat extraction. The Alienware 51m has dual intake and dual exhaust vents, copper heat pipes and copper fin stacks. While the internal fans spin continuously during gaming, they never got reached a level where they were too loud and bothered us. The laptop remained cool to the touch even after an hour of gaming. This kind of efficient and quiet cooling was a big surprise considering the power on tap.\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nHP Spectre Folio review: The convertible laptop screams design and luxury\n\nThe configuration we tested is only available in Lunar White. The colour is beautiful while the coloured backlit accents, keyboard and trackpad give it a futuristic appearance. Trouble is, the white surfaces (top lid, palm rest and the keyboard) tend to collect dust and dirt rather quickly. You should also know that it comes with dual power adapters — it needs a total of 330W of power, so two large adapters are needed. Both adapters are included but that’s a lot of weight to carry around. If you use the laptop with only one adapter, performance is compromised. It’s the same issue when you use the laptop on battery power. Battery life is as expected from a gaming laptop — 3 hours of backup for basic usage which drops down to just over one and half hours for gaming.\n\nThe display is 17.3-inch IPS full HD display with sleek bezels on three sides. What’s more, the display is a 144Hz panel with Nvidia G-Sync support — that’s a massive advantage while gaming. We loved the screen because of the fast refresh rate, excellent viewing angles, vibrant colours and high brightness. Professional photo/video editors might scoff at the 72% colour gamut considering the amount you are paying for the laptop. Personally, we feel that a 4k screen with higher colour gamut should be an option — for those who plan to use it for other intensive tasks.\n\nOn the software front, there are loads of options to play with. The Command Center app lets you customise keyboard macro keys, the power button, lid close action, time to turn of display, sleep as well as lighting effects. Then there is the pointing device setup which lets you control palm rejection, touch pressure, double click speed and gestures. The third handy feature is the Killer Control centre using which you can configure Ethernet and WiFi connectivity (including a Gamefast mode that delivers optimised connectivity while you game).\n\nYou Might Also Like:\n\nMost laptops, desktops vulnerable to cyber attacks through plug-in devices\n\nOther features that impressed us include the magnesium alloy body, loud and clear speakers, dedicated slot for headphones and another headphone/microphone combo jack, the large number of ports at your disposal, WiFi ac, Bluetooth 5.0, and the first of its kind 2.5Gbps Ethernet port for faster connectivity. Special mention goes to the soft touch keyboard which we found to be a lot more comfortable than the usual plastic finish.\n\nThere were a few things that we didn’t like, starting with the HD webcam. Considering the number of people who like to live stream while gaming, the average quality webcam is a big letdown. It’s also unfortunate that there are no gaming accessories provided. A gaming mouse would have been a welcome addition.\n\nIf you want a unique and future ready laptop with top-spec hardware, gorgeous display and design without worrying about what it costs, then the Alienware Area-51m is meant for you. The only other laptop that gives you similar specs is the MSI GT75 Titan which is way more expensive at Rs 3,99,990. The MSI has a 4k screen & 1TB SSD but does not have the hardware upgrade feature.\n\nRead More News on\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nRead More News on\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nAs Zara, H&M swelter over Bangladesh turmoil, this is what India can stitch up\n\nHow HC order on I-Sec delisting will impact class-action suit against ICICI Bank\n\nIndia must protect doctors.
