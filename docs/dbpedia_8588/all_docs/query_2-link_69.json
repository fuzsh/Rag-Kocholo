        "text": "My wishlist for ESO ; AND my personal thoughts\n\nA list of things I'd wish ZOS to improve / add / change\n\n1)Skills\n\n2)Overland\n\n3)Champion Points\n\n4)Replayable content in overland\n\n5)Dungeons\n\n6)Chapter ideas\n\n7)Other\n\nI.Skills:\n\n>>weapons: Polearms, Unarmed, Crossbow\n\n>>Sorc's Twilight - perched animation\n\n>>a skill line - a guild having this - to enable us to increase % gold gain for donating Ornate gear (another gold sink in order to gain more pennies - but over time it would pay off)\n\nII.Overland\n\n>>new skill lines - Adventure (enable climbing, increase flora and fauna harvesting chances)\n\n>>tree climing in Grahtwood / Malabal Tor / Greenshade, etc. (with tall trees)\n\n>>rock climbing in Glenumbra / Rivenspire / Stonefalls, etc. (with tall peaks)\n\n>>restoration of destroyed cities, eg. Satakalaam, Aswala, Gil-Var-Delle, etc. Making them permanently restored, maybe with some traders OR minor quest hubs.\n\n>>a way to make Overland more challenging - for those who want\n\nIII.Champion Points\n\n>>Craft Tree development --> https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/594079/idea-craft-cp-sub-tree-ideas-constant-wip#latest\n\n>>a mount OF CHOICE (eg. horse, senche, quasigryph) for every 1200 CP in respective colours\n\n>>a permanent 10% bonus to gold gain from every source for 900 CP collected on Craft\n\n>> a permanent 5% attack / defence bonus for 900 CP collected on Warfare\n\n>>a permanent 10% bonus to health/stam/mag regen and 5% health/stam/mag increase for 900 CP on Fitness\n\nIV.Replayable content in overland\n\n>>dynamic pocket rifts to Oblivion - eg. to Vaermina's in Stormhaven, Boethiah's in Deshaan, Hircine's in the Rift OR in Bankgorai, etc. to get Daedric Sets relevant to the Prince, something like Oblivion rifts in Blackwood / the Deadlands\n\nV.Dungeons\n\n>>story mode for dungeons - sometimes I don't want to do a dungeon quest with sprinters. They will rush from boss to boss and leave without saying a thing. I'd love to enjoy the time, even though I've done a dungeon many times\n\nVI.Chapter ideas\n\n>>Whiterun + Fields of Regret DLC\n\n>>Winterhold (Winterhold Hold) + Dawnstar (The Pale Hold) DLC\n\n>>Timelines series: Cyrodiil\n\nsome Imperial noble/vagabond - a Tharn - becomes the new emperor, so the claims of Ayrenn, Jorun or Emeric are for naught. Vestige begins the long and arduous process of rebuilding Cyrodiil, 1st in their own alliance, and then as they would along Cadwell's silver and gold.\n\n.\n\n>>Solstheim CH or DLC.\n\n>>Pyandonea - we had some quests WITH Maormer (Summerset, High Isle) - maybe we could meet them there? Poke poke, nudge nudge, wink wink, eh ZOS?\n\n>>Blackmarsh CH or DLC.\n\n>>Akavir CH.\n\n>>Atmora CH.\n\n>>Peryite's Pits DLC.\n\n>>Vaermina's Quagmire DLC.\n\nVII.Other\n\n(the ideas are also inspired by other Forum Users' posts)\n\n>>tracking achievements, eg. in fishing - what type of fish you need, etc.\n\n>>possibility to research traits on Companions' equipment so that we could change the traits\n\n>>pet battles! We collect SO MANY pets, and yet they are just cosmetics. What a HUGE potential lies within those tiny beats!\n\n>>ASOC - a new server in Asia and Oceania. If people have a bad ping there, it would be great if they had a server reaching their places more easily. And hey, it would make THREE servers, not two.\n\n>>highlighting WBs that are being engaged\n\n>>possibility to dye barding\n\n>>possibility to switch UI between guild bank<-->bank<-->guild trader\n\n>>display the dialogue options so that we can see which answer the NPC is reacting to\n\n>>Norg-Tzel - for Mara's sake, ZOS, REMOVE it from the list please!\n\n1) to an extent I'm not surprised why ZOS isn't adding some of the things we're asking about - the golden rule is: \"people don't know what they want THEMSELVES\". Yeah, unless... it's been asked for many times."
