        "text": "Alienware is famous for its powerful hardware and high price. However, you might wonder: Is Alienware worth it? Do you really need an Alienware laptop? To figure it out, MiniTool Partition Wizard puts together its pros and cons in this post. You can also get some alternative laptops to Alienware.\n\nIs Alienware Worth It?\n\nAlienware laptops come from an American computer hardware subsidiary of Dell, Alienware Corporation, a company that is dedicated to producing gaming computers with alien-themed designs. The laptops and desktops from Alienware usually have a special outlook and powerful function.\n\nWhen you are planning to buy an Alienware laptop, you might hesitate due to its price. Is Alienware laptop worth it? Is there any better choice? If you find it hard to decide whether to buy an Alienware laptop, you can read the following contents to get its advantages and disadvantages. You can also compare it with other laptops.\n\nPros\n\nUsers hold different opinions towards Alienware laptops. If you are attracted by its advantages, it might be a good choice for you.\n\nAmazing Performance\n\nMost users choose Alienware due to its high performance. Alienware laptops are designed with powerful components that allow them to run faster and deal with heavy tasks. Let’s see more details.\n\nAlienware laptops are equipped with 10th gen Intel Core i7 or even i9 processor with up to 12-phase HyperEfficient Voltage regulation. This processor enables up to 8-cores and 16-threads of multi-threaded performance, which means these laptops can deal with multiple tasks easily and you can play video games or edit videos quite fluently and smoothly.\n\nThese laptops use Advanced Alienware Cryo-Tech as their thermal technology, which includes a high voltage driving fan, load-balancing heat pipes, dense copper fin stacks, etc. It maintains system stability while performing heavy tasks and makes sure you can get the best user experience during the gameplay.\n\nThey are also designed with incredible display options. Dell provides two types of Alienware laptops: m15 and m17. Alienware m15 offers 300Hz and 144Hz panel options for the rapid refresh rate while Alienware m17 is featured with a standard 360Hz FHD display. If you are a competitive gamer, such a high refresh rate might be wonderful. However, if you don’t play fast-paced games like first-person shooters, the refresh rates higher than 144Hz could be overkill.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that the Alienware laptops provide optional RAID 0 (dual SSD stripe) configurations. In this way, the transfer rates and the storage ability of the hard drives can be maximized. By the way, you can get up to 4TB SSD while you customize an Alienware laptop.\n\nSome users, especially game lovers, would overclock their CPU or GPU to get higher performance. However, it is not easy to overlock a component of a laptop. Improper overclocking is dangerous and could even destroy your computer. The good news is that the new Alienware Command Center is included in Alienware laptops. It contains an easy and intuitive overclocking control module. With this control module, overclocking becomes more safe and easy.\n\nUser-friendly Keyboard and Touchpad\n\nThe keyboard and touchpad of an Alienware laptop are reliable and user-friendly. Its keyboard is featured with optional 4-zone RGB N-Key rollover and anti-ghosting technology. And with the pre-key Alien FX lighting, you can customize each key separately. The new Alienware laptop has a precision-point glass touchpad that could provide a high-quality user experience.\n\nSci-Fi Styling Outlook\n\nIf you prefer the science fiction style, an Alienware laptop should be the best choice for you. Its screen is propped up atop the hinge that locates a bit higher than other laptops. The honeycombed ventilation is combined with ringed RGB lighting and you can also see the RGB lighting on the Alienware logo. These features make Alienware different from any other brands of laptops.\n\nComplete Ports and Slots\n\nMost users would concern available ports and slots while choosing a laptop. The good news is that Alienware laptops have various ports and slots that could meet the needs of most users, such as an SD card reader, 2 super-speed USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-A ports an HDMI port, a Thunderbolt 3port, etc. For more details, you can visit the official website of Dell.\n\nConsiderate Customer Support\n\nIf you have any questions about Alienware, you can contact the Dell support team via email or phone. The Alienware laptops offer 2-year premium support and onsite service. If you need a longer warranty or more services such as collect and return service and in-home hardware service, you can pay extra fees to get them while you are customizing and buy an Alienware laptop.\n\nIn general, the Alienware laptops have the advantages of high performance, user-friendly keyboard, good-looking appearance, complete ports & slots, and considerate customer support. If you are a game lover or you need to do a lot of video rendering tasks, an Alienware laptop should be on your list to buy.\n\nCons\n\nEvery coin has two sides. So does Alienware. Although it has many advantages that attract plenty of users, it also comes with some disadvantages.\n\nOn the one hand, Alienware laptops are quite expensive for common users.\n\nIf you search for gaming laptops on Amazon, you can find that most of them are around $1,628. Some of the gaming laptops are even under $1,000. However, according to Dell, Alienware m15 starts at about $2704. If you want an Alienware m17 with 32GB DDR4 RAM and 1TB SSD, you need to pay $4765.99. Therefore, if you don’t plan to cost much on a laptop, Alienware might not be your first choice.\n\nOn the other hand, Alienware laptops have a thick casing. They are not as slim or light as most non-gaming laptops. For instance, an Alienware m15 R3 weighs 10.88 pounds while common non-gaming laptops are under 5 pounds. So, if you want to travel with your laptop frequently, it might be a little bit inconvenient to take such a heavy laptop.\n\nIs Alienware Overpriced?\n\nIs Alienware Overpriced? People have different ideas. Alienware is so expensive due to its high quality and powerful specifications.\n\nAs mentioned, Alienware laptops have their pros and cons. And different users would make different choices. If you can afford an Alienware laptop and you are OK with its thick casing, you can buy one as you can get high performance and a wonderful user experience. However, if you cannot accept its cons or you don’t require much about the performance, an Alienware laptop might not be suitable for you.\n\nIs Alienware worth it?

If not repartitioned, the computer will have a lot of files, programs, and games saved along with the operating system in the system C drive, affecting your computer performance.\n\nFortunately, you can resize the original partition on your hard drive and create more partitions to avoid the problem when you get your new laptop. In this way, you can category your data by putting different files into different partitions. This operation helps a lot especially when the hard drive is larger than 512GB. Now, let’s see how to do it.\n\nStep 1: Download and install MiniTool Partition Wizard, a professional and reliable disk manager.\n\nTip: If you need to move the data on your old laptop to the new one, you can also use MiniTool Partition Wizard by referring to this post: Transfer Files from Old PC to New PC Windows 10.\n\nMiniTool Partition Wizard DemoClick to Download100%Clean & Safe\n\nStep 2: To avoid data loss, you’d better shrink the system partition with a bootable MiniTool USB flash drive.

Otherwise, the system partition could run out of space in a few months, which would slow down your laptop and decrease the performance.\n\nStep 5: In the pop-up window, drag the slider to shrink the selected partition and spare unallocated space. Then click OK.\n\nStep 6: Right-click the unallocated space and select Create. Then follow the onscreen instructions to configure the new partition and click OK.
