It's not necessarily the stereotypical teen loner playing in his parents' basement. The gaming industry has changed at such an exponential rate in recent years, that the face of gaming has transformed before our eyes, both literally and figuratively. An extensive survey of 5,763 video game players in 11 countries, commissioned by Dell, revealed that today's gamers are quite diverse; from a coworker with two kids, to the woman next to you at the gym, or, most commonly, a spouse, sibling or friend.\n\nThrough online platforms and social media, and fueled by the popularity of esports, the gaming community is ever-expanding while also growing in diversity and inclusiveness.\n\nGone are the days that being called a \"gamer\" is derogatory. According to those surveyed, fewer than one in 10 feel either \"judged,\" \"childish\" or \"embarrassed\" being called a \"gamer\" (8-9% each). Instead, they consider \"gamer\" a positive label and feel \"fun\" (35%), \"cool\" (29%), or \"excited\" (26%) as a result. While some gamers are willing to self-sacrifice to continue gaming, the majority are well-rounded with interests in music, sports, traveling and socializing. The gaming community has also become less of a \"boy's club,\" with only 14% of gamers globally concerned about the gender of their rivals. In general, gamers are welcoming to whomever is behind the computer. When it comes to being matched with rival gamers, culture/ethnicity (8%), political views (7%), and sexual orientation (6%) are for the most part inconsequential to a player. What matters most is the other gamer's skill level (40%).\n\nJoin Alienware and Dell Gaming at E3\n\nDrop by the Dell/Alienware booth (#647 in the South Exhibit Hall) for great demos including Echo Combat, the highly anticipated multiplayer VR game from Ready At Dawn, creators of Echo Arena and Lone Echo.
