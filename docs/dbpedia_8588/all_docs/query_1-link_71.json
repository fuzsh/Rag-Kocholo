        "text": "Dell (Alienware) is kicking off its Back to School Sale with some strong deals on Alienware and Dell gaming laptops and desktops. Some of these deals are already better than the prices we saw during their Black Friday in July Sale. Computers aren't the only items on sale, though. Current generation gaming consoles, monitors, and other electronics hvae also been marked down starting today.\n\nThe Best Dell Back To School Deals\n\nAlienware Aurora R15 RTX 4080 PC for $2299.99\n\nThe RTX 4080 is the second most powerful card on the market. On the AMD front, only the Radeon RX 7900 XTX can keep up (and that's if you ignore DLSS and ray tracing). It's much more powerful than previous generation cards, performing about 50% faster than an RTX 3080 Ti. It also supports DLSS 3.0 (DLSS 2.0 + frame generation), something the RTX 30 series lacks, and that increases the performance gap for games that support it. It's actually only 20%-30% slower than the RTX 4090 while costing hundreds of dollars less. If you're not convinced, check out our RTX 4080 review.\n\nAlienware m16 RTX 4070 Gaming Laptop for $1699.99\n\nThis Alienware m16 laptop comes equipped with a 16\" 2560x1600 QHD+ display, the latest Intel Core i7-13700HX CPU, GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of DDR5-4800MHz RAM and a 1TB SSD. The RTX 4070 mobile GPU performs on par with the RTX 3080. It's a little bit faster than the RTX 3070 Ti.\n\nAlienware m16 RTX 4060 Gaming Laptop for $1449.99\n\nAlternatively you can opt for the RTX 4060 equipped model for about $150 less. Performance-wise, the RTX 4060 mobile GPU sits right in between the RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti.\n\nNew Release: Alienware Aurora R16 Gaming PC from $1749.99\n\nDell just recently put up its new 2023 Alienware Aurora R16 for sale on its site. The facelift is definitely a departure from the familiar Aurora styling we've seen for the past several years. The new R16 chassis is 40% smaller in volume compared to previous iterations. That's a huge size reduction. And yet, Dell states that cooling has improved without a drop in performance. The Aurora R16 does feature a proven airflow design, with large vents on the side panels and a 120mm rear fan drawing air in and a generously sized 240mm all-in-one liquid cooler pushing air out through the top. This new design allows for better airflow to the GPU as well. Dell also claims that this new chassis will run quieter. If they can keep the ambient temps and the components cooler, than that makes sense. Much of PC system noise is due to thermo-controlled fans ramping up as the components heat up.\n\nDell G16 16\" QHD+ RTX 3060 Gaming Laptop for $999.99\n\nFor a laptop priced (well) under $1K, the Dell G16 is very well equipped for gaming. The Intel Core i7-12700H CPU is still one of the best processors out there, and it won't bottleneck the capable RTX 3060 GPU. Speaking of the GPU, it's more powerful than the previous generation's RTX 2070 mobile and supports DLSS 2.0 for even better performance.\n\nAlienware m16 RTX 4080 Gaming Laptop for $2299.99\n\nThis is the lowest price we've seen for the newest Alienware m16 gaming laptop equipped with an RTX 4080 GPU. The mobile RTX 4080 is a ridiculously fast mobile GPU; it absolutely crushes any RTX 30 series mobile GPU. In fact, it's as powerful as an RTX 3080 desktop GPU, which is incredible considering the RTX 3080 desktop GPU is still a very relevant card with the chops to run most games at 4K at 60+fps. It's paired with the latest and greatest AMD Ryzen 9 7845HX CPU and a whopping 32GB of RAM.\n\nAlienware x17 R2 17\" Intel Core i9-12900H RTX 3080 Ti Laptop for $1750\n\nThe Alienware X-series gaming laptops are newer, thinner, and lighter redesigns of the traditional M-series laptops. These are the thinnest Alienware laptops ever and they compete in build quality, dimensions, and performance to other high-end ultra-thin laptops like the Razer Blade. The GeForce RTX 3080 Ti is still an awesome GPU that ample amounts of power to easily handle games on the display's 1080p resolution. That's great since the display can handle refresh rates of up to 480Hz. Compared to the newer generation RTX 4000 series GPUs, it's closest in performance to the RTX 4070.\n\nDell Back to School Gaming PC Deals\n\nRTX 40 Series PCs\n\nDell Back to School Gaming Laptop Deals\n\nRTX 40 Series Laptops\n\nRTX 30 Series Laptops\n\nDell Back to School Monitors and Electronics Deals\n\n34\" Alienware AW3423DWF QD OLED Gaming Monitor for $999.99\n\nThe Alienware AW3423DWF is Dell's flagship QD OLED gaming monitor. This 34\" monitor sports a 3440x1440 WQHD resolution with a 1ms response time and 165Hz refresh rate. It uses a Samsung quantum dot OLED panel; quantum dot technology produces higher peak brightness levels compared to traditional OLED TVs without losing the color accuracy and range and wide viewing angles that OLEDs are known for. The QD-OLED panel also boasts a 99.3% DCI-P3 color range and is factory calibrated with a Delta E less than 2. It is HDR True Black 400 certified (which, by the way, is a higher rating than even HDR1400) and boasts up to 1,000nits of peak brightness.\n\nFor more deals:"
