        "text": "Ok, so I got asked this question today as I gave a user a quote for a high end Dell computer for block modelling.\n\n“Is there any reason why we only have Dell PCs onsite, why do you buy us Dell computers instead of building them for cheaper from PCCaseGear?!”\n\nI was kind of thrown back by this question…\n\nApart from the seemingly obvious reasons to me… Warranty, Support, OEM packages, our supplier has partnership (or whatever it’s called) with Dell, so cheaper bids and good prices, I couldn’t really answer in a manner that convinced him that what i was doing was “right” for the company.\n\nHave any of you had similar scenarios or reasons as to why you buy ready made systems, or build your own…\n\nI work for a small/medium sized company with around 200 workstations/laptops.\n\nCheers Spiceheads.\n\np.s pretty sure i put this in wrong category sorry.\n\nI got this question today!! I told him\n\nA: The amount of hours/days you take to build it factors into the cost of the machine as well as the time of lost productivity for you and the person who is down.\n\nB: Why spin your wheels on it when you can have another up and running and you can move onto other projects that can help the company even more?\n\nWe had Dells at one of my jobs. Best support we ever got. Of course, we paid for it, but hey, we do what’s in the best interest of the company. Got to spend some money to make more money. While custom made computers can be great, streamlined (not consumer but pro) PCs and hardware make it much easier and faster to get things done.\n\nYou should tell him that he is welcome to come up with a proposal for his idea and take it to the boss.\n\nSupport - I’ve always gotten NBD onsite 3 years, and people are still impressed by it. That also includes things like re-imaging, Dell provides a single CAB file for every system, so I just import that to MDT and it’s ready. That’d be a lot harder with a custom build.\n\nSpeaking of re-imaging, a DIY build means you have to pay $200 for Windows on top of hardware and track that stuff. With a Dell (or HP, or whatever), it’s included and I don’t have to worry about it.\n\nEasy… Tell them… Server X has a PERC Controller card, those are not going to be found at your local Office Depot, by using Dell we can get a replacement card sent to us within hours and pretty much certain it is the right part for a easy switcharoo and back in business. Downtime is minimal, and your not pulling a card out and trying to figure out which kind it is and then calling around for the part etc which could take hours.\n\nYou mentioned some: Warranty, Support, packages and deals. Plus it’s less work and faster deployment for your IT dept.\n\nAnd let’s say you build your own workstations with different brands parts and there’s an incompatibility issue, who you gonna call?.. Hint: Ghostbusters won’t help you at all…\n\nOn a side note: With Dell you may also look into leasing instead of buying. Computers are business assets that decrease in value over time, many times it would be more cost effective leasing them.\n\nYour user needs to go read up on “Total Cost of Ownership”. Even if you can get the parts for cheaper than the assembled system (which I doubt), that doesn’t factor in build cost, ongoing support, warranty, etc. that others have mentioned. You might save a little bit of cash up front (if so, probably not very much) but your savings will be gobbled up in a hurry by the additional effort involved in handling all that other stuff.\n\nIn my younger, more foolish days I had a brief period where I chose to build rather than buy. I soon realized that building is great if you’re a hobbyist or a gamer, or if you have some very specific business requirements. But for the vast majority of businesses who just need basic productivity PC’s to run their office apps, you’re better off to buy than to build.\n\nFactor in that they have to pay your wage while you’re researching, ordering and then building it and all of the sudden it isn’t such a huge difference in cost.\n\nWe used to have issues occasionally with our HP computers and it was super easy to call HP with the diagnostic failure code and have someone at my office the next day replacing x part and were in operation again. Took 5 minutes of my time and they are up and running again. That is what we are paying for."
