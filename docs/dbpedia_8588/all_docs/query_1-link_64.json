        "text": "Alienware is a name that has defined some of the most exciting and powerful gaming laptops we have seen. Whether it's the design or the performance, Alienware laptops have always been 'the' machine to flaunt your gamer credentials. Earlier this year, Dell introduced its updated Alienware lineup in India with the latest Nvidia RTX series graphics. While the Alienware m15 didn't change much, it was the mighty Area-51m that grabbed more attention than anyone.\n\nDebuted earlier this year, the Alienware Area-51m is Dell's idea of an uncompromised gaming laptop in 2019. This is an extreme laptop in every sense - right from its humongous starting price of Rs 2,53,890 to the ultimate specifications you can find in a laptop. Yes, it falls in the same category as those bulky laptops from other players but Dell has worked to make it more modern in its approach. This is a laptop you can upgrade like a desktop - something that gamers love on their machines.\n\nBut does the Alienware Area-51m make sense? Is excess of everything good in this case?\n\nA design to please the extraterrestrials\n\nAlienware laptops have always worn a very spaceship-inspired design for a long time. And needless, an Alienware is instantly recognizable in a sea of RGB flaunting gaming laptops from other brands. At the launch event, representatives from Alienware said that with the Area-51m, they wanted to do a more modern design but one that is instantly recognizable. Is it the case?\n\nThe Alienware Area-51m looks and feels every bit an Alienware laptop - there's no doubt about that especially when you look at all the illuminated alien logos. I have never seen a laptop that can be booted up with an illuminated alien-shaped power button - this makes it out-of-the-world cool. I don't know about other gamers but every time I get to press an Alien-shaped button to start my laptop, it makes me jump like a gorilla.\n\nIn fact, this is one of the very few gaming laptops I have seen that balances between outright lunacy and sophistication for its design. At times, the Area-51m impresses with its sheer grand white paint job with minimal graphics. It's a very clean design with only the Area-51m logo coming as a sticker job. Why don't other companies do such minimal designs for their gaming laptops?\n\nAnd when you focus on the lunatic part, the Area-51m gives goals to other gaming laptops. Dell has used an LED light strip around the massive rear vents and kept the edges mostly black. In fact, this is the only place you will see RGB lighting on the body, apart from the RGB Alien logo. By default, these glow neon blue and when you see this in the dark - ah my God! I am short of words to describe the feeling but I have always found myself jumping around the laptop in excitement.\n\nMore excitement comes when you open the lid and the same neon blue illumination glows underneath the keyboard and the trackpad. Yes, the trackpad is also backlit - RGB heaven!\n\nOkay, keeping my utter excitement side, the Alienware Area-51m has a massive keyboard deck to accommodate the 17-inch display. Due to a massive screen, you get a full-size keyboard with a reasonably big trackpad and an array of customisable function keys to the left. The white interiors do liven up the looks and the RGB backlighting on the keyboard makes it look exquisite.\n\nThe screen has slim bezels than usual but there's a fat bottom chin. Alienware justifies that with the Tobii Eye Tracker neatly positioned under the screen. At the back, the rear heat vents with hexagonal pattern have been designed in a way to that it looks likes boosters from a Star Wars spaceship.\n\nThere's no doubt that the Alienware Area-51m looks unearthly and for gamers, there cannot be anything better. However, there's no denying that this is a bulky laptop weighing 3.87Kg - lighter in its class due to the magnesium alloy chassis but heavy nonetheless. And, it is extremely difficult to carry it around on a daily basis given its thickness.\n\nWhen it comes to connectivity, the Area-51m covers all the essentials: Dual DC Power Inputs, RJ45 Port, 2 SuperSpeed USB 3.1 Type-A Ports, SuperSpeed USB 3.1 Type-A Port with Powershare Technology, 1 Thunderbolt 3 USB Type-C, 1 Alienware Graphics Amplifier Port, 1 HDMI 2.0 Output with HDCP 2.2 Output Port, 1 Mini-Display 1.4 Output Port (supports NVIDIA G-SYNC), 1 Headphone/MIC Retaskable Jack and 1 Global Headset Jack.\n\nNice display but it could have been better\n\nWhen it comes to gaming, the fun multiplies by the size of the display you are playing it on. Dell is offering as standard a 17-inch Full HD IPS LCD display with a refresh rate of 144Hz. The display supports Nvidia's G-Sync and accompanies the Tobii Eye Tracker below. When compared to any other gaming laptop, the screen is quite good with its vibrant colours and high contrasts. The viewing angles are wide while the anti-glare coating cuts out the reflections. With the 144Hz refresh rate, things look quite smooth while playing any game.\n\nHowever, this is Dell's flagship gaming laptop and I was interested to see a 4K display with a higher refresh rate. Dell says such a display doesn't exist yet but when you are spending close to Rs 3 lakhs on a laptop, you expect the best. Maybe a smaller 15-inch version with 240Hz refresh rate could do the trick.\n\nThis one can chew through anything you throw at it\n\nYes, and I am not exaggerating. The reason for the Alienware Area-51m's hefty body is that it packs in serious computing hardware. My review unit came as standard with a 9th Gen Intel Core i9-9900K processor with TurboBoost facility of up to 5GHz. To acknowledge it, Dell is offering up to 32GB RAM DDR4 RAM and for storage, you get as standard 512GB PCIe M.2 SSD along with 1TB (+8GB SSHD) Hybrid Drive. The top-end model comes equipped with an Nvidia RTX 2080 GPU with 6GB DDR6 RAM.\n\nDell has designed the Alienware Area-51m in a way that it can be upgraded later. Hence, it is easy to open the laptop and fit in your upgraded components manually. However, while Dell claims that it's upgradeable like a desktop computer, you will have to buy them from Dell as the laptop uses a custom port. Also, if Nvidia changes the design for next year's chip, it will be interesting to see how Dell optimizes that for the Alienware Area-51m.\n\nNonetheless, this is a gaming laptop and it impresses highly in this regard. The Alienware Area-51m is effortlessly powerful and can deal with anything you throw at it. I was able to download a game from Steam in the background and play Wolfenstein Youngblood at the same time without any noticeable drop in performance. Throughout my time with it, I played a couple of latest titles such as F1 2019, Project Cars 2, Wolfenstein Youngblood, Watch Dogs 2 and PUBG (of course). And with all these games, the Alienware Area-51m was like - hey bro, is that all you can do? All these were running at the highest graphics settings with the frame rates never dipping below 70-80 fps.\n\nWith the Tobii Eye Tracker, certain racing games become more immersive. In F1 2019, the eye tracker was extremely accurate and it never lost its accuracy even when I was vehemently looking around the screen.\n\nThe massive vents at the back hide an efficient cooling system and when the laptop is under stress, the system ensures that the laptop is working at its peak without getting tired.\n\nThe keyboard is well suited for gaming but I would have preferred some feedback for the keys to add into the experience. The trackpad is good but the glossy surface somehow opposes the finger movement and you often have to do a few more swipes to get something done. As a general laptop, this isn't the most comfortable setup to do any typing or web browsing. And it's best used when have it set up as a desktop.\n\nAudio quality is decent but more oomph would be better\n\nLaptop speakers have always been 'meh' except for a few flagship models. The best one I have seen so far in a laptop was the Asus Zephyrus S earlier this year. The Alienware Area-51m has good speakers but not as good as the ones from the Asus laptop. The speakers are have detailed mids and crisp highs but there's absolutely no bass. At times, you will have to plug-in an external speaker.\n\nBattery life? You should carry the charger with you\n\nGaming laptops have never impressed in battery life and nothing changes with the Alienware Area-51m. The 90WHr battery under normal workloads may last up to 3 hours at a stretch. Therefore, you should always carry the adapters if you need to do the usual \"Alienware things.\" Yes, you read it right, there are two adapters to keep it powered up. To get the maximum performance, you will have to plug-in both the adapters. However, I managed to plug just one and it was still running fine.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you have made it through the entire piece, it is evident that the Alienware Area-51m is a hardcore gaming laptop for serious gamers. When you seek performance, this laptop will ensure that nothing comes in its way to serve the games in the way they were meant to. The impressive cooling system doesn't let the laptop become an oven after an hour of gaming. The display is good but it could have been better given that this carries an exorbitant price tag.\n\nHowever, the biggest draw for me is the way it looks. Alienware has done a fantastic job of making a bulky gaming laptop look like something from the space. Gaming laptops need power but a great design along with generous use of RGB lighting elevates the overall experience. The Alienware Area-51m makes you feel special every time you sit down for your gaming sessions. It indeed delivers the all-round gaming experience and at a starting price of Rs 2,53,990, it is difficult to find a better gaming laptop than this."
