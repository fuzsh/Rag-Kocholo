Strong midrange features such as a Ryzen 7 7800X3D and RTX 4070 Super will give you plenty of oomph and 32GB of RAM should help you breeze through those productivity tasks.\n\nIf you’re looking for something that’s even more budget friendly, look no further than the Skytech Chronos for $180 off also on BestBuy. Sporting a Ryzen 5 5600X CPU and RTX 4060 GPU you’ll get solid budget gaming performance for a price that won’t break the bank.\n\nBest mainstream desktop computer deals\n\nIdeaCentre Tower, Core i5-14400/8GB RAM/256GB SSD, $564.99 (16% off on Lenovo)\n\nHP Slim Desktop, Core i5-14400/16GB RAM/512GB SSD, $529.99 (24% off on HP)\n\nInspiron Desktop, Core i7-13700/RTX 3050/16GB RAM/1TB SSD, $949.99 (25% off on Dell)\n\nApple Mac Mini 2023, M2 Pro/16GB RAM/512GB SSD, $1,149.99 (12% off on Amazon with coupon)\n\nMy top picks:\n\nLenovo machines are known for their design and reliability and the IdeaCentre line of desktops is no exception. Right now, Lenovo is offering the IdeaCentre Tower for $115 off on its website. Complete with a solid budget Core i5-14400 CPU, this would make a fine home office computer or general browsing machine.\n\nIf you’re more of a Mac fan, then there is a rare deal on an M2 Mac Mini for $150 off with a coupon on Amazon. The M2 Pro is still a solid CPU and considering, if rumors are true, the M4 Mac Mini isn’t set to be released until later this year, it’s the perfect time to buy the older version at a discount — you’ll still get a great mini desktop without the exorbitant price of a new-gen Apple product.\n\nBest all-in-one computer deals\n\nAll-in-one desktop computers combine a PC’s hardware with a modern display to make a desktop computer that has both form and function. Since everything is built together, you can save precious desktop space with an all-in-one. They make capable work computers and they can also be excellent home computers with the wide range of features appealing to the whole family.\n\nInspiron AiO 24, Core 7-150U/16GB RAM/1TB SSD/24-inch 1080p touch display, $799.99 (27% off on BestBuy)\n\nYoga AiO 9i, Core i9-13900H/16GB RAM/1TB SSD/31.5-inch 4K display, $1,599.99 (14% off on Lenovo)\n\nAsus Zen AiO 24, Ryzen 7 5825U/16GB RAM/512GB SSD/24-inch 1080p touch display, $779.99 (32% off on Amazon)\n\niMac M3 2023, M3/8GB RAM/256GB SSD/24-inch 5K display, $1,149.00 (12% off on Amazon)\n\nMy top picks:\n\nTouchscreen fans look no further than the HP AiO 27 deal for $300 on BestBuy. Strong budget performance features plus a nifty 24-inch 1080p touch display make this a standout all-in-one deal.\n\nAlternatively, Lenovo is offering its big beautiful Yoga AiO 9i for $280 off on its website. The company’s flagship all-in-one packs a gorgeous 31.5-inch 4K display and its powered by a robust Core i9-13900H. Plus, you’ll get the quality and reliability of a Lenovo machine."
