In his mid-20s Tammet was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome, which gifted him with an incredible intelligent and uncommon perception of the world.

As the creator of Optimnem, an online entity that provides language learning instruction, Tammet possesses a vast knowledge of technology and learning strategies. Prior to this, he taught English in Lithuania and later participated in the World Memory Championships.\n\nAs an author, Tammet published his New York Times bestselling memoir 'Born On A Blue Day,' a factual novel that explores his life as a high-functioning individual with autistic savant syndrome. He is set to release a new book 'Embracing the Wide Sky: A Tour Across the Horizons of the Mind.' He was also the subject of the award-winning documentary 'Brainman' and was featured on '60 Minutes' and 'ABC News.' In conjunction with this, Tammet's work appeared in the 'New York Times' and 'International Herald Tribune.'\n\nThrough attempting to make audiences understand how he sees and perceives the world, Daniel Tammet's speeches examines how initial awareness can effect overall interpretation."
