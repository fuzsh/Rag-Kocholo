Yet, to his ears, the English language was an alien language.\n\nWords and sentences were a puzzle the young boy could not figure out. Daniel was an autistic savant. He was a self-confessed misfit in a world of words. He was also a mathematical genius. Daniel felt, thought, and dreamed in a private language of numbers.\n\nDaniel remembers receiving a book on counting when he was four. Where others saw numbers, he saw images. To Daniel’s mind, each number had a shape, a color, and a texture of its own. Neurologists call this condition synesthesia. For example, 89 meant ‘snow’ to Daniel, and the number six meant ‘sadness.’\n\nDaniel explained, “When I multiply numbers together, I see two shapes. The image starts to change and evolve, and a third shape emerges.”\n\nDaniel’s language was unique, but he had no way of sharing it. The young boy felt isolated from the other children at school. He felt intimidated by their strange language.\n\nDaniel didn’t know how to connect with other children. He said, “We spoke differently, thought differently. The other children hadn’t the faintest idea (how could they?). I didn’t dare approach them and attempt to strike up a conversation. Besides, I did not know what a conversation sounded like.”\n\nWhile the other children played football, Daniel would stand and count the leaves on trees.\n\nFriendless and frustrated, Daniel hatched a plan. He would master the English language through his talent for numbers. He began reading non-stop.\n\nDaniel made lists of words according to their shape, texture, and number. Some words such as gobble, cupboard, and cabbage were round, like the number three. Other words such as jacket, wife, and quick were pointy, like the number four. And words such as kingdom, shoemaker, and surrounded were shimmering to Daniel.\n\nDaniel eventually mastered the English language. By the time he left school, he was fluent in French and German as well.\n\nHe has since written a best-selling book about his trials and tribulations.\n\nDaniel is now creating his own language. It’s called Mänti. Its influences are the vowel and image-rich languages of northern Europe.\n\nFrom struggling to learn languages, Daniel can now learn new languages in record time. He used his mastery of numbers to master languages. He is now fluent in over ten different languages.\n\nYet he still loves numbers. “It sounds silly, but numbers are my friends,” he said.\n\nNumbers helped Daniel make sense of the world. But it was language which gave him the tools to share those beautiful insights.\n\nRead More:\n\nA Genius Explains"
