        "text": "A journey into one of the most fascinating minds alive today—guided by the owner himself.\n\nBestselling author Daniel Tammet (Thinking in Numbers) is virtually unique among people who have severe autistic disorders in that he is capable of living a fully independent life and able to explain what is happening inside his head.\n\nHe sees numbers as shapes, colors, and textures, and he can perform extraordinary calculations in his head. He can learn to speak new languages fluently, from scratch, in a week. In 2004, he memorized and recited more than 22,000 digits of pi, setting a record. He has savant syndrome, an extremely rare condition that gives him the most unimaginable mental powers, much like those portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the film Rain Man.\n\nFascinating and inspiring, Born on a Blue Day explores what it's like to be special and gives us an insight into what makes us all human—our minds."
