        "text": "Born : 31 January 1979 (age 33) - London, England\n\nOccupation : Writer, educator\n\nDaniel Tammet (born on 31 January 1.979) is a British writer.\n\nHis best selling 2.006 memoir, Born On A Blue Day, about his life with high-functioning autism and savant syndrome, was named a \"Best Book for Young Adults\" in 2.008 by the American Library Association.\n\nTammet's second book, Embracing the Wide Sky, was named one of France's best selling books of 2.009 by L'Express magazine in its March 2.010 edition.\n\nTammet's books have been published in 20 languages.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nTammet was born Daniel Paul Corney and raised in East London, England, the eldest of nine children.\n\nHe suffered epileptic seizures as a young child, which he subsequently outgrew following medical treatment.\n\nAt age twenty-five, he would eventually be diagnosed with Asperger syndrome by Professor Simon Baron-Cohen of the Autism (Spectrum) Research Centre at Cambridge University.\n\nTammet is one of fewer than a hundred \"prodigious savants\" according to Dr. Darold Treffert, the world's leading researcher in the study of savant syndrome.\n\nTammet finished school with nine GCSEs (an 'A*' in History, 'A' grades in English, English Literature, French, and German, two 'B' grades in the Sciences, a 'B' in Maths, having obtained an 'A' in his preliminary Maths exam, and a 'C' in Woodwork) and three A-Levels in History, French and German, all at grade 'B'.\n\nPreferring travel to university, Tammet taught English for a year in Lithuania.\n\nTammet twice participated (in 1.999, and 2.000) under his birth name in the World Memory Championships in London.\n\nPlacing 12th in 1.999, and 4th in 2.000, behind a trio of present and future 'World Memory Champions'.\n\nHe changed his birth name by deed poll because \"it didn't fit with the way he saw himself.\"\n\nIn 2.002 Tammet launched his website, Optimnem.\n\nThe site offers language courses (currently French and Spanish) and has been an approved member of the U.K.'s National Grid for Learning since 2.006.\n\nSavantism\n\nTammet's memory, mathematical and linguistic abilities have been studied by some of the world's leading neuroscientists at California's Center for Brain Studies and the UK's Cambridge Autism Research Centre and have been the subject of several peer-reviewed scientific papers.\n\nProfessor Allan Snyder at the Australian National University has said of Tammet: \"Savants can't usually tell us how they do what they do.\n\nIt just comes to them. Daniel can describe what he sees in his head.\n\nThat's why he's exciting. He could be the 'Rosetta Stone'.\"\n\nTammet's unusually vivid and complex synesthesia has been widely reported.\n\nIn his mind, he says, each positive integer up to 10,000 has its own unique shape, colour, texture and feel.\n\nHe can intuitively \"see\" results of calculations as synaesthetic landscapes without using conscious mental effort and can \"sense\" whether a number is prime or composite.\n\nHe has described his visual image of 289 as particularly ugly, 333 as particularly attractive, and pi as beautiful. The number 6 apparently has no distinct image yet what he describes as an almost small nothingness, opposite to the number 9 which he calls large and towering.\n\nTammet has described 25 as energetic and the \"kind of number you would invite to a party\".\n\nTammet not only verbally describes these visions, but has also created artwork, including a watercolour painting of pi.\n\nTammet holds the European record for reciting pi from memory to 22,514 digits in five hours and nine minutes on 14 March 2004.\n\nTammet's record currently ranks 6th in the world.\n\nTammet states in Born On A Blue Day that he speaks ten languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Finnish, Lithuanian, Romanian, Icelandic, Welsh, and Esperanto.\n\nHe learned conversational Icelandic in one week, which he demonstrated in a live television interview conducted entirely in the language.\n\nSegments of the interview showing Tammet responding to questions in Icelandic were shown in a documentary film entitled (in the UK) The Boy with the Incredible Brain, first broadcast on the British television station Channel Five on 23 May 2.005.\n\nSegments of the interview were also televised on 28th January 2.007 edition of the CBS news magazine, 60 Minutes.\n\nThe British documentary showed Tammet meeting Kim Peek, a world famous savant.\n\nPeek was shown hugging Tammet telling him that \"Some day you will be as great as I am,\" to which Tammet replied, \"That was a wonderful compliment; what an aspiration to have!\".\n\nCareer\n\nBorn On A Blue Day, Tammet's memoir of a life with Asperger's syndrome, received international media attention and critical praise.\n\nBooklist's Ray Olson stated that Tammet's autobiography was \"as fascinating as Benjamin Franklin's and John Stuart Mill's\" and that Tammet wrote \"some of the clearest prose this side of Hemingway\".\n\nKirkus stated that the book \"transcends the disability memoir genre\".\n\nOther reviewers praised Tammet for his \"elegant,\" \"eloquent,\" and \"engaging\" style.\n\nFor his U.S. book tour, he appeared on several television and radio talk shows and specials, including 60 Minutes and Late Show with David Letterman.\n\nIn February 2.007 Born on a Blue Day was serialised as BBC Radio 4's Book of the Week in the United Kingdom.\n\nTammet's second book, Embracing the Wide Sky, was published in 2.009.\n\nProfessor Allan Snyder, director of Sydney University's Centre for the Mind, called the work 'an extraordinary and monumental achievement'.\n\nTammet argues that savant abilities should not be seen as \"supernatural\" or computer-like but as \"an outgrowth\" of normal brain functioning and \"natural, instinctive ways of thinking about numbers and words\", which suggests that affected brains might be at least partially retrained and that normal brains might be taught to develop or retain some savant abilities.\n\nIn other people blue is connected with sadness for example, but when you think about it sadness is an abstract concept so why is it blue, why not green or yellow?\n\nIt makes no more logical sense for sadness to be blue than for four to be blue.\n\nSo there are certain connections, certain concepts in everyone's brain that are connected that way and mine just takes it to a whole other level.\n\nTammet was among the invited speakers at the TED2.011 'Rediscovery of Wonder' conference in Long Beach, California.\n\nScientific study\n\nTammet's abilities have been examined in several scientific investigations.\n\nAfter the World Memory Championships, Tammet participated in a group study of several superior memorisers later published in the New Year 2.003 edition of Nature Neuroscience.\n\nThe researchers investigated the reasons for the memorisers' superior performance.\n\nThey reported that the superior memorisers used \"strategies for encoding information with the sole purpose of making it more memorable\", and concluded that superior memory was not driven by exceptional intellectual ability or differences in brain structure.\n\nIn another study, Simon Baron-Cohen and others at the Autism Research Centre at the University of Cambridge tested Tammet's abilities in around 2.005.\n\nHe was found to have synaesthesia according to the \"Test of Genuineness-Revised\" which tests the subjects' consistency in reporting descriptions of their synaesthesia.\n\nHe performed well on tests of short term memory (with a digit span of 11.5, where 6.5 is typical).\n\nConversely, test results showed his memory for faces appeared to be impaired, and he scored at the level expected of a 6-8 year old child in this task.\n\nThe authors speculated that Tammet's savant memory could be a result of synaesthesia combined with Asperger syndrome, while noting that mnemonic strategies (such as the method of loci) could also explain savant memory abilities.\n\nBaron-Cohen, Bor and Billington investigated whether his synaesthesia and Aspergers syndrome explained his savant memory abilities in a further study published in Neurocase in 2.008.\n\nThe authors state that the memory training used by other experts does not explain his abilities, as he had not had explicit training.\n\nThey concluded that his abilities might be explained by hyperactivity in one brain region (the left prefrontal cortex), which results from his Aspergers syndrome and synaesthesia.\n\nOn the Navon task, relative to non-autistic controls, Tammet was found to be faster at finding a target at the local level and to be less distracted by interference from the global level.\n\nIn an fMRI scan, Tammet did not activate extra-striate regions of the brain \"normally associated with synaesthesia\", suggesting that he has an \"unusual and more abstract and conceptual form of synaesthesia\".\n\nPublished in Cerebral Cortex (2.011), another fmRI study by Professor Jean-Michel Hupé and others at the Centre de Recherche Cerveau and Cognition at the University of Toulouse observed no activation of color areas in ten synaesthetes.\n\nHupé suggests that synaesthetic color experience lies not in the brain's color system, but instead results from \"a complex construction of meaning in the brain, involving not only perception, but language, memory and emotion\".\n\nIn his book Moonwalking with Einstein (2.011), former US Memory Champion Joshua Foer speculates that study of conventional mnemonic approaches has played a role in Tammet's feats of memory, while accepting that Tammet meets the standard definition of a prodigious savant.\n\nIn a review of his book for The New York Times, psychologist Alexandra Horowitz described Foer's speculation as among the book's few \"missteps\" and his decision to devote space to the case of a \"renowned savant\" such as Tammet \"inexplicable,\" questioning whether it would matter if he had used such strategies or not.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTammet met his first partner, software engineer Neil Mitchell, in 2.000.\n\nTammet lived with him in Kent, where they had a quiet regimented life at home with their cats, preparing meals from their garden.\n\nTammet and Mitchell operated the online e-learning company Optimnem, where they created and published language courses.\n\nTammet now lives with a new partner, Jérôme Tabet, a French photographer whom he met while promoting his autobiography.\n\nAlthough he has said that he did not think he would be here if it were not for the love and support of Mitchell, more recently he noted that he used to live a rigid existence aimed at calming his many anxieties .\n\n\"I was very happy, but it was a small happiness\" whereas now, as the subtitle of Embracing the Wide Sky : A tour across the horizons of the mind asserts, he believes that we ought to seek to liberate our brains a belief reflected in his new life :\n\nMy life used to be very simple and regimented but since then I have travelled constantly and given lots of lectures and it just changed me...\n\nIt made me much more open, much more interested in, I guess, the full potential of what my mind could do...\n\nBecause of that change I grew and in a sense I grew
