        "text": "Daniel Tammet (born 31 January 1979) is an English essayist, novelist, poet, translator, and autistic savant. His memoir, Born on a Blue Day (2006), is about his early life with Asperger syndrome and savant syndrome, and was named a \"Best Book for Young Adults\" in 2008 by the American Library Association's Young Adult Library Services magazine.\n\nQuotes\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn on a Blue Day (2006)\n\n[edit]\n\nMy algebra was relatively poor. I found it very difficult to use equations that substituted numbers — to which I had a synesthetic and emotional response — for letters, to which I had none. It was because of this that I decided not to continue math at Advanced level, but chose to study history, French and German instead.\n\nChapter 6: Adolescence.\n\nI had eventually come to understand that friendship was a delicate, gradual process that mustn't be rushed or seized upon but allowed and encouraged to take its course over time. I pictured it as a butterfly, simultaneously beautiful and fragile, that once afloat belonged to the air and any attempt to grab at it would only destroy it.\n\nChapter 8: Falling in Love.\n\nBookreview by Jim Withers, Canwest News Service, June 8 2009\n\n[edit]\n\nMy relationship with scientists has changed. Now, they consider me more of a peer than a guinea pig, and I'm part of the scientific discussion.\n\nWhen someone asks me, \"Do you speak Breton or Inuktitut?\" I say, \"Not yet.\"\n\nWikipedia has an article about:\n\nABC News: Excerpt: \"Born on a Blue Day\"\n\nOptimnem: The Official Website of Daniel Tammet"
