        "text": "I recited Pi to 22,514 decimal points in five hours and nine minutes. I was able to do this because of weeks of study, aided by the unusual synaesthesic way my mind perceives numbers as complex multidimensional coloured and textured shapes. I was able to visualise the digits in my mind's eye as a beautiful rolling numerical panorama, with prime numbers as signposts.\n\nI have never played the lottery in my life and never will. Voltaire described lotteries as a tax on stupidity. More specifically, I think, on innumeracy.\n\nSix is the hardest number for me to experience, the smallest. It's the absence of something - it's cold, dark, almost like a black hole. If someone tells me they are depressed I might imagine myself in the hole of a six to help me empathise. But 16 is a pretty number. I think this is because of its relationship to two, which I see as a drifting motion right to left. Sixteen is two times two times two times two, and I feel that automatically gives it beauty.\n\nSince a teenager I have made a point of tracking down and collecting every single song and out-take of them the Carpenters ever recorded. An amazing voice, and very tragic in a way.\n\nI feel love for language; I learn and speak numerous languages as much for their beauty as their utility. If there was someone else I could speak a dozen languages with, it would enrich the conversation because we could switch and mix, tap into and weave between different dimensions within the different ones. I've got no one I can do that with but I explore the connections myself.\n\nThere are estimated to be fewer that 50 prodigious savants worldwide. If we were brought together it would be disappointing in the sense of us having different abilities. One thing that would make me feel united with them would be the sense of us having grown up in isolation.\n\nIt is wrong that savants are portrayed as being like super computers. All computers operate according to algorithms, but I think minds work in a much more intuitive way.\n\nSome scientists say that one day we won't need bodies, that our brains will be uploaded. But I believe our bodies are an important part of how we think between our ears. Gestures give people the ability to express themselves and to break down thoughts and give shape to them.\n\nWittgenstein wondered whether there could be a language private to one person and said no. For years I have invented a language private to me. It is rich in compound words, like vantool - toilet, literally \"water chair\". I use it to think and reflect personally, privately.\n\nWhen you've missed the bus in Lithuanian you say rapuze - it means toad and is their word for \"damn it\" or worse. It's been a long time since I've spoken much Lithuanian, but still today, whatever language I'm using, I'll say: \"Ahh, rapuze!\"\n\nOne of the great mysteries is why people are often their own worst enemies. It's always confused me and it's at the heart of religion as well. I consider myself an optimist about humanity.\n\nWhen I met Kim Peek, the real-life inspiration behind Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man, he told me: \"One day you'll be as great as me.\" I think he meant: \"Don't just sit in your house doing sums - share it.\" I don't mean to be big headed, but it says in the Bible: \"To whom much is given, much is expected.\" I know I've been blessed with a special mind and I want to share it.\n\nGenius is not due to some quirk of the brain - it is the result of far more chaotic, dynamic and essentially human qualities such as perseverance, imagination, intuition and even love."
