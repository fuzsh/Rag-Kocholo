        "text": "The first language Daniel Tammet studied was English. Where other children in east London, where Tammet grew up, picked up their mother tongue instinctively, he strove to understand how to converse naturally and how to interact with other native speakers.\n\nIt was a long, gruelling challenge, and he discovered what lay behind his linguistic and social difficulties only many years later when he was diagnosed with a form of autism. To the medics, it was a handicap; from a literary perspective, it was an asset.\n\nTammet’s struggle for everyday conversation in English masked a gift for languages that helped to turn him into a bestselling writer with an eye for the detail that separates good authors from bad."
