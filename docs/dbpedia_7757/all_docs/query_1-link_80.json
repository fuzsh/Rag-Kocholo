A 2007 poll of 4,000 Britons named him as one of the world’s “100 living geniuses.” His last book, the New York Times bestseller Born on a Blue Day: Inside the Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant, has been translated into 18 languages and will soon be available in Romanian (AHA Books collection from Help Autism).\n\nTitlu prezentare: Born On A Blue Day: Inside My Extraordinary Mind of an Autistic Savant\n\nDaniel Tammet is unique among the people who confront themselves with the challenges of autism in the sense that he is able to live an independent life and explain what happens in his mind.\n\nHe sees numbers, words and colors as 3D objects, colors and textures and he performs complex mathematical calculations in his head. He can learn a new language in one week and actually he speaks 11 languages. He was diagnosed with savant syndrome, a very rare condition that gives him super brain powers like those portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man.\n\nBorn on a blue day is a fascinating and full of inspiration book that explores the implications of being special and offers us insights of what makes us human – our minds. His presence at the ABA International Conference will be an extraordinary occasion to go on a live dialogue with him."
