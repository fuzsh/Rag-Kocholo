        "text": "Daniel Tammet, 33, is a high-functioning autistic savant with a gift for maths. He is also synaesthetic, which means his senses become mixed. His 2008 memoir, Born On A Blue Day, was a global bestseller and his new book, Thinking In Numbers, is out now.\n\nI’m the oldest of nine siblings.People were fascinated that families came in such sizes. I talk about a family of nine being like the decimal system, from zero to nine. It helped form my interest in numbers.\n\nThere are 512 different combinations of my siblings being together at any one time.It’s like the spaces in noughts and crosses; each of us represents a blank space on the board. Having that experience growing up stimulated my imagination.\n\nWe grew up in a working class area of east London.Dad worked in a car factory and Mum in an office. We didn’t have much money so we spent a lot of time reading library books. I discovered the idea of infinity from reading the Brothers Grimm story of the magic porridge pot to my brothers and sisters. A girl is given a pot by a witch that magically produces porridge. One day they forget to say the magic word and the pot produces porridge until it covers the whole town.\n\nWe all had to do our share.It was intense. I wasn’t diagnosed as a ‘high functioning autistic’ at the time; those words didn’t exist for us and my parents had to juggle nine children with the eldest being very bright but very withdrawn and hypersensitive. I had very repetitive behaviours and found it difficult to make friends. My father would call me cack-handed because I was awkward. It took me ages to learn the difference between left and right.\n\nAutism wasn’t diagnosed until I was 25 so, as a child, it was just something that was always there that we had to deal with but we didn’t know what it was.I went to a normal school. My parents were very proud when I won an eager reader award aged 11. Then I won student of the year twice at secondary school. I was bright academically but, socially, things were very difficult.\n\nBefore I was aware it was important to make friends and realised I had lots of problems doing so, I was quite happy being in my own world.I tried to understand my family relationships using mathematical predictions. I’d find patterns in my mum’s behaviour – for example what she’d do after going to the shops on a particular day or who we might visit at the weekend. Autistic people want security and trying to anticipate what was going to happen was important for me. We all do it. Anticipating the actions of people we love is an act of love in itself – trying to understand someone who is special to us makes us closer to them.\n\nHaving such a big family was very stimulating.It helped my development. I sometimes found the noise and activity difficult to deal with but it made me curious about how people tick. Some people with autism lack that stimulation but having so many siblings made me want to try to understand them. In that way, my approach of looking for patterns was useful – numbers aren’t cold and abstract, they’re essential to understanding ourselves and other people.\n\nUsing maths helped me anticipate my mum’s behaviour but also taught me there are limits to such an approach.There were things I couldn’t anticipate. There were times she’d do something completely unexpected. Every individual is so complex. It stimulated my imagination to realise how complex and fascinating every individual is.\n\nMy family is very proud of me.I didn’t expect to end up writing international best sellers, winning prizes and making a living from writing. Where I come from, we associated that with middle class people who go to Oxbridge. Having high-functioning autism makes it more incredible, as people with autism find language and communication more challenging. I guess that’s what I’ve been able to bring to writing – and what my family taught me as well, which is to believe in myself and my difference. Hopefully I’ve helped other people value their own difference. What’s universal and makes us all the same, in a way, is how different we all are one from the other.Thinking In Numbers: How Maths Illuminates Our Lives is published by Hodder & Stoughton, £18.99"
