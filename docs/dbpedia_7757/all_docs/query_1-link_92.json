I know it was a Wednesday,  becasue the date is blue in my mind and Wednesdays are always blue, like the  number nine or the sound of loud voices arguing.'     Like the character Hoffman portrayed, he can perform extraordinary maths in  his head, sees numbers as shapes, colours, textures and motions, and can  learn to speak a language fluently from scratch in three days. He also has a  compulsive need for order and routine. He eats exactly 45 grams of porridge  for breakfast and cannot leave the house without counting the number of items  of clothing he's wearing. If he gets stressed or unhappy he closes his eyes  and counts.     But in some ways Daniel is not all like the Rain Man. He is virtually  unique amongst people who have severe autisitic disorders in being capable of  living a fully-functioning, independent life. It is this incredible  self-awareness and ability to communicate what it feels like to live in a  totally extraordinary way that makes BORN ON A BLUE DAY so powerful.",
