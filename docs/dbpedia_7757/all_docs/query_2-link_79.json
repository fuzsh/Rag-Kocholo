        "text": "6 Local Writing Systems in Indonesia\n\nIndonesia is a vast country in Southeast Asia that anyone can recognize easily on the map because it borders the sea, thus its country border is also the sea border. Hundreds of ethnic groups and languages exist in Indonesia. Despite having numerous writing systems, the government recognizes the Latin alphabet as the official writing system, which was introduced during the colonization by the Europeans.\n\nI speak 4 languages in Penang Malaysia and I shall learn 1 more language\n\nI spoke 4 languages: Hokkien, Indonesian, English, and Mandarin on my recent trip to Penang. There was no communication barrier since the Penangnites are mostly multilingual too, at least, they know a bit of each language. They are also familiar with the Indonesian language because of the many tourists from Indonesia, either for tourism or medical checkups. I had learnt Tamil before but it was not enough for me to have a conversation yet. I will learn Tamil more seriously from now on, so I can use it on my next trip to Penang.\n\nNauruan Language\n\nThe Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a two-day event promoting the Asia-Pacific culture in the capital city of Taiwan, Taipei City, on September 28-29th. The participants come from the Solomon Islands, the Philippines, the Marshall Islands, Vietnam, Tuvalu, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea, New Zealand, Palau, Nauru, Malaysia, Kiribati, Japan, Indonesia, India, Fiji, and Brunei. Apart from performing dances from each country, the participants also displayed a wide variety of handicrafts and artworks as well as authentic cuisine at each country's booth.\n\nLevel Up Or Learn A New Language?\n\nSo, you might be learning your ninth language and people keep on asking \"When will you stop learning languages?\" Instead of having an answer to that question, you came up with more questions, \"Will you level up one language or learn a new language?\"\n\n9 Multilingual News Websites For Reading Practice\n\nLearners learn languages in many different ways, such as attending language classes, playing games, or listening to audio. Whatever the methods are, they usually cover four aspects of language learning: reading, listening, speaking, and writing. Mastering only one or two of these is not enough because, in reality, we read, listen, speak, and write.\n\nFast way to learn Tamil alphabet\n\nI have wanted to learn Tamil for a long time, but lack of motivation hindered my progress. I struggled to decide whether to learn the alphabet first or go straight to the conversation using romanization. I felt demotivated whenever I looked at the alphabet chart. The Tamil alphabets have 13 vowels and 18 consonants, as well as many combinations of these vowels and consonants. I thought to myself how am I going to remember all of this?\n\n5 Famous Polyglots and Their Learning Techniques\n\nYou may have watched videos of people speaking in multiple languages. Some of them even call themselves hyperpolyglots. Whether they really can speak fluently or not, we don't know unless we test them. However, here I shall present 5 renowned polyglots that have been on the news, in the community worldwide and have proved their exceptional linguistic capabilities.\n\nA unique group of Chinese Indonesian: Why are they still able to converse fluently in Hokkien after most areas have been \"Indonesianized\"?\n\nBefore visiting Medan, Indonesia, like many non-Indonesians who have never visited Medan, I thought that the local Chinese were highly Indonesianized, just like other parts of Indonesia such as Jakarta, Surabaya and Bandung. Therefore, when I visited Medan for the first time in 2009, I was deeply surprised by the fact that most of the local Chinese, including children, speak fluent Hokkien, as Hokkien is also my father's native dialect.\n\nWatch Listen Online (WLO)\n\nThe Internet has changed our lives so much, even about watching and listening. Here are several WLO websites that I have got through my friendships. Million thanks to my friends that have contributed these websites."
