        "text": "Dear Ms Seiko Noda, Minister of Loneliness.\n\nSo began the letter Kana had spent several days writing in her head (horizontally, and left to right, the letter being in English, the language she preferred to think in) and continued, after the necessary preliminaries:\n\n“I applaud your ministry’s recent creation and its aim to tackle the spiralling problem of loneliness in the country.\n\n“On the government’s website, I notice that it does not mention who might be more vulnerable to loneliness. Research has shown that ‘disabled’ people can be lonelier than ‘non-disabled’, autistic people particularly so. Autistic people do not ‘have a disability’, but they are ‘disabled’ when others around them do not understand their differently wired minds nor accommodate for their needs.\n\n“Making accommodations confers on them no additional merits, but simply permits them to be on a level playing field with everyone else.\n\n“A lack of understanding from others leads to loneliness, just as much as the absence of social relationships. Addressing this would go a long way towards alleviating loneliness in the nation. This could include diminishing the stigma around autism in Japan and bringing the correct knowledge of autism and autistic loneliness to the wider society…”\n\n‘Research’ was the kind of word that sounded fine when she said it but pretentious when others did. She was 27 years old, and while she felt strongly about her work, she was the last person who would ever make a fuss about it. Which was why the enquiries from this British writer, like those from the American reporter before him, had been as big a surprise to her as they were to her mother. A reassurance, too, that she really might be on to something.\n\nKana put down her chopsticks and said, “When I think of feeling lonely, I think of the word buru buru. It sounds just like the feeling, don’t you think?”\n\n“Buru buru?” Hiromi had finished her gyoza dumpling. “Yes, I suppose. Yes, I can see that.”\n\nThe sound usually described someone trembling – trembling from the cold or fright.\n\n“Like not having the warmth of someone close to you,” Hiromi pursued. “Or feeling afraid on account of being on your own.”\n\n“Yes, exactly.” And seeing her chance, Kana went on, “And with what sound do you associate feeling lonely?”\n\nHiromi’s face turned thoughtful.\n\n“Chiku chiku,” she said at last.\n\nIt was a sound used to refer to a prickling pain.\n\nWas it precisely this pain, chiku chiku, that her mother had felt during Kana’s years abroad?\n\nWhen the journal article appeared, Kana emailed the British writer, who replied with congratulations and the news that his narrative about her was almost there. He just needed to study up a bit on Okinawa.\n\n✲\n\nFor centuries the Okinawans traded with the mainland, China and other lands in East and Southeast Asia. Even as Japan isolated itself from the world, goods and peoples and traditions continued to meet and mix on the annexed island. The Shoguns neglected the islanders, world war devastated them, but their culture of welcome and inclusion survived."
