        "text": "American Jazz Museum to host Smithsonian Traveling Exhibit beginning Saturday\n\nIn April 1957, photographer Jerry Dantzic had an assignment from Decca Records to photograph Billie Holiday during a week-long run of performances at the Newark, New Jersey, nightclub, Sugar Hill.\n\nWhat unfolded was an unexpected and intimate journey into her private and public worlds. His photos comprise the largest collection of images from any single Billie Holiday club engagement. “Billie Holiday at Sugar Hill: Photographs by Jerry Dantzic” presents 56 remarkable images of the jazz icon that challenge the tragic narrative that frequently defines her. The exhibition will be on view at the American Jazz Museum, 1616 E. 18th St., from Saturday, May 8 to Sunday, Aug. 1.\n\nDeveloped collaboratively by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) and the Jerry Dantzic Archives, the exhibition shows the elegance, complexity, star power and humanity of the consummate jazz artist. Dantzic’s discreet, respectful and artful approach, using only available light, helped forge a bond of trust between him and Holiday.\n\nThe result is a series of striking images that presents her, not only on stage but also among her closest friends and family, projecting warmth, humor and tenderness. The photographer’s unparalleled access also captures Holiday encountering fans, strolling Broad Street in Newark, backstage and performing. Dantzic, an artist in his own right, masterfully captures these moments. The photographs document a significant period in Holiday’s life, just two years before her death at the age of 44.\n\nClick here to learn more about this legendary exhibition.\n\n–\n\nDance your way to First Friday with the KC Friends of Alvin Ailey\n\n—\n\nFirst Friday, Mother’s Day & more this weekend!\n\nGuadalupe Centers to host Cinco de Mayo Fiesta on Friday\n\nFirst Friday is back: Crossroads Arts District & 18th & Vine\n\nHilliard Gallery: An Exhibition of Things Called Art\n\nMake Mother’s Day weekend memorable at the City Market\n\nBlooms in the Bottoms to celebrate moms this weekend\n\n—\n\nDowntown Kansas City in the news…\n\nDowntown to welcome new dog park where the pups run free\n\nMultifamily plans soar in advance of KC’s new affordable housing ordinance\n\nKC ranks among top ‘Best Cities for New College Grads’\n\nLemonade Park produces great music + food in West Bottoms\n\nMO House advances pro-entrepreneur bill that would lower taxes on self-starters\n\nPricey air conditioner option OK’d to keep criminal justice system working\n\n‘Best is yet to come’ – Alvin Brooks celebrates 89th birthday with loved ones\n\n—-"
