        "meta_description": "<p> Probably no voice in the history of jazz exerts a deeper fascination than the vulnerable, intimate slur of Billie Holiday, who died in 1959 at the age of 44. With a vocal range of barely an octave and the timbre of a muted horn, Miss Holiday's singing was far from athletic, but it spanned the emotional range of the universe, communicating joy and pain with an immediacy that seemed at once artless and profoundly sophisticated. </p><p> Remembering Billie Holiday in her novel \"Sleepless Nights,\" Elizabeth Hardwick came as close as anyone to capturing the essence of a performer who, after all that has been written about her, remains a profound enigma. \"The heart always drew back from the power of her will and its engagement with disaster,\" Ms. Hardwick wrote. \"Stately, sinister and determined, somehow she had retrieved from darkness the miracle of pure style.\"  Stephen Holden </p>",

An Oscar nomination and a year of protests against racism have kept it in the conversation.\n\nBy Bryan Pietsch\n\nCritic’s Notebook\n\nWhy Is It So Hard to Show Black Women’s Musical Genius Onscreen?\n\nOscar-nominated performances this season put the emphasis on the trauma, not the artistry, of Billie Holiday and Ma Rainey. The most insightful movie might just be “Soul.”\n\nBy Salamishah Tillet\n\nAndra Day Earns a Best Actress Nomination for ‘The United States vs. Billie Holiday’\n\n“It shouldn’t be an uncomfortable idea that it could be all Black women being represented in this space,” said the star, who’s also working on a new album.\n\nBy Sarah Bahr\n\n‘The United States vs. Billie Holiday’ Review: Singing for Her Life\n\nLee Daniels’s hectic biopic portrays the singer as a victim of abuse, addiction and government persecution.\n\nBy A.O. Scott\n\nBillie Holiday’s Story Depends on Who’s Telling It\n\nThere are almost as many interpretations of her short life and enormous legacy as there are books and films about her, including the new biopic starring Andra Day.\n\nBy Robert Ito"
