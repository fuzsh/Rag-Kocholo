        "text": "Billie Holiday started her celebrated singing career in Harlem, and the legendary jazz vocalist spent the end of her life within blocks of the borough as well. Sticking to her roots, the star resided in an Upper West Side brownstone while recording one of her most famous albums, ‘Lady in Satin.’ A piece of music history, the home is now available to buy for $13.995 million.\n\nThe circa-1910 brownstone housed the star in unit #1B up until her death in 1959. According to 6sqft, the entire home was last seeking new ownership not long ago in October of 2015. After a series of price reductions, it last sold in 2017 for $9.475 million. Employing the design prowess of Amie Sachs, formerly of Annabelle Selldorf Architects, the brownstone then received a magnificent restoration that brought it up to date while still preserving its early 20th-century character.\n\nNow ready to switch hands again, the stately 6,300-square-foot pad spans six floors of rich yet modern interiors. The kitchen features a Sub-Zero refrigeration system and a Bertazzoni gas range while the adjacent foyer boasts intricate paneling and beautiful herringbone floors. The third floor serves as a luxurious full-floor primary suite, one of a total of seven bedrooms, six full bathrooms and two partial baths.\n\nDescending down the home’s levels, the perks keep on coming. The garden floor features a private outdoor space, complete with Verdent tiles and a barbecue. Then the basement floor shows off a unique arched brick design, along with a temperature-controlled wine room."
