        "text": "OLD & NEW\n\nFIVE BILLIE HOLIDAY TRIBUTES\n\nApril 7, 2016 | by Ross Eustis\n\nBillie Holiday & dog \"Mister\" (William Gottlieb Collection)\n\nIn honor of Billie Holiday's birthday and centennial, as well as the singer's tremendous influence on artists of every generation, we've pulled together five tributes (old and new) to Lady Day.\n\nAlthough \"Strange Fruit\" isn't a Holiday original (penned by Abel Meeropol as a poem in 1937), Lady Day made it famous. (Legend tells that Holiday would close out sets with the song. Waiters would stop all service, the room would be in darkness except for a spotlight on Holiday, and there would be no encore.) Nina Simone, who acknowledges Holiday as one of her biggest inspirations, sings one of the most stirring renditions of \"Strange Fruit\" you'll hear.\n\nIn an interview with VH1, rising vocalist José James called Billie Holiday his \"musical mother.\" James captures a beautiful mood on Yesterday I Had the Blues: The Music of Billie Holiday (2015), his third release on Blue Note Records.\n\nPianist Mal Waldron accompanied Billie Holiday regularly from April 1957 until her death in July, 1959. Although Waldron recorded Left Alone in 1959, he was reluctant to release it immediately, given a large outpouring of \"bandwagon\" tributes recorded and released immediately after Holiday's passing. In addition to a beautiful collaboration with Jackie McLean on \"Left Alone,\" the album features an enlightening \"Mal Waldron Interview: The Way He Remembers Billy Holiday.\"\n\nCassandra Wilson lent her rich, dusky sound to a selection of Billie Holiday classics on Coming Forth By Day (2015) to celebrate her centennial year. Wilson's final song, \"Last Song for Lester Young\" is intended to fill a void left by the events surrounding the funeral of Holiday's long time companion, Lester Young. After hearing of Lester’s passing while touring in Europe, Billie immediately flew home to the States to attend his funeral, where she wanted to sing for him as a final farewell. However, Lester’s family, for whatever reason, denied Billie. Cassandra Wilson brings her centennial tribute to San Francisco in May, 2016."
