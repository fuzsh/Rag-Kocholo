        "text": "popular name: Dimebag Darrell\n\ndate_of_death: December 8, 2004\n\nage: 38\n\ncause_of_death: Multiple gunshot wounds to the head\n\nclaim_to_fame: Music\n\nbest_know_for: As the cofounder with his brother Vinnie of Pantera and Damageplan, Dimebag Darrell was not only one of the most influential heavy metal guitarist but considered one of the greatest guitarist of modern times. Sadly his fame extended to his brutal death while performing onstage at the Alrosa Villa Nightclub in Columbus, Ohio.\n\npopular name: Johnny Ace\n\ndate_of_death: December 25, 1954\n\nage: 25\n\ncause_of_death: Accidental gunshot to the head\n\nclaim_to_fame: Music\n\nbest_know_for: A popular R&B singer with a string of eight hits in a row including \"Cross My Heart\" and \"Please Forgive Me\", he blew his brains out on Christmas Day between sets after telling everyone ‘It’s okay! Gun’s not loaded… see?’ Interestingly enough, \"Pledging My Love\" was a posthumous R&B number 1 hit for 10 weeks beginning February 12, 1955, thus Johnny Ace became the first artist to reach the Billboard pop charts only after death.\n\npopular name: Booker Little Jr.\n\ndate_of_death: October 5, 1961\n\nage: 23\n\ncause_of_death: Complications from uremia caused by kidney failure\n\nclaim_to_fame: Music\n\nbest_know_for: Booker Little, twenty-three year-old composer, arranger and trumpet player has lately come to demonstrate, in recordings and as the musical director of the Max Roach group, a talent that was taken too early. When he died suddenly at the age of 23 he was one of the most promising jazz trumpeters working with Max Roach, Eric Dolphy and John Coltrane. After years of physical pain, Little died of complications resulting from kidney failure on October 5, 1961, in New York City at the age 23. He was survived by his wife, two sons Booker T. III and Larry Cornelius, and two daughters Cornelia and Ana Dorsey."
