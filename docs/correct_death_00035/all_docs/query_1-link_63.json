        "text": "The de Blasio administration isn’t wasting any time in expanding the SheBuiltNYC program, which will increase the number of statues dedicated to notable women across the five boroughs. After announcing its first commission last year—a statue of trailblazing Brooklyn politician Shirley Chisholm near Prospect Park—First Lady Chirlane McCray and deputy mayor Alicia Glen (whose last day was, technically, last week) have revealed the four women who will be honored in the program’s next phase.\n\nThose women are legendary jazz singer Billie Holiday, who lived in Queens before her death in 1959; civil rights leader Elizabeth Jennings Graham, who helped desegregate New York City’s streetcars in the 19th century; Dr. Helen Rodríguez Trías, who practiced in the Bronx and was an advocate for woman and children; and Katherine Walker, who oversaw the Robbins Reef Lighthouse near Bayonne (which is now part of Staten Island’s Noble Maritime Collection) for many years.\n\nThe statues will rise in the boroughs closely associated with each woman—Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island, respectively. With those and the Chisholm statue in Brooklyn—along with the, uh, five other pieces commemorating women that currently exist—there will now be monuments honoring women in each of the city’s boroughs.\n\n“When we launched She Built NYC, we promised this would not be a ‘one and done,’” Glen said in a statement. “Today’s announcement marks real action by the City of New York to ensure that our public realm exemplifies the diverse and accomplished women who make this city so great.”\n\nThe de Blasio administration launched an open call for nominations for the SheBuiltNYC program over the summer, ultimately getting more than 2,000 suggestions for new statues. The city says it will work with the Museum of the City of New York to look for “groups of women” that could be the subject of future monuments.\n\nAs of right now, artists for the first five monuments have not been selected; the city expects to have that process finished by next year, with the first batch of monuments going up in 2021 and 2022."
