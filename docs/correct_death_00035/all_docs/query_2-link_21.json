        "text": "The New York City home where Billie Holiday spent her final years before her death in 1959 has just sold for $9.475 million, according to Trulia. The Upper West Side brownstone near Central Park was originally built in 1910 and underwent recent renovations that kept the home's original charm intact. The 6,300-square-foot home is entered through a Renaissance Revival façade into an old-world foyer with gorgeously restored mahogany walls and a chandelier. The mahogany detailing continues throughout the home, as does maple detailing, which is now paired with new white oak flooring. The entry hall moves into the dining room, and the oak-and-marble kitchen has a Sub-Zero refrigerator, Bertazone range, and gold hardware surrounded by white cabinets and subway tiling on the walls. The living room sits behind the kitchen, with a 12-foot plaster ceiling and wood paneling on the walls. The garden floor is below, with an additional kitchen, a large media room, and a bedroom. One floor below that is the basement, which has additional storage and a temperature-controlled wine cellar behind restored oak doors. Most of the home’s seven bedrooms are on the third, fourth, and fifth floors, with the master suite spanning the entire third floor, a large bedroom, library with fireplace, walk-in closet, and bathroom with dual vanity sinks, luxurious oversize tub, and separate shower.\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nElon Musk Now Lives in a $50,000 Prefab Tiny House in Texas\n\nAfter selling most of his real estate portfolio, the multibillionaire is now living in a 400-square-foot unit on his SpaceX Texas site\n\nMagazine\n\nDetroit’s Michigan Central Station Is Restored to Its Original Glory\n\nMore than 3,000 artisans helped revive the 1913 Beaux Arts train terminal\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nInside LeBron James’s Houses: A Peek Into His Sizable Real Estate Portfolio\n\nThe NBA star owns properties in his home state of Ohio, in Florida, and in California\n\nCelebrity Style\n\nCiara and Russell Wilson’s Homes: Inside the Power Couple’s Real Estate Portfolio\n\nThe R&B superstar and NFL champion have owned property all over the country"
