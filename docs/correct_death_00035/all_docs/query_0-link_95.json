        "text": "Billie Holiday was an American jazz singer. She is considered by some to be the greatest jazz singer of all time. Holiday is also known by her nickname Lady Day.\n\nHoliday was born Eleanora Harris on April 7, 1915, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, and moved to New York City with her mother in 1928. She changed her name to Billie Holiday shortly after arriving in New York and was soon singing in nightclubs. Holiday had no formal music training, but she developed a unique and moving singing style.\n\nIn 1933 Holiday made her first recordings with the famous jazz bandleader Benny Goodman. She continued to record and tour with the best jazz musicians of the time, including Count Basie and Artie Shaw. Some of the songs most identified with Holiday are “Strange Fruit,” “The Man I Love,” and “God Bless the Child.” Holiday had a successful career into the 1950s.\n\nHoliday’s autobiography Lady Sings the Blues was published in 1956. Holiday suffered from drug addiction, which led to her death on July 17, 1959. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000 and into the National Women’s Hall of Fame in 2011."
