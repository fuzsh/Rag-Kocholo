        "text": "To which countries do you deliver?\n\nWe ship worldwide, however some products may have territorial restrictions. Please do not hesitate to contact us in order to find out how to obtain the products that are not available for purchase in your territory.\n\nWhat forms of payment do you accept?\n\nStripe, PayPal, Visa, MasterCard.\n\nHow do I know if my order is being processed?\n\nA confirmation email will be sent to you once your payment has been confirmed. If you have not received it, look at your spam folder; If necessary, send us a message at order@bigwax.io.\n\nOnce your order is shipped, you will receive a confirmation email again with your tracking number.\n\nHow long will it take to send my order?\n\nIf your order is placed before 1 PM (time in Paris, France), your order will be processed and sent the same day. If it is placed after 1 PM (time in Paris, France), your order will be sent the next working day.\n\nCan I place an order now for despatch at a later date?\n\nWe do not currently offer this solution. All orders are processed as quickly as possible.\n\nIs the payment transaction on Bigwax secure?\n\nWe use the HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol. This Internet communication protocol protects the integrity and confidentiality of your data when transferring information between your computer and the website.\n\nCan you guarantee delivery on a specific date?\n\nStandard shipments do not guarantee delivery on a specific date, the displayed time is therefore approximate. However, the express shipments are guaranteed, and the delivery time is indicated when choosing the means of transport from your cart.\n\nA product that I recently saw on the site is no longer visible at all on the site. Can I still order it?\n\nIf a product does not appear anymore, it does not mean that it is out of stock. This means that the producer no longer has the necessary rights to offer it for sale on Bigwax. However, in this case, please do not hesitate to contact us at order@bigwax.io.\n\nIs there a discount if the amount of my order is important?\n\nThere are no discounts or coupons in place at this time. If you are a professional and wish to order at the reseller price, contact us at distribution@bigwax.fr.\n\nIs it possible to withdraw my order directly from your offices?\n\nOn-site withdrawal is not possible yet.\n\nCan I change the delivery address of my order?\n\nOur general conditions as well as those of the banking establishments attached to our platform, Stripe and PayPal, stipulate that when placing an order, the delivery address must be identical to the postal address registered in the Stripe or PayPal account used for the payment. Thus, any change of address must be subject to an order cancellation, then a new order with the two identical addresses.\n\nWhy ? : In case of a dispute, Stripe, like PayPal, will close any claim against us due to the mismatch of the delivery addresses.\n\nWhat happens when I combine in my cart both a product available in stock and a pre-order product?\n\nIn this case, you pay two separate shipping costs. The product in stock is shipped directly and the pre-ordered product on the date indicated on the product info sheet.\n\nWhen sending my order, will my package be sufficiently protected?\n\nWe use high-quality packaging adapted to each product to maximize the chances of a delivery in the best conditions.\n\nIs my invoice attached with the shipment?\n\nNo, your invoices are available and downloadable from your client space.\n\nI’m order from outside the European Union. Will I have to pay the VAT?\n\nOrders made from outside the European Union are not subject to the French VAT of 20%.\n\nI am ordering as a company with an Intracommunity VAT number.
