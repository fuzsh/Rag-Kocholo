        "text": "The King of Fighters is a series of fighting games developed by SNK. Originally, the series was developed for SNK's Neo Geo MVS arcade systems. This would continue to be the main platform for King of Fighters games until 2004, when SNK Playmore adopted the Atomiswave arcade system as its primary board. SNK Playmore has since stated that it will release its latest arcade titles for the Taito Type X2 arcade system.\n\nThe first game in the series, The King of Fighters '94 was released by SNK on August 25, 1994. The game was originally designed to be a dream match of characters from the company's various arcade titles, particularly Fatal Fury, Art of Fighting, Ikari Warriors, and Psycho Soldier. Sequels from the series have been released each year until The King of Fighters 2003. By 2004, SNK abandoned yearly releases of the series and numbered future games in a more traditional manner.[1] In 2004, SNK produced the first 3D installment of the series, The King of Fighters: Maximum Impact. The game, and its two sequels, revises much of the backstory for characters and settings from previous games.\n\nSeveral characters from the series also appear in cross-over video games such as the Capcom vs. SNK series. In addition to the remakes of individual games such as Re-bout, Ultimate Match, and Unlimited Match, SNK Playmore has released compilations of their KOF games.\n\nMain series\n\n[edit]\n\nOrochi Saga\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details\n\nOriginal release date(s):\n\nJapan: 25 August 1994\n\nRelease years by system:\n\n1994 – Arcade[2]\n\n1994 – Neo Geo[2]\n\n1994 – Neo Geo CD[2]\n\n2004 – PlayStation 2[3]\n\n2008 – Virtual Console[4]\n\n2010 – PlayStation 3[5]\n\n2011 – PlayStation Portable[5]\n\nNotes:\n\nThe game was remade and released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 as The King of Fighters '94 Re-Bout in Japan. This version has several new features like hi-res graphics, online play, team edit, a playable Rugal Bernstein, and the addition of Saisyu Kusanagi.\n\nOriginal release date(s):\n\nJapan: 25 July 1995\n\nRelease years by system:\n\n1995 – Arcade[6]\n\n1995 – Neo Geo[6]\n\n1995 – Neo Geo CD[6]\n\n1996 – Sega Saturn[6]\n\n1996 – PlayStation[6]\n\n1996 – Game Boy[6]\n\n2010 – Virtual Console[6]\n\n2011 – PSN[7]\n\nNotes:\n\nIntroduces the team edit feature which allows players to create their own three-character team.\n\nPorted to the Sega Saturn in Japan.

SNK refitted the Dreamcast version (renamed The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999) with an extended hand-animated introduction, link-up capability with KOF R-2 for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, and 3D backgrounds.\n\nSeparate from the KOF story line, this dream match contains fighters from all previous King of Fighters games except for Eiji Kisaragi, Kasumi Todoh, Goenitz and the Boss Team (Geese Howard, Wolfgang Krauser, and Mr. Big) from KOF '96. Saisyu Kusanagi also makes his first appearance as a non-secret playable character.\n\nLike KOF '94, this game was also remade and released in 2008 for the PlayStation 2 as The King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match in Japan. Like its '94 counterpart, the update features redesigned backgrounds, online play, and new characters (Eiji Kisaragi, Kasumi Todoh and the boss team from KOF '96 among others).\n\nNESTS Saga\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Details\n\nOriginal release date(s):\n\nJapan: 22 July 1999\n\nRelease years by system:\n\n1999 – Arcade[14]\n\n1999 – Neo Geo[14]\n\n1999 – Neo Geo CD[14]\n\n2000 – PlayStation[14]\n\n2000 – Dreamcast[14]\n\nNotes:\n\nIntroduces the striker system, which allows the player to call on a teammate to aid the current fighter.\n\nPorted to the Dreamcast and the PlayStation in the US.
