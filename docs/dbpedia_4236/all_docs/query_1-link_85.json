KOF94 will be released as GS-025 Vol. 1, while KOF95 will be released as GS-025 Vol. 2.\n\nAs the debut title of SNK’s most iconic fighting game franchise, KOF ‘94, composed by M.Hataya as part of the SNK NEO Sound Orchestra, laid the groundwork for the KOF series’ beloved music. For the sequel KOF95, M.Hataya reprised his role while being joined by composers Akihiro Uchida and Pearl Sibakiti.\n\nAs Generation Series releases, the KOF94 and KOF95 soundtracks will both feature newly remastered analog and digital tracks, as well as a booklet containing archival artwork and liner notes by former development team members, including level designer Toyohisa Tanabe.\n\nThe vinyl editions for both soundtracks will each come in a single 150g colored record in a sleeve. Both releases will be available for purchase individually. If purchasing through Limited Run Games or BigWax, there will also be a bundle containing both releases offered at a discount. There will also be a signed edition by Toyohisa Tanabe limited to 300 copies worldwide. Both standalone releases will retail for US$27.99, as a bundle containing both releases for $49.99, and the signed edition bundle for US$64.99.\n\nThe 1-CD editions of both albums will retail for US$14.99."
