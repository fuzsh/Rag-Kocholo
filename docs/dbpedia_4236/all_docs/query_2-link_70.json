        "text": "Few series last as long as The King of Fighters has stuck around. Ever since 1994, SNK’s signature series has been a fighting game staple, and its 3-on-3 combat hasn’t really been replicated elsewhere. The series definitely has its own niche, and thrives within it. This success is why the fourteenth main entry came out last week exclusively on PlayStation 4 (which you can read my review of).\n\nWhen a series has existed for over 20 years, it’s going to hit some rough patches. Even The King of Fighters has had some disappointing games, and even tried its best to copy Tekken at one point. It has been a wild history, and the series has seen a lot of changes over the years only to ultimately go back to what worked at first.\n\nSo, take a trip down memory lane and check out the series’ long history on PlayStation. From the 1994 original to this week’s new release — The King of Fighters XIV — the series has had a long history of being available on PlayStation consoles. Check out a slice of King of Fighters history!\n\nI hope you enjoyed my look back at The King of Fighters series. It’s interesting to see how the series lost its way several times, but always ended up going back to what worked after a while. It’s why the series has stayed relevant for well over 20 years, while many of fighting game series have faded away into obscurity.\n\nLet me know in the comments what your favorite King of Fighters game is, and if you picked up the latest installment yet!\n\nRelated Reading:\n\nPlayStation Plus Price Increase – Should You Be Worried?\n\nPS4 Update 4.00 Overview – Here’s What to Expect\n\nTypes of PlayStation Trophy Hunters – Which One Are You?\n\nThe King of Fighters\n\nThe King of Fighters Returns\n\nThe King of Fighters '94\n\nThe King of Fighters '95\n\nThe King of Fighters '96\n\nThe King of Fighters '97\n\nThe King of Fighters '98\n\nThe King of Fighters '99\n\nThe King of Fighters 2000\n\nThe King of Fighters 2001\n\nThe King of Fighters 2002\n\nThe King of Fighters 2003\n\nThe King of Fighters: Maximum Impact\n\nThe King of Fighters '94 Re-Bout\n\nThe King of Fighters Neowave\n\nThe King of Fighters XI\n\nThe King of Fighters: Maximum Impact 2\n\nThe King of Fighters '98 Ultimate Match\n\nThe King of Fighters XII\n\nThe King of Fighters 2002 Unlimited Match\n\nThe King of Fighters XIII\n\nThe King of Fighters XIV\n\nTRENDING\n\nFolks who initially missed out on the limited edition Astro Bot PS5 DualSense controller should hurry up and snag one…\n\nA PS Store leak has confirmed the existence of a major unannounced game… for PC.
