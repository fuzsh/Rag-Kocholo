When Art of Fighting's Yuri is kidnapped yet again, players pick one of four King of Fighters characters (alongside Samurai Shodown guest characters Haohmaru and Nakoruru) and head out on a journey to rescue her and test their knowledge. The overworld is represented as a board game, with branching paths; players start their turn rolling a die to decide how far to travel, then duel whatever character is at that position in a quiz battle. Characters have health, which they lose at every incorrect answer; run out of health, and it's a game over."
