        "text": "▲\n\n1\n\n▼\n\nDuring the game's early development, there were plans to include a \"Samurai Shodown Team\" made up of Haohmaru, Nakoruru, and Galford. The idea for the team was dropped due to concerns about the first Samurai Shodown's popularity:\n\n\"Samurai Shodown was just coming out. So, it was kind of like, are these characters going to be super popular or not? And when it comes to the King of Fighters series, really it’s about who are the all-stars of SNK, right? What popular characters are we going to put in there above everything else? What’s going to sell?\n\nSo at that time, we didn’t really know if these characters were going to help increase sales, because you had to wait an entire year or so to see what characters were popping up as everyone’s favorites.\"\n\nA Samurai Shodown team was eventually added in The King of Fighters XV as part of the game's first season of DLC characters. 27 years after the release of The King of Fighters '95."
