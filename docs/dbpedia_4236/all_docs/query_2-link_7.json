        "text": "Released in 1995, THE KING OF FIGHTERS '95 is a fighting game that features main characters from the popular Fatal Fury, Ikari Warriors, Psycho Soldier and Art of Fighting games.\n\nThey return to battle following the release of 1994's THE KING OF FIGHTERS '94. Kyo Kusanagi's rival, Iori Yagami, has also joined the fight to leave his lasting mark on the continuing storyline and on Kyo, the game's hero, so watch out. As with the 1994 release, you'll find three-on-three team battles, a power gauge that lets you store up energy to land a devastating blow, and the one-shot reversal super-special moves unique to the series. On top of all that, this release also adds a new \"Team Edit\" feature, allowing you to enjoy bouts with a level of strategy like you've never experienced before."
