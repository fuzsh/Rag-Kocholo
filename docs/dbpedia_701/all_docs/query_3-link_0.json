        "text": "Singer/Songwriter Paul Davis set out to write a song that would sound like something Hall & Oates might record, while at the same time, have sort of a nostalgic feel to it.\n\nHe called it: “55 Love Affair,” which, in itself, is a pretty good title, but the suits at Paul’s record company (Bang Records), had a question.\n\nThey asked Paul how old he was in 1955. The Answer…was 7.\n\nAt that point, they suggested he change the title to “65 Love Affair” since more people would believe a 17-year-old in love.\n\nExcellent point, so Paul adjusted the title and lyrics accordingly.\n\nAnd When the song was released as a single (from the album “Cool Night,” Paul did indeed sound a bit like Hall & Oates…and it was more believable, age-wise. SO believable, it spent FIVE MONTHS on Billboard’s Hot 100, peaking at #6. It also reached #5 on The Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\nThe moral of the story? Sometimes when you listen to the suits, you hit the charts with a BANG! Pun intended. “65 Love Affair” by Paul Davis: a Great Song of 1982!"
