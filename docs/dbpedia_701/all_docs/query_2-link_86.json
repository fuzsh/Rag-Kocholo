        "text": "You've had your first dance, cut the wedding cake, tossed the bouquet, and enjoyed all the other wedding reception festivities. Now it's time for the last dance—and you'll want to be sure that you give your guests a happy, lasting memory of that final spin around the dance floor. Luckily, when it comes to choosing a final tune for your affair, there are plenty of options to consider.\n\nFor those who want to rock, consider wrapping up the night with AC/DC's \"You Shook Me All Night Long\" or Queen's \"Don't Stop Me Now.\" As for the classics, there's nothing better than selecting Donna Summer's \"Last Dance\" (understandably one of the most popular choices) or The Isley Brothers' \"Shout.\" More modern dance hits are also a fantastic choice; we love \"Feel So Close\" by Calvin Harris and \"The Time (Dirty Bit),\" by The Black Eyed Peas.\n\nIf you want a private last dance with just your partner, choose a slow song to create an intimate moment and re-focus the attention on you and your new spouse. If you'd rather go out with a bang—especially if you're having an after-party—pick a high-energy tune for all your guests to enjoy.\n\nAhead, here are 100 of our favorite last-dance songs that will guarantee a perfect musical end to your wedding.\n\n01 of 100\n\n\"Last Dance,\" by Donna Summer\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I need you, by me/Beside me, to guide me\"\n\n02 of 100\n\n\"(I've Had) the Time of My Life,\" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes\n\nLyrics of Love: \"No, I never felt like this before/Yes I swear it's the truth/And I owe it all to you\"\n\n03 of 100\n\n\"Sweet Caroline,\" by Neil Diamond\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Sweet Caroline/Good times never seemed so good/I'd be inclined/To believe they never would\"\n\n04 of 100\n\n\"Party Rock Anthem,\" by LMFAO\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Party rock is in the house tonight/Everybody just have a good time\"\n\n05 of 100\n\n\"Don't Stop Believin',\" by Journey\n\nLyrics of Love: \"A singer in a smoky room/A smell of wine and cheap perfume/For a smile they can share the night/It goes on and on, and on, and on\"\n\n06 of 100\n\n\"Closing Time,\" by Semisonic\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end/Yeah, I know who I want to take me home\"\n\n07 of 100\n\n\"Save the Last Dance for Me,\" by Michael Bublé\n\nLyrics of Love: \"But don't forget who's takin' you home/And in whose arms you're gonna be/So darlin' save the last dance for me\"\n\n08 of 100\n\n\"The Time (Dirty Bit),\" by The Black Eyed Peas\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Let's lose control/Let's do it all night/'Til we can't do it no more\"\n\n09 of 100\n\n\"We Are Young,\" by Fun. featuring Janelle Monáe\n\nLyrics of Love: \"We are young/So let's set the world on fire/We can burn brighter/Than the sun\"\n\n10 of 100\n\n\"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),\" by Green Day\n\nLyrics of Love: \"It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right/I hope you had the time of your life\"\n\n11 of 100\n\n\"I Don't Want This Night to End,\" by Luke Bryan\n\nLyrics of Love: \"And I don't know what road we're on/Or where we've been from starin' at you/Girl, all I know is I don't want this night to end\"\n\n12 of 100\n\n\"The Matrimony,\" by Wale featuring Usher\n\nLyrics of Love: \"If there's a question of my heart, you've got it/It don't belong to anyone but you\"\n\n13 of 100\n\n\"Today Was a Fairytale,\" by Taylor Swift\n\nLyrics of Love: \"But can you feel this magic in the air?/It must have been the way you kissed me/Fell in love when I saw you standing there\"\n\n14 of 100\n\n\"Greatest Gift,\" by Jorja Smith\n\nLyrics of Love: \"You're the greatest gift I've found/My time with you is everything\"\n\n15 of 100\n\n\"Don't Stop Me Now,\" by Queen\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I'm traveling at the speed of light/I wanna make a supersonic man out of you\"\n\n16 of 100\n\n\"Nice for What,\" by Drake\n\nLyrics of Love: \"That's a real one in your reflection\"\n\n17 of 100\n\n\"American Pie,\" by Don McLean\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Did you write the book of love/And do you have faith in God above\"\n\n18 of 100\n\n\"Forever,\" by Chris Brown\n\nLyrics of Love: \"So don't be scared, I'm right here, baby/We can go anywhere, go anywhere/But first, it's your chance, take my hand, come with me\"\n\n19 of 100\n\n\"This Will Be (an Everlasting Love),\" by Natalie Cole\n\nLyrics of Love: \"This will be/An everlasting love/This will be/The one I've waited for\"\n\n20 of 100\n\n\"Shout,\" by The Isley Brothers\n\nLyrics of Love: \"(Say) say that you need me/(Say) say that you want me/(Say) you wanna please me\"\n\n21 of 100\n\n\"You Shook Me All Night,\" by AC/DC\n\nLyrics of Love: \"She was a fast machine/She kept her motor clean/She was the best damn woman I had ever seen\"\n\n22 of 100\n\n\"Livin' on a Prayer,\" by Bon Jovi\n\nLyrics of Love: \"She says, we've got to hold on to what we've got/It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not/We've got each other and that's a lot for love\"\n\n23 of 100\n\n\"So Into You,\" by Tamia\n\nLyrics of Love: \"I think you're truly something special/Just what my dreams are really made of\"\n\n24 of 100\n\n\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" by Queen\n\nLyrics of Love: \"Is this the real life?
