        "text": "Fire up those grills and pack the beach blankets because it’s summertime and like the popular song says, “The livin’ is easy.”\n\nWe just checked the forecast and it looks like nothing but good vibes for the foreseeable future, and that means there's no time like the present to take advantage of the all-too-short months between Memorial Day and Labor Day.\n\nWhatever plans you've got on the calendar to enjoy the sunshine, they're sure to be next-level when you add these choice summer songs to the mix.\n\nTo help curate the soundtrack for the Summer of ‘24, we’ve collected a list of feel-good tunes to add to your playlist this year that includes just the right blend of classic summer songs like “Hot Fun in the Summertime” by Sly and the Family Stone and the beloved Mungo Jerry hit, “In the Summertime.”\n\nYou’ll also find plenty of contemporary singles from the likes of Harry Styles, Dua Lipa, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift, who naturally makes the cut with her 2019 hit “Cruel Summer.”\n\nAlso included in this bonanza of happy summer songs are country hits, pop tunes and good ol’ fashioned classics from the ‘70s, ‘80s, ‘90s and today.\n\nSo, kick back, fill up your cup with lemonade and get ready to let good times roll.\n\n“Dance the Night” by Dua Lipa\n\nThe title track off of “Barbie,” last summer’s runaway blockbuster movie, Dua Lipa’s “Dance the Night” is the essential song to kick off your summer songs playlist and promises to instantly get everyone feeling those happy summer vibes.\n\n“Texas Hold ‘Em” by Beyoncé\n\nWithout a doubt, “Cowboy Carter” is going to be the defining album of the Summer of ‘24. Grab your cowboy hat and get ready to line dance to Queen Bey’s “Texas Hold ‘Em.”\n\n“yes, and?” by Ariana Grande\n\nAriana Grande and Mariah Carey team up on this head-bobbing single that practically begs to be played at full volume in the car. Windows all the way down, naturally.\n\n“Shivers” by Ed Sheeran\n\nEd Sheeran wants to be that guy who kisses your eyes and drinks your smile and he talks all about it in his 2021 hit “Shivers,” a high-energy song that’ll have everyone singing along.\n\n“Golden” by Harry Styles\n\nIf ever a song evoked feelings of basking in the glow of warm sunshine, it’s Harry Styles song “Golden.” A cut off Styles’ 2019 album, “Fine Line,” this song is doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, good.\n\n“Padam Padam” by Kylie Minogue\n\nThe Kylie Minogue hit, “Padam Padam” is earworm if there ever was one. What does it mean? During a 2023 appearance on TODAY, Minogue confirmed that it represents the sound of a beating heart and its infectious rhythm will have you tapping your toes along to the beat. Padam, padam.\n\n“Holiday” by Madonna\n\nWhat’s summer if not one big long holiday? Madonna’s 1983 hit single”Holiday” is the eternal ode to taking a well-deserved break tand bringing back all of those happy days.\n\n“Houdini” by Dua Lipa\n\nAnother Dua Lipa hit makes the summer songs cut (with more to come). With its ‘80s-inspired synth line and high-energy beat, this single is, dare we say, pure magic.\n\n“Summer Breeze” by Seals & Crofts\n\nThis timeless classic by Seals & Crofts evokes thoughts of warm summer days spent lazing by the pool or catching some rays at the beach. “Summer Breeze” makes us feel fine.\n\n“Big Energy” by Latto, Mariah Carey, DJ Khaled\n\nHere’s what happens when Latto brings her energy to Mimi’s 1995 hit, “Fantasy.” If you can only picture Pedro Pascal dancing to this tune, you’ve officially watched way too much TikTok.\n\n“Hot Fun in the Summertime” by Sly & The Family Stone\n\nThis 1969 tune by Sly & The Family Stone makes us want to sip iced tea while lazing around on a hot July day. Nothing better than hot fun in the summertime.\n\n“California Gurls” by Katy Perry featuring Snoop Dogg\n\nThe West Coast represents in this summertime classic that makes us want to drink gin and juice while beaching it in our Daisy Dukes (bikinis on top).\n\n“Walking On Sunshine” by Katrina and the Waves\n\nWe feel alive, we feel the love, we feel the love that's really real in this '80s classic by Katrina and the Waves. This is the ultimate summer song and, admit it, don't it feel good?\n\n“In the Summertime” by Mungo Jerry\n\nSing along with Mungo Jerry as he dee-dee-dee's and dah-dah-dah's his way through this 1970 hit.\n\n“As it Was” by Harry Styles\n\nHarry Styles dominated the summer of ‘22 with his album “Harry’s House,” which, unsurprisingly, scored the musician a Grammy for Album of the Year. The first single, “As it Was,” is everything you could ever want from a summer song and then some.\n\n“Cruise” by Florida Georgia Line\n\nBaby, this song makes us want to roll the windows down and cruise, Chevy lift kit and all. Florida Georgia Line's 2013 country crossover hit completely captures the essence of driving down the highway on a warm summer's night.\n\n“Summer Feelings” by Lennon Stella, featuring Charlie Puth\n\nThe name sums it perfectly. This summer song covers all the bases including talk of sand, ocean waves, California dreamin' and watching the sunset from the rooftop.\n\n“Soak Up the Sun” by Sheryl Crow\n\nAll Sheryl Crow wants to do is soak up some sun and tell the rest of the world to lighten up. And, boy, can we relate. There's no better way to spend a summer day than by drinking in all that sunshine.\n\n“Get the Party Started” by Pink\n\nYou can’t deny that summer is just one endless party. Pink’s “Get the Party Started” is guaranteed to jumpstart whatever fun plans you’ve got on the calendar to make the most of every minute.\n\n“About Damn Time” by Lizzo\n\nTurn up the music, turn down the lights. We've got a feeling, it's all going to be alright ... just as long as this Lizzo song is playing on full blast.\n\n“Levitating” by Dua Lipa featuring DaBaby\n\nGlitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes, Due Lip and DaBaby take us for a ride.\n\n“Love Shack” by The B-52’s\n\nIf you see a faded sign by the side of the road that says 15 miles to the Love Shack, do not hesitate, do not pass go, just take the exit and join the line of revelers waiting to get dowwwwn.\n\n“Sucker” by the Jonas Brothers\n\n“Sucker” is an earworm of epic proportions and will have you singing along as they dance on top of cars, stumble out of bars and go just about anywhere blindly.\n\n“Since You’ve Been Gone” by Kelly Clarkson\n\nKelly Clarkson’s been inspiring us since winning the the first season of “American Idol” back in 2002. This toe-tapping anthem from her “Breakaway” album will have you belting out the chorus wherever you are.\n\n“no tears left to cry” by Ariana Grande\n\nThis Ariana Grande song went all the way to No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 in May of 2018 and remained on the charts throughout the summer, establishing the single as a bona fide summer hit,\n\n“Hot in Herre” by Nelly\n\nExtra, extra, Nelly is here with a solution to, uh, cool down in the heat of summer. With its suggestive lyrics, “Hot in Herre” raised some eyebrows back in the day. Even so, the song spent seven weeks at No. 1 during the summer of 2002.\n\n“Shake it Off” by Taylor Swift\n\nPlayers gonna play, play, play, play, play. Haters gonna hate, hate, hate ... well, you get the drift. Not a Swiftie? Just shake it off and move on to the next song.\n\n“Crazy in Love” by Beyoncé featuring Jay-Z\n\nBefore they were officially Beyoncé and Jay-Z, the producer and singer teamed up for this 2003 collab that practically sizzles it’s so hot. The first single off Beyoncé’s “Dangerously in Love” album, “Crazy in Love” ruled the charts and firmly established Queen Bey as the ruler of the music universe.\n\n“Happy” by Pharrell Williams\n\nThis hit single from the Minions movie “Despicable Me” is so infectious you won’t be able to help yourself from singing along. Period. The end.\n\n“Toxic” by Britney Spears\n\nOne listen to Britney’s “Toxic” will take you on a one-way ride to a poison paradise. Released more than 20 years ago, this head-trippy, high-octane tune is still a summer favorite.\n\n“Sugar” by Maroon 5\n\nWhy do we love “Sugar”? Because it’s so sweet, naturally. Forgive our funny pun, we just couldn’t help ourselves. Along with so many of the band’s other big hits, “Sugar” is infectious and toe-tapping fun.\n\n“Summertime Blues” by Alan Jackson\n\nOriginally recorded by Eddie Cochran back in 1958, Alan Jackson's updated country cover is about as much fun as it gets. If you've got a bad case of the summertime blues, we've got the cure: a trip to the beach.\n\n“Can’t Feel My Face” by The Weeknd\n\nReleased back in 2015, “Can’t Feel My Face” officially established The Weeknd as a superstar and this bass-driven tune is exactly the kind of head-nodding summer song your playlist calls for.\n\n“Let’s Get Loud” by Jennifer Lopez\n\nWho can forget J. Lo’s sizzling halftime performance at the 2020 Super Bowl with fellow pop star Shakira?
