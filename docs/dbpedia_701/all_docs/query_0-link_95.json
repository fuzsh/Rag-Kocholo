        "text": "Richards showed rarely seen romantic maturity and musical subtlety on this haunting gospel hymn. It features a sax solo by Wayne Shorter, recorded at 5:30 a.m. during the last Bridges to Babylon session. “I wouldn’t have been able to write songs like that 10, 15 years ago,” he said. Don Was agreed: “It’s the most radical thing on the album. Keith really wrote a sophisticated piece of music.”\n\nWho else could smuggle the word “tits” onto the radio in 1981? Right next to the word “ass”? Only one band, and only one man: Keith Richards, who snarls, chants and wheezes his way through a celebration of his callipygian muse. Of course, he’s still married to the woman he was with when it came out – and their two daughters happen to have the initials T and A.\n\nThe Stones delved into Watergate-era paranoia on this post-Sly Stone funk workout, in which Jagger sings about “some little jerk in the FBI” with a stack of papers on him “six feet high.” It was cut during their last sessions with Taylor, who played bass while Wyman switched over to synthesizer; Taylor laid down what may be the only bass solo on a Stones song.\n\nThe working girl in this song must be one of the Stones‘ toughest and most formidable female characters: She takes the bus to the factory by day, she parties hard and starts fights by night, she makes Jagger wait in the rain for her to get off work. It’s an acoustic Beggars Banquet oddity that feels like a country song yet incorporates tablas, mandolins and a fiddle solo.\n\nDid Jagger ever get the woman from “She’s So Cold” together with the woman from “She Was Hot”? The possibilities are staggering. This hopped-up ode to a steamy babe came with a video in which redheaded actress Anita Morris gets the boys so revved-up the buttons of their trousers pop off. MTV couldn’t take the heat and made them recut it.\n\nThe 1937 Robert Johnson recording is a pillar of blues history, and the aching version on Let It Bleed (reprised heavily on the live album Get Yer Ya-Ya’s Out) is no doubt its most famous cover. Recast with a honky-tonk feel, Jagger wrings pain from the lyrics, and Taylor sets his slide guitar on stun. “I was in awe sometimes listening to Mick Taylor, especially on that slide,” writes Richards in his memoir, paying respect where it’s due.\n\nA lovingly sleazy picture of New York street life, with a raw two-chord riff and a Lou Reed-style tale of a gay hustler who arrives in the big city fresh from the West Coast; he’s determined to get over, whether that means garbage collecting or turning tricks. “A straight gay song,” Jagger called it in Rolling Stone at the time. “I’m not sure why I wrote it. Maybe I came out of the closet.”\n\nRichards cranked out a vintage snarling-guitar punisher while Jagger sounded like a reborn blues warrior, belting lines like “Once upon a time I was your little rooster/Now am I just one of your cocks?” Richards said the riff came in his sleep, “almost like ‘Satisfaction'”; 40 years later, his dreams were better than the reality of mid-’00s rock.\n\nOne of Jagger‘s most potent early sex-god moments was manifest on this Howlin’ Wolf cover, which the band released as a U.K. single in November ’64 against all advice. “We wanted to make a statement,” said Richards, with a challenge to the label: “See if you can get that to the top of the charts, motherfucker.” Sure enough, it hit Number One. Foreshadowing events to come, it was cut without inviting Jones, who laid down his slithering slide part after the fact.\n\nWhy did the Stones call this album Some Girls? “Because we couldn’t remember their fucking names,” as Richards put it at the time. The title song remains one of the Stones’ funniest moments, as Jagger sings about the hard work of womanizing, pursued by groupies who take his money and take his clothes. The roué in the song dishes about his sexual tangles with women around the world (from gentle Chinese girls to prissy Brits to greedy Americans) over a leering blues-grind track that gave him plenty of room to be heard. Jagger’s delivery is boozy and sly, and one line in particular raised hackles: He confesses he doesn’t have the “jam” to satisfy “black girls,” who “wanna get fucked all night.” Predictably, this blew up into a major media controversy. Jagger protested that the song was intended as a joke. As he told Rolling Stone in 1978, “Most of the girls I played the song to like ‘Some Girls.’ They think it’s funny; black girlfriends of mine just laughed. . . . I really like girls an awful lot, and I don’t think I’d say anything really nasty about any of them.”\n\nOne of the first songs Jagger and Richards ever recorded – for a demo the “Blue Boys” gave to Alexis Korner in 1962 – their take on the churning Chuck Berry classic would spur fan frenzy in concert, and it introduced the Stones to America during their Ed Sullivan Show debut later that year. The band’s wildness freaked out the variety-show host. The little girls, however, understood.\n\nRichards called hearing Bob Dylan a “punch in the face,” and this is one of the Stones‘ most Dylanesque moments – a country-rock blast of Highway 61 Revisited surrealism. Jagger walks us through a gallery of holy freaks (“He really looks quite religious/He’s been an outlaw all his life”). Per Richards: “Like Dylan says, ‘To live outside the law, you must be honest.'”\n\nRecorded shortly after Taylor’s departure in 1974, “Hand of Fate” is a growling, funked-up murder fantasy. Wayne Perkins, auditioning to be Taylor’s replacement, played the sterling solo. “There was a spotlight in the middle of the room,” he said of his first meeting with the band. “They wanted to see if I looked like a Rolling Stone, and I hadn’t even played a note for ’em yet.”\n\nEarly in 1965, the Stones hit the Top 20 for the second time (after “Time Is on My Side”) with this wonderfully prickly soul ballad written by Jagger and Richards. With its poking guitar twang and caddish lyrics (“If you try acting sad, you’ll only make me glad”), it’s an early flare-up of Jagger-ian devilry. Fittingly, an alternate take featured a young Jimmy Page on guitar.\n\nOne of the band’s most uncharacteristic ballads is credited as a Jagger–Richards song. But Richards had little to do with it. Taylor’s glistening Santana-esque guitar lines define it, and his extended outro may be the best guitar solo in the Stones catalog. Sadly, it would be a swan song, as he quit the band shortly after it was released, in part, he claimed, for being denied writing credit.\n\nOne of the band’s softest and most tenderhearted ballads (and their only ballad to go Number One), “Angie” was written by Richards while he was being treated for heroin addiction at a clinic in Switzerland. “Once I came out of the usual trauma,” he recalled, “I didn’t feel like I had to shit the bed or climb the walls or feel manic anymore. I just went, ‘Angie, Angie.’ ” Completed during the Goats Head Soup sessions in Jamaica, it became a gently strummed benediction with a processional piano by Nicky Hopkins and strings arranged by Nicky Harrison. “Angie” has inspired much speculation as to its inspiration. Despite writing it at the time of his daughter Angela’s birth, Richards claims the lyrics were just a placeholder that stuck: “I didn’t know Angela was going to be called Angela when I wrote ‘Angie,’ ” he said. “Sometimes you have a hook, a phrase or a word or a name or something, which maybe you don’t even intend to keep. . . . It was just a working title, like, who’s gonna call a song ‘Angie,’ how boring, another chick’s name, ya know.”\n\n“Straight balls-to-the-wall rock & roll,” Richards said of “Live With Me.” Richards and Taylor exchange buzz-gun riffs, and Bobby Keys adds a torrid solo. The naughty lyrics – “The cook, she is a whore/The butler has a place for her behind the pantry door” – are said to be the reason the London Bach Choir didn’t want its name listed in the credits of Let It Bleed.\n\n“Loving Cup” closes the first half of Exile, punctuating a tumultuous, ragged half-hour of rock & roll with a shot of mountain-climbing redemption and lyrical warmth. Originally attempted at London’s Olympic Studios during the Let It Bleed sessions, then revived and finished in early 1972 in Los Angeles, it’s one of several gospel-steeped Exile songs that didn’t come out of the band’s hazy time at Nellcôte. This may account for its very un-basement-y maximalism: Nicky Hopkins’ majestic piano comes on like clouds parting, and the song seems to gather momentum and emotional power as it gathers influences. Jagger goes from self-deprecating come-ons (“I am nitty-gritty and my shirt’s all torn/But I would love to spill the beans with you till the dawn”) to innocent elation (“Feel your mouth kissing me again/What a beautiful buzz”) in a country drawl. The bright soul horns and a backing choir (which probably included an uncredited Gram Parsons) enhance the song’s sense of deeply spiritual gratitude.\n\n“It’s going to be the single,” Jagger enthused about this breakneck rocker, the first song finished for Exile. They immediately took the demo to an L.A. DJ and drove around listening to their work. “It was surreal,” recalled engineer Andy Johns. “Up and down Sunset Strip at nine on a Saturday night. The Strip was jumpin’, and I’m in the car with those guys listening to my mixes.”"
