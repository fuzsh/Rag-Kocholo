        "text": "While this song doesn’t have the same vibe as a lot of songs about Sunday mornings…or rain for that matter, it’s still a cool tune. Of course, it still has a similar story to tell as those other rainy songs. The narrator of the song was left at the altar by his bride to be. I love how the song sticks in part of the wedding march after each verse, a little nod to tradition. Plus, it allows a cool, funky bass line to bring us back into the song.\n\nAs best I can decipher, “Rainy Sunday Morning” was released in 2013. Although the Wikipedia page for Davis doesn’t mention the album at all, you can find Paul Davis and Friends Vol. 2 on multiple digital music services. Davis had a pretty successful career, but “Rainy Sunday Morning” was only a small part of it. His biggest hit came in 1982 with the release of “65 Love Affair,” a song that took the #6 spot on the Hot 100."
