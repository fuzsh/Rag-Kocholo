        "text": "Never thought of doing another thread myself after a while, lol. This is possibly a stupid question anyway, but I had this topic in mind for days and thought of giving it a shot.\n\nIf it comes to live albums, do you prefer the 'classic' 2-LP set format, or rather like one disc only for highlighting certain shows/songs? *\n\nOr do you think a triple-LP set should be the standard? Or is it a case-by-case thing to you, depending on the artist?\n\nWhat do you think of large Live vinyl sets like, for example, Pink Floyd's p.u.l.s.e (4-LP set) or Springsteen's 1975-85 (5-LP set)?\n\nIs Wings Over America too long? Is the Rolling Stones' Still Life too short? | Poll included.\n\n*By the way, I'm thinking of concerts running more than 90 minutes. Certainly there exist (recorded) gigs for only one hour or even shorter. This, of course, can also be discussed here.\n\nAlso, I hope this topic is not a (straight) duplicate, I couldn't find a similar thread via the searching engine.\n\nLittle bump. I had suspicions this was a stupid question. Now thinking of this, I should've called the thread Any live albums you wished were shorter or longer?, instead of what it is now.\n\nI realized that even for me I'm not quite sure which way of LP packaging I prefer for live albums.^^ 2-LP possibly would've been the average answer here anyway, right?\n\nFrom the first Ramones bootleg I got aged 10 35 years ago to this day 75% of the music I listen to is live. Either officially released or bootlegs. Albums are for me a snapshot of the material at a moment in time, the basic blueprints of a song. Live is where the songs are really allowed to breathe and grow and evolve. The 6 Doors albums are great but the live versions of those songs are something else. Machine Head is great but Made In Japan is another level of beast. The Who’s live stuff I’ll take over their albums any day. I could go on.\n\nI also if I think I will like a band avoid their stuff if I see they are coming through town, I prefer to be hit with new material in a live setting than sitting down to an album.\n\nLive is how I like my music best.\n\nI don't really care for live albums.\n\nHowever, there are a few songs I prefer live (What Am I Living For by Mark-Almond, or Only You Can Rock Me by UFO).\n\nAnd Dire Straits' live Alchemy is excellent; I don't have much else by that band. I probably wouldn't even have bought that had I not heard it in its entirety on the radio one night after midnight."
