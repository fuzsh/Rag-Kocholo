        "text": "A&E: Rick Springfield, stripped down\n\nAfter writing his 2010 autobiography, “Late, Late at Night,” singer-songwriter Rick Springfield realized he had a lot of stories that go along with his songs.\n\nThey’re stories that you can’t squeeze in between electric versions of “Jessie’s Girl” and “Affair of the Heart” while playing for a standing room-only crowd. So Springfield decided to change his show for his “Stripped Down” tour. It’s just the singer, an acoustic guitar and the stories that inspired them.\n\n“While I was writing the book I realized that most of my stories have a song at the end of them,” Springfield said. “They’re mostly humorous and light-hearted. This isn’t like playing with my band, where it’s very high energy and loud. This is kind of like playing in a living room.”\n\nThe switch meant making some big changes for some tunes, like “Affair of the Heart,” which was keyboard-driven in its original version. But Springfield said he has done most of his writing on the guitar, so it was easy to take his tunes back to just six strings.\n\nThe show, of course, includes Springfield’s biggest hits, but also a few tracks he has never played live, along with a song he wrote when he was 15, and one song written especially for the tour.\n\nIn May fans will be able to see another side of Springfield when he releases his first novel, “Magnificent Vibration.” Springfield was inspired to do more writing after working on “Late, Late at Night,” and came up with the story of a man who discovers an 800 number for God in a self-help book.\n\n“It’s very dark humor,” Springfield said. “It’s about a 32-year-old guy who has just had a brutal divorce, hates his life and thinks life is one long, dull road. I’m ready to write more. I love it. The autobiography did very well and the pre-reviews are great on this. Like, from serious literary magazines who love to ram on rock stars who think they can write books.”\n\nWhether it’s a song or a book, Springfield said his creative process is usually the same. He goes off somewhere with a guitar or his laptop (he said much of his book writing is done on planes) and keeps everything to himself as long as possible.\n\n“I actually started writing the book while on vacation in Australia at my mom’s house; basically where I started writing songs,” Springfield said. “I have to be alone — no distractions. I love that I don’t need an audience. I can sit somewhere and just do it.\n\n“I don’t show it to anyone until I think I’ve done all I can do,” Springfield said. “I don’t do that with songs, either. When it’s finished I’ll reluctantly show it to someone. But I never feel like it’s ready to show someone.”\n\nRick Springfield\n\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Saturday\n\nWHERE: Hoyt Sherman Place, 1501 Woodland Ave.\n\nCOST: $50-$65"
