        "text": "Fans of the late 1970s heard the name Paul Davis all over the radio with his two hits “Sweet Life” and “I Go Crazy.” In 1978, “I Go Crazy” held the record for the longest appearance of a single, being on the charts for 40 weeks (Barry Manilow covered the song on his 1996 album Summer of ’78, where the song made the AC charts). Davis was known as a songwriter mainly after 1982, where he penned the country #1 hits “Meet Me In Montana,” recorded by Dan Seals and Marie Osmond, and co-wrote Seals’ “Bop” in 1986. His 1981 album Cool Night (his last studio album), was filled with a blend of pop and soul tracks and included two charted songs that gave him the last run as a solo act.\n\nThe title track, “Cool Night” is not just one of my favorite songs from the 1980s, but is listed as one of my favorite ballads from any era. This song hit #11 on the pop charts and #2 on the adult contemporary chart. This is a track I list as one of the most romantic songs in pop music, with its catchy chorus and strong guitar strums. For some reason, much like Richard Marx’s “Endless Summer Nights,” gets lumped in as a summer track, but the lyrics talk about the fall, where the nights are getting colder, and “summer has come and gone.” This is one of the earlier rock songs I heard on the radio, where I was mainly listening to country acts at the time. This was a track I would anxiously wait to hear every week on Casey Kasem’s American Top 40 radio show, and see how far the song was going to rise.\n\n“You Came To Me” keeps the light rock, radio-friendly pop sounds going, with strong backing vocals. The backing vocals on the album were mostly done by The Commodores, who were recording in the same studio as Davis at the time.\n\n“One More For The Lonely” is filled with great songwriting lyrics, and has a heavy produced drum sound with the programming sound to it, and strong keyboards. The album has three straight great tunes starting it off.\n\nA cover of a song made famous by The Supremes (after Diana Ross left the group), “Nathan Jones,” is next. Although this isn’t one of my favorites on the album, it still has a soul style to it, but the production of the drums can barely be heard. If there was a song I would skip, it is this one and would prefer to listen to the version by The Supremes.\n\nA deep cut gem on the album is “Oriental Eyes.” This has a soul sound, similar to what Hall and Oates were putting out at the time, and along with the organ sound on the keys, this is a song many may not know about from Davis that should be checked out. In today’s PC culture, the song would get flack, although there is nothing racial in the lyrics. Go check out this song because it is a vastly underrated song that should have been a single.\n\nThe second single that gave this album legs was the pop-flavored “’65 Love Affair,” which still gets played on retro ’80s music shows across the country. The story goes that Davis originally called it ” ’55 Love Affair,” but the label stated that Davis would only been seven years old at the time of that year, and changed the decade ten years later where he would be seventeen and would make more sense. Without looking at the song that way historically, lyrically the song is filled with references to drive-ins, doo-wop music, and simple rock and roll songs from a man looking back at his youth. This is a great nostalgia tune, for fans of Grease, Sha Na Na, and other early rock music pioneers.\n\n“Somebody’s Getting To You” continues that theme, with the lyrics talking about the narrator mentioning a Firebird car, and another person’s books in the girl’s locker. This has similar format songwriting and to the 1970s Jackson Browne’s music. This is another great rare cut off the album that many may not know unless they had the album.\n\nWhere the cover of “Nathan Jones” did not live up to the original, “Love Or Let Me Be Lonely” fits well with the overall flow of the album and is as good, if not better, than The Friends Of Distinctions’ 1970 hit. The strong soul feel of the tune, made the song hit #40 on the Hot 100 chart, and #11 on the AC chart.\n\n“What You Say About Love” goes to a pop/rock sound that would fit well with the music of Huey Lewis and The News, who was just breaking with their Picture This release. The lyrics discuss the girl having opinions on everything from astrology and world politics, but the singer asks her what does she know about love. There is a great guitar solo on here and has a more live drum sound than the other songs that have the programming style to it. This is a great pop-rock song, which shows how Davis could write and create not only soft rock but strong guitar tunes as well.\n\nThe B-Side to ” ’65 Love Affair” ends the album. “We’re Still Together” has bluesy guitar fills throughout, and has a format the fans of the band Player would enjoy. This is a funk/pop format that ends the album nicely.\n\nOverall the album only has one bad track on it for my liking, and that is “Nathan Jones.” However, it is not bad enough that the listener has to skip, but compared to all the other songs, it is my least favorite. Cool Night was his highest-charting album, and the rumors were that he became frustrated by the overall pop production that he got out of his contract from Arista, even though he had great success with this record. Regardless, the album is filled with wonderful songwriting and catchy pop and soul work that is still enjoyable to listen to today, after all these years, and brings back the feeling of the AM radio formats.\n\nTrack List: 1. Cool Night 2.You Came To Me 3. One More Time For The Lonely 4. Nathan Jones 5.Oriental Eyes 6. ’65 Love Affair 7. Somebody’s Getting To You 8. Love Or Let Me Be Lonely 9.
