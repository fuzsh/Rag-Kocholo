        "text": "I loved his song 'I Go Crazy'...my condolences to his family!\n\nACKSON, Mississippi (AP)- Singer-songwriter Paul Davis, who\n\nhad a hit with the soft rock hit \"I Go Crazy,'' has died.\n\nDavis died Tuesday at a hospital in Meridian, Mississippi, the city where he grew up. He died of a heart attack, according to his cousin, James Edwards. Davis had just turned 60 on Monday.\n\n\"I Go Crazy'' peaked at number seven in 1977 eight months after\n\nits release. It then stayed in the Top 100 for 40 more weeks, according to Billboard.\n\nDavis also had hits with \"65 Love Affair,'' and \"You're Still New To Me,'' a country duet with Marie Osmond.\n\nEdwards says Davis came back to Mississippi after living in New York and Nashville so he could retire. He says Davis \"was living life at the slow pace that suited him.''\n\n(Copyright 2008 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)"
