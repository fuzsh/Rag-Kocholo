His career encompassed soul, country, and pop. His most successful songs are 1977’s “I Go Crazy”, a No. 7 pop hit that once held the record for the longest chart run on the Billboard Hot 100, and 1982’s “’65 Love Affair”, which at No. 6 is his highest-charting single. Another pop hit, “Cool Night”, was released in 1981. In the mid-1980s, he also had two No. 1 country hits as a guest vocalist on songs by Marie Osmond and Tanya Tucker.\n\nCool Night is the seventh and final studio album by singer/songwriter Paul Davis, released November 30, 1981. It was his highest-charting album in the United States, reaching #52 on the Billboard album chart, and yielded three top-40 singles, “Cool Night”, “’65 Love Affair”, and “Love or Let Me Be Lonely”. The third was a remake of a song by The Friends of Distinction. This album was the first to be both recorded and mixed fully digitally. It features backing vocals by the Commodores who were simultaneously recording their 1981 album In the Pocket.\n\n“Cool Night” 3:40\n\n“You Came to Me” 3:38\n\n“One More Time for the Lonely” 4:09\n\n“Nathan Jones” 3:27\n\n“Oriental Eyes” 4:28\n\n“’65 Love Affair” 3:54\n\n“Somebody’s Gettin’ to You” 3:30\n\n“Love or Let Me Be Lonely” 3:41\n\n“What You Got to Say About Love” 3:53\n\n“We’re Still Together” 3:40"
