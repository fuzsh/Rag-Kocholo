        "text": "I have the original Japanese CD pressing on ARISTA #BVCA-2009 (Cover says 9/21/91 on it) I don't know whether you are aware of this or not, but the Japanese Cd has a different cover than the U.S. album had. This CD has a picture of a lighthouse, trees, the sun and a bird flying on it!\n\nP.S. The sound is NOT all that full on this release. One of the few Japanese CD I own, that I can say this about!\n\nChris C\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nSo the Arista #BVCA-2009 from 1991 is the original pressing? I have a lead on a copy that starts with a 32RD catalog number (those were usually the early issues in Japan), but I have not been able to verify the year of release.\n\nI did see on a PAUL DAVIS webite that they list the CD you have as the first, so i'll go with that!\n\nI did see the revised cover-art, as well. Honestly, I think it fits the album a bit better than just his face, but I also know that's not what traditionalists (usually me) like.\n\nThanks again for the help.\n\nPS - I sure wish someone would release TELLER OF TALES on CD. Very unjust that it's just sitting in the vaults.\n\nMy favorite Paul Davis album is the self titled BANG album from 1980. I have this album, also on a Japanese CD, issued on SONY. This album had some great non-hits on it, like \"All The Way\" and the semi-religious toned bluesy number called \"When Everything Else Is Gone\", which I just love!\n\nI also have a \"VERY\" rare 2-CD set from WEB IV MUSIC that features many early, rare and even some previously unreleased tracks from Paul, that is a must for a fan of his music.\n\nIt's a shame that ALL of the Paul Davis back catalog sits gathering dust. He was even working on a new album, when he was accidently shot as an innocent bystander, during a bank robbery or something like that about 10 years ago, which has never seen a release. It was supposed to be released on the then reformed, BANG II Records, but the company closed shop, before it ever happened! I believe that SONG/BMG control the masters of all of the old BANG titles today?!?\n\nChris C\n\nOh my...Don't \"EVEN\" get me started on what their thinking over at SONY/BMG? At least they released a few more Roy Orbison titles today, which I'm on my way to check out! I guess that there are enough Culture Club/Boy George fans out there to warrant this huge reissue campaign. I don't know anybody that would claim them as a favorite, but as I keep telling my wife, anything GAY is the new happening thing.\n\nNOTE: NOT THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT!\n\nChris C\n\nFellow Paul Davis fans...\n\nWhen I read these threads I was concerned there were Japanese imports that had slipped by me, but alas no. To my knowledge, his first 4 LPs, A Little Bit of Paul Davis [r. 1972], Ride â€˜Em Cowboy [r. 1974], Southern Tracks & Fantasies [r. 1976], and Singer of Songs [r. 1977] have never seen CD release. The Razor & Tie best of, \"Sweet Life: His Greatest Hit Singles\" is worth tracking down (even though not SH mastered) as it has some tracks not on any of his albums.\n\nThe 2 CD set Chris C mentioned is interesting. Did you find that on ebay? Any place where I can read more about what's on that one? I'd love to hear it."
