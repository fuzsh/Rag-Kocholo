        "text": "As music fans in Central New York and the rest of the world mourn the death of Benny Mardones, many are revisiting the ’80s singer’s songs.\n\nMardones, also known as “The Voice,” died at his California home on Monday after nearly two decades of struggling with Parkinson’s disease. He was 73.\n\nHe was best known for “Into the Night,” one of the few songs to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 twice. The rock ballad appeared on his 1980 album “Never Run, Never Hide,” and hit No. 11 that year; nine years later, an Arizona radio DJ’s “Where Are They Now?” special helped propel the song back to popularity, ascending to No. 20 in America in 1989.\n\nBetween those nine years, he struggled with cocaine and alcohol, and stopped performing after his 1981 album flopped. After his son was born in 1985, he moved to Syracuse to get clean. He successfully kicked the drug habit and began performing again with a local band, The Hurricanes, drawing large crowds of 15,000 at Long Branch Park and 24,000 at Weedsport Speedway.\n\n“When I was addicted to drugs, Syracuse opened its arms to me,” he told syracuse.com in 2017, before playing his final show at the Turning Stone Resort Casino. “It gave me my life back. The fans never wavered. The radio stations played my songs.”\n\nTo this day, the opening notes of “Into the Night” are instantly recognizable to ‘80s music fans and the lyrics — starting with the lines “She’s just sixteen years old / Leave her alone, they say” — are still sometimes debated.\n\nHere are five little-known facts about “Into the Night” by Benny Mardones:\n\n1. “Into the Night” song meaning\n\nWhat does “Into the Night” mean? Is it about a creepy older guy hitting on a 16-year-old girl? Mardones, who co-wrote the song with Robert Tepper, was 33 when it first came out. Tepper, best known for performing “No Easy Way Out” on the “Rocky IV” soundtrack, was 30. And it didn’t help that the music video shows Mardones watching a younger woman through her bedroom window, eventually taking her on a magic carpet ride and kissing her.\n\nBut Mardones has explained many times over the years that the song is not statutory or even sexual. While living in New York’s Spanish Harlem in 1979, he was inspired by three teen neighbors whose father had scored a Broadway hit and ran off with a chorus line girl. He offered to help them and their mother with the rent, paying the kids to run errands and clean his apartment; he gave the 16-year-old, a girl named Heidi, $50 a week to walk his dog named Zanky.\n\nIn 2011, he elaborated on their platonic relationship in an interview with SongFacts.com:\n\n“So one night Robert Tepper and I were up writing songs... And in she walks, 16 years old, dressed for school in a miniskirt, little stacked heels, adorable, 16-going-on-21. She said, ‘You’ve been up all night?’ and of course it was obvious. I said, ‘Yeah, we have.’ She says, ‘Okay, come on, Zanky,’ and she walks the dog out. When she leaves and goes out the door, my partner goes, ‘Oh, my God.’ I said, ‘Hey, Bob. She’s just 16 years old, leave her alone.’ And literally five minutes later I said, ‘Play that lick again, Bobby.’ So he played the lick and I went (singing), ‘she’s just 16 years old, leave her alone, they say.’ Then I thought about her dad and what he had done, and that’s where I got ‘Separated by fools who don’t know what love is yet.’ The chorus was, ‘you’re too young for me, but if I could fly, I’d pick you up and take you into the night and show you love like you’ve never seen.’ Then the verse ‘It’s like having it all and letting it show. It’s like having a dream where nobody has a heart. It’s like having it all and watching it fall apart.’ Because his success was not the family’s success; it was just his. ‘I can’t measure my love there’s nothing compared to it’ - it was all about the abandonment of this family and this 16-year-old girl.”\n\nThey remained friends for years, sending Christmas cards long after she married and moved to Puerto Rico.\n\n2. More than just a one-hit wonder\n\n“Into the Night” is one of just 10 songs to reach the top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 twice. Others include “The Twist” by Chubby Checker (1960 and 1962); “Stand By Me” by Ben E. King (1961 and 1986, thanks to the movie of the same name); “Unchained Melody” by the Righteous Brothers (1965 and 1990, after the song appeared in Patrick Swayze’s “Ghost”); and “Bohemian Rhapsody” by Queen (1976 and 1992, after the epic lip sync scene in “Wayne’s World 2”).\n\nBut “Into the Night” actually charted three times, according to Billboard. DJ Eric Kupper’s 2019 dance remix peaked at No. 35 on the Dance Club Songs charts.\n\nDespite being his only true “hit,” Mardones achieved another form of chart success: The song spent 37 weeks (nonconsecutive) on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, breaking the record set by Laura Branigan’s “Gloria,” according to WFGR. It spent 20 weeks on the chart in 1980 and 17 weeks in 1989. (The record has since been broken by other songs; Syracuse native Post Malone’s 2019 release “Circles” spent 39 weeks in the top 10.)\n\n3. Blacklisted?\n\nMardones said it was tough for “Into the Night” to become a success because radio stations either worried about the song’s subject matter — or had issues with his race.\n\n“When it first was released, R&B stations all over America thought I was black. Then they found out I was white and they dropped the record,” he told SongFacts.com in 2011. “White radio was afraid to touch it because they thought it was about me dating a 16-year-old girl at my age. So Polydor Records sent out like 3,000 letters to radio stations across the country explaining what the song was really about. And the song got added and almost instantly started playing all over America.”\n\n4. Usher and other versions\n\nMardones has recorded multiple versions of “Into the Night” over the years, including a 1989 re-recording on his 1989 self-titled album for Curb Records and an acoustic version for a 2002 compilation. There’s also a 2006 hip-hop version with Conrad Hilton (no relation to the Hilton Hotels family) and 2019 club remixes by Eric Kupper and DJ duo Dirty Werk.\n\nA handful of artists have also covered the song, including Jamaican reggae singer Junior Tucker. His 1991 song, retitled “16 (Into The Night),” was a minor hit in Australia.\n\nUsher — the R&B superstar behind hits “OMG,” “Yeah!” and “U Remind Me” — sampled the track on “Making Love (Into the Night),” featured on his 2010 release “Raymond v. Raymond.” The album went platinum and sold more than 2 million copies worldwide.\n\n5. Breaking Bad\n\nThe song played in a 2009 episode of “Breaking Bad.” On season 2, episode 4 (”Down”), “Into the Night” plays at a convenience store where Walter White (Bryan Cranston) meets with Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul).\n\n“Into the Night” was also featured on a 2014 episode of Aubrey Plaza’s series “Life After Beth” and in the 2016 movie “Nerve” starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco.\n\nMardones is survived by his wife, Jane, as well as his son Michael and sister Louise."
