        "text": "Swifties have 9 Taylor Swift songs to look forward to\n\nThe Amazon Prime Video series “The Summer I Turned Pretty” has made a splash with its loaded soundtrack. By now it is safe to say that “The Summer I Turned Pretty” and Taylor Swift go hand in hand because author and show creator Jenny Han has made it so.\n\nThe first season had five Swift songs ranging from her “Lover” album to “Fearless (Taylor’s Version),” and the Season 1 trailer debuted “This Love (Taylor’s Version)” from the yet-to-be-released re-recorded “1989.” Season 2’s teaser was set to “August,” and then the official trailer debuted “Back to December (Taylor’s Version)” shortly before “Speak Now (Taylor’s Version)” was released July 7. Only time will tell if Season 2 ties Season 1 for how many Taylor Swift songs it contains.\n\nThe sequel season’s summer-y soundtrack also contains hits from repeat artists Olivia Rodrigo, Tyler the Creator, Caroline Polachek and more. A Fleetwood Mac ballad punctuates a particularly emotional scene, and One Direction joins the roster of recruits for the show of the summer. Although only the first three episodes drop when the show premieres July 14, the rest of the episodes are loaded with bangers befitting the emotional tone shift of Season 2.\n\nHere are all the songs in “The Summer I Turned Pretty” Season 2:\n\nSeason 2 Episode 1: Love Lost\n\n“See You Again” (feat.
