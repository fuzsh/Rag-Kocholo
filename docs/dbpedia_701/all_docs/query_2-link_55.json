        "text": "The modern iteration of the Newport Folk Festival has made blending the past and the future its brand, but never was that dynamic more present than at this year’s 65th annual festival. There were, as always, plenty of reminders of the festival’s Sixties heyday: Joan Baez serving as this year’s Newport Patron Saint, mainstage sing-alongs to “This Land Is Your Land” and “We Shall Overcome,” Taj Mahal carrying the folk-blues torch. Even Bob Dylan’s “Maggie’s Farm” was covered multiple times (by Beck and Molly Tuttle) on a single day.\n\nBut this year’s Newport was also a space where the most crowded side-stage set of the weekend belonged to Bertha, a Grateful Dead drag band, where a new generation of artists like Rett Madison and Palmyra made their debuts, where two artists making wildly different music (Allison Russell and Wednesday) each offered moments of mourning for both Palestine and Sonya Massey in their respective sets on competing stages.\n\nMost exciting, as always, was when past and future impulses collided: Gillian Welch and Sierra Ferrell duetting on a folk standard, Killer Mike and De La Soul further solidifying hip-hop’s presence at this folk festival, War on Drugs and Craig Finn covering John Hiatt, or Mavis Staples collaborating with current Top 40 hitmaker Hozier and being driven around in a golf cart all weekend that read “Mavis is Brat.”\n\nHere are just ten of the best performances we saw this year."
