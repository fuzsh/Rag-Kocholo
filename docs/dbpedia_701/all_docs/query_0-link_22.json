        "text": "I love this album, the production, vocals, instruments, it's full of great songs and melodies(especially the song Somebody's Gettin To You). I have not heard any other album like this one. It sounds like music played in a department store or an AM Radio Station during its music time. Anyone else a fan of this album? Anything similar to it?\n\nMost all of Paul's albums are worthy of checking into, especially \"Cool Night\", but John is right that this album needs some work in the \"sound\" department. A remix, if the multi's are still available could bring that '80's recorded, but \"AM Radio sounding\" album to life. I wish that Paul were still with us, as he always sent us fans, some really nice and simple sounds to enjoy.\n\nOk, a three year bump, time to delve into some Paul, either Cool Night on US lp, 'The Japan disc is pretty pricey for a risk buy SQ wise' or recommend a good sounding comp on cd, thanks\n\nEdit:I'd tag NBA about the Yacht Rock comment, but I think he's on vacation"
