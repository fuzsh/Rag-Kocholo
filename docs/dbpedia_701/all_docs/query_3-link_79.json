        "text": "The hirsute singer-songwriter Paul Davis had a half dozen Top 10 hits on the Adult Contemporary chart, but only one Top 10 on the Hot 100: “I Go Crazy,” which reached #7 and, strangely enough, didn’t reach the Top 10 on the AC chart (#25). For a while, it held the record for most weeks (40) on the Hot 100 chart. Casey Kasem said Davis presented it to his record company, begging to have Lou Rawls record it, believing Lou could make it a hit. When they saw how much faith had in the song, they cleaned up his demo and released it himself. I’d have loved to hear Chicago’s own Lou Rawls sing it, but Paul’s version is superb."
