It is often performed after the meal and marks the opening of the dance floor when other family and friends join them on the dancefloor for the rest of the evening.\n\nWho dances with the bride first?\n\nThe groom dances with the bride first. Then traditionally the order of first dances is:\n\nBride dances with her father, and the groom with his mother.\n\nBride dances with her father-in-law, and the groom with his mother-in-law.\n\nThe parents dance with each other\n\nThe bride dances with the best man, and the groom with the maid-of-honour\n\nThe ushers and bridesmaids join, and when the whole wedding entourage has dances together everyone else joins.\n\nHowever, most couples only dance together and with their parents (first 2 steps).\n\nHow do couples choose their song?\n\nMost couples choose a first dance song which was an important song in their relationship. A survey by the American speaker company Sonos revealed that more than half of couples polled (57 per cent) choose their first dance song based on the music they had listened to and reminded them of when they first got together.\n\nIt should also be a song you both feel comfortable dancing to in front of your friends.\n\nShould you choreograph your first dance?\n\nChoreographing your first dance can be a nice way to take some of the awkwardness out of it and impress your guests.\n\nHowever, make sure you don‚Äôt take it too seriously ‚Äì the evening is about having fun after all!\n\nIs the first dance before or after dinner?\n\nUsually ‚Äì after the dinner. Traditionally, it signals the beginning of the dancing part of the reception, so feeding your guests beforehand is a good idea. Full bellies mean full dancefloors!\n\nHow do you make your first dance not awkward?\n\nYour first dance should never be awkward! It‚Äôs a special moment for you and your new spouse to celebrate your marriage after the seriousness of the ceremony.\n\nA few tips for making sure it‚Äôs not awkward are:\n\nChoose a song you both love. The kind of song that when it comes on you both rush to the dance floor\n\nGo for an upbeat song if you‚Äôre not the kind of couple that enjoys slow, smooshy music.\n\nKeep it brief! Dance for a few minutes and then invite your family and friends onto the dancefloor.\n\nChoregraphy. If you like a bit of planning, why not choreograph or at least plan a few moves to pull out so in the heat of the moment you have some reliable shapes to pull out!\n\nPhew! You‚Äôve reached the end of all 500 of our top first dance songs.\n\nWe hope you found the perfect one for your wedding amongst them all.
