        "text": "Berwyn & Virginia <[email protected]>\n\nSep 28, 2016, 10:16 AM\n\nto me\n\nI see you have posted to Richard Stucki on Family Search. I believe he\n\nis the one I went to school with, at South High in 1945. He was Major\n\nin the ROTC. Can you verify if this is also your Dad?\n\nI also read that he served in Nova Scotia under S. Dilwoth Young. I\n\nalso was there, I guess just after him. I was there in 1950. From the\n\ncollege photo I am pretty sure he is one and the same as I knew at\n\nSouth. Please verify.\n\nBerwyn Andrus , Bountiful, UT\n\nMathew Stucki <[email protected]>\n\nSep 28, 2016, 5:07 PM\n\nto Berwyn\n\nHi Berwyn,\n\nEverything you say sounds correct. We should compare notes. Lot's more online posted about my father.\n\nI would love to hear more about your memories of him.\n\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/wa/webuniverse/phmainframe_dad.html#top\n\nThanks for reaching out.\n\nBerwyn & Virginia <[email protected]>\n\nSep 28, 2016, 8:29 PM\n\nto me\n\nMathew Stucki,\n\nI have been in touch with Sgt. Redmond's daughter who posted to her mother on Family Search, which is how I found her. I took the liberty of sharing with her your Dad's experience with Sgt. Redmond as well as my own. My wife, Virginia Agnes Woolley Andrus also was acquainted with your Dad at Institute and Lambda Delt at the U. I didn't notice any great detail of names and place in Nova Scotia other than Halifax and country tracting. I wonder if he mentioned more in detail of Nova Scotia somewhere else. I worked in Halifax, Sidney, Kentville and the Digby country area, and ended up in Yarmouth for my release. I was there from Jan to Dec of 1950. His experience in the valley sounds like a homesteading experience. Very impressive. He was always an impressive person at the top for every experience I had with him.\n\nThanks for sharing. Berwyn and Virginia Andrus, Bountiful\n\nMathew Stucki <[email protected]>\n\nSep 29, 2016, 5:49 AM\n\nto Margie\n\nLook at this. Do you remember anything Dad said about Halifax or his mission? Did he have a mission journal beyond ?\n\nI don't know this person, but it sounds like he read about Dad's journal. He said he went to South High.\n\nHe talks of his wife \"Virginia Agnes Woolley Andrus also was acquainted with your Dad at Institute and Lambda Delt at the U.\"\n\nHe sounds legit, but I don't know this for sure. i guess it can't hurt to correspond.\n\nI will seek more info and stories from him.\n\nMathew Stucki <[email protected]>\n\nThu, Sep 29, 2016, 6:17 AM\n\nto Berwyn\n\nHi Berwyn,\n\nThank you for your kind words.\n\nI am interested in hearing more about my dad's experience with Sgt. Redmond as well as yours.\n\nYou said he was always an impressive person at the top for every experience you had with him.\n\nCan you elaborate? I would love to hear your stories about him.\n\nMargie Stucki <[email protected]>\n\nThu, Sep 29, 2016, 10:55 AM\n\nto me\n\nDear Mat,\n\nAll this sounds right. Remember that stuff I gave you of Dad's missionary scrapbook that was in that heavy looseleaf and I changed it to a less heavy one and put stuff in pocket pages. It had a lot of pictures and postcards. I'll be going for my remicade soon - so this is all for now. Love you, MOM\n\nBerwyn & Virginia <[email protected]>\n\nSep 29, 2016, 9:43 PM\n\nto me\n\nMathew,\n\nI don't have any specific events that trigger a memory. His writing in my yearbook says it all about him. I think he was mistaken about ROTC being optional. It was mandatory as I remember it and some of the big sports men and some of the goof offs thought it was a joke, until Sgt. Redmond explained the facts of life, something like this. \"During this class you belong to the Army, not the school. You will do what I say or I will make sure you will wish you had.\" I remember one of the goof offs tested him and lost, doing pushups and running on the track. He was a big part of my high school life, and was delighted to find him living near my sister in Layton. Sorry that I lost track of him after he moved to St. George.\n\nI thought Richard was a year ahead of me, but find him in the same class. We were both Private, First Class in the 1944 Yearbook. He was Major and second in command his senior year. I was 2nd Lt my senior year. I took the optional third year with two periods of ROTC and before Sgt. Redmond left mid year he pushed through Lt. Col for me, a staff position, not the Commander. Sgt. Redmond ran a very good program and was working hard to get a top notch rifle team. I made the rifle team and we were doing well, with lots of practice time and dedicated rifles, but Sgt. Redmond was forced out to make room for the return of Sgt. McNair who had been there before and was a good friend of the Vice Principal, Miss Dyer. Sgt McNair let things slide and rotated rifles around so we didn't have our own anymore. With no warning we had to fire for the Hearst Trophy competition and were down among the pack again after being 8th the previous year. Well that is how I remember it. It was a different program under Sgt. Redmond. I just checked and as I thought, I didn't have Sgt McNair sign my yearbook.\n\nOn another note, do you have any references to people and places in Nova Scotia? Your Dad mentioned his first companion was Gayle D. Sessions. I believe that this is the Elder that died in the field of Meningitis. I don't think Pres and Sister Young ever really got over that experience. It was too much like the loss of their son in the War. I would think that your Dad would have been aware of that, if I have the correct person. Below is his information from Family Search. Do you find anything in your Dad's writings about him other than first companion and eating snails?\n\nI guess that is more than enough for tonight. It has been a pleasure meeting you and thanks for sharing.\n\nBerwyn and Virginia Woolley Andrus\n\nGale Baird SessionsKWJ6-GF3 ​\n\nBirth\n\n10 June 1923\n\nMilo, Bonneville, Idaho, United States\n\nDeath\n\n20 December 1947\n\nNova Scotia, Canada\n\nContact person who posted his photo: Contact Name VIrginia Dye E-mail Address [email protected]\n\nLink to person: https://familysearch.org/tree/person/KWJ6-GF3/details\n\nMathew Stucki <[email protected]>Sat, Oct 1, 2016, 9:50 AM\n\nto Berwyn\n\nHi Berwyn,\n\nThank you so much.\n\nYour recollection of the ROTC experience and anecdotes there relative to my father are new to me. He spoke often about his ROTC experience, but I failed to glean the detail that you provided.\n\nThanks too, for including the familysearch link to Gale Sessions.\n\nIn reference to Gale B Sessions, he made a significant impact on my father, My dad remembered and spoke of him highly all these years later. There is a small writing of Elder Sessions in my father's journal. My father included excerpts in his missionary journal and one specifically about Elder Sessions. Please feel free to comment on these pages if you have insights you would like to share.\n\nI have a lot more about his mission I have not yet posted, but I will share it with you when I do. May I have your permission to include your descriptions from this conversation in his online journal ?\n\nThanks for the reference to Gale Sessions family search page. My father's information follows:\n\nW Richard StuckiKWZX-QM9​\n\nBirth21 August 1928\n\nSalt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah, United States\n\nDeath27 February 2008\n\nSalt Lake City, Salt Lake, Utah, United States\n\nContact person who posted his photo: Contact Name Mathew Stucki E-mail Address [email protected]\n\nLink to person: https://familysearch.org/tree/person/KWZX-QM9/details\n\nPerhaps you can find some significant references to people and places in Nova Scotia there. As I said there is much more coming.\n\nThanks again.\n\nBerwyn & Virginia <[email protected]>\n\nSat, Oct 1, 2016, 2:01 PM\n\nto meMathew, You can include whatever have written. Just remember that I am an old man with maybe more imagination than memory anymore. I will look around in your online materials and see if I spot anything. Names you might find in your Dad's writings that I knew are: Elder Shroader, Elder Hammond, Elder Adams, Sawler family in Kentville, Ben and Honey Kyte in Kentville. Elder Staheli, Bezanson in Kentville. I will see if I can come up with any others.\n\nBerwyn\n\nBerwyn & Virginia <[email protected]>\n\nOct 1, 2016, 3:36 PM\n\nto me\n\nMathew, here are a couple of links that you might tie in with your Dad\n\nBerwyn\n\nhttps://familysearch.org/photos/artifacts/14780234?p=2284601&returnLabel=Ronald%20Roy%20Schroader%20(KW4T-LQ5)&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffamilysearch.org%2Ftree%2Fperson%2FKW4T-LQ5%2Fmemories\n\nhttps://familysearch.org/tree/person/KW4T-LQ5/memories\n\nActually the last link will take care of both photos. I visited Elder\n\nHammond a few weeks before he passed away, and have a photo of him\n\nthen. He was also at South High and your Dad might have known him there.\n\nMathew Stucki <[email protected]>\n\nSat, Oct 1, 2016, 4:43 PM\n\nto Berwyn\n\nHi Berwyn,\n\nWhen you sent me this email, it included a nicely formatted link to the information in familysearch regarding Gale B Sessions.\n\nDid Familysearch.org do that for you or did you create it yourself? Very nice. Could you tell me how you did that?\n\nThank you for the names and links. All this information is a treasure trove of memories.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nMathew\n\nBerwyn Andrus <[email protected]>\n\nSat, Oct 1, 2016, 5:39 PM\n\nto me\n\nI highlight the name, control number and birth and death dates on the tree view and do Control C to copy and then I keep a Word Perfect file of people I might want to tag or refer to. It comes in handy for a lot of things. I do have to do some delete and backspace to get the final format. I will send a link to the Sawlers when I get back home in case you have any Kentville references. We drove back in 1989 and visited Kentville, a few days and Church. Most of the people I knew were still there. It was a great time. I still have a couple of folks that I am in touch by email\n\nThere is also a photo of a conference in a Kentville with Newfoundland Elders. I have tried to tag all, but any living are hard to find. Deceased are pretty easy on Family Search.\n\nThanks fit all Berwyn\n\nBerwyn & Virginia <[email protected]>\n\nAttachments\n\nSat, Oct 1, 2016, 10:02 PM\n\nto me\n\nMathew: Here is link to Sawler. She was baptized in June of 1949 and\n\nmeetings were held in her kitchen. Is there any mention of Kentville in\n\nyour Dad's Journal?\n\nLink to Sawler: https://familysearch.org/tree/person/KWD3-BXH/memories\n\nLink to Elder Schroeder:\n\nhttps://familysearch.org/tree/person/KW4T-LQ5/memories\n\nLink to Sister Ferguson:\n\nhttps://familysearch.org/tree/pedigree/K4TS-91G/landscape\n\nI did meet Sister Ferguson a few times when I was in Sydney and we\n\ntraveled over to Glace Bay to visit her.\n\nI believe that she lived at 15 Hickman St. Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, and I\n\nhave a leaf that I saved from there. I have attached a photo of it.\n\n(who can question my memory now? I did google and the address checks good)\n\nI have looked at your postings and don't find Kentville mentioned.\n\nThis is pretty mixed up because it is late, but just saw a photo of\n\nElder Marv Hammond just before he passed away, so attached it just in\n\ncase it is of interest.\n\nEnough is enough for today. Hope all is well with you.\n\n​\n\nBerwyn"
