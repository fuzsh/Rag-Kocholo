        "meta_description": "Hyrum had a legacy of faith to live up to. Both of Hyrum’s parents were converts to the Church. Hyrum’s father, Jacob Hans Jensen, came from Denmark and traveled to Utah with a handcart company in 1857. Hyrum’s mother, Juliana Marie Andersen, joined the church in Denmark and came to Utah in the early days of the first railroad in Utah. Hyrum was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on December 1, 1881. Hyrum was the sixth of nine children. His brothers and sisters older than him were Maria Sophia Amelia, Juliana Marie, Sarah Anne, Jacob, and Joseph Hans. Of the five older than him, only Hyrum’s two oldest sisters were alive when he was born. His brothers and sisters younger than him were Jacob Christian, Osia Maria Lillie, and Anna Margrethe. When Hyrum was about one and a half years old, his family moved from 883 East and 800 South in Salt Lake City to a little west of Highland Drive on 2700 South in the Millcreek area, farm country about two miles from downtown Salt Lake City. In Millcreek Hyrum’s father built a three-room brick house. Hyrum’s family and his uncle Jim’s family lived together. At this time, all of the members of the family, except Hyrum and his mother, were stricken with diphtheria, a serious disease that can be fatal. Hyrum recalled seeing a woman nurse the sick, swabbing their throats to help relieve the soreness. When Hyrum was between two and three years of age, he got into a vat of slaking lime, a substance used to cure animal fat into soap. He almost lost his sight from the lime because chemical burns from slaking lime are usually permanent, and sometimes even fatal. Under the direction of his Heavenly Father and the tender, loving care of his mother, his sight was saved. About one year later he had another brush with tragedy. There was a canal nearby Hyrum’s house; it was about eight feet wide and filled with water two feet deep. The stream fascinated Hyrum, and his faithful big, black Newfoundland dog tried to protect him from the danger of the water. One day when Hyrum reached the bridge, he fell into the water. The barking of Hyrum’s dog alarmed his mother. She discovered Hyrum on the canal bank recovering from his fall. The dog had saved Hyrum’s life and had created within him a love of dogs that lasted throughout his life. Hyrum always liked training and tending horses. One day when his father hitched the team to the wagon to make a visit at the home of a friend, John W. Young, Hy was told that he could not go, but he followed on foot anyway. When he arrived at his destination his father asked John what he would do with the boy. John replied that if Hyrum liked to walk so much he could walk the two miles home. He did. The first night that Salt Lake City was going to be lighted with electricity, the family hiked a few blocks east of their home to higher ground to witness the beautiful sight. There they saw city lights for the first time. In about 1890, when Hyrum was nine years old, his family moved to a farming community called Big Cottonwood (now Holladay). They purchased a fruit farm and raised apples. At first they lived in an adobe house, but they later built a new brick house and moved into it. At times they rented the old house to other people. Houses were scarce and many times more than one family lived in the same house. Hyrum attended the 28th District School. At that time, there were no centralized school districts like there are today. A district school consisted of one building, one teacher, and all of the students from grades one to eight, or one to twelve. In school Hyrum had to memorize things—that was hard for him. One day when he was unprepared and hadn’t done his homework, the teacher told him to stand in a corner of the room as a punishment. While in the corner, he made faces at the other children so the teacher ordered him to face the wall. While he was facing the wall, he drew pictures on the blackboard. The teacher gave up and ordered him back to his desk. Hy loved horses. The first one he owned was a wild one, which he purchased for only twenty-five dollars. He managed to train it to do multiple jobs and he did it in a short amount of time because he was a good trainer. One day, Hyrum was riding his horse and driving some colts. The horse wanted to run along with the other horses, which made for a dangerous situation for Hyrum because the horses would run wild. Hyrum could not stop the horse easily so he had to slide his hand along the neck of the horse and down to its nose so he could shut off its breath. The horse stopped more quickly than Hyrum did. Hy was thrown to the ground. Onlookers said that he walked about one hundred yards to the house and made his way through the kitchen, dining room, and bedroom three times before he really regained his senses. He only suffered from a lump on his head and a broken shoulder. Hyrum purchased a horse and buggy and drove it to his school, Granite Stake Academy, a high school several miles from his home. His willingness to find a way to get to school shows his dedication to his education. He also attended the academy because of a certain little girl who had kicked his shins while they were in grade school, Ann Eliza Andrus. After high school Hyrum attended the University of Utah for almost a year. He received more formal education than most people of his time. At that time, bishops in the church had the responsibility to enforce laws and keep order and peace in the community. Hyrum’s bishop and Ann’s father, Milo Andrus, asked Hyrum to serve as deputy sheriff, helping to keep the peace, which he did. The next winter Hyrum took a missionary preparatory course at the L.D.S. College, seeking to better prepare himself to serve a mission for the church. In those days, if you wanted to serve a mission, you had the responsibility to pay for everything yourself as you went along—there was no centralized money system for the missionaries like there is today. Missionaries sometimes relied on the generosity of people they served or took odd jobs to earn the money they needed. Hyrum assisted his father with the farm work the following summer until his mission call came. He sold all of his worldly possessions: a team of horses, a wagon, and his tools. Then he gave the money to his father to help pay for his mission. Before his mission, Hyrum’s mother wanted him to receive his endowment and then act as proxy to do the work for her father, Andrew Christian Andersen, who had recently died. Hyrum said that the most inspirational experience of his lifetime was in the sealing room as he acted proxy for his grandfather. After the sealing ordinance was performed, his mother cried for joy and said that her dream had come true. Hyrum was called to the Northern States Mission and he labored in southern Illinois in the towns of Bloomington, Quincy, Danville, Mt. Vernon, and Dequoyne. Missionary work in those days was quite different than it is today. Missionaries served in “conferences,” districts of the church where stakes and wards weren’t yet organized. In addition to proselyting, missionaries were responsible to provide leadership in small branches of the church and keep the records of the church in the places they served. While in Mt. Vernon, Hyrum served as conference secretary, keeping track of the membership records, a responsibility somewhat like a stake clerk today. Hyrum had copied into a small pocket notebook the names of all the members of the church and their addresses. This information helped him when he was assigned with a Canadian Elder to visit all of the members of the church in the large conference, one hundred eighty of them. The church records were sometimes inaccurate and the members were spread far apart; sometimes the members received little contact with the church. After all, they didn’t have phones, radios, fast cars, email, and fax machines like we do now. Hyrum and his companion were assigned to locate new members and to visit all the members, determining their spiritual and temporal needs, giving encouragement, and strengthening their faith. It took them considerable time and walking to accomplish the task. Before Hyrum’s assignment was completed, he was called to act as the mission secretary—an assistant to the mission president of sorts. He was assigned to write letters every month to all of the saints and Elders, keeping them posted of the activities in the mission. He also had to orient all of the new missionaries when they arrived in the mission field. The mission president had to spend all of his available time in visiting the saints and supervising the Elders. Hyrum’s assignments kept him quite busy, but when he had spare time he spent it tracting for a few days at a time with new missionaries until they were assigned to a regular companion. A faith-promoting incident of Hyrum’s mission occurred when he was transferred from Quincy to Decatur. He was waiting at the station when the train left without him. He had to go back to the office and report to the mission president. The president told him not to worry because there was some reason that he didn’t board that train. Later Hyrum learned that the first train he was going to board had wrecked—he had been blessed to be on the next one to leave instead. Near the close of his mission, Hyrum was sent with a newly arrived Elder to locate two missionaries who had not been heard from for several weeks. Hyrum and his companion found them in the eastern part of Illinois staying in the home of members. One of them was sick with malaria. They sent a report to the mission office and received instructions for the two healthy Elders to act as companions and engage in regular missionary labors, while Hyrum stayed with the sick Elder. Under the careful attention of the members and Hyrum, the Elder soon recovered and was able to travel. A short time later, Hyrum was released from his mission. He had to pay for his transportation home himself, so he arrived in the Salt Lake City with five cents in his pocket, just enough for his streetcar fare. Hyrum spent two years and four months in the mission field, from April 28, 1903, to September 12, 1905. After his mission, Hyrum rented a three-hundred-acre ranch to make a living. He hired a crew and directed the work. On the ranch, they did “haying”—cutting, drying, hauling, and stacking hay and storing it to feed the livestock in the wintertime. The ranch that Hyrum rented was at the foot of the mountain and rattlesnakes were plentiful there. Hyrum saw many of them because he spent much of his time irrigating. As water ran through the fields, it would flood out the snakes. The snakes came to the higher ground in a fighting mood; he sometimes killed as many as five of six of them in one day. One morning, he was working in a ditch when he heard a rattling sound behind him. There lay a big, coiled snake within striking distance. Hy didn’t stop to argue with it or wonder what he could do. He just ran. One evening on the ranch, Hy and one of the other men were out by a water hole where they took horses and cows to drink. They were training a three-year-old colt to lead. The rope they were using got caught around the colt’s neck and Hyrum’s ankle. When the colt got scared and ran off it dragged Hyrum with it. He was behind the horse face down with his gloved hands spread out so that he was not rolling. Finally the horse changed direction and headed for the corral. Hy spent a several rough moments wondering how he would ever get through the gate without losing his leg. But, as the horse went through the gate, the rope miraculously slipped from Hy’s ankle. Bishop Andrus, Ann’s father, jokingly told Hy when he returned from his mission that if he did not get married at the end of ten years, he would recommend him for another mission call. Once again, Hyrum was frequently visiting at the home of the bishop to see the great attraction there. That great attraction was the middle child of the family, Ann Eliza. Undoubtedly, she proved hard to get. She was a vivacious, friendly, cheerful person, and she had many friends and other interests to divert her attention. It took Hyrum five years to convince her that he was the man she desired. It drew near to Thanksgiving Day of 1910. When Hyrum and Ann finally decided to get married, they were married in record time. One Tuesday evening Ann gave her consent to Hyrum talking to her parents about the marriage. He was at the bishop’s home early the next morning. He received the consent of her parents and her father issued a temple recommend. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple that day. The day after they were married, Hyrum and Ann ate Thanksgiving dinner with his family in Huntsville, Utah, to tell them about their marriage. Hyrum and Ann made their home at Holladay and managed the Jensen fruit farm. On September 30, 1911, their first child, a daughter they named Elena, was born. Two years later, on September 5, 1913, sandy-haired Elaine arrived, and on November 5, 1915, came dark-haired Mildred. In 1916 the fruit crop was completely destroyed by a severe frost. Friends had offered Hyrum some good jobs in Salt Lake City, but he didn’t want to work in the crowded city and he preferred the country life. He wanted to earn money as a result of his own planning more than earn it under the direction of another person. Hyrum and his father had to make a decision that would help both of them. As that time Hyrum’s father owned two farms, one at Holladay and the other at Huntsville. The Huntsville farm had been purchased because Juliana Marie, Hyrum’s mother, enjoyed better health there, but now she had passed away; Jacob, Hyrum’s brother, had also died a few weeks before his mother. They decided that Hy and his family should move to Huntsville and his father should return to Holladay. Hyrum and his youngest sister’s husband, Adam W. Schade, formed a partnership. They leased additional land and worked together very profitably for six years. For their first year in Huntsville, Hy and Ann rented a house; at the beginning of the next year, they bought a house. Soon after they settled in Huntsville Hyrum was called to serve as the ward clerk. He worked closely with the bishop and his two counselors, men he came to know and respect. Bookkeeping had never appealed to Hyrum. In meetings of the bishopric, they discussed all problems and agreed upon decisions thoroughly before they took any action. Hyrum said that he recalled just one time that a family in the ward that was in need of help. The bishop helped them immediately. At the next meeting he asked forgiveness of his counselors for not consulting them before he acted. Hy served as ward clerk while the bishop presided. During this time he was called into the seventies quorum and became its senior member, meaning that he had the responsibility for all of the missionary work in the stake. He was released from this position soon after the release of the bishopric. Later he was ordained as a high priest. It was during their first year in Huntsville that Hyrum and Ann’s first great trial came. Their daughter Mildred became sick with scarlet fever. Because there weren’t antibiotics to treat a contagious disease like scarlet fever, the sick were quarantined (isolated from other people so that the disease didn’t spread). Hyrum and Ann called the doctor—he decided that Ann should leave the home and Hy’s oldest sister, Marie McDonald, should come and nurse Mildred. Mildred was very ill, but with the aid of the doctor, the nurse, and the faith and prayers of her family, she recovered. While Mildred was in quarantine, Ann gave birth to her first son on April 12, 1918. Hyrum and Ann were pleased with this redhead and named him Jacob for Hy’s father and Andrus for Ann’s maiden name. Ann became pregnant again and expected to have twins. Hy called for the doctor on the morning of March 14, 1920, and was greeted with this information: the doctor had found albumen in the sample that he took. Ann was losing fluids and it was dangerous to her and the babies. The doctor thought there was nothing they could do about it. Ann was soon unconscious. The doctor told Hyrum to hold up her chin. If he let her chin drop, her tongue would drop, she would choke, and she would die. Two boys were born. The doctor, thinking that the birth was over, concluded that Ann wouldn’t get better until the afterbirth came. Instead, she gave birth to another boy. Ann was not regaining consciousness. Word was sent to the church to have someone come and give Ann a priesthood blessing. After the ordinance, Ann regained consciousness and said, “Hello, Brother Lofgreen.” Hyrum and Ann named the three triplets Willard Andrus, William Andrus, and Willis Andrus. While the first two boys were being born, Hyrum had no knowledge of what was happening. During this time, he saw in vision three men standing on an elevation, a sort of bench. The center man was about eight inches higher than the other two. He was talking to a great number of Indians who were sitting on the ground facing him and listening attentively. They seemed pleased at what he was saying. Sometime later President David O. McKay came to administer to Willard who was very ill. While he was there, he gave Ann a grand and glorious blessing—one of the greatest Hy had ever listened to. When President McKay was leaving the house he said that Willard was very sick. Hy told him of the vision he had at the time of their birth. President McKay replied that the vision made a difference and that the boys would go teach the Lamanites on a mission. The triplets later served in the Spanish American Mission. While Ann and Hy were in Mesa, Arizona, later in their lives, they attended a meeting where President and Sister McKay were the speakers. After the meeting, Hy and Ann talked to them and President McKay said, “I see three little boys and a prophecy fulfilled. Am I right?” In the fall of 1921 Ann had gone with the children to Holladay to stay with Hy’s sister Elizabeth, who had volunteered to help them with the children. On New Year’s Day of 1922 Ann had twins. They were named Milo Andrus and Elizabeth Marie. The family later returned to Huntsville. Meanwhile, Hyrum and Ann’s children grew older. At the age of twelve Mildred became ill again. The doctor said she should be in the hospital. He took Ann and Mildred in his car. Ann slept on a cot in Mildred’s room. A few days later, the doctor called for Hy to come. Hy asked him what he should do. The doctor replied that he shouldn’t leave the hospital without his permission but instead should stay there with Mildred. Two weeks of prayer, fasting, and daily priesthood blessings followed. Hy slept on chairs in the halls and in the reception room of the hospital. One day Hyrum and Ann were standing looking at Mildred. She had not spoken during this time because she was in a coma. Hy said to Ann, “Shall we let Heavenly Father have her?” Ann replied, “I think so, if you do.” They knelt at Mildred’s bedside and gave their consent to the Lord for her death. In about five minutes, Mildred left for the spirit world. All they had left of her was a beautiful memory and the knowledge that they had done all they could for her. During the two weeks that Mildred was in the hospital, the neighbors cared for Hyrum and Ann’s children and livestock. During that time, they never even thought of their cows or other work. Hyrum and Ann moved into Huntsville with very little of this world’s possessions, but they left in more prosperous circumstances and learned of the goodness of Heavenly Father to them. In 1929 they had a chance to buy a large farm in Marion, Summit County, Utah. After seeking advice from their stake president and bishop, they decided to move. Hyrum wanted to move from Huntsville to Marion, Utah, to get away from town. He wanted to find a place for his children away from the city where his children would have lots to do and where he could control their lives better. Ann and Hyrum took their family, cows, machinery, and furniture and started to make a new home in Marion. It was during the time of the Great Depression when money was tight and many people were in difficult financial circumstances. Hyrum and Ann had debts and two farms to pay for and no way to pay. Hy’s sister Elizabeth bought the Huntsville farm by paying back-taxes and interest. This left them with the Marion farm and debts and left them poor indeed. They wondered why then but later learned that poverty was a blessing to them. Hyrum and Ann made many good memories in Marion. Their home was on the foothills, about one-half mile from the main road and the nearest neighbors. Their children all grew up together—all nine of them were born within ten years and three months of each other. The work hours were long and hard, but there was a lot of sunshine, fresh air, good food, and exercise to make strong bodies and healthy minds. They learned to enjoy each other. They had a lot of fun at the big bonfires; at softball games; on trips to the hills for wood; and doing sleigh riding, skiing, and singing. In Marion Hyrum served as the ward clerk again. He also served as the scoutmaster and as superintendent of the Y.M.M.I.A (young men’s president). One day Hyrum and his sons had loaded a nice load of green quaking aspen and straight poles. The boys had started down the hill ahead of him and were nearly at the bottom when he started. The hill was so steep that the load was soon traveling too fast. He yelled at the boys to move. They moved. They lost their brakes and the horses couldn’t control the weight of the load. Hyrum tried to stop himself and the horses from getting smashed into several tons of logs. That was a very dangerous spot to be in, so he jumped to the side of the road still holding tightly to the lines. Before the horses had reached the bottom he had been thrown against one tree, bounced back against the wagon, and thrown against another tree. He was rather shaken up, but he got back on the wagon determined not to slide off the front again. The front wagon gear bounced over some large rocks, and he fell into the dirt on his head and shoulders. One day a bull escaped into the neighbor’s field. Milo brought him home. Hyrum was going to lock him up in a new bullpen they had made. He threw a rope on the bull and tied him to a post, fastening the rope using the ring in the bull’s nose. Hy noticed that the bull was not feeling friendly so he carefully led him toward the pen. Hyrum turned his back just long enough for the bull to hit him and send him sprawling. Hyrum reached a big rock, threw it with all his force, and hit the bull right between the eyes. The bull was dazed long enough for Hy to get to his feet and wrap the bull to the nearest post. Hyrum’s clothes were torn from his back from being pulled around by the bull. He was also in a delicate condition for a few days. On another occasion, they were mowing hay in Marion for Ann’s brother Joseph. One evening Milo stopped the tractor while it was in gear. Early the next morning, Jake and Hy went to work. Jake worked piling the dry hay and Hy worked cutting the hay. Hy took the crank and the engine turned over immediately. Then the tractor started to move forward. In no time at all, Hyrum’s foot was caught between the two front wheels with a wheel coming up his left leg. He struggled around enough so that he could reach up and choke the engine. When it finally stopped, he was under the tractor with the large hind wheel ready to run over his body. He tried to keep on working but his willpower wasn’t strong enough. The two lower ribs on his left side were broken, and his whole left side turned black and blue up to his ribs. After that, he tried to be more careful. Many changes happened in the family during the fifteen years they lived in Marion—some of the children went on missions, started careers, served in the military, or were married. Hyrum and Ann worked on paying their debts. World War II began. The draft board told Jake, Hyrum and Ann’s son, to keep his cows because the army needed the milk to help feed the soldiers. He bought a 160-acre farm at Emmett, Idaho, and moved his cattle up there. Hyrum went up to help with some of his work. His daughter Elaine died the following August. In May of 1944, when the triplets retuned from their mission, Ann went with them to go up and visit Jake. Because of the lower altitude in Idaho, Hyrum’s cough that had been plaguing him for several years improved, and Ann improved from her heart condition that had been bad for about six years. They decided to make their home in Idaho. After Hyrum sold the farm at Marion, Utah, he bought a forty-three-acre farm at Emmett, Idaho, in the Letha Ward. In March of 1945 Hy and Ann received word that their son Willis had been killed by shrapnel wounds in World War II. Before he came home, their son William had the chance to administer to Willis and dedicate the grave. Hyrum’s children remembered three of Hyrum’s favorite sayings: “Better slow down—you’re burning your candle from both ends,” (meaning that you should get more sleep), “Yes, you do have time—you have twenty-four hours a day, and no king or president has more,” and “He’s a really good feller—don’t judge him too harshly till you’ve walked a mile in his footsteps.” Hyrum was a sensitive man. Once when he was a young man his father said to him, “Hy will you milk the cow? My arm is really sore.” He said no. His father milked the cow instead. Years later Hyrum said, “I can’t wait to see my Dad and to tell him to please forgive me.” Keeping the Sabbath day was vitally important to Hyrum. One time Hyrum felt like he just had to get some hay out of the field. He worked steadily, but the Sabbath day arrived and he felt that the ox was in the mire. His wife took the girls and went to church, leaving him and the little boys haying. When they came home, the horses had run away, the machinery had broken, and the haying had come to a stop. Hy said that he had learned his lesson. It took longer to repair the machinery than it did to put up the hay. Hyrum and Ann spent several winters working in the Mesa Arizona Temple. In the spring of 1958 Hy had not been feeling well so he finally visited a doctor. The doctor sent him to the hospital. Hy walked into the hospital and woke up two days later because he had had a heart attack. He had to spend eight weeks in bed. After that, he didn’t do farm work but later he gained back more strength. Ann and Hyrum had enough income to live on by renting their farm for a percentage of the crop and managing their finances carefully. Because of his illness, Hyrum was told to do absolutely no work. This was very hard on him because he had always been able to do things and feel useful. His daughter Elena remembered that one time he said, “When there’s so much that I could be doing it’s impossible to sit and do nothing.” Even with his poor health, Hyrum managed to help some with the irrigating the following summer when Milo got his hand seriously injured in a hay baler and couldn’t work like he could before. Hyrum tried to keep his flowers blooming, and Ann helped him to accomplish it. He made a couple of end tables and made two piano benches, which he gave to his daughters. He also attended priesthood and sacrament meetings as long as he was able to. Hyrum passed away quietly at his home on February 7,1962. A funeral was held at the Letha Ward meetinghouse on February 9, two days later. Later at a viewing in Huntsville, President David O. McKay paid Hy and Ann a distinct honor by coming to the chapel, shaking hands with the children and grandchildren, and giving Ann a kiss. Hyrum was buried in the Huntsville cemetery. Hyrum wrote, “I sometimes wonder if I have accomplished the things for which my life has been spared. We have helped to get some genealogical records collected. We hope to see more of this work done. We have found a lot of genealogy on Father’s lines and Lillie is tracing Mother’s lines. At the present time, on the last check 217 family group sheets have all the endowment and sealing work completed. Ann and I have had a number of testimonies of the possibilities that come to us through living the gospel. We have seen the sick healed time and time again. As for the future we know very little. This we are doing: we are praying that our children will succeed in building into the lives of the grandchildren the testimony that the first and main thing in life is to help our Father in Heaven build and make Gods.” | BillionGraves",
