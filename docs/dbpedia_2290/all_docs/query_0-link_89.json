The purpose of the Historical Data Project was to gather biographical and historical information on early settlers in North Dakota. To limit the scope of the survey, a \"pioneer\" was \"defined as a person who was born before 1870 and who lived in Dakota Territory prior to the division into North and South Dakota, or as the first settler in a township.\" In addition, Historical Data Project personnel prepared historical sketches of North Dakota counties, cities, townships, agriculture, fraternal organizations, political parties, population, railroads, climate, natural resources, prominent citizens, etc., and prepared transcripts of early North Dakota county and township records having genealogical and historical value. The survey work of the Historical Data Project ceased in 1940.\n\nThe North Dakota Writers’ Project began in 1935 and was sponsored by the Division of Women’s and Professional Projects, Works Progress Administration, and the State Historical Society of North Dakota. Many of the publications planned by the North Dakota Writers’ Project were never published. Three notable exceptions are:\n\nNorth Dakota: A Guide to the Northern Prairie State, 1938\n\nA History of Richland County and the City of Wahpeton, North Dakota, 1938 sponsored by the Wahpeton Park Committee\n\nA History of Bismarck, 1938 sponsored by the Bismarck Association of Commerce\n\nThe North Dakota Writers’ Project gathered information for other proposed publications, including a history of grazing, a book on the origin of North Dakota place names, a folklore study, and a book entitled “America Eats.” Survey work of the North Dakota Writers’ Project ended in 1942.\n\nPHOTOGRAPHS INVENTORY"
