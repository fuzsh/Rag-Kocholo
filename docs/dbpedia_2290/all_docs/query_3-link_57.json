        "text": "Andrew Lauren Prods. has partnered with the Gotham Group to produce an adaptation of Matthew Dicks’ novel “Unexpectedly, Milo,” with Mark Andrus (“As Good as It Gets”) onboard to adapt.\n\nLauren will produce along with Gotham’s Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Lee Stollman and Eric Robinson.\n\n“Milo,” published in 2010, centers on a home health-care worker who, after seeing a video confessional, sets out on a journey to help a mysterious woman repair her life. Along the way, he is forced to confront the OCD that he has kept secret his entire life, and in doing so he finds love.\n\nALP is producing and fully financing “The Spectacular Now,” adapted from the 2008 Tim Tharp novel, with Miles Teller, Shailene Woodley, Brie Larson and Kyle Chandler starring. It’s also fast-tracking the development of “Capture the Flag,” an action-adventure project about privatized space travel that features an international space race, and an untitled action-thriller centered around the fictionalized ending of the U.S. embargo on Cuba.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe Gotham Group produced “Abduction” for Lionsgate and is in post on “No Good Deed” for Sony Screen Gems, with Sam Miller, Taraji Henson and Idris Elba starring. It’s also planning a January start for its untitled Elmore Leonard project, an adaptation of Leonard’s novel “The Switch,” with Jennifer Aniston, John Hawkes, Mos Def and Ty Burrell, and a second-quarter start for “Go With Me,” based on the Castle Freeman novel of the same name, with Catherine Hardwicke directing.\n\nALP and Lauren are repped by attorney David Boyle. The Gotham Group and Mark Andrus are repped by CAA, and Gotham is also repped by attorney George Davis. Dicks is represented by Taryn Fagerness."
