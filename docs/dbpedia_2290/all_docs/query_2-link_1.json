Make plans now to attend!\n\nObituary: Brent Wakeman\n\nJuly 17, 2012\n\nBrenton “Brent” H. Wakeman (Jane Munday wifeline), 71, of Nampa, Idaho, passed away peacefully on Sunday morning, July 15th, 2012, surrounded by family. Death came from complications due to heart and kidney failure.\n\nBrent was born June 8, 1941, in Idaho Falls, Idaho, to Herman and Verda Andrus Wakeman and spent a happy childhood on a ranch in Grays Lake, Idaho, which always remained dear to his heart.\n\nWhile attending Soda Springs High School, Brent contributed to the Football team, Track and Field, and the Band. He continued his education at Carbon Jr. College in Price, Utah, where he played football. He then received a Bachelors Degree of Business Management at the University of Utah in SLC, Utah.\n\nBrent spent his life with his high school sweetheart, Caroline Yost of Bancroft, Idaho. They recently celebrated 52 years of marriage, having been sealed in the LDS Salt Lake City Temple.\n\nFollowing college, Brent began work with the Coleman Company, managing factories in Cedar City, Utah, and Wichita, Kansas. He then engineered and put into operation his own sewing factories in Soda Springs, Idaho, Canby, Oregon, and Salem, Oregon. He retired in Nampa, Idaho.\n\nBrent’s life was filled with travel, having visited all fifty United States, as well as having extensively toured Europe. He and Caroline also visited all 40 County Seats of Idaho in one summer, an accomplishment which they enjoyed very much. He was a great outdoorsman, enjoying camping, fishing, hunting and RV’ing.\n\nBrent belonged to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, most recently a member of the Nampa 35th Ward. He loved to give service in quiet, unpretentious ways and generously donated of his means.\n\nHe was a man of few words, yet being gifted with a brilliant mind, his well-chosen words showed great insight and thoughts which ran deeply.\n\nBrent is survived in death by his beloved wife, Caroline; four daughters, Wendy Lynne (Rod) Peatross of Idaho Falls, Idaho, Leslie Adell (Mark) Anderson of Canby, Oregon, Ardith Anne (Brian) Haws of Salem, Oregon, and Suzanne Marie (Duane) Peck of Kuna, Idaho; and one son, Wayne Brent (Lis) Wakeman of Kenmore, Washington; a beloved sister, Sandra (Robert) Christopherson of Farr West, Utah; 16 beloved grandchildren of whom he was most proud; and 5 sweet little great-grandchildren.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father and mother, and his parents-in-law, Glenn and Frances Yost.\n\nServices for Brent will be held Saturday, July 21, 2012 in Soda Springs, Idaho, at the Bailey Creek LDS Church at 361 S. 3rd East. The Grays Lake Ward Bishopric will be conducting the services. The family will visit with friends at 9:30 am at the church, with funeral services immediately following in the chapel at 11:00am. Interment will be at the Fairview Cemetery in Soda Springs.\n\nIn memory of Brent, perhaps you might share a quiet kindness with another who is in need.\n\nTo share your sympathies, condolences and memories, leave a comment below or visit the Sims Funeral Home website.\n\nReport of the 2011 Milo Andrus Family Reunion\n\nJuly 12, 2011\n\nA Milo Andrus Family reunion was held June 18, 2011 at Liberty Park in Salt lake City, Utah. The following report is by Brent Andrus, the outgoing family organization president.\n\nUpon my arrival early on a cool, slightly overcast Saturday morning the Liberty Park maintenance crew was just finishing their clean up of the Rice Terrace Pavilion. Gary Ball and family (Margaret Boyce wife line) were already busily engaged in preparing a delightful breakfast. Don Andrus (Jane Munday wife line) and his group of volunteers—mostly members of his extended family—were preparing for reunion registration. During registration, special color-coded name badges were given to attendees, identifying them as members of their specific wife lines.\n\nAs attendees arrived, they were greeted with friendly smiles at the registration tables along with the pleasant aroma of pancakes, eggs and ham cooking nearby. Pictures of the several wife lines were also spread out on tables for all to see. An opening prayer by Craig Anderson (Jane Munday) got things officially started.\n\nFollowing the all-you-can eat breakfast, I conducted our family business meeting (see official meeting minutes for all details). The main order of business was to elect a new president and vice president for the organization. Craig Jensen (Sarah Miles) was elected president, and Andy Andrus (Jane Munday) was elected vice president.\n\nNewly elected president Craig Jensen (Sarah Miles wife line) and vice-president Andy Andrus (Jane Munday wife line).\n\nBrief reports were then given by the following:\n\nDon Andrus (Jane Munday): Financial report\n\nDean Andrus (Jane Munday): Information/Mailing lists\n\nLaura Anderson (Jane Munday): Research\n\nLaura also asked each wife line to visit with her in their wife line meetings to discuss ongoing research needs within the wife lines and to encourage further participation.\n\nFamily genealogist Laura Anderson gives a research update.\n\nOutgoing president, Brent Andrus, conducts the business meeting.\n\nI reviewed the progress of the organization, including research, communications, expansion of social media, and the need to reach many more of Milo Andrus’s descendants. Mark Andrus (Abigail Daley), who chaired the reunion committee, then reviewed the events for the remainder of the day. Don Jensen (Sarah Miles), maestro extraordinaire and game organizer, reviewed the musical and game events for the day.\n\nWife line meetings immediately followed the business meeting, and then people were off to participate in many activities, including guessing contests, organized games, kiddie rides and paddle boats on the lake or just relaxing for awhile. I chose the last option and relaxed while listening to Don Jensen’s exceptional string orchestra as they practiced. Others took advantage of the free time to have individual family picnics or to visit various Milo Andrus historical sites around the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nNewton Andrus conducts the Jane Munday wife line meeting.\n\nFamily members discuss genealogy.\n\nDisplays of thousands of historical family photos.\n\nPioneer games.\n\nThree-legged races.\n\nGetting to know new cousins.\n\nThe guessing contests were a challenge for both young and old.\n\nPaddle boats.\n\nAmusement park rides.\n\nCotton candy, mmmmm.\n\nFor dinner, Gary Ball and company returned and cooked up another great meal of hamburgers, hot dogs and all the fixings. We were treated to delightful music from Don Jensen and orchestra during the dinner hour. Then precisely at 5:45 pm (well almost) we gathered for group and wife line pictures. Try getting 200 people moving in the same direction and lining up so all can be seen in the picture! Thank goodness for the color-coded name badges! My daughter Lori Barnhurst (Jane Munday) was the official photographer for the day, taking the group photos as well as numerous candid photos.\n\nDinner was great! It was hamburgers, hot dogs and watermelon, followed by mint brownies (yum).\n\nEveryone was able to talk and get to know each other over dinner.\n\nThe innagural Andrus Family Orchestra under the baton of Don Jensen (Sarah Miles wife line).\n\nFollowing the group photos (or group chaos, if you prefer) we all settled down for the highlight of the evening, the re-enactment of the play presented at the last reunion, The Life and Wives of Milo Andrus, written and directed by De Lane Andrus Hyer (Ann Brooks).\n\nPerformers in the readers’ theater play: The Life and Wives of Milo Andrus.\n\nFollowing the play, we sang the hymn Come, Come Ye Saints. After my concluding remarks and testimony, we ended the day as we began, in prayer.\n\nI offer my heartfelt thanks to all who helped in any way with this reunion. By every measure it was truly a successful event. It was wonderful renewing old acquaintances as well as making many new ones. I will sincerely cherish the memory of this event throughout my life, and will always be grateful for the privilege of serving as your president these past four years.\n\nNew Book About St. Louis Mentions Milo\n\nJune 15, 2011\n\nA new book was published in March 2011 entitled The Best of the St. Louis Luminary. It was edited by Susan Easton Black, a professor of church history at BYU.\n\nSt. Louis was a major trailhead along the Mississippi River that attracted thousands of Mormons in the 1850s, where they set up shops, practiced their trades, formed congregations, and prepared for the journey West. It was there that Apostle Erastus Snow published the St. Louis Luminary, a weekly newspaper featuring epistles from church leaders, doctrinal treatises in defense of Mormon practices—especially plural marriage—and news and letters from the Salt Lake Valley.\n\nThe book includes an essay by Susan Easton Black about the Latter-day Saint experience in St. Louis in the 1850s and the historical importance of the St. Louis Luminary. The rest of the book is made up of highlights from the newspaper: counsel given by the First Presidency, poetry, marriage and death notices and even humor.\n\nMilo served as the stake president in St. Louis from 1854 to 1855. Many of his speeches and letters were published in the newspaper.\n\nIn the book, Milo is mentioned in Susan Easton Black’s essay and three or four of his speeches and letters are reprinted.\n\nThe book also includes a searchable DVD-ROM of all 52 issues of the newspaper. (To see all of the references to Milo in The St. Louis Luminary, click here.)\n\nThe book is available at Amazon, Deseret Book and the BYU Bookstore.\n\n.\n\nMap: Milo’s Property in Oxford, Idaho\n\nJune 15, 2011\n\nView Milo’s Property in Oxford, Idaho in a larger map.\n\nAccording to county records, Milo bought 35 acres in Oxford, Idaho in 1885 for $950.\n\nSee the above map for the approximate location of his property. The property would have been on both sides of the highway.\n\nHe lived here until his death in 1893.\n\nMap: Milo’s Properties in St. George, Utah\n\nJune 1, 2011\n\nView Milo’s Properties in St. George, Utah in a larger map.\n\nMilo lived in St. George, Utah from 1873-1881. According to Washington county property records, Milo owned three properties during that time:\n\n1. 130 East St. George Boulevard\n\nFrom 1875 to 1879 Milo owned Lot 2 Block 27 Plat A. This is on the south side of present-day St. George Blvd. between 100 East and 200 East. It is now the east side of the Sunfirst Bank.\n\n2. 272 South 100 East\n\nFrom 1876 to 1882 Milo owned Lot 1 Block 2 Plat A.\n\nHe bought it from Miles P. Romney for $2,000. He sold it to Moses T. Farnsworth in 1882. The house on the property had two front entrances and seems to have had two families living in it. At least two of Milo’s wives, Mary Webster and Margaret Boyce, lived with him in St. George.\n\nThe house is still standing. In front of it is a plaque entitled “Romney-Andrus Home.” The plaque lists the different owners of the house from 1862 to 1936. Milo and the house are mentioned on the Washington County Historical Society website and in the booklet, “Landmark and Historic Sites,” published by the city of St. George in 2009 (pp. 45-1 through 45-2).\n\n3. Price Farm (Bloomington, Utah)\n\nIn county records Milo is listed as the trustee for Price farm, which was operated under the United Order. This whole area was known as Price City and was along the Virgin River in what is now Bloomington Gardens in Bloomington, Utah. Price City was a farming area that never really flourished.\n\n4. James Andrus Homes: 196 West 100 South and 164 West 100 South\n\nMilo’s oldest son, James, from first wife Abigail Daley, moved to St. George in 1886. He had two wives, Laura Gibson and Manomas Gibson. He built a house for Laura at 196 West 100 South and a house for Manomas on the same street at 164 West 100 South.\n\nAccording to the Washington County Historical Society, “James moved his families to St. George from his ranch in Canaan in 1886. He was known as the cattle baron of southern Utah. He was a pioneer, Indian fighter, bishop, businessman, statesman, and accomplished equestrian.”\n\nMilo Andrus, St. Louis, and the St. Louis Luminary\n\nJune 1, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nMap: Milo’s Property in Nauvoo and the Nauvoo 5th Ward Boundaries\n\nJune 1, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nSpring 2011 Andrus Family Newsletter Now Available\n\nMay 10, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nDriving Tour: Milo Andrus Historic Sites near Salt Lake City\n\nMay 10, 2011\n\nMilo’s Mission Journal – Liverpool England – 1849 to 1850\n\nMay 10, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nMap: Granite Paper Mill\n\nMay 10, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nMap: Milo’s Residence in Liverpool\n\nMay 10, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nMaps of the Missions Served by Milo Andrus for the LDS Church\n\nMay 1, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nImpressions of Milo Andrus By Apostle Matthias Cowley\n\nMay 1, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nHistory of Sarah Miles (From “The Life and Wives of Milo Andrus”)\n\nMay 1, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nHistory of Lucy Loomis (From “The Life and Wives of Milo Andrus”)\n\nMay 1, 2011\n\nRead more\n\nAlyn B.

I attended with my Aunt Ann and cousin Linda and we really enjoyed it, and the wives play, too.\n\nThis year (2008), at Memorial Day, I once again visited Lucy Loomis' grave in the Spanish Fork cemetary and it once again bugged me that there was no mention of Milo being her husband on her headstone. (I thought perhaps that her Tuttle children had paid for the headstone and thereby decided to mention their father as her husband but not Milo. I don't know for sure but that seems like a likely explanation.)\n\nRead more\n\nPay Membership Dues Online\n\nNovember 15, 2008\n\nThat’s right!

Separating out the Andrus (Andrews, Andress, Andros…) lines in Vermont.\n\nThis I did by calling all of the living Andrus families in Vermont in the hopes of doing DNA testing with them.\n\nOne group, the Andrus name came from their mother. This line does not qualify for DNA.\n\nOne group descended with the farm in Danby. We got a DNA sample on this line.\n\nOne group lived in Stowe. His wife was familiar with DNA so he gave a sample.\n\nOne knew they descended from Bildad and they were not in our area.\n\nOne group from Rutland City left the state and went to Huron County, Ohio. We will need to track them if we do not locate a match from the tests now in progress.\n\nWe are starting to separate out the lines. The results are back on the gentleman from Stowe (so are Ray and Merrill Andrus’s Jane Munday line). They were not a match so that eliminates that line.\n\nWe are still waiting on \"Family Tree DNA\" for the rest of the results to come in.\n\n2. Put Ruluf’s land in Essex County on the map.\n\nRuluf was Milo’s father. We found the land that Ruluf had once owned with the help of the Essex County assessor’s office. The land was located in Jay, NY. Jay was later divided off in the 1820’s and named Wilmington. Ruluf owned land in current-day Wilmington across from Fox Farm Road to the east. It consisted of 100 acres on the south side of “Lot 27”—part of a piece of land originally granted to a Nathan Mallory. Ruluf mortgaged this land in 1808 and lost it in 1809. John Smith (father of Ruluf’s future wife, Azuba), owned land across the street from Ruluf’s.\n\nIf you enter \"Indian Rock Rd., Wilmington, New York, United States\" on Google Maps this is what you will see:\n\nView Larger Map\n\nHalf way down the Indian Rock Rd. loop (off highway 12) is where Ruluf’s land was located. If you go across highway 12, to the north of Fox Farm Road that is where John Smith, Azuba’s father, had his land. (Azuba was Ruluf’s wife and Milo’s mother.)\n\n[This photo is taken from Ruluf’s land, looking west. The mountain in the picture is Whiteface Mountain.

Here is the report on each of the reunions held:\n\nAbigail Jane Daley\n\nThe get-together was held in the cultural hall of the LDS Chapel 650 E. Stadium Ave. in Provo from 6:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. Our theme was to “Meet, Greet, Munch and Mingle” A reminder was mailed about a week before to the 145 people on the mailing list identified as being from Abigail’s children. Since this was the first meeting for Abigail’s descendants in many years, we had no idea how many families to expect. We planned refreshments for about 100 and about 35 people attended; so there was plenty of food. We were pleased to get acquainted with these descendants/cousins during the evening.\n\nA large banner welcomed all who came to the reunion. Display tables were set up for each of Abigail and Milo’s 5 adult children with a color-coded sign for each child. The color on the descendant’s name badge, which they received when they arrived and signed in at the “Welcome” table, made it easy to see from which child they were descended and find others with the same color. Pictures and written biographical stories were displayed at each of the 5 children’s tables. Round tables had been set up to enjoy visiting and eating during the evening. Families had come from the Denver, Colorado area, Vernal, Ogden, Cottonwood Heights, Ivins, Bluffdale, Riverton and Provo, Utah. The person from the furthest distance was from Escondido, California.\n\nRead more\n\nThe Anderson Report: Would the Real Ruluf Please Stand Up?\n\nOctober 1, 2007\n\nFrom family researcher Laura Anderson :\n\nHere is an E mail I got that I thought many of you would be interested in! Laura\n\nDear Laura,\n\nI googled Ruluf Andress to see what information was out there. It appears to me that the best sites are the ones that have your name attached to them. I do have a question or two and I’m betting you probably know the answer.\n\nSome sites list Joseph Andrus and Sybil Andrews as Ruluf’s parents. Others list Ruluf Andrus Sr. and Azuba White. Still others indicate no parentage can be found. Which one do you think it is?\n\nAlso, was young Ruluf the \"Ruluf Andrus\" placed under the Guardian Bond or not? One site says no with 99% surety, but another says that was before you knew the guarantor of the bond was Sybil’s brother-in-law. Of course, if Sybil is not Ruluf’s mother, the whole issue is solved.\n\nThanks for all the information you have posted, not only on Ruluf and his family, but also on Milo and his numerous wives as well. With Milo having the 4th largest family in the LDS church, there are many people who are indebted to you — including me! ‎(Wife #1 Abigail Jane Daley through daughter Mary Jane)‎\n\nThanks for your help with these questions. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate it.\n\nStefenee Hymas\n\nHello and glad to meet someone who is studying the issue. I believe there is a Ruluf and that he probably is the son of Sybil and guardian bonded to Joseph Johnson but I see absolutely no evidence that any of that group ever met any of our group.\n\nI have traced Ruluf to a logical family but as the records in Poultney burned and therefore we have no evidence we are turning to a Y-chromosome test from one of the known descendants of that line and are awaiting the results from it. If that is a match then we know which family to study. The Sybil theory came from the finding of the Guardian bond and went back from there.\n\nThe Ruluf and Azuba White theory was originally purposed by a grandaughter of Ruluf through Carlo. I am still confused by that one as anyone who put the dates together would know it could not work. There is no Ruluf Andrus coming in to the country at the time he was supposed to, he never shows up in a single record anywhere. I have put that one on a back burner until something leads me in that direction.\n\nAt this point all I can say is that in the past all people could do is guess. With DNA testing now we can know 100% when we get into the correct line and for us that day is coming soon I hope.\n\nBye for now! Laura\n\nThe Anderson Report: DNA Research Trip\n\nAugust 27, 2007\n\nFrom family researcher, Laura Anderson:\n\nI am leaving on the 23 of Aug 2007 for a 17 day research trip to Vermont and New York where I will be trying, among other things, to get DNA data on Andrus families that have stayed in that area to match against our Andrus males. I project this trip will cost $600 for airfare, + hotels + $700.00 for the car + gas and, DNA kits at $195.00 Each. That will come out to around $3,000. If you appreciate the work we are doing please help with a tax detectable contribution! They can be sent to the Milo Andrus 503B Corporation in care of the Secretary Don Andrus:\n\nDon Andrus\n\n540 West Kim Drive\n\nPerry, Utah 84302\n\nThanks to all those who have helped in the past!\n\nLaura Anderson\n\nPS I have set up this site I am not sure how to use it yet but thought people might be interested! Laura\n\nhttp://www.relativegenetics.com/genomics/search/projectprospect.html?pid=54428\n\nRay B. Andrus (Jane Munday line) is having his DNA done on the new 43 marker test and I am taking at least one 43 marker test to try to establish the Lt. John Andrews of Ipswich line. The descendants of his son John are the ones that took the \"Andrus\" spelling to differentiate them from all the \"Andrews\" and \"Andros\" lines. Some of them lived in Poultney, Vermont in 1800 which is the first time we see Ruluf. Also from the neighboring town of Pawlet there are Andrus’. This is where the Hancocks lived. (Azuba’s sister Polly married Uriah Hancock).\n\nPresident’s Message: July 2007 — From New President Brent Andrus\n\nJuly 20, 2007\n\nIt was wonderful meeting and visiting with so many of you at our recent Milo Andrus Family reunion. Many thanks go to those who worked so hard to make the reunion such a tremendous success. Special thanks go to Craig and Laura Anderson and extended family for their many contributions to the reunion. The Saturday morning breakfast was absolutely fabulous, and the park was the ideal setting for everything else. Thanks to De Lane Andrus Hyer for the play about Milo and his wives, and again to Laura for her dedication in organizing and presenting it. The play was the perfect ending to a great reunion. I am certain that Milo, his wives and our other ancestors would be very pleased with all of the events of the reunion.\n\nI would be remiss if I did not add my special thanks to Merrill Andrus for his leadership of this organization over the last four years. Much has been accomplished under his leadership, and he has left some very big shoes to fill. Thanks also to Don Andrus for his vision and courage in revitalizing this organization four years ago. I am grateful for the talents, dedication and willingness of each of you in moving this organization forward. As I assume the responsibility for leading the Milo Andrus Family organization, I am both humbled and honored to represent you.

Merrill Andrus\n\n“One of the Hardest Burdens that I Have Been Called to Bear”: The Story of Milo’s Second Crossing of the Plains (1855)\n\nMay 26, 2007\n\nMilo led three wagon trains of pioneers across the plains to Salt Lake City in 1850, 1855, and 1861. What follows is an account of his second crossing in 1855. This account is gathered from journals and other historical records.\n\nThis was the last of the Perpetual Emigration Fund companies for 1855. Milo Andrus received the assignment to captain the train the night before the party was to leave Mormon Grove (just outside Atchison, Kansas Territory) and had just 12 hours to get himself ready. Two things made this last-minute appointment necessary: the season was very late and no one else with plains experience was available. Thus Andrus and his two assistants had an enormous responsibility. The company had few oxen, and many of these were small and unbroken, so they had to be trained en route. Part of the company left Mormon Grove on August 1; the rest left on the 3rd. Inexperienced drivers had to shuttle some wagons forward, then return with the teams to bring up others. One emigrant recalled that early on it took four men to drive one yoke of oxen. There were 461 individuals in the company when it set out.\n\nNo sooner had the company left Mormon Grove than the U. S. Marshall for Kansas Territory arrived with an order to “attach” the train for debts attributed to Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Jedediah M. Grant (at that time the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints). Captain Andrus convinced the marshall that the train belonged not to the First Presidency, but to the Perpetual Emigration Fund Company. The lawman then tried to take Andrus back to Atchison to “get sufficient good security from amongst the Citizens there to secure the debt & cost,” but the Captain refused to leave his train. At this critical moment, the marshall “was taken with the bellyache and wanted a little brandy,” which Captain Andrus quickly supplied. He then fed the marshall supper and drove him in a buggy to his lodgings. Nevertheless, the marshall ordered Andrus and three other brethren to appear at the October 3rd term of the U.S. court in Leavenworth, and when he got back to Mormon Grove, he attached four or five Mormon-owned wagons, “a few lame cattle,” and some calves.\n\nThe Andrus train overtook Captain Allred’s emigrant company on Big Grasshopper Creek; later, both parties camped on Walnut Creek. Tired of leapfrogging his wagons, Captain Andrus decided to leave a Perpetual Emigration Company thrashing machine in the care of a local farmer (Captain Allred left five wagons with this same man at that time). Andrus now set a pace that was “as hurried as he could urge, push, and cajole, the group over the plains, up and down the mountains, through the canyons, across the rivers, and through the miles of the thick dust of the trails.” At some point, the train encountered a large herd of buffalo that “ran across our train, while in motion, and knocked down and [bore] off the horn of one of the oxen.” The Indians that the train met were friendly. At Big Blue River the train used the ferry because the river was running high. Near there the party camped just a few rods west of Captain Harper’s company. It was here that Andrus “nailed our colors to the top of the mast.” From Little Blue River, the Captain wrote: “Two wagon axles, one wheel, and several tongues broke which has caused us some delay; but notwithstanding . . . I . . . am doing all in my power to push on this camp . . . as I am deeply anxious for their welfare.” Two elderly emigrants had died. The train followed the Platte River and must have crossed the South Platte. It stopped at Ash Hollow, where Andrus learned that General William S. Harney and about 700 soldiers had “found a party of the Sioux Indians about eight miles from Ash Hollow and a battle had ensued on the 3rd of October. The General sent over word to Andrus on the 5th keep an advanced guard stating at the same time that the best information that they could get was that they had killed one hundred and twenty Indians, taken about fifty-eight prisoners, mostly women; had four soldiers killed and five wounded. He stated, also, they were going to lay out a fort a small distance below Ash Hollow after which they calculated to proceed to Fort Laramie, and from thence to wherever they could find any of the Sioux Nation.”\n\n“A few miles from where they were encamped there were about forty Indians that were in the battle near Ash Hollow. Nothing came of this. The company passed Court House Rock, Chimney Rock, and Scotts Bluff. By September 13 the company was 12 miles below Fort Laramie. It then passed Laramie Peak, Independence Rock, and Devil’s Gate. At the latter place, on September 28, the emigrants met brethren from the Salt Lake Valley. On October 4 the train crossed Devil’s Backbone, “a most awful mounting [sic] of stone.” That night “came on a dredfull [sic] storm of snow.” On the 6th the train crossed South Pass. Near Chimney Rock 20 oxen and 2 cows died “from something the[y] had eat or drank [sic].” Upon reaching the Sweetwater River many more cattle died. There was little feed for the animals; in all, the Andrus train “lost 11 animals above 50%.”\n\nAt the fifth crossing of the Sweetwater it snowed three inches. The train\n\ncrossed the Green River on October 11 and arrived at Fort Bridger four days later. From the fort, Captain Andrus sent word to Salt Lake that he needed fresh animals and that “many of the men, women and children were almost barefoot and very destitute of clothing.” By the time the train reached the Weber River, the emigrants were running out of provisions. They crossed Big Mountain and Little Mountain. A delegation of dignitaries from Salt Lake met them at the mouth of Emigration Canyon. Here the emigrants formed a circle around the welcoming party and “sang a piece of poetry composed for the occasion”:\n\n“Come Zion’s sons and daughters,\n\nWho seek this blest abode,\n\nThat over plains and waters\n\nHave come to serve our God;\n\nOur gratitude demanding,\n\nLet praise to Him abound,\n\nThat we are favored, standing\n\nOn consecrated ground.\n\nOh! This we’ve long expected,\n\nFor this we’ve prayed and sighed,\n\nLike Israel’s sons neglected,\n\nBy Babel’s limpid tide;\n\nAnd now befo\n\n. . . When on the way to Zion,\n\nAnd every heart was hope,\n\nThe means we’d to rely on\n\nWas fastly closing up;\n\nBut as the darken’d shadows\n\nDeclared a brighter sun,\n\nWe felt a power to glad us,\n\nTh’ Apostles would make known.\n\nTho’ elements did battle,\n\nAs late the season pass’d,\n\nAnd weakly seemed our cattle,\n\nWe’re in the “hive” at last:\n\nNo power should withstand us,\n\nDeclared Erastus Snow;\n\nAnd Captain Milo Andrus\n\nThank God, has brought us thro’.\n\nWe come not here for pleasures\n\nThat carnal minds can prize,\n\nNor seek aurif’rous treasures\n\nOf th’ West to aggrandize;\n\nWe come with spirits fervent\n\nTo fully serve the Lord;\n\nTo hear His holy servant,\n\nAnd live by every word.\n\nAnd as the arms of Moses\n\nRequired bearing up,\n\nSo every soul proposes\n\nTo be our Brigham’s prop:\n\nTho’ late and last our carriage\n\nAcross the mountains’ brow,\n\nWe hope, like Jesus’ marriage,\n\nThere’s best wine even now.”\n\nThe Andrus train, with “upwards of 50 wagons,” arrived in Salt Lake City October 24th. Because of the lateness of the season, Captain Andrus had pushed his people hard. Undoubtedly, this is why one of the travelers described him as “a terrible bully and tyrant.” However, another emigrant wrote, “It was not an altogether unpleasant trip.” For his part, Captain Andrus had been ill during much of the journey. He said that leading this 1855 train was “one of the hardest burthens that I have been called to bear in the midst of Israel during my sojourn in mortality” this from a man who had been with Zion’s Camp, who had been in Nauvoo at the time of the Martyrdom, who had “helped watch the city by night, and worked on the temple by day,” who had gone to Carthage at the time of the indictment of the murderers of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, who had experienced the persecutions leading up to the abandonment of Nauvoo, and who had participated in the Latter-day Saint exodus westward, a man who, himself, had led several other emigrant companies.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nLearn More\n\nThis account is reprinted with permission from the LDS Church’s website Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel.

These profiles were written in 2006.\n\nI am Rosetta Fern Andrus Woolf Gibb (Maragaret Ann Boyce), the fifth daughter of Benjamin Boyce Andrus and Lydia Rosetta French. I was born on December 10, 1918. Imagine dad and mom’s disappointment when they so wanted a son, to get a big gawky awkward daughter—daughter No. 5. But they loved me anyway. My only brother, Milo, was born two years later, followed by three more girls. Mom and dad were always proud of their daughters and said they could all work like boys.\n\nOur family consisted of dad, mom, Grace, Nellie, Jacquetta, Gwen, Fern, Milo, Phyllis, Alice, and Beth.\n\nI was born in Hill Spring, Alberta, Canada, and lived there for 80 years. I goy my schooling in Hill Spring up through grade 11 as that was all they had at the time. I always had to work and learned the value of work at a young age. Milking cows, feeding pigs, hoeing gardens, wrangling horses, stocking grain, picking berries, and topping beets was a way of life for me.\n\nRead more\n\nAre You Coming to the 2007 Reunion?\n\nMay 6, 2007\n\nPoll for May 2007\n\nThe great 2007 family reunion is this June.

What follows is an account of his first crossing in 1850. This account is gathered from journals and other historical records.\n\nIn early 1850, Church leaders advised emigrants that pioneer companies would travel on a new route on the south side of the Platte River. By taking this new route they avoided some river crossings on the north side that had proved dangerous because of high water in the previous year. They also expected to receive additional military protection on a new army supply road. This was a factor in their decision because they wanted to avoid conflict with the Plains Indians, who had been agitated during the 1849 California gold rush. The 200-mile long army road connected \"Old Fort Kearny,\" located 50 miles below Kanesville on the Missouri River, to \"New Fort Kearny\" following the south side of the Platte River to the west.\n\nRead more\n\nMilo’s Living Grandchildren (4 of 7): Gwennie May Andrus Barfuss\n\nMay 6, 2007\n\nThis is the fourth in a seven part series highlighting Milo’s remaining living grandchildren. These profiles were written in 2006.\n\nI, Gwennie May Andrus Barfus (Margaret Ann Boyce), was born to Benjamin Boyce Andrus and Lydia Rosetta French on August 24, 1916, in Hill Spring, Alberta, Canada. I had seven sisters, Grace, Nellie, Jacquetta, Fern, Phyllis, Alice and Beth, and one brother, Benjamin Milo, who was killed during WWII.\n\nMy dad had a farm southeast of Hill Spring. It was here that I learned what a hard days stooking as was as well as milking cows, feeding pigs, and driving six head of horses attached to a plow. I spent many hours working the fields with my dad. We were a very close family; we had to be as there was not room not to be close. Our home was very tiny in today’s standards.\n\nAll my activities centered around church, school, and family. I had good teachers both at school and church and I liked to go to both. I want to emphasize that my childhood and my growing-up years were fun and full of all good things. I was in theatre productions, participated in basketball, softball, and hockey.\n\nRead more\n\nFamily Newsletter April 2007 — Print Edition\n\nApril 22, 2007\n\nThe April 2007 Family Newsletter was mailed this week.\n\nIf you did not recieive one and would like to be put on the mailing list for future printed newsletters, visit the Update Mailing Information page.\n\nTo read a PDF version on the newsletter, click the link below.\n\nAndrus Family Organization Newsletter — April 2007 (PDF)\n\n2007 Reunion Information Updated: Wife Line Meetings\n\nApril 22, 2007\n\nThe 2007 Reunion page has been updated.

These profiles were written in 2006.\n\nA cold winter day, January 24, 1919 in Elba, Cassia, Idaho, Ted was born to Hyrum Andrus (son of Milo Andrus and Margaret Ann Boyce) and Virginia (Jenny) Garner Andrus. They lived in a two-story frame house and it was very nice. The home was located on 80 acres where they raised grain and were surrounded by beautiful mountains, crystal clear mountain streams and a close-knit community. He was born into a family of one older sister, Margaret and four older brothers, Charles, William, (Brother Bill), Owen and George. Ted was the youngest.\n\nTed describes his father Hyrum as “the best of four-team drivers.” He hauled freight to the end of the railroad in Utah to the Alma Elba stores. He also would build the grades to make roads in these areas and in Yellowstone Park and throughout the West. His group prepared the bare ground, filled the gullies, etc. so they could make a road. He could stack hay faster than younger men.\n\nRead more\n\nMilo’s Living Grandchildren (2 of 7): Beth Andrus Cahoon\n\nApril 22, 2007\n\nThis is the second in a seven part series highlighting Milo’s remaining living grandchildren. These profiles were written in 2006.\n\nMy name is Beth Andrus Cahoon (Margaret Ann Boyce). I was born in Cardston, Alberta, Canada, the ninth child of Benjamin Boyce Andrus and Lydia Rosetta French. I was welcomed into their large family on a cold morning of December 2, 1930. My appearance must have been a total shock as the Andrus clan had finished their family (they thought) six years earlier. I was, however, a delightful child and soon won their hearts—I’m told.\n\nMy childhood was happy and carefree as I roamed the hills of Hill Spring, rode our old horse “Babe,” swam in the canal in summer and skated on one of the three ponds around our little hamlet in the winter. The foothills west of Spring Hill were crowded with sleighs and toboggans every Saturday during the winter months.\n\n“The Lone Ranger” galloped into our home on the airways of our old Marconi radio at 5:00 p.m. every week night. We were glued to the old set to witness his wonderful adventures. Every Monday night we welcomed glamour into our huge kitchen as we settled as a family for the Lux Theatre. There was always a great show, and the star of the production always talked personally to each of us as she told us of her perfect complexion obtained from using Lux Toilet Soap.\n\nRead more\n\nMilo’s Living Grandchildren (1 of 7): Phyllis Andrus Walburger\n\nApril 15, 2007\n\nThis is the first in a seven part series highlighting Milo’s remaining living grandchildren. These profiles were written in 2006. Watch for the other profiles in upcoming weeks.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMy name is Phyllis Edrie Andrus Walburger (Margaret Ann Boyce). I was born July 8, 1922, to wonderful parents, Benjamin Boyce Andrus and Lydia Rosetta French. I was the seventh child and the sixth daughter born, to take my place in this great family. My dad and mother, five sisters and my brother, Milo, who was just two years older than I, were very special to me and I loved them all so dearly. Then after two years, I got to have two more sisters, which brought a lot more fun and loving into my life.\n\nI was baptized July 8, 1930, on my eighth birthday. Now, I was truly a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I have always been proud of this and have tried to be obedient and faithful to my Heavenly Father and he has granted me so many blessings. I thank Him for these blessings every day of my life.\n\nRead more\n\n2007 Reunion Information Updated with Temple Sessions\n\nApril 15, 2007\n\nThe 2007 Reunion page has been updated.

Tom and Anne Andrus always hoped to take their kids on an adventurous family voyage. Now, they’ve made their dream a reality with a 365-day expedition around the world! Anne, Tom and their four kids—14-year-old Dax, 12-year-old McKane, 7-year-old Kieran and 4-year-old Asher—left their Atlanta home and hit the road on August 27, 2006. First stop, New Zealand! About eight months into their trip, they have already had their fair share of adventure touring floating villages in Vietnam, dancing on Namibian sand dunes, tubing down a river in Laos, visiting museums in France and even meeting an elephant in Botswana…and they still have five months to go.\n\nThey appeared on The Oprah Show on April 2, 2007 via satellite from the summit of a mountain in Cape Town, South Africa.\n\nTo see photos and learn more about the family and their trip, visit their blog www.sixintheworld.com.\n\nRead more\n\nWhere Did You Serve Your Mission?\n\nMarch 31, 2007\n\nPoll for April 2007\n\nIn his lifetime Milo served eight missions for the LDS Church. He served in Ohio (four times), New York, England (twice), and in the Eastern states.\n\nIf you are a descendant of Milo, and served an LDS mission, where did you serve?\n\nMilo Debates Plural Marriage with Joseph Smith III\n\nMarch 31, 2007\n\nIn the later years of his life while living at Oxford, Idaho, Milo had a public exchange of views with Joseph Smith III, the oldest son of the Prophet Joseph Smith, on the subject of plural marriage. Joseph III repudiated the practice and denied that his father had anything to do with establishing it.\n\nRead more\n\nE-Mail Newsletter Update\n\nMarch 23, 2007\n\nWe have made a change to how the e-mail newsletter will be delivered.

Click the link below to read the meeting minutes.\n\nMinutes of the Board of Directors Meeting — March 3, 2007 (PDF)\n\nThe Anderson Report: Report of the March 3, 2007 Meeting\n\nMarch 14, 2007\n\nWe had a meeting of the Milo Andrus Family Organization Board of Directors at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City, on March 3, 2007. I felt it was a success and much was accomplished.\n\nWe went over plans for the family reunion June 15 and 16 ‎(see details here on miloandrus.org), reviewed what was happening in genealogy research and then went to a computer lab where each person had a computer in front of them.\n\nWhile in the computer lab we looked at miloandrus.org and at the genealogy site. Spoke about why we need each wife line to complete a down line PAF file (the file will allow us to put documents, histories, obituaries, and pictures on the web for each person) ‎and went over how to do that. To get involved with this ask your wife line person for an assignment. Or if you have a PAF file of your family send it to the rep.\n\nWe then went through boxes of original documents for the wife lines. Some of them acted like little kids at Christmas: \"Oh look at this history,\" or, \"Look at this, my dad is offering to be the wife line rep…,\" or, \"look at this original document it is a certified copy of Milo’s marriage to Abagail Jane Daley‎\" (February 14 not 21 as Milo had reported). I promised to stay till the last person was through and so I left the library about 8:00pm it was a long day but a worthwhile day.\n\nI just wish Satan had got out of the way. I burned CDs and they did not work. I came home and burned them some more and everything is just fine now. I will get them out to the wife line people in the next week.\n\nLaura‎\n\nMilo in His 60s\n\nMarch 5, 2007\n\nRead more\n\nPresident’s Message: March 2007 – Five Things You Can Do To Help\n\nMarch 1, 2007\n\nRecently a question arose, \"What should the wife line organizations be doing and what should individuals be doing?\"\n\nEach wife line in the Milo Andrus Family Organization can work to become organized with assignments and meetings to take care of details such as the following:\n\n1. DESCENDANCY\n\nOur family will be better served if we can answer the question, \"Who are the descendants of Milo Andrus and his wife _________.\" Someone in each wife line (or more than one person) should be assigned to work together to make such lists of descendants. You personally can help in this effort by putting together a descendancy list of your kids, your grandkids, your brothers and sisters, your aunts and uncles, your cousins, etc. and giving it to your wife line representative. (Don’t know who that is? You can look it up here.)\n\nRead more\n\nMilo’s Wives: Quick Facts\n\nMarch 1, 2007\n\nClick the link below for a comparison chart of Milo’s wives—where they were born, how old they were when they married Milo, how many children and grandchildren they had, etc.\n\nMilo’s Wives – Quick Facts (PDF)\n\n.\n\nWhich Wife?\n\nMarch 1, 2007\n\n(Poll for March 2007)\n\nThe Anderson Report: Upcoming Meeting\n\nFebruary 27, 2007\n\nFrom family researcher Laura Anderson:\n\nWe will be having a meeting at the computer lab at the Family History Library in Salt Lake City on Saturday, March 3, 2007 from 12:00 to 2:00. We will be showing the miloandrus.org web page, the phpgedview web page and giving instructions on how to do the inputing of the family groups. I will also have files of things divided into wife lines from the more than 15 boxes that I have now gone through. These documents will be available after 2:00 on for research and copying. We are asking that the files not leave the building for obvious reasons, however I will stay as long as anyone is still interested and working in the files.\n\nDon’t forget the family organization executive board meeting will be from 10:00-12:00 that same day.\n\nLaura\n\nThe Gravestones of Ruluf and Azuba Andress (Milo’s Parents)\n\nFebruary 27, 2007\n\nRead more\n\nRuluf’s Hotel\n\nFebruary 27, 2007\n\nRead more\n\nMilo Andrus’ 1893 Obituary\n\nFebruary 21, 2007\n\nRead more\n\nElder Henry B.

Merrill Andrus, President\n\nThe Anderson Report: February 2007\n\nDecember 29, 2006\n\nFrom family researcher Laura Anderson:\n\nChristmas has come and gone and here it is 2007. I remember a teacher in grade school about 1960 telling us how by 1980 cars would be flying and computers whatever they were would know everything about people and keep track of us all. Well she was 1/2 correct but by 2007.\n\nHow is our research going? Right now I am taking a little time to go through boxes (15 to be exact) of things done years ago and put into boxes. I located the first one from Elena Goodworth back in 2001, 3 from Uncle Hyrum Andrus (Jane Munday) in 2006, 5 from the secretary’s collection in 2006, 2 more from Uncle Hyrum in late 2006, and 4 more from the Minnie Fisher Ellsworth collection in possession of Jill Scott of the San Diego area. Most of the persons involved in creating these are long since dead (we are happy that Uncle Hyrum is still with us) so no one has known what has been done.\n\nHere is a list of a few of the interesting things I have found:\n\nRead more"
