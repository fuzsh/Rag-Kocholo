        "text": "Andrew Kooman, who wrote the critically acclaimed play She Has A Name that toured Canada in 2012, has created a new play that will premiere May 5th 2015 at 7:30pm at the Burnt Thicket Theatre. His new play, We Are the Body is a psychological thriller with an incredible cast. It’s the kind of story that you’ll want to talk about in a coffee shop or restaurant with friends after the show.\n\nWorld Premiere Tour: Red Deer (May 5-9), Calgary (May 13-23) and Saskatoon (May 26-31)\n\nBuy Tickets"
