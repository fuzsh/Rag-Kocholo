        "text": "She Has A Name, the Canadian-made film about a human trafficking incident in Thailand has released its first poster and teaser trailer online to mark the United Nations’ International Day of the Girl.\n\n“The United Nations states that ‘the world’s 1.1 billion girls are part of a large and vibrant global generation poised to take on the future,’” says screenwriter Andrew Kooman, “and we couldn’t agree more. This film explores how human trafficking steals that future from too many young girls and it highlights the work required by the global community to ensure that future is safe, free and secure.”\n\nThe Unveil Studios’ film stars an international cast of actors including Will Yun Lee (The Wolverine, Hawaii Five-0), Eugenia Yuan (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Sword of Destiny, Memoirs of A Geisha) and Gil Bellows (The Shawshank Redemption, Ally McBeal).\n\nThe film pairs these well known actors with up-and-coming stars. Vancouver-based actor Giovanni Mocibob, New York’s Teresa Ting and Singapore’s Vanessa Toh will be revelations to film audiences. These breakthrough actors are the heart and soul of the story and embody the harrowing human drama of trafficking.\n\nShot in Thailand, She Has A Name is a dramatic thriller. Based on a real event, the film focuses on an investigation into a shocking human trafficking incident in Southeast Asia and explores the layers of corruption, internationally, that enable the global commercial sex trade to thrive, at the expense of young girls and women’s futures.\n\nAs part of the film’s distribution strategy, global anti-trafficking agencies will be distributing the film through their networks to “Fund Freedom.” A portion of the proceeds from the sale of the film through the film’s website will go directly to support the work of agencies to rescue and restore victims of human trafficking.\n\nThe first Teaser Trailer features the provocative song “Skyline” by UK-based synth-pop artists the New Portals. The Teaser can be viewed at www.shehasanamefilm.com.\n\nAbout She Has A Name: She Has A Name is the new feature film by Unveil Studios, directed by Matthew and Daniel Kooman from the screenplay by Andrew Kooman. The Kooman brothers along with Donna Abraham and Shari Aspinall are producers. Lance Kadatz and Dean Kohut are Executive Producers."
