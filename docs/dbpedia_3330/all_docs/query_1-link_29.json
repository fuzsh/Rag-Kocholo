        "meta_description": "Ripple Effect Artists presents this compelling story about how a young lawyer poses as a john to build a legal case against a brothel trafficking young girls internationally. His investigation centers on Number 18, a young girl whose testimony could make or break the case. The play is haunted by voices who usher Number 18 to her fate.  From May to October 2012, SHE HAS A NAME toured across Canada. In conjunction with the tour, A Better World raised money to help women and children who had been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country’s prostitution industry. This play received strong endorsement from Canadian activists, including MP Joy Smith, Ratanak International’s Brian McConaghy, and IJM Canada’s Jamie McIntosh. The play’s premiere and initial run were critically acclaimed. In the 2012 tour across Canada, SHE HAS A NAME was performed in several fringe theatre festivals, at which critics representing the Montreal Gazette, the Winnipeg Free Press, and CFEQ-FM said it stood out for its quality and moral content.  Significant funds from this production will be in support of RestoreNYC, Breaking The Silence, and The Coaltion Against Trafficking in Women.",
