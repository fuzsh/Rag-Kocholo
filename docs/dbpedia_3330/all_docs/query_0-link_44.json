Conceived and founded by Diane Alber that wrote the book \"I'm NOT just a Scribble\". It's meant to encourage people to get out there and be creative. It doesn't matter what you do or how you do it, your creativity is wonderful and precious! Even a scribble should be celebrated so don't get caught in your head. Let yourself loose and just enjoy the process! Today is a good reminder that life's not perfect. We're not perfect and we should stop expecting ourselves to be perfect. As Bob Ross said, \"We don't make mistakes, we have happy accidents.\" So, scribble, not only outside the lines but forget the lines entirely and embrace all those happy accidents. If you like these reminders to set the tone for your week and through the year, itâ€™s not to late to get one of my limited edition 2024 calendars: https://lnkd.in/gGGkgJUw #scribbleart #MarchMadness #firepowerproductions #jennifire #wefancy #shopwefancy #pamperyourpeopleandspoilyourspace #springbreak #scribble #calendar2024 #calendargirl #soulshine #GratitudeAttitude #nationalholiday #themoreyouknowthemoreyougrow #scribblesthatmatter #scribbles #thegoodlife #memesdaily #scribbleday #creativeprocess #healthyhabits #creativeideas #embraceyourself #artoftheday\n\nTime-travelers, let's embark on a Nostalgic Journey with 'The Tumultuous Lives of Karl Strong.' Are you ready to dive into a tale that intertwines the complexities of time travel with the sweet, often bitter, high school memories? Shawn Inmon's latest addition to the Middle Falls Series is a portal to the past, taking us on a whirlwind ride to our teenage years and the thrills of first love. In this eighteenth installment, Inmon masterfully crafts a narrative that is as much about self-discovery as it is about the intricacies of time loops. Readers are invited to explore the life of Karl Strong, a character who, like many of us, has experienced the highs and lows of adolescence. But unlike our own linear timelines, Karl's journey is anything but ordinary. With each turn of the page, we are transported back to the lockers-lined hallways, the buzz of the school cafeteria, the football games, and the heart-fluttering moments of young romance. Inmon's vivid storytelling resurrects the emotions that come with first loves and the lessons learned from themâ€”echoing the sentiment that while we cannot change the past, we can certainly learn from it. This story is not just a book; it's an adventure that promises to resonate with anyone who has ever looked back on their formative years with a mix of fondness and regret. It's a reminder that while time marches forward, the journeys we take in literature can always bring us back to the moments that define us. So, fellow time-travel enthusiasts, grab your copy and prepare to be swept away by the tides of nostalgia and the excitement of what-ifs. This is one high school reunion you won't want to miss! https://lnkd.in/gFRummgd\n\nðŸŒŸ Exciting News for Dreamers & Manifestors! ðŸŒŸ I'm thrilled to share my latest blog post: \"Unlock Your Dreams & Manifest Magic: Transform Your Life with a Vision Book!\" Dive deep into the enchanting world of Vision Booksâ€”a powerful tool not just for goal setting, but for manifesting the life you've always dreamed of.

You can choose to either turn the page or destroy the book in its entirety. You don't have to suffer, when you can just redirect the #possibilities of both #engagement and #harmonious #effort. #Positive conversions can only take place when you yourself choose to jump overboard when wanting to live is greater than the option to sink.
