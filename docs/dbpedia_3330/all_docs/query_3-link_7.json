I hope the list can be a reference for others, and an ongoing conversation about new ways to understand the Bible and film.\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve had some really cool opportunities to connect with some incredible individuals, pick their brains, and learn.\n\nRead my interviews with philosopher James K.A. Smith, Juno-nominee Chelsea Amber, the NHL Reimer family and the Editors of Faith Today.\n\nDan, Matt and I have made available, for the first time, a behind-the-scenes documentary of our multi-faceted adventure making the film She Has A Name.\n\nWatch Part One here!\n\nBecause January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month, I’ve put together a list of 6 things I’ve learned since scratching out the first act of a story that transformed my life:\n\nFor me, it was an interesting convergence of faith, art and justice in my own life. Newly aware I wanted to use my inclination for the written word to address justice issues I was shocked to learn about, I was given an opportunity."
