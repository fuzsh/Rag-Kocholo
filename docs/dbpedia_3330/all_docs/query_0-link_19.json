        "text": "After he graduated, playwright Andrew Kooman went to work for a non-profit organization in Malaysia. He was immediately plunged into the world of human trafficking and the global sex trade. \"I saw things that I never would have imagined and what I've learned about the world of human trafficking is that anything can happen and does, and the darkness is darker than you want to think about,\" he tells host Tom Power.\n\nYears later he decided to take all of the raw emotions and horrors he witnessed and pour it into a play. She Has a Name is now a motion picture thanks to a collaboration with Andrew's filmmaker brother Matt.\n\nThe Koomans join Tom to share why making this film humanizes the victims of the global sex trade.\n\nFind out more about She Has a Name here.\n\nâ€” Produced by Dawna Dingwall"
