        "text": "Podcast launch! In this episode, Matthew, Daniel and Andrew Kooman share their filmmaking origin stories.\n\nAlthough our voices all sound the same, we have different entry points into filmmaking. The conversation of this episode tracks the collision between our love of story, our journey of faith and happenstances along the way.\n\nCore Theme\n\nA core theme that emerges in this podcast episode is how filmmaking is an outlet for the deep pursuits of life, for collaborating around ideas and interacting with the world.\n\nThis is the audio version of the podcast. If you want to see us ramble, talk with our hands (and to see just how tired Matt looks after a sleepless night with a newborn), watch the video version on UnveilTV.\n\nShow Notes\n\nDan’s filmmaking journey started in high school, after a beloved high school teacher told his class that a filmmaking career was the worst choice for bright young minds. An ebay purchase of a $500 JVC camera changed his trajectory.\n\nMatt’s filmmaking story, as is the Kooman way, involves an evolution of roles, a wide array of experiences in business and travel in Red Deer and across the world, as well as openness to new opportunities.\n\nAndrew’s start in film can be mapped outside of Canada, at the point in time Matt and Dan were starting to consider looking through the world with a camera lens. The dots that connected for him were his need to tell stories that matter in a variety of ways.\n\nTopics we discuss\n\nCurating well made, well told stories\n\nStumbling into opportunity\n\nOur inheritance as story-tellers\n\nFilm’s ability to impact the human spirit\n\nGood art/bad art\n\nFilms we name drop in the Episode:"
