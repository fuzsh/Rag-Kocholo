In time, the words that we ponder over, and take time to cultivate, have a way of becoming flesh. As Daniel shares in The Breath of Life, this book is the story that unfolded after God whispered a simple, powerful word to him, Breath.\n\nDaniel and I both grew up in the small town of Red Deer, Alberta. A small dot on the very large map of Canada. Both Daniel and I trace our European heritage from Dutch immigrants that came to Canada following World War II.\n\nRecently, Daniel reminded me that the first time we met was in the early 1990’s, when I visited his Grade 4 class to share about my work as an author. Now an accomplished filmmaker and storyteller by trade, Daniel explained how that visit was the first time he ever thought about the significance of the written word, and by extension, the significance of the stories that we tell.\n\nIn its simplest form, the message I shared with Daniel and his Grade 4 class 25 years ago is that words have power, and the best words become the stories we tell, and the best stories have the power to change people. This book is a full circle reminder of that truth. In The Breath of Life, Daniel reminds us that The Word became flesh. He unpacks revelations from the Hebrew language, buried deep in the fabric of the Scriptures, that when mined from their roots become treasures that have been waiting in plain sight to be discovered.\n\nI was most impacted by the deep revelation this book unveils around breath, which reminds us how quintessential the moment truly was when Yahweh breathed on Adam in the Garden of Eden. Breath changes everything. When Adam began to breathe, humanity began to bear God’s image. To bear the image of God is to have a living soul, breathed or gifted to you by a living God. As you continue to breathe, your very existence remains tied to the Creator of breath. You are a living soul made in God’s image. Is there a more powerful truth than this to ponder for ourselves? While many of us have read the Genesis creation story, and many of the important Scriptures about God’s plan and promises, this book does something new in unveiling the purposes and love of God.\n\nWhat Daniel shares about the Hebrew word Ruach left a deep imprint on my heart. The spirit and breath of God are an ever-moving, earth-shaping, universe-creating power. But also a mystery that resides in every believer. It’s natural for us to think we are small, and we are in scale, within the vast universe. But if the power that raised Jesus from the dead lives in us, that is a wonder worth revisiting and understanding further so that we can know the full significance it brings to our own lives. In this book, Daniel also explains and reveals the original names of Father God, Jesus and The Holy Spirit, unpacking important revelations in the process. We are able to understand why Their names are not only important, but also the foundation humanity is built upon. What a powerful mystery, and reminder God has given us, once we have an understanding of His Name.\n\nReading this book, I was most surprised by the many meaningful layers of truth that Daniel was able to uncover. Truth that many of the original authors and translators of the Scripture left hovering below the surface of the written word. Here they are explained in a fresh and powerful way that applies to our daily lives.\n\nI believe that in the current state of our world this book provides a timely relevance for readers. Daniel reminds us that there are two different spirits at work in the air that we breathe every day. As we discern that the Spirit of God is different than the spirit of this age, we begin to live in new areas of freedom, health, joy and passion. If every living soul needs breath to live, then each and every one of us will enjoy a fresh, new, holy breath of life!\n\nIn the same way that I never saw or expected to hear how seeds I never knew I was planting grow to fruition, I foresee that the power of Daniel’s thoughts and stories shared in this book will have a wonderful impact in the lives of readers.\n\nSigmund Brouwer (December 30, 2020)\n\nIntroduction\n\nA Word About Breath\n\nThe thing about breathing is it’s automatic. The rhythm of human breath is automated by a network of neurons and muscles surrounding the lungs and throat. But how did this automation begin?\n\nIn February 2019 I discovered three breaths from the lungs of God that were breathed upon humanity and shaped the history of mankind. These breaths from God ultimately revealed to me one of the greatest mysteries I had ever uncovered and understood from my own personal studies in the Bible.\n\nIt began before an annual mission trip to Tanzania, when I asked the Lord for a word that would capture the purpose of our mission. What I received was quite literally one word. But that single word changed my relationship with God. The word was Breath. The unfolding of this journey continues to enlarge my faith and increase my unfading hope in the Creator of everything. This book is about the most epic truth you can ever discover and the story of my journey into this new revelation. I guess when He said, Breath, Yahweh knew what He was talking about.\n\nChapter 1\n\nRuach Elohim - The Spirit of God\n\nIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.\n\n— Genesis 1:1–2 NIV\n\nImagine you are in a vast, dimly lit chamber. Through the darkness you make out the faint outline of a massive painter’s canvas, completely blank. You walk toward it with a strong desire to create. Dense fog envelopes you until you reach the canvas. As you think about your need for paint and supplies, dozens of fresh paint colours appear beside you; a light, fine-tip paintbrush is now in your hand. It feels right to you, and you know exactly how to use it.\n\nThe mood would be better with music. You begin to hear the strings and swells from a full orchestra filling the chamber. The acoustics are fantastic in here. Now you feel charged and even more creative as the sound in the space and new melodies sweep over you. Your hand reaches effortlessly toward the first paint color, dipping into a glossy yellow as your mouth takes over, Let there be light.\n\nA sun forms on the canvas. The darkness of that place is separated by the piercing warm light of the sun. The pace of the music gains intensity, and your creativity flows all the more effortlessly. The paintbrush is no longer in your hand, but it still paints the canvas all the same so long as you continue speaking. Your words become substance the moment they leave your mouth, coming to life on the painting, and the words themselves multiply into creative expressions all their own.\n\nLet dry ground appear. Suddenly, sand becomes beaches, and beaches make way for rocks, and rocks turn into mountains. Looking at the once blank canvas, you begin to smile because what you see is so beautiful. And it is good. The canvas begins to fill from one corner to the other.\n\nAs you exhale with a sigh of deep satisfaction, a star comes out of your mouth and, moving into orbit, becomes indescribably massive. Planets and moons and entire galaxies begin to explode onto the canvas, and as they do, the canvas itself begins to expand and become multidimensional. The chamber you are standing in now begins to fill up with birds, creatures of all kinds, and wild animals innumerable.\n\nOur first introduction to the God of all creation and mankind is as Spirit hovering over a vast ocean, looking at a blank canvas. While the earth is without form and void of life, we find our Creator in the preparation phase, undaunted, like a painter ready to begin a masterpiece. But before"
