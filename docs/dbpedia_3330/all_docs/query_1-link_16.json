Everything changes when she flees to the Forest and is given a treasure—ten silver coins—which she quickly loses. It is up to Jill and Simon, the boy she meets in the Forest, to recover the treasure.\n\nTo so, the Children enter Acchora, a world inhabited by the Drylings who hide in the belly of a dormant volcano under the curse of the Rashtakar, the cruel being who seeks the very treasure Jill has lost. In Vendor, imagination and adventure are forbidden. In Acchora, without them, Jill, Simon and the Drylings have no hope for survival.\n\nOwn it today: Amazon | Chapters/Indigo | Barnes & Noble | iTunes\n\nBook Two\n\nTen Silver Coins: The Battle for Acchora\n\nWith Juria now Queen over a divided nation, to survive above ground the Drylings must unite against the Rashtakar’s armies that begin to fill the land. But Ama’s discovery of wingless refugees on the slope of the burning mountain and a mysterious visitor from a far-away land threaten to further divide the Drylings into factions.\n\nThe battle for Acchora is a fight not only for survival but for the future. Even though Jill and Simon are outsiders caught up in the middle of the drama, without them, the battle for Acchora could be lost.\n\nOwn it today: Amazon | Chapters/Indigo | Barnes & Noble | iTunes"
