So it wasn’t surprising that he would be keen to adapt his harrowing play She Has a Name, which deals with the issue of global human trafficking, into a globe-trotting thriller.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nUnlimited online access to articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nGet exclusive access to the Calgary Herald ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition that you can share, download and comment on.\n\nEnjoy insights and behind-the-scenes analysis from our award-winning journalists.\n\nSupport local journalists and the next generation of journalists.\n\nDaily puzzles including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\n“We are film lovers,” says Kooman. “Whenever I write for the stage I think of the film as well, because why not? Even as we toured across Canada, I know we had one theatre critic say, ‘This would be great as a film.’ It just encouraged us to explore that and to tell it in a bigger way and reach a wider audience.”\n\nKooman wrote the screenplay but gave the ambitious task of shooting the film in Thailand to his brothers, Daniel and Matthew. All three are on the line with the Herald to discuss the film, which opens at the Plaza Theatre on Feb. 10.\n\nShe Has A Name follows the story of an exhausted by still idealistic lawyer (Giovanni Mocibob) who poses as a john in hopes of building a legal case against a sadistic pimp who is trafficking underage girls. He tries to recruit the help of a girl known only as Number 18 (Teresa Ting), slowly building trust with frequent and perilous meetings in the dark backrooms of a Bangkok brothel.\n\nThose familiar with the original work, which featured a Greek-like chorus and actors taking on more than one role, might be surprised at how smoothly it has been transformed into a riveting, fast-paced political thriller.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPart of that was due to Andrew being fairly open to stretching the scope of the story. Shot in and around Bangkok, the film juxtaposes gorgeous shots of Thailand’s wilderness with the insular drama playing out between Mocibob and Ting in the claustrophobic room in a brothel. In the film, the political corruption has been expanded to reach deep into the U.S. government.\n\n“It’s quite true to the heart of the story, but there’s new characters and a whole new scale,” Andrew says.\n\nWhile She Has a Name certainly works as compelling drama, the brothers make no qualms about the fact that it has largely been created to raise awareness of human trafficking and its underage victims.\n\nAfter attending college, Andrew worked for a Christian non-profit organization in Malaysia when he came across child victims of the global sex trade. His brothers, who have made similarly themed documentaries, also came across the issue in their travels.\n\n“I was shocked that I wasn’t aware of the issue,” says Daniel. “When you meet survivors who are coming out of a horrible nightmare into a new story or a new dream, those stories of redemption obviously resonated with us. I just imagined that if I didn’t know about this, then lot of people don’t know about this. So it was just about bringing the issue to a bigger audience and humanizing it.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhich is not to say that the film offers easy solutions or even a particularly happy ending. Throughout the movie, those tasked with helping victims of human trafficking are faced with a daunting network of deep-seated corruption, poverty and indifference. It’s estimated that of the two million children forced into sexual slavery, only one per cent have been rescued.\n\n“I’ve definitely wrestled with that,” says Daniel. “One of the real guideposts for me with this production was that it needed to be sobering reality and a punch to the stomach to the audience. Because when you hear about it and learn about it, that’s what I felt. This does hurt and it does trigger a bit of hopelessness … But ultimately, it should stir us to think we have to change that statistic.”\n\nThe Kooman brothers’ Unveil Studios have offices in both Red Deer and Comox Valley, B.C. There are plans to follow She Has A Name with more adaptations of Andrew’s plays, including We Are The Body, which looks prisoners of conscience in Romania, and Delft Blue, about Nazi occupation in the Netherlands.\n\nFor now, Andrew, Daniel and Matthew see their debut as not only a film but part of a movement.\n\nThrough the website, 20 per cent of money made through rentals or purchases of the Blu-ray will go to organizations such as Iris Cambodia, IJM Canada and Globalact, groups on the front lines in the war against human trafficking.\n\n“We really want to connect the film directly to ending human trafficking” says Matthew.\n\nShe Has a Name will screen from Feb. 10-12 at the Plaza Theatre at 7 p.m. Visit\n\nwww.shehasanamefilm.com/pages/screeings\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
