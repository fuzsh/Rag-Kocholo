        "text": "In the Spring of 2014, we produced (for the first time in the U.S.) Andrew Koomanâ€™s critically acclaimed anti-trafficking drama She Has a Name (see under Performances in the U.S.), which included a 7 run tour from the Summer of 2014 through the Spring of 2016. We were honored to partner with local anti-trafficking organizations such as 3Strands Global/Break Free Run (formerly known as Run For Courage), Courage Worldwide, and Blue Heart International to bring awareness and encourage audience members to take action to end human trafficking in our lifetime. We are dedicated to continue supporting these incredible organizations and using our talents to provoke positive change in our World."
