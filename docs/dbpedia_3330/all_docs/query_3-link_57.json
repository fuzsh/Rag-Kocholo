        "text": "This song taught us a valuable lesson: Don’t use people’s real names in songs. Billie Jean and Eleanor Rigby — probably not actually their names.\n\nMatt Doyle performs the song on our album.\n\nhttps://koomandimond.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/lucys-laugh-featuring-matt-doyle.mp3\n\nThis song actually underwent a semi-significant revision at one point in its life. We got some good feedback from Craig Carnelia and Andrew Lippa when we played the song for them at the Johnny Mercer Songwriting Workshop. After thinking about their notes, we realized that the song didn’t quite “launch” as early as we wanted it to. So, we did some work on it in an attempt to get to the hook faster.\n\nThere are a few things we miss about the old version, but overall, the new one works better.\n\nHere’s the original, sung by Anderson Davis:\n\nAnd Matt Doyle performing the revised version:\n\nLyrics below.\n\nLucy’s Laugh\n\nHer head dents the pillow.\n\nWe’re barely awake.\n\nWe synchronize\n\nEach breath we take.\n\nI’m lost in this moment,\n\nLike I’ve never seen\n\nThose blue grey eyes\n\nWith specks of green.\n\nAnd then it begins:\n\nShe looks up at me.\n\nShe suddenly grins,\n\nAnd her laugh breaks free.\n\nHer eyes spark.\n\nHer lip twists.\n\nAnd nothing else that I know exists.\n\nThe world stands still\n\nOn my behalf.\n\nAnd I find that I’m in love\n\nWith Lucy’s laugh.\n\nIt’s kind of annoying.\n\nThe slightest bit shrill.\n\nYeah, it’s obnoxious,\n\nBut even still…\n\nCompletely contagious.\n\nNo possible cure.\n\nThe heart beneath\n\nIs brash but pure.\n\nAnd all of my fears\n\nAre suddenly gone.\n\nThe world disappears\n\nAs her laugh goes on.\n\nHer eyes spark.\n\nHer lip twists.\n\nAnd nothing else that I know exists.\n\nThe world stands still\n\nOn my behalf.\n\nAnd I find that I’m in love\n\nWith Lucy’s laugh.\n\nCause each imperfection I see\n\nMakes her so much more perfect to me.\n\nShe has flaws far beyond her control\n\nBut when she laughs\n\nI see straight to her soul.\n\nTo call it melodic\n\nNo one would dare.\n\nIt’s quite off key,\n\nBut I’m well aware\n\nMore beautiful music\n\nI can’t compose.\n\nThe notes fall short,\n\nCause heaven knows\n\nMy best efforts fail.\n\nThere’s simply no way.\n\nMy words are too frail,\n\nCause all I can say"
