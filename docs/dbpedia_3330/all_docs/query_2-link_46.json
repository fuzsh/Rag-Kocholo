        "text": "She has a Name\n\nby Andrew Kooman\n\nBenefitting GEMS.\n\nCurrently, there are an estimated 27 million slaves in the world today. That’s the highest recorded number of slaves in history.\n\nHuman trafficking has been identified as the largest human rights violation in the history of mankind. Human trafficking is the second largest criminal enterprise in the world, after drug smuggling and arms dealing.\n\nWe will show how Human Trafficking occurs as a global epidemic in the production of Andrew Kooman’s SHE HAS A NAME, followed by an educational, talk-back conversation with audiences including the following organizations: Coalition Against Trafficking in Women, RestoreNYC, and Braking The Silence as well as a distinguished Psychotherapists. Audiences in this Off-Broadway production will leave being fully aware of the scope of this global-horror and what can be done to prevent it and to support victims. A percentage of Box Office Proceeds will benefit these organizations.\n\nSynopsis: The two main characters are a young lawyer; and Number 18, a young female prostitute who claims to be fifteen years old and has been a prostitute for six years. The drama centers on his infiltration of a brothel ring that is trafficking girls. The lawyer comes to believe that Number 18 could be a key witness to a human trafficking incident and tries to gain her trust and persuade her to testify against the ring. The victimized child in the play is known only by the number 18 to reflect that traffickers often dehumanize their victims by giving them a new name or simply a number.\n\nThe Adding Machine\n\nby Elmer Rice\n\nBenefitting Safe Horizon.\n\nSynopsis: The author of this play takes us through Mr. Zero’s trial, execution, excursion and arrest going into the afterlife. During the whole series of this episodic journey Mr. Zero is surprisingly oblivious to his deepest needs, wants and desires. The story focuses on Mr. Zero, an accountant at a large, faceless company. After 25 years at his job, he discovers that he will be replaced by an adding machine. In anger and pain, he snaps and kills his boss. Mr. Zero is then tried for murder, is found guilty and hanged. He wakes up in a heaven-like setting known as the “Elysian Fields.” Mr. Zero meets a man named Shrdlu, then begins to operate an adding machine until Lieutenant Charles, the boss of the Elysian Fields, comes to tell Zero that he is a waste of space and his soul is going to be sent back to the earth to be reused. The play ends with Zero following a very attractive girl named Hope (who may not actually exist) off stage."
