Through a blend of documentary filmmaking, visual effects, and skillful biking, viewers are taken on an eight-month journey with trail builders Mark Matthews and Chris Snodgrass as they craft a new trail for the community. This short film has been featured in a number of festivals around the world, including the Banff Mountain Film Festival.\n\nED CARSWELL\n\nAs a documentary filmmaker, Ed searches out projects about cultural and biological diversity.

The film will weave K’ómoks First Nation history alongside the work of transforming an industrial site back to a vibrant, natural part of the K’ómoks Estuary.\n\nA key filmmaking component will be to capture engaging interviews and work them seamlessly into the action on the ground.\n\nMAXWEL HOHN\n\nMaxwel is a nature and wildlife cinematographer and photographer who grew up on the Sunshine Coast and who now uses his commercial diving certification and experience to create films that showcase our world’s underwater diversity.

Through her work, she aims to bring the community together and show viewers how great the Comox Valley truly is.\n\nShe has recently completed a promotional video for the Courtenay Medicine Shoppe Pharmacy and is currently working with the Local Refillery.\n\nCHUKWUMUOBI OBASI\n\nChukwumuobi enjoys all facets of filmmaking, from writing scripts and directing to producing and post-production work. The pilot for his web series, Homestay, was filmed in and around the Comox Valley using local crew and talent. Homestay is about an African student in Canada who loses his sponsorship and must figure out how to pay next term’s tuition to avoid possible deportation.\n\nChukwumuobi is currently collaborating with Bobby Herron on a documentary about how artists who contribute to Cumberland’s appealing vibe are being forced out by the rising cost of living.\n\nSHANE PHILIP\n\nSOUL FILMS\n\nFilmmaker Shane Philip is always looking for new stories to tell.
