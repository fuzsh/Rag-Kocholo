I'm especially interested in how creative people use their art and talents to make real world impact.\n\nAs creators and believers of any type, we have a huge inheritance from people that came before us and I want to be part of cultivating community here, and building that inheritance into the future. If that resonates with you, you'll find like minds and connection here.\n\nIf you follow me on social, you’ll know that I sometimes give a window into #dadlife, overshare about my love for trees and am always looking for the perfect cup of coffee.\n\nWhat kind of content you can expect here\n\nOriginal fiction, poetry and articles you won’t find anywhere else.\n\nA companion podcast where I’ll geek out about writing called Things I Said Out Loud.\n\nDetails about the new adventure my talented brothers Matthew and Daniel Kooman and I are on as we build our new streaming platform UnveilTV.\n\nArticles on how creative people use their art, faith and talents to make real world impact.\n\nYou’ll also get an inside look at upcoming work and you can join a meaningful conversation about art, faith and life.\n\nWhy go paid?\n\nIf you enjoy the content, consider going paid.
