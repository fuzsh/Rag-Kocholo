So I’ll be sharing the submissions in batches of 40 or so throughout the next few weeks.\n\nI meant it when I said if you submitted something, I would share it (unless it was obviously unhinged or would create serious difficulties for me). If you don’t see your piece in any of the roundup posts over the next several weeks, it may have gotten lost in my inbox.
