They were recently given the awards for Best Music Video and the New Filmmakers Awards at the International Christian Visual Media (ICVM) film and media conference in Nashville on Saturday, July 15th. Writer and Producer Andrew Kooman says they were honored to be recognized by their fellow filmmakers. “It was amazing because the ICVM awards bring together Christian filmmakers from around the world and primarily the United States, and really the who’s who of filmmakers is there, so it was a great time to network, and it was really amazing to be honoured among our peers.”  googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/lol-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1639495237215-bbm1'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1639495237215]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  Kooman says working on films with his brothers has been an awarding, and sometimes challenging experiences. “This is our thing, we are really working project to project, and we love bringing stories to life and so we focus on documentary film and feature film. There are some challenges with it, but we are definitely excited about the projects we are working on and the stories we are able to bring to people.” The award was for a music video called Heal Me by artist Elizabeth Smith, and Kooman explains it features three stories of people facing difficult, modern day challenges. The Kooman Brothers next project is a documentary with a working title of Dream, which follows the stories of real people pursuing their dreams, to be filmed across North America, and in Tanzania.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/lol-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1639495237215-bbm2'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1639495237215]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  You can learn more about Unveil Studios at their website, unveilstudios.com.
