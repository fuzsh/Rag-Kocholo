        "text": "JU -Did the friendship start there?\n\nShibuya - When I came here, I didn't feel very comfortable in the presence of Professor Lattes, already a global personality at the time. In a way, I was afraid to talk to him. Afterwards, the friendship continued, with setbacks, as in all great friendships. I remember, for example, that in 1977, when I was his doctoral thesis advisor, he said to me while reading a text: \"Look, we're not going to continue this discussion until you stop this business of calling me a sir and/or teacher\". It was a reasonable difficulty, because of my ancestry. For us, descendants of oriental people, respect for older and more experienced people has become a rule. He knew that. And he poked me...\n\nAfter 1986, with his retirement, I took responsibility for the research group, and began to exchange more ideas with him. At the time, he consulted me about what he should do – whether or not he should retire. I said it was his right, but I asked him to help us conduct the collaboration project with Japanese researchers.\n\nJU - What did this experience result in?\n\nShibuya - An important event appeared that we are still trying to understand to this day. Because of its appearance, we named it Andromeda.\n\nJU - What exactly was this event?\n\nShibuya - It is a record of many ionizing particles, grouped in a small area, totaling a very high energy, on the order of 20 quadrillion electron volts.\n\nJU -Does this program continue to this day?\n\nShibuyia - In fact, this collaboration began in 1962, at USP. With Professor Lattes' transfer to Unicamp, she was brought to Campinas. Unicamp then became the main Brazilian laboratory within the scope of the project. The program continues, at least while I'm here, active...\n\nJU - What exactly does this experience consist of?\n\nShibuya - Professor Lattes' professorship thesis, which was not defended for a number of reasons, included the idea of ​​collaborating with the Japanese, who at the time were looking for a more appropriate location to carry out experiments on cosmic rays at high altitudes. Chacaltaya, in addition to having an altitude above 5 thousand meters, is easily accessible and had already been used by Cesar Lattes to observe three decades of pi-mu decay. We call the phenomenon, which the collaboration set out to study, multiple meson production, which had been discovered previously.\n\nAll this cooperative work began with a letter from Japanese theoretical physicist Hideki Yukawa, addressed to the discoverer of this particle, Cesar Lattes. A reproduction of this letter appears in the thesis not defended by Lattes. In fact, it was a quartet of notable researchers: Shoichi Sakata, Mituo Taketani, Hideki Yukawa and Shin-ItiroTomonaga, the latter two winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics on different occasions. Yoichi Fujimoto and Shun-Iti Hasegawa, who were students of the four researchers, continue to collaborate on the project to this day.\n\nJU - Could you talk about the work that each of them did?\n\nShibuya - Yukawa, who modeled this particle, was certainly one of the group's standouts. But they were all of the highest category. Sakata, for example, was the first person to give a model of particle composition, later improved and modified by the American physicist Murray Gell-Mann. This model is called \"quark\". Tomonaga, as he said, is a Nobel Prize winner. Taketani, in turn, despite being the youngest, was the most enthusiastic about the Brazil-Japan collaboration. He was in Brazil three times. In one of them, he was the scientific director of the Institute of Theoretical Physics, currently belonging to Unesp. He brought several collaborators, including some former students.\n\nJU - What was the greatest characteristic of the Physics Institute in its initial phase?\n\nShibuya - Improvisation. The equipment was almost artisanal. This aspect is one of the highlights of Cesar’s personality. He didn't like very sophisticated things.\n\nJU - Did he ever work with computers?\n\nShibuya - Yes. Some stories are unpublishable (laughs). In the beginning, when there were these large computer terminals, he managed to manipulate them but soon got bored. On one occasion, he asked if there wasn't a command to send everything to that place...\n\nJU - What, in your opinion, were other striking characteristics of Lattes’ personality?\n\nShibuya - Patriotism, without a doubt, was one of the most present. This is evident in at least a few episodes of his career. Lattes could pursue a scientific career abroad, in any country, but he preferred to return to Brazil. He wanted to help develop the country. This is clear in the choice of names for the so-called \"balls of fire\", all baptized by him with Tupi-Guarani words.\n\nJU - Colleagues said that Lattes' intuition was sharp. Do you agree?\n\nShibuya - Undoubtedly. Perhaps one of the most emblematic things about this intuition occurred in the observation of the pi meson. He told us – and taught us – that the discovery he made was the use of borax, in Bristol. He told us that the particle was a consequence of this observation, the result of his insight. Another component of his personality was his playful manner. Not infrequently, he played pranks on his colleagues. On one of my trips to Bolivia, I was the only civilian on board a FAB plane. Before the subsequent trip to Bolivia, he told me that, in a Bolivian newspaper, a note appeared which cited the visit, before the military coup that overthrew the then Bolivian president, of a Brazilian military plane in which an SNI agent was present. .\n\nJU - And ideologically, how would you frame it?\n\nShibuya - He once said that scientists cannot have dogmas. One thing he commented on was the fact that the money for the creation of the CBPF was taken from the same fund that financed the repression of communism. And the Center even housed socialist sympathizers.\n\nIn 1964, on the eve of the coup, Lattes went to Pisa, Italy, after intuiting that something was going to happen when he saw the movement of army trucks in the streets. One of the people he trusted that Lattes brought from USP was Zuhair Warwar – who later became professor Zeferino Vaz's chief of staff. Warwar hid Mário Schenberg, who had been elected constituent deputy by the Communist Party and was being sought by the military. Schenberg, like Leite Lopes, was impeached by the military regime.\n\nJU - When did you last see Cesar Lattes?\n\nShibuya - I went to visit him five days before his death. He stammered, \"We need to rescue Taketani.\" This rescue probably has several connotations. In addition to being a Marxist, Taketani was arrested during the war because he opposed the conflict. He later took a stand against the atomic bomb, even receiving death threats. He, for example, could not enter the United States, which denied him a visa. Lattes, as a nationalist that he was, didn't like certain North American fads. Today, this rescue certainly does not involve the political part, but rather the physical part itself. This is necessary because Taketani is perhaps one of the most important personalities in the Brazil-Japan Collaboration, although he did not work on it directly. He gave great encouragement to the project until the end of his life.\n\nJU - How do you assess the importance of Cesar Lattes on the national and international scientific scene?\n\nShibuya - This is quite visible in the various physics books. This observation of the meson and another particle he couldn't observe, called the neutrino, was a game-changer. As it was non-ionizing – it has no electrical charge – it was impossible to observe directly.\n\nCesar was tasked with studying the neutron with emulsions. He made a reaction in such a way that the neutron was produced. And on this occasion he discovered that borax stabilized the image. He suddenly intuited that he could catch something rare, which is the pi meson. For this reason, I think, he avoided using the word \"discovery\" of the meson."
