I realized at once that he had made great contributions to the development of physics in Japan in the early twentieth century. I also discovered that there were few scholarly studies on him, and decided to write a short paper in order to analyze his role in the Japanese physics community in the 1930s and 1940s. In March 1999, I interviewed Professor Emeritus Yoichiro Nambu of the University of Chicago with Professor Emeritus Laurie M. Brown of Northwestern University. Both Nambu and Brown were surprised when I naively asked questions like “How good a physicist was Nishina?” That interview not only reconfirmed the importance of Nishina in the history of physics in Japan but also led me to abandon my original plan for a paper in favor of writing a full biography of Nishina. After returning from Chicago, I received an e-mail from Brown. He stated that both Nambu and he agreed that I should write a biography of Nishina. Brown even offered to arrange for it to be published by the Institute of Physics (IOP) in Bristol, England. I hesitated for a while but finally decided to take on this great intellectual challenge. The Yoshio Nishina project began in the summer of 1999. I would like to add special notes for Japanese titles and the arrangement of Japanese names in the book. Although family names precede given names in Japan, I have put given names first for two reasons. First, those Japanese scientists who are featured in this book published their most important works in English or in German, and adopted the Western way of presenting their names in their papers. So, the central figure of this biography was known to the scientific world as “Yoshio Nishina,” not as “Nishina Yoshio.” Second, this book is intended for the English speaking readers who are not familiar with the East Asian naming convention. I translated most of Japanese titles of books and papers into English and added “(Japanese)” at the end, but simply romanized the Japanese titles of journals or publishers.

First of all, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Yoichiro Nambu and Laurie M. Brown who introduced me to this wonderful opportunity. I also would like to thank Silvan S. Schweber, Ewrin N. Hiebert, Shigeru Nakayama, and Takehiko Hashimoto for their encouragement and interest. Sam Schweber read the final draft and gave me a lot of worthwhile criticism and comments for revision. A condensed version of Chapter 6 of the book was published in the Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences, and I am grateful to Rod Home and John Heilbron who read the manuscript carefully and made the most useful comments and corrections. This book owes much to recent works on Nishina by Morris Low, Shizue Hinokawa, Kenji Ito and Dong Hoon Oh, with whom I had the pleasure to discuss our common interest. I thank Ito, Oh, Boumsoung Kim, and Hyungsub Choi who helped me to find some manuscripts and papers. The Department of the History of Science and Technology at Johns Hopkins University gave me two opportunities to read excerpts from the work in progress. The staff of the Nishina Memorial Foundation, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Niels Bohr Archive, Special Collections of North Carolina State University, American Institute of Physics, Caltech Institute Archives, and the Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, gave me access to many valuable manuscripts and photographs for the book, and I am grateful to them. I am especially grateful to Ms. Topsy Neher Smalley, the daughter of H. Victor Neher, who generously provided me with Neher’s 1935 journal describing his trip to Japan and some photographs. John Navas, first at IOP and then Taylor & Francis, has been my principal contact for the publication of the book, and I would like to extend my special thanks to him. I have been in poor health for some years and he has been most patient with my several delays of the final draft. The staff of Taylor & Francis has been also very helpful in preparing the book for publication. Lastly but not least, I would like to thank my family for their warm encouragement.\n\nDong: “IP801_C000” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE ix — #9\n\nDong: “IP801_C000” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE x — #10\n\nIntroduction Japanese scientists and historians of science honor Yoshio Nishina as the “pioneer of modern physics in Japan,” “founder of modern science in Japan,” or as the “Christopher Columbus of Japanese physics.” Hideki Yukawa, the first Japanese Nobel Laureate (physics, 1949), stated that without Nishina his generation could not have achieved such brilliant success in elementary particle physics during the 1930s and thereafter. Another Japanese Nobel Laureate (physics, 1965), Sin-itiro Tomonaga, made the same point in his eulogy of Nishina in 1951: “He made us aware of the modern methods of physical research.” Eri Yagi concluded his article on Nishina for the Dictionary of Scientific Biography as follows: “Without Nishina’s return from Europe with the principles of quantum mechanics, these two physicists [Yukawa and Tomonaga] might never have developed their potentials to the fullest.”1 In 1991 there were several celebrations for the centenary of Nishina’s birth: an international symposium was held in Tokyo to discuss Nishina’s contributions to twentieth-century physics; a special documentary videotape with the title, “Nishina Yoshio: Father of Modern Physics,” was coproduced by his hometown and the Nishina Memorial Foundation; and a special stamp was issued by the Japanese postal service on his birthday (December 6). Similarly, in 2005, Toshimitsu Yamazaki (Tokyo University and Riken) paid a tribute to the “Father of Nuclear and Particle Physics in Japan” with his paper, “Yoshio Nishina and the Dawn of Nuclear and Particle Physics,” in a special session for the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Nishina Memorial Foundation.2 I first encountered Yoshio Nishina in 1992 while examining the Cavendish Laboratory’s annual photographs for my book on the history of the Cavendish. As I looked at the image of the young Nishina in the 1922 annual photograph, I vaguely remembered his name and asked myself, “What was this Japanese doing in this center of experimental physics?” I soon learned from fragmentary English sources that Nishina was trained under Niels Bohr for several years, that he coauthored the famous Klein–Nishina formula, and that during the 1930s and 1940s he contributed significantly to the development of several branches of physics in Japan. Later, after examining Japanese sources commenting on Nishina, I came to believe that I should investigate Nishina’s life and works further. Thus I began what I considered at the time to be a “little” research project. I quickly found that appraising Nishina’s role in the international physics community and in the Japanese scientific community was more difficult than I had anticipated. The English sources hinted that the Klein–Nishina formula might be Nishina’s only distinguished contribution to physics. For example, the Dictionary of Scientific Biography did not have an article for Nishina in its first edition in 1973.\n\nDong: “IP801_C000” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE xi — #11\n\nIt only added a short article for him in its supplementary volume in 1990 even though Nishina had died in 1951.3 Therefore I struggled for some time to justify why I should study this seemingly “less important” physicist. On the other hand, as the first paragraph of the introduction indicates, the Japanese sources unanimously hailed him as a great scientist and as a perfect teacher. If so, why has the international scientific community and Western historians of science neglected him for so long? Getting to the bottom of this puzzle became one of the reasons for writing this biography of Yoshio Nishina. I started the project to answer the following three questions: what kind of scientist (or physicist) was Nishina?; how good a physicist was he?; and how much and in what way did he contribute to the development of twentieth-century physics in Japan and the world? To answer these questions, I concentrated on analyzing the scientific works of Nishina and his junior researchers in the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (Riken). I will argue that Nishina assumed three roles: a very competent researcher, a formidable teacher, and a shrewd administrator. By performing these three different, but closely related, roles magnificently, he not only made a significant contribution to the emergence and growth of a research network that eventually produced two Nobel Prize winners, but also raised the level of Japanese physics overall.4 While writing the biography, I have met several difficulties, most of which resulted from the simple fact that Nishina was a Japanese physicist. Clearly Nishina was Japanese. Thus, the social and cultural environments in which he had worked and had trained the subsequent generations of Japanese physicists were quite different from those in the West. Although Japan was a successful example of industrialization and Westernization in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it was still an East Asian country in which very different traditions dictated people’s everyday life and thought. The teacher–student relationship and the funding system for research, for example, were not what they were in the West. In Japan, the prefix of “professor” meant not only a professional title but also the embodiment of respect and authority: therefore Yukawa and Tomonaga often called Nishina as “Professor Nishina” in their memoirs, although Nishina had never been appointed professor at any Japanese university. The question to be answered is therefore: how much did being Japanese influence Nishina’s scientific work and contribute to his success? On the other hand, Nishina was a physicist who had been deeply influenced by the Western research environment. After graduating from the Westernized Tokyo Imperial University and doing some research at Riken, he was thoroughly trained in Europe for more than 7 years at two leading research institutes: the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge and Niels Bohr’s Institute of Theoretical Physics in Copenhagen. His most famous work, the Klein–Nishina formula, was produced while he was still working in Europe. Nishina befriended many distinguished physicists in Europe, including several Nobel Prize winners, who treated him as their equal. He spoke German and Danish fluently and English fairly well. Also Nishina was widely perceived as introducing the new quantum mechanics and a new research environment into Japan. Thus Nishina was one of the most Westernized Japanese physicists in the first half of the twentieth century. How, then, could he successfully manage his Western traits in the Japanese environment?\n\nDong: “IP801_C000” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE xii — #12\n\nPerhaps a partial explanation is Nishina’s unique quality that he described as “a fairly elastic adaptability to new conditions.”5 On the one hand, he was typically Japanese. He had been a model student from elementary school to university. He had behaved exactly as the typical Japanese did when he met and dealt with senior Japanese scientists or nonscientists outside his laboratory. That was why during the 1930s he excelled as the secretary of the 10th subcommittee of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Scientific Research that subsidized his cosmic ray research and later the construction of two cyclotrons; why he became the spokesman of science during World War II; and why he was regarded as the statesman of Japanese science during the American occupation that followed. On the other hand, Nishina behaved just like the leading Western scientists in his laboratory at Riken: he produced quality work in new fields of physics, became part of the international network, acted in an unauthoritarian manner, partook in open discussion and collaboration with junior researchers, and organized research groups of junior researchers with different educational backgrounds. Owing to this symbiosis of his Japanese and Western attitudes, Nishina enjoyed unanimous and unprecedented respect from both physicists and nonscientists. Nishina’s being a Japanese physicist also raises some problems of interpretation. In East Asia, such celebrated figures as Nishina traditionally are depicted as “perfect” men, flawless leaders whose mistakes or failures (if any) were not due to faults of their own. Criticism of heroes, particularly great sensei [teachers], is not permitted. Most Japanese sources on Nishina faithfully follow this tradition. Under such circumstances, one could doubt whether a historian of science who is culturally East Asian (as I am) can achieve an objective appraisal of Nishina’s contributions. I agree with my Japanese colleagues that Nishina was a great man. Yet my appreciation of his greatness is based on ideas and opinions that are not necessarily those expressed in traditional Japanese scholarship, particularly in areas on how and why Nishina’s role and contributions were critical to the development of the Japanese physics community. In studying Nishina’s life and work, my goal has been to appraise his contributions accurately, and any such evaluation, honestly attempted, runs the risk of being somewhat critical. Another problem of interpretation is that many Western physicists and historians of science regard the success of Japanese physicists since the 1930s as the exception rather than the rule. Perhaps as a result, Westerners have made little effort to incorporate the accomplishments of Japanese physicists into the larger framework of the history of physics. Worse, when studying the history of science in Japan, Westerners have tended to concentrate on a few topics such as Nishina’s cooperation with Klein in the calculation of the Compton scattering cross section. They, however, often neglected Nishina’s role in the spread of the fledging field of quantum mechanics in Japan and the construction of two cyclotrons. It should be emphasized that the latter was far more than a simple transfer of know-how from Ernest O. Lawrence’s Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley to Riken. Although Western scholarship has begun to recognize the merits of some twentieth-century Japanese physicists, in particular theoretical physicists like Yukawa and Tomonaga, the Japanese physics community in which those scientists worked has received scant attention.6 Experimental works by Japanese physicists in\n\nDong: “IP801_C000” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE xiii — #13\n\nthe first half of the twentieth century has never been explored seriously by any Western scholars. Nor have Westerners endeavored to understand the Japanese physics community of the twentieth century within its broader intellectual context. Most fail to appreciate the community’s independence and importance, too. Language barriers undoubtedly were an obstacle but in fact they are a convenient excuse since many important scientific works by Japanese physicists were published in English or other Western languages in either prestigious Western or Japanese journals. This short biography of Yoshio Nishina certainly does not solve all these problems mentioned above. However, if the book provides readers with new perspectives and more questions, I will have achieved my goal. I sincerely hope that more extensive biographies of Nishina with fresh perspectives will appear in the near future. Yoshio Nishina certainly has the greatness to deserve not just one but many biographies.\n\nNOTES 1 Masao Suzuki and Ryogo Kubo (eds.), Evolutionary Trends in the Physical Sciences: Proceedings of the Yoshio Nishina Centennial Symposium, Tokyo, Japan, December 5–7, 1990 (Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1991); Sin-itiro Tomonaga, “Dr. Nishina,” in Makinosuke Matsui and Hiroshi Ezawa (eds.), Sin-itiro Tomonaga: Life of a Japanese Physicist, translated by Cheryl Fujimoto and Takako Sano (Tokyo: MYU, 1995), pp. 11–114 on p. 114; Hideki Yukawa interview with John A.

His family had gained local distinction in the 1830s, when Yoshio’s grandfather, Arimoto, used his civil engineering skills to settle a dispute between Shinjo and a neighboring village over possession of some salt-making fields. In recognition of this service, the local daimyo (feudal lord) bestowed samurai status on Arimoto and one of his sons, Arihito. Yoshio’s father, Arimasa, was the fourth son of Arimoto and inherited some of the family’s farming and salt-making fields. He married Tsune, a daughter of the headman of a distant town, Takafuta, in Hiroshima Prefecture. The couple had five sons and four daughters (Yoshio being the eighth). Arimasa died when Yoshio was 16 years old. Yoshio’s eldest brother, Teisaku, 20 years older than Yoshio, inherited the house, salt-making and farming business, and responsibilities as head of the family, including the role of father to his siblings. Yoshio’s second eldest brother, Empei, was an inventor. Yasuo, the third son in line, was an electrical engineer. Masamichi, 3 years younger than Yoshio, died young in 1919. Three of Yoshio’s four sisters married their cousins. The youngest, Toku, who was very close to Yoshio, married into a successful industrial family, the Uchida family of the nearby city of Kurashiki. The Uchida family later would financially support Nishina’s stay in Europe. Yoshio was born in the heart of one of the most glorious and turbulent times in Japanese history, the Meiji period (1868–1912). This was the period during which Japan transformed itself into a modern, industrialized nation.2 A strong new central government in Tokyo abolished the old feudal system and enthusiastically adopted Western-style systems of politics, economics, education, science, and technology. Japan’s new cabinet and parliament ran relatively smoothly. Its infant educational and public health systems quickly surpassed those of many Western countries, and its new railway and telegraph lines rapidly networked the country. Japanese industry began to dominate trade in the Far East and Southeast Asia by manufacturing and exporting products that, although less technologically sophisticated than Western products, were more familiar and thus more acceptable to Asian consumers. Japan’s most surprising development in the eyes of the rest of the world was its emergence as a major military power in Asia. In 1894–1895 Japan’s modernized armed forces defeated the Chinese army and navy on the Korean peninsula and then, in 1904–1905, vanquished Russian forces on land in Manchuria and at sea in the Tsushima Straight between Korea and Japan. 1\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 1 — #1\n\n2\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\nIn this rapidly changing environment, a family’s fortune rose or fell depending on its members’ ability to adapt. The Nishina family’s fortune was hamstrung by its ties to the dying feudal system. Thus, the local paper currency that the Nishina family had issued for local use became worthless when the central government issued the new national currency. The failure of the family-owned company accelerated the decline of Nishina family’s fortune.3 In December 1907, Empei received a patent for his fire-proof paint, which earned praise from the influential Yomiuri Shimbun (Yomiuri Newspaper) in the following year. Teisaku, head of the family, decided to set up a company, Nishina & Co., to manufacture and sell Empei’s paint and other inventions, and invested a good part of the family fortune in the company. Empei’s products, however, proved ineffective and the business rapidly declined. By late 1913, money had become so tight for the Nishina family that Teisaku was unable to send Yoshio his monthly allowance regularly.4 To restore their fortune, the Nishina family looked to the younger generation, and particularly to Yoshio, the family’s most brilliant member. This expectation, as asserted by the Japanese historian of science, Kenji Ito, greatly influenced Nishina’s decisions, especially his choice of career. Nishina Yoshio’s great goal was to restore the house of Nishina. His search for success, his training to be an engineer, his entrepreneurial ambitions — all aimed at a restoration of the family fortune of the Nishina clan.5\n\nHowever, Yoshio did not fulfil his family’s hope that he would rebuild their fortune. Instead, his great contribution was made to the Japanese physics community.\n\n1.2 YOSHIO NISHINA: THE STUDENT When Yoshio entered school at the age of seven, he became a model student and remained so throughout his years of formal education.6 As an elementary school student in his native village of Shinjo, he earned straight A’s in subjects that included Japanese, arithmetic, and ethics. His performance at Shinjo’s higher elementary school, which he entered in 1901, and then at the neighboring Kamogata’s higher elementary school, to which he moved in 1904 after the Shinjo school was closed, earned Yoshio a graduation award for academic distinction from the prefectural governor in March 1905. His academic record for the next five years of schooling in Okayama, to which he moved to enter that city’s middle school, was unmatched in the school’s history: he earned A’s in every subject every year, ironically, except in physics in his fifth year (Figure 1.1). A letter that Yoshio wrote to his younger brother Masamichi in 1910 sheds light on Yoshio’s attitude toward hard work.7 In that letter, Yoshio advised his brother to prepare for every class on the previous day, to listen carefully in class, to review the material on the following day, and to review all subjects during the weekend, just as he himself had done in the middle school. Yoshio also found time for sports in middle school: tennis became his favorite and life-long hobby. Yoshio’s stellar performance at Okayama Middle School, from which he graduated in March 1910, qualified him for acceptance by more prestigious high schools in Tokyo and Kyoto,\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 2 — #2\n\nYouth\n\n3\n\nFIGURE 1.1 Yoshio Nishina in Youth.

The Sixth High School in Okayama admitted Yoshio in April 1910 without requiring him to take the usual entrance examination. The high school was noted\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 3 — #3\n\n4\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\nfor its extraordinary discipline. Its principal, a retired army captain named Sentaro Kaneko, maintained a Spartan environment in which “samurai-like simplicity and fortitude were valued and loyalty to the state and emperor was unquestioned.”8 Nishina continued being the top in his class during his years at the Sixth High School. Yoshio’s entrance to high school presented him with the important decision of selecting his major subject of study. Among the options available, he excluded law, literature, science, and agriculture because they did not guarantee financial success in the Japanese society of the day. He considered medicine, but then abandoned the idea because a botched operation in his childhood had deprived him of his sense of smell. Engineering thus seemed the best choice. However, before his second year began in September 1911, Yoshio had to request a year’s leave from school because of the pleurisy.9 As his high school graduation approached, Yoshio again had to choose his major field of study, this time for his university undergraduate. Yoshio’s personal tastes clearly inclined toward scholarship but it was hardly the path most likely to restore his family’s fortune. He approached his elder brothers for advice. Teisaku analyzed Yoshio’s four possible career choices: scholar, civil servant, businessman, and engineer.10 Although Yoshio had the qualities of a good scholar, Teisaku warned him that scholarship would not bring him sufficient income. Since civil service and business were not good matches with Yoshio’s talents, this left engineering, a field Teisaku described as much closer to scholarship, “something between” civil service and business. Empei, the inventor, advised Yoshio that electrical, civil, and mining engineering were well-paying professions but that, if Yoshio wanted to become a scholar, mechanical engineering would be the best choice.11 Yasuo, the electrical engineer, considered civil and mining engineering as the most lucrative career choices and mechanical and electrical engineering as the most intellectually stimulating.12 Yoshio applied to the Department of Electrical Engineering at Tokyo Imperial University, and was accepted. However, Yasuo, who had reconsidered his advice, recommended civil engineering as the best choice, with electrical engineering as only the next best. He warned Yoshio: In any case, the goal is to gain fame and fortune . . . . So, you only need to choose the best career to promote yourself . . . . If you wish to become a scholar, electrical engineering would be the most interesting, since it is a new field with a lot of possibility to make new inventions. However, a scholar must be prepared to give up money.13\n\nConcerned that his decision to study electrical engineering would hamper his prospects for restoring the family fortune, Yoshio immediately sent a plea to the dean of the College of Engineering asking for a transfer from the Department of Electrical Engineering to the Department of Civil Engineering because of “family matters.”14 The dean however denied his request. In September 1914 Yoshio entered Tokyo Imperial University. A flare-up of his pleurisy in the spring of 1915 made it impossible for him to take his final examination in June, so he had to repeat his first academic year. Again he excelled in his studies during his first academic year at the university (1915–1916) ranking second among\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 4 — #4\n\nYouth\n\n5\n\n43 students in the Department of Electrical Engineering with a grade point average of 92.4.15 In the next academic year, he was the first. Tokyo Imperial University’s Department of Electrical Engineering provided Nishina with a thorough grounding in theory and also rigorous practical training. Ito has summarized the three-year program as follows: The first year focused on fundamental skills and knowledge necessary to electrical engineering. A little less than half of the class time was devoted to lectures. The principal subjects included electromagnetism, mathematics, dynamics, and thermodynamics. In the second year, more practical subjects came into the curriculum, and lecture courses related to power network occupied the largest portion of the instruction. Such courses included design of electric plants, power transmission and distribution, electrical lighting, design of generators, dynamos, and converters. Although not given as much time, alternating current theory and electrical railroad were taught in the second year. There was little formal instruction in the third year, which students would typically use to write their thesis. The lecture-style instruction took less than a half of the class time. In the first year, drawing and experiment occupied 23% and 30% [respectively] of the total class time of forty hours per week on average. Drawing was obviously crucially important for future engineers. They learned not only projective geometry but also how to draft actual designs of electrical engineering products. The Department took the training in drawing very seriously. Students were required to have their works book-bound and submitted to the Department, of which library would preserve their études of drawings permanently along with their thesis. ... In the second and third years, the students were required to take a “practical training.” The experience of practical training differed among students, it specifically being decided in consultation with the academic adviser . . . . For his third year, [Nishina] commuted to the Testing Department of Shibaura Engineering Works from January 15, 1919, working everyday from 7 to 5.16\n\nNishina’s academic adviser was the energetic Hiderato Ho, who, despite being the youngest full professors in the department, was the most influential. Ho’s emphasis on “graphical or pictorial understanding of electrical phenomena” and his “theoretical approach to electrical engineering” deeply influenced generations of students.17 Nishina credited Ho with teaching him “how to grasp the physical meaning of things.”18 Ho authored a book on the theory of alternating current, one of the four books that most influenced Nishina during his undergraduate studies. The other three books were James H. Jeans’ The Mathematical Theory of Electricity and Magnetism, Charles P. Steinmetz’ Theory of Calculation of Alternating Current Phenomena, and Engelbert Arnold’s Wechselstromtechnik.19 It was Ho who suggested Nishina’s thesis topic, a theoretical investigation of the three-phase alternating current generator, motor, and transformer, and who arranged for Nishina to work and collect data for his thesis in the testing laboratory of Shibaura Engineering Works.20 Impressed by Nishina’s ability, Shibaura Engineering offered Nishina a permanent position even before he graduated, but Nishina envisioned a different career\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 5 — #5\n\n6\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\npath for himself and declined the offer. A few months before graduation, he wrote a letter to his eldest brother Teisaku: “Since electrical engineering already has been fully developed, I would like to study electro-chemistry. I am planning to study chemistry in graduate school for a year and then . . . start practical work.”21 When Nishina graduated in the summer of 1918, he was among the handful of top students who were awarded silver watches by the Emperor. He also was elected to represent the College of Engineering graduates in the graduation ceremony, an honor that he was forced to decline because he was unable to attend the rehearsal.22 In the fall of 1918, Nishina entered Tokyo Imperial University’s Graduate School of Engineering. His refusal of Shibaura Engineering’s job offer had soured his relationship with Ho.23 He therefore turned for guidance to another young electrical engineering professor, Tsunetaro Kujirai, an insulating materials specialist who had just returned from study in Europe. At the same time, Nishina entered his new adviser’s laboratory in the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (Riken). Immediately after entering graduate school, Nishina’s interest turned from electrochemistry to physics. His notebook began to be filled with Einstein’s theory of relativity along with diagrams of triode vacuum tubes.24 He thought that “most problems in dynamo[s] and motor[s] were already solved,” but physics intriguingly “seemed full of unsolved puzzles.”25 A conversation with Hantaro Nagaoka in the fall of 1918 prompted Nishina to attend Nagaoka’s lectures and to try some physics experiments in Nagaoka’s laboratory. Captured by these experiences, Nishina immersed himself in physics under Nagaoka’s tutelage until the spring of 1921.26 In gaining Nagaoka as his patron and Riken as the site of his research, Nishina was doubly fortunate. Nagaoka, famous for his Saturnian-ring atomic model, was the most prominent Japanese physicist of the early twentieth century. Riken, Japan’s preeminent research institute during the interwar period, would send Nishina to Europe to study and later offer him his own laboratory, which Nishina would develop into a renowned center for theoretical, cosmic-ray, and nuclear research.\n\n1.3 INSTITUTE OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL RESEARCH (RIKEN) The establishment of Riken was the combined result of the growth of Japanese science and technology and Japan’s rapidly changing milieu during the mid-1910s. Ever since Japan had opened its doors to the rest of the world in 1853, Japanese scientists and engineers had imitated Western science and technology, but neither government nor industry had made a systematic effort to support scientific research. The desire for basic research emerged in academic circles at the beginning of the twentieth century but the time was not yet ripe. In 1913, Jokichi Takamine, an eminent applied chemist, argued persuasively that Japanese industry must be based on science, and proposed that Japan establish a “national science institute” funded by an initial investment of 20 million yen, a sum equal to the cost of one new battleship.27 Takamine’s pioneering proposal at first fell mostly on deaf ears in government and industry circles, but the outbreak of World War I in Europe in 1914 dramatically changed Japan’s attitude toward the importance of scientific research.\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 6 — #6\n\nYouth\n\n7\n\nThe economic blockade of Germany imposed by Britain and France hurt Japanese society immediately and badly, underscoring the dangers of being dependent on foreign technologies and research. Historian of science James R. Bartholomew outlined the war’s contribution to the creation of Riken: World War I posed a major challenge to Japanese science, as it did to science worldwide . . . . In Japan the war heightened interest in the physical sciences. Indeed, one chemist called it a “blessing from heaven.” Nonacademic research flourished there as never before. A significant shift of research activity into private firms and institutions took place. Both public and private sectors showed more inclination to spend money on science at home. Businessmen and officials who had earlier disdained research now became its promoters. Costly projects like the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, which could not have gained a foothold before 1914, now moved to the top of the country’s agenda. The blockade of Germany by Britain and France helped to produce these results. Before the summer of 1914, Japan had depended heavily on Germany for industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals and precision instruments. All of the Salvarsan 606 used to treat syphilis came from Germany, and most of the thirty-four million yen spent on imported pharmaceuticals also went to that country. Much of the information used in producing aniline dyes was obtained from German-held patents. About 150 Japanese traveled to Germany each year for medical studies. Two years of every three spent abroad by Japanese scientists were spent in Germany. And Germany was the site favored by most Japanese for exhibitions and academic conferences. The blockade created a crisis. Prices of German-made products soared — when one could obtain the products at all. In a matter of weeks, aniline dyes jumped to twenty times their previous price. Serious shortages developed. By late September Tokyo reportedly had a six months’ supply of most basic medicines, but Osaka had nearly run out.28\n\nTo meet these grave challenges, Joji Sakurai, an eminent physical chemist, and Eiichi Shibusawa, an influential financier, again brought up the need to create a national institute that would devote itself to basic research.29 Physicists soon joined chemists in promoting the idea of a central research institute, and together the two groups secured support from industry and from powerful national politicians, including the Prime Minister Shigenobu Okuma. A special government committee was appointed to draft an official proposal, which was submitted to the Diet in the spring of 1915. This document emphasized that major Western countries already had established national laboratories for basic science research: Great Britain had its National Physical Laboratory, the United States its National Bureau of Standards, and Germany its Physikalische Technische Reichsanstalt as well as Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft.30 The proposal’s final draft of 1916 clearly stated the rationale and goals of the proposed institute: Wishing to contribute to world civilization, to enhance the status of our nation, to lay the foundations of various industries and to increase the nation’s wealth, it is imperative that we encourage creative research in the disciplines of physics and chemistry. The recent war, moreover, has taught us the urgent necessity of independence and self-sufficiency in military supplies and industrial materials and has made us all acutely aware of the need for physical and chemical research. Because these kinds of research facilities have not\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 7 — #7\n\n8\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan previously existed in our country, certain public spirited people are hoping to establish the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research.31\n\nOnce the proposal was finalized, progress toward establishment of Riken rapidly accelerated. In March 1916, the Diet passed the final draft of the proposal, along with the proposed subsidies amounting to 2 million yen over a period of 10 years. Japanese industry pledged to donate over 2 million yen, which however was disappointingly far short of the original goal of 5 million yen. In March 1917, a formal application to establish Riken was submitted to the government and was approved in three days. Next, Riken’s first director, the eminent mathematician and educator, Dairoku Kikuchi, was appointed. In April 1917, the imperial family donated 1 million yen, adding great prestige and momentum to the effort to develop this so-called “private” institute.32 In September 1917, as construction began at Riken’s proposed site in Tokyo’s Komagome area, basic research projects commenced in several university laboratories. A detailed list of Riken’s projected activities, published in January 1917, underscored the wide scope of Riken’s objectives in comparison with those of Japan’s other science and engineering laboratories.33 These ambitious objectives included conducting pure scientific research and connecting it with applied research, carrying out research requested by government agencies, linking Japan’s research institutes and testing laboratories, training researchers, providing outside researchers with free use of Riken’s facilities, subsidizing research, encouraging inventions, publishing research results, and sponsoring public meetings. Carrying out these important missions obviously required a continuous flow of enormous funding, but, after the end of World War I in the fall of 1918, obtaining such funding proved difficult.34 In the competitive post-war Japanese market, Western products that were less expensive than Japanese goods and also of higher quality flooded again. Japanese companies resumed business with Western companies to acquire the advanced technology and goods that they needed. The wartime goal of self-sufficiency that had propelled the establishment of Riken was almost forgotten, and Japanese industry’s formerly enthusiastic support for this goal cooled. Riken’s operating budget was slashed to “between 120,000 and 130,000 yen . . . one-third the sum provided in the 1917 plan, and only about one-eighth the amount originally suggested by Takamine.”35 Moreover, rising material and labor costs tripled the estimated costs of constructing the Riken facilities. In the face of these financial difficulties, Riken’s researchers labored to continue their research and achieved some notable successes. In 1919, for example, Umetaro Suzuki began research on “compound sake,” a nontraditional type of sake made from materials other than rice. By 1921, research was being conducted for its production by the newly established Yamato Experimental Distillery. In 1922, Katsumi Takahashi isolated vitamin A from cod-liver oil, which Japanese subsequently called “Riken Vitamin.”36 On September 30, 1921, Masatoshi Okochi became Riken’s third director, succeeding Koi Furuichi (1917–1921).37 A member of the aristocracy, Okochi had assumed the title of baron in 1907. He had majored in armament engineering at Tokyo Imperial University, where in 1911 he was appointed professor. When Riken was established in 1917, he and Nagaoka shared responsibility for directing the physics section.\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 8 — #8\n\nYouth\n\n9\n\nFIGURE 1.2 The Building No. 3 of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (Riken) where Nishina would open his own laboratory in 1931. Riken was the most important research institute during the interwar period in Japan, largely owing to its third director, Masatosh Okochi (right). (Courtesy of the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research.)\n\nWith strong allies in the Diet and government, Okochi was the ideal choice to save the troubled infant institute. One of his first actions as Riken’s director was to abolish the institute’s antagonistic two-section structure consisting of a chemistry section and a physics section, which had been fighting each other for control of Riken since its inception. Okochi replaced this system with a structure of independent laboratories, each of which was directed by a head with full discretionary power. In the Japanese system in which the work of subordinates was strictly controlled, this institutional innovation greatly enhanced research freedom at Riken by enabling young laboratory heads to pursue their own research agendas without interference from their superiors (Figure 1.2). Okochi’s most important contribution to Riken’s development, however, was to secure stable funding for the institute’s research. His revolutionary solution to Riken’s financial problems was, in the words of Tessa Morris-Suzuki, “for the institute to commercialize its own inventions, thus earning revenue to support future research activities.” As Morris-Suzuki stated: In 1927 Okochi established the Physical and Chemistry Industrial Promotion Company (Rikagaku Kogyo, KK) with the research institute as major shareholder but with contributions from a number of other large investors, including the Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Sumimoto zaibatsu. The institute’s corporate arm acted as a holding company, providing what would now be called “venture capital” to a mass of industrial firms created to apply the fruits of the Riken research projects. Within twelve years Rikagaku Kogyo had become the center of a web of over sixty enterprises, extending throughout Manchuria and the Korean peninsula as well as the Japanese archipelago itself. What had begun as a scientific research institute had grown into an industrial conglomerate.38\n\nThese venture companies used Riken’s patents to manufacture alumite, positive paper, piston rings, and other products.

With its financial stability assured, Riken could pursue one of its primary missions: to conduct pure scientific research. Nishina would become the major beneficiary of Riken’s largesse, which would make possible his researches on quantum physics, cosmic rays, and nuclear physics. Notably, Nishina’s construction of the 26-inch cyclotron began in 1935, just as Riken’s financial situation took a turn for the better.\n\n1.4 JAPAN’S PHYSICS COMMUNITY IN THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY In comparison with chemistry, biology, and medicine in the first decades of the twentieth century, physics was a small, neglected field in Japan.39 Tokyo Imperial University’s Department of Physics, which since 1876 had trained and produced\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 10 — #10\n\nYouth\n\n11\n\nmost of Japan’s physicists, had only two full professors at the end of the nineteenth century. In the nine years between 1898 and 1907, the University produced only 78 physicists.40 In the five years between 1902 and 1907, Kyoto Imperial University produced a mere 16 physicists. Research had not yet become an activity expected of Japanese physicists, and during the period between 1898 and 1907 only seven Japanese physicists published more than 10 papers.41 In the early 1900s, Japan’s only serious physics researcher was Nagaoka, who surpassed other Japanese physicists both in the quality and quantity of his publications. The most famous of his publications, a series of papers on the structure of the atom that included his famous Saturnian-ring model, were published from 1903 to 1905.42 A serious problem was that theoretical physics had not yet been assigned a proper role in Japanese science. The situation in Europe and America may have been similar but Japanese one was more serious.43 Because most Japanese believed that physicists should investigate electricity and magnetism, heat, metallurgy, and other applied subjects to benefit Japan’s emerging industrial sector, physicists focused their attention mostly to these “useful” fields. A survey of physics papers between 1898 and 1907 proves this point clearly: 122 research studies in magnetism were published, 26 in light, 20 in electricity, 20 in heat, 15 in sound and vibration, and 14 in instrumentation.44 Seismology, gravity, and other geophysical subjects were popular research subjects for many Japanese physicists. Theoretical studies were significantly less frequent: atomic structure and radiation were investigated in only 10 published studies and mathematical physics in 8.45 Even Nagaoka and Aikitsu Tanakadate, the two most influential figures in the Department of Physics at Tokyo Imperial University, were busy working on experimental and applied subjects. The work of Kotaro Honda, “founder of the science of metals in Japan,” exemplified the dominance of experimental and applied physics over theoretical and basic physics.46 For most Japanese, Honda was the “symbol of what physicists would do for the welfare of the country.”47 Honda published several important papers on metallurgy in German and English journals and was awarded the prestigious Bessemer Medal for his research on magnetic properties of iron and steel in 1922. One of the major accomplishments of his long, distinguished career was the establishment of the Research Institute for Iron, Steel, and other Metals in 1919, which served both military and civilian shipbuilding. Another idiosyncrasy of the Japanese physics community that obstructed the growth of physics was that theoretical physicists distanced themselves from experimental physics. More often than not, Japanese physicists regarded theoretical physics as “applied mathematics” and treated it as such.48 In 1901 at Tokyo Imperial University, where most future physics faculty of Japan’s other imperial universities were trained, theoretical and experimental physics were officially separated.49 The flagship journal of physics in Japan, established under the name Proceedings of the Physico-Mathematical Society in Japan in 1901, also illustrates the intimate partnership between mathematics and theoretical physics. The close cooperation between experimental and theoretical physics that flourished in Cambridge, Berlin, Göttingen, and Munich at the turn of the century therefore did not exist in Japan. The feudal tradition in the Japanese university system, where\n\nDong: “IP801_C001” — 2007/4/14 — 00:34 — PAGE 11 — #11\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\n12\n\na professor monopolized a field and controlled the work of his subordinates precluded both collaboration and free exchange of ideas among physicists. Only Nishina was capable of breaking these barriers in his laboratory in Riken and thus ushering in a new era for Japanese physics.\n\nNOTES 1 For Nishina’s early life, see Tetsuo Tsuji, “The Life of Yoshio Nishina,” Butsuri, 45 (1990), 712–719 on 712–714; Kenji Ito, Making Sense of Ryoshiron (Quantum Theory): The Introduction of Quantum Mechanics into Japan, 1920–1940 (Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 2002), Chapters 4 and 6. 2 For the history of Meiji period, see Marius B.

Europe was boiling with [the] expectation of new ideas and new discoveries. This lucky event matched [Nishina’s] talent and ambition. Fate made him stay in Europe for seven years, which he himself probably did not originally plan. This transformed him into a first rate physicist, which would not have been really possible if he had remained in Japan. Ryogo Kubo1 Indeed, in the laboratory we miss your experience and helpfulness constantly, and besides we are in our theoretical discussions almost daily reminded of the beautiful work you made just before you left in collaboration with Klein . . . . The famous formula which was the result of this work is not only, as I need not say, the basis for the interpretation of the scattering measurements in which we — not least due to Jacobsen’s work — are intensely interested, but the striking confirmation which this formula has obtained became soon the main support for the essential correctness of Dirac’s theory when it was apparently confronted with so many grave difficulties. Niels Bohr to Yoshio Nishina2 It is just a fortnight ago since I left Copenhagen . . . . Owing to my inability I have not accomplished anything valuable in physics during this long stay. Yoshio Nishina to Niels Bohr3\n\n2.1 HEADING FOR EUROPE On April 5, 1921, Nishina boarded the Kitanomaru at Kobe and sailed to Europe. His voyage would last a month. Years later he told his younger son, Kojiro: “Many members of my family and relatives came to say good-bye. I could see your grandmother waving her hands until almost everyone left the dock. I can remember the scene vividly even now.” Nishina was his mother’s favorite, and she was so depressed by his departure that, upon her return home from the dock, she fell ill. She died 18 months later, on October 3, 1922, never seeing her beloved Yoshio again.4 Riken supported Nishina’s overseas study through a special program to send its best researchers to European or American laboratories for advanced training. An article in Nature (1918) said: “A few of these associate fellows [junior researchers] are annually sent abroad for further training, there being three (Asahara, Nishikawa, and Takamine) in the United States at present.”5 The usual duration of study abroad was two years, during which the junior researchers were paid a special “overseas study” salary. If a researcher remained abroad longer than two years, this special salary was replaced by a basic salary. In either case, the amount was insufficient, and Riken generally expected researchers’ families to contribute supplemental support 15\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 15 — #1\n\n16\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\nfor their upkeep. For the first three years of Nishina’s study abroad, he received additional support from the family of his third sister’s (Toku’s) husband.6 During his study abroad, Nishina intended to continue research on x-ray spectroscopy and related subjects begun at Riken with Nagaoka. Nagaoka had shifted his research concentration to spectroscopy and radioactivity around the end of World War I, and had jointly published several papers with Yoshikatsu Sugiura on the spectra of mercury, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, bismuth, and radioactive isotopes.7 In 1919, Nagaoka reported on the progress of this research in a letter to Ernest Rutherford, who in that year was named director of the Cavendish Laboratory of Cambridge University: As to the radioactive work in Japan, there was as yet none worth mentioning. The government has purchased for the use [of ] my laboratory radium salt containing 100 mgrm of the metal, so that there is now [the] prospect of starting radioactive experiments. We are now going to investigate the spectrum of the emanation, examine the structure of the lines, and see if they are arranged in series. We are encountering great difficulty in the purification of the emanation.8\n\nNagaoka wished to accelerate this research by sending his best pupils, including Taiji Kikuchi, Nishina, and Sugiura, to Europe. His natural choice of destination for these young researchers was the world’s foremost center for experimental physics, the Cavendish Laboratory. Taiji Kikuchi, Nagaoka’s most promising protégé and a son of the Baron Dairoku Kikuchi, was the first whom Nagaoka chose to send to the Cavendish. Unfortunately, Kikuchi died prematurely in Cambridge in March of 1921, probably because of radioactive sickness. Under Nagaoka’s influence, Riken chose Nishina to replace Kikuchi. In May of 1921, Nishina finally arrived in Europe. After spending a few months on intensive English training, he matriculated as a member of Emmanuel College, and then, in October, entered the Cavendish Laboratory.\n\n2.2 CAMBRIDGE AND GÖTTINGEN By 1921, the Cavendish Laboratory had already produced six Nobel Prize winners in physics and chemistry. These were the Cavendish’s second director, Lord Rayleigh (physics, 1904); its third director, Joseph John Thomson (physics, 1906); its fourth director, Ernest Rutherford (chemistry, 1908); the father–son team of William Henry and William Lawrence Braggs (physics, 1915); and Charles Glover Barkla (physics, 1918). Rutherford was a truly outstanding experimental physicist at the peak of a long, distinguished career. In 1898, while a research student working under Thomson, Rutherford was the first to distinguish α- and β-rays. Later, at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, he worked on the radioactivity of elements, which brought him the 1908 Nobel Prize in chemistry. Shortly before being awarded that honor, in 1907, he returned to England to accept a chair at the University of Manchester, where, in 1911, he ushered in the nuclear age with his discovery of the atom’s nucleus. During World War I, he and Henry Bragg became the most\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 16 — #2\n\nNishina in Europe\n\n17\n\nimportant figures in Britain’s war-related research. At the war’s end, Rutherford immediately launched a new line of investigation into the artificial disintegration of the nucleus. Rutherford was also an exceptional teacher who attracted many brilliant young physicists. While he was in Montreal, he trained Otto Hahn; in Manchester, his pupils included, among many others, Hans Geiger, Henry Mosley, Ernest Marsden, Owen Chadwick, Charles G. Darwin, George de Hevesy, and Niels Bohr. Japanese scientists were not unknown at the Cavendish. Three Japanese scientists, T. Noda, T. Kikuchi, and Takeo Shimizu, had already studied there. Shimizu had gained the recognition of the Laboratory’s researchers for increasing the cloud chamber’s efficiency by mechanically moving the piston with a reciprocating motion and then adding a special camera to “take a great number of photographs of α-ray tracks.”9 Rutherford had also previously accepted a few Japanese physicists into his laboratory at the University of Manchester. There, S. Kinoshita had published a paper on radioactivity in Proceedings of the Royal Society and, upon his return to Japan, published two more papers on that subject in Philosophical Magazine.10 However, none of these Japanese physicists had attained prominence or imported the distinctive, highly influential “Cavendish style” of physics research to the Japanese physics community. Now Nishina’s work also was disappointingly less productive than expected. Although he kept abreast of recent research in physics and other branches of science by attending meetings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,11 he failed to participate in any important projects and did not produce a single paper during his entire stay at the Cavendish (Figure 2.1). From October 1, 1921, when he entered the Laboratory, to August 15, 1922, Nishina “worked on the Geiger counter and on the distribution of electrons by x-ray scattering using the Geiger counter.”12 According to a letter\n\nFIGURE 2.1 Nishina is the first from the left in the second row in this 1922 annual Cavendish photograph. (Courtesy of the Cavendish Laboratory University of Cambridge.)\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 17 — #3\n\n18\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\nhe wrote to Bohr in late March of 1923, he had been “counting β-rays excited by γ -rays by means of Geiger’s counter” at the Cavendish.13 In the traditional Cavendish atmosphere of resolute individuality and independence, Nishina’s inexperience no doubt contributed to his lack of productivity. Newcomers were on their own when it came to finding help; the Laboratory’s senior staff took no extra pains to assist foreigners or beginners. Certainly, to Japanese physicists like Nishina, the Cavendish Laboratory seemed an interesting — but very strange — place where, as Bohr had indicated a decade earlier, “the state of molecular chaos” prevailed.14 Although Nishina hoped to expand on Nagaoka’s research, he had not been adequately trained to meet this ambitious goal, and he did not receive such training after his arrival at the Cavendish. X-ray spectroscopy was a field to which Cavendish researchers contributed little, as Karl Manne Georg Siegbahn’s 1925 book, The Spectroscopy of X-Rays, pointed out.15 Besides the Swede, Karl Siegbahn, the researchers most enthusiastically interested in x-ray spectroscopy were the British father–son team of Henry and Lawrence Bragg; the French Maurice de and Louis de Broglie; the Dutch physicist, Dirk Coster; and the American, Arthur Holly Compton, all of whom were working elsewhere. In the early 1920s, only three Cavendish researchers, A. Müller, P. W. Burbidge, and G. Shearer, published any papers related to x-ray spectroscopy.16 Rutherford’s main concern since 1918 had been investigating the structure of the nucleus by researching the disintegration of light nuclei by bombardment with α-particles. Moreover, although Nishina’s study plan required utilizing Geiger counters, this instrument was not of major interest to Cavendish researchers in those years.17 Nevertheless, Nishina’s one-year long stay at the Cavendish Laboratory was not altogether a waste of time. Although experimentation on x-ray spectroscopy had not yet taken root at the Cavendish, valuable knowledge about x-rays and techniques for scattering had been accumulating there for 20 years.18 Even Arthur H. Compton, who in 1919 had been elected as a fellow of the National Research Council, chose to spend that academic year using the Cavendish resources to experiment with the scattering and absorption of γ -rays.19 Nishina was not as well prepared to use the Cavendish’s resources as Compton had been, of course, but he did manage to pick up some knowledge about x-ray spectroscopy and techniques for scattering experiments.20 Also, in the spring of 1922, Nishina first encountered Bohr, an event that soon would lead him to life-altering opportunities. In late summer of 1922, Nishina left Cambridge and headed for the University of Göttingen in Germany, this time planning to systematically study theoretical physics. Again, he was disappointed. Although he dutifully attended seminars headed by Max Born and David Hilbert, the university’s physics program was not yet fully developed.21 Born’s celebrated three-year course on theoretical physics, which was closely related to the experimental training in James Franck’s laboratory, and which consisted of “six series of lectures corresponding to the six semesters” had just begun to form.22 Moreover, as Nishina later remembered, postwar Germany “was very poor indeed,” and Nishina, dependent as he was on a fixed income transferred from the Japanese government, found it “very difficult to live.”23 In Germany’s chaotic economic situation, inflation was so high that 50,000 marks would buy only a few\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 18 — #4\n\nNishina in Europe\n\n19\n\npostage stamps; a handful of stamps amounted to the equivalent of what only a few years before had been the value of a house, and Born was dismayed to actually receive a few postage stamps from a debtor as a mortgage payment.24 In November of 1922, as his two years of study abroad were drawing to a close, Nishina received word of his mother’s death. This news left him with no reason to return immediately to Japan. Nishina had yet to experience any real success in his research, and physics no longer seemed a tenable career. He was rethinking his plans for the future. Nishina’s younger son, Kojiro, provided some insight into Nishina’s state of mind at this time: What [plans] did he have in mind [for] when he returned to Japan? According to his diary, around the end of his stay in England, he visited an exhibition of physiological instruments and also some instrument workshops in London. This record is in detail and very serious. Perhaps he might have considered producing that kind of instrument after returning to Japan. Interestingly, at the same period, he began to pay attention to science toys. He subscribed to Games and Toys and visited the British Association of Toys [sic]. He even considered making wireless control [led] toys and commented that German toys were much better than the English . . . . Many family members and relatives still believe that during those two years in England and Germany, Father decided that, “Physics is not so interesting to spend my whole life.” They argued that he made up his mind “to give up physics and to return to Japan in order to develop and produce science toys. A reason why German science is top in the world is that there is an excellent German science toy industry.” Although this argument is not always consistent with his memos or diary, it was anyway a settled opinion among the family . . . . Two wooden boxes of science toys arrived at the family, soon after the letter to his elder brother was delivered.25\n\nDespite his doubts about the feasibility of physics research as his future career, on March 25, 1923, before returning to Japan, Nishina sent the following letter to Bohr at the University of Copenhagen: To Professor N. Bohr Theoretical Physics Dept. University of Copenhagen Denmark Dear Sir You may remember that I was working in the Cavendish Laboratory when you came to Cambridge about a year ago. At that time I was counting β-rays excited by γ -rays by means of Geiger’s counter, and had the honour of speaking to you in the laboratory. I left Cambridge last September and came here for the purpose of learning the German language. As I spoke to you in Cambridge, I have the great desire of studying in Copenhagen under your guidance, and I should be greatly obliged to you if you could accept me. As my Institute in Tokio does not allow me to stay in Europe longer than two more terms, I do not know whether it is wise to set up new work. My chief wish is to study\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 19 — #5\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\n20\n\nyour theory of spectra and atomic constitution in details. But if any one wants assistance in the experiment or the calculation, I should do it with pleasure. I should esteem it a favour if you would give me the early information in the matter. I beg to remain Yours faithfully Y. Nishina P.S. I belong to the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research in Tokio,26 to which Dr. Takamine also does as you know.27\n\nBohr responded by inviting Nishina to study at Copenhagen, to Nishina’s surprise and delight. “It is my great pleasure to be able to study in your institute,” Nishina wrote back, “and I should like to express my sincere gratitude to you for your kind acceptance of me.”28 On April 10, 1923, Nishina arrived in Copenhagen, where, he wrote to his sister in Japan, he planned “to stay for few months.”29 However, his stay would last for more than 5 years and would prove to be the most fruitful time of his life.\n\n2.3 RESEARCH IN EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS AT COPENHAGEN In 1923, the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen had been in existence for only two years (Figure 2.2). With Bohr, the 1922 Nobel Laureate in physics, as its head, and with generous funding by the Danish government, the Carlsberg Foundation, the U.S.A. International Education Board, the Rask-Ørsted\n\nFIGURE 2.2 The Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen and its director, Niels Bohr.

Proponents of the new quantum mechanics flocked to Copenhagen to exchange ideas, bringing into existence two new terms: the “Copenhagen spirit” and the “Copenhagen interpretation.” From its inception, Bohr’s Institute of Theoretical Physics paid almost as much attention to experimentation as it did to theory. In his 1921 inaugural speech, Bohr made it clear that theoretical research on the atom depended on several experimental studies, namely, spectroscopy, ionization by collisions, and radioactivity: Among the kinds of scientific work for which the Institute is arranged, spectroscopic research will occupy first place. This is closely connected with the circumstance that by the investigation of the light that matter can be brought to emit we have a means of the greatest value for obtaining information about the composition of matter and of the structure of the atoms of the various elements. Such investigations are made with instruments called spectroscophs [sic], and you will have occasion to see several types of these set up in the laboratory rooms.31\n\nBohr’s Institute was what Nishina had been searching for, a laboratory where x-ray spectroscopy was of major interest. The importance of spectroscopy in Bohr’s Institute during the early 1920s has been nicely summarized by Finn Aaserud: By the mid-1920s, Bohr had largely achieved his goal of unifying theory and experiment. During this period, many experimental physicists joined the theoreticians at the institute to make use of the growing collection of apparatus. Among the foreign visitors, James Franck from Germany and Dirk Coster from Holland made particularly significant contributions to spectroscopical work during the first few years. Bohr’s Danish colleagues Hans Marius Hansen, who moved into biophysics after the mid-1920s, and Sven Werner also did important experiments in spectroscopy. Jacobsen, who remained an experimentalist at the institute throughout his career, contributed experimentally both in spectroscopy and in radioactivity, the work in radioactivity untypically having little impact on the theoretical work at the institute. Although the discovery of the chemical element hafnium in 1922, which dramatically corroborated Bohr’s atomic theory just in time for him to present this finding in his Nobel Prize lecture, is probably the most publicized case of the close interrelationship between theory and experiment at the institute, experimental activity complementing theoretical work went far beyond a single incident.32\n\nUnder the close supervision of Bohr and other specialists in spectroscopy, Nishina finally could start systematic research on x-ray spectroscopy. Bohr’s mentorship was crucial to Nishina’s development. Bohr quickly recognized Nishina’s talent in experimentation and encouraged him to work harder. When Riken terminated Nishina’s financial support in the summer of 1923, Bohr secured fellowships for him from 1924 to 1927 from the Rask-Ørsted Foundation. The foundation was established in 1919 “for the support of Danish science in connection with international research.”33 During the 1920s, it provided an average of three fellowships annually for young\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 21 — #7\n\n22\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\nforeign scientists, such as Nishina and Wolfgang Pauli, for example, to study at Bohr’s Institute. Nishina worked very hard in Copenhagen. He returned to his lodgings late at night, often climbing over the institute’s fence. In October 1923, Bohr’s assistant, Hendrik A. Kramers, recorded that “Nishina has left on a little vacation trip to Norway and Sweden together with two other Japanese. We think he has deserved it, and he sends all of us beautiful postcards.”34 Now Bohr thought Nishina might be working too hard. “How could Nishina work so late every day?” Bohr wondered. “Is it because he is working on an experiment? If he is working on theoretical problems, he must not do so.”35 According to Nishina’s son, Kojiro: [Nishina] wrote in 1925 that “I would like to stay here as long as possible and to study the fundamental principles of physics.” His high school classmates worried [about] his strangely long stay in Europe, saying that “Is there anything wrong in Nishina? Does he have a girl friend there? Somebody must go and check whether he is O.K.” For him, the years when he stayed in Europe were the most fruitful as researcher. He once told me that “When I was young and absorbed in studying physics, I once considered not to marry but to concentrate my whole life on research.” The period when he stayed in Denmark was certainly those happy years.36\n\nWhile researching x-ray spectroscopy, Nishina enjoyed the good fortune of securing help from two of the period’s most distinguished experts on the subject, George de Hevesy and Dirk Coster, both of whom had joined the Institute at Bohr’s invitation (Figure 2.3). The Hungarian-born Hevesy had worked on radioactivity and x-ray spectroscopy in various major European institutes, including Rutherford’s laboratory in Manchester from 1911 to 1914. He was a good friend of Bohr’s ever since Bohr arrived at Rutherford’s Manchester laboratory in 1912.37 The Danish physicist Coster had studied physics under Paul Ehrenfest at Leiden University and x-ray spectroscopy in Karl Siegbahn’s laboratory at Lund from 1920 to 1922.38 At Bohr’s request, Coster examined whether Bohr’s new atomic theory matched the x-ray spectroscopy data. In 1922, Hevesy and Coster carried out an experiment to discover the unknown element with the atomic number of 72.39 According to Bohr’s theory, the missing element should not be one of the rare earth materials, but rather a homologue of zirconium [Zi(40)]. Bohr’s theoretical prediction was confirmed when Hevesy and Coster discovered the target element in zirconium minerals. They named the new element hafnium to commemorate Copenhagen. Although the great moment of discovery occurred before the spring of 1923 when Nishina arrived at Bohr’s Institute, Coster greatly influenced Nishina’s work on x-ray spectroscopy, and Hevesy became a close friend and generous mentor whom Nishina often consulted not only while he resided in Copenhagen, but also after his return to Japan as well. Nishina performed his first research at Bohr’s Institute with Coster and S. Werner. The three researchers examined the measurement of the absorption-spectra in the L-series of elements from La (57) to Hf (72).40 These examinations were intended to support Bohr and Coster’s 1923 argument that the completion of inner groups of electrons in the atoms was in the neighborhood of the iron, palladium, and platinum groups as well as in the rare earth elements. The researchers carefully measured\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 22 — #8\n\nNishina in Europe\n\n23\n\nFIGURE 2.3 George de Hevesy (left) and Dirk Coster (right).

As Coster, Nishina, and Werner reported in the Philosophical Magazine, their results “agreed well with the interpolated values . . . used by Bohr and Coster in their paper.”41 Interestingly, the trio submitted this paper on August 13, 1923, just four months after Nishina’s arrival at the Institute. Nishina was learning about x-ray spectroscopy very quickly. Nishina expanded this joint work in his next paper, an individual effort, “On the L-absorption Spectra of Elements from Sn (50) to W (74) and Their Relation to the Atomic Constitution.”42 Although this work aimed to support Bohr’s idea of atomic structure, Nishina carefully aimed for “more accurate values of the energy levels” in order to free the interpretation of his results from “the uncertainty involved in the interpolation and arising from the lack of uniformity of the measurements of different authors.”43 Nishina achieved his goals: “A plotting of the square roots of the level values as a function of the atomic number confirm[ed] in a striking way the general conclusions of Bohr and Coster” (Figure 2.4).44 Moreover, Nishina’s experimental results were so accurate that Siegbahn adopted Nishina’s findings when he published the English translation of The Spectroscopy of X-Rays in 1925.45 However, Nishina made no attempt to amend Bohr’s model, nor did he add any new ideas of his own to the ongoing discussion of x-ray spectroscopy: “The present measurements allow us to examine these anomalies with great accuracy, and to obtain a general support of the conclusions of Bohr and Coster.”46\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 23 — #9\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\n24 (a) 15\n\nMI 3(1,1)\n\n14\n\nMII 3(2,1)\n\n13\n\nMIII 3(2,2)\n\nHoLIII\n\nMIV 3(3,2) MV 3(3,3)\n\n12 Square-root of energy levels (√T/R)\n\n(b)\n\n11 10 →\n\n9\n\nHoLIII WL\n\nSmLIII\n\n8 7\n\nNI 4(1,1) NII 4(2,1) NIII 4(2,2)\n\n6 5\n\nNIV 4(3,2) NV 4(3,3)\n\n4 3\n\nOI 5(1,1) OII,III 5(2,1) NVI 4(4,3) NVII 4(4,4)\n\n2 1 50\n\n52\n\n56\n\n54 61\n\n58 53\n\n60\n\n62\n\n64\n\n66\n\n68\n\n70\n\n72\n\n→\n\nFeK\n\nSmLIII\n\nFeK1\n\n74\n\n44 Atomic number Z\n\nFIGURE 2.4 A diagram ([a] from p. 534) and photographs ([b] from p. 633) from Y. Nishina, “On the L-Absorption Spectra of the Elements from Sn (50) to W (74) and Their Relation to the Atomic Constitution,” Philosophical Magazine, 49 (1925), 521–537, 633.\n\nIn 1925, Coster and Nishina published a joint paper on the quantitative chemical analysis by means of x-ray spectra.47 In Coster’s original method, which he presented in 1923 in Chemical News, the element of interest was mixed with an element with an atomic number close to it, and the x-ray spectrum of the mixture was found.48 In theory, comparing the intensities of the corresponding lines of the two neighboring elements was expected to yield knowledge about the element of interest. In practice, however, the intensities of the two lines were not compared. Instead, the quantity of the element added for comparison was carefully monitored until the two lines became equally intense. The quantity of the added element showed the proportion of the element of interest in the original preparation. Because this so-called “balanced method” was the simplest for separating hafnium from zirconium and other chemicals, it was widely used for the determination of hafnium content in different chemical preparations and minerals. However, Nishina soon discovered that Coster’s balanced method was neither accurate nor easily manageable. In a series of letters to Hevesy in the autumn of 1924, Nishina mentioned his dissatisfaction with Coster’s method and hinted that he was working toward a better one.49 Nishina was reticent to publish his concerns about the method in view of his consideration for\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 24 — #10\n\nNishina in Europe\n\n25\n\nCoster’s feelings, his respect for their teacher–student relationship, and his Japanese modesty. He revealed some of his thoughts on the matter to Hevesy in a letter dated October 24, 1924: As regards the publication on chemical analysis with X-Ray, I am not in position to do it now. It would be criticism of Dr. Coster’s work. Therefore unless he publishes something I shall not publish anything. And even after he will have published about the applicability of the method, I do not know whether I publish the material I have got, in my name or not. You know my knowledge on X-Ray spectrograph was given by Dr. Coster. But the result we [Nishina and Thal Jantzen] have got must be published as soon as possible, otherwise someone may find the same thing and criticize Dr. Coster. The question is how to publish it. Perhaps you and Dr. Coster will communicate about the matter and decide what to do. Meantime I can speak Prof. Bohr about the matter.50\n\nBohr and Hevesy together worked out a compromise: Nishina would write the paper with some help from Coster, but Coster would be the first author.51 In the improved method, spectral lines were not measured and directly compared; instead, the already known relative intensities of the elements were used to determine the amount of the element in question within the mixture. Stated differently, Coster and Nishina empirically determined whether the relative intensity of the spectral lines was constant for a definite chemical composition of the preparation used. For example, to determine the amount of hafnium in a mixture of HfO2 + ZrO2 , they simply added Ta2 O5 until the intensity of the Lα1 lines of both hafnium and tantalum became equal. Because the relative concentration of Ta2 O5 :HfO2 (which showed equal relative intensities of spectral lines) was known to be 2.5:1, the concentration of hafnium in the preparation was determined to be 1/2.5 that of Ta2 O5 . Hevesy and Thal Jantzen at Bohr’s Institute demonstrated the reliability of Coster and Nishina’s modified method when they used it to determine the hafnium contents in minerals and chemical preparations. The modified method produced very good results that were “in good agreement with those found both by chemical analysis and density measurement.”52 Nishina had become a specialist in x-ray spectroscopy. Nishina and B. B. Ray further developed the method in the next paper.53 They emphasized the importance of measuring the relative intensities of x-ray lines to the study of the atom’s constitution, and then pointed out some difficulties in making these measurements using the ionization chamber and photographic plate. Nishina and Ray were troubled by “the lack of precise knowledge of the relative sensitiveness of these methods for different wavelengths.” To overcome the difficulties, and also to obtain more sensitive curves of the L- and M-series of elements, they covered each of the four faces of the anticathode with sheets of iron, cobalt, nickel, and copper and then turned it so that each of the four faces was exposed to the x-rays. Having made these improvements, they got fair results, which, however, significantly differed from those acquired using optical spectra experimentation. Nishina and Ray closely analyzed the cause of this difference.\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 25 — #11\n\n26\n\nYoshio Nishina: Father of Modern Physics in Japan\n\nFIGURE 2.5 Nishina made many good friends at Bohr’s Institute in Copenhagen. He also enjoyed Danish lifestyle, including sawing the lumber. (Courtesy of Niels Bohr Archive.)\n\nThe next year, in 1926, Nishina became interested in measuring absorption spectra, for which he enlisted the advice of J. Holtsmark of Trondhjem: Recently, I have been very much interested in the measurement of absolute strength of spectral absorption lines and am thinking of applying it to X-Ray region, if possible. As I have not much experience in this matter, I should like to ask you something about Füchtbauer’s method. I should be very much obliged to you indeed, if you would let me know the following points.54\n\nNishina also secured help from two Japanese colleagues at Bohr’s Institute, Shin’ichi Aoyama and Kojiro Kimura. The three physicists measured the K-absorption spectra of calcium, chlorine, and sulphur in different chemical compounds and found that the absorption frequencies changed according to lattice structure and the mode of chemical binding of the different chemical compounds.55 In this work, Aoyama and Kimura chiefly carried out “the actual experimental part of the work,” while Nishina had taken charge of theoretical interpretation and writing the paper.56 This would be the last paper Nishina would write concerning an experimental subject during his stay in Europe. From his arrival at Bohr’s Institute in the spring of 1923 until the completion of his joint experiment with Aoyama and Kimura in mid1927 (Figure 2.6), Nishina had successfully completed several delicate experiments and had matured into a competent experimentalist. Bohr had trusted Nishina’s skill and asked Nishina to examine his prediction that an element with an atomic number of 93, 94, or 96 would be chemically similar to uranium (92).57 A silent film produced in 1925 to advertise the Bohr’s Institute included at least two stills that showed Nishina doing experiments (Figure 2.7 below).58\n\n2.4 THE NEW QUANTUM MECHANICS AND THE KLEIN–NISHINA FORMULA In 1927, Nishina told his Japanese colleagues that, after they completed their experiment on the K-absorption spectra of calcium, chlorine, and sulphur in chemical\n\nDong: “IP801_C002” — 2007/4/18 — 21:33 — PAGE 26 — #12\n\nNishina in Europe\n\n27\n\nFIGURE 2.6 Nishina and other Japanese scientists at Bohr’s Copenhagen Institute in 1927. Standing, Y. Nishina (left) and T. Hori (right); sitting, S. Aoyama (left) and K. Kimura (right). (Courtesy of Niels Bohr Archive.)\n\ncompounds, he intended to “stop experimental research for a while and move to theoretical study.”59 The theoretical work Nishina settled on in 1927 was related to the new quantum mechanics that Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac, Oskar Klein, and other young theoretical physicists had been developing since 1925. This was not surprising because Bohr and his Copenhagen Institute had been at the center of this intellectual revolution and, by 1927, Bohr’s famous “complementarity” had been born in the unique milieu of the Institute.60 Bohr had been inviting the principal physicists involved in the development of new quantum mechanics to come together at his institute for work and discussion, and, ultimately, almost every young contributor to the development of new quantum mechanics worked at or visited Bohr’s Institute at some point between 1925 and 1935. Kramers, Heisenberg, and Klein served as assistants there; Schrödinger, Pauli, Dirac, Lev Landau, George Gamov, Felix Bloch, John Slater, Friedrich von Weizsäcker, and others working on quantum mechanics visited there for long talks with Bohr or to deliver colloquia. Although Nishina had taken notes on some lectures given by Schrödinger, Friedrich Hund, Dirac, and Heisenberg at Bohr’s Institute during 1926–1927,61 it seems that he had not paid much attention to the new quantum mechanics before his decision to move his work in that direction "
