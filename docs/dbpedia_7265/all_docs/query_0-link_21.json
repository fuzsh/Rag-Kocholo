        "text": "Ashrafi:\n\nI read the things that Laurie Brown has written about you, and I’m particularly interested in starting with the Japanese education and how it is different from here. So for example, you come from a well-educated family, and you had one uncle who is an engineer.\n\nNambu:\n\nNot necessarily. Do I have one uncle who is an engineer? I have one uncle who was a medical doctor.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThere is a mention of someone who did work in radio, and you started playing with radio sets as a youth.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, but I wouldn’t say he was an engineer. He died at a young age in his 20s, so I saw him only a few times. I don't know, my memory is very vague. I don’t think he ever went to a school. He was sort of dabbling in kind of amateur radio.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYour father was in the humanities rather than in the sciences or engineering.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAt what point did your interest become science and mathematics?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes, that’s a good question. Actually, my father ran away from home and went to Tokyo and got married there, and that’s where I was born. We had to go back to his hometown because of the great earthquake of 1923 when I was two years old. And that is where I grew up, in his hometown. And my father, of course as you said, studied English literature and wanted to be a writer. He never made it to be a writer, but he ended up as a high school teacher.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you grew up in a family with lots of awareness of Western culture.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, that’s right, that’s correct. I think in my childhood he gave me science books to read and magazines for kids, which I loved to do.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo he encouraged science?\n\nNambu:\n\nI think so, yes. Because he believed that being a writer he had to know everything—all human activities, including science. But he never had any education in science.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd your early education included several languages?\n\nNambu:\n\nBy self-study only when I was of high school age. Of course English was taught in high school.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nStandard for all the students?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. But no conversations or anything like that, just reading.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd what kind of science or mathematics courses did you have early on, before college?\n\nNambu:\n\nNot really, just regular science courses.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nLaurie Brown mentioned something about you not being as happy with physics as with mathematics early on?\n\nNambu:\n\nI do not agree with that statement. When I was in my childhood, before school age actually, I read those science books and magazines, mostly about animals and plants and stuff like that. My childhood hero at that time was Thomas Edison. So that’s the kind of thing that I acquired early on. But then in grade school—in those days grade school went only to sixth grade, and after that was high school, which was not compulsory. So compulsory education ended at sixth grade.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWere these magazines that you read published in Japan?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, the regular mainstream magazines.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd these were in Japanese.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes of course, science for the kids or something like that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd why Edison? Do you remember? What is it that attracted you to Edison?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, he was an inventor, and that was what attracted me, inventing things.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd then when you went to high school??\n\nNambu:\n\nWhen I went to high school I did regular courses, chemistry, physics, natural history, what else? Not very much.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd so you knew early on that you were going to pursue science?\n\nNambu:\n\nNot really, no.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo in high school you were still studying many things, and not yet sure.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, that’s right, nothing really in particular. Of course I was more oriented towards science, yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you did well?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. And you mentioned this engineering uncle. I found some radio equipment rummaging through the uncle’s possessions, and that was when I was in grade school. So I built a crystal radio.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBefore sixth grade?\n\nNambu:\n\nThat’s right. Oh, actually I recently wrote a brief article for the Trieste Institute—they are going to publish articles by various people about their childhoods, so I have a little one here. It is not published yet, so I don’t know whether I should show it to you, but maybe if you just keep it confidential I can make a copy of that for you.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSure, yes. Thank you. So then you went to Tokyo. Why Tokyo?\n\nNambu:\n\nWhy Tokyo. Was a challenge! In those days the educational system was quite different from what it is now. Nowadays it is patterned after the American system. In those days it was more like the German system.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nHow do you mean? With gymnasium?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, well it’s not exactly gymnasium, but there was a higher school which is equivalent to the college nowadays, which is separate from universities. So we called it higher school, not high school. It’s higher than high school. There were several, maybe a dozen or so, national higher schools in those days. And number one was in Tokyo. And it was the most difficult, challenging schools to get in. So maybe it was also encouraged by my father. It was a challenge to try it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYour father encouraged you to try Tokyo?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo there was a national exam?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, no, it was not national exams. Just each school had its own exams. And fortunately I was able to get in.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI see. And did Tokyo at the time specialize in scientific or engineering?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not at all. No, nothing of that kind. So actually I got kind of early admission. A year ahead of schedule, I was able to get in, just barely, at the bottom of the rank.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThis is in ’40? No.\n\nNambu:\n\n’37, around there.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYou went to the Army in ’42.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. So that was after our graduation from the university, not higher school.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nFirst there was grade school, then high school, then higher school in Tokyo?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh, I see. And then Tokyo University. I see. So you took the exam. Now the exam you just described, that was the exam for higher school, or for university?\n\nNambu:\n\nFrom high school to higher school.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo there you’ve had general courses, including science and mathematics.\n\nNambu:\n\nMathematics and humanities. Everything.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDo you remember what kind of science courses you had?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell not much, really just routine: physics, chemistry, and mathematics of course.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nFor example, did you get calculus in higher school?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes of course.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOkay, so before University you had calculus?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, that’s right.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd your family was living in Tokyo at the time?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, they always stayed in my hometown.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI see. How long was the higher school?\n\nNambu:\n\nThree years.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThree years, and then you went to Tokyo University. Now how was that process of going to Tokyo University?\n\nNambu:\n\nWe just take another examination. Going to another different school.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd why Tokyo University?\n\nNambu:\n\nIt was the most prestigious one of them. My memory is rather vague, but the three years of higher school was a very interesting life for me because it’s living in the dormitories. The students were separated into science oriented and humanities oriented.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh they were. This is at higher school?\n\nNambu:\n\nHigher school.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOkay. So when you went in you hadn’t decided yet?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell I applied for the science side. But living in the dormitories, of course all students mix together. The dormitory is not the kind that we know here. There they put maybe eight or so students in the same big room, and the bedroom is the same way with eight beds. So they are all mixed. In the first year, actually, the science and humanities students are all mixed together. So I had a very interesting time interacting with kids from all parts of the country.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIn what way?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, you see, what we discussed was not science or anything like that; just what is life, for example. And popular novels, literature, and things like that. That’s what we talked about for most of the time.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd so this would be in the years leading to??\n\nNambu:\n\nLet me see, what was the year? Do you have my vita there?\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYes I do. I have that you graduated from Tokyo University in ’42. So you must have f finished the higher school in ’39?\n\nNambu:\n\nActually ’40. The school year started in April. Because the War started when I was at the University, which was 1941, and I was in the second year and supposed to finish in the Spring of 1943, but because of the War that was cut short. I was in the University for two and a half years.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd the University is all male at this time?\n\nNambu:\n\nAll male, yes. Even high school was all male. So from high school on.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo girls only got to the age of sixth grade?\n\nNambu:\n\nGirls went to a girls’ high school, and there were a few universities for women, but very few of them. I went into the University in 1940. I entered a higher school in 1937.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd was there much military training required in the University?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, from high school on.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYou went to University, you went to the science side of the University. There was some compulsory military.\n\nNambu:\n\nNothing when I was in the University. There was no such thing.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh, I see, higher school required military. So you didn’t have compulsory military training at University?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you went in with some physics and chemistry and calculus already. Do you remember what you studied in the two years you were at the University?\n\nNambu:\n\nUniversity?\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYes.\n\nNambu:\n\nAfter calculus and things like that, just regular physics courses. Oh, I don’t remember. Just everything I think people take in that age. Physics and classical mechanics. You had physics courses in higher school already, which included classical mechanics and thermodynamics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIn higher school?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. I really remember because I flunked it! [chuckles]\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI guess Laurie Brown mentioned you didn’t like entropy.\n\nNambu:\n\nWell I didn’t understand it. And then some experimental physics there. And then I went into the University’s courses: classical physics, including hydrodynamics and experimental physics, doing experiments; but also a course on experimental physics, the Theory of Experimental Physics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThe Theory of Experimental Physics. Which means what?\n\nNambu:\n\nData analysis.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI see. Did you have relativity?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nNo relativity.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not at all. We had quantum mechanics at the University. And then nuclear physics, both theory and experiment. But no particle physics yet.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you had quantum mechanics but not relativity, not even special relativity?\n\nNambu:\n\nSpecial relativity, I think we had some of it, but not the gravitational side of it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDo you remember what kinds of materials you used? Were these textbooks in Japanese?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, and also just the teachers themselves made up the lecture notes. And there also were books available in those days, especially for students, including series of paperbacks on individual topics in physics. So those were not required things but we could read those if we wanted to. We could also buy those.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDo you remember who the teachers were on quantum mechanics?\n\nNambu:\n\nProfessor Masao Kotani, he’s a well known person in solid state physics, and I think he did the course on quantum mechanics, and somebody else too. The University of Tokyo was good in condensed matter physics, not in the particle side of it. That was the exclusive domain of the Kyoto School and Riken. Nishina was known for this Klein-Nishina formula, but he became an experimentalist after coming back from Copenhagen. He joined this laboratory called Riken. Riken was close to our university. During the last year of the University we were supposed to start reading on some specialized topics, choosing solid state or condensed matter, or whatever.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIs this the last year before you went to the Army?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo this is your third year at University?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Of course, particle physics was not available, and even our professor did not encourage the group. He thought it was too difficult for us.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid people distinguish between particle physics and nuclear physics at that time?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not yet. But nuclear physics was what you learned.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhere was Tomonaga?\n\nNambu:\n\nTomonaga was in a nearby University called Tsukuba right now and is located elsewhere, but in those days it was a different name. Then, it was called the University of Education. It was meant for training high school teachers.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you were about to say about your special topics readings?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. We wanted to study particle physics because of the fame of Yukawa who became very famous in those days. It was a most appealing or challenging topic. Four or five of us decided to study and get into particle physics. Of course, we were discouraged.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWho were the four or five?\n\nNambu:\n\nOne of them I can mention because he also became famous. He is Chushiro Hayashi. He went to Kyoto University, to the Yukawa Institute there, and he did great pioneering work on nuclear physics and cosmology. He’s internationally well known. He also got a national medal. I think he also got a Kyoto prize, which is a very prestigious international prize.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd the others didn’t stay in physics?\n\nNambu:\n\nSome of them stayed in physics, but I don’t know what happened to them, actually.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo what did you end up doing for your special reading course?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, we started reading the “Review of the Modern Physics” article by Bethe, 1936. It’s generally referred to as Bethe’s Bible. It is a set of two articles written by him, Bacher, and also by Livingston. And we started reading just the first article under the guidance of Professor Kiichiro Ochiai. I think he went to study nuclear physics under Heisenberg in the 1930s. He was not particularly distinguished, but he did agree to take care of us. So we read Bethe, followed by I think a book, Heitler’s book Quantum Theory of Radiation, and some on statistical mechanics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo was Heitler’s book in German or English?\n\nNambu:\n\nJust English. And also I want to mention that in those days, because the war was on already, we could ignore the copyright laws. So an enterprising classmate of ours started a photocopying business and he made copies on demand for us. So he gave us those books on demand and sold the books to other universities.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas it easy to get a hold of either RPM or??\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I think so.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd how about Heitler’s book?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, these were all available in the library.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd what was the third book you mentioned?\n\nNambu:\n\nFowler’s Statistical Mechanics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you did all of those in one year?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd your preparation beforehand, you’d had enough quantum mechanics and enough statistical mechanics to be able to read those fairly advanced texts.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you make it through Heitler’s book?\n\nNambu:\n\nI don’t remember that. Probably not all through. Fowler’s book was huge so I don’t think we read it all.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd then you were drafted into the Army.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhat was the status of your education? Did you get a degree?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I was supposed to get a degree at the Master’s level. There was also graduate school if we wanted to go there—nobody really went into that because it wasn’t required to get a job.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo, I missed at which you decided that physics was going to be your topic. But let me ask this question first. When you went into the science program at Tokyo University, did everyone who went to the science program take the same courses, the same program, or did you distinguish between chemistry, physics??\n\nNambu:\n\nYou applied to some specific department, physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc., and each department had its own program.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd when you say that graduate school was not required for a job, what kind of job could you expect with a degree?\n\nNambu:\n\nA university job.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAs an instructor?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Not a professor, not right away. But an instructor or an assistant.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd this would be teaching and research?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAt what point when you were in the science program at Tokyo University did you choose physics rather than math, for example?\n\nNambu:\n\nThat was when I applied for the university; you apply for a particular department, physics or chemistry or something like that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo even though everyone in the science program follows the same program, you apply to different departments?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, including medical school, too.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo at the end of higher school, you knew that you wanted to do physics and not math.\n\nNambu:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas there some way that you made that decision?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, that was a hard decision for me, because I had an interest in mathematics, and even in the humanities. But I don’t know how I decided or ended up in physics, but apparently I saw it as the most feasible for me.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIn what way?\n\nNambu:\n\nMy ability; I did quite well in mathematics but did not want to devote my whole life to mathematics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBecause??\n\nNambu:\n\nBecause it is too abstract. And also this fame of Yukawa cannot be ignored. He was a national hero at that time.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd one of the things you describe was the prevalence of Marxist theory at the university.\n\nNambu:\n\nEverybody was interested in Marxism. You mentioned that my interest was influenced by some physicist, like Taketani Sakata.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI was going to ask about that, but more in general about the milieu, the environment in the university. And some of the things Laurie Brown wrote was that some of the academics saw Marxism as a counterpart to the militarism that was prevalent.\n\nNambu:\n\nWe were not to be taught such things at the school, but we read them in the books.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd discussed them in the dormitories?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, yes. I have to modify this statement: At the higher school, my roommates did not discuss political problems.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you see them then as a way of opposing the militarism, or was it just an idea to talk about?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, not really a way of opposing the militarism, I was not conscious of that. I might tell you that during the University a very interesting thing happened. One of our classmates was an underground communist. He was a very nice man, and he was the enterprising person who made photocopies.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo he was a communist and an entrepreneur.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes, very interesting. I made very good friends with him. He liked me, and he told me all about things that I did not know about. Another classmate who studied with me the same books that I mentioned, the one who wanted to do particle physics, he was the son of some high ranking naval officer working at the headquarters, I believe, in Tokyo. He knew all this secret news about the war situation. So for example, after some big naval battle in the Pacific, and Japan lost it, but the government would not tell us that we lost it or something. But he knew everything, so the next day he would tell us everything, like some aircraft carriers were lost. I didn’t know even the names of those carriers, their existence was secret. He was also a leftist. So I was surrounded by those kinds of people.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDo you mean you were surrounded by leftists?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas that true that they were mostly leftists?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, I was surrounded by at least two or three such people, including this communist guy who also told me about all the secrets, certain news that was going on.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhat was your family’s reaction to picking a career in physics? Was that a good decision?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes, I think so. I don’t remember any objections.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo they didn’t, for example, say, “There aren’t many jobs, you should find something more profitable.”\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, he never said that. What he actually encouraged me to go into was any academic career.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd for your father it didn’t matter whether it was science or humanities?\n\nNambu:\n\nI don’t think it mattered much, no.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid your mother?\n\nNambu:\n\nShe wouldn’t say much about those things.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you are now going into the Army, and you received your degree before going into the Army? Is that right?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you started doing radar research?\n\nNambu:\n\nNot right away. In those days the university students could start kind of a special career in the Army or Navy leading up to becoming an officer in a short period of time. So it was sort of a program that was available. So every student tried to apply for that, and I flunked it the first time because of my health conditions. So I was assigned to become a regular soldier. The first time I was drafted into a regiment in Tokyo because I was born there and my family register was in Tokyo. I spent about a year there as a regular rank and file soldier. The special program to become an officer, I flunked that, but still being a university graduate I could become an officer more easily and I was sent to some kind of academy near Tokyo to become an officer in the Engineer Corps. And a second time, a year later when I was in the Army, I also applied to become a technical officer. That was the position I had applied for previously and flunked.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas there education in the Engineering Corps?\n\nNambu:\n\nA kind of training, basic training—digging holes and trenches. Actually my specialty in our company was to operate the outboard motor boat for landing.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo that’s what you did, you didn’t do any kind of mathematics or physics.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you applied a second time to become an officer, and this time you passed.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd how did that change your condition?\n\nNambu:\n\nThen I was assigned to an army radar laboratory. There were several specialized army laboratories, ten or so, and one of them was specialized in radar.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas that in Tokyo as well?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, near Tokyo. So I was assigned there and had a certain basic training for three months about electronics. Then I was appointed to that laboratory, but by that time the war was getting closer and closer to us, to Japan. We had to evacuate from Tokyo because air raids were going on. So part of the laboratory was evacuated to Osaka area, and I spent the last year of the war there engaged in this radar research.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhich means what?\n\nNambu:\n\nWhich means I was kind of a liaison officer between the Army and the universities and industry.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nUniversity in general, industry in general?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Osaka University was closest, and professors from Osaka were consultants for us. And they came regularly to our lab and we had discussion sessions and workshops and things like that. Also I went out to other universities and found out what they were doing in terms of war research and things like that. Also we went to companies, different industrial companies, including Matsushita and Sharp.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd what did you learn?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, that was very, very interesting. I learned quite a bit in the lab. The head professor consultant from Osaka was by the name of Kenjiro Okabe, who was one of the early contributors to the development of the magnetron.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd what did you talk about, what did you do?\n\nNambu:\n\nWe talked about the design of wave guides, as far as I remember. Basically we were most concerned about that because our magnetrons were very inefficient and the power was small, so you did want to lose much power during transmission. So how to design wave guides for wavelength of 10 cm, let’s say. The magnetron available at that time was made by Toshiba. Our section of the lab, which moved to this Osaka area, was specializing in detection of submarines by radar. Of course, we could not do it, but that was our aim. So I was engaged in a lot of tests of the radar equipment. We mounted a dish antenna on top of a trailer, and inside the trailer there’s the magnetron and the power source and things like that. We are supposed to detect the submarine periscopes. Osaka is facing the inland sea of Japan, so we went to that seaside and set up this equipment, hired a fisherman to go out with a steel pipe put up on his boat, and we wanted to detect it at 300 meters, or something like that. We never succeeded in that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo not only were you talking to people from industry and the universities, but you were also testing equipment?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas this equipment that you designed or built?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, no, no, who designed it I don’t remember. But a company made it, I think. Of course we built some primitive parts of the equipment, but I never did it myself; some other people did it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd was this the first exposure you’d had to research in industry?\n\nNambu:\n\nThat’s true, yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you notice any differences to what you had seen academia?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, that’s completely different, of course. It is like what happened in the Manhattan Project here. Those young university students went to Los Alamos and worked out the real program together with professors. So that was the kind of atmosphere at our laboratory in Osaka.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut what about in industry? Did you get much exposure to how it was done in industry in Japan?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, it was just more or less superficial inspection and talking to people.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWere you ever tempted to work in research in industry?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, I don’t think so.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOne thing I forgot to ask: when you went to the Army, did all of the students from the university go to the Army?\n\nNambu:\n\nMost of them, unless they were rejected, went to either Navy or Army. Now Navy is more difficult to get in—the standards are much higher.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo everybody went.\n\nNambu:\n\nEverybody went.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you were in the Army for three years, and after the first year you did radar research for two years?\n\nNambu:\n\nTwo years, yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas there anything else in the Army that we should talk about? Maybe I can ask you this. You wrote one sentence in one of your recollections that the Army was not a waste of time, that it was a big influence for you professionally and personally. How do you mean?\n\nNambu:\n\nFirst of all, it was hands-on research, essentially, that we were engaged in, as opposed to just going to lectures. Also mingling with the kinds of people coming from all walks of life. So not just university physics students, but coming from colleges or technical colleges. In the first of the Army, of course, I was just one of the rank and file soldiers, so all of these from broad classes of society also got together, and it was a very, very interesting sort of experience for me.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo what did you learn about hands-on research?\n\nNambu:\n\nFirst, there is a ridiculous thing, but the first assignment I got when first I got into this lab was to see whether or not one can detect a submarine from an aircraft magnetically. One of the pieces of equipment or material I was given was a little piece of magnetic alloy: “Do something with it!” [laughs] I couldn’t imagine how we could detect a submarine, you know? But anyway, I did, and I think I went on a test flight. Of course my report was negative. But then moving to the other site we had frequent workshops with the professors from Osaka and Tokyo. Dr. Kotani, I already mentioned that he taught us quantum mechanics. He worked for both the Army and the Navy, I believe; Tomonaga was working for the Navy. At the Navy laboratory near Mt. Fuji, the two people worked out the theory of the magnetron, and it was very, very interesting. That was published after the war. I understand that Julian Schwinger also did the same thing. Also, Tomonaga, he never worked for the Army, but he developed the S-matrix theory of wave guides, which also Schwinger did. So at the workshops, there was a rumor going around that Tomonaga did that. The Army and Navy were almost completely separate.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd Tomonaga was with the Army?\n\nNambu:\n\nWith the Navy. So I learned something about Tomonaga’s theory, and even I was ordered to get a hold of the secret documents. So I studied those things, and learned the theory of the S-matrix for the first time.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIn the context of wave guides.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Also I joined this workshop for solving the efficiency of transmission wave guides, so I also tried various calculations and things like that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWere there other topics in these workshops?\n\nNambu:\n\nAll of the workshops mostly was about the transmission problem. That’s about it. Also testing of equipment and also some repairing of equipment, going out to the airfields. Also I remember one incident about the B-29, the bomber which came day and night. And one of them apparently dropped radar equipment in to the sea accidentally. This was scanning equipment, and it was picked up by the fishermen and brought to our lab. I think It went around from lab to lab, both Army and Navy. We dissected it and looked at the inside, and we marveled at how ingenious the Americans were. That was a radar using 3 centimeter wavelength generated by klystron which we could not produce yet. It was a special oscillator tube. I think it was made by Western Electric or something like that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you figure out what it was and how it worked?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, more or less but the amplifier section was so tiny and all were buried in epoxy. I marveled that the intermediate frequency part was so tiny I could not figure out what was inside.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI just wanted to ask you. You say you mixed of people of different class; this did not happen in the University?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not really to the same extent. At the University we had all gone through the higher education, but most people in the Army never had as much education.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nTo sixth grade was compulsory, but above sixth grade was it public and free, or private for a fee?\n\nNambu:\n\nBoth public and private schools were available, and I went to a public school, but its not free.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo was there a class distinction in the people who went to higher school and to university?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, not really. Of course I was from a small town and we didn’t have much of a class distinction. My father’s case, he went to a private university in Tokyo, so it was a bit of difference.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo that put you in the upper??\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, interns of social status and prestige.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhen you read this Tomonaga paper about the S-matrix theory of wave guides, was that the first time you were aware of Tomonaga?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not the first time. Actually in my university years some of us wanted to do particle physics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd by particle physics you mean nuclear physics.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, no, not nuclear physics. Particle physics like by Yukawa and Tomonaga. And that was available only at Kyoto and Nishina’s laboratory at Riken near our university. Nishina had two cyclotrons there doing sort of particle physics. It was nuclear physics that would become particle physics. The discovery of mu mesons and things like that happened there. And Tomonaga was joining Nishina and had regular weekly seminars there in the laboratory. So some of us sneaked out of the University and went to hear the seminars, and that was my experience. That happened several times in the last year of my university.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhy do you say “sneaked out”?\n\nNambu:\n\nIt wasn’t really sneaking out, we went freely out of our own will.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you heard Tomonaga or his associates speak?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Nishina and Tomonaga were always leading the seminars together, and I was impressed. We learned quite a lot by listening just to them about cosmic ray physics in the first place. And also I distinctly remember a couple of occasions where Tomonaga? usually Tomonaga tried to explain things very kindly and clearly to us, to the audience, and he read a letter from Shoichi Sakata, his close associate who was in Nagoya at that time, had moved there from Riken, about his theory of cosmic rays. For example, just a few months before I was drafted into the Army, the summer of 1942, Tomonaga read a letter from Sakata saying that the cosmic ray mesons and Yukawa’s particles are two different things. This is the so-called two meson theory. And he explained to us what that theory was, and I was very impressed.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd so the preparation you’d had was sufficient to understand.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd this is why you’re reading Heitler and Bethe?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I think so.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd were you known to that group? Did you talk to them at all?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, we never dared do that. We were in the back part of the room and we just listened.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd was it 5, 10, 15 people?\n\nNambu:\n\nMaybe 20 or so. A group of Nishina and Tomonaga’s lab.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did other people from other places come, or was it just you?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo I don’t think so; just us.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd they didn’t know who you were at this time.\n\nNambu:\n\nI don’t think they knew.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd this was before you went to the Army.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo in ‘45 you go back to the University of Tokyo. Now how did that happen?\n\nNambu:\n\nUpon graduation, graduating students get assigned to some jobs.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAutomatically?\n\nNambu:\n\nNot automatically, but the professors arrange the things for the students. Fortunately I was retained as a kind of post-doc at Tokyo.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo who retained you?\n\nNambu:\n\nI was given a notice, that was it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThis is before you went to the Army?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. So I was supposed to be on leave for some time during the war. And after the war, because Japan lost the war, whether I could keep the job or not was not clear. But fortunately I was able to go back to Tokyo after the war.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd Tokyo—now things have changed.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYou mentioned several times the new democratizing feeling of the university. So what was different?\n\nNambu:\n\nThere was a kind of chaos at that time, really, because nobody called the shots. Everybody was busy just finding a way to live and eat. So even some of the professors lived in their own offices. And we had to scrounge for food—that was the main job for us.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you were there for four years?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, that’s right. I thought it was three, but over three years, maybe four.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo life was hard, but in the meantime, who else was there with you that you were talking to?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, in Tokyo, my roommates, maybe a dozen or so people could work there. It was a big office or lab space or something like that. Many of them had just come back from the war. Not everybody had a regular job at the University, but they would come in and stay there to study. One of my closest friends was Ziro Koba. He had a desk space just across from me. He was a graduate student working for Tomonaga. Why that happened, because Tomonaga was never a professor at Tokyo, but somehow the last year of the war before I went back there, he was for a year a visiting professor at Tokyo University. So he started to take on some students, and Koba was one of them. At that time Tomonaga was working out his re-normalization theory, so Koba helped him. I watched him do the calculation, and slowly I learned what that was.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you have a research topic of your own?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not at all. I was just given a sort of job. Nobody took care of me, actually, because I was trying to work out particle physics things and there was no professor there to talk to. I don’t know what Professor Ochiai was doing, he was probably having a difficult time. I don’t know. I don’t think he was coming into office at all.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you’ve described how difficult life was. How much of your time were you capable of committing to study or to research?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, that is very interesting. Almost all the time, except for going out and buying food or looking for food. Day and night, actually. There was another guy who lived in my room, and still another in the adjacent room and day and night we talked physics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWho were they?\n\nNambu:\n\nGiicti Iwata and Ko Aizu.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYou were telling us about your office mates when you went back to Tokyo in 1946?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. I talked about Koba. He later went to Copenhagen, and he’s best known for the Koba-Nielsen formula about string.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYou were talking about the three people that you worked with all day and all night?\n\nNambu:\n\nThree people, one was Giichi Iwata, and he was I think a lecturer or something or other, so he was senior to me. And he was the one who really first introduced me to modern physics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhat do you mean, “modern physics”?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, not really modern physics, I shouldn’t say. Particle theory.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nMeaning?\n\nNambu:\n\nMeaning things like higher wave equations of various kinds—higher spin and things like that. And he also introduced me to the Ising model. That became quite an industry at that time. Onsager theory got published during the wartime, and I think it reached Japan after the war, probably. And Mr. Kubo, he was one year senior to me in my class in the university, and he was kept as an assistant. He didn’t have to go to the Army fortunately because he was an important figure in the Physics Department, so he stayed there, and of course had a lot of good students under him. Those students were just next door to my office. But I did not really closely interact with him or his group, except that through Iwata I learned about the Ising model.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas Iwata a student of Kubo?\n\nNambu:\n\nI think he was older than Kubo, so a student of somebody else. He taught me all those things besides physics, like Latin, Greek. [laughs] He was a very erudite person. He even translated Lucretius’ poems from Latin into Japanese and published it. That happened before my eyes!\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you learned about higher spinwave functions. Was there a strong reaction to Onsaga’s solution as a counterexample to Landau theory? Or was it just interesting by itself?\n\nNambu:\n\nInteresting by itself, yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nJust the fact that he’d solved it exactly.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas there awareness of Landau theory?\n\nNambu:\n\nI was not aware of that myself. I was fascinated by the mathematics side of the Onsager solution, and worked at my own way of solving it. That was my first work.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut not published.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, it was published, yes. [Refers to papers] The first, number one?\n\nAshrafi:\n\n“The Relativistic Formulation of Perturbation Theory.” There is an Ising, but it looks like it came later, if I recall correctly.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, the eigenvalue problem or something like that?\n\nAshrafi:\n\n“Eigenvalue Problems in Crystal Lattices,” published 1958.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, because I did not publish it for two years. That was just a mathematics problem, so it wasn’t very interesting.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut you did it before your other work.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, that’s right. When I first started work in Tokyo, that was my first work. I was at least happy that I was able to do this. Then right away there was the discovery of the pi meson and then a Lamb shift, so I switched my interest right away to that. That is why I did not publish this. But later, Kodi Husini, a professor at Osaka who was a graduate from Tokyo, he was a brilliant person, and he also worked out his own way of solving this Onsager problem. I went later to Osaka and I told him about my work, and he was very interested in my work too, so he encouraged me to publish, and that’s how I published it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you said there were three people you worked with day and night, and you mentioned Iwata.\n\nNambu:\n\nThere were only two people actually in the same room, Iwata and me, and two more in adjacent room.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd who were the others?\n\nNambu:\n\nThe one in the next room was Ko Aizu. That room housed mostly Kubo’s students, but I do not think Aizu was his student. In another room lived Seitaro Nakamura and his family. He was Yukawa’s student in Kyoto.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWell, maybe I should ask what you were talking about with them.\n\nNambu:\n\nTalking about the latest happenings in physics, like discoveries and things like that. Including the Onsager solution for one thing. There was not much I learned from Aizu or Nakamura. But we talked, the four of us.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd when you started thinking about the Lamb shift, who were you talking to? What were you reading?\n\nNambu:\n\nAh, yes, let me try to recall. There was the Physical Review generally available, but only a few copies I think reached Tokyo. The guy called Mitsuo Taketani, who was one of the collaborators of Yukawa. On his own he made his name because he was a very articulate person and had kind of philosophical theories about doing physics or research.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh, this is Sakata and Taketani? Did you meet them first after the war, or did you meet them at University?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, I met them first after the war.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd were they at Tokyo?\n\nNambu:\n\nSakata was at Nagoya University. Taketani was living in Tokyo at that time and he would come to visit us occasionally, to our office.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut he didn’t work at the University.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, no. He was kind of an independent person. He may have had some position at Rikkyo University. And he had his friend, Seitaro Nakamura, who was living across the hall from my office, so he would visit him and he would come into our office too and chat. A very interesting person.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd Sakata?\n\nNambu:\n\nSakata never showed up here. He was in Nagoya, but I knew of his name and his theories.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo, these are the two people you associated with the dialectical materialism and fossil fuel science?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you learned about this while you were at Tokyo University?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. I knew something about that because in my higher school days, I read Marx and Lenin and things like that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd in your higher school days, did you read them as part of the education?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not at all.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo what was this philosophy of science?\n\nNambu:\n\nSakata’s theory or Taketani’s theory?\n\nAshrafi:\n\nEither one. Are they the same?\n\nNambu:\n\nThey are more or less the same, because they are close associates and worked together.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh, they knew each other and worked together.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, they were both Yukawa’s students and worked together on the meson theory with Yukawa. Sakata is the more famous and more talented a person. When Taketani was a student early on in the 1930s, he started out right away from theoretical views of his, about how physics develops. And that is now called Taketani’s “three stages” theory, namely that physics goes through three stages repeatedly. First a phenomenological stage where you discover something new in nature and you really don’t understand that, and you have to study that and get the data and find in the phenomenon some kind of regularity, some kind of law there. Then you try to explain that regularity in terms of some kind of hypothesis, in terms of some kind of particles or whatever. The first stage is describing the phenomenon in terms of a formula of a phenomenological nature. Then you have to try to find an explanation for the origin of the phenomenon in terms of some concrete objects. For example, you had conservation of mass in the 19th century, and regularity in the chemical reactions, initial sum of the mass equals the sum of the total final mass, which you explain in terms of some kind of elementary particles or units of mass. So that’s the kind of explanation that comes into the second stage. But that is not the final story and one has to really find the final more detailed or precise mathematical framework. So Faraday’s law had to work into the Maxwell theory, the Maxwell equations. Then, according to Taketani, that is not the end of physics, so eventually there will come up some new phenomenon which you cannot explain by the existing theory. So we have to start over again. That was Taketani’s three stage theory.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo part of the theory is about how knowledge develops, and another part of the theory is that it is never finished.\n\nNambu:\n\nRight, right. So he applied this to the ongoing physics and particle physics going on at the time. Sakata also took that up. And he was also a leftist of some kind. He left a bad influence politically in the Japanese physics community as a result. Although he was himself a great physicist.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhat do you mean, bad?\n\nNambu:\n\nDogmatic. Like Stalin, like what happened in Russia.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhere people who didn’t believe Sakata’s view were excluded?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, he politicized physics in that way. And we cant talk about it more later on. But anyway, but the important thing that I learned from him was, for example, what stage are we in now?\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo is this something that was commonly discussed among the people you worked with?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo this was a topic of discussion, to determine in Taketani’s theory what stage are we in now. Was it written down?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes, he was a prolific writer and wrote a lot of books in Japanese.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo what stage did you decide you were in?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, in Taketani’s time the problem was that they did not know what the cosmic ray meson, the moon, was. They were in the first stage, the phenomenological stage, and they moved to the second stage when they explained it in terms of the two meson hypothesis. Then, during my time w hen I went back to the university, new particles called V particles or strange particles were discovered also in the cosmic rays. So we again had to work out and understand what they were to move to the second stage. For example, one of the problems was why those new particles had a long life, relatively speaking. With my colleagues, I was able to explain it by postulating associative production, which means that they have a new quantum number and are produced only in pairs. Once produced, each has a long life because it can decay only by violating the conservation of the quantum number. There was a consciousness, in my mind, of the three stages.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo did you use the theory to set research priorities?\n\nNambu:\n\nNot really priorities, but I had this kind of thing in mind when I did research.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nHow did it affect your research?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, both positively and negatively.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIn what way?\n\nNambu:\n\nFor example, in 1957, I had a theory of this new particle, omega meson, as it’s called omega now. [Shuffle through papers] Ah yes, it’s on the bottom.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo “Possible existence of a heavy neutral meson”, in 1957?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you were saying how the Taketani theory affected your work.\n\nNambu:\n\nThe problem that I wanted to solve was that nuclear forces had to be saturated to form a stable nuclei. So there must be some kind of short range repulsive force. And then there was an additional problem of understanding why the electromagnetic form factor of a neutron was almost zero. So I wanted to solve them by postulating a new neutral particle and it’s now called omega meson. In those days, people were trying to solve this kind of problem, most of them, not in terms of a new particle or something like that, but in terms of existing meson theories. After Pi meson was discovered, people thought that the particle that mediates the strong interaction. There was a strong reluctance to pose that there are many elementary particles. So once it was stated that that was it, that was the end of the story. That was the kind of thinking that people had. On the other hand, Taketani and Sakata’s school did not hesitate to introduce any particle. Yukama maybe did it first, but Sakata went on farther.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd how does this relate to the Taketani theory?\n\nNambu:\n\nTaketani is the one who did that kind of thing. According to the Taketani theory, the second stage is to try to understand the phenomenon in the terms of concrete objects.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI see. So that made it easier for you to think about new particles that would explain the theory?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Still I was reluctant to do so, I remember that. And also I had in mind that this particle should be another elementary particle. I never thought the meson would be just a bound state of quarks, for example. Once it’s an elementary particle, it should be rather stable. I didn’t understand why an elementary particle should be unstable by itself. So I tried to keep the mass of the new particle as low as possible so they would not decay into three pions, for example. So that’s one of the kinds of prejudice I had. And it turned out to have much higher mass than three pions.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you ever get more involved in Marxist theory?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not really. I was very disgusted by Lenin.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAt what time?\n\nNambu:\n\nHigher school.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIs there anything else we should say about the Taketani-Sakata philosophy? You mentioned it several times in your recollections, like you mention your materialism as opposed to Sudarchan’s principled approach. So with this materialist philosophy influence your whole work, your whole career?\n\nNambu:\n\nCertainly during the ‘60s, yes. But in spite of that when I worked out the theory of spontaneous break down. It had nothing to do with that kind of thing.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIs it a theory you thought about much more when you were younger? Or when you were in Tokyo, the philosophy of Taketani?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, in those days.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI guess I’m trying to understand how important it was in your estimation, to your work?\n\nNambu:\n\nAt least in my generation of physicists, this philosophy had a great influence on them.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut not Yukawa and Tomonaga.\n\nNambu:\n\nYukawa was sort of aloof. Of course both Sakata and Taketani both were his students. But he did not really embrace that kind of thing, really, with enthusiasm.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid he dislike it?\n\nNambu:\n\nIt is difficult to say. But later on, in the later ‘60s, Sakata became more kind of radical in the political sense. He tried to spread his influence all over Japan. Yakawa was not that kind of radical. He was a very interesting person, but he was not a political activist. So essentially during the 1960s, the whole of Japan was divided into two halves. One formed that way out to the west under Sakata’s influence. But to the east his influence did not reach. Sakata himself was a great physicist, but his underlings were not; just blind believers in Sakata philosophy. But he wanted to appoint those underlings to various universities to spread his influence. For example, Yukawa once had a student who he placed at the university in Kyushu. Sakata worked secretly to undermine that appointment, and he succeeded and placed his own man there. I don’t know what Yukawa thought of that, I really don’ t know. And these two groups, west and east physicists, were not on speaking terms at the time. So I was supposed to be regarded as belonging to the east because I was from Tokyo. Moreover, I lived and worked in America, which they regarded as the enemy. So I was kind of an unwanted person.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo in the era of ’45 to ’49, this divide hadn’t arisen yet.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut you knew of the Taketani-Sakata theory and it was already influential?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd your first work was on the Ising model, but you switched quickly to the Lamb shift work. And you were watching the Tomonaga theory develop in front of you. So the other papers that you did in this period were “The Level Shift of the Anomalous Magnetic Moment,” and “Meson Theory and Quantization.” You did two papers on second configuration space and quantization.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, that’s a kind of mathematical formalism—I was fascinated by the mathematical side of those, yes. That was not the way of the Yukawa school.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo basically you did one thing on the Ising model, then you started working on formal aspects of second quantization? Is that right?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd this describes most of your time and energy between ’45 and ’49.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, right.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nNow how does it occur that you go to Osaka in ‘49?\n\nNambu:\n\nI had a kind of a post-doc type job, and I was not sure what my future would be.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThis is at Tokyo?\n\nNambu:\n\nTokyo. At that time we worked hard. Those people of my generation joined, organized a union within the university, so we worked hard on it to improve our status at the university. And as a result of which I was able to get an assistant job. An assistant is a sort of regular governmental position; post-doc type is not. So once you get this permanent job, you are very safe.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThis is all at Tokyo?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. But I am not sure you can get any promotion after that, you know, because the positions were scarce. But fortunately this new university system was instituted in 1949 or ‘50 or thereabouts by order of MacArthur. The system was reorganized, and also new universities opened up. For example, each prefecture (there are 40 or 50 so prefectures in Japan, like the states in this country), and each prefecture was supposed to have at least one national university. But also there were other universities that sprang up, like city universities and things like that. In Osaka, there was a university specialized in business school. The city of Osaka operated that university. It was promoted into a larger type university, which started to open up a school of science and engineering. So they started to recruit some people and upon the recommendation of Tomonaga, I got a job to go there.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nNow how did Tomonaga know you?\n\nNambu:\n\nBecause I started working with Koba, and through Koba I eventually got to know Tomonaga, and I was invited to give a seminar at his university. That’s how I got closer to Tomonaga.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd this is your work on quantization?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, about the level shift.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you got to know him in?\n\nNambu:\n\nI don’t know.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThe paper was published in ’49.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, so I think I really got to know him in ’47 or ’48. I joined his seminars.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBefore we move on, were very involved in the union organizing at Tokyo University?\n\nNambu:\n\nMyself, I was not really involved, but my classmates and some other senior people, did. After I went to the university, Osaka City University, I remember once I presided as a chairman of a union meeting.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you attended union meetings. Did everyone attend union meetings?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, I don’t think so.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYou had an interest, then?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, I did not really have too much of an interest, but I really had to do something once in a while.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you became an assistant at Tokyo, and you moved as an assistant to Osaka, with the same position.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not assistant. That’s an interesting story. I became a professor right away.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOn Tomonaga’s recommendation?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. There were four of us who went from Tokyo to Osaka City University. And four of us were all in Tokyo. I was the most senior person, and the next one was Satio Hayakawa. He worked under Tomonaga. And next was YoshioYamaguchi, who I don’t think was a student of Tomonaga, though maybe he was, but he studied at Tokyo. The last one was Kazuhiko Nishijima. I don’t think he was officially Tomonaga’s student, but he was in Tokyo anyway. So four of us w ho were close in Tomonaga’s circles were appointed to the new jobs. And because I was most senior, I became a professor. The next, Hayakawa, became an associate professor, and Yamaguchi became a lecturer, and Nishijima was an assistant. There was one more, Tadao Nakano who came from Osaka University to Osaka City University.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhen you went from your first position at Tokyo to assistant, did your duties change? Did your responsibilities change?\n\nNambu:\n\nMy duties in Tokyo were almost nothing. Just to take care of students, to help them work out problems.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nLike tutoring?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, tutoring kind of thing at problem solving sessions.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd when you went to Osaka??\n\nNambu:\n\nBecause we started brand new, there were no students yet. Maybe there was one or two. So we didn’t have to do any formal courses. So it was kind of tutoring again.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid you have to get involved in the administration of organizing a new department?\n\nNambu:\n\nOnly I had to attend faculty meetings made up of professors. So I had regular professor meetings.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo did your life change much from ’49 to ’52 when you were at Osaka? You didn’t have to do much teaching, there weren’t that many students, so were you??\n\nNambu:\n\nAbout the same, it was a very light duty. In fact when I was at Tokyo I did more or less the same kind of things. Except that I was married at the time, but I left my wife you see, back in Osaka when I went to Tokyo after the war.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSorry, when were you married?\n\nNambu:\n\nI married right after the war, and she was left in Osaka. I left her in Osaka and went to Tokyo myself.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh you married in Osaka, I see.\n\nNambu:\n\nSo now I came back to Osaka, so I was with her.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh, is that the reason you wanted to go to Osaka? Did you ask for that position?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, I didn’t ask. Somehow I was offered that job. But they knew that I was from Osaka and that I was married.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you were back with your wife in Osaka, but now being married you don’t spend all the time in your office working. So things change a little bit.\n\nNambu:\n\nA little bit. Except that still in the miserable conditions of that time, the physics department was opened in kind of a shack. They used a burned out concrete grade school building, and they remodeled it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYour family lived in there?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not my family. We were living with her parents. The living conditions were really horrible, even at that time. But we didn’t have any duties to speak of.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo from ’49 to ’52 you’re still working on lots of things now. You’re working more on quantization and meson theory.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, there’s a paper on that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWell there’s one “Effect of C-meson field, an Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Electron” with Koba and Tati?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, these were papers I did in Tokyo. Koba actually moved to Osaka University at the same time. So we were close friends and neighbors.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nNow, Kinoshita [?], when did you make Kinoshita’s acquaintance?\n\nNambu:\n\nThat was 1946. He was a student and also worked under Tomonaga at that time, and he had his desk in the same office.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo he was a Tokyo student working with Tomonaga at Riken.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I think so.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd this paper was published while you were at Osaka.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut the work was done when you were in Tokyo?\n\nNambu:\n\nI suppose so, yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you have a series of papers with Kinoshita, but I see in 1951 you published a paper with Nishijima and Yamaguchi on V particles. So were you mostly working on strange particles at Osaka?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Not only that, but that was my main interest, because those are the new particles that came out.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo the three of you at Osaka worked on this paper. Was it a tight group?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, very tight group.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you were working on all the same or similar projects?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, yes. And also I must say that Hayakawa, who became an associate professor under me, he went to America for a short period of time, during the summer of 1950 or so, to MIT. Worked under Bruno Rossi because his main interest was in cosmic ray physics. At first he was a theorist under Tomonaga but later switched to experimental physics, and then he did x-ray astronomy. He went to MIT, and he would send us all the news that he got there, including the stories about V particles. And we would think how to interpret the V particles. So we were vaguely aware of what was going on. But then we went ahead on our own to undertake that, understanding V particles in concrete terms, and we came up with a theory of V particles. Also, at the same time, a few other people in Tokyo and some other universities, young people our age, came up with ideas very similar to our theory of V particles. And also in this country, Abraham Pais had the same kind of a theory. So that was the first successful work that we did, when I became the boss of that group.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you were the boss of that group. What does that mean? What did you do?\n\nNambu:\n\nI was senior, I was kind of moderating the other people to do this kind of thing. For example, I got fascinated by that new plasma theory by Bohm and Pines. It’s a modern formulation of plasma oscillations. Plasma theory was first introduced by Langmuir in the 1920s. But the modern theory showed how to treat collective modes in a medium in general. I got fascinated by that theory that appeared in Physics Review one night in Osaka. Se we undertook a study of the plasmas, the Bohm-Pines theory. My interests continued after that in that direction, and when I came to the institute at Princeton, my project was to apply the theory, to understand, explain the saturation of nuclear forces. Kind of how to handle the many-body problems in general, and also to understand the origin of the spin-orbit forces in nuclear physics. I did not succeed in that, but I had a very keen interested in that kind of theory.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo your interest in Tomonaga theory, in field quantization, started when you were at Tokyo, and you had also seen the Ising model, and you brought those same interests to Osaka.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nNow one difference is that you have more information from America while you were at Osaka. Now why the interest in Bohm-Pines? What fascinated you about that?\n\nNambu:\n\nI don’t really know. I already had an interest in many-body problems when I was a student at Tokyo.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd was this because of the second quantization?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, I don’t know; I don’t really remember why.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThis is the first time in our conversation you’ve mentioned this topic.\n\nNambu:\n\nI don’t know why I had an interest in many-body problems.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWas it perhaps someone you were talking with?\n\nNambu:\n\nBecause the Tokyo University was stronger in condensed matter physics, and Katani, Kubo and the people around then were doing it, and that’s why also I got interested in solving the nuclear force problem that was also a many-body problem, the nature of the potential between nucleons, for example. How do you derive a potential from the field theory, from Yukawa’s meson theory? And what is the correct form of the potential that includes relativistic effects. So I had a great interest in that sort of problem.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd was it common for people to think about both topics, high energy and low energy, or was it rare in your community?\n\nNambu:\n\nProbably rare. In the first place, high-energy physics was not really much in Tokyo. Nuclear physics was around, but still nuclear physics was in its infancy. I also read the history in Japan that when quantum mechanics came out, people in Tokyo were very reluctant or indifferent to quantum theory. They were mainly interested in classical physics. On the other hand, Kyoto people like Yukawa, he was a student at the time, and his professors there were more progressive and took an interest in understanding quantum mechanics. So Tokyo University was kind of behind the times. And therefore, again, when the particle physics started, they didn’t have much interest in it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut it was not common to think about condensed matter and field theory?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, no, not at all.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWere you aware of any of the Russian literature?\n\nNambu:\n\nLike what?\n\nAshrafi:\n\nMaybe this is too early, I should ask in the ‘60s again. When did you become aware of Matsubara? A lot of Russians refer to Matsubara’s work later on in the ‘60s.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, I met Matsubara, but I learned about his work a bit later.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nI’ll ask that later when we come back to the ‘60s. So we were at Osaka, and you’re telling me you had a new research interest now in plasma theory. You’re in Osaka from ’49 to ’52, and you’re newly married, and you have two children in this period?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo I had only one. The second was born in Chicago. Right now we have only one. We lost the second one.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIs there something else about Osaka we should say? You’re now in a new position as the leader of a research group.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. A couple of interesting things. One is that in those days there was not much interaction between the universities in Japan. Each had its own territory, let’s say. And it was not common to send a graduate from one university to another, especially between Tokyo and Kyoto—they were rivals! So naturally we thought that was a very lamentable situation, and we saw that we—by “we ” I mean the younger generation of people—to have more interaction among the universities and people. So we instituted a new system of visiting students, sort of itinerant students, let’s say. In the feudal days there were samurai who were unemployed and followed no particular lords so there was a name for them which we adopted for these students, and started exchanging them. When we moved from Tokyo to Osaka, we invited young students from Tokyo to come to us, to stay with us for a while, maybe for a couple of months or something. I think this kind of system just took root and still exists now. But anyway, what was interesting was the first arrival of Hironari Miazawa. He made his name by predicting the delta, so he’s one of the people who said that the large ?+ +b cross-section that Fermi discovered here in Chicago was due to a new particle, new resonance. Enrico Fermi did not think of a resonance. Se he was the one who predicted that. He was the first arrival to us from Tokyo. The next one was Koshiba. He got the Nobel prize two years ago for the work on neutrinos in his laboratory. Then some other people followed. At that time their living conditions were so miserable, so they stayed in our laboratories, sleeping on the sofa. That was a sort of odd but interesting interaction that we had. The other one was a kind of anecdote. At that time I cooked up a theory or found some kind of regularity in the masses of elementary particles that were known at that day, and said that this comes in some integer or half-integer multiples of 137. It was the kind of theory where there is no basis for it except just observation. I think actually when I came to this country, Oppenheimer got interested in that, and I think that’s one of the reasons he took an interest in me. That made a newspaper story in Osaka. And some reporter got wind of this and came to interview me. But I was at that time in a movie house seeing a movie. I left home early in the morning saying that I was going to my office, but on my way I stopped at the movie house. When the reporter came to see me, the other guys in our group called my home, and they were told that I had left home already. So they were wondering where I was. Yes, so that was the kind of easy life there at that time. For one thing, it was very hot in the summer and no air-conditioning was available in general, the only place to have air-conditioning was a movie house. It was also a good place to learn English by watching American movies, especially because we were not too used to English conversation. So we liked to stay there as long as possible.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut life was easier than it was in Tokyo?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, it was easier, because I didn’t have to go looking for food.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you’re beginning to become known now. Tomonaga knows you. Are you getting any reactions to your work?\n\nNambu:\n\nAt that time, oh, I think so, but I don’t really know to what extent. He was the one who recommended me to get the job in the first place, and I think I got attention from the Yukawa School people in Kyoto. At that time Yukawa was famous, and after getting the Nobel prize in ’48 or ’49 he became very famous, and Kyoto people built a new institute in his name, a theoretical institute. And some younger generation of people were called in to serve on an advisory committee or something like that. I don’t remember the name. But anyway, we got involved in the running of the institute. I was one of them.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo what other administrative duties did you have when you were in Osaka? One was that you were the leader of your own group; the second, you’re advisor to the new Kyoto Theoretical Institute.\n\nNambu:\n\nI interacted with a cosmic ray group at Osaka. It was a distinguished group, because one of them was an early disciple of Nishina in Tokyo, his name was Seishi Kikuchi. He is famous for showing the diffraction patterns of electron beams after Davisson and Germet. He was appointed professor at Osaka University and he s tarted his own group of disciples, and one of them was a cosmic ray physicist by the name of Yuzuru Watase. He became the dean of the School of Science and Engineering, so he was my boss. And he had his own cosmic ray lab there, and the City University had also a high altitude cosmic ray lab in the mountain area. His group went there to do physics, and also we visited that group occasionally too. So we had a close interaction with his group.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo what did you do when you visited?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, I didn’t do any research myself, but we talked to people, getting information, and discussing physics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you had fresh information from an experimental group. But the question was whether or not you were involved in any kind of administration.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, I was not really involved.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid you have a role in placing students or in determining who would get these trips?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, there were not even students who finished yet.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd what did you do as an advisor to the new Kyoto Institute? What were your duties there?\n\nNambu:\n\nI was there, I don’t know, for very short time period, because I came to America after that. So Hayakawa took my place and he moved to Kyoto.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nShould we move on to Princeton?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo how did it happen that you went to the Institute?\n\nNambu:\n\nThat was upon the recommendation of Tomonaga, I believe. Because after the war, Oppenheimer started to invite some people from Japan, and first Yukawa was invited, and then next was Tomonaga. And after that I guess it was Tomonaga or Yukawa who they recommended some younger people. So first after Tomonaga one of Tomonaga’s students from his university went there. And after that Kinoshita and I were chosen. That’s how that came about.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid you know it was going to happen? Was it a surprise?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, no, I did not.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you just got a letter one day inviting you?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I suppose so. I still have the letter somewhere. I did not really expect that to happen although I was eager to go abroad, at least for a short period of time.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWere you looking for opportunities to go abroad?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, we were all looking for opportunities at that time.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo it was known that you would like to go. Did Tomonaga and Yukawa know that you wanted to go?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh they knew it, probably they knew it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nYou were telling us about going to the Institute.\n\nNambu:\n\nAs I recall, everybody really wanted to go abroad for a while, actually. Some kind of summer school was operated at MIT, and I wanted to spend some there, and I also applied for that as Hayakawa did, and he got the job. Well, actually he was working under Tomonaga on cosmic rays so Rossi had more interest in him. That was maybe part of the reason. So he went there and I had to stay home, but he communicated with us all the time. I was fortunate enough to go to Princeton after that. But then the other guys in my group, Yamaguchi came to America as a post-doc too, he came to the University of Illinois where Jeff Chew and Francis Low were. So they were very active in Illinois. Then Nishijima and Nakano discovered the law relating charge isospin and strangeness that came out after I moved to Princeton where I learned the same thing from Gell-Mann. So the three names got attached to the law. Because of that, Nishijima was invited to Heisenberg, Germany, and eventually from there he moved to America and was a professor at the University of Illinois for a while before he moved back to Japan. Nakano also spent a year at Princeton sometime later. So all the people eventually came out to America, at least for a limited period of time.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo in ’52 you go to Princeton, and when did you get the letter inviting you? Was it right before you went, or a year before you went?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, maybe a half a year, or a year. I have my letter at home; I don’t think it’s here. Probably a year before.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you take a temporary leave from Osaka and you go to Princeton, but actually there’s several people you meet on the way. There’s some Japanese physicists who reach you when you land on the west coast. Did you know??\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, this guy, Ryokichi Sagane, who met me at Berkeley, was my professor at Tokyo in nuclear physics. And he was working under Nishina on the cyclotron. And actually this guy called Sagane was one of the sons of Nagahoka. And I think he took a liking to me when I was a student at Tokyo, and I became rather close to him. He was actually sent by Nishina in the 1930s to work under Lawrence to learn the cyclotron technology.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIn the 1930s. And he stayed?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, stayed for quite a while, and Lawrence was very helpful, and he gave him the same design as his own cyclotron. He brought it back to Nishina and Nishina built the cyclotron. A couple of cyclotrons, actually.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo Sagana returned to Japan?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, but after the war he was again Berkeley, spent a few years there, and I met him there. And he brought from Japan a kind of magnetic spectrometer to measure electron energies. It was invented or designed by another person in Tokyo. Also, one of my roommates in Tokyo, Iwata, who taught me various things, also helped the calculations for the guy.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhich guy?\n\nNambu:\n\nThe spectrometer was developed by, I think, Hideo Aoki and it was called SOS: Spiral Orbit Spectrometer. It had 360 degrees acceptance.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo were there more than one Japanese physicist in the United States that you were communicating with?\n\nNambu:\n\nMore than one, yes. So this guy Sagane was very kind, and he met me at Berkeley and introduced me to Lawrence and other people there. Also, there was another professor not in the Physics Department in Tokyo, I guess maybe it was the Engineering School of the University of Tokyo, by the name of Satosi Watanabe. He was a theorist who studied under DeBroglie and Heisenberg both. He was the sone of an aristocrat who served in the Imperial Court. He had a German wife, and she didn’t feel quite comfortable living in Japan after the war, so eventually both moved to America. And this guy Watanabe was a close friend of Taketani’s, although they had philosophies completely opposite. Anyway, they were very good friends. So I got to know both of them in Tokyo, and he was also kind to me, and when I was invited to Princeton, I think I had to get a written recommendation and I went to Watanabe, and he very kindly wrote a letter for me.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhere was Watanabe then?\n\nNambu:\n\nWatanabe at that time was living in Tokyo. Then he moved to California after that, and he was teaching at the naval post-graduate school in Monterey, California. So I met him there. And maybe that’s a bit out of the point, but he later moved to the IBM laboratory at Poughkeepsie and after that, became a professor at the University of Hawaii, and then after that he moved back to Japan.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo in these two years, when you first arrived at Princeton, were there a network of Japanese scientists?\n\nNambu:\n\nNetwork, yes, a very small number: Sagana, Watanabe. Other physicists, there weren’t any that I knew. Though my generation of people came here, around the same time.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut there was not a network of Japanese physicists that received...\n\nNambu:\n\nNot of physicists, but I got to know some Japanese mathematicians at Princeton. One of them, the famous Kunihiko Kodaira, he was an associate professor at Princeton University. He was a bit senior to me at Tokyo by three or four years. He had studied both physics and mathematics and got the famous Field medal. So he was one of the mathematicians I got to know.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo when you got to Princeton, Dyson was there, and he’s teaching Feynman diagrams to everybody? Is that right?\n\nNambu:\n\nI don’t know if he was teaching there. I mean he wasn’t [overlapping voices]\n\nAshrafi:\n\nNo, I mean informally.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, yes. I first met him not in Princeton, maybe at Cornell.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhen was that? Oh, he was on leave for a year.\n\nNambu:\n\nMaybe. Maybe that’s why.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIs that right? Was Rohrlich there?\n\nNambu:\n\nRohrlich, no, not Rohrlich was— Let me see. I first met him, where was it? I remember he was in Iowa, but I distinctly remember meeting Dyson together with Kinoshita on Christmastime. So we stayed at his home, and he took us out to the mountains to get a Christmas tree.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWow, where?\n\nNambu:\n\nNear Cornell, at Ithaca. But so in Princeton there were Dyson, Frank Yang, and T.D. Lee. Einstein of course. And then Pais. Another member I remember was George Placzek. I have to add that Pauli was also there for a year.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut in some of your recollections it’s both positive and negative.\n\nNambu:\n\nBoth.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nCan you tell me more? There’s some period where you don’t publish, from ’52 to ’55.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Actually I published one paper with Kinoshita. Well, maybe I took the wrong subject to study which was to understand the saturation properties of nuclear forces, and the origin of the spin orbit coupling, and they were two unsolved problems at that time, and it was because of my inherent interest in many-body physics. The paper I wrote with Kinoshita was a generalization of the Bohm-Pines theory which I intended to apply to these problems.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo tell me what the relationship is between these three fields. Can you tell me what the saturation problem, for example, is?\n\nNambu:\n\nThe saturation problem is that nuclear physics means the physics of the binding of the nuclei, but if you have only attractive forces, eventually they’ll collapse in. But the nuclear density is a constant that saturates at certain density. And this was an unsolved problem at that time, and I wanted to understand that in terms of the new theoretical treatment started by Bohm-Pines. And at the same time as this saturation problem, also the spin-orbit coupling was an important element of the nuclear shell model. Where did it come from? A force that is rather large and of opposite sign to that of the electrons in atomic physics. So I tried to understand them, and also that was to be solved in terms of the theoretical formulation, the precise formulation of the Yukawa meson theory. Eventually it was to be solved in terms of new particles. I tried very hard at it, and I got very, very frustrated, but I couldn’t make any progress.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you were working on two separate problems?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, the two were tied together in the nuclear physics program, not the particle physics. I should probably have considered following up on that V particle. Eventually it was solved by Gell-Mann and Nishijma as I have said. But I got really frustrated during the two years I was there. And also I didn’t quite like the atmosphere of Princeton. It was kind of a fierce competition.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOther people have said that.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. Yes, I heard of the same story from other people, too.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut before you went, or after?\n\nNambu:\n\nAfter.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo it was very different from the environment in Tomonaga’s seminar, for example?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, he was a very relaxed person. And also when I moved to Osaka City, there was nobody to compete against.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo how did this competitiveness manifest itself? What was it that made you uncomfortable?\n\nNambu:\n\nBasically I had a feeling that other people were much better than I. And besides, I was not able to make progress on my project, so that compounded it. I felt very inferior.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nCan you describe to me what your life was like while you were at the IAS?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, first the living conditions were like paradise compared to Japan. My wife and I and our little son, about two years old, came and joined me after one year. And she felt the same way that it was a kind of real paradise. Because it was a very small close-knit community, and living in the housing project, and there were several Japanese who would come together. There were two or three mathematicians and Kinoshita, and also the young guys from Europe, and we became very close. So as far as she was concerned, she was very happy. Because when I was in Japan, especially in Tokyo, well even after we moved to Osaka we did not have our own house to live in. So it felt like paradise. The same feeling was also expressed by Tomonaga earlier when he went there and he wrote us back. He said he was sort of exiled in paradise. Because he went alone there; he did not have a car, he did not know how to drive, and so he was sort of exiled at Princeton.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo who did you talk to when you were there?\n\nNambu:\n\nI talked to a number of people, actually. A lot of the younger people I talked to, oh, half a dozen or more. C.N. Yang, T.D. Lee, Nicolas van Kampen, Robert Jastrow, Gunnar Källen, Walter Thirring, Boris Jacobson. Laurie Brown was also one of them. And van Kampen and Jastrow were my driving instructors.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo was there a particular way that your work changed because of these conversations? Was there something you learned? Did you learn new methods or new topics?\n\nNambu:\n\nNot really in terms of new methods, but I think I had to adjust to the new kind of life; speaking English, for one thing. And of course the customs are different in this country than in Japan, so I had to learn those things. Also I was fascinated by meeting with famous names, not just in Princeton but meeting in other places. The Rochester Conferences started around that time, so I was fortunate enough to be one of the few who were invited. Oppenheimer took me and a few others with him to Rochester.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid the new environment distract from your work, adapting to the new environment? So in Osaka and Tokyo you worked all the time, apparently. Was it the same in Princeton?\n\nNambu:\n\nIt was.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut not much progress this time.\n\nNambu:\n\nNot much progress, no.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd the first year you went to Caltech in the summer to try some experimental work.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. In Princeton, they paid the salary only for nine months, and in the summertime you were free to go anyplace. Oppenheimer kindly arranged for Kinoshita and me to go to Caltech with the money that was left by Yukawa because there was a limit to the amount he could receive. And so we did. And at first at that time I was actually concerned with the arrival of my wife and son in Los Angeles. So we stayed three months or so there and got to know people at Caltech. And also I tried to join an experimental group. I was declined, but at least I was able to do a phase shift analysis of the photo-pion production data and published a preprint. If I remember correctly, the results favored electric quadrupole as opposed to magnetic dipole, but the latter turned out to be the case later.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo were you seriously thinking about doing experimental work?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, yeah, that was the influence again of Taketani. Because around that time there was no Japanese experimental physics to speak of, especially after the war due to the poor condition. But he encouraged us to learn experimental physics as much as possible, learn experiments. He didn’t say to do experiments ourselves. So that was in my mind.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nHe was quite an influence on you, apparently.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, that’s right.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWere you still in communication with him?\n\nNambu:\n\nHe died a few years ago.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh no, I meant when you were in Princeton.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh. No, not at all.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut he’d already influenced you.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWere you in much communication with your Japanese colleagues?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nIn the same way?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. I would write a report to my group in Osaka about what I learned in America. I kept doing that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd what did you write about, what were you learning?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, my impression of people, for example, and some news that I heard. For example, I learned of Murray Gell-Mann’s work on the Gell-Mann-Nishima law. And I was very excited, and right away I wrote back to Osaka people. Then Hayakawa had gone back to Osaka at that time, he wrote me back right away that Nishijima and Nakano were working with the same kind of ideas.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd then you go back for the second year to Princeton, and it’s not more productive than the first.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you still don’t find the atmosphere conducive?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, the second year I think was especially depressing.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBecause of the work?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, because of the work. And fortunately I was saved by Goldberger to come to Chicago.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut first you went to Wisconsin?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, that was just summertime. For three months. Robert Sachs, the chairman of the physics department invited me to come to his summer institute.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhen did you learn you were coming to Chicago?\n\nNambu:\n\nWell, actually it was during my second year of my stay at Princeton. I really did not want to go back to Osaka right away. Also, as I said it was a two-year leave, and I had promised them that I would come back. But I didn’t want to go back to the same miserable living conditions; that was my main problem. And I wanted some more work, because I was not able to do good work at Princeton maybe I should try some elsewhere.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid your wife agree with the decision to try to stay?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, of course. Particularly she was so happy in Princeton.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid you ever have any difficulty as a Japanese person in these early years?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes, of course, in those days, from prejudice and things like this, yes, although not really explicitly, not at all. But certainly not among physicists. When we moved to Chicago we had a little difficulty finding an apartment. Well, nothing overt, but when I looked for an apartment, they claimed that there was no room. That happened a couple of times before I found one.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you must’ve left a positive impression at Princeton despite your lack of productivity if Golberger invited you here. Do you know how that happened?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I don’t quite remember, but of course I met Golberger either at Princeton first, because naturally he would travel around, or I met him in conferences. When I first came to the States first I landed in San Francisco and went to Berkeley. Kinoshita and I took a train together across the continent, and our first stop after that was in Colorado, cosmic ray labs at Echo Lake and Mt. Evans lab because of our interest, or my interest anyway. Because of my work on V particles, I had some connection there. Then we stopped in Chicago. We wanted to visit Marcel Schein, the famous cosmic ray physicist. But he wasn’t there at the time, but anyway we visited his lab. And then we went on to Rochester to see Bob Marshak, he was also in cosmic theory. And then we stopped at Cornell, and then finally I came to Princeton. So I had already made acquaintances. When I was in Princeton, I got invited by David Pines because of my interest in Bohm-Pines’ theory.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nNow how did he know of your interest?\n\nNambu:\n\nI think we were in communication with each other already in Japan.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd where was he at the time?\n\nNambu:\n\nThe University of Illinois. He is still there.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nHe was already there?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, he was already there. And he wanted me to come and give a talk about my theory. I had only one paper that I published in Princeton with Kinoshita.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nThis is on the electro-magnetic “Properties of Mesons.”\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh, ’50, sorry. “Collective Description of Many Particle Systems”?\n\nNambu:\n\nThat’s right, I think so.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo that’s published ’54. Okay, so you did it ’52 to ’54. So you talked about this with Pines.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. I also met many other famous people. Bardeen, Pines, Fred Seitz, Nordsieck and a few other people.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOkay, and was Golberger there?\n\nNambu:\n\nGolberger was in Chicago. I have not finished the story yet. So on the way I also stopped at Chicago again and met Gregor Wentzel. He was really kind, and he invited me a party at his house. And I think I met Goldberger there too. That is how it started, I think. And they liked me, apparently. That is how I was able to get invited to come to Chicago.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo after your official stay in Princeton ended, you stayed on. And you stayed at the IAS. Where did you stay?\n\nNambu:\n\nJust after I ended my two years there, I moved to Chicago.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOh, so did you do a search?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh I did a little bit of search, yes, for positions. Fortunately there was one possibility with the help of Abe Klein. He was a student of Schwinger and did Lamb shift calculations. He tried to find a job for me, and there was a possibility at Yale with Gregory Breit. Because of my interest in the nuclear force problem, my work on nuclear potentials, apparently he took an interest in me. But unfortunately he did not have the money to hire me. Then came the offer from Goldberger.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOkay, you just finished saying that one possibility was at Yale with Breit, but they didn’t have any money. And that came through Klein, that possibility at Yale?\n\nNambu:\n\nI don’t remember. He went to Yale, Klein himself? I don’t know. No, Klein was my friend. We met in conferences. He tried to help me find a job. And I think probably he told me that there was a possibility at Yale, but unfortunately that did not materialize.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd was he inquiring on your behalf?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I think so. Probably I wrote a letter to Breit, and he answered that there was no money. But I am not positive.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDid he inquire at Chicago?\n\nNambu:\n\nThat I don’t know. Probably not. I have to add another story here. It was before the Chicago offer. At Princeton I made good friends with Boris Jacobson. He was on leave from the University of Washington. Once we took a long walk. He was in search of a project, and I suggested a problem for him to work out. Then one day he took me out again for another walk and s tarted to ask me if I was interested in a tenure position at Seattle. I asked back, “a ten year position?” He smiled and explained to me what tenure meant. I was not familiar with the American system, so I was not overly impressed. Then Oppy also urged me to go to Seattle. Obviously it was his idea. I believe the boss at Seattle was his student. I am sorry I have forgotten the name. But at that time I had an impression that Seattle was a remote corner of America, far from the centers of physics; I would be better off going back to Osaka. So I ended up declining it. Later when I visited Seattle, I learned that Boris had proposed to hire me even foregoing the possibility of his own promotion. I was very moved. He was promoted after all, but I am sorry he died rather young. I hope my memory is correct.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut one way or another, an offer came from Chicago and you came to Chicago.\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes, that was my good luck. [Lunch Break]\n\nAshrafi:\n\nOkay, we’re back from lunch. Would you mind putting on the tape your story of visiting Oppenheimer that you told me at lunch?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh yes. Visiting him is one of the stories I can tell you. When I arrived at Princeton, he held a party for the newcomers. I stayed there for two years. So at the first party, I remember Oppy introducing me to Cecile Morette-deWitt, because she was with a baby. I met several new people there. The second year there was a party, and by that time my family was there, so I took my wife with me. We went to this house, and I remember there was a huge Van Gogh, The Sunflower, one of the famous paintings that you could find in art books. It was there, and there was also a small Renoir, so I was totally impressed. My wife almost started to say, “Is it genuine?” or something, “Authentic?” [laughs] So I was really embarrassed and I kicked her shin. Of course he comes from a wealthy family; the Oppenheimer family was in the clothing business or something like that. Later I found that there was at Princeton, a department store called Oppenheimer’s. So he belonged to that line of people, no doubt that he was a very wealthy person. I understood that his family had a ranch in Los Alamos which he used to build his laboratories. That kind of thing I learned and remembered reading in Time magazine when I was in Japan. But anyway, Oppenheimer was a very sort of? Ah, I was scared of him, as I told you, to talk to him, to tell him about what I was doing there. I had to make an appointment three days in advance and I had to go through three checkpoints because at that time he had secret documents with him and an FBI agent was guarding them all the time. So I passed this guy and then two more secretaries in two different rooms, and finally I reached his office. And he seemed to be reading pre-prints all the time, and so he was conversant with any topic even though he did not understand or appreciate it in a deep sense. Superficially he seemed to know everything, so he could make comments about anything. I get in his office, and I started telling him what I would like to discuss with him. I search my words, and before I could open my mouth he says exactly what I was going to say, so that it really scared me off. After a discussion for a few minutes he just says, “That’s enough,” and shows me the door, and encourages me to keep on doing my work. That was it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo altogether not a very friendly encouraging place.\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, not an encouraging place.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo you came to Chicago, but the summer before you came to Chicago you spent in Wisconsin?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, before arriving in Chicago I spent three months in Madison at the University of Wisconsin. Robert Sachs, he passed away several years ago at Chicago, but he was the chairman there and he was organizing a summer institute every summer at that time. I was invited to spend the summer there, and it was a very nice experience, especially because you were with all the big names like Eugene Wigner. Wigner used to be at Wisconsin for a while before going to Princeton because he was not considered good enough for Princeton the first time. Then he did work on the Wigner crystal. That made him good enough and he got back to Princeton. I was also told that Gregory Breit was there once. There was a boat that he had left, which we would ride on Lake Mendota.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhat was the topic of that summer institute?\n\nNambu:\n\nOh, just general high energy physics. Rochester conferences were on high energy physics, so I met there many younger people who also came to Madison summer institute. I kept on attending it three or four times after that.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo then you came to Chicago.\n\nNambu:\n\nThen I came to Chicago.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd from your recollections that you’ve written elsewhere, it was a very different atmosphere.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. It was very different, and I liked it right away—the atmosphere, not the city of Chicago—because it was a very close-knit type of institute and faculty. There were rather small numbers there at that time, so everybody was treated like a family member. I could talk to everybody freely, and every week on Thursday afternoon there was so-called institute seminar, I don't know what was it’s official name, but people spontaneously got together on the fourth floor, Room 480, and talked about anything you had on your mind. Fermi was naturally the leader, he was a master of that kind of thing, I was told, but I came too late to witness it because he died three months after my arrival. There were people like Maria Mayer and her husband Joe Mayer. Joe Mayer sort of served as the chairman of that session. But people usually called that a Quaker meeting, and everybody was encouraged to speak up. It was really fascinating because there were not only physicists but chemists and geologists and they talked about their own things.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo what was your position? You were research?\n\nNambu:\n\nI was a research associate at that time on leave from Osaka.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you get any reaction from the Osaka people for not going back there?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, but at the time a few years’ extension was considered a sort of natural thing.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you continued the same line of research?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, actually I switched fields more or less because I was depressed that I had not made any progress on the program in nuclear physics. But Golberger had started his dispersion theory, and so Chicago was the center of dispersion theory. It was started by a paper by Golberger and Murray Gell-Mann and Walter Thirring when they were all on the East coast.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo did you consciously decide to switch fields?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I got more interested in the mathematics of it.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nBut you got interested in it because it’s being done here?\n\nNambu:\n\nNo, it just happened that he was doing it here, and I was supposed to work under Golberger more or less, being a post-doc. I was fascinated by the mathematics of the dispersion theory. So I spent a few years studying it, and there was a post-doc also, Reinhard Oehme, a student of Heisenberg. He is still here. And Miazawa, I think I mentioned his name before in connection with the discovery of the delta resonance. Both Oehme and Miyazawa arrived just a year before me. We were all involved in this dispersion theory more or less.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd Kinoshita?\n\nNambu:\n\nKinoshita went from Princeton to Columbia as a post-doc and stayed for a few years and then he moved to Cornell.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd he stayed at Cornell.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo if I look at from ’55, ’56, it’s Green’s function, renormalization, dispersion relations, lots of dispersion relations, at least until 1960.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, I think so.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd here you were working with the other faculty?\n\nNambu:\n\nMainly with Golberger.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nWhere was Chew at that time?\n\nNambu:\n\nChew was in Illinois. Chew and Low both were at University of Illinois.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nSo after two years you become associate professor.\n\nNambu:\n\nYes.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nDo you start teaching at that point?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes. The first course was Statistical Mechanics.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you teach undergraduate or graduate?\n\nNambu:\n\nGraduate, all graduate courses.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd did you then teach the whole spectrum of courses?\n\nNambu:\n\nYes, more or less. We all rotated teaching assignments. So quantum mechanics, electrodynamics and nuclear physics. Particle physics, I don’t know if there was that course there at that time, many of the advanced courses I taught.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAt what point did you start getting involved in graduate dissertations?\n\nNambu:\n\nRight away when I became associate professor. Golberger at that time left Chicago to go to Princeton, so he left his students. I took some of his students to finish them up.\n\nAshrafi:\n\nAnd you said you had a list of your students"
