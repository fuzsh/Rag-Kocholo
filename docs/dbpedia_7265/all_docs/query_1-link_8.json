        "text": "The origin of the present Department of Physics, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University was founded in April, 1939 when Nagoya Imperial University was inaugurated as Japan's ninth Imperial University. In May, 1940 the School started as the School of Science and Engineering and in April, 1942 it was split into two schools, namely, the School of Science and the School of Engineering. The School of Science consisted of four departments: the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. The Department of Physics initially had three KOZAs. KOZA (講座) is a Japanese word literally meaning \"lecture chair\" and in its full scale, it consisted of a full professor (KYOJU, 教授), an assistant professor (JOKYOJU, 助教授), and two research associates (JOSHU, 助手). A KOZA constituted the minimal set of research groups under the strong leadership of the full professors. The number of KOZAs in the Department of Physics was increased to four in October, 1942, and to five in November, 1943. Since then the Department had had five KOZAs until 1958, when another KOZA was added.\n\nThe first full professors, after the five KOZAs were established in 1943, were Naomi MIYABE (geophysics), Kanetaka ARIYAMA (condensed matter physics theory), Ryozi UYEDA (condensed matter physics experiment), Shoichi SAKATA (elementary particle physics theory), and Yataro SEKIDO (cosmic ray physics). The Department of Physics with five KOZAs thus had about twenty faculty members, and including technical staffs, it had about 30 faculty and staff members. The number of undergraduate students was 20 per year, and the number of graduate students per year was about two to five. The Imperial University education consisted of three years for undergraduate students and several additional years for graduate students. Hence, the total number of physics students was about 60 to 70 altogether.\n\nIt was in the middle of World War II, and the Department of Physics had to suffer from various war-time disasters. For instance, Assistant Professor (JOKYOJU) Goro HAYAKAWA (optics) was killed in Tokyo on March 10, 1945, when Tokyo was systematically destroyed by the American air raids and bombing (carpet bombing). (Assistant Professor Goro HAYAKAWA's position was later taken by full Professor Yataro SEKIDO.) The City of Nagoya was not free from war disasters, either. On March 25, 1945, one of the students in the Physics Department died from a bomb, as one of thousands of citizen casualties. Seeing this, the Department of Physics immediately decided to evacuate into safer rural areas of Japan such as Komoro (experimental groups) and Fujimi (theoretical groups) in Shinshu Region (mostly in present Nagano Prefecture). The entire Physics Department of about 100 members moved to these safer areas. The Physics Department rented an elementary school, public library, Buddhist temples, and warehouses of local business, and turned them into classrooms, laboratory rooms, office rooms, etc. It also rented rooms for housing and boarding. The faculty, staff, and student members thus spent several months of \"summer camp\"-like endeavors together until the end of the War in August, 1945 (actually, this evacuation lasted from April to around October, 1945). Despite hunger (due to lack of food) and various inconveniences due to war-time shortages of everything, everyone was very enthusiastic about research, teaching, and learning. One emeritus professor (Fumio OOSAWA) recalled the time and told us that he \"enjoyed\" a book-reading class of Dirac's quantum mechanics textbook with students in the warehouse classroom. He said that many were suffering from hunger and malnutrition so that if a finger got a small cut during physics experiments, it took a long time to heal.\n\nAfter the War, the Department of Physics came back to Nagoya only to find that many parts of the City of Nagoya were destroyed. Hence, they had to restart everything from scratch despite severe shortage of everything including food, clothes, laboratory equipment, etc. However, everyone knew that he/she can finally concentrate on physics research and so was very enthusiastic and optimistic about the new start. Led by Professor Shoichi SAKATA, the Department of Physics introduced the Charter of Physics Department on June 13, 1946, in which democracy was placed to be the guiding principle of Department affairs. Before this, physics research was conducted by KOZAs, which were hierarchically controlled by full professors. Instead of KOZAs, Research Groups were created with members with common research interests, where Research Groups could be easily created or reformed, following the members' wishes. The first Research Groups were: D Lab (electron diffraction), E Lab (elementary particle), G Lab (geophysics), H Lab (cosmic ray), K Lab (colloid), M Lab (ferromagnetism), and S Lab (super conductivity). Note that the number of Research Groups was seven and more than five, which was the number of full professors.\n\nThe Charter claims that as far as physics research is concerned, all the faculty members and students should be treated equal. For example, it was encouraged to address each other by \"SAN.\" By calling a professor \"Name SAN\" instead of \"Professor Name,\" students could feel no hierarchy in research. This is still encouraged in many Research Groups at present. This encouraged especially younger members of the Department to be responsible and actively participate in discussions of physics research. This idealism for academic democracy and freedom was then never even conceived elsewhere in Japanese universities not to mention the Japanese Ministry of Education. It was thus installed as an unofficial Charter without the approval of the Ministry of Education, and even today it remains to be an internal agreement of the Department. Soon after the Charter was announced, several physics departments in other Japanese universities introduced similar systems, but the number of such departments remained small, considering the radicalness and pure idealistic nature of the Charter.\n\nIn 2007 the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology finally realized that KOZA in which full professors controlled everything had serious drawbacks and it changed the titles of assistant professor (JOKYOJU) and research associate (JOSHU) to associate professor (JUNKYOJU, 准教授) and assistant professor (JOKYO, 助教), respectively, in order to encourage their academic independence from the KOZA systems. Hence, the Department of Physics of Nagoya University was indeed 60 years ahead of the time. We believe that this philosophy of academic democracy and freedom indeed played an important role as a cradle for many original and innovative research results and great physicists that came from the Department of Physics. One clear such example is the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics that was awarded to two of Professor SAKATA's students, Professors Makoto KOBAYASHI and Toshihide MASKAWA .\n\nThrough many decades since its creation, the Department of Physics has grown to have about 70 regular faculty members (full professors, associate professors, lecturers, and assistant professors), about 10 technical and administrative staffs, and about 600 undergraduate and graduate students. The present curriculum consists of four years of undergraduate education, two years of graduate education for Master of Science degrees, and three more years of graduate education for Ph.D. degrees. The Department currently has about 25 Research Groups that are actively engaged in all four major fields of physics, namely, astrophysics, elementary particle physics, condensed matter physics, and biophysics. The Department has very active Research Groups in the elementary particle physics and condensed matter physics fields, which are two major fields of physics found in most universities in Japan. The Department also has one of the largest and strongest Research Groups in astrophysics field and in biophysics field, while many other physics departments in Japanese universities have only a small number, if not zero, of researchers in these two emerging fields.\n\nThere are many famous and great physicists who passed through the Department of Physics as professors and students. In the following, we list such notable figures."
