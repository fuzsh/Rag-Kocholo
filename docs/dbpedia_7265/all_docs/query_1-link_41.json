        "text": "Debbie Ng Kazama, Jason Kazama and family with their new Toyota Highlander\n\nIn February, a 2018 Limited Edition Toyota Highlander Hybrid was delivered to the winners of the 2017 Terasaki Budokan Toyota Raffle. Debbie Ng Kazama and Jason Kazama of West Covina had the winning raffle ticket, which was purchased for them by Jason’s mother. Jason and Debbie were not aware of the raffle ticket purchase, so winning the Highlander came as a complete surprise.\n\nThe Terasaki Budokan Toyota Raffle is an annual fundraiser supporting LTSC’s effort to build the multipurpose sports and community center Paul I. Terasaki Budokan.\n\nThank you to Toyota USA for donating the Highlander Hybrid and to all the 501(c)(3) organizations that participated in our raffle. If you want to be part of this year’s Toyota Raffle, your nonprofit organization can earn $4 for every $10 ticket sold.\n\nPlease contact the Budokan team if your organization wants to participate.\n\nFrom left: former LTSC Board of Directors President Debra Nakatomi, President Dick Kaku, Kira Teshima, Keith Terasaki, Lisa Hasegawa and Kelsey Iino\n\nLTSC is pleased to announce a new president for its board of directors and the addition of four new board members. The LTSC Board provides oversight and leadership for LTSC, as the organization promotes “positive change for people and places.” Dick Kaku will serve as LTSC’s board president. The new members are: Lisa Hasegawa, Kelsey Iino, Kira Teshima and Keith Terasaki.\n\nClick New Board President and Members to read the full announcement.\n\nSusu Attar, Dan Kwong, Tina Takemoto and Kuniharu Yoshida\n\nLTSC announced the artists selected for its inaugural +LAB Artist Residency Program in Little Tokyo. These California-based artists were awarded three-month community based residencies from over a hundred applicants.\n\nThe Inaugural +LAB Artist Residency Program Fellows are:\n\nSusu Attar, Visual Artist, Los Angeles\n\nDan Kwong, Performance Artist, Los Angeles\n\nTina Takemoto, Visual Artist, Daly City\n\nKuniharu Yoshida, Traditional Artist, Torrance\n\nThe four Artist Fellows were chosen from a talented pool of candidates in an open call by a panel of professionals from the Little Tokyo community and the program’s partner organizations.\n\nClick Artist Fellows to read the full press release.\n\nAlan Nishio; Photo: Gann Matsuda/Manzanar Committee\n\nLongtime LTSC board member and Board of Governors Chair Alan Nishio delivered a powerful keynote address at the annual Los Angeles Day of Remembrance program in February. The annual event gathers members of the community to reflect on the enduring legacy of Executive Order 9066. That directive, signed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942, authorized the forced removal and incarceration of over 120,000 people of Japanese descent during World War II.\n\nThe theme of the 2018 program was “The Civil Liberties Act of 1988: The Victory and the Unfinished Business,” commemorating the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (CLA). The 1988 legislation provided the U.S. government’s official apology and monetary reparations to the survivors of the World War II incarceration.\n\n“We challenged the government on a wrong that was committed and we won,” said Nishio, who was born in Manzanar incarceration camp. Nishio went on to comment on current events, “Twenty years from now we will see 2018 as a turning point in U.S. History … Do we stand silent and remain uninvolved as our country moves to increasing authoritarianism or do we stand up and join with others to affirm the principles of democracy and due process?”\n\nCalifornia State Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi also addressed the crowd, along with other distinguished community speakers.\n\nClick Rafu Shimpo for coverage of the event.\n\nSeniors at LTSC’s South Bay satellite office\n\nThe South Bay region of Los Angeles County has a significant number of Japanese American and Japanese-speaking older adults that are underserved and in need of bilingual social services. To meet this need, LTSC opened a satellite office located at the Gardena Valley Japanese Cultural Institute in the spring of 2016. Recently, LTSC received a grant from Keiro to expand services at the office in order to reach more people with more comprehensive services, including needs assessments, care management and mental health services.\n\nKeiro is expanding its reach to broadly engage and support Japanese American and Japanese older adults wherever they call home. Serving primarily Los Angeles, Orange, and Ventura counties, Keiro provides services to older adults and caregivers, along with programs for residents of Keiro’s former facilities. For more information, visit Keiro’s website.\n\nLTSC would like to thank Keiro for its support of our South Bay satellite office and helping us provide seniors with the best possible quality of life and to maintain independent living through accessible bilingual, bicultural social services, caregiver support and opportunities for socialization."
