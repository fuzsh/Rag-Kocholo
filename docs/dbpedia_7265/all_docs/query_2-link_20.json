It has since annually recognized one or more Japanese researchers who have made outstanding achievements in the field of basic and applied atomic and sub-atomic physics.\n\nProfessor Shibata, who directs the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, won the award for his \"study of binary neutron star mergers by numerical relativity simulations\", while Professor Tanaka, an adjunct principal investigator at the KyotoU Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (iCeMS), was cited for his \"development of extreme-nonlinear terahertz optics in solids\".\n\nRelates links\n\nNishina Memorial Foundation: Nishina Memorial Prize\n\nhttp://www.nishina-mf.or.jp/NishinaMemorialPrize-E.html"
