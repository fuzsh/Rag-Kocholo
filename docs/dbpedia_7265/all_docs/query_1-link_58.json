        "text": "The Years Between World Wars, 1921-1937\n\nDuring the years between World Wars, under the leadership of Ministers Soga, Itakura, and Yamanaka, the Hakalau Jodo Mission continued to grow and support the community through the Japanese Language School and Church. In the 1920's, Japanese language schools across the Territory came under attack in during a surge of \"America First\" mentality that began during World War I. This started with the Federal Commission on Education noting that Hawaii had 163 Japanese language schools educating nearly 20,000 students. The sentiment among haoles in the early 1920's was that such education was detrimental to the health of Nisei children and their progress in American schools was retarded and their loyalty to the United States was confused and neglected. Japanese immigrants felt that continuation of the Japanese language schools was essential:\n\nUneasy parents saw their offspring becoming cultural hybrids in Hawaii without knowledge of Japanese culture or language; they felt their children needed a proper Japanese education. After all, the possibility still existed, no matter how remote, that the family would one day leave Hawaii and return to Japan. Other Japanese spoke in support of the language schools because of a belief that such institutions were valuable for the Americanization process. (Source: Dennis M. Ogawa, Kodomo no tame ni: For the sake of the children, The University of Hawaii Press, 1978, p. 142-143)\n\nA compromise position between the Federal Commission’s recommendations and the concerns of the Japanese community was the Irwin Bill (1920) which required that language school teachers receive a permit from the Department of Public Instruction and pledge to teach nothing which would contradict American ideals or institutions. Over the next few years, a tax and additional restrictions were placed on Japanese language schools. Finally, Frederick Kinzaburo Makino, editor of the Hawaii Hochi, contested the language school control bill in the courts...and won:\n\nIn an unexpected maneuver, the defenders of the language schools in 1925 took the litigation out of the Territorial courts and filed in the United States District Court. After legal battles and appeals, the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision on February 21, 1927, which struck down the Territorial Legislature’s language school control laws as unconstitutional. The decision was based fundamentally on the fact that the “Japanese parent has the right to direct his own child without unreasonable restriction” and that the Territorial laws sought to control the schools “for no adequate reason. (Source: Dennis M. Ogawa, Kodomo no tame ni: For the sake of the children, The University of Hawaii Press, 1978, p. 146)\n\n​1920-1921: A period of maintenance for the Hakalau Jodo Mission Under Minister Soga Tetsuzui\n\n​1921-1929: A New Japanese Language School Built and the Fujinkai (Ladies' Association) and Sunday School Launched Under Minister Itakura Ryokai\n\nThe new building for the Japanese Language School was erected in 1927.\n\nThis photo hangs in the temple at the current Hakalau Jodo Mission, probably around 1934 just before the old Japanese Language School was demolished. Rev. Yamanaka sits in the front row directly in line with the center of the steps. The building on the left, constructed in 1927, was the new Japanese Language School. Later it became the plantation personnel office (later the ILWU office) and as well as the the Japanese language school and also served as the aikido studio.

He was appointed to be the resident minister on August 26, 1929. During his time he demolished the old building and newly built the existing two story church (with Social Hall downstairs) and a new minister’s residence building, which are the currently existing buildings.\n\nHe resigned in April 1937 and went home to Japan.\n\n​During Seventh Minister Yamanaka's time in Hakalau, The Light on the Ocean was published, including a description of Hakalau (page 63): ​\n\nThe northeast coast faces the Pacific Ocean and has a train as transportation. It is a base of major sugar cane plantation of 3,500 acres. It has 350 Japanese families. It is a vast land for the mission.\n\nSeventh Minister Ryokai Yamanaka, 1929-1937\n\nThe Reverend Yamanaka\n\nHe was born in Kozutsumi, Shinohara village, Yasu county, Shiga prefecture, became a minister at Hozen-ji temple in Shinohara village in the area. He was initiated on February 23, 1912, registered on March 19th. On November 25, 1925 he was ordained, and on February 10, 1926, he became a minister at Hozen-ji temple in Shinohara village in Shiga prefecture. On August 7, 1928 he became the minister of Hawaii Jodo-shu and was assigned to Hakalau Church. On August 26 of the following year, he was appointed as a resident minister of the church and has worked diligently for the mission.\n\nMrs. Yamanaka\n\nShe was born in Fukui prefecture, graduated from Women’s Teacher School after finishing Fukui prefectural Women’s High School and obtained license as a registered teacher. She was appointed as a Hawaii missionary assistant in 1928. She has been the resident missionary at Hakalau Church since then.\n\nRev.

The section on Hakalau includes pictures of the Japanese Language School and showcases 28 church members and their families. ​\n\nNote: The picture above, dated 1934) shows the temple, dormitory and language school/meeting space in the building to the right. The building to the left also supported the language school and, in addition, in later years continued as the language school and also served as the aikido studio and ILWU office. The current Hakalau Jodo Mission is in about the same place as the building on the right. The building on the left was demolished much later (date to be determined) and only the concrete steps remain.\n\nProminent Church Members and Their Families\n\nTwo of the church members featured in The Light on the Ocean were born in Hawaii, all others immigrated from Japan: 29% from Okinawa, 21% from Yamaguchi, 14% from Kumamoto, and 11% from Wakayama Prefectures. Most immigrated to Hawaii between 1902-1910, although 4 came between 1895-1899. Most arrived in Hawaii age ages between 18-28. ​Learn more about these church members and their families by clicking on the names below:\n\nNote: There can be multiple versions of names translated from kanji. To assist families in identifying their ancestors, below are listed the kanji as presented in the 1934 publication, along with the translation and possible variations.\n\nA decision is made to build a new temple.\n\nIn 1936, Rev. Yamanaka and members of the temple decided to build a new temple, social hall, parsonage, dining hall and community kitchen. When the decision was made to build a new temple (or do something that costs a great deal of money), the Japanese practice was to make a wish, or ganshu, to the Buddha. The ganshu below represents all those making the wish.\n\nGanshu for the new Hakalau Jodo Mission (1936).
