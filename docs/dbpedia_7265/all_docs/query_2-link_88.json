        "text": "The Loomis Confessions: Matthias Grosse Perdekamp\n\nIf you couldn’t be a physicist, what career would you choose?\n\nI considered studying history or politics in Freiburg or Heidelberg. I love learning about international relations, and I am a big admirer of the UN and the EU. If it wasn't for Physics, Urbana and CERN, I might be working in Brussels or Geneva.\n\nWhat is your favorite place?\n\nOutside Loomis? Vermont, the Black Forest and Geneva!\n\nWhat is the greatest scientific blunder in history?\n\nDon't waste your time on regrets over past mistakes!\n\nWho is/are your favorite artist(s) in any medium—painters, composers, authors, filmmakers?\n\nVivaldi at Saint Chapelle, Bach anywhere, Gershwin, Turner, French Impressionists, Rodin.\n\nWho is/are your favorite hero(es) in life or in fiction?\n\nAbraham Lincoln, Marie Curie, French Statesman Robert Schuman, Sophie Scholl of the White Rose.\n\nWho is/are the villain(s) you love to hate?\n\nRobert Oppenheimer, Yoshio Nishina and Werner Heisenberg, principal scientists of WW II nuclear weapon efforts in the US, Japan and Germany.\n\nWhat is your idea of happiness?\n\nI am not sure I know. But then, citing Albert Camus: \"You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.”\n\nWhat is your idea of misery?\n\nPopulism, Corruption, Authoritarianism, War!\n\nWhat quality do you most admire in others?\n\nCourage.\n\nWhat scientific question do you hope will be answered in your lifetime?\n\nIs someone else out there?"
