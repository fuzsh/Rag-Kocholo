The effort centered around Japan's university physics laboratories, and its chief figure was Yoshio Nishina, who was Japan's leading scientist and a physicist of international stature. Much has been written about how the United States and Britain during the war were concerned that the Germans, who had discovered atomic fission in the 1930's, would develop the world's first superbomb based on this principle. Indeed, the German wartime atomic research effort was a major rationale for the Manhattan Project in the United States. But in the case of Japan it seems that no one in the U.S. government took the possibility of a Japanese atomic bomb project seriously. Still more curious is the curtain of silence which the Japanese themselves seem to have pulled over the subject, and which they have kept tightly drawn since the war. Even the Americans who interrogated Nishina concluded that Japan had had no atomic bomb project. Even today in Japan, when historians tell Japanese that there was such a project, many Japanese react with disbelief. Japan's postwar official policy, that she does not and never will seek to be a nuclear-armed country, seems to have inhibited discussion of the project. Japan's wartime atomic research, in Japan, has become a social secret. The effort is documented in two authoritative Japanese histories. One is a history of science and technology in Japan of which volume 13, published in 1970, deals with science and technology during World War II. The second is a social history of science, by Tetu Hirosige, published in 1973, that has an entire chapter devoted to the wartime science mobilization, including among other things, atomic research. Nishina died in 1951 and there is no known account by him of his wartime activities. But there are other firsthand accounts, notably the diary of Masa Takeuchi, a worker at Nishina's laboratory who was assigned to the thermal diffusion project, and a memoir of Bunsabe Arakatsu, a physicist from Kyoto. These materials have been collected independently by Herbert F. York, Jr., director of the Program in Science, Technology and Public Affairs at the University of California at San Diego, and Charles Weiner, professor of history of science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.). Weiner is now completing a full-scale historical study of the subject. It is no surprise that physicists in Japan were tempted, around 1940, to study the military applications of fission. Throughout the 1930's, Japan had kept pace with the exciting developments in physics -- with theory in Europe and experimental techniques in the United States. Nishina spent several years in Copenhagen in the laboratory of Niels Bohr. The Japanese also became schooled in the techniques of the cyclotron, through a small machine built at the Riken, Nishina's laboratory in Tokyo, and by sending a much younger physicist, Ryokichi Sagane, to Berkely to work under E.O. Lawrence. Lawrence arranged for the contribution of a 200-ton magnet for a second cyclotron at the Riken. The cyclotron was not finished until 8 years later, shortly before the war's end. While Japanese physics at the outset of the war was strong enough to carry researchers naturally into the problem of the fission weapon, it was \"too brittle,\" to bring the project to a successful conclusion. Nishina, Sagane, and some others were clearly world class physicists; but Japanese physics included a \"comparatively large number of nonadvanced fields.\" Scientists Suggest Project The scientists themselves initiated atomic bomb research in September 1940. Army sponsorship was arranged, and \"fairly large-scale research\" began at the Riken \"from December, 1940.\" The years 1940 and 1941 were a period of intense military interest in the possibilities of atomic weapons. In 1941, Prime Minister and War Minister Hideki Tojo's order for investigation of the possibilities for a fission weapon were passed on to the Riken. But in the first of what was to be a series of uncoordinated orders to the scientists, the Navy also engaged the Riken's services, and launched an inquiry into the feasibility of the weapon in late 1942. This led to the \"Physics Colloquium,\" a galaxy of Japan's leading scientists who met for ten sessions between December 1942 and March 1943, to investigate the feasibility of Japan's achieving a weapon. The Colloquium's conclusion, relayed to the Navy in March 1943, was that an atomic bomb would be impossible \"even\" for the United States for the current war. Another account says that it estimated Japan would need \"ten years\" to develop such a weapon. So it seems that the scientists viewed the project as extremely long term at best, or, as one of them would later write: \"if not for this war then in time for the next one.\" On the other hand, the military viewed the bombs as something to be pursued immediately, although it often did not back up this commitment with resources. The planners of Pearl Harbor, it is known, assumed that the war in the Pacific would be short, brutal, and brilliant. They believed that America, then being irrevocably drawn into hostilities in Europe, would retreat quickly from fighting on a second front in the Pacific. It is well established that another faction in the Japanese government was restrained and realistic, and probably this element took a wait-and-see attitude, and relegated the problem to the scientists. But the zealots were still there. A new book, Enola Gay*, quotes the physicist Tsunesabo Asada's recollection that discussions of the subject right after Pearl Harbor were characterized by a \"mood of blind patriotism\" and \"promises of generous funding.\" Arakatsu, writing after the war, said he did atomic bomb research to prevent young scientists from being sent to fight and die. Takeuchi, in his diary, which was also compiled after Japan had surrendered, says that he did the research only when ordered, and that other Riken scientists were equally unenthusiastic. However well these rationales suited the postwar climate of opinion, there is evidence that the actual situation was different. At several junctures when the scientists might well have closed down the work altogether -- for they knew better than anyone how great were the odds against success -- they kept the work going. September 1940 had been one such juncture; March 1943 was another. Following the physics colloquium's negative report, the Navy branch that had sponsored it lost interest in the atomic bomb. But Nishina managed to keep the Riken atomic research going. The Army, which had been funding the work since December 1940, became the sole sponsor of Riken atomic research. But this was by no means the beginning of coordination among the military. Just as the Naval Institute of Technology bowed out of support of atomic research in March 1943, another Navy branch, the Fleet Administration Center, was sponsoring another group of researchers at Kyoto University, under Arakatsu, to work toward an atomic bomb. The Kyoto project began in 1942 and was enlarged with a grant of 600,000 yen in 1943. Among other things, the money went to construct a cyclotron at Kyoto university. But the military's commitment to the work -- however strong in spirit -- was not backed up with material aid. Takeuchi's diary also indicates that atomic research at the Riken was anything but coordinated. Takeuchi complains that although he was told to consider the possibility of separating uranium by electromagentic means, Miyamoto, who had developed such a method, had gone to another university. So Takeuchi gave up on electromagnetic separation because he couldn't have Miyamoto around to help. Similarly, although Takeuchi found gaseous thermal diffusion \"the most promising\" method, Eiichi Takeda, who had done small-scale thermal diffusion work using a glass column, was not assigned to the project. So, Takeuchi had to start from scratch. After much delay and red tape the apparatus was ready in a separate building in early 1945. It took Takeuchi 18 months to do this work, whereas physicists in the United States were able to set up comparable or larger experiments in a matter of weeks. In April 1945, as the gaseous thermal diffusion apparatus and the cyclotron were finally working together in an experimental mode, the building housing the apparatus -- but not the cyclotron -- was ruined in the American bomber raids over Toko. The wrecking of their experiment caused the scientists to give up on their atomic research -- that is, until after Hiroshima. After Hiroshima, the government seems to have become interested yet again in having an atomic bomb. According to one account, the morning after the bomb was dropped, Nishina was summoned and asked first whether the bomb could have been atomic and \"whether Japan could have one in six months.\" Nishina was flown over Hiroshima on 8 August. The pattern of destruction and the presence of radiation convinced him the bomb had been an atomic one. Arakatsu reached a similar conclusion when he was flown over the city on 10 August. After Hiroshima, the scientists at the Riken resumed their atomic studies, but with a different goal, namely to learn about the effects of the weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Philip Morrison, now of M.I.T., who served on the Manhattan Project, and arrived in Japan on the first day of the American occupation, recalled what he found when he visited the Japanese scientists. Nishina was \"guarded and self contained ... impassive and almost antagonistic,\" toward the arriving Americans. On the other hand, many other Japanese physicists seemed to welcome the Americans with \"rueful pleasure.\" Morrison recalls that the feelings of internationalism, of a bond among physicists, seemed to reestablish itself between the Americans and Japanese -- with the exception of Nishina. And as for whether Japan had been developing an atomic weapon, he recalls, \"they didn't talk about it and we didn't ask about it much.\" The Riken buildings and laboratories \"looked frayed, unrenovated, starved of attention.\" In places, work had just stopped and people had gone away. \"As we looked around we concluded this could not have been the site of a Japanese Manhattan Project.\" It is not surprising that U.S. scientists visiting Japan who knew firsthand the \"panoply\" of installations and people that was the American Manhattan Project, concluded that the Japanese could not have had a comparable project. So it went in the fall of 1945. Visiting American scientists were sympathetic to Japanese \"colleagues\" and tended to find no evidence of a bomb project. The Japanese were silent to their American military interrogators; thus the military, by and large, also found no evidence of such a project. The Joint Chiefs of Staff ordered on 30 October that all research facilities and equipment \"on atomic energy and related subjects be seized.\" \"No research ... on atomic energy shall be permitted in Japan.\" On 24 to 26 November 1945, on orders from General Groves' office, which oversaw the Manhatttan Project, American military teams proceeded to hack Japan's five cyclotrons, including the two at Riken, to pieces. The remains were dumped into the sea. In the furor which arose in the United States, scientists' and citizens' groups protested to the Secretary of War. For the most part they were told that the destruction order had been a mistake. But this confession of error only whetted the appetites of many of the scientists, who had now become embroiled in a fight for future civilian control of atomic energy. The destruction of the cyclotrons was used to show how insensitive the military would be to the special needs of science and scientists. Admiral Nakamura \"Talks\" But was the destruction completely mindless? There is a U.S. Army document, dated before the order to destroy the cyclotrons, in which a Rear Admiral Nakamura reports in detail on atomic bomb research conducted during the war at Kyoto University. Among other things, it says that the project included the construction of a cyclotron. So far there is no evidence that the report reached Groves' office. But its existence suggests that some Americans learned of the wartime atomic research and concluded that the cyclotrons should be destroyed. On 31 December when Lee DuBridge, director of the M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory, wrote to the acting secretary of war on behalf of the scientific community, suggesting that U.S. scientists restore \"at least Dr. Nishina's 60-inch [cyclotron]\" in view of the great loss to physics and the world, Acting Secretary of War Kenneth C. Royall replied: It is unsound to intimate that scientists are citizens of the world alone, are internationalist and not loyal to their native lands and are never willing participants in the ambitions of dictators or tyrants. The evidence to the contrary is too overwhelming for the American public to accept this thesis, for modern war is scientific and total war in toto. Without the scientist or the technical worker the terrible instruments of destruction of the present day would not have been possible. In the interests of the country and of the American scientists themselves, I believe you should exert your influence to prevent any campaign for the restoration of a cyclotron to the Japs at this time. ... The Riken was dissolved \"as a result of the defeat,\" although Nishina later raised money to reestablish it on a different footing. Elsewhere in Japan, physicists were restrained from atomic research, and allowed only to work on applications to biology and medicine. But without the big equipment to support pioneering work, Japanese physics did not reattain the prominence it had in the 1930's. Could the Japanese have had an atomic bomb in World War II? All the historians, Japanese and American, echo the conclusion of the Physics Colloquium, that Japan did not have the uranium, resources, or organization for a full-scale Manhattan-style project. So the danger -- as turned out to be the case with the Germans -- was not a real one. But the historical importance of the project lies not in the fact that Japan failed but that she tried, and that Japan's postwar attitude that she, as the one nation victimized by atomic weapons, is above seeking to acquire them for herself, is not historically accurate. The historical record shows -- on the basis of the eagerness of her military and the willing cooperation of her scientists -- that if other factors had made a bomb possible, the leadership -- which by the end of the war were placing their own youth in torpedoes to home them on the advancing U.S. fleet -- would not have hesitated to use the bomb against the United States. -- Deborah Shapley *G. Thomas and M.M. Witts, Enola Gay (Stein & Day, Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., 1977). $11.95. --------------------[First insert (p. 153:2)]-------------------- Derek de Solla Price, Avalon Professor of the History of Science at Yale, with Eri Yagi Shizume, a Yale graduate student, investigated Japan's wartime atomic bomb effort and published a letter in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1962, seeking more information on the project. But none was forthcoming. Price believes the effort was serious enough to \"change the moral and ethical relationship between Japan and the United States.\" \"Japan's attempt to acquire an atomic weapon during the World War II changes the moral and ethical relationship between Japan and the United States that has grown up over the use of the atomic bomb against Japan. The story has been that the Americans were guilty and the Japanese were innocent and blameless; that the Americans developed this terrible new weapon and proceeded to commit an atomic rape of the then-helpless Japanese.\" \"But the fact that the Japanese were trying to develop the bomb, too, means that America was in an arms race with Japan as much as she was with Germany.\" -----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReturn to the ground floor of this tower\n\nReturn to the Main Courtyard\n\nReturn to Fort Freedom's home page"
