>Why Choose Sunny Hair Halo Extensions<

Hassle-Free Wear: This hair extension is designed for easy attachment and removal without the need for glue or weaving. For enhanced stability during wear, we've added clips onto the weft. If you prefer not to use the clips, you can simply remove them and rely solely on the wire when wearing.

Customizable Fit: The wire is adjustable for a snug fit and you can tighten or loosen it as needed. Every package includes an extra wire for your convenience. Achieve a stunning transformation within seconds, unveiling a fresh appearance that remains your secret.

Effortless Convenience: Our halo hair extension is a revolutionary type that doesn't attach to your own hair. It contours to your head's natural shape, sitting comfortably like a crown with a concealed wire. Your own hair rests over the halo, firmly holding it in place.

>Length Guide<

There may be differences in the position of the hair, reaching different heights.

>FAQ<

WHAT MATERIAL ARE HALO HAIR EXTENSIONS CRAFTED FROM?

Halo hair extensions are meticulously crafted using 100% Remy human hair. The Halo weft is affixed with a flexible nylon wire for easy application.

ARE HALO HAIR EXTENSIONS HARMFUL TO THE HAIR?

No, they're not. Similar to clip-in hair extensions, Halo extensions provide a non-damaging method to swiftly enhance the length and volume of your natural hair.

HOW DOES THE HALO REMAIN IN PLACE SECURELY?

To enhance the stability of the halo hair, we've attached clips to the weft. However, if you prefer not to use the clips, you have the option to remove them and solely rely on the wire when wearing the halo. Once the halo is applied, the weight of your natural hair resting atop it contributes to its secure positioning. So, feel free to move your hair with confidence, as the extensions are designed to stay securely in place!

CAN I COLOR MY HALO EXTENSIONS?

Certainly, you can dye your Halo extensions a darker shade or have them toned by a professional hair colorist. Since they're crafted from 100% Remy human hair, this is possible. It's important to note that bleaching or lightening is not recommended, as it can damage the hair. Ensure that you don't dye the wire, as it should remain clear and transparent for proper use.
