        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Maximum Security led the Kentucky Derby every step of the way except for the last one -- into the winner's circle.\n\nThe colt became the first winner disqualified for interference in the Derby's 145-year history, leading to an agonizing wait and an eventual stunning reversal that made 65-1 shot Country House the winner Saturday.\n\nCountry House finished second in the slop before objections were raised, causing a 20-minute delay while three stewards repeatedly reviewed different video angles before they unanimously elevated him into the winner's circle.\n\nThat gave Hall of Fame trainer Bill Mott his first Derby victory at age 65.\n\n\"You always want to win with a clean trip and have everybody recognize the horse as the very good horse and great athlete that he is,\" Mott said. \"Due to the disqualification, I think some of that is diminished.\"\n\nJockey Flavien Prat, one of two jockeys who originated the claim of foul, also won his first Derby.\n\n\"I'm kind of speechless right now,\" Prat said, letting out a long sigh.\n\nCountry House paid $132.40 to win -- the second-highest payout in Derby history. He was the least affected horse in the chain of events, but the biggest beneficiary.\n\nGary West, who owns Maximum Security with his wife, Mary, indicated they may pursue an appeal.\n\n\"I think this is the most egregious disqualification in the history of horse racing,\" he told The Associated Press by phone, \"and not just because it's our horse.\"\n\nCountry House was dismissed as a long shot with a bad post on the far outside. It was only the chestnut colt's second win in seven career starts, and his first stakes victory. Country House ran third in the Arkansas Derby on April 13 at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs.\n\nMaybe this win was one for his father: Lookin At Lucky got saddled with the dreaded No. 1 post in the 2010 Derby, where he got pinned to the rail and wound up sixth. He rebounded to win the Preakness two weeks later.\n\nThe disqualification was a crushing turn of events for Maximum Security trainer Jason Servis and jockey Luis Saez, who already had begun celebrating what they thought were their first Derby victories.\n\nInstead, previously undefeated Maximum Security was dropped to 17th of 19 horses for veering out while turning for home and stacking up War of Will, Long Range Toddy (an Oaklawn horse who won one division of the Rebel Stakes on March 16) and Bodexpress (also owned by the Wests), according to Barbara Borden, chief steward of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission. Country House, in turn, was brushed by Long Range Toddy.\n\nSent off as the 9-2 second choice, Maximum Security was placed behind all the horses that he bothered.\n\n\"I never put anybody in danger,\" Saez said.\n\nServis backed up his jockey, saying: \"He's right. He straightened him up right away, and I didn't think it affects the outcome of the race.\"\n\nPrat claimed that Maximum Security ducked out in the final turn and forced several horses to steady, including Long Range Toddy, whose jockey, Jon Court, also lodged an objection. War of Will came perilously close to clipping heels with Maximum Security, which could have caused a chain-reaction accident.\n\n\"There were two horses in the race that lost all chance to win a Kentucky Derby,\" Mott said. \"They were in position at the time to hit the board. If what happened to us was the only thing they were looking at, I don't think you would have seen a disqualification.\"\n\nMott said the incident was caused by Maximum Security's action and not Saez's riding tactics.\n\n\"I don't think Luis Saez did anything intentionally,\" the trainer said. \"My heart actually aches for them a little bit. That's the way it is. I've been on the other end of it, just not in the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nThe stewards reviewed race footage and interviewed the affected jockeys while keeping the crowd of 150,729 and millions more watching on television and online in suspense, clutching their betting tickets. Trainers and jockeys involved stared at the closest video screen waiting for a result.\n\nCode of Honor was moved up to second and Tacitus -- also trained by Mott -- was third.\n\nImprobable was fourth and Game Winner fifth, two of trainer Bob Baffert's trio of entries. His other horse, Roadster, was 15th.\n\nThe last claim of foul by a jockey in the Derby was unsuccessful. John Velazquez, aboard runner-up Invisible Ink in 2001, alleged interference at the quarter pole against Monarchos and Jorge Chavez, who crossed the finish line 4¾ lengths in front. The stewards didn't change the result.\n\nThe only other disqualification in the Derby occurred long after the race in 1968. Dancer's Image, the first-place finisher, tested positive for a prohibited medication, and Kentucky state racing officials ordered the purse money to be redistributed. Forward Pass got the winner's share. A subsequent court challenge upheld the stewards' decision.\n\nCountry House wore the garland of red roses, but it's possible the situation doesn't end here. There could be appeals to the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission or the courts.\n\n\"We are exploring our options to appeal,\" West told the AP. \"If we can't appeal to the stewards, our other options are the state racing commission. If those don't work, we might go to legal options.\"\n\nMaster Fencer, the first Japan-bred to run in the Derby, was sixth. War of Will was seventh, followed by Plus Que Parfait, Win Win Win, Cutting Humor, By My Standards and Vekoma.\n\nBodexpress finished 13th, followed by Tax, Roadster, Long Range Toddy, Maximum Security, Spinoff and Gray Magician.\n\nAt the window\n\nHORSE WIN PLACE SHOW\n\n20 (18) Country House ...132.40 56.60 24.60\n\n13 (11) Code of Honor .................... 15.20 9.80\n\n8 (8) Tacitus
