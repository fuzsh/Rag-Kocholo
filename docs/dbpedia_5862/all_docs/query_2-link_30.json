        "text": "Plant Hollyhock Seeds: Sow seeds in 2 in. pots or cell packs, press into soil and lightly cover. Kept at 70-75Â° F., germination is in 14-28 days. Can direct sow into prepared seed beds in groups of 3-4 seeds, spaced 2-3 ft. apart. Thin to strongest plant.\n\nGrow Hollyhock: Full sun, part sun in hottest climates. Hollyhock plants perform best in fertile soil with regular moisture. Irrigate from below and provide good air circulation. True perennial hollyhocks noted in description. Most are biennials, or short-lived perennials. Many hollyhocks flower the first season when started early. After flowering cut back plants hard, to within a few in. of the ground. Continue to water and fertilize. Plants repeat bloom in late summer and fall. Single flower hollyhocks attract hummingbirds and butterflies. Hollyhock plants will often self sow."
