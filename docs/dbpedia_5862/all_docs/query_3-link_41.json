        "text": "Lens: Gold Sol-X Mirror\n\nVLT: 7%\n\nBase: Dark sienna brown (Sol-X)\n\nMirror: Multi-layer Gold\n\nJD: An incredibly dark lens. Designed for bright sun and nothing else, it’s my lens of choice while riding Mt. Hood in the summer and during late spring backcountry sessions where there are no clouds in sight. The gold tint has inspired my friends and me to dub it “the astronaut lens.”\n\nLens: Blackout\n\nVLT: 10%\n\nBase: Dark Grey\n\nMirror: NONE\n\nJD: The Blackout lens offers an alternative to the super-mirrored look of the Red/Green Sol-X and Chromapop Everyday. It’s not incredibly versatile, but can handle more clouds than the Gold Sol-X.\n\nWB: If UV protection and fighting super bright conditions is what the day calls for, this is my go-to lens (especially if I’m not feeling the mirrored look or slightly lighter tint of the Green Sol-X.)\n\nLens: Green Sol-X Mirror\n\nVLT 15%\n\nBase: Dark Sienna Brown (Sol-X)\n\nMirror: Multi-layer Green\n\nWB: An awesome bluebird lens. I find it surprisingly capable in late-in-the-day shadows and generally more versatile (for a darker lens) than a rose, blue, or grey tint bright-light lens. Plus, for what’s it worth, I think the purple/green mirror is rad. One of my all-time favorites.\n\nJD: My favorite of Smith’s high-light lenses. It handles Mt. Hood-level sun and has the best contrast and versatility in cloudy and shadowy conditions among any Sol-X lens I’ve worn. It doesn’t feel quite as dark as the Red Sol-X and is better in bright sun than the Platinum Mirror.\n\nLens: Red Sol-X Mirror\n\nVLT: 17%\n\nBase: Dark sienna brown (Sol-X)\n\nMirror: Multi-layer Red\n\nJD: A great sunny-day lens. Although its VLT is 17% as opposed to the Green Sol-X’s 15%, it looks darker to me personally. More at home in bright sun than the Green Sol-X, though not as strong in flatter light when afternoon shadows start to creep in. I reach for it in similar conditions as the Gold Sol-X\n\nLens: Photochromic Red Sensor\n\nVLT: 20-50%\n\nBase: Photochromic Inner\n\nMirror: Red Sensor Mirror\n\nJD: One of my favorite “one-lens quiver” options, the other being Chromapop Everyday. If I have no idea what the light is going to be like that day, I generally go for the Photochromic Red Sensor, especially if the day starts out cloudier.\n\nWB: Smith claims this lens is designed to darken throughout the day, adjusting from morning shadows to late afternoon glare, and that’s just what it’s is great for. It’s not an ideal low-light lens (as it won’t get as light as the Sensor Mirror, which is certainly better suited for overcast and storm days), but does much better than any Sol-X lens in afternoon shade. This can literally turn into a very good low-light lens, and it can also be quite close in performance to the Green Sol-X in sunny conditions, but has a cooler, more blueish tint to it. If you ski in the sun a lot, but have a home mountain that gets shadowed out late in the day, throw this in, and you probably won’t be changing lenses. For storm riding (snowing and flat light conditions), I still swap out this lens for the Sensor Mirror.\n\nLens: Rose Platinum\n\nVLT: 25%\n\nBase: Rose\n\nMirror: Platinum\n\nJD: A slightly darker and rosier base than the Ignitor Mirror make it a mid-to-high-light lens that can handle shadowy afternoons. The Platinum Mirror fills the void between the Ignitor and Sol-X lenses. It’s comparable to Chromapop Everyday, but has a much rosier tint and slightly less low-light versatility.\n\nLens: RC Polar\n\nVLT: 25%\n\nBase:Rose\n\nMirror: None\n\nWB: Not surprisingly, this polarized lens noticeably amps up detail and snow texture, helping increase depth perception. I can’t say I find this to be the best mid-day, bluebird lens out there, nor is it the best low/flat-light lens. But it performs impressively in both, providing a nice warm tint. If you’re looking to spend on a very versatile lens to use any day except strom days, consider this as an alternative to the Photochromic Red Sensor, which has a cooler, blue tint.\n\nLens: Ignitor Mirror\n\nVLT: 35%\n\nBase:Rose\n\nMirror: Silver/Platinum\n\nJD: This is Smith’s flagship all-around lens, and rightfully so. It is incredibly versatile, effective in high-light conditions and even a passable low-light lens. I don’t use the Ignitor too often, as it’s less specific than the rest of the line, but for those that are looking for a lens to do everything, the Ignitor is Smith’s best offering.\n\nLens: RC36\n\nVLT: 36%\n\nBase: Rose/Copper\n\nMirror: None\n\nJD: This lens is relatively low-tech, with an amber base and no mirror. However, its tint is great for lower-light days that might not warrant a Sensor or Gold Sensor. I like the classic look of the RC36, and usually use it in similar conditions as the Ignitor.\n\nLens: Red Sensor Mirror\n\nVLT: 60%\n\nBase: Light Rose\n\nMirror: Multi-layer Red\n\nJD: The Red Sensor is rose-based like the Sensor, but is definitely better for a slightly different set of conditions. The Red Sensor’s mirror makes it slightly darker and not as strong as the Sensor when it comes to contrast in flat-light conditions. However, its effectiveness reaches farther into the mid-light range than most of Smith’s other low-light lenses, one notable exception being Chromapop Storm. I usually pack a Red Sensor on darker partly cloudy days when the light is variable and could change run-to-run.\n\nLens: Yellow Sensor Mirror\n\nVLT: 65%\n\nBase: Yellow\n\nMirror: Blue\n\nJD: The Yellow Sensor is a comparable option to the Blue Sensor for those who like yellow-based lenses. It provides a warmer field of vision, and gives great contrast in low light but is not as versatile as the Blue Sensor for dappled sun conditions. Great for night riding as well.\n\nLens: Blue Sensor Mirror\n\nVLT: 70%\n\nBase: Light Rose\n\nMirror: Multi-layer Blue\n\nJD: This is Smith’s best ultra low-light lens in my opinion, though Chromapop Storm is a very close second. Its tint is exceptional at bringing out nuances in the snow, and in my experience provides the best low-light contrast of any of Smith’s lenses. High VLT yellow lenses are great in very flat light, but if the sun happens to come out, it’s almost painful to the eyes. While the Sensor is by no means a high-light lens, in my experience it has outperformed most of its competitors in its versatility.\n\nWB: For a low-light, rose-tinted lens, the Sensor Mirror is as good as it gets—if I’m wearing my I/Os. This is my go-to lens for overcast days and low/flat-light conditions. It provides good color transmission and a slight contrast boost for better depth perception. In my opinion, a yellow-based lens will do best to help you see best in full-on flat light and storm riding, but you’ll be squinting with that sort of lens when things get remotely sunny (not always the case with the rose-based Sensor Mirror, which can still serve you well in slightly brighter conditions).\n\nLens: Clear\n\nVLT: 84%\n\nBase: Clear\n\nMirror: None\n\nJD: I only use clear lenses when night riding. Some people I’ve talked to like them for low-light conditions, but I don’t feel I get enough contrast without any tint."
