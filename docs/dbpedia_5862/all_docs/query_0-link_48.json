        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. — California Chrome, co-owned by Topaz Lake's Steve Coburn, pulled away down the straight for a dominant win at the 140th Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on Saturday.\n\nRead more about California Chrome's story here.\n\nTaking charge at the top of the lane, California Chrome and jockey Victor Espinoza made a decisive move and quickly sprinted clear. They finished the 1 1/4 miles (2,000 meters) in 2:03.66.\n\nArt Sherman became the oldest trainer to win the Derby, 57 years after he traveled from California as an exercise rider for Derby winner Swaps. He watched that race from the barn area; this time he smelled red roses in the winner's circle.\n\n\"It's been a long haul,\" Sherman said, smiling. \"I'm just the same old Art Sherman, except I won the Kentucky Derby.\"\n\nThe chestnut colt was sent off as the 5-2 favorite by the crowd of 164,906, the second-largest in the Derby's 140-year history.\n\nIn a sport dominated by wealthy owners and regally bred horses from Kentucky's bluegrass country, this was a victory for the little guys. Owners Perry Martin and Steve Coburn bred an $8,000 mare to a $2,500 stallion to produce the winner of the world's most famous race with their one-horse stable.\n\n\"This is just a dream come true and a great birthday present,'\" said Coburn, who turned 61 on Saturday.\n\nCalifornia Chrome extended his winning streak to five races by a combined 26 lengths. It was the second Derby win for Espinoza, who rode War Emblem to victory in 2002.\n\n\"I thought he rode him perfect,\" said Sherman, a former jockey. \"I was riding the last 70 yards with Victor, so I think he was riding two. He had a lot of weight on him, I can tell you that.\"\n\nEspinoza had California Chrome sitting comfortably in third in the 19-horse field as Uncle Sigh and Chitu set the early pace.\n\nCalifornia Chrome made his move on the final turn in tandem with Samraat. It looked like those two would decide the outcome, until California Chrome sped away to become the first California-bred to win the Derby since Decidedly in 1962.\n\nCommanding Curve, a 37-1 shot, rallied for second, with Danza third. Wicked Strong was fourth and Samraat finished fifth.\n\nCommanding Curve returned $31.80 and $15.40, giving trainer Dallas Stewart his second straight runner-up finish with a double-digit long shot. Danza, named for actor Tony Danza of \"Who's the Boss?\" fame, paid $6 to show.\n\nKentucky Derby Finish\n\n1. California Chrome\n\n2. Commanding Curve\n\n3. Danza\n\n4. Wicked Strong\n\n5.
