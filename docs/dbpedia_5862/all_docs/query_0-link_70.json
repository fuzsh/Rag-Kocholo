        "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. The Santa Anita Derby is the best race for 3-year-olds in the West, and the Wood Memorial is where the thoroughbred elite meet in the East.\n\nBut Santa Anita Derby winner Dinard and Wood Memorial winner Cahill Road won't be having a showdown in next Saturday's 117th running of the Kentucky Derby.\n\nCahill Road hobbled out of last weekend's Wood with a pulled suspensory ligament in his left front ankle and may never race again.\n\nThe same holds true for Dinard, whose Kentucky Derby defection was announced Wednesday after trainer Richard Lundy discovered torn suspensory ligaments behind the knee in his left front leg.\n\nEven without Dinard, Cahill Road and filly Meadow Star, the 117th Kentucky Derby has no shortage of stars, headed by Strike The Gold and Fly So Free. But the 3-year-old galaxy doesn't have nearly as much dazzle as it seemed when thoroughbred stargazers looked through the telescope 10 days ago.\n\nBoth Dinard and Cahill Road had promised to bring intriguing subplots to the Kentucky Derby drama.\n\nDinard was seeking to become the first gelding to win America's most famous race since Clyde Van Dusen in 1929.\n\nCahill Road is the full brother of last year's Kentucky Derby winner, Unbridled, and has the same owner, 93-year-old Frances Genter, and the same jockey, Craig Perret.\n\nThe Wood also cost the Kentucky Derby its glamor girl, Meadow Star.\n\nVictorious in all nine of her races against other fillies, the daughter of Meadowlake met males for the first time in the Wood and finished a non-threatening fourth.\n\nThat performance prompted owner Carl Icahn and trainer Leroy Jolley to decide against sending Meadow Star to Churchill Downs in an attempt to become the fourth filly to win the Derby. Instead, she is remaining in New York, where she will make her next start against fillies May 25 in the Acorn at Belmont Park.\n\nHere's a look at the probable field: Best Pal: Another gelding. Considered second best in the West after running third to Dinard in the San Rafael and second in the Santa Anita Derby. Last year won six of eight but finished sixth when he invaded New York to meet Fly So Free in the $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Went home and won $1 million Hollywood Futurity. Trainer Ian Jory is the young Englishman who sent out 65-to-1 shot Video Ranger to finish fourth in last year's Derby.\n\nStrike The Gold: Rising son of Alydar, who ran second in all three of the 1978 Triple Crown races. Coming off powerful upset victory over Fly So Free in the Blue Grass after running second to him in the Florida Derby.\n\nFly So Free: National champion 2-year-old. In 10 lifetime starts has seven wins, one place and one show. Has captured major races in New York and Florida. Loss in Blue Grass came on a track listed as \"good\" after heavy rain. Jockey Jose Santos is one of the best in the business. Some pedigree experts think Fly So Free will have a hard time handling 1 1/4-mile Kentucky Derby distance.\n\nHansel: Last year's Arlington-Washington Futurity winner couldn't cope with Fly So Free in two Florida encounters but has turned into a terror in Kentucky. Won Jim Beam by 2 1/2 lengths in Turfway Park 1 1/8-mile record time of 1:50 2/5, then took Keeneland's 1 1/16-mile Lexington by nine lengths. His father, Woodman, is a son of Mr. Prospector and raced in Europe; he's regarded as one of the top young sires.\n\nOlympio: Comes from the powerful barn of Ron McAnally, the Hall of Fame trainer who brought out the best in John Henry. Nosed out Dinard in the San Vicente at Santa Anita and won the Sausalito at Golden Gate Fields before leaving California to score an impressive victory in last weekend's Arkansas Derby.\n\nSea Cadet: Will run as an entry with Olympio for McAnally and owner-breeder Verne Winchell. After the El Camino Real and San Felipe winner finished third in the Santa Anita Derby, McAnally decided to save him for the May 18 Preakness. But the defection of Dinard and availability of jockey Chris McCarron changed his mind.\n\nCorporate Report: Lightly raced chestnut colt comes from the conglomerate-style stable of D. Wayne Lukas, who won the 1988 Kentucky Derby with Winning Colors. Began career March 3 and won two races at Santa Anita before moving to Oaklawn Park, where he was second in the Rebel and Arkansas Derby. Hall of Fame jockey Pat Day is in quest of first Kentucky Derby victory. Day's mounts ran second the past three years.\n\nQuintana: Rebel winner is a son of 1978 Triple Crown winner Affirmed. Trainer David Cross, who has been a hard-luck story since winning the 1983 Kentucky Derby with Sunny's Halo, claimed Quintana from Lukas for $50,000 after he finished fourth in a maiden race at Santa Anita in February.\n\nLost Mountain: Surprising stretch-running second in Wood after going off at odds of 40-to-1. Has won only 1 of 10 starts but in the mutuel money six times. Son of respected sire Cox's Ridge.\n\nGreen Alligator: Son of 1984 Preakness winner Gate Dancer coming off head victory in California Derby. Good in-the-money record.\n\nHappy Jazz Band: Ran third in the Wood at 20-to-1 odds. Decent record in New York and Florida.\n\nMane Minister: Decent form in California. Ran fourth in San Rafael and Santa Anita Derby. His dad, Deputy Minister, was a Horse of the Year in Canada and has fathered two North American champion fillies, the late Go For Wand and Open Mind.\n\nSubordinated Debt: Gelded son of Halo, who has sired two Kentucky Derby winners, Sunny's Halo and Sunday Silence (1989). Showed promise in New York last year but very little this year, finishing a distant third in the Fountain of Youth, 11th in the Jim Beam and sixth in the Arkansas Derby.\n\nKyle's Our Man: Trained by John Veitch of Alydar fame. Won the Gotham mile by four lengths in front-running fashion, then finished a tiring sixth in the 1 1/8-mile Wood.\n\nAnother Review: All-time great sire Northern Dancer is his grandpa. Ran a couple biggies during winter at Aqueduct but hasn't been able to cut the mustard in stakes company; was fourth in the Whirlaway, third in the Gotham and seventh in the Wood.\n\nWilder Than Ever: Son of Wild Again, dramatic winner of the 1984 inaugural running of the $3 million Breeders' Cup Classic. Has gone to winner's circle three times in 14-race career. Was the caboose in six-horse Blue Grass. BIOG: NAME:\n\nArchive ID: 464950"
