        "text": "How are Halos, Sundogs and Sun Pillars Created?\n\nThe atmosphere does more than just produce our daily weather: from sunny to cloudy days, dry to wet, stormy to snowy. The atmosphere is also capable of producing colorful displays when conditions are right. Some of these optical effects include halos, sun pillars, and sundogs. To better understand how the atmosphere produces these bursts of color, we need to understand a little something about light.\n\nLight is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength that is visible to the eye. This is the light we see. Visible light is composed of all the colors of the rainbow.\n\nWe can see these colors by using a prism. The properties of a prism allow it to break visible light apart into its component colors; colors ranging from the darkest reds, to the deepest violets, and everything in between.\n\nIn the atmosphere, under certain conditions, water drops and ice crystals can act as a prism, allowing us to see the various colors that make up visible light. Its because of these properties that we get the various atmospheric optical effects.\n\nTo add some understanding as to how the various atmospheric optical effects manifest themselves, it helps to understand the difference between refracted light and reflected light."
