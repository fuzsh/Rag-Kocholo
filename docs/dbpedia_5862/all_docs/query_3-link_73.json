Among the many preparations, the winterovers reinstalled flags along the skiway. The structures off in the distance are the radio and satellite communications facilities for the Pole. A sunny day provided good conditions for their outdoor work, and their snow vehicle, a PistenBully, transported them nicely along the skiway. In the image above of the IceCube Lab (ICL), you can see a faint halo around the bright sun. The bottom images show a closer view, with the large snow accumulation (also known as “Mount ICL”) looking as if it’s blocking access to the lab. Facing away from the ICL, the sunlit snowdrift is striking against the crisp blue sky."
