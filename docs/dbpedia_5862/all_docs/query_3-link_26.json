        "text": "Take your vows in the presence of friends and family.\n\nAir is colorless. A glass of purified water is colorless. And diamonds graded D, E, and F by appraisers are colorless. One colorless diamond is truly a remarkable workpiece. Not only does it represent a lifetime of love and devotion, but it also stands out in an engagement ring and allows the rainbow-colored fire of the diamond to shine.\n\nIt's essential to find a diamond that speaks to you and embodies your one-of-a-kind personality. A colorless diamond ring has always been considered the purest love in the world, and if you like the colorless diamond, may it add more glory to your finger.\n\nEvoke your radiance of here and now with yellow.\n\nIn the natural world, yellow is the color of sunflowers and daffodils, lemons, canaries, and bees. In our contemporary world, yellow is the color of beach sand and sparkling wine.\n\nIn almost every culture, yellow represents sunshine, happiness, and warmth. At Sunny Eden, yellow is one of our primary colors. We are defining this color as happiness, optimism, enlightenment and creativity, sunshine, and faith. It could be your diamond color if you like it.\n\nEnjoy your great popularity around vivid green envies.\n\nWhen Adam and Eve introduced the idea of love into the West, they were near-perfect role models for the healthy, resilient, loving relationship most people crave. In the Garden of Eden, green is no longer just a color but the symbol of pristine and abundant natural beauty.\n\nIn the most romantic American dream, Gatsby from Fitzgerald's novel saw the Green Light each night to hope he could win his beloved girl Daisy back. When green with luck and unwavering love is melted into the diamond, it's the sincere vow from every fiancé-to-be and fiancée-to-be until death does them part.\n\nEmbellish your love story under the blue sky.\n\nBlue is the favorite color of all people because of its rarity and newness. In addition, it's nature's color for water and sky, and today, blue is embraced as the color of trust and responsibility.\n\nWhen we accomplish the impossible, fight all odds, and choose a path that has a new beginning, our heart gets crowded with feelings that are too deep to be described in words. So when a couple plans to engage in a marriage palace, Sunny Eden is willing to provide a gorgeous blue diamond with rare craftsmanship.\n\nElevate your romance with the lovely pink hue of a rose.\n\nWhen pink and rose merge, it becomes the most moving pink rose. If the red rose screams intensity and passion, the pink rose subtly expresses more refined feelings.\n\nA light rosy tone is often associated with femininity, so naturally, the pink rose meaning is that of grace and sweetness. Such a lovely color with gentleness, appreciation, joy, thankfulness, and elegance makes pink appropriate for many occasions. A pink rose engagement ring can be your simple expression that you want your life partner to be happy from tender love to affection to preference.\n\nRound Cut\n\nBrides from everywhere flock to round-cut diamonds. Considering that its shape maximizes the fire of diamond at the proper reflection of light, it's no surprise that this reigning stone makes people fall for a good sparkle. In addition, round, brilliant-cut diamonds work well as solitaires or in two. So if you are a bride who loves the classics, don't miss the round cut.\n\nRead more\n\nMarquise cut\n\nAlso called the Navette cut, the Marquise cut is known for its regal feel. Its distinctive long, narrow shape not only creates an illusion of greater size but boasts a brilliant sparkle. For a cut that has as rich a history as it does a modern appreciation, it has a shape that is incredibly unique compared to its counterparts. In addition, it looks stunning in stones that extend beyond a diamond.\n\nRead more\n\nCushion Cut\n\nThis exquisite cut is often compared to a pillow, thanks to its square-cut combination with rounded corners increasing the stone's brilliance. The cushion-cut diamond has been around since the 18th century, and it was huge in the 19th century when most gemstones were cushion-cut. They've recently surged back into popularity, emanating a total old-world vibe that's perfect for vintage settings.\n\nRead more\n\nPrincess Cut\n\nEvery bride wants to be a princess on her big day. So choose the eponymous princess cut, another widely popular engagement ring style. The princess cut's versatile face-up shape is complete with square or rectangle sides, making it a prime choice for nearly any ring style. You'll get a more modern and geometrical look while still boasting a ton of brilliance, and they're generally much less expensive than the more popular round-cut diamonds.\n\nRead more\n\nHeart Cut\n\nAs an eternal symbol of love, the heart cut is symbolically used as an engagement ring. This contemporary cut boasts a feminine shape that stands for romantic love and will buffer them against life's hardships for hopeful romantics. Since it's a somewhat complicated cut, perhaps that's why they are so special. If you're looking for something undeniably timeless, this trendy cut may be proper for you.\n\nRead more\n\nRadiant Cut\n\nTrue to its name, the radiant cut diamond was invented in 1977 by Henri Grossbard, who caught the light in a big way. The shape mimics an emerald stone, but the unique, deep-cut facets allow for extra sparkle. Brides who don't want to stray too far from the classic shapes will appreciate the timeless nature and bespoke spirit. The deep cut makes the stone look small but rare.\n\nRead more\n\nPear Cut\n\nAlso known as the teardrop, the pear cut is a hybrid of the oval and marquise cut. This unique shape is a perfect choice for vintage-inspired brides who play by their own set of rules and think that two are better than one. Also, since most of the stone shows from the top view, pear-shaped diamonds tend to appear larger than they are, so if size matters, this cut is a perfect choice.\n\nRead more\n\nEmerald Cut\n\nA rectangular step cut characterizes it. The emerald-cut diamond is often favored for its Art Deco aesthetic. While it has more of an understated sparkle, some like to call it a \"hall-of-mirrors\" effect for its long silhouette and angular lines capture the diamond's clarity, dramatically catching the light. In addition, their shape helps fingers look longer and more slender when set vertically, perfect for those engagement ring lovers.\n\nRead more\n\nOval Cut\n\nEssentially an elongated version of a round diamond, the oval-shaped diamond could also have as many facets as a round-cut stone, which means it still sparkles as much. The oval cut is an elegant and out-of-the-ordinary choice, and it elongates the finger by being slightly more prolonged than the round. As a result, it is always a popular cut in all types of jewelry.\n\nRead more\n\nAsscher cut\n\nThe Asscher cut is an octagonal diamond with a square shape and layered facets. What makes this cut different is the more significant step facets, smaller table, and a higher crown which gives the stone more weight. In addition, the corners of the diamond are cropped to give it that unique look. Featuring a deep pavilion and high crown, it offers brilliance and signature appeal. The Asscher diamond's step-cut also emphasizes the stone's clarity, and it is ideal for showcasing higher clarity loose diamonds.\n\nRead more\n\nRound Cut\n\nBrides from everywhere flock to round-cut diamonds.

White gold is an alloy of gold and at least one other white metal, such as palladium, zinc, copper or silver. White gold acquires its signature silvery-white hue from a very thin layer of rhodium. In fact, when gold is mixed with another white metal, \"the resulting color remains a dull gray to tan\", which requires rhodium plating to obtain the white luster. One of the greatest advantages of a white gold ring is that the ring is a neutral silver color that does not affect the center stone. The gemstone will reflect the silvery-white metal without causing any noticeable color difference in the stone. In addition, white gold tends to be shinier and less dull, making it a valuable but cost effective choice.\n\nRead more\n\n18K Yellow Gold\n\nGold is a natural metal that is very durable, yet malleable. It is naturally resistant to corrosion and tarnishing, ensuring that it can withstand years of wear and tear. Gold is a mixture of gold metals. In most cases, gold is mixed with 25% other metals, such as silver, to obtain a soft, buttery tone like 24 carat gold.\n\nYellow gold is often considered more classic than white gold. Unlike white gold and platinum, which look alike, the look of yellow gold is hard to imitate. Yellow gold carries a distinctive, warm glow. Because of the contrast in color, diamonds set in yellow gold usually have more of a showy appearance than those set in white gold.\n\nRead more\n\n18K Rose Gold\n\nRose gold engagement rings are best known for their romantic look and stunning designs. Rose gold is an opulent feminine choice that uses a copper alloy and gold components. It is sometimes referred to as pink gold or red gold. Rose gold rings are just as durable as other popular engagement rings, and they look beautiful with everything from traditional diamonds to colored gemstones. The lovely pink hue of a rose gold engagement ring enhances your romantic feelings. Both rose gold and yellow gold contain gold, copper and silver, but rose gold has more copper alloy and less silver added to achieve a rosy hue. The modern look of rose gold provides an interesting backdrop for oddly shaped diamonds.\n\nRead more\n\nPlatinum\n\nPlatinum is considered to be the rarest and most precious jewelry metal, and as such it commands a high price. In fact, platinum rings typically cost about 25% more than the same set of 14k gold rings. Unlike white gold, pure platinum has a natural white hue that does not fade or require recoloring. Overall, platinum is the most hypoallergenic, making it the safest choice for patients with allergies or sensitive skin. Platinum is also denser than gold, which means that a platinum ring will feel heavier. If you want to design an engagement ring that will last as long as your love for each other, then choose platinum. White gold engagement rings are Sunny Eden's most popular choice because they offer a white sheen that mirrors the brilliance of the diamond. This incredibly durable material means that the engagement ring you design will last for years to come.\n\nRead more\n\n18K White Gold\n\nWhite gold engagement rings exhibit the icy luster of a colorless or nearly colorless center diamond.
