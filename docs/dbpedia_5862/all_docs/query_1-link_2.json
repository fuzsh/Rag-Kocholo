Please remember to keep the temperature below 160 degrees.\n\nIt is possible to dye the hair, but only from a lighter color to a darker one. We recommend conducting a dye test on ONE piece before applying color to the entire bundle.\n\n>Why Choose Sunny Hair Halo Extensions<\n\nHassle-Free Wear: This hair extension is designed for easy attachment and removal without the need for glue or weaving. For enhanced stability during wear, we've added clips onto the weft. If you prefer not to use the clips, you can simply remove them and rely solely on the wire when wearing.\n\nCustomizable Fit: The wire is adjustable for a snug fit and you can tighten or loosen it as needed. Every package includes an extra wire for your convenience. Achieve a stunning transformation within seconds, unveiling a fresh appearance that remains your secret.\n\nEffortless Convenience: Our halo hair extension is a revolutionary type that doesn't attach to your own hair. It contours to your head's natural shape, sitting comfortably like a crown with a concealed wire. Your own hair rests over the halo, firmly holding it in place.\n\n>Length Guide<\n\nThere may be differences in the position of the hair, reaching different heights.\n\n>Color Match<\n\nIf the length of the wire or color is not suitable for you, just contact us to tell your needs: service@g-sunny.com\n\nHow to Change and Adjust Halo Hair?\n\n>How to Apply Halo Hair Extensions<\n\nPlace the extension on your head and gently pull the wire to ensure a flawless fit. Tie the loop to firmly secure the extensions in place.\n\nYou can choose to either part your hair around the ears or let it fall over the top. .\n\nPull your own hair over the flipped-on hair extension to completely conceal the wire. Embrace the beauty of longer, fuller hair within minutes.\n\n>Halo Hair Extensions Before and After<\n\n>How to care for your hair extensions<\n\nBrush your hair before stepping into the shower.\n\nBrushing the hair 2-3 times daily, especially before showering, helps prevent tangling.\n\nProper Hair Shampooing\n\nKindly utilize a shampoo specifically designed for hair extensions. While shampooing, initiate at the roots and gently massage the shampoo downwards, ensuring coverage through the hair. There's no need to shampoo all the way to the tips.\n\nTo see more about hair extension care\n\n>FAQ<\n\nWHAT MATERIAL ARE HALO HAIR EXTENSIONS CRAFTED FROM?\n\nHalo hair extensions are meticulously crafted using 100% Remy human hair. The Halo weft is affixed with a flexible nylon wire for easy application.\n\nARE HALO HAIR EXTENSIONS HARMFUL TO THE HAIR?\n\nNo, they're not. Similar to clip-in hair extensions, Halo extensions provide a non-damaging method to swiftly enhance the length and volume of your natural hair.\n\nHOW DOES THE HALO REMAIN IN PLACE SECURELY?\n\nTo enhance the stability of the halo hair, we've attached clips to the weft. However, if you prefer not to use the clips, you have the option to remove them and solely rely on the wire when wearing the halo. Once the halo is applied, the weight of your natural hair resting atop it contributes to its secure positioning. So, feel free to move your hair with confidence, as the extensions are designed to stay securely in place!\n\nCAN I COLOR MY HALO EXTENSIONS?\n\nCertainly, you can dye your Halo extensions a darker shade or have them toned by a professional hair colorist. Since they're crafted from 100% Remy human hair, this is possible. It's important to note that bleaching or lightening is not recommended, as it can damage the hair. Ensure that you don't dye the wire, as it should remain clear and transparent for proper use."
