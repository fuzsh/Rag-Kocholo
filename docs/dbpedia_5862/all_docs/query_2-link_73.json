        "text": "Faithful blog follower, most comments made on this blog, and friend, Sarah Griffin asked if she could do a post on the possible colors of the foals this year. I said yes, so this post was written by Sarah. Thanks Sarah.\n\nIf you have not read my post about who may have foals this year, it may be helpful to read that first. Click on FOALS to go to that post!\n\nSandy\n\nWhat Color Will The Foals Be?\n\nI thought it would be fun to look at potential colors we may see in the foals born this year. I thought I would go over some of the basics of the genes used in these color predictions. The first is the base color which can be either black or red. “E” is the gene that represents black and it is dominant. A horse with an E gene will have a black base and may either be black or a color with black “points” (the black legs, mane, etc) such as bay, grullo, and dun. To have a chestnut base and display the chestnut color the horse must have two “e” (recessive) genes. These are the chestnut horses along with the palominos. A horse that is EE (homozygous black) will only produce offspring with a black base. Since each parent can only give one representation of the gene one parent may give an “E” and the other parent may give an “e” resulting in an offspring that is Ee. Ee is called a “red carrier.” While that horse will display a black base color they have the potential to produce offspring with a chestnut base. An example of this is the late black stallion Raven. His father was a sorrel stallion which resulting in Raven being Ee. Although he displayed the black color he carried the chestnut gene from his father, which enabled Raven to sire palomino and red roan offspring. The next gene is the roan gene represented by “R” being the dominant roan gene and “r” being the recessive non-roan gene. A horse that is RR is homozygous roan and will only produce roan offspring. A horse that is Rr displays the roan gene but also carries the non-roan gene meaning they can produce both roan and non-roan offspring. A horse that is rr does not have the ability to pass on anything but the non-roan gene to their offspring. They only way they could produce a roan offspring would be when that offspring inherits the roan gene from their other parent. The dun gene works the same way as the roan gene with DD being homozygous, Dd being heterozygous (displays the dun gene, but also carries the non- dun gene) and dd not possessing the dun gene.\n\nWith my knowledge of the horses and their lineage I think I was pretty much able to figure out their different representations of these genes. Of course with them being wild horses they haven’t been gene tested so it’s hard to be 100% certain about all of them. If I wasn’t certain I left the dun and/or roan gene (depending on which/if any apply for a certain case) as heterozygous. And if I wasn’t sure on the E vs e I left it as unknown meaning the calculator took into account the different possibilities (EE, Ee, with ee applying to only chestnuts and palominos). When figuring out these genes it’s easiest to look at a horse’s parents and the offspring that the horse has produced. For example we know Blue Moon is heterozygous roan because his father was a solid dun and his mother was a blue roan. We also know that both Teton and Half Moon are red carriers because they produced a chestnut offspring. And also going back to the example of Raven, we know he has to be a red carrier because his father was chestnut meaning the only gene he could have passed to his son was “e”. And looking at the offspring that Raven produced also lets us know he must be Ee.\n\nThe calculator also doesn’t separate shades of a color. For example seal bay, light bay, dark bay, “average” bay, red bay all fall under the category of “bay.” The calculator also doesn’t have the color apricot dun, so in the horses that may carry that color gene it falls into the category of “red dun.” It also doesn’t account for shading so coyote dun (ex: Jackson) falls into the category of “dun.”\n\nAnd of course we can’t 100% predict or know what color the foal will be, but I think it’s fun to look at the different color possibilities that could turn up! If we’ve seen one of these mare/stallion combos before I also added the colors we’ve already seen them produce.\n\nBristol x Kitalpha\n\n75% Grullo\n\n25% Red Dun\n\n**Bristol and Kitalpha have produced a red dun foal**\n\nHidalgo x Jewel/ Icara (bay)\n\nI think Jewel is actually a dark bay, but it’s hard to tell and even harder to tell with Icara so I ran Icara as both a bay and a black.\n\n32.81% Dun 32.\n\n81% Bay\n\n12.50% Red Dun\n\n12.50% Chestnut\n\n4.69% Grullo\n\n4.69% Black\n\nHidalgo x Icara(black)\n\n18.75% Grullo\n\n18.75% Black\n\n18.75% Dun\n\n18.75% Bay\n\n12.50% Red Dun\n\n12.50% Chestnut\n\nHidalgo x Halo\n\n32.81% Dun\n\n32.81% Bay\n\n12.50% Red Dun\n\n12.50% Chestnut\n\n4.69% Grullo\n\n4.69% Black\n\nHidalgo x Fresia\n\nI wasn’t sure if Hidalgo and Fresia were homozygous for the dun gene or not, but since they’re full siblings they would likely both be the same so I calculated it both ways, but either way the most likely color is red dun.

But since we don’t have a DNA test to be totally sure, I decided to also do a calculation with him as a carrier. That results in it being 50% likely they would have a red roan foal (either red dun roan or chestnut roan), but we haven’t seen that yet. **So far Blue Moon and Halcyon have produced two nearly identical grullo roan foals.**\n\nBlue Moon x Isadora\n\n25% Grullo Roan\n\n25% Grullo\n\n25% Blue Roan\n\n25% Black\n\nCappuccino x Gabrielle\n\n93.75% Dun\n\n6.25% Grullo\n\n**Cappuccino and Gabrielle have produced several dun foals**\n\nCuster x Fiasco\n\n18.75% Bay Roan\n\n18.75% Dun Roan\n\n18.75 Dun\n\n18.75 Bay\n\n6.25% Grullo Roan\n\n6.25% Grullo\n\n6.25% Blue Roan\n\n6.25% Black\n\n**Custer and Fiasco have produced dun roan and grullo roan foals**\n\nCoronado x Fools Gold\n\n43.75% Dun Roan\n\n43.75% Dun\n\n6.25% Grullo Roan\n\n6.25% Grullo\n\n**Coronado and Fools Gold have produced a dun roan foal**\n\nCoronado x Dove\n\n16.41% Buckskin Roan\n\n16.41% Buckskin\n\n16.41% Bay Roan\n\n16.41% Bay\n\n6.25% Palomino Roan\n\n6.25% Palomino\n\n6.25% Chestnut Roan\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n2.34% Smokey Blue Roan\n\n2.34% Smokey Black\n\n2.34% Blue Roan\n\n2.34% Black\n\n**Coronado and Dove have produced a sooty buckskin roan foal**\n\nDoc x Demure\n\n37.50% Dun\n\n37.50% Bay\n\n12.50% Grullo\n\n12.50% black\n\n**Doc and Demure have produced a grulla foal**\n\nDuke x Graciana\n\n32.81% Dun\n\n32.81% Bay\n\n10.94% Grullo\n\n10.94% Black\n\n6.25% Red Dun\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n**Duke and Graciana have produced a dun foal**\n\nDuke x Helenium\n\n35.16% Dun\n\n35.16% Bay\n\n12.50% Red Dun\n\n12.50% Chestnut\n\n2.34% Grullo\n\n2.34% Black\n\nGalaxy x Hera\n\n43.75% Blue Roan\n\n43.75% Black\n\n6.25% Chestnut Roan\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\nGarcia x Greta\n\n32.81% Dun\n\n32.81% Bay\n\n10.94% Grullo\n\n10.94% Black\n\n6.25% Red Dun\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n**Garcia and Greta have produced dun and dark bay/ black foals**\n\nGringo x Jacinta\n\n70.31% Bay\n\n25% Chestnut\n\n4.69% Black\n\nGringo x Galadrial\n\n82.03% Bay\n\n12.50% Chestnut\n\n4.57% Black\n\nTecumseh was seen breeding Galadrial in mid-September, so I also did a calculation with him.\n\nTecumseh x Galadrial\n\n32.81% Bay Roan\n\n32.81% Bay\n\n12.50% Chestnut Roan\n\n12.50% Chestnut\n\n4.69% Blue Roan\n\n4.69% Black\n\nHorizon x Juniper\n\n17.58% Dunskin\n\n17.58% Buckskin\n\n17.58% Dun\n\n17.58% Bay\n\n6.25% Red Dun\n\n6.25% Palomino\n\n6.25% Dunalino\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n1.17% Smoky Grullo\n\n1.17% Smoky Black\n\n1.17% Grullo\n\n1.17% Black\n\nJackson x Firestorm\n\n32.81% Bay Roan\n\n32.81% Dun Roan\n\n12.50% Red Dun Roan\n\n12.50% Chestnut Roan\n\n4.69% Grullo Roan\n\n4.69% Blue Roan\n\n**Jackson and Firestorm have produced several bay roan foals and a blue roan foal\n\nJackson x Galena\n\n32.81% Dun\n\n32.81% Bay\n\n10.94% Grullo\n\n10.94% Black\n\n6.25% Red Dun\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n**Jackson and Galena have produced seal bay, grullo, and dun foals**\n\nJackson x Heritage\n\n16.41% Bay Roan\n\n16.41% Dun Roan\n\n16.41% Dun\n\n16.41% Bay\n\n6.25% Red Dun Roan\n\n6.25% Chestnut Roan\n\n6.25% Red Dun\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n2.34% Grullo Roan\n\n2.34% Grullo\n\n2.34% Blue Roan\n\n2.34% Black\n\nJackson x Jasmine\n\n16.41% Bay Roan\n\n16.41% Dun Roan\n\n16.41% Dun\n\n16.41% Bay\n\n5.47% Grullo Roan\n\n5.47% Grullo\n\n5.47% Blue Roan\n\n5.47% Black\n\n3.13% Red Dun Roan\n\n3.13% Red Dun\n\n3.13% Chestnut Roan\n\n3.13% Chestnut\n\nMorning Star x Hailstorm\n\n16.41% Buckskin Roan\n\n16.41% Buckskin\n\n16.41% Bay Roan\n\n16.41% Bay\n\n5.47% Smoky Blue Roan\n\n5.47% Smoky Black\n\n5.47% Blue Roan\n\n5.47% Black\n\n3.13% Palomino Roan\n\n3.13% Palomino\n\n3.13% Chestnut Roan\n\n3.13% Chestnut\n\nMorning Star x Gaelic Princess\n\n32.81% Dun\n\n32.81% Bay\n\n10.94% Grullo\n\n10.94% Black\n\n6.25% Red Dun\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n**Morning Star and Gaelic Princess have produced a black foal**\n\nMorning Star x Hataalii\n\n43.95% Dun\n\n43.95% Bay\n\n3.13% Red Dun\n\n3.13% Chestnut\n\n2.93% Grullo\n\n2.93% Black\n\n**Morning Star and Hataalii have produced a bay foal**\n\nIrial picked up Audubon when she left Morning Star to go foal. When Ginger first saw them together the foal was already a couple weeks old (found May 8th) and Irial held onto Audubon and her filly for several more weeks before losing them back to Morning Star. While Irial had them he kept his little band well hidden so there’s a chance that Audubon got pregnant before she was able to be darted with pzp. If so, then Irial would be the father. She was mostly likely pzp darted once she was back with Morning Star and more visible, but if she foals later in the summer (probably unlikely) then Morning Star would be the father.\n\nIrial x Audubon\n\n32.81% Grullo Roan\n\n32.81% Blue Roan\n\n10.94% Grullo\n\n10.94% Black\n\n4.69% Red Dun Roan\n\n4.69% Chestnut Roan\n\n1.56% Red Dun\n\n1.56% Chestnut\n\nMorning Star x Audubon\n\n17.58% Bay Roan\n\n17.58% Dun Roan\n\n17.58% Dun\n\n17.58% Bay\n\n5.86% Grullo Roan\n\n5.86% Grullo\n\n5.86% Blue Roan\n\n5.86% Black\n\n1.56% Red Dun Roan\n\n1.56% Red Dun\n\n1.56% Chestnut Roan\n\n1.56% Chestnut\n\n**Morning Star and Audubon have produced blue roan and dun roan foals**\n\nTeton x Half Moon\n\n28.13% Bay Roan\n\n28.13% Bay\n\n12.50% Chestnut Roan\n\n12.50% Chestnut\n\n9.38% Blue Roan\n\n9.38% Black\n\n**Teton and Half Moon have produced a flaxen chestnut foal**\n\nCloud x Feldspar\n\n6.25% Dunalino Roan\n\n6.25% Dunalino\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n6.25% Chestnut Roan\n\n6.25% Palomino\n\n6.25% Palomino Roan\n\n6.25% Red Dun Roan\n\n6.25% Red Dun\n\n3.13% Smoky Blue Roan\n\n3.13% Dun\n\n3.13% Dun Roan\n\n3.13% Bay Roan\n\n3.13% Black\n\n3.13% Blue Roan\n\n3.13% Buckskin\n\n3.13% Dunskin\n\n3.13% Smoky Grullo\n\n3.13% Bay\n\n3.13% Smoky Black\n\n3.13% Smoky Grullo Roan\n\n3.13% Dunskin Roan\n\n3.13% Grullo\n\n3.13% Grullo Roan\n\n3.13% Buckskin Roan\n\n**Cloud and Feldspar have produced blue roan and palomino foals**\n\nCloud x Inocentes\n\n6.25% Dunalino Roan\n\n6.25% Chestnut\n\n6.25% Chestnut Roan\n\n6.25% Dunalino\n\n6.25% Palomino\n\n6.25% Palomino Roan\n\n6.25% Red Dun Roan\n\n6.25% Red Dun\n\n5.47% Buckskin Roan\n\n5.47% Dun\n\n5.47% Dun Roan\n\n5.47%Dunskin Roan\n\n5.47% Bay Roan\n\n5.47% Bay\n\n5.47% Dunskin\n\n5.47% Buckskin\n\n0.78% Black\n\n0.78% Blue Roan\n\n0.78% Smoky Blue Roan\n\n0.78% Smoky Black\n\n0.78% Smoky Grullo Roan\n\n0.78% Grullo 0.78% Grullo Roan\n\n0.78% Smoky Grullo"
