        "text": "Each spring, a horse chestnut tree on the University of Colorado’s Boulder campus puts on a floral display that stops people, even some of the multitasking undergraduates, in their tracks.\n\nThe tree is north of Norlin Library, west of the recreation center and east of Mackey Auditorium. That tree has been charming us for decades.\n\nOur horse chestnut is about 45 feet tall and has a domed crown, with slightly drooping branches upturned at the ends. The foliage is lush, each leaf compound with five to seven leaflets 4 to 12 inches long. Flowers are arranged in towers or panicles approximately a foot tall, each with many flowers. The flowers are white with a red dot that fades to orange and then yellow, so that each panicle has flowers of many colors.\n\nBotanists call it Aesculus hippocastanum, though its common name is horse chestnut. Common names are fraught with uncertainty, and this common name is a notable misnomer. First of all, it is not a true chestnut, and it is not closely related to them, just similar in appearance. It is called horse chestnut because the nuts can be lethal to horses. However, deer and black bears relish the nuts and eat them when they are available.\n\nRemember the traditional holidays song “Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire,” made famous by Nat King Cole? That song refers to true chestnuts, in the genus Castanea, and those chestnuts are edible, tasty and nutritious. The American chestnut, Castanea dentata, was once the largest timber tree in the eastern deciduous forest, with mature trees taller than 100 feet, with trunks 5 to 10 feet in diameter. Chestnut forests were destroyed by chestnut blight between 1904 and 1950.\n\nThe genus Aesculus contains 13 to 19 tree species, some erroneously called chestnuts and others called buckeyes. Six of these species are native to North America, and the rest are native to Eurasia. I was surprised to learn that the horse chestnut is native to the Pindus Mountains in Greece and Albania and the Balkan Mountains in Bulgaria and Serbia. Horticulturists introduced horse chestnuts to cities and towns in Europe, Scandinavia, the United Kingdom and North America. Species native to Eurasia are most commonly named chestnuts, while the name buckeye is only applied to species native to North America.\n\nThe Ohio buckeye, Aesculus glabra, is the Ohio State tree, and has a distribution from Texas through the Midwest to western Pennsylvania. Buckeye was also used as a term of endearment for the early settlers of Ohio. However, through no fault of its own, the tree was adopted as a mascot for the football team at Ohio State University, which has, in my opinion, substantially sullied the reputation of an innocent tree that has done nothing to evoke enmity.\n\nHorse chestnuts and other members of the genus Aesculus have a formidable array of chemical defenses, so that no parts of the tree or its fruits or nuts are edible. Foremost among the defensive compounds are a saponin named aescin and a glucoside named aesculin, both taking their names from the genus Aesculus. But horse chestnuts synthesize other defensive compounds as well. For example, Native Americans crushed the nuts to extract a poison to stun or kill fish, and they blanched the nuts to extract tannins to cure leather.\n\nAlthough some of these compounds have medicinal uses, they are too dangerous to be used as home remedies for any symptom or affliction. Listed among the known side effects of the defensive compounds are “acute anaphylactic reactions” and “acute renal failure.”\n\nIn her diary, Anne Frank wrote about a horse chestnut visible from her window, now remembered as the Anne Frank Tree. Before that tree died in August 2010, seeds were taken and germinated, producing 11 offspring that went through a lengthy quarantine in Indianapolis. Those Anne Frank horse chestnut trees are now planted at two Holocaust Centers and other sites of historical importance across the country."
