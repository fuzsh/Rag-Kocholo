        "text": "The next time Forty Niner runs, he will be a horse of a different color, figuratively and literally.\n\n''He'll be a lot tougher next time'' Woody Stephens, his trainer, promised today after the colt's one-length defeat to Perfect Spy in the Hutcheson Stakes at Gulfstream on Wednesday. ''He took the worst of it and it was his first race since October. Those same horses won't beat him again.''\n\nForty Niner, last year's champion 2-year-old and the winter-book favorite for the Kentucky Derby on May 7, carried eight pounds more than Perfect Spy and was sandwiched between horses while contesting a fast early pace. He won the early duel but could not gain through the stretch on Perfect Spy, who slipped through at the rail from off the pace. Even so, the race did little to dispel the widespread doubts about Forty Niner's ability to negotiate the longer distances he will be asked to cover later this year. More clues should emerge from his next start, the Fountain of Youth Stakes at a mile and one-sixteenth Feb. 15.\n\nAs for Forty Niner's true colors, the next time he runs he will be listed correctly as a chestnut for the first time. The colt had been listed as a bay throughout his 2-year-old season, even though no one could see a black hair on him. He was registered as a chestnut with the Jockey Club, but a clerical error persisted through his first seven career starts. Top of the Charts"
