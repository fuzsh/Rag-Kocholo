        "text": "Vietnamese Fruit Cocktail (Che Thai)\n\nThis post contains affiliate links which we are compensated for if a purchase is made. Using links costs you nothing and helps to support the ongoing creation of content.\n\nWhat is Chè Thái\n\nChè Thái is a Vietnamese dessert or fruit cocktail that is similar to the Thai dessert, Tub Tim Krob, but with an added array of toppings. It contains assorted tropical fruits, jellies, crushed ice, and milk, making it a refreshing and colorful dessert. If you are craving something sweet but don’t want to spend much time in the kitchen, Chè Thái is for you.\n\nChè Thái is similar to Chè Ba Màu, another Vietnamese dessert drink, and the Filipino dessert, halo-halo, but this requires less work. You can make it quickly by using canned tropical fruits only and a no-cook milk mixture.\n\nWhat You Will Need\n\nThe best part about Chè Thái is that it’s versatile. Choose from a variety of fruits and jellies to make it as colorful and texturally-appealing as you want.\n\nThe tropical fruits can be fresh or canned. I listed the different fruits and jellies in color categories below. Simply choose one from each color category. Once you have your fruit and jellies, select your desired milk options and sweeteners.\n\nYellow\n\nJackfruit\n\nMango\n\nDurian — Some Vietnamese will say that Chè Thái is not complete without durian. However, this fruit may not be for everyone. If durian isn’t your cup of tea, don’t include it.\n\nYellow ai-yu jelly\n\nWhite\n\nRambutan\n\nLychee\n\nLongan\n\nYoung coconut meat\n\nToddy palm's seed - This is similar in taste and texture to young coconut.\n\nCoconut jelly\n\nRed\n\nRed “rubies” — Made out of red-dyed water chestnut cut into small cubes and coated in tapioca starch. This requires cooking. Recipe below.\n\nGreen\n\nGreen ai-yu jelly\n\nGreen grass jelly\n\nPandan jelly — Requires cooking. Recipe below.\n\nBlack\n\nGrass jelly\n\nMy Go-to Milk Mixture\n\nHalf & Half (milk)\n\nFrench vanilla coffee creamer (sweetener)\n\nFor a more traditional and non-dairy milk option, use coconut milk and sugar instead.\n\nSome people prefer to use the syrup from one of the canned fruit as a sweetener. I personally do not recommend it as it contains citric acid which throws off the taste too much.\n\nHow to Make Red Rubies\n\nThese red rubies resemble pomegranate seeds, but they have a chewy exterior and a crisp interior.\n\nMaking the red “rubies” is a simple process. You will need fresh or canned water chestnuts, red food dye, and tapioca starch. If you don't have water chestnuts on hand, you can use a firm pear, green apple, or jicama.\n\nFirst, dice up the water chestnut into tiny cubes, then color them in red food coloring. You can use pomegranate or beet juice for a more natural coloring instead.\n\nNext, mix in tapioca starch and make sure that every water chestnut piece is evenly covered. Sift them through a colander or strainer to get rid of the excess starch.\n\nBoil the water chestnut in water until they float to the top. Immediately transfer them into a bowl of iced water until they are ready to be used.\n\nHow to Make Pandan Jelly\n\nTo make the green pandan jelly, you will need agar agar powder, water, sugar, and pandan extract. Start with bringing water to a boil in a saucepan, then mix in the agar agar powder and sugar until dissolved. Remove it from the heat. Mix in the pandan extract.\n\nFor the white or clear version, omit the pandan extract. For a coconut version, you can use your favorite coconut juice instead of water.\n\nThe jelly will be firm in one hour at room temperature or even faster in the fridge. Once set, slice into thin strips or small cubes.\n\nServing & Storage\n\nChè Thái is the perfect dessert to make for a party. Refrigerate for 2 hours, or add ice before serving. You can mix everything together and serve it in a giant punch bowl so people can serve themselves quickly. Alternatively, ladle them into individual tall glasses to show off the different layers and have your guests add ice and milk.\n\nYou can keep it in the fridge for up to 3 days in a sealed container, whether it’s mixed together or not. Keep in mind that any added color will leak into the coconut milk if everything is mixed together.\n\nVietnamese Fruit Cocktail (Chè Thái)https://youtu.be/rq37GR1trdcA Vietnamese dessert or fruit cocktail, Chè Thái is made with assorted tropical fruits, jellies, crushed ice, and milk and sometimes includes durian.

It's a refreshing and colorful dessert with a variety of textures. If you are craving for something sweet but don’t want to spend much time in the kitchen, this is for you.\n\nIngredients\n\nCanned Fruit\n\nJackfruit (20 oz can)\n\nLongan (20 oz can)\n\nToddy Palm Seed (20 oz can)\n\nMilk\n\n2 cups Half and Half\n\n1 cup French Vanilla Coffee Creamer\n\nRed Rubies\n\nWater chestnut (8 oz can)\n\n2 or 3 drops red gel food coloring\n\n¼ cup tapioca starch\n\nPandan and White Jelly\n\n2 cups water\n\n2 teaspoons agar agar powder (Telephone brand)\n\n2-3 drops pandan gel extract (Butterfly brand)\n\n3 tablespoons granulated cane sugar\n\nInstructions\n\nPrepare the Fruit and Milk Mixture\n\nDrain the fruit from the cans and slice into thin strips or small pieces. Set aside.\n\nMix together Half and Half and French Vanilla Coffee Creamer. Set aside.\n\nMake Red Rubies\n\nDrain the water chestnut from the can. Cut into small 3 mm cubes, about 9 small pieces from one water chestnut.\n\nTransfer water chestnut to a small bowl. Add 2 to 3 drops of red food gel. Give it a toss until all pieces are evenly colored. Add tapioca starch. Give it another toss until all pieces are evenly coated.\n\nBring a small pot of water (about 1 liter) to a boil. Add water chestnut. After two minutes, they should float to the top. Immediately transfer the water chestnut into a bowl of iced water. Keep it in a little bit of water so that they don’t stick together.\n\nMake Pandan and White Jelly\n\nBring the water to a boil in a saucepan.\n\nMix in the agar agar powder and sugar until dissolved.\n\nRemove it from the heat. Divide it evenly between two small molds or bowls. Leave one as is and color the other one green with 2-3 drops of pandan gel extract (Butterfly brand). It will set in one hour at room temperature or faster in the fridge.\n\nCut into small cubes or thin strips.\n\nAssembly and Storage\n\nRefrigerate for 2 hours, or add ice before serving. You can mix everything together and serve this in a giant punch bowl so people can serve themselves. Alternatively, ladle them into individual tall glasses to show off the different layers and have your guests add ice and milk.\n\nYou can keep it in the fridge for up to 3 days in a sealed container. If everything is mixed together, keep in mind that any added color will slowly leak into the milk.\n\nNotes\n\nOther fruits and jellies you can use: mango, durian, rambutan, lychee, young coconut meat, ai-yu jelly, and grass jelly.\n\nFor a more traditional and non-dairy milk option, use coconut milk and sugar. You can use either palm sugar or granulated white cane sugar. Heat the milk on the stovetop and add sugar to taste.\n\nIf you don't have water chestnut, substitute with a firm pear, green apple, or jicama.\n\nNutrition Facts\n\nCalories\n\n180\n\nFat\n\n11 g\n\nSat.
