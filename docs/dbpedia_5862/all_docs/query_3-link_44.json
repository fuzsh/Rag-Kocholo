        "text": "CLEANABILITY Cleaning code W - Spot clean only with water based upholstery shampoo or foam cleaner. Pretest a small inconspicuous area before proceeding. Do not over wet. Do not use solvents to spot clean. Cushion covers should not be removed and laundered. To prevent overall soiling, frequent vacuuming or light brushing with a non-metallic, soft bristle brush to remove dust and grime is recommended. When cleaning a spill, blot immediately to remove spilled material. Evenly clean the entire panel in a seam to seam fashion. Do not clean just the spots or stains. When an overall soiled condition has been reached and professional care is required, contact an IICRC certified firm (www.iicrc.org)."
