        "text": "Long, voluminous locks will always be in style, but some of us need hair extensions to help us get that added length and volume we want. There are lots of questions we had about extensions about application tips, extensions for different hair types, synthetic vs natural extensions, and more, so we turned to Priscilla Valles, celebrity hairstylist (her clientele includes red carpet regulars such as Christina Aguilera, Chrissy Teigen, and Kylie Jenner, to name a few) who has her own salon at The Palms in Las Vegas, to answer our most pressing questions and tell us what to look for when hair shopping.\n\nWhat are the best types of hair extensions?\n\nFirst, you'll have to make sure you're getting natural hair extensions. \"Most hair extensions are made out of human hair. There are synthetic ones too, but not too many since you can’t apply heat to them, and therefore you can't style your hair,\" explains Valles.\n\nClip-ins are the the fastest and most affordable type of hair extension. You can apply them yourself in 10 to 15 minutes by using toupee-like clips to secure the band of hair to your scalp. \"Imagine a hula skirt of hair with clips on it,\" says Valles. The cost of clip-in hair extensions can cost anywhere from $100 to $200.\n\nSew-ins are one of the older types of hair extensions. They are secured to the scalp by braiding the natural hair horizontally from ear to ear then sewing the weft of hair into the braid. On average, sew-in extensions cost a minimum of $275 plus $60 for every track sewn in.\n\nTape-ins are Valles favorite type of hair extension. \"Tape-ins are thicker and give you picture perfect hair,\" says Valles. They are segments of hair attached to two-inch thick double sided keratin tape. The extensions are secured by sandwiching the tape between strands of your natural hair and cost as low as $200 for partial extensions or more if you have very thin hair.\n\nGlue-ins are a bit more expensive because of the work involved in application. The average cost is around $300-$500. They are applied by melting a plastic keratin bond the size of a grain of rice around your natural strands. Valles describes the process as basically building a wig on the head, which can take up to three hours.\n\nHalo extensions are the least invasive to your hair roots. A transparent wire sits around the crown of the head like a halo. The bottom half contains the hair, while the top half remains bare so it can be easily hidden under your own hair. Since it isn't secured to any stands, there's less to weight pulling on your natural locks, and it's super easy to do yourself.\n\nHow long do hair extensions last?\n\nWhile halo extensions can last up to one year if treated appropriately and not worn too often, other types of hair extensions have an earlier expiration date. Clip-ins, sew-ins, glue-ins, and tape-ins last for about two months, according to Valles. \"If you go longer, that's when you start to see some possible damage.\"\n\nDo extensions damage your real hair?\n\nNo, not if you wear and maintain them correctly. \"I have clients who have had extensions for 15 years [and] every 6 weeks, we remove them and put them back in,\" says Valles. If someone leaves their extensions on for too long, that could cause hair fallout.\n\nWhy? We shed up to 100 hairs per day, so the amount of natural hair inside of an individual extension naturally thins over time. If the natural hair becomes too thin, \"that bond becomes heavy. It can easily be plucked out which is how women end up having bald spots,\" says Valles. Don't risk it: you're better off getting your extensions changed every 2-8 weeks, says Valles.\n\nYou should always ask your hairstylist about their experience applying extensions, but Valles also recommends asking if they have been certified by an extension company. Extensions are safe for your hair if applied correctly so you'll want to make sure you are in good hands.\n\nHow do I maintain my extensions at home?\n\nExtensions should be cared for the same way you care for your own hair. Wash gently and be sure to avoid any tugging at the root where the extensions are attached to the head. \"It’s good to use a really good detangling brush and a hydrating hair mask,\" says Valles, like or . She also recommends keeping treatments away from the bonding method of the extensions and more toward the shaft of the hair to keep the bond strong. At night, Valles suggests braiding your hair into two loose braids to keep it from tangling."
