        "text": "Whilst most of us are thrilled by the warm and sunny weather, our hair might not share the same enthusiasm. The summer months can be a nightmare for those battling frizzy locks, but there is a cheap solution millions swear by.\n\nA common household item, likely sitting in your kitchen cupboard right now, has been impressing many for its unexpected effectiveness in combating frizz and static. Aluminium foil could be the secret weapon needed for smooth, sleek hair during Britain's warmer days - and it's incredibly cheap.\n\nAt Asda, for instance, a ten-metre roll of tin foil costs just Â£1.40, which works out at about 14p per metre. However, you'll only need a small piece for each hair-taming session, so you'll probably only spend a fraction of the price.\n\nThe tin foil trick has gone viral on TikTok, with countless users amazed by its efficacy. A video posted by blogger Rominagafur, where she demonstrates the method, has amassed over one million views.\n\nIn the video, she holds up a piece of foil and explains: \"Okay, let's try this. I just curled my hair then brushed through it, and as you can see, it is very static.\"\n\nAfter parting her hair, she slides the foil down one section. The result is immediate and dramatic, with the treated side appearing significantly smoother than the other.\n\n\"No way, do you see this?\", she exclaims in disbelief. \"This foil hack is actually insane, look at this.\"\n\nIn the comment section, plenty of others were shocked by the nifty household item. Nelly commented: \"I'm just as surprised as u are.\"\n\nAnother user pointed out: \"You can definitely tell the difference.\" Ari exclaimed: \"Whaaatt.\" Kayla also suggested: \"Dryer sheets also work.\"\n\nIndustry professionals from beauty platform Fresha have also confirmed the usefulness of tin foil for minimising frizz. Their advice is simple: \"Separate your hair into sections and take a piece of tin foil. Loosely wrap the foil around each section, then gently pull it down your hair to smooth out frizz.\"\n\nThey went on to emphasise the cost-effectiveness and utility of the hack, stating: \"Tin foil costs around 20p per metre, and the metal helps neutralise static, resulting in glossy locks. This method works best for straighter or wavy hair.\"\n\nThey've also shared three other ways people can tame frizzy hair, including adding coconut oil to your routine, washing with cold water and sleeping with a silk pillowcase."
