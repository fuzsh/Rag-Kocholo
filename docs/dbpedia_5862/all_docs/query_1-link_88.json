It covers all things Halo from the past month or so.\n\nIf you want a recap of Halo Infinite news, MCC Season 7, Halo 5's playlist schedule, and more, you're in the right place. Let's get right to it!\n\nHALO: THE MASTER CHIEF COLLECTION\n\nMCC Season 7 Main Menu Screen\n\nMCC's Season 7: Elite wort wort worted into our lives bringing with it a bunch of love for everyone, but especially our Sangheili friends. Plus the usual additions like new-old Halo 3 maps, customization content, and much, much more. Don't take our wort for it though, check it out for yourself!\n\nKILLER KEYSTONE\n\nJust like past seasons, there's some sweet unlocks you can earn by completing challenges. Yes, some of them are more, well, challenging, than others but they are aptly named! Grab your own Evocotiâ€™s Edge Engergy Sword Skin, Tinted Smoke Tech Suit, or Pixel Battle Rifle. Other timed challenges will give you a large drop of rewards â€“ so make sure you make time for them!\n\nMCC Season 7 Keystone Helmet for Halo 4\n\nWhile you're waiting for Halo Infinite, you can enjoy the slick silhouette of the Mark VII Keystone Helmet in Halo 4.

What are you waiting for?\n\nGAMES GALORE\n\nWe know there's a good portion of our community that lives and dies by custom games and we're thrilled to see you enjoying the Custom Game Browser (CGB) so far! You've likely noticed that it's only available for Halo: Reach at this point but that's because this is Phase One, support for other titles is coming. You can hop into lobbies, or start your own, by heading to the Multiplayer Menu and selecting \"Custom Game Browser\". What kind of games are you itching to play? Assassination towers? JENGA? MLG customs? Let us know what you're liking!\n\nIf you are more technologically inclined and into modding your games, then our official modding tools for Halo: Combat Evolved are probably more your speed. You don't need to own the game on Steam (or at all!) to play around with these tools, all you need is a registered Steam account. If you're interested in dipping your toes in, Steam's Modding Forums are a great resource to keep in your pocket.\n\nPIXEL PERFECT\n\nBanshee Screenshot from MCC Main Menu Video\n\nFor every title and seasonal update for MCC, we are proud to have put together some incredible press kits for our fans. This season is no exception and the Banshees make this bunch one of my favorites we've done.

If you're curious what that partnership entails, be sure to check it out!\n\nCLIPTROCITY\n\nMay's Cliptrocity results are in.

Additional details about some of the Halo Infinite armors provide a nice bit of bonus reading as well.\n\nHALO INFINITE\n\nHoliday 2021 is off on the horizon but weâ€™ve still got a little ways to go before launch. In the meantime, we have plenty of information to share with you before you touchdown on Zeta Halo.\n\nWe've given the world the first look at Halo Infinite's multiplayer, which, as a reminder, is free to play!, and introduced you to the Weapon. Add to that our thoroughly detailed Mark VII Cosplay Guide, our press kit, and the latest Inside Infinite and you've got a wide variety of Halo Infinite news to sift through. If you still want more, there's a couple Canon Fodders and a sneak peek at the next Mondo poster featuring the brand-new Yoroi armor.\n\nINFINITE INCIDENTALS\n\nFor those of you who are adept at crafting with your hands and want to make your own Mark VII, we've got an excellent and extensive Cosplay Guide available. It's chock-full of details and has been carefully curated to cover ever detail you could possibly need.\n\nWe touched on Canon Fodder 116 in Radar Blips but the indefatigable GrimBrother One penned Issue 115: Showcase Sensitive on the heels of the Xbox Showcase. Grab your copy to learn more about some of the armor you can don in Halo Infinite and meet the badass Spartan Academy Commander, Laurette Agryna.\n\nMondo's first Halo themed poster sold out so fast, we didn't even get a chance to tell people about it, and that was without a sneak peek. This time, we know what it looks like ahead of time and boy oh bo-Yoroi does it. look. stunning. ðŸ¤© Warm those clicking fingers up so you can grab one when they go on sale later this month during Comic-Con@Home, July 23-25.\n\nHalo Waypoint is getting a fresh coat of paint soon and our latest Inside Infinite shines a bright light on the work our web team has been doing. It looks incredible and I cannot wait for the day we get to cut the methaphorical ribbon on the grand re-re-re-opening. (Or is it re-re-re-re-opening? I've lost count now which just means I've been around the forums for way too long.)\n\nAnd finally, I know we mentioned our latest MCC press kit but we also have one for our latest Halo Infinite showcase. If you want to gussy-up your screens or social media banners, you can grab the latest in Infinite art now!\n\nXBOX AND BETHESDA GAMES SHOWCASE & MULTIPLAYER REVEAL\n\nDuring the above mentioned event back on June 13, we gave the world a first look at our multiplayer. It's always nervewracking showing off something as big as Halo multiplayer but the community reactions made it all worth it. Special thanks to @LoganDodson (some of you might know him better as Snipetality) for putting together this incredible montage of responses. If you haven't seen it yet, it's absolutely worth the ~2:20 minutes of your day. ðŸ’š\n\nNow that your heart is full of feels (at least, I hope so because mine is!), and if you're one of the few that missed the trailer during the initial reveal, you can watch it and then, if that isn't enough for you, you can follow it up with our blog focused on Halo Infinite Multiplayer.\n\nART\n\nThrowing it all the way back to Halo 5 with this month's piece of artwork. I love Blue Team and I loved getting to see them (and Fireteam Osiris!) in a game. On top of that, Genesis is lovely. As always, you can download the image by clicking on it or you can grab a copy from this link.\n\nBlue Team looking at Cortana on Genesis from Halo 5: Guardians\n\nWhile that might wrap up this month's Community Update, there's more still to come. I know we've been saying it a lot lately, but if you aren't registered for Halo Insider yet and you want a shot at participating in our Technical Previews for Halo Infinite, please be sure you're signed up and opted in to communications."
