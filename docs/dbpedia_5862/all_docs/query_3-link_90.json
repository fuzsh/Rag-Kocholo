        "text": "There are 10 base flower families in One World. Each family is made up of a parent flower and its 7 mutant children. Growing the flowers in the proper field and season can trigger a mutation. Selling a specific number of the mutated flower variety will unlock the seeds in select vendor shops.\n\nMarguerite\n\nThis flower is the first you'll grow when starting out in Calisson. There's a single Marguerite seed wisp along the path behind the Calisson farm, a bit south of the Apple tree grove. There's also a fellow by the bridge leading through the wilderness area towards Halo Halo that will trade you two Marguerite for 10 bags of Yellow Marguerite seeds.\n\nMarguerite takes 4 days to mature and can only be harvested one time.\n\nFlower NameMutation Location/SeasonSell PriceShop Location\n\nMarguerite N/A 100 G Calisson\n\nSell 30 Marguerite mutates into...\n\nYellow Marguerite Marguerite grown in the Calisson meadow field during spring and fall\n\nMarguerite grown in the Wagashi water field during spring and fall 300 G Calisson\n\nSell 15\n\nPink Marguerite Marguerite grown in the Calisson meadow field during summer 800 G Calisson\n\nSell 15\n\nPurple Marguerite Marguerite grown in the Pastilla desert field during fall\n\nMarguerite grown in the Wagashi water field during fall 800 G Calisson\n\nSell 15\n\nChamomile Marguerite grown in the Halo Halo beach field during summer\n\nMarguerite grown in the Wagashi water field during spring 300 G Pastilla\n\nSell 15 Pink Marguerite mutates into...\n\nGiant Marguerite Pink Marguerite grown in the HG Shrine field during summer\n\nPink Marguerite grown in the Wagashi water field during summer 1500 G Lebkuchen\n\nSell 10 Purple Marguerite mutates into...\n\nBlue Marguerite Purple Marguerite grown in the Pastilla desert field during fall\n\nPurple Marguerite grown in the Halo Halo beach field during fall\n\nPurple Marguerite grown in the Wagashi water field during fall 1500 G Lebkuchen\n\nSell 10 Chamomile mutates into...\n\nAqua Chamomile Chamomile grown in the Halo Halo beach field during spring\n\nChamomile grown in the HG Shrine field during spring\n\nChamomile grown in the Pastilla desert field during summer 800 G Halo Halo\n\nSell 10\n\nTulip\n\nTulips are a little tricky because of the availability of the wisp.
