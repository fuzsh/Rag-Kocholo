Here’s an in-depth look at what various colors symbolize in cultures around the world\n\nIf you’ve ever had the blues or been so angry you saw red, then you’re familiar with the powerful ways in which color can describe intangible ideas and emotions. In art and anthropology, color symbolism refers to color’s ability to signify meaning to a viewer. While there are some universal associations people have with different colors, their meanings differ from culture to culture.\n\nThere are a range of cultural influences that affect one’s view of a specific color, like political and historical associations (flag colors, political parties), mythological and religious associations (references to color in spiritual texts), and linguistic associations (idioms and expressions).\n\nLet’s look at some of the most common symbolism in popular colors, then explore them in full.\n\nCommon Color Symbolism\n\nColor symbolism is prevalent because color is important. It’s a crucial form of communication for human beings. We use it to represent ideas, feelings, and emotions. We also process a lot of information through what we see. Our eyes absorb what’s before us and send signals to our brain to interpret.\n\nThe amount (and variety of) symbolism in colors is truly endless. However, here are a few shared interpretations.\n\nThe Color of Life\n\nRed. No matter one’s race, religion, or personal beliefs, we are all united by the same life force, the blood that flows through the red rivers of our veins.\n\nRed is a universal color of life. Beyond blood, it represents physical energy and humans’ will to exist. It’s evident in all facets of what makes life . . . life.\n\nThe Color of Love\n\nRed or pink. A visually hot color, red represents passionate, sexual love. Or, the exact opposite—jealousy, anger, and revenge.\n\nPink is a softer hue, suggesting a gentler kind of love. It’s a delicate and provocative color (unless neon pink is involved)\n\nThe Color of Happiness\n\nYellow. The return of a yellow sun and the subsequent bloom of spring flowers is enough to make most people smile after a long winter. This is one of the reasons for yellow’s connection to happiness. It’s a bright, youthful color, radiating warmth and joy.\n\nThe Color of Hope\n\nYellow or green. In Canada, families display yellow ribbons on the walls of their home to keep hope alive for loved ones at war.\n\nThe United States and Europe associate green with hope due to its relationship with springtime and a sense of flourishing. Think growth, nature, rebirth—these are all connected to the color green.\n\nThe Color of Peace\n\nBlue. It’s cool and calming, and often associated with the sea and sky. Blue instills a sense of inner stability.\n\nThe Color of Jealousy\n\nGreen. Back in 1603, William Shakespeare referred to jealousy as a “green-eyed monster” in his tragic play Othello. These days, the idiomatic phrase “green with envy” is common in the West.\n\nThe Color of Death\n\nBlack. Always an interesting color because of its inherent antagonism. Black symbolizes death and mourning. Interestingly enough, it’s also a sleek and elegant choice in design, especially minimalistic ones.\n\nRed\n\nPopular Shades\n\nCrimson: Strong, bright, and deep, generally combined with blue or violet.\n\nMaroon: Dark brownish-red, its name comes from the French word marron (chestnut).\n\nVermilion: A brilliant red or scarlet pigment, originally made from the powdered mineral cinnabar.\n\nMost dictionaries refer to fire or blood in order to define “red.” It’s a versatile color that holds both positive and negative connotations.\n\nRed is visually arresting. So, countries around the world use it to signify stop in traffic lights and stop signs.\n\nIn Western cultures, red symbolizes excitement, passion, love, and danger. Red is powerful and sexy. The Lady in Red (an old television and film trope centered around a woman who is irresistible but not to be trusted) wears red\n\nColor quite literally colors the way we view our world.

Interestingly enough, it’s also a sleek and elegant choice in design, especially minimalistic ones.\n\nRed\n\nPopular Shades\n\nCrimson: Strong, bright, and deep, generally combined with blue or violet.\n\nMaroon: Dark brownish-red, its name comes from the French word marron (chestnut).\n\nVermilion: A brilliant red or scarlet pigment, originally made from the powdered mineral cinnabar.\n\nMost dictionaries refer to fire or blood in order to define “red.” It’s a versatile color that holds both positive and negative connotations.\n\nRed is visually arresting. So, countries around the world use it to signify stop in traffic lights and stop signs.\n\nIn Western cultures, red symbolizes excitement, passion, love, and danger. Red is powerful and sexy. The Lady in Red (an old television and film trope centered around a woman who is irresistible but not to be trusted) wears red.\n\nIn China, red represents happiness, good fortune, luck, and prosperity. Since it’s such an auspicious color, people traditionally wear it for big celebrations, such as the New Year. At weddings, the bride wears red. During holidays and other special occasions, monetary gifts are given in red envelopes.\n\nIn East Asian stock markets, red signifies a rise in stock prices, whereas it signifies a fall in North American markets.\n\nThe Japanese flag is a white rectangle with a central crimson-red disc.\n\nRed carries a handful of negative associations in the West—“caught red-handed” (caught in the middle of a wrongdoing) and “red flag” (referring to a warning sign).\n\nMeanwhile, South Africa associates red with mourning. The red section of the country’s flag represents the bloodshed—both in terms of violence and sacrifice—that occurred during the country’s struggle for independence.\n\nOrange\n\nImage by Barbara Neveu.\n\nPopular Shades\n\nCoral: Vivid reddish-orange, like the sea coral.\n\nPeach: Orange lightened to a pale yellow, similar in hue to the fruit of its name.\n\nSalmon: Pinkish-orange, named after the color of salmon flesh.\n\nOrange is the easiest color to see in dim light. It’s no surprise that life rafts, life jackets, and buoys come in the “safety orange” shade. In the United States, “Detour” signs and the vests of highway workers are orange in order to ensure visibility.\n\nThe West has much more color symbolism for orange. It brings autumn and harvest to mind. When paired with black, orange represents Halloween, a time when the veil between worlds is supposedly thin. Some suggest orange and black were chosen for their opposing associations—orange being the warmth of life and black the darkness of death\n\nImage via Andrei Nekrassov.\n\nWestern culture also associates orange with frivolity and amusement. Clowns wear orange wigs. Mythological paintings depict Bacchus—the god of wine-making, fertility, ritual madness, and religious ecstasy—in orange robes.\n\nIn Southeast Asia (namely Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar), Buddhist monks of the Theravada tradition wear saffron-colored robes. Monks chose this hue centuries ago mainly due to the dye available at the time, but the tradition has continued into the present. These countries associate what is sacred and holy with the color orange.\n\nThere’s a phenomenon in the Netherlands called Oranjegekte (orange craze) that occurs during major sporting events, the F1 Grand Prix, and an annual holiday that celebrates the king’s birthday. When the orange craze takes over the Dutch, they wear orange clothing and decorate their cars, houses, shops, and streets in orange. This started as a way to celebrate the Dutch royal family—the House of Orange-Nassau.\n\nYellow\n\nImage via irin-k.\n\nPopular Shades\n\nCanary: Bright yellow, resembles the plumage of a canary bird.\n\nGold: Vivid yellow, sometimes metallic in color, associated with wealth.\n\nLemon Chiffon: Very light yellow, like that of a lemon-chiffon pie.\n\nNeed to grab a viewer’s attention? Yellow is the most visible color on the spectrum and the first color the human eye notices. The yellow ochre pigment dates back thousands of years and was one of the first colors in human artwork.\n\nFor example, the Lascaux Cave in France has a 17,000-year-old painting of a yellow horse.\n\nIn the United States, Canada, and Europe, surveys find that people associate yellow with gentleness and spontaneity, but also with greed and duplicity.\n\nPeople in the United States also associate it with cowardice. Some believe the phrase “yellow-bellied”—a term for those who are cowardly—may have originated from chickens (“Don’t be a chicken”) and the rich yellow of their egg yolk.\n\nIn China, yellow has strong historical and cultural associations. The first emperor was called the Yellow Emperor. When the Song Dynasty ended in 1279, the emperor was the only person allowed to wear bright yellow. Yellow carpet also welcomed and honored distinguished visitors to China.\n\nIn current Chinese pop culture, however, a “yellow movie” refers to films that are adult in nature.\n\nYellow is a sacred color in Polynesia, considered to be the color of divine essence. In local languages, yellow shares its name with the curcuma longa plant, which is thought to be the food of the gods.\n\nYellow and gold are interchangeable in Christian lore. The color(s) symbolize faith and the divine glory, and golden halos adorn saints in religious paintings.\n\nGreen\n\nPopular Shades\n\nForest Green: Vivid yellowish-green, resembles trees and plants in a forest.\n\nLime: Vivid yellow-green, named after the citrus fruit.\n\nOlive: A dark, earthy, subdued shade.\n\nSurveys show that green is commonly associated with nature, spring, and good health in North and South America, Europe, and Islamic countries.\n\nConversely, the United States and European Union sometimes associate it with poor health. The saying “green around the gills” refers to someone who appears sick. Although the origin of the phrase is lost, it’s likely due to the discoloration of one’s skin when they are nauseated.\n\nGreen means go. Traffic lights turn green when cars should pass. Hollywood “greenlights” projects for production. We also see this in the United States immigration process. A “green card” is what immigrants receive when they have permission to permanently stay in the country.\n\nIreland is synonymous with green. It’s called the Emerald Isle because of its abundantly green countryside (a product of heavy rainfall). American country singer Johnny Cash even has a song about the lush landscapes of Ireland entitled “Forty Shades of Green.”\n\nGreen symbolized magical beings in Irish and English folklore. For example, the Irish leprechaun wears a green suit. Legend has it that leprechauns pinch those who aren’t wearing green on St. Patrick’s Day, an Irish holiday that celebrates their foremost patron saint.\n\nGreen is the traditional color of Islam, and is associated with paradise in the Qur’an. This holy text states that the people of paradise wear green and sit upon green cushions. Green is also said to be the favorite color of the Prophet Muhammad and the color in which he was buried.\n\nBlue\n\nPopular Shades\n\nCerulean: A range of colors that includes teal, sky-blue, azure, and deep cyan. The name comes from the Latin word caeruleum, which means “sky” or “heavens.”\n\nIndigo: Deep rich blue, close to the blue shade on the color wheel, named after the ancient dye.\n\nPeriwinkle: Light purplish-blue, named after the flower.\n\nWhile most colors conjure tangibles (a red rose, orange fruit, yellow lemon, or green grass), blue brings to mind the sea and sky, and the dreamy space where the two meet.\n\nBlue transcends cultural boundaries. Its most prominent color symbolism is calmness. It soothes us the way sitting in the sand to watch gentle waves wash ashore soothes us. This is also the reason most airplane interiors are blue, to comfort anxious flyers.\n\nPerhaps it’s also the reason why the United Nations (an intergovernmental organization that aims to maintain international peace) chose light blue as the color of its flag\n\nBlue has significant religious meanings around the world. Ancient Egypt associated blue with divinity and the sky. Amun, the chief deity of the Egyptian Empire (also known as King of Gods), would turn his skin blue in order to fly (invisibly) across the sky.\n\nMeanwhile, in Hinduism, gods such as Vishnu, Krishna, and Shiva, are all depicted as having blue skin. When it comes to 12th century Catholicism, the Roman Catholic Church insisted that painters color the Virgin Mary with the new, most expensive pigment imported from Asia—ultramarine. The color thus became associated with holiness and virtue.\n\nThe Nazar, or Evil Eye, is a blue glass bead. It traces back to ancient Egypt and the god Osiris. His followers believed Osiris’s eye had protective powers. Now, people wear the Nazar as a protective talisman. Turkey, Greece, Pakistan, Iran, and other countries believe it wards off evil and brings good luck.\n\nPurple\n\nPopular Shades\n\nLavender: Pale, light bluish-purple, often associated with softness and femininity.\n\nMauve: Pale purple containing gray and blue, named after the mallow flower.\n\nPlum: Dark brownish or reddish-purple, named after the fruit.\n\nEurope and the United States most often associate purple symbolism with magic and mystery, royalty, and religious faith. Purple fabric used to be extremely expensive to produce. Europe and the United States most often associate purple symbolism with magic and mystery, royalty, and religious faith. Purple fabric used to be extremely expensive to produce. Just one gram of Tyrian purple needed nine thousand small mollusks to produce. Today, purple still symbolizes wealth.\n\nThe hue took its name from the Phoenician trading city of Tyre where it was first manufactured, and the only city in the world where it existed. The color was soon linked with the imperial classes of Rome, Egypt, and Persia, as only the rich and powerful could afford it. Because these ancient rulers were often thought of as gods, purple symbolism became synonymous with holiness."
