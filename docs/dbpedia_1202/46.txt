Le Tigre is a sociopolitical electroclash trio who connected with mainstream Canada when their single, “Deceptacon,” was featured in a huge telecommunications ad campaign. Through collaborations with Peaches and Christina Aguilera, as well as their own material, Le Tigre has spent the last decade immersed in dance party hooks and making the most animated live shows on the indie rock circuit. Listen carefully and you’ll hear lyrics with as ferocious a bite as their beats.

LE TIGRE: ON TOUR is a concert film comprised of footage taken from the band’s final tour before they went on hiatus. Lead singer and original riot grrrl Kathleen Hanna (Bikini Kill, Julie Ruin, author of Kurt’s “smells like teen spirit” lyric) married Beastie Boy Ad-Rock, started teaching at NYU and has been working at a girls’ rock camp. Keyboardist JD Samson has continued with side projects, and guitarist Johanna Fateman opened up a hair salon. This rockumentary will keep fans warm until Le Tigre’s return by following the cheeky ladies as they respectfully represent the feminist, antiwar and LGBT communities while busting out playful dance numbers onstage and an avalanche of witty zingers offstage. Three firecrackers, four continents, 10 countries and one long tour add up to countless reasons to love this one-of-a-kind band.
