        "text": "The Julie Ruin's upcoming album, Hit Reset, begins with the briefest of fake outs. Drumsticks count us into the title track, followed by a jaunty drumbeat that carries the promise of a party anthem. But the tone shifts as soon as Kathleen Hanna starts singing: \"Deer hooves hanging on the wall / Shell casings in the closet hall / Drunk from a mug shaped like a breast / Punishing the people he loved best.\" Almost as chilling as the lyrics are Hanna's breathy vocals in those first few lines, simultaneously evoking trepidation and childhood innocence.\n\nLike so much of the band's second album, due out July 8 via Hardly Art, \"Hit Reset\" comes straight out of Hanna's personal history, injecting disarming honesty into lighthearted melodies. The Julie Ruin frontwoman, feminist hero, and alum of the groundbreaking acts Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, says the song is about her fatherâ€”but there's more to it than fearful memories. \"It's not just about being a kid and not knowing if you're gonna wake up the next day because you had a dad with an alcohol problem and a big gun collection,\" she explains in a recent phone interview. \"Hit Reset\" also captures abuse survivors' fear that the propensity to hurt others is encoded in their DNA. \"That's one of the worst damages abuse can do to people: make them feel like they're destined to abuse other people,\" Hanna says. \"That's your worst nightmare. When you've been abused, thinking of doing that to someone else, putting them through what you've been through? It's a horror show.\"\n\nHit Reset doesn't focus on Hanna's youth in isolation. It also deals with the long, excruciating process of recovering from late-stage Lyme disease and connects the pain of that experience to the scars of a traumatic upbringing. By the time Hanna was diagnosed with the illness in 2010, she'd already been suffering its devastating effects for half a decade, having quit Le Tigre five years earlier because she simply didn't feel well enough to front a touring band. \"I was told by my body that I had to stop,\" she says in Sini Anderson's documentary The Punk Singer, which documents Hanna's struggle with Lyme in the course of tracing her life and work.\n\nThe Julie Ruin, who take their name from Hanna's lo-fi late-'90s solo project, released their first album nearly nine years after Le Tigre's final full-length, This Island. The exuberant Run Fast and Anderson's film, both out in 2013, heralded the return of an artist who had been sorely missed. But less than a year into her comeback, Hanna relapsed, suffering a Lyme complication called Babesia that's similar to malaria. She canceled a planned three-month tour and spent the summer of 2014 undergoing treatment.\n\nYears of recovery and relative isolation gave 47-year-old Hanna new perspective on her history. \"I've had the time to reflect on the relationship between my childhood and the illness,\" she says. As a kid, \"I didn't learn how to take care of myself. I didn't learn how to speak up and say, 'I'm too sick to do this.' I had to learn through the illness to say, 'I can't do this tour. I need to put myself first.' It still wasn't worth being sick, but I did gain some information. I always knew life was short, and to just say whatever I wanted. But it's definitely embedded in my bones in a much firmer way now.\"\n\nI'm gonna decide what I'm gonna wear at the photoshootâ€”or if I'm even gonna show up. I'm gonna decide if I'm gonna hang out with this person anymore. Or I'm gonna decide if, today, I'm just gonna let this person's bullshit roll off my back so I can get what I want.\n\nThis heightened awareness of the need to protect her own time and health pervades Hit Reset, an album that brings introspection and cohesion to the energetic party-punk sound The Julie Ruin debuted on Run Fast. First single \"I Decide,\" a march of self-determination underscored by Hanna's controlled monotone, is the perfect encapsulation of that ethos. \"It was a response to feeling pressure to be a certain way,\" she says of the song. \"At the end of the day, I have to decide. I'm gonna decide what I'm gonna wear at the photoshootâ€”or if I'm even gonna show up. I'm gonna decide if I'm gonna hang out with this person anymore. Or I'm gonna decide if, today, I'm just gonna let this person's bullshit roll off my back so I can get what I want.\" These survival skills can be especially powerful for members of marginalized communities, she notes.\n\nOther songs on the album call out very recognizable toxic personality types. \"Mr. So and So\" is a blistering read of condescending male fans who \"love girl bands, how they take command.\" Complete with a purposely bratty callback chorus, the song responds to what Hanna calls the dominant culture's \"fetishization of feminism,\" as well as her \"years of being tokenized\" as a feministâ€”and just plain femaleâ€”musician.\n\nNew wave jump-rope jam \"Planet You\" concerns itself with a different kind of bloodsucker: the narcissist. Hanna sees a connection between her early life and her tendency to get involved with people like this. \"I realized I was picking people who were like abusive members of my family of origin to be friends with,\" she says. \"I've been really trying to extricate myself from those relationships because, without even trying, people tend to repeat [their past], hoping, 'Next time I'll get it right.'\" She's learned to ignore the sinking feeling that, \"Oh my god, the world's gonna explode if I stop being friends with this person.\" In reality, \"I cut it off, and my life gets better.\"\n\nHit Reset makes for an emotional listening experience; Hanna says she'll have to work to avoid crying onstage when she performs some of the songs. But epiphanies like the ones in \"Planet You\" and \"I Decide\" make it a cathartic and liberating album, too, one that's sure to become a talisman for fans fighting to seize control of their own lives. People sometimes tell Hanna she's a brand, but here she asserts her freedom to be a constantly evolving person instead. She points out that some of her views have changed since her years on the frontlines of the early-'90s riot grrrl movement. Her aggressively sexualized stage persona in Bikini Kill was a reflection of \"the rage of 19 years that had been stuffed down and stuffed down,\" she says. Now, she wouldn't necessarily scrawl \"slut\" on her stomach or incorporate dance moves she learned at her job as a stripper, which sustained Hanna in college and allowed her to making a living while devoting much of her time to Bikini Kill. With The Julie Ruin, she says, \"I dance because I really, really enjoy playing with a live band after so long, and I'm having fucking fun.\"\n\nI dance because I really, really enjoy playing with a live band after so long, and I'm having fucking fun.\n\nNot that she has anything against the latest generation of pop stars who mix sex and feminism. In fact, she embraces them. \"There's a lot of women who have a lot of power in pop cultureâ€”power that I've never experienced. And instead of resting on it and making the same album over and over, they're actually challenging themselves,\" Hanna says. \"To have that kind of power and then do something, like BeyoncÃ© has, that is paying tribute to the Black Power movement or to feminismâ€”she didn't have to do that. It's not like putting the words 'Black Power' or 'feminism' anywhere near your own name is gonna make you sell a gazillion records.\" Though she realizes the language of social justice can feel diluted when it enters the pop sphere, she's \"not so cynical as to think BeyoncÃ© didn't take a risk in bringing these political, historical, and relevant issues to the fore.\"\n\nIf it sounds like Hanna is feeling magnanimous these days, that could have something to do with how grateful she is to be making music again. \"I've always wanted to be a performer, I've always wanted to be onstage, and I've always wanted to be heardâ€”so I'm really lucky,\" she says. While she was sick, her bandmates were some of the only people she saw regularly. Julie Ruin guitarist Sara Landeau, drummer Carmine Covelli, keyboard player Kenny Mellman (aka Herb of cabaret icons Kiki & Herb), and former Bikini Kill bassist Kathi Wilcox \"created a space outside of my illness for me to be myself,\" says Hanna. \"When I'm with them, it's like I'm just another musician in the room and we're working on this project together.\" Now officially free of Lyme and slowly weaning off the harsh medications she took to treat itâ€”a process that involved \"Stevie Nicks doses of Klonopin\"â€”she's preparing for a tour following Hit Reset's release.\n\nHanna's gratitude also comes through on the albumâ€”particularly on closing track \"Calverton\" (the name of the Maryland town where Hanna grew up), a surprisingly soft piano ballad following 12 songs that sound upbeat even when they're devastating. It honors her mother, who couldn't save her from abuse, but whose love helped her survive. \"My mom always whispered in my ear that I could do whatever I wanted,\" Hanna recalls. She sees that support as a vital source of the confidence it took to pursue the life of art and activism she's led for the past three decades. \"Having one person in your life who tells you that you can do it, especially when you're a little kid in a bad situationâ€”it can change everything.\""
