        "text": "Two generations of feminist punk icons, Kathleen Hanna (Bikini Kill, Le Tigre, the Julie Ruin) and Meredith Graves (Perfect Pussy, MTV News), sat down at the flagship SONOS store in New York for an in-depth episode of the Talkhouse Music Podcast.\n\nThey’re big fans of each other’s music, and this fantastic talk covers capitalism, rocking gunnysacks, trolls, today’s definition of punk, feminism, chronic illness, stalkers, the “Etsy-fication of riot grrrl,” why we should vote for Hillary Clinton, and, as Kathleen says, how she and Meredith have “been living parallel lives like twenty, thirty years apart.”"
