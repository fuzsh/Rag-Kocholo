        "text": "A triumphant return after a 7 year hiatus for the iconic Kathleen Hannah of Le Tigre / Bikini Kill with her new band The Julie Ruin alongside Kathi Wilcox (Bikini Kill) on bass, Kenny Mellman (Kiki and Herb) on keyboards, Sara Landeau on guitar and Carmine Covelli on drums.\n\n...the thirteen songs on Run Fast range from sing-along anthems about being part of the underground in the modern economy (“Kids in NY”) to punk stompers (“Oh Come On”) and danceable takedowns (“Ha Ha Ha”). The album also includes the soulful “Just My Kind,” produced by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. Besides a couple of songs mixed by Hanna herself (“Oh Come On” and “Goodnight Goodbye”), the bulk of the album was mixed by Eli Crews (Tune-Yards’ whokill).\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/thejulieruin"
