Also Babes in Toyland, all of the pre-Sleater-Kinney Corin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein stuff, such an amazing movement musically politically everything… “GIRLS TO THE FRONT!”\n\nAlso don’t miss the doc about Kathleen Hanna (The Punk Singer)!!! And her current project The Julie Ruin (or the earlier Julie Ruin album, a lo fi masterpiece of a solo album she did post Bikini Kill).\n\nhttps://thepunksinger.com\n\nCorin Tucker and Carrie Brownstein each branched out during S-K’s hiatus into various projects, less connected to Riot Grrl (and SK is kinda post Riot Girl I suppose) but still amazing. Corin’s now in three great bands (SK, Corin Tucker Band and Filthy Friends). And Wild Flag (Carrie Brownstein, Mary Timony, sorry I forget the other two) was wonderful (look for live YouTube clips of them - in many ways better than the LP).\n\nI was around during the original RG years in the UK, and in addition to the excellent advice above I’d also recommend tracking down copies of the sleeve art and fanzines that were being produced at the time, which were an important part of the experience. I’ve got a load packed in a box somewhere, but I’m sure there must be several online archives out there. The Huggy Bear zines were fantastically dense, heavy with ink and ideas. If you took the dive in, you’d end up with something interesting coming through your letterbox every morning.\n\nAn RG-related label I particularly loved was Slampt, run from Newcastle by Rachel and Pete, who put out fantastic home-made tapes with crayoned covers, and spray-painted EPs."
