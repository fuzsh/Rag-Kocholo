        "text": "The Julie Ruin, fronted by former Bikini Kill and Le Tigre member Kathleen Hanna, have unveiled the official video for ‘Mr. So and So’. In keeping with the track’s message, the clip – directed by Hanna – depicts gender inequality. The track itself speaks of Hanna’s experiences in the music industry, continuously battling against misogyny.\n\nAccording to the band, the video is a “visual representation of how tokenization makes one both visible and invisible,” as explained to Paper, who premiered the clip. “People do it out of ignorance rather than malice. “If they educated themselves they would stop and become true allies.”\n\nThe track is taken from The Julie Ruin’s recent ‘Hit Reset’ LP."
