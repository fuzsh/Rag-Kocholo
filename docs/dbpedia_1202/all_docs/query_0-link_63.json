An intimate peek into The Julie Ruin’s touring adventures and shot on Super 8 film in Olympia, WA last year, the video premiered with Pitchfork today. Watch the “Goodnight Goodbye” video, here!\n\nKathleen Hanna is a celebrated, outspoken figure at the forefront of feminist punk, and the subject of Sini Anderson’s The Punk Singer documentary film. She will also be guest curating this year’s The Sled Island Music and Arts Festival. The Julie Ruin also features dream team Kathi Wilcox on bass (Bikini Kill bandmate), Kenny Mellman on keys (Kiki and Herb), Carmine Covelli on drums (actor, filmmaker and musical juggernaut) & Sara Landeau on guitar (met Kathleen mentoring at Rock Camp for Girls).\n\nRun Fast is out now via TJR Records, distributed via Dischord.\n\n“In The Julie Ruin, Hanna is still the woman so many have admired, even idolized; but she’s also fully herself, quirky and vulnerable, less a role model than a three-dimensional best friend.” – NPR\n\n“Hanna is one of America’s greatest living rock performers.” – The New Yorker\n\n”…the inclusive titular invitation– plus featherlight sing-song notes and masculine shouts by her bandmates– puts the song square in 2013.” – Pitchfork\n\n“Kathleen Hanna has one of America’s toughest punk voices – somewhere between a Johnny Rotten sneer and a Valley-girl shrug.” – Rolling Stone\n\n“the new song harkens back to Hanna’s days in Le Tigre, with its catchy keyboard line and surf-dance beat” – SPIN"
