        "text": "In 1998, Kathleen Hanna, known then as the indefatigable riot grrrl frontwoman of Bikini Kill, released “Julie Ruin,” a lo-fi bedroom album made alone with a drum machine and quarter-inch tapes while her band was falling apart.\n\nMore than a decade later, during another moment of distress — Ms. Hanna, who also led the political electro-pop act Le Tigre, learned she had late-stage Lyme disease — she resurrected the project as a full band, the Julie Ruin, which used samples and synthesizers to make jittery, danceable punk music. (The group’s debut in 2013, “Run Fast,” coincided with the release of “The Punk Singer,” a documentary about Ms. Hanna’s career and health.)\n\nMs. Hanna, 47, is in a much better place now, although you might not know it from the Julie Ruin’s new album, “Hit Reset,” released last week. (The band also features the keyboardist Kenny Mellman, the bassist Kathi Wilcox, the guitarist Sara Landeau and the drummer Carmine Covelli.)\n\nBookended by emotionally draining songs about her parents — “Drunk from a mug shaped like a breast/Punishing the people he loved best,” she sings of her father on the title track — Ms. Hanna confronts her abusive childhood and illness (along with that old foe, the patriarchy) with as much fury as ever.\n\n“It’s easier to look back on stuff than to talk about it while it’s happening,” Ms. Hanna said. “Now that I’m much better on the wellness spectrum — a 9 out of 10 — I feel like I can look back and be like, ‘Oh my God.’ I can see the devastation.”\n\nIn a phone interview, Ms. Hanna discussed coming to terms with her own story and the current state of punk and feminism. These are excerpts from the conversation.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
