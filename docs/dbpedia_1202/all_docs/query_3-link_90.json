        "text": "With the 1991 release of Revolution Girl Style Now!, Kathleen Hanna and her Olympia-based band Bikini Kill injected punk-rock ferocity into feminist politics. Since then Hanna has continued to agitate the status quo with dance-punk trio Le Tigre and her newest group, the Julie Ruin, who release their first album Hit Reset on Hardly Art Records July 8. Emily Nokes and Bree McKenna are half of Tacocat, the pop-punk band that launched the Northwest’s current, irony-drenched incarnation of feminist punk. Along with Lelah Maupin and Eric Randall, they released Lost Time, their third album of pop-punk, on Hardly Art in April. Nokes and McKenna talked with Hanna in a bustling Manhattan café.\n\nEmily Bree was the first person that showed me all the riot grrrl stuff.\n\nBree It was the number-one influence on early Tacocat. Our only goal was to be a basement party band.\n\nKathleen Ours, too!\n\nBree And the only reason we were doing it was because it seemed like it was doable. Because of riot grrrl stuff.\n\nEmily With all the new resurgence of feminism, do you feel like you paved that way? Do you see the new scenes of people and feel that? Or is it something you’re disconnected from?\n\nKathleen I feel kind of disconnected from it. You just can’t get too freaked out over yourself, you know? One of the best parts about it is hearing that you felt like the road had been paved. Because I’m 47, and I’m listening to you guys and I’m like, this is so thrilling—you can just write about whatever you want. We felt like we weren’t allowed to be funny. But we actually thought we were funny.\n\nBree We thought you were funny too!\n\nKathleen Some of our songs to me are totally funny, even “White Boy (Just Die).” We were just hanging out and coming up with stuff: What if I tape this dude I’m at a party with and I play the tape recording of him saying, “Those butt-rocker ho-bitches say they don’t want it but they do”? How are people gonna react to that? It was this funny experiment to us. Taking things to the extreme was part of the joke.\n\nThen it became hard to tour because things were so violent. People were so angry and so mean. It felt like I had to be like this warrior Barbie or Xena the Warrior fucking Princess. That was really hard. It really does feel like you need to have a support group of other bands that get it, because you’re so out on this raft in the middle of the sea.\n\nEmily So, we’re labelmates now! Oh my gosh! How did they woo you?\n\nKathleen Julie Butterfield was working with Sleater-Kinney and we saw her on tour in Barcelona. I was like, “Hey Julie, we’re thinking about being on a label—do you know anybody?” She said Hardly Art and I looked into it. After interviewing a bunch of managers and smaller labels, it just seemed like a match made in heaven. It’s also a full-circle thing for me and the Northwest.\n\nI don’t mean to be “poor pitiful me,” but we were not accepted in Seattle. People hated our guts. Sub Pop didn’t like us and there were people there that made it known they didn’t like us. So to be on a label that’s at all connected with Sub Pop feels good. Things have changed. And not to be goofy, but I look at it with an open heart. To feel like we’re being championed is great.\n\nBree Hardly Art has this huge resurgence of feminist-based bands right now. It’s funny because when Tacocat got started nine years ago we didn’t feel accepted in Seattle either.\n\nEmily Seattle sucked.\n\nBree Beard rock and bro-punk ruled the scene. Everyone said our lyrics were stupid—“They’re singing about their bodies and UTIs!”\n\nKathleen Oh my god—the basement song! I fucking love that song [“Hey Kids, Its Basement”]. It’s genius. I was listening to it and I was like, she’s not talking about a basement, she is a basement.\n\nBree That’s a deep cut! I forgot about that.\n\nKathleen I’m taking my cues from you guys now. Like, if they get to do that, I get to do it, too. You don’t have to choose between humor and being serious.\n\nHow often do you get asked about specific lyrics? Or how often do you get asked about what kind of bass you play? I mean—what kind of bass do you play?\n\nBree A budget Yamaha.\n\nKathleen Do you get asked about your bass playing a lot in your interviews?\n\nBree No.\n\nEmily With every album we do it’s a little more complex. It’s like, oh, this album’s not as feminist as your last one. I’m like, everything I do is feminist—if I’m talking about horses or pizzas or whatever.\n\nKathleen Le Tigre is not as angry as Bikini Kill. Me and Johanna [Fateman], my writing partner, wrote a song that was like, “Sing that song about how you think you’re gonna spank me! We liked you a lot better when you’re angry!” Because it was like, we liked you when you were angry. You can’t evolve.\n\nBree To be an active artist you have to keep growing and changing.\n\nEmily And at the same time, when we first started there were other bands who were like, it’s your responsibility to write songs that are not about cats!\n\nKathleen I love your songs about cats! I felt the same exact thing, where it was like, you’re not as feminist anymore, you’ve softened up. I’m like, how do you fucking know? You haven’t lived in my skin.\n\nIf you at all stick your neck out in a song or you say anything political in an interview, then you get held to a standard that’s 1,000 times higher than anybody else. I understand why women in bands were like, no. I was never like, everybody has to be a riot grrrl. I was like, fuck that. I don’t even like that name necessarily. I never called myself that. But now we’re held to this standard that nobody else is held to. If you’re just a guy band and you sing about rainbows and unicorns, it’s fine. But if I do it, I’m not being feminist enough. Do you guys get that?\n\nEmily All the time. When we played the Bernie Sanders rally in Seattle there were randos on our Instagram that were like, you should be supporting a woman for President. Really? Because we’re women?\n\nBree And it’s such a bummer because there’s all these garage bands in our scene that are all male and they don’t get that stuff put on them.\n\nKathleen It almost makes me wish I started writing songs about cats at the very beginning, you know? I was kind of a douchebag about other women in bands who were not being as didactic because I felt everything fell on our shoulders. But I see why people would say, “Don’t call me a feminist.” Because when you do that and you assert it, you’re never gonna get asked about your voice, you’re never gonna get asked about your bass playing…\n\nBree Your Yamaha!\n\nKathleen Your shitty Yamaha! For this record, I just hope people ask me about my lyrics and my writing. I’ve been a songwriter for 25 years—somebody please ask me about it!\n\nSinging-wise, do you find for a particular record or time period you’re being influenced by a couple particular people?\n\nEmily Definitely. Sometimes I can’t listen to music at all when we’re recording because I will ape whatever’s around me out of sheer nervousness. Like, I’m gonna sing like Belinda Carlisle now, I guess.\n\nKathleen Yeah, you can’t listen to the Go-Go’s before you record.\n\nEmily No, you can’t do that. [Laughs] But I’m more influenced by our surroundings and conversations. Like our last album was just, like, beach party! But that’s not the climate right now. Seattle is kind of falling apart, our scene is squeezing in—it’s that sort of growing-up time where it didn’t feel like everything needed to be sunny.\n\nKathleen What do you think about reverb and shit on your voice? Do you do any of that?\n\nEmily On this album we were recorded and produced by this guy named Erik Blood. He was so interesting because I was so used to recording, like, just press record, punch it in.\n\nKathleen You had doubles and stuff on this, yeah.\n\nEmily For this one it was more like, “Sing it all the way through, start to finish.”\n\nBree Do you double your vocals?\n\nKathleen I do in parts. A lot of times, if a chorus needs some oom-pah-pah. But I don’t double the whole way typically. But some of the best stuff I’ve ever done has been doubled in a way where the verses were doubled but you couldn’t tell because it was mixed so well.\n\nBree We’d never worked with a producer before. Most of our recording was done by the guitar player in our band. Eric [Randall] records stuff.\n\nEmily We recorded Shame Spiral in our practice space and Eric’s bathroom! Since you’re feeling better [Hanna has Lyme disease] for this album, did that change how you were writing the lyrics? Or change the sound?\n\nKathleen Well, I have brain damage.\n\n[Laughter]\n\nKathleen I actually do, a little bit, from the Lyme disease. Hopefully the pathways in my brain will chill, but I have to look away sometimes when I talk to people and I have a tendency to not be able to follow through on a thought or remember why I’m in a room. It’s just this residual damage. It’s also from the drugs I’ve had to take to get through it. So hopefully when I’m completely off of everything I can kinda work my way back. But there’s been some nerve damage in my head—sometimes I use the wrong word for the wrong thing. I’ll look at something and I know it’s a toaster but I’ll accidentally say it’s a tracksuit. I’ve just decided to use it to my benefit. It’s nice to singlyrics where I don’t know what it is and let it become something and not over-shape it and overthink it. I feel like I can be more abstract and in the end, I’m saying what I want to say.\n\nI have another question. You know Gillian Anderson was a punk rocker, right?\n\nBree I saw that in a comment somewhere…\n\nKathleen I remember finding that out in the ’90s. She’s from Canada and I don’t think she was in a band but I’ve seen pictures of her with a Mohawk.\n\nEmily I have a picture of her with really long hair in my living room, a black and white photo. I love her so much.\n\nKathleen You guys should try to contact her.\n\nEmily and Bree She tweeted at us!\n\nBree We were on this 12-hour drive on tour in the Midwest and it was snowing and we were miserable, cold and tired and then Gillian Anderson tweets at us, “Hot damn, Scully has her own song!” And then linked to us. And we were like, this just made our life.\n\nKathleen I fuckin’ love that! So what was it like when you started? You said there were issues in the scene.\n\nBree I didn’t appreciate a lot of the comments we got early on as a band. I think people just didn’t understand—\n\nEmily —that talking about sex or anything to do with your body is not an invitation. Or that our band name is not supposed to be, like, “taco pussy!”\n\nBree We were going on DIY basement tours and people would yell “Taco pussy!” Or “Take off your clothes!”\n\nEmily “Take off your shirt!” To which our guitar player takes off his shirt every time.\n\nBree Whenever there were some women or allies or cool people who were just not jerks we’d be like, “We’re gonna play with you.” And we toured so much we created this network of really good friends around the country.\n\nKathleen Like Chastity Belt?\n\nBree Yeah! We met them when they were living in Walla Walla. Randomly the bass player is our good friend’s little sister and she’s the one who set up that show.\n\nEmily And then they came to Seattle and it was so good. We also played the first Shannon and the Clams show in Seattle.\n\nBree We kept meeting all these cool ladies and some of them ended up moving to Seattle, like Lisa Prank from Denver…\n\nKathleen It started to be a scene. You have some support.\n\nEmily But it did take awhile. I still get told how to hold my microphone by guys.\n\nKathleen That’s so insane!\n\nBree We have a song called “Men Explain Things to Me.”\n\nThere’s these two bands in Seattle—one of them is Boyfriends, they have a song called “Future Is Female.” And then Pony Time has a song called “Kathleen Hanna.” You should listen to it, it’s so good.\n\nKathleen Is it nice? There’s a lot of not-nice ones I’m kind of scared of.\n\nBree It’s so nice. It’s a great song. They don’t really get lumped in with us as much, but it’s important to be like, these are men and allies who are feminists.\n\nKathleen It’s really important.\n\nBree And it needs to be focused on. This is how the world is changing. It’s such an important step.\n\nKathleen That was not something we were seeing in the ’90s. There weren’t a lot of allies.\n\nEmily Yesterday we were talking about whether it’s still necessary to have “Top Female” lists.\n\nKathleen “Hottest Female Guitar Player.”\n\nBree I got a super-old copy of the The Rocket from ’89 or something from a thrift store and there was a Women in Rock issue. It was done well and there was a whole editorial about, do we still need to do this? Yes, it sucks, but we still kinda do.\n\nEmily And that was in ’89.\n\nKathleen And you’re thinking, did this just come out last week?\n\nBree It’s the same conversation!"
