I'm Terry Gross.\n\nMy guests, Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman, are co-founding members of the\n\nband Le Tigre. The band just released a new EP called \"From the Desk of Mr.\n\nLady.\" Here's the first track, \"Get Off the Internet.\"\n\n(Soundbite of \"Get Off the Internet\")\n\nLE TIGRE: (Singing) It feels so '80s, or early '90s, to be political. Where\n\nare my friends?\n\nGet off the Internet!\n\nI'll meet you in the street.\n\nGet off the Internet!\n\nDestroy the right wing.\n\nGet off the Internet!\n\nI'll meet you in the street.\n\nGet off the Internet!\n\nDestroy the right wing.\n\nGROSS: Music by Le Tigre.\n\nThe riot-grrrl movement that started in the early '90s produced girl bands\n\nwith a punk sensibility and a feminist attitude. Kathleen Hanna and Johanna\n\nFateman of Le Tigre were important members of that movement. In the days when\n\nHanna fronted the band Bikini Kill, she was considered one of the founders of\n\nthe riot-grrrl movement. The movement spread through 'zines as well as music.\n\nJohanna Fateman writes 'zines about music, art and culture.\n\nLe Tigre is touring in Japan right now. From their ...(unintelligible) first\n\nCD, here's a song called \"What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?\"\n\n(Soundbite from \"What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?\")\n\n(Soundbite of birds, guitar)\n\nMs. KATHLEEN HANNA (Le Tigre): We've talked about it in letters, and we've\n\ntalked about it on the phone. But how you really feel about it, I don't\n\nreally know.\n\n(Soundbite of synthesizer)\n\nMs. JOHANNA FATEMAN and Ms. HANNA: (Singing, in unison) What's your take on\n\nCassavetes? What's your take on Cassavetes? What's your take on Cassavetes?\n\nWhat's your take on Cassavetes?\n\nMs. HANNA: Misogynist.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Genius.\n\nMs. HANNA: Misogynist.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Genius.\n\nMs. HANNA: Misogynist.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Genius.\n\nMs. HANNA: Misogynist.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Genius.\n\nMs. FATEMAN and Ms. HANNA: (Singing, in unison) What's your take on\n\nCassavetes? What's your take on Cassavetes?\n\nGROSS: Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, welcome to FRESH AIR. Let's start\n\nwith \"What's Yr Take on Cassavetes?\" Why don't you tell us how this song\n\ncame about, particularly the lyric?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Hi, this is Johanna. Well, with \"What's Yr Take on\n\nCassavetes?,\" it was kind of a series of incidents or coincidences that led to\n\nthis song. I work at an art gallery, and there was a group show of visual\n\nartists sort of grouped together based on the filmmaking practices of\n\nCassavetes. And so I was reading all the stuff about Cassavetes. And,\n\nmeanwhile, Kathleen and Sadie--well, you should tell this part, Kathleen.\n\nMs. HANNA: This is Kathleen. Sadie and I happened to hook up in Paris,\n\nFrance. It was very glamorous. And we wanted to go see a movie, and what was\n\nplaying but \"Husbands\" by Cassavetes. And we went to see it and we just had,\n\nlike, all these conservations about, you know, `Is the misogyny in this movie\n\ncalling attention to, sort of, like, white middle-class men's, like, spiritual\n\nvacancy, and stuff like that? Or is it just being a part of it?' Because we\n\nboth felt really gross after the movie, but we also loved it in this weird\n\nway. And when we started talking about how many different kinds of art and\n\nmusic we feel that way about, that it's, like, they're something really icky\n\nabout it, but we still are attracted to it. And how can you constantly be\n\nnegotiating that in your mind about everything as a feminist. And so we\n\nstarted writing that song.\n\nAnd then, we also wanted to bring up the point of me, Sadie and Johanna's sort\n\nof intellectual friendships with each other. Because at the beginning of the\n\nsong, there's, like, a girl in a telephone booth. You can hear sea gulls and\n\nstuff like that in the background. And we've kind of set it up to be a\n\ntypical, you know, Shangri-La type thing, where, you know, one girl's calling\n\nanother, you know, and being, like, `Oh, I love that man so much. I'm going\n\nto die without him,' or whatever. And then it's really one woman calling\n\nanother being, like, `What do you think about Cassavetes? I really need to\n\nknow.'\n\nGROSS: Well, I think it's really ambitious to write a song about your\n\nambivalent feelings about a film director, your ambivalent feelings about\n\ncertain art. It's hard to write a song about that.\n\nMs. HANNA: Not for us. That's what we talk about all the time.\n\nGROSS: Well, it's certainly not typical to write a song about that.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I think that's part of what we wanted to do with the song, was\n\nto overturn that expectation that it was going to be about typical pop song\n\nfare of, you know, love relationships or whatever, having a good time at a\n\nparty or what--I don't know, whatever common themes are. So we wanted to\n\naddress this idea of, like, what's a critique and what's a participation.\n\nGROSS: Kathleen, you're considered one of the originators of riot-grrrl\n\nmusic. I think most artists really hate labels. So let's start with--are you\n\ncomfortable with that expression?\n\nMs. HANNA: I'm definitely comfortable with being labeled a `feminist\n\nartist.' Like, I kind of hate the fact that everybody's so freaked out about\n\nbeing labeled. I'm sick of reading it in everybody's interviews. You know,\n\nevery single interview is, like, `Don't put me in a box. I don't want to be\n\nlabeled.' And it's--like, I'm really happy when I see people who are, like,\n\n`I'm a lesbian, and I'm really proud of it.' You know what I mean? And,\n\nlike, `Go ahead, label me, because that's something that, like, gives other\n\npeople pride and gives other people a feeling of inclusion.' So in terms of,\n\nlike, feminism I'm definitely down to say I'm a feminist. Riot-grrrl is a\n\nspecific branch of feminism, but I wouldn't call myself a riot-grrrl just\n\n'cause I don't go to meetings anymore.\n\nGROSS: What was it when you were involved with it, and what was its meaning\n\nfor you?\n\nMs. HANNA: It was sort of, like, you know, '70s feminist art groups a lot,\n\nwith a certain, like, outreach element of, like, you know, doing actions like\n\nbeing involved in protests and stuff like that, and planning benefit shows\n\nfor, like, rape crisis shelters, helping out individual women in the sort of\n\npunk music scene, skill sharing, stuff like that. It was really--it meant a\n\nlot to me. I mean, it was a really exciting time when it started in DC just\n\nto be a part of these meetings and see these girls who had never been in a\n\nroom only with women before, you know, saying things that maybe they'd never\n\nsaid and saying things, certainly, that I'd never said to anyone.\n\nGROSS: Well, I'm wondering if, you know, having started out with riot-grrrl\n\nmusic, if you felt that some of that music was appropriated by mainstream\n\ngroups and by mainstream pop culture, say groups like the Spice Girls or TV\n\nshows like \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer.\"\n\nMs. HANNA: I don't think the music was ever appropriated, because probably to\n\nmainstream listeners, it's just too confrontational and unlistenable and has\n\ntoo many cuss words in it. But it definitely--I think certain people who are\n\ninterested in graphs and charts and marketing saw that bands like Bikini Kill\n\nand Bratmobile and now Sleater-Kinney were making, you know, a living on\n\nsmall independent labels with absolutely, like, no advertising money, you\n\nknow. And, like, if we're able to do that, they were like, `What if we put a\n\nwhole bunch of money behind something that sort of takes the content out of\n\nit, takes the abrasiveness out of it and, yet, has this sort of, you know,\n\n\"girl power\" message, or whatever, and put that into the world? We could make\n\na lot of money.'\n\nAnd, you know, whatever. All the `Girls Rules' T-shirts started happening,\n\nand we--a lot of riot-grrrls used to write stuff on themselves, you know,\n\nlike, names that were, like, derogatory towards women, like on our arms or on\n\nour stomachs if we wearing a short top, sort of as a commentary.\n\nGROSS: Like `slut.' Like you had `slut' on your stomach.\n\nMs. HANNA: Yeah, like, stuff like that. And it was sort of--part of the\n\noriginal reason was when I started being photographed, I felt like I was\n\nsilenced by the photograph. You know what I mean? Like, I would get my\n\npicture taken and they could write absolutely anything over it, under it,\n\nwhatever. And now it's kind of depressing because I'm, like, `Oh, I was\n\nbeating people to the punch.' You know what I mean? Like, `Oh, that's what\n\nmen are going to think if they see me, and so I'm going to beat them to the\n\npunch by writing this and say, \"I know you're thinking that,\"' which I think\n\nwas interesting for a minute, but I'm not kind of interested in that thing\n\nanymore.\n\nBut the basic point is that then they start having T-shirts that said `slut.'\n\nAnd who are the people who own these companies? Probably men--Do you know\n\nwhat I mean?--who are making money off of this, like, now pseudorebellion and\n\nwhatever. I just find it annoying and boring, and I don't spend a lot of time\n\nthinking about it. I just kind of keep working. And if there are, like,\n\nfive-year-old girls who get sort of a feminist type vibe off of the Spice\n\nGirl's girl power, great.\n\nGROSS: My guests are co-founders of the band Le Tigre, Kathleen Hanna and\n\nJohanna Fateman. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: Let's get back to our interview with two members of the band Le\n\nTigre, Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman.\n\nNow, Kathleen, I read--and you can tell me if this is true--that when you were\n\nin school, you starred in a production of \"Annie.\"\n\nMs. HANNA: Yes, that is true. I was Annie. My school couldn't really\n\nafford props and sets and stuff, and they also had to have something with a\n\nmale lead to be fairer, I guess. So it was sort of a combination of \"Annie\"\n\nand \"Oliver.\" I don't know how they did it. And then it was, like, I had a\n\nstuffed dog instead of a real dog for Sandy. It was really bad.\n\nGROSS: So did you have to sing \"The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow\"?\n\nMs. HANNA: I sure did.\n\nGROSS: Now that's a really different kind of singing than the singing you're\n\ndoing on your records now.\n\nMs. HANNA: Not really. I mean, the thing that's interesting is when I first\n\nstarted out, or whatever, everybody said I sounded like Polystyrene from X-Ray\n\nSpecs. And I had never heard her. And then I listened to X-Ray Specs, and I\n\nwas like, `Oh, it's because we both project.' Like--and I learned that from,\n\nlike, my many years of children's theater. And I always wondered if Polly\n\nalso had done a little, you know, \"Annie.\"\n\nGROSS: A little theater in her day?\n\nMs. HANNA: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: See, I thought you meant when you started singing in \"Annie,\" people\n\nsaid that you sounded like Polystyrene. I thought that was pretty funny.\n\nMs. HANNA: Oh, I wish.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. I'm going to play something, Kathleen, that you did with the\n\nband Bikini Kill early in your music career. And this is called \"Rebel\n\nGirl,\" and it's considered, like, one of the anthems of riot-grrrl music.\n\nAnd tell us something about writing this song.\n\nMs. HANNA: Well, I lived in DC at the time, and there was just a lot of\n\nexcitement 'cause women's groups were starting and there were a lot of bands\n\nthere. And--I don't know. At that point, I didn't feel like I had to write\n\nsongs. I just felt like I had to reach up into the air and grab them. And\n\nthis was one of the ones I sort of reached up into the air and grabbed. It\n\nwas, like, a scene of people wrote it. I didn't really write it. I just was\n\nthe person who actually put the pen to the paper.\n\nGROSS: OK. This is \"Rebel Girl,\" Bikini Kill, featuring my guest, Kathleen\n\nHanna.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. HANNA: (Singing) That girl thinks she's the queen of the neighborhood.\n\nShe's got the hottest Jag in town. That girl, she holds her head up so high.\n\nI think I want to be her best friend. Yeah!\n\nRebel girl, rebel girl. Rebel girl, you are the queen of my world. Rebel\n\ngirl, rebel girl. I think I want to take you on, I wanna try a new approach.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nMs. HANNA: (Singing) When she talks, I hear the revolution. In her head,\n\nthere's revolution. When she walks, the revolution's coming. In a\n\n(unintelligible) what is the revolution?\n\nRebel girl, rebel girl. Rebel girl, you are the queen of my world.\n\nGROSS: That's \"Rebel Girl,\" from the band Bikini Kill, that my guest Kathleen\n\nHanna used to be in. And Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman are my guests.\n\nTheir new band is called Le Tigre.\n\nYou've both talked about the importance of feminism in your life and in your\n\nmusic. How were you exposed to that? And I'm wondering if your mothers were\n\nfeminists.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: My mom's a feminist, definitely. I mean, I grew up in Berkeley,\n\nCalifornia, which, you know, is a university town and sort of famous for being\n\na place where, you know, radical politics are and are talked about. So I feel\n\nlike I was exposed to radical ideas when I was really young.\n\nGROSS: And Kathleen?\n\nMs. HANNA: I grew up in suburbia--in various suburbias. My family moved a\n\nlot. We moved every, like, three years. My dad worked for the union, for\n\nLocal 669, pipe fitters and welders. And my mom has always been a nurse at\n\nvarious, like, mental health facilities. My mom was kind of, like, a secret\n\nfeminist. Like, she didn't really--you know, it wasn't like we had, like,\n\nany Bohemian friends or--you know what I mean? Like, pretty much the books in\n\nour house were, like, romance novels and detective novels. But my mom worked\n\nin this sort of, like, clandestine domestic violence shelter, and I didn't\n\nremember this until a couple of years ago. I just remember her kind of\n\nsneaking out of the house to this--I think it was, like, an Episcopal church\n\nthat had a, you know, crisis phone line thing in the basement, and she would\n\ngo there every so often and do that.\n\nAnd she got Ms. magazine, and she took me to Solidarity Day in DC when I was,\n\nlike--I don't know--10 or something, and we saw Bella Abzug speak. And all\n\nthese women were wearing, like, T-shirts that said, you know, `A woman needs a\n\nman like a fish needs a bicycle.' I was just caught up in the total frenzy of\n\nit, as, like, a little kid being like, `Look at all these women,' and it was\n\nlike the outside world, you know. And the fact that there were all these\n\nwomen banding together and, like, yelling stuff, it just really had an\n\nimpression on me, and hearing Bella Abzug speak was like--I couldn't believe\n\nit.\n\nGROSS: A lot of girls, when they're preteens, go through this phase of--it's\n\nthe `Oh, he's so cute' phase, where, like, you listen to music and you're\n\nsupposed to have, you know, `Oh, he's so cute' fantasies about the guys who\n\nyou're listening to and so on. And I'm wondering if you ever related to music\n\nthat way. For example, now, you know, like, if you see clips of, say, an 'N\n\nSync concert, it's almost all preteen girls in the audience, and they're kind\n\nof screaming and, you know, obviously having all these really important\n\nfantasies to them about the guys who are in the band. Did you relate to music\n\nthat way at all when you were 11, 12, 10?\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I was, like, six or something, I was really into Donny Osmond.\n\nThat was my first concert. And I went and I screamed myself totally hoarse.\n\nBut, you know, I think I really wanted to be Donny. That was the real issue\n\ngoing on. I wasn't like--and, I mean, I actually wrote more love letters to\n\nMarie than I ever did to Donny, because I was really kind of obsessed with\n\nher, but I felt like it was more acceptable to channel my, you know, fake love\n\nenergy into Donny. But I was also really into Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco\n\nFamily and would imitate his singing style, along with the records.\n\nGROSS: Do you think about the impact of your music and your presence on stage\n\nmight have for your youngest fans, what it might mean in their lives?\n\nMs. HANNA: I thought about it once in Italy with Bikini Kill when there were\n\nthese, like, seven-year-old girls sitting by the monitors. I just thought,\n\n`Oh, they're going to be in therapy when they're, like, 35,' `And there's this\n\ngirl and her face is all red and she was screaming these crazy things, and\n\npeople were saying she's a man-hater and I don't know. Is it a dream,\n\nDoctor?' But I just think I would really like to have been young and gone to\n\na concert and seen Jo on stage singing and playing keyboards, and I would\n\nreally like to go to a concert when I was younger and see me in all my beauty\n\nand sexual glory and fabulous singing style on stage. So I get really happy\n\nabout it. You know, I think that people are pretty incredible and that they\n\ndon't really need me to become amazing people, but if I'm someone there who\n\nreminds them that they're really cool, then that's great.\n\nGROSS: I'm glad you mentioned your sexual glory. What kind of sexual energy\n\ndo you want to communicate on stage? Because that's often a really important\n\npart of pop music and of concerts.\n\nMs. HANNA: I'm just, like, a really sexually powerful person in general.\n\nMaybe that's a, you know, bragging thing to say, but it's like, I get what I\n\nwant, and I have a good time, and it's like I really get annoyed--well, I got\n\nannoyed in Bikini Kill when it was like--it was never women that said this\n\nstuff. It was always guys who were like, you know, `Well, how can you be a\n\nfeminist? Because, like, you're sexy,' and it's like, I'm sexy when I'm\n\neating a veggie burger, you know what I mean? So, like, what am I going to\n\ndo? Like, just turn it off? Am I being really funny, Jo? I have to brag.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: No, it's fine. I mean, it's never gone down this road in an\n\ninterview before.\n\nMs. HANNA: You haven't been to some of the interviews where I've gone down\n\nthis road.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: I guess not.\n\nMs. HANNA: No, but, I mean, I think it's like we're all, like, totally sexual\n\nbeings and it's like, I really hate the idea that if you're a feminist or\n\nsomething, you're supposed to shut that off, because people see that as\n\nantithetical to your politics or something, and that's ridiculous.\n\nGROSS: Well, Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, I thank you both so much for\n\ntalking with us.\n\nMs. HANNA: Thank you.\n\nMs. FATEMAN: Thank you.\n\nGROSS: Kathleen Hanna and Johanna Fateman are co-founders of Le Tigre. From\n\ntheir new EP, here's a track called \"They Want Us To Make a Symphony Out of\n\nthe Sound of Women Swallowing Their Own Tongues.\" You may recognize a voice\n\nthat's sampled on the track, Ray Suarez of public radio and TV.\n\n(Soundbite of \"They Want Us To Make a Symphony Out of the Sound of Women\n\nSwallowing Their Own Tongues\")\n\nUnidentified Man: Well, what about...\n\nMr. RAY SUAREZ: What is it that younger women are pushing up against? They\n\nwould seem to have a list of options to choose on--choose from, a set of ways\n\nto construct their own identity that takes in everything. It's just a vast\n\nsmorgasbord. The options are not as narrow as they might have been 30 years\n\nago. So where does the problem lie now?\n\nLE TIGRE: Um, um, um, um, I think that--um--and um--and um--and um--and\n\nu--u--u--um--and u--u--um--um--and u--u--and it--and it--and it--and it--and\n\nit--'cause it there--um--and it--and it--'cause it there--there--and um--\n\nobviously--'cause it there--and um--and um--'cause it there.

Ed\n\nHarris also directed the film. \"Pollack\" is opening in many cities this month\n\nand next. Film critic Henry Sheehan has a review.\n\nHENRY SHEEHAN reporting:\n\nIf you know anything at all about the abstract expressionist painter Jackson\n\nPollack, there's no real reason for you to go out and see \"Pollack.\"\n\nContinuing the trend that surfaced in Julian Schnabel's \"Basquiat\" and James\n\nIvory's \"Surviving Picasso,\" \"Pollack\" has little to do with painting as\n\npossible.\n\nThe focus instead is on celebrity melodrama. Although actor-director Ed\n\nHarris' filmmaking style turns out to be rudimentary, he does manage to open\n\nthe movie with a shot that eloquently compresses his interests. It begins on\n\nan issue of Life magazine with a photo spread on Pollack. The magazine is\n\nbeing held in the hand of an unknown woman who, in slow motion, begins to make\n\nher way through a crowd of people in what turns out to be an art gallery. She\n\nfinally ends up in front of Pollack, who gives her an autograph and then looks\n\nup and off into the distance with a sphinxlike gaze.\n\nSince we're in an art gallery, there are some paintings in the shot, though\n\nthey are only fuzzily glimpsed in the background. For what we're about to see\n\nis a tale of the painter as rock star, the boozing and womanizing figure\n\nbeloved of a thousand adoring magazine profiles.\n\nThe movie opens in 1941 with Pollack living in Manhattan and on the eve of\n\nboth his artistic breakthroughs and public acclaim. We see him as he meets\n\nand marries fellow artist Lee Krasner, played by Marcia Gay Harden, and passes\n\nthrough a final figurative stage in his art. Finally, at a Long Island\n\nhideaway far from the city's boozy distractions, Pollack discovers the drip\n\ntechnique that would secure both his contemporary fame and artistic\n\nimmortality.\n\nTo express all this, the film falls back on the hoariest of bio pic cliches.\n\nIt depicts Pollack's drip technique as the consequence of an accidental spill.\n\nKrasner delivers clumsily scripted potted descriptions of Pollack's influences\n\nand developments and the critic, Clement Greenberg, played by Jeffrey Tambor,\n\noccasionally heaves into sight to pronounce on the modernism of it all.\n\nBut \"Pollack\" does tell us something about the Motion Picture Academy and the\n\nupcoming Academy Awards. Here's a clip of Oscar nominees Harris and Harden.\n\n(Soundbite of \"Pollack\")\n\nMr. ED HARRIS (\"Jackson Pollack\"): Let's make a baby.\n\nMs. MARCIA GAY HARDEN (\"Lee Krasner\"): No.\n\nMr. HARRIS: No? Am I missing something here? Am I missing something?\n\nMs. HARDEN: We can't.\n\nMr. HARRIS: We can't?\n\nMs. HARDEN: My life is full enough with you, Jackson.\n\nMr. HARRIS: Wait a minute, wait a minute, where are you going? Don't walk\n\naway from me. We're husband and wife. I want to have a baby, our baby.\n\nThat's what the--that's what the progression of things is about. That's what\n\nthe union is about.\n\nMs. HARDEN: That's not what the union is about.\n\nMr. HARRIS: Well, what else is there?\n\nMs. HARDEN: That's not what it's about, Jackson.\n\nMr. HARRIS: For me.\n\nMs. HARDEN: The vows don't stipulate baby.\n\n(Soundbite of something crashing)\n\nMs. HARDEN: I am not going to bring another life into that. We are\n\npainters, Jackson. We don't have any money. We don't get by. We struggle.\n\nBut you are a great artist. I believe in Jackson Pollack. There's you and\n\nthere's the painting and you--you need, you need, you need, you need.\n\nSHEEHAN: \"Pollack\" doesn't just fulfill the conventions of a Hollywood artist\n\nbiography. It's also a guide to the sort of overacting the academy eats up.\n\nLike a bat to a bug, the movie relentlessly swoops down on the most\n\nmelodramatic aspects of Pollack's life, particularly those moments when he\n\nexpressed rage or Krasner announced her frustrations. Each time Harris and\n\nHarden cut loose with theatrical explosions that are more geared to reach the\n\nsecond balcony than to actually expose complex and creative personalities.\n\nWhen not shouting at the gallery gods, Harden spends much of the movie\n\nfussing. Not a prop goes by that she doesn't handle. Since Harris directed\n\nthe film, he doesn't have to do much to attract the camera's attention.\n\nFrequently he goes into a freeze, standing still and pulling that 10-mile\n\ngaze. Invariably the camera finds this posture irresistible and rushes up to\n\nrecord it.\n\nIt's possible to make a good film about a painter. There's Alexander\n\nKorda's \"Rembrandt\" and Vincente Minnelli's \"Lust for Life.\" But those\n\nfilms connected at least as much with the artist's work as with the biography.\n\nHarris is fatally distracted by Pollack's life, or at least the parts that\n\nglitter with the tinsel of picturesque suffering.\n\nGROSS: Henry Sheehan is film critic for the Orange County Register.\n\n(Credits)"
