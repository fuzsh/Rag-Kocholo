        "text": "Kathleen Hanna has very solid indie rock credentials. She fronted the 1990's feminist punk band Bikini Kill, a group that is credited with creating the Riot Grrl movement. Fans responded to Hanna's punk zine writing, the lyrics of the songs and Bikini Kill's uncompromising attitude and energy as a live band. Hanna went on to form Le Tigre later in the '90s. Also, she's married to Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) of the Beastie Boys. Hanna recorded a lo-fi solo album as Julie Ruin in 1998 when she was between bands, and in 2010 The Julie Ruin became a full-fledged group. Their second album, Hit Reset, is all about quirky rhythms and edgy pop songs, and a fun listen all the way through."
