The Julie Ruin, featuring Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, are streaming their ‘Hit Reset’ LP in full ahead of its release on the 8th July.

The autobiographical record follows Hanna through her childhood, illness and her feminist activism that pushed her to the forefront as a pioneer of the riot grrrl movement in the 90s.
