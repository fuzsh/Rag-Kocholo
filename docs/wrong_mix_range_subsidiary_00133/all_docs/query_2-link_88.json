        "text": "Soon after he began considering a run for Colorado governor in December, Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper spoke to his close friend Greg Maffei. The Liberty Media Corp. chief executive said he thought the job was a good fit for Hickenlooper and urged him to run.\n\nIt was one of several conversations with key individuals that helped persuade Hickenlooper to join the race.\n\nThis one was unusual, however, because Hickenlooper is a Democrat and Maffei is one of the state’s top fundraisers for Republican candidates. Hickenlooper said he has turned to Maffei for counsel on a variety of issues, ranging from managing the Democratic National Convention in Denver to balancing family and career.\n\n“He will often point out to me when I’m going down a path that’s ill-advised. He’s not cautious. Blunt is a better description,” Hickenlooper said. “He knows the most about the greatest number of things of anyone I know. He’s a lightning-fast thinker.”\n\nIn just over four years here, the former chief financial officer for Microsoft has established himself as a force in the local business and political communities — which is remarkable considering the low public profile taken by Liberty founder and chairman John Malone. Maffei has done it by helping take Liberty to new heights through a series of sales and acquisitions, chairing John McCain’s presidential campaign in Colorado and befriending an A-list of powerful Coloradans, all while helping raise four kids and skiing 20-plus days a season.\n\n“It’s unfair,” said Hickenlooper, who skis, golfs, drinks beer and spends family time with Maffei. “He has found a way to manufacture five to six extra hours in a day.”\n\nSlopes and soccer balls\n\nIt’s a Saturday afternoon atop Vail. Three of Maffei’s children — an 11-year-old boy and 7-year-old twin boy and girl — are skiing with the racing club that brought up gold medalist Lindsey Vonn. His oldest son, age 13, is back home where, having chosen competitive soccer over ski racing this year to the slight befuddlement of his father, he has a game. He’s staying with the nanny.\n\nMaffei’s wife, Sharon, is off in the Colorado backcountry, training for an upcoming ski-trekking trip in Switzerland with a group of women. That evening the Maffeis will go out to dinner with friends; Sunday they’ll ski with the kids and picnic on the mountain.\n\nMaffei strikes up conversations easily with skiers on the chairlift, whether it’s a young girl racing with the club or an East Coast transplant from Boulder who’s telling him which runs to ski. Maffei, who has been described over a 25-year career as brilliant, ambitious, stubborn and quick-tempered, takes it all in good humor.\n\nAfter skiing trees and moguls at Blue Sky Basin in the morning with Jeff Kirwood, a former Liberty executive, Maffei is ready for something steep and smooth. A recently groomed black run does the trick. Maffei drops in after Kirwood and barrels down, making Super-G turns.\n\nMaffei is an experienced and passionate sailor — he won a junior championship as a boy on Long Island, N.Y., and sailed big boats when he lived in Washington state — but he didn’t ski intensively before coming to Colorado.\n\nAt the bottom of the slope, Maffei is all smiles, and he remarks on how much he enjoys hitting speed on a broad, pitched ski run. His son calls during the lift ride up.\n\n“How did it go?” Maffei asks. “How good is that team? Who scored? Are you happy with how you played? . . . Congratulations on the tie.”\n\nSuited to work-family lifestyle\n\nLiberty Media’s neo-classical granite headquarters on the plains of northern Douglas County, built before Maffei joined the company in late 2005, seems well-suited to his work-family lifestyle.\n\nMaffei often travels to New York or Los Angeles for a day or two during the workweek, except on his three to four annual international trips, ensuring he’s usually in town on weekends. An access road connects Liberty to hangars less than a quarter-mile away at the southeast end of Centennial Airport. Maffei lives a few miles away in Cherry Hills Village.\n\nFounded in 1991, Liberty controls or holds investments in a dizzying array of businesses, including Sirius XM Radio, Live Nation Entertainment, Expedia.com, and the QVC and Starz cable networks.\n\nWith a market value of $15.2 billion, Liberty is one of the world’s largest media companies. It was hit hard by the financial crisis and recession but has bounced back strongly. Analysts consider it one of the media industry’s success stories.\n\nThat success was less clear when Malone lured Maffei, whom he knew from his days at Microsoft, from a short and turbulent turn as president of Oracle. Liberty was regarded by many investors as too complex to comprehend and value. Worse, investors didn’t have to own Liberty to try to achieve its results — they could simply buy the same stocks Liberty owned.\n\nMaffei accelerated a process that Liberty had already begun to sell investments in which it held minority stakes and make acquisitions in companies in which it could take control. He also executed Malone’s plan to divide Liberty’s assets into three groups with individual tracking stocks.\n\nThe groups comprise interactive and e-commerce companies; cable programming and film production interests; and other assets, including Sirius XM, Live Nation and the Atlanta Braves baseball team.\n\nWhile these moves were important, bigger still were two deals that Maffei and Malone pulled off last year, analysts said.\n\nIn February 2009, Liberty bought a 40 percent stake in Sirius XM in exchange for $530 million in loans to help the pay-radio company avoid bankruptcy. Sirius’ stock has since risen fourfold, although it’s still trading below a dollar. Liberty’s share of Sirius’ $3.3 billion market value is $1.32 billion.\n\n“To make that deal at the nadir of the economy was bold,” said Matthew Harrigan, a Denver-based analyst with Wunderlich Securities. “But it worked. The business really turned around.”\n\nIn November, Liberty spun off its 54 percent stake in satellite-television leader DirecTV into a new company. DirecTV’s shares have risen 42 percent since the deal was announced in May, which Maffei said was a major benefit for Liberty shareholders.\n\n“Our goal has been to deploy our capital smartly into businesses that make sense,” Maffei said. “Primarily that has been in the media space but also in the adjacent areas of technology and telecom in companies that we like, that we know something about, that are well positioned for the future and that hopefully we can add some value to.”\n\nThe thinker, the negotiator\n\nMalone remains Liberty’s key strategic thinker and Maffei is the lead negotiator, observers said. Maffei has a reputation as a shrewd and sometimes stubborn dealmaker. Malone’s level of involvement in Liberty varies, but he still engages intensely at times, Maffei said. They speak or meet daily.\n\n“They’re a very effective team,” said Brian Deevy, chairman and CEO of RBC Daniels in Denver, and who has close ties to both men. “John is always very strategic in what they do. Greg is very good in executing and getting deals done.”\n\nMaffei said he’s also proud of some less visible accomplishments at Liberty. The company had no female executives when he joined and now has three. He has expanded a corporate giving program that benefits at-risk youths and has added employee-friendly programs such as wellness/fitness classes. In short, it’s a better place to work and a better local corporate citizen, he said.\n\nNot all Liberty efforts have worked out well under Maffei.\n\nHe lost a public battle with Barry Diller in 2008 over IAC/InterActive- Corp, Diller’s conglomerate of e-commerce brands in which Liberty has a long-standing stake. Diller prevailed for control of IAC in a court battle that laid bare their antagonistic relations.\n\nLiberty’s investment in Live Nation, the leading concert promoter and ticket-seller, so far hasn’t gone according to plan. Liberty owned just over 14 percent of Live Nation after it merged with Ticketmaster in January. It announced plans to acquire up to 35 percent of the company, but its shares quickly rose above what Liberty was willing to pay.\n\nTop 5 percent of his class\n\nMaffei grew up on Long Island, and his family later moved to Massachusetts, near Boston. He attended the Groton School before going to Dartmouth College for his bachelor’s degree and Harvard University, his father’s alma mater, for his master’s in business administration. He graduated from Harvard in the top 5 percent of his class.\n\nHe started a career in finance on Wall Street in the mid-1980s working for the investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. and later worked for Citicorp Venture Capital.\n\nCiti sent Maffei to Seattle in the early 1990s to run its troubled Pay ‘N Pak home-improvement chain. He jumped to Microsoft in 1993 after Pay ‘N Pak went bankrupt and closed. He rose to become Microsoft CFO in 1997, cutting a series of complex deals including a $1 billion investment in Comcast, the $425 million purchase of WebTV Networks and a $150 million investment in Apple.\n\nIn 1999, he left Microsoft to run 360networks, a fiber-optic cable company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Maffei raised $4 billion for 360networks but took it into bankruptcy in 2001 as capital dried up, said 360networks CFO and vice chairman Chris Mueller, who has known Maffei since the mid-1980s.\n\nMaffei was aggressive in Chapter 11, making purchases that would later bring windfalls to 360networks, Mueller said.\n\n“A strong attribute of Greg’s is his ability to recognize value, take risk and execute on that,” Mueller said. “While Greg was here, we purchased approximately $4 billion in distressed telecom assets for less than $100 million.”\n\nMaffei headed to Oracle in 2005, where he was co-president and CFO. But when it appeared Maffei wouldn’t succeed Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, Maffei accepted Malone’s offer to run Liberty in Denver.\n\nMirroring Maffei’s high-flying career has been his political activity. He’s a conservative who supported McCain going back at least to the late 1990s.\n\nGreg and Sharon Maffei gave $135,600 to McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign, among the biggest contributions to the candidate in Colorado, and Maffei raised more than $500,000 for McCain through other sources. He was one of just 11 people in Western states who raised that much.\n\nMaffei was a key adviser to McCain’s campaign on business issues and met with him at his ranch in Sedona, Ariz., said Deevy, also a big Republican donor.\n\n“Everybody says they’re close to the guy, but Greg actually traveled with him and was a legitimate adviser,” Deevy said.\n\nA question surrounding Maffei is how long he will stay at Liberty, and in Denver. His ties to Seattle remain strong. Until 2007, he was a trustee of the Seattle Public Library, which he helped put in a new building, and he and his wife return frequently to see friends.\n\nMaffei said he is happy and challenged at Liberty, and his family feels at home in Denver.\n\nGreg Griffin: 303-954-1241 or ggriffin@denverpost.com\n\nGreg Maffei at a glance\n\nLiberty Media president and CEO\n\nAge: 49\n\nHome: Cherry Hills Village\n\nFamily: Wife Sharon; 13- and 11-year-old sons, 7-year-old twin boy and girl\n\nGrew up: Long Island, N.Y., and eastern Massachusetts\n\nEducation: AB, Dartmouth College; MBA, Harvard University\n\nCompensation: $12.2 million in 2008; $9.2 million in 2007; and $6.4 million in 2006\n\nActivities: Sailing, skiing, golf, tennis and running, and his children’s sports\n\nWork history: Financial positions with Dillon, Read & Co., Citicorp Venture Capital and Pay ‘N Pak, mid-1980s to 1993; Microsoft treasurer, VP and CFO, 1993-2000; 360networks, CEO, 2000-05; Oracle, co-president and CFO, 2005; Liberty Media president and CEO, 2005-present.\n\nBoards: DirecTV, Electronic Arts, Sirius XM, 360networks and zillow.com\n\nA Liberty Media Primer\n\nDouglas County-based Liberty Media Corp. comprises three business units, each with its own independent tracking stock.\n\nLiberty Interactive\n\nInterests in QVC cable shopping network; Provide Commerce, parent of ProFlowers.com and other websites; Backcountry.com; Bodybuilding.com; IAC/InterActive Corp; Expedia; BuySeasons, a distributor of Halloween costumes and party supplies; and Lockerz .com, a social networking and e-commerce website geared toward young people.
