        "text": "Integrate.com of Denver, Colorado USA won the Stevie Award for Best New Company of the Year at The 2011 American Business Awards. Here we look at how this new company achieves its goals.\n\nIntegrate claims to be the first advertising marketplace of its kind. It is making waves in the online marketing industry by offering a technology that combines a wide array of distribution sources with multiple campaign models in order to serve every type of advertiser in their quest for new customers.\n\nFollowing are four ways that Integrate.com is living up to its name.\n\n1. Uniting Distribution Sources\n\nIntegrate’s advertising marketplace is a media-buying dashboard. It unites every type of distribution source: websites, mobile publishers, television networks, national and local radio syndicates, billboard sources, online and offline yellow pages, email marketers, newspapers, magazines, and more.\n\n2. Connecting with Media Sources\n\nAdvertisers in more than 65 different B2B and B2C verticals can easily create\n\ncustomized, performance-marketing campaigns. At the click of a button they connect with hundreds of media sources—a process that historically takes days is reduced to minutes. Put simply, the Integrate platform allows one person to do the job of an entire team, from any place with an Internet connection.\n\n3. Providing Multiple Pay-Per-Performance Models\n\nIntegrate caters to many performance-based pricing models where advertisers and merchants pay only for the qualifying leads, customers, or inbound phone calls they receive. Integrate pay-per-performance models include Cost-per-Lead, Cost-per-Acquisition, Cost-per-Inbound-Call, and Cost-per-Live-Transfer. Integrate claims to be the first platform to combine all of these options into one system.\n\n4. Matching Campaigns with Fulfillment Sources\n\nIntegrate also provides a proprietary matching technology to streamline the media transaction process. Upon joining the marketplace, advertisers and publishers create custom profiles highlighting important details about their companies and their areas of expertise. The Integrate technology uses this information to automatically match campaigns with the fulfillment sources most likely to deliver the best results.\n\nCommitment to Quality\n\nIntegrate maintains a commitment to quality from the moment a partner applies to its community and throughout every interaction that takes place on its platform. All applicants undergo a strict approval process to ensure that only the most reliable partners have a presence. Stringent quality-control filters are applied throughout the campaign-creation process, implementation, and delivery. Integrate aim is to introduce ethics and accountability into the performance marketing space.\n\nBridging the Gap Between Publishers and Advertisers\n\nIntegrate is not just an advertising marketplace, but also a community. It provides a semi-transparent environment that bridges the gap between publishers and advertisers. Both parties can review one another’s vital business data—including credit and trade reference reports, campaign performance statistics, strengths, and weaknesses­—before deciding to collaborate. Parties communicate with one another through the Integrate Messaging Center. Using Integrate’s mediation tools, advertisers and publishers can directly discuss any quality-and-return issues that may arise.\n\nSince its launch in February 2010, Integrate has united more than 3500 advertisers and publishers, and provided the technology behind more than 2500 marketing campaigns. It received its first round of funding from Foundry Group in December 2010.\n\nSaid Jeremy Bloom, co-founder of Integrate.com: “We are committed to remaining on the forefront of marketing technology­—providing businesses with a cutting-edge solution for their marketing needs. Winning the Stevie Award for Best New Company proves that what we are offering is appreciated in the industry.”\n\nAbout Jeremy Bloom:\n\nJeremy Bloom is Co-Founder of Integrate. Through his vision, Integrate achieved impressive scale from the beginning. Bloom specializes in moving fast and making an impact. His focus and motivation provide unbeatable inspiration for his team.\n\nBloom began his career in professional athletics, both as an Olympic Skier and NFL Football player. In addition to his athletic and business accomplishments, he launched a nonprofit foundation, Jeremy Bloom’s Wish of a Lifetime, which grants wishes to 80, 90 and 100+ year old people across the country.\n\nAbout Integrate.com:\n\nIntegrate.com offers a unified media-buying dashboard that allows advertisers in B2B and B2C verticals to create custom marketing campaigns. Integrate unites a variety of media sources including Internet, print, radio, TV, and mobile. Its core services range from Cost-per-Lead and Cost-per-Acquisition to Cost-per-Inbound-Call and Live Transfer.

Creating your first email can be daunting. As we all know, business owners just don’t have the extra time in their day that it takes to do this. But if you keep reusing your template it will take less and less time, and when you are comfortable making changes to it, you can try new things and add to it to get a better response.\n\nA lot of people don’t know where to start when it comes to creating content. The answer is to use what you have. Why not feature a customer and whether he/she likes the experience of using your product or service? If you’ve recently won an award or received a great review, that’s another thing you can highlight. You can even have a sale around an upcoming holiday or an create an event for one. The more you think about all you do in your business, the more you’ll realize you’ve got a ton of ideas to write about or share via photos and videos.\n\nSocial media is a great way to extend the life of your email marketing campaign. Make sure you include “follow us” links so that your email recipients have yet another way of getting your messages. In addition, you’ll want to include links to Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn in your email campaigns so that your recipients will share them with their own followers. Doing this spreads the word fast!\n\nWhat item of news recently caught your eye and why?\n\nThe Pope is Tweeting! Gotta love it.\n\nDo you have a favorite app?\n\nMy favorite iPhone app is Shazam. I’m always amazed that the app will pretty flawlessly tell you who is singing a song!\n\nIf you could choose another profession, what would it be?\n\nI once wanted to be an MTV veejay, but now I’m not even sure whether that profession still exists!\n\nWhat quality or qualities do you most value in your business associates?\n\nHonesty is the quality I most value in any business associate, whether it is someone inside my company or on the outside. I love it when people tell me they simply “don’t know” rather than faking it. And I love doing business with companies who are honest and open with their customers.\n\nWhat do you think is the worst bad habit to have at work?\n\nClipping your nails. Kidding! I think the worst bad habit to have at work is avoiding the big projects that need to be done. Simply put: procrastination. I do it, we all do it, but getting your arms around it when you detect it’s happening and changing your behavior is always a good thing. And half the time you build up that “big” project in your mind, but when you get into it, it’s not really that big.\n\nAs someone at the top of your profession, what keeps you inspired or makes you hit the ground running in the morning?\n\nMy people and my customers always inspire me. Our mission is to help small businesses and non-profits grow by providing easy-to-use online marketing tools. So when a customer tells me that something our team produced helped them grow—whether it be a phone call, an email, or a piece of technology—I’m happy all the way around.\n\nAbout Janine Popick:\n\nJanine Popick, CEO and Founder, started VerticalResponse in 2001, when email marketing was catching on for larger businesses but still out of reach for small businesses. She realized that developing simple-to-use, cost-effective Web-based tools would make email marketing affordable and practical for small businesses—and that has been the company’s mission ever since.\n\nIn her spare time, Janine is CEB (Chief Executive Blogger) for the award-winning VerticalResponse Marketing Blog for Small Businesses. Prior to founding VerticalResponse, she led direct and Internet marketing programs for some of the biggest brands in technology and entertainment, including NBC Internet; XOOM.com; Claris, a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple Inc.; and Symantec Corporation.\n\nAbout VerticalResponse:\n\nVerticalResponse Inc. is a leading provider of self-service email marketing, social media, online surveys, and direct-mail services empowering small businesses and nonprofit organizations to easily create, share, and analyze their own marketing campaigns. Users can benefit from a wide variety of features including more than 700 free email marketing templates in a variety of categories; plus the ability to share their content over several social media networks; and tracking on everything from email marketing to social media responses so that they can understand campaign success. VerticalResponse offers customers an integrated Web-based marketing solution that’s intuitive and affordable. VerticalResponse is headquartered in San Francisco, Calif.

There are many different types of categories to choose from, including overall excellence awards, management awards, public relations awards, marketing awards, new product awards, IT awards, web site awards, and more.\n\nThe entry kit, with complete instructions on how to choose categories, prepare and submit entries, is available online.\n\nSo here are those 10 reasons why you should get it in gear and submit an entry or two to this year's International Business Awards:\n\n1. Entering the IBAs is a cost-effective way to thank and honor your valued employees and to build or burnish your brand.\n\n2. The entry fees are nominal compared to the publicity boon your firm can reap when you become a Distinguished Honoree medalist or a Stevie® winner.\n\n3. Small organizations have just as much chance to win a Stevie as big companies do. Every year, household-name companies such as BT, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever are joined in the winners' circle by small and medium-size organizations that are still building their brands.\n\n4. There are dozens of categories covering every aspect of work life, from management and finance, to marketing and public relations, to product development, customer service, and human resources.\n\n5. If you’re an advertising agency, marketing consultancy or media production company, your work will be reviewed and honored by potential clients, not just your competitors, and there are many categories for ad campaigns, web sites and blogs, smartphone and tablet apps, annual reports, video productions, and other media.\n\n6. Many of the world's top business executives will review your nominations during the judging process.\n\n7. Honorees will be announced on July 11, so you'll know three months before the awards event what you've won.\n\n8. When you win a Stevie Award you’ll get to make a 30-second acceptance speech…before an audience of 400+ executives from around the world…during an internationally-broadcast awards dinner…that will also be streamed worldwide over the Internet. This year's event will be a star-studded affair in Abu Dhabi, UAE on October 11.\n\n9. The Stevie Award is 16 inches tall, is hand-cast and finished in 24-karat gold. Made by the same company that makes the Oscar, the Emmy, and other major awards, it is one of the world's most coveted prizes.\n\n10. As an honoree you'll get a range of free tools that you can use to promote your award.\n\nSo, are you planning to enter the IBAs this year?\n\nThe Stevie Awards today announced that Russell Simmons, an entrepreneur and philanthropist best known as the co-founder of Def Jam Recordings, will be honored with its Difference Maker award at The 9th Annual American Business Awards ceremony on June 20 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in New York City.\n\nThis honorary award is the first of its kind and will be presented to Simmons for his groundbreaking vision and influence on music, fashion, finance, television and film, as well as the face of modern philanthropy. The annual gala, which will be attended by more than 600 executives, will be hosted by Fox News Channel business reporter Cheryl Casone.\n\n“Russell Simmons is the personification of the American business spirit,” said Stevie Awards President Michael Gallagher. “His approach to building businesses for the future -- which are both sustainable and philanthropic -- has instigated change in corporate America. He has the kind of vision as a business leader that not only makes a difference, but creates a path that inspires others to follow and that’s why we are proud to honor him with this award.”\n\nNamed one of USA Today’s “Top 25 Most Influential People,” the New York City-born Simmons created Def Jam Recordings in 1984 with partner Rick Rubin, signing forerunners of the hip-hop movement like the Beastie Boys, LL Cool J and Public Enemy. From creating his seminal Def Jam, to the 2007 publishing of his New York Times best-seller Do You! 12 Laws to Access the Power in You to Achieve Happiness and Success and his latest New York Times best-seller SUPER RICH: A Guide To Having It All, Simmons expanded his personal vision far beyond the music world to create a varied business empire with RUSH Communications, a leading multi-faceted holding company with investments in prominent and respected brands in entertainment & media, fashion & lifestyle, finance and empowerment industries.\n\nWidely recognized as the premier business awards program in the U.S., The American Business Awards honor organizations and individuals in a wide variety of categories -- from management and public relations to technology, human resources, new products and more.\n\nJudges of The American Business Awards include many of the leading figures in American business.\n\nAbout The Stevie® Awards\n\nStevie Awards are conferred in four programs: The American Business Awards, The International Business Awards, the Stevie Awards for Women in Business, and the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service. Honoring organizations of all types and sizes and the people behind them, the Stevies recognize outstanding performances in the workplace worldwide.
