        "text": "\"SuiteWorld 2023\" included several major announcements from Oracle NetSuite. One such announcement was the latest updates to NetSuite Analytics Warehouse (NSAW), the first and only AI-enabled, pre-built cloud data warehouse and analytics solution for NetSuite customers.\n\nThe latest updates will help organizations improve data management so customers can quickly build analyses to increase efficiencies and reduce costs, better understand their customers, and leverage data to innovate and grow faster.\n\nNetSuite Analytics Warehouse now is available to customers in North America, Israel, the U.K., Ireland, Spain, France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Philippines and Singapore.\n\nEvan Goldberg, co-founder and EVP of Oracle NetSuite, says today's organizations need to make sense of the vast volumes of data they create, which can often be an extremely complex and time-consuming task.\n\n\"NetSuite Analytics Warehouse changes all this by combining data from many applications and leveraging AI to recognize patterns and turn that data into actionable insights,\" Goldberg says. \"Creating a single source of truth and applying the latest advancements in AI helps our customers quickly unlock value from their data and turn it into a business advantage that drives growth.\"\n\nBuilt on Oracle Analytics Cloud and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), NetSuite Analytics Warehouse leverages AI to harness business data and accelerate value creation.\n\nIt consolidates and centralizes data, including NetSuite transactional data, historical data, and data from other cloud or on-premises applications. It then guides the business user on their path to actionable insights.\n\nThe latest updates to NetSuite Analytics Warehouse provide the following:\n\nAnalytics Embedded in User Dashboards — Customers now can add links to essential and frequently-used visualizations from NetSuite Analytics Warehouse to NetSuite dashboards. Customers can efficiently track key metrics and drill into charts based on NetSuite data blended with other relevant systems' data. This gives direct access to the comprehensive insights needed for data-driven decisions without the need to toggle between applications.\n\nMore Frequent Data Refreshes — New data pipeline settings give customers more current insights into their financial, sales, and inventory activity. Customers now have greater flexibility to schedule the frequency and time of data refreshes to get more value from their data.\n\nEnhanced Analysis of Financial Data — The new financial analysis subject area helps customers analyze financial activity from different angles and incorporate more business systems data to identify areas for P&L improvement. The new budget subject area helps to track and adjust resource allocation with budget versus actual scenario analysis.\n\nDeeper Insights — New line-level details enable customers to analyze below summary level into key revenue-impacting subject areas like sales orders and inventory activity. This provides deeper access to role-based business insights and encourages data-backed decision-making across the organization.\n\nImproved User Access Management — New Single Sign-On simplifies user authentication with a single login to NetSuite and NetSuite Analytics Warehouse. In addition, all customers have greater flexibility in applying user view and access rights to analytic content. New roles and dimensions, such as department, subsidiary, and sales territory, enable a user, for example, to view a dashboard chart but not the underlying transaction detail.\n\nCustomer Success with NetSuite Analytics Warehouse\n\nNetSuite Analytics Warehouse is helping organizations across industries consolidate and enhance their data with AI-backed insights.\n\nBirdRock Brands offers high-quality goods for the home, outdoors, pets, kitchen, holidays, and the office. With thousands of orders daily, BirdRock uses NetSuite Analytics Warehouse to calculate and forecast profitability, track inventory in motion and forecast warehouse capacity.\n\n\"NetSuite Analytics Warehouse helps us elevate our business intelligence by delivering impactful visualizations into our business processes,\" says Mark Chuberka, NetSuite Administrator, BirdRock Brands. \"With thousands of daily orders and ever-evolving requirements for inventory, website development, sales, and business planning, the AI features in NetSuite Analytics Warehouse help us make more informed decisions based on patterns and customer insights.\"\n\nOverture Promotions helps brands build creative promotional marketing programs. Overture uses NetSuite to support its end-to-end in-house services, spanning supply chain management, e-commerce, inventory management, warehousing and packaging.\n\nOverture Promotions CFO Brian Lisinski says it is not enough just to have data. \"We need to be able to pull insights from that data to drive improved business outcomes. With NetSuite Analytics Warehouse, we gain predictive insights from our sales trends, channels and product lines to inform our supply chain plans and make proactive decisions to increase customer satisfaction. In short, NetSuite Analytics Warehouse helps us turn data into decisions.\"\n\nTerlato Wine Group, a multi-generational family business that markets and distributes fine wines and artisanal spirits, uses NetSuite Analytics Warehouse to enhance decision-making and gain the insights it needs to deliver premium beverages from world-class producers to customers.\n\n\"Before using NetSuite Analytics Warehouse, we were overly reliant on spreadsheets and manually adjusting data, but as our product portfolio expanded, we knew this was not sustainable,\" says Chris Janes, head of integrated enterprise systems at Terlato Wine Group. \"NetSuite Analytics Warehouse brings together all our data and leverages AI to provide clear insights to help us better understand sales trends and ensure resources are allocated to key growth areas. NetSuite has been a game changer, providing the strategic insights and new features we need to stay nimble as we grow.\"\n\nNew features in NetSuite Analytics Warehouse will be released in all available countries within the next twelve months.\n\nTo learn more about how organizations leverage NetSuite's power to increase efficiency and drive growth, you can register for SuiteWorld On-Air to get all the latest updates from SuiteWorld.\n\nOn-air attendees can access keynotes, sessions, demos and NetSuite's two-day live broadcast, NetSuite TV.\n\nFootnotes and Disclosures:\n\nContent within this feature (including the headline graphic) has been adapted from source materials furnished by Oracle NetSuite.
