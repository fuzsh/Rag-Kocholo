Membership in the College can never be more than 1% of the total lawyer population of any state or province, and fellowship in the College is extended by invitation only to those experienced trial lawyers who have mastered the art of advocacy and whose professional careers have been marked by the highest standards of ethical conduct, professionalism, civility and collegiality.\n\nHe has also been recognized as a leading intellectual property lawyer by a number of publications, including Chambers USA; The Recorder, where they named him as one of the top two “go to” patent litigators in Northern California; and the Daily Journal who has named him not only as one of the “brain trust of 25 lawyers who comprise the state’s best and brightest” intellectual property lawyers in California, but as one of the “Top IP Litigators in California” for each year the list has been in existence.\n\nBob has also twice served on, once as chair of, the Northern District of California Patent Rules Committee, which issued revisions to the local rules for the management of patent litigation. These rules have served as a model and have been adopted in whole or in part by other judicial districts."
