Parties, Intervenors and Amici Curiae\n\nThe following is a list of all parties, intervenors and amici who appeared in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, and all persons who are parties or amici in this Court.\n\n1. Parties\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (Defendant-Appellant), United States of America (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of New York (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of California (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Connecticut (Plaintiff-Appellee), District of Columbia (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Florida (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Illinois (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Iowa (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Kansas (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Kentucky (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Louisiana (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Maryland (Plaintiff-Appellee), Commonwealth of Massachusetts (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Michigan (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Minnesota (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of New Mexico (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of North Carolina (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Ohio (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of Utah (Plaintiff-Appellee), State of West Virginia (Plaintiff-Appellee) and State of Wisconsin (Plaintiff-Appellee).\n\nThe State of South Carolina was a plaintiff in the district court but withdrew from the case during trial. It is not a party in this Court.\n\nPursuant to Rule 26.1 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure and D.C. Circuit Rule 26.1, Microsoft Corporation (\"Microsoft\") certifies that it has no corporate parents and that no publicly-held company owns 10% or more of Microsofts stock.\n\n2. Intervenors\n\nThe following persons were permitted to intervene in the district court for limited purposes: Bloomberg News, Bristol Technology, Inc., The New York Times Co., Reuters America, Inc., San Jose Mercury News, Inc., The Seattle Times, ZDNET and ZDTV, L.L.C.\n\n3. Amici Curiae\n\nThe following persons were permitted to participate as amici curiae in the district court: Association for Competitive Technology, Robert H. Bork, the Computer & Communications Industry Association, Lawrence Lessig, Robert E. Litan and the Software and Information Industry Association.\n\nBy Order dated November 3, 2000, this Court granted the following persons permission to participate as amici curiae in this Court: America Online, Inc., Association for Competitive Technology, the Center for the Moral Defense of Capitalism, the Computer & Communications Industry Association, the Computing Technology Industry Association, the Project to Promote Competition & Innovation in the Digital Age, the Software and Information Industry Association, the Association for Objective Law, Lee A. Hollaar, Carl Lundgren and Laura Bennett Peterson.\n\nB. Rulings under Review\n\nThe rulings under review are (i) the Final Judgment entered by the district court (Hon. Thomas Penfield Jackson) on June 7, 2000, and (ii) the Order entered by the district court on April 3, 2000 (save the portion of the Order dismissing the DOJs first claim for relief and the States fifth claim for relief). The Final Judgment is reported as United States v. Microsoft Corp., 97 F. Supp. 2d 59 (D.D.C. 2000). The April 3, 2000 Order, which accompanies the district courts conclusions of law, is reported as United States v. Microsoft Corp., 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000).\n\nThe district courts findings of fact are reported as United States v. Microsoft Corp., 84 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D.D.C. 1999). The district courts summary judgment decision is reported as United States v. Microsoft Corp., 1998-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 72,261 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1998).\n\nC. Related Cases\n\nThis case was previously before this Court as Nos. 98-5399 and 98-5400, which were consolidated on appeal. On August 10, 1998, various media organizations sought permission to attend pre-trial depositions pursuant to the Publicity in Taking Evidence Act of 1913, 15 U.S.C. § 30. The district court granted their motion on August 11, 1998. On January 29, 1999, this Court affirmed the district courts decision. This Courts decision is reported as United States v. Microsoft Corp., 165 F.3d 952 (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n\nA closely related case was previously before this Court as No. 97-5343. On October 20, 1997, the DOJ filed a petition seeking to hold Microsoft in civil contempt for violating a consent decree entered on August 21, 1995. On December 11, 1997, the district court declined to hold Microsoft in contempt, but entered a sua sponte preliminary injunction and referred the merits of the DOJs claims to a special master. United States v. Microsoft Corp., 980 F. Supp. 537 (D.D.C. 1997). On June 23, 1998, this Court reversed the district courts injunction and issued a writ of mandamus vacating the reference to a special master. This Courts decision is reported as United States v. Microsoft Corp., 147 F.3d 935 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n\nA related case was previously before the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit as No. 98-2133. On September 18, 1998, Microsoft subpoenaed the notes and other research materials collected by Professors Michael A. Cusumano and David B. Yoffie, who wrote a book entitled Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and the Battle with Microsoft. On October 1, 1998, Microsoft filed a motion to compel the production of those materials in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. That motion was denied. On December 15, 1998, the First Circuit affirmed the denial of Microsofts motion on the ground that the requested materials were immune from discovery under a so-called \"academic research\" privilege. That decision is reported as Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp., 162 F.3d 708 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nNo other related cases are pending in this Court or any other court.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nCERTIFICATE AS TO PARTIES, RULINGS AND RELATED CASES i\n\nA.

Microsofts Design of Windows Is Not an Unlawful Tie 69\n\nA. Windows Is a Single Product 69\n\n1. The District Court Erred by Refusing To Follow Circuit Precedent 70\n\n2. This Court Articulated the Correct Test for Evaluating Whether Windows and IE Are Separate Products 71\n\n3. Windows and IE Are Not Separate Products under This Courts Test 74\n\na. There Are Clear Benefits to Microsofts Integrated Design 74\n\nb. The Benefits Cannot Be Duplicated by Combining an Operating System with a Standalone Web Browser 76\n\nB. The Alleged Tie Did Not Foreclose Competition on the Merits in the \"Browser\" Market 80\n\nNo Forced Purchase of a Second Product 80\n\nNo Incompatibilities 82\n\nNo Distribution Foreclosure 83\n\nII. Microsoft Did Not Maintain a Monopoly Through Anticompetitive Conduct 83\n\nA. Microsoft Does Not Possess \"Monopoly Power\" in a Properly Defined Product Market 84\n\n1. The Relevant Product Market Is Not Restricted to \"Intel-Compatible PC Operating Systems\" 84\n\na. The District Courts Market Definition Excludes the Most Serious Competitive Threats to Windows 85\n\nb. The District Courts Market Definition Excludes Other Potential Substitutes for Windows 87\n\n2. Microsoft Cannot Control Prices or Exclude Competition 88\n\na. Microsoft Does Not Behave Like a Monopolist 89\n\nb. Market Share Is Not Determinative of Monopoly Power 92\n\nc. There Are No Significant Barriers to Entry 93\n\nB. Microsoft Did Not Engage in Anticompetitive Conduct 97\n\n1. The Inclusion of Internet Technologies in Windows Did Not Violate Section 2 101\n\n2. The Challenged Provisions of Microsofts OEM License Agreements Did Not Violate Section 2 102\n\na. Microsofts OEM License Agreements Simply Restate Its Rights under Federal Copyright Law 103\n\nb. Microsofts OEM License Agreements Did Not Foreclose Netscapes Distribution of Navigator 107\n\n3. Microsofts Agreements with IAPs Did Not Violate Section 2 109\n\n4. Microsofts Development and Marketing of Its Own Java Implementation Did Not Violate Section 2 111\n\n5. Microsofts Conduct Taken as a Whole Did Not Violate Section 2 112\n\nC. No Causal Link Was Shown between the Allegedly Anticompetitive Acts and the Maintenance of a Purported Monopoly 115\n\nIII. Microsoft Did Not Attempt To Monopolize the Alleged \"Browser\" Market 118\n\nA. Microsoft Did Not Engage in Anticompetitive Conduct 118\n\nB. Microsoft Did Not Act with a Specific Intent To Monopolize the Alleged \"Browser\" Market 119\n\nC. There Is No Dangerous Probability of Monopolization 121\n\n1. Microsofts June 1995 Discussions with Netscape Did Not Create a Dangerous Probability of Monopolization 122\n\n2. AOL Controls Over One-Third of IEs Usage Share 123\n\nIV. The District Courts Extreme Relief Is Unsustainable 125\n\nA. The District Court Improperly Entered a Sweeping Decree without a Hearing 125\n\nB. The Breakup of Microsoft Is Unwarranted as a Matter of Law 128\n\n1. The Breakup Is Unjustified Absent a Significant Causal Connection between Microsofts Conduct and Market Position 129\n\n2. The Breakup Extends Far Beyond What Is Necessary To Redress the Conduct Found To Be Anticompetitive 130\n\n3. The Breakup Is Unwarranted Because the Challenged Conduct Could Reasonably Have Been Thought Permissible 132\n\n4. The Breakup Would Jeopardize Important Public Benefits 133\n\n5. The Breakup Would Create Enormous Practical Problems Not Considered by the District Court 133\n\nC. The Other Extreme Relief Entered by the District Court Is Punitive and Not Justified by the Antitrust Violations Found 134\n\n1. The Decree Would Require Microsoft To Disclose Proprietary Information about Its Operating Systems to Its Competitors 135\n\n2. The Decree Would Interfere with the Design of Microsofts Operating Systems 137\n\nV. The District Court Committed Reversible Error in Its Handling of the Case 141\n\nA. The District Court Failed To Provide Microsoft with Adequate Opportunity To Prepare for and Defend against a Dramatically Expanded Case 142\n\nB. The District Court Created a Procedural Framework in Which Reliance on Hearsay Was Inevitable 144\n\nVI. The District Judges Public Comments Concerning the Merits of the Case Require That the Judgment Be Vacated and the Case Reassigned to Another Judge 146\n\nCONCLUSION 150\n\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES\n\n(Authorities on which Microsoft chiefly relies are marked with asterisks.)\n\nCASES\n\nA.A.

The district court had subject matter jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. § 4 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1337 and 1367(a). Microsoft filed its notices of appeal on June 13, 2000. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\n\n1. Whether Microsofts design of its Windows operating systems to include Web browsing software constituted a tie in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and corresponding state-law provisions.\n\n2. Whether Microsoft maintained a monopoly in the alleged market for \"Intel-compatible PC operating systems\" through anticompetitive conductprincipally its design of Windows and its promotion and distribution agreements with Internet access providersin violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and corresponding state-law provisions.\n\n3. Whether Microsoft attempted to monopolize the alleged market for \"Web browsers\" through anticompetitive conduct in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and corresponding state-law provisions.\n\n4. Whether the extreme and unwarranted relief entered by the district court without conducting an evidentiary hearing and without permitting Microsoft to develop and present evidence must be reversed.\n\n5. Whether the district courts handling of the case (e.g., its failure to provide Microsoft with adequate time for discovery and to prepare for trial, its limitation on the number of witnesses, its use of \"summary witnesses\" and the resulting admission of large amounts of inadmissible hearsay) requires that the judgment be vacated.\n\n6. Whether the district judges public statements about the merits of the case require that the judgment be vacated and the district judge disqualified from any further proceedings.\n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nThis case arises out of Microsofts competition with Netscape from 1995 to 1998the so-called \"browser war.\" In competing with Netscape to satisfy increasing demand for Internet functionality, Microsoft (i) developed new versions of its Windows operating system that included Internet technologies, (ii) distributed those technologies widely, and (iii) encouraged third parties to design their software products to take advantage of those technologies. Consumers clearly benefited from this competition. As the district court found, Microsofts conduct contributed significantly to (i) improving the quality of Web browsing software, (ii) lowering its cost, and (iii) increasing its availability. Microsofts inclusion of Internet technologies in Windows also benefited the thousands of software developers that create applications that run on the operating system. At the same time, nothing Microsoft did limited Netscapes ability to compete: Netscapes Web browsing software remained \"fully interoperable\" with Windows, and Netscape had unimpeded access to \"every PC user worldwide.\" In fact, Netscapes customer base grew dramatically during the period in question. To sanction Microsoft for improving its products and promoting and distributing them vigorouslyas the district court didwould stifle innovation and chill competition, contrary to the purposes of the antitrust laws.\n\nThe proceeding below went badly awry from the outset. When this case was filed in May 1998, then Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein said that the DOJ had embarked on a \"surgical strike,\" challenging Microsofts inclusion of Web browsing software in Windows. Steve Lohr, U.S. v. Microsoft: The Case, N.Y. Times, May 19, 1998, at A1. Over the next two years, however, the district court permitted plaintiffs to transform their case beyond recognition. As a result, what began as an attack on Microsofts addition of Internet technologies to Windows ended with an unprecedented order breaking up the companya completely unjustified outcome that no one could have imagined at the outset.\n\nThe district judges extensive public comments about the merits of the case epitomize his disregard for proper procedure. The day after judgment was entered, news organizations began publishing stories based on interviews with the district judge. Two New York Times reporters, who liberally quoted the district judge in a recently-published book, disclosed that he granted them interviews \"during the trial on the condition that his comments not be used until the case left his courtroom.\" Joel Brinkley & Steve Lohr, U.S. v. Microsoft 6 (2000). These \"friendly, informal and unstructured\" discussions were described as \"a rare audience with a sitting judge during the course of a trial.\" Joel Brinkley & Steve Lohr, Retracing the Missteps in the Microsoft Defense, N.Y Times, June 9, 2000, at C8. Following entry of judgment, the district judge embarked on a speaking tour, appearing at antitrust conferences here and abroad to discuss his views of Microsoft and his reasons for breaking up the company. The district judges public comments would lead a reasonable observer to question his impartiality andtogether with other procedural irregularitiesthe fairness of the entire proceeding.\n\nA. The Claims\n\nOn May 18, 1998, the DOJ and States filed separate complaints and motions for a preliminary injunction, alleging that Microsoft violated Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The States also alleged violations of their antitrust laws. (Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act and the States antitrust statutes are set forth in a separately-bound addendum.) Plaintiffs complaints contended that Microsoft unlawfully foreclosed Netscape from offering its Web browsing software, called Navigator, in an effort to protect Microsofts putative PC operating system monopoly. Plaintiffs asserted that Navigator could have become a competing \"platform\" to which applications like spreadsheets and word processors could be written, thus potentially reducing what plaintiffs viewed as the sole barrier to entry into the operating system business. DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 3-4, 7-9, 66-68; States Compl. ¶¶ 32-37. This so-called \"applications barrier to entry\" allegedly results from Microsofts success in encouraging independent software vendors (\"ISVs\") to create a large number of applications designed to run on Microsofts platformWindows. DOJ Compl. ¶ 3; States Compl. ¶ 35.\n\nPlaintiffs asserted two claims under Section 1. First, they alleged that Microsoft tied its Web browsing software, Internet Explorer (\"IE\"), to its Windows operating system. DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 134-37; States Compl. ¶¶ 93-95. This claim was the focal point of their complaints. DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 18-23, 103-23, 134-37; States Compl. ¶¶ 47-50, 54-69, 93-95. The alleged purpose and effect of this purported tie were \"to foreclose competing browsers\" from distribution by computer manufacturers (\"OEMs\"). DOJ Compl. ¶ 137. Second, plaintiffs alleged that Microsoft entered into unlawful exclusive dealing contracts with Internet service providers (\"ISPs\"), online services (\"OLSs\") and Internet content providers (\"ICPs\") for the promotion and distribution of IE. DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 130-33; States Compl. ¶¶ 96-97. Plaintiffs further alleged that Microsofts license agreements with OEMs were \"exclusionary\" because they did not allow OEMs to make modifications to Windows that purportedly would have made users more likely to use Navigator. DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 93-102, 130-33; States Compl. ¶¶ 96-97.\n\nPlaintiffs also asserted two claims under Section 2. First, they alleged that Microsoft unlawfully maintained a monopoly in a market for \"PC operating systems.\" DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 138-39; States Compl. ¶¶ 85-87. Second, they alleged that Microsoft attempted to monopolize a market for \"Internet browsers.\" DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 140-41; States Compl. ¶¶ 88-90. Plaintiffs premised their Section 2 claims on the same conduct that underlay their Section 1 claims. DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 75-123; States Compl. ¶¶ 54-78. Their only additional allegation of anticompetitive conduct under Section 2 was their contention that Microsoft attempted on June 21, 1995 (without success) to induce Netscape not to compete in the alleged \"Internet browser\" market. DOJ Compl. ¶¶ 70-74; States Compl. ¶¶ 44-45.\n\nThe relief requested by plaintiffs likewise focused on distribution and promotion of Web browsing software. As the district court noted, plaintiffs sought to enjoin Microsoft from:\n\n(1) entering into or enforcing certain contractual provisions which allegedly foreclose distribution and/or promotion of competing Internet browsers; (2) distributing a \"bundled\" version of its operating system and browser unless Microsoft provides a practical way of removing browser functions and provides OEMs that do not wish to license the browser an appropriate deduction from the royalty fee; (3) distributing a \"bundled\" version of its operating system and browser unless Microsoft treats Netscape Corporations (\"Netscape\") browser the same as its own with respect to inclusion and removal; and (4) retaliating against any OEM that chooses to remove Microsofts browser from Windows 98.\n\n1998-2 Trade Cas. (CCH) ¶ 72,261, at 82,668 (D.D.C. Sept. 14, 1998). Plaintiffs did not mention, much less seek, dissolution of Microsoft or any of the other extreme relief ultimately awarded.\n\nB. Pretrial Proceedings\n\nThe district court advanced trial on the merits and consolidated it with the hearing on plaintiffs preliminary injunction motions. 5/22/98 Order. Over Microsofts objection, the district court scheduled trial to begin on September 8, 1998, less than four months away. 5/22/98 Tr. at 31-32. The district court also limited each side to 12 \"summary witnesses\" in its case in chief, required that all direct testimony be filed in writing and imposed strict limits on the use of deposition testimony. 6/9/98 Tr. at 2; Pretrial Order No. 1 ¶¶ 11, 12; Pretrial Order No. 2 ¶ 4. The district court clearly envisioned an abbreviated trial focused on plaintiffs tying claim, stating, \"I am prepared to devote the month of September to the trial of this case.\" 6/9/98 Tr. at 3.\n\nFollowing this Courts June 23, 1998 decision in the Consent Decree Casewhich rendered plaintiffs tying claim legally untenableplaintiffs raised a variety of new allegations, seeking to convert their tightly-focused case into an omnibus Section 2 action. This expansion of the case became apparent in August 1998 when, without amending their complaints, plaintiffs began pursuing in discovery new accusations concerning Microsofts interactions with Sun, Intel, Apple, RealNetworks and IBM. Over Microsofts objection, the district court pressed ahead with its plan for a highly-expedited trial, assuring Microsoft that it \"would not be making any findings\" and \"would not predicate any relief\" on matters unrelated to the conduct challenged in the complaints, 9/17/98 Tr. at 7, assurances it would later repudiate.\n\nC. The Rulings Below\n\nDespite Microsofts motion for a continuance, trial began on October 19, 1998, five months after the complaints were filed. The parties concluded their cases-in-chief on February 26, 1999 and presented rebuttal evidence between June 1 and June 24, 1999.\n\nThe district court issued findings of fact on November 5, 1999. 84 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D.D.C. 1999). Although 412 paragraphs long, the district courts findings contain no citations to the record, making it impossible to ascertain the purported basis for many findings. The most inculpatory \"findings\" consist of sweeping, conclusory assertions, unfounded inferences and speculative predictions masquerading as \"facts.\" E.g., id. at 111-12 (FF 411-12). In commenting to the New York Times on the harsh tone of his findings, the district judge explained his judicial philosophy towards Microsoft as follows:\n\nI like to tell the story of the North Carolina mule trainer . . . . He had a trained mule who could do all kinds of wonderful tricks. One day somebody asked him: \"How do you do it? How do you train the mule to do all these amazing things?\" \"Well,\" he answered, \"Ill show you.\" He took a 2-by-4 and whopped him upside the head. The mule was reeling and fell to his knees, and the trainer said: \"You just have to get his attention.\" I hope Ive got Microsofts attention.\n\nBrinkley & Lohr, supra at 278. In making its findings, which adopted nearly all of plaintiffs factual assertions, the district court ignored vast amounts of uncontradicted evidence submitted by Microsoft on the central issues in the case.\n\nAfter the failure of an intense four-month mediation before Chief Judge Posner, the district court entered its conclusions of law on April 3, 2000. 87 F. Supp. 2d 30 (D.D.C. 2000). (Holding that the relevant state-law provisions are coterminous with Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, id. at 54-55, the district court reached the same conclusions under federal and state law.)\n\nTying. The district court held that Microsoft violated Section 1 by tying IE to Windows. Id. at 47-51. In so ruling, the district court refused to apply the test set out by this Court in United States v. Microsoft Corp., 147 F.3d 935 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Stating that it was obliged to follow this Courts rulings only \"until the trail falters,\" the district court concluded that this Courts \"undemanding test\" is \"inconsistent with the pertinent Supreme Court precedents,\" 87 F. Supp. 2d at 47, even though, in formulating its test, this Court expressly distinguished the two cases cited by the district court, Jefferson Parish Hospital District No. 2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984), and Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Technical Services, Inc., 504 U.S. 451 (1992). 147 F.3d at 946-47, 950.\n\nExclusive Dealing. The district court rejected plaintiffs exclusive dealing claim under Section 1, holding that Microsofts promotion and distribution agreements for IE \"did not foreclose enough of the relevant market to constitute a § 1 violation.\" 87 F. Supp. 2d at 53. The district court explained:\n\nMicrosofts multiple agreements with distributors did not ultimately deprive Netscape of the ability to have access to every PC user worldwide to offer an opportunity to install Navigator. Navigator can be downloaded from the Internet. It is available through myriad retail channels. It can (and has been) mailed directly to an unlimited number of households.\n\nId. (emphasis added). The district court determined that Netscape was able to distribute 160 million copies of Navigator in 1998 alone, contributing to an increase in Navigators installed base from 15 million in 1996 to 33 million in December 1998. Id. Although distribution foreclosure was also central to plaintiffs Section 2 claims, the district court contended that the failure of the agreements to foreclose enough of Navigators distribution \"to constitute a § 1 violation in no way detracts from the Courts assignment of liability for the same arrangements under § 2.\" Id.\n\nMonopoly Maintenance. The district court held that Microsoft possesses monopoly power in a market for \"Intel-compatible PC operating systems\" and that Microsoft maintained that monopoly by anticompetitive means in violation of Section 2. Id. at 35-44. According to the district court, Microsofts alleged monopoly is protected by a single barrier to entrythe \"applications barrier to entry.\" Id. at 36. For anticompetitive conduct, the district court relied primarily on Microsofts purported exclusion of Navigator from two specific channels of distributionthe OEM and Internet access provider (\"IAP\") channels, id. at 39-42despite finding that Netscape had access to \"every PC user worldwide,\" id. at 53. The other challenged acts, while not themselves anticompetitive, were held to have \"supplemented Microsofts efforts in the OEM and IAP channels.\" Id. at 43.\n\nAttempted Monopolization. The district court found that Microsoft attempted to monopolize the \"browser\" market in violation of Section 2 based largely on the same allegedly anticompetitive conduct. Id. at 45-46. Despite acknowledging that Microsofts intent was to persuade ISVs that Navigator would not emerge as the \"standard\" Web browsing software, the district court reasoned that Microsoft possessed the requisite specific intent to obtain monopoly power because \"there is no evidence that Microsoft tried\" to prevent its efforts \"from achieving overkill.\" Id. at 45. The district court also determined that Microsofts discussions with Netscape in June 1995 created a dangerous probability of monopolization, even though Microsoft had not yet released Windows 95 and thus had no share of the alleged \"browser\" market at the time. Id. at 45-46. The district court stated that Microsoft has since \"revived the dangerous probability\" of monopolization because IEs share of browser usage has \"risen above fifty percent,\" id. at 46even though AOL, which acquired Netscape during trial, could reduce IEs usage share substantially by building AOLs proprietary client software on Navigator instead of IE.\n\nD. The Final Judgment\n\nThe district courts order accompanying its conclusions of law stated that it would enter relief \"following proceedings to be established by further Order of the Court.\" Id. at 57. The district court thereafter held two chambers conferences to discuss the remedies phase of trial. At both conferences, Microsoft stressed that it could not take a position on the appropriate procedure to be employed until it received notice of plaintiffs proposed relief. 4/4/00 Tr. at 14-16, 18; 4/5/00 Tr. at 7-8. When Microsoft asked whether it \"contemplate[d] further proceedings,\" the district court replied, \"Yes. Yes. I would assume that there would be further proceedings,\" adding that it might \"replicate the procedure at trial with testimony in written form subject to cross-examination.\" 4/4/00 Tr. at 8-9, 11. The district court subsequently issued Scheduling Order No. 8, which required Microsoft to submit only (i) its \"summary response\" to plaintiffs proposal, (ii) its \"counter-proposal(s)\" to the plaintiffs request, and (iii) its \"recommendations for future proceedings on the issue of remedy.\" Scheduling Order No. 8 at 2.\n\nOn April 28, 2000, plaintiffs filed their proposed decree, together with six lengthy declarations and numerous new exhibits. Although their complaints did not even hint at such draconian relief, plaintiffs requested that Microsoft be broken up. Proposed Final J. § 1. Plaintiffs proposed decree also included equally extreme \"conduct\" provisions that extended far beyond the case that was tried and encompassed products wholly outside the markets defined by the district court. Id. § 3. For example, plaintiffs requested that Microsoft be required to disclose proprietary information about its desktop, server and embedded operating systems to all firms claiming a desire to make their products \"interoperate effectively\" with those operating systems, id. § 3.ba group that includes all of Microsofts competitors.\n\nIn its \"summary response\" to plaintiffs proposed decree, Microsoft expressly requested discovery and a hearing on relief. MS Summ. Resp. to Pls. Proposed Final J. at 6-7; MS Position as to Future Proceedings. By filing six declarations and many new exhibits with their proposed decree, plaintiffs acknowledged that the trial record was insufficient to support their requested relief. Nevertheless, the district court announced on May 24, 2000 that it intended \"to proceed to the merits of the remedy.\" 5/24/00 am Tr. at 5. When Microsoft asked about further proceedings, the district court responded, \"Im not contemplating any further process.\" 5/24/00 pm Tr. at 33. Microsoft then filed an offer of proof, supplemented seven days later, summarizing the anticipated testimony of 23 individuals who would testify at a hearing on relief. MS Offer of Proof; MS Supplemental Offer of Proof.\n\nThe district court signed plaintiffs proposed final judgment as ultimately proffered without a single substantive change, thus awarding radical relief without conducting an evidentiary hearing or making any findings to justify that relief. 97 F. Supp. 2d 59, 63-74 (D.D.C. 2000). In an accompanying opinion, bereft of a single citation to law or evidence, the district court stated that \"a structural remedy has become imperative\" because Microsoft \"does not yet concede that any of its business practices violated the Sherman Act.\" Id. at 62. Far from finding that the relief entered will increase competition, the district court noted that even \"purportedly knowledgeable people\" do not know what \"may or may not ensue if the proposed final judgment is entered.\" Id.\n\nExplaining its decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing on relief, the district court stated that it \"has found testimonial predictions of future events generally less reliable even than testimony as to historical fact, and cross-examination to be of little use in enhancing or detracting from their accuracy.\" Id. In an astounding abdication of judicial responsibility, the district court remarked:\n\nPlaintiffs won the case, and for that reason alone have some entitlement to a remedy of their choice. Moreover, plaintiffs proposed final judgment is the collective work product of senior antitrust law enforcement officials of the United States Department of Justice and the Attorneys General of 19 states, in conjunction with multiple consultants. These officials are by reason of office obliged and expected to considerand to act inthe public interest; Microsoft is not.\n\nId. at 62-63. The district judge elaborated on his opinion in his discussions with the press, stating, \"I am not aware of any case authority that says I have to give them any due process at all. The case is over. They lost.\" Brinkley & Lohr, N.Y. Times, supra at C8. He also reportedly remarked, \"its procedurally unusual to do what Microsoft is proposingare you aware of very many cases in which the defendant can argue with the jury about what an appropriate sanction should be? Were the Japanese allowed to propose the terms of their surrender? The government won the case.\" John R. Wilke, For Antitrust Judge, Trust, or Lack of It, Really Was the Issue, Wall St. J., June 8, 2000, at A8.\n\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\n\nAmericas computer industry, the subject of this case, is the envy of the world. It is characterized by falling prices and unprecedented levels of investment and innovation, the opposite of what one would expect if the industry were under the thumb of an oppressive monopolist. Schmalensee ¶¶ 61-81; Maritz ¶¶ 70-73, 75-105; see also 11/19/98 am Tr. at 45; 11/19/98 pm Tr. at 51-53; 6/16/99 am Tr. at 15-17. Consumersthe intended beneficiaries of the antitrust lawshave greatly benefited from Microsofts efforts to offer improved products at attractive prices. Schmalensee ¶¶ 255-82; Maritz ¶ 74; see also 1/21/99 pm Tr. at 35-40; 6/21/99 am Tr. at 6-19; DX 2098 at A1, E4; DX 2748. Indeed, when asked whether Microsoft had harmed consumers, plaintiffs own economist, Franklin Fisher of MIT, candidly replied, \"[O]n balance, I would think the answer was no, up to this point.\" 1/12/99 am Tr. at 29.\n\nThe district court nevertheless found that Microsoft violated the antitrust laws by developing and marketing improved versions of Windows in response to demand for Internet-enabled products. Condemning Microsofts efforts to improve Windows and make those improvements broadly available turns the antitrust laws on their head. To be sure, Microsoft \"set out to maximize Internet Explorers share of browser usage at Netscapes expense,\" 87 F. Supp. 2d at 39, but that is the essence of competition. What matters is that Microsoft did nothing to prevent Netscape from getting its products into the hands of consumers.\n\nA. Microsoft and the Computer Industry\n\nUnlike other companies in the computer industry such as IBM and Apple, Microsoft has always focused on software. Maritz ¶ 44; 84 F. Supp. 2d at 13 (FF 5). Starting with the emergence of the IBM personal computer (\"PC\") in 1981, Microsoft became a leading developer of operating systems. Id. (FF 6-9). Early on, Microsoft recognized that operating systems that serve as a common \"platform\" for applications and that run on PCs supplied by a wide range of OEMs would provide enormous consumer benefit. Maritz ¶ 46. In part because of Microsofts success in developing such platforms, consumers today can choose from tens of thousands of applications and thousands of PC models that are compatible with one another. Maritz ¶¶ 6, 47.\n\n1. Operating System Software\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of operating systems because they have evolved over time. Allchin ¶ 30; 11/16/98 am Tr. at 70-72; see also 12/8/98 am Tr. at 44, 48-49, 58. At a bare minimum, operating systems serve as the computers \"central nervous system,\" scheduling the execution of tasks by the microprocessor and controlling the flow of information within the computer and between the computer and peripheral devices such as printers. Allchin ¶ 30; 6/21/99 am Tr. at 19-20. In response to changes in microprocessor technology and consumer demand, operating system vendors have continually added new features and functionality to their products, often integrating capabilities previously provided by standalone software products. Allchin ¶¶ 38-40; see also 6/21/99 pm Tr. at 63-65; DX 2098 at E4; DX 2764. For example, in the early 1990s, many firms offered their own implementations of what is known as a TCP/IP stack (the network protocols used to transmit data over the Internet), which they sold for as much as $495 per copy, more than five times the retail price of Windows 98. Allchin ¶¶ 24-26, 55. In response to demand for Internet connectivity, however, Microsoft and other firms began including a TCP/IP stack as a standard feature of their operating systems without additional charge. Allchin ¶ 56; 11/16/98 am Tr. at 72-75.\n\nThe principal function of operating systems today is to serve as platforms on which applications (such as spreadsheets or databases) run. 84 F. Supp. 2d at 19-20 (FF 37); Maritz ¶ 234; Allchin ¶ 34. Applications rely on \"system services\" provided by operating systems through application programming interfaces (\"APIs\"). 84 F. Supp. 2d at 12 (FF 2). When an application \"calls\" a particular API, the operating system supplies the \"system service\" associated with that API by causing the microprocessor to execute a specified set of instructions. Id.; Allchin ¶ 46; Devlin ¶ 12. The availability of such \"system services\" is highly efficient, freeing ISVs from the need to \"reinvent the wheel\" by including software code in their products to perform commonly-needed functions. Allchin ¶ 50; Devlin ¶ 14. ISVs thus can focus on adding innovative features to their products. Maritz ¶¶ 181-82; Allchin ¶ 50.\n\nISVs need stable and well-defined platforms. Maritz ¶ 167. If OEMs were permitted to modify Windowsinstalling some parts of it, but not othersISVs would not know whether the system services on which their applications rely would be present on any given PC. Maritz ¶ 168; Allchin ¶ 50; Devlin ¶¶ 14-20; Kempin ¶ 29. Microsofts license agreements with OEMs thus have always provided, consistent with Microsofts rights under federal copyright law, that OEMs cannot modify Windows without Microsofts permission. Kempin ¶ 25. In contrast, the UNIX operating system, developed by Bell Laboratories in the 1970s, was allowed to fragment as a platform. Maritz ¶ 172. As a result, applications written for one version of UNIX will frequently not run on other versions, making UNIX applications less abundant and more expensive. Maritz ¶ 173; Devlin ¶¶ 18-19; Kempin ¶ 30.\n\nModern operating systems perform two other related functions. First, they provide a \"user interface,\" i.e., the means by which a user interacts with a computer. Allchin ¶¶ 58-62. User interfaces for computers have evolved dramatically, from punch card readers, to teletype terminals, to character-based user interfaces, to graphical user interfaces. Allchin ¶ 59. Second, operating systems enable users to find and view information contained in various storage devices. Allchin ¶¶ 63-74. These storage devices can be \"local,\" such as a floppy diskette, a CD-ROM drive and the hard drive built into a computer, or \"remote,\" such as \"local area networks\" that connect computers in a particular office, \"wide area networks\" that connect computers in geographically separated offices, and the Internet. Allchin ¶¶ 64, 78; DX 2098 at B2; DX 2161.\n\nIn 1981, Microsoft released its first operating system, MS-DOS, which had a character-based user interface that required users to type specific instructions to perform tasks. 84 F. Supp. 2d at 13 (FF 6). In 1985, Microsoft introduced a new product called \"Windows\" that included a graphical user interface, enabling users to perform tasks by clicking on icons on the screen using a mouse. Id. at 13 (FF 7). Although initially just a \"shell\" running on MS-DOS, Windows assumed more and more operating system functionality over time. Id. Windows 3.0, shipped in May 1990, was the first successful version of Windows. Schmalensee App. C ¶ 12; Maritz ¶ 90; Allchin ¶ 303. In 1995, Microsoft released Windows 95, which integrated the functionality of Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS in a single operating system and \"enjoyed unprecedented popularity with consumers.\" 84 F. Supp. 2d at 13 (FF 8). Microsoft shipped Windows 98, the successor to Windows 95, in June 1998. Id.\n\nMany other companies develop and market operating systems, including (i) IBM, which distributes MVS, AIX, OS/2 and PC-DOS; (ii) Apple, which distributes the Mac OS; (iii) Sun, which distributes Solaris and JavaOS; (iv) SCO, which distributes UnixWare and OpenServer; (v) Be, which distributes BeOS; and (vi) Caldera and Red Hat, which distribute Linux. See Schmalensee ¶¶ 118, 135; Maritz ¶¶ 207-33, 244; Allchin ¶ 276. Some companies also create programs that sit between operating systems and applications. Maritz ¶ 235; Allchin ¶ 35. This \"middleware\" layer can provide system services to applications via APIs, thus serving as a platform for software development and subsuming the primary function of an operating system. Maritz ¶¶ 235-36; Allchin ¶ 35. Microsoft believed, and the district court found, that Navigator had the potential to develop into such a middleware platform and thus compete with Windows for the attention of ISVs. 84 F. Supp. 2d at 28 (FF 69); see also DX 2164.\n\n2. Rapid Technological Change and Inflection Points\n\nGordon Moore, one of Intels founders, corrdirectly predicted in 1965 (in what came to be known as \"Moores Law\") that microprocessor capabilities would double every 18 to 24 months. Maritz ¶ 81. Dramatic improvements in microprocessors regularly alter the entire competitive landscape of the industry. Maritz ¶¶ 82-83. As Intel chairman Dr. Andrew Grove described in his book, Only the Paranoid Survive: How to Exploit the Crisis Points That Challenge Every Company, such technological advancesknown as \"inflection points\" or \"paradigm shifts\"can quickly diminish the value of (or eliminate altogether) entire categories of products, making the computer industry inherently unpredictable. Schmalensee ¶ 63; Maritz ¶¶ 12-13, 83-86; 11/19/98 am Tr. at 53. Hence, the greatest competitive threat to a leading product frequently comes not from another product within the same category, \"but rather a technological advance that renders the boundaries defining the category obsolete.\" 84 F. Supp. 2d at 26 (FF 59).\n\nMicrosoft itself was born of an inflection pointthe emergence of PCs in a world previously dominated by expensive mainframes and minicomputers. Maritz ¶¶ 14, 87. Established companies like IBM and DEC failed to appreciate the significance of the PC, which permitted Microsoft and other startups like Dell, Compaq and Gateway to thrive. Maritz ¶¶ 14, 76. For example, Ken Olson, the founder of DEC, is said to have remarked in 1977 that there was no reason for people to have computers in their homes. Maritz ¶ 88.\n\nOver the past 15 years, Microsoft has survived several inflection points that could have destroyed its operating system business. Maritz ¶¶ 15, 89. In the late 1980s, microprocessors became powerful enough to support graphical user interfaces. Maritz ¶ 15. Had Microsoft not managed to enhance MS-DOS with Windows 3.0, competitors such as Apple and IBM could have captured the business. Maritz ¶¶ 15, 89-90. The transition in the early 1990s from \"16-bit\" to \"32-bit\" microprocessors was another inflection point. Maritz ¶¶ 15, 91. Had Microsoft not responded with two new 32-bit operating systemsWindows 95 and Windows NTconsumers might have chosen other operating systems. Maritz ¶¶ 15, 92-94.\n\nThe rise of the Internet presents another inflection point, which \"could oust the PC operating system from its position as the primary platform for applications development and the main interface between users and their computers.\" 84 F. Supp. 2d at 26 (FF 60). In May 1995, Bill Gates described the challenge of \"The Internet Tidal Wave\":\n\nPerhaps you have already seen memos from me or others here about the importance of the Internet. I have gone through several stages of increasing my views of its importance. Now I assign the Internet the highest level of importance. In this memo I want to make clear that our focus on the Internet is critical to every part of our business. The Internet is the most important single development to come along since the IBM PC was introduced in 1981. It is even more important than the arrival of [the] graphical user interface (GUI).\n\nGX 20 at 112876. Had Microsoft not added Internet technologies to its products, it would be an anachronism today, Maritz ¶¶ 55-61, 95-103, for \"the Internet has become both a major inducement for consumers to buy PCs for the first time and a major occupier of the time and attention of current PC users,\" 84 F. Supp. 2d at 28 (FF 70). Indeed, many in 1995 believed that Microsoft had missed the boat on the Internet and was doomed as a result. Maritz ¶ 97.\n\nEven as Microsoft grapples with the Internet, it faces a new inflection point: the advent of \"information appliances\" (such as television set-top boxes, handheld devices and game consoles) and the transformation of software from shrink-wrapped products to Web-based services. Maritz ¶¶ 17, 104-05, 266-73; 1/28/99 am Tr. at 35-38; 6/16/99 am Tr. at 26-27; 6/22/99 pm Tr. at 27-28. Just as PCs rendered mainframes less important, this new breed of smaller, less expensive computing devices threatens to do the same to PCs. Maritz ¶¶ 18, 105, 274-79, 281. Customers who otherwise would use a PC \"for storing addresses and schedules, for sending and receiving E-mail, for browsing the Web, and for playing video games might be able to choose a complementary set of information appliances over an Intel-compatible PC system without incurring substantial costs.\" 84 F. Supp. 2d at 15-16 (FF 23); see also DX 2785 at 1 (\"[T]he biggest challenge to Microsofts . . . operating system franchise is that there would be many computers that are not running Windows (that are simply Net devices) on which AOL could effectively be the operating system.\"). Microsoft thus has developed a new embedded operating system, called Windows CE, designed for use with information appliances, Maritz ¶ 281, and it is now betting the company on a dramatic new initiative, called \".NET,\" intended to provide an infrastructure that will enable thousands of firms to provide a wide range of compatible services to all types of information appliances, MS Offer of Proof at 21.\n\n3. The Software Business\n\nCompetition in developing and marketing software is intense. Maritz ¶ 75; Schmalensee ¶¶ 28-90. Even the district court acknowledged that the software business \"is characterized by dynamic, vigorous competition.\" 84 F. Supp. 2d at 25 (FF 59). In addition to the destabilizing effects of constant technological change, the very nature of software makes the business intensely competitive. Maritz ¶¶ 19-20, 77. For example, software never wears out and is easily copied. Maritz ¶ 20. Consequently, a company must compete not only against its competitors products, but also against prior versions and illegal copies of its own products. Maritz ¶¶ 20, 120-23; see also 84 F. Supp. 2d at 25 (FF 57-58). Because existing software can be improved in myriad ways and microprocessor power continues to increase, opportunities for creating new and improved products are essentially infinite. Maritz ¶¶ 106-07; Schmalensee ¶¶ 45-46.\n\nMore fundamentally, unlike industries that require substantial investments in infrastructure or access to scarce natural resources, software is based entirely on ideas implemented as written instructions that can be created by literally millions of people. Maritz ¶¶ 19, 109-14; Schmalensee ¶¶ 37-44. For example, a Finnish graduate student named Linus Torvalds created the Linux operating system and put his fledgling code on the Internet in October 1991, thereby enlisting help from other developers. Maritz ¶ 216; see also 84 F. Supp. 2d at 23 (FF 50). Linux today consists of several million lines of code and is comparable in functionality and complexity to Microsofts operating systems. Schmalensee ¶¶ 138-40; Maritz ¶ 216. Once created, software can be replicated and distributed pervasively at nominal cost. Maritz ¶ 19, 115-19; Schmalensee ¶ 50; see also 84 F. Supp. 2d at 18 (FF 30).\n\n4. Microsofts Successful Business Model\n\nAt the outset of the PC era, Microsoft adopted a business model with four basic elements. Maritz ¶¶ 21, 124, 129-34. First, Microsoft creates operating systems that provide a well-defined platform for developing and running applications despite differences in underlying PC hardware. Maritz ¶¶ 130, 167-75. Second, Microsofts operating systems provide a consistent user interface that enables users to interact with their computers in a uniform way and thus to transfer their knowledge from one computer to another. Maritz ¶ 131. Third, to promote their widespread use, Microsoft licenses its operating systems to OEMs at attractive prices, typically far less than 5% of the price of a new computer. Maritz ¶¶ 22-23, 132. Fourth, Microsoft works closely with OEMs, ISVs and users to ascertain their needs and to \"evangelize\" the features and functionality of Microsofts platforms. Maritz ¶¶ 133, 136-52.\n\nThese four elements are directed at a common goal: creating a platformWindowsthat enables thousands of hardware and software vendors to build a wide range of compatible products. Maritz ¶¶ 21-26, 134, 176-86. Such broad compatibilitywhich gives rise to a phenomenon known as \"network effects\"provides substantial benefits. OEMs benefit because their PCs can run all of the many applications written for Windows and because users are familiar with the Windows user interface. Maritz ¶¶ 22, 177-80; Rose ¶ 8. ISVs benefit because their applications can make use of system services provided by Windows and because they can write applications once that will run on a broad range of PCs. Maritz ¶¶ 22, 181-82; Devlin ¶¶ 14-20. Consumers benefit because they can choose from thousands of PC models and applications that work well with one another and because such compatibility fosters intense competition among OEMs and ISVs to deliver innovative products at attractive prices. Maritz ¶¶ 22, 183-86. The broad compatibility provided by Windowswhich would be lost if OEMs were permitted to install some parts of the operating system but not othershelped to propel widespread use of PCs in the workplace, schools and many homes. Maritz ¶¶ 25-26, 403.\n\nMicrosofts \"high volume/low price\" business model stands in stark contrast to those of rivals like Apple and Sun, which develop and market complete computer systems that include both hardware and software. Maritz ¶¶ 24, 125-26. This \"single vendor\" approach makes it easier to ensure that all components of a computer work well together, Maritz ¶ 125, but prices for Apples and Suns products are considerably higher than comparable offerings from OEMs and ISVs that build on Windows, Maritz ¶¶ 24, 184-85. In fact, the district court found that \"the pac"
