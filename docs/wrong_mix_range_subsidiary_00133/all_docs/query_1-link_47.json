        "text": "CAM High Yield Weekly Insights\n\nFund Flows & Issuance: According to a Wells Fargo report, flows week to date were +$2.9 billion and year to date flows stand at -$16.0 billion. New issuance for the week was $4.3 billion and year to date issuance is at $76.5 billion.\n\n(Bloomberg) High Yield Market Highlights\n\nThe robust demand for new issuance, coupled with continued fund inflows, has pushed junk bond spreads to a three-week low.\n\nJunk bonds have posted gains in seven of the last 10 sessions.\n\nInvestors have been pouring cash into high-yield retail funds for the last three weeks\n\nNordstrom increased the size of its debt offering by $100m to $600m after getting orders of more than $4b as junk investors sought higher- quality debt\n\nNordstrom priced at par to yield 8.75% after talk tightened from 10% area to 9%-9.25%\n\nThe retailer is still high grade, but fallen angels are expected to outperform high yield, according to Ashish Shah of Goldman Sachs Asset Management said\n\nThis was the second investment-grade borrower to tap high-yield investors to increase liquidity by offering attractive coupon, following Carnival\n\nElsewhere in primary, propane distributor Ferrellgas sold $575m 1st lien senior secured notes, rated B3/CAA, at par to yield 10%\n\nTightened talk from 10.5%-11%\n\nEarlier in the week, Wynn raised $600m, up from $350m initially, through the sale of five-year notes and cut the coupon to 7.75% from around 8.5%\n\nJunk bond yields dropped to a three-week low of 8.48% while spreads tightened to +785, also a three-week low\n\nBA spreads narrowed to 535bps while yields dropped to 6.04%\n\nSingle B yields fell to 8.42% and spreads fell to 779 bps\n\nCAA yields dropped to 16.82% and spreads tightened to 1,641bps\n\n(Bloomberg) Fertitta’s Record Rate Stokes Surge in Demand for Leveraged Loan\n\nA record high interest rate on Tilman Fertitta’s loan sale seems to be doing to trick. Order books for the $250 million deal are at least double that just a day after it was launched, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe loan, which matures in October 2023, is being arranged by Jefferies Financial Group Inc. Based on initial discussions with investors, it’s being offered at a spread of 14 percentage points over the benchmark London interbank offered rate with a floor of 1% and at a discount of about 96 cents on the dollar.\n\nThat makes the all-in yield at least 16%, according to calculations by Bloomberg. The spread is the highest ever seen in the U.S. leveraged loan market excluding companies in bankruptcy, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That all-in yield may fall due to strong demand for the debt, the people said.\n\nThe Texas billionaire is looking to raise the loan to keep his casino and restaurant empire afloat through year-end if the Covid-19 virus shutdown persists. The offering is ending a near one-month drought in the market for risky corporate loans, but the company will be saddled with excruciatingly high borrowing costs.\n\nTo put those costs into more perspective, Fertitta’s Golden Nugget sold a $200 million loan in January that financed a dividend at just 2.5 percentage points over Libor. That loan, which also matures in 2023, has since dropped and is trading at about 75.5 cents on the dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That equates to a yield of almost 12%, and a premium of at least four percentage points for the new loan.\n\nUpdate:\n\nTexas billionaire Tilman Fertitta has cut the interest rate on a $250 million leveraged loan sale to keep his restaurant and casino empire afloat and is considering boosting the size of the deal after being inundated with demand from investors.\n\nPotential lenders have submitted about $1.4 billion of orders for the debt, which pays an all-in yield of at least 14%, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Fertitta is considering increasing the size of the loan to $300 million and will still contribute $50 million of his own cash into the company, the person said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.\n\nThe loan is now being offered at a spread of 12 percentage points over the benchmark London interbank offered rate with a floor of 1% and at a discount of about 96 cents on the dollar, according to separate people familiar with the matter.\n\n(Reuters) Global oil output cuts held hostage to standoff\n\nOil producers in the OPEC+ group, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, were expected to pressure Mexico on Friday to seal an accord for a collective cut in output of 10 million barrels per day, before asking other nations for a further 5 million bpd of cuts.\n\nThe United States has encouraged global cooperation to bolster an oil market that collapsed as the coronavirus pandemic accelerated in March and producers resorted to a price war after failing to agree on how to prop up prices.\n\nOil prices tumbled on Thursday despite OPEC+ nearing agreement as the lockdowns ordered across the world sucked life out of the global economy, and traders reckoned that even a combined reduction of 15 million bpd would be too little to stabilize the market.\n\n(Bloomberg) Fed to Buy Junk Bonds, CLOs and Lend to States in New Stimulus\n\nThe Federal Reserve on Thursday announced another series of sweeping steps to provide as much as $2.3 trillion in additional aid during the coronavirus pandemic, including starting programs to aid small and mid-sized businesses as well as state and local governments.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, the Fed also said Thursday it would move to shore up some of the hardest-hit parts of financial markets, pledging to start buying some debt recently downgraded to below investment grade as well as certain collateralized loan obligations and commercial mortgage-backed securities.\n\n“Our country’s highest priority must be to address this public health crisis, providing care for the ill and limiting the further spread of the virus,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a statement. “The Fed’s role is to provide as much relief and stability as we can during this period of constrained economic activity, and our actions today will help ensure that the eventual recovery is as vigorous as possible.”\n\nA Municipal Liquidity Facility will offer as much as $500 billion in lending to states and municipalities, by directly purchasing that amount of short-term notes from states as well as large counties and cities.\n\nThe Main Street Lending Program will “ensure credit flows to small and mid-sized businesses with the purchase of up to $600 billion in loans.”\n\nExpanding the size and scope of the Primary and Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facilities and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to support as much as $850 billion in credit.\n\nIts Secondary Market facility may purchase U.S.-listed ETFs. While the preponderance of those holdings will be those primarily focused on U.S. investment-grade corporate bonds, the remainder will be in ETFs whose primary investment objective is exposure to U.S. high-yield corporate bonds.\n\nStarting the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, “supplying liquidity to participating financial institutions through term financing backed by PPP loans to small businesses.”\n\nCAM High Yield Weekly Insights\n\nFund Flows & Issuance: According to a Wells Fargo report, flows week to date were +$5.9 billion and year to date flows stand at -$18.9 billion. New issuance for the week was $0.6 billion and year to date issuance is at $72.1 billion.\n\n(Bloomberg) High Yield Market Highlights\n\nThe U.S. junk bond market is springing back into action with more companies looking to issue debt. Investors poured cash into U.S. high-yield funds with an influx of $5.9 billion.\n\nBorrowers have started testing risk appetite again with sales of senior secured bonds as the leveraged loan market remains on ice, according to one high-yield syndicate banker\n\nJunk bonds may slip Friday as stock futures fall following disappointing economic data from Europe and ahead of March payrolls that are expected to decline for the first time since 2010\n\nA jump in oil prices may lend some support with the OPEC+ coalition pushing for other major oil producers to join it in a deep reduction of global crude output\n\nJunk-bond yields rose 4bps to 9.77% but have dropped by more than 190bps from 11.69% on March 23. Spreads widened 10bp to +919bps\n\nJunk-bond returns were negative for the second day, with 0.37%\n\nCAA yields fell 9bps to 18.04% and spreads tightened to +1,772. Posted losses of 0.6%\n\n(Bloomberg) Investors Clamor for Credit With New Deal Demand Off the Charts\n\nInvestors are meeting a flood of corporate debt issuance with even greater demand, a strong sign for risk appetite as issuers continue to bring new deals.\n\nYUM! Brands Inc., bringing the first U.S. high-yield offering in nearly a month, already boosted the size of its deal to $600 million from $500 million amid $3 billion of orders. Oracle Corp., which was downgraded by two credit raters after announcing a deal Monday, has amassed more than $50 billion in orders for what could now be at least a $15 billion offering, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nCredit markets are showing signs of thawing, as strong reception of record investment-grade issuance has trickled into the high-yield market. While market access was initially limited to only top-notch firms like Exxon Mobil Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. just two weeks ago, investors have since gotten more comfortable with riskier names, and massive demand has cut down borrowing costs.\n\nLast week, U.S. companies borrowed a record $109 billion, met with $550 billion of demand, in what one dealer called a “food fight” for new bonds. It was a similar story in Europe, where investors placed more than 310 billion euros ($340 billion) of orders for about 75 billion euros of bonds.\n\n“As corporates should remain keen on retaining liquidity to weather the growing pain of lockdowns, we expect issuance windows to continue to attract issuers,” Commerzbank strategists said in a note to clients this morning.\n\nYUM! Brands is bringing the first junk bond sale since March 4, one of the most positive signs of the recovery in credit to date. The investment-grade market continues to be active, with 12 deals in the market as of 12:49 p.m. in New York on Monday.\n\nAirlines worldwide raised more than $17 billion in bank loans in March to shore up finances as the coronavirus grounds flights, with U.S. carriers like Delta the most active.\n\nThis information is intended solely to report on investment strategies identified by Cincinnati Asset Management.

New issuance for the week was zero and year to date issuance is at $71.5 billion.\n\n(Bloomberg) High Yield Market Highlights\n\nU.S. junk bonds are off the lows after this week’s strong gains but may struggle as equity markets falter. Spreads have backed off from the 1,000 bps distressed level where they started the week, and robust ETF inflows help boost sentiment.\n\nInvestors pulled $2b from retail funds in the week. This was the sixth straight week of outflows from U.S. high-yield funds\n\nJunk yields dropped below 11% to close at 10.33%, down 67bps, the biggest decline in percentage terms since June 2000\n\nSpreads closed at 959bps after the biggest drop in nine months\n\nReturns were up for three consecutive sessions\n\nBB yields fell 44bps to close at 8.31% and spreads tightened 45bps at +746\n\nSingle-B yields fell 84bps to 10.01%, the biggest drop since 2008, and spreads tightened the most in nine months, to 937bps\n\nEnergy sector yields dropped 63bps to 22.38%, the third day of decline and the longest declining streak in 10 weeks\n\nSpreads tightened for a foruth straight session closing at +2,161, down 54bps, the longest declining streak in 11 weeks\n\n(Bloomberg) What’s in Congress’s $2 Trillion Coronavirus Stimulus Package\n\nThe bill provides direct help to citizens, businesses, hospitals and state and local governments.\n\nBig Businesses: About $500 billion can be used to back loans and assistance to companies, including $50 billion for loans to U.S. airlines, as well as state and local governments.\n\nSmall Businesses: More than $350 billion to aid small businesses.\n\nHospitals: A $150 billion boost for hospitals and other health-care providers for equipment and supplies.\n\nIndividuals: Direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of $1,200 for each adult, as well as $500 for each child. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said checks would be cut April 6.\n\nUnemployed: Unemployment insurance extension to four months, bolstered by $600 weekly. Eligibility would be expanded to cover more workers.\n\nRestrictions on Business Aid: Any company receiving a government loan would be subject to a ban on stock buybacks through the term of the loan plus one additional year. They also would have to limit executive bonuses and take steps to protect workers.\n\nTransparency: The Treasury Department would have to disclose the terms of loans or other aid to companies, and a new Treasury inspector general would oversee the lending program.\n\n(Bloomberg) Distressed Debt Balloons to Almost $1 Trillion, Nears 2008 Peak\n\nThe amount of distressed debt in the U.S. has quadrupled in less than a week to nearly $1 trillion, reaching levels not seen since 2008 as the collapse of oil prices and fallout from the coronavirus shutters entire industries across the globe.\n\nIn total, the tally has ballooned to $934 billion of U.S. corporate bonds that yield at least 10 percentage points above Treasuries and loans that trade for less than 80 cents on the dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has caused the worst sell-off since the global financial crisis and deepened stress in credit markets. Driven by some of the lowest oil prices since the early 2000s, the amount of distressed bonds has surged to the highest level since April 2009.\n\nMost of the distressed debt outstanding stems from U.S. energy companies battered by less travel demand and an all-out price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The capital-intensive industry, which financed its shale production largely through debt, suddenly faces the prospect of deeper losses after oil plunged below $20 a barrel. Last month, it traded above $50.\n\nThe amount of distressed debt tied to the oil and gas sector stands at over $161 billion, up from $128 billion a week ago. One of the biggest casualties has been Occidental Petroleum Corp., which has seen its funding costs skyrocket and its credit rating cut to make it the biggest fallen angel in the current downgrade cycle. Oxy’s bonds led the list of high-yield losers on Wednesday, with four of its issues among the top 10 decliners.\n\nEnergy isn’t alone. Every sector except utilities is under stress, with distressed ratios growing by double or triple digits. Telecommunications, retail, entertainment and healthcare industries make up the bulk of distressed debt. Retailers such as Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and theater chains such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. have been hit hard as companies are forced to close and customers are told to stay home.\n\nS. junk bonds entered distressed territory for the first time since the global financial crisis after spreads on the securities topped 1,000 basis points at the end of last week. The index move marks a period of turmoil in the credit markets as investors flee funds that buy all types of corporate debt.\n\n(Bloomberg) Ford Becomes Largest Fallen Angel After S&P Downgrade to Junk\n\nFord Motor Co. was cut to junk by S&P Global Ratings as the coronavirus pandemic delivers a shock to the global auto industry and renders the carmaker the largest fallen angel to date.\n\nS&P downgraded Ford’s credit rating one notch to BB+ and may cut it further, according to a statement. The move follows Moody’s Investors Service, which dropped its rating Ford for the second time in sixth months earlier Wednesday. Its two high-yield ratings will remove its $35.8 billion of debt from the Bloomberg Barclays investment-grade index at the end of the month.\n\nFord is one of many auto companies facing what Moody’s calls an unprecedented “credit shock,” with the coronavirus outbreak also posing a major threat to peers including General Motors Co. and Volkswagen AG. But Ford is particularly at risk because of the problems it’s been having with executing an $11billion restructuring that’s yet to improve performance.\n\n“Ford is managing through the coronavirus crisis in a way that safeguards our business, our workforce, our customers and our dealers,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We plan to emerge from this crisis as a stronger company.”\n\nThis information is intended solely to report on investment strategies identified by Cincinnati Asset Management.

New issuance for the week was zero and year to date issuance is at $71.5 billion.\n\n(Bloomberg) High Yield Market Highlights\n\nU.S. junk bonds may pare losses Friday with stock futures higher and oil extending a recovery. But the asset class has lost the most in any month so far since 2008, and investors pulled billions of dollars of cash from funds.\n\nYet the junk-bond index has posted losses for 11 straight sessions, with 2.63% on Thursday alone. The asset class has lost 17.6% year-to-date and 16.46% in March, the biggest monthly loss since 2008\n\nHigh-yield spreads widened 72bps Thursday to 976bps. Single-B spreads widened 78bps to 990bps. That’s very close to the 1,000bps that’s typically considered distressed\n\nIn less than two weeks, the amount of distressed debt in the U.S. has doubled to a half-trillion dollars as the collapse of oil prices and the fallout from the coronavirus shutters entire industries.\n\nJunk-bond yields jumped 63bps to close at 10.75%, the highest since September 2009\n\nEnergy-bond yields surged to a new 20-year high of 23.69%, with the index losing more than 37% this month\n\nHigh-yield bonds with more than $1.37b outstanding are trading above upcoming call prices, making it attractive for issuers to redeem the securities in the next three months. But that’s down 70% from the prior week, and the primary market hasn’t seen a deal price since March 4\n\n(Bloomberg) Junk Debt Market Freeze Risks $35 Billion Banker Headache\n\nBanks that agreed to help private equity firms and highly leveraged companies fund recent acquisitions may have to come up with billions of dollars of their own cash\n\nto finance the deals if the market for risky debt remains shut.\n\nUnderwriters across Wall Street have committed to providing more than $30 billion to junk-rated companies by mid-year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and people with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nBut with the markets for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds virtually shut since the Covid-19 pandemic triggered fears of a global recession, the banks now face the prospect that they might not be able to offload the risk before the takeovers are scheduled to close.\n\nThe exposure is a small fraction of the commitments they held heading into the 2008 financial crisis. Still, it could force banks to take losses or tie up capital for months just as\n\ndozens of companies are drawing credit lines or seeking fresh financing to cope with the coronavirus fallout.\n\nThe deals run the gamut of sectors and geographies, ranging from an $11 billion financing for the leveraged buyout of ThyssenKrupp’s elevator unit in Europe to a $500 million debt deal for Culligan’s acquisition of water-filtration company AquaVenture.\n\nRepresentatives for lead arrangers including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc declined to comment.\n\nFor the vast majority of deals, the acquisitions themselves are not in doubt. If the banks are unable to syndicate the loans to institutional investors before closing, they are typically required to come up with the cash, and may try to offload the debt at a later date.\n\nCorporate Bond Market Update\n\nIt was a difficult week for the Corporate Bond market as fear and uncertainty related to COVID-19, a precipitous drop in oil, and an inter-meeting rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve drove Treasuries lower and spreads wider.\n\nWhen we look at the Investment Grade market the option adjusted spread on the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Index was 122 at month-end February 2020, while on Friday, March 13, 2020 it closed at 216. This was one of the quickest and most volatile spread moves in the history of the investment grade credit market.\n\nThere was a corresponding move lower in Treasuries across the board – this helped to mitigate some, but not all, of the impact of widening spreads.\n\nTo provide some context on the performance of the investment grade credit market, through the end of the day on Friday March 13, the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Index posted a YTD gross total return of -1.88%. Comparatively, the S&P 500 YTD gross total return was -15.73% (Source: Bloomberg). While we are not happy to see negative returns in the corporate bond market, the asset class has performed as expected during a period of extreme volatility, and it has held up materially better than equities and other risk assets.\n\nCAM does not provide intra-monthly performance figures, however as of March 13, 2020 we note that CAM’s portfolio has the following defensive characteristics relative to the Index. CAM is significantly underweight in BBB rated corporate credit relative to the Index. CAM caps its exposure to BBB-rated credit at 30% while the Corporate Index’s exposure was 49.14% as of March 13. Interestingly, the BBB concentration of the Index is down slightly YTD but that is merely because some large issuers, like Kraft-Heinz, were downgraded from BBB to junk status – an example of the type of investment CAM seeks to avoid through its bottom up research process. The second and third major factors that will impact CAM’s performance relative to the Index relate to individual credit selection and avoidance of certain industries which have been particularly hard hit by COVID-19, such as Leisure. To be sure, we have individual credits within our portfolio that have been affected by both COVID-19 and the decline in the oil market and we are constantly monitoring and evaluating those situations through active management of the portfolio.\n\nIt was also an exceptionally difficult week for the High Yield market with a one-two punch of fear and uncertainty related to COVID-19 as well as a complete flush of the oil market due to the lack of an OPEC agreement. The option adjusted spread on the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate High Yield Index spiked above 700 for the first time since the commodity fueled rout of 2016. The Index YTD gross total return was -8.84% through the end of Friday March 13 (Source: Bloomberg).\n\nAgain, CAM does not provide intra-monthly performance figures, but our High Yield portfolio has the following defensive characteristics relative to the Index. CAM had over 10% of its portfolio in cash at the start of the current sell-off in February and CAM is underweight, or zero weight, some sectors of the market that were particularly hard hit by this sell off, such as Oil Field services. To be sure, our portfolio’s gross total return was negative as of February 29, 2020, and subsequent drawdown has been widespread. We have a number of credits that have experienced increased volatility and as always we are closely monitoring those situations as well as all the credits in our portfolio. Currently, we are comfortable with the individual credit metrics of our holdings and we believe the overall portfolio is well positioned should the economy enter a recessionary environment. Our cash balance also affords us the ability to be opportunistic on behalf of our clients as those situations arise.\n\nThe High Yield market can be extremely volatile in times of stress. It is not as deep or as liquid as the Investment Grade credit market and that is one of the reasons that spreads can gap wider so quickly. The growth of ETFs has exacerbated this problem as they are often forced to sell in the face of investor liquidations. We would caution that during times like these it can be difficult to achieve favorable pricing when looking to sell a high yield security; and depending on your risk tolerance it can often be a good opportunity to buy. We ask that our investors continue to trust that we will professionally manage your portfolios with a long-term objective and through the extent of the current downturn to the best of our ability.\n\nWe believe it is important in times like these to remind our investors of our investment philosophy and process at CAM. While volatile markets present challenges as well as opportunities, the way we manage money remains very consistent. We are conservative investors of domestic corporate bonds with a “bottom-up value” investment discipline, stressing first and foremost the preservation of capital, with an important secondary focus on total return. We seek to deliver these results by identifying quality businesses that we are comfortable owning in all markets.\n\nWe take the responsibility of managing your money very seriously and we will always do our best to perform that task to the highest standard of care. We sympathize with our clients in uncertain times such as these and we hope that you and your families stay safe and healthy.\n\nThis information is intended solely to report on investment strategies identified by Cincinnati Asset Management.

Fixed income securities may be sensitive to prevailing interest rates. When rates rise the value generally declines. High Yield bonds present risks specific to below investment grade fixed income securities. Valuation may result in uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads, and a lack of price transparency. Investments in fixed income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are subject to nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of fixed income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer’s ability to make principal and interest payments.

New issuance for the week was $3.1 billion and year to date issuance is at $63.7 billion.\n\n(Bloomberg) High Yield Market Highlights\n\nIt’s looking like a risk-off day in the junk-bond market as stock futures fall amid renewed concerns about the spread of the coronavirus outside China.\n\nCAA yields, meanwhile, have crossed the 10% mark for the first time in three weeks.\n\nIssuers are likely to remain on the sidelines Friday and the calendar is light, though Bausch Health is expected to emerge with a $3.25b junk-bond that’s part of a broader $8b refinancing\n\nYields rose 4bps to 5.13%, the biggest jump in three weeks though the index posted a modest gain of 0.018%\n\nBA yields rose 4ps to 3.64%, single-B yields rose to 5%\n\n(Bloomberg) Macy’s, Renault Add to Fallen Angel Fear With Downgrades to Junk\n\nThe credit-rating downgrades of Macy’s Inc. and Renault SA to junk status are rekindling fears among investors of a potential uptick in so-called fallen angels after a run of relative tranquility in the U.S. corporate bond market.\n\nThe American retailer and French carmaker each lost an investment-grade rating Tuesday, affecting billions of dollars of debt. They follow Kraft Heinz Co., the iconic U.S. packaged-food company, which was downgraded to junk by two credit raters last Friday as its turnaround shows little signs of progress.\n\nEven though Macy’s and Renault were downgraded for idiosyncratic reasons and will still trade in investment-grade indexes unless another credit-rating company follows suit, their cuts bring back to the fore what had been a central concern among investors less than two years ago: That a slowing global economy could hamper companies’ ability to service their obligations, especially those that had taken on significant debt loads to finance deals.\n\nWhile many firms took actions to reduce debt levels in 2019, several are still proving to be susceptible to ratings risk. Kraft Heinz alone, with around $21 billion of debt leaving the Bloomberg Barclays investment-grade index at the end of this month, nearly eclipses last year’s fallen angel volume of just under $22 billion, according to Bank of America Corp. strategists. Macy’s has about $8 billion of total debt, while Renault’s roughly $66 billion is predominantly denominated in euros and yen, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nBy year-end, the volume of fallen angels is likely to dwarf that of 2019, according UBS Group AG strategists led by Matthew Mish. They predict there could be as much as $90 billion of investment-grade debt downgraded to high yield this year. Guggenheim Partners has said as much as 20% of BBBs in the U.S., or $660 billion, will get cut to junk in the next downgrade wave.\n\n(Reuters) U.S. labor market remains strong; manufacturing likely stabilizing\n\nThe number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose modestly last week, suggesting sustained labor market strength that could help to support the economy amid risks from the coronavirus and weak business investment.\n\nThere was encouraging news on the struggling manufacturing sector, with other data on Thursday showing factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated to a three-year high in February, likely as tensions in the 19-month trade war between the United States and China diminished.\n\nBut the coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,000 people, mostly in China, and Boeing’s suspension last month of the production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, grounded in March 2019 after two fatal crashes, continue to loom over the manufacturing sector.\n\nMinutes of the Federal Reserve’s Jan. 28-29 meeting published on Wednesday showed policymakers “expected economic growth to continue at a moderate pace,” but expressed concern about possible economic risks from the coronavirus, which has also infected thousands globally.\n\n“Manufacturing growth may be past its trough,” said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. “However, looking ahead we continue to believe that activity will advance at a lackluster pace as global growth and trade policy headwinds are unlikely to significantly relent and the negative impact of the coronavirus will be felt via global supply chains interlinkages.”\n\n(Bloomberg) Aecom Conference Cancellation May Increase Deal Rumblings\n\nReports on Aecom not attending two industrial conferences this week are being “seen as a positive indication that the company might be in later-stage negotiations for a deal,” Baird analyst Andrew Wittmann wrote in a note.\n\nBaird confirmed that Aecom canceled from a Citi conference, and is not in attendance at a Barclays conference\n\nWittmann noted previous reports that Aecom had been approached by WSP Global regarding a deal\n\nCAM High Yield Weekly Insights\n\nFund Flows & Issuance: According to a Wells Fargo report, flows week to date were $2.4 billion and year to date flows stand at $3.7 billion. New issuance for the week was $12.4 billion and year to date issuance is at $60.6 billion.\n\n(Bloomberg) High Yield Market Highlights\n\nZayo Group Holdings Inc. is readying more than $3 billion of junk bonds, one of the biggest buyout financings since 2018 that may test investor appetite for riskier debt in the CAA tier.\n\nThe new notes, along with a leveraged loan package totaling more than $5b, will finance Zayo’s buyout by private equity firms Digital Colony Partners and EQT Partners\n\nThe bond portion of the offering may include $1b of seven-year secured notes and $2.1b of unsecured eight-year bonds, and marketing begins next Tuesday\n\nIt’s hitting the market after two straight weeks of gains for junk- bonds, which looks set to continue on Friday as stock futures edge higher and oil climbs\n\nTriple C rated bonds have lagged the broader high-yield market so far this year, returning 0.942% through Thursday while the larger junk universe rose 1.11%\n\nYet CAA index yields have still fallen to a nine-month low of 9.71% and posted positive returns for three consecutive sessions this week. Other issuers, including Hecla Mining, have also priced debt in this rating range\n\nInvestors have plenty of cash to put to work too after corporate high-yield funds reported inflows\n\nBA and single-B yields have fallen to a three- week low of 3.59% and 5%, respectively\n\nBAs have gained for ten straight sessions, taking year-to-date returns to 1.175%\n\n(Bloomberg) Natural Gas Tumbles to 4-Year Low on ‘Epic’ U.S. Demand Loss\n\nNatural gas futures sank to a four-year low as the latest U.S. forecasts all but eliminated bulls’ hopes for a late-winter cold push.\n\nFrigid weather in parts of the Midwest and West this week won’t stick around for long, according to Commodity Weather Group LLC. Mild temperatures are poised to blanket the eastern half of the country in late February, a shift from previous outlooks that showed a lingering chill.\n\nUnusually warm winter weather has wreaked havoc on gas demand, allowing an onslaught of supply from shale basins to overwhelm the market. American liquefied natural gas cargoes, a key outlet for production, are at risk of being curtailed as the coronavirus outbreak in China curbs consumption in the world’s second-largest economy. The resulting collapse in global gas prices is squeezing profits for U.S. exporters.\n\n“The lack of heating demand is epic. It’s a worst-case scenario,” John Kilduff, founding partner at hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York, said by phone. “We continue to have a very weak demand environment that’s persisted all winter.”\n\nThe gas glut has been especially severe in the Permian Basin, where local prices for March delivery have dropped below zero. Output from the West Texas and New Mexico shale play, where gas is extracted as a byproduct of oil drilling, is increasing so fast there isn’t enough space on pipelines to take it away.\n\n(Reuters) T-Mobile-Sprint merger wins approval from U.S. judge\n\nT-Mobile edged closer to a takeover of Sprint Corp after a federal judge on Tuesday approved the deal, rejecting a claim by a group of states that said the proposed transaction would violate antitrust laws and raise prices.\n\nDuring a two-week trial in December, T-Mobile and Sprint argued the merger will better equip the new company to compete with top players Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc as the third-largest U.S. wireless carrier, creating a more efficient company with low prices and faster internet speeds.\n\nFinalizing a deal will be a boon to Japan’s Softbank Group Corp, Sprint’s controlling shareholder, as the conglomerate offloads a troubled asset that has lost subscribers at a faster rate and as it seeks to secure funding for a second Vision Fund.\n\nSprint and T-Mobile said in a statement that they would move to finalize the merger, which is still subject to closing conditions and possible additional court proceedings.\n\nA spokesman for the California Public Utilities Commission, the last regulatory body to decide on the merger, said its review of the deal is expected to conclude in July.\n\n(Wall Street Journal) MGM Resorts Chief Set To Step Down\n\nMGM Resorts International Chief Executive Jim Murren will leave the global casino operator after its board picks his successor, the company said.\n\nMr. Murren, who is also stepping down as chairman, has led the company since 2008. He is leaving before his contract expires at the end of 2021.\n\n“When I thought through how I could best serve MGM going forward, I thought it was pretty clear that a leader should help lead a company into the next decade or two,” Mr. Murren said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday. “I wanted to make sure the board had the time, which it will use promptly, to do a robust search and find my successor.”\n\nMGM Resorts, which has a market value of $17 billion, didn’t give a firm date for Mr. Murren’s departure. The board has formed a search committee to find a new CEO, the company said. Mr. Murren said he anticipates being on MGM Resorts’ next quarterly earnings call, in about three months.\n\nThe company has sold off much of its real estate, including deals with MGM Growth Properties, a real-estate investment trust MGM Resorts spun off in 2016, and other property deals. The company’s “asset-light” strategy is intended to pull cash out of the company’s valuable real estate, including prime locations on the Las Vegas Strip.\n\nMGM Resorts’ remaining company-owned real estate includes MGM Springfield in Massachusetts, a 50% stake in CityCenter in Las Vegas and more than half of MGM Growth Properties.\n\nCAM High Yield Weekly Insights\n\nFund Flows & Issuance: According to a Wells Fargo report, flows week to date were $0.1 billion and year to date flows stand at $1.2 billion. New issuance for the week was $12.5 billion and year to date issuance is at $48.2 billion.\n\n(Bloomberg) High Yield Market Highlights\n\nNew issues have been well-received\n\nYet it’s looking like a risk-off day as stock futures slide on renewed fears of the spread of the coronavirus\n\nJunk- bond yields have fallen 24bps in the past week. At 5.28%, they’re just 30bps off the 5.5-year low hit on Jan. 21\n\nSpreads have tightened 34bps over the same period to 356bps over Treasuries\n\nEven riskier debt has rallied with yields on CAAs falling below 10% for the first time in two weeks to 9.95%\n\nJunk- bond investors are pouring money back into exchange-traded funds again\n\nHYG and JNK, the two biggest high-yield ETFs, reported a combined inflow of $325m yesterday after $630m the previous day\n\n(New York Times) Some Takeaways From Trump’s State of the Union Address\n\nPresident Trump framed his third year in office as an unmistakable success and his fourth as more of the same.\n\nA partisan atmosphere loomed over the House floor from the very start of Mr. Trump’s speech, when Republican lawmakers chanted “four more years” after the president stepped up to the rostrum. The hostility carried through to the end, when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ripped up a copy of the address after he finished delivering it.\n\nHe proclaimed that the economy was setting records, that American enemies were on the defense, and that the American spirit had been renewed.\n\n“In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America’s destiny,” he said. “We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never going back.”\n\nTrump dived into the state of the economy at the top of the speech, making broad declarations about tax cuts, deregulation and the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the new version of which he signed into law last week.\n\nTrump addressed two pieces of potential health care legislation that remain a top priority for both parties in the coming months: surprise billing and prescription drugs.\n\nAfter signing an initial trade deal with China last month, Mr. Trump pointed on Tuesday to the tariffs he has imposed on the country in order to take on its “massive theft of America’s jobs.” He said that “our strategy has worked.”\n\nTrump’s attention on foreign policy later swung to the Middle East, when he highlighted two people his administration killed in recent months: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, and Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian commander.\n\n(Wall Street Journal) Ford’s Operating Income Plunges\n\nFord Motor Co. said fourth-quarter operating income sank by two-thirds, and it issued a lower-than-expected profit outlook for 2020, the latest signs of trouble for Chief Executive Jim Hackett’s turnaround plan.\n\nFord said operating income for the October-to-December period was $485 million, down from $1.5 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share adjusted for one-time items were 12 cents, well short of analysts’ estimate of 17 cents.\n\nThe company’s financial standing has continued to weaken under Mr. Hackett, who was brought in nearly three years ago to revive the auto maker’s profit growth and give it a stronger vision for the future.\n\nRevenue for the full year dropped 3% to $155.9 billion.\n\n“Financially, it wasn’t OK,” finance chief Tim Stone said of the 2019 results during a discussion with reporters at Ford’s headquarters. “Strategically. . .I think we made strong progress.”\n\nFord pinned the shortfall in part on lower production volumes in North America stemming from problems with launches of key models, including the redesigned Explorer and Escape sport-utility vehicles and its Super Duty pickup truck. It also cited higher warranty costs and a bonus payout to United Auto Workers that totaled about $600 million.\n\nThe auto maker forecast operating profit this year of $5.6 billion to $6.6 billion, compared with $6.38 billion last year. That equals an earnings-per-share range of 94 cents to $1.20, which is lower than the average analysts’ estimate of $1.30, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nHackett’s strategy to revitalize Ford — which includes a multiyear, multibillion-dollar restructuring — hasn’t returned the company to earnings growth or restored profitability overseas, where Ford is closing plants and shedding thousands of workers to cut costs.\n\n“Financially, the company’s 2019 performance was short of our original expectations, mostly because our operational execution — which we usually do very well — wasn’t nearly good enough,” Mr. Hackett said. “We recognize, take accountability for and have made changes because of this.”\n\nIn a bright spot for the year, Ford trimmed its losses in overseas markets. It halved its China loss, to $771 million from $1.55 billion, which it attributed to cost cutting. In Europe, the company had a $47 million loss for the year, down from a $398 million loss a year earlier.\n\nCAM High Yield Weekly Insights\n\nFund Flows & Issuance: According to a Wells Fargo report, flows week to date were -$2.7 billion. New issuance for the week was $8.2 billion and year to date HY is at $35.7 billion.\n\n(Bloomberg) High Yield Market Highlights\n\nS. junk-bonds are heading for their second weekly loss amid fears about the spreading coronavirus from China. Investors pulled $2.7 billion from high-yield retail funds, the biggest cash withdrawal in almost six months, and exchange-traded funds are continuing to leak cash.\n\nJunk-bond returns turned negative for the second time this week posting a loss of 0.16% Thursday. The CAA index posted losses of 0.17% and is also set for its second weekly declines\n\nThose falls may extend Friday with stock futures lower. Oil prices are higher this morning, but fell to an almost six-month low on Thursday, weighing on the high-yield energy index\n\nJunk bond yields rose 9 basis points to 5.49%, the biggest weekly jump since October, while spreads widened 11 basis points to 382 basis points over Treasuries\n\nSingle-B yields jumped 10 basis points to 5.46%, while CAA yields rose 9 basis points to 10.32%\n\nThe two biggest high-yield ETFs — HYG and JNK — saw a combined outflow of $547 million in the last session as outflows continue\n\n(Business Wire) Arconic Reports Financial Results\n\nArconic Inc. reported fourth quarter 2019 and full year 2019 results. The Company reported fourth quarter revenues of $3.4 billion, down 2% year over year. Organic revenue was up 1% year over year on growth in the aerospace, packaging and industrial markets and favorable product pricing, largely offset by weakness in the automotive, commercial transportation, and building and construction markets.\n\nOperating income excluding special items was $444 million, up 37% year over year, driven by net cost reductions, favorable product pricing, and favorable aluminum and raw material costs, partially offset by lower volumes in automotive and commercial transportation. Full year 2019 operating income was $1.0 billion versus $1.3 billion in the full year 2018. Operating income excluding special items for full year 2019 was $1.8 billion versus $1.4 billion in the full year 2018, driven by favorable product pricing; net cost reductions; volume growth in aerospace, packaging and commercial transportation markets; and favorable aluminum and raw material costs. These impacts were partially offset by unfavorable product mix.\n\nArconic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Plant said, “In 2019, the Arconic team delivered improved revenue, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share. Arconic’s 2019 return on net assets improved by 450 basis points year over year to 13.7%.”\n\n(Bloomberg) Fed Holds Main Rate as Powell Stresses Need to Hit 2% Inflation\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate unchanged and continued to signal policy would stay on hold for the time being, while stressing the importance of lifting inflation to officials’ target.\n\nThe central bank also made a technical adjustment to the rate it pays on reserve balances and said it would extend at least through April a program aimed at smoothing volatility in\n\nmoney markets.\n\n“We believe monetary policy is well positioned to serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth,” Chairman Jerome Powell told a press conference Wednesday in Washington.\n\nOfficials kept the target range of the benchmark federal funds rate at 1.5% to 1.75% and called that stance “appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity.”\n\nS. stocks erased gains while yields on the 10-year Treasury note declined and the dollar fluctuated. Traders extended bets the Fed would cut rates toward the end of this year.\n\n“The Fed has made it clear that the barriers to move in either direction are quite high,” said said Daniel Ahn, the chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “But we believe the wall\n\nfor a cut is lower than the wall for a hike.” He detected a “dovish tilt” in Powell’s efforts to stress the Fed was uncomfortable with inflation running persistently too low.\n\nPolicy makers changed their statement to say that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support “inflation returning to the committee’s symmetric 2% objective.” Previously they had said policy was supporting inflation “near” the goal.\n\nPowell explained in his press conference that the change was made to send “a clearer signal” that the committee was not comfortable with inflation running persistently below target. “We wanted to underscore our commitment to 2% not being a ceiling,” he said.\n\nTheir preferred gauge of price pressures — the personal consumption expenditures price index — rose 1.5% for the 12 months ending in November. Powell said inflation was expected to move closer to 2% over the next few months thanks to so-called base effects, “as unusually low readings from early 2019 drop out of the calculation.”"
