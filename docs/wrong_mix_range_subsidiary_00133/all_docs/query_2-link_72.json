        "text": "You have to give UAL's (OTC BB: UALAQ) United Airlines credit for trying. After twice being rejected by the Air Transportation Stabilization Board for federal loan guarantees, the beleaguered airline scaled back its request to a meager $1.1 billion and made a third appeal. Apparently, persistence counts little with the ATSB, which again said it isn't interested in dating and issued a restraining order against any future submissions.\n\nUnited first appealed for federal backing with a $1.8 billion request in December 2002, an application that was summarily dismissed, forcing the airline to seek bankruptcy protection. A second request for $1.6 billion was denied on June 17, when the board concluded that \"granting the loan guarantee wasn't necessary to ensure the viability of the nation's aviation system.\" Today's final ruling against United's third bid was a unanimous declaration that the board saw no justification for reversing its earlier decision.\n\nThe latest setback will seriously hamper United's plans to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy by year-end. Citigroup(NYSE: C) and JP Morgan Chase(NYSE: JPM) had agreed to finance a $2 billion exit package, but only if the bulk of the loan was government-backed. United's fate is now in the hands of private investors.\n\nThe ATSB was originally established to provide liquidity to the airline industry in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. It doesn't exist simply to bail out cost-ridden carriers from slowly fading into obsolescence. Just look at US Airways(Nasdaq: UAIR); it received a $900 million loan guarantee and is now facing the harsh possibility of a second bankruptcy filing. United may disagree with the rationale for today's decision, but ultimately it will profit by it.\n\nPushing United into the capital markets will force the company to clamp down even tighter on costs. Over $5 billion has been slashed (and another $300 million targeted) from the annual budget, including $2.5 billion in payroll savings, but more needs to be done. Critics are quick to point out that United was losing money even before the terrorist attacks, and private investors are going to be reluctant to jump on board without further cost-cutting, a hard look at the company's drastically underfunded pension, and assurances that the nation's second-largest airline has a solid business plan to counter mounting competition from discounters such as Southwest Airlines(NYSE: LUV) and JetBlue Airways(Nasdaq: JBLU).\n\nEven assuming the best, United's shares are likely to be worthless after the company reorganizes out of bankruptcy. Remember what happened to Kmart(Nasdaq: KMRT) last year? The ATSB has wisely chosen not to arbitrarily abrogate the free-market system. United must find a way to compete effectively, or it will not compete at all.\n\nNeed some more in-flight reading material?

The chain of destiny can only be grasped one link at a time.\" -- Sir Winston Churchill\n\nNo Vacation From Viruses\n\nBy\n\nAlyce Lomax (TMF Lomax)\n\nThere's nothing like a new kind of virus to get computer users on edge, and last week there was a new one to contend with. Although it apparently isn't a widespread threat and has since been contained, what is dubbed the Scob Trojan is another example of a virus that uses a different mode of infection. Experts warned that new versions of this same type of attack could be coming, too.\n\nHackers planted malicious code into the Web servers for several reportedly popular sites, so that when users of Microsoft's(Nasdaq: MSFT) Internet Explorer visited the sites, their computers were redirected to a Russian one. There, a malicious Trojan program would download keystroke loggers, designed by virus-writing villains to log credit card numbers, account numbers, and passwords as users punch them in on the Internet.\n\nAt the beginning of this development, the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, or CERT, and Internet Storm Center reportedly suggested that Windows users not use the most widespread Web browser out there -- Internet Explorer. (It seems that machines running Apple(Nasdaq: AAPL) and Linux operating systems were safe from the threat, including those using Internet Explorer for Mac.)\n\nFor Microsoft's part, it suggested that computer users turn the security to \"high\" on their browsers and released instructions for PC users to check if their machines are infected (important, since many machines may have been infiltrated unawares, before the Russian site was blocked) and to install anti-virus software updates. In addition, Bill Gates vowed today that his company will shorten the time it takes to develop and release patches dealing with viral threats -- but enlisted users' help by allowing for auto updates, for example.\n\nJust recently, the monetary threat of viruses became clear as we explored how even a hardware maker like Dell(Nasdaq: DELL) had reason to worry. At the same time, Microsoft was planning to get into anti-virus software, despite what many consider its sketchy track record on security. Then, similar threats reared up in a brand-new sector, as W.D. Crotty discussed the first-ever mobile-phone worm.\n\nMicrosoft's stake in this is, of course, very high -- security concerns surrounding the giant are not a new topic. If incidents like this continue, might loads of people start using Netscape, Mozilla, Opera, or other Web browsers? Or switch to Apple or Linux? Since this virus was planted in websites' servers, on the corporate side, will it encourage more rapid adoption of Linux servers? After all, many people consider the ubiquity of Microsoft to be a veritable breeding ground for viral threats.\n\nGoing forward, though, with e-commerce becoming more and more popular, countless technological concerns have a serious stake in making sure the public retains its trust. Otherwise, the growing popularity of e-commerce could fizzle out.\n\nAlyce Lomax does not own shares of any of the companies mentioned. She occasionally uses Mozilla.\n\nMore on Fool.com Today\n\nIn The Last Word on Netflix, Daniel Hong rallies around a little gem....
