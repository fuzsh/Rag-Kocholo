"SuiteWorld 2023" included several major announcements from Oracle NetSuite. One such announcement was the latest updates to NetSuite Analytics Warehouse (NSAW), the first and only AI-enabled, pre-built cloud data warehouse and analytics solution for NetSuite customers.

The latest updates will help organizations improve data management so customers can quickly build analyses to increase efficiencies and reduce costs, better understand their customers, and leverage data to innovate and grow faster.

NetSuite Analytics Warehouse now is available to customers in North America, Israel, the U.K., Ireland, Spain, France, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Philippines and Singapore.

Evan Goldberg, co-founder and EVP of Oracle NetSuite, says today's organizations need to make sense of the vast volumes of data they create, which can often be an extremely complex and time-consuming task.

"NetSuite Analytics Warehouse changes all this by combining data from many applications and leveraging AI to recognize patterns and turn that data into actionable insights," Goldberg says. "Creating a single source of truth and applying the latest advancements in AI helps our customers quickly unlock value from their data and turn it into a business advantage that drives growth."

Built on Oracle Analytics Cloud and Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), NetSuite Analytics Warehouse leverages AI to harness business data and accelerate value creation.

It consolidates and centralizes data, including NetSuite transactional data, historical data, and data from other cloud or on-premises applications. It then guides the business user on their path to actionable insights.

The latest updates to NetSuite Analytics Warehouse provide the following:

Analytics Embedded in User Dashboards — Customers now can add links to essential and frequently-used visualizations from NetSuite Analytics Warehouse to NetSuite dashboards. Customers can efficiently track key metrics and drill into charts based on NetSuite data blended with other relevant systems' data. This gives direct access to the comprehensive insights needed for data-driven decisions without the need to toggle between applications.

More Frequent Data Refreshes — New data pipeline settings give customers more current insights into their financial, sales, and inventory activity. Customers now have greater flexibility to schedule the frequency and time of data refreshes to get more value from their data.

Enhanced Analysis of Financial Data — The new financial analysis subject area helps customers analyze financial activity from different angles and incorporate more business systems data to identify areas for P&L improvement. The new budget subject area helps to track and adjust resource allocation with budget versus actual scenario analysis.

Deeper Insights — New line-level details enable customers to analyze below summary level into key revenue-impacting subject areas like sales orders and inventory activity. This provides deeper access to role-based business insights and encourages data-backed decision-making across the organization.

Improved User Access Management — New Single Sign-On simplifies user authentication with a single login to NetSuite and NetSuite Analytics Warehouse. In addition, all customers have greater flexibility in applying user view and access rights to analytic content. New roles and dimensions, such as department, subsidiary, and sales territory, enable a user, for example, to view a dashboard chart but not the underlying transaction detail.
