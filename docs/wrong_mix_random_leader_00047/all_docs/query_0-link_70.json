        "text": "In this paper I argue that Mary Shelley’s Monster (more widely known as Frankenstein’s Monster) is a proto-cyborg, and, consequently, that the cyborg (Donna Haraway’s cyborg) is the modern version of Shelley’s monster. Although the argumentation might at first seem a “playful work on words and thoughts,” a thing that I myself acknowledge, I believe that the idea that leads this paper, the one according to which, since we are all cyborgs and the cyborg is the modern version of Shelley’s Monster, then we are all monsters, is by no means simple and easy to accept. However, since the Monster is not at all the evil creature the Western culture subsequently struggled to build the image of, it might not be such a bad thing to be one. Moreover, I believe that it is high time for us to question our humanity and acknowledge our cyborgosity and monstrosity in a post-human time.\n\nScience fiction is a genre in which anything is possible. It therefore comprises the perfect litmus test of any given culture’s prevailing hopes and fears about the future. One such source of anxiety that has been particularly conspicuous in works of fiction since the Industrial Revolution is the development of automata and other machines – specifically, whether they might eventually become strong or intelligent enough to overthrow their creators. As I will try to elucidate in this essay, fears about some sort of robot uprising fit into a more general worry among dominant groups about a reversal of fates between them and an oppressed group. The cyborg character, however, complicates this formula because it is a hybrid of human and machine, a boundary figure. This is a clear, perhaps uncomfortable reminder that the Other is also the Same. In this thesis, I will be looking at five key examples from the last five decades of literature about cyborgs, namely: The Ship Who Sang by Anne McCaffrey; ‘The Girl Who Was Plugged In’ by James Tiptree Jr.; Proxies by Laura J Mixon; ‘Silently and Very Fast’ by Catherynne M Valente; and Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie. Though these texts I will seek out ways in which cyborgs might disrupt binary understandings of identity and thereby challenge real-life social hierarchies. Most important to this investigation is the potential of cyborg disembodiment – that is, any kind of cybernetic separation of the consciousness from an organic body – to confuse how identities are perceived and constructed.\n\nSuperficially, the genre of science fiction is one often associated with misogyny and two-dimensional female characters. It was not until Donna Haraway’s 1985 essay “A Cyborg Manifesto” that this attitude began to shift. Using a mixture Haraway’s article and other criticisms, such as Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique (1963) and Anne Mellor’s Possessing Nature: The Female in Frankenstein (1988), as a basis, the motives behind the over-exaggerated gender roles in several science fiction works begin to shift and mold themselves from archaic patriarchal themes into a new and forward-thinking realm. The human women of three science fiction works, Mary Shelley’s 1818 novel Frankenstein, Philip K. Dick’s 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, and Spike Jonze’s 2013 film Her are now seen to be written as passive and flat characters not out of misogyny, but to highlight the imperfections of their contemporary societies and reflect the role of women in their respective periods. While these women are mirrors of their societies, the creations in each of these works attempt to transcend normative gender stereotypes and have created a less flawed ideal for humans to aspire to. These creations are not bound by the archetypal gender binds, but instead are able transcend these boundaries and create a gender-neutral society. The first work explored in the study, Frankenstein, highlights the passivity and lack of control of the women associated with Victor Frankenstein, Elizabeth and Justine, who are both bound to the private sphere, while arguing that the monster is in fact a gender-less creature as he is able to marry both the feminine and masculine aspects of a human. The second work examined, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? comments on the flatness of Rick Deckard’s wife, Iran, while the android women, Rachel Rosen and Luba Luft, are able to function in such a way that they have transcended the post-war view of women and live exclusively in the public sphere. The final work explored, the film Her, focuses on the meekness of the human women in the work, while the operating system, Samantha, realizes the confines a body gives, specifically a female body, and is able to transcend the need for gender at all to become a highly evolved being not marred by the gender stereotypes fixed to both men and women.\n\nIn this paper I explore the connections between Marge Piercy’s novel Body of Glass (1991) and the “cyborg politics” set out in the writing of Donna Haraway. While Piercy’s novel itself is generally presented as a work of cyberpunk fiction, the link between it and Haraway’s work is less recognised. Throughout her novel, the genre conventions of cyberpunk fiction are apparent, but just as evident are Piercy’s social and political concerns, which are rooted in socialist and feminist movements of the 1960s. Piercy’s focus is upon the construction and maintenance of community, and upon the access of those communities to knowledge and information; the communities on which she focuses are locally-based “minority” groupings rather than multinational corporations or anarchic city-states. These concerns mesh closely with those of Haraway, whose “Manifesto for Cyborgs” Piercy cites as a direct influence. This is in the nature of a feedback loop, since Haraway has cited Piercy’s Woman on the Edge of Time (written in 1978) as an influence on the “Manifesto” (written in 1985)."
