He graduated from Saranac Central in 1972, and went on to earn a B.A. in English at the University of Notre Dame and an M.A. in Anglo-Irish Literature at Leeds University (U.K.) Coffey’s career in publishing in New York City, most notably 26 years at Publishers Weekly, was punctuated with published writings of his own—three innovative books of poems, a popular book on Irish-American history, a baseball book, and a book of short stories, titled The Business of Naming Things (Bellevue Literary Press). His hybrid fiction Samuel Beckett Is Closed was published in 2018 by Foxrock Books, in association with Evergreen Review and OR Books. His new book, Beckett’s Children: A Literary Memoir, will be published this summer, also from Evergreen Review and OR Books. He lives in Manhattan.\n\nTRACY DOLAN is a staple of Vermont’s standup comedy scene and regularly entertains audiences at Vermont Comedy Club and many other venues throughout New England.

Never meant to be a money-making venture, Ra Press was an enterprise founded with a deep respect for the written word. Emulating the look of the small presses of the 60s and 70s, Ra Press began in 2000 with experimental books fashioned in the Donohue family home in the deep woods outside Ticonderoga. Creating books—the very act of measuring and cutting and binding—became an obsession for Dave Donohue. He was inspired by the poetry books he had read and collected since first reading Ferlinghetti’s Coney Island of the Mind during his high school years in 1960s Port Henry. Dave officially began Ra Press by publishing the works of Chuck Gibson and Mary L. Randall, two previously published writers and dear friends. The first seven years were filled with creating the books and finding homes for them in the Champlain Valley and beyond—a slow and challenging assignment. By 2008, Ra began printing books with REPRO (Winooski, VT). In 2012, poet Sean Tierney took over the outreach of the press by formatting books on the LULU online site. Over the last decade, RA Press books have found homes via bookstores in Long Lake and Bolton Landing and, ultimately, in Crow BookShop in Burlington. No less than fifty writers (both seasoned and new) have published their works through Ra. Sadly, like so many small presses, Ra Press is closing in 2024. Dave measured his success by literary quality only and he’s proud of the work produced, the statements made. Ra Press reminded people that poetry matters,the written word matters, and literature can be personal, intimate, and close to the bone.\n\nGREG EDWARDS is a fearless comedian from Virginia.
