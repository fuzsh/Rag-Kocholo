        "text": "Here’s to a happy 2024! I hope you had a successful reading year. Maybe you pulled down some dusty tome that you’ve wanted to dive into for a decade. I’d like to imagine you finally picked up a book I raved about in years past that you acquired with great anticipation but never opened. Whether you are a lurker, occasional visitor, or a regular commenter, thank you for your continued support and wonderful conversation.\n\nWhat were your favorite vintage SF reads–published pre-1985–of 2023? Let me know in the comments.\n\nContinuing a trend, I read only a handful of novels this year. Instead, my obsessions focused on my science short story review initiatives (listed below), collections, and histories of the science fiction genre. Without further ado, here are my favorite novels and short stories I read in 2023 with bonus categories. I made sure to link my longer reviews where applicable if you want a deeper dive into the rich seam of science fictional gems.\n\nCheck out last year’s rundown if you haven’t already for more spectacular reads. I have archived all my annual rundowns on my article index page if you wanted to peruse earlier years.\n\nMy Top 5 Science Fiction Novels of 2022\n\n1. Edgar Pangborn’s Davy (1964), 5/5 (Masterpiece): Nominated for the 1965 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Full review.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhich books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Under Compulsion (variant title: Fun with Your New Head), Thomas M. Disch (1968)\n\nFrom the back cover: “A BLACK BANQUET OF PURE DISCH\n\nA part-human, part-electronic brain going slowly mad in the Venus jungle.\n\nThe last man on earth rejecting the last woman.\n\nA Russian astronaut looking for a good reason to die on the moon.\n\nA chilling glimpse of a 21st century America where war is peace, freedom is slavery and ignorance is strength–and they like it like that.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhich books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. The Company of Glory, Edgar Pangborn (serialized 1974, novel 1975)\n\nFrom the back cover: “BEHOLD DEMETRIOS! With the same rich imagination and dazzling insights that won him the International Fantasy award, Edgar Pangborn weaves a magical tapestry set far in man’s future.\n\nIt is a time when man, struggling to rise above the ashes of nuclear holocaust, has returned to the simpler values and lifestyles of medieval times. And in this society, Demetrios the storyteller is revered among men for his captivating tales of the Old Time, with its miraculous Telephones, and Jet Planes, and TV, and Automobiles. But Demetrios is also feared–for one storyteller with a head full of ancient truth can be dangerous.\n\nSo Demetrios is forced to flee, with six compatriots, and together they embark on a journey full of unexpected sorrows, and unimagined delights, a journey through realms of fantasy, philosophy, and rich human possibility, which the reader will be delighted and privileged to share.”\n\nInitial Thoughts: After reveling in Pangborn’s masterpiece Davy (1964), I decided to acquire everything in the Tales of a Darkening World sequence I didn’t own already. According to Spider Robinson, the editor at Pyramid Books cut portions of the novel that was serialized in Galaxy… Inset image is from Robinson’s intro to Still I Persist in Wondering (1978).\n\nContinue reading →\n\nToday I’ve reviewed the twenty-second and twenty-third story in my series on the science fictional media landscape of the future. In “Thing of Beauty” (1958) Damon Knight speculates on something very similar to AI art. And in “You’re Another” (1960) Knight conjures a delirious manifestation of reality TV unlike any other. I’ve gone ahead and included reviews of the rest of the stories in Knight’s collection Far Out (1961).\n\nPreviously: Ray Bradbury’s “Almost the End of the World” (1959).\n\nUp Next: Richard Matheson’s “Through Channels” (April 1951).\n\nRobert F. Young’s “Audience Reaction” (February 1954).\n\n3.5/5 (Collated rating: Good)\n\nDamon Knight’s impact on the science fiction field can be felt to this day. He founded the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America and co-founded two influential science fiction workshops (Milford and Clarion). Knight also edited the Orbit series of anthologies, notable for their larger-than-average number of female science fiction authors and overall quality–I’ve reviewed Orbit 1 (1966), Orbit 3 (1968), Orbit 4 (1968), and Orbit 8 (1970) so far. I can’t help but notice that his fiction, on the other hand, has faded a bit from popular knowledge. I struggle to identify a masterpiece Knight novel. Did he write one?\n\nI’ve enjoyed his short fiction, notably “Down There” (1973) and “I See You” (1976), immensely. With that in mind, I consumed my first collection of his short stories. I can add “The Enemy” (1958), “You’re Another” (1955), and “Cabin Boy” (1951) to my list of favorite Knight visions.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nWhich books/covers/authors intrigue you? Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n1. Planet of the Damned, Harry Harrison (serialized 1961)\n\nFrom the back cover: “Brion Brandd of the Galactic CRF had a problem. It was the planet Dis. Brion’s assignment was to salvage it.\n\nDis was a harsh, inhospitable, dangerous place and the Disans made it worse. They might have been a human once–but they were something else now.\n\nThe Disans had only one desire–kill! Kill everything, themselves, their planet, the universe if they could–\n\nBRION HAD MINUTES TO STOP THEM–IF HE COULD FIND OUT HOW!”\n\nInitial Thoughts: Smells like a variation of Harrison’s Deathworld (1960), which I never managed to review, from a year earlier. Which isn’t a good sign… Planet of the Damned was a finalist for the 1962 Hugo for Best Novel. It lost to Robert A. Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land (1961).\n\nContinue reading →\n\n1. Ben Bova is not a site favorite…. But I’m willing to give a handful of his better known novels a shot. Here is the first (in the internal chronology) of the Kinsman sequence. Low hopes.\n\nIf you want to know why I have low hopes check out these three reviews:\n\nAs on a Darkling Plain (1972)\n\nThe Dueling Machine (1969)\n\nStar Watchman (1964)\n\n2. Side 1 of an Ace Double. Suzette Haden Elgin’s The Communipaths is the first in her Coyote Jones sequence. I had mixed views on the third volume: At the Seventh Level (1972).\n\n3. Side 2 of an Ace Double. Back in 2012 I reviewed Louis Trimble’s intriguing SF allegorical city tale The City Machine (1972). It was a competent work that, in the hands of a more polished writer, could have been so much more. Not sure what to expect from this one…. the zany nature of the blurb is off-putting.\n\n4. Josephine Saxton’s The Hieros Gamos of Sam and An Smith (1969) still haunts me. I need to read more of her short fiction.\n\n5. And finally, my Orbit anthology series collection grows!\n\nPrevious reviews:\n\nOrbit 1 (1966)\n\nOrbit 3 (1968)\n\nOrbit 4 (1968)\n\nOrbit 8 (1970)\n\nLet me know what books/covers intrigue you. Which have you read? Disliked? Enjoyed?\n\n~\n\n1. Kinsman, Ben Bova (1979)\n\n(Uncredited cover for the 1981 edition) Continue reading →\n\n(Dennis Anderson’s cover for the 1973 edition)\n\n4/5 (Collated rating: Good)\n\nFor an anthology, bound to contain a filler story or two, this one is spectacular. Robert Silverberg’s New Dimensions 3 (1973) lives up to his claim to contain “stories that demonstrate vigorous and original ways [often experimental] of approaching the body of ideas, images, and concepts that is science fiction” yet do not sacrifice “emotional vitality, or clarity of insight.” Ursula K. Le Guin, with her rumination on utopias, and James T. Tipree, Jr.’s proto-cyberpunk tale of commercialism and performing gender, deliver some of their best work.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n1) Futuristic city? Yes! Is more needed? Okay, okay, I concede, more is needed. I hope Gotschalk’s novel with its fantastic Dean Ellis cover delivers. Among the least known of the Ace Science Fiction Special series…\n\nCheck out my older reviews of J. G. Ballard’s “Billennium” (1961), Future City, ed. Roger Elwood (1973), and The World Inside, Robert Silverberg (1971) for more SF on this theme of futuristic cities. If you delve through the archives you’ll find many more examples.\n\n2) Ballard blurbs Martin Bax’s novel as “…the most exciting, stimulating and brilliantly conceived book I have read since Burroughs’ novels.” Hyperbole aside, the two reviews (here and here) I’ve read of Bax’s sole novel puts this at the top of my “to read” pile.\n\nI have cheated a bit by including the cover for the first New Directions edition rather than the later Picador edition I own due to the cover quality.\n\n3) Three acquisitions posts ago (here) I mentioned that the premise of Marge Piercy’s Dance the Eagle to Sleep (1970) did not inspire me to read it anytime soon. Thankfully I found a copy of what many consider her masterpiece Woman at the Edge of Time (1976) cheap at the local used book store.\n\n4) I am not sure why I picked this collection up—I’ve heard good things about Joe Haldeman’s introduction which draws on his experience in the Vietnam War. As Isaac Asimov, Mack Reynolds, etc are not normally authors who intrigue me, I might do something I rarely do and read and review Effinger’s story only (and maybe Poul Anderson’s as he’s better in short form)…\n\nAs always thoughts and comments are welcome.\n\n~\n\n1. Growing up in Tier 3000, Felix C. Gotschalk (1976)\n\n(Dean Ellis’ gorgeous cover for the 1976 edition) Continue reading →"
