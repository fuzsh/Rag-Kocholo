Le Guin, Doris Lessing and Marge Piercy - Free ebook download as PDF File (.pdf), Text File (.txt) or read book online for free. This thesis examines speculative novels by Margaret Atwood, Ursula K. Le Guin, Doris Lessing, and Marge Piercy to trace an ecological ethic of respect for other beings. It argues that their novels explore this ethic through tensions between utopian and dystopian visions. The thesis contextualizes the novels in the fields of science fiction and speculative fiction, showing how a shift from critical utopias to dystopias reflects changing treatment of the ecological crisis. It provides close readings of selected early and later novels by each author to analyze how they realize ecological philosophy through fiction and how increasing dystopianism reflects greater urgency around addressing othering in light of the ecological crisis.",
