The setting of this poem starts in the city of Trujillo in the Dominican Republic, which was renamed for the brutal dictator Rafael Trujillo; however, it eventually changes to New York when the family succeeds to escape. The speaker is a young girl who is unsophisticated to the world; therefore, she does not know what is happening to her family, even though she surmises that something is wrong. The author uses an extended metaphor throughout the poem to compare “swimming” and escaping the Dominican Republic. Through the line “A hurried bag, allowing one toy a piece,” (13) it feels as if the family were exiled or forced to leave its country. The title of the poem “Exile,” informs the reader that there was no choice for the family but to leave the Dominican Republic, but certain words and phrases reiterate the title. In this poem, the speaker expresser her feeling about fleeing her home and how isolated she feels in the United States.\n\nLieutenant Nun by Doña Catalina de Erauso\n\n1093 Words | 3 Pages\n\n“From Lieutenant Nun,” a memoir written by doña Catalina de Erauso, tells an intriguing story of a young Spanish female and her advantageous journey through Spain and the New World. Her family intends for her to become a nun but, that is not the life she seeks for herself. Therefore, she breaks away from the convent in hopes of finding somewhere to make her fortune by passing as a male. Catalina’s story is noteworthy because it gives readers another perspective of exploration focusing on self-discovery during the seventeenth century emphasizing how passing as a male is the only thing that secured her ability to explore. In the memoir, Catalina repeatedly reminisces about clothing and, whether she consciously or unconsciously does so, she allows the reader to see that this is an important aspect of her exploration. Throughout Catalina’s journey, clothing plays an increasingly important role not only in her travels but, also her personal life because it symbolized ones status, role, gender and privileges.\n\nThe Family Love By Eudora Welty\n\n802 Words | 2 Pages\n\nHYPOTHETICAL INTRODUCTION: Eudora Welty’s short story « Why I Live at the P.O. » is a story of family relationships. The narrator, Sister, imposes her point of view to the reader about the disturbing return of her sister, Stella-Rondo. By confronting Stella-Rondo, Sister gradually becomes a stranger to her family, and eventually leaves the family home to live in the post office where she works. In this paper, I will question the point of view of the narrator, who is rather unreliable. Also, I will analyze how denial can lead to isolation. Finally, I will study how Welty’s use of irony affects the story.\n\nAmerica And I By Anzia Yezierska Analysis\n\n426 Words | 1 Pages\n\nThe busy season for the shop she was working on came and the owner of the shop kept demanding for what we call overtime. She got fired after she said, “I only want to go home. I only want the evening to myself!.” Yezierska was regretful and bitter about what happened because she ended up in cold and hunger. After a while she became a trained worker and acquired a better shelter. An English class for foreigners began in the factory she was working for. She went to the teacher for advice in how to find what she wanted to do. The teacher advised her to join the Women’s Association, where a group of American women helps people find themselves. One of the women in the social club hit her with the reality that “America is no Utopia.” Yezierska felt so hopeless. She wondered what made Americans so far apart from her, so she began to read the American history. She learned the difference between her and the Pilgrims. When she found herself on the lonely, untrodden path, she lost heart and finally said that there’s no America. She was disappointed and depressed in the\n\nSialocele Research Paper\n\n539 Words | 2 Pages\n\nThese physicians carefully dissect around the delicate structures that overlie and surround the salivary glands thereby preventing potentially serious complications such as facial paralysis, taste distortion, and disfigurement. Once resection of the affected salivary gland has been completed, proper management of the remaining glandular tissues is crucial to avoid sialocele formation. An experienced specialist will ensure that after removing or altering the glandular structure, they identify and seal off any left over tributaries to the ductal system. This painstaking and advanced technique inhibits sialocele formation by preventing saliva from pooling within surrounding tissues of the cheek. The proper postoperative care comprised of close followup and dietary modifications are also important factors in sialocele prevention. A salivary gland specialist will closely follow you and examine your surgical site for proper drain management, wound healing, scar formation, and infection prevention. Special compressive dressings and small drains are placed at the surgical site to promote proper fluid drainage as well as to close off any potential areas where saliva can accumulate. In addition to suppressing sialocele formation, this deters bacterial\n\nHenry Ford: The History Of The Ford Motor Company\n\n962 Words | 2 Pages\n\nHe received investments from all over to help form the Henry Ford Company in 1899. Ford’s father was proud to see his son’s name on automobiles, but was frustrated when Ford needed to constantly improve the efficiency. Ford left his namesake company in 1902 for financial reasons. After he left, it changed names to the Cadillac Motor Car Company. Later that year, Ford founded the Ford Motor Company. A month after the company was formed, the Ford Model A was built at the Ford Motor Plant in Detroit. Only a couple of these cars were able to be made every day, so sales were slow. There were only about 2 to 3 workers to assemble these cars. But Ford was motivated to create an efficient and consumer friendly automobile. These innovations resulted in the Ford Model T. The Model T was a great liftoff for Ford and his company, and as a result, he practiced techniques of mass production the would change American Industry, including using large production plants. The mass production technique made it easier for people to assemble cars and the rate of producing these cars were much quicker. It was also a cheaper way to produce automobiles, and in 1914, Ford was able to raise the daily wage to 5 dollars. Production skyrocketed for the Model T and by 1918, half of America had purchased these inexpensive and readily available cars. In 1919, Ford made his son Edsel as the president of the company, but Ford still kept control of the company’s day to day operations. That same year, Ford stopped making the Model T and invented the New and improved Model A , which had better horsepower and brakes, and better overall improvements. By this time, Ford had sold 15 million Model T’s and had opened plants that manufactured the Model\n\nComparison of Characters in “Story of an Hour” and “Chrysanthemums”\n\n768 Words | 2 Pages\n\nHow does one compare the life of women to men in late nineteenth century to mid-twentieth century America? In this time the rights of women were progressing in the United States and there were two important authors, Kate Chopin and John Steinbeck. These authors may have shown the readers a glimpse of the inner sentiments of women in that time. They both wrote a fictitious story about women’s restraints by a masculine driven society that may have some realism to what women’s inequities may have been. The trials of the protagonists in both narratives are distinctive in many ways, only similar when it totals the macho goaded culture of that time. Even so, In Backpack Literature: An Introduction to Fiction, Poetry, Drama, and Writing we hold two unlike fictional characters in two very different short stories similar to Elisa Allen in the “Chrysanthemums” and Mrs. Louise Mallard in “The Story of an Hour”, that have unusual struggles that came from the same sort of antagonist.\n\nThe Yellow Wallpaper from the Point of View of a Doctor's Wife\n\n992 Words | 2 Pages\n\nIn the story, the narrator is forced to tell her story through a secret correspondence with the reader since her husband forbids her to write and would “meet [her] with heavy opposition” should he find her doing so (390). The woman’s secret correspondence with the reader is yet another example of the limited viewpoint, for no one else is ever around to comment or give their thoughts on what is occurring. The limited perspective the reader sees through her narration plays an essential role in helping the reader understand the theme by showing the woman’s place in the world. At ..."
