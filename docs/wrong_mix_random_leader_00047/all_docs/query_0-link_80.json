Beforehand what\nyou have is a tedious\ndelusion, a hobby like knitting.\n\nWork is what you have done\nafter the play is produced\nand the audience claps.\nBefore that friends keep asking\nwhen you are planning to go\nout and get a job.\n\nGenius is what they know you\nhad after the third volume\nof remarkable poems. Earlier\nthey accuse you of withdrawing,\nask why you donâ€™t have a baby,\ncall you a bum.\n\nThe reason people want M.F.A.â€™s,\ntake workshops with fancy names\nwhen all you can really\nlearn is a few techniques,\ntyping instructions and some-\nbody elseâ€™s mannerisms\n\nis that every artist lacks\na license to hang on the wall\nlike your optician, your vet\nproving you may be a clumsy sadist\nwhose fillings fall into the stew\nbut youâ€™re certified a dentist.\n\nThe real writer is one\nwho really writes. Talent\nis an invention like phlogiston\nafter the fact of fire.\nWork is its own cure. You have to\nlike it better than being loved.\n\nðŸŒˆðŸŒˆðŸŒˆ\n\n#artistsofinstagram #writersofinstagram #writing #makersgonnamake #margepiercy #poetry #poetrygram #keepgoing #creatoreconomy\".",
