        "text": "Climate Action Alert: Is YOUR state legislature attempting to undo some of the damage to our planet? Mine is, and I have advocacy work to do today, which I know about because of my state's Unitarian Universalist Legislative Ministry. Go here to see if your state has a one-stop shop for action alerts on matters of social justice, climate justice in particular.\n\nIt's time to return to my self-led poetry study, in\n\nwhich I revisit books on my shelf that never received proper attention. Let's begin with the very first poem in UPSIDE DOWN AND INSIDE OUT: Poems for All Your Pockets by Bobbi Katz. This little volume has a layered history: it's a 1992 Wordsong reissue of the original 1973 collection, and it's signed by Bobbi herself to someone named Mary Krogness--but it also bears a stamp on the inside and a label on the outside to let us know that this book belongs to the library of Aquita Sanford! I acquired it hmmmmm from a used-book dealer? It also has a barcode label that looks rather newer.\n\nI met Bobbi on a few occasions in the 2000's, and she's the person who said, when I mentioned my family was moving to Paris for a year, that she knew a children's poet who lived there, an English woman named Sandra Guy. Unbelievably, it turned out that Sandra lived LITERALLY ACROSS THE STREET from our exchange apartment in Vincennes--of all the addresses in Paris! Thanks to Bobbi, I had a faithful critique partner during that year in France.\n\nBut I digress...here's that first poem.\n\nHow I Got to Be a Princess: An Autobiographical Note | Bobbi Katz\n\nYesterday my friend said,\n\n\"You look just like a princess.”\n\nI could not believe him.\n\nWas he talking to someone else?\n\nI looked behind me\n\nand\n\nin front of me.\n\nI looked under the bed\n\nand\n\non top of the closet.\n\nNo one else was there.\n\nAgain my friend said,\n\n“You look just like a princess.”\n\nHe really said it to ME!\n\nI felt all twinkling inside.\n\nThat’s how I got to be a princess.\n\nThis is a pretty unusual poem for Bobbi--most of her work is rhyme-and-meter perfection, playful and very definitely early-childhood friendly, not usually autobiographical. (For those familiar, this volume also includes the original \"Things to Do If You Are\" form, with \"a Subway\", \"a Flower,\" \"the Snow\" and \"a Pizza,\" among others. Bow down to Bobbi!)\n\nNext I pulled down THE MOON IS ALWAYS FEMALE by Marge Piercy (Alfred A. Knopf, 1980). I don't know where I got this one either, but I swear, despite knowing of Marge Piercy since I was in college (Wesleyan University, whose press published her first two collections), I don't think I have ever opened this book, considered a \"classic text of the feminist movement.\" My loss, my goodness!\n\nMarge (b. 1936) is roughly the same age as Bobbi (b. 1933) and I am. so. fascinated. by the juxtaposition of Bobbi's princess poem and this stanza from Marge's longer poem \"Excursions, incursions\".\n\nExcursions, incursions | Marge Piercy\n\nPrincess and godmother, girls and women, viewed and twinkled and labeled and priced: may they yet declare themselves queens of their own being? I hope that both poets, now in their 80s, continue well and comfortable, and I am so grateful for their voices."
