        "text": "ONE\n\nA FAMILY OF SEVEN\n\nDo I have faith in my memory? Who doesn’t? How can I not trust memory. It is as if I were to develop a mistrust for my right hand or my left foot. Yet I am quite aware that my memory is far from perfect. I frequently forget events and people that my husband, Ira Wood, remembers, and similarly, I remember incidents that have slipped away from him. I rarely remember things incorrectly; mostly I remember clearly or I forget completely.\n\nI have distinct memories of events that happened before I was born or for which I was not present. This comes from having heard the stories told vividly by my mother or my grandmother when I was little and imagining those scenes and the people in them so clearly and intensely that I experience them as my own. I have precise memories of the voice and face of my mother’s father, who died ten years before I was born. Stories about him that I heard as a child were so real to me that I created him as a living personage.\n\nI have trouble remembering periods of intense pain. The summer my second marriage was disintegrating around me was a time I so hated every moment that it has almost vanished into the limbo of repressed pain. Sometimes a sound or a smell or a voice will break that seal of willful forgetfulness and out will slither those poisonous days and nights. Once that has happened with events, I will not again forget. They are filed in a different part of my memory and can be summoned, or will drift up unbidden to torment me. But they are no longer vanquished, vanished.\n\nI am convinced that all those people I write about would remember events and patterns of events quite differently than I do. After all, memory changes. Our pasts constantly change. When a friend betrays us or turns against us, the past is rewritten to prefigure that betrayal, that loss of intimacy and faith. When a love affair ends, we read the causes backward into the quarrels, even the minor disagreements. Those months of the inexplicable allergic sniffles of a friend suddenly become clues once we learn of their cocaine addiction. Someone we had scarcely known becomes an important figure in our lives, and in retrospect, every small meeting or passage together is invested with significance. Remembering is like one of those old-fashioned black-and-white-tile floors: wherever I stand or sit, the tiles converge upon me. So our pasts always seem to lead us directly to our present choices. We turn and make a pattern of the chaos of our lives so that we belong exactly where we are. Everything is a prefiguring of our current loves and antipathies, work and faith. We compose a future that leads from where we believe we are at the moment. When the present changes, past and future change significantly with it.\n\nThis is, after all, my perspective on my life, not anyone else’s. It is neither true nor false in a large sense, because my truth of events is not the same as that of the others who lived them with me. To create a faithful autobiography would require as many years in the telling as the living of it, with transcriptions of every casual meandering conversation about what kind of soup to have for lunch, the weather, a movie seen last week. It would be filled with dirty bathrooms and clean laundry, bills paid and unpaid, overdue library books, hems to mend. We spend more time doing dishes than we do making love, but which figures prominently in the story of our lives? We choose, therefore, only certain events, certain people, certain points of crisis and joy. It is an extremely stylized map, with most of the byways omitted, even the most interesting and lovely and dangerous byways, because we are always hastening to arrive where we now think it is important and inevitable that we live.\n\nI try to make myself look good, but I am aware that sometimes my honesty and my attachment to what happened prevent me from presenting myself as the blameless heroine. I usually try to do the best I can from day to day, but my best is often flawed and skewed, and sometimes I try to inflict harm. I aim to be good, but sometimes I am best at being at least mildly wicked. I frequently misjudge situations and people and blunder in where I should avoid. I talk myself into relationships that are good for no one, and certainly not for me. Or if good for me, bad for the other person. As I look at my life, I like the work I have done, but I often dislike how I have behaved with other people. I have intended to be a better friend and lover than I have turned out to be.\n\nI think for the most part as time has gone on, I have become a better person in my most intimate relationships and in my relationships with the natural world and with my cats. I do not think I am any more effective politically than I was thirty years ago—probably less so. I assume leadership more warily. I am a better writer, but I stand behind the earlier novels and poetry. My life has been full of blunders, misprisions, accidents, losses, so no wonder I forget. If I did not forget much, how could I possibly continue? At the end, I will forget everything.\n\nWhy a memoir now? Well, I am about to turn sixty-five. In common with a lot of baby boomers—the generation after mine but the one I often identify with—I am still surprised that I have aged. I got to have two adolescences, one at the normal time, and a second one in Students for a Democratic Society during the 1960s. I was so used to thinking of myself as young that I still have to correct my inner vision to what I really am chronologically and in my body. It seems like a time to reflect, reexamine, make amends and corrections—a sort of High Holidays of the soul in which I judge what I’ve done and left undone. I have been a busy actor in my time. People who call me prolific often imagine I do little but write, but I have had my fingers in a great many boiling pots.\n\nIn every community there is a cat lady. In the Cape Cod village where I live, there are people who have never read a word I have written and may not be aware I have written at all, but they know that if they have a cat problem, I am the person to call. They also call me when a cat has been killed or died, for they know I won’t mock their grief. This story is about the central relationships in my life and how I survived the bad ones and was strengthened by the good ones. It is primarily about me, but my life has a spine of cats, and it is also about them.\n\nI have been many people in my life. We all change as we take new lovers and partners, as we take on new tasks, new jobs, new interests. Yet there have been constants: my need to write, my drive to write what was meaningful to me and I hope to other people, my desire to love and be loved, my valuing of freedom as close to an absolute, and of course my companions, the cats whose love was there when others failed me or I failed them.\n\nI’ve lived with cats throughout my life, and I have more cats as time diminishes. My cats are among my friends, different in kind but not in importance from my human friends. Your relationship with a kitten has a maternal component, but once the cat has reached what she considers maturity, long before you think she is adult, she begins to contest your will with her own considerable intent. The bond becomes more nearly a relationship in which each makes accommodations to the other, attempts to learn and to teach, strives to understand and be understood and also to dominate, to rule. The love of a cat is unconditional but always subject to negotiation. You are never entirely in charge.\n\nI was married twice before, but I have been with Ira Wood longer than the first two marriages put together—and far more intimately. Ira is younger than me—a tradition in my mother’s family. My mother was older than my father, and her oldest sister had about the same age gap—fourteen years—with her younger husband as I have with Ira. He is four inches taller than me and much stronger. He is solidly built and has a great need for physical exercise. His hair is brown and densely curly. When I met him in 1976, he wore it in a huge Afro, which is its natural condition if left to grow out. Nowadays he keeps it fairly short. He has changeable green eyes and a ruddy complexion. He has always been a very good looking man, but it was his character I fell in love with. He has a great capacity for love, a giving nature in close relationships, a delicious sense of humor and strong sensuality combined with a bright inquiring mind. Although we both have quick tempers and too much impatience, we are well suited. We feel we are each other’s bashert, each other’s true intended. When we were first involved and again when we decided to marry, many people disapproved or were shocked by the age discrepancy and told me obliquely or with great and unappreciated directness that I was going to get dumped, that a woman cannot marry a man so much younger. I lost friends by my choice, but I gained my best friend.\n\nThis memoir focuses on my emotional life, not on my literary or political adventures, or most of my friendships. When I was fifteen, my life changed radically and permanently. In that year, I lost one of my best friends to a heroin overdose; my gentle intelligent cat was poisoned by neighbors because an African-American family was moving into our house; and my grandmother Hannah, to whom I was very close and who was my religious mentor, died of stomach cancer. My family moved to a larger house where I had a room of my own with a door that shut, and I began to write. I withdrew from the street gang I had belonged to and withdrew from my early sexual adventures. In my life, what comes before that point almost belongs to someone else, although there are many continuities. What came afterward is me. I changed, I learned, I developed, I grew, but after those events, I became a poet and a fiction writer and the person I still am. It has, nonetheless, been a long, rough journey from central city Detroit to the edge of this freshwater marsh in Massachusetts.\n\nIra and I and our five cats—Dinah, Oboe, Max, Malkah and the kitten Efi—live on four acres on Cape Cod, miles out to sea. Why do I live in a village? I was born in the smoking amphetamine heart of Detroit and lived in many cities—Chicago, San Francisco, Brooklyn, Paris, Boston, Manhattan. I’ve traveled a lot, and being a poet means doing gigs all over. I find I can write here with fewer interruptions and fewer temptations to fuss about my career than was possible in New York. We are two hours from Boston and drive back and forth frequently to see friends, do readings or hear them, use libraries, buy wine, shop, attend concerts or plays. We refuse to let ourselves blink at the commute, because we can enjoy city pleasures and country quiet and beauty.\n\nTwo of our cats are elderly. As I write this, Dinah is seventeen and a half and her son Oboe is sixteen and some months. Dinah is the smallest cat, and the feistiest. Korats are gray, cobby cats with deep green eyes and a silken silvery gray coat. Her earlier dulcet voice has changed, peremptory, almost fierce with a sharp husky insistence that pierces walls. She cries her desires like a hawk. She has always been able to throw the much bigger male cats across the room when she is annoyed, and she takes no guff. She gets stepped on all too frequently because she lies down in the center of the hall or doorway and will not move. She is six pounds of intense willpower, healthy for her age and sometimes playful. She is obsessively jealous of Ira. Her son Oboe, however, is allowed any attention. With all the other cats, she counts the strokes they get.\n\nI sometimes call my husband Woody, his nickname, and sometimes Ira and sometimes Wood. He calls me Marge or Piercy about equally, as well as other names I will not mention. He has multiple names for the cats. Dinah is Dweeze or Dweezelle. Sometimes Munchkin or Moochie. He is a giver of nicknames.\n\nDinah fell in love with Ira when she was ten weeks old, and he remains her passion. It is morning. Ira gets up first and makes cappuccino downstairs. When I am home alone or he is ill and I make the coffee, it takes me an hour. Until I have coffee, I can’t do anything, including make coffee, so it is a farce. Afterward ground coffee and water and milk are spilled all over the kitchen. I do 90 percent of the cooking, but not in the morning. Me in the kitchen when I am half asleep is an accident in the making. I do not rise with full coordination. I rise bleary and shambling, Frankenstein’s monster imperfectly fitted together.\n\nWhen Ira goes downstairs, Dinah must go with him talking in her high raspy voice, oversee his making coffee, and then she must jump up on the high ledge in the bathroom to observe his first piss. What this means to her we have no idea, but she is insistent on her privileges. If something is missing from the order of the morning, she plants herself in the middle of the kitchen floor and tells us loudly that we are out of line and must shape up. We have our cappuccino in bed and Dinah lies on Ira’s chest, purring. Ira often says he has never been loved as completely as she loves him, which I presume includes me. Oboe, her son, curls in my lap, purring just as loudly. Efi, the young Siamese, climbs the padded raggedy cat tree in the corner and waits. While I am making the bed, Ira will play with her. If he doesn’t, she wails her disappointment.\n\nRoutines, habits, rituals bind life together for most people, but no one can understand the pleasure or the comfort of them, looking on from outside. Such routines appear silly or time wasting. Yet like the cats, I am pleased by some appearance of the ordinary in a life that is overly hectic. I wake alone in motel rooms too often not to appreciate the accustomed round of the morning. We have created these habits, all of us together, so they are shaped to our contours.\n\nDinah’s son Oboe, born in my bed, is a natural mediator. He has fought when necessary, but he has never been injured in a catfight and mostly he prefers to make friends with other cats. His major mode of fighting, when forced to it, consists of blowing his fur out so that he looks twice his normal size and making horrendous huge terrifying noises. I doubt if he has ever bitten another cat, and he has certainly never been bitten. He is a lover, gentle with us and his own cats, ruling more by persuasion than force. He has a heart-shaped face, soulful and intense, his green eyes large and luminous.\n\nTwo years ago, he was given a death sentence by our veterinarian, and he may well die while I am engaged in this book. I had Ira dig a grave last fall, in case Oboe should die when the ground is frozen; I try to avoid walking near that area. He is stoical about his illness and deeply embarrassed when kidney disease keeps him from reaching his box in time. Nonetheless, he is where he wants to be, with the people and cats he loves, among whom he is the universal favorite. Whatever he does has prestige. Efi, the baby Siamese, throws her arms around him and goes to sleep hugging him. Sometimes she washes him so vigorously, he is wet afterward.\n\nIra and I have been together part-time since 1976, and full-time and monogamously since 1980. We share the garden, Leapfrog Press—our small publishing company—writing, the love of wine and food, the Cape, politics—but the core of our relationship has always been communication and sex, the exchange of words and the joining of our bodies. Since he was four months old, Oboe has wanted to be with us whenever we make love. I have tried to understand what it means to him, who was altered young. Is it the scents, the hormones released, the animality or sensuality of our naked torsos and limbs entangled? Whatever it is, he stays clear of the action until it is safe, purring loudly, sometimes leaping over us, back and forth. When we are at rest, he crawls between us, blissful. It feels at once somewhat perverse and very natural to have him there. If we shut the door and close him out, he sets up a heartrending wail, not conducive to intimacy. It’s much better to let him in.\n\nDinah hated nursing her kittens and had little milk, so I bottle-fed them. Oboe had two mothers, and his relationship with both of us is tender, passionate and erotic. Dinah gave birth to her lifelong companion, her lover, her best friend, her playmate. They curl up together, one ball of silver-gray fur with four sharp ears protruding. Of all the cats, Oboe is closest to me. When I meditate, he sits with me and makes no demands. He is wise in the ways of the house and does not freak as the younger cats do when the carry-on bag comes out. It is only when the big suitcase is taken from the closet that he goes into a sullen depression, head wrapped in his tail, a comma of grief, knowing this means a considerable absence. His name comes from his voice, which even as a kitten was loud, plaintive and carrying, a true wind instrument.\n\nMax and Malkah are much younger orange tabbies, litter mates acquired from a shelter when they were runty palm-sized kittens with three kinds of parasites, respiratory infections, more fleas than fur, and a hunger so vast they seemed all swollen stomach. Now they are magnificent.\n\nThe Korats, mother and son, did not go out freely until they were eight and nine respectively. They are such gentle friendly cats, I was afraid they would cozy up to an oil truck or a Doberman. Our four acres are in a cul-de-sac at the end of a road surrounded by marsh. The Korats prefer the brick patio by the screened gazebo. On hot days, they ask to go into the gazebo, where it is shady and bugless and there is a view of the slope and into the treetops. Often Ira or I take the laptop out to work there. The gazebo is a lovely thing, octagonal with a pointy shingled roof and an octagonal table within. We look into the cutting garden with its lilies, dahlias, blue lupine and coneflowers with their blown back petals around the bronze center, single old-fashioned hollyhocks and chrysanthemums—full of bloom from June through October. The far end I fill with sunflowers—maroon, golden, bronze, yellow. I recite Blake’s poem O sunflower, weary of time to them as I plant.\n\nOur gardens are not the neat suburban type but combine vegetables grown in the intensive French method—close together in rich organic soil we have created—with flowers, mostly perennials, rosebushes, peach, pear and sour cherry trees, red and black currants, goose-, blue-and raspberries, grapevines, flowering bushes and trees. It is thickly planted. A neighbor once called it The Jungle. I was picking daylilies this July when I disturbed the sleep of a possum. Ira once tripped over a pumpkin-sized snapping turtle snoozing near a leak in the irrigation system. Gardening gives me peace, working with my hands in the dirt. I planted these trees and bushes on an eroding sandy hillside: we made this lush place with our own hands, learning gardening from books and trial and error, creating a living art for ourselves.\n\nBelow the gazebo is the Ram Garden, planted with potatoes or pole beans, named for a bas-relief of a ram that hangs on the shed wall. Margaret Atwood told me years ago I should grow scarlet runner beans to attract hummingbirds. I love to see them darting like jeweled helicopters, and the hawkmoths that stand in the air with blurred wings drinking from the flowers.\n\nCome with me into the weathered gray cedar-shingled house. The front door leads into the dining room with windows on three sides, always bird activity at the feeders, a room stuck out into the garden. Right now in late September, you see eight ironstone platters of tomatoes: yellow, red, orange, pink, purple, striped. Fat ones big as babies’ heads, luscious pink breasts, oblong, some cat-faced, plum tomatoes, cherry tomatoes. Behind the tomatoes are mounds of big red Cinderella pumpkins, Rouge Vif d’Estampes you see in the fall in Paris for sale in florist shops as well as in markets, for their beauty. A basket of maroon cabbages. Buff butternut squash, striped squash, orange and green winter squashes crowd every available surface. Does anyone live here or is this an indoor farmers’ market? Tomatoes are our joy and currency. I give my agent one present a year: every August we express her a box of our tomatoes, which she claims are better than any she can buy in New York. We send out tomatoes to small-press pals, we barter them for lobster, clams, oysters and fish with a shellfish farmer and a lobsterman. We give tomatoes plus other vegetables to friends with a theater background who let us stay with them in Manhattan.\n\nI began to can after my mother died, three kinds of sauce (simple, Italian, and hot) and whole plum tomatoes. She canned constantly through the warm months into fall, putting up far more than I do. Ball jars of peaches gleamed like amber in the sunlight streaming through the kitchen window. Jars of pickled young green beans with one clove of garlic, elegant fingers. Sour cherries. Half pears. Elderberry jelly. We used to go to the farmers’ market for her to buy bushels of fruit, while I admired the live chickens and mounds of rutabagas and sugar beets. Canning is a way of embodying the best of my mother in myself, to hold on to her, for I lost her younger than most of my friends lose their parents—she gave birth to me around forty-four. She had no birth certificate, so her age was approximate. We were close until puberty, and then came a long rocky contentious period; then the last ten years of her life, we were close again. I still mourn her. In some ways, she was my muse. By teaching me close observation, developing my memory and playing word games with me, she made me a poet.\n\nIn the same way, when I light Shabbat candles and say the blessings, I am embodying my grandmother Hannah, who gave me my religious education and taught me storytelling by her rich example. Both those women live in me and my work, at the same time that I never cease to miss them in the flesh. Sometimes when I am preparing holiday food, I see myself as a version of the Pet Milk cans of my childhood, the can with the cow inside the can with the cow, ad infinitum. I am a woman with my mother inside, inside her my grandmother, her mother, reaching beyond memory, all of us making the same ritual gesture. It comforts me. I have lost so many people that I need ways to remember and cherish my dead.\n\nOr you might look at all those tomatoes and squash and simply say, I was the child of penury and now I revel in abundance, too many tomatoes, too many clothes in the closet, too much in the freezer, a calendar too full and a life too busy. Ira jokes that when he dies, his tombstone will read HE STILL HAD STUFF TO DO. We always do. I love silence but I fear emptiness.\n\nWe are a tight-knit family of two humans and five cats who live far out to sea on the land we have made fertile among our gardens and our woods. This is our chosen home. It has taken me a long time to arrive here and dig in. These are my wanderings in search of a place where I could write and be myself and have what I consider necessary and what is not perhaps necessary but makes life good enough to endure the hard times. A place and time to write is a necessity, and love is a luxury, but I have spent a great many years searching for both. I am a stray cat who has finally found a good home.\n\nSEPTEMBER AFTERNOON AT FOUR O’CLOCK\n\nFull in the hand, heavy\n\nwith ripeness, perfume spreading\n\nits fan: moments now resemble\n\nsweet russet pears glowing\n\non the bough, peaches warm\n\nfrom the afternoon sun, amber\n\nand juicy, flesh that can\n\nmake you drunk.\n\nThere is a turn in things\n\nthat makes the heart catch.\n\nWe are ripening, all the hard\n\ngreen grasping, the stony will\n\nswelling into sweetness, the acid\n\nand sugar in balance, the sun\n\nstored as energy that is pleasure\n\nand pleasure that is energy.\n\nWhatever happens, whatever,\n\nwe say, and hold hard and let\n\ngo and go on. In the perfect\n\nmoment the future coils,\n\na tree inside a pit. Take,\n\neat, we are each other’s\n\nperfection, the wine of our\n\nmouths is sweet and heavy.\n\nSoon enough comes the vinegar.\n\nThe fruit is ripe for the taking\n\nand we take. There is\n\nno other wisdom.\n\nTWO\n\nIN THE BEGINNING\n\nThe cats of my childhood came out of the alley. Alleys ran up the center of our blocks, as they often do in the Midwest, so that to a child, each house faced two ways. For me, the most important direction was the alley. I was an alley child, as my cats were alley cats.\n\nSome of my earliest memories are artificial, based on photos in the family album, myself eight months old on a blanket at the beach near Traverse City, Michigan, near the tip of the little finger of Michigan’s palm. I have rich and splendid memories of things that happened in 1912 and 1926, from seeing in my imagination scenes described with such color and emotion by my mother Bert, my grandmother Hannah and my aunt Ruth. Therefore as I begin to unpack this load of rags and riches, caveat emptor. I come from a long line of storytelling women. I have a vivid childhood memory of standing in the back alley with my brother Grant and looking up at tall buildings—in an alley lined with garages in a neighborhood where the tallest building was two stories. It is very early childhood and I am so small, all buildings are tall to me.\n\nI remember peeing in my bed and how good it felt while it was warm under me and how nasty it felt when it grew cold. I remember the sense that the sounds my parents made were powerful and made things happen and if I made sounds, things I wanted would happen, though crying sometimes worked. The words that were only shaped noise to me felt dense as objects. I remember the sense of my parents locked in war and myself caught in the middle, torn, tormented, guilty. They were always at war, and I was one of their battlegrounds. My father had desperately wanted a son, and although he occasionally tried to turn me into one, I was never satisfactory. He related more fully to my half brother, Grant, son of my mother’s previous marriage, but Grant was already a teenager and usually in trouble. In the culture of our neighborhood, that was acceptable for a male child, although my parents balked at his sexual involvements.\n\nThe hospital I was born in, at the corner of Grand River and Livernois, had failed and become a bank in the middle of a row of used-car dealers by the time I was old enough to look at it. All that stays with me from the first tiny apartment upstairs in a two-story wooden house divided into four furnished apartments: I am lying on my back and I hear pigeons cooing. I clap my hands and my mother leans over me with her flower face. All through my life if I stop and listen to pigeons, I enjoy a sense of well-being. It soothes me, which carries over to the sound of mourning doves I hear often in these woods, especially in the spring. I slept in my parents’ room, as I was to do until my brother left home. Grant was thirteen years older.\n\nWe lived at first in a Jewish neighborhood, familiar to me all through my childhood because when my grandmother came to live with us each summer, my mother and I would take the streetcar there to buy kosher meat, gefilte fish, rugolach, bagels and bialys, smoked fish and other treats—when there was enough money. When there wasn’t, Grandma had to live on canned fish or vegetable soups, for she was Orthodox. Shortly after my parents moved to Detroit from Cleveland, where they met, my father was laid off for two years. My parents doubled up with another couple, Lucy and Lon, up from Appalachia. What little we had, we shared.\n\nWhen I was three, my father was rehired and we moved into a house my parents bought, where we would live until I was fifteen. It was a tiny house with asbestos siding that had been foreclosed on by the bank. My parents would be paying it off for the next ten years. It was in a working-class neighborhood largely Irish, Polish Catholic, and African-American. My parents had a bad Depression and it was not over, although my father was back at work. My mother was a housewife. I will not say she did not work, because she worked incessantly. My mother had been taken out of school in the middle of the tenth grade and sent to work as a chambermaid. My father had finished high school and gone to a technical night school, which had given him some sort of credential as an engineer, although he did not have a college diploma. He worked for Westinghouse installing and repairing heavy machinery. He worked for them at least fifty years, never promoted until the end when he was the last person left in the Detroit office; then they gave him an honorary title: supervisor—of himself.\n\nLucy and Lon moved out as tenant farmers to a small holding near the River Rouge Ford Plant. Every Sunday we drove to see them. I could see and smell the red smoke across the marshes. My mother would bring cakes or home-canned goods to Lucy and Lon. In exchange, they would kill a chicken for us to take home. I remember Lucy swinging the chicken and then chopping the head off, and how much blood gushed out. Through much of my early childhood, until World War II brought prosperity to Detroit, that was the only meat we could afford. I remember plucking the chickens and scorching the stumps of the feathers. Perhaps that made it easier to pluck out the quill ends. Out of the mysterious opened belly of the chicken came eggs, some with shells and some without, down to the tiniest little yellow and red worlds. My mother made a wonderful soup with the unborn eggs. Then she usually made the chicken as a pot roast with vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, celery: a dish I still make, with many variations. My mother was not a good cook, but she had her successes—most of which I have learned by trial and error to duplicate.\n\nEven after my father went back to work, times were hard and there was little surplus. Sometimes it was difficult to make the house payments, and my mother would take me with her when she went to the bank to stave them off. My mother’s only tool in the battle with bureaucracy and men with power was flirtation. She was an accomplished and persuasive flirt, a tiny woman with an extravagant hourglass figure, intense dark brown eyes and short curly black hair. She had a way of walking, a way of moving, a way of sitting that drew men’s eyes to her. She moved like the dancer two of her sisters had been. Half the men we dealt with were convinced she was crazy about them, but she mostly felt contempt. They were marks. She had a job to do and she did it. She was obsessed with my father, not with any of these men about whom she had a rich vocabulary of Yiddish insults which she muttered to me after each encounter.\n\nI shared my parents’ bedroom until my brother was forced by my parents to marry his girlfriend Isabelle. Our parents came home unexpectedly and caught Grant and Isabelle having sex on the couch while they were baby-sitting me. The marriage did not last, but I inherited my brother’s room—not really a room but a hallway. This was the space my grandmother shared with me every summer. Isabelle, Grant’s first wife, was a redhead with creamy skin. I remember he played the guitar then. I adored him. He was warm and emotional where my father was cold and withdrawn and judgmental. I adored my father too when I was little, but I think by the time I was seven, I had learned I could not please him. My brother would get bored if I asked too much of him, but while he was paying attention, he was affectionate and funny and endearing. He looked like me. Everyone we touched looked like us, nieces, nephews, cousins. We all have dark hair and dark dark brown Oriental eyes, a stocky build.\n\nIt’s hard to excavate my childhood. On one hand, I have vivid sensual and emotional memories. I know I was fearful of death. Perhaps it was my favorite aunt on my father’s side dying young from complications after an auto accident on an icy mountain road near Monday’s Corners—my uncle Zimmy, a coal miner, driving and presumably drunk, after a dance. Perhaps it was the death of the first cat I remember, Whiskers. For whatever reason, I was terrified that my mother would suddenly die, or that my grandmother, when she slept with me, would stop breathing. Perhaps it was my mother’s melodramatic streak, for she would assume a pose and say, You’ll be sorry you did that when I’m dead! When I’m dead and gone, you’ll remember how wicked you were to me! When you’ve put me in my grave, you’ll understand what it is to be a motherless child, alone in the mean world without anybody to take care of you!\n\nMy room was painted robin’s egg blue—a name that impressed me because I did know what color the eggs of the neighborhood robins were, as sometimes cowbirds would push them from the nests and I would find them broken on the ground.\n\nUntil age nine or ten, I found this tiny house and yard rich and wonderful. I was fascinated by the mirror that hung near the front door, which I have to this day, one of the few relics of my childhood. It has an owl’s head on top, the ornate frame made of once-gilded plaster. On a shelf stood a strange teapot from my great-grandmother back in Lithuania, the pattern long faded into the grayish curve of the sides. When my father broke it in a temper tantrum years later, I was furious, for I had always presumed it would be mine someday. I found the space under the front porch mysterious, sandy and hung with spiderwebs. I loved the front porch, screened in by my father, with its creaky glider I could lie on and stare up at the boards of the dark green ceiling. That was one piece of furniture my cat was allowed on, so we curled up there together.\n\nWe always had a car. My father’s manhood meshed strongly with automobiles, and even if we were eating only oatmeal or beans and potatoes, the car always had gas. After the war, he bought a new car every two years. There was no money to go to the dentist when mother or I had a toothache. I went to school in hand-me-downs, sometimes with Aunt Ruth’s initials shaming me on my blouses; but a new car was as important to him as the fact that we owned our tiny ramshackle house. To him it meant that we were middle class. We weren’t, but never mind. There was a lawn out front the size of a nine-by-twelve rug, but it had grass growing on it, and that too was a badge of his station in life. These things were very important to my parents. To my father being able to regard himself as middle class was necessary because he had been raised with those pretensions—for his family had to differentiate themselves from the coal miners around them—and to my mother, it was important because she had not been so raised. Her childhood and adolescence had been spent in vicious poverty, too many children and too little of everything else.\n\nI remember once sitting in Austin, Texas, with the fine poet, my friend Audre Lorde (who wrote a remarkable memoir, Zami). We were in a Holiday Inn that had at the top one of those restaurants that revolved—a fad of"
