'Not all of the books deal with the movement, but they all deal with women,' said Fabi Romero‐Oak the other day. With two other ardent feminists, Karyn London and Eleanor Batchelder, she opened Womanbooks four months ago and they've been amazed at how many customers they've had ...\" (from \"A Bookshop for Feminists,\" published July 15, 1975, in the @nytimes)\n\nMore from www.nyclgbtsites.org: Open from 1975 to 1987, Womanbooks was the second feminist bookstore in New York City. It sold books written, published, and printed by women, many of which could not be found in mainstream bookstores, including many titles on lesbianism and female sexuality. The bookstore, located at 201 West 92nd Street, doubled as a women’s center where women could gather regardless of sexuality, race, or political affiliation.\n\nPhotos: 1️⃣ New York Times article by Virginia Lee Warren; 2️⃣ Exterior of 201 West 92nd Street, c. 2019.
