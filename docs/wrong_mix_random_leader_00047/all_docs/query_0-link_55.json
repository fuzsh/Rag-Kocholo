        "text": "Amanda Flower: Art of Poetry Leads to Mystery\n\nI’m a good writer, but a terrible poet. It’s true, I have taken countless writing courses over my schooling and even as an adult, and I always dreaded the poetry units. Even though I can write a beautiful line now and again, poetry is not my gift as a writer. That doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate it. In fact, the art of poetry has inspired several of my novels, and I know that it will have a huge impact on my career in the future. But it won’t be the poetry I write.\n\nMy appreciation of poetry all started with Emily Dickinson. I fell in love with Dickinson when I was a teenager sitting in my American Literature class. I guess as a day-dreamy fifteen-year-old, I was fascinated with her writing about nature, life, and death. She struck the right notes with me at the time and has stuck with me as my preferences for literature have changed over the years.\n\nTwenty years later, my first novel featuring Dickinson released. Crime and Poetry was the first book in the Magical Bookshop Mysteries. In the novel, the protagonist solves a murder that takes place in a small village near Niagara Falls, New York with the poems of Dickinson. It was my chance to share everything I knew of Dickinson after years of study but allowed me to remain within the safety of my wheelhouse as a writer, which is writing contemporary cozy mysteries. The cozy subgenre is my first love as a writer, and I will always write them, but after writing Crime and Poetry and the subsequent books in the series that used the works of other famous nineteenth century writers, such as Alcott, Poe, Whitman, and Thoreau, I had the itch to write something deeper about Dickinson. This desire eventually led to Because I Could Not Stop for Death, my first historical mystery that features Dickinson as the sleuth.\n\nGoing into the book, I knew a lot of Dickinson, but what I discovered was there was so much to learn. The biggest surprise for me was discovering that Dickinson traveled to Washington DC in 1855 to visit her father who was finishing his term in the House of Representatives. The fact was so contrary to the typical image of Dickinson, which was a woman in white bent over a desk writing day and night. I knew this historical event had to be a cornerstone of the plot.\n\nI was a librarian for fifteen years, and being a librarian in this case was an advantage and a disadvantage. As an advantage, I knew how to research efficiently and effectively. I also knew that if I wasn’t able to find something I needed, another librarian somewhere most likely could. As a disadvantage, I knew that I would never been able to know and digest everything known about Emily Dickinson, and I would have to force myself to stop researching at a point and actually write the book. That does not come natural to a librarian. Every librarian will tell you that she had researched a reference question more than once long after the patron was gone.\n\nHowever, I finally stopped the research and wrote the novel, and I’m thrilled with the final result. It was my hardest book to write and the one I’m most proud of. Because I Could Not Stop for Death releases on September 20th, and I think on that day my appreciation for poetry will come full circle. Even though I already knew at the age of fifteen that I wanted to be a mystery novelist, there was no way that girl sitting in the classroom could have imagined what an impact Emily Dickinson would have on her life.\n\n***\n\nAmanda Flower is a USA Today bestselling and Agatha Award-winning author of over forty mystery novels.

Abramo: True Crime: Naviating Research Roadblocks\n\nOn January 30, 2003, an article in a daily newspaper caught my eye. The piece reported the arrest of a 69-year-old man at his home just miles from where I lived at the time in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\nTen years earlier, in a box of used books purchased at a yard sale, I came across a book by a prison inmate—written while he awaited execution.\n\nThose two discoveries stimulated my interest and imagination, and subsequent investigations have led me here.\n\nHomeland Insecurity, on one hand, is the story of two men accused of taking the lives of three fellow human beings.\n\nA fifteen-year-old schoolgirl in Mahwah, New Jersey.\n\nAnd two young police officers in El Segundo, California.\n\nTwo killers born 8 days apart in 1934.\n\nTwo men who died 57 days apart in 2017.\n\nCrimes committed 140 days apart in 1957.\n\nAt a time when Americans were beginning to feel less and less confident about the safety of their families.\n\nOne convicted murderer spent nearly fifteen years on death row at New Jersey State Prison in Trenton—where he continually professed his innocence.\n\nThe other perpetrator escaped identification for more than 45 years.\n\nAt the same time, Homeland Insecurity is an account of the hits and misses of the law enforcement agencies and legal institutions which—over the course of nearly five decades—eventually stumbled upon justice.\n\nFinally, it is a look at the post-World War II American experience leading up to the murders in 1957, and the profound changes to come after.\n\nWhen Rock & Roll, rebels without a cause, and catchers in the rye burst upon the American scene.\n\nWhen the fear of nuclear annihilation and real-life scary monsters crept into the national consciousness.\n\nAnd when those three murders in 1957, and a growing sense of national insecurity, may have had mutual effect.\n\nIn researching the murder of Victoria Zielinski in March of 1957, I ran into a number of roadblocks. My interest was originally stimulated by the 1968 book, Brief Against Death, written by eleventh-year death row inmate, Edgar Smith. The book described the crime, his arrest, arraignment, indictment, trial and conviction—posed questions about the jury’s guilty verdict—and gained Smith a powerful advocate, William F. Buckley Jr.\n\nResearch on the crime and its immediate aftermath relied heavily on Smith’s accounts (taken with a grain of salt and held up to scrutiny by other sources)— media and police reports from the time of the murder—and on trial transcripts.\n\nIt wasn’t until after Smith’s discharge from prison after nearly fifteen years that he wrote a follow-up book, Getting Out, describing subsequent events—and the many appeals to state and federal courts, and to the Supreme Court, which ultimately led to his freedom in 1972. It took me quite some time to locate a copy of Getting Out, and much longer to learn of Smith’s fate after his release.\n\nI navigated around that roadblock by writing to William F. Buckley in 1995. Buckley graciously responded to my inquiry with a somewhat shocking update on Edgar Smith—he was back in prison, this time in California.\n\nIt was another five years before, with the help of an attorney acquaintance in California, I discovered the whereabouts of Edgar Smith. I wrote him a letter in 2000. He kindly replied—but apologized for not agreeing to meet me for an interview.\n\nAfter numerous denied parole appeals, Edgar Smith passed away in 1917 at the age of 83—after spending all but four of his final 60 years behind prison walls.\n\n***\n\nJ.L. Abramo is the Shamus Award-winning author of ten novels and numerous short stories. Homeland Insecurity is his first full-length work of nonfiction.
