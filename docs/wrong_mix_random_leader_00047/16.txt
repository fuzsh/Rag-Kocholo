​When I think about my work,

a wonderful poem by Marge Piercy always comes to mind:

To be of use

​The people I love the best

jump into work head first

without dallying in the shallows

and swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.

They seem to become natives of that element,

the black sleek heads of seals

bouncing like half-submerged balls.

I love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,

who pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,

who strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,

who do what has to be done, again and again.

I want to be with people who submerge

in the task, who go into the fields to harvest

and work in a row and pass the bags along,

who are not parlor generals and field deserters

but move in a common rhythm

when the food must come in or the fire be put out.

The work of the world is common as mud.

Botched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.

But the thing worth doing well done

has a shape that satisfies, clean and evident,

Greek amphoras for wine or oil,

Hopi vases that held corn, are put in museums

but you know they were made to be used.

The pitcher cries for water to carry

and a person for work that is real.

"To be of use"

​For me, this is work that is real.

​And the shape of it deeply satisfies me.

The process of my own healing has led me here,

and ​I’m honored to accompany people

as we work together through the painful passages,

and the dark spots.

​

As someone I love once told me,

pain is never the end of the story.

You don't have to do it alone.

I’ll hold the light for you if you’d like to work with me.
