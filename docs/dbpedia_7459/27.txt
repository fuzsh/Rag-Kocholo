The 12th Israel Film Festival opens Nov. 14 in Los Angeles with the area premiere of “Under the Domim Tree,” based on the autobiography of Israeli film star Gila Almagor.

Almagor, who co-produced the film, will attend the gala kickoff event at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The festival’s L.A. segment, which continues through Nov. 30 at the Laemmle’s Monica 4- Plex, features more than 30 films including 10 features, 10 documentaries and a student short film marathon. The festival’s 15-day New York run began Oct. 19.

“Under the Domim Tree,” directed by Eli Cohen, tells the story of a group of teenage Holocaust survivors at an Israeli boarding school in the early ‘ 50s. The film was a co-winner of the 1995 Jerusalem Film Festival.

Other L.A. bows include Shemi Zarhin’s “Passover Fever,” winner of the best screenplay award at the Montreal Film Festival; Shmuel Hasfari’s “Sh’hur,” winner of six Israeli Academy Awards, including best film; Eytan Fox’s “Song of the Siren”; and Amnon Rubinstein’s “On the Edge.”

According to executive director Meir Fenigstein, this year’s entries were of higher caliber and covered more diverse subject matters than those in years past.

“The themes in the films… are more universal, and are based on more real-life issues as opposed to the politically minded films we’ve always had in the past,” said Fenigstein.

This year, for the first time, the festival will present audience awards in each category.

Co-chairs for the festival include David Geffen, Arthur Hiller, Sherry Lansing, Ron Meyer, Sumner Redstone, Haim Saban, Terry Semel, Ted Turner and Jack Valenti. Arnon Milchan returns as honorary chair for the fifth year.

Corporate sponsors include Amblin Entertainment, DreamWorks and Viacom.
