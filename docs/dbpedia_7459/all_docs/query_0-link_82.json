        "text": "After today's intermission for the Sabbath, the inaugural Florida Gulf Coast Jewish Film festival resumes Saturday evening and Sunday afternoon with 20 films at two Tampa Bay locations.\n\nTampa Theatre is the primary venue, but this ambitious cultural addition also includes events Sunday at Golda Meir/Kent Jewish Center in Clearwater.\n\nThe festival continues Saturday at 8 p.m. with the short subject A World to Come, followed by Autumn Sun, a bittersweet Argentine romance offering a rare glimpse of Jewish life in Latin America. Norma Aleandro, an 1987 Oscar nominee for Gaby: A True Story, plays middle-aged Clara, whose brother expects her to date someone Jewish.\n\nClara places a personal ad to attract a temporary escort as a ruse, and charming Raul (Federico Luppi) answers. Autumn Sun goes exactly where a viewer expects _ Clara and Raul fall in love for real _ but two qualities are notable: Eduardo Mignogna's glowing respect for elders, and a late development making the inevitable melancholy. A-\n\nAt 10:15 p.m., a 96-minute collection of five short films, whimsical and historical, will be shown. Two Weddings is a touching documentary of a young bride hearing the story of her grandparents' separation during World War II. B\n\nA small boy sends a spiritual e-mail to godheaven. Finally, there is the Academy Award-winning documentary The Personals: Improvisations on Romance in the Golden Years. Both films: B\n\nTwo other shorts were unpreviewed: Offerings for Wallenburg is a unpreviewed tribute to the rescuer of 100,000 Jews during the Holocaust. On the lighter side, L.A. Mohel profiles three people carrying on the circumcision tradition in modern America. One calls himself \"Mohel to the Stars\" because of his celebrity clients.\n\nSunday's events begin at 1:30 p.m. with short films suitable for children. A special ticket price of $3 will be charged. godheaven gets an encore showing, plus the Claymation fable Natie the Pirate, and a segment from the PBS series Reading Rainbow illustrating the story of Mrs. Katz and Tush. Overall grade: B-\n\nMeanwhile, the Freylich Fair, a collection of Jewish crafts and cuisine, will be open for browsing between noon and 6 p.m. on Franklin Street Mall.\n\nFilms continue at 4 p.m. with The Fifth Commandment: Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother. This 45-minute documentary explores a family rift caused by generational differences in religious practice. Extra tension _ and some tedium _ is provided by the fact that the director, Shimon Azulay, is exposing his own family's turmoil. B-\n\nAzulay's film is accompanied by the unpreviewed Split, a filmmaker's journey to discover his roots.\n\nAt 6:15 p.m., the festival presents the Oscar-winning short film Visas and Virtue, essaying a Japanese diplomat's signing of escape papers for thousands of Jews in World War II. A-\n\nNovember 29, 1997 documents the 50th anniversary of Israel's establishment by the United Nations. Primetime War traces the movements of BBC and Associated Press cameramen covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both films were unpreviewed.\n\nTampa Theatre concludes its festival events at 8:30 p.m. with Silence, a sobering animated short in which a Holocaust survivor speaks for the first time about her experiences. B+\n\nThe closing-night feature is The Summer of Aviya, a sequel to Eli Cohen's 1994 coming-of-age film Under the Domim Tree.\n\nThis sluggish post-war drama continues the story of Aviya (Kaipo Cohen) in the first years of Israel's independence. Aviya is a 10-year-old girl dealing with her emotionally unstable mother (Gila Almagor), still traumatized by concentration camp experiences. Almagor wrote the largely autobiographical screenplay, adding a brittle, bitter performance. B-\n\nAlso on Sunday, the festival spreads to Golda Meir/Kent Jewish Center, 1955 Virginia Street in Clearwater. Call (727) 736-1494 for information. Two programs will be offered there:\n\nAt 1:30 p.m., the documentary Yidl in the Middle: Growing Up Jewish in Iowa reveals an amusing Midwest identity crisis. Filmmaker Marlene Booth retraces her uncertain childhood through a class reunion. Short subjects Almonds and Wine and Gefilte Fish precede the film. Overall grade: B\n\nVisas and Virtue will be shown in Clearwater at 4 p.m., followed by Photographer, an examination of photos from the Poland's terrorized Lodz Ghetto. These harrowing pictures are accompanied by a Nazi accountant's brutally clinical documentation of lives being destroyed. B+"
