Kimuna\n\nClass times: Tuesday & Thursday, 11:00– 12:15 pm\n\nFilm Screenings: In class\n\nThe class will examine the importance of mass media in shaping and creating cultural perceptions. The goal of the course is to provide students with the knowledge and skills to critically analyze mass media, especially, how it is organized and presented for public consumption. One of our first tasks will be to explore the way media texts are produced. We will then examine media content paying particular attention to the construction of meaning. We will go beyond overly-simplified discussions of stereotypes to address cultural products as open texts subject to a variety of interpretations, some of which may subvert intended readings. We will also investigate patterns and processes of media consumption (including questions of media effects, the ways in which consumption choices may serve to create or erode boundaries between groups of people, and how knowledge of elite cultural forms act as currency that may advantage or disadvantage consumers). Some of the films that will be screened in class for critical analyses include:\n\nFilms: Happy Feet (2006, George Miller); Maid in Manhattan (2002, Wayne Wang); She Hate Me (2004, Spike Lee); The Devil Wears Prada (2006, David Frankel); The Informant (2009, Steven Soderbergh); Dirty Pretty Things (2002, Stephen Frears); It’s Kind of a Funny Story (2010, Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck); American Violet (2008, Tim Disney), and Doubt (2009, John Patrick Shanley); Boys Don’t Cry (1999, Kimberly Peirce); Brokeback Mountain (2005, Ang Lee); Crash (2004, Paul Haggis); Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner (1967, Stanley Kramer).\n\n****SOCI3025 counts towards the Multicultural/Transnational/International Film Cognate for Fall 2016 semester****\n\nENGL 3810: Advanced Composition (WI) (DE)\n\nInstructor: Joyce I Middleton\n\nTimes offered: DE\n\nScreening: on your own\n\nThis DE section of advanced composition focuses on writing about film as a rhetorical text and as a visual rhetoric.

Students will practice writing in a variety of genres that will help them to develop skills for analyzing film, writing, peer editing, analyzing images, and writing about visual rhetoric in film.

How much have our stars, our stories, and our storytelling devices changed from the invention of cinema?

The course will explore different facets of a particular American identity from the perspective of mainstream films (Pretty Woman) as well as independent (Tangerine) and experimental entries (Spring Breakers). In addition to looking at isolated identities and what it means to be an African American, white, working class, or a disabled woman in America, this course will also focus on intersectionality, or the ways that multiple systems of oppression are felt on individual bodies and how they intersect. This FILM course is also cross-listed with WOST.\n\nScreenings: Miss Representation (2011, Jennifer Siebel Newsom and Kimberlee Acquaro), Spring Breakers (2012, Harmony Korine), Boys Don’t Cry (1999, Kimberly Pierce),Little Darlings (1980, Ronald F.
