        "text": "Sh'chur represents a journey of reconciliation with tradition. After her father's death, Rachel, a television broadcaster, journeys to her past in an immigrant town on the edge of the desert. She is in distress, anxious and on the verge of a breakdown. Her Husband is far away - their relationship appears strained - and she must deal with a retarded daughter.\n\nThe audience will experience Rachel's tribulations as she comes to terms with the painful memories of her immigrant family. She must reconcile her deeply rooted culture, which was established on the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, with the grave difficulties her family encountered with assimilation in Israel.\n\nAnna (8), a strangely quiet girl, arrives in Israel from war-ravaged Europe with her brother Jan, her soiled Teddy bear and a tattered photo of her lost mother. Anna refused many of the refugee's offers of adoption, choosing instead to wait, observing the joys and sorrows of others. Jan moves to a kibbutz where Anna is not accepted. Distressed by Jan's desertion, she falls gravely ill. Upon meeting her brother again, she accuses him of being just like their uncle, who betrayed the family to the Nazis.\n\nNew Land is a bittersweet fantasy of finding a new home to call one's own."
