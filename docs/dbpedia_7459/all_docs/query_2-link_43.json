        "text": "Revisiting Grathoff's theory of symbolic type (ST), we examine the personal evolution and commemorative work of Tsipi Kichler, a cultural entrepreneur and founder of an alternative Israeli Holocaust museum/geriatric center. As hybrid product of Israeli social cleavages, Kichler exteriorizes her paradoxical vision in the museum aiming to reform Holocaust-related discourse and practice. Early biographical positioning and resultant contradictions become translated into resistant commemorative performance where serious humor deconstructs the binaries of life/death and past/present. We consider the implications of the ST's self-referential closure to interaction, and the transformative potential of the alignment of cultural entrepreneurs' personal memory with collective memory.\n\nHow can we bridge the emotional and cognitive study of Holocaust testimonies in Israel? Can empathy be used as a stepping stone to critical reflection? And how can teachers address the manipulative popular interpretation of these testimonies in Israel, which seemingly place them beyond critical reflection? We examine these questions through an undergraduate course at an Israeli college of education, using the methodology of collaborative self-study. The fostering of empathy was a key component of the course, with students encouraged to share their feelings, personal experiences, and impressions. At the same time, various pedagogical methods were used to elicit critical reflection, allowing us to explore preconceived notions held by the students concerning the preservation and expression of Holocaust memory. The students' close identification with Holocaust victims became in and of itself an effective tool for critical examination. The central foci of the study were the assumptions of Israeli Jewish students with regard to Holocaust memory, and the changes achieved in the course through critical reflection. We conclude with a discussion of future approaches to the teaching of Holocaust studies in Israel and elsewhere, in light of the experiences gained from this course.\n\n\"The Holocaust is not what it used to be.\" (quote from a worker at Yad Vashem). Four modes of collective memory about the Holocaust have competed with one another within the space of Israeli political culture. The ascendance of \"The Holocaust as a Template for Jewish Life\" has powerfully shaped how Israelis see themselves and the possibilities of relations with non-Jews, having a particularly drastic effect on the conflict with the Palestinians. Of the other three constructions--the Holocaust as \"Zionist Prooftext,\" as \"Wasting Asset,\" and as \"Moral Object Lesson\"--have not disappeared. The latter may be poised to make a comeback as a result the difficulty Israeli Jews have not seeing anything in Holocaust terms, including their own treatment of Palestinians."
