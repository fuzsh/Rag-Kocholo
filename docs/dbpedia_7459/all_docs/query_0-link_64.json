        "text": "Hanna Azulai’s film tells the story of a 13-year-old who struggles with the demons that fill the life of her Moroccan family in Israel of the 1970s.\n\nA young man babysits for the young son of his former girlfriend for a period of three days, during which time he finds himself struggling with his ambivalent feelings towards the child.\n\nOn the day he is released from prison, Yisarael appears on the doorstep of the woman whose life he had changed. A weird relationship develops between the two.\n\n14-year-old Nadav tells about his dysfunctional family – his parents’ divorce, his dying father, his wild mother, his love for his aunt, Nina\n\nA mixture of pathos and comedy about Beny Forman, married and father of two, who has an insatiable appetite for women.... One of the cornerstones of Israeli cinema that should not be missed.\n\nTwo lone soldiers in Israel arrive filled with motivation and the desire to excel. But they are caught within the pitfalls of those who have no connections or influence. Based on the events that took place in an Israeli military prison in 1997.\n\nOne summer in the life of the nine-year-old daughter of a Holocaust survivor during the early years of the state of Israel. A tender portrayal based on the true story of Gila Almagor who plays the role of her own mother.\n\nAn aging actress in a Yiddish theater has finally reached success. Her story serves as a pretext for a review of the Yiddish theater, which, like the actress, had a brilliant past but is now slowly dying.\n\nThe powerful stories of several youths that live in a village for Holocaust orphans and other Israeli kids with issues.\n\nThe Israeli government’s appropriation of Arab lands shatters the fragile co-existence between Jews and Arabs in a Galilee village. Daniel Wachsmann second feature is as relevant as ever.\n\nA Hole in the Moon is a wild, zany parody of Israel in the early 1960s. Zohar, a new immigrant, opens a kiosk in the middle of nowhere. The lack of clients doesn’t deter Heffner from opening a competing business across the road."
