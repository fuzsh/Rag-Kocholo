        "text": "This is the second collection I’ve been commissioned to edit for the Jerusalem Cinematheque’s Israeli Film Archive. And though not my first time at the rodeo, sure enough the magic of trawling and rummaging through old, ultrarare archival sport footage came alive again – just as it did the first time. In this collection, I set out to focus more on the trends and changes that Israeli sport and essentially, Israeli society as a whole, have been through from the country’s nascent years to this day. This was a relatively easy undertaking as all you really had to do was watch the sports broadcasts, seeing as how the competitions’ ceremonies, rules, and rituals have all pretty much remained identical. It’s only the execution that has changed.\n\nFor instance, during the 1959 National Football Cup award ceremony, Israel’s then-president, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi politely handed Maccabee Tel Aviv FC captain, Yehoshua (Shia) Glazer the cup and immediately stepped aside; a stark contrast to the ‘choreography’ of football cup award ceremonies of recent years in which we have grown so accustomed to seeing politicians (of all sides of the political spectrum, mind you) and a whole entourage of publicity-hungry, focus-stealing wheelers and dealers getting all mixed up and thinking that all eyes should be on them, as opposed to the decorated sportsmen.\n\nA lot has also changed on the audience front. In matches whose footage has survived in the archives, you can spot fans sat down or (usually – due to the old stadiums’ subpar infrastructure) standing up, cheering their teams on with a smile of their faces – the image of sportsmanship and respectfulness – and very much unlike today’s ultras whose fandom repertoire, unfortunately for us, has also come to include throwing firecrackers and a host of a other objects onto the pitch, and when the result was not to their liking also making a barrage of threats at coaches, players, and managers.\n\nAnd maybe this is where the secret of the magic and idyllic spirit of these old, short clips truly lies – as fragmentary documented footage which never really paints the full picture. Perhaps it’s the black and white aspect, of all things, that makes us look at those athletes and fans of yore and in fact, the whole period, through rose-tinted glasses completely divorced from reality? Either way, it is undoubtedly worth diving into the footage and savouring it all, because when all is said and done, these are irreplaceable slices of history – for sport fans, and as a whole. And as my dearest and much-loved friend, the late Modi Bar-On, whose love of sport was only paralleled by his passion for documentaries and history used to say, “have a good one.”"
