        "text": "Spain’s ruling People’s Party (PP) got shellacked in Sunday’s regional elections, highlighting the challenge for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in the national parliamentary vote in November.\n\nThe center-left Ciudadanos and far left Podemos, newly created parties that only started to contest elections last year, made strong gains at the expense of the ruling PP as well as the main opposition Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE) in votes for regional parliaments, municipal councils and mayors.\n\nWith almost all the votes counted, the PP received 27 percent of the vote, down 10 percentage points from the last regional elections in 2011. The incumbent party got more votes than anyone else, but failed to win overall majorities in most areas. Of the 13 regions that held elections Sunday, the PP lost in seven it and might be able to save its rulership in three of them only if it forms a coalition with Ciudadanos, as the newspaper El País reports.\n\nThe vote has shaken up Spain’s traditional two-party system that saw power alternate between PP and PSOE since democracy was re-established in Spain after the death of military strongman Francisco Franco in 1975. The rising popularity of Podemos has also fed concerns in Brussels and Berlin that Spain might follow Greece toward the hard left.\n\nThe setback for the People’s Party reflects fatigue with years of economic austerity pushed by Rajoy, even as the Spanish economy has rebounded. A series of corruption scandals involving leading figures in the center-right PP also took an electoral toll.\n\n“I believe in this night our regional governments and town halls will start to change, and Spain will change as well,” said Pablo Iglesias, leader of Podemos. He has close ties with the ruling radical-left Greek Syriza party and attended Alexis Tsipras’s election victory rally in Athens this January.\n\n“This is a decisive success,” said José Manuel Villegas, vice secretary of Ciudadanos.\n\nIn Madrid, the PP took a slight lead with 34 percent of the vote, while the party Alliance ‘Ahora Madrid’, backed by Podemos, came in second with 32 percent. But the Conservatives might still lose the symbolically important capital, as Podemos could form an alliance with the Socialist Workers’ Party, which landed third with 15 percent.\n\nIn Barcelona, the alliance ‘Barcelona en Comú’, which unites Podemos and other left-wing parties, won the municipal elections. The Popular Party came in a distant sixth in Barcelona – behind Ciudadanos – but the separatist movement Convèrgencia i Unió (CiU) suffered the biggest losses in the Catalonian capital, dealing a blow to the independence movement.\n\nCiudadanos is the ‘kingmaker’\n\nThe elections were a breakthrough for Ciudadanos, which took part in nationwide poll for the first time and came in fourth in many regions and municipalities. The popularity of the party, founded in 2006 in the autonomous region of Catalonia, has soared in recent months, cutting into support for Podemos.\n\nIn many parts of the country the party will now play kingmaker in regional parliaments and city councils. Both the PP and the Socialists have signalled their openness to working with the socially liberal Ciudadonoes, which is seen as less radical than Podemos.\n\nA lot of the party’s success is attributed to its charismatic leader Albert Rivera Díaz, a 35-year-old lawyer from Barcelona. He’s Spain’s second most popular person, after King Felipe VI and ahead of Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias or Rajoy, according to a survey published by the newspaper El País.\n\n“Many people want to punish these parties with their vote.”\n\n“We suffer also from a constitutional crisis, provoked by the two established parties,” Juan Carlos Girauta Vidal, who was elected to the European Parliament in 2014 for Ciudadanos, said in interview before the election Sunday. “Many people want to punish these parties with their vote.”\n\nThe arrival of Ciudadanos, which only started to expand to the national scene by the end of last year, voters got another alternative to the legacy parties as well as Podemos. The new liberal-social party seems largely responsible for the fact that Podemos, despite it’s success, did not do perform so well in the elections as polls still suggested a few months ago.\n\nIn response to Podemos’ demand for a “change” in Spain, Ciudadanos distinguishes itself by calling for a “reasonable change.”\n\n“The rise of Ciudadanos is proportional to the decline of Podemos,” Rivera said to Spanish media ahead of the election. Girauta Vida said: “The people welcome us as an alternative that is less radical. We don’t want to demolish our constitution, we want to reform it.”\n\nFear of a deadlock\n\nRecognizing Ciudadanos as a threat, Podemos has turned its attacks on them, accusing the party of being “only a facade.”\n\n“We know already how the old politics works … with parties that disguise themselves as being new, but if we scratch on the surface we see the tics and the acting of the old parties,” said Alberto Egido, a candidate for Podemos, during a pre-election party.\n\nWith both newcomer parties in strong opposition to each other, as well as against the two old parties, the risk of political deadlock in Spain is growing.\n\nConsider the region of Andalusia, which held its local elections on March 22. All four parties entered the regional parliament but two months later, haven’t managed to form a coalition government.\n\n“We are currently in a moment of change like Spain experienced it in the ‘Transition’,” Rivera said in a statement, referring to the turbulent period in 1975-1982 when Spain moved from dictatorship to democracy."
