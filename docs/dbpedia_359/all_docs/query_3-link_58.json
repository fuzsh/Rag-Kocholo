        "meta_description": "Abstract The people of Ceuta see their town as an exemplary model of coexistence between Christians, Muslims, Jews, and Hindus. This “convivencia” is described as the brainchild of their mayor-president, who funds clients to enact his charismatic vision. Anthropology is sensitive to the moral ambiguities of patron–client relations but has overlooked the role of charisma in the reproduction of patronage. This article explores the theoretical and political implications of a process by which convivencia-patronage becomes seen as the extension of the patron's charisma. Obscuring the historical dimensions of power, charisma blocks nuanced discussion toward the colonial legacy of convivencia as a way of controlling suspect minorities. It prevents change by channeling resistance toward the removal of the mayor-president, not the structures that enabled his rise.",

        "text": "I first visited the North African Spanish enclave of Ceuta in 2011. Ignoring its 86,000 inhabitants, I made straight for its infamous border, interested as I was in the knowledge, goods, and persons (un)made at the gates of Fortress Europe. This changed some weeks into my fieldwork when, heading to an interview, I came upon a curious sight.\n\nIt was a gorgeous March evening—just before Easter—and the sleepy border neighborhood of El Príncipe was crowded with people. But not any people. Dressed in expensive suits and elaborate dresses, rosary beads in hand, these were Christians, and Christians never went to El Príncipe, fearing it a lawless Muslim ghetto. I asked an elderly man what was happening. “The Ritual of the Relocation (el traslado),” he replied. Seeing I was new to the enclave, he proceeded to explain that, once, many Christians lived in El Príncipe. They are long gone, but they left behind the miraculous statue of the Christ of Medinaceli. His shrine is maintained by Muslims, “because in Ceuta we have convivencia,” but once a year, the faithful relocate the statue to the town center in preparation for Holy Week processions.\n\nSuddenly, the statue of the Medinaceli burst from a narrow alley, carried on the shoulders of 30 men. The Christ cast his benevolent gaze on his devotees, his hands bound by rope, his face covered in blood, his majestic purple robe swaying in the wind. The Muslims of El Príncipe watched from their balconies, the children waving and the adults sullen. Tears in his eyes, my interlocutor forgot about me and followed the procession as it thundered toward Ceuta's largest mosque. Clad in immaculate white robes, the Imam emerged from the mosque's marbled gate and embraced the leader of the procession, a short man with an easy smile who I quickly recognized as Juan Vivas, the enclave's mayor-president. As cameras flashed around them, the Imam remarked how “in a world dying from religious hatred, Ceuta's convivencia is a beacon of hope!”\n\nVivas replied that “it is moments like this that make Ceuta! Ceuta is greater than the sum of its parts!”\n\nApplauding, the crowd jostled to shake Vivas’ hand and take photographs of the Medinaceli statue facing the mosque. The Medinaceli's carriers then performed a levantà. Crouching under the heavy statue, they abruptly rose as one and cast the Medinaceli up into the air, catching it on their shoulders as it fell down. The levantà is the pinnacle of the art of Spanish Holy Week processions, and the maneuver is often dedicated to those dear to the carriers. The Muslims applauded, recognizing that the levantà had been done in their honor, and the procession left for the city center.\n\nMy interviewee was waiting, so I dared not pursue. Later, I learned that, as per custom, the procession visited Ceuta's prison. There, an in-mate (chosen by the director for his exemplary behavior) had his sentence pardoned. His face hidden under a purple hood, he solemnly emerged from the complex's heavy gates and took his place among the Medinaceli's carriers. My informants urged me not to ask about the identity of the man thus liberated by the Medinaceli. Nonetheless, I was told that “he's probably Muslim.1 Not that it matters, because we know that the Medinaceli is father to all Ceutans.”\n\nFollowing the traslado, I became fascinated with the relationship between Ceuta's four culturas. Eighty-six thousand people call Ceuta home. Officially, no statistics are kept about their ethnic or religious identity. Nevertheless, the Unión de Comunidades Islámicas de Ceuta estimated that 40 percent are “Muslim Ceutans” (UCIDCE 2015). Converts are rare. Muslims either trace their descent to Moroccan ancestors who joined Spain's colonial army or are recent arrivals. Combined, the Hindus and Jewish communities constitute 1 to 2 percent of Ceuta's inhabitants. Consequently, only 58 percent are “Christian,” a term that locally refers to provenance from mainland Spain, rather than belief. My acquaintances (especially those I knew less) were adamant that Ceuta's culturas lived together so well that their convivencia may well be unique and an example to the world!2 When I asked how this came to be, the answer I obtained was always the same. Unaware and uninterested in Spain's long history of thinking about the governance of ethno-religious diversity, they insisted that Ceuta's convivencia was engineered—ex nihilio—by their mayor-president, Juan Vivas. This article seeks to describe how multicultural order comes to be associated with a single charismatic author and explores the theoretical and political implications of such an imaginary.\n\nIndeed, the man I had seen leading the traslado locally enjoyed tremendous popularity and gravitas. In the local press, on social media, and in the streets, Vivas was ascribed superhuman powers of diplomacy. Comics, poetry even, were written in his honor. Thus the subject of so much tribute (homenaje), Vivas was ubiquitously referred to as “the King” (el Rey), for everywhere he seemed to have personal clients installed and/or funded to realize his utopic project for Ceuta. Occasionally, these relationships were described as forms of “enchufismo” (lit. to plug in), a derogative term denoting the illicit circumvention of bureaucratic protocols governing political appointment. This view was primarily held by those who were excluded from Vivas’ favor and/or rejected his vision as morally and economically unfeasible. Though increasing, these voices were few and far in between. Most Ceutans instead talked of “friendship” (amistad) and “loyalty” (lealdad) between people of “worth” (valor). They also stressed the visionary aspects of the mayor-president's network. Prior to Vivas’ ascension to power in 1999, Ceuta's political landscape had been a mess of short-lived coalitions led by boisterous politicians. Furthermore, after being granted citizenship in 1986,3 Muslims formed ethnic parties to contest the “racism” they felt was everywhere—in the infrastructural neglect of Muslim neighborhoods, in the unwillingness to accommodate Islamic traditions, in police profiling, in the mockery of Islam during carnival,4 and in the imposition of Spanish-style names.5 Christians were explicitly hostile to such protest and actively supported parties like the “Grupo Indipendiente Liberal,” which argued for the armed surveillance of Muslims (Rontomé 2012). Vivas was acclaimed to have terminated these tensions. Muslim parties either blended into left-wing ones or were absorbed into his vast inter-religious network of clients. As one minister remarked in an interview, “We now have the good politics of left and right, not the bad politics of Christianity and Islam.” Unsurprisingly, his reign has been one of political stability. He has comfortably won four consecutive elections, and his supporters claim he earned the “right to rule for as long as he wants” (El Pueblo 2018).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe inhabitants of Ceuta would say that the patronage ubiquitous in the enclave cannot be reduced to clandestine material and political transactions between a patron (hungry for votes) and his clients (thirsty for resources). True enough, the bureaucratic organs of the state were being manipulated to place loyal clients in influential positions. Nevertheless, to both supporters and detractors of the mayor-president, such relations were inseparable from the production of convivencia: the idea that, in Ceuta, ethno-religious diversity, harmony, solidarity, and exchange is welcomed and is integral to local identity. From Ceutans’ point of view, the tranquility brought by convivencia was the outcome of Vivas’ charismatic vision as well as his innate ability to spot, befriend, and efficiently deploy talent. It was clear that some attempt was being made to free convivencia from the scaffolding of patronage. As a pillar of identity, convivencia tried to recenter Ceuta as a source of multicultural inspiration. It gave them a narrative to be proud of, and with which to contest larger discourses that depicted Ceuta as an impoverished border fort. As a form of intercultural solidarity, convivencia rested as much on the contractual obligations of hospitality and ritual as it did on funding. Lastly, as a form of social order, convivencia appealed to the unpleasant memories of the politicized ethno-religiosity of the 1990s. The Ganesh crisis of 2014 indicated that convivencia could stand up to challenge from outsiders, but the major question of the age was whether Vivas’ charismatic authority would translate into legal or traditional authority (Weber 1947) after his departure.\n\nOn a theoretical level, the local salience given to the previously described anxiety tells us something about how charisma works. In making individual personhood the origin of all things, charisma distracted Ceutans from asking critical questions about the historical context of their multicultural strategies. It is true that religious leaders engaged in patronage to enjoy the legitimacy that comes with being part of Vivas’ charismatic vision. This gave them personal prestige and authority. It also allowed ethno-religious minorities to stress their Ceutan-ness while keeping their traditions alive. However, this use of convivencia seemed unable to shake its colonial legacy and managed difference with a stick as well as a carrot. It did nothing to address sociocultural inequalities. It divided culturas, folklorized religion, and sanctioned whoever failed to adhere to its rules. The Ceutan case foregrounds the ephemeral aspect of patron–client ties stressed by transactionalist approaches to patronage. Patronage in the enclave was marked by anxiety and suspicion, as clients struggled to interpret and realize Vivas’ vision and wondered when he would find them politically and financially inefficient. As the case of the newspaper editor indicated, Vivas did not expand his network at all costs and only took clients who knew how to handle the media, organize and market projects, work with other communities, manage funds efficiently, and control one's own community members, cauterizing factionalism before it could mushroom into crisis. In other words, clients had to be people who could realize his vision and reproduce his charisma. Bad choices were possible! As with the case of the Islamic communities, some could become dissatisfied with Vivas’ rule and fail to comply with his demand. Once-loyal clients could turn into fearsome enemies. Christians were likewise disturbed by these colonial tactics, which they felt were threatening Ceuta's Spanish-ness. They were returning to monocultural models of Spanish identity, which rejected the possibility that Muslims could ever be legitimately Spanish and thus make claims on Christians and their resources. Vivas’ model of convivencia, never entirely stable under colonial contexts, was particularly problematic when exercised on Spanish citizens; and yet—because charisma made convivencia appear to be Vivas’ unprecedented work—there was no discussion about these nuances in the enclave and no real alternative model of multiculturalism.\n\nLikewise, charisma's main trick was to efface the very social processes that created and sustained it. The people of the enclave pinned their hopes and fears on their mayor-president as the local logos. They channeled their political energies to either participate in his vision or survive outside it. No one, however, doubted Vivas’ powers of persuasion. Absent was the idea that Vivas’ charisma was ascribed to him by his followers as they accepted his life-giving resources and materialized his vision of convivencia. Most pressingly, Ceutans did not pause to reflect on the social processes that gave rise to charismatic figures like Vivas. While some cried for “dignity” and “citizenship,” they forgot that Ceuta's increasing economic and political uncertainty has transformed the enclave into a fertile field for big men with big utopias that speak to local worries. Vivas was not the first. Chances are that he will be not be the last, either. Until those who seek to radically alter Ceuta's current socioeconomic trajectory discover a model of convivencia able to transcend its ambiguous blend of domination and fraternity, and until they address the enclave's multi-layered marginality and precarity, it is likely that the killing of the old king will only see a new monarch ascend the throne, with no option but to rule Vivas’ web of patronage, inhabit his charisma, and continue his “pax regis.”\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThanks go to the Max Planck Institute for Social Anthropology, which has funded this research, and to the members of the Department “Integration and Conflict,” who offered valuable feedback on earlier drafts of this manuscript.
