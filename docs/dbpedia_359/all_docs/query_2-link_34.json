        "text": "Anti-austerity party Podemos has seats in a regional parliament in Spain for the first time after it won 14.8% of the vote in yesterday’s (22 March) election in the southern region of Andalusia.\n\nPodemos’s regional party leader Teresa Rodríguez, who left the European Parliament earlier this month to participate in the regional campaign, said that “change has begun and will continue”. The elections were seen as the first big test since the foundation of the party in January 2014, though the party failed to truly attack Spain’s traditional two-party system.\n\nRodríguez said that the seats in parliament will be taken up by “ordinary people”, referring to the party’s grassroots foundation and its anti-establishment activism. “There will be no more secret pacts in parliament, we will be the eyes of the people,” she said in a speech after the results came out.\n\nThe largest winner in the elections was the Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party (PSOE), which has governed Spain’s second most populated region since 1982. PSOE, led by the region’s president, Susana Díaz, received 35% of the vote, which gives it 47 seats – the same as in the 2012 elections, but still eight seats short of an outright majority in the 109-seat parliament.\n\nDuring the last legislative term, Díaz formed a coalition with the United Left. But after yesterday’s result – the far-left got five seats, down seven from 2012 – the ruling coalition partners have fallen short of a majority. Díaz has ruled out a government formation with both People’s Party (PP) and Podemos, making Ciudadanos the only possible ally.\n\nCiudadanos will be a key player with its nine seats in its first Andalusian election. It is the first time that it has performed well outside its traditional base of Catalonia, though the party has two members of the European Parliament as well.\n\nThe PP, the national centre-right government party of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, performed badly, as expected. It is still the second largest party in Andalusia, but it lost 17 seats compared to 2012, and is now on 33.\n\nTurnout was on 51%, which is 4% higher than in 2012.\n\nThe election is the first of a series of regional and municipal votes in Spain this year, with many seeing yesterday’s vote as a test of electoral sentiment. A general election must be held before 20 December, and the government of Rajoy – in power since 2011 – is likely to struggle to remain in office."
