        "text": "ANDALUCIA REGIONAL ELECTIONS\n\n2022 election result\n\nAfter three and a half years dominated by the Coronavirus pandemic, the president, Juanma Moreno, decided to hold an election on 19th June 2022 rather than wait until December. This proved to be a good move as early summer is an optimistic time and inflationary problems related to the Ukrainian war had only begun to take effect, whilst his unflappable Coronavirus stewardship remained fresh in memory.\n\nThe PP for the first time ever received 58 seats, three more than the 55 needed for an absolute Majority. This was more than double the 26 they received in the 2018 election and more than the 33 they received in 2015. “We’ve made history in Andalucía,” Juanma Moreno, declared on Sunday night. True in the sense of the first ever PP absolute majority, second ever PP government to be formed, but not withstanding the 50 seats his predecesor Javier Arenas received in 2012.\n\nThe PSOE-A only obtained 30 seats - 3 down on 2018 - breaking their 'worst ever result' record again. Juan Espadas, the new party leader, was not well known outside Seville where he had been Mayor. Not that long ago it seemed imposible for the PSOE not to govern in Andalucia. It had even been jokingly said that Andalucia was created for the PSOE. It now looks likes Andalucia does not have PSOE in its DNA, it is that Andalucia does not like change; with only one change of Government in 40 years.\n\nThere was a large drop in the left which was not helped by the split of the left coalition into two. Adelante Andalucia lead by Teresa Rodriguez obtaining only 3 seats and Por Andalucia lead by obtaining 5. Podemos whose late registration meant they had to campaign outside of Por Andalucia did not obtain any seats. The 8 seats the combined left obtained in 2022 was 12 down on the 17 they received in 2018.\n\nThe far right wing VOX party with its new leader Macarena Olona obtained 14 seats, just two more than 2018, thus suggesting the growth of this party has slowed.\n\nPerhaps the most ironic result was the other big growth party, the centre Cuidanos. They lost all 21 seats obtained in 2018. The Cuidanos under leadership of Juan Marin formed a pact with PP in the last government. Juan Marin was vice-president and his portfolio included Tourism. The pact included commitments on cost cutting, transparency amongst other practical measures. Repeating 2015's experience of the left coalition, a pact in Andalucia is followed by defeat for the minor party.\n\nElection Procedure background\n\nAndalucía has one of four regional parliaments that are permitted to call elections independently of municipal (local) elections, upon the decision of the current regional president to dissolve the parliament (the other regions that are permitted to do this are Galicia, Catalonia and País Vasco). The other 13 regions hold their local and regional elections together, on the fourth Sunday in May, in the year before a leap year.\n\nThe Andalucia regional elections, are to elect 109 diputados (deputies) to the Andalucia Parliament, one of three bodies of Andalucía that form the Junta de Andalucia. The diputados of the seated Parliament elect a President (who must be ratified by the King) who in turn forms 'Consejo de Gobierno'. The Andalucían parliament is based in the regional capital – Seville (currently in the old Hospital de las Cinco Llagas).\n\nThe Andalucía regional elections are held every four years. Since Andalucia region was formed there have been elections held in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 25 March 2012, 22 March 2015, 2 December 2018, 19 June 2022. The Andalucia election traditionally coincided with National election. Elections are always held on Sundays.\n\nThe seats are divided by the D´Hondt method of proportional representation (the total votes cast for each party in the electoral constituency is divided first by 1, then 2, then 3, up to the total number of seats to be allocated for the constituency – in this case 109), and if more than five deputies from any one party (across all constituencies of the region) are elected, then they will form their own parliamentary group.\n\nOnly Spanish nationals are allowed to vote in the regional elections; EU nationals residing in Spain cannot take part in either these nor national elections. They can, however, vote in the municipal and European elections.\n\nPolling stations open at 09.00 and close at 20.00 hrs. Preliminary results are published at 22.00 and then are escrutado (checked or audited) over the next few hours.\n\nElection Result background\n\nThe elections take place every four years and the Socialist party, PSOE (Partido Socialista Obrero Español) (Spanish Socialist Workers Party), won the first nine elections and formed governments since the creation of Andalucia in 1981. The president for much of this time (July 1990 to April 2009) was Manual Chaves Gonzalez who resigned to become deputy prime minister in the Madrid government of José Luis Zapatero. He was replaced by Antonio Griñan who also resigned in September 2013 in favor of Suzana Díaz who too became president in 2013.\n\n2018\n\nAfter three difficult years for Susana Diaz, president without a majority and a corruption trial underway involving her two presidential predecessor she decided to call an election in December 2018 rather than wait until March.\n\nThe PSOE was once again the most voted party, but only obtained 33 seats (14 down on 2015). There was a large drop in the left with the left coalition called Adelante Andalucia lead by Teresa Rodriguez obtaining 17 seats (down 3) which benefited Ciudadanos obtaining 21 (up 12). Despite the fact that the Popular Party also fell as in the previous elections, it managed to pact with Ciudadanos in government and for the investiture of Juan Manuel Moreno (PP) with the support of right wing Vox (12 seats) just for the investiture.\n\nNot only the latter being the first time that Vox entered a parliament in Spain this, this was the first time in the history of Andalucia in which the PP gained access to the Andalusian government, unseating the socialists, who had governed since the restoration of democracy. In contrast to other European countries whose political parties have imposed a cordon sanitaire against the extreme right, both the Popular Party and Ciudadanos who entered into a government agreement (the PP had agreed to 20 Cuidanos demands covering economic stability and government transparency) depending for their parliamentary majority on VOX's votes for the investiture.\n\nJuan Marin of the Cuidanos became Vice President of the Junta de Andalucia supporting Juanma Moreno as President. The term was obviously dominated by the Coronavirus pandemic by reasonable management, economic progress and no crisis lead Juanma Moreno to decide to call an early election at the beginning of the summer of 2022.\n\n2015\n\nIn 2015 the president, Susana Díaz (PSOE) broke off the pact with the communist stating ‘lack of confidence with the IU and instability' and called early elections for 22nd March 2015, rather than wait for a concurrence with the National elections or even the Municipals and other most Spanish regions on May 25th 2015. She obtained 47 seats (equal to her predecessor in 2012) with Manuel Moreno new leader of PP in Andalucia obtaining only 33 (17 less than 2012) and Antonio Maillo of the IU obtaining only 5 (7 less than 2012). The reason for the change was the arrival of two new parties - left wing Podemos obtaining 15 seats lead by Terresa Rodriquez and Cuidanos lead by Juan Marin. with 9 seats.\n\nFollowing this result Susana Diaz did not have a majority nor the support of other parties. She was elected president on the fourth attempt on 11 June 2015 with the support of the Cuidanos party. The UPyD party obtained no seats. After Rosa Díez, became their national leader two UPyD deputies left the party's leadership there was a gradual march of party members to Ciudadanos . VOX presented in Andalucia for the first time lead by Francisco Serrano Castro but secured no seats and obtained 0.5% or the popular vote.\n\n2012"
