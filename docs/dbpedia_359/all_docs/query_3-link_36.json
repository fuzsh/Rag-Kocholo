        "text": "History\n\nThe most important parties of the Spanish radical left have historically been the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) and, after 1986, United Left (IU)—originally a federation of small parties around the PCE. They have enjoyed parliamentary representation since the first democratic elections in 1977, although their electoral trajectory has been unstable, ranging from a peak of 10.5 per cent in the 1996 legislative elections to a low of 3.7 per cent in 2008 and 2015. They have a long and convulsive history.\n\nThe PCE was born as a minor split from the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) in 1920. The PCE increased its political influence and membership during the Civil War (1936–1939) and was the most relevant organisation during the clandestine struggle against Franco’s dictatorship (1939–1975). The PCE was legalised in 1977, only a few weeks before the first democratic elections. During the transition to democracy, the party moderated its positions, adopted Eurocommunist principles and actively contributed to the drafting of the 1978 Constitution. However, as in other Eurocommunist cases, moderation did not produce the expected results. The party’s electoral results in the first two democratic elections were modest (9.3 per cent and 20 MPs in 1977; 10.8 per cent and 23 MPs in 1979), and the (social democratic) PSOE became the main party of the Spanish left.\n\nIn the early 1980s, the PCE suffered internal conflicts over its strategic direction (Ramiro, 2004a). The conflict produced a disastrous result in 1982 (4 per cent of the vote), and several splits. Consequently, during 1984 and 1985, the PCE established the política de convergencia (convergence policy), aimed at establishing closer relations with other left-wing groups, and successful cooperation ensued during the referendum on Spain’s NATO membership in March 1986. In April 1986, United Left (IU) was founded, originally as a coalition of seven political parties and independents articulated around the PCE (Ramiro, 2000). This strategy had two main characteristics. First, the PCE participated in a broader umbrella organisation without disappearing as an independent party; second, the new coalition adopted a programme combining traditional democratic socialist principles with those of the ‘new politics’ (environmentalism, feminism and pacifism) (Ramiro, 2003, 2016). Therefore, in the context of Western Communism, the Spanish case stands out for the early date at which the Communists started to modify the supply side of Spanish left-wing politics (much earlier than its Italian, Swedish, Finnish and Dutch counterparts) (Botella & Ramiro, 2003; Ramiro, 2003, 2004a, 2004b). While in programmatic terms the period 1986–2000 saw the stabilisation of IU’s platform (around a combination of democratic socialist and new politics policies), in strategic terms it was largely characterised by the generally increasing assertiveness of IU and PCE stances towards the PSOE and a conflictual relationship with its former sister union Workers’ Commissions (CCOO) (Ramiro, 2004a, 2004b).\n\nAs in other Western countries, several Maoist, Trotskyist, unorthodox and orthodox Marxist-Leninist organisations were also founded in Spain during the 1960s and 1970s. Most proved largely irrelevant except for their involvement in the underground struggle against the dictatorship and their activity during the democratic transition. Most disappeared partially or totally during the 1980s. Only the heirs of the originally Trotskyist Revolutionary Communist League (LCR) and some other Trotskyist groups (such as the Worker Revolutionary Party, POR) had some significance afterwards due to their involvement in IU (both) and Podemos (the former under the Izquierda Anticapitalista and Anticapitalistas labels). The cooperation between some of the historic and new splits from the PSOE gave birth to the Socialist Action Party (PASOC) in 1982, which was one of the parties that joined the PCE in the creation of IU. However, after leaving IU in 2001 PASOC became entirely inactive.\n\nIn addition to these nationwide RLPs, there have also been RLPs at the regional level, the most relevant being those in Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia. These parties combined different versions of peripheral or ethnic nationalism and diverse degrees of allegiance to Socialism or Communism. The Basque terrorist organisation ETA (Basque Country and Freedom) is the origin of some of these groups. The main actors in the Basque nationalist radical left at the end of the 1970s were Basque Left (EE, created after an ETA split) and the People’s Socialist Revolutionary Party (HASI), one of the founders in 1978 of the influential Popular Unity (HB), the unofficial political branch of the ETA terrorist organisation. Until the mid-1990s, HB and EE coexisted until the latter merged with the PSOE Basque federation, the Socialist Party of the Basque Country (PSE) in 1993. The main difference between EE and HB was their stance on ETA’s violence. While EE condemned violence and loyally participated in political institutions HB never condemned ETA's actions and acted as ETA’s de facto political branch. HB ceased political activity in 1997 when, with other nationalist left-wing organisations it created Basque Citizens (EH), another successful electoral coalition. HASI, HB and EH consistently showed a radical left position in terms of their socio-economic policies and EE, while also in the left, adopted more moderate views that made easier its merger with the PSOE’s Basque regional organisation.\n\nIn a similar way, although the Galician nationalist left has its roots in the 1960s, it was not until 1982 that the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG), a coalition of mostly left-wing nationalist parties, the most relevant being the Galician People’s Union (UPG), was born. The BNG was a marginal force during its early years but was able to gain regional office as part of a coalition government in 2005 (Gómez-Reino, 2009). In 1985, the party won a single seat. In 1989, attempting to increase its appeal, it departed from its most radical original stances. This strategy succeeded and the BNG grew in the 1993 and 1997 elections, being in the latter the second largest party in Galicia ahead of the Socialists’ Party of Galicia (PSdeG-PSOE).\n\nThe Catalan nationalist radical left was unable to cross thresholds of representation until recently. Apart from the PCE-associated Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC), which during the 1930s was even recognised as the Catalan section of the Communist International, the most important Catalan radical left organisation was the Communist PSAN (Socialist Party of National Liberation), founded in 1968. Among the fragmented nationalist radical left milieu, the Forward-Socialist Organisation of National Liberation, created in 1990, has also been relevant and it has been particularly significant in the development of the Popular Unity List (CUP) that has recently enjoyed significant electoral success, above all at local and regional levels.\n\nPrincipal Contemporary Radical Left Parties\n\nHaving always been represented in Parliament, the Spanish radical left can be considered as relatively successful from a cross-national point of view. Additionally, Spain is one of the few countries where during and after the Great Recession the radical left has grown, reached historically high levels of support and participated in the national government. This has been a period of mutation for the Spanish radical left. It has included the crisis of IU; the creation of Podemos; the competition between these two parties; the impressive success of the latter; their cooperation and joint electoral lists (in the 2016 and 2019 national elections); their electoral downsizing in those elections; the Podemos-IU national coalition government with the PSOE; the creation of comparatively successful electoral coalitions at local and regional levels (particularly in Catalonia and Galicia); the stunning electoral results of some such local lists in several of the most important Spanish cities in 2015; the formation of local governments with the support and participation of IU and Podemos in the aftermath; the almost general defeat of those local lists in 2019; the transformation of the nationalist radical left in Catalonia (with an increased relevance of the CUP), Galicia (with the rise of the new En Marea and a transitory weakening of the BNG) and the Basque Country (where the long-standing EH-Bildu, which emerged from Basque Citizens in 2012, saw its relevance somewhat diminished temporarily by the success of Podemos in the Basque Country). The 2010s have been nothing short of a roller-coaster for the radical left in Spain.\n\nHowever, not long before this succession of changes, the situation of the Spanish radical left was dire. Between 2000 and 2008, IU faced an extremely challenging period due to electoral decline and internal conflict (particularly over its relationship towards the PSOE, which oscillated from unreserved criticism to collaboration). The reformist government of the PSOE during 2004–2008, whose policies IU frequently supported, placed IU in a subordinate political position (Ramiro, 2016).\n\nIn the 2008 elections, the effects of the Great Recession on the Spanish economy were not yet visible. The PSOE benefitted from the previous economic growth, IU suffered another electoral disappointment and there was a change in IU’s leadership (Cayo Lara replaced Gaspar Llamazares). Once the Great Recession fully impacted Spain, the PSOE government implemented an austerity package in 2010, and economic and political dissatisfaction triggered social mobilisation. As predicted by retrospective economic voting models, the incumbent PSOE lost the 2011 general elections and the main opposition party, the PP, won an absolute majority. IU also benefitted from public discontent, with improved results ending almost a decade of continuous electoral decline (Ramiro, 2016).\n\nThe PP government implemented austerity policies from the start, and its public support ratings plummeted quickly. However, the public showed high levels of dissatisfaction with both the incumbent PP and the opposition PSOE. Amidst the constant corruption scandals involving the PP, parties and politicians were considered one of the main problems of the country in every poll. IU seemed to benefit from the discontent and the polls showed a steady increase in its support.\n\nThe May 2014 European Parliament (EP) elections, held in this unprecedented context of mounting economic and political crises, proved to be crucial. Both the context and nature of these second order elections favoured voting for the opposition, radical or protest parties. It was expected that IU would benefit, and the poll ratings confirmed this. However, in January 2014, only five months before the EP elections, a new radical left political party, Podemos (We Can), was formed. The new party originally grew through the personal and political networks of its founders (a relatively small group of experienced activists, some of them academics) as well as the networks and groups of the 2011 15M or Indignados movement. The appearance of Podemos immediately stopped the IU’s opinion poll surge and transformed Spanish radical left politics.\n\nPodemos succeeded rapidly. The most surprising result of the May 2014 EP elections was the unforeseen 8 per cent of votes and 5 MEPs Podemos obtained. The overlap of political and economic crises, the dissatisfaction with mainstream parties and the very proportional electoral system for the EP elections unquestionably created a favourable political opportunity structure, providing socio-economic and institutional facilitators for a new party (Ramiro, 2016). Simultaneously, IU’s strategic quietism (criticised by Podemos’ founders as political immobilism and incapacity to take full political advantage of the crisis) acted as a ‘political facilitator’.\n\nAfter the emergence of Podemos, nothing was the same for the Spanish radical left. The party family fragmented, and Podemos and IU soon experienced opposing trajectories in terms of popular support (Ramiro, 2016). While Podemos’ support grew exponentially, IU lost a large part of its former voters. Additionally, during the 2014–2016 period the combined support for IU and Podemos, first separately and after June 2016 in their joint coalition, was the highest ever won by the Spanish radical left. Podemos and IU showed two contrasting trajectories and strategies. Podemos’ growth was based on attracting voters and activists from varied backgrounds (including former IU and PSOE voters) (Ramiro & Gomez, 2017) using a populist discourse, proposing radical left policies without making explicit any ideological attachment, and an organisational structure mixing strong centralisation and presidentialisation with high levels of inclusiveness and openness in decision-making. IU, rooted in a more classic organisational and ideological radical left background (Marxism, the Communist tradition, unsuccessful attempts to create a new type of political organisation beyond the traditional party model), suffered an organisational and electoral decline between 2014 and 2016 that seriously threatened its survival.\n\nThe 2015 local and regional elections not only marked another Podemos success but also showed some initial Podemos-IU cooperation at the local level. The December 2015 general elections revealed the limits of Podemos’ rise (it was unable to win the election, its ambitious official goal, and it was unable even to beat the PSOE) and the electoral crisis of IU (although notwithstanding Podemos’ strength IU was able to get two MPs elected). After having been firmly rejected by Podemos for the 2015 elections, a Podemos-IU agreement was however signed for the June 2016 General elections (joint lists, under the Unidos Podemos [UP, United We Can] label, and common manifesto and parliamentary group) in which the results were disappointing. Although the Spanish radical left had never reached such a high level of support, the results were below expectations, below what IU and Podemos had gained separately six months earlier and, again, below the PSOE’s results. After the 2016 elections, the electoral coalition IU-Podemos persisted and under the Unidas Podemos label ran in the local, regional, general and European elections in 2019. It got successive disappointing results. Thus, the Spanish radical left has lived through a time of mutation, both at the national and regional levels, changing organisational outlook, and strengthened through volatile electoral support.\n\nThe Extra-Parliamentary Radical Left Galaxy\n\nAs in some other countries, the Spanish extra-parliamentary radical left has experienced a gradual weakening. RLPs created during the 1960s and 1970s (Marxist-Leninist, Trotskyist and Maoist) have practically disappeared. The extra-parliamentary RLPs are limited to some tiny nationwide groups and some organisations in Catalonia, Galicia and a few other regions. At this regional level, one of the most relevant actors has been the Catalan umbrella organisation Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), which has enjoyed representation in the Catalan parliament since 2012. CUP defends the independence of Catalonia and shows an anti-capitalist and socialist ideology combined with new politics orientations. Members of the Socialist Organisation for National Liberation (OSAN) take part in the CUP. On 28 September 2019, the CUP decided to take part in the Spanish general elections scheduled for November of that year due to the ‘moment of political exceptionality’ of Catalonia. CUP gained parliamentary representation (Table 17.1).\n\nA party that has traditionally been relevant, the Galician Nationalist Galician People’s Union (UPG), one of the main components of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG), was weakened by successive BNG organisational splits and electoral defeats but the BNG remains a relevant actor and has parliamentary representation. Much smaller is the Galician Popular Front (FPGa), a Communist party that has collaborated with the regional branch of IU and took part (together with BNG’s splits, IU and Podemos) in the new En Marea Galician umbrella organisation until the dissolution of this coalition. The Aragonese Union (ChA), a socialist Aragonese nationalist party, although retaining representation in the Aragonese regional parliament, is weaker than in previous periods. The small Navarrese party Batzarre (Assembly), in coalition with the regional federation of IU, has won parliamentary representation and has been able to consolidate its presence in that region. Finally, Castilian Left, an anti-capitalist Castilian nationalist group, has lately cooperated with IU.\n\nThe nationwide radical left parties and groups are, compared with most of the regionally based parties, completely irrelevant. The Communist Party of the Peoples of Spain (PCPE), founded in 1984 as an orthodox pro-Soviet split from the PCE, still survives without any relevance after having been briefly part of IU in the 1980s and has suffered successive splits. Even more insignificant are some Trotskyist groups now almost dissolved, such as the Revolutionary Worker Party (POR), transformed into a very small grouping after having taken part in IU, Internationalist Fight or the Workers’ Revolutionary Party (PRT). The latter joined the former IU radical faction Corriente Roja (Red Faction), causing a split in the latter that gave birth to the even smaller Red Roja (Red Network).\n\nThe relative weakness of Spanish civil society is also reflected in the limited scope of radical left social movements and organisations. There are a couple of foundations close to IU—the Europe of Citizens Foundation (FEC) is linked to IU’s European parliamentary activity and trains left activists for international policy cooperation, and the PCE’s Foundation for Marxist Studies (FIM), which promotes the study of Marxism and curates the PCE’s archive. Both organisations are members of transform!europe.\n\nThe small CNT anarchist union (founded in 1910) does not have any relationship with the RLPs although there is a degree of programmatic overlap between the CGT union (a CNT split) and Podemos and IU. The radical left Andalusian union SAT (previously SOC) was originally associated with the small Andalusian CUP party (not to be confused with the Catalan CUP) which has traditionally been part of IU and has collaborated also with Podemos. The Galician nationalist union CIG has classically been informally associated with the BNG and the UPG. Apart from these cases, very few nationwide relevant organisations would self-identify as radical left or would accept any linkage with the parliamentary RLPs.\n\nThe Viento Sur journal has been associated with the LCR and with Anticapitalists (a group which played a key role in Podemos’ formation but left the party in May 2020); Diagonal, a journal (2005–2016), and Ladinamo, a cultural association, have been associated with left-wing social movements and the radical left milieu. Although they would not define themselves as radical left, much more relevant are the global economic justice association Attac and the social ecologist organisation Ecologistas en Acción, and in both cases there has been a relevant informal linkage with both IU and Podemos. An informal but significant relationship was also established between some groups formed around the 2010–2011 mobilisations and Podemos (and the local electoral lists running in the 2015 elections). Activists from anti-austerity groups such as Juventud Sin Futuro and the less ideological Democracia Real Ya were relevant in the formation and expansion of Podemos. Finally, activists from the Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (a social movement against evictions) have also been part of Podemos, IU and the new coalitions that contested the 2015 local elections (Table 17.2).\n\nParty Structure and Environment\n\nThe Party Organisational Model\n\nAs noted above, IU was originally an electoral coalition among several small parties under the informal leadership of the PCE. However, IU soon embarked on a process of organisational change and became not dissimilar to a political party (with some of the founder parties playing the role of factions in conventional party organisations) (Ramiro, 2004a). It was the PCE who promoted a process of ‘unification’ of the coalition that, despite the original goal of creating a ‘social and political movement’, gave IU this party-like structure. However, despite the increasing ‘autonomy’ of IU and its development as a new political organisation, the PCE has always maintained a leading role within IU.\n\nDuring IU’s development, the PCE suffered a notable organisational weakening. The PCE’s policy to promote IU as a stable organisation intentionally and unintentionally reduced its own role. Nonetheless, the PCE tried to preserve its leading role, which has become (alongside the IU’s organisational model) one of the main sources of internal conflict within both IU and the PCE. In any case, the Communist leaders have never proposed disbanding the PCE; it has survived as the only relevant party within IU, and there is a predominance of PCE members among IU public officials and leaders.\n\nIn sum, IU has remained stamped by the political and organisational strategy originally promoted by the PCE after the crisis of Spanish Communism in the early 1980s. Both dimensions, the organisational (the creation of a new organisation) and the political (the adoption of new ideological and programmatic traits), are related and have recurrently been the source of internal conflict in both the PCE and IU. The political controversies have been around the strategy towards the PSOE and the scope for left-wing reformism in contemporary capitalist societies. In the organisational dimension, there have been recurrent tensions between the project of building a new type of grassroots democratic and inclusive organisation (a ‘social and political movement’ in IU’s words) and the modest achievements of that strategy (Ramiro & Verge, 2013).\n\nIU has certainly not succeeded in its original ambitious goal of creating this new type of political organisation. Despite some efforts to involve individual members in decision-making procedures (e.g. primaries for the selection of parliamentary candidates since the 1990s, and the existence of formal mechanisms for the involvement of members in manifesto and policy drafting at every territorial level), IU has not been very successful in the promotion of individual member empowerment nor of the involvement of social movements and their activists in IU’s internal life.\n\nMembers’ empowerment and the implementation of a participatory democracy model within the party have certainly been one of the cornerstones of IU’s organisational strategy. However, particularly in the field of candidate selection, IU’s practices and rules have always been far removed from the party’s rhetoric. A general and formal regulation to elect candidates through primaries long remained unimplemented (Ramiro & Verge, 2013). Reluctance to open primaries to non-members, and the vague definition of the process in the party statutes made primaries exceptions not the rule. Party leader selection traditionally occurred through a two-step procedure: national party congress delegates select the members of the Federal Political Committee, who then elect the party leader in a separate vote. Thus, individual member empowerment and inclusiveness in leader and candidate selection processes were relatively low.\n\nHowever, these party leader and candidate selection procedures have experienced a U-turn since 2014–2016. The emergence of Podemos and its organisational innovations (see below) made evident IU’s deficits in membership empowerment. Primaries for the selection of regional and then, national candidates were used in which not only members but also registered sympathisers could vote. In the December 2015 national legislative elections, many IU candidates were also selected through those types of primary (although for the June 2016 elections, the newly formed IU-Podemos coalition did not use any inclusive method for candidate selection).\n\nThe involvement of members and social movement activists in formulating party policies has also been one of the most important of IU’s organisational principles. IU has established working groups linked to different policy areas at different territorial levels (local, regional and national) aiming to create opportunities for the direct participation of members and non-members and to establish close links with social movements. Proposals defined by the working groups, ideally the result of the deliberation of individual party members and social movements, would be the main contributions to the manifestos. Again, the realities of the working groups have been much different. Their situation could be described, in many cases, as having invovled a lack of consolidation and only relatively weak structures (Ramiro & Verge, 2013) (Table 17.3).\n\nParty Membership\n\nOriginally, IU’s membership included members of the parties integrated into the coalition as indirect members, as well as direct IU members. Since 1992, all members have had to be direct IU members, meaning that the parties abandoned their mediator role and, for example, all PCE members are obliged to also be IU members (Ramiro & Verge, 2013). As shown in Table 17.4, although IU has been constantly concerned about low levels of membership and has launched several recruitment campaigns at national and regional levels, the party has been unable to attract a sizeable membership.\n\nEnvironmental Linkage\n\nIU’s linkages with civil society have been of an informal nature. The formerly strong although informal linkage with what was then conventionally considered the PCE’s sister union CC OO (expressed in programmatic overlap, very common CC OO membership among IU activists and the presence of some CC OO activists in IU’s leadership bodies) has been weakened by the diverging evolutions of both CC OO and IU (Ramiro & Verge, 2013).\n\nFormally or informally through its thousands of members (many of them activists in civil society groups), IU has been part of most of the significant mobilisations in Spain since the 1980s. However, the degree to which these mobilisations have favoured IU’s organisational growth or electoral support remains dubious. IU certainly seemed to benefit from the anti-NATO mobilisations of the mid-1980s, and the labour-based mobilisations of the late 1980s, and other later mobilisations (such as the anti-Iraq war movement). But these different waves of mobilisation frequently did not result in significant increases in voter support. Finally, in the post-2010 anti-austerity mobilisations (for example, general strikes, mobilisations on health and education policies and the 15M or Indignados movement), IU participated to varying degrees, although it was often absent during their preparation. Particularly regarding the Indignados movement, there was internal disagreement about the interpretation of the movement’s role. Generally, IU praised all these mobilisations, and repeated its official and traditional stances about avoiding party interference and (as in the past) committed itself to promoting a progressive social-bloc together with civil society groups (Table 17.5).\n\nIntra-Party Life\n\nBesides being composed of different parties and independent members, factions have been officially recognised in IU’s statutes since 1992. Such factions have been formed by members of different parties and by independent members, with some members having crossed party lines within IU. IU’s factions were particularly active during the 1990s, with conflicts that sometimes resulted in nationwide and regional splits (Gomez & Verge, 2012; Paniagua & Ramiro, 2003). Conflicts developed on issues such as strategies towards PSOE and the unions, the ideological definition of the party and the organisational strategy. IU’s intra-party life has been far from peaceful.\n\nThe most traumatic internal division took place between 1992 and 1997, involving ideological and strategic dimensions, with a moderate faction opposed to Julio Anguita’s leadership of IU. It ended with the split of the moderate faction (New Left) (Paniagua & Ramiro, 2003). This division weakened IU in some regions. The years of Anguita’s leadership were very problematic in terms of intra-party life: there were additional conflicts with the CC OO and Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV, an ecosocialist party member of the European Green Party), the IU’s partner organisation in Catalonia and with which its relations had previously been friendly. When IU replaced Anguita in December 2000, two PCE leaders competed for the post (Gaspar Llamazares and the PCE General Secretary Francisco Frutos). Frutos was defeated, showing the PCE’s weaknesses and opening a new period of internal division within the PCE and IU over ideology and political strategy (Ramiro & Verge, 2013). During Llamazares’ terms, internal conflicts grew with the PCE finally aligning against him. In 2008, the PCE’s favoured candidate (Cayo Lara) was elected as IU leader and, through the improvement of electoral results, this brought some internal peace. However, the Llamazares faction created a small party within IU to defend their views called Open Left that has, since then, opposed many IU leadership decisions (Ramiro, 2016; Ramiro & Verge, 2013).\n\nLara’s leadership entered a crisis after Podemos’ emergence. The 2014–2016 period was full of subtle and sometimes not-fully-public disagreements within the IU’s increasingly divided dominant faction until a new leader (Alberto Garzón) was finally elected in 2016. The relationship and strategies towards Podemos have been the most recent issue dividing IU, with some activists leaving IU and joining Podemos, some groups opposed to (any) collaboration with Podemos and another group (the majority of PCE and IU) aligned with the new IU leader in the pursuit of a kind of re-foundation of IU and stable cooperation with Podemos.\n\nElectoral Support\n\nIU has never enjoyed stable electoral support. Between 1986 and 1996, the party grew until achieving vote shares similar to those won by the PCE during the democratic transition. However, in the next three elections (2000, 2004 and 2008), IU suffered a dramatic decline that was only reversed in the 2011 elections, the first election in which the effects of the Great Recession were felt. IU has always suffered from strategic voting dynamics encouraged by the majoritarian effects of the Spanish electoral system; a sizeable percentage of voters inclined to vote for IU ultimately supported the PSOE to avoid their votes being wasted (García Viñuela & Artés, 2009). During prime minister José Zapatero’s first term in office (2004–2008), IU had also to contend with a PSOE adopting policies closer to IU’s than was common during previous PSOE governments. Although the 2011 elections, amidst rising dissatisfaction with the economic and political situation, ended nearly a decade of electoral losses, IU’s increase was fairly modest.\n\nIU’s expectations of a strong performance in the 2014 EP elections were spoiled by the arrival of Podemos. Although IU won 10 per cent of the vote, improving over previous EP elections and continuing the electoral take-off beginning in 2011, the results were internally read as a failure. Podemos’ arrival heralded the transformation of Spanish electoral and political dynamics; it signalled an important change in voting preferences, an exponential increase in electoral volatility and then, a profound party system change. Podemos was a formidable competitor for IU, attracting a large part of its former constituency (Ramiro & Gomez, 2017). IU’s worst fears were confirmed in the 2015 local and regional elections. Losing parliamentary representation in some of its traditional strongholds, IU entered another period of electoral decline that, more than on previous occasions, seemed to jeopardise its viability. The December 2015 general elections confirmed this decline. IU-Unidad Popular (IU-UP), the weak coalition that Garzón, the IU candidate, improvised only two months before the election, after having repeatedly asked Podemos for a joint coalition that the new party assertively rejected, only won two MPs, both from the Madrid electoral district, and 3.7 per cent of the votes. IU had survived the worst conditions, but the environment could have hardly been more challenging, and the organisation could not have been in a more precarious state.\n\nNew elections were held in June 2016. This time, Podemos drastically modified its strategy and accepted forming the Unidos Podemos electoral coalition, which included Podemos, IU, the Green party Equo, other minor left-wing parties and regional-level coalitions from Galicia, Catalonia and Comunidad Valenciana. The main goal of the alliance was to overtake the PSOE. The coalition was intended to mitigate the disproportional effects of the electoral system that particularly hampers third parties and to amalgamate the support that IU and Podemos had gained separately in December 2015. Unidos Podemos, however, did not fulfil expectations; with its regional allies, it won 71 MPs and 21.15 per cent of the votes, 10 MPs behind the PSOE and far distant from the governing PP. The failure was accentuated by the fact that the coalition gathered over three per cent lower than the vote share Podemos and IU had had gained separately in the December 2015 elections.\n\nHowever, even if they were lower than expected, the 2015/2016 results represent the peak of electoral support for the radical left in Spain. Although the coalition was reissued, its electoral support diminished in all the elections held during the 2019 electoral cycle (national, regional, local and European Parliament elections) (Table 17.6).\n\nBefore running the elections in coalition with Podemos, IU’s electoral support was very unequally distributed geographically, and it was socially heterogeneous too. Young people have frequently been an extremely relevant group within IU’s electorate, although Podemos successfully competed for this age group (Fernández-Albertos, 2015). Regarding education levels, the IU electorate shows a relatively high level of educational attainment. In terms of occupation, IU shows the diversity of the contemporary radical left constituency combining skilled and non-skilled workers with technical occupations associated with the middle class (Table 17.7).\n\nThe Party Within the Party System\n\nParty Faces: On the Ground; in Public Office; in Central Office\n\nThe programmatic distance between IU and the PSOE, and their respective political strategies, have not made their cooperation through coalition governments an easy endeavour. The PSOE’s policies during the Gonzalez premiership did not favour cooperation with the left, and IU’s strategies during those years gave priority to the defence of their ideological identity and political autonomy (Ramiro, 2004a). However, although IU repeated on many occasions that an agreement with PSOE was impossible at the national level, this opposition strategy was simultaneously compatible with innumerable IU-PSOE coalition governments at the local level. Finally, although the years of Anguita’s leadership can correctly be described as a period in which IU strongly rejected any alliance with PSOE, the last elections in which Anguita led IU (2000) saw a surprising PSOE-IU agreement for the Higher Chamber elections. It was in the 2004 elections when a major change in IU’s position towards PSOE took place. The then IU leader, Llamazares, supported Zapatero’s minority PSOE Government. However, as noted above, the moderate approach to the PSOE opened a new internal conflict so this strategy was merely temporary. The PCE defended a more aggressive opposition to the policies of the PSOE’s Prime Minister Zapatero that finally won the support of the majority of IU (as described in section “Intra-Party Life”). The austerity policy packages implemented by the PSOE after 2010 made any dialogue impossible.1\n\nAfter the December 2015 elections, IU (and Podemos) did not support the proposed PSOE-Ciudadanos coalition government, so new elections took place in June 2016 that resulted in the new premiership of the PP’s Mariano Rajoy. A change in IU’s views towards the PSOE finally took place later. As part of the Unidos Podemos coalition, IU supported the no-confidence vote against Conservative prime minister Rajoy that culminated with the PSOE’s Pedro Sánchez entering office in May–June 2018. In the 2019 electoral cycle, the Unidas Podemos coalition changed its strategy and aimed to facilitate a progressive government in Spain, conditional on members of the coalition being part of it. This finally happened in the second elections held in 2019 and, thus, for the first time since the 1970s democratic transition, the national government included two PCE and IU ministers: Alberto Garzón and Yolanda Díaz (Table 17.8).\n\nRelationships with Other Parties\n\nThe PSOE has traditionally been IU’s main electoral competitor. However, they have also been collaborators in dozens of local governments (and a few regional governments too). The tension between competition for votes and the hegemony within the Spanish left, on one side, and the unavoidable cooperation if they wanted to win office, on the other, has been inherent to the IU-PSOE relationship.\n\nIU has traditionally used a strongly critical discourse against the PSOE. For most of its history, IU has prioritised a strategy that has emphasised its ‘left-wing’ identity against a PSOE that was often equated with the Conservative PP (Ramiro, 2004a, 2004b). IU has hardly ever followed a more classic Downsian tactic of moderating itself to attract former PSOE voters. However, even during periods of harsh criticism towards the PSOE, IU local organisations have been part of local coalition governments including the PSOE.\n\nThis duality has sometimes involved inconsistencies, such as when the anti-PSOE discourse of PSOE-PP equivalence was temporarily attenuated and then a partial electoral agreement with the PSOE was signed for the 2000 elections (Ramiro, 2004a, 2004b). During the 2004–2008 period, IU’s support for the minority PSOE government was subject to internal criticism by the PCE. After the change of leadership in IU and the austerity policies imposed by the PSOE government in 2010, IU moved again towards stronger criticism of the PSOE (Ramiro, 2016).\n\nIU and ICV formerly had a long-standing relationship originating in the 1930s, in the amity between the PCE and the Catalan Communist party, the PSUC. A conflict in 1997 broke the relationship between IU and ICV during the last years of Anguita’s leadership. This breakup was only partially healed when Llamazares’ IU signed an electoral agreement with the ICV, although the relationship never recovered its former closeness. Not dissimilarly, the relationships between IU and the successive Spanish Green parties (first the Greens, then Equo) have always been problematic. IU and the Greens signed electoral coalitions in several regions at different times but almost all ended in acrimony with the Greens feeling unsatisfied with the programmatic results and the organisational interpretation of the agreements. Perhaps reflecting this previous experience, Equo and IU have been generally distant except for some local and regional agreements.\n\nWhen Podemos was launched in January 2014, IU did not react in a significant manner. Podemos’ leader, Pablo Iglesias, proposed an electoral agreement for the 2014 EP elections (requiring open primaries for candidate selection) that would have avoided competition between the two parties, but IU rejected it. IU and Podemos then entered a competition that resulted in the former’s unambiguous electoral defeat. However, the IU-Podemos relationship was shaped almost from the outset by the fact that many IU activists and top leaders favoured an understanding with Podemos (some Podemos leaders had been IU members and consultants), and some IU members defected to Podemos. Given this context, the parties soon agreed on coalitions for the 2015 local elections in some important cities (among others, Madrid, Barcelona, Zaragoza and the more relevant Galician cities).While the 2015 regional elections showed IU’s total failure, the local elections were not so disastrous, as IU proved it still had significant local roots and it took advantage of Podemos' decision not to run in most cities. But the local elections also showed that an IU-Podemos agreement could help to win the mayoralty of important cities.\n\nAfter this experience, IU repeatedly asked Podemos to form a coalition before the December 2015 general elections. Their diverging electoral expectations—Podemos anticipated an excellent result while IU expected a severe defeat—made their incentives different. Pablo Iglesias, Podemos’ leader, adamantly dismissed the offer. He considered IU too traditional and as part of the old politics that Podemos aimed to transform. This obliged Garzón, IU’s candidate, to improvise a new electoral strategy two months before the election (IU included some independents in their lists, signed agreements with some tiny parties and formed the IU-Unidad Popular lists). After the December 2015 elections showed that Podemos did not reach its ambitious goals and IU barely survived, IU again indicated its availability for electoral agreement with Podemos. In mid-April 2016, Podemos, IU, Equo and other minority left-wing forces started talks on a joint list aiming to surpass the PSOE. The final agreement (the Unidos Podemos lists) preserved IU’s identity, and it was agreed that one-sixth of the candidates obtained by the coalition would belong to IU. The 2016 IU-Podemos electoral coalition agreement (in spite of the poor electoral performance of the coalition in the 2016 general elections) stabilised the IU-Podemos collaboration and electoral coalitions. The 2019 electoral cycle (two general elections, local, regional and European Parliament elections) saw repeated IU-Podemos coalitions although at the local and regional levels they were unable to reach agreements in some places.\n\nParty Programme\n\nThe creation of IU moved the Spanish radical left towards ‘New Left’ policy proposals in a change similar to the one experienced by other West European RLPs (Gomez et al., 2016). Soon, IU’s platforms combined environmental concerns, feminism, minority rights, individual rights and freedoms and, in general, postmaterialist policies, with more traditional democratic socialist or left-wing socialist ones. But the decision not to disband the PCE within IU had ideological implications too, maintaining loyalty to some very classic Marxist and socialist principles and symbols. In this way the ‘new politics’ turn was incomplete. This ideological and symbolic traditionalism was very visible in some economic and foreign policies (as illustrated by the nationalisation proposals and by the solidarity shown by IU with the Castro government in Cuba or the Chávez/Maduro governments in Venezuela).\n\nIn social and economic policy terms, IU has combined Keynesian economics with some classic socialist (or social democratic) policies (including a strong public sector with public banking institutions and nationalisation of key industries); it has always advocated a deepening of the Spanish welfare state and an improvement of public services even at the cost of higher taxes. It has strongly opposed the deregulation of markets and has advocated stronger redistribution policies. In a country where both parties and public opinion have continuously shown low levels of Euroscepticism (Llamazares & Gramacho, 2007), IU is the most Eurosceptic nationwide party but shows only soft-Eurosceptic positions (Gómez-Reino et al., 2008). IU supports the idea of European integration and, although since the beginning of Great Recession it accentuated its soft Euroscepticism, IU has never proposed Spanish exit from the EU (or from the Euro, although the PCE position has been more Eurosceptic in this regard). This move has coincided with a more assertive socialist and anti-capitalist self-definition of IU. While in the past IU avoided clearly defining itself in ideological terms to be able to appeal to different left-wing tendencies, since 2008 its socialist self-definition has been increasingly apparent (in this way, the first lines of the current IU Statutes define it as an anti-capitalist and socialist organisation). In foreign policy terms, IU has not departed from classic communist and radical left stances: strongly anti-imperialist tones, opposition to NATO, lack of confidence in globalisation and opposition to international trade agreements, mistrust towards US policies, solidarity with left-wing Latin American and with revolutionary and anti-colonial movements, and radical left parties abroad. Finally, the ‘new politics’ programmatic component has been evident in IU’s support for the demands of the peace, environmental and feminist movements. There is not any major policy area in the cultural liberalism domain that IU has not engaged with (its policies have promoted opposition to nuclear energy, and supported green energy, immigrations, abortion rights, gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights and homosexual marriage laws, among others).\n\nParty Structure and Environment\n\nThe Party Organisational Model\n\nThe formation and development of Podemos is a striking phenomenon not only in the Spanish political context but also in the broader one of European RLPs. Podemos shows how a formidable electoral force was created from scratch by a handful of activists headed by Pablo Iglesias (a radical left activist, former member of the PCE’s Communist Youth and Political Science lecturer with a presence in small media outlets, who had worked until recently as a consultant on some of IU’s electoral campaigns). The combination of a relatively small group of political entrepreneurs and a favourable socio-political, economic and institutional context made possible a stunning development. The party had its origins in the convergence of Anti-Capitalist Left (IA, later Anticapitalists), a very small ex-Trotskyist party that had previously been part of IU, and a group of academics and activists around the Iglesias leadership. IA provided Podemos with some of its initial structure, but its role within the party was soon challenged and marginalised, especially after several disagreements with Iglesias (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a, 2018b).\n\nSince its emergence, one of Podemos’ main objectives was to avoid conventional party structures and to build a new type of horizontal, participatory and inclusive organisation. When the soon-to-be founders of Podemos presented the political declaration Mover Ficha (‘Make a Move’) in January 2014, they claimed that the creation of the party was conditional on collecting 50,000 signatures supporting Iglesias’ candidacy to the May 2014 European Parliament. This goal was quickly reached online. This proved to be another constant feature of Podemos: the channelling of much of its activity through online members’ participation. Podemos advocated the creation of spaces of participation where citizens could discuss the most important issues concerning the organisation and it has tried to create a parallel structure of online participation and conventional party branches, although the party remarkably relies on online tools for members’ involvement in internal decision-making (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a, 2018b). The online system has been used for all selection processes at different territorial levels (leadership bodies and electoral lists) since Podemos’ formation. Electoral manifestos have also been drafted in a way that allows for online members’ participation (submission of proposals by branches, members, experts and civil society organisations, which are then ‘filtered’ by area party officials; and a final ‘one member, one vote’ method for selecting the preferred policies).\n\nThe online system for members’ registration and the internal electoral rules both received some criticism. Online registration has faced accusations of unreliability, due to the lack of effective identity checks. The electoral rules have been accused of favouring the party founders’ faction through the use of majoritarian systems for the selection of the leadership bodies. Finally, although the number of registered members has not clearly declined since the party formation, the figures do not reflect the true dimension of members’ activity and involvement.\n\nPodemos’ participatory vocation soon collided with another of its key features: an all-powerful and hierarchical central leadership. Podemos’ founders benefitted from their role in the party’s formation, their quick success and the prominence granted by their media presence to design internal rules that assured them a huge amount of central control (Ramiro, 2016). In this way, Iglesias and his group of closest collaborators created an extremely autonomous party leadership able to implement their populist strategy with maximum freedom of manoeuvre (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a, 2018b). This organisational model, mixing procedures allowing individual members’ participation through mainly online ‘one member, one vote’ primaries and referenda with a strong and autonomous central leadership, was established in the first party Congress held in November 2014 (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a, 2018b).\n\nApart from the reliance on online participatory devices and very inclusive ‘one member, one vote’ online procedures, Podemos’ structure actually resembles that of many other parties, particularly since the party aims to emulate some mass party features, creating an extended network of local branches, and promoting collaboration with civil society groups. There is a general Citizens' Assembly (party congress), the Citizen Council (executive council), the Democratic Guarantees Commission (party court in charge of discipline and party rules) and a General Secretary. This structure is replicated at the regional level, with the círculos (circles) the equivalent of local and sectorial branches. The party centre has tried to carefully manage the territorial expansion and growth of the party. Becoming a Podemos member is a cost-free procedure; it is done online and does not require any fee.2 Fearing the attraction of opportunists, Podemos instructed local branches against running in the 2015 local elections and forbade them from doing so under the Podemos label (thus limiting the formally championed local branch autonomy). Podemos’ growth mixed the spontaneous creation of local branches by sympathisers and the constant attempt by the central leadership to harness that growth through centrally controlled validation of the local branches. When the party contested the 2014 EP elections, Podemos had around 200 local branches (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a, 2018b); two years later, the estimated figure was around 1,000. However, in the party’s early years of existence many voices warned about the declining activity and role of the local branches (Table 17.9).\n\nParty Membership\n\nRight before the May 2014 EP elections, around 100,000 individuals supported Podemos. In the first months after the EP elections, membership grew exponentially, reaching around 250,000 members (affiliation levels similar to those of parties like the PP or the PSOE, and far exceeding the number of IU members) (Ramiro, 2016). Party membership did not stop growing. In May 2015, with around 400,000 registered members Podemos became the second largest Spanish party after the PP.3\n\nAs mentioned, online membership registration gives members wide participation rights. However, according to the party’s own sources, the number of really active members (those who beyond their online membership have also participated in the online participation processes) is much smaller than the figure of registered members. In any case, the members’ internal participation has also reproduced dynamics common to conventional parties (Gomez & Ramiro, 2019) with an internal ‘elite’ of high-intensity participants and most of the members showing limited involvement (Table 17.10).\n\nParty Linkages\n\nRegarding environmental linkage, although the 15M/Indignados movement and Podemos’ formation comprise two completely different political processes, they appeared somewhat sequentially and there is some connection between them, as many authors argue (Aslanidis, 2016; Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a, 2018b; Kioupkiolis, 2016; Kioupkiolis & Katsambekis, 2014). Podemos’ leaders have constantly emphasised the importance of the 15M/Indignados’ mobilisation as a founding experience that changed Spanish politics (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a, 2018b). In addition, many of the activists who had previously participated in the 15M and the protests against austerity policies entered Podemos ranks. However, Podemos is not the result of the ‘natural’ evolution of the anti-austerity social movements, and the party is not the political or institutional branch of those movements and mobilisations. In sum, Podemos’ relationship with progressive social movements and left-wing unions is similar to IU’s: informal linkage and policy overlap (Ramiro, 2016) (Table 17.11).\n\nIntra-Party Life\n\nAs aforementioned, Podemos emerged from a group of political entrepreneurs with diverse trajectories of political activism, the small IA party and a very heterogeneous membership. These groupings soon divided into two informal factions at the first party Congress (2014). IA and some other activists challenged the organisational rules drafted by Iglesias’ leadership team. Their attempt to secure more proportional internal electoral rules, a more constrained leadership and increased branch autonomy was defeated (they only received 12 per cent of the members’ vote), and they were minimally represented in Podemos’ leadership body (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018b). IA was obliged to transform into an association (Anticapitalistas) to be allowed to continue as part of Podemos.\n\nAfter the first party Congress, Podemos’ internal life was relatively peaceful (at least until spring 2016), although on many occasions disciplinary actions were taken for diverse reasons against activists and leaders at the regional and local levels. That internal calm shattered at the end of 2016 when the disagreement between the two chief leaders, Iglesias (General Secretary) and Íñigo Errejón (Political Secretary), evolved into a very public full-scale factional fight. The development of groups of activists in every region closer to Iglesias or Errejón had been a dynamic slowly growing within the party. The differences between the two tendencies, although frequently expressed in arcane language, were ideological, strategic and organisational to the point of generating informal and recognisable factions. This factional divergence was expressed in very crude, adversarial terms on social media and also included traditional dynamics of internal conflict common to many parties (for example, changes in the composition of leadership teams and appointments depending on factional loyalties).\n\nAlthough Iglesias and Errejón were both responsible for the original populist strategy of Podemos, in 2016 (less than two years after the party’s formation) Iglesias made some moves that toned down Podemos’ original dismissal of left-wing traditions and actors. However, Errejón seemed more committed to the original populist strategy that, according to him, would allow the creation of a ‘people’ overcoming the traditional left–right dichotomy. In strategic terms, Iglesias favoured an understanding with IU that, following Errejón’s stricter populist approach, was less warmly received by him and his followers. In organisational terms, although Errejón was co-responsible for Podemos’ centralised, presidentialised, plebiscitarian and hierarchical organisational model (the ‘electoral machine’ model in his own words) (Gerbaudo, 2019), he favoured a new set of organisational rules including more proportional internal electoral systems, while Iglesias defended the weaker proportionality of the original internal procedures. The third point of controversy among Iglesias and Errejón was around the party’s position towards PP and PSOE. While Errejón defended a more moderate and nuanced position, Iglesias called to adopt a more militant and confrontational attitude.\n\nThese differences were submitted for discussion in the second party Congress (‘Vista Alegre II’) in February 2017. Iglesias’s list won (50.8 per cent of internal support), retaining the leadership within the party. Errejon’s list got 33.7 per cent, and the Anticapistalists faction got 13.1 per cent of the votes. During the 2017–2020 period, the party experienced recurrent conflicts at local and regional levels (beginning with the conflicts in Podemos Catalan organisation in November 2017, or the very serious crisis before the 2019 regional elections that affected many regional organisations with grave episodes in regions such as La Rioja, Cantabria and Navarre) but in 2019 Errejón’s faction finally left the party, causing regional splits in several regions and the running of separate electoral lists for the 2019 regional and some local elections. In 2020, the Anticapitalist faction (which had operated outside of the party already in some regions since 2019) formally abandoned Podemos. In this regard, the internal life of Podemos has been certainly very conflictual.\n\nElectoral Support\n\nThe electoral evolution of Podemos can be described as a rapid breakthrough, a strong showing and a very significant decline since 2016. The 2014–2016 period signalled limits to its growth and during 2017, the polls started to show signs of decline. The party was able to gain 8 per cent of the votes the first time it ran (2014 EP elections). Between the summer of 2014 and January 2015, surveys showed a spectacular growth in intention to vote for Podemos, placing the new party close to PSOE and PP. The May 2015 local and regional elections confirmed these expectations. Podemos was the third nationwide party. In the local elections, Podemos decided to avoid running under its own label to protect its party brand from the dangers of its accelerated growth. But Podemos integrated into broader alliances including independents and IU (in some cities) and these coalitions were successful. Some of these alliances were the most popular list in important cities, such as Barcelona, Santiago de Compostela and A Coruña, and ended in second place in cities such as Madrid, Cádiz and Zaragoza. Stunningly, in all these cities Podemos and its allies were able to head the local governments. The regional elections were also a success for Podemos; despite being unable to overcome the PSOE, they won representation in almost all regional parliaments.\n\nFor the December 2015 legislative elections, Podemos and its regional alliances in Catalonia, Comunidad Valenciana and Galicia aimed to, at least, surpass the PSOE. The strategy of agreeing to alliances with regionally based political actors aimed to maximise the electoral appeal, adapting electoral strategy to Podemos’ weaknesses and the presence of relevant left-wing parties and groups in some regions. The elections were a success for Podemos and their regional alliances although, at the same time, they fell short of the goals of overcoming the PSOE or gaining office (Podemos won 21 per cent of the votes, just one point below the PSOE).\n\nIn trying to finally reach this goal, a wider coalition including IU was formed for the June 2016 legislative elections. However, this United We Can (Unidos Podemos) coalition and the repeated or strengthened regional alliances in Catalonia, Comunidad Valenciana and Galicia did not get the expected results. The coalition lost about 1.2 million votes compared with those that IU and Podemos got separately in December 2015. Podemos and its left-wing allies won 71 MPs and 21.15 per cent of the vote, 10 MPs behind the PSOE. However, compared with the results of the regional and local 2015 elections and with these (disappointing) results of the 2016 general elections, the votes received in the 2019 local and regional elections, and in the two general elections of that same year, were a complete disaster. In the 2019 local elections, Podemos or the coalitions in which it took part lost almost all the big cities in which they held office, the regional elections were an incontestable disaster for Podemos as the party lost many of its regional MPs. The Podemos-IU coalition went from 21.2 per cent of the votes in 2016 to just 12.9 per cent of the votes in the November 2019 election. The Spanish radical left, now in unison, experienced a harsh electoral resizing (Table 17.12).\n\nPodemos has been particularly successful in attracting urban, young, highly educated voters (Fernández-Albertos, 2015). Having secondary or university education increased the likelihood to vote for the new party. Being able to appeal to very different sectors, Podemos’ appeal was more successful among left-wing voters, former voters of the PSOE and IU and those who had abstained in the previous elections (Ramiro & Gomez, 2017). Although the party tried originally to escape the ‘left-wing’ label, the voters consistently placed it in the radical left. Compared with Podemos’ first years, the current Podemos-IU coalition’s electoral base seems to show a notable gender gap, and a decrease in the support received from unemployed and retired voters (Table 17.13).\n\nThe Party Within the Party System\n\nParty Faces: On the Ground; in Public Office; in Central Office\n\nThe rise of Podemos radically transformed the Spanish party systems at local, regional and national levels. Its organisational and territorial expansion and its electoral growth have transformed an extra-parliamentary party into a government party, a numerous membership and a strong institutional presence. This process took place in hardly a year, between the party launch in January 2014 and the local elections of May 2015. After May 2015, this very young party crossed the thresholds of representation and access to government. At the local level, the alliances supported by Podemos won the mayoralty of Cadiz, Zaragoza, Madrid, Barcelona, A Coruña and Santiago de Compostela. Podemos was also key to allowing PSOE minority governments in several regions: in Aragon, Extremadura, Castilla La Mancha, the Balearic Islands and Comunidad Valenciana, Podemos voted for PSOE prime ministerial candidates although the party remained in opposition. Podemos, with a flexible strategy, was able to reach high levels of support in regions with a notable peripheral national identity such as Galicia and Catalonia (through alliances in both cases) or the Basque Country.\n\nThe role of Podemos during the negotiations for the formation of the Spanish government after the 2015 and 2016 elections was dual and complex. Podemos was apparently willing to be part of a progressive government led by the PSOE but established some conditions that made that government implausible (above all, accepting a referendum on Catalan independence). Later, during the investiture vote of the PSOE candidate for prime minister, Podemos did not give support to the alliance between PSOE and the centre-right Ciudadanos party (although some activists close to Errejón defended a less adversarial position in party meetings). After the short XI Spanish legislative term, the likelihood of a progressive coalition government including PSOE, Podemos and IU was even smaller after they all got worse results in June 2016 than in December 2015. However, in August 2017, in a surprising move, Podemos entered the PSOE-led government in Castilla-La Mancha, participating for the first time in a regional coalition government.\n\nThe new electoral cycle of 2019 included the consolidation of the Podemos and IU attitude towards the PSOE: they insisted on a coalition government at the national level, something that was paradoxically possible after the electoral weakening of both IU-Podemos and PSOE in the November 2019 elections, and Podemos entered in coalition governments headed by the PSOE in some regions (Comunidad Valenciana, Islas Baleares, Navarra, La Rioja and Aragón) although its electoral results had been poor. This compensated for the extremely bad results at the local level, where many governments in which Podemos participated were lost to the radical left (Table 17.14).\n\nRelationships with Other Parties\n\nPodemos was created in stark demarcation from PSOE and IU. But after the first two years, the 2016–2020 period involved major U-turns regarding its relations with these two parties. In the first years, Podemos’ founders stated that the new party was needed due to IU’s deficiencies, particularly its inability to take advantage of the crises caused by the Great Recession. They conceived IU’s ideological and strategic conservatism and its failed attempts to renovate its conventional organisation as the main limitations of the established radical left. The PSOE was identified as a part of the ‘caste’, responsible for policies that had impoverished the Spanish ‘people’ and benefitted a corrupt economic and political elite. Consequently, the original Podemos strategy towards the PSOE was unambiguously confrontational. Podemos adopted an archetypal catch-all strategy trying to appeal to every voter but, in practice, mostly attracted left-wing former PSOE and IU voters. In this way, Podemos’ rise intensified competition in the left-wing space and its success greatly depended upon PSOE and IU electoral losses.\n\nThe belligerent initial approach towards the PSOE soon became more nuanced when, without formally revising previous statements, Podemos supported PSOE regional and local minority governments after the 2015 local and regional elections, and when (albeit ambivalently) it declared its availability to negotiate a progressive coalition government after the December 2015 elections. To some degree, the adversarial rhetoric was combined with a more pragmatic approach towards the PSOE, much as IU had always done.\n\nSimilarly, Podemos made a dramatic volte-face in its approach to IU after the December 2015 elections. After having emphatically dismissed IU’s repeated offers of an electoral coalition for those elections, Podemos promoted a joint coalition to try to overcome the PSOE at the June 2016 elections. In this way, Podemos has experienced nothing short of a strategic revolution: from denying any possibility of an agreement with the PSOE and rejecting any coalition with IU to defending insistently a coalition government with the PSOE and stabilising an electoral coalition with IU.\n\nAdditionally, Podemos very soon accepted forming coalitions at the national and regional levels with the Greens of Equo and has shown remarkable flexibility in alliances with smaller regionally based parties in those regions where Podemos had organisational weaknesses or where these regionally based organisations were well established. For example, in Comunidad Valenciana Podemos established a pragmatic electoral alliance for national elections only with the left-wing Valencian nationalist Compromís (they are not part of the same parliamentary group as Podemos in the Spanish Congress and have run elections separately at the local and regional levels). In Galicia and Catalonia, Podemos formed coalitions with regional parties and platforms (in Catalonia this comprised ICV and the group formed around the Barcelona mayor, A. Colau). In the December 2015 elections, these coalitions even included IU regional branches, at a time when it dismissed such a coalition in the rest of the country. However, these agreements suffered some convulsions in the 2019 electoral cycle: the agreement with Compromís was broken, Equo finally left the coalition and in Galicia the previous coalition dissolved.\n\nParty Programme\n\nPodemos’ main innovation has not been policy, an area in which differences with IU policies are minor, but ideological, a dimension in which Podemos has explicitly proposed a prototypical radical left populism (Ramiro, 2016). Podemos unequivocally made the ‘honest people’ versus ‘corrupt elite’ divide the central, most relevant cleavage in its interpretation of Spanish politics. The party avoided declaring itself left-wing and dismissed the left–right divide as irrelevant. Podemos’ attacks against the ‘caste’ abounded in the first stage of party development during 2014. Afterwards, the party moderated this type of statement and coloured its proposals with more classic left-wing references (for example, even declaring that Podemos’ policies represented the ‘real social democracy’). But, in any case, Podemos’ top leaders (particularly Iglesias and Errejón until he left the party in 2019) have never hidden their populist inspiration (modulated with civic nationalist or, in their own words, ‘patriotic’ claims). However, apart from some episodic uses, the original populist tones have diminished their relevance while the classic radical left allegiances have increased their notoriety in the party discourse.\n\nThe radical left-wing nature of Podemos’ populism was clear in the party’s initial policy proposals. Podemos’ economic and social policies have a strong redistributive content (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a). In their first manifesto in 2014, they advocated a drastic increase of the state’s role in the economy—for instance, nationalising some key strategic sectors and taxing banks—and a universal basic income that would be paid through progressive tax reform. However, after harsh criticism by its adversaries, Podemos let aside the more radical proposals to moderate some of its positions, among them, its economic stance, defending a more Keynesian model and pointing towards increasing public spending and preserving social rights.\n\nPodemos’ EU policy is critical but moderate. Podemos does not propose a Spanish exit from the EU or the eurozone, and so proposes a soft-Eurosceptic position common also to IU. Podemos adopted an anti-austerity stance, claiming the end of the Troika and denouncing the democratic deficit of European institutions. However, it does not support a hard Euroscepticism, but rather proposes ‘the need to re-found a new Europe subject to democratic controls’ (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018b), and demands a ‘politically integrated and solidary Europe’ (Kioupkiolis, 2016, p. 2).\n\nIn the field of cultural and moral policies, Podemos’ programme fits classic left-libertarian principles. In addition to advocating LGBTQ+ rights, gender equality policies and the protection of civil liberties, Podemos favours an open and inclusive immigration policy (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018b; Kioupkiolis & Katsambekis, 2014). Finally, the party emphasises issues that are not so directly connected to the main radical left themes such as political renewal, anti-corruption policies and ending the privileges of political and economic elites (Gómez-Reino & Llamazares, 2018a)."
