        "text": "Voters across Spain have their chance on Sunday to deliver the year's first nationwide verdict on a political class whose reputation has suffered greatly as a result of the country's economic crisis and a perception of rampant corruption on the part of public officials.\n\nAll the country's town and city councils are on the slate, as well as 13 of Spain's 17 regional parliaments ahead of a general election due at the end of 2015.\n\nNowhere are the effects of crisis and corruption more visible than in the region of Valencia.\n\nFour years ago the centre-right Popular Party (PP) racked up a comfortable majority in the Valencian parliament after winning 49% of the vote, despite the fact that the regional leader was being investigated as part of a sprawling kickbacks-for-contracts scandal, which affected Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's party nationwide.\n\nAccording to an opinion poll published by El Pais newspaper, the PP's vote is set to halve, down to 24.5%.\n\nBut the same poll predicted that PSOE would pick up only 21%, also well down on 2011, while the centrist Citizens and left-wing Podemos - both new to Spain's national political scene - stood on 18% and 17%, respectively.\n\nEduardo Vicent, a 30-year-old sociologist from Valencia who works as a waiter, plans to vote for Compromis, a local grouping aiming to improve on its 7% result in the 2011 regional election.\n\n\"It's not so much their left-wing policies that attract me as the fact that it is an alternative to the PP and the Socialists,\" says Eduardo.\n\n\"The PP's legacy is a disgrace. They have created a crony network and it's time to try to destroy it.\"\n\nIn the capital, the lead candidate for the Podemos-backed Ahora Madrid is Manuela Carmena, a 71-year-old former judge and pioneer of women's rights and the labour movement under dictator Gen Franco.\n\nMs Carmena promises a \"different form of government\" to the outgoing PP team of Mayor Ana Botella.\n\n\"We want the citizens to enjoy a participative budget because then we will begin to see a different way of appreciating what taxes mean.\""
