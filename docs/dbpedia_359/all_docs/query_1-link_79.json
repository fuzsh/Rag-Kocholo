        "text": "Digital platforms have changed the traditional cycle of political information. In this context, journalism is characterized by collecting political statements, moving away from its social function of providing keys for understanding the facts. A question of interest is whether Twitter acts as a sounding board for a journalism based on statements, rather than as a direct communication channel between politicians and citizens. For this reason, the objective of this research is to analyse the interrelationship between journalism based on statements and political communication on Twitter, within the framework of the Andalusian regional elections held in 2018. We study the effects of the emergence of a far-right movement on the communication flow of the rest of political parties, putting the focus on the similarity of its messages with the discursive media polarization. Through content analysis, a preference for non-issue contents is observed in the campaign.\n\nThe 2019 European Parliament elections were considered by the EU institutions as a chance to reconnect citizens with the European project in the face of Brexit and the breakthrough of several populist movements across the continent. Turnout increased from 43% in 2014 in the EU as a whole to 50%, after the intensive “This time I’m voting” campaign, representing the first increase in the percentage of vote in 20 years. In view of the above, the main objective of this research is to determine the political communication at the EU level carried out during the elections to the European Parliament, both in the institutional field and by the candidates, representing two different specific purposes. Therefore, the “This time I’m voting” campaign is analyzed using a multiple case-study research strategy, looking at how this institutional action encouraged voting. Likewise, a content analysis of the messages posted on Twitter by the so-called “Spitzenkandidaten” (leaders appointed to preside over the European Commission) is applied, studying whether they promoted a Europeanization of the political agenda. As a result, it is noted that the “This time I’m voting” initiative cut across the powers of the EP, which ended up handing its development to volunteers. Hence, it can be considered as a “noncampaign campaign.” Some findings can be used to assess its success, such as the general fall of abstentionism. However, in some countries strongly hit by the crisis, such as Italy, Portugal, Ireland, and Greece, the percentage of vote reduced. Regarding the “Spitzenkandidaten” model, the candidates did not achieve a Europeanization of the political debate in quantitative terms. In addition, there is uncertainty about the future of this system, which has failed to improve the democratic roots of the EU.\n\nThe representativeness of the European Parliament has usually been a subject of controversy which is currently enhanced by Brexit and the development of several populist movements within the EU. In this context, the elections to the European Parliament in 2019 were the second time in which the Spitzenkandidaten system was applied. Bearing this in mind, the objective of this research is to know the thematic agenda set by these transnational candidates on Twitter, trying to find differences with the issues raised by the traditional national leaders. To this end, the technique of quantitative content analysis is used, referring to the issues addressed on Twitter by the six candidates to chair the Commission, as well as the thematic agenda expressed by a selection of the national candidates. The sample includes politicians from the four most populated countries of the Union: Germany, France, Italy and Spain. The results show a more thematically concentrated agenda in the Spitzenkandidaten than in national candidates. Therefore, the European elections seem to move on two levels: the national, in which the candidates by countries confront national issues, and the transnational, in which the Spitzenkandidaten address topics from a European approach, together with references to domestic policy."
