        "text": "The Socialists (PSOE) have emerged as winners in the Spanish region of Andalusia in a election which has produced a possible foretaste of political upheaval ahead of a national poll later this year.\n\nThe left wingers garnered 47 seats out of 109 in the regional parliament, but it was the performance of two newcomers that surprised many.\n\nOnly a year old, anti-austerity Podemos took 15 seats while Ciudadanos (meaning Citizens) on the centre-right grabbed nine undermining support for the two mainstream parties.\n\nPodemos candidate and leader in Andalusia, Teresa Rodr√≠guez said:\n\n‚ÄúWe are the protagonists of change, we are the protagonists for creating new alternatives, of new initiatives at street level to answer the urgent needs of the majority of our country‚Äôs population. The scenario in Andalusia and in Spain has already changed.‚Äù\n\nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy‚Äôs ruling People‚Äôs Party (PP) suffered heavy loses to take second place with 33 seats. Warnings that the new parties were a danger to Spain‚Äôs fragile recovery appear to have gone unheeded.\n\nReporting for euronews Francisco Fuentes said:\n\n‚ÄúThe socialists held on to power but the regional elections in Andalusia have opened up a new era with a new Andalusian Parliament, this time with more political groups. The People‚Äôs Party is certainly the biggest loser from this development.‚Äù"
