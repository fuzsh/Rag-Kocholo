        "text": "SEVILLE, Spain — Spain’s Socialists have run Andalusia, the country’s largest region, for 33 years, a bastion built on the party’s role in transforming the farming region by ushering Spain into the European Union in the 1980s.\n\nBut as Andalusia votes Sunday in a regional election that may serve as a bellwether for national elections this year, the Socialists enter the balloting as a party badly tarnished by corruption scandals and a regional unemployment rate of 34 percent, 10 percentage points above the national average.\n\nThough the Socialists are nonetheless expected to come out on top, the vote on Sunday is being closely watched as a measure of just how fractured Spain’s political landscape has become, as disillusionment with established parties seeps into the electorate.\n\n“It’s the first time in 35 years that nobody here knows what the outcome of the vote will be — and that in itself shows we’ve come to the end of a political cycle, not only in Andalusia but in the whole of Spain,” said Teresa Rodríguez, 33, the lead candidate for Podemos, a left-wing party that is barely a year old and is having its first test in a Spanish election on Sunday."
