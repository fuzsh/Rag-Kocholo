        "text": "So Ciudadanos obsesses its rivals. The PP is focusing its entire campaign on combatting the party. Its slogan “España en serio” — “Spain, seriously” — is an unsubtle jibe at Rivera’s inexperience. Threatened by his popularity, Rajoy has ducked TV debates with him (the sight of an empty “Rajoy” podium at the corner of the screen will be remembered as the image of the election).\n\nPSOE, too, is panicking. On December 4, Pedro Sánchez, its telegenic but underwhelming leader, hurried to two former Socialist strongholds on the edges of Barcelona now firmly in Ciudadanos hands. Meanwhile Podemos is mocking Ciudadanos’ credentials as a party of change while its supporters make lurid allegations about its links to big business.\n\nIt is tempting to attribute the party’s astonishing rise to Rivera’s personal appeal. From the start he has shown a knack for publicity. Ahead of the Catalan elections in 2006 he posed naked, hands cupping his genitals, under the slogans: “Your party has just been born” and “We only care about people.”\n\nHe keeps his clothes on now, but retains his flair. At rallies and debates, he is relaxed and conversational. He reasons with his audience rather than hectoring it. His events are slick and bear the influence of José Manuel Villegas, Fernando (Fer) Páramo and Daniel Bardavío Colebrook. Two academics and one journalist, between them this trio of advisers has engineered one of the most remarkable triumphs of style in recent Spanish history.\n\nAt an event in Madrid, I had to stifle a laugh as Rivera ushered his team members off the stage just in time for a huge banner bearing his name and baby face to drop from the ceiling. The image was plastered across Spanish news for the next 24 hours. His critics see him as an empty shell; a slick rebranding of the old establishment.\n\nThe reality is more complicated. Ciudadanos breaks the rules of Spanish politics. It has outshone not only the two old parties of post-Franco Spain, but even a rival insurgent, Podemos, that was the toast of Europe’s left. Even if it folded tomorrow, Ciudadanos’ success to date would have revealed much about the psychology and self-image of Spain in late 2015; a country not entirely like any other in Europe, one still grappling with a troubled past.\n\nThe first is the success of a rhetorically and economically liberal party in a country with a soggily “Rhineland” establishment. Despite the rich intellectual history of liberalism in Spain — from the Cádiz Constitution in 1812 to the writings of José Ortega y Gasset in the early 20th century — the credo has failed to dominate the country’s politics.\n\nIn the Civil War, liberals tended to support the Republican government, yet were overshadowed by the struggle between anarchists and communists. They were suppressed under Franco but despite a brief flowering after the dictator’s death under Adolfo Suárez, Spain’s first democratic prime minister, were then marginalized. Union, Progress and Democracy, a reformist party launched in 2007 by the philosopher Fernando Savater and others, never made much of an impact.\n\nYet today a professedly liberal party — now championed by European grandees like Guy Verhofstadt — is being talked of as the next government of Spain. It advocates the liberalization of drugs and prostitution. It wants to relax the rigid labor market with a “single contract” (designed to break the divide between casual labor and permanent employment). It wants to cut corporation tax from 30 percent to 20 percent and to lower top income taxes to 43.5 percent. Rivera likes to insist that ordinary Spaniards should not pay “rich people’s tax rates.” His intolerance of red tape and enthusiasm for entrepreneurialism is more reminiscent of the Anglo-Saxon world than the Latin one.\n\nBehind this is opportunism. Studies by CIS suggest that the country increasingly self-defines as centrist (if not “liberal,” a word by which Ciudadanos refers to itself privately but is still somewhat toxic). To occupy this space in Spanish public life is to surf the wave of history.\n\nYet there is also principle. Rivera is advised by the intellectuals of the Nada Es Gratis blog (echoing a quote — “nothing is free” — by Milton Friedman) and in particular its founder, Luis Garicano, a Chicago-educated economist now at the London School of Economics. The Ciudadanos program for Spanish society is similarly liberal. In the words of Francisco Andrés Pérez, a key author of its foreign policy, it wants “institutions that reflect society.” Its mission, he explains, is to bring a stagnant political class in line with a dynamic population. He points to Spain’s diplomatic service; stuffed with political appointees and the scions of grand families, it needs an injection of meritocracy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n* * *\n\nThe second paradox is that a party from Catalonia is sweeping Spain as its home territory bids for independence. In September, ahead of parliamentary elections there, I watched a Podemos rally in Barceloneta, an old working-class quarter of the Catalan capital, as representatives of Iglesias’ party (agnostic about secessionism) were bombarded with hostile questions about the region’s future.\n\nRivera and his followers take a different path, harnessing popular dissatisfaction with the stitch-ups between PSC (the Catalan branch of PSOE) and CIU, Catalonia’s centrist, pro-independence party. In particular they have done so among those residents of the Barcelona agglomeration with ancestral links to other parts of Spain.\n\nThis has seen Ciudadanos tarred in Catalonia as a hard-right bastion of the Madrid establishment, a caricature it has done too little to fight. As such, it has been thrust into debates about what Spain’s “territorial integrity” should mean; the fiscal nature of its federalism; and the sort of settlement that might calm tensions in a country of multiple languages and identities dominated by Castile and its tongue.\n\nThe third paradox is that a party whose politics are distinctly vague can thrive in a country whose modern history has been binary. Spain has a tradition of polarization. According to Antonio Machado, of the generation of writers influenced by the loss of Spain’s last major colonies in 1898, there are “two Spains”: one that dies and another that yawns. This Manichean credo went on to define the country that went to war against itself in 1936.\n\nEven when the dictatorship ended and a post-ideological social liberalism swept across Madrid in the orgiastic “Movida Madrileña”— epitomized by Pedro Almodóvar — its politics were firmly rooted on the republican side of the old rift. In 2008, I was struck by the sheer ideological self-confidence of the liberal-left crowd that filled the Círculo de Bellas Artes, a grand old Republican haunt in Madrid, to cheer the victory of Barack Obama.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Ciudadanos spans left and right. It wants drastic constitutional reform, yet commands the support of swaths of the establishment; it melds a pro-market approach to work with a commitment to extending paternity leave and redistribution. If it has a party-political heritage, it is that of the Third Way.\n\nRivera’s call for Spain to create wealth before it divides it, his praise for “flexicurity” policies, his faith in education and his talk of the “working middle class” amount to a classically Blairite, or Clintonesque, attempt to wriggle free of the old class-based politics.\n\n* * *\n\nThe sheer oddness of Ciudadanos is best understood through its contrast with Podemos. It is hard to overstate how much Spain’s other insurgent force loathes its usurper. One Iglesias staffer described Rivera to me as “a wolf in sheep’s clothing.” At a conference in Oxford I was taken aback when a distinguished Barcelona-based academic told me that Ciudadanos was a put-up sponsored by the companies of Spain’s leading stock index.\n\nEven Iglesias has appeared nervous of the Catalan upstart and their bid for the territory of political renewal: At a debate in Madrid he boasted that his MEPs gave away a portion of their salaries and expenses. Rivera retorted that it was “populist” to judge “good and bad by how much you earn.”\n\nThe basic difference between the two is that Podemos wears its ideology on its sleeve. At its rallies fly the flags of the Second Republic. Its main reference points are in the old, two-way history of Spain. “The future has an ancient heart,” as Iglesias likes to say, quoting Carlo Levi. Ciudadanos, by contrast, gets points merely by rejecting the old divide.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany consider this posture vacuous. Yet Ciudadanos has cut through to the soul of consumerist, urban Spain. Its program responds to a sense of insecurity about Spain’s development. In a country that — with its modern architecture, gender-equal cabinet and legalization of gay marriage — had been compared to Scandinavia during the pre-crisis Zapatero years, it was a blow to be lumped with the PIGS (Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain), Europe’s basket cases. Rivera taps into this; never happier than when setting out plans to drag Spain northward. He hails the English language, the Danish labor market, the Swedish parental leave regime, the German electoral model and Finnish education.\n\nThe success of Ciudadanos has arisen because it has hitched incrementalist, technocratic ideas about the state to the rhetoric of a radical break with the status quo. To Spaniards used to a corrupt consensus, this seems worth a gamble.\n\nOne way of grasping Ciudadanos’ strengths and weaknesses is to compare Rivera’s roots with those of the other leaders. Rajoy’s background is in the austere, celtic northwest, deep in the conservative heartland. Sánchez, with an academic career in Brussels and at a private university in Madrid, epitomizes the strongly pro-European but ultimately establishment PSOE. Iglesias came to politics from the Bauhaus-influenced University City, the campus of the Complutense University of Madrid still pockmarked by bullet holes from Madrid’s great stand in 1936.\n\nBy contrast, Rivera’s base is in the internal-migrant outskirts of Barcelona, a place with little fixed abode in Spain’s ideological history. Neither firmly Castilian nor Catalan, neither rich nor poor, the town of Vallès is that Spain not encumbered by political baggage. In a country where history hangs heavily, that attracts as many voters as it repels.\n\n* * *\n\nIf Ciudadanos does well on December 20, Europe’s politicos will look for broader lessons. Such attempts could prove futile. The party is the product of distinctly Spanish circumstances, in particular Spain’s complicated relationship with — even rejection of — its past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt is much too soon to say what long-term effect Rivera will have on Spain’s politics. Any party that can attract such a spread of Madrid life to one event inevitably contains deep tensions. Several alternative futures present themselves. Ciudadanos could become a split-the-difference party like Britain’s Liberal Democrats. Down that way lies electoral oblivion.\n\nOr it could usurp the PP as the main party of Spain’s right, a free-market force shorn of moralistic finger-wagging, with Rivera as Spain’s answer to George Osborne. Or it could become the voice of Spain’s center-left, a Renzi-ite mix pushing PSOE toward Podemos. Or it could fall as quickly as it rose and end up a historical footnote.\n\nWhatever happens to Ciudadanos, its success to date contains a moral, at least, for European centrists of all shades: Such parties, whether notionally left or right, should be willing to challenge everything that is wrong about the established order in the countries.\n\nCiudadanos may collapse or it may soar. But its stratospheric rise in such a short period of time should leave politicians in little doubt as to the appeal of “institutions that reflect society.” Therein, surely, lies the route to power in the 21st century.\n\nJeremy Cliffe is the Bagehot columnist at the Economist.\n\nAdvertisement"
