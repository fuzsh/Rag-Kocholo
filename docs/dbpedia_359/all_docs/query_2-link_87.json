        "text": "The emergence of two new parties has blown Spanish politics wide open.\n\nThe rise of the far-left Podemos party and centrist Citizens means the next general election, at the end of this year, is set to be a four-horse race.\n\nFor over three decades the Socialists (PSOE) , externaland centre-right Popular Party (PP), external have alternated in power, accounting for over 70% of the vote in past general elections.\n\nBut the impact of austerity policies and a focus on corruption has created unprecedented uncertainty.\n\nAnd the \"indignant\" protest movement, which camped out in Madrid's central square in the summer of 2011, changed the nation's viewpoint on corruption.\n\nThe shift has been highlighted by an opinion poll, external that puts the one-year-old Podemos in the lead on 22.5%, the Socialists second with 20.2%, the PP third on 18.6% and Citizens, or Cs as the party has branded itself, with 18.4%.\n\nUnder Podemos, evictions of homeowners would be halted and welfare guaranteed for families hit by Spain's 24% unemployment rate.\n\n\"We didn't set up Podemos to become like the PSOE or PP - historical parties for our children and grandchildren to join as heirs of the founders,\" says the party's chief political analyst, Carolina Bescansa, a university lecturer.\n\n\"Our idea was to create a tool to allow people to join a participative process.\"\n\nPodemos plans to open up government and submit major governmental decisions to referendums.\n\nCitizens, external has existed in the Catalan parliament since 2006 under the leadership of Albert Rivera, a lawyer who came to prominence through his stand against Catalan nationalism.\n\nLast year he was engaged in talks with UPyD, a Spanish centrist party, which shares Citizens' desire to limit the autonomous powers of Spain's regions.\n\nWhen negotiations broke down on electoral co-operation with UPyD, Cs decided to go it alone on the national scene and is now selecting candidates for a spate of regional and local elections taking place before the end-of-year parliamentary poll.\n\nPodemos and Cs both insist on primaries to select electoral candidates and share the diagnosis of a Spain mired in corruption and economic ruin.\n\nBut they offer different cures.\n\nGracia Escalante, a 43-year-old social worker in Madrid has never voted before. But she wants to see Podemos get a chance to rule.\n\n\"I am angry that the basic pillars of welfare are being destroyed. I want a different kind of government,\" she added.\n\nThe two traditional parties of power are trying desperately to turn things around.\n\nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy is using slightly improved financial circumstances to introduce tax breaks and pushing policies designed to help some of the country's indebted families.\n\nFor his part, Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez promises constitutional reform to set up welfare guarantees and a super tax for the rich.\n\nBut Jose Ignacio Torreblanca, head of the Madrid office of the European Council on Foreign Relations, external, argues the big two have lost their hold on much of the electorate.\n\n\"There is a perception that they are the same, that there is a convergence in their programmes. They have lost the capacity to redistribute positions of power and social benefits. They are seen as increasingly corrupt.\"\n\nIf Spain is on the cusp of a new political order, the first evidence will come in Andalusia, where the Socialists hope to cling on to their last major regional fiefdom in elections on 22 March."
