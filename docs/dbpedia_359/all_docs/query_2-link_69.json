Mercer County firefighters are not far behind, with nine in the last two days.\n\n\"I am not sure about the exact numbers,\" a Whiteside County Sheriff's Deaprtment dispatcher said, \"but I know we've had five already today.\"\n\nAlthough most of Iowa doused burning at least a week ago, Henry County is the only Illinois county in the region to ban burning.\n\nEast Moline firefighter Gene Braggs, who noted the department had 17 grass-fire calls within the last week, said many residents are making the same mistakes that cause fires to spread wildly.\n\n\"Some people don't tend the fire and it gets out of hand,\" he said. \"They don't consider the wind factor or that a spark could light something else on fire.\"\n\nIn Rock Island, where burning is allowed every day, Fire Battalion Chief Wayne Chance said the department has stopped 15 to 20 grass fires since last week.\n\nAt least two grass-fire calls a night keep Moline firefighters busy, Lt. Mike Radford said. He urged residents, who also may burn daily, to \"use common sense.\"\n\n\"If it's a windy day, don't burn,\" he said. \"It's really easy for grass fires to spread on windy days.\n\n\"Also, if you think there is a problem, don't hesitate to call the fire department,\" he added. \"Don't wait until the fire spreads totally out of control.\"\n\nIf the thought of losing your own property does not deter irresponsible burning, a felony charge might, Illinois State Police Sgt. Joel Peterson said.\n\n\"Remember, it's arson if you destroy someone elses property with your fire,\" he warned. \"If it spreads to another property and does damage, you are responsible.\"\n\nIllinois Climatogolist Wayne Wendland said April has seen only trace precipitation, which is at least 6 to 8 inches below average.\n\nThe National Weather Service could have good news for the Quad-Cities with rain forecast this weekend. But expect more dry weather first, with partly-sunny skies, temperatures near 80 and southwest winds of 15 to 20 mph today. Friday promises a 30 percent chance of rain and temperatures topping a more seasonal 60 degrees. Saturday and Sunday hold a 40 percent chance of rain.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
