        "text": "Est. 5min\n\nSpain's caretaker government agreed on a mandate, ahead of the two day refugee summit beginning today (17 March) in Brussels. EURACTIV's partner euroefe reports.\n\nEst. 2min\n\nThe head of the Madrid branch of Spain's ruling People's Party said yesterday (14 February) she had resigned after police investigated members of her office for alleged illegal financing.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nSpanish political parties are poised to name a Socialist lawmaker as parliamentary speaker today (13 January), in the first pact between rival forces struggling to form a government after an election last month.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nCatalonia's parliament swore in a new separatist leader yesterday evening (10 January), putting the pro-independence movement's commitment to break with Spain over the next 18 months back on track after a long political deadlock.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nCatalan far-left party CUP said yesterday (3 January) it would not support acting regional head Artur Mas in his bid for another term, forcing new local elections, and increasing the likelihood Spain may have to return to the ballot box.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nSpain's two biggest left-wing parties ruled out supporting a government led by the ruling People's Party (PP) on Monday, complicating Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's efforts to build a coalition to stay in power after a tight general election.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nA historically fragmented vote in Spanish elections on Sunday (20 December) heralded weeks of talks to form a coalition government, with neither Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservatives nor left-wing parties winning a clear mandate to govern.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nA debate before Sunday's Spanish general election (20 December) exploded into an angry row yesterday (14 December), when the opposition leader accused Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of not being a \"decent\" man.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whose Peoples’ Party (PP) is caught up in judicial probes over corruption, again chose to stay away from a televised debate yesterday (6 December), ahead of the 20 December parliamentary elections.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nThe terrorist attacks in Paris on Friday (13 November) has prompted the temporary suspension of Spain's election campaign. EURACTIV Spain reports.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nGiven the predicted poll results ahead of December's Spanish elections, and the crisis in Catalonia, it would be over-simplistic, and probably wrong, to compare political developments in Spain and Portugal, writes Elisa Lledó.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nSpain's jobless rate has dropped to a four-year low, official data showed on Thursday (22 October), giving Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's center-right government a boost, as it prepares for December's general election.\n\nEst. 6min\n\nCiudadanos, Podemos and the Socialists (PSOE) won't be able to guarantee stability in Spain, according to Antonio López-Istúriz, Secretary General of the centre-right European People's Party (EPP).\n\nEst. 5min\n\nA self-congratulatory party election advert shown yesterday (14 October) by Spain's ruling Popular Party (PP) has sparked controversy, ahead of elections due to be held in eight weeks time.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nThe Spanish government is “somewhat optimistic” about its growth forecast for 2016. Therefore, Madrid should make additional efforts to meet its deficit targets for 2015, as well as next year, the European Commission said on Monday (12 October).\n\nEst. 5min\n\nThe European Commission decided on Tuesday (6 October) to postpone a negative opinion on the Spanish budget for 2016, contradicting Economic and Taxation Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, who had told the press otherwise.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nSpanish anti-austerity party Podemos, seen by many as the ideologically closest political force to Greece’s Syriza, is scrutinising how Prime Minsiter Alexis Tsipras' intransigent position with international creditors can bring political gains. EURACTIV Spain reports.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nSpain's opposition Socialists yesterday (21 June) named party leader Pedro Sánchez to run for prime minister in a general election, due by the end of the year, which is expected to be a close race against the ruling conservatives and newcomer parties.\n\nEst. 3min\n\nFederica Mogherini said yesterday (25 May) that the results of the presidential election in Poland, the municipal elections in Spain, as well as the news from Greece and the UK, were a reason for the EU to re-think its project.\n\nEst. 5min\n\nTwo new forces, anti-austerity Podemos and market-friendly Ciudadanos, made strong gains in Spain's local and regional elections on Monday (25 May), overturning a two-party system that has seen the PP and rival Socialists alternate in power since the end of dictatorship 40 years ago.\n\nEst. 4min\n\nLeftist newcomer Podemos made spectacular inroads in elections in the Spanish region of Andalusia yesterday (22 March), with the vote splitting over the political spectrum in a foretaste of the upheaval likely in national elections before the year-end."
