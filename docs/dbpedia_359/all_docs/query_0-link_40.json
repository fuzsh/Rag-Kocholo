        "text": "Fragmentation.\n\nIt has been a constant theme of European politics over the last few years.\n\nIn several countries we are witnessing a gradual decline in support for traditional mainstream parties, as disillusioned voters strike out in unexpected directions.\n\nThis loosening of old loyalties has been most notable in Greece: hardly surprising, in a country that has just lived through the steepest recession a modern industrial democracy has ever seen.\n\nIn southern Spain the Socialist party won a closely-watched regional election in Andalucia, where it has governed since the restoration of Spanish democracy in the 1980s.\n\nBut Podemos from the radical left - the Spanish Syriza - won an impressive, external 15% of the vote; little more than a year after the party was formed.\n\nThe big loser in Andalucia was the centre right People's Party, which runs the government in Madrid, even though it came second overall.\n\nThe PP will be particularly concerned because the threat to the status quo doesn't come only from the left.\n\nAn upstart centrist party, Ciudadanos, also won 9% of the vote, attracting support from people disillusioned by business as usual.\n\nSo where does this leave the two main parties in Spain?\n\nAs recently as 2008, the Socialists and the PP between them won nearly 84% of the vote in a general election.\n\nThey won't come anywhere near that when the country goes to the polls later this year.\n\nPodemos is still some way behind them. But it is indisputably on the rise.\n\nBut the FN still came second with more than 25% of the vote, pushing the governing Socialists into third place.\n\nThat suggests that support for the FN's anti-immigration, anti-EU message is more than a simple protest vote.\n\nEven if the mainstream parties conspire to keep the FN out wherever they can in the second round of voting, the French elections are another sign that many disgruntled citizens are now ready and willing to look for alternatives.\n\nElsewhere on the continent there are similar stories.\n\nThe rise of the Five Star Movement in Italy or UKIP in the UK, or even the AfD, external (Alternative for Germany) in Germany, suggest that some political fault lines are moving."
