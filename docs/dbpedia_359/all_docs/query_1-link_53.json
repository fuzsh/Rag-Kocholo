        "text": "MADRID — A center-left government has fallen. The two-party system has collapsed. The far-right is on the rise. At first glance, Spain seems a lot like other parts of Europe these days. And it is.\n\nBut the decision on Friday by Spain’s Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, to call for an early general election in April — the country’s third since late 2015 — is also an echo of deeper, particularly Spanish dynamics at play.\n\nA secessionist drive in the prosperous northern region of Catalonia has challenged both the country’s territorial integrity and the core arrangements of the 1978 Constitution for Spain, one of Western Europe’s youngest democracies.\n\nThe result is the rise of a new nationalism across Spain, which in many ways has yet to fully reconcile the divisions left by the darkest chapters of its recent past, including dictatorship and civil war.\n\nSpain’s most volatile fault lines lay just beneath the political surface, turning what might otherwise be just another election into a reminder of unfinished business and the potentially wrenching tasks still ahead.\n\nCatalonia is first among them. All roads in Spanish politics seem to lead there.\n\nThe collapse of Mr. Sánchez’s Socialist government, the rise of a new far-right party called Vox, and the struggles of the center-right Popular Party are partly a function of the Catalan push for an independent state.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
