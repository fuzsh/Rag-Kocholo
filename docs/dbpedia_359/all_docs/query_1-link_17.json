        "text": "A regional vote on the 22 March 2015 in Andalusia, one of the poorest parts of Spain, was seen as a key test ahead of the country's most unpredictable general election in decades later in 2015.\n\nIn the event, the main opposition Socialist Party in Spain as a whole, in power in Andalusia since 1982, led the poll with 35.4% of the vote. The conservative Popular Party were second with 26.7%. The new parties progressed, but did not break the mould of Spanish politics - Podemos with 14.8% of the vote and Ciudadanos 9%."
