        "text": "The aim of the article is to analyse the dramatic decline of voters’ support for Spanish Socialist Workers‘Party (PSOE), a long-term established political party, between 2008 and 2011 parliamentary elections. It focuses on the government policy of PSOE during the outbreak of economic and financial crisis and attributes the drop of support to the conflicting roles of PSOE as a representative of voters‘interests on the one hand and as the governing party with corresponding responsibility to the state and also to the international community on the other hand. Moreover, it links the decision-making on the national level to the supranational level. The austerity policy, pursued by PSOE in given period, was heavily influenced by the EU institutions, and made impossible to comply with the electoral promises, concentrated on the improvements in employment and social policy. The drop of support pursued the PSOE in 2011, 2015 and 2016 parliamentary elections. Therefore, the party is a case st...\n\nDespite the emergence of a critical debate against the EU-imposed austerity measures both at the level of the political elites and on the street, this EPIN Commentary by two Spanish political scientists based in Barcelona finds no sign that the upcoming European elections will have a more European focus than any of the previous ones. While there is no anti-European discourse among the Spanish mainstream political parties, they report that public trust in the European institutions is plummeting and Spanish turnout in European elections has been dropping in the last few years. In the authors’ view, the main reason for this is the low level of awareness of the functioning of the European Parliament but some responsibility also lies with the Spanish political parties and the way they deal with the electoral campaign to mobilise the discontented voters, who consider unemployment and the economic situation as the two most important issues that the country is facing at the moment.\n\nSpain's economic crisis became a political crisis from 2011 when protest movements erupted in response to the direct effects of the former and the austerity regime that followed. However, this chapter suggests that the particularities of developments from 2011 are explicable not simply with reference to the proximate economic crisis, but require an examination of Spain's broader transition from dictatorship from the 1970s and its Europeanisation thereafter. Prioritising stability, that transition was built upon the marginalisation or incorporation of non-mainstream groups and the formation of a narrow two-party system. It is against this backdrop that this chapter traces the emergence of protest in 2011, the rise of separatist movements in Catalonia and the emergence of institutional challenges to the status-quo at local and national levels.\n\nDecentralization of the Spanish welfare state has stimulated regional policy innovation. A ‘demonstration effect’ among all Spanish Comunidades Autónomas has so far acted as a policy equalizer. In Andalusia, where a strong sense of common identity is widely shared, the regional government (Junta) has implemented new welfare policies which have contributed to consolidate its institutional legitimacy. The article reviews the process of decentralization in Spain. It concentrates on the ‘catching up’ quest articulated by Andalusia to gain a similar status and degree of autonomy as those achieved by the ‘historical nationalities’ (Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia).\n\nThe Great Recession has deeply affected the political system. Extensive political disaffection in most European countries and the steady erosion of the representative link have opened a window of opportunity for a variety of new socio-political movements and parties to enter politics. In Spain, the economic crisis was firmly shaped in the public opinion as a political crisis and indicators of political trust plunged. When analysing the democratic deficit, scholars focus on the principal (citizens), usually neglecting the views of the agent (the representatives). And yet, the latter's views are relevant insofar as their political practice is closely related to both the causes of and the solutions to the erosion of the representative link. Little is known about how MPs make sense of the growing distance between citizens and politics-how do they explain the growing distrust in politicians? Do they develop discourses that focus on the economy (the Great Recession) or do they envisage causes of a different nature? Analysing a series of interviews with Spanish regional MPs, this chapter addresses these questions, and, focusing on their narratives about the crisis, tries to throw some light on this quite often forgotten side of the representative equation.\n\nSince May 2010, with the Socialist Party turn over in its government policies and a year later the appearance of the Spanish 15M/Indignados movement, various waves of mobilization constitute what may be understood as a cycle of protest. First, mobilizations took place during the radical shift in Socialist Government’s speech and action in the context of the financial and economic crisis in Spain. And later, after the parliamentary elections of November 2011, mobilization addressed against the strategy adopted by the right wing Government to fight the crisis: cuts in the budget of social services combined with an ultraconservative agenda, social rights cuts. The results of the Europarliamentary elections of May 2014 brought to Spanish political scene the surprising emergence of a new party, Podemos, which got 5 seats in the Eurocamera. The aim of this paper focuses on the link between protest actions and the emergence of a new party. We’ll try to show that protest actions reflect a growing separation between citizenry and the political class; this separation causes an ideological reconfiguration of the electorate, reflected on the electoral success of Podemos in the Eurocamera. With the process of its constitution as a new electoral force in foreseen campaigns, the complete political scenario is moving and, the rest of political parties, from left to right, are obliged to find a place in scene, not just because of Podemos, but as a result of the ideological and political reconfiguration.
