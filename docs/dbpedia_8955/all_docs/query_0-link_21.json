        "text": "The president of Yemen has resigned along with his prime minister in protest at the takeover of the capital Sanaa by Shia Houthi rebels, creating a dangerous political vacuum.\n\nPresident Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi said he could not continue after the Houthis failed to honour a peace deal.\n\nParliament has reportedly refused to accept the resignations.\n\nSecurity sources have told the BBC that Yemen's intelligence chief, Ali Hassan al-Ahmedi, has also stepped down.\n\nThere are reports of explosions in the southern port city of Aden, where President Hadi has a strong following.\n\nHouthi rebel figures publicly welcomed the resignation of the president with one proposing the creation of a ruling council.\n\nThe council would include Houthi-led groups, Abu al-Malek Yousef al-Fishi was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency.\n\nHouthi leaders had previously committed themselves to withdrawing from key positions around the presidential palace and the home of President Hadi.\n\nThe US, which is helping fight al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, said it was still assessing the implications of President Hadi's move.\n\nThe resignation of the Yemeni president and his government is likely to plunge an already unstable country into uncharted territory.\n\nMr Hadi has been surrounded in his home in the capital, Sanaa, by rebels for several days. His resignation may be the last card he had left to play after being pushed to the brink.\n\nThe rebels have publicly welcomed his resignation but it is not what they wanted. As minority Shias from the north, their authority will not be accepted in the south, where many want to return to having their own state.\n\nWith no president and no government, there is also a fear that al-Qaeda's powerful branch in Yemen could make new gains from the political vacuum.\n\nLocal officials in Aden told Reuters news agency that unidentified gunmen had attacked two military vehicles in the city early on Friday, local time.\n\nThree explosions were heard during the attack, which was followed by the clashes, said one of the officials, who declined to be identified.\n\nExplosions and clashes were also reported by Qatar-based broadcaster al-Jazeera, which said they were happening on the city's Martyrs' Square.\n\nIn his letter of resignation, seen by the Associated Press news agency, Mr Hadi said the parties had reached a \"deadlock\".\n\n\"We found out that we are unable to achieve the goal, for which we bear a lot of pain and disappointment,\" he said."
