        "text": "The powerful Houthi movement in Yemen has said the former president Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi fled his house disguised in women’s clothes and headed to the southern port city of Aden.\n\nAli al-Gohoum, a spokesperson for the Houthi rebels, speaking from the movement’s stronghold in the northern province of Saada, downplayed the significance of Hadi’s escape from the capital Sana’a.\n\nHe gave no details on when and how Hadi broke tightened security measures around his house. Little information is available about Hadi’s next plan.\n\nThe Houthis sealed their control of the Yemeni capital in January when they stormed the presidential palace and president’s house, forcing Hadi and his prime minister to resign in the same day.\n\nHadi and some resigned ministers had been put under house arrest for nearly a month. Officials who visited the former president during his custody said Hadi was in need of urgent medical treatment overseas as he was suffering from health problems.\n\nNadia al-Sakkaf, the former minister of information who recently visited Hadi in his house, told the Guardian the former president was suffering from cardiovascular disease.\n\n“He has a heart condition, he has already had bypass sugary in the USA before and he do regular checkups. He is over 70 years old and with the stress and being under siege and the coup and the bad treatment he has been receiving his health got worse,” Sakkaf said.\n\nHadi regularly visited cardiology hospitals in the US when he was vice-president.\n\n‘Legitimate’ president\n\nDespite offering his resignation, Hadi’s supporters took to the streets of many Yemeni cities condemning the Houthis’ “coup” and calling for reinstallation of the former president.\n\nOn Wednesday, large rallies were held in Sana’a, Dhamar, Ibb and Taiz calling for the Houthis to withdraw from the capital and other areas that they have controlled since late September.\n\nMohammed al-Sabri, a leading figure in the opposition’s Nasserist party, said that Hadi was still a legitimate president.\n\n“Hadi did not flee the capital. He left an occupied city into Aden. His legitimacy stems from the nationwide protests that denounce the Houthis’ occupation of the capital.”\n\nThe Houthis jumped to the political panorama of the troubled country in September when they quickly gained control of key government and military institutes and subsequently expanded influence into new provinces in northern Yemen.\n\nHadi came to power in 2012 after unchallenged election following the departure of the country’s long-serving president Ali Abdullah Saleh."
