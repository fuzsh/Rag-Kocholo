His return to Aden, the interim capital, south of Yemen, has been rare, and he is returning to Riyadh.\n\nThe government-run \"Saba\"news agency \" said on Monday that President Hadi met with Prime Minister Dr. Maeen Abdul Malik and Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Salim Khanbashi in the presence of Vice President Ali Mohsen Saleh.\n\nAccording to the agency, Hadi urged the government to complete the achievement of the five goals related to the livelihood of citizens mainly in the sectors of health, education, electricity, water and roads as the nerve of development and community stability in general.\n\nThe Yemeni president returned late last September from the United States to Riyadh, after attending the meetings of the General Assembly of the United Nations and conduct medical examinations.\n\nHe is suffering from a heart problem and has been treated since 2011.\n\nYemen has been racked by armed conflict which broke out after the Houthis had ousted the internationally recognised government in late 2014.\n\nThe conflict escalated after a Saudi-led military coalition intervened militarily in the country in March 2015\n\nYemen is facing the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with around 22.2 million people out of 29 million population in need of humanitarian or protection assistance, according to the UN."
