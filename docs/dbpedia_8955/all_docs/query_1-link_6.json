        "text": "Yemen’s exiled president has stepped aside and transferred his powers to a presidential council as international and regional efforts to end the country’s long-running civil war gained momentum with a two-month truce.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, major players in the conflict, appear to have had a role in Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s decision, quickly welcoming it with a pledge of $3bn (£2.3bn) in aid. The head of the new council has close ties to Riyadh.\n\nWhether the switch will expedite an end to the grinding war remains to be seen, as UN-sponsored negotiations have been at an impasse and fighting, airstrikes and missile attacks continued until late last month. The Houthis did not immediately comment on Hadi’s announcement.\n\nHadi said the newly established council would run the internationally recognised government and lead negotiations with the Iranian-backed Houthis, according to a statement aired on state-run media.\n\nThe move is meant to unify the anti-Houthi camp after years of infighting and disputes, and was almost certainly orchestrated in Riyadh, where Yemeni factions were meeting over the past week to discuss efforts to end the war.\n\n“With this declaration a presidential leadership council shall be established to complete the implementation of the tasks of the transitional period. I irreversibly delegate to the presidential leadership council my full powers,” Hadi declared on Yemen’s state-run TV.\n\nHadi also sacked the vice-president, Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, a powerful military figure, and delegated Ahmar’s powers to the presidential council.\n\nThe presidential council is chaired by Rashad al-Alimi, an adviser to Hadi and former interior minister with the government of the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n\nAlimi enjoys close ties with Saudi Arabia and other political groups inside Yemen, including the powerful Islah party – the transnational Muslim Brotherhood’s branch in Yemen.\n\nThe council has seven members, including Aidarus al-Zoubaidi, head of the secessionist Southern Transitional Council – an umbrella group of heavily armed and well-financed militias propped up by the UAE since 2015.\n\nSheikh Sultan al-Aradah, the powerful governor of energy-rich Marib province, was also named a member of the council. So was Tariq Saleh, a militia leader and nephew of the late president who has close ties with the UAE.\n\nHadi was named president of Yemen in 2012 with a mission to oversee a democratic transition following its Arab spring uprising that ended Saleh’s longtime rule.\n\nHowever, the Houthis, a religious movement turned rebel militia, allied with Saleh and seized the capital Sana’a in 2014, forcing Hadi and his government into exile in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMonths later, Saudi Arabia formed a military coalition and entered the war to try to restore Hadi’s government to power.\n\nThe conflict has in recent years become a regional proxy war that has killed more than 150,000 people, including more than 14,500 civilians. It has also created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\n\nWelcoming Hadi’s move, Saudi Arabia urged the presidential council to embark on UN-led negotiations with the Houthis to find a “political, final and comprehensive” settlement to the conflict, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency.\n\nThe powerful Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has also met with the council head and its members, according to Saudi state-run TV.\n\nThe warring sides announced a two-month ceasefire earlier this month, the first nationwide truce in Yemen in six years.\n\nHadi’s announcement came as Yemeni talks called by the Saudi-based Gulf Cooperation Council entered their final day on Thursday. The Houthis boycotted the GCC-facilitated efforts because they are taking place in Saudi Arabia, their adversary’s territory."
