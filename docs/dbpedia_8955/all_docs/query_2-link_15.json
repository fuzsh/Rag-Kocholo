        "text": "SANAA, Yemen\n\nThe US and the UK carried out airstrikes Saturday in the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, according to the Houthi-affiliated Al-Masirah television.\n\nNo further details were provided about the attacks.\n\nThe Pentagon said in a coordinated effort, the US and the UK, alongside support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand, carried out strikes against military targets in Houthi-controlled areas.\n\n“Coalition forces targeted eight locations, which included Houthi underground weapons storage facilities, missile storage facilities, one-way attack unmanned aerial systems, air defense systems, radars, and a helicopter, to further disrupt and degrade the capabilities of the Iranian-backed Houthi militia to conduct their destabilizing and reckless attacks against U.S. and international vessels lawfully transiting the Red Sea, the Bab AI-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden,” it said.\n\nThe Yemeni Houthi group has been targeting cargo ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden owned or operated by Israeli companies or transporting goods to and from Israel in solidarity with the Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli onslaught since Oct. 7.\n\nWith tensions escalating due to joint strikes by the US and UK against Houthi targets in Yemen, the group declared that it considered all American and British ships legitimate military targets.\n\n* Contributed by Seda Sevencan"
