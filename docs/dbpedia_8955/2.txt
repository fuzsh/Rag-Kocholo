Yemeni President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi left the Egyptian capital, Cairo, on Wednesday for Saudi Arabia after a three-day visit.

“President Hadi left Cairo for Riyadh after a 3-day business visit,” his office director Abdullah al-Alimi said on Twitter.

He described Hadi’s talks in Cairo with President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi as "successful".

Al-Alimi said the Yemeni leader has obtained “serious pledges” from Egyptian authorities about facilitating the living of Yemenis in Egypt.

Hadi has been living in Riyadh since he fled Yemen in 2015 after the Shia Houthi group overran much of the country, including capital Sanaa one year earlier.

The conflict escalated in 2015 when Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies launched a massive air campaign in Yemen aimed at rolling back Houthi gains and shoring up the country’s pro-Saudi government.
