Biography[]

Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi was born in al-Wade'a, Aden Protectorate on 1 September 1945, and he joined the South Yemeni military in 1964 and was trained in Egypt and the USSR before becoming a Major-General. In 1986, he and President Ali Nasir Muhammad fled to North Yemen amid the South Yemeni Civil War, and he sided with President Ali Abdullah Saleh during the 1994 civil war. Following the war, he became Vice President of Yemen under Saleh, and, following Saleh's overthrow in 2012, he was elected President of Yemen as the sole candidate running to succeed him.

He supported the creation of a federal and decentralized government, and he also set about reforming the Yemeni Army. Hadi made fighting al-Qaeda a top priority, but he soon faced a three-front war against the Salafist al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Shi'ite Houthi rebels, and pirates in the Gulf of Aden. In September 2014, the Houthis captured Sanaa, and, on 18 January 2015, Hadi was forced to resign by the Houthi rebels. However, he fled to the Saudi capital of Riyadh via Aden and convinced Saudi Arabia and its allies to intervene against the Houthis, leading to the start of the Yemeni Civil War.
