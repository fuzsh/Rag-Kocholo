        "text": "Period:\n\nSecond World War (1939-1945)\n\nRank:\n\nHauptmann (Captain)\n\nUnit:\n\nKommandeur I. / Grenadier-Regiment 212\n\nAwarded on:\n\nJune 10th, 1943\n\nThe following press article from the Wiesbadener Nachrichten describes why Eitner would be awarded the Knights Cross\n\nThe Knights Cross for Hauptmann Eitner from Wiesbaden:\n\nDuring the middle of February 1943 the Soviet 4th Guards Mechanized Corps attacked the Mius position (at the time still under construction) and penetrated through the not-yet complete German lines. In the process a Rhine Infanterie-Bataillon made up of soldiers on leave under the command of Hauptmann Volkhard Eitner was pushed back after a heroic fight. Contact with the Regiment was broken, and in this extremely precarious situation the Bataillon found itself on its own. Under strong enemy fire, as well as the constant threat from broken-through Soviet tanks, Hauptmann Eitner reorganized his Bataillon and created a continuous blocking position facing the kilometres-wide enemy penetration. Then the Bataillon commander gave the order in counterattack so as to retake the old frontline.\n\nA completion of this operation appeared impossible. The Grenadiers had been utterly exhausted by the constant fighting and marching of the previous days under very unfavourable weather conditions. The handful of armour piercing weapons had been knocked out, and the Soviets held a major numerical advantage. Despite this Hauptmann Eitner and his men were somehow able to push back the enemy in a bitter nocturnal engagement. In the early morning they succeeded in reoccupying the old frontline, which they proceeded to hold against all further enemy attacks while inflicting bloody losses as they did so. As a result the hole the enemy had torn in the Mius front was significantly narrowed, and the conditions were created to destroy the Soviet 4th Mechanized Corps via concentrated attacks while it was still behind the German position."
