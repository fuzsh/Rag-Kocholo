        "text": "Using naturally occurring polysaccharides to align molecules with nonlinear optical activity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nPrasthofer, Thomas\n\n1996-01-01\n\nThe Biophysics and Advanced Materials Branch of the Microgravity Science and Applications Division at Marshall Space Flight Center has been investigating polymers with the potential for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications for a number of years. Some of the potential applications for NLO materials include optical communications, computing, and switching. To this point the branch's research has involved polydiacetylenes, phthalocyanins, and other synthetic polymers which have inherent NLO properties. The aim of the present research is to investigate the possibility of using naturally occurring polymers such as polysaccharides or proteins to trap and align small organic molecules with useful NLO properties. Ordering molecules with NLO properties enhances 3rd order nonlinear effects and is required for 2nd order nonlinear effects. Potential advantages of such a system are the flexibility to use different small molecules with varying chemical and optical properties, the stability and cost of the polymers, and the ability to form thin, optically transparent films. Since the quality of any polymer films depends on optimizing ordering and minimizing defects, this work is particularly well suited for microgravity experiments. Polysaccharide and protein polymers form microscopic crystallites which must align to form ordered arrays. The ordered association of crystallites is disrupted by gravity effects and NASA research on protein crystal growth has demonstrated that low gravity conditions can improve crystal quality.\n\nTransgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers synthesize the full spectrum of inulin molecules naturally occurring in globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus) roots\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHellwege, Elke M.; Czapla, Sylvia; Jahnke, Anuschka; Willmitzer, Lothar; Heyer, Arnd G.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe ability to synthesize high molecular weight inulin was transferred to potato plants via constitutive expression of the 1-SST (sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase) and the 1-FFT (fructan: fructan 1-fructosyltransferase) genes of globe artichoke (Cynara scolymus). The fructan pattern of tubers from transgenic potato plants represents the full spectrum of inulin molecules present in artichoke roots as shown by high-performance anion exchange chromatography, as well as size exclusion chromatography. These results demonstrate in planta that the enzymes sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase and fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferase are sufficient to synthesize inulin molecules of all chain lengths naturally occurring in a given plant species. Inulin made up 5% of the dry weight of transgenic tubers, and a low level of fructan production also was observed in fully expanded leaves. Although inulin accumulation did not influence the sucrose concentration in leaves or tubers, a reduction in starch content occurred in transgenic tubers, indicating that inulin synthesis did not increase the storage capacity of the tubers.

With the results obtained, it is possible to give a general picture of the characteristics of gas hydrates occurring in natural environment. Gas hydrate can occur in sediments of various types, from sands to clay, although it is preferentially enriched in sediments of certain types, for example coarse sands and fine volcanic ash. Most of the gas hydrates in sediments are invisible, occurring in the pores of the sediments, while some hydrates are visible, appearing as massive, nodular, planar, vein-like forms and occurring around the seafloor, in the fractures related to fault systems, or any other large spaces available in sediments. Although methane is the main component of most of the natural gas hydrates, C2 to C7 hydrocarbons have been recognized in hydrates, sometimes even in significant amounts. Shallow marine gas hydrates have been found generally to contain minor amounts of hydrogen sulfide. Gas hydrate samples with complex gas compositions have been found to have heterogeneous distributions in composition, which might reflect changes in the composition of the available gas in the surrounding environment. Depending on the gas compositions, the structure type of a natural gas hydrate can be structure I, II or H. For structure I methane hydrate, the large cages are almost fully occupied by methane molecules, while the small cages are only partly occupied. Methane hydrates occurring in different environments have been identified with almost the same crystallographic parameters.\n\nRecent Advances in the Chemistry and Biology of Naturally Occurring Antibiotics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChen, Jason S.; Edmonds, David J.; Estrada, Anthony A.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nLead-in Ever since the world-shaping discovery of penicillin, natureâs molecular diversity has been extensively screened for new medications and lead compounds in drug discovery. The search for anti-infective agents intended to combat infectious diseases has been of particular interest and has enjoyed a high degree of success. Indeed, the history of antibiotics is marked with impressive discoveries and drug development stories, the overwhelming majority of which have their origins in nature. Chemistry, and in particular chemical synthesis, has played a major role in bringing naturally occurring antibiotics and their derivatives to the clinic, and no doubt these disciplines will continue to be key enabling technologies for future developments in the field. In this review article, we highlight a number of recent discoveries and advances in the chemistry, biology, and medicine of naturally occurring antibiotics, with particular emphasis on the total synthesis, analog design, and biological evaluation of molecules with novel mechanisms of action.

Key to this method is linker compounds for immobilization of the sugar chains to the gold-coated chip for SPR. Also, well-designed fluorescent labelling reagents are essential when analysing the structure of trace amounts of sugar chains derived from natural sources, such as glycoproteins on the surface of specific cells. In this report, we developed a novel linker molecule, named 'f-mono', which has both of these properties: simple immobilization chemistry and a fluorescent label. Since the molecule contains a 2,5-diaminopyridyl group and a thioctic acid group, conjugation with sugar chains can be achieved using the well-established reductive amination reaction. This conjugate of sugar chain and fluorescent linker (fluorescent ligand-conjugate, FLC) has fluorescent properties (ex. 335 nm, em. 380 nm), and as little as 1 microg of FLC can be easily purified using HPLC with a fluorescent detector. MS and MS/MS analysis of the FLC is also possible. As a +2 Da larger MS peak ([M + H + 2](+) ion) was always associated with the theoretical MS peak ([M + H](+)) (due to the reduction of the thioctic acid moiety), the MS peaks of the FLC were easily found, even using unfractionated crude samples. Immobilization of the FLC onto gold-coated chips, and their subsequent SPR analyses were successively accomplished, as had been performed previously using non-fluorescent ligand conjugates.\n\nNaturally occurring hazardous materials.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2011-12-01\n\nThe study of naturally occurring hazardous materials (NOHMs) was conceived as a proactive response to assure that the Oregon : Department of Transportation (ODOT) maintenance and construction activities take the presence of NOHMs into account.

Technologically Enhanced naturally occuring radioactive material includes any radionuclides whose physical, chemical, radiological properties or radionuclide concentration have been altered from their natural state. With regard to NORM in particular, radioactive contamination is radioactive material in an undesired location. This is a concern in a range of industries: petroleum; uranium mining; phosphorus and phosphates; fertilizers; fossil fuels; forestry products; water treatment; metal mining and processing; geothermal energy. The author discusses in more detail the problem in the petroleum industry, including the isotopes of concern, the hazards theymoreÂ Â» present, the contamination which they cause, ways to dispose of contaminated materials, and regulatory issues. He points out there are three key programs to reduce legal exposure and problems due to these contaminants: waste minimization; NORM assesment (surveys); NORM compliance (training).Â«Â less\n\nInteraction of flavonoids, the naturally occurring antioxidants with different media: A UV-visible spectroscopic study\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNaseem, Bushra; Shah, S.

The availability of flavonoids; kaempferol, apigenin, kaempferide and rhamnetin in micelles of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is reflected in terms of partition coefficient, Kc. Thermodynamic calculations show that the process of transfer of flavonoid molecules to anionic micelles of SDS is energy efficient. A distortion in flavonoid's morphology occurs in case of kaempferol and apigenin in surfactant and water, exhibited in terms of a new band in the UV region of electronic spectra of these flavonoids.

S.; Agarwal, Subhash M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPlant-derived molecules have been highly valued by biomedical researchers and pharmaceutical companies for developing drugs, as they are thought to be optimized during evolution. Therefore, we have collected and compiled a central resource Naturally Occurring Plant-based Anti-cancer Compound-Activity-Target database (NPACT, http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/npact/) that gathers the information related to experimentally validated plant-derived natural compounds exhibiting anti-cancerous activity (in vitro and in vivo), to complement the other databases. It currently contains 1574 compound entries, and each record provides information on their structure, manually curated published data on in vitro and in vivo experiments along with reference for users referral, inhibitory values (IC50/ED50/EC50/GI50), properties (physical, elemental and topological), cancer types, cell lines, protein targets, commercial suppliers and drug likeness of compounds. NPACT can easily be browsed or queried using various options, and an online similarity tool has also been made available. Further, to facilitate retrieval of existing data, each record is hyperlinked to similar databases like SuperNatural, Herbal Ingredientsâ Targets, Comparative Toxicogenomics Database, PubChem and NCI-60 GI50 data.

Consequently, it is important to identify naturally occurring antagonists of this channel. Here we show that a naturally occurring monounsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, inhibits TRPV1 activity, and also pain and itch responses in mice by interacting with the vanilloid (capsaicin)-binding pocket and promoting the stabilization of a closed state conformation. Moreover, we report an itch-inducing molecule, cyclic phosphatidic acid, that activates TRPV1 and whose pruritic activity, as well as that of histamine, occurs through the activation of this ion channel. These findings provide insights into the molecular basis of oleic acid inhibition of TRPV1 and also into a way of reducing the pathophysiological effects resulting from its activation.

They can be prepared directly by oxidation of seven-membered rings. They can also be derived from cyclization or cycloaddition of appropriate precursors followed by elimination or rearrangement. This review discusses the types of naturally occurring tropones and tropolones and outlines important methods developed for the synthesis of tropone and tropolone natural products.

The low incidence of adverse effects is the result of some pragmatic solutions by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other regulatory agencies through the creative use of specifications, action levels, tolerances, warning labels and prohibitions. Manufacturers have also played a role by setting limits on certain substances and developing mitigation procedures for process-induced toxins. Regardless of measures taken by regulators and food producers to protect consumers from natural food toxins, consumption of small levels of these materials is unavoidable. Although the risk for toxicity due to consumption of food toxins is fairly low, there is always the possibility of toxicity due to contamination, overconsumption, allergy or an unpredictable idiosyncratic response. The purpose of this review is to provide a toxicological and regulatory overview of some of the toxins present in some commonly consumed foods, and where possible, discuss the steps that have been taken to reduce consumer exposure, many of which are possible because of the unique process of food regulation in the United States.

In particular, there is no evidence for naturally occurring tumours in pre-bilaterian animals, such as sponges and cnidarians. This is somewhat surprising given that recent computational studies have predicted that most metazoans might be prone to develop tumours. Here we provide first evidence for naturally occurring tumours in two species of Hydra. Histological, cellular and molecular data reveal that these tumours are transplantable and might originate by differentiation arrest of female gametes. Growth of tumour cells is independent from the cellular environment. Tumour-bearing polyps have significantly reduced fitness. In addition, Hydra tumours show a greatly altered transcriptome that mimics expression shifts in vertebrate cancers. Therefore, this study shows that spontaneous tumours have deep evolutionary roots and that early branching animals may be informative in revealing the fundamental mechanisms of tumorigenesis.\n\nN-methyltetrahydropyridines and pyridinium cations as toxins and comparison with naturally-occurring alkaloids.\n\nPubMed\n\nHerraiz, TomÃ¡s\n\n2016-11-01\n\n1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium cation (MPP + ) are selective dopaminergic neurotoxins producing Parkinsonism. MPTP is activated by monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) to MPP + that inhibits mitochondrial function. Molecules resembling MPTP which afford pyridinium cations are also neurotoxins. The herbicide paraquat (a bipyridinium dication) and the naturally-occurring Î²-carboline and isoquinoline alkaloids are structural analogues of MPTP/MPP + . Paraquat generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) producing neurotoxicity by a mechanism that differs from MPTP/MPP + . Human exposure to PQ is increasingly associated with neurodegeneration. Tetrahydro-Î²-carbolines (THÎ²Cs), Î²-carbolines (Î²Cs) and tetrahydroisoquinolines (TIQ s ) are bioactive compounds occurring in foods and the human body. They are not MPTP-like toxins and do not appear to induce neurotoxicity at normal levels of exposure. Among TIQs, endogenous dopamine-derived TIQs (i.e. salsolinol) and 1-benzyl-TIQ are toxic through ROS generation. In contrast, Î²-carbolinium (Î²C + s) and isoquinolinium cations (IQ + s) are neurotoxicants resembling MPP + although they are less potent and selective. Î²C + s and IQ + s have been detected in the human brain but their toxicological significance remains unknown. THÎ²Cs/Î²Cs and TIQs are activated to toxic cations by N-methyltransferases (NMT) and/or heme peroxidases and are metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Remarkably, recent findings suggest, instead, that Î²Cs and TIQs are neuroprotectants and neurorestorative, raising the interest of these molecules. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of such heavy metals on human health have been extensively studied and reviewed by international organizations such as WHO. Due to their toxicity, heavy metal contaminations have been regulated by national environmental standards in many countries, and/or laws such as the Soil Contamination Countermeasures Act in Japan. Leaching of naturally occurring heavy metals from the soils, especially those around abandoned metal mines into surrounding water systems, either groundwater or surface water systems, is one of the major pathways of exposure. Therefore, understanding the leaching properties of toxic heavy metals from naturally polluted soils is of fundamentally importance for effectively managing abandoned metal mines, excavated rocks discharged from infrastructure constructions such as tunneling, and/or selecting a pertinent countermeasure against pollution when it is necessary. In this study, soil samples taken from the surroundings of abandoned metal mines in different regions in Japan were collected and analyzed. The samples contained multiple heavy metals such as lead, arsenic and chromium. Standard leaching test and sequential leaching test considering different forms of contaminants, such as trivalent and pentavalent arsenics, and trivalent and hexavalent chromiums, together with standard test for evaluating total concentration, X-ray Fluorescence Analysis (XRF), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) tests were performed. In addition, sequential leaching tests were performed to evaluate long-term leaching properties of lead from representative samples. This presentation introduces the details of the above experimental study, discusses the relationships among leaching properties and chemical and mineral compositions, indicates the difficulties associated with\n\nA naturally occurring, noncanonical GTP aptamer made of simple tandem repeats\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCurtis, Edward A; Liu, David R\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRecently, we used in vitro selection to identify a new class of naturally occurring GTP aptamer called the G motif. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a second class of naturally occurring GTP aptamer, the âCA motif.â The primary sequence of this aptamer is unusual in that it consists entirely of tandem repeats of CA-rich motifs as short as three nucleotides. Several active variants of the CA motif aptamer lack the ability to form consecutive Watson-Crick base pairs in any register, while others consist of repeats containing only cytidine and adenosine residues, indicating that noncanonical interactions play important roles in its structure. The circular dichroism spectrum of the CA motif aptamer is distinct from that of A-form RNA and other major classes of nucleic acid structures. Bioinformatic searches indicate that the CA motif is absent from most archaeal and bacterial genomes, but occurs in at least 70 percent of approximately 400 eukaryotic genomes examined. These searches also uncovered several phylogenetically conserved examples of the CA motif in rodent (mouse and rat) genomes. Together, these results reveal the existence of a second class of naturally occurring GTP aptamer whose sequence requirements, like that of the G motif, are not consistent with those of a canonical secondary structure. They also indicate a new and unexpected potential biochemical activity of certain naturally occurring tandem repeats.

Modulators of these interactions are supposed to be candidates for the development of novel drugs. Here, we describe the role of the small, polycationic and highly abundant natural polyamines that could efficiently bind to charged spots at protein interfaces as modulators of such protein-protein interactions. Using the mitochondrial cytochrome P45011A1 (CYP11A1) electron transfer system as a model, we have analyzed the capability of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine at physiologically relevant concentrations to affect the protein-protein interactions between adrenodoxin reductase (AdR), adrenodoxin (Adx), and CYP11A1. The actions of polyamines on the individual components, on their association/dissociation, on electron transfer, and on substrate conversion were examined. These studies revealed modulating effects of polyamines on distinct interactions and on the entire system in a complex way. Modulation via changed protein-protein interactions appeared plausible from docking experiments that suggested favourable high-affinity binding sites of polyamines (spermine>spermidine>putrescine) at the AdR-Adx interface. Our findings imply for the first time that small endogenous compounds are capable of interfering with distinct components of transient protein complexes and might control protein functions by modulating electrostatic protein-protein interactions.\n\nComparative Toxicology of Libby Amphibole and Naturally Occurring Asbestos\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nSummary sentence: Comparative toxicology of Libby amphibole (LA) and site-specific naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) provides new insights on physical properties influencing health effects and mechanisms of asbestos-induced inflammation, fibrosis, and tumorigenesis.Introduction/...\n\nHemostatic abnormalities in dogs with naturally occurring heatstroke.\n\nPubMed\n\nBruchim, Yaron; Kelmer, Efrat; Cohen, Adar; Codner, Carolina; Segev, Gilad; Aroch, Itamar\n\n2017-05-01\n\nTo investigate hemostatic analyte abnormalities and their association with mortality in dogs with naturally occurring heatstroke. Prospective observational study. University teaching hospital. Thirty client-owned dogs with naturally occurring heatstroke. None. Citrated and EDTA blood samples were collected at presentation and at 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours postpresentation (PP). Hemostatic tests performed included platelet count, prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin times (PT and aPTT, respectively), antithrombin activity (ATA), total protein C activity (tPCA), fibrinogen, and D-dimer concentrations. The overall survival rate was 60% (18/30 dogs). Older age, higher heart rate and rectal temperature at presentation, and time from onset of clinical signs to presentation were significantly associated with mortality. Hemostatic analytes at presentation were not associated with mortality. Prolonged PT and aPTT at 12-24 hours PP, lower tPCA at 12 hours PP, and hypofibrinogenemia at 24 hours PP were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with mortality. Increased D-dimer concentration and low ATA were common at all time points, but were not associated with mortality. The frequency of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) increased in nonsurvivors throughout hospitalization, but the development of DIC was not associated with mortality. The number of abnormal coagulation disturbances during the first 24 hours was significantly higher in nonsurvivors (P = 0.04). Hemostatic derangements are common in dogs with naturally occurring heatstroke. Alterations in PT, aPTT, tPCA, and fibrinogen concentrations appear to be associated with the outcome at 12-24 hours PP, exemplifying the need for serial measurement of multiple laboratory hemostatic tests during hospitalization, even when within reference interval on presentation. The development of DIC, as defined in this cohort, was not associated with mortality; however, nonsurvivors had significantly more coagulation\n\nNatural Transformation of Campylobacter jejuni Occurs Beyond Limits of Growth\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVegge, Christina S.; BrÃ¸ndsted, Lone; Ligowska-MarzÄta, MaÅgorzata; Ingmer, Hanne\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCampylobacter jejuni is a human bacterial pathogen. While poultry is considered to be a major source of food borne campylobacteriosis, C. jejuni is frequently found in the external environment, and water is another well-known source of human infections. Natural transformation is considered to be one of the main mechanisms for mediating transfer of genetic material and evolution of the organism. Given the diverse habitats of C. jejuni we set out to examine how environmental conditions and physiological processes affect natural transformation of C. jejuni. We show that the efficiency of transformation is correlated to the growth conditions, but more importantly that transformation occurs at growth-restrictive conditions as well as in the late stationary phase; hence revealing that growth per se is not required for C. jejuni to be competent. Yet, natural transformation of C. jejuni is an energy dependent process, that occurs in the absence of transcription but requires an active translational machinery. Moreover, we show the ATP dependent ClpP protease to be important for transformation, which possibly could be associated with reduced protein glycosylation in the ClpP mutant. In contrast, competence of C. jejuni was neither found to be involved in DNA repair following DNA damage nor to provide a growth benefit. Kinetic studies revealed that several transformation events occur per cell cycle indicating that natural transformation of C. jejuni is a highly efficient process. Thus, our findings suggest that horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation takes place in various habitats occupied by C. jejuni.

In this perspective, we explore how connecting Natureâs small molecules to the genes that encode them has sparked a renaissance in natural product research, focusing primarily on the biosynthesis of polyketides and nonribosomal peptides. We survey monomer biogenesis, coupling chemistries from templated and non-templated pathways, and the broad set of tailoring reactions and hybrid pathways that give rise to the diverse scaffolds and functionalization patterns of natural products. We conclude by considering two questions: What would it take to find all natural product scaffolds? What kind of scientists will be studying natural products in the future? PMID:20121095\n\nTechnologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials.\n\nPubMed\n\nVearrier, David; Curtis, John A; Greenberg, Michael I\n\n2009-05-01\n\nNaturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM) are ubiquitous throughout the earth's crust. Human manipulation of NORM for economic ends, such as mining, ore processing, fossil fuel extraction, and commercial aviation, may lead to what is known as \"technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials,\" often called TENORM. The existence of TENORM results in an increased risk for human exposure to radioactivity. Workers in TENORM-producing industries may be occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. TENORM industries may release significant amounts of radioactive material into the environment resulting in the potential for widespread exposure to ionizing radiation. These industries include mining, phosphate processing, metal ore processing, heavy mineral sand processing, titanium pigment production, fossil fuel extraction and combustion, manufacture of building materials, thorium compounds, aviation, and scrap metal processing. A search of the PubMed database ( www.pubmed.com ) and Ovid Medline database ( ovidsp.tx.ovid.com ) was performed using a variety of search terms including NORM, TENORM, and occupational radiation exposure. A total of 133 articles were identified, retrieved, and reviewed. Seventy-three peer-reviewed articles were chosen to be cited in this review. A number of studies have evaluated the extent of ionizing radiation exposure both among workers and the general public due to TENORM. Quantification of radiation exposure is limited because of modeling constraints. In some occupational settings, an increased risk of cancer has been reported and postulated to be secondary to exposure to TENORM, though these reports have not been validated using toxicological principles. NORM and TENORM have the potential to cause important human health effects. It is important that these adverse health effects are evaluated using the basic principles of toxicology, including the magnitude and type of exposure, as well as threshold and dose response.\n\nOrbital nature of electronic states and elementary acts of their deactivation in a homologous series of phenylmethane molecules\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPak, M.A.; Shigorin, D.N.; Konoplev, G.G.\n\n1986-11-01\n\nThe aim of this work is to establish the mechanisms of the elementary acts of photophysical and photochemical processes in an homologous series of phenylmethane molecules Ph/sub n/C-H/sub m-n/, where m = 4, n = 1,...,4, and pH is a phenyl radical. The molecules that form the homologous series belong to the same orbital class (in this case sigma..pi..) and the same spectral-luminescence systematization group (SLG). In the studied series of molecules, as a result of the change of the number of the (Ph) and (C-H) systems, an evolution of the orbital nature of the states occurs (in the givenmoreÂ Â» orbital class) on insignificant change of their relative position. As a result of this a considerable redistribution of the relaxation channels of the electron-excitation energy and the rate constants of the radiation and radiationless processes takes place. To establish the character of these changes they performed experimental and theoretical studies of the mentioned series of molecules.Â«Â less\n\nRegulation of naturally occurring radioactive materials in Australia.\n\nPubMed\n\nJeffries, Cameron; Akber, Riaz; Johnston, Andrew; Cassels, Brad\n\n2011-07-01\n\nIn order to promote uniformity between jurisdictions, the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) has developed the National Directory for Radiation Protection, which is a regulatory framework that all Australian governments have agreed to adopt. There is a large and diverse range of industries involved in mining or mineral processing, and the production of fossil fuels in Australia. Enhanced levels of naturally occurring radionuclides can be associated with mineral extraction and processing, other industries (e.g. metal recycling) and some products (e.g. plasterboard). ARPANSA, in conjunction with industry and State regulators, has undertaken a review and assessment of naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM) management in Australian industries. This review has resulted in guidance on the management of NORM that will be included in the National Directory for Radiation Protection. The first NORM safety guide provides the framework for NORM management and addresses specific NORM issues in oil and gas production, bauxite, aluminium and phosphate industries. Over time further guidance material for other NORM-related industries will be developed. This presentation will provide an overview of the regulatory approach to managing NORM industries in Australia.\n\nURBAN STORMWATER TRACING WITH THE NATURALLY OCCURRING DEUTERIUM ISOTOPE\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nMeasurements of the naturally-occurring deuterium isotope assist the tracing of water components during wet-weather flows in an urban watershed.

J.; Draghia-Akli, R.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nRelatively low levels of expression from naturally occurring promoters have limited the use of muscle as a gene therapy target. Myogenic restricted gene promoters display complex organization usually involving combinations of several myogenic regulatory elements. By random assembly of E-box, MEF-2, TEF-1, and SRE sites into synthetic promoter recombinant libraries, and screening of hundreds of individual clones for transcriptional activity in vitro and in vivo, several artificial promoters were isolated whose transcriptional potencies greatly exceed those of natural myogenic and viral gene promoters.\n\nTheoretical simulations on the antioxidant mechanism of naturally occurring flavonoid: A DFT approach\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPraveena, R.; Sadasivam, K.\n\nSynthetic antioxidants such as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) are found to be toxic, hence non-carcinogenic naturally occurring radical scavengers especially flavonoids have gained considerable importance in the past two decades. In the present investigation, the radical scavenging activity of C-glycosyl flavonoids is evaluated using theoretical approach which could broaden its scope in therapeutic applications. Gas and solvent phase studies of structural and molecular characteristics of C-glycosyl flavonoid, isovitexin is investigated through hydrogen atom transfer mechanism (HAT), Electron transfer-proton transfer (ETâPT) and Sequential proton loss electron transfer (SPLET) by Density functional theory (DFT) using hybrid parameters. The computedmoreÂ Â» values of the adiabatic ionization potential, electron affinity, hardness, softness, electronegativity and electrophilic index indicate that isovitexin possess good radical scavenging activity. The behavior of different âOH groups in polyphenolic compounds is assessed by considering electronic effects of the neighbouring groups and the overall geometry of molecule which in turn helps in analyzing the antioxidant capacity of the polyphenolic molecule. The studies indicate that the Hâatom abstraction from 4ââOH site is preferred during the radical scavenging process. From Mulliken spin density analysis and FMOs, Bâring is found to be more delocalized center and capable of electron donation. Comparison of antioxidant activity of vitexin and isovitexin leads to the conclusion that isovitexin acts as a better radical scavenger. This is an evidence for the importance of position of glucose unit in the flavonoid.Â«Â less\n\nModulation of sickle cell crisis by naturally occurring band 3 specific antibodies -- a malaria link.\n\nPubMed\n\nKennedy, James Randall\n\n2002-05-01\n\nThis paper's focus is prevention of sickle cell adhesion resulting from the erythrocyte's prematurely denatured hemoglobin. This denatured hemoglobin causes a molecule called band 3 to cluster on the erythrocyte's surface and adhere to the CD36 molecule located on the microvascular endothelium. Natural antibodies recognize these clusters on senescent erythrocytes and prevent their endothelial adhesion and target them for reticuloendothelial elimination. Band 3 is also displayed on the erythrocytes of individuals with falciparum malaria and the vaso-occlusive pathology in these patients is prevented in individuals with sickle trait. The hypothesis is that prematurely denatured sickle hemoglobin results in an up regulation of natural antibodies which control erythrocyte adhesion in both malaria and sickle cell disease.\n\nPlants and their active compounds: natural molecules to target angiogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nLu, Kai; Bhat, Madhavi; Basu, Sujit\n\n2016-07-01\n\nAngiogenesis, or new blood vessel formation, is an important process in the pathogenesis of several diseases and thus has been targeted for the prevention and treatment for many disorders. However, the anti-angiogenic agents that are currently in use are mainly synthetic compounds and humanized monoclonal antibodies, which are either expensive or toxic, thereby limiting their use in many patients. Therefore, it is necessary to identify less toxic, inexpensive, novel and effective anti-angiogenic molecules. Several studies have indicated that natural plant products can meet these criteria. In this review, we discuss the anti-angiogenic properties of natural compounds isolated from plants and the molecular mechanisms by which these molecules act. Finally, we summarize the advantages of using plant products as anti-angiogenic agents. Compared with currently available anti-angiogenic drugs, plant products may not only have similar therapeutic potential but are also inexpensive, less toxic, and easy to administer. However, novel and effective strategies are necessary to improve their bioavailability for clinical use.\n\nBioassay of naturally occurring allelochemicals for phytotoxicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeather, G R; Einhellig, F A\n\n1988-10-01\n\nThe bioassay has been one of the most widely used tests to demonstrate allelopathic activity. Often, claims that a particular plant species inhibits the growth of another are based entirely on the seed germination response to solvent extracts of the suspected allelopathic plant; few of these tests are of value in demonstrating allelopathy under natural conditions. The veracity of the bioassay for evaluating naturally occurring compounds for phytotoxicity depends upon the physiological and biochemical response capacity of the bioassay organism and the mechanism(s) of action of the allelochemicals. The possibility that more than one allelochemical, acting in concert at very low concentrations, may be responsible for an observed allelopathic effect makes it imperative that bioassays be extremely sensitive to chemical growth perturbation agents. Among the many measures of phytotoxicity of allelochemicals, the inhibition (or stimulation) of seed germination, radicle elongation, and/or seedling growth have been the parameters of choice for most investigations. Few of these assays have been selected with the view towards the possible mechanism of the allelopathic effect.\n\nRadiological protection in North American naturally occurring radioactive material industries.\n\nPubMed\n\nChambers, D B\n\n2015-06-01\n\nAll soils and rocks contain naturally occurring radioactive material (NORM). Many ores and raw materials contain relatively high levels of natural radionuclides, and processing such materials can further increase the concentrations of natural radionuclides, sometimes referred to as 'technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive material' (TENORM). Examples of NORM minerals include uranium ores, monazite (a source of rare earth minerals), and phosphate rock used to produce phosphate fertiliser. Such activities have the potential to result in above background radiation exposure to workers and the public. The objective of this paper is to review the sources and exposure from NORM in North American industries, and provide a perspective on the potential radiological hazards to workers and the environment. Proper consideration of NORM issues is important and needs to be integrated in the assessment of these projects. Concerns over radioactivity and radiation amongst non-governmental organisations and the local public have resulted in the cancellation of NORM mining and mineral extraction projects, as well as inhibition of the safe use of by-product materials from various NORM industries. This paper also briefly comments on the current regulatory framework for NORM (TENORM) in Canada and the USA, as well as the potential implications of the recent activities of the International Commission on Radiological Protection for NORM industries.

J.; Diaz, Carlos; Echevarria, Lorenzo; HernÃ¡ndez, Florencio E.\n\n2013-09-01\n\nWe report on the theoretical-experimental analysis of the two-photon absorption (TPA) and two-photon circular-linear dichroism (TPCLD) spectra of (1E,6E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione (curcumin) in Tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution. The measurement of the full TPA spectrum of this molecule reveals a maximum TPA cross-section at 740 nm, i.e. more than 10 times larger than the maximum reported in the literature at 800 nm for the application of curcumin in bioimaging. The TPCLD spectrum exposes the symmetry of the main excited-states involved in the two-photon excitation process. TD-DFT calculations support the experimental results. These outcomes are expected to expand the application of natural-occurring dyes in bioimaging.\n\nLong-Term Toxicity of Naturally Occurring Asbestos in Male Fischer 344 Rats\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nNaturally occurring asbestos (NOA) fibers are found in geologic deposits that may be disturbed by mining, earthworks, or natural processes, resulting in adverse health risks to exposed individuals.

The materials used to prepare wound dressings include natural and synthetic polymers, as well as their combinations, in the forms of films, sponges and hydrogels. Polysaccharides are naturally-occurring polymers that have been extensively used as wound dressing materials. Homopolysaccharides are a class of polysaccharides consist of only one type of monosaccharide. The current review intends to overview the studies in which wound dressings from naturally-occurring polymers, based on homopolysaccharides, were prepared and evaluated. Homopolysaccharides such as cellulose, chitosan, chitin, pullulan, starch and Î²-glucan were considered. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Bulls identify cows in oestrus by oestrous-specific odours especially in urine and vaginal fluid. These have been used to train dogs to detect cows in heat. To improve and simplify the dog training, a spray containing synthetic oestrous molecules was developed. The objective of this study was to test the spray on similarities to the natural substance thus to assess its suitability as a training substance for heat detection dogs. Ten privately owned dogs of various breeds were trained. Dogs should be trained either to differentiate natural vaginal fluid from cows in oestrus and dioestrus (nÂ =Â 5), or spray with or without synthetic oestrous molecules (nÂ =Â 5). Dogs trained on natural fluid and on spray could detect the oestrous odour they had been trained on with an overall accuracy of 69.0% and 82.4%, respectively (pÂ =Â 0.019). To validate the synthetic molecules, dogs trained with synthetic molecules had to detect oestrous odour in natural fluid without further training (accuracy 37.6%). Dogs trained on natural fluid detected the synthetic molecules with an accuracy of 50.0% (50% vs 37.4%, pÂ <Â 0.05). Dogs can recognize natural vaginal fluid from cows in oestrus after they have been trained with synthetic oestrous molecules, but accuracy needs to be improved.

We report the site-selective azidation of benzylic and aliphatic CâH bonds in complex molecules catalyzed by the combination of Fe(OAc)2 and a PyBox ligand. The same system also catalyzes the trifluoromethyl azidation of olefins to form derivatives of natural products containing both fluorine atoms and azides. In general, both reactions tolerate a wide range of functional groups and occur with predictable regioselectivity. Azides obtained by functionalization of CâH and C=C bonds were converted to the corresponding amines, amides, and triazoles, thus providing a wide variety of nitrogen-containing complex molecules.

Certain extractive industries such as mining and oil logging have the potential to increase the risk of radiation exposure to the environment and humans by concentrating the quantities of naturally occurring radiation beyond normal background levels (Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli 2004).\n\nSubject Reaction to Human-Caused and Naturally-Occurring Radioactive Threat.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nBelford, Susan; Gibbs, Margaret\n\nWhile research has shown that people are adversely psychologically affected by knowledge that their communities have been toxically contaminated, it has been suggested that those who see a disaster as naturally occurring tend to be less adversely affected than those who see a disaster as caused by human acts.

However, to date their clinical use is limited by the side effects elicited by systemic administration. Extracellular vesicles are endogenous nanosized-carriers that have been recently introduced as a natural delivery system for therapeutic molecules. We have recently shown the ability of human exosomes to deliver photodynamic molecules. Therefore, this review focussed on extracellular vesicles as a novel strategy for the delivery of photodynamic molecules at cancer sites. This completely new approach may enhance the delivery and decrease the toxicity of photodynamic molecules, therefore, represent the future for photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment.\n\nNatural gas hydrates; vast resource, uncertain future\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nCollett, T.S.\n\n2001-01-01\n\nGas hydrates are naturally occurring icelike solids in which water molecules trap gas molecules in a cagelike structure known as a clathrate. Although many gases form hydrates in nature, methane hydrate is by far the most common; methane is the most abundant natural gas. The volume of carbon contained in methane hydrates worldwide is estimated to be twice the amount contained in all fossil fuels on Earth, including coal.\n\nPrediction of rodent carcinogenic potential of naturally occurring chemicals in the human diet using high-throughput QSAR predictive modeling\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nValerio, Luis G.; Arvidson, Kirk B.; Chanderbhan, Ronald F.\n\n2007-07-01\n\nchemicals, comprised primarily of pharmaceutical, industrial and some natural products developed under an FDA-MDL cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA). The predictive performance for this group of dietary natural products and the control group was 97% sensitivity and 80% concordance. Specificity was marginal at 53%. This study finds that the in silico QSAR analysis employing this software's rodent carcinogenicity database is capable of identifying the rodent carcinogenic potential of naturally occurring organic molecules found in the human diet with a high degree of sensitivity. It is the first study to demonstrate successful QSAR predictive modeling of naturally occurring carcinogens found in the human diet using an external validation test. Further test validation of this software and expansion of the training data set for dietary chemicals will help to support the future use of such QSAR methods for screening and prioritizing the risk of dietary chemicals when actual animal data are inadequate, equivocal, or absent.Â«Â less\n\nSearch for Varying Constants of Nature from Astronomical Observation of Molecules\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nUbachs, Wim\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe status of searches for possible variation in the constants of nature from astronomical observation of molecules is reviewed, focusing on the dimensionless constant representing the proton-electron mass ratio Î¼ =mp/me. The optical detection of H2 and CO molecules with large ground-based telescopes (as the ESO-VLT and the Keck telescopes), as well as the detection of H2 with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope is discussed in the context of varying constants, and in connection to different theoretical scenarios. Radio astronomy provides an alternative search strategy bearing the advantage that molecules as NH3 (ammonia) and CH3OH (methanol) can be used, which are much more sensitive to a varying Î¼ than diatomic molecules. Current constraints are |Î Î¼ /Î¼ | < 5 Ã 10^{-6} for redshift z=2.0-4.2, corresponding to look-back times of 10-12.5 Gyrs, and |Î Î¼ / Î¼ | < 1.5 Ã 10^{-7} for z=0.88, corresponding to half the age of the Universe (both at 3Ï statistical significance). Existing bottlenecks and prospects for future improvement with novel instrumentation are discussed.\n\nThermoradiation inactivation of naturally occurring organisms in soil\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nReynolds, M. C.; Lindell, K. F.; David, T. J.\n\n1973-01-01\n\nSamples of soil collected from Kennedy Space Center near spacecraft assembly facilities were found to contain microorganisms very resistant to conventional sterilization techniques. The inactivation behavior of the naturally occurring spores in soil was investigated using dry heat and ionizing radiation, first separately, then in combination. Dry heat inactivation rates of spores were determined for 105 and 125 C. Radiation inactivation rates were determined for dose rates of 660 and 76 krad/hr at 25 C. Simultaneous combinations of heat and radiation were then investigated at 105, 110, 115, 120, and 125 C. Combined treatment was found to be highly synergistic requiring greatly reduced radiation doses to accomplish sterilization.\n\nChemoinformatic Analysis of Combinatorial Libraries, Drugs, Natural Products and Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSingh, Narender; Guha, Rajarshi; Giulianotti, Marc; Pinilla, Clemencia; Houghten, Richard; Medina-Franco, Jose L.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nA multiple criteria approach is presented, that is used to perform a comparative analysis of four recently developed combinatorial libraries to drugs, Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) and natural products. The compound databases were assessed in terms of physicochemical properties, scaffolds and fingerprints. The approach enables the analysis of property space coverage, degree of overlap between collections, scaffold and structural diversity and overall structural novelty. The degree of overlap between combinatorial libraries and drugs was assessed using the R-NN curve methodology, which measures the density of chemical space around a query molecule embedded in the chemical space of a target collection. The combinatorial libraries studied in this work exhibit scaffolds that were not observed in the drug, MLSMR and natural products collections. The fingerprint-based comparisons indicate that these combinatorial libraries are structurally different to current drugs. The R-NN curve methodology revealed that a proportion of molecules in the combinatorial libraries are located within the property space of the drugs. However, the R-NN analysis also showed that there are a significant number of molecules in several combinatorial libraries that are located in sparse regions of the drug space.

The replacement of one or more oxygen atoms in a steroid or terpenoid molecule by a heteroatom affects the chemical properties of that particular steroid or terpenoid, and that replacement often results in alterations of its biological properties, which is sometimes valuable. One possible modification is the thionation that could have some influence on such activity. Among the various thionating reagents, Lawesson's reagent was found to be most suitable and showed versatile properties, including chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance. In this review, we present the role of Lawesson's reagent in the synthesis of thioanalogues of natural steroids and terpenoids.\n\nThe Formation of Chimeric Nanomorphologies, as a Reflection of Naturally Occurring Thermodynamic Processes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNaziris, N.; Demetzos, C.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe self-assembly process of different in nature biomaterials leads to the morphogenesis of various nano-structures, where the individual molecule properties (e.g. hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic balance and elasticity), profoundly affect the intermediate surfacesâ interfacial thermodynamics. Herein, the mixing of a phospholipid and an amphiphilic block copolymer, through the thin-film hydration method, gave different morphologies, among which there were vesicles (i.e. liposomes and polymersomes), micelles and worm-like structures. The formation of such variety of structures is attributed to divergent entropic pathways, which are determined by a number of parameters, such as the lipid:polymer molar ratio and the polymer composition. The developed nanosystems are considered as chimeric/mixed, because of the two different in type biomaterials that compose them. The vesicles also exhibited membrane âirregularitiesâ, which are connected with their biophysical behavior. Nature has âchosenâ vesicular forms to be the thermodynamically stable âbiological apartmentsâ, in which life was enclosed and additionally, vesicles provided compartmentalized systems, where the intracellular environment was built. Phospholipid properties result in membranes/bilayers that harmonically assimilate other molecules, like proteins and retain their integrity and functionality, while gaining additional features. A cause that alters this relationship might induce changes in the membrane composition and morphology, with respect to lipid rafts/domains, what has been linked with the activation and development of certain human disorders/diseases. The self-assembly of two different biomaterials into various structures that present distinct membrane phenomena is believed to simulate these natural processes.\n\nDetermination of naturally occurring radionuclides in soil samples of Ayranci, Turkey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAgar, Osman; Eke, Canel; Boztosun, Ismail; Emin Korkmaz, M.\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe specific activity, radiation hazard index and the annual effective dose of the naturally occurring radioactive elements (238U, 232Th and 40K) were determined in soil samples collected from 12 different locations in Ayranci region by using a NaI(Tl) gamma-ray spectrometer. The measured activity concentrations of the natural radionuclides in studied soil samples were compared with the corresponding results of different countries and the internationally reported values. From the analysis, it is found that these materials may be safely used as construction materials and do not pose significant radiation hazards.\n\nNatural small-molecule enhancers of autophagy induce autophagic cell death in apoptosis-defective cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaw, Betty Yuen Kwan; Chan, Wai Kit; Xu, Su Wei; Wang, Jing Rong; Bai, Li Ping; Liu, Liang; Wong, Vincent Kam Wai\n\n2014-07-01\n\nResistance of cancer cells to chemotherapy is a significant problem in oncology, and the development of sensitising agents or small-molecules with new mechanisms of action to kill these cells is needed. Autophagy is a cellular process responsible for the turnover of misfolded proteins or damaged organelles, and it also recycles nutrients to maintain energy levels for cell survival. In some apoptosis-resistant cancer cells, autophagy can also enhance the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs through autophagy-mediated mechanisms of cell death. Because the modulation of autophagic processes can be therapeutically useful to circumvent chemoresistance and enhance the effects of cancer treatment, the identification of novel autophagic enhancers for use in oncology is highly desirable. Many novel anti-cancer compounds have been isolated from natural products; therefore, we worked to discover natural, anti-cancer small-molecule enhancers of autophagy. Here, we have identified a group of natural alkaloid small-molecules that function as novel autophagic enhancers. These alkaloids, including liensinine, isoliensinine, dauricine and cepharanthine, stimulated AMPK-mTOR dependent induction of autophagy and autophagic cell death in a panel of apoptosis-resistant cells. Taken together, our work provides novel insights into the biological functions, mechanisms and potential therapeutic values of alkaloids for the induction of autophagy.\n\nPredicting Retention Times of Naturally Occurring Phenolic Compounds in Reversed-Phase Liquid Chromatography: A Quantitative Structure-Retention Relationship (QSRR) Approach\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAkbar, Jamshed; Iqbal, Shahid; Batool, Fozia; Karim, Abdul; Chan, Kim Wei\n\n2012-01-01\n\nQuantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRRs) have successfully been developed for naturally occurring phenolic compounds in a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (RPLC) system. A total of 1519 descriptors were calculated from the optimized structures of the molecules using MOPAC2009 and DRAGON softwares. The data set of 39 molecules was divided into training and external validation sets. For feature selection and mapping we used step-wise multiple linear regression (SMLR), unsupervised forward selection followed by step-wise multiple linear regression (UFS-SMLR) and artificial neural networks (ANN). Stable and robust models with significant predictive abilities in terms of validation statistics were obtained with negation of any chance correlation. ANN models were found better than remaining two approaches. HNar, IDM, Mp, GATS2v, DISP and 3D-MoRSE (signals 22, 28 and 32) descriptors based on van der Waals volume, electronegativity, mass and polarizability, at atomic level, were found to have significant effects on the retention times. The possible implications of these descriptors in RPLC have been discussed. All the models are proven to be quite able to predict the retention times of phenolic compounds and have shown remarkable validation, robustness, stability and predictive performance.

W.; Petersen, N. J.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nA strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in pure culture from the reservoir of a hospital mist therapy unit by an extinction-dilution technique; its natural distilled water environment was used as a growth and maintenance medium. After a single subculture on Trypticase soy agar, the strain showed a marked decrease in resistance to inactivation by acetic acid, glutaraldehyde, chlorine dioxide, and a quaternary ammonium compound when compared with naturally occurring cells grown in mist therapy unit water. The following factors were observed to affect the relative resistances of naturally occurring and subcultured cells of the P. aeruginosa strain: (i) temperature at which the cultures were incubated prior to exposure to disinfectants, (ii) growth phase of the cultures at the time of exposure to disinfectants, (iii) nature of the suspending menstruum for disinfectants, and (iv) exposure to fluorescent light during incubation of inocula prior to testing. The applied significance of these findings may alter the present concepts of disinfectant testing as well as routine control procedures in the hospital environment.

However, PCOS is also associated with other metabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and diabetes. There are few medications that are approved for the most common symptoms of PCOS, leading to the off-label use of medications that were approved for other indications. One of the most common medications being used off label for PCOS is metformin. Research of other effective therapeutic options has included the utility of inositol. A systematic literature search of PubMed was performed using the following combination of terms: 'PCOS', 'hyperandrogenism' 'inositol', 'natural molecules'. Only papers published between 2000 and 2016 were included in our analysis. The present review analyzes all aspects of the choice of natural molecules in the treatment of hyperandrogenism and metabolic disorders in PCOS women. The rationale underlying the use of inositols as a therapeutic application in PCOS derives from their activities as insulin mimetic agents and their salutary effects on metabolism and hyperandrogenism without side effects. In this review will discuss the role of a number of natural associations between inositol and different substances in the treatment of hyperandrogenic symptoms in PCOS women.\n\nSensitivity, child regulatory processes, and naturally occurring declines in antisocial behavior across childhood.\n\nPubMed\n\nBuck, Katharine Ann\n\n2014-12-01\n\nDespite considerable research on why antisocial behavior develops and interventions that reduce it, aspects of everyday family processes that may promote naturally occurring declines in antisocial behavior or that may result from such declines in most children without intervention are poorly understood. The current study explored family processes that may enable children to replace antisocial tendencies and the effects that declines in antisocial behavior may have on parenting and child regulatory processes. Longitudinal data from 1,022 children (54 months-6th grade) from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development were examined. Findings demonstrated that naturally occurring declines in antisocial behavior both predicted and were predicted by maternal sensitivity, emotion regulation, and social skills. These declines predicted but were not predicted by declines in hostile attributions.

Both synthetic muramyl dipeptide (MDP) and naturally occurring sleep factor (SF), which contains an MP structure, stimulate human monocytes to produce interleukin 1 (IL 1). IL 1 is a family of unique polypeptides that mediate a variety of host defense functions and possess several biological properties, many of which are shared with MPs. Endotoxins are potent inducers of IL 1, but polymyxin B, which blocks endotoxin's biological activities, has no effect on MP-induced IL 1 production. SF purified from human urine and SF isolated from the peritoneal fluid of patients undergoing chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) induce IL 1 when incubated with human mononuclear cells in vitro. SF from urine or CAPD fluid induces IL 1 production in the picrogram per milliliter range whereas synthetic MDP requires microgram per milliliter concentrations. Thus, both synthetic and naturally occurring MPs exert their biological effects, in part, by inducing IL 1.\n\nSundew adhesive: a naturally occurring hydrogel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHuang, Yujian; Wang, Yongzhong; Sun, Leming; Agrawal, Richa; Zhang, Mingjun\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBioadhesives have drawn increasing interest in recent years, owing to their eco-friendly, biocompatible and biodegradable nature. As a typical bioadhesive, sticky exudate observed on the stalked glands of sundew plants aids in the capture of insects and this viscoelastic adhesive has triggered extensive interests in revealing the implied adhesion mechanisms. Despite the significant progress that has been made, the structural traits of the sundew adhesive, especially the morphological characteristics in nanoscale, which may give rise to the viscous and elastic properties of this mucilage, remain unclear. Here, we show that the sundew adhesive is a naturally occurring hydrogel, consisting of nano-network architectures assembled with polysaccharides. The assembly process of the polysaccharides in this hydrogel is proposed to be driven by electrostatic interactions mediated with divalent cations. Negatively charged nanoparticles, with an average diameter of 231.9 Â± 14.8 nm, are also obtained from this hydrogel and these nanoparticles are presumed to exert vital roles in the assembly of the nano-networks. Further characterization via atomic force microscopy indicates that the stretching deformation of the sundew adhesive is associated with the flexibility of its fibrous architectures. It is also observed that the adhesion strength of the sundew adhesive is susceptible to low temperatures. Both elasticity and adhesion strength of the sundew adhesive reduce in response to lowering the ambient temperature. The feasibility of applying sundew adhesive for tissue engineering is subsequently explored in this study. Results show that the fibrous scaffolds obtained from sundew adhesive are capable of increasing the adhesion of multiple types of cells, including fibroblast cells and smooth muscle cells, a property that results from the enhanced adsorption of serum proteins. In addition, in light of the weak cytotoxic activity exhibited by these scaffolds towards a variety of\n\nNaturally occurring vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) Whisker growth of germanium sulfide\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nFinkelman, R.B.; Larson, R.R.; Dwornik, E.J.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nThe first naturally occurring terrestrial example of vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) growth has been observed in condensates from gases released by burning coal in culm banks. Scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and energy dispersive analysis indicate that the crystals consist of elongated rods (??? 100 ??m) of germanium sulfide capped by bulbs depleted in germanium. ?? 1974.\n\nPrevalence of lymphoplasmacytic synovitis in dogs with naturally occurring cranial cruciate ligament rupture.\n\nPubMed\n\nErne, Jay B; Goring, Robert L; Kennedy, Fidelma A; Schoenborn, William C\n\n2009-08-15\n\nTo determine the prevalence of lymphoplasmacytic synovitis (LPS) in dogs with naturally occurring cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) rupture and compare clinical, radiographic, cytologic, and histologic findings in dogs with and without LPS. Cross-sectional study. 110 dogs with naturally occurring CCL rupture. Histologic examination of synovial biopsy specimens obtained at the time of surgical treatment was used to identify dogs with LPS. Clinical, radiographic, cytologic, and histologic findings were compared between dogs with and without LPS. 56 (51%) dogs had histologic evidence of LPS. There were no significant differences in age, body weight, duration of lameness, severity of lameness, severity of radiographic signs of degenerative joint disease, extent of CCL rupture (partial vs complete), or gross appearance of the medial meniscus between dogs with and without LPS. Mean tibial plateau angle was significantly lower in dogs with LPS than in dogs without LPS, and dogs with LPS were significantly more likely to have neutrophils in their synovial fluid. Lymphocytes were seen in synovial fluid from a single dog with LPS. Results suggested that LPS was common in dogs with naturally occurring CCL rupture. However, only minor clinical, radiographic, cytologic, and histologic differences were identified between dogs with and without LPS.\n\nApplication of terahertz spectroscopy for characterization of biologically active organic molecules in natural environment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKaraliÅ«nas, Mindaugas; JakÅ¡tas, Vytautas; Nasser, Kinan E.; VenckeviÄius, Rimvydas; Urbanowicz, Andrzej; KaÅ¡alynas, Irmantas; ValuÅ¡is, Gintaras\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn this work, a comparative research of biologically active organic molecules in its natural environment using the terahertz (THz) time domain spectroscopy (TDS) and Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTS) systems is carried out. Absorption coefficient and refractive index of Nicotiana tabacum L. leaves containing nicotine, Cannabis sativa L. leaves containing tetrahydrocannabinol, and Humulu lupulus L. leaves containing Î±-acids, active organic molecules that obtain in natural environment, were measured in broad frequency range from 0.1 to 13 THz at room temperature. In the spectra of absorption coefficient the features were found to be unique for N. tabacum, C. sativa and H. lupulus. Moreover, those features can be exploited for identification of C. sativa sex and N. tabacum origin. The refractive index can be also used to characterize different species.\n\nChondroprotection using naturally occurring mineral supplementation formula in degenerative osteoarthritis of the knees.\n\nPubMed\n\nBansal, Himanshu; Bansal, Anupama; Agrawal, Diwaker; Singh, Dhananjay; Deb, Kaushik\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo evaluate the therapeutic and safety efficacy of a naturally occurring mineral supplementation in the treatment of symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA). A prospective, single centre, study of 50 patients aged 50 years and above with painful and radiological Osteoarthritis of knees was carried out for one year. Patients received 40 drops of naturally occurring commercially available mineral supplement concentrate mineral drops purportedly derived from the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Efficacy was objectively confirmed by evaluating changes in the thickness of articular cartilage, joint space width, synovial fluid analysis and subjectively by changes in WOMAC scores and 6 Minute pain-free Walking Distance. The composite WOMAC scores were significantly improved by 17.2 points from a mean of 52 at baseline by year end. 18 (41%) patients showed improvement of more than 100 feet for the pain free distance covered during a 6 minute walk at one year follow-up. Ultrasonologicaly, at one year cartilage thickness improved by at least 0.01 mm in 9 (21%) patients. Though radiologicallynone of patient showed increase in joint space it was noticed that only 2(4.6%) patients had decline of joint space width of more than 0.5 mm. Average cell count reduced to 205/microlitre from a value of 520/microlitre at the start of study suggesting that the mineral supplement used had structural efficacy. Clinically relevant, statistically significant symptomatic and statistically insignificant structural improvement occurred over 1 year period in patients receiving the naturally occurring mineral supplement. The protection of the joint cartilages from progressive degeneration during osteoarthritis by these supplements indicates towards a chondrocyte regenerative potential of this supplement. Such regeneration may occur through activation of tissue specific adult chondrocyte precursors or stem cells.\n\nOrganic synthesis: the art and science of replicating the molecules of living nature and creating others like them in the laboratory.\n\nPubMed\n\nNicolaou, K C\n\n2014-03-08\n\nSynthetic organic chemists have the power to replicate some of the most intriguing molecules of living nature in the laboratory and apply their developed synthetic strategies and technologies to construct variations of them.

When creatively interrogated, a diverse range of large, real-world data sets provides powerful diagnostic tools for revealing principles of human judgment, perception, categorization, decision-making, language use, inference, problem solving, and representation. Examples of these data sets include patterns of website links, dictionaries, logs of group interactions, collections of images and image tags, text corpora, history of financial transactions, trends in twitter tag usage and propagation, patents, consumer product sales, performance in high-stakes sporting events, dialect maps, and scientific citations. The goal of this issue is to present some exemplary case studies of mining naturally existing data sets to reveal important principles and phenomena in cognitive science, and to discuss some of the underlying issues involved with conducting traditional experiments, analyses of naturally occurring data, computational modeling, and the synthesis of all three methods.

They have effects which are potentially beneficial to heath, for example they are antioxidant, anticarcinogenic and antibacterial, as recently investigated in many fields such as medicine, food and plant sciences. The main drawbacks of these molecules are both low stability and bioavailability. In this research work the opportunity to graft GA to bioactive glasses is investigated, in order to deliver the undamaged biological molecule into the body, using the biomaterial surfaces as a localized carrier. GA was considered for functionalization since it is a good model molecule for polyphenols and presents several interesting biological activities, like antibacterial, antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties. Two different silica based bioactive glasses (SCNA and CEL2), with different reactivity, were employed as substrates. UV photometry combined with the Folin&Ciocalteu reagent was adopted to test the concentration of GA in uptake solution after functionalization. This test verified how much GA consumption occurred with surface modification and it was also used on solid samples to test the presence of GA on functionalized glasses. XPS and SEM-EDS techniques were employed to characterize the modification of material surface properties and functional group composition before and after functionalization.\n\nCorrected simulations for one-dimensional diffusion processes with naturally occurring boundaries.\n\nPubMed\n\nShafiey, Hassan; Gan, Xinjun; Waxman, David\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo simulate a diffusion process, a usual approach is to discretize the time in the associated stochastic differential equation. This is the approach used in the Euler method. In the present work we consider a one-dimensional diffusion process where the terms occurring, within the stochastic differential equation, prevent the process entering a region. The outcome is a naturally occurring boundary (which may be absorbing or reflecting). A complication occurs in a simulation of this situation. The term involving a random variable, within the discretized stochastic differential equation, may take a trajectory across the boundary into a \"forbidden region.\" The naive way of dealing with this problem, which we refer to as the \"standard\" approach, is simply to reset the trajectory to the boundary, based on the argument that crossing the boundary actually signifies achieving the boundary. In this work we show, within the framework of the Euler method, that such resetting introduces a spurious force into the original diffusion process. This force may have a significant influence on trajectories that come close to a boundary. We propose a corrected numerical scheme, for simulating one-dimensional diffusion processes with naturally occurring boundaries. This involves correcting the standard approach, so that an exact property of the diffusion process is precisely respected. As a consequence, the proposed scheme does not introduce a spurious force into the dynamics. We present numerical test cases, based on exactly soluble one-dimensional problems with one or two boundaries, which suggest that, for a given value of the discrete time step, the proposed scheme leads to substantially more accurate results than the standard approach. Alternatively, the standard approach needs considerably more computation time to obtain a comparable level of accuracy to the proposed scheme, because the standard approach requires a significantly smaller time step.\n\nCorrected simulations for one-dimensional diffusion processes with naturally occurring boundaries\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShafiey, Hassan; Gan, Xinjun; Waxman, David\n\n2017-11-01\n\nTo simulate a diffusion process, a usual approach is to discretize the time in the associated stochastic differential equation.

There are many regions in Alaska that have minerals in surface rocks that may contain asbestos and asbestos has been discovered in many locations in Alaska. Gravel is constantly in demand for heavy construction projects, but some remote localities in Alaska do not have gravel sources that are NOA-free. Determining if NOA can be safely used in heavy construction materials and what can or should be done with NOA materials that are already in place are complex questions. Answers will depend on the amount and type of asbestos mineral, how it is handled in processing, and how it is maintained - all subject to regulation and control of operations. The State of Alaska recently enacted legislation (HB 258) providing, among other things, \"â¦ immunity for the state and for landowners, extractors, suppliers, transporters, and contractors for certain actions or claims arising in connection with the use of gravel or aggregate material containing naturally occurring asbestos in certain areas.\" Implementation of the law and interim regulations and guidance should enable use of NOA for heavy construction materials in Alaska, but as with any new law, it will take some time to understand its full scope and effect.\n\nEffects of fire on naturally occurring blue oak (Quercus douglasii) saplings\n\nTreesearch\n\nTedmund J.

Herein, a symmetrical azobenzene-functionalized natural glycyrrhizic acid (trans-GAG) was synthesized and could form stable supramolecular gels in DMSO/H 2 O and MeOH/H 2 O. Owing to trans-cis isomerization, this gel exhibited typical light-responsive behavior that led to a reversible gel-sol transition accompanied by a variation in morphology and rheology. Additionally, this trans-GAG gel displayed a distinct injectable self-healing property and outstanding biocompatibility. This work provides a simple yet rational strategy to fabricate stimuli-responsive materials from naturally occurring, eco-friendly molecules. Â© 2018 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Naturally occurring phenolic and polyphenolic compounds, such as ferulic acid (FerAc), vanillic acid (VanAc), quercetin (Querc) and vitamin E (VitE), were introduced into PLA. The preliminary characterization of the systems formulated containing different amounts of natural stabilizers showed that all compounds used acted as plasticizers, leading to a decrease in rheological functions with respect to neat PLA, without significantly modifying the crystallinity of the raw material. The study of the thermo-oxidative behavior of neat PLA and PLA/natural compound systems, performed by spectrometric and thermal analyses, indicated that all stabilizers considered were able to exert a remarkable antioxidant action against thermo-oxidative phenomena. All natural compounds considered are thus proposed as ecofriendly stabilizers, to get fully bio-based polymer systems with enhanced thermo-oxidative stability, suitable for biomedical applications.\n\nDECIPHERING NATURALLY-OCCURRING PB CONTAMINATION IMPACTING DRINKING WATER WELLS: SHAKER VILLAGE CATCHMENT, MAINE.\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nTrace Pb concentrations in groundwater within glacial deposits across Maine fluctuate considerably.

Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) was utilized to quantify EOBr and TBr. The method was then applied to liver samples of tuna, albatross, and polar bear collected from remote marine locations. Polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), bromophenols (BRPs), hydroxylated (OH-) and methoxylated (MeO-) PBDEs were analyzed as identified EOBr. The majority of the bromine in these marine organisms was nonextractable or inorganic, with EOBr accounting for 10-28% of the TBr. Of the identified EOBr, in tuna and albatross, naturally occurring compounds, including MeO-PBDEs, OH-PBDEs, and BPRs, were prevalent. However, the identifiable EOBr in polar bears consisted primarily of synthetic compounds, including PBDEs and PBBs. Overall, 0.08-0.11% and 0.008-0.012% of EOBr and TBr, respectively, were identified. The proportion of EOBr that was identified in marine organisms was relatively small compared to the proportions for organofluorine and organochlorine compounds. This could be related to the great diversity of naturally occurring organobromine compounds in the environment. Naturally occurring brominated fatty acids were estimated to be the predominant compounds in the EOBr fraction.\n\nFinding the traces of behavioral and cognitive processes in big data and naturally occurring datasets.\n\nPubMed\n\nPaxton, Alexandra; Griffiths, Thomas L\n\n2017-10-01\n\nToday, people generate and store more data than ever before as they interact with both real and virtual environments. These digital traces of behavior and cognition offer cognitive scientists and psychologists an unprecedented opportunity to test theories outside the laboratory. Despite general excitement about big data and naturally occurring datasets among researchers, three \"gaps\" stand in the way of their wider adoption in theory-driven research: the imagination gap, the skills gap, and the culture gap. We outline an approach to bridging these three gaps while respecting our responsibilities to the public as participants in and consumers of the resulting research. To that end, we introduce Data on the Mind ( http://www.dataonthemind.org ), a community-focused initiative aimed at meeting the unprecedented challenges and opportunities of theory-driven research with big data and naturally occurring datasets. We argue that big data and naturally occurring datasets are most powerfully used to supplement-not supplant-traditional experimental paradigms in order to understand human behavior and cognition, and we highlight emerging ethical issues related to the collection, sharing, and use of these powerful datasets.\n\nThe evolution of standards for naturally occurring fluorides: an example of scientific due process.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nClark, N; Corbin, S\n\n1983-01-01\n\nIn three quarters of a century of observation and research, the effects of fluoride on dental caries and on general bodily health have been well documented. An expanding data base has allowed a firming up of the guidance and standards for appropriate and safe levels of naturally occurring fluorides for human consumption. Over time, through specific recommendations, the maximum fluoride concentrations deemed appropriate have been altered, but by a process of considered adjustment. Although the Public Health Service has been responsible for the formalization of many of the recommended standards, those recommendations have been based on research from many fronts. In the most recent reconsideration of the standards for natural fluoride, the most exhaustive and thoroughly documented review to date was done, incorporating review by representatives from State, Federal, and private programs. Although the specific example of the development of standards for natural fluoride is used, it should be illustrative of similar processes that are constantly underway in regard to substances and factors with a potential impact on the public's health. Expansion of the data base through research and scientific inquiry will lay the foundation for future reconsideration of the standards for naturally occurring fluorides.
