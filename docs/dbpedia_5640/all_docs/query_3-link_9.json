Frequently, the chemotactic activity of cytokines depends on a modified N-terminus of the polypeptide. Among those, the N-terminus of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (CCL2 and MCP-1) is modified to a pyroglutamate (pE-) residue protecting against degradation in vivo. Here, we show that the N-terminal pE-formation depends on glutaminyl cyclase activity. The pE-residue increases stability against N-terminal degradation by aminopeptidases and improves receptor activation and signal transduction in vitro. Genetic ablation of the glutaminyl cyclase iso-enzymes QC (QPCT) or isoQC (QPCTL) revealed a major role of isoQC for pE1-CCL2 formation and monocyte infiltration. Consistently, administration of QC-inhibitors in inflammatory models, such as thioglycollate-induced peritonitis reduced monocyte infiltration. The pharmacologic efficacy of QC/isoQC-inhibition was assessed in accelerated atherosclerosis in ApoE3*Leiden mice, showing attenuated atherosclerotic pathology following chronic oral treatment. Current strategies targeting CCL2 are mainly based on antibodies or spiegelmers. The application of small, orally available inhibitors of glutaminyl cyclases represents an alternative therapeutic strategy to treat CCL2-driven disorders such as atherosclerosis/restenosis and fibrosis.

Diffraction data have been collected at ESRF beamline BM14 and processed to 1.7 Ã resolution. In living systems, the intramolecular cyclization of N-terminal glutamine residues is accomplished by glutaminyl cyclase enzymes (EC 2.3.2.5). While in mammals these enzymes are involved in the synthesis of hormonal and neurotransmitter peptides, the physiological role played by the corresponding plant enzymes still remains to be unravelled. Papaya glutaminyl cyclase (PQC), a 33 kDa enzyme found in the latex of the tropical tree Carica papaya, displays an exceptional resistance tomoreÂ Â» chemical and thermal denaturation as well as to proteolysis. In order to elucidate its enzymatic mechanism and to gain insights into the structural determinants underlying its remarkable stability, PQC was isolated from papaya latex, purified and crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P2{sub 1}2{sub 1}2{sub 1}, with unit-cell parameters a = 62.82, b = 81.23, c = 108.17 Ã and two molecules per asymmetric unit.

The hallmark of this principle is the prevention of the formation of Abeta(3,11(pE)-40,42), as these Abeta-species were shown to be of elevated neurotoxicity and likely to act as a seeding core leading to an accelerated formation of Abeta-oligomers and fibrils. Starting from 1-(3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)propyl)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)thiourea, bioisosteric replacements led to the development of new classes of inhibitors. The optimization of the metal-binding group was achieved by homology modeling and afforded a first insight into the probable binding mode of the inhibitors in the hQC active site. The efficacy assessment of the hQC inhibitors was performed in cell culture, directly monitoring the inhibition of Abeta(3,11(pE)-40,42) formation.\n\nDiscovery of Potent Human Glutaminyl Cyclase Inhibitors as Anti-Alzheimer's Agents Based on Rational Design.\n\nPubMed\n\nHoang, Van-Hai; Tran, Phuong-Thao; Cui, Minghua; Ngo, Van T H; Ann, Jihyae; Park, Jongmi; Lee, Jiyoun; Choi, Kwanghyun; Cho, Hanyang; Kim, Hee; Ha, Hee-Jin; Hong, Hyun-Seok; Choi, Sun; Kim, Young-Ho; Lee, Jeewoo\n\n2017-03-23\n\nGlutaminyl cyclase (QC) has been implicated in the formation of toxic amyloid plaques by generating the N-terminal pyroglutamate of Î²-amyloid peptides (pGlu-AÎ²) and thus may participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We designed a library of glutamyl cyclase (QC) inhibitors based on the proposed binding mode of the preferred substrate, AÎ² 3E-42 . An in vitro structure-activity relationship study identified several excellent QC inhibitors demonstrating 5- to 40-fold increases in potency compared to a known QC inhibitor. When tested in mouse models of AD, compound 212 significantly reduced the brain concentrations of pyroform AÎ² and total AÎ² and restored cognitive functions. This potent AÎ²-lowering effect was achieved by incorporating an additional binding region into our previously established pharmacophoric model, resulting in strong interactions with the carboxylate group of Glu327 in the QC binding site. Our study offers useful insights in designing novel QC inhibitors as a potential treatment option for AD.\n\nIdentification of Glutaminyl Cyclase Genes Involved in Pyroglutamate Modification of Fungal Lignocellulolytic Enzymes.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Vincent W; Dana, Craig M; Iavarone, Anthony T; Clark, Douglas S; Glass, N Louise\n\n2017-01-17\n\nThe breakdown of plant biomass to simple sugars is essential for the production of second-generation biofuels and high-value bioproducts.

Pyroglutamate modification is the post-translational conversion of N-terminal glutamine or glutamate into a cyclized amino acid derivative. This modification is well studied in animal systems but poorly explored in fungal systems. In Neurospora crassa, we show that this modification takes place in the ER and is catalyzed by two well-conserved enzymes, ubiquitously conserved throughout the fungal kingdom.

Recently, a glutaminyl cyclase (QC) inhibitor, PBD150, was shown to be able to reduce the deposition of pyroglutamate-modified amyloid-Î² peptides in brain of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease, leading to a significant improvement of learning and memory in those transgenic animals. Here, we report the 1.05â1.40 â« resolution structures, solved by the sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing method, of the Golgi-luminal catalytic domain of the recently identified Golgi-resident QC (gQC) and its complex with PBD150.

Upon binding to PBD150, a large loop movement in gQC allows the inhibitor to be tightly held in its active site primarily by hydrophobic interactions. Further comparisons of the inhibitor-bound structures revealed distinct interactions of the inhibitors with gQC and sQC, which are consistent with the results from our inhibitor assays reported here. Because gQC and sQC may play different biological roles in vivo, the different inhibitor binding modes allow the design of specific inhibitors toward gQC and sQC.

QCs may be classified in two groups containing, respectively, the mammalian enzymes, and the enzymes from plants, bacteria, and parasites. The crystal structure of the QC from the latex of Carica papaya (PQC) has been determined at 1.7A resolution. The structure was solved by the single wavelength anomalous diffraction technique using sulfur and zinc as anomalous scatterers. The enzyme folds into a five-bladed beta-propeller, with two additional alpha-helices and one beta hairpin. The propeller closure is achieved via an original molecular velcro, which links the last two blades into a large eight stranded beta-sheet. The zinc ion present in the PQC is bound via an octahedral coordination into an elongated cavity located along the pseudo 5-fold axis of the beta-propeller fold. This zinc ion presumably plays a structural role and may contribute to the exceptional stability of PQC, along with an extended hydrophobic packing, the absence of long loops, the three-joint molecular velcro and the overall folding itself. Multiple sequence alignments combined with structural analyses have allowed us to tentatively locate the active site, which is filled in the crystal structure either by a Tris molecule or an acetate ion. These analyses are further supported by the experimental evidence that Tris is a competitive inhibitor of PQC. The active site is located at the C-terminal entrance of the PQC central tunnel. W83, W110, W169, Q24, E69, N155, K225, F22 and F67 are highly conserved residues in the C-terminal entrance, and their putative role in catalysis is discussed. The PQC structure is representative of the plants, bacterial and parasite enzymes and contrasts with that of mammalian enzymes, that may possibly share a conserved scaffold of the bacterial aminopeptidase.\n\nLinked Production of Pyroglutamate-Modified Proteins via Self-Cleavage of Fusion Tags with TEV Protease and Autonomous N-Terminal Cyclization with Glutaminyl Cyclase In Vivo\n\nPubMed Central\n\nShih, Yan-Ping; Chou, Chi-Chi; Chen, Yi-Ling; Huang, Kai-Fa; Wang, Andrew H.- J.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOverproduction of N-terminal pyroglutamate (pGlu)-modified proteins utilizing Escherichia coli or eukaryotic cells is a challenging work owing to the fact that the recombinant proteins need to be recovered by proteolytic removal of fusion tags to expose the N-terminal glutaminyl or glutamyl residue, which is then converted into pGlu catalyzed by the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase. Herein we describe a new method for production of N-terminal pGlu-containing proteins in vivo via intracellular self-cleavage of fusion tags by tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease and then immediate N-terminal cyclization of passenger target proteins by a bacterial glutaminyl cyclase. To combine with the sticky-end PCR cloning strategy, this design allows the gene of target proteins to be efficiently inserted into the expression vector using two unique cloning sites (i.e., SnaB I and Xho I), and the soluble and N-terminal pGlu-containing proteins are then produced in vivo. Our method has been successfully applied to the production of pGlu-modified enhanced green fluorescence protein and monocyte chemoattractant proteins. This design will facilitate the production of protein drugs and drug target proteins that possess an N-terminal pGlu residue required for their physiological activities.

The inhibition of hQC prevents of the formation of the AÎ²3(pE)-40,42 species which were shown to be of elevated neurotoxicity and are likely to act as a seeding core, leading to an accelerated formation of AÎ²-oligomers and fibrils. This work presents a new class of inhibitors of hQC, resulting from a pharmacophore-based screen. Hit molecules were identified, containing benzimidazole as the metal binding group connected to 1,3,4-oxadiazole as the central scaffold. The subsequent optimization resulted in benzimidazolyl-1,3,4-thiadiazoles and -1,2,3-triazoles with an inhibitory potency in the nanomolar range. Further investigation into the potential binding mode of the new compound classes combined molecular docking and site directed mutagenesis studies.\n\nA conserved hydrogen-bond network in the catalytic centre of animal glutaminyl cyclases is critical for catalysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Kai-Fa; Wang, Yu-Ruei; Chang, En-Cheng; Chou, Tsung-Lin; Wang, Andrew H-J\n\n2008-04-01\n\nQCs (glutaminyl cyclases; glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferases, EC 2.3.2.5) catalyse N-terminal pyroglutamate formation in numerous bioactive peptides and proteins. The enzymes were reported to be involved in several pathological conditions such as amyloidotic disease, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis and melanoma. The crystal structure of human QC revealed an unusual H-bond (hydrogen-bond) network in the active site, formed by several highly conserved residues (Ser(160), Glu(201), Asp(248), Asp(305) and His(319)), within which Glu(201) and Asp(248) were found to bind to substrate. In the present study we combined steady-state enzyme kinetic and X-ray structural analyses of 11 single-mutation human QCs to investigate the roles of the H-bond network in catalysis. Our results showed that disrupting one or both of the central H-bonds, i.e., Glu(201)...Asp(305) and Asp(248)...Asp(305), reduced the steady-state catalysis dramatically. The roles of these two COOH...COOH bonds on catalysis could be partly replaced by COOH...water bonds, but not by COOH...CONH(2) bonds, reminiscent of the low-barrier Asp...Asp H-bond in the active site of pepsin-like aspartic peptidases. Mutations on Asp(305), a residue located at the centre of the H-bond network, raised the K(m) value of the enzyme by 4.4-19-fold, but decreased the k(cat) value by 79-2842-fold, indicating that Asp(305) primarily plays a catalytic role. In addition, results from mutational studies on Ser(160) and His(319) suggest that these two residues might help to stabilize the conformations of Asp(248) and Asp(305) respectively. These data allow us to propose an essential proton transfer between Glu(201), Asp(305) and Asp(248) during the catalysis by animal QCs.\n\nMolecular Characterization of Tick Salivary Gland Glutaminyl Cyclase\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAdamson, Steven W.; Browning, Rebecca E.; Chao, Chien-Chung; Bateman, Robert C.; Ching, Wei-Mei; Karim, Shahid\n\n2013-01-01\n\nGlutaminyl cyclase (QC) catalyzes the cyclization of N-terminal glutamine residues into pyroglutamate. This post-translational modification extends the half-life of peptides and, in some cases, is essential in binding to their cognate receptor. Due to its potential role in the post-translational modification of tick neuropeptides, we report the molecular, biochemical and physiological characterization of salivary gland QC during the prolonged blood-feeding of the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) and the gulf-coast tick (Amblyomma maculatum). QC sequences from I. scapularis and A. maculatum showed a high degree of amino acid identity to each other and other arthropods and residues critical for zinc-binding/catalysis (D159, E202, and H330) or intermediate stabilization (E201, W207, D248, D305, F325, and W329) are conserved. Analysis of QC transcriptional gene expression kinetics depicts an upregulation during the blood-meal of adult female ticks prior to fast feeding phases in both I. scapularis and A. maculatum suggesting a functional link with blood meal uptake. QC enzymatic activity was detected in saliva and extracts of tick salivary glands and midguts. Recombinant QC was shown to be catalytically active. Furthermore, knockdown of QC-transcript by RNA interference resulted in lower enzymatic activity, and small, unviable egg masses in both studied tick species as well as lower engorged tick weights for I. scapularis. These results suggest that the post-translational modification of neurotransmitters and other bioactive peptides by QC is critical to oviposition and potentially other physiological processes. Moreover, these data suggest that tick-specific QC-modified neurotransmitters/hormones or other relevant parts of this system could potentially be used as novel physiological targets for tick control.

Hypothalamic pGlu hormones, such as thyrotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone are essential for regulation of metabolism and fertility in the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid and gonadal axes, respectively. Here, we analyzed the consequences of constitutive genetic QC ablation on endocrine functions and on the behavior of adult mice. Adult homozygous QC knock-out mice are fertile and behave indistinguishably from wild type mice in tests of motor function, cognition, general activity, and ingestion behavior. The QC knock-out results in a dramatic drop of enzyme activity in the brain, especially in hypothalamus and in plasma. Other peripheral organs like liver and spleen still contain QC activity, which is most likely caused by its homolog isoQC. The serum gonadotropin-releasing hormone, TSH, and testosterone concentrations were not changed by QC depletion. The serum thyroxine was decreased by 24% in homozygous QC knock-out animals, suggesting a mild hypothyroidism. QC knock-out mice were indistinguishable from wild type with regard to blood glucose and glucose tolerance, thus differing from reports of thyrotropin-releasing hormone knock-out mice significantly. The results suggest a significant formation of the hypothalamic pGlu hormones by alternative mechanisms, like spontaneous cyclization or conversion by isoQC. The different effects of QC depletion on the hypothalamic pituitary thyroid and gonadal axes might indicate slightly different modes of substrate conversion of both enzymes. The absence of significant abnormalities in QC knock-out mice suggests the presence of a therapeutic window for suppression of QC activity in current drug development.

The resulting fragment library (204 compounds) was acquired from commercial suppliers and pre-screened by differential scanning fluorimetry followed by functional in vitro assays. In this way, 10 fragment hits were identified ([Formula: see text]5Â % hit rate, best inhibitory activity: 16 [Formula: see text]). The in vitro hits were then docked to the active site of QC, and the best scoring compounds were analyzed for binding interactions. Two fragments bound to different regions in a complementary manner, and thus, linking those fragments offered a rational strategy to generate novel QC inhibitors. Based on the structure of the virtual linked fragment, a 77-membered QC target focused library was selected from vendor databases and docked to the active site of QC. A PubChem search confirmed that the best scoring analogues are novel, potential QC inhibitors.\n\nEvolution and the Distribution of Glutaminyl and Asparaginyl Residues in Proteins\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRobinson, Arthur B.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nRecent experiments on the deamidation of glutaminyl and asparaginyl residues in peptides and proteins support the hypothesis that these residues may serve as molecular clocks that control biological processes. A hypothesis is now offered that suggests that these molecular clocks are set by rejection or accumulation of appropriate sequences of residues including a glutaminyl or asparaginyl residue during evolution.

N.; Baenziger, Nancy Lewis; Chase, Lewis R.; Majerus, Philip W.\n\n1972-01-01\n\nWashed human platelets were incubated with 0.1-1.0 U/ml human thrombin and the effects on adenyl cyclase activity and on a platelet membrane protein (designated thrombin-sensitive protein) were studied. Adenyl cyclase activity was decreased 70-90% when intact platelets were incubated with thrombin. The TÂ½ for loss of adenyl cyclase activity was less than 15 sec at 1 U/ml thrombin. There was no decrease of adenyl cyclase activity when sonicated platelets or isolated membranes were incubated with these concentrations of thrombin. Loss of adenyl cyclase activity was relatively specific since the activities of other platelet membrane enzymes were unaffected by thrombin. Prior incubation of platelets with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), prostaglandin E1, or theophylline protected adenyl cyclase from inhibition by thrombin. Incubation of intact but not disrupted platelets with thrombin resulted in the release of thrombin-sensitive protein from the platelet membrane. The rapid release of this protein (TÂ½ < 15 sec) at low concentrations of thrombin suggested that removal of thrombin-sensitive protein from the platelet membrane is an integral part of the platelet release reaction. This hypothesis is supported by the parallel effects of thrombin on adenyl cyclase activity and thrombin-sensitive protein release in the presence of dibutyryl cyclic AMP, prostaglandin E1, and theophylline at varying concentrations of thrombin.

Human FMN cyclase, which splits FAD and other ribonucleoside diphosphate-X compounds to ribonucleoside monophosphate and cyclic X-phosphodiester, is identical to a DAK-encoded dihydroxyacetone kinase. This bifunctional protein was identified as triokinase. It was modeled as a homodimer of two-domain (K and L) subunits. Active centers lie between K1 and L2 or K2 and L1: dihydroxyacetone binds K and ATP binds L in different subunits too distant (â14 â«) for phosphoryl transfer. FAD docked to the ATP site with ribityl 4â²-OH in a possible near-attack conformation for cyclase activity. Reciprocal inhibition between kinase and cyclase reactants confirmed substrate site locations. The differential roles of protein domains were supported by their individual expression: K was inactive, and L displayed cyclase but not kinase activity. The importance of domain mobility for the kinase activity of dimeric triokinase was highlighted by molecular dynamics simulations: ATP approached dihydroxyacetone at distances below 5 â« in near-attack conformation. Based upon structure, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations, relevant residues were mutated to alanine, and kcat and Km were assayed whenever kinase and/or cyclase activity was conserved. The results supported the roles of Thr112 (hydrogen bonding of ATP adenine to K in the closed active center), His221 (covalent anchoring of dihydroxyacetone to K), Asp401 and Asp403 (metal coordination to L), and Asp556 (hydrogen bonding of ATP or FAD ribose to L domain). Interestingly, the His221 point mutant acted specifically as a cyclase without kinase activity.

A number of age-related changes have been reported in the catecholamine-adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase system. Most of the data available on these alterations come from resting subjects; the response to acute stress may provide additional insights into the age effect on these responses. 2. We measured supine and 10 min upright plasma noradrenaline and lymphocyte adenylate cyclase activity in ten healthy elderly subjects (age 66-80 years) and seven healthy young subjects (age 27-34 years). 3. Isoprenaline stimulation of lymphocyte adenylate cyclase activity was not significantly different between supine and upright positions or between elderly and young subjects. There was a marked increase in forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the upright posture in both elderly and young subjects. The increment over supine levels was 70% in the elderly (P less than 0.025) and 73% in the young (P less than 0.05). This enhanced forskolin activity was not seen in two young subjects who became syncopal. 4. These data suggest that enhanced forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity occurs after 10 min of upright posture in both elderly and young subjects, and may be relevant to immediate blood pressure regulation. We were unable to demonstrate any age-related differences in these acute adrenergic responses.\n\nThe guanylyl cyclase family at Y2K.\n\nPubMed\n\nWedel, B; Garbers, D\n\n2001-01-01\n\nDuring the 1980s the purification, cloning, and expression of various forms of guanylyl cyclase (GC) revealed that they served as receptors for extracellular signals. Seven membrane forms, which presumably exist as homodimers, and four subunits of apparent heterodimers (commonly referred to as the soluble forms) are known, but in animals such as nematodes, much larger numbers of GCs are expressed. The number of transmembrane segments (none, one, or multiple) divide the GC family into three groups. Those with no or one transmembrane segment bind nitric oxide/carbon monoxide (NO/CO) or peptides. There are no known ligands for the multiple transmembrane segment class of GCs. Mutational and structural analyses support a model where catalysis requires a shared substrate binding site between the subunits, whether homomeric or heteromeric in nature. Because some cyclases or cyclase ligand genes lack specific GC inhibitors, disruption of either has been used to define the functions of individual cyclases, as well as to define human genetic disease counterparts.\n\nFactors affecting the activity of guanylate cyclase in lysates of human blood platelets.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAdams, A F; Haslam, R J\n\n1978-01-01\n\n1. Under optimal ionic conditions (4 mM-MnCl2) the specific activity of guanylate cyclase in fresh platelet lysates was about 10nmol of cyclic GMP formed/20 min per mg of protein at 30 degrees C. Activity was 15% of optimum with 10mM-MgCl2 and negligible with 4mM-CaCl2. Synergism between MnCl2 and MgCl2 or CaCl2 was observed when [MnCl2] less than or equal to [GPT]. 2. Lower than optimal specific activities were obtained in assays containing large volumes of platelet lysate, owing to the presence of inhibitory factors that could be removed by ultrafiltration. Adenine nucleotides accounted for less than 50% of the inhibitory activity. 3. Preincubation of lysate for 1 h at 30 degrees C increased the specific activity of platelet guanylate cyclase by about 2-fold. 4. Lubrol PX (1%, w/v) stimulated guanylate cyclase activity by 3--5-fold before preincubation and by about 2-fold after preincubation. Triton X-100 was much less effective. 5. Dithiothreitol inhibited the guanylate cyclase activity of untreated, preincubated and Lubrol PX-treated lysates and prevented activation by preincubation provided that it was added beforehand. 6. Oleate stimulated guanylate cyclase activity 3--4-fold and arachidonate 2--3-fold, whereas palmitate was almost inactive. Pretreatment of lysate with indomethacin did not inhibit this effect of arachidonate. Oleate and arachidonate caused marked stimulation of guanylate cyclase in preincubated lysate, but inhibited the enzyme in Lubrol PX-treated lysate. 7. NaN3 (10mM) increased guanylate cyclase activity by up to 7-fold; this effect was both time- and temperature-dependent. NaN3 did not further activate the enzyme in Lubrol PX-treated lysate. 8.

This toxin has several properties such as: (i) adenylate cyclase activity, enhanced after interaction with the eukaryotic protein, calmodulin; (ii) a pore-forming activity; (iii) an invasive activity. It plays an important role in the pathogenesis of these Bordetella species responsible for whooping cough in humans or persistent respiratory infections in mammals, by modulating host immune responses. In contrast with other Bordetella toxins or adhesins, lack of (or very low polymorphism) is observed in the structural gene encoding this toxin, supporting its importance as well as a potential role as a vaccine antigen against whooping cough. In this article, an overview of the investigations undertaken on this toxin is presented.

Glucose effectively stimulated activities of both cyclase enzymes, while cAMP more effectively stimulated adenylate cyclase. It was shown that [6-(14)C]glucose specifically bound to Tetrahymena pyriformis infusoria at dissociation constant (K(D)) and number of binding sites (B(max)) 43 nM and 7.53 fmol glucose per 100,000 cells and [8-(3)H]cAMP bound at 19 nM and 4.46 fmol cAMP per 100,000 cells, respectively. Hence, glucose and cAMP specifically bound to Tetrahymena pyriformis cells and stimulated activities of cyclases in these infusoria.\n\nAction of Escherichia coli Enterotoxin: Adenylate Cyclase Behavior of Intestinal Epithelial Cells in Culture\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKantor, Harvey S.; Tao, Pearl; Wisdom, Charlene\n\n1974-01-01\n\nHeat-labile enterotoxin preparations obtained from two enteropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli of porcine and human origin were shown to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity of human embryonic intestinal epithelial cells in culture. Comparable results were also obtained when cholera toxin was used. The degree of enzyme stimulation was proportional to the concentration of enterotoxin. Similar preparations from two strains of non-enterotoxigenic E. coli had no effect on adenylate cyclase activity. Cells exposed to enterotoxin could be washed after 1 min of contact time without altering the subsequent course of maximum adenylate cyclase activity, which was maintained for at least 18 h at 37 C. During long periods (18 h) of tissue culture incubation, the determination of adenylate cyclase activity was 200- to 300-fold more sensitive than quantitating fluid accumulation in the adult rabbit ileal loop model. Decreasing the incubation time appreciably reduced the sensitivity of the epithelial cells to enterotoxin. E. coli enterotoxin is an effective activator of nonintestinal adenylate cyclase systems. Treatment of KB and HEp-2 cell lines with enterotoxin also resulted in significant enzyme stimulation. The intestinal epithelial cell tissue culture model provides a sensitive homogenous biological system for studying the response of intestinal adenylate cyclase to enterotoxin while eliminating the numerous cellular and tissue components present in the ligated ileal loop model.

Luca; Underhill, Peter A.; Chakraborty, Ranajit; Jin, Li; Su, Bing\n\n2005-01-01\n\nPituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a neuropeptide abundantly expressed in the central nervous system and involved in regulating neurogenesis and neuronal signal transduction. The amino acid sequence of PACAP is extremely conserved across vertebrate species, indicating a strong functional constraint during the course of evolution. However, through comparative sequence analysis, we demonstrated that the PACAP precursor gene underwent an accelerated evolution in the human lineage since the divergence from chimpanzees, and the amino acid substitution rate in humans is at least seven times faster than that in other mammal species resulting from strong Darwinian positive selection. Eleven human-specific amino acid changes were identified in the PACAP precursors, which are conserved from murine to African apes. Protein structural analysis suggested that a putative novel neuropeptide might have originated during human evolution and functioned in the human brain. Our data suggested that the PACAP precursor gene underwent adaptive changes during human origin and may have contributed to the formation of human cognition.

C.; Martin, E.; Murad, F.\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe alpha1- and beta1-subunits of human soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) were coexpressed in the Sf9 cells/baculovirus system. In addition to the native enzyme, constructs with hexahistidine tag at the amino and carboxyl termini of each subunit were coexpressed. This permitted the rapid and efficient purification of active recombinant enzyme on a nickel-affinity column. The enzyme has one heme per heterodimer and was readily activated with the NO donor sodium nitroprusside or 3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'furyl)-1-benzyl-indazole (YC-1). Sodium nitroprusside and YC-1 treatment potentiated each other in combination and demonstrated a remarkable 2,200-fold stimulation of the human recombinant sGC. The effects were inhibited with 1H-(1,2, 4)oxadiazole(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1one (ODQ). The kinetics of the recombinant enzyme with respect to GTP was examined. The products of the reaction, cGMP and pyrophosphate, inhibited the enzyme. The extent of inhibition by cGMP depended on the activation state of the enzyme, whereas inhibition by pyrophosphate was not affected by the enzyme state. Both reaction products displayed independent binding and cooperativity with respect to enzyme inhibition. The expression of large quantities of active enzyme will facilitate structural characterization of the protein.\n\nBifunctional homodimeric triokinase/FMN cyclase: contribution of protein domains to the activities of the human enzyme and molecular dynamics simulation of domain movements.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigues, Joaquim Rui; Couto, Ana; Cabezas, Alicia; Pinto, Rosa MarÃ­a; Ribeiro, JoÃ£o Meireles; Canales, JosÃ©; Costas, MarÃ­a JesÃºs; Cameselle, JosÃ© Carlos\n\n2014-04-11\n\nMammalian triokinase, which phosphorylates exogenous dihydroxyacetone and fructose-derived glyceraldehyde, is neither molecularly identified nor firmly associated to an encoding gene.

The cDNA clone (5.8 kilobases) was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using degenerate primers designed by comparison of three adenylyl cyclase sequences (types I, II, and III) and subsequent library screening. Northern analysis revealed expression of mRNA (6.1 kilobases) corresponding to this cDNA in cardiac tissue, which is a prominent source of Ca(2+)-inhibitable adenylyl cyclase. The clone encodes a protein of 1165 amino acids, whose hydrophilicity profile was very similar to those of other mammalian adenylyl cyclases that have recently been cloned. A noticeable difference between this protein and other adenylyl cyclases was a lengthy aminoterminal region before the first transmembrane span. Transient expression of this cDNA in the human embryonic kidney cell line 293 revealed a 3-fold increase in cAMP production in response to forskolin compared with control transfected cells. In purified plasma membranes from transfected cells, increased adenylyl cyclase activity was also detected, which was susceptible to inhibition by submicromolar Ca2+. Thus, this adenylyl cyclase seems to represent the Ca(2+)-inhibitable form that is encountered in NCB-20 cells, cardiac tissue, and elsewhere. Its identification should permit a determination of the structural features that determine the mode of regulation of adenylyl cyclase by Ca2+.

Cyclase-associated protein 1 is a member of the cyclase-associated proteins which contributes to tumor progression. The aim of the present study was to examine the expression of cyclase-associated protein 1 and to elucidate its clinicopathologic signiï¬cance in a larger series of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses were performed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues. Survival analyses were performed by using the Kaplan-Meier method. The role of cyclase-associated protein 1 in migration was studied in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines of TE1 through knocking down cyclase-associated protein 1 with siRNA and overexpression of cyclase-associated protein 1. The regulation of cyclase-associated protein 1 on migration was determined by transwell and wound-healing assays. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that cyclase-associated protein 1 expression was negatively associated with E-cadherin and signiï¬cantly associated with lymph node metastases. Survival analysis revealed that cyclase-associated protein 1 overexpression was signiï¬cantly associated with overall survival (P = 0.011). Knock down of cyclase-associated protein 1 in TE1 cells resulted in decreased vimentin and F-actin levels and the capability for migration. In addition, overexpression of cyclase-associated protein 1 promoted the migration of TE1 cells. These ï¬ndings suggest that cyclase-associated protein 1 is involved in the metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and that elevated levels of cyclase-associated protein 1 expression may indicate a poor prognosis for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.\n\nEngineering ionic liquid-tolerant cellulases for biofuels production.\n\nPubMed\n\nWolski, Paul W; Dana, Craig M; Clark, Douglas S; Blanch, Harvey W\n\n2016-04-01\n\nDissolution of lignocellulosic biomass in certain ionic liquids (ILs) can provide an effective pretreatment prior to enzymatic saccharification of cellulose for biofuels production. Toward the goal of combining pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, we evolved enzyme variants of Talaromyces emersonii Cel7A to be more active and stable than wild-type T. emersonii Cel7A or Trichoderma reesei Cel7A in aqueous-IL solutions (up to 43% (w/w) 1,3-dimethylimdazolium dimethylphosphate and 20% (w/w) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate). In general, greater enzyme stability in buffer at elevated temperature corresponded to greater stability in aqueous-ILs. Post-translational modification of the N-terminal glutamine residue to pyroglutamate via glutaminyl cyclase enhanced the stability of T. emersonii Cel7A and variants. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed an increase in melting temperature of 1.9-3.9Â°C for the variant 1M10 over the wild-type T. emersonii Cel7A in aqueous buffer and in an IL-aqueous mixture. We observed this increase both with and without glutaminyl cyclase treatment of the enzymes. Â© The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

Terpenoid cyclases catalyze the most complex chemical reactions in biology, in that more than half of the substrate carbon atoms undergo changes in bonding and hybridization during a single enzyme-catalyzed cyclization reaction. The past two decades have witnessed structural, functional, and computational studies illuminating the modes of substrate activation that initiate the cyclization cascade, the management and manipulation of high-energy carbocation intermediates that propagate the cyclization cascade, and the chemical strategies that terminate the cyclization cascade. The role of the terpenoid cyclase as a template for catalysis is paramount to its function, and protein engineering can be used to reprogram the cyclization cascade to generate alternative and commercially important products. Here, I review key advances in terpenoid cyclase structural and chemical biology, focusing mainly on terpenoid cyclases and related prenyltransferases for which X-ray crystal structures have informed and advanced our understanding of enzyme structure and function.

One group described the poor kinetic properties of the BACE 1 Î²-secretase for cleaving the wild-type Î²-secretase site in the APP found in most AD patients. They demonstrated that cathepsin D displays BACE 1-like specificity, is 280-fold more abundant in human brain than BACE 1, and pepstatin A inhibits cleavage of Î²-secretase site peptides by brain extracts and cathepsin D, but not by BACE 1. Nevertheless, as BACE 1 and cathepsin D show poor activity towards the wild type Î²-secretase site, they suggested continuing the search for additional Î²-secretase candidate(s). The second group reported that cathepsin B is such an alternative Î²-secretase candidate possessing excellent kinetic efficiency and specificity for cleaving the wild-type Î²-secretase site. Significantly, they demonstrated that inhibitors of cathepsin B improved memory function with reduced amyloid plaque neuropathology and decreased brain AÎ²(40/42) and Î²-secretase activity in AD animal models expressing APP containing the wild-type Î²-secretase site. The third group addressed isoaspartate and pyroglutamate (pGlu) posttranslational modifications of AÎ² that are present in AD brains, with evidence that cathepsin B, but not BACE 1, efficiently cleaves the wild-type Î²-secretase site containing isoaspartate. They also found that cyclization of N-terminal Glu by glutaminyl cyclase generates pGluAÎ²(3-40/42) peptides that are highly amyloidogenic. These presentations suggested that cathepsin B and glutaminyl cyclase are potential new AD therapeutic targets.

Coupling of the Ca2+ and cAMP regulatory systems by calmodulin-regulated adenylyl cyclases is hypothesized to be important for some forms of synaptic plasticity, neuroendocrine function, and olfactory detection. Recent studies of a mutant mouse deficient in type I calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase have provided the first evidence that adenylyl cyclases are important for synaptic plasticity, as well as for learning and memory in vertebrates.\n\nPurification and assay of cell-invasive form of calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase from Bordetella pertussis\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMasure, H.R.; Donovan, M.G.; Storm, D.R.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nAn invasive form of the CaM-sensitive adenylyl cyclase from Bordetella pertussis can be isolated from bacterial culture supernatants. This isolation is achieved through the use of QAE-Sephadex anion-exchange chromatography. It has been demonstrated that the addition of exogenous Ca{sup 2}{sup +} to the anion-exchange gradient buffers will affect elution from the column and will thereby affect the isolation of invasive adenylyl cyclase. This is probably due to a Ca2(+)-dependent interaction of the catalytic subunit with another component in the culture supernatant. Two peaks of adenylyl cyclase activity are obtained. The Pk1 adenylyl cyclase preparation is able to cause significant increasesmoreÂ Â» in intracellular cAMP levels in animal cells. This increase occurs rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner in both N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells and human erythrocytes. The Pk2 adenylyl cyclase has catalytic activity but is not cell invasive. This material can serve, therefore, as a control to ensure that the cAMP which is measured is, indeed, intracellular. A second control is to add exogenous CaM to the Pk1 adenylyl cyclase preparation. The 45-kDa catalytic subunit-CaM complex is not cell invasive. Although the mechanism for membrane translocation of the adenylyl cyclase is unknown, there is evidence that the adenylyl cyclase enters animal cells by a mechanism distinct from receptor-mediated endocytosis. Calmodulin-sensitive adenylyl cyclase activity can be removed from preparations of the adenylyl cyclase that have been subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This property of the enzyme has enabled purification of the catalytic subunit to apparent homogeneity. The purified catalytic subunit from culture supernatants has a predicted molecular weight of 45,000. This polypeptide interacts directly with Ca{sup 2}{sup +} and this interaction may be important for its invasion into animal cells.Â«Â less\n\nAbacavir increases platelet reactivity via competitive inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaum, Paul D.; Sullam, Paul M.; Stoddart, Cheryl A.; McCune, Joseph M.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nObjective To provide a molecular mechanism that explains the association of the antiretroviral guanosine analogue, abacavir, with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Design Drug effects were studied with biochemical and cellular assays. Methods Human platelets were incubated with nucleoside analogue drugs ex vivo. Platelet activation stimulated by ADP was studied by measuring surface P-selectin with flow cytometry. Inhibition of purified soluble guanylyl cyclase was quantified using an ELISA to measure cGMP production. Results Pre-incubation of platelets in abacavir significantly increased activation in response to ADP in a time and dose-dependent manner. The active anabolite of abacavir, carbovir triphosphate, competitively inhibited soluble guanylyl cyclase activity with a Ki of 55 Î¼mol/l. Conclusion Abacavir competitively inhibits guanylyl cyclase, leading to platelet hyper-reactivity. This may explain the observed increased risk of myocardial infarction in HIV patients taking abacavir.

It is shown that the highest stimulatory effect is produced by sodium nitroprusside, whose activating action is due to the interaction of its NO group with the guanylate cyclase heme. Nitroso complexes (Co and Cr) the NO group of which is neutral stimulated guanylate cyclase activity insignificantly and this activation was not guanylate cyclase heme directed. Nitroso complex (Co) with NO coordinated as anion NO(-)--is a guanylate cyclase inhibitor. In contrast to nitroprusside, the nitroso complexes used (Co and Cr) have no hypotensive effect. It was concluded that the essential requirement for the realization of the hypotensive effect of transition metals' nitroso complexes is the ability of these compounds to activate soluble guanylate cyclase solely by the heme-dependent mechanism.\n\nPorcine CD38 exhibits prominent secondary NAD(+) cyclase activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nTing, Kai Yiu; Leung, Christina F P; Graeff, Richard M; Lee, Hon Cheung; Hao, Quan; Kotaka, Masayo\n\n2016-03-01\n\nCyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) mobilizes intracellular Ca(2+) stores and activates Ca(2+) influx to regulate a wide range of physiological processes. It is one of the products produced from the catalysis of NAD(+) by the multifunctional CD38/ADP-ribosyl cyclase superfamily. After elimination of the nicotinamide ring by the enzyme, the reaction intermediate of NAD(+) can either be hydrolyzed to form linear ADPR or cyclized to form cADPR. We have previously shown that human CD38 exhibits a higher preference towards the hydrolysis of NAD(+) to form linear ADPR while Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase prefers cyclizing NAD(+) to form cADPR. In this study, we characterized the enzymatic properties of porcine CD38 and revealed that it has a prominent secondary NAD(+) cyclase activity producing cADPR. We also determined the X-ray crystallographic structures of porcine CD38 and were able to observe conformational flexibility at the base of the active site of the enzyme which allow the NAD(+) reaction intermediate to adopt conformations resulting in both hydrolysis and cyclization forming linear ADPR and cADPR respectively.

The physical parameters of the predominant form in Triton X-100 are s20,w, 5.9S; Strokes radius, 62 A; partial specific volume (v), 0.74 ml/g; mass, 159,000 daltons; f/f0, 1.6; axial ratio (prolate ellipsoid), 11. For the minor form the values are: s20w, 3.0; Stokes radius, 28 A; mass, 38,000 daltons; f/f0, 1.2. The corresponding values determined in Lubrol PX are similar. The value for V for the enzyme indicates that it binds less than 0.2 mg detergent/mg protein. Since interactions with detergents probably substitute for interactions with lipids and hydrophobic amino acid side chains, these findings suggest that no more than 5% of the surface of adenylate cyclase is involved in hydrophobic interactions with other membrane components. Thus, most of the mass of the enzyme is not deeply embedded in the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane. Similar studies have been performed on the soluble guanylate cyclase of the rat renal medulla. In the absence of detergent, the molecular properties of this enzyme are: s20w, 6.3S; Stokes radius, 54 A, V, 0.75 ml/g; mass, 154,000 daltons f/f0, 1.4; Axial ratio, 7. The addition of 0.1% Lubrol PX to this soluble enzyme increases it activity two- to fourfold and changes the physical properties to: s20,w, 5.5S; Stokes radius, 62 A; V, 0.74 ml/g; mass, 148,000 daltons, f/f0, 1.6; axial ratio, 11. These results show that Lubrol PX activates the enzyme by causing a conformational change with unfolding on the polypeptide chain. Guanylate cyclase from the particulate cell fraction can be solubilized with Lubrol PX but has properties quite different from those of the enzyme in the soluble cell fraction. It is a heterogeneous aggregate with s20,w, 10S; Stokes radius, 65 A; mass about 300,000 daltons\n\nADP-ribosyl cyclases regulate early development of the sea urchin.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamakrishnan, Latha; Uhlinger, Kevin; Dale, Leslie; Hamdoun, Amro; Patel, Sandip\n\n2016-06-01\n\nADP-ribosyl cyclases are multifunctional enzymes involved in the metabolism of nucleotide derivatives necessary for Ca 2+ signalling such as cADPR and NAADP. Although Ca 2+ signalling is a critical regulator of early development, little is known of the role of ADP-ribosyl cyclases during embryogenesis. Here we analyze the expression, activity and function of ADP-ribosyl cyclases in the embryo of the sea urchin - a key organism for study of both Ca 2+ signalling and embryonic development. ADP-ribosyl cyclase isoforms (SpARC1-4) showed unique changes in expression during early development. These changes were associated with an increase in the ratio of cADPR:NAADP production. Over-expression of SpARC4 (a preferential cyclase) disrupted gastrulation. Our data highlight the importance of ADP-ribosyl cyclases during embryogenesis.\n\nPhenotypes Associated with the Essential Diadenylate Cyclase CdaA and Its Potential Regulator CdaR in the Human Pathogen Listeria monocytogenes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRismondo, Jeanine; Gibhardt, Johannes; Rosenberg, Jonathan; Kaever, Volkhard\n\n2015-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a second messenger utilized by diverse bacteria. In many species, including the Gram-positive human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, c-di-AMP is essential for growth. Here we show that the single diadenylate cyclase of L. monocytogenes, CdaA, is an integral membrane protein that interacts with its potential regulatory protein, CdaR, via the transmembrane protein domain. The presence of the CdaR protein is not required for the membrane localization and abundance of CdaA. We have also found that CdaR negatively influences CdaA activity in L. monocytogenes and that the role of CdaR is most evident at a high growth temperature. Interestingly, a cdaR mutant strain is less susceptible to lysozyme. Moreover, CdaA contributes to cell division, and cells depleted of CdaA are prone to lysis. The observation that the growth defect of a CdaA depletion strain can be partially restored by increasing the osmolarity of the growth medium suggests that c-di-AMP is important for maintaining the integrity of the protective cell envelope. Overall, this work provides new insights into the relationship between CdaA and CdaR. IMPORTANCE Cyclic diadenylate monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a recently identified second messenger that is utilized by the Gram-positive human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Here we show that the single diadenylate cyclase of L. monocytogenes, CdaA, is an integral membrane protein that interacts with CdaR, its potential regulatory protein. We show that CdaR is not required for membrane localization or abundance of the diadenylate cyclase, but modulates its activity. Moreover, CdaA seems to contribute to cell division. Overall, this work provides new insights into the relationship between CdaA and CdaR and their involvement in cell growth.

Above concentrations of 0.001-0.01% Lubrol WX, the basal activity of cyclase from Ehrlich ascites cells was inhibed about 50%, and that from rat fat cells was doubled. In both cases, hormonal sensitivity was lost at 0.01%. These effects were reversed upon dilution of the detergent. It is suggested that solubilization of adenylate cyclases at such low concentrations of Lubrol should be attempted since it is conceivable that loss of hormone sensitivity may then be reversible. Different Lubrol-type detergents may also offer centain advantages, since Lubrol PX effects were not identical with those of Lubrol WX.\n\nIdentification of a fourth family of lycopene cyclases in photosynthetic bacteria\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMaresca, Julia A.; Graham, Joel E.; Wu, Martin; Eisen, Jonathan A.; Bryant, Donald A.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nA fourth and large family of lycopene cyclases was identified in photosynthetic prokaryotes. The first member of this family, encoded by the cruA gene of the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum, was identified in a complementation assay with a lycopene-producing strain of Escherichia coli. Orthologs of cruA are found in all available green sulfur bacterial genomes and in all cyanobacterial genomes that lack genes encoding CrtL- or CrtY-type lycopene cyclases. The cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 has two homologs of CruA, denoted CruA and CruP, and both were shown to have lycopene cyclase activity. Although all characterized lycopene cyclases in plants are CrtL-type proteins, genes orthologous to cruP also occur in plant genomes. The CruA- and CruP-type carotenoid cyclases are members of the FixC dehydrogenase superfamily and are distantly related to CrtL- and CrtY-type lycopene cyclases. Identification of these cyclases fills a major gap in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways of green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria.

The Mg2+ and Mn2+ activity ratio varies from one membrane preparation to another, suggesting that the adenylyl cyclase has a variable activation state. A[35S]GTP-gamma-S-binding activity with a Kd of 171 nM was detected in Phytomonas membranes. Incubation of these membranes with activated cholera or pertussis toxin and [adenylate 23P]NAD+ led to incorporation of radioactivity into bands of about 40-44 kDa. Crude membranes were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed, by Western blotting, with the 9188 anti-alpha[s] antibody and the AS/7 antibody (anti-alpha[i], anti-alpha[i1], and anti-alpha[i2]. These procedures resulted in the identification of polypeptides of approximately 40-44 kDa. Phytomonas adenylyl cyclase could be activated by treatment of membrane preparations with cholera toxin, in the presence of NAD+, while similar treatment with pertussis toxin did not affect this enzyme activity. These studies indicate that in Phytomonas, adenylyl cyclase activity is coupled to an unknown receptor entity through G alpha[s] proteins.\n\nRegulation and therapeutic targeting of peptide-activated receptor guanylyl cyclases\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPotter, Lincoln R.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nCyclic GMP is a ubiquitous second messenger that regulates a wide array of physiologic processes such as blood pressure, long bone growth, intestinal fluid secretion, phototransduction and lipolysis. Soluble and single-membrane-spanning enzymes called guanylyl cyclases (GC) synthesize cGMP. In humans, the latter group consists of GC-A, GC-B, GC-C, GC-E and GC-F, which are also known as NPR-A, NPR-B, StaR, Ret1-GC and Ret2-GC, respectively. Membrane GCs are activated by peptide ligands such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), guanylin, uroguanylin, heat stable enterotoxin and GC-activating proteins. Nesiritide and carperitide are clinically approved peptide-based drugs that activate GC-A. CD-NP is an experimental heart failure drug that primarily activates GC-B but also activates GC-A at high concentrations and is resistant to degradation. Inactivating mutations in GC-B cause acromesomelic dysplasia type Maroteaux dwarfism and chromosomal mutations that increase CNP concentrations are associated with Marfanoid-like skeletal overgrowth. Pump-based CNP infusions increase skeletal growth in a mouse model of the most common type of human dwarfism, which supports CNP/GC-B-based therapies for short stature diseases. Linaclotide is a peptide activator of GC-C that stimulates intestinal motility and is in late-stage clinical trials for the treatment of chronic constipation. This review discusses the discovery of cGMP, guanylyl cyclases, the general characteristics and therapeutic applications of GC-A, GC-B and GC-C, and emphasizes the regulation of transmembrane guanylyl cyclases by phosphorylation and ATP.

Commonly, individuals who develop this syndrome lack symptoms of muscle disease, and their muscle lacks specific pathological changes. A biochemical marker for this myopathy has not previously been available; we found activity of adenylate cyclase and content of cyclic AMP to be abnormally high in skeletal muscle. Secondary modification of protein phosphorylation could explain observed abnormalities of phosphorylase activation and sarcoplasmic reticulum function.

It also inhibited the ACTH-stimulated membrane guanylate cyclase, but did not affect the binding of ACTH to the membrane receptors. cGMP-induced steroidogenesis was not affected by the drug. These data indicate that chlorpromazine interferes with adrenal steroid metabolism at a site between the hormone receptor and guanylate cyclase and also show that guanylate cyclase is composed of separate receptor and catalytic components. Furthermore, based on the premise that chlorpromazine exerts its inhibitory action by blocking the binding of a calcium receptor protein, such as calmodulin, to the receptor-coupled guanylate cyclase, it is proposed that the interaction of calcium, presumably through a calcium-binding protein, is essential for ACTH-dependent guanylate cyclase.\n\nPituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide: a novel peptide with protean implications.\n\nPubMed\n\nPisegna, Joseph R; Oh, David S\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThe purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide in physiological processes and to describe how this peptide is becoming increasingly recognized as having a major role in the body. Since its discovery in 1989, investigators have sought to determine the site of biological activity and the function of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide in maintaining homeostasis. Since its discovery, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide appears to play an important role in the regulation of processes within the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract, as well in reproductive biology. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide has been shown to regulate tumor cell growth and to regulate immune function through its effects on T lympocytes. These discoveries suggest the importance of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide in neuronal development, neuronal function, gastrointestinal tract function and reproduction. Future studies will examine more closely the role of pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide in regulation of malignantly transformed cells, as well as in regulation of immune function.\n\nGeneral base-general acid catalysis by terpenoid cyclases.\n\nPubMed\n\nPemberton, Travis A; Christianson, David W\n\n2016-07-01\n\nTerpenoid cyclases catalyze the most complex reactions in biology, in that more than half of the substrate carbon atoms often undergo changes in bonding during the course of a multistep cyclization cascade that proceeds through multiple carbocation intermediates. Many cyclization mechanisms require stereospecific deprotonation and reprotonation steps, and most cyclization cascades are terminated by deprotonation to yield an olefin product. The first bacterial terpenoid cyclase to yield a crystal structure was pentalenene synthase from Streptomyces exfoliatus UC5319. This cyclase generates the hydrocarbon precursor of the pentalenolactone family of antibiotics. The structures of pentalenene synthase and other terpenoid cyclases reveal predominantly nonpolar active sites typically lacking amino acid side chains capable of serving general base-general acid functions. What chemical species, then, enables the BrÃ¸nsted acid-base chemistry required in the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes? The most likely candidate for such general base-general acid chemistry is the co-product inorganic pyrophosphate. Here, we briefly review biological and nonbiological systems in which phosphate and its derivatives serve general base and general acid functions in catalysis. These examples highlight the fact that the BrÃ¸nsted acid-base activities of phosphate derivatives are comparable to the BrÃ¸nsted acid-base activities of amino acid side chains.\n\nDimerization Domain of Retinal Membrane Guanylyl Cyclase 1 (RetGC1) Is an Essential Part of Guanylyl Cyclase-activating Protein (GCAP) Binding Interface.\n\nPubMed\n\nPeshenko, Igor V; Olshevskaya, Elena V; Dizhoor, Alexander M\n\n2015-08-07\n\nThe photoreceptor-specific proteins guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins (GCAPs) bind and regulate retinal membrane guanylyl cyclase 1 (RetGC1) but not natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPRA). Study of RetGC1 regulation in vitro and its association with fluorescently tagged GCAP in transfected cells showed that R822P substitution in the cyclase dimerization domain causing congenital early onset blindness disrupted RetGC1 ability to bind GCAP but did not eliminate its affinity for another photoreceptor-specific protein, retinal degeneration 3 (RD3). Likewise, the presence of the NPRA dimerization domain in RetGC1/NPRA chimera specifically disabled binding of GCAPs but not of RD3. In subsequent mapping using hybrid dimerization domains in RetGC1/NPRA chimera, multiple RetGC1-specific residues contributed to GCAP binding by the cyclase, but the region around Met(823) was the most crucial. Either positively or negatively charged residues in that position completely blocked GCAP1 and GCAP2 but not RD3 binding similarly to the disease-causing mutation in the neighboring Arg(822). The specificity of GCAP binding imparted by RetGC1 dimerization domain was not directly related to promoting dimerization of the cyclase. The probability of coiled coil dimer formation computed for RetGC1/NPRA chimeras, even those incapable of binding GCAP, remained high, and functional complementation tests showed that the RetGC1 active site, which requires dimerization of the cyclase, was formed even when Met(823) or Arg(822) was mutated. These results directly demonstrate that the interface for GCAP binding on RetGC1 requires not only the kinase homology region but also directly involves the dimerization domain and especially its portion containing Arg(822) and Met(823).

The triphosphate chain, position 8 of the adenine base and the ribose residue of the ATP molecule were modified. Despite the presence of the alkylating groups in two former types of the analogs tested, no covalent blocking of the active site of the enzyme was observed. Most of the compounds appeared to be competitive reversible inhibitors. The kinetic data confirmed the importance of the triphosphate chain for substrate binding in the active site of adenylate cyclase. (Formula: See Text) The inhibitors with different substituents in position 8 of the adenine base had a low affinity for the enzyme. The possible orientation of the triphosphate chain and the advantages of anti-conformation of the ATP molecule for their binding in the active site of adenylate cyclase are discussed.\n\nCholera toxin activation of adenylate cyclase in cancer cell membrane fragments.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBitensky, M W; Wheeler, M A; Mehta, H; Miki, N\n\n1975-01-01\n\nActivation of adenylate [ATP pyrophosphate-lyase (cyclizing), EC 4.6.1.1] by cholera toxin (84,000 daltons, 5.5 S) is demonstrated in plasma membrane fragments of mouse ascites cancer cells. The activation of adenylate cyclase is mediated by a macromolecular cyclase activating factor (MCAF), which has a sedimentation constant of 2.7 S and a molecular weight of about 26,000. MCAF is derived from, and may be identical to the \"A fragment\" of cholera toxin. Generation of MCAF depends on prior interaction of cholera toxin with either dithiothreitol, NADH, NAD, or a low-molecular-weight component (less than 700 daltons) present in cytoplasm. Subsequent exposure of this pretreated cholera toxin to cell membranes from a variety of mouse ascites cancer cells is followed rapidly by the appearance of MCAF, which no longer requires dithiothreitol, NADH, or NAD for the activation of adenylate cyclase. Activation of adenylate cyclase by MCAF in ascites cancer cell membrane fragments is not reversed by repeated washing of these membrane fragments. Adenylate cyclase in normal cell membrane fragments fails to respond either to cholera toxin or MCAF in the presence of dithiothreitol. In striking contrast, the adenylate cyclase in membrane fragments from five ascites cancer cells responds to either MCAF or native cholera toxin preincubated with dithiothreitol, NADH, or NAD.

The soluble enzyme was stimulated by forskolin, a hydrophobic activator, in the presence of Mg2+ indicating that the catalytic subunit had not been damaged after solubilization. The enzyme was also activated by 5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) showing that the catalytic unit was not separated from stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding protein (Gs) during the extraction. Both activators showed different effects on the stimulatory efficacy and potency of AC activity solobulized with detergents. Gel filtration of Lubrol-PX and CHAPS extracts over a Sepharose CL-2B column partially resolved AC and its complexes. The chromatographic profile for Lubrol-solubilized AC presented a main peak of about 200 kDa whereas CHAPS-solubilized AC showed a dominant peak of about 1100 kDa. The heterodisperse peaks obtained revealed that the catalytic AC subunit was not separated from Gs proteins after gel filtration, and that AC could be associated with other cellular proteins. When Lubrol extract was submitted to anionic-exchange chromatography, the enzyme was purified about 7.5 fold (enzymatic activity of 48.1 pmol/min/mg of protein). The catalytic subunit was co-eluted with both AC-activating proteins Galphas large (52.2 kDa) and Galphas small (48.7 kDa). This is the first demonstration of the stable physical association of AC with both alphas subunits of G proteins in human myometrium.\n\nForskolin photoaffinity labels with specificity for adenylyl cyclase and the glucose transporter\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMorris, D.I.; Robbins, J.D.; Ruoho, A.E.\n\n1991-07-15\n\nTwo photolabels, N-(3-(4-azido-3-125I-phenyl)-propionamide)-6- aminoethylcarbamylforskolin(125I-6-AIPP-Fsk) and N-(3-(4-azido-3-125I-phenyl)propionamide)-7-aminoethylcarbamyl-7- desacetylforskolin (125I-7-AIPP-Fsk) were synthesized with specific activities of 2200 Ci/mmol and used to label adenylyl cyclase and the glucose transporter. The affinities of the photolabels for adenylyl cyclase were determined by their inhibition of (3H)forskolin binding to bovine brain membranes. 6-AIPP-Fsk and 7-AIPP-Fsk inhibited (3H)forskolin binding with IC50 values of 15 nM and 200 nM, respectively. 125I-6-AIPP-Fsk labeled a 115-kDa protein in control and GTP {gamma} S-preactivated bovine brain membranes. This labeling was inhibited by forskolin but not by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin or cytochalasin B. 125I-6-AIPP-Fsk labeling of partially purified adenylyl cyclase was inhibited by forskolinmoreÂ Â» but not by 1,9-dideoxyforskolin. 125I-7-AIPP-Fsk specifically labeled a 45-kDa protein and not a 115-kDa protein in control and GTP {gamma} S-preactivated brain membranes. This labeling was inhibited by forskolin, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, cytochalasin B, and D-glucose but not cytochalasin E or L-glucose. Human erythrocyte membranes were photolyzed with 125I-6-AIPP-Fsk and 125I-7-AIPP-Fsk. 125I-7-AIPP-Fsk, but not 125I-6-AIPP-Fsk, strongly labeled a broad 45-70-kDa band. Forskolin, 7-bromoacetyl-7-desacetylforskolin, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, cytochalasin B, and D-glucose, but not cytochalasin E or L-glucose, inhibited 125I-7-AIPP-Fsk labeling of the 45-70-kDa band. 125I-6-AIPP-Fsk and 125I-7-AIPP-Fsk are high affinity photolabels with specificity for adenylyl cyclase and the glucose transporter, respectively.Â«Â less\n\nModification of adenylate cyclase by photoaffinity analogs of forskolin\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHo, L.T.; Nie, Z.M.; Mende, T.J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nPhotoaffinity labeling analogs of the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin (PF) have been synthesized, purified and tested for their effect on preparations of membrane-bound, Lubrol solubilized and forskolin affinity-purified adenylate cyclase (AC). All analogs of forskolin significantly activated AC. However, in the presence of 0.1 to 0.3 microM forskolin, the less active forskolin photoaffinity probes at 100 microM caused inhibition. This inhibition was dose-dependent for PF, suggesting that PF may complete with F for the same binding site(s). After cross-linking (125I)PF-M to either membrane or Lubrol-solubilized AC preparations by photolysis, a radiolabeled 100-110 kDa protein band was observed after autoradiography followingmoreÂ Â» SDS-PAGE. F at 100 microM blocked the photoradiolabeling of this protein. Radioiodination of forskolin-affinity purified AC showed several protein bands on autoradiogram, however, only one band (Mr = 100-110 kDa) was specifically labeled by (125I)PF-M following photolysis. The photoaffinity-labeled protein of 100-110 kDa of AC preparation of rat adipocyte may be the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase of rat adipocyte itself as supported by the facts that (a) no other AC-regulatory proteins are known to be of this size, (b) the catalytic unit of bovine brain enzyme is in the same range and (c) this PF specifically stimulates AC activity when assayed alone, and weekly inhibits forskolin-activation of cyclase. These studies indicate that radiolabeled PF probes may be useful for photolabeling and detecting the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase.Â«Â less\n\nBAY 41-2272, a soluble guanylate cyclase agonist, activates human mononuclear phagocytes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSoeiro-Pereira, PV; Falcai, A; Kubo, CA; Oliveira-JÃºnior, EB; Marques, OC; Antunes, E; Condino-Neto, A\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Phagocyte function is critical for host defense against infections. Defects in phagocytic function lead to several primary immunodeficiencies characterized by early onset of recurrent and severe infections. In this work, we further investigated the effects of BAY 41-2272, a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) agonist, on the activation of human peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) and THP-1 cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH THP-1 cells and PBM viability was evaluated by methylthiazoletetrazolium assay; reactive oxygen species production by lucigenin chemiluminescence; gene and protein expression of NAPDH oxidase components by qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively; phagocytosis and microbicidal activity by co-incubation, respectively, with zymosan and Escherichia coli; and cytokine release by elisa. KEY RESULTS BAY 41-2272, compared with the untreated group, increased spreading of monocytes by at least 35%, superoxide production by at least 50%, and gp91PHOX and p67PHOX gene expression 20 to 40 times, in both PBM and THP-1 cells. BAY 41-2272 also augmented phagocytosis of zymosan particles threefold compared with control, doubled microbicidal activity against E. coli and enhanced the release of TNF-Î± and IL-12p70 by both PBM and THP-1 cells. Finally, by inhibiting sGC with ODQ, we showed that BAY 41-2272-induced superoxide production and phagocytosis is not dependent exclusively on sGC activation. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS In addition to its ability to induce vasorelaxation and its potential application for therapy of vascular diseases, BAY 41-2272 was shown to activate human mononuclear phagocytes.

Many cyclization mechanisms require stereospecific deprotonation and reprotonation steps, and most cyclization cascades are terminated by deprotonation to yield an olefin product. The first bacterial terpenoid cyclase to yield a crystal structure was pentalenene synthase from Streptomyces exfoliatus UC5319. This cyclase generates the hydrocarbon precursor of the pentalenolactone family of antibiotics. The structures of pentalenene synthase and other terpenoid cyclases reveal predominantly nonpolar active sites typically lacking amino acid side chains capable of serving general base-general acid functions. What chemical species, then, enables the BrÃ¸nsted acid-base chemistry required in the catalytic mechanisms of these enzymes? The most likely candidate for such general base-general acid chemistry is the co-product inorganic pyrophosphate. Here, we briefly review biological and nonbiological systems in which phosphate and its derivatives serve general base and general acid functions in catalysis. These examples highlight the fact that the BrÃ¸nsted acid-base activities of phosphate derivatives are comparable to the BrÃ¸nsted acid-base activities of amino acid side chains.

This article contains three parts. The first part is \"Historical\"; it is brief, general, and freely borrowed from the earlier reviews, covering the field from its origin to the year 2004 (Sharma in Mol Cell Biochem, 230:3-30, 2002; Duda et al. in Peptides 26:969-984, 2005). The second part focuses on the \"Ca(2+)-modulated ROS-GC membrane guanylate cyclase subfamily\". It is divided into two sections. Section \"Historical\" and covers the area from its inception to the year 2004. It is also freely borrowed from an earlier review (Sharma et al. in Curr Top Biochem Res 6:111-144, 2004). Section \"Ca(2+)-modulated ROS-GC membrane guanylate cyclase subfamily\" covers the area from the year 2004 to May 2009. The objective is to focus on the chronological development, recognize major contributions of the original investigators, correct misplaced facts, and project on the future trend of the field of mammalian membrane guanylate cyclase. The third portion covers the present status and concludes with future directions in the field.\n\nInteractions between lysergic acid diethylamide and dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase systems in rat brain.\n\nPubMed\n\nHungen, K V; Roberts, S; Hill, D F\n\n1975-08-22\n\nInvestigations were carried out on the interactions of the hallucinogenic drug, D-lysergic acid diethylamide (D-LSD), and other serotonin antagonists with catecholamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase systems in cell-free preparations from different regions of rat brain. In equimolar concentration, D-LSD, 2-brono-D-lysergic acid diethylamide (BOL), or methysergide (UML) strongly blocked maximal stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity by either norepinephrine or dopamine in particulate preparations from cerebral cortices of young adult rats. D-LSD also eliminated the stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity of equimolar concentrations of norepinephrine or dopamine in particulate preparations from rat hippocampus. The effects of this hallucinogenic agent on adenylate cyclase activity were most striking in particulate preparations from corpus striatum. Thus, in 10 muM concentration, D-LSD not only completely eradicated the response to 10 muM dopamine in these preparations but also consistently stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. L-LSD (80 muM) was without effect. Significant activation of striatal adenylate cyclase was produced by 0.1 muM D-LSD. Activation of striatal adenylate cyclase of either D-LSD or dopamine was strongly blocked by the dopamine-blocking agents trifluoperazine, thioridazine, chlorpromazine, and haloperidol. The stimulatory effects of D-LSD and dopamine were also inhibited by the serotonin-blocking agents, BOL, 1-methyl-D-lysergic acid diethylamide (MLD), and cyproheptadine, but not by the beta-adrenergic-blocking agent, propranolol. However, these serotonin antagonists by themselves were incapable of stimulating adenylate cyclase activity in the striatal preparations. Several other hallucinogens, which were structurally related to serotonin, were also inactive in this regard, e.g., mescaline, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, psilocin and bufotenine. Serotonin itself produced a small stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity in striatal preparations and\n\nsiRNA screen identifies QPCT as a druggable target for Huntington's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nJimenez-Sanchez, Maria; Lam, Wun; Hannus, Michael; SÃ¶nnichsen, Birte; Imarisio, Sara; Fleming, Angeleen; Tarditi, Alessia; Menzies, Fiona; Dami, Teresa Ed; Xu, Catherine; Gonzalez-Couto, Eduardo; Lazzeroni, Giulia; Heitz, Freddy; Diamanti, Daniela; Massai, Luisa; Satagopam, Venkata P; Marconi, Guido; Caramelli, Chiara; Nencini, Arianna; Andreini, Matteo; Sardone, Gian Luca; Caradonna, Nicola P; Porcari, Valentina; Scali, Carla; Schneider, Reinhard; Pollio, Giuseppe; O'Kane, Cahir J; Caricasole, Andrea; Rubinsztein, David C\n\n2015-05-01\n\nHuntington's disease (HD) is a currently incurable neurodegenerative condition caused by an abnormally expanded polyglutamine tract in huntingtin (HTT). We identified new modifiers of mutant HTT toxicity by performing a large-scale 'druggable genome' siRNA screen in human cultured cells, followed by hit validation in Drosophila. We focused on glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT), which had one of the strongest effects on mutant HTT-induced toxicity and aggregation in the cell-based siRNA screen and also rescued these phenotypes in Drosophila. We found that QPCT inhibition induced the levels of the molecular chaperone Î±B-crystallin and reduced the aggregation of diverse proteins. We generated new QPCT inhibitors using in silico methods followed by in vitro screening, which rescued the HD-related phenotypes in cell, Drosophila and zebrafish HD models. Our data reveal a new HD druggable target affecting mutant HTT aggregation and provide proof of principle for a discovery pipeline from druggable genome screen to drug development.\n\nSubcellular distribution and activation by non-ionic detergents of guanylate cyclase in cerebral cortex of rat.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeguchi, T; Amano, E; Nakane, M\n\n1976-11-01\n\nNon-ionic detergents stimulated particulate guanylate cyclase activity in cerebral cortex of rat 8- to 12-fold while stimulation of soluble enzyme was 1.3- to 2.5-fold.
