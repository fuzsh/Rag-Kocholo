It was really just a human connection, like, ‘Wow, I need to be around this person all the time.’ We stayed in touch after the show and started dating pretty soon afterward.\"\n\nA shared love of the stage also helped bring Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick together. The couple met in November 1991 after Broderick got involved with the Naked Angels Theater Company, which Parker's brothers Pippin and Toby helped start.\n\n“I’m so nervous acting opposite him,” the Sex and the City star told the Los Angeles Times ahead of the show’s debut. “I don’t know how we’re going to manage this without laughing hysterically at each other. We do not discuss it. I don’t even want to rehearse — I’m going to go on stage with a big blinder on my head — I don’t know what I’m thinking.”\n\nKeep scrolling to see more of Broadway's most iconic couples:\n\nCredit: Arturo Holmes/Getty Images\n\nThe Most Iconic Broadway Couples: Leslie Odom Jr. and Nicolette Robinson, More\n\nSometimes falling in love onstage can lead to an epic offstage romance — just ask Leslie Odom Jr. and Nicolette Robinson, who met during a production of Once on This Island.\n\n\"Les was responsible for helping me figure out all of my blocking,\" Robinson told Broadway.com in October 2018, explaining that she was asked to join the production weeks before opening night. \"It was not a romantic thing at first.

[My dream] was to work in theater, to be around those people whose work I was in total awe of. Nobody talked about being a celebrity.”\n\nShe continued: \"So, when our marriage came up in conversation, it wouldn’t occur to us that we were obligated to respond to allegations or gossip. You have to be a bit circumspect, but you also have to take up a position, and you have to stick to it.\"\n\nCredit: Broadway World/Shutterstock\n\nStephanie J. Block and Sebastian Arcelus\n\nThe Tony winner met her now-husband in January 2006 when they played Elphaba and Fiyero, respectively, in a national tour production of Wicked. They later reprised their roles on Broadway in October 2007 — the same month that they tied the knot in New York City. \"It was interesting how we met, [and] I recognized [that] this man is really something special, but I'm not into the 'show-mance' type thing,\" Block recalled to Playbill in December 2007. \"He was still on the road, and I was here in New York, and we really just made it work and put a lot of effort into it. Starting a relationship when it's long distance is not always the best, but it was immediately right.\" They welcomed daughter Vivienne in January 2015.\n\nCredit: Courtesy Max Clayton/Instagram\n\nMatt Doyle and Max Clayton\n\nAfter meeting at a Starbucks in 2015, Doyle began dating his boyfriend after Clayton got his email address from a mutual friend. \"The nice thing about us is that Max and I don't compete against one and other, and I think that's been an easy thing for us because we do very different things even within the industry,\" the Tony nominee told Rye Myers of RyeTheNewsGuy.com in June 2019. \"It can be really difficult to date someone who's doing the EXACT same thing, or God forbid, going up for the same roles as you. ... We're able to be completely supportive and embrace each other's careers, which is helpful. I know how important a career is and I think he feels the same way.\""
