Along the way, they meet characters like Cinderella and Little Red Ridinghood who have wishes and journeys of their own.\n\nThis production of Into the Woods is based on a two-week Off-Broadway revival at New York City Center, which sold out and received rave reviews. The five-star New York Theatre Guide review of the Broadway production calls Into the Woods \"bewitchingly beautiful and impeccably performed\" and \"Broadway's giant summer blockbuster.\"\n\nLear deBessonet directs the production of James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim's musical. This is the third Broadway revival since Into the Woods's premiere in 1987, when it won three Tony Awards including Best Book and Best Score.\n\nCheck back for information on Into the Woods tickets on New York Theatre Guide."
