So, I was actually served papers, I was summoned, on stage, in costume as Liza! They were like, 'You've been served.' And I'm onstage with my big eyelashes going, 'What the hell just happened!'\n\nClick HERE to watch the full episode!\n\nNew shows will be produced DAILY at the traditional theater times of 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. ET.
