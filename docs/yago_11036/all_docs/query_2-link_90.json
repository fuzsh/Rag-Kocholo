        "text": "Sebastian Arcelus is a Broadway performer turned TV Star. For the hit musical, Wicked, Arcelus played Fiyero in the very first national tour before transitioning to the Broadway production.\n\nOriginally pursuing business, Arcelus began performing in amateur theater after days at the office. But his talent led him to bigger stages, graduating from theater companies, to regional performances, to off-Broadway, to national tours, until he eventually made his Broadway debut as Roger in the 2002 production of Rent. He went on to originate roles like Jan in Good Vibrations, Jake in A Time To Kill, and the title role in the musical version of Elf on Broadway. Other notable shows include starring in Off-Broadway’s Happiness, playing Bob Gaudio in the Broadway production of Jersey Boys, among others. Arcelus has even had a hand at writing for stage: he cowrote the musical Gettin’ the Band Back Together, which eventually made its way to Broadway.\n\nAfter a decade on stage, Arcelus transitioned to television. He started out with voice-over roles, voicing Papi in Go, Diego, Go!, Timmy in Winx Club, and multiple characters in shows like Dora the Explorer, Pokémon, and Yu-Gi-Oh!, to name a few. By the mid-2010s, Arcelus stepped in front of the camera to play characters like Lucas Goodwin in Netflix’s House of Cards, as well as Jay Whitman in 100 episodes of CBS’s Madam Secretary. Additionally, he’s had several guest-star roles and recurred in HBO’s The Deuce. As for film, he’s appeared on the big screen in Nicholas Sparks’ The Best of Me, Temptation, Split, Ted 2, and more."
