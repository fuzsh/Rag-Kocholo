Jenen; Michael Cassel Group; Kevin Ryan; ShowTown Productions; Armstrong, Gold & Ross; Nicole Kastrinos, Executive Producer.\n\nThe fairy tale lives of several Brothers Grimm fictional characters intersect in the musical “INTO THE WOODS” written by James Lapine, presented at the Emerson Colonial Theatre featuring a powerhouse cast executing one of the most notable scores by Stephen Sondheim.\n\nThe show, which won a Tony Award for Best Score in 1988, is best known for its captivating underlying theme of: While we may not get the happy endings we feel exist \"as written\" for each of us, we WILL get an ending and, God willing, it will be the one we deserve.\n\nThe overall concept of the piece and its music not only proves consummate - it is also dazzling and sidesplitting, thanks to probably the most inventive staging imaginable and impeccable musical performances.\n\nDirected by Lear DeBessonet with choreography by Lorin Latarro (with an imaginative scenic design by David Rockwell), you will NOT see another production of \"INTO THE WOODS\" like this anytime soon, folks.\n\nIt is simply spectacular.\n\nThe precision movements that help to elevate the humor cannot be understated. They truly \"brought the funny\" to a musical predominantly staged as if it were an opulent Greek tragedy.\n\nLike other Sondheim enthusiasts, I have virtually all of Sondheim's shows in my CD collection (yes, I still have a CD collection) and find him to be an unequivocal musical genius.\n\nSondheim was a master craftsman of making musical dialogue just that - a \"dialogue\" or, at least, conversational.\n\nHowever, I am enough of an admirer to recognize which of Sondheim's scores work well (\"Sweeney Todd,\" \"Company\") and which ones tend to fall short of his genius (\"Assassins,\" \"Bounce\").\n\n\"INTO THE WOODS\" tends to fall somewhere in the middle of his catalog, working cleverly on many levels and, probably due mostly to the fairy tale appeal, is arguably one of Sondheim’s most popular works among the average theater going public.\n\nYet, where previous renderings of the show have concentrated on the \"clever\" - this one highlights the hilarity and THANK GOD because it is such a breath of fresh air.\n\n(Photo: Ta'Nika Gibson, Brooke Ishibashi and Nancy Opel share a hysterical moment from Stephen Sondheim andJames Lapine's musical\"INTO THE WOODS\" playing at the Emerson Colonial Theatre through April 2, 2023. Photo Credit: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman for MurphyMade)\n\nAs the musical unfolds, we are guided by a Narrator (David Patrick Kelly) who introduces us to all the fabled characters with whom we are about to become re-acquainted, yet not in the way we might recall them from our youth.\n\nKelly is wonderfully animated on stage, moving between his part of the \"Narrator\" and the \"Mysterious Man\" with tremendous ease.\n\nThe story of \"INTO THE WOODS\" concerns a Baker (Sebastian Arcelus) and his wife (Stephanie J. Block) wishing to have a child but learn they are incapable of conceiving one due to a curse cast upon them by the evil Witch (Montego Glover).\n\nGlover is an unstoppable, unrelenting onstage dynamo in a riveting performance.\n\nShe is everything anyone could ask for from Sondheim's iconic \"Witch\" to be - a flawed, multi-layered character, a commanding presence and a compelling vocalist, dominating every moment she sets foot on stage...and giving us the sense she is just loving it.\n\nSo are we.\n\nBoth Arcelus and Block are absolutely sublime in their respective roles, which helps bond the audience to the rest of this superb cast.\n\nBlock received the night's longest ovation, justly so, for her Act Two rendering of the lyrical, \"Moments in the Woods,\" oozing with a mere sampling of the score's greatest poetry:\n\n\"That's what woods are for:\n\nFor those moments in the woods...\n\nOh, if life were made of moments,\n\nEven now and then a bad one--!\n\nBut if life were only moments,\n\nThen you'd never know you had one.\"\n\nThe Baker and his wife journey through (okay, “into”) the woods in order to find a way of breaking the Witch’s curse.\n\nThere, they meet young Jack (Cole Thompson), who wishes his cow, \"Milky White\" (magnificently handled by puppeteer Kennedy Kanagawa) would give milk.\n\nThompson brings not only a rousing enthusiasm to the role of Jack but also a tender side as he bonds with almost everyone he meets.\n\nAymee Garcia, as \"Jack's Mother,\" shows a more maternal and tender side to the character, at times, which is refreshing (as the character can sometimes come across as a one-dimensional harpy).\n\nKanagawa's performance as the emotive bovine nearly steals every scene in which \"Milky White\" appears.\n\nThe Baker also meets Little Red Ridinghood (Katy Geraghty) who is rescued by the Baker from the evil, manipulative Wolf (Gavin Creel, who also plays Cinderella's Prince).\n\nGeraghty's flawless comedic timing is equaled only by her incredible singing voice.\n\nThe Witch holds young Rapunzel (Alysia Velez) captive in a tall castle room. While she actually loves Rapunzel as a daughter, the Witch keeps the kidnapped girl locked away until another handsome Prince (Jason Forbach) falls in love with Rapunzel and attempts to rescue her.\n\nThen there is Cinderella (Diane Phelan), who wishes to attend a festival being held by the King in honor of his handsome, womanizing son, the Prince (Gavin Creel, who, again, also plays the Wolf - coincidence?).\n\nPhelan gives an inspired portrayal of the \"footwear-challenged\" princess, simply nailing the the Act One, \"On the Steps of the Palace.\"\n\nShe not only brings a wistful element to her character (as in \"when will I find my happiness?\"), she also brings an insatiable inquisitive element to her, as well (as in always wondering, even after she finds her prince, \"what now?\").\n\nThe \"Cinderella\" sub-plot is enhanced, in part, by the brilliantly bombastic supporting comedic performances by Nancy Opel as Cinderella's evil stepmother and Ta'Nika Gibson and Brooke Ishibashi as Cinderella's equally-wretched step-siblings.\n\n(Photo: Stephanie J. Block as \"The Baker’s Wife\" and Sebastian Arcelus as \"The Baker\" inStephen Sondheim andJames Lapine's musical\"INTO THE WOODS\" playing at the Emerson Colonial Theatre through April 2, 2023. Photo Credit: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman for MurphyMade)\n\nCreel serves as a catalyst for much of the humor presented in this interpretation of \"INTO THE WOODS.\"\n\nHe not only serves as a foil for many, the Prince also serves as a walking, talking punchline, simply by his presence. It is a brilliant performance.\n\nThe above is an example of the all-encompassing approach taken with this \"INTO THE WOODS\" production - separating it from anything that has come before.\n\nIn theatre, there is something called a \"brush-up\" or \"pick-up\" rehearsal.\n\nThis tends to take place in the middle of the week, between multiple weekends of performances.\n\nUsually, it is performed sans costumes, lighting, sound, and is mainly performed just by the actors in an effort to help recall lines, blocking, choreography and musical numbers.\n\nActors are always encouraged, if not ordered, to perform these rehearsals \"absolutely straight\" so as to not waste anybody else's valuable time.\n\nNot surprisingly, these rehearsals have a tendency to be performed \"absolutely crooked.\"\n\nActors have been known, on occasion, to play the material for laughs, to take certain liberties with the dialogue, to say or do things they have always wanted to but could not under constraint of the material.\n\nThese rehearsals, while justly scorned by some, sometimes offer a \"release\" for these performers and can, occasionally, bring some uproarious results.\n\nWith this interpretation of \"INTO THE WOODS\" there is almost that same prevailing uproarious \"vibe\" dominating the approach.\n\nThe laughs come every few beats which replaces the normally dark underscoring which can come with other stagings of the show.\n\n(Photo: Gavin Creel in Stephen Sondheim andJames Lapine's musical\"INTO THE WOODS\" playing at the Emerson Colonial Theatre through April 2, 2023. Photo Credit: Matthew Murphy and Evan Zimmerman for MurphyMade)\n\nThe orchestra is on stage. The sets are reduced to a mere few \"trees\" instead of an elaborate, suffocating forest (not that this should be confused as being a \"minimalist\" staging - the set design is both innovative and gorgeous).\n\nThe majority of performances appear more \"concert style\" than staged - but it is absolutely staged and ingeniously so.\n\nIn concurrence with Sondheim's lyrics, the plot written by James Lapine (based on various Grimm’s fairy tales) is intricate with many plotlines played in parallel at first then intersecting in one spot.\n\nSo many plots unfold that, just as you think the musical is coming to a close with a happy ending, it doesn't, then it looks like it might, then it doesn't, then it happens again.\n\nRinse and repeat as needed.\n\nFor many, though, this is not a failing of the piece but, rather, its genius.\n\nIf Lapine and Sondheim had ended the story mere moments before the conclusion of the first act, many would be happy (ever after).\n\nAs it happens, (spoiler alert) the beginning of the second act virtually eviscerates everything that has happened thus far in the story.\n\nThe second act is where a majority of the more \"hard-core Sondheim fans\" actually find the most joy in \"INTO THE WOODS\" - as it deals with the very subjective concept of \"happily ever after\" and completely dismantles it, moment by musical moment.\n\nThose fans would argue that is the very intent of the piece - and they would be absolutely correct.\n\nAs all the fabled stories converge and intertwine, as all the sub-plots become entangled (much like Rapunzel's hair), the characters seek their fairy tale endings...but at what cost?\n\nYes - What happens after “Happily Ever After?\"\n\n\"INTO THE WOODS\" continues at the Emerson Colonial Theatre until April 2nd and absolutely should not be missed.\n\nApproximately 2 hours, 45 minutes with one intermission.\n\nKevin T.
