        "text": "During the 23-24 school year, we hosted 7,000 students as a part of our Student Matinee program! These students experience live, professional theatre, a warm pre-show welcome, and an exclusive post-show Q&A with the cast and crew – all at no cost to them. We love playing a part in inspiring and nurturing students’ curiosity, scholarship, artistry, and creativity. Get a closer look at their experience as we follow three students journey to the Ahmanson Theatre for a student matinee performance of “Funny Girl”.
