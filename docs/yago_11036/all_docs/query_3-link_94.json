        "text": "#10: Taylor Trensch & Ben Levi Ross\n\nDon’t lie – at some point you’ve definitely thought things would be easier if you could just date yourself. These two aren’t technically doing that, but they’re probably about as close as you can get. Taylor Trensch and Ben Levi Ross began dating in December of 2017, and both share something very special in common – they’ve both starred as Evan Hansen in “Dear Evan Hansen.” Taylor took over the role in February of 2018, while Ben understudied multiple male leads on Broadway and took over the titular role on the musical’s first national tour. Their social media presence is adorable, and they released a gorgeous duet from the show in 2019. When your voices blend like that, it must be true love.\n\n#9: Idina Menzel & Taye Diggs\n\nSometimes, even when love ends, the mutual respect and friendship carry on. Idina Menzel and Taye Diggs met all the way back in 1995 during the original Broadway production of “Rent.” They got married in 2003, had a kid in 2009 …. And then separated in 2013 after 10 years of marriage. Both Idina and Taye have openly talked about how the high level of attention was really grueling on them both. But, despite the hardships, the two seem to be killing the co-parenting game. In a 2017 interview with Us Weekly, Taye said the two are completely on the same page, and trust each other. You could say, they take “they each other for who they are” – sorry, we tried.\n\n#8: Patrick Page & Paige Davis\n\nBefore he was the infamous villain of Broadway, before she was hosting “Trading Spaces” on TLC, they were cavorting the night away onstage in “Beauty and the Beast.” While Patrick Page and Paige Davis didn’t TECHNICALLY meet on Broadway – they were on a national tour – their story is anything but provincial. Patrick played Lumiere while Paige played his love interest, the coquettish feather duster Babette. Though Patrick has now become famous for his villainous turns, Paige said he was the “light” of that “Beauty and the Beast” production – and she was definitely drawn to the flame! The two seem to have a really strong relationship and have talked candidly about their decision not to have children. Just an impressive duo all around!\n\n#7: Leslie Odom Jr. & Nicolette Robinson\n\nAnother couple that didn’t technically meet in New York, but we couldn’t pass up this adorable meet-cute. Leslie Odom Jr. and Nicolette Robinson met when she auditioned for an L.A. production of “Once On This Island.” Billy Porter was directing, and Leslie was his assistant director. When Nicolette walked into the room, Leslie was immediately taken with her. She didn’t get the role she auditioned for, but she was later added to the show after one cast member had to leave. As assistant director, Leslie had to get her up to speed – and love blossomed. The two have been married since 2012, and still enjoy working together – you can catch Nicolette in “One Night in Miami...” and many of Leslie’s music videos.\n\n#6: Danny Burstein & Rebecca Luker\n\nThese two had the kind of love you dream about – Danny Burstein and Rebecca Luker met in 1996, but didn’t start dating until about a year and a half later. They were both recently divorced, but their bond stemmed from more than that shared reality – they had found their soulmates. The two were married in 2000 and stayed that way until Rebecca passed away from complications due to ALS in 2020. In 2021, Danny penned a heartbreaking essay in which he wrote about her kindness and her talent. “Her heart shined out of her like a beacon,” he wrote. “She literally had a glow about her.” We wish our best to Danny and Rebecca’s family, and we’re so glad they found each other.\n\n#5: Anthony Ramos & Jasmine Cephas Jones\n\nIn this love story, Peggy finally gets the guy! Anthony Ramos and Jasmine Cephas Jones met during “Hamilton” rehearsals in 2015 – and if Lin Manuel Miranda’s tweets are anything to go by, Anthony couldn’t keep his eyes off Jasmine from the get-go. The two have been pretty public about their relationship, posting supportive notes and supremely adorable Valentine’s Day and birthday messages to each other on their respective socials. They worked together on a movie together in the years after “Hamilton,” and Jasmine even starred in one of Anthony’s music videos in 2018 – please check out the outtakes from that, your heart won’t regret it. When they finally got engaged in 2019, absolutely no one was surprised - congrats to the happy couple!\n\n#4: Audra McDonald & Will Swenson\n\nAudra McDonald is Broadway royalty – so it makes sense she would find a partner as equally regal as her to settle down with. These two met in 2007 when Will understudied Audra’s love interest in the show “110 in the Shade,” but they wouldn’t get together until much later. They’ve kept their relationship pretty under wraps, but tied the knot in 2012 and welcomed a baby girl in 2016. They may keep their personal life quiet, but – lucky for us – they’re usually down to grace us with their ethereal voices. In 2020, they performed a gorgeous rendition of the song “Smile” to raise money for The Actors Fund – beautiful, talented, and giving!\n\n#3: Terrence Mann & Charlotte d’Amboise\n\nThese two might be one of the longest-running couples on our list today – and to hear them tell it, when they met in 1984 they were going at each other like felines! Terrence Mann and Charlotte d’Amboise met during a production of “Cats,” where he was playing Rum Tum Tugger and she was stepping in as Cassandra. Their attraction was instant – in an interview with Playbill in 2015, the two say they never really dated like normal people. They just made out in the tunnels backstage – well, that’s definitely the epitome of a showmance. Obviously, they’ve been able to stoke the flame for all these years – they married in 1996 and still can’t stay away from each other.\n\n#2: Sebastian Arcelus & Stephanie J. Block\n\nMuch like we love it when the Evans fall in love, we also love it when Elphaba and Fiyero fall in love. Sebastian Arcelus and Stephanie J. Block met in 2007 when Sebastian was cast opposite Stephanie as her love interest in “Wicked.” To hear Sebastian tell it, Stephanie knocked him out from the moment he met her. In a 2018 interview with CBS, he says he essentially bought an engagement ring before they even started dating – proof love at first sight exists, we’d say! The two ended up getting married at City Hall before a performance one night so they could sing “As Long As You’re Mine” as a married couple – cute the chorus of “awwws,” please.\n\nBefore we unveil our top pick, here are a few honorable mentions.\n\nNick Adams & Kyle Brown\n\nThe Last Showmance Is Always the Best\n\nBrandon Uranowitz & Zachary Prince\n\nA Fight for a Role Became a Fight for Their Hearts\n\nLaura Osnes & Nathan Johnson\n\nLove Is a Whole New World\n\nKelli Barrett & Jarrod Spector\n\nEveryone Should Find the Sally to Their Harry\n\nChristopher Jackson & Veronica Vazquez Jackson\n\nProof That Love at First Sight Is Real\n\n#1: Andy Karl & Orfeh\n\nYou gotta love a couple that makes it a point to work together as much as they can. Since they met in 2000 in the Broadway adaptation of “Saturday Night Fever,” Andy Karl and Orfeh have been in three shows together – the most memorable of which has to be 2007’s “Legally Blonde.” Orfeh played the plucky, yet tad insecure, Paulette, who has a giant crush on the sexy UPS guy who frequents her salon each day – played by none other than her real-life husband, Andy Karl. The two have fantastic comedic and sexual chemistry, but their off-stage personalities seem to complement each other too. You could say, they make quite the package."
