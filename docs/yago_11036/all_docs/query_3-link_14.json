        "text": "For Stephanie, she was either going to be a nun or a musical theatre actress. She elaborates on this as she looks back on her early days and her influences growing up, including her mom. She reflects on her journey as an actress, moving to New York in her early 20s and being intimidated by the city, leaving and eventually finding her way back. Being involved with the original creation of âWickedâ, Stephanie recalls how she dealt with rejection and why she believes that rejection is protection. She shares more anecdotes, including the two-hour work session she had with Hugh Jackman, meeting her now husband Sebastian Arcelus on the Wicked 1st Natâl Tour, what made her say yes to playing Cher, and getting the right speaking voice for the roleâ¦ with the help of Crest Whitestrips. She also talks about balancing motherhood and a performing career, revealing how they give importance to portraying a sense of teamwork with her family. She recently released a Christmas album called âMerry Christmas, Darlingâ, and shares the process of recording it, while on tour for âInto the Woodsâ.\n\nStephanie J.
