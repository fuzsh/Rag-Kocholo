        "text": "Stephen Sondheim warns to be careful what you wish for in one of his most beloved musicals, Into the Woods. The 2022 New York City Center Encores! Broadway revival became a revolving door for some of today’s biggest musical theatre stars. The run included Sara Bareilles, Cheyenne Jackson, and Brian D’Arcy James. The National tour, which features most of the original revival cast, makes its stop in Chicago at the James M. Nederlander Theatre. Fulfilling a lifelong dream, husband and wife Sebastian Arcelus and Stephanie J. Block lead this cast in the roles of the Baker and the Baker’s Wife. Unfortunately, due to illness in the cast, the Chicago run opened with Ximone Rose as the Baker’s Wife. Rose proved to be a worthy understudy for Block.\n\nInto the Woods in some ways was the first time Grimm’s fairy tales were intermingled to tell an alternative version of the stories we know so well. Since then, there have been numerous books, movies, and TV series to attempt the same idea. Into the Woods may feature fairy tale characters, but it’s not a kids show. The script asks the big question, what happens if every single character got their wish? And the unintended consequences of getting what you think you want.\n\nInto the Woods showcases some of Sondheim’s most beautiful music, and co-writer James Lapine’s most inventive storytelling. This stripped-down version almost looks like a staged concert with the orchestra playing on stage amidst the action. The minimal set and monochromatic costuming allow for the music to be front and center. With voices like Montego Glover as the Witch and Gavin Creel as Cinderella’s Prince and the Big Bad Wolf, this production soars to the rafters.\n\nThere are some plum roles in this show, but none are probably as rewarding as the Witch. Originated by Bernadette Peters in 1987, many big names have filled the cape including Meryl Streep in the 2014 film. Though, you may never again experience the kind of roaring applause and cheering (often reserved for pro sports games), that audiences gave Montego Glover after her hair-raising interpretation of The Last Midnight. The show was held for a few extra seconds while the audience brought down the house.\n\nGavin Creel as Cinderella's Prince/Wolf and Katy Geraghty as Little Red Ridinghood in 'Into the Woods at James M Nederlander Theatre through May 7th\n\nDespite some understudies filling in, there’s not a glimmer of imperfection in this cast. Ellie Fishman went on as Cinderella where she really shines in the show’s final scene. Other than Fishman and Rose, the entire cast performed as listed in the Playbill. Katy Geraghty skipped off with most of the evening’s biggest laughs as Little Red Ridinghood. And of course, any chance you get to see Gavin Creel on stage, take it. He does a great job creating two distinctly different but hilarious characters in the Wolf and Prince Charming. He brings a physical humor that’s only occasionally upstaged by the puppet cow Milky White, helmed by Kennedy Kanagawa.\n\nThere’s so much to love about this definitive revival of Into the Woods. Anyone who’s ever had the misfortune of sitting through a bad community (or high school) production knows that when done poorly, it can be a slog. This production moves along at quite a clip in part to its staging, but it’s a welcomed pace. No moment or song, or sweet section of music overstays its welcome. This Into the Woods would make its creator proud."
