        "text": "American actress and singer (born 1972)\n\nStephanie Janette Block (born September 19, 1972) is an American actress and singer, best known for her work on the Broadway stage.\n\nBlock made her Broadway debut in 2003, originating the role of Liza Minnelli in The Boy from Oz. After reading for the role of Elphaba during the early stages of Wicked in 2000, Block became the first actress to play the role in the show's first U.S. national tour in 2005. She later reprised the role of Elphaba on Broadway from 2007 to 2008.\n\nA three-time Tony Award nominee and six-time Drama Desk Award nominee, Block won the 2019 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical and Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical for her lead performance in The Cher Show. She also received Tony and Drama Desk nominations for her performances in The Mystery of Edwin Drood (2013) and Falsettos (2016). She received Drama Desk nominations for her performances in the Off-Broadway productions of By the Way, Meet Vera Stark (2011) and Little Miss Sunshine (2013), as well as in the Broadway production of 9 to 5 (2009).\n\nAdditionally, Block has appeared on numerous cast recordings and released a solo album, This Place I Know, in 2009. Her television credits include recurring roles on Madam Secretary (2017) and Rise (2018).\n\nBlock starred as The Baker's Wife in a Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim's Into the Woods. She reprised the role in the U.S. national tour. She made her London theatre debut starring in a revival of Kiss Me, Kate in 2024.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nBlock was born on September 19, 1972, in Brea, California, and has one sister, Renée. Her mother, Rosemarie (née Garritano), worked for the local school district, and her father, Steven Block, was a welfare fraud investigator.[1] She was raised Catholic.[2]\n\nOf German and Italian descent,[3] Stephanie grew up in Brea, where she attended St. Angela Merici Parish School (then 1-8, now pre-K through 8). Later she attended an all-girls Catholic private school, Rosary High School (in Fullerton, California), for her secondary education. She finished up her high-school years at the Orange County High School of the Arts.[citation needed]\n\nActing career\n\n[edit]\n\nBlock started her professional musical theater career with regional theater, appearing in many productions including Funny Girl, Crazy for You, Oliver!, James Joyce's The Dead, and Bells Are Ringing. Block was additionally the original Belle in the Disneyland production of Beauty and the Beast and did voice work for numerous commercials, including the singing voice of Barbie.\n\nIn early 2000, Block read the part of Elphaba in the first reading of the new musical Wicked. After a few months of reading, she was replaced by Idina Menzel, a decision that left Block devastated, but accepting of the decision that had been made to cast a more experienced performer in the role.[4] She was Menzel's understudy in the San Francisco tryout in 2003, but she left the show prior to Broadway when she was offered a lead role in a new Broadway musical, The Boy from Oz.[5]\n\nBlock made her Broadway debut in 2003, playing the role of Liza Minnelli opposite Hugh Jackman's Peter Allen in the show. The show received mixed reviews but proved to be a hit with audiences, playing on Broadway for close to a year. The musical received several Tony Award nominations, including a nomination for Best Musical.[6]\n\nIn spring 2005, Block originated the role of Elphaba in the first national tour of Wicked. She was awarded both the 2006 Helen Hayes Award and the 2007 Carbonell Award for Best Actress in a Non-Resident Production for this role. Block received great reviews for a show-stopping performance. After performing with the tour for a year, Block left the production in March 2006 and was replaced by Julia Murney.\n\nIn 2007 Block performed in the title role of the new Broadway musical The Pirate Queen, with music written by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil. Block was praised by critics, such as Ben Brantley from The New York Times, for giving a \"truly felt, realistic, performance\".[7] Plagued by insufficient ticket sales and harsh reviews, the show opened in April and barely played for two months at the Hilton Theatre, closing in June.[8] Later that year Block reprised the role of Elphaba in Wicked on Broadway beginning October 9, 2007, where she replaced Julia Murney. She left the production after eight months, on June 15, 2008, and was succeeded by Kerry Ellis.[9]\n\nBlock starred alongside Allison Janney, Megan Hilty, and Marc Kudisch in the musical adaptation of the 1980 film 9 to 5. The production was directed by Joe Mantello with music written by Dolly Parton. The show opened on Broadway in April 2009 at the Marquis Theatre and closed in September 2009. Block starred as Judy Bernly, the frazzled divorcée, the role played by Jane Fonda in the film. For this role Block was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical.[10]\n\nIn 2009, Block released her debut album through PS Classics titled This Place I Know.
