        "text": "It takes three women to portray one superstar through the decades in the new Broadway musical “The Cher Show.” Meet the threesome strong enough to take up the challenge.\n\nStephanie J. Block\n\nIt wasn’t just studying dozens of YouTube videos that helped Stephanie J. Block capture Cher’s speech pattern. It wasn’t the vocal coach from Juilliard, either.\n\nThe oral care nailed it.\n\n“One day I was running lines with Crest White Strips on my teeth and I found the voice,” said Ms. Block, who portrays the pop star in “The Cher Show” on Broadway. She slipped into the singer’s immediately recognizable crushed-velvet contralto: “I was like, ‘Are you kidding me? Holy crap, I found Cher through Crest White Strips? This is insane!’ ”\n\nIn the new musical, which opens on Dec. 3 at the Neil Simon Theater, Ms. Block, 46, takes on the older incarnation of Cher, dubbed Star, while Micaela Diamond portrays the youngest version, Babe, and Teal Wicks handles the middle years as Lady. The Donna Summer bio-musical “Summer” also splits its titular role among three performers, but “The Cher Show,” written by Rick Elice (“Jersey Boys”), and directed by Jason Moore (“Avenue Q”), features more interaction between the different avatars, who share the stage for extended periods of time, trade verses and choruses of a single song, and banter with each other. And all three even get to poke affectionate fun at Sonny Bono (Jarrod Spector).\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
