What do you all think? Orestes Fasting\n\nWhile I'd love to see it, I have the feeling that the sheer awesomeness of Stephanie J. Block would not fit into a role with 20 minutes of stage time. And if you bottle up pure awesome for too long, it will eventually explode--and I don't think Cammack would want to foot the bill for the renovations to the Broadhurst. mastachen\n\nI think SJB could make a really good Fantine. I didn't really like her Elphaba though, but I think she has potential as a Fantine.\n\nCome to think of it, I'm so turned off as her performance as Elphaba that she might as well just let someone else be Fantine, and then take her bullet boy part.

Orestes Fasting\n\nI don't think Lea's awesome is explosive. I mean, all I've actually seen of Stephanie is two songs at a cabaret, and even then she knocked me over the head with how amazing she was. Lea's good, but she never had that effect on me.\n\nI would love to see Sebastian Arcelus as Marius or Enjolras though. lesmisloony\n\nOoh, when I saw Wicked in Toronto I was supposed to see Stephanie J Block, but I think she hurt her shoulder (?) during dress rehearsal and we ended up seeing an understudy.\n\nBUT when I saw Wicked in NYC last summer I'm pretty sure we saw Sebastian Arcelus as Fiyero. At least, his first name was Sebastian and he played Fiyero, so I'm assuming it was the same guy. How many Sebastian-Fiyeros are there? ...is that the right way to pluralize Fiyero?\n\nThis is... a really pointless post. I'm sorry... *resists the urge to ramble further* Trevor\n\nIf you would have seen her in Pirate Queen (which unfortunately... nobody in the world besides me did... haha) you would agree that she would be a great Fantine.\n\nBut yeah. She is by FAR one of my favorite current performers. lesmisloony\n\nTrevor... I just have to take a moment to say how much I love your signature. It makes me laugh. ...I'm sure my love for Montparnasse isn't extremely obvious..."
