It was a time when everyone was convinced there was a bomb with their name on it, compelling them to ignore traditional morals and live like there was no tomorrow. It was a time when gas masks were worn with lingerie. A time when the police, busy with far more serious matters, let London’s most popular nightclub, Café de Paris, become a place to drink, dance, indulge and hopefully forget you were going to die.\n\nTICKETS\n\nNo reservations or advance tickets. Admission is by donation ($15 suggested).\n\nMEET YOUR PLAYWRIGHT\n\nSCOOTER PIETSCH’s 8th appearance at The Road Theatre’s Summer Playwrights Festival. LONDON UNDONE is currently being setup for a workshop in London early 2019. His play WINDFALL (The Road 2012), directed by Tony-Winner Jason Alexander, had a sold out run in its world premiere in 2016 at The Arkansas Repertory Theater. Tony-Winning producer Ken Davenport and producer John Yonover are negotiating multiple productions. Readings of WINDFALL in NYC and LA have featured Tony-Winner Michelle Pawk, Justin Bartha, Brandon Dirden, Jack Coleman, Allison Mack, Spencer Grammer, Nate Corrdry, Nancy Travis, Jennifer Morrison and many others. THE COCKTAIL PARTY EFFECT (The Road 2016) was featured in Bay Street Theater’s New Works Festival 2017 (Sag Harbor), directed by Jen Wineman and featured Tony-Winner Faith Prince, Stephanie J. Block, Marc Kudisch and Sebastian Arcelus. Production of the play is currently being discussed. Past readings of his plays have included performances by Tony-Winner and four-time Emmy-Winner Bryan Cranston, Tony-Winner Cady Huffman, Constance Zimmer, Jerry O’Connell, Gale Harold and many, many others. Scooter was the dramaturg for productions of DEE SNIDER’S ROCK N ROLL CHRISTMAS TALE in Chicago and Toronto. As a composer, Scooter’s underscore, theme music and songs have appeared in over 100 TV series and thousands of TV episodes and lots of movies. Some of these include Pretty Little Liars, Burn Notice, All Dogs Go To Heaven, Greek, American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance. He has also created and executive produced shows for ABC, FOX, Lifetime, VH1 and E!.\n\nAn Interview with Playwright Scooter Pietsch\n\n1: What is the name of your play?\n\nLondon Undone\n\n2: What was your first job in the theatre?\n\nAs a composer. I wrote music for various college productions.\n\n3: Do you ever model characters after real life people?\n\nThere’s a little something from the people in my life in every character I write. Never a whole person, just the interesting bits and pieces. It makes characters seem more real to me.\n\n4: As an artist, what subjects tend to draw your interest?\n\nStories where people are experiencing the best and worst at the same time. In my opinion, that is how life works. It’s never just all good or all bad. It’s always a mix. And the conflict that arises from that makes a story for me.\n\n5: Do you have other passions aside from playwriting?\n\nDoes drinking count? I do it often and thoroughly enjoy it. Sounds like a hobby to me.\n\n6: Are you currently working on any new projects?\n\nAlways! I have a new play called “Let The Righteous Be Glad And Rejoice.” I chose that title because it was the longest one I could think of.\n\n7: Here’s a fun question! What is your favorite dessert?\n\nHere’s a boring answer! I rarely eat dessert. Not a big fan of sweets. (I can feel the judgement being hurled my way!)"
