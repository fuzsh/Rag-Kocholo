        "text": "Part C of this Data Privacy Statement applies to the processing of personal data when using our website, www.petersenhardrahtpruggmayer.de. It does not cover the websites of other providers to which there are links on our website.\n\n1. Log files\n\nWhen you visit our website, the browser used on your device automatically sends information to our website’s server. This information is stored temporarily in a so-called “log file”. The following information is collected without any action on your part and will be stored until automatically deleted:\n\nIP address of the requesting computer\n\nDate and time of the visit,\n\nName and URL of the downloaded file\n\nWebsite from which the site was accessed (referrer URL)\n\nType and version of the browser used and the operating system of your device\n\nQuantity of data sent\n\nName of your access provider\n\nThis data will never be associated with data relating to you from other sources.\n\nWe process the above stored data for the following purposes:\n\nTo ensure that there are no problems in establishing a connection with the website\n\nTo ensure that our website is convenient to use\n\nTo evaluate system security and stability\n\nFor administrative purposes\n\nFor statistics\n\nTo detect and monitor spam, viruses and attacks on our server, and\n\nTo evaluate and improve the content of our website\n\nThis data will not be used for any other purpose. We will never use it to identify you as an individual.\n\nThe legal basis for this data processing is point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR. Our legitimate interest is based on the purposes of the data collection listed above.\n\nRecorded data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer needed for the purposes stated above.\n\n2. Cookies\n\nWe use cookies on our website. These are small files that your browser automatically creates when you visit our website and that are stored on your device (PC, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.). A cookie contains a characteristic string that acts as a unique identifier for your browser when you visit our website again. However, it does not provide us with any direct knowledge of your identity. Cookies cause no damage to your device and do not contain any viruses, Trojan horses or other malicious software.\n\nAs the user, you have complete control over the use of cookies. By changing the settings in your browser, you can disable the transfer of cookies at any time or restrict it so that a message always appears before a new cookie is created. Cookies that have already been saved can be deleted at any time. This can also be done automatically. If you disable cookies for our website, you may not be able to use all features in their full scope.\n\nWe only use cookies that are technically necessary. Their purpose is to make it possible and easier to use our website. Some of the website’s features cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For these features to function, the user’s browser must be recognised even after switching websites. The user data collected by technically necessary cookies will not be used to create user profiles.\n\nWe require the technically necessary cookies only to apply your choice of language settings. The following data will be stored and transmitted to this end:\n\nYour choice of language settings\n\nThe legal basis for the processing of personal data where we use technically necessary cookies is point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR. Our legitimate interest in processing your personal data as required under this provision is also based on the above purposes.\n\nThe technically necessary cookies that we use are automatically deleted no later than one year after visiting our site.\n\n3. Matomo (formerly Piwik) analysis tool\n\nFor analysis purposes, we use the open-source Matomo Analytics software provided by InnoCraft Ltd., 150 Willis St, 6011 Wellington, New Zealand, on our website. This also uses cookies. The information about the use of the website generated by the cookie is sent to our server, where it is summarised in pseudonymised user profiles.\n\nMatomo generates a user ID and a session ID that are saved as cookies in the user’s browser. However, the final bytes of your IP address are automatically pseudonymised in the process. The same applies to the Matomo geolocation feature. This means that only pseudonymised data is stored and processed from the outset. We cannot use this information to identify you, and it is not associated with any other data on you as an individual.\n\nWe use Matomo in order to ensure that the design of our website is fit for purpose and to continually optimise it. We also use Matomo in order to record use of our website statistically and to evaluate it.\n\nThe legal basis for the use of Matomo is point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR. Our legitimate interest in processing your personal data as required under this provision is also based on the above purposes.\n\nWhen using this feature, you may need to disable Matomo in the same way each time you visit our website. You will not be able to use this function if you have disabled all cookies in your browser, but neither will a tracking cookie be set from the outset.\n\nThe use of Matomo on our website also allows the use of the Do Not Track feature in current web browsers. If you have selected this setting in your browser, you will not need to manually disable tracking by Matomo each time you visit our website. In all other respects, the general information in Point 2 on cookies applies to your options for deleting such cookies.\n\n4. XING and LinkedIn\n\nWe do not use plug-ins for social media networks on our website. The corresponding buttons for XING and LinkedIn merely serve as links to third-party websites. The Data Privacy Statements for these websites apply to their use.\n\n5. Google Maps\n\nWe use Google Maps on our website. This enables us to display interactive maps to you directly on our website and allows you to use the map function for your convenience, for example to produce directions. The legal basis for embedding Google Maps is point (f) of Article (6)(1) GDPR.\n\nWhen you visit our website, Google receives the information that you have accessed the corresponding page of our website. In addition, the data specified in Point 2 of this statement is transmitted. This occurs regardless of whether or not you have a user account with Google and are logged into it. If you are logged into Google, your data will be directly associated with your account. If you do not want to be associated with your Google profile, you must log out before activating the button. Google stores your data as usage profiles and uses it for the purposes of advertising, market research and/or the needs-based design of its website. Such an evaluation is conducted in particular (even if users are not logged in) in order to support needs-based advertising and to inform other Google users about your activities on our website. You have the right to object to the creation of these user profiles; however, you must contact Google in order to exercise this right.\n\nYou can find further information about the scope and purpose of data collection and processing, as well as about data protection, data and security in the Privacy Policy of the controller of the data processing – Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA – in the Google Maps Terms of Service and at privacy.google.com. These policies also contain further information on your rights in this context and the settings to protect your privacy. You can also submit a Google Maps API privacy request by using this form.\n\nGoogle also processes your personal data in the United States and has submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield, https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework.\n\nWe provide you with various options for personal communication, for instance if you are interested in our services or wish to contact us regarding a collaboration.\n\n1. Email addresses\n\nIf you contact us by email, we will store the information that you provide (at a minimum your email address and where applicable your name, phone number and any other information that you have provided voluntarily) in order to reply to your request.\n\nData is processed for the purpose of making contact in accordance with point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR on the basis of your freely granted consent.\n\nWe will delete the data generated in connection with this as soon as its storage is no longer required in order to process your request, or we will restrict its processing if there is a statutory duty to retain it.\n\n2. Events\n\nOur website contains a form that we provide for you to express interest in the events we stage. The following information is mandatory for this:\n\nName of the event\n\nSurname, first name\n\nCompany name\n\nEmail address\n\nPhone number\n\nYou can voluntarily add additional information or questions in the additional “Your message” field.\n\nAll this data will be used solely for the preparation and hosting of the event that you have enquired about.\n\nIf you declare that you would also like to be notified of future events, your personal data including your email address will be used for the purpose of informing you about events that you advised us are of interest to you.\n\nData is processed for the above purposes in accordance with point (b) of Article 6(1) GDPR for the performance of a contract and also in accordance with point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR on the basis of your freely granted consent.\n\nYour data will be deleted without delay as soon as the event has been held and completed. If you have declared that you also wish to be notified of future events, we will delete your data immediately after you withdraw your consent or after you object to this use of your data.\n\n3. Transmission of information\n\nWe would also like to use some of your data (title, first name, last name, business or home address, email address, telephone and fax numbers) to inform you about our legal and tax services and interesting legal developments and to invite you to specialist and other events that we hold. We mainly use email and post for this purpose, where applicable also telephone or fax, on the basis of your express consent and depending on the communication channel that you selected when registering for an event or within the scope of our legitimate interest.\n\nThe legal basis for this is point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR where you have granted your explicit consent, or in all other cases, our legitimate interest in the transmission of information under point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR.\n\nYou can object to or withdraw the consent you have granted to the use of your data for this purpose at any time and without any special conditions apply. This objection or withdrawal can apply to all use or only in part, for example to a particular form of contact. To exercise this right, all you need to do is send an email to info@phplaw.de or use the link provided in our email for this purpose.\n\nIf you object or withdraw your consent, we will immediately delete your data or restrict its use in accordance with your request with effect for the future. We may store the fact that you have objected or withdrawn your consent to ensure that you will no longer be contacted.\n\n4. Job applications\n\nWe will also process your personal data if you contact us regarding a possible collaboration with us, in particular in the context of a job application. In this case, we will collect and store the following information:\n\nTitle, first name, last name\n\nPlace of birth\n\nDate of birth\n\nNationality\n\nEmail address\n\nHome address\n\nPhone number (landline and/or mobile) and fax number\n\nInformation on your professional qualifications and school education\n\nInformation on your further professional development, and\n\nOther information that you send to us in connection with your application\n\nThis is necessary for us to be able to reach a decision on establishing a contractual or employment relationship with you, and it occurs in particular in order to record and review your application, to conduct research, including with the aid of career-related information that you have made publicly available on social media, to conduct job interviews and to notify you of our decision. There is no automated decision-making within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR.\n\nThe legal basis for this is Article 88 GDPR and Section 26(1) BDSG [Federal Data Protection Act] and, if you have consented to further storage for possible future consideration of your application, point (a) of Article 6(1) GDPR.\n\nIn addition, we may process your personal data if this is necessary for the defence of legal claims asserted against us arising from the application process. The legal basis for this is point (f) of Article 6(1) GDPR. The burden of proof in proceedings under the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG) constitutes an example of a legitimate interest.\n\nWe will store your data for up to 6 months after a rejection or until you withdraw your consent if you have given your consent to further storage for possible future consideration. If applications are accepted, we will store your data in your human resources file until 3 years after the termination of the collaboration."
