        "text": "Stefan Heym: Collin. Munich: Bertelsmann, 1979. 400 pp. (English translation: London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1980.)\n\nWhile not a spy story, Collin does have certain similarities to, say, Smiley’s People – chiefly the intense pressure that is felt by the “good guys” as well as the bad, such that everyone in a position of authority ends up compromised. Stefan Heym, at the time of composition a prominent East German author, shows the debilitating effects to be both psychological and physical.\n\nHis protagonist, Hans Collin, is a celebrated, aging author living in East Berlin who one day suffers a heart attack. While recuperating in an exclusive sanatorium, he engages in discussions with a fellow patient, none other than spy chief Wilhelm Urack (based on Stasi boss Erich Mielke); he also falls a bit in love (in a fatherly sort of way) with one of the younger doctors, Christine.\n\nAt one point, Urack tries to recruit Christine to be an IM (Inoffizielle Mitarbeiter, someone who agrees to spy on family, friends, and acquaintances). The offer seems attractive: “… in truth there was something enticing to it: to be permitted into the club of those who took responsibility for the welfare of the masses, to belong to the circle of the initiated who received restricted information and shared in the making of decisions, be they ever so modest – instead of having to run in the daily treadmill, blind like a mole, frustrated like a caged hamster” (English version, 179). Rather quickly, though, she decides to decline the invitation. After all, she is in the early stages of an affair with Urack’s grandson, a rock musician who finds life behind the wall intolerable.\n\nThe main thread of the plot, though, involves the inner struggle of the writer who faces a choice, whether to continue to write novels filled with half-truths that support his comfortable existence, or finally to set forth the truth as he knows it. Rejecting Urack’s view that “doubt is a luxury we cannot afford,” he resolves to write his memoirs and at last come clean about his complicity in betraying colleagues and covering up what really happened. In so doing, he embarks on a potentially life-threatening investigation.\n\nHis medical condition, by the way, illustrates something once said by Soviet dissident Evgenia Ginzburg: “When you can’t sleep, the knowledge that you did not directly take part in the murders and betrayals is no consolation. After all, the assassin is not only he who struck the blow, but whoever supported the evil, no matter how: by thoughtless repetition of dangerous political theories, by silently raising his right hand; by faint-heartedly writing half-truths.” (Within the Whirlwind)\n\nOne thing Heym does nicely is to change the narrative perspective, interspersing the story of Collin with quotations from the diary of his own private Mephistopheles, Theodor Pollock (shades of Magic Mountain – quite consciously intended on Heym’s part), the one who encourages Collin to write his memoirs, thus bringing on his health crisis. When it comes to this character, Heym subtly modifies the tone as well. Pollock, based on the cultural critic Stefan Hermlin, writes in a self-consciously dignified, professorial style. While he calls them “notes,” someone as aware of his own importance as Pollock is not the sort to make private jottings – he is fully confident that some day they will be published and read by a wider public, and as a result he formulates his thoughts in a carefully elevated register used by no one else in the book.\n\nAnother nice touch is Collin’s self-quotation from one of his own earlier novels about communist anti-fascists who had fought against Franco in Spain, only to find themselves interned by the French in Le Vernet on the eve of the German invasion. Most of them never escaped; what’s more, they strictly followed orders that originated in Moscow and so did not even try to get away. One purpose of this interlude is to reveal Collin’s past compromises: when earlier in his career he had written about this sensitive topic in the DDR he could not openly place the responsibility where it really lay – with the Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact of 1939, which overnight made Nazi Germany Stalin’s partner.\n\nOne result of this pact was that, once the champagne corks had been popped in the Kremlin, the communists outside the USSR essentially became political orphans, abandoned by their chief protector who was now working together with their main enemy. For nearly two years, until June 1941, they wandered in the desert; even as devoted a follower as Kim Philby felt abandoned. Then, with Hitler’s attack on the Soviet Union, they came back into the fold. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, the 22-month alliance between Hitler and Stalin was all but erased from the official memory. In East Berlin in the 1970s, I met DDR patriots – good communists all – who had never heard of it, though they were well informed about – and eager to denounce – 19th-century America’s criminal mistreatment of the Sioux (a tribe whose name they pronounced “See-Ox”).\n\nSo for an East German author to address the plight of these abandoned comrades, even after Khrushchev’s famous secret speech, remained at best problematic, at worst taboo. The topic could only be broached if the author was willing to make compromises, and Collin had always complied. After all, the alternative was to remain unpublished – a dilemma faced by many DDR writers. It’s not that they lied necessarily, it’s just that they left certain things unsaid or unexplained.\n\nThe key incident in Collin’s memoir deals with one of these forgotten martyrs of a forgotten cause, Julius Faber, one of the few who managed to escape from Le Vernet and survive the war. After 1945, he returned from his Mexican exile to take over state management of agriculture in the DDR. When the unrealistic quotas could not be met, he was abruptly fired from his ministerial post. At a dramatic party meeting, Faber is denounced as a class enemy. Collin fails to speak up in his defense, even though he knows him to be innocent. One is reminded of the Czech poet Jaroslav Seifert, who said that for anybody else, keeping silent can be a tactical maneuver. But a writer who stays silent is lying.\n\nLater, Faber is reduced to managing a restaurant in the provincial East German city of Priegnitz. One day Collin drops by for a visit and happens to witness his arrest at the hands of the secret police, who look and act more like common thugs. Instead of intervening, Collin flees. Faber ends up convicted and imprisoned for a few years before being released, a broken man. (After his post-war show trial, Paul Merker, the historical figure on whom Faber is based, found work at the HO Restaurant Turmeck in Luckenwalde. Another character on whom he is partially based, Walter Janka, once came to Heym to give him tips on how to survive if the authorities ever had him arrested and imprisoned [Stefan Heym: Nachruf, 789]) All of which goes to show that never was there a political organization so infested by enemy agents in their ranks as the communists. Or at least so they thought.\n\nIn the end, there were two possible fates that awaited dissidents behind the Iron Curtain: either that of a cast-out (Faber’s “voodoo-death”), or that of ongoing spiritual self-castration (Collin’s writer’s block). The dramatic tension in the novel comes from the protagonist’s desperate search for a third way. Confined to his hospital room, Collin resolves to set down an honest account of his life, then lock it away until it can be published posthumously.\n\nThe decision to write for the desk drawer is not the decision made by Stefan Heym. In this brave book he stepped forward and announced that he was through with tip-toeing around politically sensitive topics. When Collin could not get official permission in the East, it was published in West Germany in 1979, and the author suffered the consequences: exclusion from the writer’s union and a reduction in his benefits (though he was probably expecting worse). The novel finally appeared in the East in 1990, just as the curtain was coming down. By the way, to Heym belongs the honor of having the DDR’s single biggest Stasi file.\n\nFinally, there is one scene in the novel that would be easy to pass over without paying much attention. Nina, Collin’s wife, and Gerlinger, his doctor, are touring the Zwinger museum in Dresden one day. Gerlinger points out a collection of Chinese vases that Poland’s King August the Strong had acquired in the early 18th century from the King of Prussia, Frederick William I, in exchange for some 600 cavalrymen. It was a bargain, the doctor says, for who thinks of those dragoons anymore, while the exquisite vases have survived?\n\nThis might just seem like flirtatious museum-talk, until at the end of it Nina remarks, “Thank God these days people are no longer bought and sold, at least not with us.” And then one realizes with a start that of course the DDR did something very similar: It locked up dissidents and held them until the West Germans bought their freedom. Suddenly the whole conversation in the museum takes on a new light; Heym isn’t talking just about 1717, he’s also talking about the 1970s. It took some courage for an East German author to touch, even indirectly, on this taboo.\n\nMarkus Wolf, the Stasi counterespionage chief, confirmed that such trades took place in his memoirs. “The calculus was cold and simple: We traded people for goods, which we could then use ourselves or resell for hard currency. Between 1964 and 1990 the GDR released over 33,000 political prisoners and over 215,000 citizens to reunify families, and received payments from the West of more than 3.4 billion deutschmarks.” (Markus Wolf: Man Without a Face, 1997, pg. 120)\n\nPersonal Note\n\nIn 1994 Stefan Heym gave a reading in the Knaackstrasse bookstore in the Prenzlauer Berg district of East Berlin. Afterwards I approached him to ask about his memories of W.E.B. Du Bois, on whom I was doing research; he deflected the question by saying it was his wife, Gertrude Gelbin, who had handled all such matters. Gelbin was chief editor of Seven Seas, part of Volk und Welt publishing house, which was responsible for English-language literature in the GDR, including one of Du Bois’ last books, An ABC of Color. For more, see my essay on Du Bois in the GDR, “Censoring Your Ally,” in Crosscurrents: African-Americans, Africa and Germany in the Modern World, ed. David McBride, Leroy Hopkins (Camden House, 1998), pp. 197-232. The second part of that essay, focusing on the translation (into German and Russian) of Du Bois’ Autobiography, has been published in Lebende Sprachen 64/1 (2019).\n\nBelow are two pictures I took of Heym after the reading. They are published here (slightly cropped) for the first time. The originals are now at the Stefan Heym center at Cambridge University.\n\nTranslation\n\nA few years ago, I recommended Collin to a friend of mine. Since he doesn’t know German, he read the translation, but put it aside after getting less than half-way through. I was curious to find out more – after all, this friend is a discriminating reader whose judgment I trust.\n\nSo I started reading Collin in English, and quickly noticed that something was not quite right. I compared the original German Collin with the English, which has led me to this hypothesis: As a refugee in America, Heym had begun his career writing in English. He continued writing in this language for many years after resettling in East Germany (1953). Eventually, though, he began to write not just his essays but even his literary works in German. Though still fluent, gradually he lost touch with his second language. This is especially true after the death of his wife, Gertrude Gelbin, in 1969; as a native speaker, she had helped edit and polish his English. Another factor to consider: Heym worked on the “englische Fassung” of this novel while laid up in the Charité Hospital in Berlin (Nachruf, 924) – hardly ideal circumstances. Thus by the time he completed Collin in the late 1970s, Heym’s connection to the language was so tenuous that he botched his own translation.\n\nRather than go through the book line by line, I propose a simple quiz: For each sentence that follows, ask yourself: Which sounds more natural, more idiomatic, more like it was written by a native speaker? Answers at the end (don’t peek!).\n\n1. Christine is in conversation with her ex, who criticizes Collin for never questioning anything. When she challenges him on this, he responds:\n\na. “Since I do not write books, I can spare myself the trouble of doubting the validity of each current wisdom.”\n\nb. “Since I’m not a writer, I don’t have to bother with doubting whatever currently passes for wisdom.”\n\n“Da ich keine Bücher schreibe, kann ich mir sparen, das jeweils Gültige anzuzweifeln.” (S. 28, pg. 24)\n\n2. Christine’s son wants to greet his father, who is divorced from his mother.\n\na. Wölfchen started out as though to embrace him.\n\nb. Wölfchen took a step towards his father as though to embrace him.\n\nWölfchen machte eine Bewegung auf seinen Vater zu […] (S. 30, pg. 25)\n\n3. A doctor is addressing his patient.\n\na. “Now stop breathing.”\n\nb. “Now hold your breath.”\n\n“Jetzt bitte nicht mehr atmen.” (S. 54, pg. 44)\n\n4. In the novel Collin wrote about the Spanish Civil War, a character (based on Collin himself) wants to get rid of a piece of paper that might incriminate him in the eyes of the Gestapo.\n\na. He reaches for the slip in his pocket and crushes it.\n\nb. He reaches for the slip in his pocket and crumples it up.\n\nEr greift nach dem Zettel, zerknüllt ihn. (S. 68, pg. 55; curiously enough, a few pages later the same word is translated as “crumpled” [S. 71, pg. 57]. BTW, a similar story is told by Kim Philby in the opening pages of his memoir, My Silent War, which also deal with his adventures in Spain during the Civil War.)\n\n5. Christine is lying in bed, unable to sleep because of the day’s events.\n\na. It all might have happened long ago, she thought, but it still disquieted her; when did the past turn into real past and when did the present set in, and where lay the roots of either?\n\nb. It all might have happened long ago, she thought, but still it bothered her; past, present – where did one start, where did the other end, and what about their roots?\n\nDas war alles schon lange her, dachte sie wieder, und betraf sie doch; Vergangenheit, Gegenwart, wo setzt das eine ein, wo hörte das andere auf, wo liegen die Wurzeln? (S. 72, pg. 58)\n\n6. Collin’s wife is having a conversation with his chief doctor about the appropriateness of having a younger doctor like Christine treat her husband, Hans, saying she believes “this Doctor Roth” is no good for him. The chief replies that she is a very capable physician. The wife then says:\n\na. “The same, almost literally, I was told by Hans.”\n\nb. “Hans told me the same, almost word for word.”\n\n“Das hat mir Hans auch gesagt. Wörtlich.” (S. 101, pg. 81)\n\n7. Theodor Pollock, the author and critic, is writing in his notebook about a conversation he had with Prof. Keres (based on Georg Lukacs).\n\na. … certainly I, too, must have asked myself at some time if I wouldn’t have done better to stay elsewhere or wouldn’t do better even now to leave and find another habitat…\n\nb. … certainly I, too, must have asked myself now and then if I wouldn’t have done better to find somewhere else to stay, or if even now it wouldn’t be better to go and live somewhere else…\n\n… bestimmt hätte auch ich gelegentlich Überlegungen angestellt, ob ich nicht besser daran getan hätte, anderswo zu bleiben, oder auch jetzt noch besser daran täte, anderswohin zu gehen… (S. 108, pg. 87)\n\nAdmittedly, Pollock is a special case, because his tone is more self-consciously elevated than that of any other character. So some leeway should be granted if he sounds self-important. It may well be that Heym decided to make his speech even more inflated in English than in German.\n\n8. In his room at the clinic, Urack is mulling things over.\n\na. … a man wasn’t like a piece of vegetable that lived its drowsy life in some plot of garden.\n\nb. … a man wasn’t like some vegetable that drowsed its life away in a garden plot.\n\n… der Mensch war doch nicht wie ein Stück Gemüse, das im Beet vor sich hindröselte…” (S. 116, pg. 94)\n\n9. Christine is thinking about the best treatment for Urack.\n\na.… it would be a wonder, however, if she, Frau Doctor Roth, could for once get him to relax…\n\nb. … it would be a miracle, though, if she, Frau Doctor Roth, could get him to relax for once…\n\n… ein Wunder wäre es vielmehr, wenn sie, die Frau Doktor, ihn einmal wenigstens zum Abschalten brächte… (S. 131, pg. 105)\n\n10. Christine and Collin are discussing the psychological impact of the show trials, in which the ritual is reenacted of a tribe sacrificing a scapegoat; she asks, “Who can stand this?” To which he replies…\n\na. “Who can stand the other – the self-imposed curbs, the sterility, the hollow glory?”\n\nb. “Who can stand the alternative – the self-imposed limits, the sterility, the empty glory?”\n\n“Aber wer hält das andere aus, die selbstangelegte Kandare, die Sterilität, den hohlen Ruhm?” (S. 164, pg. 131)\n\n11. Dr. Gerlinger enters the room of Mrs. Havelka, one of his patients. He greets her by saying,\n\na. “I am told you were having a brief walk in the fresh air…”\n\nb. “I hear you took a little walk outside, got some fresh air…”\n\n“… ich höre, Sie haben einen kleinen Spaziergang unternommen…” (S. 184, pg. 146)\n\n12. Later in the same chapter, Collin has an awkward conversation with Mr. Havelka, who finally demands:\n\na. “Why do you excite yourself?”\n\nb. “What are you getting upset for?”\n\n“Was erregst du dich?” (S. 192, pg. 152)\n\n13. This chapter ends with Nurse Gundula bringing Collin his supper while Christine is still talking with him. Christine tells her to come back later, adding …\n\na. “I shall call you.”\n\nb. “I’ll call you.”\n\nc. “I’ll let you know when.”\n\n“Später, Schwester,” sagte Christine, “ich gebe Ihnen Bescheid.” (S. 200, pg. 159)\n\n14. In the next chapter, Christine is thinking about her living arrangements – if her ex-husband moved out, her boyfriend could move in. But…\n\na. … this needed weighing carefully.\n\nb. … this called for careful consideration.\n\n… so etwas will überlegt sein. (S. 203, pg. 163)\n\n15. After making love with Peter, Christine decides to go back to her apartment, and wants to know if he will accompany her. He tells her that even if she leaves without him, she will still have an escort – a reference to the Stasi agents who always follow him, and who are parked outside. At first, however, she doesn’t understand what he means. A gesture she makes is described in this phrase:\n\na. … as she questioningly raised her head…\n\nb. … as she threw him a questioning look…\n\n… da sie fragend den Kopf hob… (S. 204, pg. 163)\n\n16. A governmental official so important he can only be referred to by his first name, Curd (based on Johannes R. Becher), invites some leading lights of the literary scene to his place so they can discuss how best to rescue Prof. Keres (Lukacs). Collin thinks:\n\na. I again have that feeling that things grow transparent. I could see the thoughts forming behind Curd’s forehead.\n\nb. Again I get the feeling that things are transparent. I could see the thoughts taking shape in Curd’s head.\n\nDie Transparenz ist wieder da, mir ist, als sähe ich, wie die Gedanken sich formen in seinem Schädel. (S. 243, pg. 193)\n\n17. In a conversation with Collin, Christine becomes annoyed with herself for losing focus.\n\na. … you never could be careful enough in your dealings with the patient Collin, you never for a moment could let your thoughts go astray.\n\nb. … you could never be too careful when dealing with this patient, could never let your mind wander, not for a moment\n\n… nie konnte man vorsichtig genug sein im Umgang mit dem Patienten Collin, nie durfte man da die Gedanken schweifen lassen. (S. 251, pg. 199)\n\n18. She then explains to him the purpose of the injections she gave him.\n\na. “… they couldn’t be more than a beginning.”\n\nb. “… they were just the start.”\n\n“… das war doch nur ein Anfang.” (S. 251, pg. 199)\n\n19. At the end of this chapter, Collin tells her that a scene in his novel is meant ironically.\n\na. “… and the fall guy in the case, after all, was I!”\n\nb. “… and the fall guy ended up being me!”\n\n“… und der Genarrte war schließlich ich!” (S. 252, pg. 200)\n\n20. In the next chapter, Dr. Gerlinger is having an affair with Collin’s wife. While he’s interested in making love to her, she wants to find out more about her husband’s medical condition. When he starts to rhapsodize about her shoulders, her breasts, her thighs, skin, and lips, she interrupts to ask, “You are sure he won’t die?” Which leads to his annoyed reply:\n\na. “Why don’t you finally forget that,” he said.\n\nb. “Just forget about it, okay?” he said.\n\n“Vergiß das doch endlich”, sagte er. (S. 265, pg. 209)\n\n21. Peter calls Christine after his escape to West Berlin. Her stunned silence at the unexpected news prompts him to ask:\n\na. “Christine, are you hearing me?”\n\nb. “Christine, can you hear me?”\n\n“Christine, hörst du mich?” (S. 281, pg. 222)\n\n22. Then Peter explains the reason for his call.\n\na. “Christine, I only want that you know where I am…”\n\nb. “Christine, I only wanted you to know where I am…”\n\n“Christine, ich wollte nur, daß du weißt, wo ich bin…” (S. 281, pg. 222)\n\n23. Collin’s wife Nina spots an old friend at the clinic, spreads her arms and says…\n\na. “… don’t you remember, I am Nina – Nina Collin!”\n\nb. “… don’t you remember, it’s me, Nina – Nina Collin!”\n\n“… ich bin doch die Nina! – Nina Collin!” (S. 291, pg. 229)\n\n24. In his notes, Pollack summarizes the views of Urack, who said it was a mistake for the state to make concessions to the intellectuals, to the church, to the youth, and ….\n\na. … to the masses hungry for consumption…\n\nb. … to the masses hungry for consumer goods…\n\n… an die Konsumgier (S. 296, pg. 234)\n\n25. Wölfchen is upset that Peter, to whom he had grown close, has absconded. His mother asks him why he refuses to eat.\n\na. “I don’t like to.”\n\nb. “I don’t want to.”\n\nc. “I don’t feel like it.”\n\n“Ich mag aber nicht.” (S. 302, pg. 238)\n\n26. Havelka visits Christine to give her some advice after the departure of Peter. The worry is that the police will inquire whether she knew of his plans in advance. He tries to calm her fears, adding:\n\na. “Besides, it won’t even be certain that they’ll question you…”\n\nb. “Besides, it’s far from certain that they’ll question you…”\n\nc. “Besides, I’m not even sure that they’ll question you…”\n\n“Außerdem ist es ja gar nicht sicher, daß man Sie überhaupt befragen wird…” (S. 304, pg. 240)\n\n27. Later in the same chapter, Havelka tells her…\n\na. “… only after I became so ill that I felt as though all my blood had been drained from my veins things suddenly grew clear in my mind once more…”\n\nb. “… only after I became so ill that I felt as though all the blood had been drained from my veins did things suddenly become clear in my mind again…”\n\n“… erst als ich so krank war, daß ich mich fühlte, als hätte ich kein Blut mehr in den Adern, wurden die Dinge auf einmal wieder einfach…” (S. 306, pg. 242)\n\n28. Still later in this chapter, Christine tells her ex about a conversation she just had with their son on the topic of death.\n\na. “We’ve been talking of that a little while ago.”\n\nb. “We were talking about that a few minutes ago.”\n\n“Wir haben vorhin davon gesprochen.” (S. 320, pg. 253)\n\n29. On the final page of the chapter, as her ex is thinking of asserting his spousal rights, he says:\n\na. “We are all making our mistakes, but that’s no reason to…”\n\nb. “We all make mistakes, but that’s no reason to…”\n\n“Wir machen jeder unsre Fehler, aber das ist kein Grund…” (S. 321, pg. 254)\n\n30. In the next chapter, Collin talks with his wife about leaving the clinic. When she says she’ll drive, he responds:\n\na. “I might want to be doing the driving,” he said tiredly.\n\nb. “I might want to do the driving myself,” he said in a tired voice.\n\n“Ich könnte ja auch selber fahren wollen”, sagte er müde. (S. 324, pg. 256)\n\n31. A few lines later, he thinks to himself about Christine and his uncertainty about her and his own health; in the midst of these reflections comes this further thought:\n\na. … he had been having his quasi infarct despite the most beautiful organic findings…\n\nb. … he had had his quasi infarct in spite of very positive lab test results…\n\n… er hatte seinen Quasi-Infarkt gehabt trotz schönstem organischem Befund… (S. 324, pg. 256)\n\n32. Urack, confined to the clinic, is complaining to his wife about how powerless he is.\n\na. “Can you realize how this feels: you talk and no one will listen, you give orders and no one will obey?”\n\nb. “Do you know what it’s like when you talk and no one listens, you give orders and no one obeys?”\n\n“Weißt du, wie das ist, wenn du redest und keiner hört, wenn du Orders gibst und keiner pariert?” (S. 336, pg. 265)\n\n33. Christine thinks to herself about Collin.\n\na. “Was she forever going to be tied to this man just because one night she gave him an injection against something…?”\n\nb. “Was she going to be tied to this man forever just because one night she gave him an injection for something…?”\n\n“War sie nun ewig an diesen Menschen gekettet, nur weil sie ihm eines Nachts eine Spritze gegen etwas gegeben hatte…?” (S. 357, pg. 282)\n\n34. Dr. Gerlinger attempts to calm Nina down by explaining that her husband’s euphoria is something which frequently occurs during a certain stage of recovery…\n\na. “… and which, as such, is nothing of which to be frightened.”\n\nb. “… and which, as such, is nothing to be afraid of.”\n\nc. “… and which, as such, is no cause for concern.”\n\n“… und die an sich noch nichts Beängstigendes ist.” (S. 364, pg. 288)\n\n35. Dr. Gerlinger tries to persuade Collin that he isn’t well enough to leave the clinic, saying: “Without your being ready and willing to cooperate, it would be much harder to reach our common goal….\n\na. But you’re still needing us.”\n\nb. But you still need us.”\n\nc. But you’re still in need of us.”\n\n“Aber noch brauchen Sie uns.” (S. 364, pg. 291)\n\n36. Collin eventually leaves the clinic, driving home with his wife. Traffic is bad, which makes him impatient.\n\na. He turned down the window and put his head out.\n\nb. He rolled down the window and stuck his head out.\n\nEr kurbelte das Fenster herunter und steckte den Kopf hinaus. (S. 385, pg. 303)\n\n37. While taking the dog for a walk, Collin and Pollock get into a fight, which Pollock later describes in his notes:\n\na. Collin pushes the dog aside and helps me to rise…\n\nb. Collin pushes the dog aside and helps me up…\n\nc. Collin pushes the dog away and helps me get to my feet…\n\nCollin schiebt ihn beiseite und hilft mir beim Aufstehen,.. (S. 394, pg. 310)\n\n38. When Collin has another infarct, Nina calls Pollock, who arrives quickly. As he follows her, he notices…\n\na. She was wearing her pantoufles…\n\nb. She was wearing her house slippers…\n\nSie trug Pantoffeln an den Füßen… (S. 397, pg. 312)\n\n39. Pollack also notices something else:\n\na. The lights were on everywhere in the still house.\n\nb. All the lights were on, but the house was quiet.\n\nEs war still im Haus, überall brannte Licht. (S. 397, pg. 313)\n\n40. On the final page of the novel, Pollock decides he should take Collin’s manuscript for safekeeping, to prevent its confiscation by the Stasi. While doing so, he thinks to himself: Who had a better right to these papers than he …\n\na. … the inventor and originator of Collin’s memoirs…\n\nb. … who had inspired Collin to write his memoirs…\n\nWer, wenn nicht der eigentliche Initiator der Memoiren, hatte ein Recht auf das Manuskript… (S. 400, pg. 315)\n\nAs you have probably guessed by now, in every instance, Heym’s version is “a.” The versions to be found under “b” (and occasionally “c”) are my suggestions. Before I offer any commentary, consider the following:\n\n41. Would a native speaker really say “I shall” in the following circumstances? I suggest that in each case the answer is: Of course it’s possible, but unlikely.\n\na. Wölfchen is telling his mother a dream he had: “You called to me: Come, come. But then you weren’t there anymore, only that big wave, and I thought I must drown. I shall paint that later.” (pg. 28, S. 33)\n\nb. His mother decides she needs to talk to a doctor: “I shall have a talk with Gerlinger.” (pg. 64, S. 79)\n\nc. Urack’s grandson Peter is visiting him in the clinic, when the old man takes a turn for the worse. Alarmed, Peter looks for and then finds the button that will summon the nurse. He asks: “Here! Shall I ring?” (pg. 103, S. 128)\n\nd. Peter explains to Christine that he has to leave her because otherwise she would be dragged into his affairs. Her response: “I shall bear it.” (pg. 164, S. 206)\n\n42. The same question can be asked about characters using the word “whom” in everyday conversation.\n\na. Urack’s wife is visiting him in the clinic. “I’ve brought Peter along […] first because he’s a great help to a blind woman and, secondly, I felt whom else do you have on this earth, Wilhelm.” (pg. 97, S. 120)\n\nb. When Christine comes to Collin in the clinic, he asks whether her interests pertain to Collin as a writer, as a clinical case, or Collin as a man, a human being: “Which, or whom, are you really interested in?” (pg. 120, S. 150)\n\nc. Collin’s wife is talking with her father, affectionately called Papsch, about her visit to the hospital, remarking: “I will see him then, by the way.” – “Whom?” asked Papsch. – “The professor.” (pg. 202, S. 255)\n\nd. A few pages later she is in conversation with Prof. Gerlinger, who tells her the story of how the King of Prussia sold dragoons to the King of Saxony in exchange for Chinese vases. After expounding on this, he pulls himself up and asks, “But whom am I telling this.” (pg. 206, S. 260)\n\nI would like to meet the person who would use “whom” in these situations (actually, I wouldn’t). My point is that in normal conversation, which all of these are examples of, most native speakers would not bother to use “shall” or “whom,” since it would sound like they were being overly formal, pompous, or showing off.\n\nWhile none of the above instances are impossible, they are often unlikely. Read enough of them, and over time you tend to become somewhat impatient with the author, and eventually may just put the book aside. Most of the examples are admittedly little things, but when infelicities accumulate, the reader is bound to become annoyed. Strictly speaking, Heym’s versions may be more accurate in a literal sense – the dictionary says “mag” means “like” and not “want” – but in context, when a child is explaining why he refuses to eat, he would say “I don’t want to” and not “I don’t like to.” In normal conversation, how many native speakers would say, “You should know more about this than I!”\n\nWhat about vocabulary? “Pantoffeln” is the usual word for “slippers” in German, whereas “pantoufles” sounds foreign in English. And are you familiar with the word “sphygmomanometer”? Collins, lying in his hospital bed, thinks to himself that this device and a stethoscope are “familiar items” (pg. 281). In German, it’s called a “Blutdruckgerät” or “blood-pressure monitor” (S. 355). I can see no good reason to use a specialized term most readers will not be familiar with (or even able to pronounce) in favor of an everyday term, like the one used in German. It would be like saying, “Pass the sodium chloride.”\n\nEarlier in his career, Heym wrote his works in English and translated them into German. When it came to 5 Days in June, Heym still spoke English at a near-native level, and still benefitted from the editorial assistance of his wife, Gertrude Gelbin. By the time of Collin, however, she had died and Heym was not doing himself any favors by taking on this task himself. His English version comes out sounding very much like a translation. The tone is uneven, the language stilted, awkward, and unidiomatic – in other words, it sounds like a version in which the translator has stuck too closely to the original. Heym uses passive where a native speaker would use active. Characters like Christine sound philosophical when they are not supposed to, and other characters who are, like Pollock, end up sounding even more professorial in English than in the original. While some parts sound idiomatic, others sound like they have been rendered into English by someone who once knew the language but hasn’t spoken it in quite some time. Which of course was pretty much the case with Stefan Heym by this point in his life. I imagine he insisted on a contract which gave him final say over the English translation, and that his publishers were none too happy with the result. As far as I can determine, this is the last work of his that he translated.\n\nThe German Wikipedia article on Heym, which includes his translations, makes no mention of this one; the English article did likewise, until I added a reference in December 2018.\n\nRelated reviews at this site: Stefan Heym: Five Days in June; Robert Darnton: Censors at Work; Timothy Garton Ash: The File; for the case of Noel Field in Hungary, who is briefly mentioned in Collin, see the review of Tony Sharp, Stalin’s American Spy.\n\nIf you refer to this blog in a publication, please let me know – my school likes to keep track.\n\n(c) Hamilton Beck"
