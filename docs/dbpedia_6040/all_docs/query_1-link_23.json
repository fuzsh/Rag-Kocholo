        "text": "Stefan Heym, who has died aged 88 of heart failure, had little confidence in obituaries. In an indignant riposte to one held on file by the New York Times from interview material, East Germany's best-known dissident author produced his own 850-page autobiography entitled Nachruf (Obituary, 1988). With the satisfaction of a lifelong battler against authority in all its guises, he noted that he had already substantially outlived his would-be obituarist.\n\nBorn Helmut Flieg, of Jewish parents, in the industrial town of Chemnitz in Saxony, he first experienced political persecution in 1931, while still at school, as the author of a satirical poem which incurred the wrath of local Nazis. After escaping to the anonymity of Berlin, where he studied at the university, he barely had time to hone his journalistic skills before becoming one of the youngest of the thousands of Germany's intellectual exiles from the Third Reich. His businessman father committed suicide in 1935, and most of his family perished in the Auschwitz death camp.\n\nWith his newly chosen nom de plume, Stefan Heym, he made his way, via Prague, to life as a student at the Univeristy of Chicago, and, from 1937, as a journalist, before enlisting in the US army in 1943. The next year he returned to Europe after D-Day as a psychological warfare expert. He later made this experience the basis of his novel Crusaders (1948), which was ranked in its day alongside Mailer's The Naked and the Dead as an authentic account of the war.\n\nBy exposing the dangerously authoritarian attitudes held by a minority of the American troops, Heym was, however, storing up trouble for himself. In 1952, mounting McCarthyite pressures impelled him to embark on his second fresh start as an independently minded socialist, now in the newly established German Democratic Republic.\n\nHeym's robust involvement in US public life taught him lessons which helped him to survive almost four decades of in-fighting with the GDR's communist hierarchy. Between 1953 and 1957, the Soviet-run paper, Tagliche Rundschau, gave him a column in which he was able to debate the political issues of the day in a way which no GDR-controlled newspaper would have tolerated. When that outlet was blocked, he channelled his energies into the production of politically challenging literature, rather than allowing his frustrations to be stifled in discussions held behind closed doors, as they inevitably would have been if he had become a party member.\n\nThe weakness of Heym's position - evident in the account of his GDR years in his self-styled \"obituary\" - was the extent to which he exaggerated his independent successes, portraying himself as virtually the only effective advocate there of \"socialism with a human face\".\n\nFor Heym, the two crucial missed opportunities to progress towards socialist democracy in eastern Europe came in 1953 and 1956, with the crushing of popular revolt, first in the GDR, then in Hungary, and he was determined to overturn the official interpretation of both uprisings as the result of external subversion. The two novels which ensued, Five Days in June and Collin, were banned, however, making a mockery of the Honecker regime's claim to have ended censorship. The West German editions (published in 1974 and 1979 respectively) and Heym's English-language originals (1977 and 1980) were, in contrast, well received as portrayals of the impact of these crises on a representative spectrum of fictional characters.\n\nAs a creative writer, Heym was, however, at his sharpest when he adopted more distanced perspectives on the failure of political systems to live up to their ideological promise, in works such as The Queen Against Defoe (1980), The King David Report (1972) and The Wandering Jew (1981).\n\nThe third phase in Heym's long public career began in 1989, when the disintegration of state socialism throughout eastern Europe appeared to offer him and his fellow reformist intellectuals the opportunity to transform the GDR into a socialist democracy. When these hopes were swept aside by the force of the popular demand for rapid German unification, Heym's self-image as a tribune of the people suffered a severe blow. He nevertheless survived, and his apotheosis was still to come.\n\nIn 1994, through a fascinating combination of historical ironies, Heym was elected to the Bundestag as an independent MP, although sponsored by the PDS, the heirs of the GDR's communist party, with whom Heym had battled for so long. He thus gained the right, at the age of 81, as the oldest member, to give the inaugural speech of the new parliament.\n\nHis restrained plea for tolerance and solidarity, delivered in the modernised Reichstag by a man who had witnessed its burning by the Nazis in 1933, was, however, received in stony silence by Chancellor Kohl and his conservative colleagues, unable to accept that a communist sympathiser should be granted this degree of legitimacy. Having made his point, Heym was content by the following year to resign his seat and return to writing.\n\nOnly recently did his broad physical frame show signs of frailty, but his energy and sense of humour were reignited by the prospect of sharing his experiences with an appreciative student audience. Amidst the uncertainties of German unification, he decided to entrust his extensive archives to Cambridge University, a gesture acknowledged by the honorary doctorate which Cambridge awarded him in 1991.\n\nIn October, he took part in a demonstration against the conflict in Afghanistan. At the time of his death, he was in Israel, having just attended a conference on the 19th-century poet Heinrich Heine, subject of his thesis at Chicago.\n\nHe was twice married: firstly, to Gertrude who died in 1969, and then, in 1971, to Inge."
