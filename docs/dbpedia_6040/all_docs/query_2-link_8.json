        "text": "Heym: What does the surname Heym mean?\n\nThe surname \"Heym\" is derived from the German word \"Heim\", meaning \"home\". In the Middle Ages, many people would take on a surname derived from their profession or place of residence. Therefore, the \"Heym\" surname is thought to have been attributed to people who originally came from a location with this name, such as a town, village, or a hamlet in Germany, Austria, or Switzerland.\n\nThe \"Heym\" surname can also refer to someone with a high social or economic status, as it is derived from the Middle High German word \"heimzcheit\", meaning \"place of comfort, security, and pride\". This suggests that these individuals could have been influential members of society. This is further supported by old documents which mention people by the name of \"Heym\" as being citizens of cities.\n\nToday, the surname \"Heym\" is found predominantly in countries in central and northern Europe. It is most commonly seen in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and the Low Countries. The name is still carried around by approximately 3,500 people, and is known for its distinctive sound and distinct phonetic spelling.\n\nThe surname has undoubtedly changed throughout the centuries, and some may even perceive it to be a family name of some historical importance.\n\nOrder DNA origin analysis\n\nHeym: Where does the name Heym come from?\n\nThe surname Heym is most commonly found today in Europe, particularly in Germany. Heym is a traditional German surname that dates back to the Middle Ages. It originates from the Middle High German and Old High German words \"heim\" or \"haim\", referring to a home or family estate.\n\nThe earliest known record of the Heym surname is from the 14th century when it appears in the Evangelical Church records of the Landshut area of Bavaria, Germany. Since then, the surname has spread throughout Germany and other parts of Europe.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Heym surname began to spread to the United States and Canada as well, largely due to the many German immigrants who arrived in North America during this time. Today, the surname can be found all across the United States, Canada, and much of Europe, particularly in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.\n\nThe Heym surname can be found in records from the 17th to the 20th centuries. It is most commonly associated with the villages of Greinbach, Niedersöhren, and Kirtorf in Germany, where the surname originated. It is also common in other parts of Germany and in areas where the surname has spread, such as in the US, Canada, Switzerland, and Austria.\n\nVariations of the surname Heym\n\nThe surname Heym is a variant of the German surname Heyman. There are other alternate spellings, such as Heymann, Heimann, Heyerman, and Heyer. These surnames likely originated from the Middle High German term \"heyme,\" which refers to a high-ranking individual such as a king or a lord.\n\nThe surname Heym is most commonly found in Germany and other parts of Central Europe, although it did spread to other countries, such as the United States. In the United States, the surname Heym may have been Americanized to Hyman or Heyman.\n\nThe surname Heym can also be found in a few other variations, such as Heims, Heim, and Heymers. Additionally, the spelling of the surname can vary depending on the language and region: English and American variants often use the single letter “y” whereas Germanic languages use “ey.”\n\nOverall, the surname Heym has many variants, spellings, and surnames of the same origin. Although the name may have been Americanized to Hyman or Heyman in the United States, Heym is still a common surname in Germany and other parts of Central Europe, with numerous variations in spelling and pronunciation.\n\nFamous people with the name Heym\n\nFranz Heym, German architect and urban planner\n\nTracy Heym, American singer and songwriter\n\nGary Heym, American painter and sculptor\n\nStefan Heym, German-American writer\n\nMax Heym, German architect\n\nLorenz Heym, Swiss painter\n\nChristian Heym, German painter\n\nMarianne Heym, Swiss sculptor\n\nJan Heym, Czech poet\n\nFranciszek Heym, Polish novelist\n\nMartin Heym, German entomologist\n\nLeonard Heym, German jurist\n\nJohann Peter Heym, German naturalist\n\nEdgar Heym, German art historian\n\nLudwig Heym, German sculptor\n\nWilhelm Heym, German landscape painter\n\nOlivier Heym, Belgian composer\n\nMervyn Heym, Czech-American author\n\nYakov Heym, Soviet poet\n\nLuis Heym, Argentine race car driver\n\nOther surnames"
