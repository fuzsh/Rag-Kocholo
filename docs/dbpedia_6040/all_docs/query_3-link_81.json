        "text": "The article interests itself with the journey of Carla Maliandi's unknown female protagonist from Argentina to Germany to find her roots and eventually her home. Relying on close reading and place-attachment theory, the research negotiates the multifarious dimensions of the concept of home and addresses its meaning in relation with the notions of solidarity and community. In addition, it sheds light on Heidelberg as a geographical domain that enforces group solidarity and a sense of attachment among immigrants. The research gathers perspectives from social and immigration studies to provide an understanding of the complexities of bridging the gap between two cultures and the ensuing struggles to integrate and belong. The findings of this research demonstrate the power of literature to address the multiple effects of mobility and exile and how authors navigate themes of alienation and belonging as consequential outcomes of displacement."
