However, it is pointed out that the user experience of our Service can be limited if cookies are limited or completely blocked.\n\n7.

This establishes a direct connection between the Apps and the selected social media system (according to Art. 6 (1) S.1 f EU-GDPR). Our Service has no influence whatsoever on the nature and extent of the data transmitted by these connections.

Additionally, some third parties also enable users to revoke permissions and account access directly within the third party service, e.g. you can revoke access by the app to your data on YouTube via the Google security settings page at https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions.\n\n8. Camera, microphone, location\n\nWhen you start using our Service or want to create and share a video, we ask you for consent to use your camera, microphone, and location in a pop-up. If you do not give permission, we will not use that capability. You may not be able to use all features of our Service in this case. You can later give or revoke your consent in the settings.\n\nIf you allow access to these capabilities, the mobile app will only access your data and transfer it to our server as necessary to provide the functionality (according to Art. 6 (1) S.1 f EU-GDPR). Your data will be treated confidentially and deleted if you revoke the rights to use or are no longer required to provide the services and there are no legal retention requirements. Please note that your User Generated Content, username and profile image will be retained as per the Terms and Conditions.\n\nOur Service includes so-called Location Based Services, with which we offer special offers that are tailored to your particular location.

You can allow or revoke the GPS function in the settings of the app at any time by going to your system “Settings”.\n\n9. Newsletter\n\nProvided you consent, you can subscribe to our newsletter, which informs you about our Services and current offers of interest. If you want to receive the newsletter, we require a valid e-mail address and information that allow us to verify that you are the owner of the e-mail address or that its owner agrees to receive the newsletter (according to Art. 6 (1) S.1 a EU-GDPR). Further data is not collected. This data is used only to send the newsletter and will not be disclosed to third parties. By registering for the newsletter, we save your IP address and date of registration. This data is used alone for evidence in the case that a third party abused an e-mail address and logs in without the knowledge of the person entitled to receive the newsletter.\n\nYour consent to the storage of the data, the email address and its use for sending the newsletter can be revoked at any time. The revocation can be made via a link in the newsletters themselves or by notice via email to us.\n\n10.

In exceptional cases where personal information is transferred to the United States or other third countries, Mixpanel, Appsflyer and Intercom have represented that they have (or will have) submitted to the applicable data transfer laws. To these tracking services, we send the following data: User-Id assigned from our backend, email, first name, last name (if exists), username (user unique Id), birthday, gender. We have activated IP anonymization, so that the IP address of the users is shortened before it is stored by these tracking and analytical tools.

Transfer to other countries\n\nOur Service transfers, processes, and stores information about our users on servers located in a number of countries. Your personal information may therefore be subject to privacy laws that are different from those in your country of residence. Information collected within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland may, for example, be transferred to and processed by third parties identified above, located in a country outside of the EEA and Switzerland, where you may have fewer legal rights in relation to your information. We will process your information as described in this Privacy Policy.\n\n12. Minors\n\nOur Service is a general audience App, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 13 or under the applicable age limit (in some jurisdictions, this age limit may be lower).
