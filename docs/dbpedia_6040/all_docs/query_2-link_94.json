        "text": "usually , he would be tearing around the living room , playing with his toys .\n\nbut just one look at a minion sent him practically catatonic .\n\nthat had been megan 's plan when she got him dressed earlier .\n\nhe 'd seen the movie almost by mistake , considering he was a little young for the pg cartoon , but with older cousins , along with her brothers , mason was often exposed to things that were older .\n\nshe liked to think being surrounded by adults and older kids was one reason why he was a such a good talker for his age .\n\n`` are n't you being a good boy ? ''\n\nshe said .\n\nmason barely acknowledged her .\n\ninstead , his baby blues remained focused on the television .\n\nsince the movie was almost over , megan knew she better slip into the bedroom and finish getting ready .\n\neach time she looked into mason 's face , she was grateful that he looked nothing like his father .\n\nhis platinum blond hair and blue eyes were completely hers .\n\nit was only his build that he was taking after his father .\n\nwhere megan was a diminutive 5'3 '' , davis was 6'1 '' and two hundred pounds .\n\nmason was already registering off the charts in height and weight according to his pediatrician .\n\ndavis had seen mason only twice in his lifetime-the day he had been born and the day he came home from the hospital .\n\nafter that , he had n't been interested in any of the pictures and emails megan sent .\n\nwith his professional football career on the rise , davis had n't wanted to be shackled with the responsibilities of a baby .\n\ninstead , he wanted to spend his time off the field partying until all hours of the night .\n\nhe only paid child support when megan threatened to have his wages garnished .\n\nshe dreaded the day when mason was old enough to ask about his father .\n\nshe never wanted anything in the world to hurt him , and she knew that being rejected by his father would .\n\nwith a sigh , she stepped into the dress and slid it over her hips .\n\nwrestling around to get the zipper all the way up caused her to huff and puff .\n\nstanding back from the mirror , she turned to and fro to take in her appearance .\n\nshe 'd always loved how the dress made her feel sexy , but at the same time was very respectable .\n\nwhile it boasted a sweetheart neckline , the hemline fell just below her knees .\n\nshe put on her pearls-a high school graduation gift from her uncle aidan , or `` ankle '' , as she often called him .\n\naidan was her mother 's baby brother and only son of the family .\n\nwhen she was born , he was only eight and a half .\n\nas the first grandchild , megan spent a lot of time with her grandparents , and that in turn , meant she spent a lot of time with aidan .\n\nhe had devoted hours to holding her and spoiling her rotten .\n\nwhen it came time for her to talk , she just could n't seem to get `` uncle aidan '' out .\n\ninstead , she called him `` ankle . ''\n\nit was a nickname that had stuck with him even now that he was thirty-four and married .\n\nwhile it had been no question that she wanted him as godfather for mason , she had been extremely honored when he and his wife , emma , had asked her to be their son , noah 's , godmother .\n\nshe loved her newest cousin very much and planned to be the best godmother she could for him .\n\nas she stepped out of the bedroom , she found that mason had yet to move .\n\n`` okay buddy , time to go . ''\n\nwhen he started to whine , she shook her head .\n\n`` we have such a fun day ahead of us .\n\nit 's noah 's baptism , and then there 's a party at uncle aidan and aunt emma 's house . ''\n\n`` beau ? ''\n\nhe asked .\n\nshe laughed .\n\n`` yes , you 'll get to see and play with beau , too . ''\n\nas she went to the couch and picked him up , she could n't help finding it amusing that out of everyone he was going to see today , he was most excited about being with aidan and emma 's black lab , beau .\n\none day when they had their own place again , she would get him a dog .\n\nhe loved them too much to be denied .\n\n`` oomph , '' she muttered , as they started up the basement stairs .\n\n`` heawy ? ''\n\nhe asked .\n\n`` yes , you 're getting to be such a big , heavy boy . ''\n\nwhen they made it to the kitchen , megan paused to catch her breath .\n\nshe only had a second before her mother breezed in with sean , and her youngest brother , gavin .\n\n`` ready ? ''\n\nshe asked .\n\nmegan nodded .\n\nfeeling like she was once again a teenager , she filed behind her parents as they headed into the garage .\n\n`` i want to drive , '' gavin said .\n\nwith a smirk , sean replied , `` like i 'm gon na let you drive my car . ''\n\nhe then slid into the driver 's seat as gavin reluctantly walked around to the passenger 's side .\n\n`` we 'll see you there in just a few , '' her mother called .\n\nsean acknowledged her with a two finger salute before cranking up and pulling down the driveway .\n\nmegan worked to get mason into the car seat in her parents ' land rover .\n\nonce he was safely strapped and buckled in , she hopped in beside him .\n\nher parents rattled along to each other as they made their way through the tree-lined suburbs where megan had grown up .\n\nwhile some might look on her as having a mark against her character being an unwed mother , she had lived a relatively non-rebellious life .\n\neven though she 'd been a cheerleader and ran with the popular crowd in school , she rarely partied to excess .\n\ninstead , she had focused on getting good grades .\n\nat that time , she had her heart set on going to medical school and becoming a doctor .\n\nfrom the time she was a little girl , she had wanted nothing more than to help people .\n\nshe was always mending birds with broken wings or trying to resuscitate squirrels who had been hit by cars .\n\nshe ditched playing princess for playing `` hospital . ''\n\nher desire to become a doctor was why she needed the best scores and best activities and why she generally shunned any temptations to lead her off the right path .\n\nshe had even managed to bypass the usual freshman craziness when she went off to the university of georgia .\n\nit was n't until she fell in love for the first time in her life that she threw everything away .\n\nsadly , she could n't say that her first love was davis , mason 's father .\n\ninstead , it was another football player , this time a running back at uga , who captured and later broke her heart a year later .\n\ncarsyn ran with the fast crowd , and when she was with him , she partied and drank too much .\n\nby the time she got back on track with her grades , she had abandoned any hope of medical school .\n\ninstead , she decided that she would become a nurse , which would fulfill her need to care for sick people .\n\nof course , her relationship with davis ended up derailing shortly before graduation when she got pregnant unexpectedly .\n\nshe had to take several semesters off after mason was born .\n\nshe was a few years off from when she had originally planned on graduating , but she was excited after everything had that had happened , she was finally finishing .\n\nher mother 's voice brought megan out of her thoughts .\n\n`` here we are , '' she said pleasantly .\n\nleaning forward in her seat , megan eyed the clock on the dashboard .\n\nshe was n't surprised to see they had arrived half an hour before the baptism started .\n\none thing her mother prided herself on was being on time and lending a hand .\n\nas they started into the church , her mother reached for mason .\n\n`` we 'll take him so you can go see if emma needs any help . ''\n\nmegan bent over to kiss mason 's cheek .\n\n`` see you in a little while , sweetie . ''\n\nhe grinned and then happily dodged her mother 's arms for her father 's instead , which made megan smile ."
