        "text": "Essay (back to top)\n\nThe 1953 Uprising in East Germany:\n\nExploring the True Significance of Five Days in June\n\nStefan Heyms Five Days in June is a wonderfully crafted, fictional yet historical account of the 1953 general labor strike in Soviet-occupied East Germany (specifically at the VEB Merkur industrial plant). Published in 1974, its hour-by-hour detailing of historic events resurrected some crucial questions that historians still disagree on today. Retrospectively, some historians have interpreted what transpired on June 17th, 1953 to have a larger, more political meaning: that East Germans were opposing not just norm raises, or calling for free elections, but resisting the socialist regime altogether. Others believe, and I would argue Heym included, that those who did strike were genuinely hoping to reform the workers party and state. As an Easterner himself, Stefan Heym brings a noteworthy perspective to the forefront, helping to answer simple questions like \"how did East Germans, as opposed to West Germans, interpret the uprising?\" In an attempt to rewrite the official Eastern version of what took place June 17th, Stefan Heym portrays the 1953 uprising as a crucially missed opportunity in the Easts progression as a socialist state. Instead of blaming anti-communist or Western infiltration, Heym seems to point a finger at the GDR leadership. This unconventional and even dangerous interpretation makes Five Days in June all the more fascinating.\n\nThe response to the publishing of Stefan Heyms Five Days in June is especially noteworthy. The book itself was banned in East Germany when it was published in 1974. It was arguably an attempt to reinterpret the official version of the events leading up to and including what took place on June 17th. Instead of blaming anti-communist infiltration or even the West, as many Eastern interpretations do, Heyms novel rather admits or pushes the East to admit to responsibility. Before the Prologue, Heym even quotes from the Constitution of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany as if to justify his purpose:\n\nIt is the duty of the member of the party . . . to develop self-criticism and criticism from the ranks, to uncover without fear or favor shortcomings in the activities of the party and to eliminate them . . . (p. 5).\n\nThe central character of the novel, Comrade Martin Witte, shares a remarkably similar positionas a trade unionist at VEB Merkur, Wittes anti-norm position puts him at odds with the SED party he professes allegiance to. By paralleling Witte with himself, and by portraying Witte as a renegade-to-hero type, Heym attempts to justify his eyebrow-raising interpretation of the 1953 general labor strike.\n\nHistorically speaking, Heyms novel seems to be fairly accurate. Heyms use of historical documentsradio reports and excerpts from speeches, newspaper editorials, military orders and official documentsgive his historical interpretation an aura of authenticity. The lack of available reviews, in English especially, has led me to wonder whether any of his characters are indeed based on historical figures. More important than hoping to stumble upon Heyms method of research or professed commitment to historical accuracy, however, are the questions that his novel attempts to answer.\n\nWas the 1953 uprising in East Germany much more than a general strike?\n\nWas it a symbolic yearning for freedom from an oppressive socialist regime, or an early premonition of what was to come in 1989?\n\nEvidence from Stefan Heyms novel seems to suggest that this ideological interpretation is without a doubt a Western creation or even an over-symbolization of the events. Rather than wanting to get rid of the system altogether, and in the case of Western interpretation replacing it with a capitalist democracy, East Germans merely wanted to reform the system. At one point, Kallmana disgruntled workertries to convince other workers from Hall Nine to join the strike, explaining, \"No one here is against the Government, Brother Teterow, or against the party. But the men simply cant understand why they should except this raw deal, this norm raise, and shouldnt be permitted to enquire why and wherefore . . .\" (p. 157). Dronke, another worker, expresses his thoughts: \"Im a member of the party, and I know why Im in the party, but I lost thirty-four pfennigs an hour, and thats money\" (p. 70); and yet another worker: \". . . we dont want to make trouble, we only want somebody to listen to us\" (p. 82). Workers merely wanted to have their voice heard, for after all, the GDR claimed it was a workers state, and the SED a workers party.\n\nThere is a possibility that one might think just the opposite, that the workers were not just resisting the socialist regime but calling for something completely newan extension of the Western zones capitalism perhaps. At one point in the novel, Heym includes part of an official statement made by the RIASRadio in the American Sector. Speaking of the work stoppages in East Berlin, it reads \"Yesterday it became no longer a mere question of norms. A protest against an arbitrary cut in wages turned into a protest against the entire regime, joined with the demand for free elections and the resignation of the Zones government\" (p. 265). One must realize however, that this particular interpretation of events comes from a Western radio station, broadcasting in the American zone. If anything this broadcast, and more importantly Heyms inclusion of it within his book, further proves that even at the time, the West tried to export their interpretation and symbolization of the 1953 strikes to the East. Without a doubt, many Westerners probably thought the uprisings signified a great opposition to socialism. Even so, there is no mention among Heyms characters of wanting anything but socialism, thus suggesting that the Western and Eastern interpretations of the labor uprising were indeed quite different.\n\nStefan Heym makes a clear initiative to include several workers who, in contrast to the majority of workers, believe in the norms and the message behind them. Responding to Kallmans persistence, Teterow takes a stand: \"The new norms can be met . . . do I have a better machine than you? Better material? I simply put my heart into it . . . the norm raisethat was no mistake\" (p. 155). Teterow is verbally attacked for his response, and no one comes to his rescue. Heym ends the chapter with a brief yet effective mention of another worker. In an attempt to explain to Dronke who exactly profits from the plants production, Teterow questions a quiet worker, apparently pushing him too far: \"The worker picked up a huge wrench and raised it threateningly. Scram will you! Ive got a sick wife at home and three kids, and Ive got to meet that new norm, is that clear?\" (p. 159). Even here, Teterows allegiance to the state is contrasted sharply to simple self-preservation. Thus, whether they agreed, felt they had to agree, or disagreed with the norm raises, every worker in Heyms novel believes in socialism; no worker badmouths the socialist system or voices interest in leaving for the West.\n\nHow did the East Germans see the uprisings?\n\nAs an East German himself, author Stefan Heym brings an interesting perspective to the forefront. Heym several times refers to the GDRs acknowledgement of previously making mistakes, as if to infer that the norm raises are another one of these errors. He includes an article from Tagliche Rundschau, a daily newspaper published by the Soviet Army for the German population:\n\nThe Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party openly and sincerely admit to the entire population of the German Democratic Republic that in the past they have committed mistakes . . . (p. 93)\n\nAnd later from the Address of the Chairman of the Central Committee of the SED, Otto Grotewohl, on June 16th, 1953:\n\nOur mistakes which we openly acknowledge are in no way the result of lack of understanding . . . these mistakes arose from our honest intention to speed up the development towards a quicker rise in the standard of living of the entire population. At this point the basic mistake occurred . . . (p. 232)\n\nBoth of these excerpts are from historical documents, and by including them in his novel, Heym surrounds his plot and supposed fictional characters with authenticity and legitimacy. Even Comrade Witte, at the conclusion of the novel, seems to call for Eastern acknowledgment of responsibility. Speaking to his secretary, he predicts,\n\nThere will be lots of talk in the near future about whose fault it was, and quite a few will yield to the temptation of seeking the fault outside themselves. I just wonder how many will have the guts to step up and say: I too, am to blame, Comrades . . . (p. 347).\n\nThus, not only through his inclusion of historical documents, but also through the characters discourse, Heym has done what few, if any, Eastern historians have doneattempted to solely blame the GDR leadership for the 1953 uprising.\n\nIn my opinion, the following conversation between two workers, Panowsky and Dronke, sums up the two different opinions Germans had after their government admitted to past and present mistakes. Panowsky shares, \"I think its a great party that has the courage to admit its mistakes to the world. I think it was a most impressive act.\" Placing a hand on his comrades shoulder, Dronke replies \"Me, my boy, I would be more impressed if not so many mistakes had been made\" (p. 237). Because Heym wrote specifically from a labor leaders perspective, Five Days in June mostly encompasses the workmans view of the 1953 uprising. Thus, as readers, we see that many East Germans regard the uprisings not merely as a result of built up economic tension, but also as a long-overdue outcry to show just how far the workers party and government had diverged from the workers interests.\n\nWas the East German uprising the deciding factor that ended any and all possibility of German unification?\n\nHeyms novel touches little on post-June 17th material. He does, however, include characters whose Western connections make them suspicious. As readers, we never really come to know the truth behind Annas husbands sudden return to the East. Nevertheless, his repulsive demeanor contrasts sharply with Wittes charming and heroic disposition. Heym also includes a hostile woman who challenges Anna at the Food Store, demanding five pounds of butter. Witte intervenes, saying:\n\nNow let me tell you dear woman, what youre planning to do with these five pounds of butter. You plan to put them into that shopping bag of yours alongside all the other things youve bought this side of the border for money exchanged at the black rate of five marks East against one West mark, and then shuttle over there and peddle your goods, making a handsome profit even if you sell below West prices, while people here who earn their money honestly are having to face empty shelves (p. 88).\n\nThrough Witte, Stefan Heym is challenging the Westerners who exploit the Eastern market to better their own economic situation. Even before the Wall was built, there seems to be a desire for separation or at least for Western detachment so the socialist \"experiment\" could begin to take root. Those who shared such desire for and pride in a separate socialist state welcomed the building of the wall in 1961. Thus, while Heym does not suggest that the 1953 strikes killed any last hope at German unification, he certainly hints at two distinctly different systems developing.\n\nConclusion"
