Becher, who most passionately believed in the unity of German culture were gradually forced, not only by events but by the logic of their own beliefs, into the identification of German culture with the existence of the GDR itself and therefore into supporting steps initiated by the opposing faction which were to lead to division and Sovietization. He examines three 'case studies' in particular: the fate ofthe journal Sinn und Form under its editor Peter Huchel, the critical debate over Brecht's Das Verhordes Lukullus, and the orchestrated protests over Hanns Eisler's Faustus. In all three cases he shows how those who defended the objects of the attacks from the proponents of division were all the time playing into the hands ofthe latter. This he attributes to the Marxist mentality,whose dialectics was always willing to concede some sort of Socialist legitimacy to what was in fact a ruthless regime. There are parallels to be drawn here with the position of the intellectuals in the later years of the GDR. One point which emerges very clearly is the sheer psychological complexity ofthe individuals involved, who therefore cannot simply be 'condemned' for their actions or failure to act. Davies suggests that it was this readiness to make concessions, based partly on bad conscience, which allowed the division of Germany to go ahead. Becher, Brecht, and Eisler, not to mention others such as Arnold Zweig, would have had the authority and the influence to change the course of history had they been more determined to do so. The events of 17 June 1953 demonstrated the regime's fundamental weakness and the extent ofthe opportunity which was missed. For not only the term 'Stalinism' is questionable; the issue of 'Geist' vs. 'Macht' was never one of simple polarities. Davies has two major strengths: his familiarity with the post-Soviet debate in Russia and his ability to draw on the skills of the political scientist to illuminate aspects of Kulturpolitik as cultural historians are seldom able to do. It is unfortunate that in the process of turning the typescript into a book so many words have been run together, others redundantly hyphenated. University of Nottingham J.H. Reid Taking Sides: Stefan Heym's Historical Fiction. By Meg Tait. (British and Irish Studies in German Language and Literature, 22) Oxford, Bern, and Berlin: Lang. 2001. 208 pp. ?23; ?34.30. Stefan Heym's literaryoutput represents just one aspect ofa varied career that has also included journalism, broadcasting, and latterlypolitics. As befitsa writerwho has been active in so many spheres, Meg Tait's study of Heym's historical fiction is primarily an 'exercise in contextualisation', which examines the 'relationships between author, text, environment and readers (implied and, in some cases, actual)' (p. 10). In her introductory chapter Tait briefly sketches some aspects of the MarxistLeninist orthodoxy that dominated ofBcial GDR historiography, and discusses its impact on historical fiction in the early decades of the GDR. She goes on to examine Heym's relationship to Stalinism, with particular reference to the question how much Heym could have known about the nature of Stalin's regime. These contextual considerations feed in to the main part of the study, which consists of lengthy readings of three of Heym's historical novels: Lenz, Ahasver, and Schwarzenberg. Although these three form the main focus of the book, several of Heym's other novels (notably The King David Report and The Architects also receive more or less detailed atten? tion, so that a comprehensive overview of Heym's historical fiction emerges in the course of the study. The trajectory of Heym's writing is plotted as a movement away from the norms of Lukacsian realism towards a more questioning mode of narrative that eschews representation of social reality in favour of an exploration of ethical and 1040 Reviews political ideas. Lenz occupies the former position, while Ahasver and The King David Report fall into the latter category. Schwarzenberg, on the other hand, falls awkwardly between two stools in Tait'sestimation, the 'abstractionof ideas' having a detrimental effecton the narrative proper (p. 175).
