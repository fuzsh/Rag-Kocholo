Krenz will only spend a few weeks in power. Honecker flees to Moscow in 1991. The following year he is charged with manslaughter in Berlin in connection with the deaths of those who were shot and killed at the Wall. The case is dropped after Honecker’s lawyers complain to the Berlin Constitutional Court. In 1993 Honecker emigrates to Chile, where he dies a year later at the age of 81.\n\nPolitics, East\n\n00:33\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nOctober 07, 1989\n\nGorbachev at GDR's 40th anniversary\n\nThe SED leadership is holding celebrations to mark the 40th anniversary of the GDR, but the people are far from happy. They want political reform, the kind of restructuring that they know is happening further East. Mikhail Gorbachev, leader of the Soviet Union and the SED’s guest of honour, uses the opportunity to issue a warning to East Germany’s leaders. Those who oppose the GDR regime hope for a sign that reforms are on the way. Speaking in an interview, Gorbachev says: \"I believe danger awaits those who do not react to the real world. If you pick up on the currents moving the real world, moving society, if you use them to shape your policies, then you have no reason to fear difficulties. There is nothing unusual in that.”\n\nPolitics, Opposition, East\n\n00:57\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nSeptember 1989\n\nExit through Hungary\n\nWith Hungary’s borders now open, more and more people are using them to flee the GDR. The refugees all arrive at Tegel airport. For the first time since 1961, the refugee centre in Marienfelde is full to overflowing. New arrivals are housed in a disused furniture warehouse in the district of Wedding. From their windows they can see the TV tower in East Berlin.\n\nEscaping, Opposition, West, East\n\n00:38\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nMay 1989\n\nLocal elections in the GDR\n\nThe GDR holds local elections in May 1989.

Even in January 1989, Honecker still believes in the border: “The Wall will still be here in 50 years, and in 100, if the reasons for its presence still persist.”\n\nEveryday Life, Politics, West, East\n\n01:02\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nNovember 04, 1989\n\nRally at Alexanderplatz\n\nOn 4 November, 500,000 people gather for a rally on Alexanderplatz in East Berlin.

An Italian journalist asks about changes to the laws governing the right to travel. Schabowski answers: \"We have therefore decided today to put in place a regulation that allows every citizen of the German Democratic Republic to leave through any of its border crossings.\" Journalist: \"When does it come into effect?\" Schabowski: \"That comes into effect, according to my information… immediately, without delay.\" Schabowski continues: \"Permanent exit can take place via all border crossing points between the GDR and FRG or West Berlin.\" A few hours later, the Wall falls.\n\nBorder, Politics, West, East\n\n02:03\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nJune 01, 1968\n\nPrague Spring\n\nEast Berlin in the early summer of nineteen sixty-eight. Alexanderplatz is a huge building site: socialism is getting a makeover and the GDR capital is set to become a modern showcase of the Republic. In June 1968 18-year-old Toni Krahl, who will later front the rock band City, travels to Prague and is impressed by what he finds there: \"socialism with a human face\". However, on 21 August 1968 half a million soldiers from the Warsaw Pact countries invade the CSSR, crushing the Prague Spring. The authorities in East Berlin welcome the intervention and convict 1,200 people who take to the streets in protest, including Toni Krahl.\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Politics, Opposition, East\n\n04:00\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\n1969\n\nGDR dissident Florian Havemann\n\nThe GDR is preparing for its 20th birthday. Alexanderplatz is being redeveloped and the new centre is gradually taking shape. Everything must be finished in time for grand celebrations in October. Not all young GDR citizens are in the mood for celebrating. Florian Havemann, the son of dissident Robert Havemann, has just been released from prison, where he was sent for his involvement in protests against the invasion in Prague. Florian Havemann is among a group of dissidents who are fighting for \"socialism with a human face\".\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Politics, Opposition, East\n\n01:53\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\n1985\n\nQueuing up for the West\n\nMany East Berliners have submitted applications to leave the GDR, but no one knows when or if they will be granted. Most people have to wait a long time before they find out. Author Bernd Wagner is among those who want to get out. When his application is finally approved, he leaves Prenzlauer Berg and settles in Kreuzberg in West Berlin.\n\nContemporary Witnesses, Politics, Opposition, East\n\n03:22\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nSeptember 01, 1986\n\nEnvironmental library in Zion Church\n\nGreenpeace activists stage a protest outside the GDR’s environment ministry. They are trying to raise awareness of how East Germany is damaging the environment. Christian Halbrock was part of the group. In this film he talks about how he and his friends also wanted to bring about political reforms. They have the idea to set up an environmental library, which opens in the parish hall of the Zion Church in East Berlin.

Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik is easing tensions. On 21 December, the Federal Republic of Germany and the GDR sign the Basic Treaty. It is part of a strategy adopted by the West German government under Chancellor Willy Brandt, aiming to normalise relations with the GDR. The FRG acknowledges Germany's partition, but also includes a clause stating the objective of reunification.\n\nPolitics, West, East\n\n00:28\n\nVideo versions:\n\nSD ,\n\nMD\n\nJuly 01, 1990\n\nMonetary union: Western marks for all\n\nThe economic, monetary and social union of West Germany and the GDR comes into force on 1 July 1990. The changes spell the end of the Eastern mark. GDR citizens finally have access to the Western mark, a long-time symbol of West German prosperity. Adults can change up to 4,000 Eastern marks at a rate of 1:1. For pensioners the maximum is 6,000. Savings in excess of those limits will be changed at a rate of 2:1. Wages and pensions are converted 1:1, and debts are halved.

Eight million people descend on the city, transforming Alexanderplatz into a huge festival arena. The GDR, with its new head of state and Party leader Erich Honecker, wants to present a cosmopolitan image. Free love, long hair: a colourful chaos. Suddenly almost anything seems to go in the GDR capital, turned upside down for nine days. West Berlin sports teacher Gunnar Rohn talks about his experiences at the festival. A different kind of provocation is coming from East Berlin's cinemas: the film The Legend of Paul and Paula escapes a ban by the skin of its teeth.
