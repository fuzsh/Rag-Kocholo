        "text": "Stefan Heym, the widely published author of more than a dozen historical and political novels, died yesterday while on a lecture tour in Israel. He was 88 and lived in Berlin.\n\nA Jew uprooted in Germany in 1933 by the Nazis, Mr. Heym became an intellectual nomad and a lifelong Marxist-Leninist: two years in Czechoslovakia, 15 years in the United States; settling finally in East Germany. In World War II he served in the United States Army in France and Germany.\n\nExtraordinarily prolific, Stefan Heym -- his pen name -- was more a highly gifted storyteller than a transcendent writer. With few exceptions his tales, drawn from history and contemporary political life, pitted a single man against a powerful and implacable authority.\n\nDescribing his literary aims in 1967 to an American visitor to East Germany, he said the country was ''a blank spot in literature for me to fill in.'' In fact East Germany produced a number of greatly talented homegrown novelists and poets whose works filled in virtually all of that blank spot.\n\nMr. Heym never became deeply rooted in the hybrid society of East Germany. ''I always say I'm not only a German writer but also an American,'' he said. ''Much of what I write, say and the way I act is American, although as a boy I wanted to be like Schiller.''\n\nKlaus Korn, a retired university professor in Berlin, said of Mr. Heym: ''We saw him as somebody from over there, from America. His novels were more in the American style, Sinclair Lewis or Norman Mailer, than German.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
