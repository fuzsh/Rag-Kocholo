        "text": "STEFAN HEYM, the German-Jewish writer, who has died aged 88, fled from the Nazis to Chicago and, later as an American soldier, helped to liberate Europe.\n\nIn 1953, fearing McCarthyite persecution, Heym sought asylum in East Germany, where he became a dissident and the country's \"best-known non-person\". Thirty-six years later, he supported protests against the Communist regime, but as an opponent of German reunification soon found himself rejoining his former foes among the Communists.\n\nAs father of the newly reunited parliament, he made the first speech in the Bundestag after the Berlin Wall fell.\n\nHeym was unique in the history of the European literature in making his name with a series of novels in English, then reverting to German after returning to his native land.\n\nAs a Jew, a Communist and the embodiment of the anti-Semitic stereotype of the rootless cosmopolitan, he saw himself in the role of Ahasver, The Wandering Jew - the title of his 1981 novel in which Lucifer and Ahasver contemplate German history.\n\nHis Hostages (1942) was among the first depictions of persecution and resistance in Europe, while The Crusaders (1948) was a critical account of the Allied invasion.\n\nHeym's attitude to Communist totalitarianism was more ambivalent. In his novel Five Days in June, he described the 1953 uprising in East Berlin as demonstrating the official claim that it was organised by Western agents, but the novel did not come out until it was published in the West in 1974.\n\nThough he suffered harassment at Communist hands, he continued to be regarded as a valuable trophy and a grand old man of East German letters. The plot of Heym's life, with its abrupt changes of allegiance, was more improbable than those of his novels.\n\nFor this reason, his third-person autobiography, Nachruf (1988), is perhaps his masterpiece though it, too, should be treated as a work of fiction.\n\nHe was born Helmut Flieg on April 10 1913 into an assimilated Jewish family at Chemnitz, Saxony. At 19, he published a pacifist poem lampooning the presence of German Army \"advisers\" in China: They lost us the war/But that's not enough for them...What are we doing wrong?/We're only representing German culture.\n\nThis provoked a rally by local Nazis, and he was expelled from school. His father refused to let him appear before his accusers, asking: \"Do you want to commit suicide, boy?\" Ironically, the father killed himself in 1935 and the rest of his family died in the death camps.\n\nAfter a year in Berlin, the young rebel emigrated to Czechoslovakia soon after Hitler came to power, adopting the name Stefan Heym to protect his family. Heym supported himself with his pen while studying, then took the opportunity to go to America in 1935.\n\nSettling in Chicago he worked his way through university, landed the post of editor of Deutsches Volksecho, and became a labour activist.\n\nAfter becoming an American citizen he enlisted in 1943 and was assigned as a sergeant to a US Army psychological warfare unit, making propaganda broadcasts. He landed at Omaha beach, and ended up in Munich, engaged in the denazification of his erstwhile countrymen.\n\nHeym helped to found the first post-Nazi newspaper in the US Zone, the Neue Zeitung, but soon clashed with colleagues over the emerging Cold War and resigned.\n\nBack in America, he experienced his first real conflict of loyalties. Many of his friends were under suspicion of Communist subversion, and the FBI already had a substantial file on Heym himself.\n\nHis novel In the Eyes of Reason, which depicted the 1948 Soviet-backed coup in Prague, was denounced for its pro-Communist sympathies; he later fictionalised his experience of McCarthyism in Goldsborough, being accused in the Catholic magazine America of \"treason\".\n\nWelcomed as a great catch by the Ulbricht regime, Heym was initially content to be a tool of Communist propaganda, writing a fulsome tribute Stalin on his death. Stalin, he wrote, was the most hated and most loved man of our time; loved by \"the little people . . . in every place where people fight for their rights and their liberation.\"\n\nThe East German uprising of 1953 and the Hungarian uprising of 1956 caused a new crisis of conscience and an abrupt withdrawal of official approval. Heym inherited from Brecht the role of East Germany's loyal opposition, preferring to criticise privately or indirectly - a dissident who knew just how far he dared go.\n\nWhen the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, Heym wondered what kind of socialism had to wall its people in. \"But,\" as he later wrote, \"he kept this thought to himself.\"\n\nWhen the \"turning point\" finally came in 1989, Heym was too old a dog to learn new tricks. His old fear of a Nazi revival re-emerged, he hated the new commercialism, and wrote a bitter attack on the reunited Germany, Built on Sand (1993).\n\nAt a reading, he was physically assaulted for defending the ideals of \"really existing socialism\". Elected as the oldest member of the new Bundestag in 1994, Heym gave the inaugural speech."
