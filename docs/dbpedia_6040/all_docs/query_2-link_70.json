        "text": "Index to Helpers\n\nThis page contains an index to all helpers of Allied airmen mentioned in (1) the AFEES newsletter, Communications, (2) other selected publications and videos, and (3) the 1993 list of AFEES helper members. Indexing of the newsletters was completed in the summer of 2022. To see the back issues of the Communications newsletter, click here. The notation (INDEXED) appears after the listing for each issue indexed. To view the other indexes, click on whichever of the following is of interest to you: evaders, place names, or other subjects.\n\nOccasionally we only have the first name of a helper and it will be listed alphabetically with all the other names.\n\nBe sure to visit the following page on this website: https://airforceescape.org/1993-list-of-helpers/. It contains a list of some 800 helpers whose names, addresses (for most of them), and phone numbers (for some of them) were listed in the Summer 1993 issue of Communications. The address and telephone information will appear in the jpeg images toward the bottom of the page. Although many of these evaders’ names will probably appear in the list below, their addresses will not. Both lists should be consulted.\n\nPlease bring to the attention of the webmaster any errors or omissions. Note that sometimes it is not entirely clear which country a particular helper is from and it may be necessary to make a best guess. Note also that diacritical (accent) marks used in many European names may not have been included to save time indexing or because they were not given in the original material. Sometimes in the same article a person’s name may be spelled differently, in which case both versions appear in the list, either on the same line or on separate lines. Please bring to the attention of the webmaster any errors or omissions.\n\nThe notation “(CC)” in a helper’s listing refers to a Christmas card or other reply that AFEES received from the helper in response to our Christmas mailing. The Spring (March) 2003 list of Christmas card responders includes, in many cases, the name of the evader helped. The country under which a helper is listed is based upon the location of the helper’s activities to the best that it can be determined. Keep in mind that the helper’s activity during the war might have been in one country but that the person, or his or her descendants, might be living somewhere else after the war. For example, Charlotte Ambach we have listed under Belgium where she was living when she aided Allied airmen, not The Netherlands where she was born, Germany where she grew up, or the U.S. where she was living later in life. If you do not immediately find a helper’s name where you expect it to be, try using Control + F to search the entire list. The name may turn up somewhere else, e.g., in France rather than Belgium or vice versa and in Belgium (especially in the case of Flemish names) rather than in The Netherlands or vice versa. Note also that when we have indexed lists of attendees at AFEES reunions, some names may be of persons who attended the reunions infrequently and it may not be clear if the person, especially a woman, was a helper or a family member of an evader. Be sure to check both the Evader and Helper Indexes, using Control+F to search the indexes.\n\nNote that some names that include a separate “de” may be listed with the “de” before or after the main part of the name.\n\nMany Dutch and Belgian names appear with “De” “d'”, “Van”, “Van de”, “Van den”, “Van der”, or “V.d.” before the main part of the name. To be sure of finding a correct spelling and not get lost in the many listings, use “Control+F” to find the main part of the name.\n\nTo search for the names of traitors, go to “Index to Other Subjects” and scroll down to “Traitors, Collaborators” near the bottom of the page.\n\nSome helpers’ names may have been spelled different ways in different AFEES newsletters or other publications, resulting in a helper’s name appearing in different places in the index. Where this becomes apparent to the indexer, there will be a cross reference to the alternate spelling.\n\nIn August 2022, all the names from the 1993 Membership List of helpers were added to the index below. Each listing has a link to the 1993 AFEES Membership List.\n\nIn 1965, evader William H. Spinning authored “Operation Bonaparte“, an account of the escape operation of the Shelburne Escape Line. It is available on this website. Ninety-four evaders are listed in “Operation Bonaparte” on pg. 11 of the publication alone. Other evaders are listed elsewhere in the publication. The evaders’ names appear in the Index to Evaders. Twenty helpers are identified as well. Links to the helpers’ names appear below in the Index to Helpers. Operation Bonaparte appears to represent the first reunion of AFEES and its pdf file appears first on the list of pdf files of AFEES newsletters. The front cover of Operation Bonaparte appears as follows:\n\nCOUNTRY NOT IDENTIFIED\n\nBaker, George (Intrepidus) & Christine – Mar. 1997, pg. 5 (CC); Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC); Spring (March) 2005, pg. 27 (CC);\n\nBlye, Faye – Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC);\n\nBoutron, Jean – Winter 1989-1990, pg. 4;\n\nButzelaar, Anneke – Summer 1989, pg. 6, 8;\n\nCollez, Marcel – Spring (March) 2003, pg. 30 (list only);\n\nCorriere, Sebastian H. – March 2002, pg. 28 (CC);\n\nCriscit, Elsie – Summer 1987 pg. 12\n\nDelnet, Maria – Spring Mockup 1986, pg. 8 (6th sheet);\n\nFarson, Ralph and Terry – Summer 1990, pg. 10 (CC);\n\nHall, Bud – Summer 1991, pg. 8;\n\nHugonnet, Ernest – Summer 1987 pg. 4;\n\nIliescu, Cornell – December 1997, pg. 20;\n\nIntrepidus – March 2002, pg. 28 (CC); Spring 2003 (March), pg. 4 (CC); Spring (March) 2004, pg. 24 (CC);\n\nJordan, James W. – Summer 1990, pg. 5;\n\nKeshishien, Jacques – Summer 1989, pg. 8;\n\nKoenig, Kristine – Mar. 1997, pg. 5 (CC);\n\nKrugermierer, Mr. and Mrs. – RAFES (Canadian Branch) Sept. 1986 – part 1, pg. 7 (RAFES?);\n\nLacren, Lucienne and Desire – March (Spring) 1998, pg. 6 (CC); Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC); March 2002, pg. 28 (CC);\n\nLacren, Rene and Aimee – March (Spring) 1998, pg. 6 (CC); Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC); March 2002, pg. 28 (CC);\n\nLarren, Lash (Iash?) – Summer 1991, pg. 8;\n\nLe Tanou (first name not given) – Spring Mockup 1986, pg. 8;\n\nLuzik, Robert and Mary (May) (daughter of Serge Tartes) – Summer 1989, pg. 4, 15; 2006 Membership Directory, pg. 36;\n\nLyle, Lew and Betty – Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC); March 2008, pg. 7; March 2002, pg. 28 (CC); Spring (March) 2005, pg. 27 (CC);\n\nMillar, Frances – Spring (March) 2005, pg. 27 (CC);\n\nSpring (March)2006, pg. 11(CC);\n\nPike, Kristine – Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC);\n\nRogoff, Manny – Summer 1989, pg. 20;\n\nRooven(k)s, Monsieur – Winter 1989-1990, pg. 8 (folded wings);\n\nSchapendonk, Pierre & Jacqueline – Winter 1991-92, pg. 3;\n\nStone, Christopher – Summer 1992, pg. 19;\n\nVallel, Maire Therese and J. – Summer 1989, pg. 8;\n\nVuchovic, Mrs. Zvonko – March 2008, pg. 7; Spring (February) 2007, pg. 27;\n\nVujnovich, George – 2006 Membership Directory, pg. 36;\n\nALBANIA\n\nAlbanian Partisans – May 1999, pg. 5;\n\nANDORRA\n\nPuigdellivol, Antonio – Winter 1990-91, pg. 2, 26 (chief of passeurs);\n\nAUSTRALIA\n\nBenko (Beniko), Ivanka & Frances – March 1997, pg. 5 (CC); March 1998, pg. 6 (CC); Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC); March (Spring) 2001, pg. 20 (CC); March 2002, pg.28 (CC); Spring 2003 (March), pg. 4 (helped John Rucigay); Spring (March) 2004, pg. 24 (CC); Spring (February) 2007, pg. 27 (CC); 1993 AFEES Membership List;\n\nBott, Lloyd and Mrs. Gwen- Australia flotilla MGB 502 evac. evaders from Brittany – Sept. 1997, pg. 13; March 1997 (CC); Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC); March (Spring) 2001, pg. 20 (CC); March 2002, pg. 28 (CC); Spring 2003 (March), pg. 4; Spring (March) 2004, pg. 24 (CC); Spring (March) 2005, pg. 27 (CC); Spring (March)2006, pg. 11(CC); see 1993 AFEES Membership List;\n\nDell, Frank and Isabel – See under United Kingdom.\n\nFree, Jim – Spring (March) 2004, pg. 24 (CC);\n\nGrolez, Jean – see 1993 AFEES Membership List;\n\nGrolez, John – Feb. 1999, pg. 8 (CC); Winter 1991-92, pg. 15 (French member of La Vois du Nord in Pas Calais);\n\nHeller, Ernest – see 1993 AFEES Membership List;\n\nHines, Norman – Australian flotilla MGB 502 evac. evaders from Brittany – Sept. 1997, pg. 13;\n\nHorseley, Bob – Spring (March) 2004, pg. 24 (CC);\n\nSmith, Andrew – Australian flotilla MGB 502 evac. evaders from Brittany – Sept. 1997, pg. 13; Spring (February) 2007, pg. 27 (CC);\n\nWake-Forward, Nancy – Spring 2003 (March), pg. 4 (CC returned); see also “How Nancy Wake Saved Countless Lives, Enemy of the Reich” on You Tube.\n\nWebb, Billy – Australian flotilla MGB 502 evac. evaders from Brittany – Sept. 1997, pg. 13; Summer (June) 2004, pg. 27;\n\nWilliams, Peter – Australian flotilla MGB 502 evac. evaders from Brittany – Sept. 1997, pg. 13;\n\nBELGIUM – Ab-Ay\n\nAbrassart, Yvon – see 1993 AFEES Membership List; March 1997, pg. 19 (deceased listing only);\n\nAdams, Janine – See under Dardenne, Janine\n\nAerts, Rosa – September 2009, pg. 6;\n\nAhles, M. & Mme Roger – Summer 1991, pg. 4;\n\nAlene, Rev.
