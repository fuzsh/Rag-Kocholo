A major proponent of the serve-and-volley style of tennis, he won six Grand Slam singles titles and three Grand Slam men's doubles titles between 1985 and 1996. He also won the Masters Grand Prix and was a part of the Swedish Davis Cup-winning-team four times. In addition he won four Masters Series titles, four Championship Series titles and the unofficial Olympic tournament 1984, was ranked in the singles top 10 for ten successive years, and ranked 9 years in the top 5.

From 1999 to 2015, he hosted the late-night comedy show TV total and has also created a number of other television shows, such as Schlag den Raab and Bundesvision Song Contest. In the early 2010s, Raab was considered the \"most powerful man in German entertainment television\".Raab is also known for his recurring role as producer, writer and performer of German entries to the Eurovision Song Contest beginning in 1998.

He played for Germany on more than 30 occasions – in a career which was cut short after a run-in with the management – representing the nation in one World Cup and one European Championship. His nickname is Der Tiger [dɛɐ̯ ˈtiːɡɐ] (the tiger).\n\nStefan Christian Holm (born 25 May 1976) is a retired Swedish high jumper.

He is currently coach of Swedish high jumper Sofie Skoog.\n\nStefan Zweig (; German: [tsvaɪk]; 28 November 1881 – 22 February 1942) was an Austrian novelist, playwright, journalist and biographer. At the height of his literary career, in the 1920s and 1930s, he was one of the most popular writers in the world."
