May 7, 1961, Taipei, Taiwan), chairman of the government of Hubei (1929-32, 1937-38). He joined the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance in Japan in 1905 and returned in 1909. He participated in revolutionary actions at various times. In 1927, he was named director-general of the National Revolutionary Army headquarters, and helped in the April 12 Incident against the Communist Party members. Soon after that, he was appointed chief of staff of the 1st Army Group. He was head of the execution bureau during World War II, and was elected speaker of the Hubei Provincial Council upon the end of the war. He went to Hong Kong in the spring of 1949 and then to Taiwan in 1950, being nominated as a \"policy adviser.\"\n\nHe Fenglin (b. 1873, Pingyin, Shandong, China - d. 1939, Beijing, China), Chinese minister of military affairs (1927-28). A graduate of Tianjin Military College, his military posts were mainly in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the top of which was commander of the 1st Army of the Zhejiang-Shanghai United Forces. He turned to Zhang Zuolin in 1927 as his defense area was occupied by the southern army, and was involved in the execution of Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, in Beijing. He was named the chief councillor of the Bureau of Commanders for the Northeastern Army. In 1938 he became the minister of military affairs of the Japanese-controlled North China Political Committee.\n\nHe Peirong (b. 1880, Jianshi, Hubei, China - d. June 6, 1942), civil governor of Hubei (1919-20). Having graduated from the Japanese College of Army Commanders, he returned to China, serving in the Beiyang Army led by Yuan Shikai as the chief of staff of the 2nd Division. During his term as governor, he also took over the financial post. He \"quit politics\" in 1921, moving to Qingdao and then to Hankou (now a district of Wuhan city). In 1939, he became the speaker of the Japanese-backed \"Senate of Wuhan Special Municipality,\" a municipal legislative organization subordinated to Wang Jingwei's \"National Government\" in Nanjing, and later was designated governor of Hubei by the Japanese. He was poisoned to death by his concubine in 1942.\n\nHe Rong (b. October 1962, Linyi county [now part of Dezhou city], Shandong, China), justice minister of China (2023- ).\n\nHe Xiangning (b. Aug. 14, 1879, Nanhai, Guangdong, China - d. Sept. 1, 1972, Beijing, China), Chinese politician. She was married to Liao Zhongkai in 1897. In 1902, she went abroad to Japan, where she made acquaintance with Sun Yat-sen. She joined the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance in 1905 and joined all the major revolutionary activities together with Sun Yat-sen. Like Liao Zhongkai, she was always a Kuomintang leftist. After her husband was assassinated, she turned against Chiang Kai-shek. She was one of the founders of the China Association for the Promotion of Democracy as well as the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee (KMT-RC). After the establishment of the People's Republic, she was elected vice-chairwoman of the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and president of the All Women's Federation. She was also vice-chairwoman of the KMT-RC.\n\nHe Yaozu\n\nHe Yaozu (Pinyin), Wade-Giles Ho Yao-tsu (b. May 13, 1889, Ningxiang, Hunan, China - d. July 16, 1961, Beijing, China), chairman of the Provincial Council of Gansu (1937). He joined the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance when studying at the Japanese College of Army Commanders. Having returned to China, he served in the forces of Zhao Hengti in Hunan, who later became Hunan governor. He joined the National Revolutionary Army during the Northern Expedition, becoming an army commander. He also had experience of being an ambassador, posted to Turkey (1934-36) and the U.S.S.R. (1938-40). He acted as Gansu chairman and also (1942-45) as mayor of Chongqing, which became the capital after the fall of Nanjing during World War II. After the war, he was named a \"strategic adviser\" of Chiang Kai-shek. However, he disagreed with Chiang's policy of waging a civil war against the Communist Party. In August 1949, he declared his revolt with Huang Shaohong in Hong Kong and later went to Beijing to attend the 1st Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in September 1949. In the People's Republic, he was elected a member of the Military Commission of Central and Southern China, concurrently serving as minister of transportation. He was also a member of the Standing Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee.\n\nHe Yingqin (Pinyin), Wade-Giles Ho Ying-ch'in (b. April 2, 1889, Xingyi, Guizhou, China - d. Oct. 21, 1987, Taipei, Taiwan), Chinese politician. He became commander of the 1st Brigade of the Nationalist Army in Guangdong and helped repress anti-government insurrections in southern China by deposed, yet still-powerful, warlords. In 1927-28 he was chairman of the government of Zhejiang. In 1929 he became a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) and chief of staff of the Nationalist Army. In 1944 He was made commander in chief of the Chinese Army, and as such accepted (Sept. 9, 1945) the unconditional surrender of one million Japanese troops in Nanjing (Nanking) at the end of World War II. In 1949 he briefly served as prime minister of China before fleeing to Taiwan with the Nationalists when the Communists took control. In Taiwan he was defense minister from 1949 to 1958.\n\nHe Zonglian (b. 1864, Pingyang, Shandong, China - d. Aug. 26, 1931, Licheng [now part of Jinan], Shandong), governor of Chahar (1912, 1913-15). He was the commander of the 1st Division of the Beiyang army (the army of the central government during 1912-16), stationed in Chahar. He was recalled to Beijing in 1914 and nominated as the aide of the president's office.\n\nHead, Antony Henry Head, (1st) Viscount (b. Dec. 19, 1906, London, England - d. March 29, 1983, Bishopstone, near Salisbury, Wiltshire, England), British secretary of state for war (1951-56) and defence minister (1956-57). He was also high commissioner to Nigeria (1960-63) and Malaysia (1963-66). He was created viscount in 1960.\n\nHead, Sir Edmund Walker, (8th) Baronet (b. Feb. 16, 1805, Wiarton Place, near Maidstone, Kent, England - d. Jan. 28, 1868, London, England), lieutenant governor of New Brunswick (1848-54) and governor of Canada (1854-61). He was also governor of the Hudson's Bay Company (1863-68). He succeeded as baronet in 1838.\n\nHead, Natt (b. May 20, 1828, Hooksett, N.H. - d. Nov. 12, 1883, Hooksett), governor of New Hampshire (1879-81).\n\nHealey\n\nHealey, Denis (Winston) Healey, Baron (b. Aug. 30, 1917, Mottingham, Kent, England - d. Oct. 3, 2015, Alfriston, Sussex, England), British politician. After World War II he went into the Labour Party secretariat and was head of its international department for seven years before becoming a member of Parliament in 1952. He won a reputation in Parliament as a tough-minded man who was always prepared to say what he thought and give as good as he got. This did not endear him to his critics, but he once said, \"I am not in politics to be loved.\" One of the best known and most experienced of European politicians, in the 1970s Healey seemed the most likely successor to James Callaghan as leader of the party, but in 1980 he was beaten by Michael Foot in the first of a series of confrontations between left and right. Healey had antagonized the left by rejection of unilateral disarmament and by what were held to be right-wing economic measures when he was chancellor of the exchequer in the Labour government of 1974-79. His commitment to a defense policy based on nuclear deterrence was rooted in his experience as defence secretary for six years (1964-70). Healey instead became deputy party leader in 1980. Challenged from the left by Tony Benn, he held on to the post by only a small margin in the September 1981 party conference. He quit the post in October 1983. In 1992 he was made a life peer.\n\nM. Healey\n\nHealey, Maura (Tracy) (b. Feb. 8, 1971, Bethesda, Md.), governor of Massachusetts (2023- ). She became the first openly lesbian governor in the U.S. (followed within days by Tina Kotek).\n\nHealy, Jerramiah (T.) (b. December 1950), mayor of Jersey City (2004-13).\n\nT.M. Healy\n\nHealy, T(imothy) M(ichael), byname Tim Healy, Irish Tadhg Ó hEaluithe (b. May 17, 1855, Bantry, County Cork, Ireland - d. March 26, 1931, Chapelizod, County Dublin), governor-general of Ireland (1922-28). He became secretary of the Newcastle branch of the Home Rule Association of Great Britain, an organization established in Manchester in the early 1870s by Isaac Butt. In 1878 he came to London to write a weekly letter for the Nation, describing the doings of the Irish nationalists, under Charles Stewart Parnell, in the House of Commons. After being arrested for intimidation in connection with the Land League, he was promptly returned as member of Parliament for Wexford (1880). He made a reputation for his eloquence and also for his grasp of the most complicated bills in committee. He became an authority on the Irish land question, and the \"Healy Clause\" of the Land Act of 1881, which protected tenant farmers' agrarian improvements from rent increases imposed by landlords, not only made him popular in southern Ireland but also won him seats in Protestant Ulster. He broke with Parnell in 1886 and generally remained at odds with the Irish Nationalist Party, though he was a strong supporter of proposals for Irish Home Rule. Dissatisfied with both the Liberals and the Irish Nationalists after the Easter Rising in 1916, Healy supported the Sinn Féin party after 1917. His parliamentary career came to an end in 1918; he did not stand at that election, preferring to yield his seat to a Sinn Féin member. Because he was regarded as an elder statesman by the British and Irish ministries, he was proposed by both sides in 1922 as governor-general of the new Irish Free State, a post he held until his resignation and retirement in 1928.\n\nHeape, William Leslie (b. Aug. 5, 1896, Lancashire, England - d. Dec. 29, 1972, London, England), administrator of Grenada (1935-40).\n\nHeard, William W(right) (b. April 28, 1853, Union parish, La. - d. May 31, 1926, New Orleans, La.), governor of Louisiana (1900-04).\n\nHearne, Dennis (Walter) (b. Sept. 26, 1959, North Carolina), international supervisor of Brcko (2017-18). He was also U.S. ambassador to Mozambique (2019-22).\n\nHearnes, Warren E(astman) (b. July 24, 1923, Moline, Ill. - d. Aug. 16, 2009, Charleston, Mo.), governor of Missouri (1965-73).\n\nHeartz, Frank Richard (b. Jan. 7, 1871, Charlottetown, P.E.I. - d. Sept. 15, 1955, Charlottetown), lieutenant governor of Prince Edward Island (1924-30).\n\nHeath\n\nHeath, Sir Edward (Richard George), byname Ted Heath (b. July 9, 1916, Broadstairs, Kent, England - d. July 17, 2005, Salisbury, Wiltshire, England), British prime minister (1970-74). He was elected to Parliament as a Conservative in February 1950. In February 1951 he became an assistant whip. After a succession of posts in the whip's office he was made parliamentary secretary to the Treasury and chief government whip under Prime Minister Anthony Eden in December 1955. He served as minister of labour under Prime Minister Harold Macmillan from October 1959 to July 1960, when he became lord privy seal with Foreign Office responsibilities. In this capacity he represented Britain in negotiations for entry into the European Economic Community (EEC). In October 1963 he became secretary of state for industry, trade, and regional development and president of the Board of Trade. After the Conservative defeat in October 1964, Heath became a major opposition figure. Upon Sir Alec Douglas-Home's resignation he was elected leader of the opposition in July 1965. His party suffered a decisive defeat in the March 1966 election but won in that of June 1970, defeating Prime Minister Harold Wilson's Labour Party. As prime minister, Heath had to face the violent conflict in Northern Ireland, over which he imposed direct rule in 1972. He scored a major triumph by winning French acceptance of British entry into the EEC in 1972-73. He proved unable to cope with mounting economic problems. He called for a general election on Feb. 28, 1974. The Conservatives lost seats to Labour and Heath failed to form a coalition government. The Conservatives were defeated in another general election in October, and he was replaced as party leader by Margaret Thatcher in 1975. He remained a backbench member of Parliament until he retired in 2001. He was knighted in 1992.\n\nHeatley, David Walter Reginald (b. Sept. 29, 1905, Dunedin, N.Z. - d. Dec. 22, 1997, Waihi Beach, N.Z.), resident commissioner of Niue (1958-62).\n\nHeaton, Sir Herbert Henniker (b. Feb. 9, 1880 - d.

He was minister of industry (1944-48) and light industry (1948) before being dismissed and arrested, apparently for his adherence to the \"orthodox\" Communist (Moscow) line and his disagreement with the \"deviationist\" policy pursued by the Yugoslav government. According to different accounts, he either was killed or committed suicide in prison.\n\nHebrang, Andrija (b. Jan. 27, 1946, Belgrade, Serbia), defense minister of Croatia (1998); son of the above.

He was elected chairman of the party at the early age of 36 in 1939, but he was forced to resign in 1941 on account of his outspoken opposition to the German occupiers. He was already a figure in the resistance movement, but his open clash with the Nazis gave him an even greater reputation among all Danes who refused to compromise with the invaders. Among his activities on behalf of the resistance was his conduct of an underground newspaper. Two years after the end of the war he became prime minister. Ousted by a conservative-agrarian coalition in 1950, he was returned three years later as head of a minority government. A sincere democrat - \"better a democracy without socialism than socialism without democracy,\" he once said - he was the principal exponent of the Nordic Council, formed in 1952 by Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Iceland.

The same year, he joined other Soviet-bloc heads of government in signing the treaty establishing the Warsaw Pact, the Communist alliance organized after West Germany was admitted to NATO. A year later, amid popular demonstrations against Soviet domination, Hegedüs signed a formal request for Soviet intervention to prevent Hungary from overthrowing Communist rule. The Soviets launched a massive attack on Budapest, using tens of thousands of troops and more than 2,000 tanks. About 200,000 Hungarians fled the country, and thousands of others were arrested. Later, Hegedüs fled to Moscow, where he continued academic studies. He returned to Hungary in 1958, but stayed out of politics. In 1968, he spoke out against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, in which troops from the Soviet Union and its allies crushed a reform Communist movement. While remaining a committed socialist, Hegedüs became increasingly vocal in his criticism of the Hungarian government. In 1973, he was expelled from the Hungarian Communist Party.

He was elected president of the Federal Republic on March 5, 1969, by the slenderest of majorities. While still president-elect he gave an interview in which he suggested West Germany might leave NATO and disband the armed forces as a prelude to German reunification. This was a controversial first demonstration of the new president's view of his office - that it was his duty to state his opinion conscientiously and in a nonpartisan manner. Throughout his term he never feared to issue solemn warnings against the shortcomings in West German society he identified. This won him high respect and there was genuine regret when he refused a second five-year term in 1974 on grounds of age.\n\nHeinen, Eelco (b.

In the 1970s he opposed the republican government of Mohammad Daud Khan, and he became a mujahideen in the 1980s, leading the fundamentalist faction of the Hezb-i-Islami, dedicated to the overthrow of the Soviet-backed Communist regime. Though nominally an ally of Burhanuddin Rabbani during the Communist period, he laid siege to Kabul after Rabbani was installed as president in 1992. He and Defense Minister Ahmad Shah Masood waged a bloody battle that destroyed about 70% of Kabul. An Iranian-brokered peace accord brought Hekmatyar into the government as prime minister, but the fighting continued as alliances shifted and other factions besieged the capital. The Taliban took advantage of the strife and captured Kabul in 1996. He went into exile in Iran. After the U.S. ousted the Taliban regime, Hekmatyar came to be suspected of plotting against the U.S.-backed government, and the CIA tried to kill him in 2002, firing a Hellfire missile from an unmanned Predator spy plane near Kabul; the missile did not get him but was believed to have killed some of his followers.

His attacks on Finance Minister Matthias Erzberger led to a defamation lawsuit in 1920 which Helfferich lost but also discredited Erzberger so much that he had to resign. Helfferich was elected to the Reichstag in the same year. In 1923 he proposed a new currency to combat inflation. The Rentenmark introduced in November 1923 was based on his concept. His appointment as president of the Reichsbank was vetoed by the government, however. He died in a rail accident.\n\nHelgason, Hördur (b. March 27, 1923, Ísafjördur, Iceland - d.

Oct. 31, 1949, Pärnu, Estonian S.S.R.), interior minister of Estonia (2019-20). He was also ambassador to Russia (1995-99). In 2013-20 he was chairman of the far-right Conservative People's Party. He has publicly expressed xenophobic, sexist, and homophobic views (e.g. describing a gay pride parade as a \"parade of perverts\"). Nevertheless his party, having won 18% of the vote, was included in a government coalition by the Centre Party in 2019. He resigned as minister in November 2020 after saying gay people in Estonia should go to Sweden and that U.S. president-elect Joe Biden was a corrupt character elected by the \"deep state.\"\n\nHelme, Martin (b. April 24, 1976, Tallinn, Estonian S.S.R.), finance minister (2019-21) and acting interior minister (2020) of Estonia; son of Mart Helme. An unabashed racist, he is known for saying the country's migration policy should be \"If you're black, go back\" and \"I want Estonia to be a white country\" and, like his father, making a white-power gesture when sworn in as minister. He took over the chairmanship of the Conservative People's Party from his father in July 2020.\n\nHelmer, Oskar (b. Nov. 16, 1887, Gattendorf, Hungary [now in Burgenland, Austria] - d. Feb. 13, 1963, Vienna, Austria), interior minister of Austria (1945-59).\n\nHelminen, Heimo (b. March 4, 1878, Jyväskylä, Finland - d. March 17, 1947, Helsinki, Finland), justice minister (1921-22) and interior minister (1922) of Finland.\n\nJ. Helms\n\nHelms, Jesse (Alexander) (b. Oct. 18, 1921, Monroe, N.C. - d. July 4, 2008, Raleigh, N.C.), U.S. politician. He was elected to the Raleigh city council in 1957 and never lost an election thereafter. Originally a Democrat, Helms left the Democratic Party in 1970 and two years later won a Senate seat as a Republican. He was subsequently reelected, including a notoriously expensive race in 1984 against Gov. James B. Hunt, Jr. At first he was known, to the extent he was known at all, as a right-wing curmudgeon, but that changed in 1980 when U.S. voters put fellow conservative Ronald Reagan in the White House. With a conservative president, a much more conservative Congress, and such New Right groups as the Moral Majority making their presence felt, Helms - second only to Reagan in the hearts of many right-wingers - was in his element. From his position as chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, he set himself up as a kind of one-man litmus tester of Reagan appointees, managing to delay (if not prevent) several appointments on the grounds that the nominees were too liberal. He played a major role in backing the administration's budget cuts - even as he fought successfully to retain subsidies for his state's tobacco farmers - and led crusades against homosexuality and abortion. His installation as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1994 assured him of a powerful voice in foreign affairs. With Republican Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana, he co-sponsored the Helms-Burton Act (1996), which punished certain foreign companies that did business with Cuba. In a well-publicized round of political hardball in 1997, Helms prevented the confirmation of Pres. Bill Clinton's nominee for the ambassadorship to Mexico, William F. Weld, a moderate Republican. He retired in 2003.\n\nR. Helms\n\nHelms, Richard (McGarrah) (b. March 30, 1913, St. Davids, Pa. - d. Oct. 22, 2002, Washington, D.C.), CIA director (1966-73). As a reporter he gained some notice for his exclusive interview with Adolf Hitler in 1936. He began his spying career during World War II when he was assigned to the Office of Strategic Services, which became the CIA in 1947. He rose steadily through the ranks and in 1965 became deputy director. In 1966 Pres. Lyndon B. Johnson made him director. He was the first career spy to head the agency. Helms played a critical role in many of the CIA's most controversial operations, from plotting the assassinations of foreign leaders such as Fidel Castro to overthrowing the Chilean government of Pres. Salvador Allende. Under Pres. Richard Nixon, the CIA's role in domestic spying hovered on the extreme edge of the agency's charter and at times crossed over into illegal activities. When Nixon tried to enlist Helms' help in blocking the FBI's investigation into the Watergate affair and he refused to cooperate, Nixon gave Helms the boot and appointed him ambassador to Iran, where he served from March 1973. Over the next few years, he was repeatedly called back to Washington to testify before congressional committees investigating the CIA's activities. By the mid-1970s it had become clear that he had intentionally misled Senate committees. In December 1976 he quit his ambassadorship. When federal prosecutors announced they would seek to indict him for perjury, he responded aggressively, saying he was prepared to publicly reveal matters the government wanted to remain untold. The Justice Department took his bluff seriously and backed down. In the end, prosecutors offered Helms a plea bargain by which he paid a $2,000 fine and received a suspended two-year prison sentence.\n\nHelo, Johan, original surname (until 1906) Helenius (b. Aug. 22, 1889, Helsingfors [now Helsinki], Finland - d. Oct. 25, 1966, Helsinki), finance minister of Finland (1944-45). He was also minister of social affairs (1926-27), transport and public works (1927), and education (1945) and ambassador to France (1946-56).\n\nHeløe, Leif Arne (b. Aug. 8, 1932, Harstad, Troms, Norway), governor of Troms (1991-2000). He was also Norwegian minister of social affairs (1981-86).\n\nC. Hélou\n\nHélou, Charles (Alexandre), Arabic Sharl Iskandar Hilu (b. Dec. 25, 1912, Beirut, Lebanon - d. Jan. 7, 2001, Zalka, Lebanon), president of Lebanon (1964-70). He served as ambassador to the Vatican in 1947, was elected to parliament in 1951, and held several cabinet posts, including foreign minister (1951-52), minister of justice and public health (1954-55), and of education (1964). Not long after his inauguration as president in 1964, Hélou agreed at an Arab summit meeting to Arab sponsorship of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), but he refused to allow the stationing of PLO bases in Lebanon, an issue that grew increasingly explosive in the course of his term. In 1968-69 a pattern emerged in which the Christian president and the army command opposed the stationing of Palestinian guerrillas in Lebanon, while the Muslim prime minister, Rashid Karami, favoured it. Under great pressure from Arab nations and from Lebanese Muslims, Hélou in 1969 moved to avert a crisis by accepting Karami's proposed policy of coordination between the PLO and the Lebanese Army. The so-called Cairo Agreement of November 1969 was intended to limit the guerrillas' freedom of movement, end their military training in refugee camps, and stop the guerrillas from firing at Israel before they had actually entered Israeli territory. The purpose was to prevent Lebanese villagers and other civilians from getting hurt in Israeli counterattacks. Critics argued that the Cairo Agreement forced the guerrillas into strongholds in southeast Lebanon which, while reducing friction with the Lebanese, led to a rise in attacks on Israel as well as increased Israeli retaliation, which was not confined to the guerrillas' allotted areas. Hélou was also an honorary president of the group of French-speaking nations.\n\nE.A. Helou\n\nHelou, Esperidião Amin, Filho (b. Dec. 21, 1947, Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil), governor of Santa Catarina (1983-87, 1999-2003). He was also mayor of Florianópolis (1975-78, 1989-90).\n\nHeltzen, Eugenius Sophus Ernst (b.

Oct. 20, 1935, London, England), British politician. He contested Newcastle in the Liberal interest at the 1895 general election, but his trade union interests soon drew him into the political working-class movement, and in 1903 he entered the House of Commons as a Labour Party member from Barnard Castle Division, Durham, in what was Labour's first electoral victory over candidates from both the Conservative and Liberal parties. He was chief party whip in the Commons in 1914, 1921-23, and 1925-27. In 1908-10 and 1914-17 he was chairman of the Labour Party, and in 1911-34 he was party secretary. In August 1914, with the majority of the Labour MPs, he expressed support for the British effort in World War I. He thereupon took over the party's parliamentary leadership from Ramsay MacDonald, who then headed Labour's pacifist minority. In H.H. Asquith's wartime coalition government of 1915-16, he first was president of the Board of Education and later paymaster general and governmental adviser on labour matters. He became a minister without portfolio in David Lloyd George's five-man war cabinet. He resigned from the cabinet on Aug. 12, 1917. With the Socialist reformer Sidney Webb he largely wrote the party constitution (1918), which made Labour for the first time an avowed Socialist party with effective constituency organizations. When Labour held power for the first time (1924), he served as home secretary under MacDonald. He was foreign secretary (1929-31) in MacDonald's second Labour ministry. He resigned that post when MacDonald formed a national coalition government. In 1932-33 he was president of the World Disarmament Conference, and he received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in 1934.\n\nHenderson, Charles (b. April 26, 1860, Henderson, Ala. - d.

Hendricks\n\nHendricks, Thomas A(ndrews) (b. Sept. 7, 1819, near Zanesville, Ohio - d. Nov. 25, 1885, Indianapolis, Ind.), governor of Indiana (1873-77) and U.S. vice president (1885); nephew of William Hendricks. He was elected to the Indiana legislature in 1848 and as a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1850. He represented the Indianapolis district in the U.S. Congress (1851-55), was commissioner of the U.S. General Land Office (1855-59), and a member of the U.S. Senate (1863-69), of which he was regarded as the Democratic leader. He was loyal to the Union but opposed many aspects of the Republican-dominated military effort in the American Civil War (1861-65) and the Radical Reconstruction program for the South afterward. He favoured leniency toward the white supremacists in the South and opposed all legislation aimed at assisting freedmen, either politically or economically. In the Democratic national convention of 1868 in New York, he was strongly supported for the nomination to the presidency. As candidate for the governorship of Indiana, he was defeated in 1860 and 1868, but was elected in 1872. He was the vice presidential nominee, with Samuel J. Tilden, in the disputed election of 1876, losing by the decision of a special Electoral Commission. Nominated again in 1884, he was finally elected, with Grover Cleveland as president. Hendricks was a strict party man and was not so liberal towards his opponents as Cleveland. He died less than nine months after his inauguration.\n\nHendricks, William (b. Nov. 12, 1782, Westmoreland county, Pa. - d. May 16, 1850, near Madison, Ind.), governor of Indiana (1822-25).\n\nHendricks Díaz, Joaquín (Ernesto) (b. Nov. 7, 1951, Chetumal, Quintana Roo, Mexico), governor of Quintana Roo (1999-2005).\n\nHendrickse, Allan, byname of Helenard Joe Hendrickse (b. Oct. 22, 1927, Uitenhage, Cape province [now Kariega, Eastern Cape], South Africa - d. March 16, 2005, Port Elizabeth [now Gqeberha], Eastern Cape), South African politician. In 1969 he became a founder member of the Labour Party (LP), serving as its first national chairman. He was elected to the Coloured Representative Council (CRC) and in 1975 to its executive. In January 1978 he became a member of the interim committee formed to create the South African Black Alliance (Saba), which linked the LP, Inkatha, and the Indian Reform Party. He stated that constitutional arrangements which did not include blacks could not be regarded as final or a guarantee of peace and security. In elections in August 1984, he became MP for Swartkops in the tricameral parliament's House of Representatives (reserved for Coloureds), and his party took 76 of the 80 elected seats; he became chairman of that house's Ministers' Council. In August 1987 he threatened to block constitutional changes, proposed by the ruling National Party (NP), to delay a general election for a further three years, unless the government made a commitment to scrap the Group Areas Act. The LP continued to block constitutional amendments requested by the NP, forcing South Africa to the polls again in 1989. Hendrickse retained his seat, with the LP remaining the majority party in the House of Representatives. He lost control, however, in 1992 when the bulk of his members joined the NP - which had ushered in reforms in 1990 and unbanned the African National Congress (ANC). His rival Jac Rabie became the new leader in the Coloured house. Hendrickse later joined the ANC and, in 1994, became one of the party's senators in the then-upper house of the new democratic parliament. He retired from active politics at the next election.\n\nHendrickson, Waino (Edward) (b. June 18, 1896, Juneau, Alaska - d. June 19, 1983), U.S. politician. He was encouraged to run for mayor of Juneau in 1946. He won and served until 1953. His most important work as mayor was getting the city power to levy and use sales tax. There was no sales tax prior to this, and in the days before oil money, cities had virtually no way to raise funds. Hendrickson got a sales tax passed to pave the streets, and Juneau thus became the first city in Alaska that was fully paved. Hendrickson also served in the territorial House of Representatives from 1948 to 1953. In 1953, he was named by Pres. Dwight D. Eisenhower to be secretary of state under territorial governor Frank Heintzleman, and served in this position until statehood. During this time, he twice served as acting governor. He was appointed first chairman of the Interior Department's Alaska Field Committee, and then director of the Juneau office of the Bureau of Land Management.\n\nHendrie, Sir John Strathearn (b. Aug. 15, 1857, Hamilton, Canada West [now Ont.] - d. July 17, 1923, Baltimore, Md.), lieutenant governor of Ontario (1914-19); knighted 1915.\n\nHendrikx, Jan (Andreas Marie) (b.

April 16, 1962, Spring City, Abaco, Bahamas), foreign minister of The Bahamas (2017-21).\n\nHeng Samrin\n\nHeng Samrin, Samdech (Akka Moha Ponhea Chakrei) (b. May 25, 1934, Prey Veng province, Cambodia), president of the People's Revolutionary Council (1979-81), chairman of the Council of State (1981-92), and secretary-general of the People's Revolutionary Party (1981-91) of Cambodia (Kampuchea). Under Pol Pot, he was a political commissar and commander of a Khmer Rouge army division. In May 1978, he defected to Vietnam. On Dec. 3, 1978, Hanoi radio announced the formation of the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation and its military arm, the Kampuchean Revolutionary Armed Forces. This new Vietnamese-backed organization, whose goal was the overthrow of the Chinese-supported Pol Pot regime, moved with great swiftness, and on Jan. 7, 1979, it captured Phnom Penh, and Heng became head of state. The military activity and ensuing chaos in Cambodia swelled the steady flow of refugees into a flood. Thousands of starving people staggered out of Cambodia into Thailand, where they were placed in desperately undersupplied temporary camps. Conditions were reported to be even worse inside Cambodia, where Heng appeared to be systematically starving portions of the country in hopes of destroying the remnants of the Khmer Rouge. Until late 1979 he refused to facilitate humanitarian assistance offered by the West. He faced continued armed resistance from the Khmer Rouge and other forces and failed to gain widespread diplomatic recognition. In 1985 he effectively lost power to Hun Sen, the new prime minister. Later he became honorary chairman of the Cambodian People's Party, the successor of the People's Revolutionary Party of Kampuchea, and was granted the honorary title of Samdech. He became first vice president of the National Assembly in 1998 and was elected its president on March 21, 2006. In 2007 he was granted the title of Samdech Akka Moha.\n\nHeng Swee Keat (b. April 15, 1961, Singapore), finance minister of Singapore (2015-21). He has also been minister of education (2011-15), a deputy prime minister (2019- ), and coordinating minister for economic policies (2020- ).\n\nHenlein, Konrad (Ernst Eduard) (b. May 6, 1898, Maffersdorf, Bohemia, Austria [now part of Liberec, Czech Republic] - d. May 10, 1945, Plzen, Czechoslovakia), Sudeten German leader. Active in organizations of the German minority in the Sudeten region of Czechoslovakia, he began to organize the Sudeten Germans politically in October 1933 as leader of the Sudeten German Home Front (Sudetendeutsche Heimatfront), in April 1935 renamed Sudeten German Party, which became the second-strongest party in parliament in the May 1935 elections. In November 1937 he offered his services to Adolf Hitler, and in collusion with him he continuously escalated his political demands upon the Czechoslovak government, and paved the way for the cession of the Sudeten region to Germany at the Munich Conference in September 1938. He became Gauleiter (Nazi party district leader) and Reichskommissar, from 1939 Reichsstatthalter, in the Sudetenland. Captured by American forces at the end of World War II, he committed suicide in a prisoner-of-war camp.\n\nHennessy, Sir James (Patrick Ivan) (b. Sept. 23, 1923 - d.

He joined the black insurgents in Haiti against the French in 1790 and, with his gigantic stature and courage, proved an able lieutenant to their leader Toussaint-Louverture. In 1802 he defended Cap-Haïtien against the French. He later joined Jean-Jacques Dessalines in ousting the French (independence was achieved in 1804) and commanded the army under Dessalines, who soon proclaimed himself Emperor Jacques I. In 1806 Christophe assassinated the emperor whose cruelty and debauchery had alienated all his supporters. Alexandre Sabès, dit Pétion, Christophe's only rival for power, secured control in the south and west and was appointed chairman of the assembly to draft a constitution, which made Christophe little more than a figurehead president. In retaliation, Christophe led his troops against Pétion but was defeated on Jan. 6, 1807, and he retreated and set up his own domain in the north. After years of civil war, he was proclaimed king in 1811, and ruled with enthusiasm; he created a hereditary nobility comprising 4 princes, 8 dukes, 22 counts, 37 barons, and 14 knights and built himself 8 palaces and 6 châteaus, and the famous Citadelle Laferrière, a fortress south of his capital at Cap-Haïtien. In 1820 he suffered a stroke, paralyzing him. This led to insurrections against the king, who had become increasingly overbearing and tyrannical; when rebels threatened to reach the palace, he shot himself. The southern president Jean-Pierre Boyer then seized the opportunity to reunite Haiti.\n\nHenry, Albert (Royle) (b. June 11, 1907, Aitutaki, Cook Islands - d.

June 22, 1928, Reykjavík, Iceland - d. Feb. 1, 2010, Gardabær, Iceland), prime minister (1983-87, 1988-91) and foreign minister (1987-88) of Iceland; son of Hermann Jónasson. He served as an MP for the West Fjords constituency (1971-87) and for the Reykjanes constituency (1987-94) and was minister of justice, ecclesiastical affairs, and agriculture (1978-79) and of fisheries and communications (1980-83). When Iceland's right-of-centre government coalition of the Independence Party and the Progressive Party came into office on May 27, 1983, the larger Independence Party demanded and got six out of ten ministries in the cabinet. The office of prime minister was accorded to the Progressives in compensation and was filled by Hermannsson, who was the party's chairman in 1979-94. The new prime minister was considered to be a middle-of-the-road politician. This had enabled him and his party to form coalitions both with the leftist anti-U.S. People's Alliance at one time and with the right-of-centre and pro-U.S. Independence Party at other times, with equal ideological ease. The Progressive Party had its main support in rural areas and confined its interests mostly to farmer-related issues, such as agricultural subsidies and farmers' cooperatives. In international affairs Hermannsson and his party had for years been pro-NATO, but they had at times made moves to go along with left-wing parties to press for the withdrawal of the U.S. base in Iceland. In recent years they had abandoned his position and instead sided with the Independence Party as firm supporters of NATO and the U.S. military presence in the country. In 1994-98, Hermannsson was joint governor of the Central Bank of Iceland.\n\nHermans, Loek, byname of Louis Marie Lucien Henri Alphonse Hermans (b.

Oct. 24, 1936, Ponce, Puerto Rico - d. May 2, 2019, San Juan, Puerto Rico), governor of Puerto Rico (1973-77, 1985-93). He was a protégé of Luis Muñoz Marín and followed the Popular Democratic Party's backing of commonwealth status, asserting that either statehood or independence would result in the island's economic and political ruin. In 1965 he was appointed justice secretary by Gov. Roberto Sánchez Vilella. In 1968 he was elected senator and he became president of the Senate in 1969. In 1972 he was elected governor, defeating the incumbent Luis A. Ferré. In office, he tried to make Puerto Rico less dependent economically on the United States; he sought a greater Puerto Rican role in world trade, immigration control, communications, and transport while favouring the commonwealth's retention of American citizenship, common defense arrangements, and a common economic market. In 1975 he embarked upon a massive housing program, increasing the commonwealth's public works budget by 20% to $600,000,000. He vigorously opposed Cuban intervention in the island's affairs, alleging that there were ties between the Fidel Castro regime and the Puerto Rican Socialist Party. Immediately before the 1977 inauguration of his successor, Carlos Romero Barceló, he reacted strongly to U.S. president Gerald R. Ford's call for the admission of Puerto Rico to the Union as the 51st state. His assertion that statehood contradicted the United States commitment to Puerto Rican self-determination was endorsed by U.S. president Jimmy Carter. In 1980 he again lost the gubernatorial election to Romero, though the margin was very close. In 1984 and 1988 he was reelected.

Hernández\n\nHernández Martínez, Maximiliano (b. Oct. 29, 1882, San Matías, El Salvador - d. April 11, 1966, Jamastrán, Honduras), president of El Salvador (1931-34, 1935-44). Supported by the coffee oligarchy that controlled El Salvador's economy (the so-called \"Fourteen Families\"), he became vice president in 1931. In December 1931 a group of officers overthrew Pres. Arturo Araujo's government and installed Hernández as acting president. Economic and political turmoil led to uprisings in January 1932 of primarily Pipil peasants and urban workers led by the Communist Party, armed mostly with machetes and stones. The army easily defeated the revolts and Communist leader Agustín Farabundo Martí was captured and executed. Pipil leader José Feliciano Ama was hung while his children were forced to watch. In retaliation for the uprisings, Hernández ordered his soldiers to kill anyone who dressed, looked, or sounded indigenous. Some 30,000 people were killed in the span of a few weeks in a massacre known as La Matanza (\"The Slaughter\"). Pipils who survived hid their indigenous heritage, discarded their traditional clothing, and stopped speaking their language. His fiscal responsibility and shrewdness allowed Hernández to reduce the country's debt while building a modern army and infrastructure. He extended his term as president by redrafting or suspending the constitution, but by 1944 the people were tired of his illegal regime. A small police and military coup was launched in April, but was violently put down. On May 5, however, a nationwide strike was organized by university students, bringing business to a halt. When the oligarchy withdrew their support from him, he stepped down on May 9, and one day later fled to Honduras, where he lived until his assassination in 1966.\n\nHernández Ochoa, Rafael (b.

Jan. 17, 1990, Villeurbanne, near Lyon, France), French politician. He was elected (1956) to the National Assembly, where he was a protégé of Socialist leader Pierre Mendès-France and a founding member (1963) of the Unified Socialist Party. After François Mitterrand became head of the reorganized Socialist Party in 1971, Hernu prospered as the party's undisputed expert on defense matters. As President Mitterrand's defense minister (1981-85) and head of the secret service, Hernu expanded and modernized the armed forces and supervised the development and testing of nuclear weapons. In 1983 he ordered more than 3,000 French troops into Chad to combat Libyan incursions into the former French overseas territory. He also endorsed French military actions in Lebanon as part of the UN peacekeeping force. He resigned amid the scandal surrounding the sinking by French agents of the Rainbow Warrior, an unarmed ship sent by the environmentalist organization Greenpeace to protest French nuclear tests in the South Pacific. Although he assumed full responsibility for the \"Greenpeace affair,\" Hernu consistently denied that he had ordered the sabotage of the ship, in which one person was killed. He later admitted that such orders had been given and that he had participated in the attempted cover-up.\n\nHérold, Ferdinand (b. Oct. 16, 1828, Paris, France - d.

May 4, 1925, Acarigua, Venezuela - d. Nov. 9, 2007, Caracas, Venezuela), president of Venezuela (1979-84). With Rafael Caldera, he founded the Social Christian Party (Comité Organizado Pro Elecciones Independientes; COPEI) in 1946. In 1952 he was jailed and deported as a result of his activities against the regime of Pres. Marcos Pérez Jiménez. He went into exile to Europe, where he forged ties between his fledgling party and the European Christian Democratic organizations. He returned to Venezuela after the overthrow of Pérez in 1958. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in 1959 and served many years there as party whip before moving up to the Senate in 1973. Despite his prominence Herrera could not escape being overshadowed by fellow party leader Caldera, who consistently ran as the party's presidential nominee. When Caldera finally won in 1968, he refused to invite Herrera into his administration. Years of frustration were finally rewarded in August 1978 when he received the overwhelming support of the party in his first bid for the Venezuelan presidency. Not an exciting campaigner, he based his appeal on a single word - \"Enough!\" Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the campaign pitting Herrera against Luis Piñerúa Ordaz of the Democratic Action Party was the importation by both sides of media experts from the United States. The candidates relied heavily on televised messages, Piñerúa promising to continue the policies of Pres. Carlos Andrés Pérez (constitutionally prevented from seeking reelection) and Herrera criticizing the Pérez regime for failing to govern efficiently and honestly and for not utilizing the nation's enormous oil revenues wisely. Herrera won the December 1978 election. He tried to open up the economy and shrink the public deficit, but did not fare well.\n\nHerrera Grau, Gustavo (b. April 12, 1890, Caracas, Venezuela - d.
