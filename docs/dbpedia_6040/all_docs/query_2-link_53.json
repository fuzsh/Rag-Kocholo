        "text": "The invocation of a sealed significance, to be disclosed to those with ears to hear, and only to them, is as explicit as in Revelation, in which Prynne’s poetry is steeped. The ‘promise recalled’ suggests another collocation of bread and stone (Psalm 105:40-42):\n\nThe people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river. For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.\n\nThe phrase ‘unlocks the white stone’ is grammatically as well as symbolically ambiguous: the stone might be interpreted either as contents or container. In the Psalm (as in Exodus 17:6), the water is locked within the rock until released by divine intervention. The same collocation of bread and stone occurs in ‘Die a Millionaire (pronounced “diamonds in the air”)’ (Kitchen Poems, Cape Goliard, 1968; Poems, pp13-16), together with ‘the water of life’ (Revelation 22:17: ‘whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely’):\n\n... society is ‘predictably’ as we know ‘in\n\na state of ferment’ — as if that could ever turn\n\nto wine or raise bread, from the sad shit it\n\nis, to that crispy crunchy loaf we shall all\n\neat only in heaven.\n\nThe fact is that right\n\nfrom the springs this water is no longer fit\n\nfor the stones it washes: the water of life\n\nis all in bottles & ready for invoice. To draw\n\nfrom that well we must put on some\n\nother garment.\n\nThe ‘bread’ of ‘heaven’ is directly from Psalm 105. The ‘springs’ and the ‘well’ allude to the source of the Apocalyptic ‘water of life’ in the gospel of St John the Evangelist: ‘the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life’ (J4:14); and the ‘garment’ is the bardic or ‘priestly robe’ (‘He that overcometh shall thus be arrayed in white garments; and I will in no wise blot his name out of the book of life’, R3:5), in which Wordsworth is ‘cloth’d’ at a prophetic moment in The Prelude (Book I 52-67):\n\nto the open fields I told\n\nA prophecy: poetic numbers came\n\nSpontaneously, and cloth’d in priestly robe\n\nMy spirit, thus singled out, as it might seem,\n\nFor holy services...\n\nThe same collocation of bread and stone occurs in the climactic lyric of ‘The Man with the Blue Guitar’ (XXXIII 6-12):\n\nHere is the bread of time to come,\n\nHere is its actual stone. The bread\n\nWill be our bread, the stone will be\n\nOur bed and we shall sleep by night.\n\nWe shall forget by day, except\n\nThe moments when we choose to play\n\nThe imagined pine, the imagined jay.\n\nBloom makes reference throughout his study to the ‘apocalyptic quality’ of Stevens’s poetry (Wallace Stevens: The Poems of Our Climate, Cornell University Press, 1977, p286), interpreting ‘Saint John and the Backache’ as a watershed (p298):\n\nSaint John is the Transcendental element in Stevens himself, the apocalyptic impulse that he has dismissed for so long but that will begin to break in upon his reveries in An Ordinary Evening in New Haven and The Rock and then will dominate the poems composed from 1952 through 1955.\n\nHowever, he makes no mention of Revelation in the context of ‘The Man with the Blue Guitar’ (p135):\n\nIntrojecting the bread of time to come, the poet surrenders the present with the sombre knowledge of an absence in reality: ‘Here is its actual stone’, which is also the necessity of forgetting by day, except in the making of poetry. But this is no longer the playing of the guitar that opened the poem. No shearsman, no patcher can will those negative moments which give us the green of the imagined pine, the blue of the imagined jay. ‘Imagined’ here has a transumptive freshness. We are very near to the ‘ever-early candour’ of Notes and to the celebration of that candor as ‘an elixir, an excitation, a pure power’.\n\nSo ‘the bread of time to come’ and ‘the actual stone’ do not partake of the ‘transumptive freshness’ of ‘pure power’. In delimiting them as antithetical tropes to the pine and blue-jay, Bloom might have cited Steven’s explicit option for the ‘the lion in the lute/ Before the lion locked in stone’; and the ‘wrangling of two dreams’, which recalls his beautiful rhetorical question, clear in its preference for the waking dream: ‘Of the two dreams, who would prefer/ The one obscured by sleep?’ Bloom’s elliptical sentence appears either to introject ‘bread’ out of the equation or to equate bread and stone as images of ‘absence’, of benighted ‘day’ and ‘actual... night’, as opposed to their ‘imagined’ antitheses. Similarly, in response to Satan’s first temptation, ‘If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread’ (Matthew 4:3), Christ declines to differentiate, introducing instead a contrast between material image and spiritual ‘word’: ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God’.\n\nDespite these connotations, however, I think Bloom is mistaken. The ‘actual stone’ of ‘The Man with a Blue Guitar’ is itself a token of poetic individuation. Stevens’s proleptic invocation of ‘the bread’ as ‘our bread’ and its attribution to ‘day’, implicit in the attribution of the ‘stone’ to ‘night’, identify it with ‘our [daily] bread’ (The Lord’s Prayer) and thus with ‘the hidden manna’. The ‘bread of time to come’ contains a further allusion to Revelation: ‘Him which is and was and which is to come’ (Revelation 1:4). ‘Here is its actual stone’ is, therefore, anything but an intimation of ‘an absence in reality’, rather an insistence on its palpable presence or actualised potential, a prophetic affirmation that ‘the time is at hand’ (R1:3): ‘This is major Stevens, prophesying the opening section of Notes’ (The Poems of Our Climate, p134). The ‘actual stone’ of ‘time to come’ is identical to the ‘white stone’, token of the ‘pure power’ and ‘ever-early candour’, not of the ‘white-robed’ candidate (L candidus, white; candidatus, candidate, OED) or ephebe, but of ‘him that overcometh’, the ‘strong poet’ of whom Stevens is Bloom’s principal exemplar (‘The Owl in the Sarcophagus’ III 13-16):\n\nSleep realised\n\nWas the whiteness that is the ultimate intellect,\n\nA diamond jubilance beyond the fire,\n\nThat gives its power to the wild-ringed eye.\n\n‘Sleep realised’ is a beautiful image of the dream which is not ‘Obscured by sleep’; and, in Prynne’s poetry, the many allotropes of ‘the white stone’ include crystals, sapphires, pearls and diamonds. In St John the Divine’s transumption of Satan’s imagery, ‘bread’ and ‘stones’ become tropes of the ‘word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God’, ‘the bread of time to come’, ‘its actual stone’.\n\nBloom gives the name apophrades to the uncanny but demonstrable phenomenon by which a poet appears to ghostwrite his precursor’s poetry, so that the earlier poet seems to have fallen under the influence of the later (pp15-16). In relation to St John the Baptist, Christ demonstrates a ratio that goes beyond even apophrades: ‘the absolute absorption of the precursor’, of which, in his absorption of Marlowe, ‘Shakespeare is the largest instance in the language’ (p11). The Baptist appears not only free of ‘the anxiety of influencing’ (p6), or being absorbed by, a greater than himself, but enraptured by the prospect: ‘this my joy is therefore fulfilled’ (John 3:29). Yet his insight into the process is expressed in Bloomian terms: ‘He must increase, but I must decrease’ (J3:30); and his extraordinary metaphor of ‘the friend of the bridegroom’ who ‘rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice’ (J3:29) is a sublimation of intense rivalry (as postulated by several scholars). In Psalms, to which St John the Baptist alludes, the trope of the ‘bridgegroom’ occurs in a series of parallelisms, balanced by an explicitly competitive image (19:2–6):\n\nThe heavens declare the glory of God ... In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun, Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.\n\nIn Jacket No. 20, following Veronica Forrest-Thomson, I read ‘Of Sanguine Fire’ (Brass, 1971; Poems, pp175-179) in terms of the mysterious entities who appear in an italicised but unattributed quotation, itself derived from Psalm 19:\n\n... always Fresh,\n\nVigorous and Bright, like the life and\n\nquickness of the Morning, and rejoyce like\n\nthe Sun to run their Course —\n\nIf Christ has fulfilled these ancient tropes of the sun, he has won the race as well as the bride, and St John has lost both. ‘Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?’ (1 Corinthians 9:24). It is, then, hard to read the phrase ‘he that hath the bride’ (J3:29) with a sense of unmitigated ‘joy’. As an expression of generous jealousy, however, it is both beautiful and psychologically acute; as true to Bloom’s ‘family romance’ (p8) as any of his own ‘darker truths’ (p6).\n\nI intend to challenge Bloom’s ‘Viconian insistence that priority in divination is crucial for every strong poet, lest he dwindle merely into a latecomer’ (p8). The ‘anxiety of influence’ needs to be balanced by a sense of the elation of influence, implicit in the traditional trope of apprenticeship to a revered master which is repudiated by Bloom as, at best, an idealisation. It is W.S. Graham, described by Julian McLaren-Ross as ‘quite the most competitive poet I ever met’ (Memoirs of the Forties, London Magazine, 1965; Penguin, 1984, p184), who has, in ‘Johann Joachim Quantz’s Five Lessons’ (Collected Poems 1942-77, Faber, 1979, pp222-226), reimagined the idealistic relationship for the modernist poet (‘The Fourth Lesson’, p224):\n\nI know you find great joy in the great\n\nComposers. But now you can put your lips to\n\nThe messages and blow them into sound\n\nAnd enter and be there as well. You must\n\nBe faithful to who you are speaking from\n\nAnd yet it is alright. You will be there.\n\nThe analogy between the tuition of the eighteenth-century flautist and the relationship between poets is made explicit at the outset (‘The First Lesson’, p222):\n\nIt is best I sit\n\nHere where I am to speak on the other side\n\nOf language. You, of course, in your own time\n\nAnd incident (I speak in the small hours.)\n\nWill listen from your side.\n\nThe ambiguous phrases ‘on the other side’ and ‘in your own time’ imply the atemporality and uncanniness of poetic influence, yet Graham’s most revered contemporary was also a close friend and drinking companion. In The Nightfisherman: Selected Letters of W.S. Graham (Carcanet, 1999, p9), Michael and Margaret Snow make the point that Graham ‘always freely acknowledged the influence’ of Dylan Thomas; and in an interview with John Haffenden, dating from 1979, he goes even farther: ‘I’m not claiming the same magnitude. I’d met my match’ (‘I Would Say I Was a Happy Man’, Poetry Review Vol. 76 No. 1/2, 1986, p70). According to Sven Berlin, Graham exulted in Thomas’s poetry. Two consecutive letters to John Minton, about ‘Listen. Put on Morning’ (Collected Poems, pp48-49), convey the quality of Graham’s elation (24/4/45 and ‘30/4/45?’, The Nightfisherman, pp37-41):\n\nI’ve just finished the loveliest poem to me I’ve made. It begins like this [transcribes all 45 lines!]... Well there you are I seem to have typed it all...\n\nIt curiously repeats through my head like someone else’s good poem, especially from ‘Yes listen. It carries away’. For me it’s more memorable than any poem I’ve written. Also maybe a bit like W.B. too. And a bit like Graham Minton Robert Robert Ness Father Mother Willie Davie Billbrewer Pjean Dylant [sic] and Loneheron. Love S.\n\nIn the words of the following poem, Graham presents a ‘constellation/ Of united hearts... Crowded in a gesture/ Of homesickness’ (‘The Hill of Intrusion’, p50). In context, ‘W.B.’ is clearly Blake, but both the initials and ‘Willie’ suggest Yeats, whose symbolic herons rival his swans; whilst ‘Loneheron’ recalls The Idylls of the King, in which ‘the lone hern forgets his melancholy,/ Lets down his other leg, and stretching dreams/ Of goodly supper in the distant pool’ (‘Gareth and Lynette’; Tennyson, like Yeats, uses the obsolete word ‘hern[e]’) and The Lady of the Lake (‘She hovers o’er the hollow way,/ And flutters wide her mantle gray,/ As the lone heron spreads his wing,/ By twilight, o’er a haunted spring’). For ‘Dylant’, who was so devoted to herons that they still came looking for him after his death, it is invariably a ‘Loneheron’ on the ‘heron/ Priested shore’ (‘Poem in October’, Collected Poems 1934-1952, p102). Yet the hieratic trope has another dimension. Margaret Snow suggests, convincingly, that it might be an image of the poet himself, bringing the folk-musical round of family and fellow-artists full circle (letter to J.K.; it is doubtful whether Graham would have known either Patrick Heron or Peter Lanyon at this date). ‘Bill Brewer’ of ‘Widecombe Fair’ is another analogue of ‘Graham’; and as ‘Willie’, a name by which he was known to friends, he is in the middle, too. Other references are to ‘the two Roberts’, Colquhoun and MacBryde, Peggy Jean Epstein, Nessie Dunsmuir and two of her brothers, Willie and Davie, who appear, alongside their ‘sister Mary’, in ‘Listen. Put on Morning’:\n\nAnd hear the playropes caa\n\nThe sister Mary in.\n\nAnd hear Willie and Davie\n\nAmong bracken of Narnain\n\nSing in a mist heavy\n\nWith myrtle and listeners...\n\nThe centuries turn their locks\n\nAnd open under the hill\n\nTheir inherited books and doors\n\nAll gathered to distil\n\nLike happy berry pickers\n\nOne voice to talk to us.\n\nThe poet’s unique ‘voice’ is a distillation of those of his ‘listeners’, who include his friends and family (‘my father and mother’ appear in the previous poem, ‘Since All My Steps Taken’, p47), as well as those whose voices he has ‘inherited’ from ‘books’. Of all his contemporaries, Graham is one of the least afflicted by Oedipal anxiety, itself allegedly the hallmark of the ‘strong’ poet. Insistent on the need for originality, he is also exemplary in his ecstatic response, his loyalty and his generosity to his precursors. His informal composite self-image as, simultaneously, an artist known by his surname, a son and companion known by his Christian name, a correspondent known by a single initial, an heir to the folk tradition and an isolated, predatory bird, in the midst of an extended family of influences, makes a beautiful and significant rejoinder to Bloom (p30):\n\nWhere generosity is involved, the poets influenced are minor or weaker; the more generosity, and the more mutual it is, the poorer the poets involved.\n\nDivested of its patrilineal connotations, the elation of influence has been given classic expression by Gerry and the Pacemakers (‘How Do You Do It?’, M. Murray, Columbia, 1963; cited by Denise Riley, ‘Introduction’ to Poets on Writing: Britain, 1970-91, Macmillan, 1992, p4):\n\nHow do you do what you do to me?\n\nI wish I knew.\n\nIf I knew how you did it to me,\n\nI would do it to you!\n\nGraham’s delight in having produced something which sounds ‘like someone else’s good poem’ — Yesss! I can do it! I can do what they do to me! — is unchronicled in Bloom’s genealogies. Whilst the joyful infatuation of the lover remains one-sided, it cannot be ‘fulfilled’, yet elation is not conditional on fulfilment. Like the sun, the ephebe ‘rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race’. There may be rivalry even in mutual love, as between citizens and within families, but Bloom’s de-idealisation denies reciprocity: ‘Poets as poets... fight to the end to have their initial chance alone’ (p8). For Bloom, ‘healthy rivalry’ is an oxymoron.\n\nI shall argue, on the contrary, that ‘the young citizen of poetry’ is engaged in a communal as well as an intrinsically competitive pursuit: ‘Watch, then, the band of rivals as they climb up and down/ Their steep stone gennels in twos and threes, sometimes/ Arm in arm, but never, thank God, in step’ (W.H. Auden, ‘In Praise of Limestone’, Collected Shorter Poems 1927-1957, Faber, 1966, p239). Auden contrasts the voice of ‘a stone that responds’ (p239), the white stone of ‘a limestone landscape’ (p241), with ‘an older colder voice, the oceanic whisper:/ “I am the solitude that asks and promises nothing;/ That is how I shall set you free. There is no love;/ There are only the various envies, all of them sad”‘ (p240). Limestone is clearly the hero in white, Ocean the stage-villain of the piece. In my reading, despite a solipsistic streak, Prynne refuses freedom on its terms. Perhaps every poet, like the ‘jealous God’ (Exodus 20:5), is ‘jealous for my holy name’ (Ezekiel 39:25). But Ocean got it wrong: amongst ‘the various envies’, the disinterested jealousy of creativity is a kind of love.\n\nCompare Graham’s exultation in Thomas’s poetry with Prynne’s ‘profound admiring satisfaction’ in a painting by de Kooning (‘A Discourse on Willem de Kooning’s Rosy-fingered Dawn at Louse Point’, Act 2: Beautiful Translations, Pluto Press, 1996, p38):\n\nThis intense lyricism... may well promote in the viewer a profound admiring satisfaction – and perhaps also a sense, in certain busy minds, of anguish: that is to say, are we going to be allowed to enjoy an intensely lyricised satisfaction in this manner, at this already late stage in the history of paint, without being made to pay for it in some hidden way that is actually extremely costly?\n\nPrynne’s explicit invocation of the anxiety of the ‘latecomer’ (Anxiety of Influence, p8) is balanced by the sense of ‘a fulfilled connection’ with the artistic precursor, expressed in startlingly textual terms:\n\nAnd yet this glowing image, even despite such potential anxiety in the viewer, offers to us at first glance a clear authority, intensely pleasurable and strong with the presence of its own controlled pleasure; the authority is so extremely different from much other of de Kooning’s work, even at this period, because of the extraordinarily powerful lacuna in the central part of the picture; that vacancy is composed and partly overwritten by the cadastral framing and shaping which surrounds it, so stationed in order to allow the contemplative mind to write itself into a plenitude and to feel some connection, perhaps a fulfilled connection, there.\n\nAccording to Bloom, ‘strong poets make [poetic] history by misreading one another, so as to clear imaginative space for themselves’ (p5). Prynne experiences the ‘imaginative space’ at the heart of the ‘strong’ precursor’s own work as an ‘extraordinarily powerful lacuna’, even, potentially, as repressive (‘authority’) and ruinous (‘cadastral’), yet its paradoxical taxation is such as ‘to allow the contemplative mind to write itself into a plenitude’. Far from being a ‘solitude that asks and promises nothing’, such self-fulfilment is at the same time a ‘fulfilled connection’ with the precursor (‘this my joy is therefore fulfilled’, J3:29), a ‘plenitude’ which the later poet can ‘enter and be there as well’.\n\nIn Revelation, the word ‘overcometh’ is intransitive, suggesting a standard to be reached or a threshold to be crossed; a struggle with rather than against the ‘Spirit’ of the precursor. The ‘white stone’ is offered to each individual, not exclusively to one; and ‘He’ is the same kind of singular-plural as ‘ear’ (cf. R1:3: ‘they that hear)’. The anticipated victory is a collective and indeed a noble one, as in the famous anthem, ‘We shall overcome’ (C. Albert Tindley, 1901). It is perhaps never going to be the case that ‘All have won; therefore all shall have prizes’ (Alice Through the Looking-Glass, Lewis Carroll), nor is it necessarily true, however, that only ‘one receiveth the prize’. Bloom rejects ‘the qualified Freudian optimism of sublimation’ (p8), defined as ‘the yielding up of more primordial for more refined modes of pleasure’ (p9), as perhaps in St John the Baptist’s self-abnegation. In any case, what is at stake in poetry, for both Prynne and Auden as much as for most poets in the canon, goes beyond the pleasure-principle: ‘if/ Sins can be forgiven, if bodies rise from the dead,/ These modifications of matter into/ Innocent athletes and gesticulating fountains,/ Made solely for pleasure, make a further point’ (p241). Auden’s ‘further point’, to which I shall return, concerns both ‘love’ and ‘the life to come’ (p241).\n\nIn a later section of this study, I shall consider both ‘the qualified Freudian optimism’, in its original psychological and philosophical contexts, and Jung’s conception of psychic individuation, to which Bloom’s is indebted. I shall argue that the concept of immortality is integral to both psychological projects.\n\n2: ‘The Harsh Light of Unintelligibility’\n\nSt John the Divine speaks to anyone who will listen. Yet even those with ears to hear may remain perplexed. A candid response to Revelation by an Edwardian exegete strikes me as equally applicable to Prynne (C. Anderson Scott, ‘Editor’s Introduction’, Revelation, The New Century Bible, OUP, nd: c 1902, p5):\n\nthere are... elements which give rise to perplexity in varying degrees, amounting in some cases to despair of comprehending them or harmonising them with the rest of the book... These things appear to impose upon the reader the alternative of either forcing upon them an interpretation of his own, or laying them aside as incomprehensible.\n\nNo reader of Prynne is likely to offer a confident interpretation of his writing as a whole, or even (with exceptions) of any given sequence or poem. Take ‘The Kirghiz Disasters’ (Brass; Poems, pp155-158), an Apocalyptic sonnet sequence typified by the entertaining couplet in which ‘the captain orders the sight/ of land to be erased from the log, as well he might’ — a rhyming allegory of wilful if not perverse recalcitrance. Yet the ‘credal echoes’ in this ‘reckless theophany’ of a poem run into double figures (‘Easter’, ‘grace’, ‘the three persons’, ‘Hell’, ‘zealots’, ‘Jerome’, ‘heavenly’, ‘redeemed’...). The point of departure for a consideration of Prynne’s poetry is a series of interpretations by a number of critics that are cumulatively — at times brilliantly — illuminating. Many of these are by Neil Reeve and Richard Kerridge (R&K), whose own ‘pragmatism’ I particularly admire (Nearly Too Much: The Poetry of J.H. Prynne, Liverpool University Press, 1995, p4). Others are by David Trotter, Steve Clark, Andrew Duncan and contributors to a number of little magazines (Grosseteste Review; fragmente; Parataxis; The Gig). R&K adopt the hypothesis that ‘Prynne’s poetry is so difficult because it is committed to a notion of the public sphere which is extraordinarily rigorous — and potentially democratic’ (p2). I intend to explore a different and in many respects an intensely private ‘sphere’, but also to conduct negotations with the ‘middle ground’ (p13 and passim) delineated by their readings.\n\nThe White Stones opens with ‘Airport Poem: Ethics of Survival’ (Poems, pp38-39), which may serve as a paradigm. The title itself is a twofold gesture towards ‘the public sphere’: that of modern transport technology and that of contemporary philosophy. The word ‘social’ occurs three times in a series of deadpan, ostensibly informative predicates (‘The century roar is...’; ‘The music... is...’; ‘The desert/ is...’; ‘The heart is...’; ‘water/ is...’; ‘the cistern... is...’; ‘news is...’; ‘love is...’). The poem is perhaps intended to be taken with a pinch of salt, but there is no mistaking its air of radical chic:\n\nThe desert\n\nis a social and undedicated expanse, since\n\nwhat else there is counts as merest propaganda.\n\nInsofar as the medium is the message, the message is that this is a poet who knows his way around ‘the public sphere’ of our complex political and intellectual world. ‘[I]ntelligence’ is itself thematic; and, as is often the case in Prynne’s writing, several phrases bear, or have come to bear, technical meanings in various disciplines, including those relating to the differences between human ‘intelligence’ and that of animals and machines. I have again made unscrupulous use of Google, a search-engine which is heavily weighted towards recent texts, many of which appear simultaneously (or exclusively) on the net as a matter of course. There is no intention, in citing texts which postdate a given poem, to impute occult powers to its author (necessarily!), but rather to demonstrate the range and contemporaneity of Prynne’s writing; and to illustrate the usage of such phrases as also bear a technical sense in 2004.\n\nFor example, the concept of ‘social fluency’ (p38) has been deployed by the sociologist Stephen J. Lilley in analysis of a debate between ‘computer ethicists’ (‘The “Human-Machine” Schism in STS with Implications for Software Accountability, Control and Design’, internet):\n\nCollins advances a meta-view of humans and intelligent machines in which the latter are deemed important constituents in the social body, but, lacking social fluency, are not conversant participants, let alone active promoters of this body... Although the work of Collins et al is innovative, there is a certain amount of familiarity in its humanism... Actor-network theory, whether by its symmetrical treatment of humans and machines or its emphasis on process and complex hybrids, represents a radical departure from humanism. In evaluating these diverse approaches, computer ethicists also will have to evaluate the importance of humanism to their own work.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase ‘social intelligence’ (p38) is a standard term in discussion of the intelligence of primates and other animals, but has also been deployed by ‘computer ethicists’ (‘Social Intelligence as Norm Adaptation’, Magnus Boman and Harko Verhagen, Socially Situated Intelligence, edited by B. Edmonds and K. Dautenhahn, University of Zurich, 1998, pp17-24):\n\nMachine learning is the core of artificial intelligence... Successful inductive rules for agent behaviour are typically based on machine guesses, the quality of which are measured in terms of precise real numbers representing utility... We propose that intelligent agent action be studied with respect to a social space... The learning of new norms, and the strife of each agent to act in keeping with the norms of the coalitions of which it is a member constitutes social intelligence.\n\nThese terms place ‘Airport Poem’ securely in the ‘public sphere’. However, the dialectic between ‘public’ and private spheres is clearly enacted in the transition from the public concourse of a civil ‘Airport’ to the psychogeography of ‘the heart’. It is true that the word ‘social’ occurs three times; but the word ‘heart’ occurs four times, and in the conclusion the word ‘flight’ (which in any case carries more metaphorical freight than almost any other single analogy with human experience, including intimations of immortality), discards most of its connotations of contemporaneity and high-technology, moving ‘back, into/ the remotest/ past’:\n\nWhich makes the thinning sorrow of flight\n\nthe last disjunction of the heart: that\n\nnews is the person, and love\n\nthe shape of his compulsion\n\nin the musical phrase,\n\nnearly but not\n\nyet back, into\n\nthe remotest\n\npast.\n\nOf which the heart is capable and will journey\n\nover any desert and through the air, making\n\nthe turn and stop undreamed of:\n\nlove is, always, the\n\nflight back\n\nto where\n\nwe are.\n\nThe ‘flight’ of ‘the heart’ becomes that of an angel; and the reader has already encountered ‘the elect angels’ (1 Timothy 5:21) in ‘The Numbers’, which opens both Prynne’s collected volumes (Kitchen Poems; Poems, Allardyce Barnett, 1982; Poems, 1999, pp10-12). The simultaneous ‘journey’ across the ‘desert’ becomes that of a pilgrim (whose ‘celestial/ progress, across the sky’ begins in ‘Sketch for a Financial Theory of the Self’, Kitchen Poems; Poems pp19-20). The word ‘news’ carries connotations of the gospel, and the ‘person’ of Christ, the incarnation of ‘love’. The repetition of the word ‘back’ identifies ‘the remotest past’ with ‘where we are’, and the ‘stop undreamed of’ with the Apocalyptic present of ‘love’ (rather than with an unscheduled ‘stop’ at an international airport).\n\nIn this context, some of the earlier tropes acquire other connotations. The ‘music’ sounds less like a cinematic soundtrack or the muzak of a ‘departure’ lounge than the ‘music heard so deeply’ [‘far down/ in the mind’] ‘that it is not heard at all, but you are the music/ While the music lasts’ [‘prolonged into the latent action of the heart’] (‘Burnt Norton’ I). ‘[L]ove [is]/ the shape of his compulsion/ in the musical phrase’ might almost be an out-take from Four Quartets: cf. ‘Only by the form, the pattern,/ Can words or music reach/ The stillness... Love is itself unmoving,/ Only the cause and end of movement’ (‘Burnt Norton’ V); ‘Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning... With the drawing of this Love and the voice of this calling’ (‘Little Gidding’ V). Similarly, the ‘century roar’ might be interpreted as a totalising trope of holocaust and conflagration; the ‘desert’ as the desolation to which civilization has been reduced in the postwar peace, or a post-apocalyptic landscape consequent on the global failure of ‘Ethics of Survival’ (a short sentence in ‘The Numbers’, ‘They call it peace/ or history’, alludes to the saying, attributed by Tacitus to Caratacus, that Roman armies ‘create a desert and call it peace’, p12) . The title phrase is suggestive of ecological and anti-nuclear argument, as in ‘Ecology and environment (ethics of survival)’, the title of a contribution to a recent book on Biodiversity: Strategies for Conservation (R.R. Das, ‘Dr S.K. Agarwal Commemoration Volume’, edited by L.K. Dadhich and A.P. Sharma, New Delhi, APH, 2002).\n\nHowever, as so often with Prynne’s poetry, the primary reference is theological and Revelation is a tangible presence. The phrase originates in a sermon by the American theologian, Helmut Richard Niebuhr (1894-1962), younger brother of Reinhold and ‘known for his contributions to Christian ethics... and essays advancing “theocentric” theology’ (H. Richard Niebuhr Papers, Andover-Harvard Library, Harvard Divinity School). ‘Ethics of Survival’ (4/3/62) is one of a series of sermons with titles such as ‘Shape of Things to Come’ (5/6/43), ‘Consoling Thought of Divine Judgment’ (14/3/54) and ‘Hope of Glory’ (2/2/57). As Frank Knox Fellow at Harvard during 1962, Prynne might even have attended it. The context of the word ‘survival’ in Niebuhr’s thought is established by the title of another sermon: ‘The Wisdom of Survival and the Logic of the Cross’ (nd). His books include The Kingdom of God in America (1937) and The Meaning of Revelation (1941), published in the same year as the principal Apocalyptic anthology, The White Horseman. The first poem of The White Stones, then, is explicitly preoccupied with ‘survival... beyond demise’ (Unanswering Rational Shore, Object Permanence, 2001), or immortality.\n\nOne might interpret ‘the/ flight back/ to where/ we are’ as a potentially recuperative image of the middle ground between public and private spheres. Bloom’s system is opposed to any conception of the ‘middle ground’, yet at two crucial points he anticipates a recuperation by which such a position might be established. In consideration of Keats and Tennyson, he acknowledges the possibility of a ‘relative victory or at least holding of his own’ on the part of the strong poet (p12); and in questioning whether ‘Romantic vision’ might have arisen out of ‘an intensity of repression previously unmatched in the history of the imagination’, he entertains the hypothesis that it might ultimately constitute ‘an unconscious lie against the difficult human effort of holding the middle ground between instinctual existence and all morality’ (p112). I intend to argue that the unbroken romantic/ modernist tradition, which Prynne extends into the present day, has its own disturbing features, of which this ‘unconscious lie’, and the conception(s) of immortality which it subserves, are amongst the most salient.\n\nIn Charles Olson: The Scholar’s Art (Harvard University Press, 1978), Robert von Hallberg endorses the aim to interpret Prynne’s poetry by choosing an epigraph from ‘Die a Millionaire’ (lines 1-11) to illustrate his main contention (p205):\n\nOlson appears to have been most influential in legitimating poetry, once again, as a medium of communication that can make itself compelling by following closely the turns of thought in an argument of explicitly rhetorical intent.\n\nVon Hallberg draws a startling distinction between, on the one hand, most of ‘the poets associated with Black Mountain College’ whom ‘Olson is often thought to have influenced’ and, on the other, ‘three poets — LeRoi Jones, Edward Dorn, and J.H. Prynne — who seem to have learned much from Olson about poetry as a medium of rhetorical communication’; accordingly, he numbers Prynne amongst ‘poets like Olson whose work is devoted more to thought and communication than to perception and expression’ (p209). I intend to reexamine this relationship, but am happy to side with von Hallberg against Don Paterson (‘Baffled by modern verse? Read on...’, Observer Review, 28/7/01, p16):\n\nOkay, first the turkeys... J.H. Prynne, for whom the accidental formulation of a simple expository sentence that could be understood by a reader of average intelligence would, I assume, cause him to hang himself from shame, is the principle [sic] culprit.\n\nR&K acknowledge that ‘This is writing at its most intransigent’, often apparently ‘stranded’ in ‘self-isolating elitism’ (p2); and devote their first chapter to ‘the difficulties set for reading by seemingly alienating devices’ (pviii). However, they repudiate the position, inspired by Theodor Adorno and adopted by a number of contemporary critics, ‘which sees virtual unreadability as the only way of resisting commodification’ (p1) and ‘read on, beyond the sense of impasse’ (p2). I would generalise this response into the principle that there is simply no such thing as an unrecuperable text — least of all the programmatically unreadable.\n\nAdorno’s response to ‘FA: M’AHNIESGOW’ [sic] is a revealing example of his approach to ‘qualitatively modern works’ (‘Presuppositions’, Notes to Literature: Volume 2, edited by Rolf Tiedermann, translated by Shierry Weber Nicholsen, Columbia University Press, 1992, p95). Written by Hans G. Helms, a German Jewish poet born in 1932, fa: m’ahniesgwow was issued as a ten-inch record (Dumont, Cologne, 1959). It is, I gather, ‘mainly sound poetry but with passages in Beat-style English’ (Dick Higgins):\n\nEssential to such a text is the shock with which it forcibly interrupts communication. The harsh light of unintelligibility that such a work turns toward the reader renders the usual intelligibility suspect as being shallow, habitual, reified — in short, pre-artistic.\n\nExposed to negative dialectics, ‘even the most authentic works take on in retrospect a pre-artistic, somewhat informational quality’ (p99). Hegel’s insistence that ‘the work’s effects on the contemplative recipient are contingent’ has ‘destroyed subjectivist views that still stood firm for Hegel and that govern his method naively, such as the view that the aesthetic object is intelligible in principle’ (p96). Adept at citing the naïve but recuperable Hegel against Heidegger, Heidegger against himself and Hölderlin against both, Adorno is an intriguing and highly quotable writer. He is, at the same time, a caricaturist, in particular of the ‘view’ attributed to Hegel (p96):\n\nI do not want to try to make Helms intelligible... but merely to discuss some presuppositions./ / I am aware that by doing so I expose Helms’ work and my own stance on it to the triumphant scorn of all the right-thinking people who are already approaching, armed with the intention of waxing indignant about how this asks too much even of progressive and open-minded people. I can imagine what satisfaction some will find in inferring from my words that I have not understood it either.\n\nMy intention is not ‘to try to make [Prynne] intelligible’, but to interpret some of his most beautiful (and some of his most dismaying) poetry. Far from ‘waxing indignant’, or objecting that it ‘asks [nearly] too much’, I find, on the contrary, that its ‘intelligibility’ is of the ‘usual’ poetic kind, both in communicating before it is understood and in opening up for the ‘open-minded’ reader. It is not my perception that Prynne exposes the poetry of his precursors as ‘pre-artistic’, ‘shallow, habitual’ or ‘reified’ — Blake? Wordsworth? Hölderlin? Eliot? Thomas? Celan? — but that, in the achievement of individuation, he extends the tradition into the present of his own writing, as the poets of each generation continue to do. His poetry is no more the acme of dialectical evolution than it is the culmination of the ‘decline’ perceived by Bloom (p10):\n\nThe great poets of the English Renaissance are not matched by their Enlightened descendants, and the whole tradition of the post-Enlightenment, which is Romanticism, shows a further decline in its Modernist and post-Modernist heirs.\n\nIts weakest link — that Romanticism ‘shows a... decline’ from the Enlightenment — is neatly elided, but no refinement of the graph will save this argument. ‘[A]rt never improves’ (‘Tradition and the Individual Talent’, The Sacred Wood, 1920; Methuen, 1960, p51). Nor hath it declined. Twentieth-century poetry in English holds its own in comparison with that of any previous epoch, not excluding the Renaissance; and Prynne holds his own amongst the major postwar British modernists. His poetry — in Hopkins’s phrase, ‘beautiful to individuation’ (‘Introduction’, Gerard Manley Hopkins: Poetry and Prose, edited by W.H. Gardner, Penguin, 1953, pxv) — belongs with that of Graham, Philip Larkin, Burns Singer and Roy Fisher. At best, its ‘light’ — often but by no means always ‘harsh’ — outshines any conceivable product of programmatic ‘unintelligibility’.\n\nNevertheless, Adorno’s portrait of Helms is ironically recognisable — as Prynne:\n\nHelms aims at nothing less than breaking out of the monologue interieur... The eccentric features in Helms’s experiments, the ones in which, as always in art, one can see the differentia specifica of his approach, are a result of that. He is something like a parody of a seventeenth-century poeta doctus, the poetic antithesis of the imago of the poet as one who hearkens to the source — an image that has since degenerated into fraud. He expects knowledge of the linguistic components and elements of reality he employs and encodes. Such works have always been explicated through commentary, and this one too is designed for commentary, like the German Baroque dramas to which the learned Silesians appended their scholia.\n\nSuddenly the individuating ‘differentia’, Aristotelian equivalent of Bloom’s clinamen (p14), becomes intelligible and acquires a purpose; the poet ‘encodes’ so that his work may be ‘explicated’ by ‘commentary’. Prynne might indeed, without that hint of a sneer, be described as ‘something like... a seventeenth century poeta doctus’ — less of ‘a parody’ because anything but the ‘antithesis’ of ‘one who hearkens to the source’ (‘He that hath an ear...’). Despite Adorno’s dubious binary, it is clear that Prynne is equally absorbed in ‘the source’ — in several senses of the supposedly degenerate ‘image’ — as in contemporary arts and technologies. Nevertheless, his own most explicit statement about his poetry endorses Adorno’s point about ‘the linguistic components and elements of reality he employs and encodes’ (letter to Peter Riley, 15/9/85, cited, as epigraph, in Riley’s Reader, privately published, 1992; and in ‘Prefatory Note’, J.H. Prynne: A Bibliography, Nate Dorward, 1/8/01):\n\nIt has mostly been my own aspiration, for example, to establish relations not personally with the reader, but with the world and its layers of shifted but recognisable usage; and thereby with the reader’s own position within this world.\n\nHow, then, can the same work ‘establish relations... with the world’ and be ‘designed for commentary’, yet also be programmatic in its ‘unintelligibility’? It is chiefly in its curious idealism that Adorno’s ‘psychoanalytic’ theory differs from Bloom’s (p106):\n\nIn psychoanalytic terms, expression and construction would belong together in the emancipated work of art like the ego and the unconscious. Where id is, there ego shall be, says modern art along with Freud. But the ego cannot be healed of its cardinal sin, the blind, self-devouring domination of nature that recapitulates the state of nature forever, by subjecting internal nature, the id, to itself as well. The ego can only be healed by becoming reconciled with the unconscious, knowingly and freely following where it leads. Just as the true human being would not be the one who suppressed his drives but rather the one who looked them in the eye and fulfilled them without doing them violence and without subjecting himself to their power, so today the true work of art would have to adopt a stance on freedom and necessity that can serve as a model... Helms’ intention is not far from this... something like a Joyce come into his own, self-conscious, consistent, and fully organised... Helms would be the last to claim that he had surpassed Joyce or, as the popular but revolting word has it, ‘overcome’ him... matters do not proceed in so antagonistic a fashion.\n\nWhere the precursor is, there I shall (also) be, says the true poet, internalising the precursor’s style and fulfilling it in overcoming his own subjection to its power. The ‘popular but revolting word’ may legitimately be applied to the process, not because it is necessarily or intrinsically ‘antagonistic’, but because the achievement of individuation involves progression beyond the precursor. What is ‘overcome’ is not the precursor or his poetry, but their ‘power’ over the ephebe. Helms is not ‘a Joyce come into his own’; it is Helms who has ‘come into his own’ in his struggle with Joyce. St John the Baptist’s formula might be reformulated as follows: ‘My power over him must decrease as his own power increases’. It is, again, a family romance, as compatible with the opposite of antagonism — with love — as the relationships within a family.\n\nAdorno and Bloom are amusingly coupled in a discussion of Fredric Jameson’s Late Marxism: Adorno, or, The Persistence of the Dialectic (Verso, 1990) by Steven Helmling (The Success and Failure of Fredric Jameson: Writing, the Sublime, and the Dialectic of Critique, SUNY, 2001, p35):\n\nAdorno’s own rhetoric of the non plus is so powerfully terminal, even apocalyptic — or perhaps rather ‘gnostic’ in the sense of Harold Bloom’s deft aphorism that gnosticism ensues upon failed apocalyptic as apocalyptic ensues upon failed prophecy.\n\nAdorno, however, dismisses ‘genetic method’ by relegating ‘so-called influences’ to the merely circumstantial ‘conditions under which literary works were created’ (‘Parataxis: On Hölderlin’s Late Poetry’, Notes to Literature: Volume 2, p112), but his idealising tropes — ‘the true human being’; ‘the true work of art’ — beg most of the important questions (compare ‘our true place’ and ‘our true fate’, ‘Of Sanguine Fire’, p177). If the ego is characterised by ‘blind, self-devouring domination’, how is it to be reconciled with the ‘drives’ — also, by definition, blind — of ‘the unconscious’? How, for pity’s sake, is it to look them in the eye? And what the blazes has ‘cardinal sin’ got to do with it at all?\n\nThe last question is the easiest. Here is Adorno’s account of ‘hermetic’ art (p108):\n\nBy breaking off communication, by being closed in its own way, the hermetic work of art puts an end to the closed quality that earlier works bestowed on their subject matter without having it fully themselves. The hermetic work, however, forms within itself the discontinuity that is the discontinuity between the world and the work. The broken medium that does not fuse expression and meaning, does not integrate the one with the other by sacrificing it but instead derives them both to unreconciled difference, becomes the bearer of the substance of what is broken and distant from meaning. The rupture, which the work does not bridge, but rather, lovingly and hopefully, makes the agent of its form, remains the figure of a substance that transcends it. It expresses meaning through its ascetic stance toward meaning.\n\nThis transcendent ‘figure’ is less a trope or even a ‘stance’ than an incarnation of the Logos, ‘lovingly and hopefully’ reconciling ‘substance’ and ‘meaning’ — implicitly, flesh and spirit — ‘not ... by sacrificing it’ but by sacrificing itself, ‘the bearer of the substance of what is broken’, the Word which took on flesh. The concept of transcendence is smuggled into an allegory of redemption. Detranscendentalised, the argument reduces to ‘the fallacy of imitative form’ (Yvor Winters; cf. Forrest-Thomson, Poetic artifice: A theory of twentieth-century poetry, Manchester University Press, 1978, p39): the ‘broken medium’ expresses the brokenness of reality. There is room in Adorno’s system for transcendental self-sacrifice but none for any concept of disinterestedness.\n\nIn Enlarging the Temple: New Directions in American Poetry during the 1960s (Associated University Presses, Inc, 1979), Charles Altieri argues convincingly that the concept of incarnation is central to the poetics of modernism (p56):\n\nThe doctrine of incarnation has an inherent appeal to poetic thought because it promises to resolve the two basic forms of contradiction bred by a sense of the ironic distance between concepts and world. Incarnation is first of all the union of flesh and spirit, the coming of a principle of divine order in the otherwise chaotic war between the ungoverned flesh and the harsh letter of the old law... Second, it is the intersection of time and timelessness, a way of altering the arbitrary orders of human law and human words so that they become more suited to the divine Word or Order, which understands the complexities of the flesh and natural flux.\n\nAt any rate, Jameson got the message. In Marxism and Form: Twentieth Century Dialectical Theories of Literature, he manifests identical ‘Presuppositions’, making the startling claim that ‘in Germany the dialectic somehow speaks in its own name’ (Princeton University Press, 1971, pxii). ‘To give a little of the feeling of this sense of the movement of reality as a logos’ (pxii) in Adorno’s writing, he explicitly invokes the concept of incarnation (p8):\n\nWhat happens is rather that for a fleeting instant we catch a glimpse of a unified world, of a universe in which discontinuous realities are nonetheless somehow implicated with each other and intertwined... while there flashes across the natural dimension itself a kind of transfiguration... Thus the mind incarnates itself in order to know reality, and in return finds itself in a place of heightened intelligibility...\n\nJameson celebrates ‘the triumph of Adorno over Heideggerian existence-philosophy’ (pxii), endorsing Adorno’s objections to ‘the subjective idealism of Heideggerian existentialism, a kind of ahistorical historicity, a mystique of anxiety, death, and individual destiny without any genuine content’ (p56). His own aesthetic of the ‘glimpse’ and the ‘fleeting instant’ is reminiscent of nothing so much as the highly ‘subjective’ aestheticist ‘epiphany’, beloved of Stephen Dedalus; and, to judge by this devotional prose, the ‘genuine content’ of Adorno’s negative dialectics includes a solid substratum of Pauline Judaeo-Christianity.\n\n3: ‘A White Stone’\n\nAccording to Scott, the ‘white stone’ of Revelation is ‘not a common stone, but a pebble such as was used for counting or for voting by ballot’, with ‘a surface large and flat enough to receive an inscription’ (p144). He interprets the ‘symbol’ as essentially parodic, in the spirit of the sarcastic ‘counsel’, in the letter to Laodicea, ‘renowned for the beautiful glossy black wool of its sheep’ (p155), to ‘buy of me... white garments... that the shame of thy nakedness be not made manifest’ (R3:18). The intended target of the ‘white stone’ is the ‘popular superstition’ of Gnosticism, in which, ‘early in the second century’, ‘Jewish and Hellenic thought were mingling’ (pp144-145):\n\nThat explanation seems the best which finds the origin of the symbol in the sphere of popular superstition. Among the later Jews, especially, great and mysterious power had for long been ascribed to secret names, the knowledge or pronouncement of which secured the opening of closed portals, the discovery of hid treasure, or the co-operation of supernatural powers. One special application of such names of power was to obtain entrance for the ascending soul through the successive gates which were supposed to bar its way to the highest heaven... To one holding such ideas, a white stone with a secret name upon it would signify an amulet inscribed with a formula or name of power by which he could secure salvation or entrance into heaven. To this... the Apocalypse gives a Christian interpretation. The white stone is just the pebble or tile or plaque on which a name could conveniently be inscribed. The promised gift of Christ is the new name, which here, as elsewhere in the Bible, stands for a new character... Our Lord once more clothes his own great gift in the forms ‘understanded of the people’, thereby contrasting the false with the true. Did others speak of symbols giving them a right to enter heaven? He would give to him that overcometh a surer symbol for a truer heaven.\n\nI appreciate the dig at Laodicean wool, very much in the spirit of Kitchen Poems (compare ‘the water of life/ is all in bottles & ready for invoice’, ‘Die a Millionaire’; R22:17), but it seems to me reductive to interpret the ‘white stone’ in the same fashion. Its prospective recipients, the members of ‘the church of Pergamum’, had already been exposed to ‘peculiar difficulty and danger’ (p142): ‘thou holdest fast my name, and didst not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed amongst you’ (R2:13). The steadfastness of ‘him that overcometh’ in the face of martyrdom would be curiously — and superfluously — rewarded by ‘a new character’.\n\nScott is anxious to demystify the trope as ‘just’ an ordinary object. In Revelation, however, Gnosticism seems less ‘conveniently’ placed. Even a loaded account of its ‘grandiose’ doctrine confirms its relevance to a reading of Prynne (The Early Church, Henry Chadwick, Penguin, 1967, pp35-36):\n\nWhat they claimed to ‘know’ consisted of a myth about the creation of the world as the result of a pre-cosmic disaster which accounted for the present misery of man’s lot, and about the way in which the elect may be redeemed. In the elect, they believed, there was a divine spark that had become imprisoned in matter and had lost its memory of its true, heavenly home... The present material world the Gnostics regarded as utterly alien to God and to goodness, and as therefore the creation of inferior powers... The world was in the iron control of evil powers... and after death the elect soul would be faced by a perilous journey through the planetary spheres back to its heavenly home. Much time was therefore devoted to learning the correct magic passwords and the most potent amulets...\n\n‘The Numbers’, in which the word ‘elect’ occurs no less than six times, and ‘Star Damage at Home’, which features ‘the white stone’ in a context of ‘cosmic disaster’, are amongst the poems I intend to read in this light in a later instalment of this essay.\n\nScott is reluctant to consider the possibility that what appears on the white stone — ‘a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it’ — might be the Logos itself. Almost the same trope recurs in R19:11-13:\n\nAnd I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.\n\nThere is an obvious parallel between R2:17 and this vision of the ‘Logos’, ‘the specifically Johannine description of Him that was “from the beginning”, used in reference to a person only here and in John 1’ (Scott, p276), in which the evangelist’s use of the language of Gnosticism has been illustrated by Bultmann. White is the colour of purity, but also of victory and triumph, appropriate to ‘him that overcometh’ — this phrase does not occur in R19, but reinforces the analogy with the victorious white horseman. In this context, however, Scott is at pains to refute the implied identity between the ‘new name’ and the ‘Logos’, ignoring the implications of ‘many crowns’ and making a brave attempt to distinguish between the two occurrences, in consecutive verses, of the word ‘name’ in R19:12-13 (p276):\n\nThe first passage illustrates the importance and significance of the ‘name’, the second its belonging to Christ. This name, therefore, is not that to be mentioned in the next verse, but another, a ‘name of power’, which is indeed ‘not known’...\n\nThus Scott finds himself arguing for a Gnostic interpretation of the ‘new name’, in order to argue against the imputation of heresy in the identification of the recipient of the ‘white stone’ with the ‘Logos’. I find this special-pleading difficult to credit. Despite its immediate disclosure, it seems entirely reasonable to identify the unknown ‘name’, in both contexts, with the ‘Logos’, the ultimate amulet.\n\nScott considers four other possible meanings of the ‘white stone’, although, in his own opinion, ‘none of them provides a convincing explanation of the new name upon the stone known only to the receiver’ (p144). Insistence on the uniqueness of ‘the new name’ is like interpreting ‘He that hath an ear’ as intended to disqualify listeners with two. In any case, as Scott acknowledges, each hypothesis ‘has its supporters of note’ (p144):\n\nWas it connected with (1) the white stone or pebble used by jurors to signify acquittal; (2) a stone tablet which served as a pass to secure entry into an assembly or a banquet; (3) precious stones which were said by tradition to have been gathered by the Israelites along with the manna; or (4) the Urim and Thummim, the stones of which were also inscribed with names?\n\nThe first is also considered by Wheale, who cites a commentary on the text and glosses the white stones of Prynne’s title as ‘tokens of chosenness, the poems held as signs of decision, with as little as possible of what is sanctimonious attaching to them’ (p104). The judicial interpretation is supported by The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Living Bible Vol. 14: Epistles; Revelation, edited by Edward P. Blair (San Francisco Productions, 1967, p76):\n\nThe mystic ‘white stone’ enumerated among the other objects passed on to the church at Pergamon is a sign of acquittal. A stone (psephos in Greek, also used for mosaic stones) was used for voting by the judges of the Athenian courts... To vote with a white stone meant acquittal, while a black stone stood for condemnation. The legendary origin of the trial goes back to Orestes... in the Areopagus... As the votes were evenly divided, Pallas-Athene, who favoured him, threw in a white stone (the calculus Minervae) and thus got him acquitted.\n\nHence ‘psephology’, etymologically ‘the study of stones’. This interpretation seems more compatible with Scott’s own than he concedes: in both Revelation and Greek myth, a token of favour is given by an immortal figure to a courageous mortal in imminent danger of condemnation by his own community.\n\nAs regards the second interpretation, the idea of a ‘banquet’ is compatible with the promise of ‘hidden manna’, which may be metonymically associated with the ‘white stone’, as implicitly in Exodus 16:14 (‘a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground’) and explicitly in Milton’s image of ‘pearly grain’ (Paradise Lost, V 430): ‘Iconographically, manna was represented most commonly as scattered pellets, more or less pearl-sized’ (note by Alastair Fowler, Longman Annotated English Poets, 1971, p284). Rather than being ‘gathered... along with the manna’, then, Scott’s ‘precious stones’ may be an alternative trope of the ‘hidden manna’ itself.\n\nThe ‘Urim and Thummim’, mysterious words whose ‘meaning... is not clear’, are also too hastily dismissed from the reckoning (‘Urim and Thummim’, Hendrik C. Spykerboer, Oxford Companion to the Bible, edited by Bruce Metzger and Michael D. Coogan, OUP, 1993, pp786-787):\n\nThese two words usually occur together... Although both are plural in form, they seem to refer to single objects that functioned as sacred lots and may have had the form of dice, pebbles or sticks. Another possibility is that they were two stones, one white and the other black... What is clear is that they were associated with the priestly office and were used when people came to seek divine consultation. Apparently, therefore, it was thought possible for the high priest and the Levites to give a divine oracle with the help of the Urim and Thummim... these lots fell into disuse when the monarchy was established.\n\nIn the First Temple, the holy of holies ‘contained the ark of the covenant and two winged figures (cherubim)’; in the Second Temple, however, the holy of holies was ‘empty except for a sacred stone’ and separated from the nave by a ‘veil of Babylonian tapestry’ (‘Temple’, William Sanford LaSor, The Oxford Companion, pp731-734). It is this ‘veil’ which is ‘rent’ at the climax of the crucifixion (Luke 23:45: ‘And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst’).\n\nFor Dryden, the contrast between the First and Second Temples is symbolic of the relationship between contemporary Caroline poetry and that of the great Jacobeans (‘To Mr Congreve’, 1694):\n\nStrong were our Syres; and as they Fought they Writ,\n\nConqu’ring with force of Arms, and dint of Wit;\n\nTheirs was the Gyant Race, before the Flood;\n\nAnd thus, when Charles Return’d, our Empire stood...\n\nOur Age was cultivated thus at length;\n\nBut what we gain’d in skill we lost in strength.\n\nOur Builders were, with want of Genius, curst;\n\nThe Second Temple was not like the First.\n\nDryden’s stanzas are the cornerstone of The Burden of the Past and the English Poet (Harvard, 1970) by Walter Jackson Bate, whose seminal study of ‘the anxiety of influence’ is acknowledged as such by Bloom (p8). The third line cited is a memorable conflation of Genesis 6:4 (‘There were giants in the earth in those days’) and Matthew 24:38 (‘the days that were before the flood’). If John Donne is any sample, however, the ‘Gyant Race’ was itself prey to the anxiety of influence: ‘We’are scarce our Fathers shadowes cast at noone’ (‘An Anatomie of the World: The First Anniversary’, Complete Poetry and Selected Prose, edited by John Hayward, Nonesuch, 1929, p200).\n\nThen again, Blake’s echo is a specific endorsement of Dryden’s pessimistic point. He invokes the same ‘Giants of Mighty arm, before the flood’ in his earliest and darkest allegory, ‘Then she bore Pale desire...’, written ‘before 1777’ (Blake: Complete Poetry and Prose, edited by Geoffrey Keynes, Nonesuch, 1927, p667). It is a brilliant if inchoate fragment, with an ironic allusion to Psalm 19:\n\nNow day arose, the Golden Sun his mighty Race began, Refreshing the Cold earth with beaming Joy.\n\nThe poet’s premises are those of abject mortality: weakness, fear and impotent desire. The ephebe aspires to emulate the ‘Sun’, but suffers instead the torments of ‘Envy’ (p668):\n\nEnvy hath a serpent’s head of fearful bulk, hissing with hundred tongues; her pois’nous breath breeds Satire, foul contagion, from which none are free... Most Black and loathsom through the land it Runs, Rolling with furious Noise; but at the last it settles in a lake called Oblivion. ’Tis at this River’s fount where ev’ry mortal’s Cup is Mix’t. My cup is fill’d with Envy’s Rankest Draught... However sweet, ’tis Envy that Inspires my Song. Prickt by the fame of others how I mount, and my complaints are Sweeter than their Joys; but O, could I at Envy Shake my hands, my notes should Rise to meet the New born Day.\n\nBlake’s ‘cup runneth over’ (Psalm 23), but only with ‘Envy’ of ‘the fame of others’, in particular that of Milton, from whose might he shelters in Ossianic prose-poetry (which is nevertheless over-reliant on trotting pentameters: ‘Most Black and loathsom through the land it runs’). By imaginative logic, ‘Oblivion’ is both the cause and the effect of ‘Envy’: ‘Envy’ breeds ‘Oblivion’, since it predisposes the poet towards Augustan ‘Satire’, which does not, in Blake’s view, make for immortality; whilst ‘Oblivion’, the state in which the ephebe finds himself at the outset, as well as his all-too-probable destiny, breeds ‘Envy’ of the true — immortal — poets. This is as powerful an expression of the anxiety of influence as any adduced by Bloom. Yet Milton, Blake’s greatest poem, is the quintessential expression of the elation of influence.\n\nSatan invokes ‘Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems’ in Paradise Regained (III 14); and, according to Fowler, the ‘Urim’ is identified by Milton with ‘that which here below/ Philosophers in vain so long have sought’ (note to Paradise Lost III 598-601, p180):\n\nThe ‘urim’ contained in Aaron’s breastplate (Exodus 28:30)... identified by many alchemical theorists... with the philosopher’s stone itself. The (lunar) thummim could transform base metals to silver, but the (solar) urim could transform them to gold... In the Christian alchemical tradition, the philosopher’s stone was regarded as a symbol of Christ’s regenerating grace...\n\nChrist appears later ‘in celestial panoply all armed/ Of radiant urim, work divinely wrought’ (VI 760-761): ‘The one true alchemist, he wears the stone that in Fludd’s philosophy mediates between God and the material world’ (Fowler, p347). For Donne, by contrast, the ‘oraculous gems’ symbolise the law as a lottery, and as a fount of pernicious mystification: ‘Thou had’st much, and lawes Urim and Thummim trie/ Thou wouldst for more’ (‘Satyre V’, p137).\n\nAccording to LaSor (p733), ‘the Urim and Thummim’ were amongst the ‘five things... missing from the Second Temple’, but it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the ‘sacred stone’ must have been one — presumably the more potent — of the original pair. To identify this with the ‘white stone’ of Revelation seemed to Archbishop Trench a plausible further step (cited by Rev G. Currey, Commentary on the New Testament: Acts, Epistles and Revelation, Rev William Bentham et al, SPCK, 1882, unpaginated):\n\nThe ‘hidden manna’ and the ‘white stone’ are united as both representing high-priestly privileges... If any should eat of ‘the hidden manna’, who but the High Priest, who alone had entrance into the Holy Place where it was laid up? If any should have knowledge of what was graven upon the Urim, who but the same High Priest, in whose keeping it was, and who was bound by his very office to consult it? The mystery of what was written there, shut to every other, would be open to him.\n\nAs further evidence that Prynne’s imagination actually works along these lines, consider his response to Blood Flow by Anthony Barnett, in a letter dated 11/9/72 (The Poetry of Anthony Barnett, edited by Michael Grant, Allardyce Book/ Grille, 1993, p157):\n\nMany sentiments stirred just below the threshold of acknowledgement, and how much the word is loved. Your tender regard is more celestial and abandoned than mine, but I recognise the fellow-feeling and I salute it... I think that you begin to Speak with Tongues... there is a steady note of being-there (Dasein) in each perfected token of speech. It is restorative, and has converted the mania of my own present exhaustion into another thing... Please excuse the paper*... not that Chance does not sometimes speak to those who listen. [*The verso is a photographic copy of ‘The Unquiet Grave’...]\n\nThe combination of liminality (‘threshold’), Johannine piety (‘the word is loved’), eschatology (‘celestial and abandoned’), pentecostal enthusiasm (‘Speak with Tongues’, Acts 10:46), deference to Heidegger (‘being-there (Dasein)’), Gnosticism (‘each perfected token’), extremity (‘mania’), divination (‘Chance’), allusion to Revelation (‘those who listen’ = ‘they that hear’, R1:3) and intimations of (im)mortality (‘The Unquiet Grave’) is a revealing cross-section of Prynne’s Weltanschauung.\n\nThis letter shows the extent to which it may be accurate, rather than insulting, to describe him as ‘hermetic and priestly’ (Peter Porter, ‘Two voices for our time: Poems by J.H. Prynne; Poems of Thirty Years by Edwin Morgan’, Observer, 1982). ‘There is no reasoning with Prynne’s followers,’ according to Porter; ‘you either think him the most important poet in Britain today or you are a heretic’. An ‘arcane don’, he has ‘established an apostolic succession of Modernists devoted to the reform of poetry in English’. Dismissing ‘the idea of Prynne as Messiah’, Porter asserts that ‘he wants disciples, not readers’. I don’t find it at all difficult to take him seriously as ‘Jeremy the prophet’ (Matthew 2:17), but I write as a reader, not a disciple, uninformed about what Prynne ‘wants’ and disinclined to inquire. I find myself — and increasingly — captivated by his poetry, which makes its own demands. Much of its reputed hermeticism consists in its intimacy with unconscious and physiological processes and with the mythopoeic and palaeolithic — as well as the scientific and technical — dimensions of language, history and culture. Yet there seems to me no point in denying that the cabbalistic aspects of Bloom’s system — dispensable as they might be — are also highly compatible with the ‘arcane’, the archaic and the archiepiscopal aspects of Prynne’s poetry.\n\nScott draws a relevant distinction between apocalyptist and prophet (pp25-26):\n\nApocalyptic is the successor of prophecy... at once the continuation of prophecy, and sharply distinguished from it. The prophet speaks directly to the people; the apocalyptist writes in solitude what men may read in public... The prophet speaks what God the Lord has spoken; what he speaks is afterwards committed to writing. The apocalyptist writes, describing what God the Lord has given him to see. The prophet is a speaker, an orator, a preacher. The apocalyptist is a seer, a ponderer of what he has seen, a student of what those before him have written.\n\nPrynne’s erudition — the density and range of allusion to ‘what those before him have written’ — and his constant preoccupation with the medium and practice of writing are manifest. Borrowing a phrase from ‘To Helen Keller’ by Donald Davie (‘Los Angeles Poems’, 1968-9, Collected Poems 1950-70, Routledge and Kegan Paul, p217), Steve Clark has described Prynne as ‘the most/ literary person ever was’ (‘Prynne and the Movement’, Jacket No. 23). Davie himself once described him, according to Porter, as ‘the cleverest man in Cambridge’ (Observer). In ‘First Notes on Daylight’ (p69), Prynne acknowledges his own inveterate literariness with a sardonic image of a shamanistic ‘student’ (or librarian) in Projective dreamtime: ‘The open/ fields we cross, we carry ourselves by ritual/ observance, even sleeping in the library’ (compare the ‘open fields’ to which Wordsworth ‘told/ A prophecy’, ‘cloth’d in priestly robe’). Similarly, in ‘The Kirghiz Disasters’, [Jeremy] Prynne is disguised as (St) ‘Jerome’ (c340-420), compiler of the Vulgate, ‘usually represented as an aged man in a cardinal’s dress, writing or studying’ (Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable: Centenary Edition, E Cobham Brewer, revised by Ivor H. Evans, Cassell, 1970, p586).\n\nConsidered as having ‘a surface large and flat enough to receive an inscription’, the white stone, and hence Prynne’s title, also functions as an image of the page, an insistence on the material properties of the medium, which include, besides those specified, a variable proportion of white space. As sacred stone pages, or petroglyphs, the white stones recall both the Mosaic ‘tables of stone’ (Exodus 32:15) and the ‘glyph-blocks’ of Mayan almanacs (somewhat obscurely related to ‘open field’ writing), ‘the property of a priest caste... consciously maintained as a privileged, if not secret, script’ (Steve McCaffery, ‘Charles Olson’s Art of Language: The Mayan Stratum in Projective Verse’, After Modernism: fragmente No. 4, edited by Andrew Lawson and Anthony Mellors, [Northern] Autumn/ Winter 1991, p58).\n\nAs art-objects of ‘sovereign autonomy’ (McCaffery, p56), the white stones are also reminiscent of THE STUMBLING BLOCK its INDEX (Brian Catling, Book Works, 1990; Conductors of Chaos, pp13-22), which takes its title from the letter to the church at Pergamum, source of the ‘white stone’: ‘a stumblingblock before the children of Israel’ (R2:14). In its ‘omnipotent cryptic grace’ (p21), redeemed as a symbol of Apocalyptic intransigence and potential, at once ‘compacted’ black ‘carbon paper’ and a ‘diamond’, the autotelic ‘stumblingbock’ reactivates many Gnostic words of ‘power’ (p20):\n\nThe Stumbling Block has made itself of carbon paper, sucking the increasingly obsolescent material from offices at the centre of the city. It is compressed to become a pivot; diamond-hard. The compacted density smoulders in the deep night blue of its waxy, slippery layers... In this manifestation the block is almost organic, a writhing tank of cellular activity, straining between two poles:/ The expansion of its darkness, winged by the buzzing particles, wants to unfold into the voracious speed of the stars; an explosive gleaming tracery to re-map the heavens, to disappear through power into silence.\n\nThe idea of a ‘banquet’ is compatible with Melville’s assertion that ‘whiteness has been made significant of gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day’ (Moby Dick, Chapter 42, Everyman’s Millenium Library, p207; noted by Dorward). Prynne is almost certain to have been aware of this passage from Olson’s great book, and an ecstatic sense of The White Stones complements the sense of victory. ‘The Wound, Day and Night’ (p64) celebrates a ‘supremely happy’ intuition of ‘the whole order set in this, the/ proper guise, of a song’ — an intuition happily expressed in an allusion to Lucretius. The collocation of ‘the day’ with ‘the white stone’ in ‘Star Damage at Home’ suggests an allusion, on one level, to the Latin tag which Melville may have had in mind, though, like Prynne, he is also likely to have known his Pliny at first hand: ‘O diem — repetam enim — laetum notandumque mihi candidissimo calculo’ (internet; cf. the Vulgate: ‘calculum candidum’, R2:17). Betty Radice uses an equivalent idiom: ‘This has been a happy day for me... a real red-letter day’ (‘To Maximus’ [of all names!], The Letters of the Younger Pliny, Penguin, 1963, pp163-164), but William Melmoth’s less idiomatic phrase is nearer the original trope: ‘It was a day... which I shall ever distinguish with the fairest mark’. Coincidence extends to a generous expression of the elation of influencing (p164):\n\nWhat could be happier for our country than for two such distinguished young men to make their name and reputation in eloquence? What more could I desire than to be chosen to lead them on the right road? I pray the gods that I shall always be so happy, and you can bear me witness that I hope all who think me worth imitating may prove better men than I.\n\nAn explanation of a variant idiom, ‘albo lapillo notare diem’ (‘to mark the day with a white stone’), links Scott’s first and second (rejected) interpretations (Nil Desperandum: A Dictionary of Latin Tags and Useful Phrases, Eugene Ehrlich, BCA, 1992, p35):\n\nFor the Romans, white was the symbol of happiness, black of misfortune. Thus, in a trial a vote for acquittal was cast with a white stone, for condemnation a black one; a happy day was marked with a white stone, an unhappy day with a black one. The latter procedure was this: at the end of each day, a Roman — according to Pliny the Younger, this superstitious practice dated back to the Thracians — would judge whether the day had been happy or unhappy. Once decided, the Roman would drop a pebble of the appropriate colour into an urn, so at the end of the month he could empty the urn and be able to look back over the month past.\n\nThe ‘superstitious’ Roman or Thracian may have intended not only ‘to look back over the month past’, but also, perhaps, to resurrect its most auspicious days, a suggestion of beneficent magic reinforced by the connotations of the ‘urn’ in which the stones were placed. The pain and difficulty of Prynne’s Apocalyptic modernism has borne the weight of commentary, and rightly so, but the ecstatic intensity of his inspiration should not be lost to sight. It would be hard to overstate the contrast between the Apocalypticism of early Christianity and the contented stoicism of one of its persecutors, in ‘Rome at the turn of the first century, when the uneasy years of Domitian were followed by what Gibbon called “the period in the history of the world during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous”‘ (‘Introduction’, The Letters of the Younger Pliny, p26, footnote reference to The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter 3). Pliny, for his part, explicitly denies the premise of the laudator temporis acti: ‘It is not true that the world is too tired and exhausted to produce anything worth praising’ (p28). His preoccupation with immortality is equally robust: ‘Since we are denied a long life, let us leave something to bear witness that at least we have lived... “Rivalry is good” when friends stimulate each other by mutual encouragement to desire immortal fame’ (‘To Caninius Rufus’, p92; quotation from Hesiod’s Works and Days). It would be too much to expect Prynne to endorse the view that early-twenty-first-century England deserves Gibbon’s praise of Rome under the Antonines, but The White Stones — unlike the ‘white stone’ of Revelation or of ‘Star Damage at Home’ — is, after all, a plural. The primary referent of Prynne’s title may well be the white stones of happiness pouring out of a Roman urn at the end of a particularly happy month.\n\n4: ‘The Bright Stones’\n\nFor Celan, as in Revelation, white stones are an image of renewal by a ‘new name’:\n\nDie hellen\n\nSteine gehn durch die Luft, die hell-\n\nweißen, die Licht-\n\nbringer.\n\n(‘The bright/ stones ride through the air, bright/ white, the light-/ bringers’, John Felstiner, Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan, W W Norton, 2001, p177). (Compare the subtitle of ‘Die a Millionaire’: ‘(pronounced “diamonds in the air”)’. The stones are compared to roses which open and float towards ‘du meine Leise’ (‘you, my gentle one’), a composite of the poet himself, the beloved other, everyone (or Everyman) and no one:\n\nich seh dich, du pflückst sie mit meinem\n\nneuen, meinen\n\nJedermannshänden, du tust sie\n\nins Abermals-Helle, das niemand\n\nzu weinen braucht noch zu nennen.\n\n(‘I see you, you pluck them with my/ new, my/ Everyman’s hands, you place them/ in Once-Again-Brightness, which no one/ need weep for nor name.’) ‘Rose is a rose is a rose’, perhaps the most conventional of all tropes, but even ‘die geringen/ Heckenrosen’ (‘slender/ dog roses’) may be restored to ‘Abermals-Helle’, an image of the repristination of language (‘geringen’ can mean ‘small’ or ‘slight’, with a suggestion of insignificance: ‘Geringenschatzung’ = ‘contempt’). Like Prynne, Celan is always likely to have the Shakespearean collocation in mind (though Shakespeare is free of the implication that conventionality contaminates): ‘What’s in a name? That which we call a rose/ By any other word would smell as sweet’ (Romeo and Juliet II ii 43-44). The reimagined rose is everyone’s and no one’s, ‘die/ Niemandsrose’ (‘Psalm’, p156), nameless but in no need of a name, which may, as in the play, represent an arbitrary or dangerous supplement. Yet, like Juliet’s speech, ‘Die hellen/ Steine’ is also an outspoken expression of love, in Celan’s case for Gisèle de Lestrange, whom he had married in 1952. Dating from the ‘spring and summer of 1961’ (Paul Celan: Poet, Survivor, Jew, Felstiner, p179), the poem is a simple, celebratory paradox of flowering stones, and, as a possible source of Prynne’s title, perfectly compatible with the Roman image of the white stones of joy.\n\n‘Die hellen/ Steine’ is a beautiful reprise of an earlier, grimmer collocation of stone and flower, ‘Blume’ (‘Flower’, Selected Poems, pp104-105), occasioned by the first word to be spoken, in his mother-tongue, by Eric Celan in the spring of 1957. The baby’s ‘fleur’ is immediately translated into the mother-tongue of the poet (Poet, Survivor, Jew, p105):\n\nDer Stein.\n\nDer Stein in der Luft, dem ich folgte.\n\nDein Aug, so blind wie der Stein.\n\nWir waren\n\nHände,\n\nwir schöpften die Finsternis leer, wir fanden\n\ndas Wort, das den Sommer heraufkam:\n\nBlume.\n\nBlume — ein Blindenwort.\n\nDein Aug und mein Aug:\n\nsie sorgen\n\nfür Wasser.\n\n(‘The stone./ The stone in the air, which I followed./ Your eye, as blind as the stone./ / We were/ hands,/ we scooped the darkness empty, we found/ the word that ascended summer:/ Flower./ / Flower — a blindman’s word./ Your eye and my eye:/ they take care/ of water.’)\n\nFelstiner records a draft line, which originally followed ‘The stone in the air’: ‘The shining of the stone, the extinguishing’ (cited in English only, p106). It is hard to miss the Biblical connotations of ‘die Finsternis’ and ‘das Wort’, amidst which ‘The shining of the stone’ has the occult intensity of a Gnostic ‘word of power’.\n\nGenesis and St John’s gospel begin with the identical phrase, ‘In the beginning’, which introduces, in both texts, an evocation of paternal creativity. Celan’s ‘ich’ is already belated, and it is also hard to miss the darker connotations of ‘Blind’ and ‘Blindenwort’ — of the blind leading the blind. Yet the ‘darkness... on the face of the deep’, ‘without form, and void’ (G1:2), is shaped into ‘seasons’ (G1:14) by the creative ‘Word’ (J1:1): ‘Let there be light’ (G1:3). Spoken by a child, ‘das Wort’ is associated with the infant Jesus, ‘verbum infans’, by the image of following a (shining) ‘stone in the air’, i.e. a star.\n\nThe single life-giving word ‘shineth in darkness’ (J1:5). For Celan, however, the German language had gone through ‘die tausend Finsterniße todbringender Rede’ (‘the thousand darknesses of murderous speech’, ‘Ansprache anläßlich der Entgegennahme des Literaturpreises der Freien Hansestadt Bremen’, ‘Speech on the Occasion of Receiving the Literature Prize of the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen’, Amy Colin, Paul Celan: Holograms of Darkness, Indiana University Press, 1991, pxx). Even though it had remained ‘Erreichbar, nah und unverloren blieb inmitten der Verluste’ (‘reachable, close and secure amid all the losses’, Colin, pxx), the losses — including losses to language itself — may underlie the idea of weeping and naming, perhaps even weeping to name, in ‘Die hellen/ Steine’. Yet the poem is a gentle repudiation, as well as an evocation, of grief, reminiscent of an ascending moment of Hölderlin’s ‘Brot und Wein’: ‘Tragen muß er, zuvor; nun aber nennt er sein Liebstes,/ Nun, nun müssen dafür Worte, wie Blumen enstehn’ (‘First he must suffer; but now he names his most cherished, now words for it, like flowers, must spring into life’, Hölderlin: Selected Verse, Hamburger, Penguin, 1961, p109).\n\nDie Niemandsrose appeared in 1963; The White Stones in 1968. Celan drowned himself in 1970, and Prynne’s elegy appeared a year later. I intend to argue that both Prynne and Celan, for all their differences, might illuminatingly be considered as Apocalyptic poets, according to the following definition: poetry written from the late 1930s onwards in the mode of visionary modernism and in particular on the theme of (im)mortality. I take the term ‘“visionary” modernism’ from A.T. Tolley, who clarifies the implied contrast with ‘ironic’ modernism (The Poetry of the Forties, Manchester University Press, 1985, p33):\n\nThe recognition of irony as the definitive modern tone is found in the influential critical writing of I.A. Richards, Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks and F.R. Leavis, and throughout the post-war years. Yet, in the broader perspective of European modernism irony is by no means an all pervasive feature... European modernism had little influence on the development of poetry in England... Yet, if we characterise Surrealism and the type of writing out of which it grew as ‘visionary’ modernism (in contrast with the ‘ironic’ Anglo-American modernism) we can see the poetry of [George] Barker, Thomas and [David] Gascoyne as being in that stream.\n\nTolley’s argument is remarkably compatible with the views on ‘“Modernism” in German Poetry’ expressed by Prynne (Cambridge Review, 9/ 3/ 63, pp331–332):\n\nWe have perhaps grown too used to the idea that... it was the Anglo-American revolutionary initiative that consolidated the European importance of ‘modernism’. In this view there is of course room for some credit to the French symbolistes... But there is less room for real comprehension of Mallarmé or Valery, and neither Paul Eluard nor René Char can be said to come into the picture at all. The view I have alluded to has even less room for the poets of modern Germany. Rilke is fitfully included, though in a peculiarly English way, but neither Georg Heym nor Georg Trakl have really registered with the non-specialist English reader.\n\nTolley makes no mention of Celan, but for Prynne his ‘very distinguished and exacting work’ is crucial, in particular ‘his notable recent collection Sprachgitter (1959)’ (p337):\n\nCelan has published four volumes in the last fifteen years, and the tendency has been towards an increasingly rigorous and lapidary abstraction: Yvan Goll’s dream world informed by a Mallarméan geometry of the spirit... Celan adopts Mallarmé’s primary stratagem of purity, to set off the images that evolve from his thinly-populated poetic universe. His ‘Kreutzmetapher’, or combination of terms from different levels of discourse and abstraction, deploys a curious sense of imaginative dimensions almost empty of content; as [Clemens] Heselhaus observes, his phenomena are less significant than the relations that obtain between them.\n\nCelan’s ‘combination of terms from different levels of discourse’ is clearly related to Prynne’s own ‘layers of shifted but recognisable usage’; like Prynne, ‘Celan consciously incorporated in his poems information from dictionaries, encyclopedias, technical manuals, and innumerable literary sources’ (Colin, pxxviii). However, Prynne is mistaken in his view that Expressionism is ‘a line of development which in the native English tradition had no parallel’ (p333). of which poetry is an 'Unendlichsprechung' ['eternalisation' (Waldrop); 'endless iteration' (Trotter)]. Duncan is right to place Celan in the same ‘stream’ as the British Apocalyptics (Secrets of Nature, forthcoming, Salt, 2004):\n\nA historical placing of the NR [New Romantic] group is bound to note their affinities to other poets of the 1940s... such as Paul Celan, Johannes Poethen [1928-2001], and Nelly Sachs [1891-1970]... The explanation is non-exotic; certain Expressionist poets were adapting the sensuous and grandiose style of parts of the Bible (some of them were Jewish, some Christian); and the circumstances of the 1940s encouraged poets to speak like priests, because the events of mass death and mass mourning asked for elevated speech... We can see the NRs as an attempt to refound poetry with Revelation as the dominant and normative model, with generative textual strands like Roman urban elegy, the ethics of everyday behaviour, and civics belittled and cast into disfavour.\n\nThe ‘generative textual strands... belittled and cast into disfavour’ by ‘the New Romantic group’ are precisely those revalued at its expense by the Movement. Prynne’s affinities with Movement poetics and criticism — and for that matter with Pliny the Younger — remain significant despite his supposedly decisive break with Movement poetics. Nevertheless, Duncan’s account seems to me to be entirely valid.\n\nIn detecting ‘a marked falling-off in Celan’s later and posthumous volumes’, Edwin Morgan deplores what he considers ‘cheap effects’, ‘laboured incongruities’ and ‘New Apocalypse-type rhetoric’, but his citations could be paralleled from the earliest poems as well as from those of ‘the great years from 1952 to 1963’ (‘Be-Imaged Languages’, Poetry Review Vol. 79 No. 2, 1989, p24). ‘Der Sand aus den Urnen’ (p22; title poem of Celan’s first collection, 1948) might well pass in English translation as the work of an Apocalyptic poet (‘Sand from the Urns’, Paul Celan: Selected Poems, Hamburger, Anvil, 1988; Penguin, 1990, p43):\n\nGreen as mould is the house of oblivion.\n\nBefore each of the blowing gates your beheaded minstrel turns blue.\n\nFor you he beats his drum made of moss and of harsh pubic hair;\n\nWith a festering toe in the sand he traces your eyebrow.\n\nLonger he draws it than ever it was, and the red of your lip.\n\nYou fill up the urns here and nourish your heart.\n\nCompare a stanza from ‘Europe: 1939’ by J.F. Hendry (The White Horseman: Prose and Verse of the New Apocalypse, edited by Hendry and Henry Treece, Routledge, 1941, p62):\n\nThunder and the blood shout fight to the head in a dream;\n\nRat seed and strangle harvests in the burning shadows\n\nWhere our arteries of wire shroud weed for squinting limbs\n\nAnd a lopped head, held up like a heart, crushed root and bloody\n\nBrandishes strands of flesh, the fruit of a coughing womb.\n\nOr a stanza from ‘Poem in Time of Famine: For Elizabeth’ by Peter Wells (The Crown and the Sickle, edited by Hendry and Treece, Staples, 1944, pp69-70; reprinted in Poems, One Time Press, 1997, unpaginated):\n\nYou now with a green nettle nestling in your hair,\n\nwandering with shallow, hollow feet over stones I cannot comb:\n\nin your eye light like steeples striking gaunt with the hunger of your bell’s\n\nchiming:\n\nand the wolf roars famine where the war’s axle twists in the mire\n\nand the spas of oil heap on your starred, seven-compassed eye.\n\nMorgan’s judgment is distorted by doublethink, but the affinities he condemns are genuine. The conclusion to be drawn is not that we should be suspicious of Celan, but that we should rethink our conception of the Apocalypse.\n\nCelan, for his part, might quite conceivably have joined the many refugee poets of Central and Eastern Europe who made common cause with the Apocalyptics (cf. ‘Burns Singer and Fitzrovia’, J.K., Eratica No. 1, edited by Simon Jenner, 2001, pp171-176). His absence from the Apocalyptic magazines of the 1940s is, at times, almost palpable. In 1945, Wrey Gardiner’s Grey Walls Press published New Road No. 3, a 200-page hardback book subtitled Directions in European Art and Letters and edited by Fred Marnau, a young Czech refugee who wrote in German (translated by Ernst Sigler) and a contributor to the third Apocalyptic anthology, The Crown and the Sickle. Marnau produced an admirable issue. A British contingent of Alex Comfort and John Bayliss, editors of New Road Nos. 1-2, Read, Ruthven Todd, David Wright, Nicholas Moore and Denise Levertoff [sic] appears alongside Czech contemporaries (including Jaroslav Seifert and Franticek Halas) and the illustrious dead of several European nations, including Trakl and Stefan George. In ‘The Song of Lazarus’ (pp11-19; reprinted in The Signal to Engage, Routledge, 1946), Comfort, another contributor to The Crown and the Sickle, commemorates the Jewish dead with something of the dark irony of ‘Todesfuge’, which would not have been out of place (published in 1948, it had been written by 1945).\n\nPrynne’s affinity with Celan is acknowledged; not, however, his affinities with Thomas or the Apocalypse, unless you count the ‘Acknowledgements’ to Ralph Maud’s edition of Thomas’s notebooks (Poet in the Making, Dent, 1968), in which Prynne is duly thanked for services rendered. Nevertheless, it is no coincidence that the titles of The White Stones — ‘totem, white whale, magic mass’ of the Cambridge School (Longville, Grosseteste: A Descriptive Catalogue 1966-75) — and of The White Horseman — equally fetishistic, ‘with its plum coloured cloth covers and green spine’ (Derek Stanford, Inside the Forties, 1977, p82) — are drawn from the same well. Like the first, The New Apocalypse (Fortune, 1940) and the third, The Crown and the Sickle (R14:14), the crucial second Apocalyptic anthology takes its title directly from Revelation (R19:11-14).\n\nIn my reading, Cambridge poetry reopens communications with, and is influenced directly by, the visionary modernism of the Apocalypse. Asked by Kelvin Corcoran whether or not there was or had ever been a Cambridge School, Peter Riley’s very denial — ‘Well, there was, and wasn’t, and there isn’t’ (‘Spitewinter Provocations’, Reality Studios No. 8, edited by Ken Edwards, p3) — is a tongue-in-cheek allusion to Revelation: ‘the beast that was, and is not, and shall come’ (17:11). Neglect of Apocalyptic poetry is consistent with the total eclipse of the theme of ‘immortality’. Yet its significance to Prynne, Celan, Thomas — to all the poets of ‘visionary modernism’, not excluding Eliot and Pound — would be hard to overstate.\n\nBoth Prynne and Celan may be said to have aimed, in Duncan’s phrase, ‘to refound poetry with Revelation as the dominant and normative model’. Celan inscribed Michael Hamburger’s copy of Die Niemandsrose with an insistence that his poetry was ‘Ganz und gar nicht hermetisch’ (‘Absolutely not hermetic’, Paul Celan: Selected Poems, ‘Introduction’, p27); echoed in an equally emphatic enjoinder: ‘Glauben Sie mir — jedes Wort ist mit direktem Wirklichkeitsbezug geschrieben’ (‘Believe me — each word has been written with direct reference to reality’, Colin, pxxiii). Yet there can be no doubt about its cabbalistic and Apocalyptic aspects. Birgitta Johansson cites the allusion to Revelation 10:10 (‘And I took the little book out of the angel’s hand and ate it up’) in ‘Todtnauberg’, ‘the title of which refers to Heidegger’s hut... in the Black Forest’ (The Engineering of Being: An Ontological Approach to J.H. Prynne, Umea University Press, 1997, p57): ‘eß ich das Buch/ mit allen/ Insignien’ (‘I eat the book/ with all its/ insignia’). In ‘Largo’, another poem concerned with Heidegger, featuring ‘uber-/ sterbens-/ groß’ (‘more-than-/ death-/ sized’) and ‘Zeit-/ lose’ (‘timeless’) protagonists, ‘Celan appears to be referring to a hope in the after-life’ (p59).\n\nJohansson interprets Prynne’s elegy, ‘Es Lebe der König (for Paul Celan, 1920-1970)’, as a conferral of ‘immortality through naming’ (p151), a deployment of the term as elegiac gesture, but her argument is well supported, with reference to the ‘connotations’ of the colour white, including ‘innocence, purity, and hope of immortality through poetry’ (not to mention victory). The connotations of the colour purple are also to the point:\n\nIf you\n\nare born to peaks in the wire, purple layers in the\n\nglass format...\n\nThe subliminal phrase, ‘born to... the... purple’, denotes ‘a son born to a sovereign after his accession’, deriving from ‘Porphyrogenitus’, ‘an epithet of the Byzantine emperors born while their father was reigning... the term refers to the purple room used by the empress for her accouchement’ (Brewer, p852). To ‘re-enter the small house’ might then signify a return to ‘the purple room’, on one level an image of the womb, but also an antechamber to immortality. Johansson might have found further support in St John’s gospel: ‘For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had’ (5:4). Donne alludes to the same verse in ‘Biathanatos’, his disquisition on suicide: ‘I thought, that as in the poole of Bethsaida, there was no health till the water was troubled, so the best way to find the truth in this matter, was to debate and vexe it’ (p422). Prynne’s allusion to Celan’s suicide by drowning, ‘the water is not quiet’, suggests that, by entering the troubled water, he has been ‘made whole of whatever disease he had’, namely the ‘mortality’ [‘Sterblichkeit’] of which poetry is an ‘Unendlichsprechung’ [‘eternalisation’ (Waldrop); ‘endless iteration’ (Trotter)].\n\nI take these terms from ‘The Meridian’ (‘Der Meridien’), a speech delivered by Celan ‘on the occasion of receiving the Georg Büchner Prize’, Darmstadt, 22/ 10/ 60, Paul Celan: Collected Prose, translated by Rosmarie Waldrop, Carcanet, 1986, p52), following Trotter, who explores the relationship between Prynne’s elegy and Büchner’s Dantons Tod (Danton’s Death), from which the title is a quotation. Trotter’s nihilistic reading both of the elegy and of the speech are incompatible with my own, but his brilliant triangulation between Büchner, Celan and Prynne will require extended consideration at a later stage in my argument.\n\nIn the meantime, the voice of nihilism must at least be acknowledged. As against the images of immortality, ‘the small house’ is clearly also an image of the grave; and, more specifically, ‘the technical house’ denotes the Nazi concentration camp in which Celan’s parents were murdered: ‘you walk in the shade of the technical house’. The echo of ‘the valley of the shadow of death’ is one of a series of allusions to Psalm 23, amongst the bitterest in Prynne’s poetry:\n\nHe leadeth me beside the still waters... Yea, though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil... Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies... and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.\n\nThe bitterness is reinforced by the blasphemous parody of The Lord’s Prayer: ‘Give us this love of murder and/ sacred boredom’ (‘Give us this day our daily bread’). In ‘Tubingen, Jänner’, Celan pays tribute to Hölderlin, making a half-concealed allusion — ‘er dürfte,/ spräch er von dieser/ Zeit...’ (‘he could,/ if he spoke of this/ time...’, Felstiner, p159) — to the famous question from ‘Brot und Wein’ (‘Bread and Wine’): ‘wozu Dichter in dürftiger Zeit?’ (‘what is the use of poets at a time of dearth?’, Hamburger, p111). Several of Prynne’s poems lament our own ‘dürftiger Zeit’ — and Hölderlin’s complaint that ‘Wir leben in dem Dichterklima nicht’ (‘this is not the climate for poets’, Constantine, Hölderlin, OUP, 1988, p151) is echoed in his startling reference to ‘exile in the suburbs of Babylon, where we all now reside’ (‘J H Prynne/ Drew Milne: Some Letters’, Parataxis No 5, 1993, 21/ 3/ 93, p58). Scott notes that ‘The apocalypses have been called... “Tracts for Bad Times”... specially addressed to a generation which discovered a cruel contradiction between its faith and its experience’ (p27); i.e. tracts for ‘dürftiger Zeit’. Uncoincidentally, ‘Brot und Wein’ is amongst the classic statements of the theme of belatedness: ‘Aber Freund! wir kommen zu spät’ (‘But, my friend, we come too late’, p111). Scott attributes the dearth of prophecy in the period preceding the Apocalyptic moment to a similar phenomenon (p24):\n\nThe belief... that mysterious phenomena of this kind were simply impossible in Judaism after the close of the Canon is only a prejudice. Rather does the sudden reappearance of a like phenomenon in the New Testament period... acquaint us that these spiritual phenomena have never quite died out in Judaism. They were only driven into a corner by the weight of the Canon.\n\nHölderlin is, as he confides in a letter to Schiller, amongst the acutest sufferers from the anxiety of influence, ‘driven into a corner by the weight’ of the canon of German poetry: ‘ich zuweilen in geheimem Kampfe mit Ihrem Genius bin’ (‘I am sometimes in a secret struggle with your genius’, Constantine, p169). Celan, too, was prey to the anxiety of influence, as Colin suggests, despite herself, in a sharp discussion of his alleged plagiarism: ‘the overestimation of Celan’s “anxiety of influence” is so ingrained in Celan criticism that even Wiedemann-Wolf... claims that the publication of Weißglas’s early poem “Er” in 1970 may have contributed to his suicide in the same year’ (p42).\n\nLike ‘many of his contemporaries’ at ‘the turning of the century amid revolution and wars’, Hölderlin was ‘prone’ to ‘chiliastic thinking’ (p69), his Christian faith unmistakably both Gnostic and Bloomian (p71):\n\nChrist, in Hölderlin’s heretical view of him, is the god who closes the festival of the Daylight Age and ushers in the dark. Hölderlin wrestled with the figure of Christ until his poetic world collapsed.\n\nHe planned, at one point, to edit a journal ‘to be called Iduna, after the Nordic goddess who held the apples of eternal life’ (p106). Again, remote as all this may seem from contemporary poetics, Prynne’s early sequence, ‘Voll Verdienst’ (pp33-36), takes its title from Hölderlin’s ‘In lieblicher Blaue’ (‘In lovely blueness’), reminiscent of the prophetic figure ‘Im blauen Wamms’ (‘In a blue doublet’) of ‘Kolomb’, from which I take my own:\n\nVoll Verdienst, doch dichterisch, wohnet der Mensch auf dieser Erde.\n\n(‘Full of acquirements, but poetically man dwells on this earth’, Hamburger, p246).\n\nCited by Johansson (p36), who reports the lack of any apparent connection with Prynne, this alarming rhapsody expresses the anxiety of immortality in the most poignant and desperate terms: ‘Nämlich wie Herkules mit Gott zu streiten, das ist Leiden. Und die Unsterblichkeit im Neide dieses Lebens, diese zu teilen, ist ein Leiden auch’ (‘For to fight with God, like Hercules, that is an affliction. And immortality amidst the envy of this life, to share in that, is an affliction too’, Hamburger, p248).\n\n5: ‘Singing and Dying Along the Shore’\n\nTrotter’s seminal account of Cambridge poetry as ‘transcursive writing’ is theorised in relation to the work of John Wilkinson and Rod Mengham (‘Matter for Thought: The New Poetries’, PN Review Vol. 5 No. 3, 1978, pp37-38):\n\nThe text is not so much discursive as transcursive; it doesn’t contain meaning, but rather branches out across the ‘place’ (centre stage) where we expect truth and coherence to show themselves simultaneously... transcursive writing releases the devices of semantic relation from their subservience to an antecedent and transcendent consciousness in order to rediscover them as matter for thought... the body stands revealed as a machine for the production and processing (re-production) of libidinal flows, a system of discharges and severances which is the world... For at one level language and body are systems ‘operating on’ the same fuel: desire... The conventional definition of desire and its objects in terms of a mechanics of solids is exceeded by a release of fluids which are only held up in order that they may produce further suffusions, which never halt at an object... The text is a delirious body, a system of severances (line-endings, grammatical ‘faults’, puns) which themselves... produce further flows... the ‘I’ is rocked between the lateral investments which always carry it elsewhere and the cuts which interrupt those transfers...\n\nMy argument is that the hydraulics of this extraordinary account are reminiscent of no one so much as Thomas. Compare the following paragraph by R&K (p27):\n\nAs he makes such sheer departures from the pastoral space of ordinary, integrated perception, his attention focuses on the surfaces and frontiers of physical human identity, on windows, orifices, points of inlet and outlet. Mouths, pores, wounds, throats: these are the narrow"
