        "text": "Biblio member since 2008\n\nAbout Books (Genny and Michael Winne, proprietors, formerly of Parsippany, New Jersey) has been selling rare and OP books since 1985. Besides book fairs and mail-order catalogues, long-time collectors and dealers will remember our lengthy For Sale ads in the Antiquarian Bookman and similar magazines. Our inventory of over 40,000 volumes is especially strong in the specialties listed, but contains fine books in a variety of other fields as well. Because most of our books are stored in protective boxes, rather than on shelves, they cannot be viewed as a whole. If you wish to visit us to examine specific titles, please provide 24 hours notice and we will make them available for your inspection. Phone calls to (702) 750-2722 are welcome, but please, only between the hours of 8am and 10pm (west coast time).\n\nTerms of Sale:\n\nPlease add 8.375% sales tax for any order sent to a Nevada address (unless you have provided an official resale or tax exemption certificate). All items are guaranteed as described. We take pride in our book descriptions. Every item is meticulously examined so that condition and edition are listed as accurately as possible. We strive to provide pertinent bibliographical details. In addition, our listings frequently include content summaries, details on provenance, and/or biographical notes on the author. Our descriptions are protected by copyright, and unauthorized use is strictly prohibited. Violators will be prosecuted. We always take the time necessary to carefully package your order so that it arrives safely and securely. Shipping cost estimates are based on an average size book and are intended to cover only our actual expenses. If your order includes multiple volumes, oversize, heavy, or valuable items, we may contact you to request authorization for additional postage. RETURNS: If not as described, your order is returnable within 10 days of receipt. Prior notice is requested and appreciated. Returns must be securely packaged and arrive here safely. A full refund will be issued if the return is attributable to a mistake on our part; otherwise shipping costs are not refundable."
