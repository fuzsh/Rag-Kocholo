        "text": "Charges have been dropped against Philip Johnston\n\nAn east Belfast estate agent accused of involvement in money laundering has had all charges against him dropped.\n\nPhilip Johnston, 40, of King's Road, was investigated as part of a police probe into the financial affairs of murdered loyalist Jim Gray.\n\nMr Johnston's arrest in April 2005 led to him selling off a chain of agencies across east Belfast.\n\nOn Wednesday, his lawyers were told the Public Prosecution Service had dropped the case. No reason was given.\n\nThe decision was announced at Belfast Magistrates Court.\n\nMr Johnston's solicitor Joe Rice said neither himself nor his client had been given advance notice that the prosecution was withdrawing the charges.\n\nThe solicitor said: \"Mr Johnston is now considering his options, including compensation, to restore him to the position he was in 17 months ago.\n\n\"He wants answers to several questions and has already lodged a complaint with the Police Ombudsman's Office.\n\nJim Gray was murdered in October 2005\n\n\"He was suffered personally, socially and professionally including the financial loss of his estate agency business.\"\n\nMr Johnston said his sudden and unexplained arrest \"and subsequent loss of my reputation, my business, friends, and colleagues - with the exception of a few - has had an irreparable and devastating impact on my life.\n\n\"At the end of this nightmare ordeal I learned today that the prosecution confirmed that all charges were withdrawn and would not be proceeded with.\"\n\nThe DUP's Ian Paisley Jr said the case was \"unbelievably shambolic\" and had \"cost careers\".\n\n\"One of the most highly respected estate agents in Northern Ireland has had his name dragged through the mud,\" he said.\n\nJim Gray, the former leader of the Ulster Defence Association in east Belfast, was shot dead outside his father's home in east Belfast on 4 October."
