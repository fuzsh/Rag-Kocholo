        "text": "From BBC NI news ...\n\nPhilip Johnston - the East Belfast estate agent accused of involvement in money laundering during a police probe into the financial affairs of murdered loyalist Jim Gray - has had all charges against him dropped.\n\nJohnston's arrest in April 2005 led to him selling off his estate agency chain - it morphed into the brown-signed MCW Residential, bought out by three of the managers. (If I recall correctly, one of Johnston's colleagues paid his bail when he was first arrested.)\n\nEarlier today, Johnston's lawyers were told in Belfast Magistrates Court that the Public Prosecution Service had dropped the case. No reason was given.\n\nJohnston's solicitor, Joe Rice, said: \"Mr Johnston is now considering his options, including compensation, to restore him to the position he was in 17 months ago ... He wants answers to several questions and has already lodged a complaint with the Police Ombudsman's Office.\"\n\nIt will be interesting to hear if the PPS make any comment on their decision to drop the case, and whether they clear his name of the rumours and baggage that will otherwise continue to abound."
