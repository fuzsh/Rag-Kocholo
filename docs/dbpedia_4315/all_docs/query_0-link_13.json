        "meta_description": "Diggin&#39; Bones by Phillip Johnston &amp; the Coolerators, released 26 October 2018\n\n1. Frankly\n2. What Is Real?\n3. Diggin’ Bones\n4. Temporary Blindness\n5. Later\n6. The Revenant\n7. Legs Yet\n8. Trial By Error\n9. Regrets #17\n10. Ducket Got A Whole In It\n\nDiggin’ Bones, the first CD by Phillip Johnston &amp; the Coolerators features a unique sound which combines funky organ combo jazz with modernist jazz composition. Produced by The Necks’ Lloyd Swanton and featuring some of Australia finest jazz/multi-genre improvisers, this recording shows a new side of Johnston’s music, and recording history which began in 1983 with Take The Z Train by The Microscopic Septet. \r\n\r\nThe band brings together two of Australia’s most internationally acclaimed touring musicians, Alister Spence (Alister Spence Trio, Clarion Fracture Zone, AAO) and Lloyd Swanton (The Necks, the catholics) with one of Sydney’s most in-demand rhythm section players, Nic Cecire. The music covers a range of styles but avant organ jazz is at the centre of it. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously embracing the past and the future makes perfect sense when you consider the Johnston’s most recent previous releases include CDs by The Microscopic Septet and Fast ‘N’ Bulbous on Cuneiform Records, which have been widely and exceptionally reviewed (all receiving 4 starts in Downbeat) and resulting many Best of the Year critical listings. \r\n\r\nBoth groovy and cerebral, the Coolerators play funky dance music for a cartoon universe.",
