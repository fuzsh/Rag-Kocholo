        "text": "Philip Johnston recalls how his apparent primary victory was reversed in a recount and court ruling.\n\nPhilip Johnston wanted to enjoy himself at Ted Kennedy's victory party at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston. He should have stayed away from the television.\n\nHe watched Al Gore and George Bush suffer through premature celebrations, false predictions and talk of recounts and court challenges.\n\n\"It was almost too painful to watch, because it brought back painful memories of four years ago,\" Johnston said.\n\nThe presidential election reminded many Massachusetts pols of the agonizing Democratic primary Johnston and U.S. Rep. William Delahunt waged for the Cape and South Shore congressional seat in 1996.\n\nThe outcome of the 10th Congressional District primary wasn't settled for three brutal weeks. Johnston was the apparent victor by 266 votes on primary night. But Delahunt challenged the results, saying hundreds of punch cards had been falsely recorded as blanks because voters didn't punch all the way through them with a stylus.\n\nRecounts were held in nine towns, including Orleans and Wellfleet. Election registrars and the candidate's lawyers inspected the blanks by hand, sometimes using a magnifying glass to look for dents. A positive dent was changed to a vote.\n\n\"It was a nightmare,\" recalled Orleans Town Clerk Anne Lennon, who was the assistant town clerk at the time. \"That's one of the reasons punch cards were done away with. They found the little stylus didn't go through the hole.\"\n\nThe recount narrowed Johnston's lead to 175 votes, but he still appeared to be the upset winner. Then Delahunt challenged the results in court, saying the town of Weymouth had improperly counted 923 ballots as blanks when they had dents by his name.\n\nThe morning of Oct. 4, with the court case still hanging in the balance, Delahunt was jogging along Wollaston Beach when a motorcade of black limousines sped past him. It was first lady Hillary Clinton, going to a campaign rally with Johnston.\n\nA short time later, Clinton and Johnston shared a stage in Quincy in front of 10,000 people. When Johnston stepped off the stage at the end of the rally, his son, Robert, gave him the bad news. A Superior Court judge had overturned the results and given Delahunt the victory.\n\nJohnston described it in two words - \"devastating\" and \"surreal.\"\n\nJohnston appealed all the way to the Supreme Judicial Court, but lost. Delahunt, D-Quincy, defeat Republican Edward Teague to win his first term. He was re-elected in 1998 and again on Tuesday.\n\nSecretary of State William Galvin banned punch cards after the Delahunt-Johnston fiasco. Yesterday, Galvin criticized Florida for still using punch cards. Democrats believe thousands of Gore supporters in Palm Beach County accidentally voted for Pat Buchanan when they punched the wrong hole.\n\nGalvin, the co-chairman of the Committee on Presidential Primaries of the National Association of Secretaries of State, said a national standard needs to be created for recounts. And Galvin said the courts and the federal justice department should ensure that the presidential count in Florida is accurate.\n\nDelahunt said he was \"very pleased\" Massachusetts outlawed punch cards after the primary.\n\nBut Delahunt said the real controversy is selecting presidents through the Electoral College. Gore will apparently win the popular vote, but Bush may take the presidency by edging him in electoral college votes.\n\nDelahunt said he will introduce a bill to abolish the Electoral College and replace it with a direct vote. The Electoral College gives each state a vote equal to its two senators and the size of its congressional delegation.\n\n\"I think it is something that really does go to the heart of democracy, which is that every vote should count,\" Delahunt said.\n\nGalvin also called for the Electoral College to be abolished, calling it an \"18th century method of choosing a 21st Century leader.\"\n\nJohnston could imagine how Bush and Gore felt as they waited.\n\n\"I'm sure they are all in emotional turmoil,\" Johnston said. \"You find your fate in the hands of lawyers...the candidate becomes marginalized. It's very frustrating for the candidate, because he feels he has no control over his destiny. That's how I felt. I felt relatively helpless.\"\n\nJohnston said it's even worse for the candidates' families.\n\nJohnston considered challenging Delahunt in 1998, but thought better of it.\n\nHe works as a consultant on health-care policy now and has repaired his 25-year friendship with Delahunt. The two appeared together at a forum on prescription drug prices in April.\n\nJohnston campaigned for Gore in Iowa and Florida this year. Next week, he's running for chairman of the Massachusetts Democratic Party.\n\n\"I didn't not want (the primary) to be my political epitaph,\" he said. \"I picked myself up and dusted myself off and moved on, but it wasn't easy to do. I'm sure Gore or Bush, whoever loses, will go through the same. It's much worse - we're talking about the White House.\""
