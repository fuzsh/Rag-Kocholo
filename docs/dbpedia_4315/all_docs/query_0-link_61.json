        "text": "by Phillip Johnston\n\nIf ever you visit Flannery O’Connor’s Andalusia home in Milledgeville, Georgia, make sure you have detailed directions because, like a good man, the immortal author’s beautiful homestead is quite hard to find. Luckily, my friends and I had good directions for our visit a few weeks ago, but I was still unprepared to drive through about three miles of retail world before arriving at O’Connor’s farm, a property that must have been situated in the middle of nowhere when her mother purchased it in the early 1900s.\n\nAfter turning off the highway, we were greeted with a blast of lush Georgia summertime green, trees in full bloom, birds diving across the scenery—it really is a beautiful place, entirely separated from the Wal-Marts and car dealerships that surround it. About a quarter mile up the drive, on the right, is the main house where O’Connor lived with her mother from 1951 until her death from Lupus in 1964 at age thirty-nine.\n\nUpon entering the main house, we were greeted by Craig, one of the fine folks who keep watch over Andalusia. He gave us a few opening comments, but soon let us have free reign of the property. The first thing one sees on the left upon entering the house is Ms. O’Connor’s bedroom—typewriter, bed, and crutches in full view, as well as a crucifix hanging above the bed. Across from the bedroom is a comfortable dining room with the original furniture still intact.\n\nI proceeded to talk to Craig for a while in the small bookstore area and asked him to name his favorite O’Connor story. “’The Displaced Person,’” he said. I thought this an odd choice, but only because I hadn’t read the story in a while. Like any fan, I tend to stick to my favorite stories: “Revelation”, “The Artificial Nigger”, “The Lame Shall Enter First”, and, of course, “A Good Man is Hard to Find.”\n\nI opened my O’Connor collection when I got home and re-read “The Displaced Person”, soon realizing that it is most evocative of the agricultural Andalusia setting. It is set on a farm and deals heavily with farm life, among other things. It also describes peacocks in great detail.\n\nFlannery O’Connor had a bit of an obsession with peacocks. In her book Mystery and Manners, there is a whimsical essay entitled “The King of the Birds” which details her history with this majestic bird, an animal she thought was the fullest and most effulgent expression of the mystery of God. Consider this description from “The Displaced Person”:\n\n[Mrs. Shortley] stood a while longer, reflecting, her unseeing eyes directly in front of the peacock’s tail. He had jumped into the tree and his tail hung in front of her, full of fierce planets with eyes that were each ringed in green and set against a sun that was gold in one second’s light and salmon-colored in the next. She might have been looking at a map of the universe but she didn’t notice it any more than she did the spots of sky that cracked the dull green of the tree.\n\nWhile O’Connor lived at Andalusia, at least twenty peafowl roamed the property; now there are only a few, one appropriately named Manley Pointer, who spend their days in a spacious aviary in the backyard of the main house. It is a beautiful notion to see a peacock in a place so reminiscent of O’Connor, knowing that these are the grounds where she wrote many of her stories, her two novels, and countless letters.\n\nI’ve been a great fan of Flannery O’Connor since my final days of high school. I don’t have a degree in English, so many of her stories mystify me with their complexity of form and content. (I often feel absolved of my ignorance knowing that she once told a reader to “forget about enlightenment and just try to enjoy them.”) Even so, there is at least one element of Flannery O’Connor’s writing that is absolutely undeniable for me: her commitment to the Catholic faith, a faith that engendered a deep and abiding hope that the world would one day be redeemed, that the Kingdom of God would one day descend even though, for now, the violent bear it away. For those familiar with O’Connor’s writing, the pastoral landscape of Andalusia evokes this hope at every turn."
