        "text": "QUINCY -- After 2? weeks as the apparent loser in the 10th Congressional District Democratic primary election, William Delahunt seemed every inch the winner yesterday.\n\nMr. Delahunt swooped through the district with newfound ebullience after a judge reversed the close result, declaring him the victor in the primary.\n\n\"I've never felt as good about anything as I do about this election,\" said Mr. Delahunt, who began his day with a brisk jog following what he called \"a very good night's sleep.\"\n\nYet even as Mr. Delahunt tried to reach out to supporters of his rival, Philip Johnston, Mr. Johnston was vowing to appeal the ruling Monday.\n\n\"Personally, I think there should be another election,\" an upbeat Mr. Johnston told supporters at his Marshfield campaign headquarters yesterday, but clarifying later that he has no plans to request a new race.\n\nEarlier tallies and a recount, approved by the secretary of state's office, made Mr. Johnston the winner by 175 votes.\n\nBut on Friday, Superior Court Judge Elizabeth Donovan ordered the secretary of state to remove Mr. Johnston's name from the ballot and list Mr. Delahunt as the person to face Republican Edward B. Teague III in the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nJudge Donovan reviewed about 900 ballots and determined that they had not been properly read by an electronic scanner. She found that Mr. Delahunt, in fact, had won by 108 votes.\n\nMost of the deciding votes came from Weymouth, Delahunt campaign organizers said.\n\nMr. Johnston, however, charged that Judge Donovan ruled indiscriminately. He also said that some of the ballots could have been damaged during earlier recounts.\n\nJudge Donovan was a former assistant attorney general under then Attorney General Frank Bellotti, one of Mr. Delahunt's campaign strategists. While Mr. Johnston questioned her decision, his campaign aides hastened to add that they were not suspicious of her ethics.\n\nAt Mr. Delahunt's campaign headquarters in Quincy yesterday, about 30 volunteers greeted the candidate with hugs and cheers as he began his first official day as Democratic nominee.\n\nWhen he heard the news that Mr. Delahunt, the Norfolk County district attorney, was named the victor Friday, supporter Gregory Hargadon said he couldn't contain himself.\n\n\"I was jumping up and down, screaming and yelling and dancing,\" said Mr. Hargadon, chairman of the Weymouth selectmen.\n\nCape Cod environmentalist Ian A. Bowles, who grabbed 22 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary for the district, campaigned with Mr. Delahunt yesterday, saying Democrats had to stick together to defeat Mr. Teague.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Mr. Bowles campaigned with Mr. Johnston, who then appeared to be the party's nominee.\n\n\"I got almost a quarter of the vote, and I'll be urging my supporters to vote for Bill Delahunt,\" Mr. Bowles said.\n\nMr. Delahunt reminded his field organization yesterday that they, too, had to reach out to win the support of Mr. Johnston and his supporters.\n\nMr. Delahunt said he had not spoken with Mr. Johnston as of yesterday morning.\n\n\"We've got to put any hard feelings that exist behind us,\" he said. \"If we are going to prevail, the only way we're going to do it is to tell people that they're wanted and they're welcome.\"\n\nSen. John F. Kerry, who is himself fighting a fierce campaign for Senate, said the Democrats must remain unified.\n\n\"We've got to get it going no matter who the candidate is,\" he said as he toured the grounds at the Topsfield Fair. \"I think it's important for either candidate to get this matter completely and totally resolved.\"\n\nSen. Kerry said he had a \"premonition\" that the judge would reverse the decision.\n\n\"When I saw the Weymouth vote and all those blanks, I knew there was potential for this. A day like that, with all that rain, it was simply improbable that so many people turned out to (vote) blank,\" he said.\n\nMr. Teague, meanwhile, spent yesterday stumping along the South Shore and Cape Cod. He continued to criticize not one, but two potential Democratic opponents.\n\n\"Neither of the opponents has a plan,\" he said, noting that a Johnston appeal could again change the Democratic nominee.\n\nMr. Delahunt's ebullient workers said yesterday they never doubted their man would succeed in his challenge. Yet some grasped for words to describe their elation, still shocked by their candidate's sudden reversal of fortune.\n\n\"It was like, 'Oh gosh,\"' said David Carroll, Delahunt's field coordinator in Weymouth. \"It's so sweet. It really is.\"\n\nPhoto by The Associated Press\n\nNo longer in the running for the 10th Congressional District after a judge named his opponent the winner in the Democratic primary, Philip Johnston says he will appeal the ruling."
