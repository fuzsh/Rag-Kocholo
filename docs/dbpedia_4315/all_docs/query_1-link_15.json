Thad Reddick on May 3, 2024, during a ceremony held at Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas. Col. Amy Lewis, 340th Flying Training Group commander, officiated the change of command ceremony.\n\nAs a command pilot with 316 combat flight hours and more 2,700 flight hours in the F-16C, AT-38C, and T-37B, Johnston is now responsible for directing all aspects of pilot production, programs, and interfacing with various host units, as well as producing Pilot Instructor Training graduates to Air Education and Training Command bases and fighter aircrew to the Combat Air Forces.\n\nThe 39th FTS is comprised of 106 instructor pilots who fly side-by-side with 12th Flying Training Wing instructor pilots to accomplish the critical AETC mission. Squadron instructors routinely accomplish more than 10,000 training sorties per year in the AT-38C, T-38C, T-6A, and T-1A aircraft. The squadron is one of seven assigned to the 340th FTG, which is the largest flying group in the Air Force."
