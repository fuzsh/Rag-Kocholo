        "text": "Acceptance Speech\n\nPhil has been committed to providing safe, reliable public power throughout his distinguished career spanning 50 years. Phil began his career as Operations Engineer to the Director of Operations at Kay Electric Cooperative in 1972. Phil was the engineer when the Kaw Lake building project was completed and a large portion of the system in that area was rebuilt. Phil's efforts led to system improvements with the implementation of the MilSoft distribution analyzing software and digital mapping of the Kay Electric Cooperative system.\n\nThroughout Phil's 27 years of service with Ponca City Energy, he has continued to plan, promote, and develop both system improvements and staff development. Under his guidance, Ponca City Energy instituted a proactive vegetation management program to limit the impact of tree growth during storms, led the City's efforts to become the first Oklahoma municipality to convert to automated metering for both electric and water systems, and enhanced service and reliability through dedicated maintenance programs and substation and distribution system improvements.\n\nHe was presented the 2021 Pruett-Lamb Lifetime Achievement Award by the Municipal Electric Systems of Oklahoma. This award is presented to individuals committed to public power and the success of public power communities in Oklahoma. The Oklahoma Municipal League named him to the Honor Roll of Service recognizing him for 25 years of honorable service to municipal government.\n\nHe has served on the Oklahoma Municipal Power Authority Competitive Utilities Program\n\nCommittee as both a member and the chairman; since 2010 he has served on the Municipal Electric Systems of Oklahoma Board of Directors; and was president in 1990 of the Oklahoma Association of Electric Cooperatives.\n\nLocally Phil has served with the Ponca City Tippers Club and ln the Cherokee Strip Credit Union Board.\n\nPhil and his wife Sharon are proud parents of three sons, grandparents to eight grandchildren and great-grandparents to six great-grandchildren."
