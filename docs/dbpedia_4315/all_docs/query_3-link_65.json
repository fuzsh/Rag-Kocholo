        "text": "Increasing emphasis on sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions reduction is leading businesses to invest in equipment and processes that optimize energy use in their facilities. However, few organizations are capturing adequate data to understand their current footprint, much less implement capital projects to improve it. This presentation will use case studies and technological examples to illustrate the role of data and the importance of a programmatic lens in decarbonization activities.\n\nA critical and recurring theme in any successful decarbonization journey is data. Performance and usage data allows businesses to see the greater picture and ensures quantitative results to gauge progress along the way."
