        "text": "Scene 5\n\nSynopsis:\n\nMacbeth is confident that he can withstand any siege from Malcolm’s forces. He is then told of Lady Macbeth’s death and of the apparent movement of Birnam Wood toward Dunsinane Castle, where he waits. He desperately resolves to abandon the castle and give battle to Malcolm in the field.\n\nEnter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with Drum and\n\nColors.\n\nMACBETH\n\n2260 Hang out our banners on the outward walls.\n\n2261 The cry is still “They come!” Our castle’s strength\n\n2262 Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie\n\n2263 Till famine and the ague eat them up.\n\n2264 5 Were they not forced with those that should be\n\n2265 ours,\n\n2266 We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,\n\n2267 And beat them backward home.\n\nA cry within of women.\n\n2268 What is that noise?\n\nSEYTON\n\n2269 10 It is the cry of women, my good lord.⌜He exits.⌝\n\nMACBETH\n\n2270 I have almost forgot the taste of fears.\n\n2271 The time has been my senses would have cooled\n\n2272 To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair\n\n2273 Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir\n\n2274 15 As life were in ’t. I have supped full with horrors.\n\n2275 Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,\n\n2276 Cannot once start me.\n\n⌜Enter Seyton.⌝\n\n2277 Wherefore was that cry?\n\nSEYTON 2278 The Queen, my lord, is dead.\n\nMACBETH 2279 20She should have died hereafter.\n\n2280 There would have been a time for such a word.\n\n2281 Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\n\n2282 Creeps in this petty pace from day to day\n\n2283 To the last syllable of recorded time,\n\n2284 25 And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n\n2285 The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\n\np. 179\n\n2286 Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player\n\n2287 That struts and frets his hour upon the stage\n\n2288 And then is heard no more. It is a tale\n\n2289 30 Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\n\n2290 Signifying nothing.\n\nEnter a Messenger.\n\n2291 Thou com’st to use thy tongue: thy story quickly.\n\nMESSENGER 2292 Gracious my lord,\n\n2293 I should report that which I say I saw,\n\n2294 35 But know not how to do ’t.\n\nMACBETH 2295 Well, say, sir.\n\nMESSENGER\n\n2296 As I did stand my watch upon the hill,\n\n2297 I looked toward Birnam, and anon methought\n\n2298 The Wood began to move.\n\nMACBETH 2299 40 Liar and slave!\n\nMESSENGER\n\n2300 Let me endure your wrath if ’t be not so.\n\n2301 Within this three mile may you see it coming.\n\n2302 I say, a moving grove.\n\nMACBETH 2303 If thou speak’st false,\n\n2304 45 Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive\n\n2305 Till famine cling thee. If thy speech be sooth,\n\n2306 I care not if thou dost for me as much.—\n\n2307 I pull in resolution and begin\n\n2308 To doubt th’ equivocation of the fiend,\n\n2309 50 That lies like truth. “Fear not till Birnam Wood\n\n2310 Do come to Dunsinane,” and now a wood\n\n2311 Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!—\n\n2312 If this which he avouches does appear,\n\n2313 There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\n\n2314 55 I ’gin to be aweary of the sun\n\n2315 And wish th’ estate o’ th’ world were now\n\n2316 undone.—\n\np. 181\n\n2317 Ring the alarum bell!—Blow wind, come wrack,\n\n2318 At least we’ll die with harness on our back.\n\nThey exit."
