        "text": "Ever been clothes shopping, slipped on a shirt or some boots, and they feel like youâve worn them before? Even in the crisp newness, thereâs a comforting familiarity. Thatâs how it feels watching Accidental Texan, the first feature in 25 years from Austin filmmaker and veteran storyboard artist Mark Bristol.\n\nHis first film, 1999âs media satire Natural Selection, was dragged at the time for being a little too arch and broad. Accidental Texan is broad, too, and relies on every clichÃ© in the Big Book of Texas Tropes, but that doesnât matter. Itâs the familiar story of the city slicker stuck in a small town and befriended by the local rednecks with their rough ways and hearts of gold that weâve seen before. This here filmâs greenhorn is Erwin Vandeveer (Pankow), a rising actor whose star falls real fast after getting canned from his big break. Kicked out of showbiz, he finds himself in West Texas: most specifically, in a little oil town in Taylor County. Itâs the kind of place where everyone knows everyone, the local garage is closed until Monday, and the only people whoâll help him are Faye (Moss), the waitress at the local diner, and Merle (Church). The walking embodiment of âaw, shucks, maâamâ old school Texas good olâ boyism, Merle is the local wildcatter who dubs his new young friend Harvard and pulls him into a desperate scheme to strike it rich before his loans are due.\n\nAs a dusty drama with a comedy edge, Accidendental Texan may seem like Doc Hollywood in the oil patch. Yet thereâs that twist about none of these characters having anywhere else to go. Pankow gives Harvard a charming âfake it âtil you make itâ edge as a man who has just seen his lifeâs dream go up in smoke, so it makes more than a little sense that heâd stick around to protect the threatened hopes of this grizzled oil man who has shown him some kindness. Thereâs a touching subtext about fathers and sons in their relationship, and it even gently informs the will-they, wonât-they dance between Merle and Faye.\n\nIn adapting Cole Thompsonâs 2007 novel Chocolate Lizards, first-time scriptwriter Julie B. Denny makes some entertaining and sensible updates. So, rather than Harvardâs instigating incident being the hoary old gimmick of a bad hand of cards, this time itâs an absurd but plausible and very contemporary on-set screwup that turns him into a pretend wildcatter. Such minor switches only add to the feeling of Merle as a man out of time, a blue denim frontiersman for whom a handshake means more than a paper contract. That makes Church the perfect casting for this kind of old man of the range (although still not as old as the delightfully cranky Dern as a foul-mouthed rancher). Moreover, Dennyâs script uses Merleâs experience and Harvardâs naivete to guide the audience through the life of an independent oil prospector, both the technical details and the camaraderie between Merle and his oddball crew that runs as deep as any drill shaft."
