See Removing the Document Mat for instructions.\n\nMake sure the scanner cover is securely connected to the scannerâ€™s OPTION port. See Removing the Document Mat for instructions.\n\nMake sure the Document Type setting (Home Mode) or Document Type and Film Type settings (Professional Mode) are set correctly for your film/slide type. See Selecting Basic Settings for instructions.\n\nMake sure your film or slides are placed on the scanner correctly. See Placing Film in the Holder or Placing Slides in the Holder for instructions.\n\nYou Cannot Scan Film in Full Auto Mode or Using the Thumbnail Preview\n\nEPSON Scan may not be able to detect film images, or may crop or group the images unexpectedly. This may happen if your images are like the following:\n\nImages with a dark background.\n\nImages with a very bright background.\n\nColor negative film with extremely light or dark base color (background).\n\nPanorama and regular size images being scanned at the same time.\n\nNote:\n\nTry one or more of the following solutions.\n\nMake sure the film is placed in the film holder correctly and the film holder is properly positioned on the document table. See Placing Film in the Holder for instructions.\n\nMake sure the white stickers on the back of the film holder and the areas around them are not scratched, dusty, or covered in any way. If the areas are obscured, the scanner may have trouble recognizing your film or slides in Full Auto Mode. If the problem persists, try scanning in Home or Professional Mode.\n\nUse Normal preview and create marquees on the areas you want to scan. See Previewing and Adjusting the Scan Area for instructions.\n\nIn the Configuration window, adjust the thumbnail cropping area using the Thumbnail Cropping Area slider.

See Removing the Document Mat for instructions.\n\nMake sure the Document Type setting (Home Mode) or Document Type and Film Type settings (Professional Mode) are set correctly for your film/slide type. See Selecting Basic Settings for instructions.\n\nNegative Film Preview Images Look Strange\n\nMake sure the Document Type setting (Home Mode) or Document Type and Film Type settings (Professional Mode) are set correctly for your film. See Selecting Basic Settings for instructions.\n\nIn Normal preview, the dark area around the film and the frame of the film holder is perceived as white. This alters the exposure and causes images to appear darker. Create marquees on the image area you want to scan as described in Previewing and Adjusting the Scan Area. Then click the Zoom button to preview the area.\n\nTry previewing images in Thumbnail preview instead. See Previewing and Adjusting the Scan Area for instructions on switching the preview type.\n\nStriped Rings Appear in Your Scanned Image\n\nA Newton ring is a ring-shaped pattern of stripes that appears on scanned images of transparent materials. It may occur if the film is curled.\n\nPlace the film with the base side facing up and preview using Thumbnail preview. Then flip the previewed image by clicking the (mirroring) icon in the Preview window. See Previewing and Adjusting the Scan Area for instructions.\n\nA Line Appears in the Previewed Image"
