        "text": "In February, we launched Spotify CLASSICS, our first-ever program to celebrate catalog music. Our inaugural list focused on the Classic Hip-Hop and R&B Albums of the Streaming Era and featured timeless bodies of work like Beyoncé’s Lemonade, Frank Ocean’s Blonde, SZA’s Ctrl, Rihanna’s ANTI, and Jazmine Sullivan’s Heaux Tales, to name a few.\n\nToday we’re unveiling the second chapter of our CLASSICS program: The 100 Greatest R&B Songs of the Streaming Era. Spotify defines the Streaming Era as a timeframe that spans 2015 until present day.\n\nR&B went through an identity crisis during the first half of the 2010s, but the genre found its footing during the streaming era. R&B morphed into a style of music that absorbed hip-hop, pop, Afrobeats, electronic, alternative, and indie into its sound, breathing new life into the genre.\n\nSpotify’s U.S. editorial team—along with Carl Chery, Creative Director, Head of Urban Music at Spotify—has taken on the ambitious task of corralling all shades of R&B under one umbrella, and in the end, this list offers a snapshot of all the genre has offered in the streaming era. Based on criteria such as quality, impact, replay value, influence, and cultural significance, Spotify CLASSICS is 100% qualitative. The program is driven by our editors’ music and cultural expertise—and not by data—meaning that massive streaming numbers were not a requirement for the 100 songs you see below.\n\nNote: All songs were released on Spotify after January 1, 2015.

As the lead single for 2021’s critically acclaimed Heaux Tales, it signaled a new beginning in more than one way. Eschewing more traditional pop songwriting structures, “Lost One” showed off an evolution in Jazmine’s sound, as she takes a sparse and muddy guitar loop and brings it to life with multipart harmonies that jump from the speakers in all three dimensions. Over the course of three and a half minutes, she chronicles the process of moving on from a relationship, laying bare the good, bad, and ugly that comes with it.\n\nSpotify Streams: 28,384,484\n\nFun Fact: “Lost One” was Jazmine’s first single in five years (not including the title track from the Insecure soundtrack).\n\n49. Steve Lacy – “Dark Red”\n\n3Qtr/AWAL, 2017\n\nAs a core member of The Internet, Steve Lacy helped the group mine the proggy, experimental corners of ’70s soul and reimagine them in a contemporary light.

Cole hops on the track to respond in kind, giving it an electric atmosphere that helped make it a modern classic.\n\nSpotify Streams: 160,041,592\n\nFun Fact: This song was originally released on the soundtrack for Creed II.\n\n47.

While he already had a string of hits to his name, the vocalist took an unexpected turn with “John Redcorn,” drawing inspiration from a certain TV character of the same name. Spacious and full of lush instrumentation, SiR invites listeners to get lost in the track and drift aimlessly as he guides you through one of his patented tales of unrequited love.\n\nSpotify Streams: 80,639,466\n\nFun Fact: John Redcorn is a fictional character from the popular sitcom King of the Hill, which ran from 1997 to 2010.\n\n46.

On the hit single “ICU,” a ballad inspired by generations of Southern soul, Coco’s vocal abilities are put on full display as she pours her heart out about a fading love she can’t shake. Equally personal and relatable, “ICU” helped Coco establish herself among R&B’s next generation.\n\nSpotify Streams: 47,034,663\n\nFun Fact: “ICU” earned Coco her first Grammy earlier this year (Best R&B song).\n\n45. Tems – “Higher”\n\nLeading Vibes, 2020\n\nThere’s no mistaking Tems’s voice on a track. And it’s songs like “Higher” that have made the Nigerian talent’s unique vocals instantly recognizable across the globe. “Higher” showcases the power and delicate texture of Tems’s voice as she effortlessly jumps between singing and rapping. But more than just a display of technical excellence, Tems’s talent as a songwriter is also on full display, which elevates the song from a hot track into an experience.\n\nSpotify Streams: 118,718,382\n\nFun Fact: “Higher” was sampled on Future‘s “WAIT FOR U,” which debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, earning Tems her first number-one song on the chart.\n\n44. Summer Walker ft. SZA – “No Love”\n\nLVRN/Interscope, 2022\n\nLike many R&B greats, Summer Walker has the rare ability to draw you into a song with her voice alone. On “No Love,” her languid, blues-inflected 2021 single featuring SZA, both artists reach into their bag of vocal tricks as they swear off romance in favor of uncomplicated fun. As the beat drops in and out, the duo use their voices like instruments, switching up their tones and cadences so that the track never once reaches a lull.\n\nSpotify Streams: 248,632,539\n\nFun Fact: This is the first and only time SZA and Summer Walker have collaborated.\n\n43. Miguel ft. Travis Scott – “Sky Walker”\n\nRCA, 2017\n\nOver the course of his career, Miguel has never been one to play things safe—or settle into a single lane when it comes to his sound. On “Sky Walker,” the lead single from his 2017 album War & Leisure, the LA native absorbed the trap influences surrounding pop music at the time and turned them into one of his biggest hits to date. Bringing Travis Scott along for the ride, the pair float over feathery synths as they celebrate their wins and shrug off the critics.\n\nSpotify Streams: 579,701,805\n\nFun Fact: Miguel is a huge Star Wars fan.\n\n42. Daniel Caesar – “Japanese Denim”\n\nGolden Child, 2016\n\nInitially overlooked, “Japanese Denim” languished in the long shadow of Daniel Caesar’s breakout hit “Get You” when it was first released in 2016. But once fans started to dig deeper into the Canadian’s catalog a few years later, they discovered a Southern-fried gem of a tune. As Daniel croons over bluesy, reverb-soaked guitars that would have been at home on any Stax Records single from the ’60s, “Japanese Denim” is reminiscent of D’Angelo and Otis Redding at their best and carries on the tradition of classic soul ballads.\n\nSpotify Streams: 524,032,842\n\nFun Fact: Daniel’s infamous “blue jeans” were a pair of A.P.C. Denim.\n\n41. Lucky Daye – “Over”\n\nRCA, 2021\n\nHaving found early success with singles like “Roll Some Mo” and “How Much Can A Heart Take,” Lucky Daye established himself as one of R&B’s marquee names with his 2021 single “Over.” Inspired by sounds of the early 2000s, “Over” updates the sounds of that era and chronicles the maddening confusion of a hot-and-cold romance as Lucky’s sleek, emotive vocals perfectly capture the emotional toll it inflicts.\n\nSpotify Streams: 192,213,995\n\nFun Fact: This song samples Musiq Soulchild’s “Halfcrazy.”\n\n40. Anderson .Paak – “Am I Wrong”\n\nArtclub/Empire/OBE, 2015\n\nA favorite among critics since his breakthrough release Malibu, Anderson .Paak hit a high watermark with that album’s standout track, “Am I Wrong.” Concocting a silky blend of disco, funk, electro, and hip-hop, Anderson’s trademark raspy vocals bounce, rock, skate, and roll on the track as Schoolboy Q adds the perfect level of spice to one of the streaming era’s more unexpected club bangers.\n\nSpotify Streams: 97,888,078\n\nFun Fact: “Am I Wrong” producer Pomo and Anderson also collaborated on Mac Miller’s “Dang.”\n\n39. Brent Faiyaz – “Trust”\n\nLost Kids/Human Re-Sources, 2018\n\nEven when he debuted as part of the shadowy trio Sonder, Brent Faiyaz’s ascent to stardom always felt inevitable. With his 2018 hit “Trust,” the singer showed why he had been on tastemaker radars in the years leading up. Similar to R&B forebears like The-Dream, Brent’s feathery tenor becomes one more instrument on the sparse, upbeat track. Playing off the drum’s bouncy rhythm, he gives every lyric room to play in space, infusing the track with a haunted moodiness that captures listeners’ attention from the very first listen.\n\nSpotify Streams: 502,284,422\n\nFun Fact: “Trust” was Brent’s first RIAA certification. The song is now double Platinum.\n\n38. PARTYNEXTDOOR ft. Drake – “Come and See Me”\n\nOVO Sound/Warner, 2016\n\nGood things usually happen when PARTYNEXTDOOR and Drake team up on the same song, and the slow-burning “Come And See Me” is no exception.Over little more than a stuttering hi-hat and a snare that sounds like a grandfather clock in the dead of night, the pair unload their 4 a.m. confessionals over the 40-produced track, marinating on the moments when the give-and-take of a relationship starts to test those involved.\n\nSpotify Streams: 597,671,766\n\nFun Fact: The song has been covered or unofficially remixed by Erykah Badu, SZA, Lil Mo, Trey Songz, and PnB Rock.\n\n37. Muni Long – “Hrs & Hrs”\n\nSupergiant/Def Jam, 2021\n\nHaving made her name as a songwriter for the likes of Ariana Grande and Rihanna, Muni Long took a star turn herself with “Hrs & Hrs,” reviving the kind of late-’90s soul that only comes on after dark. Evoking the best of Aaliyah, Erykah Badu, and Alicia Keys, the jazzy, smoldering tune topped charts, went viral on social media, and earned a guest feature from Usher on the remix. It ultimately landed Muni a Grammy for Best R&B Performance.\n\nSpotify Streams: 228,804,622\n\nFun Fact: Long posted a video in December 2021 that led to the “Hrs and Hrs Challenge.” The challenge was popular among the LGBT community, who thought the song meant “Hers and Hers.” She also wrote the song while washing the dishes.\n\n36. Giveon – “Heartbreak Anniversary”\n\nEpic, 2020\n\nIn a genre dominated by unique voices, few are more distinct than Giveon’s. After generating buzz with his debut single, “Like I Want You,” and his collab with Drake, “Chicago Freestyle,” Giveon shot into stardom with “Heartbreak Anniversary.” A classic, piano-driven ballad puts the Frank Sinatra-obsessed crooner’s voice front and center, and the distorted guitar licks sprinkled throughout the chorus help imbue the song with a catchiness that slowly creeps up on you.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,108,272,191\n\nFun Fact: The song didn’t become a hit until a year later due to a viral trend that began in Southeast Asia; the song went number one in Malaysia and Singapore, respectively.\n\n35. H.E.R. – “Focus”\n\nRCA, 2016\n\nIn a musical landscape where most artists try to seize the spotlight any way they can, H.E.R. has always been content to sit back and let her tunes do the talking. Despite its hushed, dreamlike air, “Focus” screamed volumes when it debuted in 2016. Accompanied by rolling piano keys and lullaby-esque melodies, an exasperated H.E.R. gently begs for the attention of another. While we never find out if her pleas were successful, we do know that the song garnered worldwide attention, an opening salvo that propelled H.E.R. into R&B’s upper echelon.\n\nSpotify Streams: 200,779,908\n\nFun Fact: Justin Love, cowriter, revealed that “Focus” is about his mother.\n\n34. Beyoncé – “VIRGO’S GROOVE”\n\nParkwood/Columbia, 2022\n\nExuding a smooth and futuristic funkiness, “VIRGO’S GROOVE” sounds like it comes straight from an episode of Soul Train filmed inside the International Space Station. Featuring a Who’s Who of pop and R&B talent—including Brittany “Chi” Coney, Levan Kali, and The-Dream—the song’s aerodynamic synths collide with double-wide bass licks for a modern disco classic. Beyoncé invites listeners to buckle up and blast off for a rollicking ride through the stars.\n\nSpotify Streams: 93,472,613\n\nFun Fact: According to Levan, the process for “VIRGO’S GROOVE” took “two to three years” with an “incredibly collaborative process” to integrate the song into the larger project.\n\n33. Frank Ocean – “Chanel”\n\nBlonded, 2017\n\nMore than a follow-up single to Frank Ocean’s universally worshiped album Blonde, “Chanel” is a deeply personal statement of sexuality and identity from one of music’s most reclusive stars and touches on the many dualities that exist in his life. Over the dusty, cha-cha-cha-inspired Frank Dukes beat, Ocean opens up about his experiences as a bisexual Black male and his struggles with the stereotypical, preconceived roles the world expects him to fit into.\n\nSpotify Streams: 732,067,164\n\nFun Fact: Ocean premiered the track online, where he looped variations of it for an hour.\n\n32. Victoria Monét – “On My Mama”\n\nRCA, 2023\n\nLogging more than a decade as one of Ariana Grande’s go-to songwriters (credits on “thank u, next,” “7 rings,” and “34+35”), Victoria Monét has mastered the art of the hit song. With “On My Mama,” she proves that she’s equally adept carrying the spotlight as a solo artist. Combining her infectious hooks with production that draws influence from Chalie Boy’s “I Look Good.” Victoria delivers an anthem preaching self-confidence that should be obligatory listening before any big night out.\n\nSpotify Streams: 101,982,284\n\nFun Fact: Victoria previewed “On My Mama” at her first headlining show, presented by Spotify in March 2023.\n\n31. Rihanna – “Love On The Brain”\n\nRoc Nation, 2016\n\nWidely considered among the best vocal performances of Rihanna’s career, “Love On The Brain” is a testament to the icon’s versatility and her ability to record across genres. Over the gentle swing of the doo-wop ballad, Rihanna’s rough-edged alto proves to be a magnetic combination, helping “Love On The Brain” swell into one of ANTI’s most enduring songs—a true classic in the singer’s illustrious catalog of hits.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,423,947,646\n\nFun Fact: “Love on the Brain” was the first song commissioned for Rihanna’s album ANTI.\n\n30. SZA – “Broken Clocks”\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment/RCA, 2018\n\nIn an era where attention is fleeting and singular cultural moments increasingly rare, SZA’s debut album, Ctrl, stood out for its ability to command the world’s attention for well over a year. As the fourth of Ctrl’s five official singles—all certified double Platinum at least—“Broken Clocks” offered one more piece of evidence that the singer was in a creative zone during the album’s creation. Over trap drums and pitch-shifted vocal samples, SZA drops a jazzy ode to a former flame with the power to keep her feelings frozen in time.\n\nSpotify Streams: 582,595,453\n\nFun Fact: “Broken Clocks” samples “West,” which was performed and written by River Tiber and Daniel Caesar.\n\n29. Tems – “Free Mind”\n\nLeading Vibes, 2022\n\nOriginally released in 2020 as part of Tems’s debut EP, For Broken Ears, it wasn’t until 2022 that “Free Mind” clicked with fans. Not an official single at the time, its viral streaming success sent the song shooting up the charts and is still Tems’s biggest solo hit to date. Recorded with little more than a laptop and a portable keyboard, the song makes you feel every last bit of angst in Tems’s voice as she sings about the obstacles that stand in the way of her and mental peace.\n\nSpotify Streams: 144,520,147\n\nFun Fact: “Free Mind” is the third song to reach number one on Billboard’s U.S. Afrobeats chart.\n\n28. Solange ft. Sampha – “Don’t Touch My Hair”\n\nSaint/Columbia, 2016\n\nA literal reference to a racially loaded act, “Don’t Touch My Hair” puts a voice to the indignity regularly experienced by Black people worldwide. Uniting two musical vanguards in Solange and Sampha, the song also serves as a larger commentary on white supremacy, misogyny, and body autonomy, expressing what it means to exist in a world that treats you with hostility. Backed by blaring horns on the chorus, the pair adopt “What you say to me?” as a refrain of protest against those who won’t respect boundaries or make space for others.\n\nSpotify Streams: 55,217,137\n\nFun Fact: The song’s music video features different hairstyles such as Marcel waves, beaded braids, afros, looped braids, etc. The hair styling for the video was done by Nikki Nelms.\n\n27. The Internet ft. KAYTRANADA – “Girl”\n\nColumbia, 2015\n\nThe Internet was one of the more welcome surprises to form from the early-2010s big bang that was Odd Future, serving up a self-assured vision of cosmic funk and soul. “Girl” sits at the heart of their third album, Ego Death. Rolling along with KAYTRANADA’s signature off-kilter drums, Syd uses her delicate vocals to explain all the reasons why she and the object of her affection should be together. It’s an electro-influenced slow burner that adds a touch of swagger to the group’s tried-and-true formula.\n\nSpotify Streams: 143,818,667\n\nFun Fact: “Girl” is The Internet’s most-streamed song on Spotify.\n\n26. Summer Walker ft. Bryson Tiller – “Playing Games”\n\nLVRN/Interscope, 2019\n\nPairing two of the biggest names from R&B’s new wave, “Playing Games” immediately proved that Summer Walker’s initial success was no fluke. Like many of Summer’s best hits, the two-and-a-half minute track never overstays its welcome as she and Bryson Tiller air their grievances over the other’s perceived commitment issues, matching each other’s stormy emotions as they’re put on display for the world to consume.\n\nSpotify Streams: 419,707,519\n\nFun Fact: The song samples Destiny’s Child‘s song “Say My Name” (1999).\n\n25. Jhené Aiko ft. Swae Lee – “Sativa”\n\nARTium/Def Jam, 2018\n\nJhené Aiko always had a knack for churning out hits that felt like they were recorded in the clouds. But on “Sativa” she refined her trademark sound to perfection. Bringing Rae Sremmurd’s Swae Lee along for a Zero-G trip through a blissed-out beat as airy as Jhené’s voice, the pair wax poetic about taking time to chill out and enjoy life’s moments for what they are.\n\nSpotify Streams: 452,820,929\n\nFun Fact: “Sativa” is Jhené ’s most streamed Spotify song to date.\n\n24. Beyoncé – “Plastic Off the Sofa”\n\nParkwood/Columbia, 2022\n\nWhen you compare “PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA” to the other songs on RENAISSANCE, it sticks out like a sore thumb. But that’s hardly a bad thing. Featuring songwriting and production contributions from Syd and Sabrina Claudio, the song takes a stylistic detour from the crunchy, futuristic sounds spanning the rest of the album. Instead, it delivers a softer, more organic sound that could even be described as vintage. While it essentially functions as a mid-album intermission, the song still very much stands on its own, highlighting Beyoncé’s underappreciated ear for the sort of subtle and nuanced mid-tempo jams that comprise her best deep cuts.\n\nSpotify Streams: 86,909,593\n\nFun Fact: Though not a single, “PLASTIC OFF THE SOFA” won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance in 2023.\n\n23. Bryson Tiller – “Exchange”\n\nRCA, 2016\n\nThe second single from Bryson Tiller’s landmark album T R A P S O U L, “Exchange” proved that the budding talent was no one-hit wonder. The song’s brooding, melodramatic production serves as the perfect backdrop for Bryson’s late-night tales of woe and regret, casting himself as a victim of love as he lays bare his self-inflicted wounds.\n\nSpotify Streams: 944,955,118\n\nFun Fact: The song contains a sample of K.P. & Envyi‘s 1998 hit “Swing My Way.”\n\n22. SZA ft. Travis Scott – “Love Galore”\n\nTDE/RCA, 2017\n\nMore than any other song, “Love Galore” marked the turning point for SZA where she went from an artist on the rise to a bona fide superstar. Released in advance of her debut album, Ctrl, the song quickly caught on with fans thanks in part to the dreamy, tropical atmosphere the beat casts over the song, and a cameo from a red-hot Travis Scott. But it’s SZA’s performance that’s the main attraction here, as she delivers the sorts of melodic earworms that are near impossible to get out of your head.\n\nSpotify Streams: 794,436,723\n\nFun Fact: According to SZA, the “I Love on my ladies/Love to my ladies/Dated a few” line is true.\n\n21. Wizkid ft. Tems – “Essence”\n\nStarboy/RCA, 2020\n\nBy our not-so-scientific observations, it only takes the first two lines of “Essence” for a listener to be drawn into its orbit. Trading serpentine melodies over an Afrobeats riddim that bounces along at a leisurely pace, Wizkid and Tems generate a heat on the track that can turn the coldest winter day into a sultry summer vibe. Fans around the world responded in kind, helping turn “Essence” into one of the biggest tracks to ever come out of Africa.\n\nSpotify Streams: 230,735,273\n\nFun Fact: “Essence” is the first Nigerian song in history to chart on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Billboard Global 200.\n\n20. Silk Sonic – “Leave The Door Open”\n\nAtlantic, 2021\n\nConceived as a joke between friends, Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak’s Silk Sonic side project became quite real during the pandemic. And when the project’s lead single, “Leave The Door Open,” dropped, its throwback soul sound instantly resonated with fans—perhaps to an extent neither artist expected. A sultry ballad evoking the dustiest late-night grooves from the ’70s, the hit perfectly melds the Top 40 sensibilities of Bruno with the indie leanings of Anderson and would ultimately go on to win Song of the Year at the 2022 Grammys. Not bad for an idea that began as an afterthought.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,269,678,632\n\nFun Fact: The bridge of the song “almost broke the band up,” according to Bruno.\n\n19. Summer Walker – “Girls Need Love”\n\nLVRN/Interscope, 2018\n\nSummer Walker’s greatest strength as a songwriter is her ability to drop the pretense and say the quiet part out loud. On her 2018 breakout hit, “Girls Need Love,” the Atlanta singer does not hide behind metaphors as she laments the double standards society lobs at her honesty. Like most of her debut EP, Last Day Of Summer, “Girls Need Love” plays out like a slowed-down trap banger emerging from the ether, setting the mood for Summer’s plainspoken manifesto about the universal desire for physical affection.\n\nSpotify Streams: 315,977,925\n\nFun Fact: Drake heard the song and DM’d Summer on social media about doing a remix.\n\n18. Miguel ft. J. Cole – “Come Through and Chill”\n\nRCA, 2018\n\nGiven the personalities involved, it’d be reasonable to assume that “Come Thru and Chill” was the first time that Miguel, J. Cole, and producer Salaam Remi had all worked together. However, they first crossed paths on Miguel’s 2010 major-label debut, “All I Want Is You.” After reuniting in 2017, the trio proved you can recapture lightning in a bottle—with even greater success. Conjuring that original magic, the musical heavyweights mix R&B, hip-hop, and vintage soul to great effect, creating a drowsy, cloudy vibe that fully envelops you from the moment you hit play.\n\nSpotify Streams: 240,100,017\n\nFun Fact: Miguel originally uploaded a version of the song to his SoundCloud page in June 2016 without J. Cole on it.\n\n17. SZA – “Good Days”\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment/RCA, 2020\n\n“Good Days” reunites SZA with producer Carter Lang, who was vital to shaping the sound of her opus, Ctrl. Combining the pop sensibilities of her debut album while revisiting some of the more adventurous ideas from earlier releases—including her trip-hop and synth pop-tinged EP Z—the track incorporates those stylistic cues in the effortless manner the world has come to expect. Over the shimmering, rippling instrumental, SZA makes a case for solitude—mental and physical—when the weight of the world feels like too much to bear.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,033,933,774\n\nFun Fact: SZA first teased the song in July 2020 on her Instagram stories. She then featured it at the end of the music video for “Hit Different” in September 2020.\n\n16. Beyoncé – “Formation”\n\nParkwood/Columbia, 2016\n\nLike the rest of her autobiographical concept album, Lemonade, “Formation” sees Beyoncé mining her personal life for inspiration. But unlike some of the album’s heavier moments, the hit single takes a lighter, more playful approach as the pop monolith lets the world know exactly where she comes from. Working over a Mike WiLL Made-It beat that sounds like some Dirty South funk snatched from the year 4000, Bey doesn’t hold back an ounce of pride, leading to the iconic moment where she tells you everything that goes into making a Texas Bama.\n\nSpotify Streams: 309,235,872\n\nFun Fact: Beyoncé performed it during her guest appearance at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show the day after its premiere. “Formation” was also Google’s most-searched song of 2016.\n\n15. The Weeknd – “Die For You”\n\nXO/Republic, 2017\n\nOne of R&B’s preeminent ice lords, The Weeknd underwent a moment of sobering self-examination on “Die For You,” revealing the emotions that swirl in his head in those quiet times between sleep and the nightlife. Over the course of four and a half minutes, the Toronto native stumbles through unfamiliar territory, admitting from the jump that his attempts at opening up are, at best, clumsy. But even with Starboy’s willingness to flash his more human side, it wasn’t until 2023 that the song truly resonated with fans, going viral on TikTok and earning the unique distinction as the song with the longest climb to number one on the charts.\n\nSpotify Streams: 2,156,988,175\n\nFun Fact: The song’s viral moment led to a new video and remix featuring Ariana Grande; it became the fourth-best-selling single of 2023.\n\n14. Daniel Caesar – “Get You”\n\nGolden Child, 2016\n\nSometimes less is more, and in the case of “Get You” it works to great effect for Daniel Caesar and Kali Uchis. Each of the song’s individual aspects are unassuming on their own—whether it be the lazy drawl of the production or the restrained vocals from both artists—but when combined, a strange alchemy turns it into pure gold. The first single from Daniel’s timeless debut album, Freudian, the hit was a breakthrough moment for the Toronto singer, providing the spark for a career that has burned brightly ever since.\n\nSpotify Streams: 972,868,310\n\nFun Fact: There were two alternate versions of “Get You” that were made before Daniel and his producers found the right groove for the song.\n\n13. Ella Mai – “Boo’d Up”\n\nRCA, 2018\n\nDiscovered on social media by Mustard, Ella Mai struck up a creative partnership with the West Coast superproducer, eventually leading to her 2018 summer smash “Boo’d Up.” Inspired by an obscure sample (the Johnny Gill deep cut “There U Go” off the Boomerang OST), the throwback vibe of the production showcases Mustard’s versatility behind the boards; Ella wastes no time jumping in with her smooth and soulful vocals. The result is one of the most laid-back hits of the past decade and the perfect song to throw on in the car.\n\nSpotify Streams: 356,933,330\n\nFun Fact: “Boo’d Up” rose in popularity on social media as well as in nightclubs, notably in the Bay Area, but the song truly grew on radio airplay in the spring of 2018.\n\n12. SZA – “The Weekend”\n\nRCA, 2017\n\nThe ’90s slow jam is something of a lost art, but on “The Weekend,” SZA and producer ThankGod4Cody do their part to make sure it doesn’t go extinct. Evoking the likes of SWV, Jodeci, and Mary J. Blige, the multipart harmonies and molasses-coated bass line take you back to the era when late-night radio dedications were still a thing. But before you get too lost in a wave of nostalgia, SZA pulls you back into the streaming era with her inimitable voice, running through the complexities of an increasingly messy situationship.\n\nSpotify Streams: 518,821,458\n\nFun Fact: The song samples “Set the Mood Prelude” from Justin Timberlake’s FutureSex/LoveSounds.\n\n11. Childish Gambino – “Redbone”\n\nMcDJ/Glassnote, 2016\n\nIncluding Childish Gambino’s “Redbone” on any best-of list is one of the least controversial acts you could commit in 2024. But prior to its release in 2016, Donald Glover’s swerve into funk- and soul-inflected R&B was a force of nature few saw coming. Starting with Bootsy’s Rubber Band’s “I’d Rather Be With You” as a sonic blueprint, the multi-hyphenate talent takes the sprawling funk classic and streamlines it until its most affecting parts are all that remain. But it’s Donald’s vocal performance that produces the biggest surprise, revealing a jaw-dropping falsetto that still has people arguing about whether or not it’s actually him on the mic.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,573,818,501\n\nFun Fact: 2017’s Get Out, directed by Jordan Peele, features the song during the film’s opening scene. The song originally debuted at number 75 on Billboard Hot 100. In 2017, it reentered and peaked at number 12.\n\n10. Chris Brown ft. Drake – “No Guidance”\n\nRCA, 2019\n\nDespite their status as rap and R&B titans, Chris Brown and Drake hadn’t found much time to collaborate, in part due to a public feud that spanned nearly a decade. So when the duo joined forces on “No Guidance” in 2019, fans finally got the moment they had been anticipating for years. And it didn’t disappoint.\n\nTrading lines over a sleek, bouncy track that’s as suited for the club as it is an evening at home, the pair brings out the best in each other as Drake’s aloof flows perfectly complement Chris’s passion-filled vocals. “No Guidance” would go on to be one of 2019’s biggest songs as it quickly topped charts and broke records en route to a Grammy nomination for Best R&B song and a spot in Spotify’s Billions Club.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,011,146,574\n\nFun Fact: Production contains an uncredited vocal sample of “Before I Die” written and performed by Che Ecru.\n\n9. Jazmine Sullivan – “Pick Up Your Feelings”\n\nRCA, 2020\n\nIf there’s any artist who can say they paid their dues en route to stardom, it’s Jazmine Sullivan. Having spent two decades encountering her share of ups and downs, one of R&B’s best finally get her proper dues with Heaux Tales. The fanfare and acclaim surrounding its release was entirely justified.\n\nOf the album’s many high points, it’s “Pick Up Your Feelings” that truly stands out as a perfect distillation of Jazmine’s best artistic qualities—knowing nods to classic soul, a willingness to explore the personal corners of her life with an unflinching honesty, and the vocal chops to make any song uniquely hers.\n\nSpotify Streams: 80,405,429\n\nFun Fact: “Pick Up Your Feelings” won the first-ever tie for Best R&B Performance with Silk Sonic’s “Leave The Door Open.”\n\n8. Rihanna – “Needed Me”\n\nRoc Nation, 2016\n\nWhile R&B had already been drifting in outer space sonically, “Needed Me” pushed the genre to the farthest edges of the universe. Featuring Mustard on the beat, the sparsely arranged blips, distorted warbles, and chainsaw synths create an icy, expansive soundscape for Rihanna to explore with her laissez-faire delivery.\n\nBut “Needed Me” is more than just the biggest song on Rihanna’s biggest album. It’s a snapshot of a singer and producer working together at their creative and commercial peaks, pushing the boundaries of pop music and redefining what a hit song can be. Far from the upbeat, energetic tracks that typically top the charts, this is a pitch-black ballad that creeps along at a glacial pace. The song’s ambition doesn’t come at the expense of its catchiness, however, as it creates a potent combination that elevates the song to one of the streaming era’s best.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,435,951,281\n\nFun Fact: “Needed Me” is Rihanna’s 29th Hot 100 top-10 hit, tying her with Michael Jackson for the third-most Hot 100 top 10s, and trailing only behind Madonna (38) and The Beatles (34). It notably became her longest charting Hot 100 hit, surpassing the 41-week run of “We Found Love.”\n\n7. Summer Walker – “Session 32”\n\nLVRN/Interscope, 2018\n\nSummer Walker’s 2018 debut single, “Session 32,” represented a left turn from the R&B status quo upon its release. Instead of the maximal, futuristic production that had dominated the genre over the previous decade, a lone acoustic guitar is front and center on a stripped-back track, establishing a raw and moody atmosphere for Summer to croon over.\n\nMost compellingly, the newcomer adopted an unapologetically confessional approach to songwriting, tapping into a level of honesty and vulnerability rivaled only by the likes of SZA and Jhené Aiko. In less than two minutes, “Session 32” places listeners in the end stages of a crumbling relationship, moving through a haze of sadness, relief, anger, uncertainty, and yearning as Summer tries to figure out what went wrong.\n\nA classic ballad that showcases one of music’s most distinct songwriters, “Session 32″ also introduced the world to one of the most influential voices in R&B today.\n\nSpotify Streams: 250,211,565\n\nFun Fact: “Session 32” was Summer’s first-ever release, which was self-produced and recorded at her home. (You can even hear the fire alarm battery in the background.)\n\n6. Solange – “Cranes in the Sky”\n\nSaint/Columbia, 2016\n\nAfter spending the previous six years dabbling in ’60s soul on Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Sol, and ’80s new wave on True, a creatively rejuvenated Solange resurfaced in 2016 with A Seat at the Table, an album that not only revealed a new sound for the artist but provided a thesis on the past, present, and future of Black music and culture.\n\nServing as the album’s centerpiece, “Cranes in the Sky” puts Solange’s songwriting talents on full display as she meditates on life’s overwhelming moments and her attempts to chill, spend, and party them away. Walking the line between traditional pop structures and free-flowing experimentation, Solange lets each part of the song softly melt into the next, blurring the distinctions between verse and chorus.\n\nAll the while, the Raphael Saadiq-produced track follows a laid-back groove that never rises above a simmer, seamlessly blending R&B, soul, funk, and jazz into a strikingly unique work that would take home a Grammy for Best R&B performance.\n\nSpotify Streams: 153,013,700\n\nFun Fact: Solange wrote “Cranes in the Sky” eight years before the album’s release, in the aftermath of her break-up with the father of her child.\n\n5. Bryson Tiller – “Don’t”\n\nRCA, 2015\n\nBryson Tiller was hardly the first artist to combine trap and R&B sensibilities on the same song when he hit with “Don’t.” But what set the Louisville singer apart from his like-minded peers was how cohesively he merged those sounds together.\n\nAcross the song’s runtime, Bryson doesn’t just flip between singing or rapping. He accomplishes both in equal measure, riding a beat that would suit Frank Ocean just as well as Future. And while his desire for a woman he can’t have is well-traveled territory in music, “Don’t” introduced the world to a shameless brand of pettiness and toxicity that would prove irresistible to an entire generation of music fans.\n\nFew songs have had a greater impact on the evolution of hip-hop and R&B as “Don’t,” with Tiller’s trapsoul sound becoming ubiquitous in the aftermath of the smash hit’s release. Its stratospheric success not only established Tiller as one of the major voices in the streaming era of R&B, but it also played an outsized part in solidifying a creative and commercial lane for countless others to follow.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,224,790,966\n\nFun Fact: The last “Don’t” is timestamped at exactly 2:40.\n\n4. Beyoncé – “CUFF IT”\n\nParkwood/Columbia, 2022\n\nWhen the world emerged from the pandemic in the summer of 2022, many were ready to blow off some steam. And in a moment of impeccable timing, Beyoncé arrived with her seventh album, RENAISSANCE. A 62-minute party on the surface, the album filters the dancefloor legacies of Chicago, Detroit, and New York through an afrofuturist pop lens to remind the world that electronic and club music is Black music.\n\nAnd it was “CUFF IT” that grabbed the world’s attention. Flaunting an embarrassment of riches in the song credits, Bey unites three of music’s greatest songwriters in Nile Rodgers, Raphael Saadiq, and The-Dream, who pull from the most revelrous corners of disco, house, funk, and R&B to create a pop masterpiece.\n\nFeaturing the trademark bass lines, guitar licks, and four-on-the-floor beats that recall Rodgers’s time as a member of CHIC, Beyoncé sets the table stakes from the start when she says “I feel like falling in love/I’m gonna f**k something up/I need some drink in my cup.” Sonically, “CUFF IT” is nothing short of a cathartic let-out tapping into the spirit of earlier Beyoncé hits like “Crazy In Love,” “Love On Top,” and “Drunk in Love,” and supplying a perfect tonic for the time.\n\nSpotify Streams: 769,533,925\n\nFun Fact: The song was originally meant for Tony! Toni! Toné!, but Raphael Saadiq decided to send it to Beyoncé. She initially accepted the demo but had forgotten about it until The-Dream found it.\n\n3. Daniel Caesar and H.E.R. – “Best Part”\n\nGolden Child, 2017\n\nLooking at the class of artists who rose to fame in the streaming era, few sit higher than Daniel Caesar and H.E.R. On “Best Part,” the two team up and put their unique talents on display for the world to hear.\n\nA duet in the truest sense, the song is kept to the bare minimum as elements of pop and indie are stacked onto its R&B foundation. Over an acoustic guitar, organ flourishes, and rhythmic snaps, H.E.R. takes the lead on the first half of the song and is given acres of space, letting the nuances of her soothing voice come to the fore. Daniel then joins her, subtly raising the energy of the track until it reaches its crescendo on the refrain, with the two pleading for the affection of a lover.\n\n“Best Part” represents much more than a massively successful collaboration between two rising artists. It’s a monument frozen in time, marking the exact location where the pair simultaneously evolved into generational stars.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,292,644,962\n\nFun Fact: Daniel and H.E.R. made “Best Part” in the studio the very first day they met.\n\n2. Frank Ocean – “Pink + White”\n\nBoys Don’t Cry, 2016\n\nWhen Frank Ocean released Blonde in 2016, he had already established himself as R&B’s leading auteur. With releases like Nostalgia, Ultra, and Channel Orange to his name, he had an army of devoted fans willing to follow him to the fringes of the musical landscape. And Frank took full advantage of this creative freedom on his 2016 landmark album, leading his faithful followers into the outer realms, where the boundaries separating genres cease to exist.\n\nIt’s the Pharrell Williams-produced “Pink + White” that stands out—not only as the gold standard for R&B experimentation, but for its background vocals that were amazingly supplied by Beyoncé. In the context of the album it sets the tone for the album’s blurry approach, anchoring the many free-flowing songs that follow. On its own, the song thrives on creative tension as Frank toes the line between structureless songwriting and pop formalism, navigating the conceptual divide with an uncanny confidence.\n\nMost importantly, “Pink + White” heralded a sea change where R&B’s biggest stars would step beyond accepted conventions and discover possibilities that pushed the genre forward into a new era.\n\nSpotify Streams: 1,194,418,867\n\nFun Fact: “Pink + White” is Frank Ocean’s most-streamed Spotify song of all time with over 1 billion streams.\n\n1. SZA – “Snooze”\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment/RCA, 2023\n\nFollowing up a creative and commercial achievement like Ctrl is no easy feat, but when SZA released her long-awaited follow-up, SOS, she made it look like a walk in the park. Coincidentally, the song also sounds like a walk in the park in the best way.\n\nBuilding on the far-reaching scope of her previous album, SZA reaches new heights on the sun-drenched single “Snooze.” True to the song’s title, the production carries a drowsy air, with slack, blues-inspired guitar licks and a beat that’s softer than a down pillow. With Leon Thomas and the legendary Babyface signed on as coproducers and cowriters, the pair bring a polish to the track that never compromises SZA’s most unique attribute: her voice.\n\nDespite the fact that she’s usually surrounded by exquisite production work, SZA’s vocals rarely fail to steal the show of any track she blesses. And on “Snooze,” as she coos about the importance of not sleeping on the love of her life (figuratively speaking), music and lyrics intertwine harmoniously. Even while delivering one of her more restrained performances in recent memory, SZA’s voice stands apart.\n\nIn the context of R&B’s elite, it’s this precise quality that—creatively—puts SZA head and shoulders above the pack, and a huge reason why “Snooze” sits alone as the greatest R&B song of the streaming era.\n\nSpotify Streams: 886,508,230\n\nFun Fact: “Snooze” peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and was the only song that spent all of 2023 charting there. It also won a Grammy for Best R&B Song in 2024."
