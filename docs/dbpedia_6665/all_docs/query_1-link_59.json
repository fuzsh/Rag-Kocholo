        "text": "As movie theater prices continue to increase (let’s not even talk about those concessions), we know it can be tough to figure out which movies to spend your hard-earned money on. With that in mind, here’s a handy calendar of some of the most noteworthy titles coming in 2025 so you can budget and plan accordingly.\n\nRecommended: The Most Anticipated Movies of 2024\n\nRecommended: The Best Movies of 2024\n\nJANUARY\n\nPaddington in Peru (2024)\n\nRelease Date: January 17, 2025\n\nDirector: Dougal Wilson\n\nStarring: Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer, Olivia Colman, Antonio Banderas, Julie Walters\n\nThe widely popular and lovable Paddington bear (voiced by Ben Whishaw) returns to the big screen in his latest adventure. The third installment in the franchise, directed by Dougal Wilson, follows Paddington into the depths of the Amazonian rainforest after a mysterious force propels him there. Slated to release in the U.K. on November 8, 2024, Paddington in Peru will see a wide release in the U.S. in early January 2025.\n\nBetter Man (2024)\n\nRelease Date: January 17, 2025\n\nDirector: Micheal Gracey\n\nStarring: Robbie Williams, Steve Pemberton, Damon Herriman, Kate Mulvany, Alison Steadman\n\nMicheal Gracey, director of The Greatest Showman, takes the reins in a biopic about UK musician Robbie Williams, who stars as himself. The film is an original musical based on the life and career experiences of Williams, exploring his ascent to stardom from boy-band beginnings to unprecedented success as a solo artist. Paramount secured rights to a North American release for the project off the heels of Gracey’s smash hit Showman, showing belief in the project’s story and box office legs.\n\nIn the Grey (2025)\n\nRelease Date: January 17, 2025\n\nDirector: Guy Ritchie\n\nStarring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Henry Cavill, Eiza Gonzalez, Rosamund Pike, Fisher Stevens\n\nJake Gyllenhaal, hot off Prime Video’s Road House, repurposes the tough-guy attitude in a new action thriller directed by Guy Ritchie. Gyllenhall previously starred in Ritchie’s war thriller, Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant, and will team up with Henry Cavill and Eiza Gonzalez, who reunite after Ritchie’s The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. Together, the three form a gang of badasses determined to rescue billions stolen from them.\n\nMickey 17 (2025)\n\nRelease Date: January 31, 2025\n\nDirector: Bong Joon-ho\n\nStarring: Robert Pattinson, Naomi Ackie, Toni Collette, Mark Ruffalo, Steven Yeun\n\nSouth Korean director Bong Joon-ho follows up his Academy Award-winning film Parasite with this adaptation of the sci-fi novel Mickey7 by Edward Ashton. Robert Pattinson stars as a disposable employee — one whose body is regenerated with previous memories intact every time he dies — on a mission to colonize a distant world.\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nCaptain America: Brave New World (2025)\n\nRelease Date: February 14, 2025\n\nDirector: Julius Onah\n\nStarring: Anthony Mackie, Tim Blake Nelson, Harrison Ford, Carl Lumbly, Danny Ramirez, and Shira Haas\n\nSam Wilson, the superhero formerly known as The Falcon, took on Cap’s mantle in the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, and now he’s ready for the big screen. Tim Blake Nelson, who played the character who becomes the Marvel villain known as The Leader, will reprise the role first teased in The Incredible Hulk and seemingly forgotten about until now. Harrison Ford will also star, stepping into the role of Thaddeus Ross following the death of William Hurt.\n\nThe Smurfs Movie (2025)\n\nRelease Date: February 14, 2025\n\nDirector: Chris Miller\n\nStarring: Rihanna, Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, Dan Levy, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Kurt Russell, John Goodman\n\nThe Smurfs are returning to the big screen, this time in musical format. One of several Smurf-inspired feature films in development, this particular renewal of the blue creatures will star Rihanna as the voice of Smurfette. Rihanna is also a producer on the film and announced at CinemaCon 2023 that she will write and perform new original songs for the project. In April of 2024, a vast ensemble cast was announced, including Nick Offerman, Octavia Spencer, Kurt Russell, and more.\n\nMARCH\n\nUntitled Ryan Coogler Movie (2025)\n\nRelease Date: March 7, 2025\n\nDirector: Ryan Coogler\n\nStarring: Micheal B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfield, Jack O’Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Delroy Lindo\n\nRyan Coogler and Micheal B. Jordan have proven to be a winning duo in critically acclaimed films such as Fruitvale Station (2013) and big franchises like Creed and Black Panther – the latter of which has generated a record-shattering $2.1 billion at the box office with only two films. Despite the plot details being kept tightly under wraps, the pair will return for a feature that is being produced by two-time Oscar-winning composer Ludwig Göransson with Rebecca Cho and Will Greenfield. Coogler is known for innovative storytelling that speaks to a diverse range of moviegoers, and his work is no stranger to big-ticket award nominations, so his newest project comes with understandably high expectations.\n\nBLACK BAG (2025)\n\nRelease Date: March 14, 2025\n\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\n\nStarring: Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender, Regé-Jean Page, Marisa Abela, Naomie Harris, Tom Burke, Pierce Brosnan\n\nSuspense and mystery meet in an upcoming spy drama from Academy Award winner Steven Soderbergh. In the absence of major plot details, Black Bag will star Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender with writing from David Koepp, who penned Jurassic Park (1993). The high-stakes film is being produced by Casey Silver and Greg Jacobs and will premiere in mid-March 2025.\n\nDisney's Snow White (2025)\n\nRelease Date: March 21, 2025\n\nDirector: Marc Webb\n\nStarring: Rachel Zegler, Gal Gadot, and Andrew Burnap\n\nAlthough critics haven’t been kind to most of Disney’s live-action remakes of their classic animated films, they’ve been a hit with moviegoers at the box office, which might explain why Snow White is getting the same treatment some 87 years after the original 1937 cartoon came out. West Side Story’s Rachel Zegler stars as Snow White, with Wonder Woman’s Gal Gadot playing the Evil Queen, while The Amazing Spider-Man director Marc Webb at the helm and a script co-written by Gerta Gerwig.\n\nAlto Knights (2025)\n\nRelease Date: March 21, 2025\n\nDirector: Barry Levinson\n\nStarring: Robert De Niro, Cosmo Jarvis, Debra Messing, Kathrine Narducci\n\nRobert De Niro plays a dual role in this Barry Levinson film as two notorious Italian American mob bosses: Vito Genovese and Frank Castello. The pair run two separate crime families that inevitably collide as the power-hungry crime bosses fight for dominance in mid-20th century New York. The film was the first project greenlit by Warner Bros.’ new film group chiefs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy.\n\nAPRIL\n\nMinecraft (2025)\n\nRelease Date: April 4, 2025\n\nDirector: Jared Hess\n\nStarring: Jason Momoa, Jennifer Coolidge, Jack Black, Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, Matt Berry, Sebastian Eugene Hansen\n\nThe hit video game Minecraft is being transformed into a live-action movie. Plot details are still being kept under wraps, but since the world-building, survival-mode video game has never really been about the story, the possibilities for the film are endless. Jason Momoa and Jennifer Coolidge will star in the film, though we’re not sure yet about the details of their characters. Characters we do know of include Steve (Jack Black), Dawn (Danielle Brooks), and Henry (Sebastian Eugene Hansen).\n\nMichael (2025)\n\nRelease Date: April 18, 2025\n\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua\n\nStarring: Jaafar Jackson, Nia Long, Colman Domingo, Laura Harrier, Larenz Tate\n\nTake out your red leather jackets and sequin-covered gloves and prepare to moonwalk into theaters and witness Antoine Fuqua’s Michael. Detailing the life of the man, myth, and music legend Michael Jackson (Jaafar Jackson), this biopic invites viewers to witness the personal woes that came along with the global success of the late hitmaker. With performances from Nia Long, Colman Domingo, Laura Harrier, and Larenz Tate, the story of the King of Pop is slated to grace big screens in mid-April 2025.\n\nMAY\n\n(Photo by ©Marvel Studios)\n\nThunderbolts (2025)\n\nRelease Date: May 5, 2025\n\nDirector: Jake Schreier\n\nStarring: David Harbour, Hannah John-Karmen, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Sebastian Stan, Wyatt Russell, Olga Kurylenko, Florence Pugh, Harrison Ford\n\nMarvel’s second offering of 2025 pulls from several previous MCU titles, as supervillains-turned-heroes story features Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Red Guardian (David Harbour), Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylendko), U.S. Agent (Wyatt Russell), and Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross, played by Harrison Ford, who will make his debut as the character in Captain America: Brave New World.\n\n(Photo by Christian Black/©Paramount Pictures)\n\nMission: Impossible 8 (2025)\n\nRelease Date: May 23, 2025\n\nDirector: Christopher McQuarrie\n\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Haley Atwell, Simon Pegg, Vanessa Kirby, Ving Rhames, Pom Klementieff, Esai Morales\n\nTom Cruise is back in action as Ethan Hunt in what was originally supposed to be Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part Two (the official title hasn’t yet been revealed). After Hunt retrieved both keys at the end of Dead Reckoning, the new film will focus on his mission to find the lost Sevastopol submarine while stopping the Entity, an AI program. Haley Atwell (Grace), Simon Pegg (Benji), Vanessa Kirby (Alanna), Ving Rhames (Luther), Pom Klementieff (Paris), and Esai Morales (Gabriel) are slated to return for the eighth installment in the franchise. New additions to the cast include Hannah Waddingham, Holt McCallany, Nick Offerman, Janet McTeer, and Lucy Tulugarjuk.\n\nUntitled Karate Kid Movie (2025)\n\nRelease Date: May 30, 2025\n\nDirector: Jonathan Entwhistle\n\nStarring: Jackie Chan, Ming-Na Wen, Joshua Jackson, Ralph Macchio\n\nThe popular Netflix series Cobra Kai has helped keep the iconic ‘80s martial arts franchise alive and kicking in the popular consciousness, and in 2024 Sony will head back to the IP dojo with a new installment. Originally thought to be unconnected to the original films or the Netflix show, a casting call announcement revealed that Ralph Macchio and Jackie Chan would star alongside each other in the new film as their characters Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Han. Few other details have been revealed, except that Ming-Na Wen and Joshua Jackson are among the co-stars.\n\nJUNE\n\nBallerina (2025)\n\nRelease Date: June 6, 2025\n\nDirector: Len Wiseman\n\nStarring: Ana de Armas, Keanu Reeves, Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, Norman Reedus, Anjelica Huston, Gabriel Byrne, Catalina Sandino Moreno\n\nThe first spin-off film of the John Wick universe stars Ana de Armas as one of the female assassins trained by the Ruska Roma, the criminal organization headed by Anjelica Huston’s “Director” and glimpsed in John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum. Details are thin so far, but we know it will be another revenge tale, and we know that it will be set specifically between the events of Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, so Keanu Reeves and his Continental cohort will also appear.\n\n(Photo by ©Disney/Pixar)\n\nElio (2025)\n\nRelease Date: June 13, 2025\n\nDirector: Adrian Molina\n\nStarring: America Ferrera, Yonas Kibreab, Jameela Jamil, Brad Garrett\n\nAnnounced in 2022, Pixar’s 28th feature film (following 2023’s Elemental) will focus on an 11-year-old boy (named Elio, of course) who is inadvertently beamed up into space and is mistaken to be an ambassador for Earth on another planet. It will be the directorial debut for Adrian Molina, who previously worked on Pixar films like Coco, Toy Story 4, and Luca.\n\nHow to Train Your Dragon (2025)\n\nRelease Date: June 13, 2025\n\nDirector: Dean DeBlois\n\nStarring: Mason Thames, Nico Parker, Gerad Butler, Ruth Codd\n\nDean DeBlois, creator of the animated How to Train Your Dragon trilogy, is bringing Hiccup, Astrid, Toothless, and friends to life in a live-action reimagining. The original film was a coming-of-age story that follows young Hiccup from childhood to adulthood, but the plot of the live-action adaptation will focus in on Hiccup’s first meeting with Toothless, a friendly dragon he can’t bear to kill, even if it means breaking tradition in his village of Berk, home of Vikings and dragon slayers.\n\n28 Years Later (2025)\n\nRelease Date: June 20, 2025\n\nDirector: Danny Boyle\n\nStarring: Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, Ralph Fiennes, Jack O’Connell\n\nAfter releasing one of the zombie genre’s most iconic films in 28 Days Later and then handing the reins to Juan Carlos Fresnadillo for its sequel, 28 Weeks Later, Danny Boyle returns to the director’s chair to direct the third film in the series. Boyle also co-wrote 28 Years Later with original scribe Alex Garland — even more reason to get excited for this one — and has assembled a cast that includes Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and Ralph Fiennes.\n\nM3GAN 2.0 (2025)\n\nRelease Date: June 27, 2025\n\nDirector: Gerard Johnstone\n\nStarring: Allison Williams, Jenna Davis, Violet McGraw, Amie Donald\n\nDirector Gerard Johnstone of M3GAN is slated to return behind the camera for the sci-fi horror film’s sequel. Although plot details are still being kept under wraps, producer James Wan hinted that M3GAN 2.0 will pick up from the end of the first film and explore the consequences of what happens when AI robots connect to devices in people’s homes. Allison Williams and Violet McGraw are confirmed to star as Gemma and Cady again.\n\nF1 (2025)\n\nRelease Date: June 27, 2025\n\nDirector: Joseph Kosinski\n\nStarring: Brad Pitt, Damson Idris, Javier Bardem, Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies, Shea Whigham\n\nWarner Bros., Apple Original Films, and Dawn Apollo Entertainment, led by seven-time Formula One World Champion Lewis Hamilton, are revving up their engines to transport audiences into the world of F1 racing. The upcoming film features an all-star, hardware-heavy ensemble with the likes of Brad Pitt, Damson Idris, Kerry Condon, Javier Bardem, and Tobias Menzies. Directed by Joseph Kosinski, known for blockbusters like Tron: Legacy and Top Gun: Maverick, the picture follows Pitt as a former racer who is persuaded to come out of retirement to mentor a new driving prodigy (Idris). The film was shot during actual Grand Prix weekends and is being developed with input from the Formula 1 community and its race promoters.\n\nJULY\n\nJurassic World 4 (2025)\n\nRelease Date: July 2, 2025\n\nDirector: Gareth Edwards\n\nStarring: Scarlett Johanson, Mahershala Ali, Jonathan Bailey, Rupert Friend, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo\n\nThe larger-than-life dinosaur phenomenon that is the Jurassic franchise is returning to screens with new life. Though uncovering any plot details has been about as difficult as unearthing dino fossils, the latest installment is executive produced by Steven Spielberg, and it features an all-star ensemble that includes Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali, and Jonathan Bailey. Gareth Edwards of Godzilla (2014) directs, and David Koepp, who penned the original Jurassic Park, returns as a writer on the new film.\n\nSuperman (2025)\n\nRelease Date: July 11, 2025\n\nDirector: James Gunn\n\nStarring: David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, Nathan Fillion, Isabela Merced, Edi Gathegi, Anthony Carrigan, Nicholas Hoult\n\nDC Studios CEO James Gunn is directing, writing, and producing the latest reboot of Superman, bringing it into the new generation of a connected DC Cinematic Universe. The film will not be an origin story, but will focus on Lois Lane and Clark Kent. To the dismay of many Superman fans, Henry Cavill will not be returning to play the superhero — instead, David Corenswet will take on the role, playing a younger, more optimistic Superman to counter Cavill’s grittier rendition.\n\n(Photo by ©Marvel Studios)\n\nThe Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025)\n\nRelease Date: July 25, 2025\n\nDirector: Matt Shakman\n\nStarring: Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Joseph Quinn\n\nThe Fantastic Four are coming back for a third time, 20 years after the initial theatrical debut of Marvel’s First Family and 10 years after the ill-fated reboot. This iteration joins the MCU as part of the Multiverse Saga, skipping the team’s origin story and setting up future crossover events, potentially into the next Avengers movie. Not much else is known about the film, except the main cast: Pedro Pascal plays Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby plays Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn plays Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach plays Ben Grimm, while WandaVision and Monarch: Legacy of Monsters director Matt Shakman takes the helm.\n\nAUGUST\n\nThe Bad Guys 2 (2025)\n\nRelease Date: August 1, 2025\n\nDirector: Pierre Perifel\n\nStarring: Sam Rockwell, Marc Maron, Craig Robinson, Anthony Ramos, Awkwafina, Zazie Beetz\n\nConsidering The Bad Guys (2022) saw huge commercial success at the box office and on streaming, it’s no surprise that Dreamworks and Universal are doing a sequel. This time around, the Bad Guys grapple with crime-free life as Good Guys when they are confronted by an all-female squad of criminals who prompt them out of retirement for a final hurrah. Mr. Wolf (Sam Rockwell), Mr. Snake (Marc Maron), Mr. Shark (Craig Robinson), Mr. Piranha (Anthony Ramos), and Ms. Tarantula (Awkwafina) will all reprise their roles as the main cast with Pierre Perifel returning to direct and Damon Ramos producing.\n\nUntitled Paul Thomas Anderson Movie (2025)\n\nRelease Date: August 8, 2025\n\nDirector: Paul Thomas Anderson\n\nStarring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn, Regina Hall, Teyana Taylor, Wood Harris, Alana Haim, Chase Infiniti\n\nDirected, written, and produced by Paul Thomas Anderson, this untitled film will be his 10th narrative feature and the first to be released in IMAX. Not much else is known besides its all-star cast. Since Anderson’s breakout feature Boogie Nights, he has collected 11 total Oscar nominations as a producer, writer, and director, but he’s never won, and who knows, perhaps this will be the title that brings home the hardware.\n\nAnimal Friends (2025)\n\nRelease Date: August 15, 2025\n\nDirector: Peter Atencio\n\nStarring: Ryan Reynolds, Aubrey Plaza, Jason Momoa, Vince Vaughn, Dan Levy, Addison Rae\n\nWe don’t know much about the plot of this film, but we do know that it’s directed by Peter Atencio (Keanu, The Machine) and it’s a live-action/animated hybrid starring the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Aubrey Plaza, and Jason Momoa, among others. There are also presumably going to be animated animals involved, but we don’t yet know who will appear as themselves in the film, and who will be voicing animated characters.\n\nThread: An Insidious Tale (2025)\n\nRelease Date: August 29, 2025\n\nDirector: Jeremy Slater\n\nStarring: Mandy Moore, Kumail Nanjiani\n\nMandy Moore and Kumail Nanjiani are slated to star in the sixth installment of Blumhouse’s horror franchise Insidious. Garnering a collective $750 million in box office revenue worldwide, the Insidious movies center on otherworldly beings that seek to terrorize the world of the living, often resulting in gut-wrenching ramifications. Beginning in 2010, the film series has gained a cult-like following with the most recent installment, Insidious: The Red Door (2023), scoring $189M worldwide at the box office.\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\nSaw XI (2024)\n\nRelease Date: September 26, 2025\n\nDirector: Kevin Greutert\n\nStarring: TBA\n\nNot only did 2023’s Saw X bring Tobin Bell’s John Kramer back, the prequel also managed to earn the best reviews of the franchise by a wide margin. Originally scheduled for a September, 2024 release, Saw XI was rumored to pick up where Saw X left off, at least according to producer Oren Koules. We don’t know if that’s still the case, but we do know that Kevin Greutert will return to direct and try to achieve the same success he managed with the last film.\n\nOCTOBER\n\nThe Bride!

In this new installment of the iconic sci-fi series, Ares (Jared Leto) plays a highly sophisticated A.I. computer program that crosses over into the human world on a dangerous mission.

Ali’s voice as Eric Brooks has already made an appearance in the post-credits scene of 2021’s Eternals, hinting a possible connection between the two films.

Directed by Ruben Fleischer, the Lionsgate film will see a mid-November 2025 release.\n\n(Photo by ©Universal Pictures)\n\nWicked: Part Two (2025)\n\nRelease Date: November 26, 2025\n\nDirector: John M.
