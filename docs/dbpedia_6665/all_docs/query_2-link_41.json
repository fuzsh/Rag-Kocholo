        "text": "Slim Dusty (born June 13, 1927, Kempsey, New South Wales, Australia—died September 19, 2003, Sydney, Australia) was an Australian country music singer and songwriter who epitomized an idealized image of rural Australia—a working stockman with his trademark cowboy hat, acoustic guitar, and vast repertoire of Aussie “bush ballads”—and came to be regarded as a cultural icon.\n\nHe grew up on a dairy ranch, wrote his first song, “The Way the Cowboy Dies,” at age 10, and took the stage name Slim Dusty a year later. He began singing on the radio with then partner Shorty Ranger in 1940. Slim Dusty recorded his first record, the patriotic “Song for the Aussies” (with “My Final Song” on the B-side), in 1942 and signed his first recording contract in 1946. He continued to work part-time as a ranch stockman until 1954, when he formed a full-time traveling show with his wife and other family members.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz"
