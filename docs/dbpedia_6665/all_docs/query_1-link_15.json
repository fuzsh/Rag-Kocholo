        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: After impressing with his half-hour set in Season 3 of Netflix‘s The Standups, the Nashville-based comedian Dusty Slay has secured his first hour with the streamer, setting a January 16th premiere date for his new special, Workin’ Man.\n\nA former pesticide salesman who started out as a comic in 2008, Slay is known for his irreverent though fairly clean material centered on the blue collar Southern experience. Voted Best Local Comedian and winning the Charleston Stand Up Comedy Competition two years in a row, while honing his craft in Charleston, South Carolina, he went on to become the youngest comic to play Nashville’s Grand Ole Opry when he made his debut, and currently boasts a TikTok following of nearly half a million.\n\nPart of a new wave of comics bringing the South to the forefront once again, Slay has put in numerous late night appearances and has also previously put out an acclaimed set on Comedy Central Stand-Up Featuring.\n\nFilmed at Knoxville’s Bijou Theatre on May 13, Workin’ Man was executive produced by Slay, Judi Marmel and Matt Beales, with Jordan Levy serving as co-executive producer.\n\n“At the end of the day, I hope my comedy is relatable,” said Slay in a statement on his new hour. “I talk about things that I go through and what’s going on in my life. Workin’ Man is the culmination of a lot of those experiences, and I hope it’s a break for all the folks that work hard, yet can still laugh about the things that life throws at ’em.”\n\nIn support of his new special, Slay is preparing to go out on his 35-show “The Night Shift Tour,” which kicks off in Spokane, WA on January 4th. Tickets are on sale now at his website.
