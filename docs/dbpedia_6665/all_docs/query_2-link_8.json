        "text": "Is your home feeling dirtier than usual or are your allergies acting up? Are you left wondering why your house is so dusty? While the culprit could be something as simple as leaving the windows open or perhaps road work or construction right outside your door—there are many causes of dust you’re probably not thinking about. Keep reading to learn more about why your house gets dusty and what you can do to reduce that unpleasant film around your home.\n\nCommon Causes of Dust\n\nDust is an accumulation of pollen, dead skin cells, pet dander, mold, bacteria, dust mite droppings, and other particles. Outside air can add to indoor dust in your home, too. Soil, sand, chemicals, and germs can enter your home from cracks in the doors and windows or from your clothes, shoes, and pets.\n\nWhile dusting is an easy chore to forget, a buildup of dust on surfaces can make your home look dirtier and affect your overall air quality and well-being. According to allergist Sonia Cajigal, M.D., there are quite a few hidden sources of dust in every home, but below are some of the most common examples.\n\nPoor Airflow\n\nA buildup of dust in your home is often the result of poor airflow. Combined with infrequent cleaning, poor airflow can lead dust and dust mites to settle comfortably into several areas in your home. Make sure your HVAC system is running properly and consider running ceiling fans to help air circulate.\n\nSoiled Upholstery\n\nIf you don’t have allergy encasings for mattresses and pillows, you may want to consider purchasing some. “Dust mites live in mattresses, pillows, and upholstery,” says Cajigal. Using allergy covers can prevent new dust mites from settling into these areas and irritating those with allergies and asthma.\n\nShyam Joshi, M.D. says that curtains are another common culprit. You may want to invest in non-textile window treatments, such as shutters or blinds, dry-clean your curtains more frequently, or, at the very least, use machine-washable curtains, which are often budget-friendly.\n\nDirty Rugs and Carpeting\n\nCarpeting can be another major source of dust in your home. The fibers in the carpet are a haven for debris and other allergens. While it may be impossible to eliminate carpeting from your home, especially if you're a renter, regularly cleaning carpets and area rugs can help.\n\nUnbathed Pets\n\nThen there are those sources of dust no one wants to come to terms with. “Cats, dogs, and other household pets tend to be a major source of dust,\" Joshi says. \"Keeping them out of areas where dust typically accumulates can reduce dust levels.\" You also may want to consider bathing your furry friends or sending them to the groomer more frequently.\n\nForgetting to Dust Weekly\n\nRemember that dusting doesn't just refer to wiping down dust on hard surfaces. It also includes vacuuming and washing bed sheets regularly. “Ideally, this should be done every week if possible to keep dust and the many allergens it contains at low numbers,” suggests Dr. Joshi.\n\nWhile this might sound daunting, you can always space out these individual tasks. For example, you can wash and change out your sheets every Sunday, vacuum every Friday, and wipe down hard surfaces another day of the week.\n\nHow to Get Rid of Dust in Your House\n\nWith a few simple habits and tweaks, you can substantially decrease the amount of dust that settles in your home. Keep in mind that even when combined, these efforts won’t completely remove dust and dust mites from your home. However, they can decrease your exposure to dust and allergens.\n\nVacuum More Often\n\nOne easy solution to reduce dust is to vacuum more often. If you’re already vacuuming weekly or more, and your vacuum is in good working order, you may need to replace or clean the filter. If your vacuum has a dirt cup, it should be emptied after each use to maximize suction. (If your vacuum is not working properly, consider purchasing a new vacuum.)\n\nChange HVAC Filters\n\nAnother way to get rid of dust is to change the filters in your HVAC system. Whether you have central heat and air or a window unit, if you don’t remember the last time filters were changed, that probably means it's time for a swap. Cajigal suggests putting in new filters every one to three months—set a calendar reminder on your phone to help you remember.\n\nPurchase an Air Purifier\n\nYou may also want to purchase an air purifier to remove dust particles from the air. “Filtration-based air purifiers are a great way to reduce how much dust settles on surfaces and how often you need to clean surfaces,” says Chris Dooley of Puraclenz. Look for air purifiers with a HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter.\n\nSet Up a Humidifier\n\nWhile you're investigating air purifiers, it's worth looking into purchasing a humidifier, too. Low humidity can boost dust levels in your home! (All that dry air makes it easier for dust to spread.)\n\nKeep in mind, though, that too much moisture in the environment will exacerbate any dust mite issues, so finding the right balance is important. Aim to keep your home's humidity between 40% and 50%.\n\nWipe Down Hard Surfaces\n\nYou may need to wipe down hard surfaces to eliminate dust more often. Use a microfiber rag or duster if possible, and always start at the top and work your way down so you don’t push dust onto something you just cleaned. Consider dusting right before vacuuming to avoid letting debris sit on your carpet or floors.\n\nAvoid Rugs\n\nAs mentioned, carpeting can be a huge source of dust. Thick rugs are notorious for trapping dirt and pollen, and because of this, they're not recommended if you struggle with allergies. Regularly vacuuming your carpets and rugs can mitigate debris, but it's best to skip soft floor coverings in the first place if dust is an issue.\n\nClean Upholstery Frequently\n\nTextiles and cushy surfaces practically invite dust, just like rugs, so clean sofas, pillows, and window treatments often. Once a week, use the upholstery brush attachment on your vacuum to get rid of dust and loose soil, then seasonally, run an upholstery cleaner over your soft surfaces. Wash throw pillows and anything else you can toss in the washing machine.\n\nTake Shoes Off Indoors\n\nMany cultures already consider wearing shoes indoors a sign of disrespect, so you may already be enforcing this habit, but leaving shoes at the door is another way to cut back on dust. Shoes transfer lots of debris from the outside, so removing them as soon as you enter your home will literally stop dust and dirt in its tracks. Use a doormat to trap dirt at the entrance, and be sure to clean that often, too.\n\nGroom Your Pet\n\nYour pet is likely a big culprit of fur, dust, and pollen; it's another body, after all, releasing skin cells everywhere. Bathing and combing your pet regularly—ideally outdoors—will help keep dust at bay. However, doing this excessively will also dry out your pet's skin, leading to flaky skin and ultimately, more dust! Consult with your vet to determine the best grooming routine and frequency.\n\nRemove Sources of Dust Mites\n\nIf you or someone in your household has allergies or asthma, the battle doesn't stop at getting rid of dust. While dust mites are microscopic, their body parts and waste can be a potent allergen to those affected, causing sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes, congestion, difficulty breathing, and more."
