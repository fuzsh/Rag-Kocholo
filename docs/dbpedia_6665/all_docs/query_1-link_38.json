        "text": "Here's the Transcript for the film TWISTER, done of course with as few mistakes as humanely possible! Enjoy! SUZANNE\n\nOn a second note, I'd just like to add that the blocking written here is of my own observations, everything else is the work of MICHAEL CRICHTON and ANNE-MARIE MARTIN. There are also references to music from the soundtrack, i.e. (Music starts \"Virtual Reality\")So, without further ado, I give you TWISTER!!!!\n\n\"TWISTER\"\n\n{Screen fades in to an eerie fog, gray clouds swirling across. Haunting music. We see \"Warner Bros. Presents\". The clouds swirl faster. Faster. Faster. Suddenly the word \"Twister\" stumbles into the clouds then are picked up and blown away. Only the impression of the word remains. Then the movie starts. Camera on an oil drill. At bottom of screen: June 1969. Camera on an iron bridge in front of a sunset. A thunderstorm rolls in across the prairie, in the foreground, a fence. We see lighting. Then camera on YOUNG JO'S house. Then inside. Jo's FATHER, is watching the black and white TV, the bottom of the screen flashing: \"Tornado Warning\". We hear the weather announcer: \" .by radar now. There it is. The center of the circle over Kingfisher county, moving northeastward .a little bit earlier .tornado warning continues now, it's been extended officially .\"Camera on the young Jo sleeping. Lighting wakes her up, she clutches a doll. Her dog, Toby, is at the foot of the bed. Her MOTHER comes in.}\n\nMother: Jo? Common'.\n\nJo: What is it, Mommy?\n\nMother: Common' sweetie, let's get up. Common'. It's okay. {She lifts Jo out of bed and down stairs. Toby is left on the bed.}It's okay.\n\n{Dialogue tight together.}\n\nFather: We need to get down to the storm cellar right now.\n\nMother: Okay.\n\nJo: Toby?\n\nFather: Common', take Jo, let's go!\n\nJo: Toby! Mother: Okay, Common' sweetie.\n\nJo: Mommy?\n\nFather: Common', Honey, hurry!\n\nMother: Don't be scared, Jo. Mama's gotcha, Mama's gotcha.\n\nFather: TV. says it's big. Might be an F5.\n\nMother: Okay, we're going to the storm cellar.\n\nJo: Toby? Toby! TOBY!!!! {Toby barks, Jo keeps screaming \"Toby\"}\n\n{They run out of the house, things exploding and falling all around them.}\n\nFather: Hurry, we've got to move! Hand her to me!! Common', let's move!!\n\n{The mother gives Jo to the father, they keep running. They get to the storm cellar, a door in the ground. Camera on Toby. He runs downstairs and out of the house. We hear on the TV the weather man \".....if you don't have a cellar or a basement, go to the center part of your house......\" Camera on the three outside. }\n\nMother: {Watching things explode}AHHH! We're almost there, we're almost there!\n\nFather: Take her, take her! I gotta get the door! Hurry! Let's go! {Father pries open the storm cellar door. They yell at each other to get inside. They do. The father slams the door and closes the latch.}\n\nJo: Daddy, daddy, Toby's still outside!\n\nFather: Common' Toby, common' boy! {He opens door again, Toby jumps inside. He closes latch again.}\n\nJo: It's okay, Toby.\n\n{Mother lights a kerosene lamp. Suddenly, the door begins shaking.}\n\nJo: Daddy!\n\nFather: Grab Jo, honey! {The father goes over to door, pulling the handle toward him keeping the door closed.}Take Jo!\n\n{She does so. It becomes harder and harder for him to keep the door shut. Harder. The strain becomes terrifyingly obvious.}\n\nFather: I can't hold it!!!!! DEAR GOD!!!!!\n\n{He tries harder. The strain is becoming painful.}\n\nFather: OH, GOD!!!!!!I CAN'T HOLD IT DOWN!!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n{Suddenly, the door flies off, pulling the father with it. Screaming, he disappears into the twister. Jo and her mother are screaming in horror. Jo runs forward to the doorway flailing her arms at the now open doorway.}\n\nJo: DADDY!!!!!!! MY DADDYYYYY!!!!!\n\n{Her mother pulls her back. Soon the screams fade away, as the camera fades into early morning. The devastation is sobering. The silence ominous.\n\nCamera to weather satellite. Bottom of screen shows: Present Day. The picture of the earth turns into a weather map in the radar room of the National Severe Storm Laboratory, or NSSL.}\n\nRADIO: At 7:00 a.m. in Oklahoma City, the temperature is 75 degrees. Across the state, skies are partly cloudy, the dryline higher over western Oklahoma. Satellite pictures indicate thunderstorms developing........\n\nMurphy: Bryce, take a look. {Holding a picture to her}Caps are starting to break.\n\nBryce: All the models are forecasting lifted indexes from minus six to minus ten.\n\nMurphy: You know if these cells keep building like this we could have a record outbreak of tornadoes.{Eats a doughnut.}\n\nBryce :This is gonna be a long day.\n\n{Energetic bluegrass music starts. Camera on a red Dodge Ram truck bouncing down a dirt road between fields of wheat and an occasional oil drill. A crop duster flies over. Inside is BILL HARDING, and his fianc√©, MELISSA.}\n\nMelissa: Um, honey, are you sure she's gonna be here?\n\nBill: If I know Jo, she's already dragged her entire department into the field. Ah, hell, a day like today, it's to be expected. She forgets everything except her work.\n\nMelissa: You're nervous about seeing her, aren't you?\n\nBill: Nervous? No. Why, do I look nervous?\n\nMelissa: No. Well, yeah you do, a little.\n\nBill: I just want to get it over with.\n\nMelissa: But she said she signed the papers, right?\n\nBill: That's what she said. Melissa: You don't think so?\n\nBill: No, I think so. Give me a kiss. {They kiss. Camera over to JO HARDING, now grown up, on top of a blue van, wiring the Doppler radar. With her on her team are: DUSTY, RABBIT, BELTZER, HAYNES, SANDERS, LAURENCE, PREACHER, and JOEY. We hear music in background {Start music (\"Talula\")}.\n\nBeltzer:{Inside Van, tapping on roof}Okay professor, hang on there, I think I fixed it. I've got it. {Jo tries turning on the Doppler radar dish, sparks fly}. Oops.\n\nJo:{Frustrated}Oh, fuck! This thing is useless!\n\nBeltzer: Sorry, Jo. {Suddenly it works.}\n\nJo: Wait, wait, wait. Beltzer!{Bangs roof with foot}That's good. Give me a reading!\n\nBeltzer:{Getting out of van}Okay , boss lady, hold your horses.{Goes over to a lap top connected to the Doppler}Which way do you want it, Jo?\n\nJo: Looks like the dryline has stalled. Give me a sector scan west, northwest, look at mid-levels for rotation and increase the PRF.\n\n{Camera over to Dusty. He's in his bus, watching music videos along with the weather forecasts, singing the songs, and broadcasting them outside through a speaker on the roof.}\n\nDusty:{Singing}If I mistreat you girl, sho' don't mean no harm.....\n\n{Camera over to Rabbit and Laurence}\n\nRabbit: All I'm saying is don't fold the maps!\n\nLaurence: I didn't fold the map!\n\nRabbit: Yeah, well Kansas is a mess, there's a big crease right through Wichita-{Demonstrating}Roll the maps.\n\n{Bill and Melissa drive up.}\n\nBill: What do you know, the storm chasers. {Gets out of truck. Dusty, Rabbit, and Sanders run up.}\n\nRabbit: Hey, I don't believe it! Who is that handsome devil!\n\nBill: Gentleman.\n\nDusty:{Goofy, Playful}The Extreme! IT'S THE EXTREME!! {Laughs}\n\nBill: Oh man, don't start that shit!{Also laughs}\n\nDusty: Oh manly hand shakin' Zeus. How you doin', man?\n\nBill: Doin' great, doin' great.\n\nDusty:{Still laughing}Oh bad!\n\nBill: Dusty, I'd like you to meet Melissa. {She walks over}Melissa, this is Dusty. Dustman's been chasing with us ever since we started. {They shake hands.}Listen man, where's Jo?\n\nDusty: She's over by Doppler. Broke down again, running out of grant money.\n\nBill:{To Melissa}Honey, why don't you hang out here for a little while, I'll-- I'll be right back.\n\nMelissa: Okay.\n\n{Start music (\"Darlin' Pretty\")}\n\nBill: Dusty, why don't you explain to Melissa.......why you are the way you are! {They exchange ridiculous faces and laugh.}\n\nDusty: {Dusty takes Melissa's hand.}Come on. Man. Jo's gonna wig when she sees he's back. {Bill walks over to where Jo is, however being stopped by everyone else. Bill's come back!}\n\nBill:{Hearing Dusty's comment}I'm not back.\n\nPreacher: {Coming up to Bill}The prodigal son returns!\n\n{Bill walks by. He passes by Joey, who's holding a weather instrument and writing down data on a clipboard. Bill pats his shoulder.}\n\nBill: Hiya, Joey.\n\nJoey:{Surprised}Hey, Bill.\n\n{Bill walks up to the van. There's a rumble of thunder. Jo is standing on the top.}\n\nBill:{Looking up at her}Hiya, Jo.\n\nJo:{Not a bit surprised}Hey, Bill. I'm happy you found us.\n\nBill: How you doin'?\n\nJo:{Looks at Bill, then at sky}It's goin' good. You see the sky today?\n\nBill: Yeah, she's, uh,- she's really talking.\n\nJo:{Tossing him a cord}Catch.{Bill gives Jo an annoyed look as Jo jumps off the van.}It's the biggest series of storms in 12 years. One lined up right after another. And NSSL says they've never seen anything like it.\n\nBill:{Not really interested in what Jo is saying}Is that right? So, Jo, about the divorce papers-\n\nLaurence: Hey, Jo? Come here a second!\n\nJo: Oops.{She goes over to Laurence.}\n\nBill: Oh. Yeah, yeah sure. {Annoyed that Jo's barely listening to him.}\n\n{As Bill walks by, he gets noticed again.}\n\nBeltzer: Hi, Bill.\n\nHaynes: Hey, Bill!\n\nBill: Hey.\n\nLaurence:{To Jo, holding a camera}Hey, you know, this thing's acting up again, this thing-\n\nJo: Focus mount's jammed. There's grass in the auto-focus, did you check this? You have to check it. {Blows grass out.}\n\nLaurence: I'll check it- you want me to clean it out?\n\nJo: Not unless you want to sketch the tornadoes. {Going back to lap top.}\n\nLaurence: Hey, welcome back, Bill.\n\nBill: I'm not back.\n\nJo:{Wiring the lap top while talking}So, you want the papers?\n\nBill: I did drive all the way out here for them.\n\nJo: They're signed and ready.\n\nBill: Good, good. Let's see them.\n\nJo: What, you need 'em right this second?\n\nBill: Well, It'd be nice.\n\nJo: What's the urgent urgency, you act like you're getting married-\n\nBill: I am.\n\nJo:{Startled. She almost seems upset, but she's good at hiding feelings}Wow.\n\nBill: Yeah.\n\nJo:{Going to her truck for papers}Is it Melinda?\n\nBill:{Correcting}Melissa.\n\nJo:{To herself}Melissa.{To Bill}Wasn't there a Melinda in there somewhere?\n\nBill: No, there's only been Melissa since you.\n\nJo: Boy, not much for browsing, are you? {Grabs the papers out of her glove compartment}\n\nBill: No, I guess I'm not.\n\nJo:{Handing him papers}There you go.\n\nBill: Thank you. {Bill promptly flips through them to make sure they're all signed. We see Jo put her graduation ring over her wedding ring, a symbolical way for her to feel like she's still married.}\n\nBill: Whoa, whoa, whoa. You missed a page.\n\nJo:{Acting surprised}What?\n\nBill:{Pointing to the last page}Right here.\n\n{She takes the papers, pretending she's never seen this part before. It's obvious she purposely didn't sign the last page, maybe to keep Bill around longer, also keeping the divorce from being final.}\n\nJo: Where'd this come from?\n\n{She reads the last page, hunched over the hood of the car.}\n\nBill: What are you doing?\n\nJo: Can I read it first?\n\nBill: No! It's the same as it was in December.\n\nJo:{Lying}I didn't read it in December.\n\nBill: Christ, would you just sign it so we can get out of here? Please?\n\n{Start music (\"Twisted\")}\n\nJo: We? She's here?\n\nBill: Yes, she's here, she's over with Dusty. Now would you please sign the document?\n\nJo:{Using the situation to deviate}You left her with Dusty? {Joking}What's the matter with you?\n\n{She leaves the papers on the hood of the car, and walks away.}\n\nBill: What are you doing?\n\nJo: I want to meet her.\n\nBill: No you don't.{Bill runs back to get the papers, frustrated}Christ.\n\n{Camera over to Dusty and Melissa. They're sitting under a beach umbrella in folding chairs.}\n\nDusty: The suck zone- it's the point- basically at which the twister sucks you up, but it's not that technical therefore obviously, but-\n\nJo:{Walks up to Melissa}Hi. {She's being overly polite}I'm Jo Harding.\n\nMelissa:{Getting up}Oh, hello, nice to meet you. {They shake hands}\n\nJo:{Sickened by Melissa but once again hiding it}Bill just told me the happy news.\n\nMelissa: Which?\n\nBill: Us, marriage. {Introducing}Jo, Melissa.\n\nJo: It's happy news.\n\nMelissa: I guess, uh, it probably seems kind of sudden.\n\nJo:{Her annoyance surfacing}Seems sudden?\n\nDusty: Dude, you takin' the vows? That's sweet!\n\nMelissa: Well, we- we just wanted to get it done before Billy started his new job.\n\nJo: That's right, that's right, right, right, right. Weatherman!\n\nBill:{Offended}What?\n\nJo:{Innocently}What?\n\nBill: Say it.\n\nJo: I said weatherman, I think it's great.\n\nBill: How come you had that tone?\n\nJo: There was no tone if you have a problem being a weatherman.\n\nBill:{Argumentative}I don't have a problem being a weatherman.\n\n{Then, Melissa's cellular phone rings. She fishes through her purse to get it, then answers.}\n\nMelissa: Excuse me.{Into Phone}Dr. Melissa Reeves here? Uh-huh?\n\nJo: Just wanted to say hello. Melissa:{To Jo}Hello. Jo: Very nice to meet you. Melissa:{To Phone}Uh-huh.{To Jo}You too. {Melissa makes a signal to Bill if Jo's signed the papers yet.}\n\nBill:{Loud whisper}What? {Sees her signal}No!\n\nJo:{Over by Bill's truck}New truck?\n\nBill: That's right.\n\nJo: Boy oh boy. New job, new truck, new wife......{Sarcastically}It's like a whole new you!\n\nBill: Jo.....\n\nJo: This is very awkward.\n\nBill: I know, tell me about it.\n\nJo: I thought you'd be coming out here alone.\n\nBill: I wasn't expecting on coming out here at all you said you meet me-\n\nJo: It's about Dorothy.\n\nBill: Dorothy? What about her?\n\nJo: She's here.\n\nBill: Show me.\n\n{Going to the back of her truck, Jo rips off the burlap cover over Dorothy; a tornado instrument pack. Bill stands in awe.}\n\nBill: I can't believe you did it.\n\nJo: We built four of 'em.\n\nBill: She work?\n\n{Jo smiles and lowers the tailgate. Bill climbs up and examines the instrument.}\n\nJo: Thought you'd want to be here for her first time out. It wouldn't be right if you weren't here.\n\n{The whole team is coming over. Start music, (\"Melancholy Mechanics\")}\n\nJoey:{Laughing}This is gonna be good!\n\nDusty:{Bringing Melissa over to the truck, referring to Dorothy} How sweet is that? Bill's concept man. Boom! The extreme. Man, it came from his brain.\n\nBill: I had a hand in it.\n\nMelissa: Wow, it is great.{Pause} What is it?\n\nBill: It's an instrument pack for studying tornadoes. First one in history.\n\nJo:{Explaining}It's very exciting. Scientists have been studying tornadoes for ever, but still, nobody knows how a tornado works. We have no idea what's going on inside because no one's ever been able to take scientific measurements from inside the funnel. That's what she's gonna do.\n\nMelissa: How?\n\nJo: We put her up inside a tornado. She opens up, {Demonstrating by opening the lid on Dorothy}and releases hundreds of these sensors {Hands one to her.}that measure all parts of the tornado simultaneously.\n\nBill: You see, Melissa, it's like this. These sensors go up the funnel, and radio back information about the internal structure, wind velocities, flow, asymmetry. We could learn more in 30 seconds than we have in the past 30 years. Get a profile of a tornado for the first time.\n\nMelissa: And what will that do?\n\nBill: If we knew how a tornado really worked, we could design an advance warning system.\n\nMelissa: Aren't there already tornado warnings?\n\nBill: Well the-\n\nJo: They're not good enough, they're nowhere near good enough. Right now, it's 3 minutes. If we can get this new information, we can increase warning time to 15 minutes.\n\nBill: Give people a chance to get to safety. At least that's what these guys are trying to do!{The team yells and cheers. Bill jumps down.Others help Jo down.}I can't believe you actually did it.\n\nJo: Well, we{referring to the team}did it.\n\nMelissa: How do you get it in the tornado?\n\nBill: Well, you got to get in front of the tornado and put it in the damage path. And then get out again before it picks you up too.\n\n{Melissa has a concerned look}\n\nDusty:{In Melissa's ear}It's the suck zone!\n\nMelissa:{Startled by Dusty}Ohh.\n\n{In the mean time, Haynes has been on the phone with the weather beaurau.}\n\nHaynes: Excellent!{Hangs up phone, excited, talking fast}Jo, we got major action! The NSSL says the caps are breaking, the tower's going up to 30 miles up the dryline!\n\n{Jo looks up at the sky, music soaring in the background. She pauses. Then suddenly focuses, slamming the tailgate.}\n\nJo: All right, let's go!!\n\nDusty: All right, we're movin'!\n\nBeltzer: It's fatty time!\n\n{Everyone scrambles to pack everything back in they're trucks.}\n\nHaynes: Jo, we got it!\n\nBeltzer: Rabbit, you're up. Let's go, let's go. Hurry up, we haven't got all day, let's go! {Everyone is throwing stuff into cars}\n\nBeltzer: Joey, Haynes, a little help? {Throws Doppler in the van}\n\nJoey: Yes, sir. Right behind you.\n\n{Dusty is tossing all his beach stuff in his bus, Joey and Haynes give a \"mutual fingersnap\"}\n\nJoey: {To Haynes} Smooth!\n\nHaynes: {Searching for whatever she hasn't packed) Where is it? There it is!\n\nRabbit: Common' Dusty, you're always the last one to go!\n\nHaynes: All right, Beltzer. Preacher, follow!\n\nJo: Laurence, don't forget the camera!\n\nLaurence: I got it, I got it!\n\nBill:{To Melissa}They can handle this, they know what they're doing. I mean, well, this is what they do, they live for this.\n\nMelissa: Uh-huh.\n\nBeltzer: Dorothy 2 and 3 ready!\n\nHaynes: Dorothy 4 ready!\n\nMelissa: Are you sure you don't want to go along?\n\nBill: No. Oh, with them you mean?\n\nMelissa: Well, yeah.\n\nBill: No, they'll be fine.\n\n{All are now in cars. Jo drives in front honking horn as she passes Bill and Melissa} Melissa: Did she sign the papers?\n\nBill: Oh, shit!\n\nMelissa: She didn't?\n\nBill: Common', if we hurry we can still catch them!\n\n{They run to their truck, get it and follow the team.}\n\nRabbit: HEY BILL!!!! GLAD YOU'RE BACK!!!!\n\nBill: I'M NOT BACK!!!!!!\n\n{Music is fast paced. Most conversation is now on CB radio}\n\nJo:{Into radio}Rabbit!\n\nRabbit:{Into radio}Yeah, boss?\n\nJo:{Into radio}Can we do better than the 30?\n\nRabbit:{Looking at map}No. Not for a while. It's best to stay on it until we pass Rogers creek.\n\nJo:{Into radio}Copy that.\n\n{Camera to Bill's truck}\n\nBill: Once we catch up with them, you take the truck and head home. I'll get the papers signed and see you tonight. Okay?\n\nMelissa: No! You know what honey, I find this kind of interesting. I'm gonna tag along!\n\n{Music becomes louder as camera goes into aerial view of all the trucks in Jo's caravan race down the Oklahoma highway. Then we see another caravan. Six black Windstar vans pull up along side Jo's group. It's JONAS MILLER and his crew.}\n\nBill: Jonas! Son of a bitch!\n\nMelissa: Who is that, honey?\n\nBill: Jonas Miller. He's a nightcrawler. {He pulls alongside Jonas' window, they both nod their heads, acknowledging each other}We all started out in the same lab, but Jonas went out and got himself some corporate sponsors. He's in it for the money, not the science. He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets, but he's got no instincts. And he doesn't have Dorothy.\n\n{In Jo's truck}\n\nBeltzer:{Over radio}Jo, I think we got fleas!{Referring to Jonas' crew}\n\nBill:{Over radio}Jo, come back!\n\nJo:{Into radio}Hey there, you change your mind?\n\nBill: Yeah, what's Jonas doin' here?\n\n{Jo looks out side view mirror, sees black Windstars}\n\nJo:{Into radio}I'm not sure. But I bet he's asking himself the same question about you.\n\n{Suddenly, a Windstar swerves toward Bill, driving his truck off the road.}\n\nBill: Oh, shit, hold on! Damn son of a bitch!\n\n{Bill now has a flat tire. Camera to an Auto Repair shop. Bill pulls the flat tire out of the back seat, handing it to AUTO-TECHNICIAN. Dusty walks along the road as a car passes}\n\nDusty: {to the driver passing by} Hey!\n\nBill: How long do you think it'll take to fix?\n\nAuto-Tech: Oh, maybe 10 minutes, 15 tops.\n\nBill: Sounds good.\n\n{We hear Jonas' voice from across the street, with his crew: TONY, EDDIE, FLANDERS, PATTY, CHARLES, DEAN, and JAKE. Apparently, he's got the news reporters around him.}\n\nJonas: What drives me is the unknown. What if we could predict a tornado's path? How many lives would be spared with the creation of an early warning system? {He pulls out a large weather instrument}And D.O.T. 3 is the answer! The first digital orthographic telemeter. And inside, she holds hundreds of these little sensors.{Holds one up}Which when released into the tornado, will transmit back data on wind speed, pressure, and dew point temperature.\n\n{Bill stares in horrid realization: Jonas has stolen he and Jo's idea! He gets pissed. Jo notices}\n\nJo: Bill?\n\nBill: Why didn't you tell me?{He runs toward Jonas}\n\nJo: Bill, don't-\n\nJonas:{Still going}Which will soon be the center of all study-{Bill grabs Jonas' collar, pushing him against his van}Hey! Hey!\n\nBill: You stole my design, you son of a bitch! What you think, I wasn't gonna find out about this?\n\nJonas: Hey, guys, can you get this loser off me?\n\n{Jo's team runs over, pulling Bill away}\n\nDusty:{To Bill}Back off! Back off! It's not worth it!\n\nJonas:{To Bill also}What is the matter with you?\n\nBill: You stole my design, you son of a bitch!\n\nRabbit: Calm down!\n\nJonas: What the hell you talkin' about?!\n\nBill: Dorothy! You took her, you damn thief!\n\nJonas:{Smug}Oh I get it. You want to take credit for my design. Is that it?\n\nBill:{Sincere}You're a liar. She was our idea and you know it.\n\nJonas: Unrealized idea, unrealized.\n\nBill:{Going at him again}That ain't worth shit!!! {Jo runs over, breaking it up}\n\nJo: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Guys, guys. All my guys, get a grip on yourselves. {Now smug also}We both know he'll never get that thing up in the air.\n\nBeltzer: That's right!\n\nJonas: Well let me enlighten you people! This baby has satellite comlink. We've got on-board pulse Doppler, we've got NEXRAD real time. Today, we're gonna make history. So stick around. {Jo lifts an eyebrow contemptuously}Cuz' the days of sniffin' the dirt are over.\n\nRabbit: Better than what you sniff.\n\nBill: We'll see who gets their first, pal.\n\nJonas:{Walking away}Oh, and by the way, I really enjoy your weather reports! {Jonas and his crew laugh. Bill trys to get at him again but Dusty and Bouncer hold him back.}\n\nBill: You slime! I ain't through with you yet! Come on! Come here! Come on! Come on! Get your hands off me! I'm all right! O. K!!\n\n{They finally let him go}\n\nJoey: He's a corporate kiss-butt, man!\n\nJo:{To Bill}I'm sorry. I should have told you.\n\nBill: One day. I'll give you one day. Whether she flies or not I'm gone.\n\n{Melissa runs up}\n\nMelissa: Honey, is everything okay?\n\nBill: It's okay, everything's fine.\n\nMelissa: Are you sure?\n\nBill: Yeah, yeah, yeah, everything's okay.\n\nMelissa: Okay.\n\nBill: Listen, I'm gonna hang out here and get some air. Why don't you get us some cold drinks.\n\nMelissa: Okay, sweetheart.\n\nBill: Okay.\n\n{Bill looks out at the sky. It's been said storm chasers have a sixth sense, and as Bill sifts a hand full of dirt, he lets nature embody his mind. Camera inside the diner across the street from the Auto repair. Start music (\"Virtual Reality\")}\n\nJonas:{To Jo, both standing}You know, Jo, I don't know what the matter is with Bill. I mean, he's wacko, he's crazy!{Jo pretends to be deeply concerned with what Jonas is telling her}You ought to keep a leash on him.\n\nJo: He's not my problem, he's yours.\n\nJonas: Oh, by the way, this storm's going to be a lot bigger than we anticipated. I got reports of mesos all the way from Grand County to Logan.\n\nJo: You sharing information with me?\n\nJonas: No, I was just curious as to which way you were going to head.\n\nJo: Southeast, I think........to the counter. {She walks over to the counter, sitting down by Melissa.}\n\nMelissa:{To WAITRESS}Two lemonades to go, please.\n\nJo: Nothing changes.\n\nMelissa: Pardon me?\n\nJo: He's gonna wait and see what Bill does.{To Waitress}Can I have a coffee to go, please.\n\nMelissa: That man's waiting for Billy?

I know my way home.\n\n{She walks away, by herself}\n\nRabbit: We can be in Wakita in about an hour. Bill, common'!!!\n\n{We see them get in their trucks. Camera then goes to Wakita. The \"Welcome to Wakita\" sign is flapping in the breeze on the ground. Everything is destroyed. We see bonfires in the streets, babies crying, families picking through wreckage. They are too late.}\n\nBill: Oh my God.\n\nJo:{Sad, almost mad at herself, as if it was all her fault}They had no warning. {Like a mirage into the past, Jo sees her mother and father hugging each other and herself, a little girl. This is a heart ripping, all too familiar situation. They see Meg's house. It's been compacted into one story. Strangely, most of the wind sculptures still stand.} Oh my God.\n\n{Jo flies out of the truck, towards the house}\n\nBill: Jo, Wait!!!\n\nJo:{Calling into the upstairs window.}Meg?!!{Bill runs over.}\n\nBill: Jo, wait!!!\n\n{He comes over to where Jo is}\n\nJo: MEG?!!!!!\n\nBill: Careful, this house could go any second.\n\nJo: MEG?!!!\n\nBill: Jo, take a flashlight!\n\n{With a flashlight in hand, they step into the house, now a labyrinth of debris.}\n\nJo: MEG?!!\n\nBill: This house is ready to go.\n\nMEG?!!!\n\n{A dresser topples over as they walk past.}\n\nBill: Careful.\n\nJo: Meg?!!\n\nBill: Meg?!\n\n{Suddenly, they hear a dog whimper}\n\nJo: Shhh! You hear that?\n\nBill: What?\n\nJo: I think I hear something.\n\nBill: Easy does it\n\n{Jo follows the sound. Suddenly they see Meg's dog \"Mose\" below them.}\n\nJo: Meg!!\n\nBill: Mose, boy!\n\nJo: Mose! I think she's down here. Meg? We're here! We're coming down!\n\n{Then, they see Meg. She is trapped under wall framing, her head and chest bleeding.}\n\nBill: Meg!! {To Jo}We gotta get this off of her.{Meg mumbles something} Ready?\n\nJo: {to Meg}Don't move, don't move. {to Bill}Watch her head, watch her head.\n\nBill: Go! {They lift the framing off her.}I got it.\n\nJo: Easy, easy, easy. {to Meg} Are you okay?\n\nMeg: Oh, I'm all right..... I'm fine.\n\n{Suddenly the TV slides toward them, however held back by the cord. They all cover their heads, nothing happens.....}\n\nBill: Get down!\n\nJo: Oh, God\n\nBill: We gotta go, hurry! Let's go! {To Meg}Think you can walk?\n\n{....Suddenly the cord snaps and the TV crashes to the floor!}\n\nBill: Watch out!\n\n{From outside everyone else watches as the house begins to buckle under itself.}\n\nDusty: MEG!!! MEG!! Meg, Bill!!!!{He runs over to the window where Jo and Bill entered.}Some one take my ¬ñ Joey, take my watch.\n\n{He scales the wall to the window}\n\nBeltzer:{To Dusty}Go, go!!! Careful!!\n\nDusty:{About to go in}BILL?!!\n\n{Then Jo and Bill come out, carrying Aunt Meg.}\n\nJo: We're okay, we're coming out!\n\nBill: Get an ambulance over here!\n\nDusty: {Helping Meg also}Get an ambulance, Laurence, Now!!!! Go!!\n\n{Lawrence runs to flag down an ambulance. An ambulance comes over, a paramedic hops out, gets a stretcher, they lay Meg on it.}\n\nJoey: {Also helping}All right.\n\nRabbit: {Helping Meg down}There you go.\n\nMeg: Okay, okay.\n\nBeltzer:{Joking}How 'bout some steak and eggs!\n\n{Meg laughs}\n\nMeg: How nice of you all to come over.\n\n{They're all talking to her. Meg is about to be placed in an ambulance. Her dog, \"Mose \" is still in the collapsed house}\n\nMeg: Bill! Grab Mose for me, I think he's a little shaken up!\n\nBill: Don't worry I'll get him. {Calling}Mose! {Goes back over towards the house}\n\nJo:(To paramedic)Is she okay?\n\nParamedic: We'll probably keep her overnight, just to be safe.\n\nMeg: Overnight? Forget it. I'm all right.\n\nJo: You're going to the hospital.\n\nMeg: Okay, I'll go, but I'm gonna drive myself.\n\nRabbit: Honey, your car is in a tree around the corner.\n\nMeg: Ohhh.\n\nBill: {Calming the dog}It's okay, it's okay.\n\n{Just as Bill comes back with Bows, the house behind him collapses the rest of the way.}\n\nMeg: Ohh!\n\n{Camera over to a TV set in Dusty's van, we see and hear the weather report: \"The F4 that hit Wakita has now moved on to the north-east, I've just gotten word in that an even stronger tornado has now started to form 25 miles south of Wakita, but right now the two storm systems are funneling back, the National Weather Service saying that this is highly unusual and they are saying that this tornado could be the strongest in the state in more than 30 years-\"}\n\nDusty:{Listening}Oh my God. {Motioning Beltzer over.} Look at this, look at this.\n\n{Meg is sitting in the back of the ambulance wearing a wrist brace, and a bandage around the head. Jo walks over.}\n\nMeg: Hey, what're you doin'?\n\nJo: I wanna see how you are.{To paramedic}How is she? {To Meg}I was worried about you.\n\nParamedic: {Answering Jo} All right. {Exit}\n\nJo:{Examining Meg's wrist}Oh, look at this-\n\nMeg:{Quickly}It's nothing. He says I have a bump on the head, and maybe a broken wrist....\n\nJo:Let me see that.{Looking at wrist again}\n\nMeg: There's nothin' to see, it doesn't even hurt.\n\nJo:{Quietly}I'm sorry I wasn't there.\n\nMeg: Stop blaming yourself, you got me out of the house.{Tears begain to stream down Jo's face} Jo, it's gotta stop. I diddn't have any warning. The sirens went off a few seconds before it hit, I didn't even get down the stairs.\n\n{Dusty walks over}\n\nDusty:Jo. I'm sorry, uh, I was listening to the radio, and, I mean, I don't even know if you wanna know, but I, it's happening, the NSSL's predicted an F5.\n\nMeg: Jo, it could of happened to somebody else. You, you go stop it.\n\nJo:{Crying, talking so soft, she can hardly be heard}I don't know how.\n\nMeg: Well, I think you do. You've been chasing these things since you were a little kid. It's what you do. Go. Do it.\n\n{Camera on the ambulance, as it pulls away. Jo is standing facing the house, staring at Meg's wind sculpture. Haynes notices, slapping Joey on the arm and pointing. Bill walks over to her.}\n\nBill: You all right? {No response}I thought you'd go to the hospital with Meg.{She is still standing there, staring}Jo? What is it? {Pause}What is it?\n\n{The sound of wind chimes fills the air, as if a memory, or a thought}\n\nJo: I know how to make Dorothy fly.\n\n{Bill looks at the wind sculpture for a second}\n\nBill:{Knowing what Jo's idea is}Of course. Of Course!\n\nJo: {To crew}All right, I need every aluminum can you can find!\n\nBill: We need cutters and duct tape! Haynes, Beltzer, I want to get the last Dorothys on the back of my truck, and I want everyone working on it.!\n\nDusty: We're gone!!\n\n{Music drums loud and fast as Camera goes into aerial view of Jo's crew skimming across a bridge in front of an Oklahoma sunrise. Camera then goes to half the crew in the back of Beltzer's van, cutting pin-wheel fans out of aluminum cans and screwing them onto the sensors. Camera then goes to the outside. Cars going the other direction honk their horns as an F5 twister spins in the distance.}\n\nJo:{Over radio}Dusty, you ready for us?\n\nDusty: Yeah, yeah, we're good!{Affirming with everyone else in the van}We're good? We're good? Very good!!\n\nBill: Let's go, come on!!!\n\n{They stop the caravan on the highway.}\n\nJo: We get 'em done?\n\nBill: I think so.\n\n{Haynes, Beltzer, Rabbit, and everyone else pulls out boxes of sensors, now with the fans attached. Box, after box, they dump them back into Dorothy 3 and Dorothy 4.}\n\nDusty: Beautiful!\n\nBill:{Closes the lids on the Dorothys.}Okay, okay!\n\nBeltzer: Great job, guys, just be ready to report. Be careful, all right?\n\nJo: Don't follow us close.\n\nJoey: All right, you got it, boss.\n\nRabbit: Okay!\n\nJoey: We're back in business!\n\n{They all hop back into their trucks. Music triumphant and hopeful.}\n\nDusty: Come on, let's go!\n\n{Camera on Jo and Bill}\n\nJo: Half a mile more?\n\nBill: That's sounds right. I figure we'll put it right in the middle of the road.\n\nJo: Unless you think somebody'll hit it.\n\nBill: Nobody'll be there.\n\n{The F5 tornado approaches the road that Jo and Bill are on. They're in Bill's truck, Bill is driving. The roar of the tornado is deafening. Bill stops the car, and Jo and Bill get out. The tornado is on the road, directly in front of them. Bill goes around and he and Jo take Dorothy # 3 out of the back of the truck.}\n\nBill: Hurry! Let's go, common'!!!\n\n{It's sirens are on, they put it out in the road for the tornado to take.}\n\nBill: Okay, that's good!\n\nJo: You got it?\n\nBill: Let's go!\n\n{They get back in the truck, Jo grabs the CB radio}\n\nJo:{Into radio}Dusty, you in position?\n\nDusty:{Over radio}Yeah, we're prime, ready for contact!\n\n{They turn around and get a good distance away, watching}\n\nJo: This is it. Bill: It's gonna work.\n\nJo:{Into radio}Just another minute, Dusty!!!\n\nDusty:{Over radio}We're ready for it!!!\n\n{They watch hopeful, Jo gets out the video camera.

She can still fly!!!!\n\n{Suddenly an uprooted tree tips Dorothy over, and the tornado decides to change direction......towards Jo and Bill.}\n\nJo: Let's go!!!\n\nBill: My God!\n\n{They try to drive away, but the car gets stuck on the uprooted tree in the middle of the road.}\n\nJo: Oh my God....\n\n{Following dialogue delivered one after another}\n\nBill:{About the car}Common'!\n\nJo: Get us off this thing!\n\nBill: Comon'!\n\nJo: Bill, kick it!{the gas pedal}BILL!! Let's go! Right now! Hurry!!!!\n\n{Bill still floorin the gas, trying to get the truck off the tree.}\n\nJo: What is that?!!\n\n{Pause.}\n\nBill: What is that?\n\n{They both see something metallic flying around in the tornado.}\n\nJo: Bill, hurry! HURRY! HURRY!!!!!!\n\n{still unsure, but whatever it is, it's huge}\n\nBill: This is not good!\n\n{Suddenly they see what it is. It is a tank truck! Bill floors it again, no success.}\n\nJo: HURRY!!!\n\n{Bill throws his whole body weight onto the gas pedal...}\n\nBill: Hold On!!!!!\n\n{....Suddenly the car snaps forward as it's nudged by the tank truck coming right at them!}\n\nJo: LET'S GO!!\n\n{Suddenly the tank truck falls to the ground right in front of them, exploding. They drive right through it. Jo holds on to the roof, almost scared.(Well wonders never cease!)}\n\nBill:{To no one in particular}Son of a bitch!\n\nDusty:{Over radio}Jo, Bill, You all right?!! Fact, can you guys hear me? You okay?\n\nJo:{Into radio}We're okay.\n\nDusty: Jo, Bill, did you see that explosion?\n\nJo:{Humorlessly}We saw it.\n\nRabbit:{Over radio}This one, she's still moving northeast on 80, you copy?\n\nBill: This is it. Last one.\n\nJo: Last time.\n\n{Camera to Jonas' crew. With the direction they are headed, they look like they will reach the tornado first.}\n\nFlanders:{Into radio} Mobile Lab to Mobile 1, ground speed still increasing, {Camera on the F5}, the base must be a mile wide, we can't see it anymore! What is your location?\n\nJonas:{Into radio} We're right along side her. She's beautiful. We're getting ready to place, so hold back a bit, prepare to monitor.\n\n{Camera on Jo and Bill. They are looking over in the direction of Jonas' crew.}\n\nBill: They have to be there somewhere.\n\n{Camera on Jonas}\n\nJonas: Okay, path is stable, copy that? Men, this is it! This is the one! Stay sharp back there!\n\n{Camera on Jo and Bill}\n\nBill: They have position. They could make it.\n\nJo: Not unless they anchored the pack. {Into radio}Jonas? This is Jo. Can you hear me?\n\nJonas:{Over radio}Not now, Harding.\n\nJo:{Into radio}Jonas, listen to me. The pack is too light, the twister will toss it before it reaches the core, you have to anchor it.\n\n{Camera to Jonas}\n\nJonas:{Into radio}Oh, sharing valuable information, Jo? {Flatly} I'll consider that, thank you.\n\n{Camera to Jo}\n\nJo:{Into radio}Jonas, listen to me! Don't be a-{Bill looks at her}What? Do you see them?\n\nBill:{Into radio}Jonas, what's your position?\n\nJonas:{Over radio}Oh, howdy, Bill. We are heading northeast running parallel and about to pull ahead of it on the left, why?\n\nBill:{Into radio}Hang back a minute, we've got a pretty good view from back here. She could shift her track, and if she does, she's gonna come right at you! D'you copy?\n\n{Camera to Jonas}\n\nEddie: Maybe we should do what he says. He's never put us in harm's way.\n\nJonas: When I want your opinion, I'll give it to you. Keep your mouth shut, put your foot on the gas, and stay on this heading.\n\nDean:{Over radio}It's unbelievable!\n\nJonas:{Into radio}What is it, what's wrong?\n\nDean:{Over radio}The base is so, huge! It must be at least, a mile wide! Do you copy that, Dr. Miller?\n\n{Camera on Jo and Bill}\n\nBill:{Into radio}Jonas, listen to me. This is not-\n\n{Camera on Jonas}\n\nJonas: Get off this frequency, Bill!! {He switches off the radio}\n\n{Camera on Jo and Bill. They watch the tornado}\n\nJo: She's shifting.\n\nBill: Oh my God. {Into radio}Jonas, I'm telling you . Eddie, I know you can hear me! Turn around now!! Get out of there!!!\n\n{Just as Jo says, the tornado shifts direction and spins over Jonas' crew. Jo and Bill watch as the black Windstars fly through the air. Camera on Jonas. He's in his car screaming}\n\nEddie & Jonas: LOOK OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n{Suddenly a radio tower slams through the windshield, killing Eddie. Camera then on Jo and Bill, as they watches Jonas' car crash and explode. Jo flinches at this. In a fit of rage, Bill throws down the radio mic.}\n\nBill: Damn it!! Stupid.\n\n{He angrily hunches over the steering wheel}\n\nJo: We tried. There's nothing we could do.\n\nBill: Yes there is.\n\nBeltzer:{Over radio}Bill, Jo, ground speed is increasing. Get ahead of it as fast as you can or she's gonna bury ya!\n\n{Jo and Bill are still in the truck, going down a highway, now chasing the F5 twister. Debris starts flying past the truck.}\n\nJo: Debris!!! DUSTY, WE HAVE DEBRIS!!!\n\nBill: DEBRIS?!!\n\n{The debris consists of cars, tractors, road signs. It's falling everywhere. Jo directs Bill as it all falls around them.}\n\nJo: RIGHT!!!!!!\n\n{Bill swerves right.}\n\nJo: LEFT!!!!!!\n\n{Bill swerves left.}\n\nJo: RIGHT!!!!!!\n\n{Bill swerves right.}\n\nJo: LEFT!!!!!!\n\n{Bill swerves left.}\n\nJo:{A tire crosses the windshield} DUCK!!\n\nBill: What now?\n\nJo:{Out of breath}I have no idea.\n\nDusty: {Over radio}Bill, Jo, you still with us?\n\n{Suddenly a house comes rolling along and stops on the road.}\n\nJo: Oh my God.\n\nBill:{Referring to house}I think we're goin' in!!\n\nJo:{Holding onto roof}AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!\n\n{They plunge through the house in their car.}\n\nBill:{After they've popped back out}Maybe we should get off of this road.\n\nJo: I think you may be right.\n\nDusty: Jo, Bill, you all right?\n\nJo: Yes. You guys set up?\n\nDusty: Jo, we're set. Goin' in?\n\nJo: We're goin' in.\n\nBill: You ready?\n\nJo: I'm on it.\n\nBill: Be careful.\n\n{Exciting music in background. She opens the back window of the truck and crawls through. Dorothy # 4 is loaded up in the back, Jo switches it on and crawls back inside.}\n\nJo: She's up.\n\nBill: Okay.\n\n{Camera over to Dusty and crew. Jo and Bill have turned, and are now driving through a cornfield.}\n\nRabbit: Where are they? I can't see 'em!!\n\nHaynes: We're tracking 'em great. The speed's still increasing.\n\nBeltzer: I've never seen anything like this.\n\nDusty: They're gonna punch the core.\n\n{Camera back on Jo and Bill. They are driving in the cornfield, right towards the tornado.}\n\nJo: You ready?\n\nBill: Yeah. Let me just set the cruise control.{He does}Okay we're good.\n\nJo: On three?\n\nBill: On three. Go.\n\n{They open the doors and stand, the truck is still going 50.}\n\nBill: Ready?\n\nJo: Ready!\n\nBill: One.....Two......Three!!\n\n{They jump out of the truck, roll to the ground, get up, then watch the truck continue into the twister.}\n\nJo:{Following truck with her hand}Go. Go. Go!! GO!!GOOOO!!!!\n\n{As the truck and Dorothy are lifted up into the twister, and the sensors fly up into the air, we hear the haunting sound of the windchimes. Celebrative music as Jo and Bill hug.}\n\nJo: Yes! YES!!!\n\n{Camera over to Dusty's crew}\n\nDusty: Dorothy's flying'!!!!!!! Baby, she's flying'!!!!\n\n{All ad-lib, \"Yes\", \"It's Working'\", etc.}\n\nJoey: We're going to be very popular!!\n\nBeltzer:{Looking at Doppler radar and all the data coming in from the sensors.}It's Christmas Time!! Look at that!!\n\nHaynes: Look at these readings!!\n\n{Everyone suddenly grows quiet}\n\nHaynes: You guys, it's about to shift northeast.{The tornado}\n\nDusty:{Into radio, but of course, they're not there}BILL, JO, YOU'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THERE, YOU COPY?!!!!\n\n{Camera over to Jo and Bill. As the twister comes toward them, rows of corn fly up into the air}\n\nBill: Oh no! RUN!!!!!!!!\n\n{Both break off in a dash through the cornfield. They approach a farm with a barn.}\n\nBill: The barn, common'!! Look out!!!\n\n{They run up alongside a picket fence. All the boards are plucked up one by one right behind them. Suddenly, Jo sees an opening in the fence to crawl through.}\n\nJo: BILL, HERE, HERE!!!!! Bill: COME ON, HURRY!!!! {They climb through} TO THE BARN!!!!\n\n{They run to the barn. Fence boards slam and stick in the barn walls. They get inside. Sickles, knives, and saws hang from the ceiling.}\n\nBill: Stay down!!\n\nJo: My God, who are these people?!\n\nBill: I don't think so!! Common'! Let's get out quick!! {They run out of the barn, then duck as the roof of the barn flies over their heads.}Oh my God! Common''! Run for it!!\n\n{ They yell to each other but most of it can't be heard over the wind. They continue to run until they get to pumphouse.}\n\nBill: {the door to the pumphouse won't open}COME ON!!!! {He finally opens it}JO, GET IN!!!!1\n\n{As Jo goes inside, a piece of a roof flies past her. She screams. They go inside. The well is a \"U\" shaped pipe coming up out of the ground.}\n\nBill: Here! These pipes go down at least 30 feet. We anchor to 'em, we might have a chance!\n\nJo:{Grabs rawhide straps}Bill!\n\n{She hands them to him but they break.}\n\nBill: No good. {Sees more} This one! Common', get in!! {Grabs it, ties it first around them, then loops it on to the pipes.}Hold on!!!\n\n{Suddenly the walls and roof are lifted away and only Jo, Bill, and the pipes remain.}\n\nBill: HANG ON!!!!!\n\n{The tornado looms overhead, Jo and Bill are lifted up in the air, however still attached to the pipes. They look up. They are looking at the inside of the tornado! Angelic music fills the air, and Jo is awe struck. They stare up at a light at the top of the twister. Lightning circles around the light. The music crescendos, then resolves as the clouds, the lightning, and the twister blow away. We see a family come up out of a storm cellar, horses galloping away, then the camera goes back to Jo and Bill, sitting under the pipes.}\n\nJo: You all right?\n\nBill:{He nods}Wow, look at that. It didn't take the house.\n\n{Hard rock music (\"Humans Being\") fades in as Dusty's crew approaches.}\n\nJo: We did it.\n\nBill: Yeah, we did. Dorothy really flew.\n\nJo: It was a good idea.\n\nBill: Yeah, well I....\n\nJo:{In realization}We've got so much to do.\n\nBill: Yeah.\n\nJo: I've got to get grant approvals for a new warning system, we need a bigger lab, you've got to do an analysis of all that data....\n\nBill: I do?\n\nJo: Yeah, we've got to generate models out of all this data, and I need to run the lab-\n\nBill: Oh, no, no ,no. You're doing the analysis, I'm running the lab.\n\nJo: You're running the lab? I don't think so!\n\nBill: I'm running the lab! G- Do you always have to do things the hard way?\n\n{Dusty's crew walks over}\n\nHaynes: You got it guys, the sensors worked! The computers went crazy, we've got data coming out of our ears!\n\n{All laugh}\n\nBeltzer: Biggest twister ever recorded!!\n\nDusty: Awesome, man!\n\nSanders: Hey, Jo, Bill, check out that sky!{The sky is clear}\n\nJo: You know what, I think we've seen enough!\n\n{Jo and Bill kiss as the music for the credits come on,(\"Respect The Wind\"), camera goes into aerial view, then credits start. Then fade to clouds in fast forward motion.}"
