        "text": "Only a handful of comedians feel like an immediately classic stand-up when you watch them. There’s just something about them—the way they carry themselves, their jokes (of course), their rapport with the audience—that makes these comics enduring, no matter where they’re at in their career. Dusty Slay achieves this enviable status handily on his first full-length Netflix special, Workin’ Man.\n\nPart of what makes Slay feel so classic is his style—both his manner of dress and his delivery. Slay cuts a distinctive figure with his signature trucker hat, long hair, and big glasses (he even is kind enough to have straight locks so there’s no chance you’ll mix him up with Judah Friedlander). The Alabama-raised comic’s cadence on stage is so very much his own; he manages to both seem completely at ease yet thrumming with nervous energy. He’ll adjust his glasses, play with the mic cord, touch his nose, and rock from foot to foot—habits he references in Workin’ Man—and yet you’re never in any doubt that Slay is a natural up there.\n\nAnd then there’s his catchphrase—not enough people have catchphrases anymore! Maybe because so many of them are shit, but that’s not the case with Slay. Throughout the set he’ll tell the audience “We’re having a good time,”—and he’s goddamn right, we are. I tried to count how many times he repeated this sentence (at least seven) in the special, but gave up because I was too wrapped up in Slay’s comedy. Hell, he even has a podcast called We’re Having a Good Time.\n\nSlay also comes across as timeless in his set, in which he talks about everything under the sun, from how fun it is to smoke inside to the time there was an explosion in his dad’s trash ditch. During most of Workin’ Man, it feels like you’re watching a special that could have come out at any point in the last 40 years (aided in part by the vintage, lo-fi look given to the intro)—and that’s a compliment. Slay’s comedy is solid and relatable, not affixed to any gimmicks or topical bits that age rapidly. The only moments that take you out of this timelessness are some smartphone references and a (very funny) bit about weed getting stronger.\n\nMost vitally, though, Slay is an expert storyteller. It helps that he has plenty of great stories to share, but the way he crafts these tales cannot be underestimated. While he tells them in an off-the-cuff, relaxed way, his anecdotes are almost always neatly packaged, tying in a past element or leaving breadcrumbs for the next bit. It’s a credit to his writing skills that these interwoven stories feel organic rather than overwrought. Slay also adds in little details that elevate bits to the next level; these are often blink-and-you-miss-it moments, which reward a rewatch. It’s utterly delightful. While there’s not much physical comedy in Workin’ Man, when Slay does whip out this tool in his comedy belt, his movements are understated and precise, providing extra texture to a joke that makes it go down a treat (I’m thinking in particular about his impression of a drug dealer giving him marijuana from the palm of his hand).\n\nWatching Workin’ Man, there’s an endearing familiarity to Slay and his set. Be sure to bask in Slay’s frank attitude, unassuming demeanor, and hilarious comedy. You’ll have a good time."
