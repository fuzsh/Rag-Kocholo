        "text": "TAMPA — Over the decades, photography business Golden Triangle Tampa documented moments that became local history. From entertainment like the professional wrestlers who performed here to tragedy like the Sunshine Skyway Bridge collapse, their photographs tell the tales.\n\nSeven decades later, the Golden Triangle might be the oldest photography company in Tampa.\n\n“It’s hard to say for certain,” said Kelly Winterling, who owns the business headquartered in an office in the Garcia Vega Cigar Factory at 3104 N. Armenia Ave. “But we think we are.”\n\nRegardless, 70 years is a feat, she said, and the company has survived and thrived by “adapting to the times.”\n\nThe staff of four still captures moments, but that’s less needed because it’s easier than ever for people to do so themselves. So, the company’s primary focus now is preserving moments through services like photo restoration, converting footage from outdated mediums such as VHS tapes and DVDs to digital files and creating legacy videos that tell the history of a person, family or business.\n\nGolden Triangle Tampa is still around because of Winterling’s desire in January 2022 to take over a family business. The Sellers family founded and ran the company for two generations. It would have closed if Winterling hadn’t stepped in.\n\n“My mom and dad were really good friends with Sam Sellers Jr. all through school ... So, he has known me since birth,” said Winterling, 39. “It’s an honor to keep the company going. It’s such a Tampa staple.”\n\nSam Sellers Sr. came to Tampa, stationed at MacDill Air Force Base, from Alabama In 1953, he opened Golden Triangle near the base, mostly catering to a military clientele. Back then, the business was a photo lab.\n\n“I started there when I was 15 as cheap labor,” laughed Sellers Jr., 65, who helped the business expand by becoming its photographer. “I shot weddings, headshots, took pictures for advertisements for things” like drag racing and boxing.\n\nThe Tampa-based Championship Wrestling from Florida promotion was among their biggest clients. Sellers Jr. snapped profile photographs of the grapplers, which were used on promotion posters.\n\n“Dusty Rhodes, Eddie and Mike Graham, the Brisco brothers, Bob Roop, Dick Slater,” he said. “Name one, and I photographed them.”\n\nThey had contracts with law enforcement agencies to document crime scenes and disasters. That’s how Sellers Jr. photographed the aftermath of Tampa floods brought by around 20 inches of rain in March 1960. And it’s what brought him to the Sunshine Skyway Bridge when a freighter crashed into it on May 9, 1980, causing a 1,200-foot span of the southbound portion to collapse.\n\nGolden Triangle Tampa added photo equipment sales to their resume. When one-hour development emerged, the company was among the first to embrace it, Winterling said.\n\nThe Sellers family expanded to seven locations throughout the Tampa area, including two in downtown Tampa. A Kennedy Boulevard storefront became their sole spot when the company contracted operations.\n\n“The digital craze started affecting the main service of film development around 2008/2009,” Winterling said. “Because Golden Triangle did more than just film developing, they survived, whereas some of their competitors did not.”\n\nWinterling initially began working out of Golden Triangle Tampa’s Kennedy Boulevard storefront in 2017 when she needed a home base for her legacy preservation video company, which makes mini documentaries by filming interviews that are then edited to include photographs that illustrate the story.\n\nShe helped Sellers Jr. add digitizing videos to the company’s repertoire and by 2018 was part of his staff.\n\n“When he retired,” Winterling said, “I became the one to carry it on to the next generation.” She combined the two businesses.\n\nAmong her first decisions was to shutter the equipment sales division.\n\n“Online sales changed everything,” Winterling said. “And the store was 2,400-square-feet, which we didn’t need anymore.”\n\nThey sold it and rented office space in the cigar factory.\n\n“The biggest question I get is ‘What’s next? ... What’s the next change to the business,” Winterling said. “I don’t know. But we will keep changing and morphing with the times to keep staying in business.”"
