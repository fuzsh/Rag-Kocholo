        "text": "I first started watching dramas back when I was 8 years old because ‚ÄúMeteor Garden‚Äù was such a phenomenon. Up to now, I only know one person who never got into the hype and we all still jokingly judge her because of it haha! I watched K-dramas in the same local channel that aired Meteor Garden years after. My love for Asian dramas eventually died and I went on to watch Western shows and I never imagined myself re-entering Dramaland. Not until the local channel that decided to air ‚ÄúMeteor Garden‚Äù two years ago and voila! This is already my third year of watching dramas. Good times, good times.\n\nWhen I wrote my 2015 Year-End Drama Round-Up (part 1 & part 2), some dramas that I‚Äôve watched already were being recommended. It was then that I realized that I never wrote about it here that‚Äôs why they were probably suggesting it. With that, I wrote about the dramas that I watched in my first year of fully getting into this wonderful world called dramaland. A lot of the dramas mentioned are very special in my heart and if only I could have all the time and willpower to write individual reviews on them, I would but the mini-reviews that you will be reading should suffice for now.\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nI have found the luckiest girl in the world. And nope it‚Äôs not who you think, but it‚Äôs none other than this certain Weibo blogger who was able to attend top Taiwanese actress Ruby Lin‚Äôs 40th birthday celebration. Why and how lucky? All of my photos in this post came from her (so all the credits to her!). Before we start with this fangirling galore, let‚Äôs greet Ruby Lin and pause for awhile to think how could she look so youthful at 40?!\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nI‚Äôve been looking forward to writing this ever since I got the idea in my head. In this post, I‚Äôll be writing brief reviews about all the dramas that I watched this year. So this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the dramas were all made in 2015 as the title of this post may have suggested. This is part 1 out of 2 2015 Drama Round-ups that I‚Äôll be writing.\n\nMy year in dramas is pretty colorful which I need to highlight: 1.) I watched a lot of C-dramas more than I intended to 2.) It was my first time to watch a drama while it‚Äôs currently airing 3.) I went beyond my habit of watching C/TW dramas by watching J-dramas (yay!) 4.) It also concerns going beyond my habit: watched a period/wuxia drama for the first time! 5.) I was able to watch some dramas which have been collecting dust in my never-ending plan-to-watch list already haha! and most importantly, 6.) I started blogging about dramas!\n\nI‚Äôll be dividing it into parts: STORY IN A NUTSHELL (without spoilers, I promise!), POSITIVE (+) & NEGATIVE (-) things about it, and my OVERALL RATING.\n\nSo are we ready? üòÄ\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nOne of my favourite things to read on drama blogs are weibo updates! I love how I can get the essence of weibo all sorted out for me with just a click. Today, I would like to share some happiness and so I came up with my own Weibo round-up.\n\nAlex To: Where is my food?!\n\nIt should be illegal to be this cute at 53 years old! Yes, 53, not a typo. Unimaginable, isn‚Äôt it. Continue reading ‚Üí"
