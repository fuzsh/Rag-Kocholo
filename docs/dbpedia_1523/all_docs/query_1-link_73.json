        "text": "More of a reflection than a review. Contains spoilers. Watched the series while ongoing on Youku.\n\nIt is a story so human.\n\nIt is a story which starts off like any other campus drama, a story of youth chasing dreams. A light-hearted romance. Yet at some point, you will find an element in it that you dislike, a decision you disagree with. You realize, it is a story not made of rainbows. It is a story that takes the rough road.\n\nA story full of stumbles. Characters full of flaws.\n\nAnd that’s what makes it stand out.\n\nIt is a story of our human struggle – to overcome our flawed nature as we find our way towards our dreams, towards what makes us, us.\n\nLighter and Princess (2022) is a 36-episode Chinese drama that featured the growing-up journey of three college friends: Li Xun (played by Chen FeiYu), Zhu Yun (played by Zhang JingYi), and Gao JianHong (played by Zhao ZhiWei).\n\nIt is a drama so precise – cut into two segments with almost perfect rhythm and tempo, music on point, cinematography downright picturesque, character design impeccable. Most notably, its plot progression is clear and logical. It consistently revolves around the boldness and rashness of youth to pursue what they want, to give in to emotions, to live in the moment. Many times, this leads to mistakes – some more than others. Then they start growing up. They gradually learn to acknowledge these mistakes. They make efforts to rectify these mistakes. It is a story of growth.\n\nIt is a youth drama with a tinge of darkness that surprisingly holds so much depth.\n\nREFLECTIONS\n\nWatching it reminded me of my favorite memoir, Tuesdays with Morrie, written by Mitch Albom (1997) about his teacher, Morrie Schwartz. It brought to fore several thoughts from the book:\n\n“What’s wrong with being number two?”\n\nThis quote was the most prominent one – it rang in my head throughout the series.\n\nWhy are we so obsessed with being number one?\n\nThis is a question perfectly epitomized in the character of Gao JianHong who struggled in the shadow of genius Li Xun. And his character also embodied the answer: we simply want to be seen. Yet it merits a follow-up question: Is becoming number one the only way for us to feel seen?\n\nHere is a fact of life: There will always be somebody better than us. You may be the smartest in high school but come college, you’d realize you’re just a normal kid; there are people much smarter than you. You may graduate with laurels in college, yet when you enter the industry, you would amount to nothing. You may gain experience and credentials over the years but there are always others who would hold more experience and credentials than you do.\n\nSo why are we so obsessed about it?\n\nTo be seen? By whom? Who do you want to see you?\n\nBut before that, do you even see yourself? Gao JianHong was obsessed with the world to see him better than Li Xun but did not see himself. And this made him prone to stumble.\n\nYou may argue – but isn’t it that we should always strive to be better? You always harp betterment on us.\n\nOf course, we should strive to be better – but this is never in comparison to others. We can use competition as fuel for us to improve, but the preferred comparison is always in relation to our past selves. To strive to be better means to strive to be a better version of ourselves everyday – be it in terms of technical skills or character or any other facet of ourselves. Not to be better than others – somebody will always be better than us – pursuing that path would only lead us to misery (case in point: Gao JianHong, my favorite). And note how we never say “strive to be the best” – we always say “better” because this is a never-ending journey. Reaching number one is immaterial in this journey.\n\nFurther to that, we must ask ourselves, we try to be better for what? Is it for fame? For power? For money? Why do we do what we do? Why do we dream what we dream? What is our why?\n\nI would like to argue that we try to be better so we are closer to fulfill what makes us, us (i.e., what gives us meaning, purpose – this is our why, we all have different why’s). So we are closer to becoming the person we want to be. At the end of the day, life is about creating ourselves. (Not ‘finding’ – we are not pre-designed).\n\nI may have made it sound easy here but it isn’t. It is very much difficult – it takes a lifetime, sometimes that is not even enough.\n\n“Life is a series of pulls back and forth … A tension of opposites, like a pull on the rubber band, and most of us live somewhere in the middle.”\n\nIt is a human struggle – we want to be better, to fulfill our why’s, but our circumstances in life hinder us from doing so. Our emotions get the better of us – hurt, agony, grief, envy, anger, hate.\n\nIt certainly got the better of Gao JianHong and Li Xun. These circumstances and emotions boxed them in that all they could see were these, nothing else. They are absolutely entitled to feel these emotions, as we all are. We are humans, after all. But we are also more than our emotions. Because we are humans – the supposedly rational beings.\n\nYou may have heard me say this many times: Feelings are never within our control. What we can control are our actions.\n\nI am not saying having emotions is wrong. It isn’t. It is part of us, just as the agency of reason is part of us. I am saying it is our flaw when we take these emotions at face value and act upon on it without thinking about it. It very much helps to take a pause why we are feeling this way. Why do we feel happy with our friends, why we dislike somebody, why we feel angry at the world. I would bet it is because something we value, something that matters to us gets either upheld or stomped upon. Feelings give us indication of that. Now, once we understand why we feel what we feel, how do we address that? How do we protect that which we value?\n\nWhat can make us better people are not our feelings. It is our actions in reaction to these circumstances and emotions. It is our decisions that make us.\n\nBetterment is willed; it can only result from action. That is why we also say that love (which betters) is a choice – a rational act. As shown by Zhu Yun to Li Xun, and at the end, Li Xun to Gao JianHong, love is far from effortless; it is very much an act and it is effortful.\n\nSounds like a wrestling match, I say.\n\n“A wrestling match.” Morrie laughs. “Yes, you could describe life that way.”\n\nSo which side wins, I ask?\n\nHe smiles at me, the crinkled eyes, the crooked teeth.\n\n“Love wins. Love always wins.”\n\nThe real victory in life is not in becoming number one. It is in becoming a better person – becoming closer to fulfilling our why’s, to the person we want to be – and love plays a significant factor to it.\n\nThe drama showed us this: how Zhu Yun’s will to better love Li Xun anchored him towards the right path, sacrificed himself no longer, and learned to accept that he was not alone.\n\nHow Li Xun’s love for Hou Ning pulled the latter up and helped him be more productive with his skills without risking a return trip to jail.\n\nHow Ren Di’s love for Liu made him remember his favorite color, his name, regardless of what the world dictated.\n\nHow Xu Lina finally seeing and willing to love Gao JianHong made him look past his hurt, his hate, and remember his real dreams.\n\nHow Li Xun choosing to love his old friend, Gao JianHong, made both of them learn how to forgive and finally heal.\n\nAnd ultimately, how Gao JianHong choosing to see and love himself made him able to move forward and recognize what truly matters, past his desire to be defeat Li Xun and be number one.\n\nThe journey towards fulfilling our why’s and creating a better version of ourselves is difficult given our imperfections. But love can make it easier. It will not erase these flaws, but it will make us stronger to overpower them.\n\nMay we learn to love and be loved.\n\n“Once you learn how to die, you learn how to live.”\n\nI must say adding the cancer element in the last leg of this drama was a stroke of genius. To some, it may have felt like it came from the left field but for me, it isn’t. It’s actually quite poetic – this dying Gao JianHong could have benefitted from L&P had he not railroaded its original purpose.\n\nMore importantly, it proved to be a very potent plot device. The imminence of death was what pushed these characters who were still in the nascent stages of growing up – battling with the tendency to be bold and rash, the persisting temptation to give in to emotions – to promptly rethink what truly matters.\n\nIn the face of her husband’s death, Xu Lina was asked if her resentment towards him mattered more.\n\nIn the face of their old friend’s death, Zhu Yun and Li Xun were asked if their hatred and thirst for revenge mattered most.\n\nIn the face of death, Gao JianHong himself was asked: is the him today truly the person who he wants to be?\n\nIn the face of death, they all woke up. And they began to learn how to truly live.\n\nThe drama reminded me that we may be young now but our years run finite. We are certainly entitled to enjoy our youth, revel in our emotions, adrenaline rush, and worldly ambitions. To stumble and fall and rise again. Yet it is also worth taking a moment in our busy everyday to ask ourselves: If today is my last day on earth, am I ready? Have I done what mattered most? Have I cherished who mattered most? Is the person I am today close enough to the person I truly want to be?\n\nAfter all, death will arrive for each and one of us. We can’t just keep on pretending it would never.\n\nLighter and Princess (2022) may appear to be a light, romantic campus drama but it is much more than that.\n\nIt is a story about growing up. It tells us that we are all in this journey of fulfilling ourselves – yet sometimes we get lost on what it means. We are all desperate to gain traction in this journey but it is difficult due to our flawed nature. We are humans. Many times, we will make mistakes. We will get distracted and take the wrong turn, make the wrong decision. And it should be okay, as long as we acknowledge these wrong turns and rectify them. But given our limited years, we cannot afford to make the same mistakes over and over again. We can never settle with the excuse that we are flawed. Because we are humans, and we are more than our flaws. We have the capacity to overcome these flaws. We have the infinite capacity to learn and be better. This process is called growing up. And it never ends.\n\nLighter and Princess reminds us that it is crucial that we never forget what matters most, who matters most. That in this wrestling match called life, we never forget our why’s, who we truly are, and who we want to be. May we always see and love ourselves. May we go beyond our boxes to see and love others. May we be willing and strong enough to anchor and guide them all whom we claim to love.\n\n/20221203"
