        "text": "Merry Christmas, dearest readers! It’s that time of the year again when I look back into the dramas that I’ve watched in a year. Comparing it to my 2016 record of 12 dramas and 6 specials, I only managed to finish 10 dramas this year and most of them were even started last year. What a great decline and the trend observed was that as I grew older, the less dramas I get to watch when I thought it would be the opposite *sighs*.\n\nOn a brighter side, I ended up loving more than half of the dramas that I watched out of 10 so quality over quantity was probably the main theme of this year’s drama round-up. I’ll stop talking now and hope you can join me in going through this wonderful drama year!\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI first started watching dramas back when I was 8 years old because “Meteor Garden” was such a phenomenon. Up to now, I only know one person who never got into the hype and we all still jokingly judge her because of it haha! I watched K-dramas in the same local channel that aired Meteor Garden years after. My love for Asian dramas eventually died and I went on to watch Western shows and I never imagined myself re-entering Dramaland. Not until the local channel that decided to air “Meteor Garden” two years ago and voila! This is already my third year of watching dramas. Good times, good times.\n\nWhen I wrote my 2015 Year-End Drama Round-Up (part 1 & part 2), some dramas that I’ve watched already were being recommended. It was then that I realized that I never wrote about it here that’s why they were probably suggesting it. With that, I wrote about the dramas that I watched in my first year of fully getting into this wonderful world called dramaland. A lot of the dramas mentioned are very special in my heart and if only I could have all the time and willpower to write individual reviews on them, I would but the mini-reviews that you will be reading should suffice for now.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nIf you know me well, you would know that I am currently out of air absorbing this news because F4 is a vital part of how I came into this dramaland especially that it’s Van Ness Wu and Jerry Yan aka my top 2 husbands ❤\n\nI won’t talk much because I swear, they will just be written in all caps and just endless fangirling raves and squeals. So let the photos (which are not mine btw) say what they want to say ❤ hope you can click ‘Read More’ and fangirl with me ❤ See, my fangirling madness has already started by putting 2 heart symbols already lol\n\nContinue reading →\n\nOMG HELLO DRAMA BLOGGING WORLD!!! Drama and/or blogging hiatuses or maybe taking breaks in general from the usual habits can make people go crazy. I should know because it’s what I’m currently experiencing. Yes, I’m back but only because if I don’t blog about this, I might just explode haha! Kidding aside, I just want to reiterate my reason for staying in the Taiwanese/Chinese drama fandom: never-ending fan service!\n\nMy ultimate favorite Taiwanese drama, “Autumn’s Concerto” just recently had a cast reunion! All this time I thought I was in a dream until my friend pointed out that they weren’t throwback photos, but they actually reunited after 3 years (they reunited back in 2013). Hope you can join me in this fangirling madness *squeals*. WARNING: photo spamming and lots of fangirling ahead!\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe drama gods have been very generous lately! Ever since Chinese period drama “The Princess Wei Young” (adapted from a novel with the same title) was in the news for finding its main leads in Tiffany Tang and Luo Jin, nothing much followed right after. It didn’t really catch my attention until they added another big name to the list of its cast members… Continue reading →\n\nAnother Weibo round-up because why not? 😀 I tried to include the celebrities that I didn’t include during my last round-up while I couldn’t help but repeat some just because they’re so active in this wonderful microblogging site 😉\n\nEveryone’s favorite Chinese supermodel is very happy with her bike! I’ve always thought that Liu Wen was my soulmate because we both don’t have enough life skills to survive (read: can’t swim, can’t bike, etc) but looks like my soulmate has already left me…. haha! This is all thanks to “We Are In Love” or China’s version of “We Got Married” which just recently concluded.\n\nContinue reading →"
