        "text": "A master post for all Chinese dramas, including Taiwanese dramas, that I have seen up until the year 2014. Enjoy~\n\nAs per usual, 2 different ratings, first is how much I liked it without regard to quality of plot, and the second is whether I would recommend it. Both are out of 10, with 10 being the most, and 1 being the least. I know these shows are quite old, so these are based on my memory, and I would re-watch a few scenes if I don’t remember.\n\nThis list spans a little more than a decade. I started with Taiwanese Idol Dramas, then ventured into Mainland China Dramas. Dramas that I watched long time ago, I may not remember much of the story line, but I may remember some of the feelings that I had as I watched these shows… Some, I watched while it was airing, like really long ago, and others, I watched as recent as mid-2016.\n\n2005\n\n綠光森林 / Green Forest, My Home (6/10, 6/10)\n\nThe first ever drama that I watched on the VCR. Angst-filled, and being as young as I was, I remember being brought to tears quite easily on many occasion.\n\n2006\n\n王子變青蛙 / Prince turns into Frog (7/10, 7/10)\n\nTHE Taiwanese drama to watch, from long ago. Enjoyable.\n\n愛情魔髮師 / The Magicians of Love (5/10, 5/10)\n\nDrama in a hair salon.\n\n微笑 Pasta / Smiling Pasta (6/10, 5/10)\n\nLighthearted romantic comedy.\n\n星蘋果樂園 / Legend of Star Apple (?/10, ?/10)\n\nI remember nothing much of this, except that, I did watch this show…\n\n剪刀 石頭 布 / A Game about Love (6/10, 5/10)\n\nA little more melodramatic than the usual romantic comedy…\n\n2007\n\n櫻野3加1 / Ying Ye 3 Jia 1 (6/10, 5/10)\n\nThe beginning was enjoyable, then it faltered till the end.\n\n公主小妹 / Romantic Princess (5/10, 6/10)\n\nLighthearted romantic comedy.\n\n放羊的星星 / My Lucky Star (6/10, 6/10)\n\nLighthearted romantic comedy. With a little more angst than the above.\n\n轉角*遇到愛 / Corner with Love (6/10, 6/10)\n\nLighthearted romantic comedy. Although, I can’t remember how the angst came about for this…\n\n惡女阿楚 / Mean Girl Ah Chu (?/10, ?/10)\n\nI remember nothing much of this, except that, I did watch this show…\n\n2008\n\n命中註定我愛你 / Fated to Love You (8/10, 7/10)\n\nMy absolute favourite Taiwanese drama ever. I schedule a re-watch almost once a year.\n\n幸福的抉擇 / I Do? (6/10, 7/10)\n\nQuite angst filled.\n\n無敵珊寶妹 / Woody Sambo (4/10, 4/10)\n\nI remember being not impressed at all, at anything whatsoever.\n\n不良笑花 / Miss No Good (5/10, 5/10)\n\nHer voice grated on my nerves.\n\n籃球火 / Hot Shot (7/10, 6/10)\n\nI remember basketball, and that the guys were very pretty. Please refer above picture ^-^ I liked it.\n\n霹靂MIT / Mysterious Incredible Terminator (6/10, 6/10)\n\nInteresting mysteries set in a high school.\n\n2009\n\n仙剑奇侠传3 / Chinese Paladin 3 / Xian Jian Qi Xia Zhuan 3 (7/10, 6/10)\n\nAddictive story line, especially Tiffany Tang and Wallace Huo’s characters… I may have skipped university lectures to feed the addiction *squinty-eyes*\n\n下一站, 幸福 / Autumn’s Concerto (7/10, 8/10)\n\nAngst filled, but very captivating.\n\n福氣又安康 / Easy Fortune Happy Life (6/10, 5/10)\n\nI liked it, but wished it was more…\n\n痞子英雄 / Black & White (6/10, 7/10)\n\nThe first Taiwanese police drama that I watched. I was impressed, but I think it could have been better.\n\n敲敲愛上你 / Knock Knock Loving You (5/10, 4/10)\n\nSo much angst.\n\n敗犬女王 / My Queen (6/10, 7/10)\n\nNot really my thing, I found it charmingly interesting.\n\n2010\n\n犀利人妻 / The Fierce Wife (5/10, 7/10)\n\nNot my thing at all, but I enjoyed it cautiously.\n\n女王不下班 / Four Gifts (?/10, ?/10)\n\nI remember nothing much of this, except that, I did watch this show…\n\n偷心大聖 P.S.男 / PS Man (4/10, 6/10)\n\nI didn’t really like this…\n\n就想賴著妳 / Down With Love (6/10, 7/10)\n\nLighthearted romantic comedy. With some angst.\n\n2011\n\n夏家三千金 / The Xia Girls / My Daughter / Xia Jia San Qian Jin (6/10, 6/10)\n\nThis was so so so makjang. And so so so overboard. This has 80 episodes, if you want to dive in, I have warned you…\n\n怪侠一枝梅 / Strange Hero Yi Zhi Mei / The Vigilantes in Masks / Guai Xia Yi Zhi Mei (8/10, 8/10)\n\nOne of my favourite Chinese drama. Mysteries in ancient time.\n\n步步惊心 / Scarlet Heart / Startling By Each Step / Bu Bu Jing Xin (7/10, 9/10)\n\nOne of the best for the year, solid and captivating. But, it was so angst filled…\n\n我可能不會愛你 / In Time With You (7/10, 7/10)\n\nRomantic comedy with refreshing characters. I thought this was better than the Korean remake.\n\n醉後決定愛上你 / Love You (7/10, 8/10)\n\nOne of Taiwan’s best romantic comedy ever. Really entertaining and a delight.\n\n2012\n\n爱的蜜方 / Love Actually / Sweet Side of Love aka Love Recipe/ Ai De Mi Fang (6/10, 5/10)\n\nI enjoyed this. There was cooking, and then some makjang stuffs…\n\n爱情闯进门 / When Love Walked In / Ai Qing Chuang Jin Men (5/10, 4/10)\n\nA lot like Romantic Princess after thinking about it. Tried hard but was a little blah…\n\n胜女的代价 / The Queen of SOP / Sheng Nu De Dai Jia (8/10, 7/10)\n\nOne of my favourite romantic comedy.\n\n2013\n\n笑傲江湖 / Swordsman / Xiao Ao Jiang Hu (6/10, 5/10)\n\nEntertaining, but I didn’t really like it. The costumes were too colourful. It’s almost like, it was so bad, it was good kinda thing…\n\n陆贞传奇 / Female Prime Minister (7/10, 8/10)\n\nOne of the best for the year. Captivating plot and delightful characters.\n\n兰陵王 / 蘭陵王 / The Prince of Lan Ling / Lan Ling Wang (6/10, 7/10)\n\nEnjoyable and entertaining. Filmed beautifully.\n\n沒有名字的甜點店 / Amour et Pâtisserie\n\nA delightful watch, especially the desserts…\n\n2014\n\n步步惊情 / Startling Love With Each Step / Scarlet Heart 2 / Bu Bu Jing Qing (4/10, 4/10)\n\nIt was filmed prettily, but sadly, a frustrated total waste of time.\n\n大漠谣 / 风中奇缘 / 星月传奇 / Sound of the Desert / Ballad of the Desert / Da Mo Yao / Feng Zhong Qi Yuan (6/10, 7/10)\n\nBased on the novel by Tong Hua. A pleasant enjoyable drama.\n\n大汉贤后卫子夫 / Virtuous Queen of Han / Da Han Xian Hou Wei Zi Fu (5/10, 5/10)\n\nNot a dramatic show. Mostly spent on talking…\n\n古剑奇谭 / Sword of Legends / Legend of the Ancient Sword / Gu Jian Qi Tan (7/10, 7/10)\n\nEntertaining wu xia drama with charming interesting characters.\n\n金玉良缘 / Perfect Couple / Jin Yu Liang Yuan (8/10, 8/10)\n\nOne of my favourite Chinese drama ever. Romantic comedy with angst.\n\n杉杉来了/ Boss and Me / Shan Shan Lai Le (6/10, 7/10)\n\nJust completed in mid-2016. Lighthearted with some typical angst…\n\nWow. What a list.\n\nNow, I don’t really watch Taiwanese dramas at all. Only when there is something that really captivates me…\n\nMainland China dramas are quite long, but they have improved their quality over the years, say story line, effects and what nots… However, once in a while, you may still meet some that is just pure nonsense…"
