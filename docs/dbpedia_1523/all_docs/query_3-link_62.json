Luckily, my publishing fairy godmother granted my wish because I had the fantastic opportunity of reading and reviewing The Princess and the Fangirl by Ashley Poston which is the sequel and spinoff to Geekerella, a Cinderella retelling. *cue happy tears* If you haven‚Äôt yet read Geekerella yet, I would highly recommend it because it‚Äôll 100% appeal to your fangirl heart. üíñ The story is fun, and the characters are endearing. If Disney Channel wanted to continue their ‚ÄúA Cinderella Story‚Äù series, Geekerella would have been the perfect pick.\n\nAshley Poston‚Äôs humor and charm perfectly captures the spirit of the fairy tale we all know and love, presenting it in a creative and unique way. ‚úè The Princess and the Fangirl was the perfect companion novel to the original book with new characters and an enticing storyline that will never leave you bored or tired. I buddy read this book with Charvi from Not Just Fiction, and she loved the books as much as I did. Our messages were basically squealing about the intense drama and surprise cameos of our favorite characters! It‚Äôs safe to say that this book did not disappoint. üëë\n\nTHE PRINCESS AND THE FANGIRL (GEEKERELLA #2) by Ashley Poston\n\nPUBLISHED BY Quirk Books on April 2nd, 2019\n\nGENRES: Contemporary, Retelling\n\nPAGES: 352\n\nADD TO GOODREADS // BOOK DEPOSITORY\n\nThe Prince and the Pauper gets a modern makeover in this adorable, witty, and heartwarming young adult novel set in the Geekerella universe by national bestselling author Ashley Poston.\n\nImogen Lovelace is an ordinary fangirl on an impossible mission: save her favorite character, Princess Amara, from being killed off from her favorite franchise, Starfield. The problem is, Jessica Stone‚Äîthe actress who plays Princess Amara‚Äîwants nothing more than to leave the intense scrutiny of the fandom behind. If this year‚Äôs ExcelsiCon isn‚Äôt her last, she‚Äôll consider her career derailed.\n\nWhen a case of mistaken identity throws look-a-likes Imogen and Jess together, they quickly become enemies. But when the script for the Starfield sequel leaks, and all signs point to Jess, she and Imogen must trade places to find the person responsible. That‚Äôs easier said than done when the girls step into each other‚Äôs shoes and discover new romantic possibilities, as well as the other side of intense fandom. As these ‚Äúprincesses‚Äù race to find the script-leaker, they must rescue themselves from their own expectations, and redefine what it means to live happily ever after.\n\nThe Princess and the Fangirl is a modern-day retelling of The Prince and the Pauper, following the lives of Imogen Lovelace and Jessica Stone. üí´ Imogen is your girl-next-door fangirl who is desperately trying to save her favorite character Princess Amara from being killed off the Starfield franchise. Jessica Stone, the actress who plays Princess Amara, wants the exact opposite. If Princess Amara is killed off, she‚Äôll have the chance to finally star in a non-geek movie, but when someone starts leaking the secret movie script and all signs point to Jessica, both girls must switch places to find the culprit.\n\nI rarely say this about any book, but this book was perfectly paced. There is never a dull moment within the story, and action begins right off the first page. üòç The entire story takes place within a span of 4 days so things move quickly, but we‚Äôre also given certain scenes that are less action-packed which serve as a refresher to balance the overall story. Not to mention, Poston‚Äôs writing is simple yet charming which makes the words flow off the page like a movie. It‚Äôs easy to be swept away by her words and picture every scene occurring within your mind.\n\n‚ÄúWe need those stories, too. Stories that tell us that we can be bold and brash and make mistakes and still come out better on the other side.‚Äù\n\nThe geekiness and nerdiness of the book were so relatable. There are both subtle (and not so subtle) references to Star Wars, Harry Potter, etc. which made me smile every time they were mentioned. Also, since this story is told from a dual POV, we get to see what life in pop culture is like from both sides. We see fun passionate side where fans quote movies and cosplay characters, having fun and bonding over a mutual interest. üíò On the other hand, we also see the ugly side which often doesn‚Äôt get mentioned. Through Jessica, we see how toxic the negativity and hate can get in a world that is increasingly connected through social media.\n\nOne of the most magical things about this series is the Starfield franchise. Even though it‚Äôs fiction, it‚Äôs easy to see how much thought and care Poston has put into crafting it from the characters to the lingo. You can see how much Starfield has made a lasting impact on the people it‚Äôs influenced at the convention and the characters themselves. That feeling of being able to wholeheartedly connect with a book series, TV show, or movie franchise has been captured in the hearts of the fans. It‚Äôs a feeling that fangirls like me know and cherish well so reading a book where everyone is just as passionate feels magical. ‚ú®\n\nEven though the book takes place in a span of 4 days, the romances manage to remain refreshing and shy away from the dreaded trope of insta-love. Ethan Tanaka is now on my list of the top swoon-worthy love interests‚Äîhe‚Äôll sweep you off your feet! üòò Although he and Imogen start off on the wrong foot, I just loved every single one of their interactions and how Imogen helped bring out his inner fanboy. **mild spoiler** I also absolutely love that he defended himself to be Slytherin when Imogen called him a burnt Hufflepuff** Jessica and her love interest were just as endearing. The f/f romance was incredibly sweet to watch unfold because as you read, you know that‚Äôll happen slowly but surely.\n\n‚ÄúYou and I are made of stars.‚Äù\n\nThis book is for the passionate, nerdy fans in the world. It‚Äôs wonderfully charming and a great spinoff to the adored Geekerella. Despite it being a retelling, it wasn‚Äôt entirely predictable which made the ready journey all the more fun. üå† It takes a chance of having characters acknowledge privilege in the midst of Hollywood drama. I can‚Äôt wait to see what Ashley Poston writes next, and I hope we get a chance to see more of these fantastic characters in the future! As always‚Ä¶Look to the stars. Aim. Ignite.\n\nHave you read The Princess and the Fangirl? What were your thoughts? üíï"
