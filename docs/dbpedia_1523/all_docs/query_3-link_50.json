        "text": "V-Cinema Wish list\n\nTom Mes, “V-Cinema: How Home Video Revitalized Japanese Film and Mystified Film Historians”\n\nAlthough not acknowledged in the accepted discourse of continuous decline, the 1990s were one of Japanese cinema’s most vibrant and prolific decades. This was thanks in no small part to V-Cinema, the straight-to-video industry, initiated by former major studio Toei in 1989. Below are my picks for films whose inclusion would do much to spice up our accounts of recent Japanese film history. It must be noted that Japan has not been much kinder to its own heritage: many of these titles were never rereleased after their original VHS incarnation and have been withering in the archives of reluctant distribution companies since the early 1990s.\n\nNeo Chinpira (Neo chinpira teppōdama pyū, 1990) dir: Takahashi Banmei\n\nA comedy about the day-to-day travails of a low-level gangster, this was an unlikely hit for Toei that made a star out of its lead actor Aikawa Shō. He and director Takahashi—a veteran of Nikkatsu Roman Porno and early 1980s art cinema—would go on to repeat the formula not only in a sequel but in so many other productions that the “Aikawa Sho gangster comedy” became almost a genre in itself. The six-part Suit Yourself or Shoot Yourself! series by Kurosawa Kiyoshi (a former protégé of Takahashi’s) is also modeled closely on it.\n\nTuff (Tafu, 1990) dir: Harada Masato\n\nAn aimless young man who makes a living delivering pizzas finds himself an apt pupil to a professional hitman after finding himself in the middle of one of his murder scenes. The most Hollywood oriented of contemporary Japanese film directors found a natural home in the genre-oriented environment of V-Cinema and delivered a thoroughly entertaining action film full of visual flair that belies the medium’s meager means. This was the first part in a six-film series whose final installment, Painted Desert (1993), brought Harada full circle by being shot in the U.S. and featuring such Hollywood thesps as James Gammon and Vincent Schiavelli.\n\nStranger (Yoru no sutorenjā kyōfu, 1991) dir: Nagasaki Shunichi\n\nA woman who works as a taxi driver finds herself stalked by an unknown assailant in a 4WD. Director Nagasaki, one of the major names to emerge from the late-1970s indie film scene, ramps up the paranoia factor in this urban riff on Spielberg’s Duel. Lead actress Natori Yūko was a major star and household name, but here she appears thoroughly deglamorized in oversized men’s clothing and without makeup.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVduIlQKWPo\n\nCarlos (Karurosu, 1991) dir: Kiuchi Kazuhiro\n\nDirector Kiuchi Kazuhiro is better known as the creator of the oft-adapted manga Be-Bop High School and as a novelist (Miike Takashi’s Shield of Straw [Wara no tate, 2013] is based one of his bestsellers). Throughout the 1990s he also directed a handful of gritty crime films, starting with this straight-to-video tale of a Japanese-Brazilian criminal’s ascent through the underworld. With its reflections on minorities and petty crime in post-Bubble era Japan, Carlos set the template for countless later works by Miike Takashi, Mochizuki Rokurō, Aoyama Shinji, and other leading proponents of V-Cinema. Takenaka Naoto, of Shall We Dance? fame, plays the very Tony Montana-esque title role.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEVVFl6ZTXo\n\nFemale Convict Scorpion: Death Notice (Joshū sasori satsujin yokoku, 1991) dir: Ikeda Toshiharu\n\nAs Toei’s V-Cinema line began taking off proper, it was only a matter of time before the company began mining its rich back catalogue for inspiration. One of the first of these was a remake of Itō Shunya’s fondly remembered women-in-prison flick Female Convict 701: Scorpion (Joshū 701 sasori, 1972). Director Ikeda Toshiharu, who would go on to helm the lion’s share of Toei Video’s long-running “female action” series XX (Daburu ekkusu), shot the film in obvious tribute to Itō’s memorably stylish original, although purists at the time heaped scorn on the results, as well as on actress Okamoto Natsuki, who was given the unenviable task of stepping into the shoes of the original’s iconic star Kaji Meiko.\n\nTrailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxCLemvY7q0\n\nDance til Tomorrow (Asatte Dance, 1991) dir: Isomura Itsumichi\n\nThis adaptation of Yamamoto Naoki’s manga was Daiei’s first foray into V-Cinema, although the former major studio played to its strengths by giving it a limited theatrical release first—thereby initiating a strategy that would ensure V-Cinema’s legacy as a revitalizing force in Japanese cinema. The film was also a trailblazer by bringing the romantic comedy genre into an until then strictly male-oriented market.\n\nFragment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0yu9LNGUZU\n\nDownfall (Daraku, 1992) dir: Jissōji Akio\n\nJissōji Akio (1937-2006) was one of Japanese cinema’s most unclassifiable filmmakers. Starting his directing career in television in the 1960s on the various incarnations of the Ultraman series, for the big screen he made everything from challenging art films for ATG (such as This Transient Life / Mujō and Mandala) in the early 1970s to large-scale effects-heavy blockbusters like Tokyo: The Last Megalopolis (Taitei monogatari, 1988), as well as numerous adaptations of tales by ero-guro mystery author Edogawa Rampo. Many of Jissōji’s films contain taboo-breaking sexual themes, which is likely why he used the medium of V-Cinema to explore the narrative possibilities of explicit, unsimulated sex, sidestepping the restrictions imposed on theatrical releases.\n\nThe Wicked Reporter series (Gokudō kisha, 1993-’96) + The Outer Way (Gedō, 1998) dir: Mochizuki Rokurō\n\nBlessed with a retrospective at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in 1998, Mochizuki Rokurō should be seen as one of the standard bearers in bringing V-Cinema to world’s attention. The backbone to his oeuvre of 1990s crime thrillers is The Wicked Reporter series, set among the downtrodden in post-Bubble Japan: those forced to scrape by as gamblers, low-level gangsters, grifters, prostitutes, and petty thieves. The almost surreal The Outer Way plays like a Clint Eastwood vigilante movie as directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky and is the director’s masterpiece. In all these films, Mochizuki’s background in pink films and adult video shines through in his depiction of sex: devoid of glamour but full of unapologetically carnal lust.\n\nMore information can be found on Midnight Eye: Visions of Japanese Cinema - http://www.midnighteye.com\n\nNon-profit, non-commercial database of film reviews, interviews, books, and other features.

In this speculation on “apocalyptic anime,” that is, anime in the wake of the atomic bomb, and on the animatic thinking of Baudrillard, Akira, as the breakthrough anime into the West in 1988, is treated as exemplary, not only in its narrative but as its narrative. Indeed, it not only becomes exemplary of a major genre of anime, it performs that genre of apocalypse, of explosion and implosion, a form of animation film and film animation as warrior in a war between not only anime and American animation but Japan and America, even as film animation and nation animation are inextricably commingled, making it impossible to distinguish one from the other. In other words, extending von Clausewitz’s “War is merely the continuation of policy [politics] by other means,” the chapter argues that film animation is a form of war. Or better, in this case, hyperfilm hyperanimation, of which anime, or better hyperanime, is a key performative mode, as exemplified by Akira. But more is at stake yet in this hyperreal agonistics, as the chapter develops after Baudrillard: the universal, the global, and the singular. For Akira puts at stake the possibility of Japan winning this war with the United States by seducing it and its globalizing ambitions through hypersimulation, returning/maintaining Japan’s singularity, its “snobbishness,” as Alexandre Kojève characterized it, its radical foreignness, “Radical Exoticism,” as Baudrillard conceptualizes such exoticism after Victor Segalen.\n\nMurakami Haruki’s most disliked stories—and why you might want to read them anyway\n\nRebecca Suter, “Murakami Haruki’s Transnational Avant-Pop Literature”\n\n1) Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973\n\nWho dislikes them:\n\nMurakami himself. These were the very first novels that Murakami published, when he was still working part-time as the owner and manager of the jazz bar Peter Cat in the Kokubunji neighborhood of Tokyo, writing at night when the bar closed. They were translated into English by Alfred Birnbaum in a bilingual edition published by Kodansha and only distributed in Japan; the unconfirmed rumor is that Murakami himself did not want the English versions to be reprinted because he wasn’t happy with the novels.\n\nWhat they are about:\n\nThe novels don’t have a very strong plot; they are mostly made up by fragments describing the daily life of the two protagonists, the unnamed narrator “boku” and his friend Nezumi (Rat), a large proportion of which seems to be spent chatting and drinking at “J’s bar.” In the second novel, a pair of identical twin girls named “208” and “209” also begin to live in boku’s apartment, and the narrator goes on a quest for the perfect pinball machine.\n\nWhy read them:\n\nThey contain many elements that will recur in Murakami’s later novels, including the character of Rat, that will be central in A Wild Sheep’s Chase, and that of Naoko, the protagonist’s troubled girlfriend that returns in Norwegian Wood. A new translation of Hear the Wind Sing by Ted Goossen was published in 2015 in the magazine Monkey Business.\n\n2) Norwegian Wood\n\nWho dislikes it:\n\nMost Japanese intellectuals. The novel was Murakami’s first great success, selling two million copies in the hardback edition. It incensed critics who resented the excessive popularity of the story and criticized it as superficial and disengaged from politics and society.\n\nWhat it is about:\n\nIt talks about the student days of Murakami’s first protagonist to have a name, Toru Watanabe, during the years 1968-69, told retrospectively by Toru himself when he is in his late thirties. It focuses on Toru’s life at university and his relationship with two girls, the troubled Naoko and the more bubbly, if equally complex, Midori.\n\nWhy read it:\n\nWhile critics dismiss its treatment of the student movement and of the social and political climate of late 1960s Japan as superficial, the story in fact offers an alternative insight into that time period from the perspective of ordinary young people of the time. Also, Midori’s description of perfect love: “…say I tell you I want to eat strawberry shortcake. And you stop everything you’re doing and run out and buy it for me. And you come back out of breath and get down on your knees and hold this strawberry shortcake out to me. And I say I don’t want it anymore and throw it out the window. That’s what I’m looking for.”\n\n3) Kafka on the Shore\n\nWho dislikes it:\n\nJay Rubin. Murakami’s most prolific translator famously decided that he didn’t like the book, and preferred not to translate it, so the publisher had to ask Philip Gabriel instead. Jay and Philip later collaborated on the translation of 1Q84.\n\nWhat it is about:\n\nThe story is told as two parallel narratives, one following Tamura Kafka, a fifteen-year-old boy who runs away from his father’s home and travels to the island of Shikoku, and one following Nakata-san, a sixty-year-old man with a mental disability who can talk to cats. The two never meet, but their stories intersect at many points, and in the process they uncover several subplots centering on human relations and supernatural events.\n\nWhy read it:\n\nIt’s Murakami’s first novel to have a narrator different from the signature late twenties to early thirties boku; the characters of Kafka and Nakata have greater psychological complexity than other Murakami heroes while still retaining the same half-blasé, half-sensitive attitude. Plus Nakata’s conversations with the cats, and the scene where fish rain on the city, are priceless.\n\nChapter Thirty-Four Summary\n\nTong Lam, “Japan Lost and Found: Modern Ruins as Debris of the Economic Miracle”\n\nHaikyo, literally “ruins,” is an activity that mostly involves young people seeking adventure in abandoned places scattered across Japan. The haikyo movement, which is gaining participants and fans, involves visiting sites, photographing them, and sharing the photographs online and through books and other media. The transformation of Japan into a postindustrial society left behind numerous industrial sites for these modern ruins enthusiasts. But the “economic tsunami” that hit Japan in the so-called “Lost Decades” of the 1990s and 2000s created an added inventory of abandoned places that once represented the splendor of Japanese consumerism.\n\nIn this chapter, I draw on my experience as a photographer of two types of modern ruins—industrial and postindustrial—to reflect on the haikyo phenomena. I examine the social, technological, and historical conditions that have made the mass production and consumption haikyo imagery possible. I also suggest that although modern Japanese ruins, especially when they appear in the form of dystopic fantasies, provide endless opportunities for entertainment, the physical ruins themselves are more than playgrounds. As the debris of history, these sites reveal the past dreams and ambitions that have long been buried by the new social and economic conditions. The exploration of ruins, in this respect, has the potential to create critical awareness of Japan’s recent neoliberal trends, where job security and economic confidence have been washed away by privatization, globalization, and financialization. More than being just a popular pastime, haikyo may therefore provide redemptive and liberating alternatives."
