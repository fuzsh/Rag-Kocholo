        "text": "On September 26th, 2007 at 1:30am, I finished watching Hana Kimi. This show gained a huge following upon its immediate debut in Japan and it’s really a no-brainer. The show is based on a popular manga of the same name. As stated before in this blog, there is a Taiwanese version already out of the same show staring Wu Zun and Ella as the leads. Thus, the Japanese version of Hana Kimi strives to inherit the essence of the manga while also being new and creative to differentiate itself from the Taiwan version. The creation, in my opinion, is great. The show is great mixture of emotional drama and awesome comedy.\n\nBased on the manga Hanazakari no Kimitachi e by Hisaya Nakajo\n\nBroadcasted in 2007\n\n12 episodes\n\nOverall rating: A+\n\nThe story of the show is strangely similar to another big hit – Coffee Prince. It is a love in disguise story. The heroine, Ashiya Miyaki, disguises herself as a male to be close to her idol, Sano, who happens to attend an all-male school (hence the required disguise). Love starts to develop despite the facade of homosexual love. To balance the seriousness of the show, the feelings of the character Nakatsu toward Ashiya as a “gay lover” always bring about great laughter as he struggle with his feelings. The show revolves around this love triangle while also giving the other minor characters their time in the spot-light. By doing so, the viewers eventually get to know every students in the school. In the end, the viewers will feel as if they have lived with all the students as Ashiya have and will grow to love the school as did Ashiya.\n\nThe ending was especially tough for me because I did not expect this surge of sadness that erupts as Ashiya leaves the school. This is mainly due to my experience with the Taiwanese version of the show where the ending was not very emotional or a good conclusion. The ending of the Japanese Hana Kimi COMPLETELY redeem the story in the live-action world. I felt extremely sad that Ashiya might never get to meet her fellow classmates again and what will happen to Sano and Nakatsu? Very tough questions indeed. This is a show in which I’ll be happy to watch any sort of specials relating to it without a second thought just to see the characters come to life again.\n\nI believe this show, like Coffee Prince, is so great because it concentrates on what love truly means. It doesn’t mean a giant house with everything envelops in gold nor does it mean multiple “sexcapades.” It just means the urge to protect your love ones and never be apart from them. The humor of the show is also a big plus. Everything is very silly and “out there.” The ending, especially, contains so many funny moments that I laughed as much as I cried. But most importantly, the characters of the show is what make it a strong and solid piece of work. The cast jives very well together and not a single awkward moment. I recommend this show 100%. Actually, I already did to a friend and she is already on the way to the ending episode in two days. Nothing better than drama that makes your heart all warm inside. Am I right?"
