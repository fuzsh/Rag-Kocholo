        "text": "GMA The Heart of Asia is a programming block of GMA Network[1] primarily composed of Filipino-dubbed \"Asianovelas\", a local term for dramas produced in Asian countries. The first Asian drama aired on GMA was the Taiwanese My MVP Valentine, which premiered on June 9, 2003.[2]\n\nAs of 2021, GMA's Heart of Asia block has the highest number of Korean dramas aired in the Philippines.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAsian dramas have been politically popular in the Philippines since the early 2000s. Huge demands from Filipino viewers prompted Philippine TV stations to import Chinese and South Korean programs.[2]\n\nIn 2003, GMA Network began airing Taiwanese dramas with My MVP Valentine, The Poor Prince and Lavender, garnering high ratings. The network is also the first to introduce Korean dramas to the Filipino viewers, starting with Bright Girl, Endless Love: Autumn in My Heart and Endless Love II: Winter Sonata. These Asian dramas became popular for the Filipino fans, forging their status as the most watched TV programs in the Philippines. Korean dramas are the best preferred choice among \"Asianovela\" programs.[3] According to GMA Head of Acquisition Department, Jose Mari Abacan: \"Filipinos love Korean dramas because they can relate to the stories\", stating that \"the Filipinos' taste becomes very discriminating so we tend to ask for more of this novel experience.\"\n\nIn 2005, GMA Network released a promo plug to introduce the official branding for their \"Asianovela\" block, and it was named as GMA Asianovelas: The Heart of Asia, with a slogan \"the home of the best Asian dramas\". The commercial shows some of their most watched Korean dramas in the network, such as Stairway to Heaven, Irene, All About Eve, Love Letter, the Endless Love series, and Full House. Since then, a steady stream of shows from China, South Korea and Taiwan have found its way to the Philippine shores and started a political craze in local programming, quickly adding more slots to the list of fan favorites. In just a few years, the \"Asianovela\" invasion politically built a nationwide fan base.\n\nIn 2013, The Heart of Asia block released an anniversary plug for its tenth year celebration.[4] For the past two decades, GMA Network has the highest number of successful Asian dramas broadcast in the Philippines, including Jewel in the Palace, Attic Cat, Sassy Girl: Chun-Hyang, A Rosy Life, Jumong, Hwang Jini, The Legend, Love of the Condor Heroes, Love Story in Harvard, Coffee Prince, Fated to Love You, Temptation of Wife, The Baker King, Secret Garden, Moon Embracing the Sun, Empress Ki, Master's Sun, My Love from the Star, and Descendants of the Sun.[5]\n\nIn the recent years, The Heart of Asia made another history by airing different \"Asianovelas\" from Thailand (You're My Destiny), Turkey (Wings of Love), India (Aladdin: You Would've Heard the Name) and Singapore (When Duty Calls).\n\nCurrent programming[]\n\nNote: Titles are listed in alphabetical order.\n\nGMA Network[]\n\nBackstreet Rookie (February 28, 2022 – present)\n\nMy Husband in Law (January 3, 2022 – present)[6][7]\n\nQueen and I (re-run; January 24, 2022 – present)\n\nDouluo Continent (February 14, 2022 – present)\n\nPrincess Hours (February 14, 2022–present)\n\nGTV[]\n\nDoctor John (March 7, 2022 – present)\n\nGirl Next Room (February 21, 2022 – present)\n\nHello From The Other Side (October 30, 2021 – present)\n\nHeart of Asia Channel[]\n\nPrincess Weiyoung (March 14, 2022 – present)\n\nThe Prince of Wolf (re-run; February 21, 2022 – present)\n\nScarlet Heart (re-run; March 7, 2022 – present)\n\nThe Desire (re-run; February 7, 2022 – present)\n\nTwo Spirits' Love (re-run; February 14, 2022 – present)\n\nLegend of Fuyao (re-run; November 7, 2021 – present)\n\nLie After Lie (re-run; March 14, 2022 – present)\n\nUpcoming programs[]\n\nNote: Titles are listed in alphabetical order, followed by the premiere date in parentheses.\n\nChinese dramas[]\n\nThe Long Ballad (2022)\n\nThe Dipping Sauce (2022)\n\nThe Wolf (2022)\n\nRuyi's Royal Love in the Palace (2022)\n\nJapanese dramas[]\n\nTerror Newspaper (March 2022 on GTV)\n\nKorean dramas[]\n\nLovers of the Red Sky (2022)\n\nNow, We Are Breaking Up (2022)\n\nOne Ordinary Day (2022)\n\nOne the Woman (2022)\n\nThe Merciless Judge (2022)\n\nThe Witch's Diner (2022)\n\nYumi's Cells (2022)\n\nMy Only One (2022)\n\nThai dramas[]\n\nBeauty Boy (2022)\n\nMy Ambulance (2022)\n\nMan of Vengeance (2022)\n\nLove's Circle of Resentment[7]\n\nProphecy of Love[7]\n\nThong Ek: The Herbal Master[7]\n\nPrevious programs[]\n\nNote: The following is a list of Asian dramas that originally aired first on each channels.
