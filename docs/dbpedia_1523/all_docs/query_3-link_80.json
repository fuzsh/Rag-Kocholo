The Untamed (2019)\n\nChinese Name: 陈情令 (Chén Qíng Lìng)\n\nGenre: Xianxia\n\nNumber of Episodes: 50\n\nActors: Xiao Zhan, Wang Yibo\n\n“The Untamed” is based on one of the most popular Chinese webnovels ever. In fact, it was so addicting to watch that I binged the whole series in less than a week! It takes place in a universe with ancient clans, dark magic, and constantly shifting allegiances.\n\nWei Wu Xian starts out as a promising young cultivator, but he gets involved in the dark arts and dies as a heretic. Years later, he’s mysteriously resurrected.\n\nHis match appears to be Lan Wang Ji, a righteous cultivator from a prestigious clan. Despite their differences, they’re drawn to each other, and delve into a series of mysterious events to investigate Wei Wu Xian’s past.\n\n2. Love Between Fairy and Devil (2022)\n\nChinese Name: 苍兰诀 (Cāng Lán Jué)\n\nGenre: Xianxia\n\nNumber of Episodes: 36\n\nActors: Dylan Wang, Esther Yu\n\nThis massively popular drama portrays the unexpected relationship between Xiao Lan Hua, an orchid fairy, and Dong Fang Qing Cang, the notorious Lord Devil who was imprisoned for 30,000 years. Their destinies collide when Lan Hua unknowingly frees Qing Cang, leading to a magical body swap—and the only way to reverse it is through a kiss.\n\nThey’re also forced to grapple with the “One Heart Curse,” which makes the emotionless Qing Cang feel Lan Hua’s every emotion. As they come to understand each other better, Qing Cang has to fight against his internal darkness and initial intentions to sacrifice Lan Hua for his freedom.\n\n3. The Longest Promise (2023)\n\nChinese Name; 玉骨谣 (Yù Gǔ Yáo)\n\nGenre: Xianxia\n\nNumber of Episodes: 40\n\nActors: Xiao Zhan, Ren Min\n\nThis series drew a lot of attention because it has Xiao Zhan as the lead actor. He’s one of the most prominent figures in Cdrama, given his amazing performance in “The Untamed.”\n\nShi Ying is a former Crown Prince who’s practicing cultivation in the serene Jiuyi mountain. But then Zhu Yan becomes his apprentice, and they slowly develop feelings for each other.\n\nThis is extremely taboo, to the point that Shi Ying is even pressured to kill her. To further complicate things, it turns out that they’re both from rival kingdoms with opposing goals.\n\n4. Word of Honor (2021)\n\nChinese Name: 山河令 (Shānhé Lìng)\n\nGenre: Wuxia\n\nNumber of Episodes: 36\n\nActors: Zhang Zhe Han, Gong Jun\n\nBased on the boy’s love novel “Faraway Wanderers,” this is a captivating show with great chemistry between the two main characters and beautiful martial arts scenes.\n\nZhou Zi Shu wants to break away from his former life as a spy and assassin. He then meets Wen Ke Xing, a mysterious martial artist who has a shadowy past himself, and they team up to search for a legendary treasure that promises immense power.\n\nAlong the way, they encounter various sects with their own agendas, and their connection gets tested as they get tangled up in political plots and power plays.\n\n5. Eternal Love (2017)\n\nChinese Name: 三生三世十里桃花 (Sān Shēng Sān Shì Shí Lǐ Táo Huā)\n\nGenre: Xianxia\n\nNumber of Episodes: 58\n\nActors: Yang Mi, Mark Chao\n\nAlso known as “Ten Miles of Peach Blossoms,” this is one of the most-watched Chinese dramas of all time. It started out a bit slow for me at first, but I’m glad I kept going with it–—t turned out to be a heart-wrenching love story, with am intricate plot that plays out over thousands of years and multiple reincarnations.\n\nAt the start, Bai Qian, a goddess from the Heavenly Realms, is introduced in her human form as Si Yin. She then unexpectedly meets Ye Hua, a human prince, but their story doesn’t end well in this lifetime. Still, their paths cross again, after three hundred years–and one remembers their connection while the other doesn’t at all.\n\n6. Handsome Siblings (2020)\n\nChinese Name: 绝代双骄 (Jué Dài Shuāng Jiāo)\n\nGenre: Wuxia\n\nNumber of Episodes: 44\n\nActors: Chen Zhe Yuan, Hu Yi Tian\n\n“Handsome Siblings” features two unparalleled martial artists: Jiang Xiao Yu of Yihua Palace and Hua Wu Que, who’s raised by the villainous Ten Villains sect.\n\nThey were raised to be enemies, but there’s a twist: they’re actually twin brothers who were intentionally separated at birth. They see each other as rivals initially, but as fate keeps pulling them together, they start to learn about the truth behind their bloodline and the dark plots that led to their separation.\n\nThis series tackles interesting questions such as the meaning of family and nature versus nurture, all while being jam-packed with intense fight scenes.\n\n7. Who Rules the World (2022)\n\nChinese Name: 且试天下 (Qiě Shì Tiānxià)\n\nGenre: Wuxia\n\nNumber of Episodes: 40\n\nActors: Yang Yang, Zhao Lu Si\n\n“Who Rules the World” is set in the Dadong Empire, where six kingdoms are under the rule of one emperor. The empire’s stability is symbolized by the Imperial Token, so when It goes missing, chaos ensues.\n\nHei Feng Xi and Bai Feng Xi are both renowned martial artists who get deeply involved in the search for the Imperial Token. Both of them are also secretly royals from different kingdoms.\n\nThroughout the series, they go from being curious about each other to working together as equals and then falling in love. Expect lots of exciting chemistry between the two, along with palace intrigue!\n\nChinese Historical Series\n\n8. The Ghost Bride (2020)\n\nChinese Name: 彼岸之嫁 (Bǐ’àn Zhī Jià)\n\nGenre: Supernatural\n\nNumber of Episodes: 6\n\nActors: Peijia Huang, Chris Wu, Ludi Lin\n\nI found this 19th-century Malaysian drama intriguing because it revolves around a traditional Chinese concept: ghost brides. In a nutshell, a woman marries the spirit of a dead man so he won’t be lonely in the afterlife.\n\nLi Lan’s family is on the brink of financial collapse, so she desperately takes on such an offer from a wealthy family—she agrees to be the ghost bride of their dead son.\n\nThis solves her money problems, but she also gets thrown right into the realm of the dead. She then finds herself torn between two men: her new, deceased husband and a mysterious heavenly guard.\n\n9. The Princess Weiyoung (2016)\n\nChinese Name: 锦绣未央 (Jǐn Xiù Wèi Yāng)\n\nGenre: Historical\n\nNumber of Episodes: 54\n\nActors: Tiffany Tang, Luo Jin\n\nPrincess Feng Xin’er had a comfortable life—right until her dynasty, the Northern Liang, falls to the Northern Wei. In an attempt to save the princess, a kind-hearted girl named Li Weiyoung steps in and gives up her life. Xin’er seizes this chance to start over and takes on Weiyoung’s identity, with the goal of avenging her dynasty against the Northern Wei.\n\nThis drama focuses a lot on court politics, and it’s a bit more light-hearted compared to xianxia shows. Even though she encounters a lot of tricky situations, Xin’er relies on her wits and finds a way to solve them.\n\nChinese Modern Romance Shows\n\n10. Falling Into Your Smile (2021)\n\nChinese Name: 你微笑时很美 (Nǐ Wéixiào Shí Hěn Měi)\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy\n\nNumber of Episodes: 31\n\nActors: Xu Kai, Cheng Xiao\n\nLu Si Chen is a professional gamer who’s cold and aloof, but his world gets shaken up when Tong Yao—a brilliant female gamer—joins his team. She’s passionate and dead-set on breaking gender stereotypes, and they don’t get along that well initially. But as they go through competitions and deal with personal problems together, they start to warm up to each other.\n\nThis series does a good job of portraying how competitive gaming works in China. Even if you’re not into gaming, the romance is well-paced and cute, and there are a lot of laugh-out-loud scenes!\n\n11. When I Fly Towards You (2023)\n\nChinese Name: 当我飞奔向你 (Dāng Wǒ Fēi Bēn Xiàng Nǐ)\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy\n\nNumber of Episodes: 24\n\nActors: Zhou Yi Ran, Zhang Miao Yi\n\n“When I Fly Towards You” is a heartfelt coming-of-age story that actually made me remember my school years. Su Za Zai is a bubbly middle school transfer student, and she likes Zhang Lu Rang right away the first time she sees him. Zhang Lu Rang seems to have it all together on the outside because of his good grades and influential family, but deep down, he’s actually filled with self-doubt.\n\nSu Zai Zai helps break him out of his shell. Alongside other friends, he discovers what self-worth really means and begins to forge his own path as they grow up into adulthood.\n\n12. Unrequited Love (2019)\n\nChinese Name: 暗恋橘生淮南 (Ànliàn Jú Shēng Huáinán)\n\nGenre: Romance\n\nNumber of Episodes: 38\n\nActors: Zhao Shun Ran, Zhu Yan Ma Zi\n\nLuo Zhi secretly likes her childhood acquaintance, Sheng Huai Nan. She never forgets him because they keep having chance meetings in high school and—later on—university. All along, though, she never tells him directly about her feelings.\n\nIt’s a slice-of-life story where you’ll get to see teenagers grappling with unrequited love, as well as relatable school issues and more heavy-handed family problems. Luo Zhi gets an even harder time when Sheng Huai Nan starts dating another girl. With its slow pacing and shorter episodes, this is a hidden gem that’s relaxing to watch.\n\n13. Hidden Love (2023)\n\nChinese Name: 偷偷藏不住 (Tōu Tōu Cáng Bù Zhù)\n\nGenre: Romance\n\nNumber of Episodes: 25\n\nActors: Zhao Lu Si, Chen Zhe Yuan\n\n“Hidden Love” offers a unique spin on the classic “crush on the older brother’s friend” trope. Sang Zhi first meets Duan Jia Xu, her older brother’s charismatic friend, as a teenager, and she gets a crush on him.\n\nFast forward to when Sang Zhi is a university student, and she and Duan Jia Xu meet again—this time, he’s already working. They start to have sparks despite a five-year age difference.\n\nWhile Sang Zhi’s feelings have deepened from her initial infatuation, Duan Jia Xu has to adjust from seeing Sang Zhi as a younger sister figure to someone that he can date.\n\n14. Meteor Garden (2018)\n\nChinese Name: 流星花园 (Liúxīng Huāyuán)\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy\n\nNumber of Episodes: 50\n\nActors: Dylan Wang, Shen Yue, Darren Chen, Caesar Wu, Leon Leong\n\nIf you’re a Cdrama fan, you’ve definitely heard of “Meteor Garden.” This is the 2018 remake of the original 2001 Taiwanese hit.\n\nMing De University, a prestigious school, is dominated by the F4 group. This consists of four boys who are all wealthy and handsome. When Dong Shan Cai, a girl who’s from a humbler background, enters the school, she takes a stand and refuses to be bullied by the F4.\n\nThis defiance catches the eye of the group’s leader, Dao Ming Si. They start dating, but it’s far from a simple love story as jealousy, misunderstandings and complications abound.\n\n15. Use for My Talent (2021)\n\nChinese Name: 我亲爱的小洁癖 (Wǒ Qīn’ài de Xiǎo Jié Pǐ)\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy\n\nNumber of Episodes: 24\n\nActors: Jasper Liu, Shen Yue\n\nThis is adapted from the South Korean series “Clean With Passion for Now.” The premise is quirky enough: Shuang Jiao is a messy girl who’s deeply influenced by a traumatic childhood involving her mother, while Gu Ren Qi is an eccentric CEO of a cleaning company and a germaphobe.\n\nShuang Jiao applies at Ren Qi’s company because she’s desperately looking for a job. At first, Ren Qi finds it hard to stand Shuang Jiao, but they gradually come to like each other. The storyline is light and simple, and I enjoyed watching the characters grow as they confront their insecurities and traumas together.\n\n16. Put Your Head on My Shoulder (2019)\n\nChinese Name:致我们暖暖的小时光 (Zhì Wǒmen Nuǎn Nuǎn De Xiǎo Shíguāng)\n\nGenre: Romance\n\nNumber of Episodes: 24\n\nActors: Xing Fei, Lin Yi\n\nSi Tu Mo is a graduating student who wants to go into advertising, but she struggles to hold down a job while facing pressure from her family. Meanwhile, Gu Wei Yi, an astrophysics genius and her college classmate, needs to move to a new apartment.\n\nAn unexpected turn of events leads Si Tu Mo to share an apartment with Gu Wei Yi. The two can’t be more different: Mo is spontaneous and bubbly, while Wei Yi is methodical and reserved.\n\nBut through late-night study sessions and heartfelt conversations, they start to form a deeper connection, even with challenges like career pressure and past relationships.\n\n17. The Rational Life (2021)\n\nChinese Name: 理智派生活 (Lǐzhì Pài Shēnghuó)\n\nGenre: Romance\n\nNumber of Episodes: 35\n\nActors: Qin Lan, Dylan Wang\n\nShen Ruo Xin is a talented senior manager in her thirties. Aside from dealing with work politics and younger rivals, she’s also having a hard time deciding between two men. There’s Xu Min Jie, a competent executive who seems like a perfect match, and Qin Ming Yue, a younger intern.\n\nEven though Ming Yue is more than 10 years younger, he’s mature and supportive of Ruo Xin. As Ruo Xin grows closer to Ming Yue, they grapple with society’s judgments about age gaps in relationships. At the same time, her interactions with Min Jie are disappointing to the point of being funny, even though he’s the conventional choice.\n\n18. Love O2O (2016)\n\nChinese Name: 微微一笑很倾城 (Wēi Wēi Yī Xiào Hěn Qīng Chéng)\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy\n\nNumber of Episodes: 30\n\nActors: Yang Yang, Shuang Zheng\n\n“Love O2O” tells the story of Bei Wei Wei, a computer science student and an accomplished gamer. When her in-game husband suddenly divorces her, she starts a virtual romance with the game’s top player, Xiao Nai, who’s also her school’s heartthrob.\n\nUnknown to Wei Wei, Xiao Nai had already taken an interest in her after a chance real-world encounter. In the virtual world, drawn by her gaming skills, he proposes to her, and their relationship soon extends offline. They then have to deal with jealous peers and professional challenges as they embark on a business venture together in the competitive tech world.\n\nChinese Action and Crime Shows\n\n19.

Since he isn’t in the esports scene anymore, he takes up a job at an internet cafe managed by a passionate gamer, Chen Guo, and tries to play anonymously.\n\nChen Guo is a fan of Ye Xiu, so when she discovers his identity, she backs him up. With her support, Ye Xiu makes a comeback and builds a new team from scratch. With tournaments all throughout, the series shows how both strategic skills and dedication are needed to become a competitive gamer.\n\n20. The Victim’s Game (2020)\n\nChinese Name: 谁是被害者 (Shuí Shì Bèihàizhě)\n\nGenre: Crime\n\nNumber of Episodes: 8\n\nActors: Joseph Chang, Tiffany Hsu\n\nFang Yi Ren is a talented forensic detective with Asperger’s syndrome. He’s incredibly good at figuring out even the most complicated crime scenes, but he struggles to connect with people, especially with his estranged daughter.\n\nThe story takes a sinister turn when his daughter becomes a prime suspect in a series of murders.

It’s a dark story with plenty of plot twists, and the clues were so subtle that I couldn’t piece together what really happened until the end.\n\n21.
