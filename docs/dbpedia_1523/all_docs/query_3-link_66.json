        "text": "Producers of Chinese TV shows find new audiences for country’s wide-ranging stories in diverse foreign markets\n\nIan Stevenson, a 62-year-old native of Gisborne in northern New Zealand, has been an avid follower of Chinese dramas, or C-dramas, for five years.\n\nCurrently managing his accounting firm in Tauranga, Stevenson said that his preferred series is Princess Agents, a saga depicting the legendary journey of a slave who rises to become a female general amid the chaos during the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-581).\n\nHe said that the allure of this costume drama, which stars Zhao Liying and Lin Gengxin, lies in its meticulously woven blend of martial arts combat, poignant plot twists and captivating historical narratives set against an ancient, mystical backdrop.\n\n“My favorite genre is dramas set in ancient China with historical backgrounds and vivid depictions of conflicts,” he explained further.\n\nMisha Lee, a 65-year-old South Korean chef who immigrated to New Zealand almost 27 years ago, is also a seasoned fan of Chinese dramas.\n\nRecalling her habit of closely following new Chinese dramas for over 30 years, Lee lists some of her favorite series, which have also been phenomenal hits in China.\n\nThese titles include the 2017 series Eternal Love, which tells of a romance between a fox family’s princess and a crowned prince from the Heavenly Palace; the 2019 costume drama Joy of Life, centered around a young man with a mysterious origin; and the 2022 ancient China-set Love like the Galaxy, depicting the love story of a young general and the estranged daughter of a high-ranking official.\n\nAs an increasing number of domestic television programs journey overseas, a burgeoning wave of Chinese dramas has unfurled.\n\nStatistics from the National Radio and Television Administration, the country’s top sector regulator, show that TV dramas are the most imported category, accounting for 80 percent of all Chinese visual and audio content distributed overseas in 2023, reaching a global audience in more than 200 countries and regions.\n\n“China has risen as a significant provider and producer in the global television drama market,” said Zhu Xinmei, director of the International Communication Research Institute of the Development Research Center at the National Radio and Television Administration.\n\nIn recent years, a new trend has surfaced. Certain meticulously crafted dramas designed to highlight China’s accomplishments or commemorate specific historical moments have garnered popularity in foreign markets, despite the conventional challenge of such genres in making an impact overseas.\n\nAs one of the most prominent examples, Minning Town, a 23-episode TV series depicting the efforts of locals in Xihaigu, Ningxia Hui autonomous region, to overcome poverty, has garnered attention through streaming on YouTube and broadcasts in over 50 countries and regions across Asia, Europe, Oceania, and Africa.\n\nThe series has been translated into multiple languages, including English, Russian, Indonesian, and Arabic.\n\nZhu said that the series has gained popularity in African and Middle Eastern countries where audiences have shown a keen interest in China’s advanced agricultural technologies and effective methods for combating poverty.\n\nOther influential TV series overseas in this category include With You, an anthology series showcasing various individuals’ battles against the COVID-19 pandemic, and Faith Makes Great, a collection of 40 stories chronicling the 100-year history of the Communist Party of China.\n\nAdditionally, some popular dramas highlighting China’s decades-long friendship with foreign countries have also captivated audiences on both sides. For instance, Welcome to Milele Village, inspired by the real-life stories of more than 30 Chinese medical teams dispatched to African countries, has garnered over 2 million views overseas.\n\nThe drama received an award highlighting the friendship between China and Tanzania from Samia Suluhu Hassan, the president of Tanzania, in late August last year.\n\n“These excellent TV dramas embody distinctive Chinese values, showcase the striving spirit of the Chinese people, offer a fresh array of options for international audiences, and open new doors for Chinese dramas to reach global viewers,” said Zhu.\n\nHowever, costume dramas, as one of the earliest genres to attract overseas audiences, such as the 1986 TV series Journey to the West, continue to be the most popular type of Chinese television drama in the international market.\n\nA report from the giant streamer Youku reveals that Chinese costume dramas have been translated into a total of 16 foreign languages, including English, Spanish, and Arabic, and distributed on multiple Youku overseas platforms, reaching over 200 countries and regions from April 2022 to July 2023.\n\nWang Qiao, senior president of New Classics Media, a Beijing-based production company with rich experience in overseas markets, highlights that costume dramas predominantly captivate audiences in Asia, such as Japan and South Korea, due to cultural affinity, along with a significant following among overseas Chinese communities in the United States.\n\nWith the flourishing development of the Chinese television industry, some domestic stars have already gained a fan base overseas.\n\nChinese production companies can now promote their shows in international markets in advance, all of which create better conditions for Chinese dramas to go global, he added.\n\nThe Legend of Shen Li, a fantasy depicting the love story of two celestial beings, was promoted a year prior to its late-March debut in Southeast Asia. This marked the second collaboration between actress Zhao Liying and actor Lin Gengxin, who portray lovers with a tumultuous fate in this captivating narrative.\n\nTheir on-screen chemistry, previously showcased in the widely acclaimed Princess Agents, has swiftly garnered the attention of foreign fans as exemplified by Wang.\n\nAs one of the latest costume dramas to make a splash in the global market, Joy of Life 2 — a tale filled with twists blending alternative history and sci-fi elements — has set a record by becoming the most-watched Chinese mainland drama on Disney’s streaming platform Disney+.\n\nFollowing the success of Joy of Life’s first season, which was released in 27 countries and regions, the second season — revealing the further adventures of the protagonist with a mysterious background — has gained popularity in various markets, including North America and Europe, according to Wang.\n\nIn addition, science fiction is also emerging as a new frontier for domestic dramas to go global.\n\nIn February, the Chinese sci-fi series Three-Body, adapted from Liu Cixin’s Hugo Award-winning novel The Three-Body Problem, released all 30 episodes at once on Peacock, NBCUniversal’s streaming service.\n\nThe show made its debut domestically last January, over one year ahead of Netflix’s 3 Body Problem.\n\nThis move is seen as a positive signal, encouraging Chinese creators of science fiction, a genre that has gained momentum in the country with recent successful works like The Wandering Earth franchise, to produce more quality and innovative series to captivate global viewers, said Chen Liuqi, deputy secretary general of the Science Popularization Education Committee of the China Science Writers Association.\n\nShe commented that the streaming of Three-Body on a major North American streaming platform offers an opportunity for Western audiences to delve into modern China and its sci-fi narratives, deeply rooted in the nation’s unique cultures and values.\n\n“Chinese science fiction, with its captivating fusion of rich history, profound cultural insights and speculative philosophical traditions, encapsulates a distinctive societal and ethical perspective,” said Chen.\n\n“Moreover, rooted in Chinese traditional values that emphasize harmony between science, technology and nature, Chinese sci-fi stories have shaped their distinctive characteristics to differ from their Western counterparts,” she added.\n\nDespite challenges such as cultural differences and the need to expand to more overseas distribution networks, a promising landscape is unfolding in the realm of Chinese television, suggesting a future where C-dramas secure a substantial share of the global TV market, a view shared by the insiders contacted by China Daily."
