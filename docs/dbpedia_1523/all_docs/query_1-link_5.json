        "text": "TVBS Weekly (Week 518)\n\nIt's the first time Angela Chang acts in a teen idol comedy drama \"Romantic Princess\", it's isn't strange that she's donned in beautiful princess clothing. This time round, she even has a bathroom scene and also tried many funny images, like wearing the bear, maid, gardener costumes. She even tied two buns wearing ancient clothing. She faces audiences which thinks that she couldn't act comedy roles, but she tries her very best to prove that she could be funny as well.\n\nBefore \"Romantic Princess\" was aired, leads Wu Zun and Angela Chang were afraid that ratings and their performance won't be good. But their worries were different. Because of the popularity and success of Hana Kimi, he's afraid that \"Romantic Princess\" won't be able to get good ratings like Hana Kimi. And Angela faces the challenge of audiences thinking that she couldn't act comedy roles. But luckily, the ratings were good and thus were relieved.\n\nTo prove that she could act in comedy roles, Angela tried many kinds of images, being a pretty princess and other images to suit her role. In the script, she has to earn money and she has to wear a bear costume in the hot sun. And whilst acting a imaginary scene, she had to wear ancient clothing for the first time. Though she's wearing ancient clothing, she also tied two buns which made her look like a village lady. Because in the drama, she has to pay her 5 million NT debt to her grandpa, she works as a maid, gardener to earn money. Everyone thinks that she looks cute in the maid costume.\n\nAngela acts two roles in the drama because she acted as Xiao Mai's mom who passed away. Whilst acting as a mother, she had a kid in her arms which is also the lead actress Angela herself. A lot of viewers who saw the little kid thought that the huge eyes looks like Angela. In actual fact, the kid is Fahrenheit's manager's baby boy. When they filmed the scene, the little boy is only 1 year 1 month old.\n\nAlthough he's only one 1 year 1 month old, but he's a very healthy baby weighing 12 kg. Angela kept saying that he's so cute while carrying him. But when filming, she couldn't help but complain that her arms were aching while carrying him because she's very thin herself. Not only dressing in different images, she also has a bathroom scene and reveals her thigh and almost her whole bum to show the birthmark.\n\nThere will definitely be romantic and beautiful scenes in idol dramas. There is one scene where Wu Zun and Angela were at flower room in \"Yuan Lai Hotel\". The scene was so romantic that everyone envies. Many netizens feel that Wu Zun and Angela is very compatible, hoping that they will be together. Although we don't know whether they have developed any feelings for each other, but in the drama, there's definitely many romantic and lovey dovey scenes. There is one scene where Angela cries and Wu Zun lends his shoulder for her to cry on, which slowly develops ambiguous feelings for each other. Later on Angela will fall for Wu Zun first and Wu Zun will then show his love for her.\n\nTalking about liking the opposite sex, Angela mentions \"There must be feelings when finding a guy, when she thinks he's suitable then she will accept him, but I prefer guys who are caring, the guy must not be a chauvinist.\" Wu Zun also thinks that the feel is important, he mentions that he only acted with three female artists, Ella, Angela and Ariel. And everyone didn't let him go and asked him if these 3 female artists fell into the sea, who will he save first? Wu Zun laughed \"What kind of question is this? Of course it's Angela! Because she's the lightest and it's easier to save her!\" And at this moment, the atmosphere is left with ambiguity and alittle embarrassing!\n\nTranslation by Starylosophy\n\nCredits: marukoisme.blog17.fc2.com"
