        "text": "Princess Jellyfish / 海月姫 [Kurage hime] (2018)\n\n[10 episodes, approx. 45 mins each]\n\nDirector: Junichi Ishikawa\n\nWriter: Yuichi Tokunaga\n\nCast: Kyoko Yoshine, Koji Seto, Asuka Kudo, Haruka Kinami, Rio Uchida, Rena Matsui, Eriko Tomiyami, Rika Izumi, Jun Kaname\n\nJapanese w/ English subtitles\n\nThis is based on a manga by Akiko Higashimura and has been adapted into different mediums. I first discovered the story when I watched the live action movie (2014), which I enjoyed a lot. Then some time later I watched the anime series which was originally released in 2010 and I also liked it. Despite being released much later, the live action movie covered more or less the same amount of story as the anime series. However, in both cases the manga series was still in progress and had not yet been completed. This meant that certain subplots like the romance were left unresolved.\n\nI was surprised to discover this recent live action TV drama adaptation. The main advantage that this adaptation had going for it is that it had access to the story of the whole manga series which completed its run in 2017. I have never read the manga (although I definitely want to) but I think if you’re a fan of the anime or film then you’ll definitely want to check out this drama because it goes much farther into the story. By the end of episode 4 and into episode 5, the series has pretty much covered the story that was shown in the anime and the film.\n\nThe group of female otakus including the main protagonist and jellyfish lover, Tsukimi, have a much tougher fight in saving the building they live in, Amamizukan, from destruction and redevelopment. They also face more challenges in making jellyfish dresses in order to make money in an attempt to buy the Amamizukan. I like that the female otakus and Tsukimi take the initiative more often. The male crossdresser Kuranosuke is still a major motivator but the female otakus seems noticeably less passive. Kuranosuke himself is also affected and changed by the female otakus.\n\nThe theme of self acceptance while still improving oneself and gaining just a little bit more courage is a heartwarming message that is well executed. The otakus are social misfits that don’t belong in “normal” society but the narrative doesn’t present their interests as something they need to change or abandon. They are extreme and exaggerated although I could still empathize with them. Pretty much every character grows a bit in some way. It’s believable and earned. Kuranosuke’s half brother, Shu, also seems to be nicer here as he doesn’t seem to show any disdain for Kuranosuke’s crossdressing. He helps him and Tsukimi out multiple times.\n\nRomance is not the focus of the series but it gets some development here and a clear cut resolution. The love triangle between Shu, Tsukimi and Kuranosuke isn’t full of confrontation and both brothers have their positive traits. You can predict who ultimately ends up together but it’s not immediately obvious at the beginning.\n\nThe acting is good although it took me an episode or two to really warm up to the leads. I’d say the actors act in a less exaggerated manner than the anime characters or the live action film actors. The exaggeration level here is still fairly typical of manga adaptations so it’s something to be aware of if you aren’t familiar with the tone of these types of comedic shows. While I don’t feel this drama is as funny as the film or anime series, I still enjoyed it a lot. It certainly has more emotional impact and a satisfying if brief resolution to the romance. A couple of late additions to the cast who act as antagonists kind of drag things out a bit and their characters are underdeveloped. They’re more like a plot device but it’s a minor grievance. I felt happy for all the characters by the end of this series. This is a heartwarming and recommended watch.\n\nHere’s one of the theme songs, “A New Day” by Beverly.\n\nAnd here’s the song used during the opening credits, カフェラテ噴水公園 feat.にゃんこスター『Goサインは１コイン』."
