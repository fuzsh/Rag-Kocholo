        "text": "Hey …is there a romantic drama where both the guy and girl are rich ?\n\nIm kinda bored of watching dramas of a poor girl/Rich guy\n\n@raeesaglass786_761\n\nI can’t recall anything where there is a rich pairing - and I do not watch that many Taiwanese dramas …\n\nFor other countries - I will think about it …\n\nWould rich girl - poor guy be an option for you?\n\nNoona/dongsaeng?\n\nOr were status isn’t all that?\n\nCan you answer some (personal) questions …\n\nHow old are you?\n\nAre there some untypical dramas you like?\n\nYour 3 favorite dramas?\n\nKorean romance:\n\nRich Girl/Poor Guy.\n\nCloud Stairs, Couple of Fantasy (either you’ll like it or hate it), Ms. Temper and Nam Jung Gi, Prosecutor Princess, Queen In Hyun’s Man, Smile You, Soulmate,\n\nThe mixed bag/ a genre-mix:\n\nBeyond the Clouds, Flowers of My Life, Glorious Day, Goblin, Ho Goo’s Love, I Remember You, Perhaps Love, King of Dramas, Mama, Miss Korea, My Love Madame Butterfly, On the Way to The Airport, Padam Padam, Plus Nine Boys, Powerful Opponents, Pride and Prejudice, Shut Up Flower Boy Band, The Greatest Wedding, What’s Up?, What’s Up Fox?, Will it Snow at Christmas?,\n\nA touch of melo, is what you are looking for\n\nMy first recommandation to you would be this one, it sad and it is not your regular drama\n\nhttps://www.viki.com/tv/26416c-fools-love\n\nCloud Stairs might be an option too, but not on Viki as far as I know, about a fresh love with zero chances as it may seem\n\nThis is one of my favoirtes, I liked this one a lot not your usual music drama\n\nhttps://www.viki.com/tv/6476c-shut-up-flower-boy-band\n\nA different type of drama, there is some rich and poor family involvement as well but the topic is the illness of the child and her next family members\n\nhttps://www.viki.com/tv/23991c-thank-you\n\nMaybe a bit traditional but still, one of the best weekend dramas I ever saw\n\nhttps://www.viki.com/tv/1274c-giant\n\nOne of the few Taiwanese dramas I saw in the last years\n\nhttps://www.viki.com/tv/26573c-someone-like-you\n\nThe K2. The female lead is a daughter of presidential candidate so of course she’s not poor. And the male lead is a hired bodyguard so of course he has a decent income. Those from my own speculation.\n\nStrong Woman Do Bong Soon, the female lead works in the big company with decent income. The male lead is a C.E.O.\n\nChief Kim, all of the leads in this drama works in office with stable income. No one is poor.\n\nRomantic Doctor Kim, both of the leads are doctors so of course they are rich.\n\nMasked Lover: female lead is an interior designer, male lead is a cop. So both of them is not poor."
