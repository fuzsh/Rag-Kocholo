        "text": "Triad Princess is a 2019 NETFLIX Original Taiwanese drama that stars Jasper Liu and Eugenie Liu as leads. It has six episodes. Synopsis: Growing up in the shadows of her triad boss father, Angie Ni craves an independent life of her own. Angie decides to defy her father‚Äôs wishes and runs away from home. She takes on a gig as an undercover bodyguard for a famous actress. She must learn to navigate the unfamiliar world of glitz, glamour, and even love.\n\nExpectations: I‚Äôve had this drama on my watch list for a while now, and since I haven‚Äôt been feeling motivated to do much, I decided to give it a go yesterday night. My main reason for seeing this series is Jasper Liu. Most of his dramas are great, so I had high hopes.\n\n(warning ‚Äì minor spoilers ahead)\n\nReview:\n\nOverall, Triad Princess was an okay show. The story progression wasn‚Äôt excellent, but it was fun to watch. This was a six episodes series; hence everything happened fast. The main actors did their best with the script and time they had.\n\nMy favourite aspect of this series was the comedic action scenes. Eugenie did a great job portraying Angie Ni. She was believable as someone who grew up in a gang. On the other hand, Jasper Liu‚Äôs character Yi Hang felt flat. There wasn‚Äôt much depth to him; therefore, I couldn‚Äôt flow with his actions 100%.\n\nThere were at least three primary story arcs in this drama. If I am to rank them according to personal preference, I will choose the actress Ling Yun and her blackmailing ex-boyfriend as number one. It was nice to see a character that wasn‚Äôt perfect from the get-go. She made mistakes and tried her best to make something better of her life. From the look of things, I believe there‚Äôs going to be a season two, so I hope she finds her son and finally rids herself of the troublesome ex-boyfriend. Also, I appreciate her friendship with Angie. A great representation of female companies without any toxicity or betrayal.\n\nMy second-ranked arc is that of the main couple, Angie Ni and Yi Hang. They had chemistry, but their love story progressed too quickly. This is undoubtedly due to them having only six episodes. Some of this couple‚Äôs scenes were cheesy and corny, most especially the airport scene at the end. They also had a few misunderstandings here and there, but it looks like they got back together at the end of the series. I chose them as second because I see potential from both actors in making a tremendous onscreen couple. I only hope that the writer and director do a better job with the next season‚Äôs storytelling.\n\nThe last arc that I kind of cared for is that of the talent manager, Sophia Kwong. Her story with her ex-husband and their child was quite sad. However, I still found her a bit too controlling with her artists‚Äô personal life. I get that it‚Äôs show biz, but she isn‚Äôt giving her artists enough freedom to be their authentic selves. Maybe that‚Äôs why Ling Yun couldn‚Äôt open up to her about her past.\n\nAny other character or story arc in the drama did not matter much to me because they weren‚Äôt captivating enough. I found myself skipping a lot of scenes. Hence I can say that although I enjoyed watching Triad Princess, it lacked substance. It isn‚Äôt the best quality drama I have seen, but I wouldn‚Äôt mind watching the second season just for the story arcs I mentioned above.\n\nMy rating for Triad Princess is 6.5/10.
