        "text": "Launched on August 16, Dream Raider is among a rising number of Taiwanese TV drama series that have surprised audiences and critics over the past few years. Of the around 40 TV series productions in Taiwan last year, a combined 15 were co-produced by US studios HBO, Netflix and Fox, according to mainland Chinese media site Movie Information Office (Dian Ying Qing Bao Chu).\n\nThe trend of large foreign studios doing co-productions with local Taiwanese producers started in 2016, when HBO Asia teamed up with Taiwan’s Public Television Service (PTS) to make The Teenage Psychic . Revolving around the adventures of a girl who can communicate with the supernatural, it was HBO’s first TV series in Chinese.\n\nThe show broke viewership records in Taiwan and became HBO Asia’s most viewed original Asian TV series in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Even Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen recommended the show on her Facebook page.\n\nThe Victims’ Game has proved the most popular. Starring Joseph Chang Hsiao-chuan and Hsu Wei-ning, the show overtook several popular Korean drama series to be the most-viewed TV series on Netflix in Taiwan in May. Rated 8 out of 10 on mainland Chinese review site Douban, The Victims’ Game portrays how a forensic scientist with Asperger’s syndrome gets entwined with a case involving his daughter.\n\nFox’s first foray into original Chinese drama was The Trading Floor (2018), about Hong Kong’s finance industry. The series was a co-production between Hong Kong singer Andy Lau Tak-wah’s Focus Group and Tencent Penguin Pictures. Fox’s first original Taiwanese drama was The Missing Half (2019).\n\nThe company’s breakout Taiwanese hit was romance drama Someday or One Day (2019), a time-travelling romance story that is rated 9.2 out of 10 on Douban. Racking up plaudits in both mainland China and Taiwan, the series brought overnight stardom to its male lead Greg Hsu Kuang-han. Critics said the show is much more than a formulaic love drama as it touches on sensitive topics such as domestic violence and the bullying of sexual minorities.\n\nIn a February interview with mainland Chinese media, Someday or One Day’s producer Ma Yi-ting cited the lack of censorship and government support in Taiwan as factors in the recent success of Taiwan’s television industry.\n\n“In Taiwan, unlike on the mainland, scripts do not need to be sent to the authorities for approval. [There are also subsidies offered by the government]. Like when shooting Someday or One Day in Tainan, we can apply for accommodation subsidies. The local [officials] will also help with liaising about shooting venues, which will be offered for us to use for free or at a lower price,” he said.\n\nFor HBO, another big Taiwanese hit was The World Between Us (2019). Co-produced by Taiwanese producer CatchPlay and the PTS, the show about the aftermath of a mass shooting became the third most popular TV series in the history of the PTS.\n\nWith a rating of 9.4 out of 10 on Douban, the show was described as the best Chinese drama series in 2019 by mainland Chinese critics. Prompted by a series of random killings in Taiwan in the 2010s, the show explores the senseless crimes’ psychological repercussions for the victims’ families, the perpetrators and their families, as well as defence lawyers and the media alike.\n\nSeries producer Lin Yu-ling says that its success has to do with its gritty themes. “The show explores multiple themes, including the media, legal system, [the phenomenon of] trolling and psychiatric illnesses. Such themes are closely related to people’s lives.”\n\nLin adds that the participation of international studios has provided the industry with more capital and given it room to venture beyond uniform genres like romance. “The market of Taiwan is small, which makes it difficult [for TV producers] to break even. The revenue of those international platforms helps increase the production scale of TV shows.”\n\nYu Pei-hua, director of PTS’ programming department, told Singaporean newspaper Lianhe Zaobao last year that the success of The World Between Us shows that Taiwanese drama series have finally rebounded from their “low point” of lacking diversity, referring to the plethora of pop-idol-driven romance series that reigned in the 2000s.\n\nThat all started with the huge success of Meteor Garden (2001) and its sequel Meteor Garden II (2002), starring the four heartthrobs from Taiwanese boy band F4. Afterwards, numerous TV producers flocked to use the same formula of creating romance hits featuring pop stars. Subsequent hits include At the Dolphin Bay (2003), The Prince Who Turns into a Frog (2005) and Autumn’s Concerto (2009).\n\nAccording to Baidu Baike, China’s answer to Wikipedia, the number of Taiwanese pop-idol-driven drama series shot from 20 in 2010 to 50 in 2011. But the boom times driven by these series did not last. The mainland Chinese entertainment industry started to shell out huge sums of money to make their own shows, tempting many Taiwanese producers and artists to come over in search of better opportunities. Among those who upped sticks was director Chen Ming-zhang, whose works include The Prince Who Turns into a Frog and Fated to Love You (2008).\n\nWhat followed was a period of little to shout about in the Taiwanese television industry that lasted for much of the mid-2010s. Its recent renaissance comes as a huge relief to industry players.\n\nJason Wang Shih-sian, who plays a detective in The Victims’ Game and a neuroscientist in Dream Raider, says that the support of international studios has expanded the range of roles available to Taiwanese actors.\n\n“Their participation is definitely a good thing for us. It’s the first time for me to play such a role,” he says of his character in Dream Raider, who invented the dream-raiding machine in the story.\n\n“The scientist is stubborn, unsociable, withdrawn and has a big passion for science. There is a lot of [neurology] terminology in the dialogue. I need to understand the meaning of those words before reciting them … I learned a lot from taking part in the series.”\n\nThis article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Taiwanese dramas boosted by tie-ups with U.S. studios give Taiwanese dramas new hope"
