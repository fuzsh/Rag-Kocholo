        "meta_description": "While seriality has long been associated with broadcast and cable television, the global rise of online streaming has brought development of what I call platformized seriality: assemblages of online platform infrastructure design, content regulation, generic convention, and experimentation. The notion of platformized seriality points to a complex refiguration of specific media content and genre forms that are usually overlooked in platform studies. This essay analyzes time-travel serials—now immensely popular in the context of China’s growing video-streaming industry, convergence culture, and the financial boom of digital platforms. Analyzing the trope of the female time traveler in historical romance, this essay examines how chuanyue, or the Chinese time-travel genre, subtly unsettles contemporary gender-related anxiety and the dominant discourse on development and progress, something that partly explains the pleasure it generates. The genre of chuanyue benefited from the rise of platform infrastructure designs such as bullet screens and pay-on-demand-in-advance services that direct new forms of audience engagement and new practices of binge-watching. Focusing on the fantasy genre and the mutability of the time traveler’s gender, sexuality, and class, I explore how the trope of traveling backward marks a reconfiguration of conceptions of time, space, and history and thus opens a space to negotiate with the neoliberal narratives of linear and progressivist temporality.",

        "text": "Seriality has long been associated with the predominant narrative mode of network television.1 The global rise of online streaming platforms has brought new practices of seriality online. With the rise of subscription video-on-demand services such as Netflix, Amazon, Tencent, and other branded television content, originally produced content has been increasingly important.2 These new services offering quality television via video-on-demand have facilitated new modes of watching such as binge-watching, which is a deliberate, self-scheduled alternative to the conventional television-watching experience.3 Intersecting existing literature on television studies and platform studies, in this essay, I examine the operations of what I call platformized seriality, which are assemblages of online platform infrastructure, content regulation, generic convention, and experimentation. Specifically, I explore the exemplary short history of the chuanyue, or Chinese time-travel genre, to demonstrate the logic of platformized seriality, including the genre’s short period of popularity on prime-time television, its ban by the Chinese government, and its later revitalization on online streaming platforms.\n\nThe revival of time-travel serials typifies the impact of complex Internet fandom and media convergence. Platformized seriality makes narrative experimentation or diversification more flexible, as evident in the trope of the female time traveler who, compared to the male traveler, better articulates contemporary gender politics and collective anxiety and appeals to the female audience. The theme of traveling backward manifests a reconfiguration of the conceptions of time, space, and history and thus opens a space to negotiate with the neoliberal narratives of linear and progressivist temporality, which, I believe, is one of the reasons behind this genre’s unpopularity with Chinese officials. Focusing on the fantastical genre and its rendering of the gender, sexuality, and (im)mutability of the time traveler, I explore the trope of traveling backward from the present in the framework of China’s neoliberal acceleration and its century-long revolutionary conceit of “moving forward.” While these TV shows are usually dismissed as “superficial, vulgar, and infantile” by critics and government officials in China, this subgenre of time traveling to the past can also be read as a fantasy of gender relations and historical imagination.\n\nAfter outlining the significance of platformized seriality and its contribution to existing discussions on seriality and streaming in the Chinese context, I elaborate on platformized seriality in three aspects. First, platformized seriality revitalized time-travel serials, made possible by the rise of convergence culture and the financial boom of digital platforms seeking original content despite its higher risk of content regulation and censorship. Second, platformized seriality is evident in various forms of the time-travel narrative, especially the gendered genres such as historical romance. Third, platformized seriality highlights how platform infrastructure directs audience engagement in the serial form with functions such as bullet screen and pay-on-demand-in-advance that raise expectations for the script’s seriality.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am grateful to the insightful and helpful feedback from Ellen Seiter and the two anonymous reviewers.
