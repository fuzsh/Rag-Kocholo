        "text": "Star Wars is for everybody. Okay who are we kidding, lately it feels like Star Wars isn’t for anybody. But not too long ago, (and also a long time ago) Star Wars was for everybody. …wasn’t it?\n\nYou’re five years old. Star Wars comes out in theaters and your immigrant parents who can’t afford childcare take you to see it, probably to the chagrin of whomever it is you’re sitting next to. But boy are you glad they did. It busts your mind wide open. You can’t wait to tell everyone at school. Before long, everyone is talking about it and playing it at recess. You and Katie Mitchell, and Marc and Chucky gather on the playground with visions of laser swords and blasters and droids in your collective imaginations. The adventures you’ll have.\n\n“I’ll play Princess Leia.” Says Katie.\n\n“Great, I’ll play Han.” You say.\n\n“You can’t play Han.” Says Marc. “Han has brown hair. Like me. I’ll play Han.”\n\n…Okay. “I’ll play Luke then.” You say.\n\n“You can’t play Luke.” Says Chucky. “Luke has blonde hair. Like me.”\n\n…Hm. Okay. “Then who should I play?”\n\n“You can play Chewie.” They say.\n\nChewie. Who has brown hair.\n\nYou don’t know it yet, but years down the way you’ll have a word for this: microaggression. Till then you’ll simply recognize it as an exclusion of convenience. You’ll recognize it later in life too when out of the blue your shoulders tense up or your breathing gets labored, or your heart rate increases when someone tells you somebody else should do something you’re qualified to do too. Meanwhile everyone else goes on with their day. This will be a theme. Eventually you’ll also come to recognize that no one is born thinking something isn’t for them. They are told that repeatedly until they decide it is easiest not to disagree. You wonder how if something is for you, it is any less for you when it is also for someone else.\n\nBut that’s not true, they’ll tell you in high school when you study Joseph Campbell. It is the classic hero’s journey. Universal in its theme and immediately recognizable to all. Also, it’s science fiction. It’s absolutely for you. (They won’t know that it’s really a Western- neither will you till much later.) Years after they insist Star Wars is for you, you’ll be given a word for why they see something one way and you see it another. (Unconscious bias) Or more to the point, why they have no context to see what you’re seeing. And you’ll lose nights of sleep wondering how to get them to open their eyes. Because fucking Chewbacca had brown hair too.\n\nBefore any of that though, you’ll discover comic books and video games. You’ll see all of your friends go gaga over the same transforming robots your grandparents and cousins used to show you whenever you visited them overseas. And you’ll think maybe it’s okay to like this? Spider-Man wore a mask. It could have been anyone under there. Maybe it’s okay to like that? But then in Secret Wars 8, when Reed Richards repairs Iron Man’s armor, they have a three bubble conversation about Rhodey’s black skin, and if it was surprising to see a Black man under the armor. Reed Richards, one of the smartest men in the Marvel Universe will of course not see color. It’ll make you feel a little better, but yellow skin isn’t even part of the conversation so just to be safe you’ll decide to stick to Spider-Man.\n\nYou finally get to high school and they’ll call you oversensitive and laugh you off. They’ll also call you Chink when you inadvertently over-step into their realm of privilege. And sometimes, they’ll be afraid of you. But that won’t be satisfying either, because they won’t be afraid of you for your very real, very palpable rage. They’ll be afraid of you because they think you know karate. Which itself is rage inducing because a) you don’t, b) you aren’t Japanese, and c) they could give a fuck either way. So your quiet rage gets quietly amplified. Lost in the cacophony of Short Rounds, Long Duck Dongs, Mr. Miyagis…Not all of them will be that insensitive though. Your quadruple-bypass, so-old-he-has-Jesus’-beeper-number, Social Studies teacher who looks like Santa Claus and is actually named Mr. White will see your tennis racket and say “Are you gonna be as good as Michael Chang one day?” He’ll mean it as an encouragement, but all you’ll notice is he didn’t think you’d ever want to be as good as Agassi or Sampras. You will have no idea how to unpack that for a long, long time. Fucking Chewbacca.\n\nIn college you’ll have finally learned to downplay questions like “where are you really from” only to realize that when people in New York City ask you that, it’s because they’re actually curious about your second culture. They want to celebrate how you are not the same as them, and want you to celebrate how they are not the same as you. To you it’s the silent, biological death-sentence you spent the last eighteen years trying to distance yourself from. To them it will be something great. You’ll start to wonder if maybe it is. You’ll go to a screening of Jackie Chan’s First Strike. Dubbed in English, with Jackie doing his own lines. Your overseas family will have been talking about him for a decade by then, but you won’t have given a shit about it until his breakthrough here in the states after Rumble in the Bronx and Supercop become cult favorites. In one scene of the film that does not involve martial arts stunts of any kind, just a beautiful woman talking to a handsome man, you’ll start to cry uncontrollably. In the theater. Because you’ll realize this is the first time you’ve ever seen people who looked like you on a big screen talk about anything in English that wasn’t martial arts or being from somewhere else. You’ll deeply love it for what it is but feel an ache about it too. Because you’ll understand on some level that this wasn’t made for you either. It was made for the people who laugh at you when they hear your busted Mandarin.\n\nBy now you’ll have starred in your first independent feature- the first of two that will go nowhere and do nothing for your fledgling acting career. (Though many of your costars from both and even one First AD will go on to be in big, badass things- I’m looking at you Nelson Lee.) And you'll start to piece together something that, years down the line people will call Institutional Racism. And even though it troubles you that your enemy doesn’t have a face, or even yet a name, you’ll kind of gloss over it. Because by then you’ll have found your tribe and Star Wars will be cool again. At least to everyone you play with. Anyway, fuck Chewbacca.\n\nYou’ll decide that even if nothing is really ever for you, and the reasons behind why are myriad and Machiavellian, there’s something you actually can do: make things that are. One of your directors will say “Ask yourself what you want to see that no one else is making. Make that.” You’ll let that be your compass for the next twenty years. You’ll write for people who look like you before it was cool. You’ll insist on working with female directors before it was cool. In that twenty years a lot of things change. Politics change, demographics change, your own worldview changes. You’ll recognize how much of a racist you yourself have always been. You’ll see that you got it from your parents, your family, your church and literally every white student you went to school with. You’ll wonder how anyone ever decolonizes their thinking at all when there’s literally no one around to reflect truth to them. Then you’ll realize you yourself did it and you’ll wonder how anyone couldn’t. You’ll see colleagues workshopping their shows at universities. You’ll be sad you’ll never get to do that because what conservatory has six to ten Asian performers who would be featured in anything you wrote? (Though eventually you too will get to do that!). Somewhere in there Fox will launch the X-Men film franchise and you’ll be reunited with old friends. Only instead of communing with them in a dark basement, you’ll commune with them in a dark theater with Dolby surround sound. Hugh Jackman will say “bub” and everyone will talk about it like they know. You won’t call anyone out on their fair-weather fandom because in one sense you yourself were a fair weather fan.\n\nEventually they’ll make movies for Transformers, and GI Joe and even though they won’t be good, they’ll be cool because they exist. You feel comfortable claiming them because no one else wants to. (They’ll make new Star Wars films too, but maybe the less said about those the better.) Before you know it the Marvel Cinematic Universe spends ten years redefining popular culture and you (and your wife and daughter) are there for it. You buy a ticket opening weekend of Shang-Chi knowing full well that with an unvaccinated child at home you won’t be seeing the film. You just want your dollar to be counted. You’ll give away your ticket on the Buy-Nothing Facebook community. You’ll have no regrets. Your wife, god love her, will insist that you be a part of this conversation though. And lets you go see it at 9:30pm on a Wednesday. There are six people in the theater. It doesn’t get much safer.\n\nYou immediately post: “I thought about writing an essay on the significance of Shang Chi. And I may still. But at the end of the day all that really matters is literally every frame of this film was made for me and that's never happened before in my life and fuck anyone who says representation doesn't matter.”\n\nIt gets around two hundred likes when you decide “Maybe I should write that essay after all.”\n\nYou can’t stop thinking about this film. Is it Winter-Soldier-levels of perfect? Nah. Is it Black-Panther-levels of world-changing? Nope. But it’s yours. It’s all yours. It’s yours because your mother has gifted you jade and you held on to it in its tiny cotton pouch for as long as you remember. It’s yours because when she passes down jewelry she also passes down ghost stories. Family members who are visited upon by dragons and spirits. Your legacy to claim. It’s yours because you too have gone years without speaking to your sibling and if you found yourself in an actual cage match with him as you often wished in your youth, you’d probably do something unnecessarily dramatic. (We’re cool now, chill.) It’s yours because only a few people know your Chinese name and recognize how deeply fitting it is for you. They’ll know it as your secret identity. They’ll know there’s no telling if the name conjured you or if you conjured the name. It’s yours because when you told dad you won the Richard Rodgers that one year his response was “…neat.” And that was progress. And when you told mom you were invited to speak at your high school graduation in 2019 her response was “Your father did that too.” It’s yours because the rest of that night was spent talking about their past instead of your future. Because to them there’s no difference. It’s yours because you were never Long Duck Dong, you were never Short Round, you were never Mr. Miyagi even when people said you were. It’s yours because you were never fucking Chewbacca, even when people said you were. You were Indiana Jones. You were Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. You were Peter Parker. You were Daniel-san. You were Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. And yes, you were Michael Chang too when you wanted to be. And now nobody’s saying nothing.\n\nHow do you solve a bias with ideas? How do you catch and burn the system down? How do you plug conceptual diarrheas? You curate the coolest cabaret in town.\n\nI’m sitting at the Citizen M hotel lobby- I sit here a lot. And I write about sitting here a lot. It’s a cool place where cool people have cool ideas. Take Ellarose Chary. My good friend, colleague and co-contributing editor to Musical Theater Today. Flip around, you’ll find her work. I’ll wait. What you won’t find in this tome is an article she wrote for the Lillys in 2016 called Is the Pipeline a Pipe Dream for Emerging Women Musical Theater Writers? Which takes a stark look at gender inequality in awards-winning. The article itself exploded my social media feed four years ago when it went live and is one of many reasons she’s a rock star. But more on that later. Right now, I have many questions about Tank-aret, the monthly showcase series she and collaborator Brandon James Gwinn co-curate for The Tank.\n\nTH Tell me about Tank-aret.\n\nEC So that started because I was/am good friends with Rosalind Grush who was at the time the co-artistic director at the Tank. I’ve known Rosalind for a long time. She has since gone on to other new adventures, having shepherded the Tank from their big move from the small space on 46th St. to the bigger space on 36th where they are now, and they had two theaters and more equipment to do music and cabaret. And Rosalind went to a cabaret event that someone invited her to downtown and she said to me casually off-hand, “I was at this cabaret event on Monday night and I thought ‘who goes to things on a Monday night? Oh Cabaret!” And so she asked me if I knew anyone who would want to do cabaret at the Tank. I said “Rosalind, I know one or two hundred people who want to do cabaret at the Tank. But you can’t just do that, there needs to be a way\n\nTH Like an angle?\n\nEC You need way to weed out- like they have curators. They have a dance curator. I thought they needed a cabaret curator. Because you can’t just do it.\n\nTH Well, you could…\n\nEC You could. But I wouldn’t recommend it. And then I was mentioning to Brandon and said “who should we give her to help with that? Because someone should help with that.” And Brandon was the one who said “ we should put our money where our mouth is and we should do it.” And I thought we didn’t have time for that. And they can’t pay us…. And we were trying to do the right thing, and he said “All we ever do is bitch about all the people we know who don’t get the opportunities that we want, and all these other cabaret series that are boring New Yorker, cis white…\n\nTH I love New York, it’s such a great town, and it’s dirty but I have my dreams and you love me…\n\nEC And that is not a dig at the many cabaret series around town that I love. Because I love those.\n\nTH Do you? I don’t.\n\nEC I have a great deal of affection for New York Theater Barn.\n\nTH Ooooooh… I wouldn’t consider that cabaret.\n\nEC Oh, interesting. Okay. Well that’s what I think of it.\n\nTH Okay. Great. Now we’re triangulated.\n\nEC Yeah, so it’s not a dig at their new works, which I’ve done many of, and which your wife [former NYTB Associate Artistic Director Laura Brandel] had a hand in. We just felt like it’s really hard to get a chance to do them. We had been thinking about doing Joe’s Pub, and Brandon does the Duplex all the time and we’re looking at these and see that it’s really expensive when you’re coming up-but it’s the first opportunity that I had when I moved to New York, it was the first opportunity that both of us had. It gets you video. It’s this thing to do.\n\nTH I literally fell in love with someone there.\n\nEC So we started to think about the Tank, and what that is, as a venue people already recognize, and so we thought “maybe it should just not be cis white men.” And we should just get people to do this, and it wasn’t really going to be for us. It wasn’t meant to be an opportunity for us- we were just going to go find people that we know. And the first year was very much me being “who are people that I know?” Like Dyan Flores. I said “I know you have a project. I know you haven’t finished it. I really want it to exist and be on stage” so I went up to her and said “I’m giving you a spot. You have to finish your Rahm Emanuel musical so that I can watch it.” So there was that. And then there was Brandon making lists of artists that he knew because he knows of the musical theater people. And so he’d say “it’d be really interesting to have that person do a solo show. Or be given more space than they’re usually given.”\n\nTH I love that.\n\nEC The Tank’s thing is to give us safe space to bite off more than we can chew. The thing for underrepresented artists is always that we don’t get second chances right? You don’t get to develop anything. We have to be good the first time. [Playwright] Marcus Scott said this. He had a 54 Below show not long after his Tank-aret so he got to go very confidently into 54 Below. And that’s what we want. We want people who are not felt empowered to put something together, so we could say “here’s a thing, go do it.” Or we want someone who needs an opportunity. It doesn’t have to be a halfway point, it can be the thing. So we took it to Megan Finn and Rosalind and said “this is what we’d like it to be and what we want to do” and they said “You guys want to do that? Obviously we would like you to do that, we never dreamed that you would be willing to!” And we knew it was crazy but we also knew it should be a thing. So we figured out with them how to do it such that it wouldn’t be too much of a burden on us, and defined what would be expected of the artists. The first year we were more hands on because we really wanted it to fly, but going into our third year now, we have enough artists where we are looking into producing a showcase night where artists who don’t have a full night of material can do ten minutes. So for those, we take on the producorial responsibilities.\n\nTH It seems to me though that if everyone else is benefitting from this platform you’ve created, maybe there’s no harm in you benefiting from it too. Have you and Brandon done one?\n\nEC That first year we did do one for ourselves. We needed content for the series, and had just been given a grant to do a concert of TL;DR [Thelma and Louise: Dyke Rock] so we did do it and counted it as a Tank-aret, but then afterward we decided “this is not for us. We both have opportunities. We don’t need to take up one of these slots.” Though I did do one this year with two fledgling writers which was more on-mission and really needed to be a date on a calendar. So there isn’t a purity there where we can’t program ourselves. We definitely will if we need to, but we’ve discussed this before- one of the things that is both wonderful and maddening to me is how easy it is for me to program this. It’s wonderful because I can, in minutes and without any research, come up with a list of twenty five people that I want to ask, for twelve slots. And it’s maddening to me because I put in no effort and program nine or ten people for a twelve slot season. Why is no one else programming them? This idea that artists who aren’t cis white men are not out here making art, and that’s the reason why we’re under-represented is ridiculous. There’s such a wealth of artists if you put even a little effort in. Maybe others have to put a little bit more effort in, but they’re out there.\n\nTH A commercial producing entity might respond with: we know that those people exist but they’re not ready for prime time yet. Let us know when they’re ready for prime time.\n\nEC I think it’s a mix. I don’t think my entire season is people at the halfway point. I think we have many artists who are ready for prime time. But my real answer to that question is “you are pouring resources into plenty of cis white men who are at that same point. So… it’s not like you’re reserving your resources for artists who are “ready” whatever the hell that even means, but look at who you are putting those resources in to? What’s that demographic look like? Don’t get me wrong- I like a lot of those more privileged artists’ work. It’s not even about that. I just have seen in the last few years on Broadway a lot of stories by those lucky few white men where the women and people of color are poorly drawn. And it feels like anyone else might be told they needed to hone their craft a little bit more before they’re given such a big platform.\n\nTH I’ve seen a few of those myself. I won’t give specifics, but we were having a discussion at the BMI workshop this past week about a show from a recent season centered around a female character and the general response in the room was “it would have been nice if they had a single woman on that creative team.”\n\nEC Right! And I’m just like why? It just seems like with Broadway being as financially risky as it is already, to bring in someone on your creative team who has no firsthand experience writing those characters is to absorb even more risk. Thing is, we simply don’t have trouble finding artists for Tank-aret. And I’m not like “in it” as I used to be either. I used to be really able to know everybody that’s doing everything and now I’m old and no longer in that “unpaid-labor/literary job” tier, going to readings all the time or feel it’s my responsibility to know everything. But we had one person for our 2020 season that I emailed about it and even then I didn’t have to ask them. I didn’t even get to the stage where I had to actively look before I had nine slots filled. I think we have one or two in the fall that we’re waiting on. But we’re programmed February, March, April, May, June, July. I’m glad it wasn’t a ton of work but it’s almost embarrassing how little work it was. To have that amazing group of artists at various levels of success who have been recognized for it.\n\nTH So what do you think is the difference between you, who can’t toss a feather without it hitting someone she can program and someone else who complains about not being able to find anyone?\n\nEC I think for any number of reasons, people feel icky about saying “we’re not going to give this opportunity to cis white men.” So there’s a thing where people don’t create a box that necessitates them finding this person. They give themselves permission to look and not find them and take the easier way out. And again, that’s not the mission of everything. I’m a white person. And I don’t want everything to be unavailable to white people because I also like to write things? So I understand that different platforms have different missions. But I also think you have to be honest with yourself a little bit because if you know that that’s what you’re looking for, then you’re going to see it a little bit more. Also I do think there’s a little bit of infrastructure that I’ve built over the course of my career because I care about that. So I offer that it’s not like it’s immediately possible. You do have to put in some work to build your infrastructure. But I also think building the infrastructure is easier than some people think it is. It’s a three step process. First you accept the premise that these artists exist. Then you accept the premise that they’re talented. If you accept those two things, then you must accept that they’re making work and that they must be making it somewhere. Once you’re there you just have to say to yourself “if it’s not being made in the places that I’m going, then I’m going to the wrong places.”\n\nTH If it’s a given that there is inherent bias. That the whole of Timothy Huang’s pedigree hinges on an aesthetic predetermined by Euro centrism and the patriarchy- I’m not necessarily going to have the facility to even see that you, Ellarose, a female artist creating work are talented. I’m going to see something very, very different. How do I unsee that? How do you open my eyes?\n\nEC I think that’s tricky because we have this entire process that is completely subjective that we’ve convinced ourselves is objective. So the first thing is that you burn it all down. Honestly. The first response is burn it all down and say “those people should not be in power.” They aren’t qualified because their viewpoint is compromised. Instead of saying “They are the authority, and they are right and we have to figure out how to work within that” we say “those people are under-qualified to be in power because they are too limited in their scope and the industry is bigger than them and they are too- it isn’t even necessarily because of their age, but-\n\nTH It might be because they never had to learn how to pass the torch to the generation after them because most of that generation were wiped out in the AIDS epidemic. Nobody ever taught them how to mentor.\n\nEC That’s a really big part of it. And because they live in a society where they are fish that can’t feel water. But truly I feel the people you’re describing are unqualified for their positions and so we have to recognize that and burn it all down. But in the interim, I think we pose the question differently. Marsha Norman and I had this conversation when I did my fellowship at the Guild and commented that the Ebb Award [which pays out $60K to the winning writer or writing team] only goes to white men. She said “should I give them a call and ask if they want to be introduced to any women songwriters?” Which, I don’t know that she did that but it did lead to that blog I wrote for The Lillys about the pipeline. We need to say to people: Look around. Look at the landscape. Separate the question of quality of work and ask yourself “do you think that women are incapable of writing good musicals? Do you think that people of color or incapable of writing good musicals?” If you believe that, I don’t think that I can change your mind. Which is why I’m like “burn it all down.” I honestly think most people don’t believe that if you put it to them that way. The people that I’ve talked to about it truly just don’t know where to find us. I’ve gotten a lot of “I want to do this. Where do I find people.” And that’s a little frustrating because I’m an artist and I’m standing right here. And you haven’t programmed me, but you’re asking me to tell you how to do it and but also for free. But also… Google? Google especially now that trans lab is a thing and Musical Theater Factory lab is a thing but nowadays when I get that question I can just say “come to Tank-aret!”\n\nTH I’d to take a minute and footnote that at the time of your conversation with Marsha, the Ebb award itself was eleven years old and three of its sixteen winners were women. In the four years that followed your article, the number rose to five out of twenty three. Put a different way, before your blog, women were winning once every five years. After your blog, they were winning as often as men were.\n\nEC Isn’t that interesting.\n\nTH To go back to your statement before though, I think the trouble is people rarely say yes or no if asked that way. It’s “I can’t list five women /POCs who write musicals.”\n\nEC Great. So the problem then is that you don’t believe they exist, it’s that we’re having trouble programming them in your sphere. And maybe it’s that you need to bring on somebody else. If you have that bias, and you’re unable to do the work or willing to do the work or able to understand that you are the thing in your own way. Maybe the thing to do is hire someone within your organization who can.\n\nTH Which is thankfully a more and more common practice.\n\nEC I think that the whole underpinning of this conversation and everything we’ve been talking about since the beginning is that as long as we allow America and as an extension of that the arts, to be run by corporate capitalism we have far fewer solutions. It incentivizes certain things because of their monetary value, which are not inherently artistic. The conditions of America create a situation in which we can’t be individuals who can make art because we do not have a guarantee of food or shelter or healthcare. If there was universal healthcare and universal housing and access to food was secured then we could truly have a capitalism that people pretend to want, which is a merit based “best work rises to the top” system. But circumstances being what they are, that’s just impossible. I don’t think there should be an equality of merit in terms of what’s good and what isn’t but it’s so skewed by capitalism and white supremacy and the patriarchy that we can’t even have that conversation.\n\nTH I mean, there’s so many conversations we can’t have until we…\n\nEC Until we topple all white supremacy, topple all hetero-patriarchy, topple all class warfare and predatory capitalism and the denial of basic civil rights. And we haven’t even talked about ethno-centrism, jingoism and xenophobia and the idea of the American musical and what it means to have the American musical.\n\nTH Exactly. So… maybe let’s topple all that stuff before deadline so we can actually have those meaningful conversations!\n\nEC Ha!\n\nTH Anything else you want to close out on?\n\nEC I’m not one of those people who think all work is good. There is work that is bad. And there is work that doesn’t deserve to be funded, or produced. But I don’t think that means those artists shouldn’t be allowed to make art. There should be venues and opportunities for people that are not necessarily steering the culture. There should be more community theater in New York. There’s all these reasons why it should exist at all levels. Everyone who wants to create, write, make something should be allowed to do that.\n\nOver the weekend I was invited to deliver remarks at the school I attended for fourteen years before college. It was super surreal, and quite humbling and a very big deal for me. One doesn’t spend fourteen years at a school without aquiring a few battle scars. And certainly if you’re me, you don’t expect that anything you’ve ever done in your life would warrant an invitation to return. when you look at the distinguished alumni who have come out of this place. Athletes, artists, politicians… anyway, it went over pretty well, and a few people were asking about a transcript, so here it is below. Unfortunately [or fortunately?] I didn’t script the big group selfie moment at the top but maybe that’s for the best.\n\nDr Burns, Mr. Shluter, Mr. Marvin, faculty, distinguished alumni, thank you so much for having me…\n\nGraduating class of 2019… Woohooo! You guys! You did it. Congratulations! You’re like, SO done. Not just like, “done,” but actually, effectively, you are “SOOOOO done.” And I get the magnitude of that. I started here in Pre Kindergarten. Fourteen years from there to there, all told. Even if you weren’t like me, and did not start here in Pre-K, like that last year? NOT EASY. I stand up for you. I’m saying this because I want you to understand that I know somewhat of what you’ve been through, and that I see you. I don’t want you to lose heart. Because I’m about to get real: You are not done. Not nearly done. Not remotely done. You are, in fact, only getting started.\n\nNow, I’ve been thinking a lot about why someone like me, a guy you barely know, (who prior to meeting him, you had literally never heard of before,) would be invited to come speak at your graduation. And the only reason I could fashion aside from the alumni connection, was that at forty four years old, I’m finally starting to live my best life and I suspect as a parting gift for you, Tatnall would wish that you started living yours way earlier. That you do is so important. It’s bigger-than-the-individual important. I’ll tell you why I say that in just a minute, but right now…\n\nRight now I want to tell you, whether you like it or not, your generation has already been and will continue to be defined by Unprecedented Wackadoo Circumstances: I’ll give you some examples. The company that created Mickey Mouse now controls what comes out of the mouths of Homer Simpson, Darth Vader and Deadpool. Someone with no experience or formal education used Instagram to defraud the public to the tune of $100 million by hosting a fake music festival on an island with zero infrastructure. Also, our government is like, going through some stuff right now. Point being: Unprecedented. Wackadoo. Circumstances. Unfortunately, most of that’s completely out of your hands. In the age of the twenty hour news cycle, hashtag activism and callout culture you take fire on all sides every hour of every day in mostly metaphorical but often very literal ways. I have no idea what that feels like, and I imagine it sucks. But I can’t be too disappointed by it because as a result, you all are super woke, you are driven to speak your truths loudly and are prepared to know and defend your convictions from the word “go.” And that’s beyond impressive, that’s admirable. It’s as unprecedented as the times in which you live. But conviction is only half the distance.\n\nMaybe not soon, (but also maybe not soon enough) yours will be the generation that puts into the White House the first woman or LGBTQ President! (or both!). I’m using this as a literary example, not a political one, but history suggests this is inevitable. And with that unprecedented circumstance, and the myriad others like it to come, you’ll find yourselves frequently at odds with rule makers and each other as to the value of that and what the next steps should be. And what you’ll need to have when you are in those conversations more than conviction, are curiosity and kindness. Because no satisfying co-operation ever came by being unkind, and no long-term solution to any new-world problem ever came by being un-curious.\n\nAnd that’s what’s at stake here. Long-term solutions to new-world problems. Problems that my generation either failed to predict or succeeded to perpetuate. (Really sorry about that, by the way.) You and I might not have anything of substance in common, but graduates, your generation and mine are more the same than not: From the moment we were born, we were Othered. We grew up in a world that was obsessed with the generation before us. They were the ones who were marketed to, they were the ones whose opinions were solicited. In subtext and in plain text we were told we were an afterthought. A generational post-script. And like my generation, yours will have no choice but to adapt to a landscape that shifts in twelve months the amount it used to shift in twelve years. The difference is you won’t gaze at your navel as you rage against the machine. You have the wherewithal to do it elegantly and fearlessly and with tremendous kindness and curiosity. I can’t even tell you how proud of you I am for that.\n\nI mentioned earlier that I’m finally living my best life at forty four. If you’ll allow, I’d like to tell you a little about why and what that is. Let’s start here: I acted professionally for a few years after college, and did a couple of films and TV shows but mostly nowadays people know me because I write theater that is thought provoking and well-considered. Usually that involves writing for characters that look like me, and share my experiences as a second generation immigrant American. A bi-product of that is on social media, I look kind of amazing. It would appear from my profiles that I spend a lot of time on red carpets taking selfies with Pulitzer, and EGOT winners. Wanna see a picture of me holding the Best Song Oscar from Frozen or the Grammy Award for From A Distance? Or sitting at the right hand of Steven Sondheim? Maybe you’re more curious about that footage of me on The Sopranos or why Lin-Manuel Miranda drew the Terminator robot on a legal pad and slid it over to me during a meeting despite not even knowing my name.\n\nIf I’m being honest, my hope is that you don’t care about any of these things. But let’s allow that you do. All of these things are sort of real? But also completely artificial. The realest thing about them is that they are evidence that people far more influential than me are attracted to where my curiosity and kindness has led me. And they want to go there too. I spent most of my 20s trying to fit into a system that was not designed for a person who looked like me, and certainly not prepared to adapt for one by any measure. No one was ever saying to me in college “do you know what a great role for you would be?” Because there were none. For me. Then I spent my 30s punching back because there should have been. That was my conviction. That there should have been. Theater self-identifies as the place for misfits. As the place where there’s something for everyone. So when there wasn’t, I punched back. I wasn’t even trying to be antagonistic. I was just trying to carve out a space for myself in a community that evidently didn’t think I had anything to offer it. In any event, something really curious happened. I tried so hard to convince “The Establishment” that I was actually a human person with a heart and a brain and courage, that I forgot that I was talking to human people with hearts and brains and courage.\n\nSo in my forties, something even more curious started to happen. I stopped seeing The Establishment as a wall and started seeing them as people. The world I was and am so deeply entrenched in wasn’t intentionally trying to keep me from the things I wanted to achieve, it just didn’t have the language or context to understand why what I wanted to achieve was so important.\n\nI’ll give you one quick example. In 2008 I was working on a theater piece called Death and Lucky about a Chinese mother and her American-born daughter who were forced to move back in with each other after the father dies. It was inspired by a nonsense rhyme my mom used to sing to me in Mandarin about two racing tigers. “One has no eyes, one has no ears, isn’t that strange?”\n\nThey both have to take care of the adult brother, LUCKY, who is non-verbal and communicates only through the piano, but they both have very different ideas of what care-giving is. The mom character in particular showed little compassion and cared more about how her kids made her look than how her kids felt. She was, in fact, a classic Tiger Mom. Unfortunately for me the book that coined that phrase “Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother” didn’t come out until 2011. So this piece I had been writing for three-plus years that would have cast a bright light on non-verbal Autism went the way of the dodo. No one knew. Right? Back then anyone looking to take a risk on a new musical wasn’t looking at intersectionality, or the importance of representation.\n\nI’m skipping a couple of beats here, and it hasn’t always been a straight line, obviously, but I hope you’ll believe me when I tell you that the reason people are now suddenly interested in this piece I shelved nine years ago is because I found a way to get other people to nerd out over the things that I nerded out over. And you know how I pulled that off? Curiosity and kindness. It wasn’t conviction. I wish it had been, but it was curiosity and kindness. Curiosity of their journey of their experience, and kindness when recognizing their fear. Which is something we all share. And then suddenly, I was The Establishment.\n\nI’m really reluctant to end this speech here, but I’m going to now share with you the obligatory 10 lessons I wish I knew at your age that I didn’t. Some of these will probably already sound familiar to you.\n\nWhen at your job or in class, if you take a moment to invest in your supervisor or professor, you’ll pretty much automatically get a passing grade. Do with that what you will.\n\nReinventing yourself is a myth. Allow for the possibility that you just didn’t know yourself as well as you thought. Allow also for the possibility that you have always been enough.\n\nNever ask the question you think you know the answer to- you’ll always be disappointed. Ask the question you don’t know the answer to- it’s just underneath that first one.\n\nAt least once in your life, make a New Year’s Resolution to sleep better at night. You’d be amazed at what that allows you to do and shook by what it disallows you from doing.\n\nA propos of number four, put your name on everything you say and write publicly. If you can’t, give yourself two days to think about why before you do anything.\n\nAt some point you’ll say no to school. That’s okay. But please always say yes to learning.\n\nKeep every single promise you make. Make none you can’t keep.\n\nIf you listen as ferociously as you speak, you will find the truth far more quickly than if you do either one without the other.\n\nPower multiplies when you are generous with it, not when you are selfish with it. And finally,\n\nEmpathy is even more valuable than time. And time is super valuable.\n\nI have to confess, graduates, I lied earlier. You were never an afterthought generation. We don’t have that in common. You are the architects. You get to reframe national conversations. You are not done. You are not nearly done. Not remotely done. You are, in fact, only just getting started. Thank YOU.\n\nRecently an article in Playbill announced that Actors' Equity Association would be renaming the Gypsy Robe ceremony, \"which celebrates ensemble members of Broadway shows, after the current season. The decision—a response to the cultural implications of the term—follows a vote by AEA’s National Council.\" Following this, and an e-blast from AEA to its members asking for name suggestions was a hailstorm of snarky comments from friends and enemies alike on my social media feed.\n\nI've spent the better part of the morning thinking about this. Asking myself what traditions do I hold that are SO important to me that renaming them would fundamentally change what they were. I confess, I don't have that many traditions. Or, at least, my traditions are pretty malleable. I'm okay with getting a Christmas present on December 26th. Frankly, I'm happy to have a present at all. (I'm notoriously hard to shop for.) But I get off topic. This thought exercise led me to the below. I know this will probably irritate some of you. I really... wish that mattered. You're on the wrong side of this if you think it shouldn't change. And people are going to remember it. So maybe re-evaluate? Here's why:\n\n1. Nomenclature matters\n\nAnyone who has gotten an email from me in the last two weeks may have noticed I changed my signature from a quote by Maxine Hong Kingston (“Breathe. Pay attention. Tell the truth.”) to something a little bit simpler: he/him/his. I admit, I should have made this change the moment I made my first trans friend. The moment that struggle ceased to be an idea and started to be a person. But I am a stubborn mother-fucker and generally slow on the uptake. But if the price I pay for learning empathy late is that I actually learn it and hold it, then sign me up. Nomenclature matters. It matters not just to the people who are asking for clarity and respect, but to people who do not know that their bias harmfully affects someone else. Not a single person I know would ever question that my gender identity and gender representation is male. That’s never been my struggle. But I include those pronouns now because I allow for the possibility that it is someone else’s. And personally, I’d prefer my privilege to betray me in the way I complain about Moviepass on Facebook then something that actually matters. Nomenclature matters.\n\n2. We can actually care about more than one cause at one time.\n\nI am a feminist. I am a queer ally. I believe Black Lives Matter. And I have spent the better part of sixteen years representing Asian men and women on stage by writing almost exclusively for them. F. Scott Fitzgerald writes in a 1936 issue of Esquire “The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function.” Don’t get me wrong. I’m not calling myself a first-rate intelligence. I’m actually calling YOU a first-rate intelligence. Because you are. And you can do this. Just because a little bit of time is being spent considering the consequence of re-appropriating a culture doesn’t mean less time is being spent discussing fair wage on stage. One might even argue that these conversations are all tributaries to a greater river of equality. Don’t bite off your nose to spite your face.\n\nWhich brings us to:\n\n3. Just because it doesn’t benefit you doesn’t mean it doesn’t benefit you because it actually does.\n\nBut Tim, you ask, we don’t even know any Gypsies. Who even is this affecting? The answer is, whoever proposed the name be changed to begin with. The conversations happen when the conversations happen. When someone is finally ready to be a squeaky wheel about them. We don't get to decide if they are trivial, for every time someone has, it has only resulted in their downfall. As recently as fifty years ago our LGBTQ forefathers started a riot because they knew that the systems of power in place at the time would never elect to consider their humanity. They rioted because literally everyone else on the planet was saying “why do I have to respect someone else’s perversion? Who even is this affecting?” Without Stonewall, there is no SCOTUS decision. Who is this affecting? History would answer “literally everyone.”\n\n4. Old comics are lazy. And you are not an old comic.\n\nThis has been going around a lot. Where middle-career comedians are saying they can't go to universities anymore to do their stuff because university students are snowflakes and take everything too seriously. The students themselves would counter that their awareness is impossibly high, and jokes about rape aren't funny anymore. I suspect the truth lies somewhere in the middle. (Not that bit about rape jokes, which are not my kind of funny.) You can extrapolate this to, let's say, white male playwrights lamenting that they lose out on opportunities because of the inclusion of women and writers of color. That's one that's in my orbit right now. I'm going to stick with comedy though because it's something I like, and something I am wholly outside of.\n\nWhat the comics seem to mean when they say this though is when they started out, people were allowed to be misogynistic and racist, and now they aren't, and they don't have the skill set to find humor where none existed before. They can only re-iterate, not innovate. For better or worse, this is the path of progress. It starts with a resentful conversation about something no one has ever considered before, and in the face of that tension and adversity, results in some of us becoming irrelevant before our time and others of us realizing that someone we didn't know was there, has been there all along. The thing these old comics don't know? They can choose either.\n\n5. How we choose to respond to discussions like these is the benchmark of our civilization\n\nDostoevsky says “The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons.” But prisons are more than just cells and yards. And he didn’t mean it literally anyway. We allow ourselves to be trapped within social confines on a daily basis. And within those confines, we allow ourselves to value people differently. There are websites alive today that still maintain that the Three Fifths Compromise in the Constitution of 1787 does not inherently devalue a human being. Many things we think are givens are actually not, and rolling our eyes at something we deem unimportant only demonstrates our own privilege. What is the actual harm in having the conversation? What about this name change threatens the actual tradition it represents? For a community whose benchmark is inclusion, whose union name boasts the word EQUITY itself, being resistant to a discussion about a name change essentially says: This tradition is for us. Not for you..\n\n“Pretty much everything you’ve said to me today has been positively aggravating, if I’m being honest.” I say to him, as I play with my Diet Coke straw. But this director who I’ve only just met knows I’m not being honest. He can tell by the way my hand is twitching, trying its best not to reach for the knife at our table. If I was being honest I’d be holding it, a thread of profanities unspooling from my mouth like so much Christmastime popcorn.\n\nIt’s a little after 4:45 pm on a Monday afternoon and the steam coming from Westway Diner is absolutely originating from my ears. I’ve been seething in this booth for the better part of an hour hoping for someone to start a fire or rob the place Pulp Fiction style, so I can get out of this meeting but no such luck. The very best I can hope for now is to sink into the floor, through the cushions into the sunken place a la Get Out. But I’m not holding my breath. It would appear that having my mind lobotomized and my body re-purposed is more pleasurable to me than enduring this casually racist, dangerously ignorant, hyper privileged, dim-wittery. But I get ahead of myself. Let me catch you up.\n\nCouple weeks ago I get an email through my website from someone I’ve neither met nor heard of before. He says he is a director, looking for a composer-lyricist to collaborate with on an idea for a musical. This happens fairly often, and I’ve written about it at length, so you can probably guess that he is a white man, and the subject matter of his chosen project involves… Asia. That’s only half true. It’s actually about a still-living, female Olympic figure skater who is Asian-American. Already, this is a good sign. Not only because as a lyricist I’d have more agency in the storytelling, but as a composer, I know this show won’t be set in Feudal China and doesn’t “need that special flare that my music would be perfect for.” (For the uninitiated, this is code for “I want political cover because I’m writing about Asia and no one will let me do that by myself anymore.\" But more on this later.)\n\n“Great!” I think to myself. “I may not be a woman, but I am legitimately Asian American.” This is something about which I feel confident I can write with some kind of credibility. Also, I rarely write about Asian Americans, so that’s cool too. This guy sends me the first act of his script, with his lyrics already set and I pause. He said he was looking for a composer-lyricist, but sends over a script with lyrics. Not “here’s what I think the song moment is” poetry, but real lyrics. They scan. They have a rhyme scheme. They have hooks. So… what is he really looking for and why is it incongruous with what he says he’s looking for? And why is he positioning himself as a director, when he obviously thinks of himself as a writer? Red flag number one.\n\nSo I read about half the script, and think about it for a day before responding. I keep coming back to two moments in it that interest me: the first is a comparison of lacing up skates to foot-binding, a practice that was outlawed in China one hundred years ago, and the second involves a scene where the then-fourteen-year-old protagonist is encouraged to costume herself sexually in order to be taken seriously by the judges. Depending upon where you fall on the Feminism spectrum I’m either a feminist or an ally, (I’m comfortable with either) and this piece seems like something I could really get into. I agree to a meeting.\n\nMaybe it shouldn’t be red flag number two, but the fact that he doesn’t know where New Dramatists is also gives me pause. So we agree to meet at Westway instead. Here’s where things go decidedly south. I sit down, we play the name game, we discover we have a few mutual friends. I ask him one question. “So what drew you to this person and their story?”\n\n“After she took silver at the Olympics, someone asked her on TV how it felt losing the gold. She said ‘I don’t see it as losing the gold, I see it as winning the silver.’ And I thought ‘wow, that answer is totally full of shit.’ So I started thinking about the secret conversations we never got to see on TV or in the media. What does she say when Connie Chung turns off the cameras?” is his response.\n\nRed flags everywhere. For one, that this guy would presume something a real person said about her own outlook as a willful misrepresentation takes the narrative in a direction I’m not sure I want to go in. Especially when the other direction seems so promising. For another, where is he getting his research for those off-the-record moments, I wonder? I ask him. “Making it up.” He says.\n\nThis isn’t an uncommon practice among writers. Historical figures are frequently adapted to the stage. And we’d be lying to ourselves if we thought every word uttered in their names was verified true. But there is a thing called life rights, and there is also a thing called historical-domain, and since he hasn’t said “I have optioned her life story” and since she is still very much alive, I think it’s fair to say that at best, this work falls into a highly questionable gray area. But I slow my roll. Sure, he’s been talking at me for fifteen minutes, recapping the script he emailed me. Surely at some point he’ll stop and… ask me something. Anything. He continues.\n\n“And then at first when they try to dress her up like a tart, I had her dad refuse to acquiesce because that’s what a Chinese dad would do.” I feel a trickle of sweat sliding down my right temple. This is frustrating to me. Not only because he thinks he’s paying me and my people a compliment with this statement… Not only because he presumes he knows what a “Chinese dad would do”… Not only because he is suggesting the character would do anything because he’s Chinese… But also because he could have just asked me.\n\n“Does this track, Tim? Does this moment feel disingenuous?” Why bother inviting an Asian-American on to your creative team when all you want is their validation? Unless the whole thing is a pretense to begin with. You see where this is going. We’re at the twenty five minute mark now and he’s still talking at me, my core temperature slowly rising.\n\n“And then I had to have the sister character in there too because it couldn’t all just be about the dad and the coach.” Now my head is exploding. Did he just say his show couldn’t just be about the dad and the coach? Did he actually suggest that the protagonist of this story was not the Olympic figure skater herself? Maybe he didn’t mean it that way. But the ill-considered word choice is enough. Another red flag. How many is that now?\n\n\"Also, I know a lot of young girls would come, and it's really important to me that they see it.\" He continues. See what, I wonder. Someone representing them on stage being full of shit?\n\n“Okay hold up.” I say to him. “Tell me again, who recommended me to you?”\n\n“Well I was having a conversation with [drop-in name of fancy producer here] and he was saying to me ‘I think you might have to write this with an Asian American writer.’ And I was like ‘Yeah. I kind of have to. Because the landscape.’ Right? Like, in this landscape they’d never let me get away with it. I can’t write Dream Girls in this landscape. In. This. Landscape.” He says, while striking his thick finger down on the Formica on every word.\n\nSo... in case you missed it, what this gentleman suggested to me was that a) “this landscape” is the only reason he shouldn’t be writing stories about women of color and b) he’s working on the same level as Henry Krieger and Tom Eyen. And maybe to a lesser degree c) that someday within his own lifetime the attitudes on this will change back and favor him writing whatever he wants.\n\nI'm only going to say this ten million more times: Just because something used to be permissible doesn't mean it was ever okay.\n\n“Wait. Stop. Just- ...so [fancy producer name-drop] recommended me to you?” I ask. I can’t do this with him for another thirty five minutes.\n\n“No,” says he, “I got your name from a Facebook group. The Asian American Composers and Lyricists Project.” Which in itself is pretty weird because I'm a moderator of that group and no formal inquiries were ever made.\n\n“Then… no one recommended me to you. Okay. Have you asked anyone else?”\n\n“No. I initially reached out to… what’s his name… he’s Asian American… he’s at Primary Stages? Do you know who I’m talking about?”\n\n“Not without a name…” I'm shaking my head.\n\n“Yeah well anyway, I asked that guy. And then he recommended me to a lyricist at New Dramatists… she’s… what’s her name? I can’t remember her name either. She’s an Asian American and she's a woman lyricist at New Dramatists. Anyway I emailed her, and I never got an answer back. So, just you.”\n\nNow I’m completely off the reservation. This lyricist he speaks of, who (I presume is not a composer) and is from the same New Dramatists whose address he didn’t know and couldn’t Google for himself… this person was going to write... music?... Whatever.\n\n“Okay. Let me stop you right there. I… I’m not going to do this with you.”\n\n“Do what?”\n\n“Write your musical. I’m not going to do that with you.”\n\n“Wait. Really? Why?” This comes as a legitimate surprise to him.\n\n“Pretty much everything you’ve said to me today has been positively aggravating, if I’m being honest.” I reach for my Diet Coke straw, wonder why the waitress never came back to take our order and see his open menu on the table. Thank God for small favors.\n\n“Did I say something wrong?” He stutters. He looks over the table at my face. I can’t know for sure, but I think I have on that face you get where someone steps on your foot and is more upset at the bottom of their shoe than your toe and you literally don’t know which indignity to address first. That’s the face he’s looking at right now. Meanwhile, the face I’m looking at is the one that only comes from a lifetime of ease and privilege and being told that everything you see is defined in relation to you. Equally aggravating.\n\n“All I know is I’ve been sitting here for forty five minutes, and you have been talking at me but not to me. You haven’t asked me a single question about myself, my process, or my principles and shouldn't knowing that be critical in a collaboration? I’ve asked you two questions and instead of answering you’ve just described your show to me in great detail. You’ve also presumed to know anything about my Chinese father (and by extension, me) and just now you looked me straight in the eyes and said your show was about the dad and the coach. As if it could ever not be about her. Finally, you have said exactly nothing about the two things which I found most compelling about your idea. So, no. I’m not going to write this show with you. And I'm certainly not going to write it for you. But you should do it, man. Go for it.”\n\nOpen mouth, vacant stare into the middle distance… he is still very confused. “What two things?” He asks, grasping.\n\n“Early on in the script you evoke foot-binding, (something the person who talks about it could never have experienced firsthand) and make a direct comparison between it and lacing on ice-skates. Later on, you talk about how this young girl becomes overtly sexualized by the two older men charged with her well being. Yet your show isn’t any kind of commentary on the subjugation of women?”\n\nAgain with the open mouth and vacant stare. “I… hadn’t thought of it that way.” He says to me. I’m not making this up. He says this out loud. To my face.\n\nIf he had asked me even one thing, he'd know that I have no interest in telling stories where women or Asian people are props. If he'd asked me two things, he'd know that I have no interest in telling stories where anyone outside of my experience is a prop. And if he'd asked me three things, he'd know that the reason he was encouraged to write this show with an Asian-American was because we can't trust ourselves to be our own council when writing outside of our own experience. Not yet anyway.\n\n\"Yeah.\" I say. \"So, I’m going to think about people who I know who might be interested in this, and if I think of someone I’ll make an introduction.” (I’m not lying. If you want to meet him, I will introduce you.) “Meanwhile, I didn’t bring any cash with me and can’t pay for this Diet Coke. Would you mind?”\n\nHe shakes his head no. I take it as a kindness.\n\nI grab my bag, head out onto 9th Avenue and immediately Google dry cleaners near me. I got privilege all over my new sweater and someone’s going to help me get it out.\n\nIt’s getting on midnight on a cold November Wednesday and I’m sitting at the Brooklyn Diner in midtown with my good friend Em. We’ve just come from an original new musical that might not have been for us. We’re both okay with it, except I am totally not okay with it. I’m actually kind of infuriated. She’s confused as to why. I start in.\n\n“If this playwright wanted me to sympathize or identify with his protagonist, as all playwrights do, I think all he needed to do was acknowledge that his character was inherently privileged. That the very belief they can leave their latte on a counter and walk away is an act of privilege. Because where I come from, leaving a latte on a counter isn’t something people take lightly. And acknowledging that there are places in this world, no- this country where leaving a latte on a counter is unheard of, would have made me feel a little more included.”\n\nObviously, I’m not talking about an actual latte. I am talking about a much larger, much deeper action around which someone could, and effectually has, structured an entire theatrical narrative. But this is a real show, with a real writer, so for anonymity’s sake let’s just pretend I am talking about a latte. (It’s still not about the latte.) Em fires back.\n\n“Okay first of all, this isn’t Broadway. This is a forty show run and a fifty seat house, and the contracts are different. Slow your roll. There are no names above the title here, no swings, no understudies, and I don’t get to ask for my money back if someone calls out.”\n\n“Just because it’s Off-Broadway doesn’t give it license to be ill-considered. In fact some might argue it has to be even better considered if it’s going to be Off-Broadway.” I reply. She ignores me, continues.\n\n“Second of all, are you saying it’s unrealistic that a college aged character would be insensitive to the magnitude of sacrifice involved in leaving a latte on a counter? You’re surprised by this?”\n\n“No,” I say, “I’m saying that addressing that privilege, in some way, in ANY way does not compromise the narrative or the character. Why leave it out? It only adds to the inclusivity of the piece as a whole. And conversely, not addressing it at all, suggests that either the writer was blind to it or only wrote for people to whom leaving a latte on a counter is commonplace.”\n\nEm stirs her black and white milkshake with the straw that very well may be her last. We’ve been friends since college but she’s heard this speech about twenty five times. In her defense, she doesn’t disagree- she just doesn’t see how my problems are her responsibility. This would probably be fair, except they aren’t just my problems, and that’s exactly why I think they’re her responsibility: Are you living in America in 2018? Do you have a social media account? Know anyone who is gay, Black, Trans, Asian, Latinx or CIS female? (That last part is particularly apropos.)\n\n“In my world, you simply couldn’t walk away from a latte. Your parents worked too hard for you to leave that latte for someone else. And you certainly couldn’t make that sacrifice as if the only thing at stake was your own time, money and future. For many people, this is a reality. Our lives are not wholly our own. And to not have that acknowledged is the same as having invalidated it.” We’re worlds apart now. Em knows it too, and I see what’s coming next.\n\n“Yeah,” says she. “But that was your world. This writer doesn’t come from your world. This writer doesn’t even claim to be from your world. It’s unfair you should expect them to include you. Isn’t it? Like, why can’t they write their show, you write your show?”\n\nEm poses an interesting question, and one worth addressing, but first it needs a little unpacking. For starters, she is conflating inclusion with representation, but more on that in a minute. I reply in the only way I know how.\n\n“Because when I write my show, people call it ‘an Asian show.’ When they write their show, people just call it ‘a show.’” What I’m getting at, and she knows this, is that in every case where an under-represented artist seeks to represent a marginalized people or experience, the mainstream marginalizes it further by giving it a qualifying descriptor. It is defined by its relation to what is assumed is the norm. Therefore it only ceases to become “other” when someone within the mainstream takes it upon themselves to integrate it into their own work.\n\n“The question we should be asking,” I continue, “is ‘who within the mainstream will identify it as their problem if every time they stare it dead in the face, they refuse ownership over it?”\n\n“So… what?” Asks Em. “Make the character walking away from the Latte an Asian person? You’d just say that’s unbelievable and a misrepresentation.” She’s not wrong there…\n\n“Okay. Let’s go back to definitions. This conversation isn’t about representation so much as inclusion. The former is the act of putting someone ‘other’ in a show or film because that other exists in the real world and as such, should be seen. Should be represented. This is a personal choice for any writer and one I can do for myself. The latter is far simpler, less costly, and should be on everyone’s to-do list: making sure no one in your audience has to work any harder than anyone else to experience your show. Because right now friend, the contracts are different, and they shouldn’t be.” I’m on a roll.\n\n“You posit that this writer should be free to write this show and this show should be free to be what it wants without the responsibility of including me, the guy who’s never left a latte on a counter. Let’s look at that model for a moment. The thing that happens when writers, producers and artistic directors in the main stream take a pass on being responsible for inclusion is a thing that has actually happened. Slowly and surely no one else gets represented. Or, as you hypothesize, people like me get represented poorly. You with me so far?”\n\nEm slurps her black and white, the irony lost to her.\n\n“But then when someone like me writes for faces like mine, as I have perpetually and without apology for the past fifteen years, if I’m not writing with an eye towards including you, I’m simply writing an unworthy script that no one ever sees. That seem right to you? We finally put a name to this phenomenon. It’s called institutionalized racism. Perpetuated by something else we didn’t know had a name until recently: unconscious bias.”\n\n“That is pure conjecture.” Says Em. “No offense Tim, I think you’re really talented, but what if your earlier work in those days just wasn’t good enough?”\n\n“Em, my work from yesterday wasn’t good enough. It can always be better. But the numbers are documented, and historically, the ratio of produced work is hugely disproportional in favor of white men. Do you really believe that whenever ‘those days’ was, that the work of every single person of color, every single female, every single intersection was simply not good enough? Is it that hard to believe they were systemically overlooked?”\n\nThis hits a little close to home. Of course she knows what it is to be systematically overlooked. She might not ever wonder why in a five show season at a regional theater company two shows about Chinese people can’t co-exist. Or two shows about Gay people. Or two shows about Trans or Gay or Black or Latinx people… but she does know what it feels like to have her own experience invalidated. And if I were inside her head (which I am) I would tell you what pisses her off more than anything, is the knowing that she has no control over it. Except she does. Her half empty milkshake, now a murky gray, is actually half full.\n\n“Yes, the contracts are different. Some people get to walk in, and take ‘leaving a latte’ on its own terms while others have to adapt. The great news is you don’t have to put up with it. You can choose to see exclusivity for what it is, and not endorse it. You can be openly critical about any show that runs counter to the ideology of a living and inclusive theater! You can also share that Youtube of Neil Patrick Harris opening the 2013 Tonys where he basically says it in a rap penned by Lin Manuel Miranda, because it really holds up.”\n\n“It was actually James Corden in 2016.” She fires back. And just like that, we’re back into it.\n\n“Nuh-uh, sorry, NPH did it first, and did it better.”\n\n“Are you kidding me?” Says Em, flicking her straw wrapper my way. “That part when the rainbow kids become that year’s nominees is magic.”\n\n“Fine, share them both. They’re both great.” I say, just as our waitress comes by, checking in.\n\n“Do you want anything else?” I ask, “It’s on me.”\n\n“No,” says my good friend. “It’s on me.”\n\n1. Rehearsal Starts Monday Morning\n\nWhat you think it means: My writing deadline is Monday morning.\n\nWhat it actually means: Rehearsal starts Monday morning.\n\nYou'd think this was a no-brainer, but actually it kind of needs to be said. Your writing deadline does not end the day rehearsals begin. You have a director. They need to look at your text so they can have any idea what to do in the room. Because 29 hours is not a lot of time. When is this director going to do this? It really depends on how busy your director is. Probably the Thursday before. But if they have other projects, maybe two Mondays before. Your actual deadline is when they need your text. Always ask. Same for your Music Director too.\n\n2. The Director is Your Friend\n\nWhat you think it means: My director of my reading is literally a friend of mine. They won't care who I cast.\n\nWhat it actually means: I should probably check in with my director and music director about who they like. And I should probably not have cast it before hiring them.\n\nTheater is not made by two people. Even if your graduate program tells you that musicals are a product of the collaboration between a \"words person\" and a \"music person.\" Musical Theater is made by a hundred and fifty people. Your writers, your directors, your choreographers, your designers, your cast, your crew, your musicians, and yeah, your producers (sometimes that's you.) You get the idea. They're all real people with real expertise and real opinions that are worthy of your consideration.\n\nLook. You'll probably end up getting your way. But do you want to have your way at the cost of alienating your team? Or would you rather have it after you have asked everyone else what they think and either learned something new or gained their respect? The director is your friend.\n\n3. Your Cast of Characters are Ethnically Non-specific\n\nWhat you think it means: My cast can be any color, creed, or orientation.\n\nWhat it actually means: Your cast will wind up being white because you did not specify.\n\nOkay. I'm not going to dwell on this. You've probably read any number of diatribes I have written on this subject. And if you have not, certainly check out this interview with Bernie Telsey where he says casting directors \"don't get credit\" for diversity. THIS type of thinking is your enemy. And certainly more likely when you're an aged dinosaur who willfully turns a blind eye to sexual harassment and misogyny. But that is a different article for a different time. Meanwhile, how do you solve this problematic Maria: make specific choices. \"But wah wah,\" you cry, \"that means I have to potentially be responsible for representing someone other than me or mine!\"\n\nYes. Now go do it, and do it responsibly.\n\n4. Your Mentor Got a Prize\n\nWhat you think it means: I can ask them for a recommendation to the same prize because they are invested in me artistically.\n\nWhat it actually means: Your mentor got a prize.\n\nOkay, let's start here: if you don't have a mentor, you can ask for one. Go find someone you like, and say the words out loud: Will you mentor me? And see what it gets you.\n\nMoving on, it actually does mean what you think it means. Too. (Inconceivable!) But it doesn't always have to. Your mentor is an artist. They are trying their best to use their powers for good by making themselves available to you, and opening doors for you that you might not be able to open for yourself via a benefit-of-the-doubt that they have earned for themselves. But it has to work in both directions. I'll say it again. Your mentor is an artist. They need support just like you need support. Even if they are opening their fifth Broadway show. They still need support.\n\nSo maybe before you ask them to vouch for you again, make sure\n\na) they aren't in the middle of something and could use a cookie and a hug, and\n\nb) your own personal conduct as of late has not been embarrassing\n\nI once got an email on a Saturday from a mentee who was in the middle of writing a new draft for their workshop (that started the next Monday- see 1.) asking about a recommendation for a fellowship I had just completed for myself.\n\nBeing unprofessional not only reflects poorly on you, it reflects poorly on anyone who has ever vouched for you. Which brings us to:\n\n5. You Know People Who Know People\n\nWhat you think it means: You know people too.\n\nWhat it actually means: You know people who know people.\n\nAccess is a funny thing. It isn't like power, which only multiplies when you share it. It's a delicate balance of favor-asking and privacy-respecting. If you're in your twenties it's a little less likely that you know influential people than if you're older. Attrition hasn't happened yet, and your peer group hasn't decided to specialize, but take note. It will happen. Especially if you're writing musical theater. Because let's face it, those actors you're using for your cabarets will get to Broadway before you will. Those dramaturges and producers and directors you worked with at NYMF or The Fringe? They are the next literary person at The Public, Development Coordinator at The Lark, Talent representative at Gersh. What does this mean for you?\n\nProbably nothing if you've done any of the above things I'm trying to save you from. But even if you haven't, probably nothing. Remember this, so when that probably nothing manifests as something, you're grateful and not a dick. Send hand written thank you cards. Respect their time. Know in advance what your asks are."
