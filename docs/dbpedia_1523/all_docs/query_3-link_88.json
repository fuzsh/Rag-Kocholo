        "text": "2020 has been quite an interesting and rollercoaster ride of a year, leaving many of us to be stuck at home. Luckily enough, there’s been plenty of great dramas from China and Taiwan this year to keep us entertained, along with a new batch of hot rising actors to bless our screens. In previous years, we featured popular hot actors like: Li Xian, Wang Yibo, and Xu Kai, just to name of few. We’re back again with our list of the hottest rising actors of 2020 and it’s the biggest list to date with many standout stars. Check them out below!\n\nSong Wei Long\n\nActor Song Wei Long is one of China’s fastest rising stars. The broadcast of the hugely popular family drama “Go Ahead” solidified his status as one of the most popular actors of 2020. Known for his handsome looks, you’ll be surprised to know that Song Wei Long is only 21 years old and has received many opportunities after signing with Huanyu Film in 2015. The 185 centimeter (approximately 6 feet) star made his debut as a model after he was scouted online at 16 years old. Prior to his entertainment career, Song Wei Long developed a love for martial arts after watching Jet Li’s iconic film “The New Legend of Shaolin” and attended the famous Shaolin Tagou Martial Arts School.\n\nIn 2018, he received his first breakthrough in the historical drama “Untouchable Lovers” when he was just 18 years old. However, 2020 is definitely his year, with four dramas featuring him as the male lead, all of which aired this year: “Find Yourself,” “Beautiful Reborn Flower,” “In A Class of Her Own,” and “Go Ahead.” His dramas were all well-received, but “Go Ahead” and “Find Yourself” in particular are deeply loved by audiences for their outstanding characters and relationship portrayals, as well as excellent acting.\n\nDue to his growing popularity, Song Wei Long is highly sought after by advertisers. He is currently endorsing over 10 brands ranging from skincare, electronics, fashion, and food. Most recently, Song Wei Long joined hands with international luxury brand Burberry as their brand ambassador, and he is also the brand spokesperson for Emporio Armani Watches for Men in the Asia Pacific region.

Unlike many of his peers, Ren Jia Lun does not have a background in acting. He started off as a professional table tennis player. His coach discovered his talent in the sport after his parents enrolled him in table tennis lessons as a form of exercise at the age of five. This led to his decade long training in table tennis, and he was selected as a player for the provincial team in Shandong province. But due to suffering frequent injuries, Ren Jia Lun could not continue playing professionally.\n\nAfter ending his table tennis career at 16 years old, Ren Jia Lun chose to pursue a career path as a singer and dancer. At the time, K-pop was really popular in China, and Ren Jia Lun became a big fan of Rain. He participated in many talent contests and auditions, garnering good results. In 2011, he moved to South Korea to be an idol trainee for four years. He was set to be the leader, lead rapper, and dancer of a Chinese-South Korean boy group, but due to unknown reasons the group never debuted and Ren Jia Lun returned to China.\n\nIn 2014, Ren Jia Lun was offered many roles in dramas and began his acting career, putting a halt on his singing and dancing career. He rose to fame after starring in the 2017 historical drama “The Glory of Tang Dynasty,” where he received rave reviews for his acting and won Best Actor at the Hengdian Film and TV Festival of China. Ren Jia Lun went on to star in more well-received dramas including “The Legend of Chusen” and “The Destiny of White Snake.” Despite having no formal training in acting, he’s been impressing viewers with his natural acting talent since his debut.\n\nRen Jia Lun recently wrapped up filming for the highly-anticipated drama “Forever and Ever” based on a popular novel called “One Lifetime Beautiful Bones,” which features a love story spanning different lifetimes.

Greg switched fields to become a model and eventually transitioned into acting. He made his official acting debut as the male lead in the Malaysian drama “Dive Into Love” in 2013. Since then, Greg has starred in a string of supporting roles in various Taiwanese dramas including “Attention Love,” “My Dear Boy,” and “Nowhere Man.”\n\nHe finally received his big break after landing the lead role in the critically acclaimed and award-winning drama “Someday or One Day.” Playing the dual roles of Li Zi Wei and Wang Quan Sheng, he stole viewers’ hearts with his boyish good looks and dazzling smile. The drama is described as an artistic masterpiece for its modern story fused with elements of romance, time travel, and suspense. Not surprisingly, “Someday or One Day” was the big winner at the 55th Golden Bell Awards (Taiwan’s equivalent to the Emmy Awards) snagging major awards that included Best TV Series, Best Screenwriter, and Best Innovative Program.\n\nThanks to the drama, it pushed Greg to be a household name after being an unknown actor for seven years.
