        "text": "Every fan girl has a favorite fairy tale. Mine has always been Cinderella. A poor struggling girl who eventually gets helps from a fairy godmother, meets her Prince Charming and gets her happily ever after. No matter how old I get I will never get tired of this storyline. Hope it's true for you as well. ðŸ™‚\n\nIn drama land there's quite a few on princesses. Here are some, that I was able to watch.\n\n1. GOONG (PRINCESS HOURS)\n\nI have to confess that I watched this drama countless of times. This is my go to drama when I want a dose of happiness. It's about Chae kyung played by Yoon Eun Hye who is a commoner and still a high school student. The Crown Prince Lee Shin is played by the handsome Ju Ji Hoon. Because of an agreement between the Crown Prince's grandfather and CK's grandfather they are forced into an arranged marriage. It started out as a loveless marriage between two high school students that eventually turned into a wonderful love story. These two had to deal with a lot of conflicts such as the pressure of being royalty, intrigue, betrayal and their own insecurities.\n\nI am totally in love with this drama. Even if it has been years that this drama was released I'm still wishing for a part two with the same cast. *sigh* Just my wishful thinking.\n\n2. My Princess\n\nThis romantic comedy from 2011 was such a blast to watch. It stars one of my fave k drama actors, Song Seong Hun. He plays Park Hae Young (Mr. P), the grandson of Daehan Group and a diplomat. The lovely Kim Tae Hee plays Lee Seol, Korea's missing princess.\n\nLee Seol is just a college student but later finds out that she's a descendant of the last emperor of the Joseon Dynasty. Eventually Park Hae Young is assigned to teach her all the things needed for her to fulfill her role as princess. He has to fight his growing feelings for her because once monarchy is restored his inheritance will be taken away. Family secrets & conspiracy surrounds theses two.\n\nWhat I love about this drama is the witty script. It was so much fun to witness the exchanges of these two. I laughed and cried with them. If people ask me of dramas to recommend, this is always one of them.:)\n\n3. Romantic Princess\n\nThis is a Taiwanese drama of 2007. It stars Angela Chang who plays Xiao Mai and Wu Chun plays Nanfeng Jin. This is another case of a missing princess. Xiao Mai was adopted by middle class parents but it was later discovered that she is an heiress. As she tries to fit in into her new life she meets four handsome guys who has lived with his grandfather. From among these four flower boys, one will be chosen to be the next successor of her grandfather. Jin is the favorite of Emp (the grandfather). But he tries to push away Xiao Mai because he also has dreams to succeed on his own. But the power of love is too strong to resist. What made the drama worthwhile for me is none other than Wu Chun. LOL This guy is too handsome and has a bod to boot. ðŸ™‚"
