        "text": "In the last few months, Taiwan has shown a sudden interest in casting popular Korean stars as the main leads in Taiwanese dramas. Actually, more accurately, GTV, a Taiwan cable network that produces dramas, has suddenly decided in this marketing strategy, resulting in the casting of Korean celebrities as the main leads in the last three dramas that they’ve announced. Additionally (this is just a neat tidbit), all 3 of these dramas are drama adaptions of popular Japanese mangas. So now we’ve got truly an pan-Asian production: Taiwanese production company and drama, Korean actor/actress, Japanese anime plot.\n\nFirst, we have two Super Junior members, Choi Siwon and Donghae, who have been tapped to act in Extravagant Challenge (華麗的挑戰), which will also star Ariel Lin (where has she been in the last 2 years?). Donghae will play the main male lead, as a top star in the entertainment industry, Siwon will play the ex-boyfriend of Ariel who had dumped her after he became famous, and Ariel will play a girl who goes into the entertainment industry to extract revenge against the cruel ex-boyfriend. I have good expectations for this, because Choi Siwon and Donghae have already acted besides Ariel in her MV, Fireflies (below).\n\nAs you can see, the three of them had good chemistry, and it was pretty succesful in terms of overcoming the language barrier. Of course, it’s true that most of the mv didn’t require any talking, as Ariel was singing, BUT it is a good sign for the drama. However, one caveat I have is that, now we have 2 inept Chinese speakers in the drama, which might make it even harder. And another caveat is that Donghae (who is playing the lead) has never acted before, which to me is a bad sign. Haven’t we seen enough examples of terrible first time attempts at acting by kpop idols? Kim Hyun Joong (yes, he’s improved, but imagine how bad it would have been if he had been the main character in BOF), anyone? But, on the bright side, they’re playing celebrities, which is something they should know how to act firshand (since that’s what they are). An interesting thing about this drama is that it had previously been reported that it would star Jerry Yan and Ariel Lin, but was then put on an indefinite hiatus due to some production issues. I’m glad that this drama is back on because I really liked the manga/anime, which I found endearing, cute, and hilarious. So, I have high hopes for this drama!\n\nNext, Park Shin Hye (You’re Beautiful, Cyrano Dating Agency) has been confirmed as the star in Hayate the Combat Butler (chinese: 旋風管家) along with George Hu (K.O.3an Guo, Hot Shot, Romantic Princess).\n\nThis is an interesting pairing, as I’ve only seen George Hu in Hot Shot and Romantic Princess as a supporting character (always to Wu Chun) and I’m not sure if he’ll be able to pull off being the main character. Of course, what makes me excited about this pairing is Park Shin Hye, as I like her personality and think she’s a cute, bubbly actress. She was fun to watch in You’re Beautiful, and I’m really surprised to see her venturing into the Taiwanese market considering her skyrocketing popularity in Korea (as a result of YAB). I would have thought she would be more active in Korea now, but eh, all the better, I get to see her in a Taiwanese drama. As for the plot, I’ve never actually heard of this manga before. However, from what I have gleaned from wikipedia, it’s about an unlucky teenager who after a series of events become the butler of a rich heiress. I’m actually pretty excited to see Park Shin Hye’s portrayal of the rich heiress, I think she’s going to do a good job.\n\nAnd finally, we’ve got Goo Hye Sun (Boys Over Flowers) and Wu Chun (Romantic Princess, Hana Kimi) who will star in Absolute Boyfriend (絕對達令). Goo Hye Sun will play a girl that is unlucky in relationships, and Wu Chun will be the robot boyfriend that she gets. This is just one large catastrophe in the making. I’ll admit it, I have a soft spot for Wu Chun’s dramas, I loved both Romantic Princess and Hana Kimi. However, the prospect of him in a drama where he is half naked all the time (part of the plot) just cries to me “catastrophe in the making”. And I’ve watched one episode of the Japanese adaption of this manga, and it was extraordinarily boring. Hopefully this version will be better, but I’m not going to cross my fingers. For more info about this adaption, read my other post: Gu Hye Sun and Wu Chun in Absolute Boyfriend Remake.\n\nI suppose this strategy by GTV is the result of the high popularity that Korean dramas (and music) experience in Taiwan, and the desire of GTV to capitalize on this popularity by casting those very stars that are popular. In fact, in the past few months there has been a drastic dearth of new Taiwanese dramas. Instead, many of the Taiwanese networks chose to air popular Korean and Japanese dramas in the timeslot (CTV aired Detective Conan and FTV aired Personal Preference). So I can understand the network’s reasoning when they looked at what sells and what doesn’t in deciding what dramas to produce. Unfortunately, this is a very shocking trend for many Taiwanese fans who are worried by the use of Korean stars (it’s like the Korean stars are taking over their domestic market). I would have to agree with these fans, as I think GTV has overdone it by casting Korean actresses in the last 3 dramas that they’ve announced. In case you’re unfamiliar with how Taiwanese dramas go, in a year, there’s generally only about 3-4 primetime/idol/”trendy” dramas (excluding daily dramas) that are shown on 1 network, since drama episodes only air once a week. So this means that for the next year, GTV’s primetime (they aren’t exactly shown during primetime… I just don’t know how better to explain it) dramas will all be starring Korean actors/actresses. And since there’s only mainly 3-4 different dramas that air at a time, that means about 1/5 of the Taiwanese dramas aired next year will star Korean actors/actresses. Clearly, Korean dominance of the drama industry is becoming more widespread. I mean, look at the converse of this, how many Taiwanese celebrities do we see in Korean dramas? Hmm… none. And there are WAAY more Korean dramas produced every year, yet not one of them stars a Taiwanese celebrity as the lead.\n\nAs for me, I’m extremely curious as to how this will play out. Especially considering that none of these Korean stars have a strong grasp of Chinese, I wonder how they will communicate on set. Will there be a translator all the time? In addition, I’m extremely curious as to how this language barrier will play out in the dramas. Will the Korean actors/actresses speak in choppy Chinese or will their lines be dubbed (substituting the Korean actor/actress’s voice with that of a Chinese voice actor). Also, I think it would have made more sense for GTV to test out the waters, before plunging in, because I feel like these collabarations have the potential to be good and extremely popular, but on the other hand, have the potential to be horrific failures. For example, My Lucky Star, which starred Yoo Hana (Sons of Sol Pharmacy House) before she was even known in Korea, was a pretty big hit in Taiwan. They managed to maneuver around the language issue by dubbing her voice, with Yoo Hana also making big efforts to learn Chinese (thereby bridging the gap on set). So I think if it’s done well, these three dramas could be really good/popular, because they already have established Korean celebrities (with large fanbases to support them).\n\nAnyways, I’m looking forward to seeing how these new collaborations will turn out!"
