        "text": "Love sells, in whatever forms or manifestation – be it romantic novels, romantic-comedic movies, dramas, and even porn.\n\nLove – I suppose that’s one of the reasons for liking “Sweet Relationship”. I love the love between the two leading characters, the way the characters interact on screen… so much so that it made me yearn “it” as well, something I’ve shoved aside and ignored for the longest time.\n\nThe premise is simple; girl meets boy, falls for him by the third episode or so, but that love is unrequited, or so she thought, but in fact, boy is slowly falling for her as well, but refuses to admit it, fearing that it’s too good to be true – this flawed psyche a result of a childhood trauma. Then you get other supporting characters who likes the main characters as well, and want a piece of them.\n\nAnd so the story goes, revolving around food at the same time. You see, the girl -Bai Hui (Patty Hou) – is a rich young lady-turned-poor girl after the death of her father. Her only talent is her taste buds – she’s a great food critic – and she decides to be chef and wants to learn under boy – Zhi Tian (Vic Zhou), a talented chef who works at a small family restaurant, which according to some, is a waste of his talents.\n\nRatings for the show fell short of expectations, with most viewers complaining that Bai Hui and Zhi Tian spent too much quarreling and fighting. It was up against Angela Chang and Wu Chun’s “Romantic Princess” that year. Somewhat affected by this hearsay, I avoided this drama until recently, for some reason, I got in the mood for it and dug it from the bottom of a mountain of drama boxsets.\n\nTo get a taste of the show, I played an episode at random and chanced upon a scene from the third episode, where Patty Hou’s character had to drag, literally, a seriously ill and half-conscious Zhi Tian home. That scene pretty much set the tone and direction of the show, and it was just plain good all the way after that.\n\nThis show made me a Patty Hou fan. She is extremely likeable in her debut screen role as the loveable and slightly dense Bai Hui. Hou, in person bu the way, is an extremely smart and witty host. Her transition from a newbie actress to getting in-character was startling – you can see a sharp learning curve, and even before halfway of the show, she’s become Bai Hui. She was so in character that Vic had to constantly remind her not to invest too much emotions in it, or she’ll have a hard time getting out of character. In any case, she’s got my respect as an actress.\n\nVic Chou, despite his constant frowns, is endearing here as well. The other noteworthy performer is Alan Kuo, who was just as good as in his debut role, as an apprentice chef who has a crush on Bai Hui.\n\nThere are other reasons why this drama ticks – one of the them is the director. I was drawn by the way the story was told and progressed – and that’s basically the job of the scriptwriter and director. Of course, the actors are an important part in this respect, but as important is the director, who manned the pacing of the story and is tasked with drawing out the charms of the characters. Director Cui You Ning couldn’t have done a better job.\n\nCui is famed for directing ISWAK, which I thought I’ll hate, but was charmed at the end. I remembered avoiding ISWAK conscientiously because it was too popular, because I wasn’t ready to watch it, and because I wasn’t too fond of Ariel Lin. I saw it finally two years after it first TX-ed, and wondered to myself how much I would’ve missed if I’ve never seen it in my lifetime.\n\nNever listen to nay-sayers – seemed like a lesson I never learnt. Then again, timing was important. I would not have felt the same if I’ve seen it then, and not now.\n\nI’m guessing the majority of viewers who wrote off this drama probably felt it wasn’t as romantic – expectations at play here. It was also sad to hear that the producers lost money over this production – they over-ran on shooting time (the team spend 9 months working on this project) and budget (the director is known for his strict standards in production).\n\nI do appreaciate efforts and hardwork put in by the team – note the piping hot and beautifully crafted French delicacies – and I can truly feel the sense of happiness and sweetings, which did move me, and am grateful for. I could remember the countless times I caught myself smiling stupidly at myself. This show is a wonderful find – definitely a keeper.\n\nAt a press conference before shooting began, Patty Hou commented that she’s looking forward to working in show and said it would be fun working with Vic who is a funny person. I think she might have realized how wrong she was even before shooting wrapped up. In an interview on her talk show on Azio, where her guests were Vic and Mark Chao who were promoting their latest drama “Black & White”, she revealed that Vic hardly speaks to anyone on the set – which is a known fact. Still, she had a wonderful time working on “Sweet Relationship”, evident in the body language and the friendship between the two former co-stars."
