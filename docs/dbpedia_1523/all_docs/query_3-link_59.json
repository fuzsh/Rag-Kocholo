        "text": "Since 1953, when Japanese television went on air fo r the first time, television dramas have played a central role in affecting and reflecting o n Japanese society, its identity, and its relationship with others. 1 Japanese television drama traditionally concentrat ed on the everyday life of “everyday” (urban) middle class fa milies, Japanese minorities and foreigners remaining very much outside its focus. This lack o f focus on the diversity inherent within Japanese society can, in turn, be seen to have cont ributed to a variety of other reflections on the nature of Japanese society as a homogeneous cul t ral zone. Indeed, it could be suggested that Japanese television dramas have helped to unde rpi and reinforce a ‘myth of homogeneity’ of the Japanese people—a myth also pro pagated by the nihonjinron (theories on the uniqueness of the Japanese) writing of the 7 0s and 80s.\n\nThis paper examines how many Japanese women interpret the historical and cultural texts in Korean television drama Daejanggeum by relating them to their contemporary desires, expectations and aspirations. Based on ethnographic data gathered from more than 50 months of fieldwork in Japan and South Korea, this study contends that the specific historicity and cultural contexts of popular television programs do not matter as much as what Japanese women make of their transnational media consumption, and how it can evoke self-reflexivity and offer new possibilities for viewers to transcend and transform their social realities in ways that project them as contemporary subjects. This study extends existing scholarship on the Korean Wave by exploring the specific and diverse the ways in which Japanese women watch television in an active, engaged and critical manner with the aim of constructing their self-identities as contemporary subjects.\n\nThe history of Japanese television drama is nearly as old as the history of Japanese television itself. Since the first production was aired the same year television emerged there (in 1953), television dramas have been highly successful. Although the influence of American family dramas and movies was enormous, Japanese TV stations – both private and public – soon began producing their own dramas, which over time became more popular than American productions (Hirahara 1991a: 19-20)."
