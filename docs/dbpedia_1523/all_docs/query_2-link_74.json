        "text": "Chances are that if you’ve stumbled across this article, you’re either a kdrama/jdrama/any other type of drama looking forward to trying to expand your drama love into Taiwanese dramas, or perhaps you’ve watched Taiwanese dramas when you were a newbie, but you’ve slowly drifted away as you grown up from your rookie profile. Anyhow, as a 3 year Taiwanese drama watcher, I think I got a few tricks up my sleeve BOOM tips, as well as recommendations to get you started with.\n\nThings to Know~~ (I’m a knowledge Master shh..)\n\nTaiwanese Dramas ≠ Chinese Dramas\n\nWhile both Taiwanese Dramas and Chinese Dramas use Mandarin as their main language, they are NOT THE SAME!!! For some reason, I get super mad when someone believes they are the same, even though it is a common misconception. Taiwan has long far developed their own government and is independent from China (this is all thanks to my 3-month project on Taiwan). They’re filmed in different countries, for one, as well as different accents, actors, and broadcasting stations.\n\nYou may hear some weird language switches… (One of my favourite things!)\n\nLike I mentioned, the main language used is Mandarin, also one of the official languages of Taiwan. However, occasionally, you may hear someone speaking in Taiwanese, or often known as as Hokkien. It’s used a lot more in the older generation, such as parents or grandparents. They might also throw in some random words, here and there when conversing. When you first start watching Taiwanese dramas, you may not hear the difference, but after a while, you’ll notice the subtle change in the way the characters speak.\n\nSame Drama Tropes, Same Ridiculous Storylines… Sigh\n\nThis…. could come as a con, or a pro depending on what you want to watch. While Taiwanese dramas are different from say, a kdrama, they are still both “dramas” and include the same type of tropes, ranging from love triangles, evil rich families, bad boy/poor girl, or accidental kisses.Yes, this includes those super-duper cliche lines like, “Believe me, alright?” or “Why would you like me? I’m just a country girl.” I, personally, don’t mind these things, however, I do mind the same unnecessary slow parts of a drama, including the “I’m breaking up with you because I can’t love you” storyline, or the “I have to listen to my family and marry this girl even though I love you” storyline.\n\nMore Episodes = More Fangirling! (Possibly more “When is this going to end?!”)\n\nLike the subtopic above, this could come as a win-win to some, or a big, fat facepalm to others. Unless it’s a daily run drama (running almost every single day a week), most, what I call “typical” dramas range from 16-30 episodes. From what I’ve watched from other countries, most “typical” dramas are usually 10-20 episodes, so this definitely changes the storyline. If it’s a great storyline, having more episodes is great! More time for character development, more time for cute couple scenes, more time for even more mysteries! However… this also means, more time for a storyline that seriously does not need to drag on, or more time for the second female lead to plan an evil scheme.\n\nOoohhh Theme Songs?\n\nOkay, so I’m aware that the majority of Lakorn, Doramas, and even HK dramas have theme songs so this is something that’s normal for y’all watchers, but for some reason kdramas decide to cut it out or have incredibly short ones that don’t capture the essence of a true theme song, in my opinion of course. Taiwanese dramas’ theme songs usually are about 1-2+ minutes, which might get tiring to hear after a while. For some, it’s perfect to jam out to the opening of a new episode each week, or for other addicts, you might want to just get into the juicy stuff right away and find yourself skipping the theme song. Anyhow, just don’t be too shocked if you hear random singing you weren’t expecting when watching your first Taiwanese drama.\n\nMain Broadcasting Stations!!\n\nI usually don’t mind which dramas come from which broadcasting stations, but I do know people who are more invested in dramas just because of which station it’s broadcasted on. This is also a great way to know which dramas are more likely to get subtitled faster!\n\nSETTV (The MAIN MAIN ONE, aka, the only ones DramaFever bothers subbing)\n\n*also known as SET Metro, SET Taiwan\n\nWhile I’m not sure this is true for people in Taiwan, most fans worldwide mostly watch SETTV dramas. These dramas star the more “popular” and notable actors and actresses, including Aaron Yan (Fall In Love With Me, Just You), George Hu (Love Now, Love Around), Annie Chen (Love Now, Love Around), and Megan Lai (Bromance). These dramas usually follow the romantic comedy style, with about 20 episodes per drama. As I’m aware, they’re filmed at the same time as it’s being aired, so the script might change, or it may get an extension of episodes if the ratings are high.\n\nWhat I really love about SETTV, however, is that it’s the only broadcasting station (that I’m aware of anyway) that has an end-of-year award ceremony held in December. It’s also a great way to find out which dramas are worth watching from a certain year. If you look up “Sanlih Drama Awards,” you should be able to find short clips as well as the list of previous years.\n\nGTV (Mainly idol dramas, but most of my favourite dramas are found here ^_^)\n\nSome celebrities from SETTV have actually started their career in acting as an idol on GTV. While the hype for GTV dramas has died down drastically, I think that they’ve produced some incredibly precious gems. They’re known for making their dramas over-the-top with bright colours and everything, but aren’t most idol dramas like that? Asides from a very few exceptions, GTV storylines can range from… anywhere to anything. Whether it’s solving crimes, having magical powers, or an incredibly hilarious love line involving a guy with a mushroom haircut. You remember how I mentioned Aaron Yan and George Hu from above? Well, yah, they came from GTV years, years, back when they were in boy bands. Ahh, the good old days.\n\nCTV (Just other dramas, here and there.)\n\nWhile my first drama was broadcasted by CTV, this station honestly holds no sentimental place in my heart. I think it has made some great productions throughout the years, but it hasn’t gotten as much attention hallyu wise. What I really like about CTV is the casting choices. It brings two amazing actors that I both love together. And even when I thought to myself, “Well, that pairing is kind of weird…” CTV does a great job of utilizing their chemistry. It’s like putting together potato chips and ice cream. Not something you’d expect together, yet they end up complimenting each other very well.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nWait, what? All the dramas I listed up there ^^^ are still not enough to get you started on your journey? Okay, okay, here are some more recommendations below. Some of them aren’t technically ones I’ve watched, but they’re ones I’ve heard good enough things about to put them here 🙂\n\nRomantic Comedies:\n\nMurphy’s Law of Love (2015) – SETTV\n\nPleasantly Surprised (2014) -SETTV\n\nBrown Sugar Macchiato (2007) – GTV\n\nJust You (2013) – SETTV\n\nMystery:\n\nBlack and White (2009) – PTS\n\nPi Li MIT (2008) – GTV\n\nMagic:\n\nK.O.
