        "text": "Note: I have updated the first paragraph to address some situations in which visitors to my blog often ask me questions about Korean culture. Please read this introductory statement carefully, because previous visitors do not seem to have done so. While I appreciate the visits please take into account that I am not an expert on Korean cultural or historical matters. I watch Korean drama, that doesn’t make me a Korean sociologist or historian.\n\nFirst of all, I am not Korean. I do not speak Korean. What I understand of Korean culture barely scratches the surface. Let me repeat that, I am not Korean, I do not speak fluent Korean, I have never lived in Korea, I am not an expert on the culture and what I know of the culture barely scratches the surface. In other words do not ask me deep questions about Korean culture. If you want to study Korean culture please do your own homework as this is not an authoritative site on Korean culture. You can start with some of the links on my links page. Oh look, I mentioned that in my original post below. Also, Google is a wonderful and useful tool, employ it. I hate to say it this way, but I am borrowing from one of my hobby groups to say, “Do your own homework, just like everyone else, and don’t be an askhole.”\n\nTherefore this list is simply what I wish someone had first told me when I stumbled on to the fantastic world of Korean Drama so that I was not lost thinking things like look at all these wonderful characters but why can’t they hug in public? It is a really a very basic K Drama list for Dummies Newbies. After you get your feet wet and begin trying to understand very BASIC cultural and language elements of DRAMAS, I suggest you visit korean culture and other k drama resource blogs. You will find one that fits you. Dramabeans, has some excellent information for beginners and is run by Americans of Korean descent. The recaps that Dramabeans does are also really helpful when you are learning your way into K Drama Land because they are generally middle of the road. This is the value of Dramabeans, it helps non-korean/non-korean speaking newbies a place to “keep up” with dramas when they don’t exactly understand what is going on due to cultural differences, pop culture references, and of course the language barrier. Also Ask A Korean has great insight to cultural information, but is not a K Drama specific site. This link is you tube links/channels from people that post various instructional info that is quite helpful: Newbie Help.\n\nAlso, please check out the Links for other webpages and blogs.\n\nOkay, now to my actual list of things that that Newbies might need to know to ease into Korean Drama. The idea here is that Newbies get to say, okay, now I need to do FURTHER research, maybe?"
