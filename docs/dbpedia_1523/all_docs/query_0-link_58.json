        "text": "Basic Infomation\n\nTitle: Bull Fighting | Dou Niu Yao Bu Yao (Trans: literally, do you want to bull fight) |鬥牛。要不要\n\nGenre: romance, sports, basketball\n\nYear: 2008\n\nEpisodes: 17\n\nOpening theme song: Dou Niu . Yao Bu Yao (鬥牛。要不要) By TANK and Yoga (Lin You Jia)\n\nEnding theme song: Ni Zui Jin Hai Hao Ma? (你最近還好嗎？) By S.H.E\n\nSynopses:\n\nIt started as a 3-on-3 basketball competition between two rival schools; an annual event in which the winner would control the 13th Street basketball court for the following year. To everybody’s surprise, the 9-year reigning champion lost this year… and it was all because of one girl. Now, this game has a new purpose.\n\nYi Sheng Xue (Hebe Tien), a hot-headed young girl, is an avid Bull Fighting fan. At her side is her loyal childhood friend and personal bodyguard, Jin Zi Cong (Lee Wei). Their lives take a drastic turn when they meet Shen Ruo He (Mike He), whom Sheng Xue falls deeply in love with. However, they encounter many obstacles that stand in the way of them being together.\n\nWill love triumph over evil? And will Zi Cong be able to live with seeing the woman he loves, love another man?\n\nCast:\n\n・Hebe Tian as Yi Sheng Xue\n\n・Mike He as Shen Ruo He\n\n・Lee Wei as Zi Chong\n\nThe cast. Aren’t they an attractive bunch? /esteem takes hit/\n\nThoughts:\n\nGosh it’s been years since I first watched this. As a huge fan of Taiwanese music back in the day (Ok 2001 but it seems like forever!) I was really into bands such as Fahrenheit and S.H.E, who’s singer (H) – Hebe, is the main actress in this so I was of course, intrigued, especially since she was acting alongside a Taiwanese drama favourite of mine, Mike He (Love Contract, Devil Beside You…) this was of course a must watch, even though I am really not into sport-related dramas (I can’t get into them!). Lee Wei you might remember from My Lucky Star, another drama that is one of my top faves and of course (Jimmy Lin, can I say anymore?) and more recently Hi My Sweetheart (with Rainie Yang and Show Lo) and Lovestore At The Corner.\n\nThe drama is almost worth watching for Mike He’s hair styles alone lol…\n\nI’ll start with the romance element of this first, I think. I must say, what Hebe lacks in acting experience she makes up for with her forceful gazes (Which Mike He is definitely skilled for). However, I didn’t exactly feel a connection between the two main characters, Sheng Xue and Ruo He and the romance felt so… Forced. Ruo He seems like an imitation of Dao Ming Si’s in Meteor Garden, with the guy being forceful then backing off etc. It’s not that I don’t like that kinda romance (I loved Boys over Flowers, after all), but It’s kinda getting cliché and how they had Sheng Xue made out to be a strong figure but to suddenly become weak in those situations kinda had me going, well, meh. Put it this way, there’s 3 kisses in the entire drama and they all happen in one episode! Come on, producers, spread the love out!\n\nStand off.\n\nHebe as an actress is something I’d always supported, but felt wary of at the same time. So many Idols move into acting and a lot of time it really doesn’t play over well, but Hebe is suited for acting, that much is for sure. Just… Not this particular drama, I think. Maybe it’s because she was opposite Mike He, who has such a strong on-screen presence yet the two felt like brother and sister. Who knows?\n\nAnyway, her character is strong willed, sassy and yet a little spoilt and childish, nothing new character wise that we haven’t seen, but Hebe pulls the roll off well. With her natural cute look I was pleasantly surprised that Hebe pulled off such a Tom-Boy like roll, so Kudos for that, it’s not an easy thing to do to look so damn cute and pretty and act so tough haha. I just wish her character had been consistent, but then…. Seeing such a tiny girl shouting at the likes of bad boy Ruo He was amusing as heck.\n\nWhere as she won’t win any awards I don’t think for acting (Correct me if she has, but I can’t find anything about it online?).\n\nHebe ‘Sheng Xue’ & Mike ‘Ruo He’\n\nMike is of course an actor I really, reaaally liked ‘back in the day’. I say that because back then, I was young and attracted to the intense way his characters seem to love and of course his intense, smouldering stares. I’ve actually not seen any of his dramas since Love Keeps Going, but since that time I have broadened my range of dramas and have discovered that actually… I think I placed him on too high a pedestal, but then again I know he shows potential (He hasn’t had his dramas become best rated and well loved even over seas for nothing!)\n\nI feel like his characters are usually so flat and dull and suited more for the 13-15 year old audience, rather than adults (Ironic, because I was around that age range when I watched him dramas originally!). Rou We was a character who comes across as a bad boy, but actually I think he’s kinda regular and I kinda love that for once, it’s the girl doing the chasing, though Rou We does have his moments, of course.\n\nHere’s a powerful quote from the drama which I really, reaaaally liked that Rou We says to Sheng Xui:\n\nYi Sheng Xue , why can’t you for once do something that’s not beyond my expectations? Helping me doesn’t have to use this rotten method. It’s just you, who’s obviously lonely, acting cool like a stupid pig who wants to liberate (or save) me). This time, let me be your liberator (saviour) … May I?\n\nWhen the girl becomes the saviour… Sometimes the male lead gets a little emasculated no? Hehehe…\n\nMike it’s illegal to look that good holding a metal link fence okay…\n\nNow we have Lee Wei as Zi Chong, who as a second male lead did a brilliant job (Gotta love the second male lead syndrome!). He reminded me so much of Kingone Wang that I had to re-look at the credits at first to confirm it was him who played this roll (It’s been years since I last watched this, after all). But I was impressed by his portrayal of Zi Chong, who was Shen Xui’s bodyguard (He can protect me anyday…). I could really feel his love for Shen Xui without him really having to voice it, Lee Wei showed his characters feelings through his expressions and body language, something which I respect him for as an actor. As for his character itself… It will be hard pressed to find a more whipped love interest. I get it he’s her body guard and what not, but really? She is comfortable enough to have him in her room without seeing him as a man for the love of- Sometimes I just want to shake him – Poor baby.\n\nLee Wei ‘Zi Chong’ your eyes speak volumes.\n\nThe pacing of this drama I must say is shocking. The flashbacks are way too many and everything seems to rushed (I get romance dramas usually are) but for the character to fall for the other in the space of like 2 episodes? Really? There’s no gradual attraction in this, it’s just full on LUST of you ask me, but if you don’t think too deeply about the semantics of it all and just focus on the fluff, it is an enjoyable watch. But some scenes are just plain cheese overload (Please watch and discuss with me about the feathers… Please, I’d love to know some one else’s thoughts!)\n\nThat glare from Rou We to Zi Chong is priceless! If looks could kill…\n\nPK Rating:\n\n(3) / (5)\n\nFluffy watch that requires no real thinking other than to enjoy where it takes you ~\n\nYou might also like:\n\n– Hot Shot (2008 – 2009) — similar themes (romance & sport – basket ball, too) about basket ball recruitment fighting for spots on the team and of course, love.

S.H.E is one of my favourite Taiwanese bands so of course I’m a little bias but… I’ll let you judge for yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFhtrabk1RA — S.H.E – Zui Jin Hai Hao Ma\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5AawqYtzTI – S.H.E Ni zui jin hai hao ma\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJPqxjut64c — Lai Bu Ji – Hebe Tian\n\nThat’s just a few of many of the amazing tracks on the ost.\n\nRate this:\n\nBasic Information:\n\nTitle: Skip Beat! | 華麗的挑戰 | Extravagant Challenge | Glamourous Challenge\n\nGenre: romance, comedy, fantasy, manga based\n\nEpisodes: 15\n\nSynopses:\n\nHigh school graduate Gong Xi gives up her chances for university in order to support her childhood friend and romantic goal, Bu Po Shang, in his pop idol career. Upon arriving in Taipei, Gong Xi starts working on multiple jobs in order to support Shang, whose popularity quickly rises, eventually becoming one of the top idols in Taiwan.\n\nOne day, Gong Xi catches Shang flirting with his manager, and learns that he only used her so she can help him with his living expenses. Heart-broken and betrayed, Gong Xi vows to get revenge by becoming a bigger star. Gong Xi auditions for L.M.E., Taiwan’s largest talent agency, and joins L.M.E.’s new-found department “Love Me” with Jiang Nanqin, also a new recruit.\n\nAt L.M.E. famous actor Dun Helian, disgusted by Gong Xi’s reasons for joining the show business, consistently finds ways to annoy and taunt her. As Gong Xi’s acting career starts to take off, she begins to discover a new sense of identity and purpose, separate from her initial plans of revenge.\n\nLian also eventually warms up to her, and although at first in denial, he finds himself falling more and more in love with her.\n\nCast:\n\n・Ivy Chen as Kyoko Mogami\n\n・Choi Siwon as Ren Tsuruga\n\n・Lee Donghae as Shotaro Fuwa\n\n・Bianca Bai as Kanae Kotonami\n\nThoughts:\n\nPlease excuse me while I fangirl. /OMG KPOP IDOLS IN A DRAMA AAAGGHHHHHH/\n\nAnd I’m back.\n\nOk wow, what a great cast and amazing plot (the manga is great)! Where to even begin with this? I suppose I’ll talk about the casting, first, in which many if you may (or may not…) know that Ariel Lin and Jerry Yan were supposed to be the main roles. Now, I was excited about this (Ariel is from Love Contract opposite Mike He, It Started With A Kiss with Joe Cheng, and Jerry from Meteor Garden with Barbie Hsu, a down With Love with Ella Chen). They are both HUGE in the Taiwanese Drama scene, and I literally have grown up watching them on screen, so I was disappointed when I was informed they wouldn’t be starring in this anymore.\n\nHowever, then I heard Ivy Chen was replacing Ariel, and I couldn’t be upset anymore. Smiling Pasta was a drama that I watched over and over back in high school, and I was always curious about where she had gone after six years of not seeing her.\n\nThen, of course, we have Siwon and Donghae. As a ELf myself (and more specificly, a FISHIE), I was so excited about seeing the two of them. This Drama was an absolute MUST watch, and after waiting ages for subs, I finally watched it. Now I’ve rewatched it, and it’s still great 🙂\n\nLts start by discussing the cast more closely (heheh)\n\nIvy Chen playing Magami was great. She really does an amazing job as a energetic, emotional girl who has just curved probably the worst heart break a girl can have. She pulls of the cute, innocent if a little dim personality off naturally, whilst also portraying a more dark, cynical and almost broken attitude. Her acting is filled with great facial expressions, lots of attitude and you can tell she’s really giving her acting 100%, because despite the weird situations her character is in, she pulls it off naturally and effortlessly. A great come back, in my opinion.\n\nChoi Siwon as Ren was a roll in a little iffy about. The first is the fact that it’s not even his voice he hear, but a voice actor (who even changes after episode two, which I personally noticed.) Although he plays a great calm, sophisticated professional well, without being able to express himself emotively through his acting his character just seemed lacking a bit flat and plain. He has no real substance to his character and at times, he’s almost a little TOO calm and serene. I didn’t sense the darkness that supposedly is supposed to be an undercurrent of his character at all, which is a shame, because Siwon really is the embodiment of Ren (hehe..)\n\nLee Donghae… now now, where do I begin? Superb acting, truly. He really portrayed his character well, giving us attitude, arrogance, shallowness and an icy attitude whilst also showing a jealous insecure side. His intense looks were very moving, and he was very good at expressing is feeling through facial expressions, which made for a more powerful feeling to his character, who is supposed to be quite intense and also a bit childish.\n\nBianca Bia plays the reluctant friend perfectly. At first her character is so cold and full of herself, making us dislike her, but as Mogami warms up to her we begin to see a softer side, and begin to warm up to her. Her acting has come a long way since her days in Fated To a love You, and it was great to see her on the big screen again. I love her.\n\nWhat I felt let down this drama the most is the awful CGI. I wish they could have knocked up the budget and got some better CGI, because the evil sprite figures, which of course are animated, were really painful to watch, as well as hear. Their voices were cringe worthy, and I’m sure not sure if this was intentional or not…\n\nOther transitions from the manga also didn’t come across well, such as the speed of her bike riding, which although quite comical, looked awful and was more funny for its absolute cheapness. Again, I’m not sure if this was intentional or not.\n\nAs for the romance… Really, it was quite none existent. The only real romantic tension I could feel was from Ivy and Donghae, and that was more reluctant on their characters parts. I wished the series could have been longer, because certain aspects felt rushed, where as I would have liked to see them fleshed out more.\n\nNever the less, this drama IS very funny, and I found myself laughing at LEAST once her episode, even at parts that aren’t obviously gag moments. It’s jut that well done, and despite the seriousness of the plot line, the drama is amassing and a very light, heart warming watch, because what’s not to love about Mogami?\n\nPK Rating:\n\n4 / (5)\n\n“SO funny! And the character do a great job. loved it, was very entertained.” ~\n\nYou might also like:\n\n– My Girlfriend Is A Gumiho (2010) — Has a fantasy theme and is almost about revenge I suppose… The Gumiho was locked in a painting after she was unable to find a husband, and manages to trick a young college student into freeing her, where she rebels against the grandmother who locked her in the painting to find love I wrote a review, HERE.\n\n– High School Debut (2011) — Not really he same genre exactly, but is similar in terms of a girl discovering love (and it was a manga, too). I’ve wrote a review which you can read HERE.\n\nExtra:\n\nI expected the OST to be amazing, and I wasn’t disappointed.

Wowee.\n\nBasic Information:\n\nTitle: 惡魔在身邊 / E Mo Zai Shen Bian\n\nAlso known as: Devil Beside You, Devils Do Exist\n\nGenre: Romance, comedy\n\nEpisodes: 14 (TV Broadcast), 20 (DVD)\n\nSynopsis:\n\nQi Yue finally gained the courage to give Yuan Yi her love letter. Yuan Yi didn’t see her handing him the note and walked passed her. Jiang Meng, the troublemaker, the devil, was the one who accepted her note. Qi Yue, begging that the note wasn’t meant for him, he didn’t listen.\n\nHe wanted what he wants and his desire was Qi Yue. Even though having a cruel appearance , Ah Meng’s heart is kind and caring, which touched Qi Yue. The big problem remained – Ah Meng is the son of the man Qi Yue’s mother is going to marry.\n\nEven though they were not related by blood, what will happen when they become step brother-sister, how will it affect their relationship, what happens when other lovers come into the picture?\n\nFind out on Devil Beside You, it will make you laugh, cry, and make your heart feel fuzzy.\n\nCast :\n\n• Mike He as Jiang Meng 江猛\n\n• Rainie Yang as Qi Yue 齊悅\n\n• Kingone Wang as Sang Yuan Yi 尚源伊\n\n• Tsai Pei Lin as Qing Zi (晴紫)\n\nThoughts :\n\nSuch a great Drama, and the first by Rainie Yang, Mike He and Kingone Wang I watched. The storyline is funny (if a little OTT – but then again, most TDramas are). The cast list has great chemistry – so much so that they all stared together in another Drama!\n\nI’d like to first point out that I originally watched this Drama back in 2006 and I was a lot younger, so found the acting to be cute and the plot line and situations to be oh so romantic. Upon watching this recently to write an accurate review, I am now a lot older and found the “cute” acting over the top, the situations a little WTFery and the styles out dated. Now, I have heard young girls watching this drama recently and they loved it (except they found it “old” and the clothing “unfashionable”, so maybe it’s my age… I’ll let you judge it yourself.)\n\nNow, the plot itself is a lot like It Started With A Kiss (with the whole Love Note – Moving into guys house sorta thing) but the main difference is Qi Yue’s love note wasn’t for Jiang Meng and its all a big mix up! So hilarious! A lot of people compare this to the plot of Marmalade Boy, and admittedly I’ve seen that Drama, but it was waaay back in 2003, but from what is can remember of that series, but I can see where the similarities are (“step siblings” moving into together, having an attraction for one another, love rivals etc), but I’d say the differences aren’t too obvious.\n\nOne thing I’d like to point out is the date which this aired (2005). Back then clothing styles were different and so was technology. A lot of people even refer to this as an “old” drama, but for oldies like me, these sort of dramas are what started us on the Asian Drama love-fest, and though “dated”, they are still very great watches and I’m actually surprised this hasn’t been remade, since BOF & ISWAK have been… They probably will in the future, it honestly wouldn’t surprise me. (But nobody could replace Mike He… Nonomonono…)\n\nThe cast is great and the episodes are well spaced out, not rushed, which I liked. Their styles are also quite cool, and whoever the stylist was, thumbs up! I loved Mike He and Raines hair!! You will also find that like in most T-Dramas, the characters are more… Open? Their chemistry starts a lot sooner, and you don’t have to wait until the LAST scene in the drama to see the two main leads kiss. In fact, I’d go as far as to say even the kisses themselves are a whole lot raunchier (if you love a good kiss scene, you won’t be disappointed.) The relationships between characters also seems more mature, and they seem to act more like couples (one word – glove scenes…).\n\nRainie Yang as Qi Yue was amazing, an her roll as Qu Yue In DBY began my fandom of her (I had seen her in Meteor Garden, but her roll wasn’t really that prominent.) She’s quirky, innocent and a shy, plain girl, as is normally typical in a Asian Drama heroine, who is conflicted between two Men. You can really feel her confusion over their ‘step sibling’ love situation and Rainie shows her characters growth in confidence in herself, and her relationships.\n\nMy only complaint is that her acting in this Drama isn’t AS good as others I’d seen her in (mainly Hi, My Sweetheart) but you could argue that this was one of her very earlier major acting rolls (Her acting in The Love Book was horrible, too mopey…) but then again Godfather In Pink was also a lead roll and was before this, so I’m not really sure what to say, other than perhaps it was how the director told her to act – over the top facial expressions, over the top movements etc?) her voice too is quite whiney and a bit… Childish.\n\n– I’d recommend google Rainie Yang. I highly recommend watching ALL her Dramas, they’re all great, especially Hi, My Sweetheart, Why Why Love & ToGetHer.\n\nMike He as Jiang Meng was… Just WOW! I would give his acting alone 5 Stars, he plays the “bad boy who gets what he wants” to a T, whilst also showing a softer, kind hearted side that makes every girl who watches this mushy. I honestly fell in love with Jiang Meng after this Drama, since he’s so loveable (if a little spoilt) or rather, Mike and portraying him was. And those romantic scenes… My my, him alone acting those out made me want to stick around (hehe /guilty/). He also is a damn good kisser, and all his kissing scenes are great (even in other dramas!)\n\nNow, my only complaint here is how much of a emphasis they put on him being bad, and sometimes it came across as a little OTT and some what in-your-face with the motorbikes. Bad boy clothing and gang of 4 equally hot guys (F4, anyone?)\n\n– Again, watch more Dramas with Mike He, he’s a great actor and plays such a wide range of characters. (He’s also pretty handsome!!) I’d recommend Love Contract and Bull Fighting off the top of my head.\n\nKingone Wang, who plays Qi Yue’s original love interest Sang Yuan Yi was great, and he showed his skills to play the charming, soft Basketball captain and also the harsh love interest scorned. My only real complaint about him was his character himself, which I suppose isn’t a complaint at all? If you’ve watched the Drama you’ll probably understand my frustration, but if you haven’t… Watch it and you will. (Grumble…)\n\nyeah yeah we know… Try DOING something about it!\n\nI’ve seen a lot of people pining for a second series, but to be honest, I’m glad with what was given. The ending was amazing and a follow up would just drag it on the emotional turmoil too much (BOF ISWAK…) especially since this Drama is so old (2005).\n\nNOTE: Rainie Yang, Mike He & Kingone Wang also stared in Why Why Love with a similar-ish plot line, a must watch if you liked this! Tsai Pei Lin is also in My Lucky Star (an all time favourite of mine) though not as a lead.\n\n— PK rating:\n\n(3) / (5)\n\nA “retro” watch, but a must see!! Just beware that the first few episodes are quite… Well, pants, but it does get better! (Unfortunately, Rainie still acts childish…)\n\nYou might also like:\n\n– It Started With A Kiss (2005) – A drama which revolves around a love letter given, though the plot is very different (the main lead doesn’t exactly act lovingly towards the girl…) worth the watch, but may seem a little, old? To new viewers of Asian Dramas, so check out Playful Kiss (which is a remake of ISWAK, and as the same plot, but different actors and set in a more modern time!\n\n– Marmalade Boy (2002) – Wow. 2002 huh? Yeah, the styles in this are old, but the plots very similar to DBY. I actually love this series and watched it before DBY (I saw it back in the day so… I’m not sure how I would perceive it now, almost 10 years later when I’m more mature (kinda… Sorta…)\n\nExtra:\n\nGreat songs featured in the Drama:\n\n・ Ai Mei by Rainie Yang (http://youtu.be/mebzXfWi87E) how beautiful is this song? And that video is… Wow, powerful.\n\n・ Li Xiang Qing Ren Ideal Lover by Rainie Yang (http://youtu.be/2O2bBhjudXw) Mike He is very cute in this… He looks so sweet haha!\n\n・ Set Me Free by Huang Yida (http://youtu.be/ulC-mfmXX-8) man, I love Huang Yida, his voice… It’s so beautiful.\n\nAnd lately…\n\n・ Chou Nan Ran – Huang Yida (黃義達) (http://youtu.be/d8awCkFG2jo) this is the full song, and it’s actually the opening track to Devil Beside You. It’s an absolutely kick ass song, though I don’t really understand the video… Hehe.\n\n– the Music in this is AH-Mazing and it’s not often I enjoy music in dramas (other than Heartstrings, You’re beautiful & Boys over flowers of course…)\n\nRate this:"
