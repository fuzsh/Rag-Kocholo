This class will look at the representation of historical moments from the Civil War to Hurricane Katrina, the production of cinematic stereotypes as well as their appropriation for subversive purposes, and the gradual evolution of multi-culturalism as a central factor in the stories told and the telling of stories on the American screen.

We see such innovative narrative forms in Hollywood films such as Source Code (Duncan Jones, 2011), Inception (Christopher Nolan, 2010), and Butterfly Effects (Eric Bress and J.Mackye Gruber, 2004), as well as in TV serials such as FlashForward (ABC, 2009-10) and Russian Doll (Netflix,2019), not to mention global art cinema Too Many Ways to Be No.1 (Wai Ka-fai, 1997) and Peppermint Candy (Chang Dong Lee, 1999). Named \"puzzle films,\" \"mind-game films,\" or \"complex TV,\" these films and series manifest common new features, such as non-linear narratives, jumbled chronologies, labyrinthine spatial orientation; they creatively use time travel, multiverse, compulsive repetition, and loops to transcend spatial-temporal limitations. These films play with our perception of the reality, present new psychological and cognitive challenges, and thereby create new spectatorial pleasure. This course teaches students to enjoy, view, closely analyze, and critically think about films and series of complex storytelling. Reading these films along with recent film and television studies scholarship, students learn analytical skills and conceptual frameworks to untangle the convoluted narrative logic and discern in the narrative architecture new modes of rethinking identity, reality, history, and future in our contemporary societies.

We will consider historical, cultural, and industrial aspects of the superhero genre across comic books, films, television series, and video games. Focusing on multiple media allows us to examine an array of medium-specific and cross-media issues (e.g., how criticism of superhero films as \"not cinema\" reflects a legacy of comics being perceived as juvenile). Our study will encompass a number of critical frameworks, including myth, adaptation, gender, race, and transmedia storytelling.

It will explore theories of representation, surveillance, authenticity, truth, and realism in this context. From the earliest \"actuality\" films to the recent phenomenon of reality television programming, it will ask if screen images capture what is \"really\" happening in front of the camera or if conventions of representation, genre, and narrative mediate the reality of these images. More significantly, it will inquire into why such questions matter. At issue is the role that moving images on both the big and the small screen have in our understanding of the world as it is and ourselves as we experience it.\n\nCredit 3 units.

They all attract loyal audiences, stimulate \"subcultural\" sensibilities, lend themselves to \"textual poaching,\" and thus qualify as examples of \"Cult TV,\" a term that has become increasingly salient within critical studies of the medium. In this course we will explore the subject of cult television from a variety of social, cultural, and thematic perspectives, so that by the end of the semester students will have gained a deeper understanding of its historical importance as a barometer of both popular and oppositional tastes. We will examine how these and other examples of genre-based network and cable programming complicate distinctions between lowbrow and highbrow tastes while sustaining worldwide \"interpretative communities\" years after their original airdates. Students will also examine the importance of syndication, home video technologies, ancillary markets, publishing, and the Internet in the construction of fan cultures.

Throughout the semester we will focus on images of Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, Filipinos, and Vietnamese that have become most ingrained in American popular culture over the last century, from Fu Manchu and Madame Butterfly stereotypes popular during the classical studio era to more recent reconfigurations of racialized imagery in Jackie Chan and Jet Li films. We will also examine selected works by Asian American independent writer-directors-films and videos like Chan is Missing, History and Memory, and Better Luck Tomorrow that challenge the stereotypes and normative tropes of \"Orientalism\" still permeating mainstream media. Students will be asked to frame textual analyses of key films (such as The Cheat, Daughter of Shanghai, Battle Hymn, Flower Drum Song, and Enter the Dragon) within various political, social, cultural, and industrial contexts (e.g. anti-Asiatic immigration and labor policies; U.S. foreign policies; the practice of \"yellowface;\" censorship codes; wars in East and Southeast Asia; anti-miscegenation laws; grassroots campaigns to stem the tide of stereotypes and hate-crimes; etc.).\n\nCredit 3 units.

In this course, we will explore the evolution of James Bond from Ian Fleming to the \"spy\" parodies in international cinema. We will read several of Fleming's novels and short stories, including Casino Royale (1953), \"Octopussy\" (1966) and \"The Property of a Lady\" (1967), and discuss these texts in light of post-war spy literature. We will screen numerous Bond films, and compare and contrast James Bond the literary and cinematic character, how Bond emerged as a franchise hero through the vision of producers Harry Saltzman and Albert \"Cubby\" Broccoli, and critical aspects of the film franchise, including its storytelling roots in Hollywood serials, its use of gadgets and special effects, and the role of stardom in their marketing (Sean Connery, Ursula Andress, Roger Moore, Madonna, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig). Finally, we will explore the re-envisioning of Bond in various media and art forms in global popular culture, including music, DC and Marvel Comics, games, children's television and in Asian cinema (Stephen Chow's 1994 From Beijing with Love).

Japanese animation is one of the earliest and most successful examples of this powerful strategy. This course examines the global franchising industry of Japanese anime to explore basic questions about media and popular culture: How do we define a medium? How do consumer practices shape media and popular culture? What is the impact of globalization on media, and global media on national culture? Our investigations of Japan \"cool\" and its avid consumer cultures will cover: animation aesthetics and technology; media convergence; anime fan cultures; science-fiction and remaking the body, history, and identity through global media.

Why are audiences attracted to a genre that causes fear, revulsion, and distress? This course will consider the cultural, philosophical, and generic dimensions of horror and explore how it operates across an array of media platforms: film, literature, television, comics, and video games. We will read two literary masters of the genre, H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King, and we will screen some of the most successful horror films of the last 50 years. We will also study horror through a variety of critical frameworks, including gender, stardom, special effects, transnationality, adaptation, transmedia storytelling, and interactivity. The course will culminate in two extended case studies. In the first, we will compare and contrast literary, filmic, and televisual adaptations of \"The Shining.\" In the second, we will consider \"The Walking Dead\" as a franchise that spreads its narrative across comics, multiple television programs, and video games.

This course will look at the development of youth culture in the United States and its unique relationship to visual media, including film, television, comic books, video games, and the Internet, in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. We will examine youth culture as a social phenomenon generated by the young, a means of representing the experience of being youthful, and as part of the ongoing debates over the effects of media on the young. As alternately mass culture, popular culture, counter culture, and participatory culture, youth culture holds a privileged place in the history of American visual media and continues to influence production and innovation within the media marketplace.\n\nCredit 3 units.

No previous technical experience is required, but students should have taken or be concurrently enrolled in Film 220. This course teaches students how films are put together to tell stories, negotiating between the possibilities of cinematic language and the practicalities of working with machines and other people. In order to develop an understanding of filmic narration, students will learn the basics of camera operation, lighting, digital video editing, sound design and recording, casting and directing actors, visual composition and art direction, and production planning and organization. These concepts will be put into practice through a series of exercises culminating in a creative, narrative short digital video.

Film and literature have been interconnected since the very first films screened at end of the nineteenth century, but the dynamic between literature and media has sometimes been strained: film reviled as the cheap degradation of a vital art form, the novel anxious at the rise of narrative film - and later television - as rival storytelling media. But, viewing literature and visual media in opposition can obscure what becomes visible if we view them together. This is a course about the history, theory, and practice of adaptation from literature to film and television and back again rooted in both canonical and non-canonical case studies. We will study authors whose works have been repeatedly adapted across eras and media; filmmakers whose works are pastiches of various literary and cinematic sources; rigorously, obsessively \"faithful\" adaptations; radically transformative \"unfaithful\" adaptations; and works of literature and media that are themselves about the process and ethics of adaptation. The course will be anchored by a reading of Emily St. John Mandel's 2014 novel Station Eleven and a serial viewing - replicating the unusual original release - of HBO Max's miniseries adaptation.\n\nSame as L14 E Lit 3164\n\nCredit 3 units.

To answer these questions, this course will survey the rich, vibrant legacy of documentary filmmaking as well as demonstrate its ongoing artistic and cultural relevance to newer media. We will examine key modes of documentary film while contextualizing the historical development of these forms within aesthetic, industrial, and political factors. We will also consider ethical issues in filmic representation, especially in relation to the ethnographic tradition.

French film director François Truffaut once declared that cinema and Britain were incompatible terms since \"the English countryside, the subdued way of life, the stolid routine-are anti-dramatic. . . [even] the weather itself is anti-cinematic.\" Yet British films proudly rank among some of the most acclaimed and beloved in film history: Monty Python and the Holy Grail, A Hard Day's Night, Lawrence of Arabia, The Third Man, Zulu, The Ladykillers, A Night to Remember, Trainspotting, The King's Speech, and the James Bond franchise. Admittedly, British cinema has had its ups and downs, never quite knowing whether to position itself as a distinctive national cinema or as a rival to Hollywood. This uncertainty has fostered a rich diversity and complexity that this course will emphasize in a survey approach. We will give equal attention to the work of high-profile directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Michael Powell and to important \"genres\" in which the British seem to excel--like black comedy, imperialist adventure, \"kitchen sink\" drama, documentary, and the so-called \"heritage\" films that paved the way for television's Downton Abbey.

It will pay special attention to the period of auteur-centered filmmaking in the 1970s. During this time, the end of the production code, the financial crisis of the industry, the unparalleled influence of European New Wave and Art films, and the introduction of the first generation of film school graduates (the so-called \"movie brats\") all combined amidst the tumultuous cultural politics of such movements as the counterculture, civil rights, and second wave feminism to form a film-historical moment often called the Hollywood Renaissance. This brief period was soon followed by a newly reinvigorated Hollywood industry focused on the high-concept blockbuster. Such rapid transformations in the practice and nature of American film not only continue to influence commercial filmmaking today but also continue to shape our understanding of the role of authorship, genre, and ideology within Hollywood.

As in, for instance, Australia and New Zealand, growth had previously been blocked by the dominance of local screens by films from, on the one hand, the overbearing 'imperial' power, Britain, and, on the other, Hollywood, center of an even stronger cultural imperialism. Increased national self-assertion coincided with the weakening of the grip of those two cinemas in the post-classical period. A major focus of the class is on some of the key works of the film-makers who established themselves in the 1980s, notably Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan. But, as the title indicates - not simply Irish Cinema - it deals with more than this. Like Ireland itself, Irish cinema is deeply marked by, and preoccupied with, the political and cultural struggles of the past, and recent cinema is illuminated by seeing it in the context of earlier films: Hollywood and British versions of Ireland, whether shot on location or in the studio, as well as the isolated earlier landmarks of an indigenous Irish cinema. We also look at the rich topic of the representation of Irish immigrants in Hollywood films. Required Screenings.\n\nCredit 3 units.

But early game-console hardware was designed with very particular ideas of what made a game a game, and under extreme constraints of cost and technical viability. Creators designed for these constraints, and their work then influenced the design of later hardware and software. This is a course about the history, design, and technology of one retro game console, the 1977 Atari Video Computer System (also known as the Atari VCS or the Atari 2600). The first popular home console, the Atari VCS is a truly weird computer: It \"boasts\" 128 bytes of RAM, no video buffer, and a custom graphics and sound chip designed to interface with then-universal cathode ray tube televisions. Against all odds, creators made fun and successful games within these extreme constraints. Just as an artist benefits from learning the fundamentals of their craft, so a game designer or developer can benefit from returning to these early and crude hardware platforms. In this course, students will learn the technical and creative history of the Atari, and they will also learn the fundamentals of programming its unfamiliar hardware. Students will carry out programming exercises, mostly in the assembly language instructions required to operate this unusual computer. They will then make their own games for the Atari, which will be able to run on the actual, 45-year-old hardware.\n\nCredit 3 units.

We will begin by charting the history of video games through corporate case studies that reflect industrial turning points. Next, we will review frameworks by which to understand the industry both historically and contemporarily. The final part of the course will be spent breaking down processes involved in the creation, distribution, and consumption of video games. Our analysis of the global video game industry will be based on game studies scholarship, trade press reports, and historical material. Lab meetings will provide the opportunity for engagement with documentaries, gameplay demonstrations, and guest speakers. By the end of the course, you will have gained a better sense of how to both study and participate in the increasingly global video game industry. Weekly requred screening/lab: Tuesdays @ 7pm.

Beginning with the initially dominant film producing nations of Western Europe, this course will consider the development of various national cinemas in Europe, Asia, and third world countries. The course will seek to develop an understanding of each individual film both as an expression of a national culture as well as a possible response to international movements in other art forms. Throughout, the course will consider how various national cinemas sought ways of dealing with the pervasiveness of Hollywood films, developing their own distinctive styles, which could in turn influence American cinema itself.

Recent changes in the dynamic of international economics and cultural flow have led to new critical approaches that reassess international cinema as being constructed by relationships that transcend national borders. This course examines multiple ways in which cinema works \"transnationally\", focusing on recent theories of modernism, globalization, and borderless cultures. Exploring a range of contexts from American domination of the early international market, to the recent evolution of Chinese blockbuster action films, to contemporary Palestinian video art, this course looks at the way in which material developments, narrative and aesthetic conventions, and film professionals have circulated over the past century. We will also look at how new technologies of production, distribution, and exhibition challenge traditional notions of cultural borders. Required screenings and in-class textual analysis will be used to complement industrial studies of how transnational flows have come to define contemporary audio-visual media practices.

How does the industry speak to them, with what aims, and using what types of representational strategies and modes of address? In turn, how do young people respond, both as viewers and, with the advent and increasing accessibility of new technologies, as media producers? This seminar will address these and other related questions while introducing students to the study of children's television in cultural and critical media studies.

In this course, we will explore the sexual politics of film noir as a distinctive vision of American sexual relations every bit as identifiable as the form's stylized lighting and circuitous storytelling. We will explore how and why sexual paranoia and perversion seem to animate this genre and why these movies continue to influence \"neo-noir\" filmmaking into the 21st century, even as film noir's representation of gender and sexuality is inseparable from its literary antecedents, most notably, the so-called \"hard-boiled\" school of writing. We will read examples from this literature by Dashiell Hammett, James Cain, Raymond Chandler and Cornell Woolrich, and discuss these novels and short stories in the context of other artistic and cultural influences on gendered power relations and film noir. We will also explore the relationship of these films to censorship and to changing post-World War II cultural values. Films to be screened in complete prints or in excerpts will likely include many of the following: The Maltese Falcon, Double Indemnity, Murder My Sweet, Phantom Lady, Strangers on a Train, The Big Sleep, The Killers, Mildred Pierce, The High Wall, Sudden Fear, The Big Combo, Laura, The Glass Key, The Big Heat, Kiss Me Deadly, The Crimson Kimono, Touch of Evil, Alphaville, Chinatown, Taxi Driver, Devil in a Blue Dress, The Bad Lieutenant, and Memento.

How did the medium come to define itself and American identities in the post-WWII era? In an era where various social movements began to lay claim to the cultural center, why did \"mad men\" eventually give way to magical women and fantastic families? This course examines the cultural, industrial, and aesthetic changes in U.S. television broadcasting during a time that was crucial to defining its relationship to the public as well as to Hollywood, the government, critics, and American commerce.

Writers will create a screenplay story, present an outline for class discussion and analysis, then craft Act One. Writers will be encouraged to consult with the instructor at various stages: concept, outline, character and scene development, and dialogue execution. While the students fashion their screenwriting independently, the class will also explore the general elements of THEME, GENRE, and VOICE. A more specific examination of mechanics, the nuts and bolts of story construction, plotting, pacing, etc. will follow to support the ongoing writing process. In-class exercises will aid the writer in sharpening skills and discovering new approaches to form and content. Writers' work will be shared and discussed regularly in class.

Once the \"pitch\" is accepted, the student will then complete a \"beat sheet,\" and ultimately a spec script that can run from 62 to 75 pages. Two drafts of the script will be required. During the course of this process, students will also learn how to research their narrative premises by contacting legal, medical, and law enforcement experts in order to guarantee the accuracy of their scripts. In addition to learning the actual writing process, students will be expected to watch several television shows and to read books, scripts, and industry trade papers as they pertain to the craft and business of television writing. Finally, students will also meet agents, producers, directors, and other television industry professionals in order to gain their insights into the script writing process and to gain a more global view of the steps involved in bringing their ideas to the screen.\n\nCredit 3 units.

What are the differences among being a viewer, an audience member, and a fan? How can we make scholarly sense of cultural practices such as learning to speak Klingon or building a repli-car of the General Lee? Studies of fandom have attempted to answer such questions and continue to explore issues that are crucial to understanding contemporary television culture. The phenomenon of \"Cult TV\" offers fertile ground for examining the complex dynamics at play among fans, popular culture, the institutions of American media, and individual programs. In its exploration of cult television and fans, this course will engage with key issues in contemporary media such as the proliferation of new media technologies and the repurposing of existing media forms, the permeable boundaries between high and low or mass and oppositional culture, and the fragmentation and concentration of media markets. The class will combine close textual analysis with studies of fan practices to examine a variety of television programs, from canonical cult texts such as Star Trek and Doctor Who to \"quality\" fan favorites such as Designing Women and Cagney & Lacey to contemporary cult/quality hybrids such as Lost and Heroes. In mapping out this cultural territory, we will develop a set of critical perspectives on audience identities and activities and examine the continuing and conflicted imagination of fans by media producers, distributors, regulators, and critics.

This course examines these interrelated forces, particularly as they have fostered a set of programs and practices often hailed as Quality Television. The class will survey the institutional paradigms that gave rise to particular generations of programming celebrated as \"quality\" and analyze the systems of distinction and cultural value that make the label socially and industrially salient. We will critically investigate the role of audiences and the conceptions of viewer choice at play in these developments. In addition, the course will analyze the textual features that have come to signify narrative complexity and aesthetic sophistication. We will examine foundational historical examples of this phenomenon from The Mary Tyler Moore Show to Hill Street Blues and Cagney & Lacey to Northern Exposure as well as more contemporary broadcast and cable fiction such as LOST, The Wire, and Mad Men.

Centering on an elite group of prestige films--actions movies with a message for adult audiences--the course examines thirty-five years of Hollywood representations of World War II, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, and post-9/11 wars against terrorism. Close analysis of how combat film directors and composers have used music and sound in conjunction with the cinematic image will be set within a larger context of ancillary texts (source materials, soundtrack recordings, published and unpublished scripts), media folios ( press kits, reviews, editorials, newspaper and magazine stories and interviews), and scholarly writing from across the disciplines.

However, these abysmal statistics do not reflect the reality that female directors are producing some of the most innovative and exciting films of the 21st century. This course is intended to provide a general overview of the remarkable contributions of women directors to contemporary cinema (1990 to present). First, we will turn our attention to women in the commercial industry, examining topics such as female authorship, popular genres, and the gender politics of production cultures in Hollywood. Then, we will survey women directors working outside of the system in documentary, independent, and experimental filmmaking modes. Finally, we will adopt a transnational perspective to investigate the contributions of women directors to world cinema, contextualizing the films of \"women cinéastes\" from countries such as Hong Kong, Argentina, and Iran in relation to their national cinemas and international film festival networks.

Blood and gore fests. Why should we want to look at movies that aim to frighten us? What is the attraction of repulsion? Is there an aesthetics of ugliness? Except for some early prestige literary adaptations like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the horror film began as a low class genre, a notch above exploitation movies. In the 1970s-1980s, it became the dominant commercial genre by offering increasingly graphic images of violence and mayhem. The horror film had arrived: lavish budgets, big stars, and dazzling special effects in mainstream major studio films competed with low-budget, no frills productions that helped establish artistically ambitious and quirky filmmakers like George Romero and David Cronenberg. By a chronological survey of the American horror film, this course will explore how differing notions of what is terrifying reflect changing cultural values and norms. Throughout, we will consider the difficult questions raised by horror's simple aim of scaring its audience. In addition to weekly screenings, work for the course will include analytical and theoretical essays on the horror film.

Several key questions will guide the class discussion: How do war films respond to and shape the political worlds in which they are produced? How do these films confront the aftermath of war and the soldier's homecoming? Where is the line between the home front and the front line? More broadly, what does it mean to portray the violence and suffering that war inevitably brings? At the close of the semester, students will partake in an in-class symposium presenting their research on the cinematic treatment of other conflicts, from the Civil War to the \"War on Terror.\" Films include: The Boat, Saving Private Ryan, The Thin Red Line, Why We Fight, and Mrs. Miniver.

Latin American cinema in this period has gone to a period of deep crisis to the consolidation of industries and production with significant global recognition and impact. In this, cinema has strong correlations with neoliberalism, the political doctrine tied to free-market reform, democratization and privatization, among other ideas. The class will be based on the study and discussion of key films of the period to develop two themes. First, we will study the way in which cinema has become a cultural practice central to the discussion of the effects of neoliberalism in the region, as well as the opposition to neoliberalism. Topics in this regard will include: the social impact of free market reforms, growing economic and social inequality, the emergence of working class, Black and indigenous communities, the rise and fall of the New Left, the creation of new elites and other related themes. Second, we will study the way in which films are made and distributed and the changes on film production over the past decades. Topics will include the privatization of production and exhibition, the role of home video and streaming, the importance of film festivals and the move from national to translational scenes of production.

However, the phenomenon of media convergence has taken on a special salience over the last one-and-a-half-centuries, as exemplified by the growing intermixture of film, radio, television, gaming, and the internet. In particular, critics, consumers, politicians, and producers used convergence as structuring principle in understanding, regulating, and planning for the future of media culture. This course engages with contemporary worries and enthusiasms about convergence by considering the specific conditions in which the phenomenon has been understood and practiced. Tracing a historical arc though the Twentieth Century, we will first examine convergences of radio and film, film and music publishing, television and film exhibition, and disparate corporate entities as basis for understanding more recent media combinations. Building on that foundation, the majority of the course will consist of case studies of media convergence since 1980, considering it in terms of industry, technology, regulation, and audiences. These case studies will also provide students with a survey of and inquiry into questions of historiographic theory and method. Note: This course satisfies the history & historiography requirement for the FMS Graduate Certificate. Required Screenings.\n\nCredit 3 units.

Religious leaders, secular social activists, media industry professionals, and African American civil rights leaders often worked together to combat intolerance, bigotry, and inequality. What did these activists achieve in their attempts to deploy U.S. broadcast media in what they sometimes referred to as \"propaganda against prejudice\"? How did this activism relate to the institutions of broadcast media, including governmental agencies, national networks and local broadcasters? What was television and radio's impact on the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s? In addressing these questions, we will consider a wide range of media: public service programming as well as commercially produced series, specials, network news and documentaries produced between the 1940s and the 1970s. Programs considered will include A New World 'A Coming, Amos 'n Andy, American Bandstand, NBC White Papers: Sit In, Sanford and Son, Eyes on the Prize, and Soul Train, among many others.

Nevertheless, some of the most popular actors in American film have chosen the hard path by typecasting themselves in comedy, playing repeated variations on the same character. \"Comedian comedy,\" representing films that showcase the distinctive skills of great clown-actors, is the central concern of this course. We will analyze how individual comedians rework performance traditions through the distinctive concerns of their time and culture to create idiosyncratic comic personae. We will look at films starring Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers, Jack Benny, Peter Sellers, Jim Carey and Eddie Murphy.

This course provides an introduction to those iconoclastic filmmakers, who went on to break with major studios and revolutionize oppositional filmmaking in Japan. We will analyze the challenging politics and aesthetics of these confrontational films for what they tell us about Japan's modern history and cinema. The films provoke as well as entertain, providing trenchant (sometimes absurd) commentaries on postwar Japanese society and its transformations. Themes include: the legacy of WWII and Japanese imperialism; the student movement; juvenile delinquency; sexual liberation; and Tokyo subcultures. Directors include: Oshima Nagisa, Shinoda Masahiro, Terayama Shuji, Masumura Yasuzo, Suzuki Seijun, Matsumoto Toshio, and others. No knowledge of Japanese necessary. Credit 3 units.

The dominant storytelling genre of the contemporary festival circuit, the art film has since World War Two combined \"realist\" and \"modernist\" impulses. Influenced by Italian neorealism, art films grant priority to characters from working class, sexual, and other exploited and imperiled minorities. Drawing on the fine arts, literature and music, art films also experiment with modernist themes and formal principles, such as subjectivity, duration, serial structure, denotative ambiguity and reflexivity. This course explores art cinema from a variety of national contexts, analyzing storytelling techniques and themes that challenge the \"economical\" and diverting forms associated with mainstream commercial filmmaking.

Melodrama has variously been defined as a genre, a logic, an affect, and a mode, applied to diverse media, divergent cultural traditions, and different historical contexts. The course provides a survey of East Asian melodrama films-as well as films that challenge conventional definitions of melodrama-by pairing Japanese, Korean, and Chinese-language productions with key critical texts in melodrama studies. We will see classics such as Tokyo Story, Two Stage Sisters, and The Housemaid. We will examine melodrama's complex ties to modernity, tradition, and cultural transformation in East Asia; special emphasis will be placed on representations of the family, historical change, gender, and sexuality. In addition to historical background and film studies concepts, we will also consider a range of approaches for thinking about the aesthetics and politics of emotion. No prerequisites.

The 11th-century work The Tale of Genji, for example, features an elite lady's \"living ghost\" killing off her main rivals for the prince's affections. Tales of ghosts, demons, and the supernatural entities known as yokai continued to appear in collections of Buddhist didactic and folktale literature of the following centuries, finding renewed popularity in the 17th-19th centuries in the form of kaidan or \"strange tales\" which were enjoyed as printed works, parlor games, and stage plays. Some of the very first films made at the turn of the 20th century in Japan were about the popular ghosts of yore. Building on this long legacy of fearsome creatures in popular media of times now past, this course will consider selections of Japanese horror media (film, literature, anime, manga, and video games) from the mid-20th to early 21st centuries, highlighting the intertextuality that different media within the horror genre has and how the horror genre itself even bleeds into other genres. Analyzing major figures and themes in each work, this course will explore how Japanese horror -the strange realm home to ghosts with a grudge, misunderstood monsters, and merciless murderers-can function not only as thrilling entertainment but can also reflect Japanese societal and cultural anxieties present in the real world, ranging from the problems that technology may create in a changing world to the threats posed by shifts in traditional family dynamics. Although this course will focus on horror media in the Japanese context, understanding how horror can function to highlight such anxieties will prepare students to consider the deeper possibilities of horror media in their own respective cultural contexts.

The \"dispute,\" which started in the early 20th century, attracts much attention more than a hundred year later, stirring intense passions and generating controversial headlines. This course explores the Israeli-Palestinian conflict though Palestinian and Israeli cinema. We examine the ways in which cinema depicts the conflict in the Middle East, starting from the British Mandate to the present day. Adopting a relational history reading, the course examines the \"treatment,\" the influences, and the representation of major historical and political events in the region - Israeli independence/Palestinian Nakba (1948), the Six-Day War/Arab Naksa (1967), the Yum Kippur war (1973), the Lebanon War I (1982), the Palestinian uprising Intifada I (1987), the Oslo accords (1993), Intifada II (2000) - in both Israeli and Palestinian films. The course examines the social and historical processes which shape Palestinian and Israeli cinematic narratives, self-representation, the representation of the Other, the relationship to the land, diaspora, national narratives, collective memory, and trauma. This course offers a dialectical cinematic and historic journey from national films to transnational modernist and experimental films, from the collective to the individual, and from hope to despair.

Genre has been used by critics and historians to ascribe \"social functions\" to groups of programs and to diagnose cultural preoccupations, while genre has been used industrially to manage expectations among audiences, advertisers, programmers, producers, and creative professionals. Investigating genres ranging from the soap opera to the western, workplace situation comedies to sports, and game shows to cop shows, this course will explore the role of genre in the production, distribution, and reception of American television. Students will gain a critical understanding of genre theory and key arguments about the form and function of television texts and will develop a set of tools for analysis of televisual narrative and style, the social uses and meanings of genre, the institutional practices and presumptions of the American television industry, and the persistence of textual forms and audience formations in the face of structural changes such as deregulation, media convergence, and globalization.

In this course, we will examine American film melodrama as a dialectic of sentiment and sensation which draws heavily on Gothic tropes of terror, live burial, and haunted internal states. We will trace the origins of film melodrama and the cinematic Gothic to their literary antecedents, the horrors of the French Revolution, and classical and sensational stage melodramas of the nineteenth century. In addition to the 1940s Gothic woman's film cycle, we will excavate the Gothic in the maternal melodrama, the suspense thriller, film noir, domestic melodrama, the slasher film, and the supernatural horror film.

The relationship between the popular music industry (a commercial sphere oriented primarily towards the selling of sheet music and audio recordings) and audiovisual technologies (various screens and formats encountered in changing social and commercial contexts) will be explored along two complementary tracks: popular music performers as presented in performance-centered media and popular music as a narrative topic or resource in feature films. Three related analytical frames will shape our discussions: industrial and technological history (the material conditions for the making and distribution of popular music and moving images) the question of \"liveness\" in recorded audiovisual media aesthetics of various popular music styles as translated into audiovisual forms and contexts The course is in seminar format.

In the earliest movies, film directors modeled themselves on their theatrical counterparts: they chiefly focused on how to stage an action in a confined space for a stationary camera that represented an ideal member of the audience. As the camera began to be used to direct audience attention, first through cutting, then through actual movement, the film director evolved from a stager of events to a narrator. By analyzing the work of one or more major film directors, this course will explore the art of film direction. We will learn how film directors may use the camera to narrate a scene, to provide their own distinctive view of the actions playing out on the movie screen.

What is the boundary between films that challenge us and films that offend us? This is a course about films that crossed that boundary, most often by presenting images of race, sexuality and violence, images that could attract audiences as much as they offended moral guardians and courted legal sanctions. Because they were denied the First Amendment protection of free speech by a 1915 Supreme Court decision, movies more than any prior art form were repeatedly subject to various attempts at regulating content by government at federal, state, and even municipal levels. Trying to stave off government control, Hollywood instituted forms of self-regulation, first in a rigid regime of censorship and subsequently in the Ratings system still in use. Because taboo content often means commercial success, Hollywood could nonetheless produce films that pushed the envelope and occasionally crossed over into more transgressive territory. While control of content is a top-down attempt to impose moral norms and standards of behavior on a diverse audience, it also reflects changing standards of acceptable public discourse. That topics once barred from dramatic representation by the Production Code - miscegenation, homosexuality and \"lower forms of sexuality,\" abortion, drug addiction - could eventually find a place in American movies speaks to changes in the culture at large. In trying to understand these cultural changes, this course will explore films that challenged taboos, defied censorship, and caused outrage, ranging from films in the early 20th Century that brought on the first attempts to control film content through to films released under the Ratings system, which has exerted subtler forms of control.

From city symphonies to pop collages, portraiture to handcrafted animation, and ethnography to gender studies, we will explore the multifaceted and transformative avant-garde cinema through the work of its greatest practitioners, contextualize films in relation to aesthetic aspirations (e.g., formalism, opposition, reflexivity, transcendence) and movements in art and cultural theory (e.g., Dadaism, Abstract Expressionism, Pop, Performance Art, Minimalism), and acquire the digital production skills needed to make our own experimental videos.

Discussions will consider a number of key questions, including: What challenges does the Holocaust pose to cinematic representation, and how have filmmakers grappled with them? How have directors worked within and against notions of the Holocaust as unrepresentable, and how have they confronted the challenge of its association with a limited set of highly iconic images? What are the more general ethical and political dimensions of representing the Holocaust onscreen -- its victims as well as its perpetrators, the systematic genocidal violence that characterized it, and the sheer absence of so many dead? We will also probe the changing significance of cinematic representation of the Holocaust, exploring the medium's increasingly memorial function for audiences ever further removed from the historical moment of its occurrence.
