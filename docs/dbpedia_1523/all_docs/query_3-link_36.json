        "text": "1. Teresa Teng ( 1953 - 1995 )\n\nWith an HPI of 66.19 , Teresa Teng is the most famous Taiwanese Singer . Her biography has been translated into 71 different languages on wikipedia.\n\nTeng Li-chun (Chinese: 鄧麗君; pinyin: Dèng Lìjūn; 29 January 1953 – 8 May 1995), commonly known as Teresa Teng, was a Taiwanese singer, actress, musician and philanthropist. Referred to by some as the \"Eternal Queen of Asian Pop\", she is considered one of the most successful and influential Asian popular singers of all time. Teng is recognized as a cultural icon for her contributions to Chinese pop, giving birth to the phrase, \"Wherever there are Chinese-speaking people, there is the music of Teresa Teng.\" A polyglot, her crystalline voice and emotionally resonant songs, have transcended geographical, linguistic, and political boundaries, captivating audiences across Asia for several decades. With a career spanning almost 30 years, Teng established herself as a dominant and influential force in Asia throughout most of her career, including East Asia, Southeast Asia, and, to some extent, South Asia. Teng is credited as the Far East's first pop superstar and by some as the pioneer of modern Chinese pop music—a major force in the development of the Chinese music industry by incorporating western and eastern styles into her music, replacing the most revolutionary songs then prevalent in mainland China and laying the foundation for modern Chinese popular music. Teng was also instrumental in bridging the cultural gap across Chinese-speaking regions and was one of the first artists to connect Japan to some of East and Southeast Asia by singing Japanese pop songs, according to Nippon. In Taiwan, she was famous for entertaining the armed forces and singing patriotic songs that appealed to civilians on the island. Teng was nicknamed \"the patriotic entertainer\" and \"the soldiers' sweetheart\". Teng recorded more than 1,700 songs throughout her career, starting at age 14, not only in Mandarin, but also in Hokkien, Cantonese, Shanghainese, Japanese, Indonesian, English, and Italian. To date, Teng's songs have been covered by hundreds of artists worldwide. According to IFPI statistics, Teng has sold over 48 million albums, excluding sales in mainland China. In 1986, Time named her one of the seven greatest female singers in the world. In 2009, in a poll by a Chinese government web portal to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, Teng was selected as the \"most influential cultural figure in China since 1949\" by 8.5 million netizens. On the eve of the \"March 8th International Women's Day\" in 2010, she was named \"the most influential woman in modern China\" in a poll conducted by many well-known Chinese media. In 2022, Teng received a street name in Ivry-sur-Seine, Grand Paris, from the Municipal council of France. She was inducted into the \"Popular Music Hall of Fame\" at the Koga Masao Music Museum in Japan in 2007, making Teng the only non-Japanese national to do so.\n\n4 . A-Mei (b. 1972 )\n\nWith an HPI of 42.51 , A-Mei is the 4th most famous Taiwanese Singer . Her biography has been translated into 22 different languages.\n\nKulilay Amit, Han Chinese name Chang Hui-mei (Chinese: 張惠妹; pinyin: Zhāng Huìmèi), better known by her stage name A-Mei (阿妹, born 9 August 1972), is a Taiwanese singer and record producer of Puyuma descent. Born as Amit Kulilay in the rugged mountains of eastern Taiwan, she made her debut in 1996. A leading figure of the Mandopop music scene since the mid-1990s, A-Mei is widely known for breaking ground for Taiwanese indigenous peoples and being a voice for LGBT rights and gender equality. She has been given the moniker \"Queen of Mandopop\" and the \"Pride of Taiwan.\" Her career longevity, resilience, artistry, and versatility have established her as a pop culture icon in the Sinophone world. Born and raised in Beinan, Taitung, Taiwan, A-Mei moved to Taipei at age 20 in 1992. In 1996, she released her debut studio album, Sisters, which saw major commercial success and sold over a million copies in Taiwan. Her sophomore record, Bad Boy (1997), found even greater success, eventually becoming the country's best-selling album overall. Her follow up releases—Holding Hands (1998), Can I Hug You, Lover? (1999) and Regardless (2000)—received critical and commercial acclaim, with the first two albums also selling well over a million copies. A cross-straits controversy caused her to experience a decline in sales in 2004; she would later experience a resurgence in 2006 with her album I Want Happiness?. Her albums Truth (2001), Amit (2009), and Faces of Paranoia (2014) each won her a Golden Melody Award for Best Mandarin Female Singer, making her one of the singers who won the category the most times. Having sold over 50 million records, A-Mei is the best selling female artist in Taiwanese music history. She is recognized as having the influence and cultural impact in Greater China equivalent to artists such as Madonna in Western music and popular culture. In 2017, she was included in the \"Charity Heroes List\" by the Asian edition of Forbes, and her influence is even greater than that of many famous Taiwanese political and business figures.\n\n7 . Elva Hsiao (b. 1979 )\n\nWith an HPI of 37.54 , Elva Hsiao is the 7th most famous Taiwanese Singer . Her biography has been translated into 19 different languages.\n\nElva Hsiao (traditional Chinese: 蕭亞軒; simplified Chinese: 萧亚轩; pinyin: Xiāo Yǎxuān, born 24 August 1979) is a Taiwanese singer. Since being signed to a record deal in 1998 after competing in a singing competition, Hsiao had gone on to release fourteen studio albums and has achieved great commercial success within the Chinese pop music industry. Known for her R&B-influenced ballads, the artist's first album, Elva First Album (1999), was considered one of the first to incorporate R&B in the Chinese market. Her most recent album, Naked Truth, was released in 2020. Hsiao was recognized as one of four of the most popular female singers in the Chinese music scene among her contemporaries. As a result, she has also been brand ambassadors to various brand names such as, Motorola, Sprite, De Beers, Avon, Pantene, and Ford. Hsiao was named one of Taiwan's top earning singers in 2014, with more than US$18 million earned.\n\n10 . Angela Zhang (b. 1982 )\n\nWith an HPI of 35.57 , Angela Zhang is the 10th most famous Taiwanese Singer . Her biography has been translated into 15 different languages.\n\nAngela Zhang (traditional Chinese: 張韶涵; simplified Chinese: 张韶涵; pinyin: Zhāng Shàohán; born 19 January 1982), also known as Angela Chang, is a Taiwanese singer and actress. Zhang has released ten studio albums as of 2020. She debuted and rose to fame with the Taiwanese television dramas My MVP Valentine (2002) and At Dolphin Bay (2003), although since 2004, when her debut album Over the Rainbow met with instant success, she has focused on her singing career. Aurora (2004) and Pandora (2006) sold millions in Asia, while another TV series that she starred in, Romantic Princess (2007), also became an international hit. In 2008–09, she withdrew from the public eye for nearly a year and a half when her mother accused her of being unfilial and unsupportive. Zhang, in turn, claimed that her mother had squandered more than NT$100 million of her income. The media's relentless coverage of her family problems, exacerbated by Zhang's falling-out with her employer Linfair Records, accusing her of not doing enough to protect her which significantly derailed her career for many years. Zhang later returned after a few year hiatus when she competed in Hunan's reality singing competition Singer 2018, the seventh season of I Am a Singer where she served as a host and contestant. Having moved her career to mainland China, her 2019 album ?, under a new label, was the 56th best-selling album in China in 2019. Zhang's maternal grandfather was an ethnic Uyghur, with the rest of her family Hakka. She grew up in Taiwan and Canada."
