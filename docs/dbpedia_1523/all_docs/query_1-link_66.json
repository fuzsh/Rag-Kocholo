        "text": "I first started watching dramas back when I was 8 years old because ‚ÄúMeteor Garden‚Äù was such a phenomenon. Up to now, I only know one person who never got into the hype and we all still jokingly judge her because of it haha! I watched K-dramas in the same local channel that aired Meteor Garden years after. My love for Asian dramas eventually died and I went on to watch Western shows and I never imagined myself re-entering Dramaland. Not until the local channel that decided to air ‚ÄúMeteor Garden‚Äù two years ago and voila! This is already my third year of watching dramas. Good times, good times.\n\nWhen I wrote my 2015 Year-End Drama Round-Up (part 1 & part 2), some dramas that I‚Äôve watched already were being recommended. It was then that I realized that I never wrote about it here that‚Äôs why they were probably suggesting it. With that, I wrote about the dramas that I watched in my first year of fully getting into this wonderful world called dramaland. A lot of the dramas mentioned are very special in my heart and if only I could have all the time and willpower to write individual reviews on them, I would but the mini-reviews that you will be reading should suffice for now.\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nOMG HELLO DRAMA BLOGGING WORLD!!! Drama and/or blogging hiatuses or maybe taking breaks in general from the usual habits can make people go crazy. I should know because it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm currently experiencing. Yes, I‚Äôm back but only because if I don‚Äôt blog about this, I might just explode haha! Kidding aside, I just want to reiterate my reason for staying in the Taiwanese/Chinese drama fandom: never-ending fan service!\n\nMy ultimate favorite Taiwanese drama, ‚ÄúAutumn‚Äôs Concerto‚Äù just recently had a cast reunion! All this time I thought I was in a dream until my friend pointed out that they weren‚Äôt throwback photos, but they actually reunited after 3 years (they reunited back in 2013). Hope you can join me in this fangirling madness *squeals*. WARNING: photo spamming and lots of fangirling ahead!\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nI‚Äôve been looking forward to writing this ever since I got the idea in my head. In this post, I‚Äôll be writing brief reviews about all the dramas that I watched this year. So this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the dramas were all made in 2015 as the title of this post may have suggested. This is part 1 out of 2 2015 Drama Round-ups that I‚Äôll be writing.\n\nMy year in dramas is pretty colorful which I need to highlight: 1.) I watched a lot of C-dramas more than I intended to 2.) It was my first time to watch a drama while it‚Äôs currently airing 3.) I went beyond my habit of watching C/TW dramas by watching J-dramas (yay!) 4.) It also concerns going beyond my habit: watched a period/wuxia drama for the first time! 5.) I was able to watch some dramas which have been collecting dust in my never-ending plan-to-watch list already haha! and most importantly, 6.) I started blogging about dramas!\n\nI‚Äôll be dividing it into parts: STORY IN A NUTSHELL (without spoilers, I promise!), POSITIVE (+) & NEGATIVE (-) things about it, and my OVERALL RATING.\n\nSo are we ready? üòÄ\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí\n\nThis is another special edition of my usual Weibo Updates/Round-Ups. It‚Äôs been a pretty busy week but it won‚Äôt stop me from writing about China‚Äôs biggest wedding of the year! How can I resist posting about this when both the groom and bride are just beyond perfect as themselves and for each other? üòÄ\n\nIn this post, I have compiled various Weibo posts from celebrity well-wishers (some went, some couldn‚Äôt) of this perfect couple who got married last October 8 in Shanghai in front of approximately 2,000 people! Read more to be in the know üòÄ\n\nContinue reading ‚Üí"
