        "text": "Abstract From a disposition theory perspective, successful dramas are driven by the development of strong dispositions towards characters. Thus, disposition theory logic is used to predict the enjoyment of American viewers when watching two different Korean dramas ( Personal Preference and Secret Garden ). The influence of sex, affective dispositions, empathy, open-mindedness, and past exposure to Korean culture on audience enjoyment is measured. The findings support the basic premise of disposition theory that the development of strong dispositions towards characters is needed in order to develop emotional responses necessary for successful dramas. Disposition theory can be used to explain viewing dispositions in order to predict enjoyment cross-culturally.\n\nKorean TV dramas debuted on the airwaves of the United States in 1975, exclusively for overseas Korean communities in an entry-port city, Los Angeles. They then began circulating through two Korean diasporic media outlets: Korean-language TV stations and video rental stores. The latter were in Koreatowns in major metropolitan cities, such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington, DC, and Atlanta. This well-maintained, two-channel system has, however, considerably frayed in the new millennium as U.S. consumption patterns of Korean dramas expeditiously migrate toward video-streaming websites like YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix, and online-based fan communities whose ethnic identity is not necessarily Korean. Since the early 2000s, myriad illegal web services and social media networks have provided, shared, and disseminated Korean TV dramas, along with K-pop, to the mainstream users/viewers in the United States, eventually resulting in the first legitimate video-streaming service DramaFever.com. The aim of this chapter is to historicize and analyze the distribution, circulation, and reception of Korean TV dramas in the United States, from diasporic TV, exclusively for Korean immigrants, to the mainstream media market, in the age of social media.\n\nNumerous Korean cultural products (K-Pop), comprising of television dramas,movies, and songs, gained wide fame from the East to the Southeast Asian region at the end of the 1990s. Furthermore, the Asian economic crisis in the1990s has been affecting the behaviour of Asian buyers particularly regardingtheir selection of Korean cultural products including Korean drama series. In Indonesia, Korean drama series gained a promising reception from countless generations of fans. This snowballing number of Korean dramas flourished on various television stations in Indonesia. This study is constructed on the reception analysis’s framework, specifically portraying audience as an active media text interpreter. This analysis explains a broader conception of what audiences might act with texts, in order to allow the ritual uses of communications among the transmission of media contents from producers to audiences. This study applied qualitative approach through textual analysis and focused group discussion. The findings discovered that social values of materialism, patriarch, and class differences existed in the series, for instance, Princess Hours and Secret Garden. The leading male characters are portrayed as proud and selfish, resembling the typical characteristics of the soap opera genre Most Korean dramas will finish in a constructive way, where the protagonists eventually change and adapt positive values. Respondents who were involved in this research watched Princess Hours and Secret Garden for the diversified ways of connecting to audiences’ emotions by portraying attractive protagonists, compelling theme songs, and dramatic storylines.\n\nTV drama series in Korea have become the favorite media genre and consequently, Malaysian viewers are inclined towards Korean dramas rather than other Asian ones. The purpose of this study is to explore the strategies employed by Korean media broadcasters in promoting Korean television dramas in Malaysia. This research uses qualitative methods to address the Korean drama phenomenon. Four respondents from selected Korean Broadcasters namely, from Seoul Broadcasting System (SBS) and the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) were identified to participate in the in-depth interviews. The findings are significant in explaining the global success of Korean dramas. The results will also be able to help the Malaysian government in determining the future Malaysian media working plan."
