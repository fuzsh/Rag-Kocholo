The true identity of the creature impersonating her is also expected to be revealed, likely the monster within the tree that Katana was seen reporting to in Episode 1.\n\nThe castle fire is likely due to the chaos caused by Fione revealing the fake Aldora’s identity. Fione may struggle to respond appropriately in Suicide Squad Isekai Episode 9, possibly leading to her imprisonment and Cecil initiating a revolt to free her. On the other hand, it is also possible that Katana and Enchantress have arrived at the “Queen’s” behest\n\nSuicide Squad Isekai Episode 8 recap\n\nSuicide Squad Isekai Episode 8 begins as the Empire's noble council debates the squad's actions. Some see them as heroes, while others view them as troublesome criminals. When a heated argument breaks out, Queen Aldora intervenes, assigning a task to Theodore, one of the nobles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfterward, the squad arrives at the castle anticipating a feast, but they are met with stern looks and Queen Aldora's glare. Theodore accuses them of causing problems by cleaning up otherworlds messes, mocking Nanaue, and claiming they always resort to violence. Harley retorts, comparing the Empire to cops who bully criminals.\n\nHer comment angers Theodore, who then slaps her. The act enrages Clayface, Deadshot, and Peacemaker, and before Rick can stop him, Nanaue eats Theodore in Suicide Squad Isekai Episode 8. Queen Aldora smiles as Cecil attempts to attack but is thwarted by Nanaue.\n\nDeadshot and Peacemaker draw their guns, and Queen Aldora uses magic to restrain Nanaue, ordering the squad's execution. Cecil and Princess Fione object, resulting in the Queen relenting to their request, only having Nanaue executed while the rest are exiled.\n\nThe squad then gets drunk at a bar, causing a ruckus when a minstrel sings about their deeds. Hungover the next day, they return to the gate in Suicide Squad Isekai Episode 8 to reset their timers and attempt to rescue Nanaue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRick Flag reports the situation to Amanda Waller, who deems the mission a failure and activates Clayface's bomb. When noticing that the castle is on fire, Rick buys the squad 24 hours to complete their mission.\n\nAs they ready to leave, they are surprised to find Clayface alive, who survived by moving his vital organs. The squad hurries back to the Empire, noticing the castle on fire. Suicide Squad Isekai Episode 8 ends with a flashback that reveals Princess Fione finding her mother, “Aldora,” in a chaotic state and noticing a monster-like entity in the mirror.\n\nKeep an eye on Pinkvilla for more updates on the Suicide Squad Isekai anime.\n\n*The release dates and times provided are accurate at the time of writing and are subject to change at the discretion of the creators."
