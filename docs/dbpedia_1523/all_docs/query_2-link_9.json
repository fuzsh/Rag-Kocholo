        "text": "Hi guys, I know I've already made two recommendation thread, but I'm kind of going to be off the Internet soon, and for a while too. So, I'm kind of trying to collect as many as dramas as I can. So, please help me out ^_^\n\nAnyway, I'm currently watching Marry Me Or Not, and I'm really liking it so far.\n\nWhat I'm looking for is a drama with a light-hearted tone, not much seriousness. Not looking for very meaningful, 'message-sending' drama (Not that I won't watch it if the messages aren't shown very emotionally) I'm probably not making any sense :p Just recommend me a fun drama.\n\nThese are the ones that I've already watched-\n\nBromance (Loved It)\n\nFated To Love You\n\nDevil Beside You\n\nJust You\n\nAutumn's Concerto (PTW)\n\nSomeone Like You (PTW)\n\nBack To 1989\n\nI've tried to search TW dramas but everything has mixed reviews. I'm not exaggerating, almost all of them have ratings b/w 7.5-8.0 and if they have positive comments then they also have equally negative comments, so I can't decide :(\n\nThank you!\n\nPS I know people will probably recommend It Started With A Kiss, but I already watched the anime (which I loved) and when I tried to watch the J-drama it almost felt like rewatching, and I'm not much of a rewatcher. Same goes for Meteor Garden.\n\nJust help me out this once more guys"
