        "text": "10 Module 9: Popular Culture in East Asia\n\nPop singers like Rain (Jung Ji-hoon) and BoA (Kwon Bo-ah; BoA is short for “Beat of Angel”) set the standard for countless new artists whose works play on a whole range of electronic mediums. Influenced strongly by pop music trends in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and more recently Japan (with its J-pop phenomena) K-pop matured by the late 1990s, in some quarters strongly under the influence of American hip-hop and Black performance artistry. Many South Korean artists flit back and forth across the Pacific between Seoul and Los Angeles, the latter city being home to the largest population of ethnic Koreans in the US. Hip-hop with a Korean attitude is performed by all boy, all girl and mixed gender groups of singers and dancers.\n\nIn the spring of 2006, Rain performed in Madison Square Garden with JY Park (a Korean pop singer who aided Rain early in his career) and American hip-pop stars such as P. Diddy. Rain has also worked with Christina Aguilera (who, incidentally, spent part of her youth in Japan). Besides music, Rain has also starred in a successful TV soap opera (called Full House) about a strong-willed pop singer who stages a sham marriage with a young Korean woman he meets by accident on a trip to China. In acknowledgment of his popularity, a top American news magazine in the early 21st century stated that Rain was the second most influential performer in the world.\n\nBoA, with over twenty years in the industry, was discovered at age eleven while attending an audition for her older brother. Media moguls spotted her talent and, following the model of “idol” creation perfected in Japan, she was subsequently trained and packaged to become a pop singer and dancer for the target markets of Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. A polyglot, BoA speaks not only Korean, but Japanese, English, and reportedly, Chinese with an eye on the growing Chinese market that for the moment is enamored with the style and “cool” of all things Korean. As of 2006, she had released 9 albums (several in Japan)’ and was still landing solid contracts in 2020.\n\nPsy became a global legend with the release of the catchy and irreverent “Gangnam Style,” gently mocking the lives of the nouveau riche in the trendy Gangnam district of Seoul. Versions of the dance mutated endlessly worldwide. In 2012, the song became the first music video to reach 1 billion on YouTube. As of 2023, it has over 4.8 billion views, though it is now only the 11th most-watched video of all time. (Wikipedia)\n\nSince their debut album was released in 2016, K-pop girl group Blackpink has become one of the most popular girl groups in the world, with record-breaking numbers of subscribers on YouTube and an enormous social media following worldwide. The group has been listed on both the U.S. and UK billboard charts and garnered awards around the world. In the past few years, they have collaborated with artists like Selena Gomez, Dua Lipa and Lady Gaga. Blackpink’s members, including two South Koreans, a Korean New Zealander and a Thai, also reflects the pan-Asian/international nature of K-pop, and its increasingly global reach.\n\nOver the last two decades, gripping Korean soap operas become known for tear-jerking drama, sometimes earthy humor, and urbane sophistication with compellingly intricate plots on real-life themes. They also combine emotionally-resonant music and visually stimulating cinematography. Among the most popular have been the love story Winter Sonata (which gained near cult-status among women between 30-50 in Japan), the humorous urban white collar drama All About Eve, appealing to 20- to 30-somethings in Korea, and My Lovely Sam Soon, following the misadventures of a somewhat plain, twenty-nine-year-old unmarried woman in a contemporary urban setting.\n\nA true phenomenon is the 45-episode historical drama Jewel in the Palace (Dae Jang Geum, literally, “The Great Jang-geum”) which in 2003-2004 drew a massive following all over East Asia and has been shown on cable in the US. Set in the 18th century, it is the story of a young woman, Jang Geum (played by Lee Young-ae) whose mother was driven from her position as head of the king’s kitchen by the evil plotting of jealous palace ladies. Her mother succumbs to the hardships of the road and Jang Geum later makes her way to Jeju Island, where she trains as a traditional doctor. She then passes the medical exams and is assigned in the King’s palace. Drawing on her previous cooking knowledge, her doctor’s training, and her alliances with persons in power, she single-mindedly clears her mother’s name while managing to survive a host of plots hatched by scheming palace officials and ladies. She is at one point given the unheard-of honor of being the King’s personal physician and aids in discovering the cause of a killing epidemic. Along the way she captures the fancy of handsome, upright young official (played by Ji Jin-hee), and despite many obstacles the couple eventually marries. The drama, based on a true story adapted by Kim Yeong-hyeon, features incredibly detailed costumes and settings that include many of the traditional Korean foods described elsewhere in this course. The lead actress and actor have both become media phenomena in their own rights and the drama’s set has become a major tourist attraction. Such period serial dramas are now made and promoted elsewhere in Asia, including China, with its controversial block-buster series about the life of imperial women depicted in Story of Yanxi Palace (2018).\n\nAnother important aspect of the Korean Wave is the emergence of world class Korean directors. Korean film began in the early 20th century. The first talking picture was a traditional love story, produced in 1935, entitled Ch’unhyang-jun (The Story of Ch’unhyang). Due to periods of chaos and disruption, few films survive from the period before the Korean War (1950-1953). Korean filmmaking, however, enjoyed a renaissance and “golden age” in the later 1950s and 1960s, though the widening of TV audiences and the importation of Hollywood films affected the market for home-grown films in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nSince the late 1990s, new generations of directors have appeared, producing engaging and sometimes highly acclaimed (and sometimes controversial) films such as The Day a Pig Fell into the Well (Hong Sang-soo, 1996), The Contact (Chang Yoon-hyun, 1997), The Isle and Samaria (Kim Ki-duk, 2000 and 2004) and Oasis (Lee Chang-dong, 2002). Aside from these more serious works, in recent years, a strong popular film market has developed. Among the titles for 2006 that humorously explore issues of gender and sex in today’s South Korea, were My Scary Girl by Son Jae-gon, Desopo Naughty Girls, by E J-yong, and Lee Hae-yong and Lee Hae-joon’s Like a Virgin (Cheonhajangsa Madonna)—the latter is about a young male protagonist who dresses like a young woman, falls in love with a male Japanese teacher, and ends up on the school Korean wrestling team. In 2020 Bong Joon-ho’s biting thriller Parasite (2019) became the first non-English language film to win the United State’s Academy Award for Best Picture.\n\nEarly Chinese Pop Music and Contemporary Film\n\nMusic\n\nRock singers like Cui Jian and bands like Tang Chao (Tang Dynasty) and Heibao (Black Leopard) emerged in the mid to late 1980s, influenced by Western rock bands and the success of pop singers such as Deng Lijun (Teresa Teng) in Taiwan and others in Hong Kong that rose to fame on the karaoke craze that swept East Asia in the 1980s.\n\nThe early Mainland rock sounds appealed to a somewhat rebellious generation of urban “hooligans” (liumang) that reflected the profound and often unsettling social shifts in China between the end of the Cultural Revolution in the late 1970s and into the early 1980s, an era of greater openness and market experimentation. By the mid-1990s a phenomenon called dakou (cut CDs), in which intentionally damaged CDs (seconds, non-releases, and overstocks) were dumped on the Chinese market by Western companies and sold at a fraction of the original cost, along with pirated CDs, created a new interest in rock music. Groups sometimes made their own recordings and distribute them outside official channels. Among these trends emerged a less rebellious and diverse mix of popular, underground, and folksy bands that included Qingxing (Sober), Supermarket, New Pants, NO, Tongue, and urban folksinger Hu Mage. The mix also included successful ethnic minority bands such as Mountain Eagle (Yi rockers from Sichuan) and Red Plateau from Tibet.\n\nIn the summer of 2005, a television station in Hunan province organized a nation-wide amateur “Super Girl” singing contest, sponsored by the Mongolian Cow Yogurt Company. Millions of viewers voted by cell-phone, prompting some Western and Hong Kong reporters to see the event as an experiment in national democracy. The winner, Li Yuchun, from the Sichuan Music Academy, appeared on the cover of the international version of the popular U.S. news magazine Time.\n\nFilm\n\nForemost among the developers of contemporary mainland Chinese film since the end of the Cultural Revolution are the Fifth Generation directors Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, who were strongly influenced by Italian and American cinematography and films. Both emerged in the mid-1980s with films like Red Sorghum and Yellow Earth. The term “Fifth Generation” refers to their generational order in the history of Chinese film, which grew up in the early 20th century mainly in Shanghai and developed under the dual influences of Hollywood and Soviet propaganda films in the ensuing decades.\n\nIn the early 2000’s, a number of younger directors, who are loosely referred to as the Sixth Generation by film critics but actually have very different and individualistic film styles, were garnering increasing attention both in and outside China. A lot of their films are very edgy and bring a poignant criticism to contemporary life in China. These include Wang Xiaoshui’s Beijing Bicycle (2001) and Shanghai Dreams (2005), Jia Zhangke’s Platform (2000) and The World (2004), and Lou Ye’s Suzhou River (2000).\n\nBeginning in the late 1950s, film markets in Hong Kong and Taiwan grew. A huge number of martial arts films with stars that included the incomparable martial artist and actor Bruce Lee were produced in Hong Kong in the next decades. Acclaimed films from the 1990s and 2000s by Taiwanese filmmakers, and those working in and producing films for the wider Chinese-speaking diaspora include Eat Drink Man Woman (1994); Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) by Ang Lee, a Taiwanese director based in the US; and the influential films of Hong Kong’s Wong Kar-Wai including Chungking Express (1994), In the Mood for Love (2000), and 2046 (2004). Tsui Hark is another highly-influential Hong Kong director and is famous for his martial art and action films such as Swordsman (1990) and its sequels, Once Upon a Time in China (1991) and its sequels, Time and Tide (2000), and Seven Swords (2005).\n\nThe fight scene in the bamboo forest (left) in Taiwanese director Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) has become a classic. Actors Chow Yun-fat and Zhang Ziyi battled on stalks of bamboo. Zhang Ziyi (right) rose to international fame in this film and director Zhang Yimou’s House of Flying Daggers (2005). She has since starred in numerous films, a historical drama, and most recently a remake of the Japanese film classic, Godzilla. This photo is dated 2019.\n\nChinese actors such as Jackie Chan, Jet Lee, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Chow Yun-Fat, Maggie Cheung, Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi have become household names in many places around the globe.\n\nMountain Witch: Yokai Monsters in Japanese Pop Culture\n\nJapan has a rich tradition of various mysterious supernatural beings called “Yokai,” a word sometimes translated as “demon” or “monster” and borrowed from the Chinese yaogui centuries ago. There are hundreds of different yokai that appear in various forms, exhibit various traits (mischievous to monstrous) and reside in places ranging from the domestic to the wild, including streams, trees, mountains, and seas. Many richly illustrated accounts of the yokai survive from the Edo period and the monsters have been the subject of many paintings and illustrations. Pioneering Japanese folklorist Yanagita Kunio collected many stories about yokai told orally in the village of Tono in northern Japan, stimulating large scale collection efforts all over the country that resulted in numerous collected stories. Some of the more famous yokai include kappa, which look like a cross between a salamander and a turtle and seem to have inspired the famous Ninja Turtles of pop culture, the tsuchigumo spider woman, and an anthropomorph with birdlike features called tengu. The monstrous oni, human in form but often with bizarre hair, horns, color, and gnashing teeth suitable for eating humans, has been re-cast in many forms in contemporary films, digital games, and manga in a manner that yokai expert Prof. Michael Dylan Foster describes as “folkloresque”—a phenomena that draws on an earlier folk form, but is translated into a new context of meaning, sometimes only an essence or inspiration. Foster’s books Pandemonium and Parade and The Book of Yokai, describe many of the traditional yokai and their current incarnations in pop culture. The persistence of yokai today may be linked to how certain anxieties of modern life can be expressed and mitigated by the supernatural beings, a function that may be rooted in prior ages.\n\nYokai expert and folklorist Michael Dylan Foster, UC Davis, and his book “The Book of Yokai.”\n\nA subset of oni are the female “mountain witches” known as yamauba or yamanba. The mountain witches may appear as voluptuous younger women, or more typically as ancient hags. The creatures are know for their cannibalistic ways, though at least one had a prized “golden son” Kitaro, who figures in many stories. According to yokai expert Prof. Noriko Tsunoda Reider (a graduate of the East Asian department at Ohio State), the yamauba have been revived in contemporary pop culture, though the creatures have a long history of being represented in various media, such as traditional Noh theater. For instance, in 1999-2000, at a department store in Shibuya district, Tokyo, a number of young women arrayed themselves in extreme costumes and makeup, earning themselves the name yamanba-gyaru (“Mountain Witch Girls”). Other representations have appeared in manga, anime, films, and gaming, such as Hayao Miyazaki’s 2001 anime film Spirited Away, in which the old female bathhouse keeper Yubaba has some traits similar to mountain witches.\n\nDiscussing the social meaning of contemporary Yamauba (and yokai in genral) in popular culture, Reider notes that while the activities of the mountain witch girls are group-oriented and involve display, friendship building, and passive rebellion, the traditional yamauba, “lives independently and does not need human companionship, although she may enjoy human company now and then. The vicious yamauba who eat human flesh do not attack humans just for fun; they attack because they need something to eat or the humans have encroached on the territories” (Reider 2021:145). Thus, the meaning of the “yamauba-esque” costumes and other expressions in contemporary society form within new contexts and create new facets of mountain witch traditions."
