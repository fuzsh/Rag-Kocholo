        "text": "I’ve been doing my best to not post negative things, unless they’re related to reviews and or other content that can be more discussion based rather then just a negative post. However, at times there’s just a nagging feeling that I don’t want to write in a diary, nor do I want to try and just ‘let it go’. Given that this is my blog, and I’ve written a bit of similar subjects before, and it’s related to a Japanese drama; I figured it would be good to ‘let it out’ here. I can’t say this particular post will generate discussion, but I don’t particular care.\n\nChugakusei Nikki, 中学聖日記, literally translates to ‘Middle School Diary’ is the topic of this post. (Keep that translation in mind as we go) It’s a manga that was recently, in Winter 2018, adapted into a live action drama. The series aired on Japan’s TBS network, from October 9th to December 18th.\n\nBeing realistic, most Japanese people could have cared less about the series. Sure, the plot kicked up a bit of a stir but there has been worse aired on TV. There was a bit of debate leading up, and slightly after the first episode, and then more or less died out in the media. I even asked my fellow teachers what they thought; the majority of them either didn’t know the series or shrugged it off. It still had decent watching stats, but nothing surprising or large in Japan.\n\nFor some reason, it was really well watched in the West. What I mean by that is it got subs weekly, and consistently which is rare for a Japanese currently airing drama. I put most of this popularity on Arimura Kasumi being cast as Suenaga Hijiri, the teacher in this series. She’s a cult favorite in the West, despite her typecasting (I was a fan of her for awhile, now I’m not, a story for a different post). Nonetheless, the JDrama watching community, at least on mydramalist was obsessed. To the point where the fans annoying spammed the website’s ‘Best of Japan 2018’ poll.\n\nI will admit that at first my feelings were just annoyance. I was getting annoyed over a Poll that doesn’t particularly mean much, and is fan voted on a website for drama lovers. Of course it was going to be biased, and of course the majority of the drama watching community are only going to watch the most popular/talked about series of the year. Japanese dramas are notoriously not subbed as quickly as Korean/Chinese/Taiwanese dramas, and thus overall under-watched. Still, after my annoyance I was left with discomfort. Part of which stemmed for the drama’s description:\n\n“This is a love story between Akira Kuroiwa, a 15-year-old boy who knows nothing of love, and Hijiri Suenaga, his new 25-year-old homeroom teacher. One fated summer, Akira begins to realize he has feelings for Hijiri, but Hijiri has a long distance fiancee. The story follows the pair over the course of several years”.\n\nReading this for the nth time, and I still let out the biggest of sighs. Let me be clear; I haven’t watched this series. Again, I will never watch this drama. I’m not going on the attack on the actors, writers, etc. This isn’t a review trashing it, or trying to get more people to not watch it (it’ll probably have the opposite effect actually). I’m only going after the premise and why personally it bothers me so much.\n\nAs an assistant language teacher in Japan, originally from America, this whole story makes my stomach curl and not in a good way. There’s a lot of thoughts I have, so I’m going to try and unpack them in a coherent way. Pardon me if it ends up being jumbled or circling back a few times.\n\nLet’s unpack first, what type of relationship this actually is. I see a lot of people, like me, who have distaste for the series immediately labeling it pedophilia. It’s actually something called ephebophilia, which is the sexual attraction to mid to late range adolescents. Pedophilia is specifically for children under the age of 13. So if we’re going to rip something to shreds, I prefer using the proper terms for it.\n\nThe age gap is a nice and clear 10 years difference, a literal decade. Which, if it were a 25 and 35 year old would actually be fine in my book. For one, a 25 year-old and a 35 year-old are both adults in the eyes of the law, as well as consenting adults (by both Western and Japanese standards).\n\nA confession is that I’m not actually against age gap relationships. I’ve found that given the right context, that age gaps are just fine. Sometimes, they’re even a good thing! I base a lot of this my opinion off of two equations related to dating and age.\n\n‘The Dating Equation’ is one equation is for finding the youngest partner you “should” be interested in/’appropriate’ to date. The rule is half your age, and add seven. The second equation is a maximum age boundary, which is significantly less used but still helpful for the point of explaining my thoughts. The idea is subtract 7 from your age, then double it and that is the oldest age you should be dating.\n\nSo for Hiriji her ‘Dating Equation’ youngest person she should be dating is 19.5. Reasonable enough in my opinion, they’re considered an adult in the West and Japan. On the flip side, her maximum playing by the equation for the maximum age boundary, is 36. Which, again seems reasonable enough to me. By then they’re both adults and it’s all good.\n\nNow you’re probably wondering; why the fuck did I introduce this whole dating equation and maximum age boundary nonsense? It’s to bring up the absolute absurdity of a normal 25 year old teacher, being attracted to an adolescent boy. The woman could “reasonably” date a man between the ages of 19.5 and 36! In that whole age range, it’s all legal! They’re more likely to actually have mutual interest and ability to consent to a relationship! Why, for fuck’s sake would any normal adult woman ever be interested in a 15 year old?\n\nI’m not great a numbers or interpreting them, as I have Dyscalculia. Despite all this though, if even me the least qualified person to do math, and even with questionable morals; this. makes. sense. There is no reason for a 25 year old to show any interest, aside from concerned for well-being, in a 15 year old boy.\n\nI’m putting my foot down on this one. No 25 year old woman, on moral and somewhat logistical grounds (if you agree with the age equations) should be attracted to a 15 year old.\n\nMoving forward from the weirdness of this age gap, is the double standard in the West. The world is obsessed with student-teacher relationships. You can google ‘inappropriate student teacher relationships’ and tons of videos, news articles, etc will pop up, globally. Pull up an article of a male teacher having an inappropriate relations with a female student and the comments will restore your faith in humanity.\n\nThe commenters will absolutely destroy the male teacher, especially if found guilty in court. They will demand he be fired, registered as a sex offender, serve jail time, demand karma, etc. All hell breaks loose from both men and women that a male teacher would ever take advantage of a female student like that.\n\nPull up the the opposite, a female teacher having inappropriate relations with a male student, and you will get a much less clear image. The wider range of us, with pretty okay morals will shut this woman down. They will demand her to be fired, registered as a sex offender, serve jail time, etc… but the majority of these commentators will be women. The men will more often then not say that there isn’t a problem, that some of these men are jealous of these students. It only gets gross from there, but I think you can either google it or picture it yourself.\n\nI don’t want to pontificate, since I think the majority of you guys are pretty smart. Obviously, comment sections tend to be toxic but in my more logical moments I did come across this article that better breaks down the reserve double standard within student-teacher relationships.\n\nI want to believe that most drama watchers would be equally mad at any teacher going after any student, but it’s really hard with some of the content that was floating around. I know that something like this, if it would ever happen in Japan, would absolutely be a bomb within media. It would career destroying, beyond societal redemption and so much more for the teacher, the student, and the administration of the school. This premise is so far removed from even the thought of occurring in Japan, that there’s an almost lack of response. It simply, would never happen and if it did it would be the exact opposite (probably, again I haven’t watched) of how it ended in the drama.\n\nHowever, this is where the disconnect between the Japanese target audience and the Western audience occurs. The comments, the adoration and just honestly the comments about Hijiri and Akira…. I lost a little bit a faith with that. I did my absolute damn best to just not engage, didn’t look for it (aside for this post’s purpose), didn’t comment when I saw it, blocked people/tags/things on multiple platforms to avoid it but it still leaked on to my feed.\n\nMy last point is just my personal discomfort. That’s what this whole blog post is about; I was originally annoyed about the popularity of this series due to some poll and then I realized it went a lot deeper then that. I said earlier, I am an assistant language teacher of English in Japan. I currently work at both an elementary school, and a junior high school.\n\nThis hits a little too close to home, or to work. Obviously, me and Hiriji line up on demographic lines, with age and occupation (more or less) so there’s some commonality between us. Which normally, I would love and would endear me to a character but in this case, it obviously had the opposite affect. Jumping forward –\n\nI work with boys that Akira’s age. They’re fucken stupid. I mean that in the nicest way possible, but Jesus…. I can still bait them to participate in class with Disney princess stickers, teaching them lame English puns/jokes or promising to let them watch children’s videos from when they were in Elementary school.\n\nThese kids, and I say that specifically, still make poop jokes, watch and love Doramon, and play games like hide and seek or tag, during their lunch break. To go even further, the majority of these kids haven’t even had their first kiss, let alone (overtly) shown interest in the opposite sex. Please do not ask why I know this, I was not particularly keen on knowing either.\n\nAdditionally, since this might cause confusion with Western viewers, is that the division between Middle school, and High school in Japan is different. 15 year-old’s in Japan, are still in middle school, Tofugu does a really good job of breaking it down better then I could. How a 15 year-old boy acts in Japan, is not even close to how 15 year-old’s act in America. God just watching them sometimes makes me question my schooling in America.\n\nLastly, there was the event that set a whole chain of events, in my personal life, off. The drama was two or three weeks into airing, not in the forefront of thought especially since I wasn’t watching. I had a passing thought about one of my students along the lines of ‘He’ll be handsome when he’s older’.\n\nThat was my thought. That’s it. It’s actually a pretty normal thought, but because of that stupid drama; I fell into a period of self loathing.\n\nHow could I think that about one of my students! He is a child! I know exactly how stupid he is! Were my re-occurring thoughts for three days, as I just continued to self loathe. If I had this thought in passing, even just once; what does that say about me?\n\nIt sounds overly dramatic, and in many ways it is.I am one of those people who hyper focuses on one tiny moment in time and pick it apart until there’s nothing left. It visibly affected me and my performance at my job.\n\nI was barely interacting with my students, let alone the boys, which is pretty contradictory given my job is to talk with them as an adult and teach them English. This was just a thought I had, once, in my head and it was giving me this much pressure! I can’t even begin to try at if it was something more!\n\nI got out of it, eventually. Or actually, my students bless their fuzzy, poop-joke loving souls got me out of it. I’m blessed my kids still like me after how weird I was for three whole days. Then again, I think they just think I’m weird in general which is fair.\n\nWas my response out of my own horror, or horror based on this new item in popular culture leaking into my mind? That’s a bit dramatic to think that a single drama, that I have not watched, affected me so deeply. I know part of it was just my own ‘don’t think weird-ass thoughts’, and the other half… maybe falls on the drama. I don’t blame the drama entirely, it’s not fair to a media I have not consumed. There is something to be said that popular media does have bigger impacts then they anticipate.\n\nSo, if I freaked out that much over just a passing thought, about a future projection of them; what the fuck is going on Hiriji’s mind?\n\nI don’t know. As I said, I don’t want to know. If I can take anything from even the premise of this drama, is that some dramas hit close to home in the worst sort of way. There’s nothing wrong with taking some things into consideration, or being prodded to think thanks to popular media. In a lot of ways, that can be really good. Just, this drama isn’t one I’ll be doing that with.\n\nFinal thoughts: women lusting after underage boys is just as disgusting as men lusting after teenage girls (and if you don’t agree with this please unfollow now), people romanticizing student-teacher relationships especially via popular media is gross. If you read all this, I applaud you and thanks for reading."
