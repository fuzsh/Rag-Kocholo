They were restricted to the inner court and forbidden from venturing out of the northern section. Most women in the Forbidden City were employed as maids and servants, but there was also a select group of concubines whose task was to bear children for the emperor â as many as he could father.",

        "text": "The three favourites would receive the highest ranking for imperial concubines\n\nOnly a few of those who made it through this rigorous process would be noticed by the emperor and win his favour. Most would spend their lives in bitter loneliness, and unsurprisingly, politics and jealousy was rife among concubines. Beauty was more of a curse than a blessing in China during this period of history.\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nNaturally, concubines were strictly forbidden from having sex with anyone other than the emperor.\n\nMost of their activities were overseen and monitored by the eunuchs, who wielded great power in the palace. Concubines were required to bathe and be examined by a court doctor before the emperor visited their bed chamber.\n\nWith hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of concubines at the emperorâs disposal, any lady the emperor graced with a visit would be subject to jealous rivalries. Concubines had their own rooms and would fill their days applying make-up, sewing, practising various arts and socialising with other concubines. Many of them spent their entire lives in the palace without any contact with the emperor.\n\nHIERARCHY\n\nQing Dynasty harem system\n\nThe ranking remained consistent but the number of consorts and concubines varied under different emperors\n\nPOLYGAMY\n\nPolygamy was common practice in feudal China, although only upper- and wealthy middle-class men could afford to take several wives. It was seen as an affirmation of male potency, and the presence of many women was taken to indicate a manâs virility.\n\nThe emphasis was on procreation and the continuity of the fatherâs family name. Confucianism emphasised the ability of a man to manage a family as part of his personal growth in daxue (great learning). In the case of the emperor, guaranteeing a successor to the throne was of paramount importance.\n\n1. The strict distinction between main wife and concubines\n\nThe main wife was superior to all other wives. She was responsible for submitting to the higher principles of polygamy and to mentor the other wives in harmonious behaviour for the greater good.\n\n2. Women must not be jealous\n\nWomen, especially the main wife, had to rise above their earthly emotions. The belief that they were living for a higher purpose presumably helped displace feelings of bitterness, jealousy and rivalry.\n\n3. Attachment could radically destabilise polygamy\n\nThe husband should not have a favourite, nor should any of the wives monopolise the man. Love had to be distributed evenly among the wives, which effectively meant that passionate attachment was not acceptable.\n\n4. Polygamy could only survive by observing a strict hierarchy\n\nEach dynasty had its own set of titles and ranks for the imperial wives. The empress ranked at the top, with more wives filling successive echelons below her. Most wives occupied the lower echelons. Hierarchy was determined at specific times, such as when a new wife joined the imperial family and was assigned a rank.\n\nEMPERORâS SEXUAL ROTATION\n\nIt was believed that organising the emperorâs sex life was essential to maintaining the well-being of the entire Chinese empire. The Chinese calendars of the 10th century were not used to keep track of time but rather to keep the emperorâs sex schedule in check. The rotation of concubines sleeping with the emperor was kept to a regimented order. Secretaries were employed to record the emperorâs sex life with brushes dipped in imperial vermilion."
