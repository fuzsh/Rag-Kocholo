A master post for all Chinese dramas, including Taiwanese dramas, that I have seen up until the year 2014. Enjoy~

As per usual, 2 different ratings, first is how much I liked it without regard to quality of plot, and the second is whether I would recommend it. Both are out of 10, with 10 being the most, and 1 being the least. I know these shows are quite old, so these are based on my memory, and I would re-watch a few scenes if I don’t remember.

This list spans a little more than a decade. I started with Taiwanese Idol Dramas, then ventured into Mainland China Dramas. Dramas that I watched long time ago, I may not remember much of the story line, but I may remember some of the feelings that I had as I watched these shows… Some, I watched while it was airing, like really long ago, and others, I watched as recent as mid-2016.

2005

綠光森林 / Green Forest, My Home (6/10, 6/10)

The first ever drama that I watched on the VCR. Angst-filled, and being as young as I was, I remember being brought to tears quite easily on many occasion.

2006

王子變青蛙 / Prince turns into Frog (7/10, 7/10)

THE Taiwanese drama to watch, from long ago. Enjoyable.

Drama in a hair salon.

微笑 Pasta / Smiling Pasta (6/10, 5/10)

Lighthearted romantic comedy.

I remember nothing much of this, except that, I did watch this show…

剪刀 石頭 布 / A Game about Love (6/10, 5/10)

Interesting mysteries set in a high school.

2009

仙剑奇侠传3 / Chinese Paladin 3 / Xian Jian Qi Xia Zhuan 3 (7/10, 6/10)

Addictive story line, especially Tiffany Tang and Wallace Huo’s characters… I may have skipped university lectures to feed the addiction *squinty-eyes*

2011

夏家三千金 / The Xia Girls / My Daughter / Xia Jia San Qian Jin (6/10, 6/10)

One of my favourite Chinese drama. Mysteries in ancient time.

I enjoyed this. There was cooking, and then some makjang stuffs…

爱情闯进门 / When Love Walked In / Ai Qing Chuang Jin Men (5/10, 4/10)

A lot like Romantic Princess after thinking about it. Tried hard but was a little blah…

One of my favourite romantic comedy.

2013

It was filmed prettily, but sadly, a frustrated total waste of time.

大漠谣 / 风中奇缘 / 星月传奇 / Sound of the Desert / Ballad of the Desert / Da Mo Yao / Feng Zhong Qi Yuan (6/10, 7/10)

Based on the novel by Tong Hua. A pleasant enjoyable drama.

杉杉来了/ Boss and Me / Shan Shan Lai Le (6/10, 7/10)

Just completed in mid-2016. Lighthearted with some typical angst…

Wow. What a list.

Now, I don’t really watch Taiwanese dramas at all. Only when there is something that really captivates me…

Mainland China dramas are quite long, but they have improved their quality over the years, say story line, effects and what nots… However, once in a while, you may still meet some that is just pure nonsense…
