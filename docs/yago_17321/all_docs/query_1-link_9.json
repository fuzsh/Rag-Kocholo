        "text": "A woman murders her husbands killer, a Japanese gangster and receives life in prison. But there's a catch, if she performs hits for the government she will receive reduced time and a chance to see her son.\n\nThe opening scene of Maria (Noriko Aota) posing as a dancer in a lounge to get close to her intended hit, and then escaping from 20 odd gangsters in 2-inch heels sets the tone for the rest of the movie.\n\nIt's evident that her government training didn't include dance lessons, and she seems unable to put any of the bad guys out of action with her flailing karate kicks. They do provide her with a stunning wardrobe though. What do you wear to an assassination anyway? Vinyl is always a good choice.\n\nThe fight scenes are comic, the bad guys are caricatures, the dialog is silly; exactly what you want from a B-grade Japanese action flick.\n\nI gave it a 6, a decent rent if you can get it cheap and are a fan of this genre. Don't expect John Woo style action though -- think Power Rangers."
