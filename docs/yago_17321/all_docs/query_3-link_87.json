        "text": "It is not often you will see a movie adapted from a book of poems, but then it is not often you will see a movie like Pastoral Hide and Seek. Surrealism is a term that, like all artistic terms, gets tossed around to mean a lot of things, but this is arguably the most completely surreal movie since Andalusian Dog. Nevertheless, it does have a plot, or at least a consistent theme, a man trying to come to terms with his teenaged self, but it is expressed in a series of fragments (introduced by the director’s own poems) full of surreal imagery.\n\nOnce again, I am tempted to just fill the post with screen captures, because the visuals are so unusual and so striking. However, there is also a plot — actually two: A 15-year-old boy wants to find a way out of his village in the middle of nowhere, to escape both his possessive mother and the oppressive culture. He falls in love with the neighbor’s wife, who has actually been bought by the neighbor’s mother.\n\nShe too wants to escape. A strange “circus” appears, offering new possibilities to his mind, and when the neighbor offers to elope with him, he agrees. They are heading down the railroad tracks together when we see a bunch of film leader and realize we have been watching a half-finished movie. After a discussion with a friend, the director starts the movie over to be more truthful, but the movie does not turn realistic; the imagery remains as odd and surreal as before, just with more truthful story lines. For example, the elopement was actually an escape to meet the woman’s lover, released from a jail term for his Communist activities, and the two then commit suicide. To make it even odder, the author suddenly appears and escorts his younger self through some of the events and engages in a time-travel discussion with him while they play chess.\n\nThe past can not be escaped or altered and yet it is still a dream that may or not be recalled accurately. The boy is essentially a normal 15-year-old; the past holds no hidden crimes, no unusual traumas other than the loss of his father in the war when he was too young to have actually known his father. He wants to escape his mother, but we find out from his older self that he never manages that.\n\nCuriously, it is the boy who is least “real.” He is always seen in white face makeup so that his features are obscured. His mother looks like she applied white face as well but years ago so that it is mostly worn off. The neighbor family are perfectly normal in appearance. Even the “circus” freaks are merely strange, in the way of some of Fellini’s faces. Yet there is nothing “realistic” about what we see presented. A woman has a bastard child, but it is an obvious doll, and the local women force her to drown it. Then without warning the same woman appears in Western clothes and seduces the boy in what is as close to a rape by a female as possible to depict. The circus fat woman is actually in a rubber suit that has to be pumped up, which leads to her orgasm each time her dwarf husband pumps her up. The old women wear black, as in Innocent Witch set in the same general area, but all have eye patches. The family clock clunks constantly. The double suicide is shown by red scarves bound around feet, hands, and necks. The older version of “Me” tries to get the boy to kill his mother, but tells him she still lives with him in Tokyo so he can not succeed in the attempt.\n\nAs with all shorter poetry, its main thought can be reduced to a simple phrase, even a cliché: You can’t really understand your own past, much less change it. At the same time, like the brief verse forms common to Japanese poetry, a world of possibilities is packed into each moment. It can be watched with interest once and forgotten, or it can be rewatched with each viewing unpacking new insights, new interpretations."
