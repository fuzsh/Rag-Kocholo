Previously, Tokugawa Japan (1600–1868) was often understood as a “closed country” (sakoku), defined precisely by the absence of significant connections to the rest of the world. Now, scholars are rediscovering and re-evaluating the manifold cultural, economic and diplomatic exchanges with its neighbors and the wider world that took place throughout the early modern period. In this seminar, we will engage with recent research and translated sources that explore Japan’s place in East Asia and the world. While starting out with a general framework of early modern history, the seminar does not offer a balanced account of all aspects of Tokugawa period Japan. Instead it focuses specifically on topics that shed light on the ways in which Japan participated in, shaped, and in turn was influenced by larger spatial and cultural configurations."
