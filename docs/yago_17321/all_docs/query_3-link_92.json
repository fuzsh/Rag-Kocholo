The titles officially launch on January 14, 2009 but are available for purchase directly from Pink Eiga's site right now. S&M Hunter (depicted at left) was reviewed earlier in the year on Twitch; a review of New Tokyo Decadence is forthcoming. Needless to say, both films are offensive, weird and most importantly, very entertaining.\n\nDo you feel this content is inappropriate or infringes upon your rights?
