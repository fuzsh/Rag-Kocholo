        "text": "Happy weekend… or rather, new week.\n\nSorry, this trailer post’s a bit late because I wanted to let my review of Uzumasa Limelight have a share of the… limelight on the blog. I gave that a 4/5 because I enjoyed it a lot and it can teach viewers a thing or two about the Japanese film industry. I also posted some PR about the film’s theatrical release as part of the Japan Foundation Touring Film Programme.\n\nI watched a couple of Japanese zombie movies last week like Wild Zero (1999). I also went to the cinema to watch The Revenant and was blown away by the epic scope of the visuals, great acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, the great musical score by Ryuichi Sakamoto and the nuanced look at the Native American characters.\n\nWhat was released last weekend? Lots of stuff.\n\nAKECHI kunoichi ninpo gaiden\n\nAKECHI くノ一忍法外伝「AKECHI kunoichi ninpo gaiden」\n\nRelease Date: February 06th, 2016\n\nRunning Time: 79 mins.\n\nDirector: Hiroyuki Kawasaki\n\nWriter: Shinji Hirata (Screenplay),\n\nStarring: Noriko Fujioka, Narumi Yonezawa, Yasuko Tsuji,\n\nSynopsis: This one is an ultra low-budget movie from pink film director Hiroyuki Kawasaki.
