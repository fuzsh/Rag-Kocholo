        "text": "Tokyo Decadence has been banned in several countries such as Australia and South Korea and has gone on to become a cult classic of erotic cinema. Tokyo Decadence is available January 18, 2022 on Blu-ray (for the first time in the US) and also on DVD! In the most lavish penthouses, visible only through keyholes, …\n\nThe post New on Blu-ray and DVD: Tokyo Decadence appeared first on Horror News | Hnn.\n\nTran T. Kim-Trang is a Vietnamese-American artist who lives and works in Los Angeles. She works across multiple media, including video, new media, and installation. Major themes in her works include visual dynamics, immigration, biotechnology, and relationships to technology. She has exhibited work at the Museum of Modern Art (1999) and the Whitney Biennial. One of her most renowned works is “The Blindness Series” (1992-2006), a collection of eight short videos that explore the many resonances of blindness, from eye-lid surgery, video surveillance, to word-blindness, and brilliantly incorporate the artist’s interventions over more than a decade of sustained practice. “Kore” is one of eight in this series.\n\nKoré is streaming on Ovid.tv\n\nIn distinct experimental fashion, the film unfolds as a collage of different types of moving images, which aim to comment on sight and blindness, and the whole concept of seeing, AIDS and the issues with its treatment...\n\nFor his first live-action movie, director of “Evangelion” Hideaki Anno picked a rather difficult task, of adapting Ryu Murakami’s novel “Topaz II”, with the first book having been adapted by the author himself, with the title “Tokyo Decadence“. In his effort to transfer the surrealistically sexual premises of the book, Anno implemented an even stranger visual approach, using almost entirely handheld cameras, which resulted in a film that borders on the experimental.\n\nThe story revolves four high school girls who engage in compensate dating, meeting elderly businessmen who pay teenage girls to spend time or have sex with them. In this case, the many men the girls meet do not ask for sex, but the perversion is still present, as we watch them dating people who just want to watch them eat, or make them chew grapes and then keep the remains. Hiromi, the protagonist of the film,...\n\nRyu Murakami’s books are strange. They are violent, sensual, absurdly humorous, surrealistic, and hide their comments in an atmosphere of confusion and disorientation. The same actually applies to the movies based on his books, either those he directed himself (“Tokyo Decadence“) or those directed by others (“Audition“). “Karaoke Terror” despite being quite approachable, also includes the same elements, starting with the story.\n\nFive young men spend their time together for no apparent reason, since they seem to have no common interests apart from doing karaoke in bondage outfits twice a week, and enjoying peeking on the neighbor that lives across the apartment of one of them, which functions as their headquarters. On the opposite axis lie five middle-aged women, either single or divorced, who are all named Midori and also enjoy their karaoke. The boys frequently talk about how this kind of women are the easiest to have sex with,...\n\nIt is not so frequent for an author to become the director of his own novels, but Ryu Murakami, whose most famous work is probably Miike-directed “Audition” is not your regular artist in any way. “Tokyo Decadence” is not even the first of his novels he directs, since his filled with violence, drugs and overall extremity style was already self-adapted into cinema three times before this movie. Let us see why he is so unique though.\n\nIn a style relatively similar to De Sade’s perversion cataloguing “The 120 Days of Sodom”, the film revolves around the life of a 22-year-old timid female college student named Ai who works as a specialty prostitute for an exclusive escort agency that caters to wealthy, mostly perverted and corrupt, Japanese men in Tokyo. The biggest part of the movie highlights her line of work, as Murakami takes his time depicting her into sessions involving sodomy,...\n\nUpdate: Gozan Ija had the 350th film right: Tokyo Decadence Way back when Twitch had its own separate forum, the most-trafficked topic used to be the screenshot quiz. The rules were simple: someone would post a screenshot, for all other people to guess which film it was from. And the person who guessed the movie, won the right to post the Next screenshot, building a chain. And this went on for seven years, until well over a thousand films had been guessed. Then times changed: the forum went dead as people mostly moved film discussions over from old-style forums to social media. Two years ago we decided to relaunch a new forum, sort-of, on our Facebook page. And what was the first topic we put...\n\n[Read the whole post on twitchfilm.com...]...\n\nTiff’s Midnight Madness program turned 25 this year, and for two and half decades, the hardworking programers have gathered some of the strangest, most terrifying, wild, intriguing and downright entertaining films from around the world. From dark comedies to Japanese gore-fests and indie horror gems, the Midnight Madness program hasn’t lost its edge as one the leading showcases of genre cinema. In its 25-year history, Midnight Madness has introduced adventurous late-night moviegoers to such cult faves as Richard Linklater’s Dazed and Confused and Quentin Tarantino’s Reservoir Dogs. But what separates Midnight Madness from, say, Montreal’s three and half week long genre festival Fantasia, is that Tiff selects only ten films to make the cut. In other words, these programmers don’t mess around. Last week I decided that I would post reviews of my personal favourite films that screened in past years. And just like the Tiff programmers,...\n\n4th Toronto’s Shinsedai Cinema Festival has just announced the programme for 2012 and it a looks like Pinky violence, and sex galore, are the name of the game, as director Yu Irie’s film - ‘Ringing in Their Ears’ will have its Canadian premiere as the opening night film of the fourth annual festival on Thursday, July 12, 2012 at 7:00 p.m., at the festival’s new home, The Revue Cinema in Roncesvalles Village. ‘Ringing in Their Ears’ kicks off four days of Japan’s best new filmmaking talent for a new generation.

Not as many Halloween-themed releases this week but no matter, here’s the rundown of what’s available to buy from today, October 24th 2011.\n\nPick Of The Week\n\nMother’s Day (DVD/Blu-ray)\n\nAfter a bank robbery goes seriously wrong, three sadistic, bloodthirsty, criminal brothers find themselves on the run. Their childhood home seems like the safest place to hide out. But a few things have changed, their mother has been evicted and the house is now occupied by a young couple and their birthday guests. Taken hostage, the new owners and friends are forced to endure a night of blood-drenched hell. Because mother’s coming home to roost and her maternal instincts involve extreme torture and a taste for terror.\n\nOur good friends at Arrow have sent us details on their November release schedule, which includes the eagerly awaited (at least by me) special features-filled release of Wes Craven’s Deadly Blessing and the Robert McGinty starring classic The Exterminator!\n\nThe Exterminator Blu-ray (Arrow Video)\n\nScorching the streets clean… Flamethrowers ready as the alleyways of skid row are set ablaze with the brutal vengeance of one man… The Exterminator! John Eastland has been to ‘Nam and he’s seen things… Things you wouldn’t believe. Surviving torture and witnessing the brutal deaths of his friends, John returns home to a tough neighbourhood in New York and his loving family. But when some local thugs take a crippling dislike to his best friend Mike, leaving him paralysed, something snaps in John. Did he fight the Vietcong for this? Taking the law into his own hands, Eastland sets out to clean the streets of every low life,...\n\nIn The Tradition of “Tokyo Decadence” and “Hostel” Unmoved Movers is a sexual thriller. It starts like a sad story of human conditions which soon turns into a bad dream, and ultimately regresses into a violent nightmare. Based on real events in a small suburban town in Poland, that captured the attention and shock of a nation, Unmoved Mover tells the story of a group of seemingly ordinary people in a seemingly ordinary small community, who become involved in a secret world where individuals exchange illicit sexual favors. Teresa and her husband work in a glass factory, the only employer in town. When Teresa does not go to work one day, her boss shows up at her doorstep and calls her a whore. What we are soon to learn is that Teresa who used to be a willing participant in a swinger sex group, now finds herself enslaved by her...\n\nThe enterprising folks at Pink Eiga have released the first two titles in a series of rare English-subtitled pinku releases: Shuji Kataoka’s S&M Hunter (1986) and Osamu Sato’s New Tokyo Decadence: The Slave (2007).
