        "text": "“People are only truly happy when they’re doing what excites them.”\n\nShiro Shimomoto (“the roper” from Pink Eiga’s DVD release of S&M Hunter, and star of The Dream of Garuda) is not having a good day. Dumped on by his boss, badmouthed and exploited by his juniors, and mugged by chain wielding girl toughs…something’s got to give, and some major life changes are in store for our luckless, nameless hero.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nYou knew it had to happen eventually. No matter how you try to work around her, sooner or later, if you’re talking about this company, The Name is going to have to come up.\n\nThat’s right, we’re talking about Reiko Yamaguchi, favored star of Pink Eiga Inc. Featuring in their Japanese Wife Next Door parts 1 and 2, The Secret in the Attic and this picture (quite a high percentage for a company with under 25 releases under its belt), she supposedly tops polls conducted by the company and draws in crowds at their many festival and event appearances across the country.\n\nMainly notable for her bust size, Yamaguchi’s overflowing bosom is apparently being put to further use as mama-san for a “snack bar” (hostess club?) in the infamous Kabuki-cho district of Tokyo, where she is noted for bringing bottles of booze to clients stored between her ample cleavage. Yep, that’s the level of intellectual discussion we’re brought to here…\n\nSo let’s get to the crux of the matter, namely Akira Fukamachi’s Semen Demon. Fukumachi, also of Pink Eiga’s The Secret in the Attic, has apparently been directing pink films as long or longer than I’ve been on this planet, so this 2005 offering can truly be said to be the work of the prototypical dirty old man. Sure, he’s probably a barrel of laughs to hang around with (at least if you happen to be another guy), but to judge by the work in question, you probably wouldn’t want him within restraining order’s distance of your sister, or for that matter, mother.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“According to the report by Susan, Dr. Smith is a mad scientist.”\n\nIn what appears at first to be a late 80’s/early 90’s entry in the long running Molester Train series (3 previous entries of which were brought over here by Pink Eiga as Groper Train: Wedding Capriccio, Groper Train: Search for the Black Pearl and Sexy Time Trip Ninjas), sexy “Michelle” (Shoko Kudo) enjoys a ride on the morning bullet train where she gets felt up by an unseen fellow passenger. A scream breaks out, and she discovers a businessman in horrible underwear holding an obvious hot dog in hand (in the ridiculous language of the film, clearly meant to represent his private parts), and a girl wiping come from her mouth – that’s right, she’s a serial blowjobber.\n\nKudo attempts to give chase but fails, resulting in an upbraiding from her still attractive older boss “Susan” (Satomi Shinozaki) for not only failing in her duty as an undercover vice squad policewoman and “professional pervert investigator”, but getting molested herself in the process. Yep, that’s the kind of film this is.\n\nContinue reading →\n\n“I want to experience new things.”\n\nReaders of film reviews on this site and listeners to the film episodes of the blog radio show are likely familiar with my stance on physical media vs. streaming. For those few out there who are newbies to the Third Eye Cinema zeitgeist, suffice it to say this, in simplest terms: if I paid for it, I expect to own it in perpetuity, unless I decide to sell or trade or give it away. Simple, clear, and one would think perfectly logical and obvious.\n\nBut as we all know, it’s a changing world. DVD and even Blu-Ray is becoming something of a scarcity on the market, particularly when it comes to the sort of films that drove its existence. Now allow me to explain before moving on.\n\nContinue reading →"
