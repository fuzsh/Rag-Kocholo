First, my friend Yoshiki Hayashi, who all through the 1990s faithfully sent me videos of countless vintage Japanese genre films, recorded off Japanese cable that were otherwise unavailable for viewing. He has also showed me enormous hospitality whenever I have visited Japan, setting up several of the interviews here, shepherding me to various obscure movie poster and book shops, introducing me to many wonderful friends, including respected Japanese critics, performers and filmmakers. Second, Dr Akiko Agishi of Creative Enterprises International, who helped me coordinate virtually all the interviews in this book, provided me with affordable translation and basically just helped however and whenever she was able. The late Kinji Fukasaku, who took time from his busy schedule to personally write letters to many of the interview subjects here (and several who weren’t able to meet with me) asking them to consider my interview requests, and was also just an all-around encouraging presence whenever I saw him. Isao Tsujimoto, who since 1994 (when he was then Los Angeles director for the Japan Foundation) has helped by encouraging me to apply for the Japan Foundation Fellowship Grant, which was an enormous assistance in my first trip to Japan in 1997 doing the research and interviews for not only this book but my voluminous, yet-to-be-published Gun And Sword: An Encyclopedia Of Japanese Gangster Films 1956–1980. Dennis Bartok, head programmer of The American Cinematheque in Los Angeles, who had the good taste, the faith in me and the intuition that I really did know what I was talking about when we first started programming Japanese genre cinema together in the mid-1990s. My girlfriend, Lynne Margulies, who has been extremely supportive, loyal and patient – and even enthusiastic – about all my projects and is truly a kindred spirit when it comes to a mutual taste for offbeat, extreme genre cinema. Toshiko Adilman, lifelong friend and translator for Kinji Fukasaku, who has become close friends with all of us at The American Cinematheque, has helped me immensely in all my writings on Japanese genre cinema and always selflessly offers her assistance when she is able. Philippa Brewster, my editor at I.B. Tauris, who showed me not only enthusiasm but patience. Sheila Whitaker, who after reading my DVD liner notes for Female Convict, ScorpionJailhouse 41, thought I might have a book in me and brought me to Philippa’s attention. Finally, my mother, Rosemary, my late father, Paul, my brother, Vincent, and sister, Mary. Also, enormous thanks are in order to Ai Kennedy; Shoko Ishiyama; Kurando Mitsutake; Naoko Watanabe, Rie Takauchi and Masako Miwa of the Japan Foundation; Mr Kazuo Nawada; Mr Toshinobu Mogami; Yoshihiro Ishimatsu;\n\nvii\n\nviii\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nStuart Galbraith IV; Quentin Tarantino; Julie McLean; Jerry Martinez; Andres Chavez; Takashi Miike; Akiko Funatsu; Hiromi Aihara; Kenta Fukasaku; Christian Storms; Linda Hoaglund; Kiyoshi Kurosawa; Dave Shultz; Barbara Smith; Gwen Deglise; Margot Gerber; Marc Walkow; Mark Rance; Kyoko Hirano; Eiichi Ito; Daniel Savitt; Patrick Macias; Carl Morano; Mona Nagai; Satoko Ishida and Masaki Koga of Shochiku; Merlin David; Yasue Nobusawa of Nikkatsu; Takayuki Yuhara and Tomoko Suzuki of Kadokawa-Daiei; Anthony and Matthew Timpson; Masaharu Ina, Tetsushi Sudo and Shozo Watanabe of Toho, Hideyuki Baba and Yasuhiko Nakajima of Toei.\n\nGLOSSARY\n\n(There are a number of Japanese words I use in the text, some quite often, and I feel that it’s important to provide this glossary.

I had met Dennis, head programmer of The American Cinematheque in Los Angeles, in 1994, when we discovered we held a mutual interest in Japanese genre film directors from the sixties and seventies. I had then initially worked with him as a volunteer consultant, first co-programming Days Of Snow And Blood, a retrospective on the late Hideo Gosha in the summer of 1996. Isao Tsujimoto, who was at the time the Los Angeles director of The Japan Foundation, a worldwide cultural institution devoted to spreading Japanese popular as well as traditional culture outside Japan, was enormously enthusiastic about our ideas and provided significant support as far as grant proposal encouragement, as well as creative input on our programs. The Hideo Gosha series, composed largely of his edgy, hard-boiled samurai films as well as a couple of his yakuza pictures, was a success. Since all three of us were anxious to see more of the films ourselves, as well as expose them to a wider audience, we subsequently co-programmed the first Outlaw Masters series in 1997, featuring films directed by Kinji Fukasaku, Kihachi Okamoto, Eiichi Kudo, Koji Wakamatsu, Kenji Misumi, Yasuzo Masumura and Kazuo Mori. A retrospective of the films of Tai Kato followed in 1998. Since 1999, when I came on staff at The Cinematheque, we have had an Outlaw Masters Of Japanese Film series – now known simply as Japanese Outlaw Masters – nearly every year, including additional retrospectives on directors, Kinji Fukasaku and Kiyoshi Kurosawa, and such period action stars as Raizo Ichikawa and Shintaro Katsu. Before I go any further, I should explain our definition of an ‘outlaw master’. This term is a simple way of describing the directors coming out of the Japanese movie production lines of the late fifties, the sixties and the early seventies: genre filmmakers who made genre movies usually labeled as samurai, yakuza, horror, pink, etc., but who pushed the envelope beyond the usual conventions in some way, either in style or content; or filmmakers who simply, in the tradition of great American pulp directors like Samuel Fuller, Anthony Mann, Don Siegel and Phil Karlson, just made damn fine, fast-moving pictures that could hit you squarely between the eyes and leave you breathless. They did not have to have arthouse movie pretensions. However radical their style of frame composition or editing, however daring or perverse their subject matter, these traits were virtually always borne out of intuition, an innate sense of aesthetics rather than calculation. Instinctive artists who were too often ignored, not only by critics in Japan but by Western critics as well. Although directors like Akira Kurosawa, Masaki Kobayashi,\n\n1\n\n2\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nKon Ichikawa, Shohei Imamura and Nagisa Oshima have all made great genre pictures, or films that have brilliantly deconstructed genre, we have very rarely included their works in our Outlaw Masters series at The American Cinematheque. You will find none of them included here in this book. All of them have never had that much trouble being recognized as pantheon directors of world cinema, nor have they been ignored in print. But there are other truly great directors hailing from Japan since the fifties, directors who either toiled away or who are still toiling away in the salt mines of debased genre, who are only now sporadically starting to get their long-overdue recognition. All the filmmakers in this volume represent Japanese ‘outlaw filmmaking’ in one way or another. Some, like Kinji Fukasaku and Junya Sato, have redefined genre, especially the yakuza film, by unobtrusively creating a tapestry of socio-economic backstory and thus a political context for their ferocious, ultra-violent studies of the Japanese underworld. Others, such as Eiichi Kudo and Kazuo Ikehiro, helped to pioneer a hard-won intelligence and realism in period samurai pictures when the studios were still too often pushing the tried-and-true formulaic and sentimental. Kihachi Okamoto, like Seijun Suzuki, brought a bracing irreverence and kinetic energy to his genre pictures, and was able to swing brilliantly from biting satire in one film to tragic realism in the next with deceptive ease. Yasuharu Hasebe was an unpretentious connoisseur of the action picture, adept at turning out tongue-incheek soufflés as well as his more usual hard-boiled crime dramas. Teruo Ishii was a unique example of an independent director who was able, through some sleight of hand, to work successfully within the studio system for decades, biding his time through occasional hack work, but more often bringing his offbeat sensibilities and visual signature to everything he did. He was also a pioneer of integrating and updating the erotic/grotesque tradition of nineteenth-century kabuki into a number of Grand Guignol films in the sixties and seventies. Seijun Suzuki was another independent director who worked for over a decade in the studio system, but someone who was ultimately more confrontational and less willing to play the game than Teruo Ishii. He was devoted to pushing the envelope until it tore, and, when that finally happened, his studio employers fired him. From his third picture on, his films are astounding examples of often hackneyed material rehabilitated to the point of being nearly unrecognizable, all unpretentious genre pieces rendered fresh and supremely entertaining, faithful to genre expectations but somehow simultaneously mindbending deconstructions. Masahiro Shinoda was a borderline case, someone who, at first glance, seemed to be too much in the ‘arthouse’ mold. But ultimately his nihilistic, cosmically existential and complex world-view won out. The fact, too, is that he has been repeatedly ignored by many film journalists and critics in the last 20 years, writers whose subject is ‘serious’ Japanese cinema and who should know better. Although he has made many non-genre pictures, his unusual genre masterpieces Tears On The Lion’s Mane, Assassination, Samurai Spy, Under The Cherry Blossoms, Demon Pond and – especially – Pale Flower have remained comparatively unknown\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nand unappreciated in the West. I suppose one could also argue that Koji Wakamatsu is another borderline inclusion. At first glance, Wakamatsu would seem to inhabit that shadowy movie underworld that could best be described as Japanese underground cinema, an arena that has seen numerous ‘outlaw’ geniuses shoot comet-like through its firmament, from the likes of writer/directors Shuji Terayama and Toshio Matsumoto to Masao Adachi and Atsushi Yamatoya. But Wakamatsu, without question, was the most successful, not only in terms of output – well over 100 films – but also in terms of influence. Working in debased and despised forms, from the violent pink film to ‘true account’ serial killer pictures, he has brought a startling, visceral and uncompromising social, psychological and political context to nearly all his films (at least, the large handful that I have seen). He has, over the years, counted controversial, respected directors like Nagisa Oshima and Kinji Fukasaku as friends and associates, as well as more radical artists like Masao Adachi. I also felt that it was imperative that at least two performers – one male, one female – from the golden age of ‘outlaw’ genre pictures be included here. Though not filmmakers themselves, Shinichi ‘Sonny’ Chiba and Meiko Kaji helped to shape and mold nearly all their projects once they found themselves stars, pictures that were largely action genre efforts tailored specifically to their larger-than-life charisma. Both are continuing to grow in reputation as their films receive a wider and wider audience all over the world. But the ‘outlaw’ sensibility, despite the economic hard times for the Japanese film industry, did not die and fizzle out at the end of the seventies. The ‘outlaw’ spirit in genre pictures germinated and grew like some impossible-to-kill virus culture, blossoming again since the late eighties with films shot directly for video as well as the occasional theatrical release. Individuality and independence has flourished in the nineties through to the present with a new generation of Japanese ‘outlaw’ filmmakers, represented here by Takashi Miike and Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Both, in their own way, are mavericks, with unassuming yet fiercely opinionated ideas about genre filmmaking. Both have turned out films that are astonishing deconstructions and reinterpretations of genre cinema. And yet both still deliver faithfully to those anticipating an exciting genre picture. Like many of their predecessors mentioned above, they deserve inclusion in this book because they are able to simultaneously destroy and rebuild genre expectations within the duration of a single, exhilarating motion picture. In each chapter that follows, you will find an essay briefly discussing the respective director’s sensibilities, descriptions of a number of his films and a filmography as well as an interview with the filmmaker. I have to report with some sadness and frustration that there are a number of filmmakers I would have liked to include here but who, due to matters of space, had to be omitted. I had especially planned on including an essay and a filmography on each of the four directors who are amongst my favorite Japanese ‘outlaw’ filmmakers. All four – Hideo Gosha, Kenji Misumi, Yasuzo Masumura and Tai Kato – have been\n\n3\n\n4\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\ndeceased for a number of years and interviews were, of course, unavailable. They more than deserve inclusion here. Perhaps one day I’ll be able to devote an entire volume not only to these four but to all the rest who didn’t make it in, many others from the 1950s through to the 1970s. Filmmakers such as Nobuo Nakagawa, Kosaku Yamashita, Norifumi Suzuki, Sadao Nakajima, Kimiyoshi Yasuda, Kazuo Mori, Tokuzo Tanaka, Akira Inoue, Toshio Masuda, Keiichi Ozawa, Takumi Furukawa, Hiroshi Noguchi, Takashi Nomura, Shugoro Nishimura, Kaneto Shindo, Buichi Saito, Junji Kurata, Shigehiro Ozawa, Makoto Naito, Kazuhiko Yamaguchi, Ishiro Honda, Jun Fukuda and Motomu ‘Tan’ Iida, to name a few, as well as such directors from the 1990s and beyond as Shinya Tsukamoto, ‘Beat’ Takeshi Kitano, Takashi Ishii, Hideo Nakata, Rokuro Mochizuki and Sogo Ishii. There are also unsung performers from Japanese genre cinema who deserve to be looked at and appreciated for their enormous contributions: such stars as Ken Takakura, Koji Tsuruta, Shintaro Katsu, Raizo Ichikawa, Bunta Sugawara, Noboru Ando, Tomisaburo Wakayama, Tetsuro Tanba, Hiroki Matsukata, Joe Shishido, Tetsuya Watari, Hideki Takahashi, Junko Fuji, Yumiko Nogawa, Michiyo Yasuda, Kyoko Enami, Reiko Ike, Miki Sugimoto, Hiroko Ogi, Junko Miyazono and Reiko Oshida – once again, to name only a few.\n\n1 Kinji Fukasaku 1930–2003\n\nKinji Fukasaku was still directing the sequel to Battle Royale, Battle Royale 2, mere days before his death from cancer at the age of 72 in January, 2003. Even though his doctors had recommended that he curtail his workload with the hope of prolonging his life, the director had decided to ignore them and try to get one more movie under his belt before he shuffled off this mortal coil. It must have been especially frustrating for him, as he’d beaten the disease earlier in the decade and had barely slowed down his film career at the time. He’d also been a very active head of the Japanese Director’s Guild since 1996. Fukasaku directed his initial five films in 1961, the first four of which – two Wandering Detective and two Vigilante With The Funky Hat pictures – were short, barely 60-minute-long programmers designed to fill out the second half of Toei studios’ double bills. His fifth film and first at feature length was High Noon For Gangsters, an anarchic, pull-out-the-stops gang heist movie filled to the brim with wild ideas and daringly offbeat juxtapositions. One element that is still relevant today shows the cynical, manipulating leader (Tetsuro Tanba) using the racist tension generated by two gang members, a southern cracker (Danny Yuma) who is jealous of his nympho wife’s attention to a black GI deserter (Isaac Saxon), to keep the whole gang slightly off-kilter and under his thumb. It never fails to amaze me that Fukasaku was able to integrate his provocative ideas about social injustice and the oppressive political and economic environment in Japan into many of his earliest films. The Proud Challenge is another example, the story of a reporter (Koji Tsuruta), blacklisted for his Communist Party ties, trying to expose a plot between Japanese politicians and the CIA to transfer weapons through Japan into Southeast Asia. Fukasaku was one of the pioneering yakuza film directors trying to introduce a realistic ambience into gangster movies, something that would come to be labeled as jitsuroku when the trend really caught on in the early seventies. Fukasaku was at\n\n5\n\n6\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nthe head of the pack, unleashing such uncompromising films for the time period as League Of Gangsters and Wolves, Pigs And People. Wolves especially is one of the grittiest, angriest yakuza films ever made in Japan. It’s as potent as any of his later mid-seventies pictures, with a lone wolf (Ken Takakura) plotting with his girlfriend (Sanae Nakahara) and an avaricious thug (Shinjiro Ebara) to trick his kid brother’s (Kinya Kitaoji) delinquent gang to help them rip off a money courier at the airport. Things go wrong when Kitaoji’s bunch return to the hideout, with the precious briefcase, before Takakura and discover just how much money was really involved. The kids hide the loot but get caught by Takakura and Ebara, who imprison them in a ramshackle warehouse, torturing them for the money’s whereabouts. Meanwhile, their big brother (Rentaro Mikuni), a member of the gang that’s been ripped off, is pressured to find his brothers and get back the cash. What ensues is a grueling contest of wills as all three brothers have to decide what is ultimately important to them. Events spiral out of control as filial ties crumble, ending in bloody, downbeat fashion. Awe-inspiring, topped off with Isao Tomita’s amazing hybrid score of lounge jazz, Coltranesque squawk and distorted surf guitar. Fukasaku continued to insert hot potato issues into his pictures. In Ceremony Of Disbanding, freshly unaffiliated gang member Koji Tsuruta becomes disillusioned with an old comrade and neophyte gang boss (Fumio Watanabe) when he decides to bid on the construction of gross-polluting factories in a poor neighborhood that is already surrounded by environmentally unsafe plants. Tsuruta not only identifies with the inhabitants but is upset because his old flame and her son live there. Tsuruta is ready to resort to violence with his estranged pal, but a young, rival gangbanger beats him to it, fatally stabbing Watanabe before his very eyes. Tsuruta realizes the boy is from the opposing mob and heads over to their HQ , where he not only wipes them out before being mortally wounded but also kills two corrupt politicians who’d instigated the bidding war. The following year, 1968, Fukasaku continued to direct cutting-edge yakuza pictures for Toei, but also accepted an offer from Shochiku studios to helm an adaptation of famed mystery writer Edogawa Rampo’s Black Lizard from a stage play by Yukio Mishima. Isao Kimura portrays shy, stubborn detective Akechi, who plunges down a rabbit hole of psychedelic depravity in his quest for female jewel thief Black Lizard (played by famous drag star Akihiro Maruyama). Black Lizard was an unqualified success, so Shochiku asked Fukasaku to do another picture with the star, Maruyama, right away, utilizing a similar approach. To his credit, he did not want to jump right into something without adequate preparation. He prudently realized he would need time to make sure the sequel was done correctly. Shochiku already had the rights to another property, a crime scenario, and asked Fukasaku to undertake it in the interim. This became Blackmail Is My Life, which follows the exploits of a young up-from-the-slums swinger (Hiroki Matsukata) who will do nearly anything to keep his freewheeling lifestyle intact. His lucky streak of blackmailing unravels in vicious fashion when he and\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\npartners (Tomomi Sato et al.) unwisely target business allies of a powerful, behindthe-scenes political boss (Tetsuro Tanba). Somehow Fukasaku also found time to direct the wild and woolly space opera The Green Slime the same year, an American–Japanese co-production starring Robert Horton, Luciana Paluzzi and Richard Jaeckel. It was a film that caused him considerable embarrassment in later years, in spite of the fact that many of his biggest fans, including Quentin Tarantino, have professed their love for the fast-moving, over-the-top monster fest. Personally, it’s my favorite of Fukasaku’s handful of science fiction movies. Finally, Fukasaku felt ready to proceed with the second Maruyama project at Shochiku, and returned the next year to lens Black Rose Mansion. This time the story concerned a wealthy, introspective businessman (Eitaro Ozawa) who installs chanteuse ‘Black Rose’ (Akihiro Maruyama) in his elegant private men’s club to attract customers, but is alarmed when she also lures scores of homicidal past lovers. Ozawa realizes too late that not only he but his wastrel son (Masakazu Tamura) as well have both fallen for the femme fatale.\n\nTetsuya Watari in Graveyard Of Honor\n\n7\n\n8\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nFukasaku also directed Boss in 1969, the first installment of Toei’s new contemporary yakuza series, Japan’s Violent Gangs, a kind of jitsuroku/ninkyo hybrid with Koji Tsuruta as a world-weary gang boss returning from prison who finds that the newly allied corporate gangs have left little breathing room. Little by little, his gang is chipped away, with an underboss played by Bunta Sugawara the first to bite the dust. Tsuruta hopes to find common ground with the elder sharks dominating the waters and consults with an old friend (Ryohei Uchida) who is employed by the head godfather (Asao Uchida). But things don’t go smoothly for long. Strangely enough, Tsuruta uncovers an ally in the bullying, drug-addicted boss (Tomisaburo Wakayama) of a bunch of rebellious misfits. Still, one by one the dominoes fall until only Tsuruta is left. He meets Ryohei Uchida outside a mob gathering, duels with him, and Uchida gallantly gives up his life to save his friend. He knows his new bosses are scum and wants to leave an unobstructed path for Tsuruta to assassinate them. Which Tsuruta does before being overwhelmed. Fukasaku returned briefly to Shochiku in 1970 to direct the restless youth fable If You Were Young – Rage, tracking a closely-knit crew of hard-up young men who pool their resources to buy a dump truck but are soon torn apart in a chaos of class turmoil and youthful indiscretion. One of the boys perishes in a violent workers’ demonstration, another is arrested for robbery, and a third gets married. The remaining two (Tetsuo Ishidate and Gin Maeda) try to persevere, but nightmarish complications set in when their jailed comrade escapes from prison. A vitriolic indictment of post-war Japan’s absence of opportunity for young people. Koji Tsuruta returns in Gambler – Foreign Opposition (aka Sympathy For The Underdog), one of the few entries in the Gambler series not devoted to a pre-WW2 period ninkyo saga. Tsuruta is banished by mainland yakuza to Okinawa where he ends up getting together with sympathetic friends (Noboru Ando and Asao Koike) and a belligerent youth (Tsunehiko Watase). All too soon, homicidal fireworks with not just the local gang led by scarred, one-armed Tomisaburo Wakayama, but American gangsters, too, suck the wind out of their sails. Even worse, hard-earned gains are threatened when the corporate mainland boss (Asao Uchida) unexpectedly arrives at the climax with his gangster minions. Brutally unrepentant with a subtle sense of humor. Fukasaku has mentioned in several interviews that he feels 1972 was a turning point in his career, finally giving him almost total control over his projects. In Under The Fluttering Military Flag, one of his favorite, most personal pictures, a WW2 widow (Sachiko Hidari) pieces together the Rashomon-style puzzle of her soldier husband’s (Tetsuro Tanba) fate through a bureaucratic maze and the contradictory recollections of surviving comrades. What emerges is a catch-22 struggle against madness as she learns Tanba had been executed for killing his insane commanding officer (Shinjiro Ebara), a man guilty of murdering his own men if they failed to follow orders. Fukasaku almost always shared screenwriting credit on his films, and this scathing anti-war indictment was co-written by director Kaneto Shindo.\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nStreet Mobster, the sixth and final entry in Toei’s Modern Yakuza series, looks at an arrogant wannabe (Bunta Sugawara) who rockets his way up out of the gutter into bigger rackets only to be constantly beaten down by the established gang. The mob boss (Noboru Ando), who remembers what it was like to be down and out, is fond of Sugawara despite his big mouth, but Sugawara’s dissolute lifestyle, murderously jealous girl (Mayumi Nagisa, in a bravura performance) and messed-up pals prove his undoing. Nothing can stop the death-dealing that ensues in this classic, what amounts to a dry run for Graveyard Of Honor. In 1973 Fukasaku undertook what was to become one of the most acclaimed yakuza films ever made. Battles Without Honor And Humanity was adapted from a series of articles by Koichi Iiboshi, a journalist and former yakuza recounting the genesis and gang wars of several prominent, post-WW2 Hiroshima yakuza families. Working from a scorching script by Kazuo Kasahara, Fukasaku follows a rootless ex-soldier (Bunta Sugawara) as he wanders through the chaos of a destroyed Hiroshima, finally falling in with a yakuza gang led by weaselly Nobuo Kaneko. He becomes blood brothers with a member of another gang (Tatsuo Umemiya) while in prison. When again briefly free, we see Sugawara’s rise in the ranks, Umemiya’s eventual death and another comrade, hot-headed Hiroki Matsukata, splitting off from Kaneko’s bunch. When Sugawara is paroled again in the mid-fifties, he finds things changed and is disheartened at the factional infighting that has fragmented his former gang. Kaneko tries to manipulate him into killing Matsukata, who now has his own up-and-coming mob, but Sugawara is noncommittal. Kaneko succeeds in getting someone else, and they catch Matsukata at his most vulnerable while he’s shopping for a doll for his adopted daughter’s birthday. Sugawara goes to his funeral, and the bosses attending, including craven Kaneko, panic as he pulls out his gun. But he shoots up the funeral altar where the hypocritical bosses have paid tribute, effectively rendering meaningless the idea of jingi (gang code of ethics). The film was a huge success, and Toei turned it into a series, with Fukasaku once more at the helm for Battles 2, Hiroshima Death Match. Sugawara is something of a tangential character, observing the plight of a young outcast (Kinya Kitaoji) with low Akihiro Maruyama in Black Lizard self-esteem who is constantly beaten by a sadistic\n\n9\n\n10\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nneighborhood tough (Sonny Chiba). Kitaoji joins the gang of a callous boss (Hiroshi Nawa) and ends up falling in love with his browbeaten daughter (Meiko Kaji). At the climax, trying to ingratiate himself, Kitaoji makes a hit at Nawa’s request, then hides in an abandoned restaurant. When the police close in, he blows his brains out. Fukasaku and Kasahara continued the gritty jitsuroku exploration through the fifth entry, Saga Conclusion. All are exemplary examples of hard-boiled yakuza realism, featuring not only Toei performers like Sugawara, Umemiya and Matsukata but also such former Nikkatsu stars as Akira Kobayashi and Joe Shishido. When Toei wished to do more films in the series, calling it New Battles Without Honor And Humanity, Fukasaku and the star, Sugawara, signed on. However, this time a fresh squad of writers joined the ranks, including such veteran yakuza film scribes as Fumio Konami, Koji Takada and Susumu Saji. Once the sixth, seventh and eighth (and supposedly final) film had been lensed, Toei decided that they still wanted more. Fukasaku demurred, and Eiichi Kudo was drafted to direct the final installment, Aftermath Of Battles Without Honor And Humanity. All eight of Fukasaku’s Battles entries, taken either alone or together, are an astounding achievement. But, right in the midst of the series, Fukasaku conjured up another yakuza picture that eclipsed them all, a white-hot blast furnace of a movie that left only scorched earth in its wake. Based on a real-life character from Fukasaku’s own home district of Mito, Graveyard Of Honor tracks the post-WW2 progress of alternately monstrous/bewildered Rikuo Ishikawa (Tetsuya Watari), a sociopathic loser who can’t seem to get along with even his misfit yakuza pals. A humiliating scolding by his boss (Hajime Hana) leads to Ishikawa returning later with mayhem in mind, but the boss escapes mortal injury. With a contract out on him, Ishikawa takes refuge with a gentle woman (Yumi Takigawa) he’d once raped, and soon they develop as close as Ishikawa will ever come to a ‘normal’ relationship. He does the pinkie-trimming yakuza method of apology for his boss, and it brings an uneasy truce, but Ishikawa remains a shunned outcast. After being introduced to the dubious pleasures of heroin by a junkie whore (Meiko Seri, in a haunting scene), he begins hanging out with a ne’er-do-well addict (Kunie Tanaka). Ishikawa’s addiction sinks him deeper into an abyss of self-pity that has him assassinating his best friend (Tatsuo Umemiya) over an imagined slight. At the same time, his girl, Takigawa, has caught tuberculosis from him, and Ishikawa wakes up one morning to find that she’s slashed her wrists. Living in a hell largely of his own making, Ishikawa starts to go over the edge. When he begins to eat his girlfriend’s bones after her cremation, his former gangmates plot his death. But they have to postpone their plan when Ishikawa and his junkie buddy barricade themselves inside their ramshackle crash pad in a shootout with the cops – something which Ishikawa manages to escape. Miraculously, Fukasaku’s non-manipulative direction and Watari’s painfully felt performance somehow manage to elicit compassion as well as horror at this inhuman monster. There’s a scene near the end where Ishikawa is returning from a tombstone engraver, his impotent attempt to atone for his behavior towards his\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\ngirl and murdered friend, when he stops in a back alley to fix. Suddenly he’s ambushed by his former comrades, knifed repeatedly and left for dead. As he lies bleeding in the mud he looks up at the sky, and we see his point of view of a balloon floating in the azure blue. Accompanied by Toshiaki Tsushima’s lyrical score, the viewer experiences one of cinema’s most memorably heartbreaking moments. Amazingly, Ishikawa still doesn’t die, finally jumping to his death from a prison hospital roof, landing in a literal explosion of blood. In State Police Vs. Organized Crime, a live-and-let-live police detective (Bunta Sugawara) has his friendship with a yakuza drinking buddy (Hiroki Matsukata) destroyed by internecine gang warfare and the intervention of his supervisor (Tatsuo Umemiya), an anti-corruption crusader. Sugawara’s police detective is one of those unsung anti-heroes, a man who remains true to himself because he believes more in human decency than he does in duty to his predominantly cold-hearted, bureaucratic colleagues. And, for that, he pays the ultimate price. An unsentimental, realistic dissection of the often strange symbiosis of Japan’s law enforcement and underworld. What was explored with a more omniscient viewpoint in State Police is looked at from a hot-blooded perspective in Yakuza Burial. This was Fukasaku and Tetsuya Watari’s follow-up to Graveyard Of Honor, and Watari is astonishing as a brooding, maverick cop who doesn’t have any patience for the niceties of bureaucratic red tape. To his chagrin, he gradually realizes he has more in common with his yakuza nemesis (Tatsuo Umemiya) and the estranged wife (Meiko Kaji) of Umemiya’s imprisoned boss. When Watari’s supervisor (Mikio Narita) comes down hard on him, Watari initially thinks it’s because he’s become Umemiya’s drinking buddy and Kaji’s lover. But it becomes clear that high-ranking cops have established a tacit alliance with Umemiya’s main rival, a politically savvy gang boss (Kei Sato), to help control street crime. When Watari hides Umemiya after he’s been wounded in the ensuing gang war, Sato’s gang kidnaps Watari and forcibly addicts him to heroin. As a result, Umemiya is ambushed and killed, and Kaji almost shoots drugged-up Watari believing he’s the betrayer. We learn that she, herself, has been a closet junkie all along to deal with not just the criminal chaos around her but her own dispossessed Korean heritage. Watari has Kaji drive him to police HQ , goes upstairs to where boss Sato is in conference and empties his gun into him in front of his shocked police superiors. He then calmly leaves. Watari’s former partner (Hideo Murota) follows him outside and shoots him in front of Kaji. Watari dies in her arms. A fascinating and emotionally exhausting flip side to the Dirty Harry archetype. Fukasaku also made two very entertaining yakuza caper movies in 1975 and 1976, Gambling Den Heist and Violent Panic – The Big Crash, the latter being one of his wildest action films with the last third a non-stop demolition derby through the city as protagonists Tsunehiko Watase and Miki Sugimoto attempt to escape a lunatic caravan of covetous yakuza, police, TV reporters, bikers and independent thieves who are all attempting to get their hands on Watase’s huge bank haul.\n\n11\n\n12\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nHokuriku Proxy War was another jitsuroku yakuza blitzkrieg, this time set in a snowy Hokkaido coastal town where a murderously independent yakuza boss (Hiroki Matsukata) is bent on gaining tighter control of the territory. Sonny Chiba is slickly venal as an oily, smooth-talking gangster and Ko Nishimura convincing as always, as an elder boss obstinately sticking to his guns. The splendid Yumiko Nogawa unfortunately doesn’t have much to do. Filmed on actual Hokkaido locations, the stormy winter atmosphere is savage and palpably chilling, giving the cold-blooded brutality on display a teeth-chattering edge. Although Fukasaku did not direct many jidai-geki films, the ones he did do were generally designed as all-star epics. In Shogun’s Samurai, a fanatical, power-obsessed Lord Yagyu (Kinnosuke Yorozuya Nakamura) will do anything to keep the disfigured, going-mad Shogun (Hiroki Matsukata) in office, including genocide and warring with his own son, one-eyed Jubei (Sonny Chiba). This was the feature-length film version of a phemonenally popular seventies Japanese TV show, Yagyu Clan Conspiracy. At Toei’s behest, Fukasaku also directed his own version of The Loyal 47 Ronin the same year, The Fall Of Ako Castle. The all-star cast was headed by Kinnosuke Yorozuya, Sonny Chiba and Mieko Harada, and eschewed much of the sentimental, elegiac elements that helped to capsize many of the other versions of Chushingura that have been produced since the silent era. Message From Space was the big-screen counterpart of another popular Japanese TV series known as Swords Of The Space Ark. Vic Morrow, Sonny Chiba and Hiroyuki Sanada lead the cast of interplanetary heroes in response to a distress signal from a planet in trouble in an imaginative, Star Wars-inspired sci-fi/fantasy. Be forewarned, though, that the voice dubbing in the English-language version of Message is some of the worst the viewer will ever encounter. That, in concert with the only so-so effects and grating-on-the-eyes production design, makes this one of Fukasaku’s few hard-to-sit-through films. Between 1980 and 1983 Fukasaku labored on three productions for the very hands-on producer Haruki Kadokawa, the self-made head of a vast publishing empire that often produced movie versions of their most successful best-sellers. Although Kadokawa films from the nineties have often been good to excellent (the original version of Ring directed by Hideo Nakata is a prime example), his efforts in the eighties were a decidedly more mixed bag. Virus, Samurai Reincarnation and Legend Of The Eight Samurai are all epics, and they all suffer from an overly ambitious vision without an adequate-size budget or shooting schedule to properly address that vision. All three have moments of power and patches that are very entertaining. In some ways, Virus is the most watchable. It’s the chronicle of a germ warfare accident that goes unreported due to the fear of political repercussions, and, as a consequence, only a mere handful of people are left on earth before the last frame unspools. Samurai Reincarnation features Sonny Chiba again as Jubei Yagyu, but this time he’s up against an executed Christian samurai, Amakusa Shiro Tokisada (Kenji Sawada), who has come back from the dead. Making a pact with the devil, Tokisada\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nhas resurrected three of Japan’s most famous swordsmen, including Musashi Miyamoto (Ken Ogata in one of the most God-awful wigs you’ll ever see in any movie). Collaborating with cinematographer Kiyoshi Hasegawa and art director Tokumichi Igawa, Fukasaku establishes a hypnotic blend of kabuki theatricality, bone-crunching martial arts mayhem, dreamlike erotica and creepy supernatural horror. Legend Of The Eight Samurai was the latest version of Satomi Hakkenden, a famous samurai legend incorporating sword-and-sorcery-style fantasy. However, not only are some of the production values questionable, the English-language version is almost impossible to sit through. In 1992 Fukasaku returned to crime action films with Triple Cross, a tale of labyrinthine relationships and gruelling violence punctuated with dark humor. A wronged lone wolf (Kenichi Hagiwara), a bleached-blonde pretty-boy conman, his savvy, punk rock girlfriend, a coked-out hitman (Yoshio Harada), a Japanese heavy metal band and a small-time yakuza clan all vie for the possession of a treasure trove of cash. The last half-hour is non-stop mayhem, with some out-of-control Hong Kong action influence blended in with old-school, seventies-style brutality. With Crest Of Betrayal, Fukasaku cultivated a hothouse hybrid of two of the most famous Japanese period stories, Ghost Of Yotsuya (Yotsuya Kaidan) and The Loyal 47 Ronin (Chushingura). Koichi Sato is Iemon, one of the 47 masterless samurai plotting revenge after their lord is forced to commit hara-kiri. He is also being haunted by Oiwa, the wife he murdered to marry an insane rich girl, Oume. Phantasmagorical imagery, swordfights and colorful kabuki production design mingle in this examination of the spiritual microcosm of the feudal psyche. Battle Royale was Fukasaku’s last fully completed picture, and it stands as one of his most uncompromising, an ultra-controversial, action-packed examination of the institutionalization of violence. A fascist teacher (Beat Takeshi Kitano) maniacally leads his high school class on a government-sponsored survival-of-the-fittest experiment on a desert island. Over-the-top carnage escalates into an apocalyptic climax; 40 years after bursting on the Japanese film scene, a testament that the maestro had lost none of his fiery social conscience or subversive dark humor.

Toshiko Adilman, Kinji’s long-time friend and translator, visiting from Toronto, did the on-site translation. CD: Tell me about the first two films you directed, the pair of Wandering Detective pictures? FUKASAKU: The system in place in those days was to let new directors make their first films as relatively short features, 60 or 65 minutes. This was to see if they had any talent. If they felt you had talent after those films, they’d let you direct the longer pictures. So those were shorter second features to the longer first features on a double bill. CD: Your first entry in the Gang series, Gang Vs. G-Men ... FUKASAKU: ... is the story of an ex-yakuza who becomes an undercover policeman. A role played by Koji Tsuruta. CD: The Gang series, even though a bit old-fashioned at first, as it progressed it became more true to life, for example your League Of Gangsters – a precursor of the jitsuroku type of yakuza picture that became commonplace in the seventies. Then there were your other early yakuza pictures, like High Noon For Gangsters and Wolves, Pigs And People, which are pretty amazing, considering when you made them. FUKASAKU: I think you’re correct to say that. But the stories were all fictitious and not based on any real people or events. CD: Do you feel that you were one of the pioneers of that jitsuroku style of yakuza picture? FUKASAKU: Perhaps. The first film of mine that I felt really successfully blended that documentary feel with the fictitious drama was Street Mobster. From that film on, I was more aware of the real past and contemporary underworld, characters and events I could draw on to give the films a more reality-based feeling. CD: You never directed any yakuza movies that could be termed ninkyo eiga. Did you not want to direct any ninkyo films? FUKASAKU: Back then Toei had two studio branches, one in Kyoto, one in Tokyo. The one in Kyoto made the jidai-geki pictures, the samurai chanbara, and also, as the sixties progressed, the ninkyo yakuza films, which were also set in period – say the late Meiji era, the Taisho era, the early Showa period. I was stationed at the Tokyo branch, and we concentrated on making contemporary films. When we did yakuza films, they were set in a relatively contemporary time period. The ninkyo stories from Kyoto didn’t really fit with our dramaturgy. The pictures directors like Umeji Inoue and I did in the Gang series, films like Gang Vs. G-Men, were modern-style action films, but at the same time they were not very realistic. The more realistic pictures came in with films like Street Mobster. I think that gives you a clear delineation.\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nCD: In your films Gambler – Ceremony Of Disbanding, Gambler – Foreign Opposition, Japan’s Violent Gangs – Boss you see Koji Tsuruta, a ninkyo actor, playing a much more world-weary character – FUKASAKU: – World-weary? CD: Out of place. A more alienated character than you see when he starred in ninkyo yakuza films. FUKASAKU: I always thought that Koji Tsuruta’s personality was more in tune with that kind of character, someone who is left behind, frozen in time.\n\nPoster for Street Mobster (aka Modern Yakuza – Outlaw Killer)\n\n17\n\n18\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nOne of the first films that I worked on with him was The Proud Challenge, which was not a yakuza film. And I felt that then. He was playing a newspaper reporter who’d been sacked because he was an idealistic Communist. CD: Did Mr Tsuruta ever express any objections to things his character had to do in your films? FUKASAKU: No, no, I didn’t ever have any problems with him. CD: In Gambler – Foreign Opposition, Tsuruta’s character wears sunglasses through virtually the entire movie, even when he’s in bed with his girlfriend. Whose idea was that? FUKASAKU: (laughs) I had him do that in The Proud Challenge, too. He was a journalist in that and a yakuza in the Gambler film. But it was my idea. You know, sometimes I thought when he was playing these characters his face looked a little too gentle. I wanted to occasionally make him look a little different, tougher. CD: More sinister. FUKASAKU: So I had him wear the sunglasses. CD: In Boss, Tomisaburo Wakayama plays a wild, drug-addicted gangster and, as it turns out, he has more in common with the strong, quiet gang boss, played by Tsuruta, rather than with the corporate gang bosses, men without honor. Both Tsuruta and Wakayama hold them as a common enemy and almost become friends because of that. FUKASAKU: Yes, strange bedfellows. CD: Can you talk about working with Wakayama? FUKASAKU: Tsuruta had always been a star and pretty much always played the lead role. The character in Boss didn’t really suit his tastes, and he wasn’t very keen to do it. In comparison to Tsuruta, Wakayama had a quality that was conducive to playing a bad guy. Much like other actors such as Lee Van Cleef or Humphrey Bogart. Wakayama belonged very much to that school of tough guy. In the beginning of the movie Tsuruta’s and Wakayama’s characters are enemies, but before you know it, when they both face a common adversity, they become close. I thought that that idea was very interesting. And the audience liked it, too. CD: Ryohei Uchida also appeared in Boss as Tsuruta’s old friend who has joined up with the more corporate gang. You have him dressed in a white suit through the whole picture. Did you have any special reason for that, since he was the only member of the corporate gang to wear white and who had any remnants of decency left? FUKASAKU: Well, Tsuruta looked better in black, and, to be honest, Wakayama wasn’t too stylish. But Ryohei Uchida had a natural sense of style to him. He looked good in the suit. Also, he wore the white suit to show he was a member of a more prosperous, money-conscious gang. It made him stand out from the rest of his gang, but I wasn’t consciously doing it because he was the only honorable one. CD: In Street Mobster, Bunta Sugawara is a post-WW2 orphan of the streets with no moral upbringing. Before the prostitute played by Mayumi Nagisa becomes his girlfriend, his only experiences with women are through rape. In fact, he and his friends had raped Nagisa earlier, something that had led her down the path to prostitution. And\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nhe also can’t get along with other yakuza. Sugawara’s character is similar to the character played by Tetsuya Watari in your later film, Graveyard Of Honor. FUKASAKU: Graveyard Of Honor was based on a real character, while Street Mobster was completely fictitious. But I had already had the idea for Graveyard Of Honor before Street Mobster. I was aware of the real-life gangster Rikuo Ishikawa, because he had come from the same area as me down in Mito, and thought his story would make a good film. I decided to incorporate elements of his character in Street Mobster to see how it would work. When it turned out well, I made up my mind to do the story in an even more realistic style in Graveyard Of Honor. CD: There seem to be quite a lot of superficial roles for women in yakuza films in general – FUKASAKU: – What about Mayumi Nagisa in Street Mobster? CD: She was going to be part of my question. She’s one of the exceptions. FUKASAKU: And Yumi Takigawa in Graveyard Of Honor? CD: Yes, she was great in that. I’m not talking specifically about your yakuza films – more in general terms. You don’t get many strong females in yakuza pictures except for the more mythical ninkyo films, such as Red Peony Gambler with Junko Fuji. Mayumi Nagisa’s character in Street Mobster is such an incredibly strong role for a woman in a jitsuroku-style yakuza picture. She really does seem to be one of the exceptions. FUKASAKU: I think if you look at films such as Street Mobster, they are exceptional films. They aren’t run-of-the-mill. CD: Why, though, aren’t there stronger women’s roles in those kinds of yakuza films? Perhaps it’s naive or maybe just too obvious in this day and age to say this, but I also think women in Japan, because of the ingrained culture, have had a harder time than women in Western cultures in asserting their individuality. FUKASAKU: Well, I would turn that around then and ask you if there are any strong women’s roles in American gangster pictures. CD: Not really. I suppose you’re right. There were some in the forties and the fifties. But they were more in the detective or film noir genres. Movies like Out Of The Past (1948) with Jane Greer, Gun Crazy (1950) with Peggy Cummins, Crime Of Passion(1957) with Barbara Stanwyck. But it’s true, movies like the Godfather trilogy and Martin Scorsese’s Mean Streets don’t really have particularly strong female characters. Perhaps later on when you get to Lorraine Bracco in Goodfellas and Sharon Stone in Casino. FUKASAKU: Well, when you do a jitsuroku yakuza film, just by its nature you’re going to be telling a tale about men. And when you have to concentrate on one or two male characters, you just don’t have the space to concentrate as much on any female roles. And then, when there’s action, at least in the past in Japan, women have not been as physically strong, and they don’t traditionally go around killing people. You also want to establish the attractiveness of whatever female characters you do have, so you can see the dilemma.\n\n19\n\n20\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nCD: You see more of the assertive female characters in some ninkyo films like the Red Peony Gambler pictures, movies which are admittedly not connected to any historical reality. FUKASAKU: However, characters like Junko Fuji in Red Peony Gambler are not necessarily more complex because they are strong characters. In some ways, they are one-dimensional, similar to the characters that Ken Takakura played in those ninkyo films. They don’t do any bad things. They always remain clean. CD: There’s a more truthful picture of the yakuza in the Battles Without Honor And Humanity series. But you don’t see as much of their moneymaking activities as you do in, for instance, some of Junya Sato’s jitsuroku yakuza pictures. You will actually see the yakuza forcing women into prostitution, in collusion with labor unions, extorting money. But in the Battles Without Honor films you see more of the gangsters having meetings, devising betrayals, then bloody vendettas and gang wars erupting. Why did you decide to concentrate more on that? FUKASAKU: I encompassed the period from 1945 through 1955 in the Battles Without Honor movies. Most of Junya Sato’s films start around 1965, a time where there was a big crunch for the yakuza. They were starting to become more corporate and had to become more ingenious in ferreting out income for their very survival. The Battles Without Honor films are also set outside Tokyo, in Hiroshima right after the war. There was a lot more street crime, much more mindless violence and many gang wars in struggles for supremacy. CD: There was also the black market and drug-dealing which you do show – FUKASAKU: – I was trying to show the yakuza’s race to catch up as Japan’s reconstruction took place after the war. Those yakuza did not have brains or social status. They were trying to run after the bus, so to speak, so they wouldn’t miss the ride to prosperity. CD: There was also supposedly collusion between the yakuza and the US occupation forces in the late forties and through the early fifties. Was there some reason you didn’t touch on much of that in the series? FUKASAKU: That alliance, you could look at that as the yakuza riding along with the US occupation. In Tokyo and Osaka, both the Japanese police and the US military entrusted the yakuza to keep order in the black market. Some American soldiers also provided the yakuza with goods to resell on the black market at a profit. Also, arms were stolen from the military and resold. CD: There’s hints of that in Battles Without Honor And Humanity – Summit Of Operations. FUKASAKU: The selling of commodities on the black market from the US military, you see that in the beginning of Graveyard Of Honor. CD: The US occupation was nervous about Communist influences in the labor unions and would often employ yakuza as strike-breakers when there were labor conflicts. FUKASAKU: Yes, the yakuza definitely helped out the US occupation forces in that regard. I really didn’t touch on that in the Battles Without Honor series.\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nBut my earlier movie, The Proud Challenge, was about that and was meant as an exposé of the CIA’s plot to crush the Communist and socialist left in Japan. CD: All through your Battles Without Honor series there is incredible violence. Were the gang wars, not only in Hiroshima but also in Osaka and Tokyo, that violent in real life? FUKASAKU: Hiroshima was the only city that I’m aware of where even ordinary citizens became victims of the violence. People getting caught in the crossfire. CD: And the films largely taking place in Hiroshima, it’s almost as if the gangsters are mutations from the radioactive fallout … FUKASAKU: (laughs) CD: … in a metaphorical sense. That this was the nadir of the worst because of its location, where the atom bomb was dropped. FUKASAKU: I felt that metaphor, too. The genesis of the extreme violence with the gangsters almost appearing right out of the dust and smoke of the mushroom cloud. And that’s why we used the stock footage of the bomb going off at the beginning of the film. CD: There’s a scene in Battles Without Honor And Humanity – Saga Conclusion where a young gangster is in a shootout in front of a Toei movie theater showing a Junko Fuji film and actually dies on top of one of her film posters. Was that a comment that the romanticizing of the yakuza, as in the kind of ninkyo films that she was in, ultimately had a destructive effect on certain impressionable segments of the audience? FUKASAKU: Yes, you could say that. But, more specifically, having him die on her picture was just an ironic comment on the fate of this boy who wanted to achieve the yakuza idyll but couldn’t quite get there. CD: One of the writers on Graveyard Of Honor, Tatsuhiko Kamoi, also wrote several of Tetsuya Watari’s pictures while he was still at Nikkatsu studios, including Yukihiro Sawada’s Kanto Society Of Leading Mobsters (Kanto Kanbukai, 1971), which I think is one of Watari’s best films. Did Watari have anything to do with him coming on to the project? FUKASAKU: Tatsuo Yoshida, who was the producer, first asked Mr Kamoi to write, but his script didn’t end up being used for the most part. So I hired Fumio Konami and Hiro Matsuda to take a crack at it. CD: Tetsuya Watari’s last few yakuza pictures at Nikkatsu were leaning more towards the jitsuroku approach, and his roles seemed to get a bit tougher than his earlier sixties Nikkatsu films. But, in Graveyard Of Honor, it was a startling transformation, as if he’d become another person. Did he feel that the part was a challenge? Or maybe an unflattering role for him? FUKASAKU: Watari was very excited and felt it was a great challenge. But some of the producers who had worked with Watari at Nikkatsu were rather reluctant to see him take the part. CD: Was the character his part was based on also a heroin addict in real life? FUKASAKU: Yes.\n\n21\n\n22\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nCD: Bunta Sugawara plays a police detective in State Police Vs. Organized Crime. How did he feel about playing a policeman as opposed to the gangster role he usually took on? FUKASAKU: Well, he’d played yakuza in so many of the previous films we decided he should play a policeman, but a bad policeman. CD: But his character isn’t really bad, is he? FUKASAKU: (laughs) As far as society and morality goes, he’s bad. He’s compromised. Maybe he doesn’t come off as that bad. You could describe him as being humane, even though he’s corrupt. And in contrast to the more ordinary, average policemen who all seem a bit inhuman. CD: Tetsuya Watari plays a similar character in Yakuza Burial and doesn’t really fit in with his fellow cops or with the yakuza. Was this something you’d been working on or something the studio proposed as a follow-up to Graveyard Of Honor? FUKASAKU: Well, Watari wanted to do another film with me. But we’d exhausted the Battles Without Honor story. So we came up with this idea of an immoral cop, much like Sugawara’s character in State Police Vs. Organized Crime. But we wanted to go even further examining his character, and show that, despite his faults, he really is more ethical and humane than his fellow police detectives. CD: Watari has made only a few films since Yakuza Burial. FUKASAKU: He ended up concentrating more on TV work. He’s still very popular on television. CD: Where did the idea come from for Hokuriku Proxy War? FUKASAKU: That was from a true story in Hokkaido. The character in real life, the one played by Hiroki Matsukata, was killed soon after our film was made. CD: There’s a scene where Matsukata’s enemies are buried up to their necks in the snow and then jeeps are aimed to run over their heads. Was that something that really happened? FUKASAKU: Oh, yes. That was from real events. CD: I’d like to ask an unrelated question, if you don’t mind, about Bunta Sugawara. He had started at Shintoho studios in the fifties and became a leading man there before the studio went bankrupt. But, after that, he had to start again from scratch, playing bit parts at Shochiku, then Toei, before finally becoming a leading man again around 1969. Did he feel any bitterness? Or did he tend to be more philosophical? FUKASAKU: Well, of course, as an actor he wanted to play bigger roles during that leaner period. I think he was frustrated. Even when he came to Toei there were other popular stars like Koji Tsuruta, and Ken Takakura. He had to wait a long time for his second break. His first starring roles in the Modern Yakuza series, and the film I directed, Street Mobster, that was the last in that series, were all low-budget films. CD: And what was it like working with Noboru Ando, who had been a yakuza in real life? FUKASAKU: He had gone to jail after that shooting incident. Then, when he got out, he disbanded his gang and became an actor fairly quickly.\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nCD: How big was his gang? FUKASAKU: The biggest they ever were? I think maybe around 500 members. They had control of a fairly large area in Tokyo for a while, the district known as Shibuya. CD: Junya Sato had done the film series with Ando, True Account Of The Ando Gang. How much of what was in the films really happened, do you know? FUKASAKU: They were based on his memoirs, and when yakuza write memoirs quite often they end up justifying their actions. I don’t believe that Ando was an exception to the rule. You could probably take about 50% of it as being real. However, I believe an exception to this were the articles written by Battles Without Honor’s original writer, Koichi Iiboshi. He had also been a yakuza and ended up becoming a reporter. I think his writing you could take 80%, maybe even 90%, of it as the truth. Many of the people from his writings were still alive when they were first published, so if there’d been fabrication involved it would have been exposed. CD: How was Ando to get along with? He seems a natural actor. FUKASAKU: In a way, I accept a lot of yakuza like that. They tend to be very fun people. Sarcastic, but a lot of fun. One habit that many of them have, though, is that they’ll never look into your eyes when you’re talking to them. CD: I’ve heard rumors that some of the head producers at Toei had originally come up from the ranks of the yakuza. Is that true? FUKASAKU: There was a very big producer there named Koji Shundo who had been in the yakuza. CD: How did real-life yakuza feel about your yakuza films? Especially about seeing yakuza portrayed in an unflattering way? FUKASAKU: There was the godfather of one gang who was portrayed in one of my films by Tetsuro Tanba. He wanted to check it out before it was released, so he set up a special screening at Toei. He came, sat there and watched the film. Afterwards he remarked that he was a little surprised that his subordinates, some of the men he’d brought with him, were so quiet during the film that they didn’t attempt any retaliation in response to what they were seeing on the screen. (laughs) That was a bit scary. CD: How do you feel about the yakuza genre? FUKASAKU: By the time I started making the more realistic yakuza films I’d already been a director for over ten years. I felt that with that approach, the more documentary style, I would finally be able to distinguish my films from those of other directors. I felt that strongly for the first time when I made Street Mobster. And from then on, especially with Graveyard Of Honor, I really like my work. CD: Do you think that there have been any good yakuza movies made during the 1990s? FUKASAKU: Maybe a few. One of the only great yakuza pictures made since the Battles Without Honor and Graveyard Of Honor films in the seventies is a\n\n23\n\n24\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\npicture from 1983 called Ryuji. It was directed by Toru Kawashima and written by the actor Shoji Kaneko, who played the main role. Sadly, he died of cancer shortly after the film was made. CD: What do you feel is the difference between Japanese and American or European gangster films? FUKASAKU: The thing that really makes a gangster film interesting, whether it’s a yakuza picture or a gangster movie from the West, is if an audience of ordinary people like you and me, non-gangsters, can somehow relate to the characters in the film. When you find a common human thread. There are two French crime films that I think are especially good in that way. One is Clouzot’s Quai Des Orfevres (1947), with Louis Jouvet, and another, Jacques Becker’s Touchez Pas Au Grisbi (1953), with Jean Gabin. In contrast, I think many American gangster films are presented more as entertainments. Flamboyant. The Godfather films – I think those films were researched and were realistically based. But, at the same time, they have a slightly different attitude, meant more to entertain. An exception would be Scorsese’s Goodfellas. CD: Mean Streets, too. Why do you think yakuza films were so popular in Japan during the 1960s? FUKASAKU: During the sixties and early seventies the students were rebelling against the status quo and government policies. There were incidents with The Red Army. But these sentiments weren’t only prevalent amongst the students. There was a kind of restless, rebellious energy bubbling under the surface with the general public. There were clashes between students and police on campuses and in other areas of the city. It was a time when students, the general public and women who worked in the water trade would go to late-night movie theaters to see the yakuza pictures. It was a kind of emotional release. CD: It’s ironic that the ninkyo yakuza pictures that were most popular in the sixties have almost left-wing sympathies, with a good gang or lone hero helping the working class, who are being exploited by evil gangs or the government. But in reality, during the early twentieth century, the original period of many of these movies, the real yakuza were usually right wing and frequently collaborating with repressive government forces. What do you think accounts for that discrepancy in the ninkyo films? Was it because there were many left-wing screenwriters turning out the scripts? Or were there actually some ‘chivalrous’ gangs? FUKASAKU: (laughs) There were a lot of leftist writers and directors, but also many in the general audience shared that leftist sentiment. The students and blue-collar workers who made up a good portion of the audience cheered that type of story. The creators of those films really enjoyed that kind of scenario and loved presenting it on the screen. CD: How did the more conservative yakuza respond to those films, the stories with the lone wolf hero or heroine fighting for the common man? Because I’ve gotten the impression that those films were also popular amongst yakuza.\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nFUKASAKU: They liked those movies because it made them look good. It was good for their image! CD: Do you think it could possibly have had any influence on real yakuza behavior? FUKASAKU: I don’t think so, because it was all relative in a way. Also, they would have ways of justifying whatever they did as right in the context of their group or for the welfare of their comrades. They responded more to the energy in the films. Ideas expressed of how noble it was to die for their beliefs and for the sake of their comrades. Right or left, it didn’t particularly matter. CD: What are some of your own favorite films? FUKASAKU: It’s difficult, because it’s very hard to compare the films that were well received with the movies that were well made but not well received. They’re all like children and all so different. Sometimes you love the children more that are a bit simple-minded. But of course you have affection for the others, too. So, out of the 50 or so films I’ve made, perhaps if I chose ten as the most loved. Then, again, maybe it would be better if you picked them. The next interview consists of excerpts from a long question-and-answer session Dennis Bartok and I had with Kinji in March, 2002, as a supplement for the American DVD releases of three of the films he directed at Shochiku studios: Black Rose Mansion, Blackmail Is My Life and If You Were Young – Rage. The interview took place in an empty conference room in Shochiku studios’ Tokyo office. Toshiko Adilman did the onsite translation. Ai Kennedy helped on some retranslation and clarification after editing. Dennis Bartok is signified as DB and I am signified as CD. DB: Were you surprised when the first film that you did with Akihiro Maruyama, Black Lizard, was such a success? FUKASAKU: Black Lizard was very popular and successful when it was released. Shochiku offered us the chance to do a second film, one that would also star Maruyama. Something that made its success even sweeter was that it was the first picture I had directed outside of Toei studios. CD: Black Lizard was adapted from a play by Yukio Mishima that he, in turn, had adapted from a story by famous Japanese mystery writer Edogawa Rampo. Was Mishima involved with Black Rose Mansion? FUKASAKU: Shochiku’s offer was to make a film with a similar theme to Black Lizard. Maruyama, of course, was a man playing a female role, and this new film was to be based on his Black Lizard character. But Black Rose wasn’t from any original story. We spent a lot of time discussing how to make the new picture. We tried to consult with Mishima, but he was busy leading his political group. So, he wasn’t directly involved. It was quite impossible for us to expect any meaningful input from him.\n\n25\n\n26\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nDB: Although Maruyama stars in both films, Black Rose Mansion is very different from Black Lizard, more melodramatic and melancholy. Why did Shochiku agree to do such a different kind of film? FUKASAKU: As a studio right then, Shochiku was undergoing dramatic changes, gradually transforming their traditional structure to the modern age of cinema. Nagisa Oshima, who had directed his first pictures there, had just left after creative disputes. They were making a lot of reforms, but they did not want to really abandon their tradition. They felt that, with Oshima having taken the creative lead for a while, the traditional roots of the studio had changed. They wanted to return to their traditional strengths and focus again on a melodrama. The president of Shochiku, Mr Kido, was a movie buff, and he loved Shochiku’s traditional films. So, we took his feelings into account in developing the story. And that’s how we went from Black Lizard to Black Rose Mansion. CD: There had been a long tradition of onnagata in kabuki theater and in the beginnings of Japanese silent film of men portraying women, but not much at all since the sound era began. What was the reaction of the men in the cast to having to play a romantic love interest with Maruyama? FUKASAKU: (smiles) Yes, there was quite a reaction. Films were set in the realistic sensibilities of the time, and so the actors wanted the role of the heroine to be played by a woman. There were difficulties, and then, too, Maruyama had people he wanted to work with that didn’t always pan out, either. CD: Though Black Rose Mansion is much bigger than life than Nikkatsu studios’ mood/action films, a lot of the imagery reminds me of their romantic film noir movies from the sixties. Pictures with Yujiro Ishihara and Ruriko Asaoka, like Sunset Hill (Yuhi No Oka, 1964), directed by Akinori Matsuo. What do you think of those films? Did they have any influence on Black Rose Mansion? FUKASAKU: Although I never made a film at Nikkatsu, I was a big fan of their movies with Yujiro Ishihara and Ruriko Asaoka. Even if I wasn’t consciously aware of it, I was definitely influenced by those films. Black Rose Mansion probably reflects this. Nikkatsu films were different from any kind of realism. They were trying a lot of different things. Another aspect that certainly had an impact on the romantic mood of both Black Lizard and Black Rose Mansion were the performers. The actor who played the hero detective, Akechi, in Black Lizard, Isao Kimura (who’s gone now), was originally a stage actor. He and Maruyama got along and worked well together. Similarly, the young actor Masakazu Tamura, who played Wataru in Black Rose Mansion – he’s still alive and active, and made a great team with Maruyama, too. I also must mention Eitaro Ozawa, who played Tamura’s father. He was originally a stage actor, too, and I’d been looking for an opportunity to work with him. The fact these actors interacted so well with Maruyama, and understood what we were trying to create, helped to create the proper mood for both pictures.\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nDB: Although you’re known predominantly for your yakuza films, you’ve also worked in many other genres. What is it in a story that attracts you as a filmmaker? FUKASAKU: Well, as far as Black Lizard, and especially Black Rose Mansion, I wanted to have lots of unique characters interacting. That was one of our intentions right from my initial discussions with the scriptwriter. I wanted to make them ensemble dramas. In my films that followed, including my yakuza films, I was also drawn to this multi-character approach. CD: You see an incredible amount of characters in many films from not just Toei but the other studios too all through the 1950s and 1960s. How much of that was predicated by the huge rosters of studio players on the payroll and how much stems from the dramatic structure of Japanese films? You see familiar faces in movie after movie, depending on the studio. FUKASAKU: There are two sides to that. In Japan, kabuki theater has a tradition of many characters on-stage, making for a lively and entertaining production. It is a long-standing tradition. The audience looks forward to a complicated web of relationships. Japanese audiences have been accustomed to this going back to the Edo period [nineteenth century]. So that’s where we get this showiness, this distinctive mood of kabuki. It’s something I’ve always been interested in and have tried to incorporate into my films, including my yakuza pictures. Shochiku, too, had its roots in kabuki. It was historically important to them. But, as you’ve said, as the number of actors on the payroll increases, the company tries to utilize these resources. All of the studios worked this way, whether at Toei with period dramas and yakuza films or at Shochiku, with melodramas. Even up to the mid-seventies, this was the kind of film the studios wanted to make and the audiences were eager to see. DB: How did Blackmail Is My Life come about? FUKASAKU: It took a long time to determine the approach on Black Rose Mansion. But Shochiku wanted another film right away and already had the rights to the Blackmail Is My Life story. It was an action film, they knew I was familiar with action filmmaking and they had already brought in Hiroki Matsukata, a young actor from Toei. It was an easier screenplay to coordinate than Black Rose Mansion. That’s why we made it beforehand. CD: Of all the films you did at Shochiku, Blackmail seems the most like a Toei film. Even still, there are differences. What was the approach Shochiku might have had towards yakuza action films, as opposed to Toei? FUKASAKU: Blackmail is about a group of young people who get into trouble by coincidence. It triggers them to start a blackmail business. Its themes involve the main characters’ relationships, the shady business negotiations, friendship and the love between a man and a woman. If you take a look at these themes, you can see that the film has more melodramatic elements than the usual Toei action picture. If I could’ve done it at Toei at the time, I wouldn’t have needed to do the same thing at Shochiku. Making this film, I wanted to employ the\n\n27\n\n28\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\ntheme of the friendships of youth. Another element of Toei filmmaking was having the main character or group beat the villains. It was a very common studio request to show this catharsis. The ambivalent main characters can be virtuous for the first time when they defeat evil. But, in Shochiku’s case, it was not necessary to beat the villain in an unrealistic ending. It didn’t matter if the movie concluded with the lead character’s failure as long as the protagonist’s life was completely penetrated. It was more important how vividly their lives were presented. Those were the differences between the two companies. Toei’s method of drama had to go one of two ways: the hero beats the villain, but he dies, too; or the hero’s actions bring about the villain’s defeat, and the cops catch him. Endings with a sense of emotional failure were impossible for Toei in the sixties. Even though my colleagues and I would try to make them see, the producers and company heads couldn’t appreciate our point of view. Gradually, that changed at Toei in the seventies. The Battles Without Honor And Humanity series happened. Those stories almost always end with the hero’s sense of frustration. You can see clearly in the resulting films those dramas that had my emotional involvement, the ones that I enjoyed making the most. DB: How much real corruption was going on in the Japanese political system during the sixties, as it was depicted in Blackmail Is My Life? Did you take any flak for showing blackmail and murder amongst politicians? FUKASAKU: The public began to be acutely aware of this corruption during the sixties. It led to Prime Minister Tanaka’s indictment. I think the awareness really started during that decade. I believe the audience liked the film because of its level of reality. CD: You’ve used several of the actors in the film before and since in your Toei pictures – Hiroki Matsukata, Tetsuro Tanba; can you tell us about them? FUKASAKU: This film was my first using Hiroki Matsukata. After this picture I became more closely aligned with Toei than Shochiku, and could work more easily on projects. I think the catalyst was Blackmail Is My Life. Many yakuza pictures of the time were set right after the turn of the century. Ninkyo yakuza, chivalrous heroes. However, I wanted to make Blackmail as a contemporary film. I wanted to make it realistic for myself. Hiroki Matsukata and Tetsuro Tanba had done many ninkyo yakuza pictures. But, whenever I worked with them, even when I worked with the biggest ninkyo stars like Koji Tsuruta and Ken Takakura, I purposely had their characters perform in a modern setting. I was much more perfectly in tune with a contemporary milieu. Hiroki Matsukata had a modern style and was a star who could really act. Toei sensed his importance, and so did audiences. This was a big influence on not only Bunta Sugawara’s debut, but many other young actors as well. DB: You’ve worked off and on in crime films from the beginning of your career. What attracts you to the genre, why do you think that you’re so good at making that type of film?\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nFUKASAKU: I started to take an interest in movies in 1945, when Japan was defeated in the war. Right then, we were able to see a variety of films, and I was influenced by them, especially American and European pictures. But I found myself surrounded by piles of charred rubble and black markets. I wanted to make films for the young people who were having to live, wounded and bleeding. I think that that’s the reason I was so into crime films. There were so many juvenile delinquents in the sixties. It really started even before that, in the fifties. I had a similar question when I made Battle Royale. ‘Why are you so interested in juvenile delinquents at your age? Why now?’ One of the reasons was that, when I was young, I was surrounded by many such incidents. At the time, I was not influenced by any of the happy-ending success stories from America. A boy living in the conditions I was in could not believe in them. That’s why I could make films based on emotional failure easier than success stories. I think it’s connected, why I started to like movies about crime. If I think about the kind of film I would like to make, it’s always a story about emotional failure, even if it’s a commercial movie. CD: Two of your earliest sixties yakuza pictures, High Noon For Gangsters and Wolves, Pigs and People, have that quality of emotional failure. Both films had gritty social issues, too. As you’ve said, that kind of downbeat crime film became easier to make\n\nBattle Royale\n\n29\n\n30\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nat Toei in the seventies. But, by the same token, movies like High Noon For Gangsters and Wolves, Pigs And People must have been difficult to make in the early sixties. FUKASAKU: Toei yakuza pictures back then, the main characters fulfill their frustrated emotions, and they end by defeating the enemy, with the consequences of death or incarceration from the police. It keeps a balance in society. It’s a very simple involvement of audience and film. And the audience can easily go along with the ending. However, what I wanted to do, what I still want to do, is based on a resistance to society. That feeling is my emotional spring. My desire is not only in defeating evil but how far desire can go. Even if desire doesn’t get that far and fails, as long as you stick with an emotion then the main character could be understood. I lived my youth that way. I think I follow the pattern of my own dramas. Companies like happy endings, but in real life, the villain doesn’t always get caught by the cops and doesn’t always die, either. However, the audience believes that that just doesn’t happen. If the audience thinks that, then the producers think it, too. There’s nothing I can do about it. Producers complained to me many times, ‘Why do your movies get so dark?’ However, if I ask them: ‘Do you think it’s okay for the main character to get this happy or unrealistic ending?’, even the producers cannot say yes. I understand the method of American movies, business-wise, with everything ending happily. Remembering back, American movies were reaching the whole world, and I feel that people have changed a lot. But, still, I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s impossible to have a happy ending today. This is the biggest problem facing mankind now, and I don’t have a solution for the future. DB: What was the origin of the story of If You Were Young – Rage? FUKASAKU: There was a production company called Shinseisha that had been trying to develop projects to encourage young people. When the TV series Young People (Wakamonotachi) was on, audiences made it popular and well rated. They asked me if I could make a film like the series. I guess they saw that my films already had this tendency towards youth and crime. The production company was trying to find a different direction, and I guess they wanted to show that side, too. CD: How would you describe the difference of the youth of today, for instance the youth of your film Battle Royale with the youth in If You Were Young? FUKASAKU: In If You Were Young, it was the producer’s request to give hope for the future. However, reality is too harsh. There was that sense already in If You Were Young. The main characters were struggling in different ways to escape from reality, in this instance to escape mass unemployment. However, they never do get out from under it. Finally, one of the friends in the group commits a crime. The crime drags them all down, and they get lost and stopped in their tracks. In Battle Royale, the situation goes much further, the kids are pushed to the edge in a crueller situation. It’s impossible to find hope in that kind of future. One of the themes of Battle Royale was that every human struggles in their own\n\nKINJI FUKASAKU\n\nway and tries to make a stand. The reason If You Were Young was less complex is not because the situation was different. It’s more that If You Were Young was from a generation when you could believe in other people. If you cannot believe in others, how can anyone benefit? So, people back then tried to rebuild trust, even though there was so much crime, and it was a pretty tough generation. You could see the effort of people trying to believe in others. Now, we can’t trust anyone. Kids can’t trust adults – not other students, not teachers. That’s the situation in Battle Royale. People used to try hard to reconnect, rebuild friendships. That’s the motif of If You Were Young. I think those are the differences. CD: In If You Were Young, I recognized Choichiro Kawarazaki from some sixties chanbara like Tai Kato’s Cruelty Of The Shogunate’s Downfall and other films at Toei. And Ryunosuke Minegishi (now known as Toru Minegishi), who was in a lot of Daiei’s delinquent and yakuza pictures. But what about the others? FUKASAKU: The cast members were all professionals. Some of them were from Bungakuza. They belonged to these drama troupes and studied acting. DB: You’ve received a tremendous amount of recognition in the last few years, what with the success of Battle Royale. You’ve had retrospectives take place around the world at such places as the Rotterdam Film Festival and The American Cinematheque in Los Angeles. The retrospective series toured many major cities of the United States. How do you feel about this recognition, and what are you planning next? FUKASAKU: I throw out the question ‘Can you find hope in the future?’ to young people with the film If You Were Young, and I do the same with Battle Royale. How the cast members take that question and perform and how the viewer accepts their performances, that’s what I’ve been seeing. It gives me a sense of satisfaction to receive that much feedback about a film I’ve made. Especially Battle Royale. I got tremendous feedback from England and France as well. People ask me, ‘What’s next?’ However, the situation has become difficult all of a sudden. There was an awful act of terrorism. How can I handle the terrorism problem myself? My frustrations, of all kinds, have been growing since the 1950s. And I have undergone all kinds of emotional failures towards that end. There is the Afghan problem now in this situation, and the terrorism problem, too. Is it possible to lead people towards an effective answer? And how can I present it to the viewer? I know that this is a very tough debate. Confusion – we have this moment, plus the difficult circumstances of filmmaking. Now the facts force us to face things. It’s not that different between Japanese audiences and others around the world. I don’t feel that I am in the spotlight. I’ll sum up the questions of the interview. All kinds of problems in the world keep getting bigger. I would like to truthfully answer how I feel. But I feel it’s a little too late for me, it’s a little too heavy at my age. Even though I’ve made assumptions of what you really wanted to ask me, I hope I can make a film next which would answer those questions. That is why I am fighting a hard battle now.\n\n31\n\n2 Eiichi Kudo 1929–2000\n\nMore than any other director I had the pleasure of meeting, including Kinji Fukasaku and Seijun Suzuki, the impression I retain of Mr Kudo is that of a sensei, a teacher. There was an aura of serenity and wisdom about him – an unpretentiousness and a delightful sense of humor as well as a sober side, an awareness of the good and bad in life unobstructed by illusions. It strikes me as ironic that Kudo was initially resistant to making jidai-geki films. Nervous about his inexperience in the genre, he had to be pushed into moving to Toei studios’ Kyoto branch, where period movies were made, by his then boss. Ironic in that Kudo turned out three of the most gruelling, relevant samurai pictures made in the sixties, films right up there with the best of such directors as Hideo Gosha, Kenji Misumi and Tai Kato. Toei’s jidai-geki from the fifties could vacillate between the sublime and the ridiculous, the scale tilting towards the latter, with worthwhile movies outnumbered five to one. But Kudo’s earliest chanbara, films like the Bloody Account Of Jirocho quartet, have hints of the virtues apparent in his later, more mature films. Despite being designed for indiscriminate action lovers, Kudo’s Jirocho films have an appreciably less sentimentalized, more straightforward approach than many of the other programmers churned out in profusion as the sixties began. Notwithstanding an occasional musical number, you could tell Kudo was intent on dispensing with the corn as much as possible. Still, it is amazing that Kudo was able to conjure up one of the all-time greatest samurai films, Thirteen Assassins, only three years later. A gritty look at the efforts of 13 men given the task by an official (Tetsuro Tanba) of assassinating the malevolent, out-of-control lord (Kantaro Suga) of the province, the ambience and attention to period detail is exemplary, the writing caustic, the performances nuanced. The men are led by an elder samurai (Chiezo Kataoka) possessed of a zen-like calm, and he’s evenly matched against the lord’s comparatively honorable,\n\n32\n\nEIICHI KUDO\n\njustifiably paranoid captain of the guards (a superb Ryohei Uchida). When the 13 men spring their elaborate trap for the lord’s cortege as it enters a small village on the river’s edge, the carnage erupts and proceeds unabated for the final half-hour of the film’s just over two-hour running time. Nearly everyone is slaughtered in the process, including Katoaka and Uchida. Castle Of Owls, a famous ninja tale just remade in the late nineties by Masahiro Shinoda, is not in quite the same scorched earth league, partly due to its lush color cinematography. However, it is another surprisingly intelligent, consistently involving saga full of authentic period flavor. Ryutaro Otomo is the lead ninja intent on eventually assassinating the shogun and overturning the government that has long suppressed his clan. He comes up against several formidable adversaries, amongst them a counter-insurgent samurai (Minoru Oki) and a seductive ladyin-waiting (Hizuru Takachiho) who is actually a ninja, too. To Otomo’s dismay, he falls in love with Takachiho, and before the film reaches its halfway point the female assassin is chagrined to find herself reciprocating his feelings. What could easily have come off as awkward and clumsy in lesser hands Kudo manages with ease, developing the love story by degrees in a credible fashion. In fact, Kudo’s direction is so good one doesn’t mind the comparatively unrealistic, upbeat ending. Shot in black and white, The Great Melee is the second of the three great samurai films I have alluded to, with an even more realistic, down-and-dirty approach than Thirteen Assassins. A reform activist (Kotaro Satomi) is pulled inexorably into the fray when an acquaintance being hunted by government troops hides in his house. Samurai police burst in, kill the man and attempt to arrest Satomi. Unfortunately, his wife runs into the street after him and is mercilessly cut down. Rescued by fellow activists who create a diversion, Satomi is sheltered by a good-natured, harddrinking, apolitical ronin (Mikijiro Hira). A wealthy opposition samurai (Toru Abe) begins to organize a disparate group, including Satomi, a female ninja, a sex-obsessed priest (Rinichi Yamamoto) and a samurai family man (Shiro Osaka), in an effort to assassinate the abusive lord. However, the cruel, arrogant lord (Kantaro Suga again) has a conscientious, high-ranking swordsman as his keeper (Ryutaro Otomo). Consequently, all the killers bite the dust before reaching their royal target. Previously apathetic ronin Hira, traumatized when he sees pal Satomi cut down, and shocked when he hears the lord’s resulting callous laughter, snaps, takes up his sword and finishes off the petty tyrant himself. As Kudo mentions in the following interview, the film was a stark allegory of the radical student movement in early sixties Japan, and the movie captures this feeling perfectly without sledgehammer juxtapositions or proselytizing. Kudo’s third loosely-linked chanbara gem was Eleven Samurai, in 1967, and it, too, is in black and white. A royal official (Kantaro Suga) from Edo on a rural stag hunt shoots an arrow into the back of a farmer too slow to get out of his way, then places another arrow in the eye of the local daimyo, who was riding in the area and\n\n33\n\n34\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\nprotested against the murder. The brutal, high-ranking Suga rides off with his samurai retainers as the other lord dies in the arms of his outraged men. The balance of the picture follows the wronged clan members, led by Isao Natsuyagi, as they attempt to find an opening to ambush and assassinate the tyrant. They’re joined by an unkempt, slightly unhinged ronin (Ko Nishimura) who is a master swordsman and ruthless killer. Once again, the evil lord’s loyal commander is played by Ryutaro Otomo, a man nearly taxed to the breaking point in trying to protect his shamefully inhuman superior. Yet again, the film’s last 20 minutes are taken up with unrelieved carnage as Natsuyagi’s men attack the lord’s procession on a country road. Blood mixes with mud in a fierce rainstorm, and Otomo and Natsuyagi skewer each other in combat after the lord is slain. Nishimura, the ronin, is the sole survivor, and gleefully lops off the dead tyrant’s head as souvenir. Although all three of these black-and-white jidai-geki were written by the same writer (Kaneo Ikegami), have very similar stories and even have the same actor – Kantaro Suga – playing nearly identical tyrants, each picture emerges as a distinct variation on a theme. Kudo brings a gravity, a fearfully intrinsic logic to the proceedings that never becomes leaden, and captures the feudal mindset of fanatical loyalty and pitiless vengeance with an unerring eye that has few equals. With that in mind, it is a pleasure to report that Kudo brought identical virtues to his handling of the yakuza genre. His two films in Noboru Ando’s vehicle, Japan’s Underworld History, are relentless, emotionally complex accounts of gangster life. Kudo expertly steers these early prototypical jitsuroku pictures, with Blood Feud the most remarkably fascinating in its depiction of a strange surrogate father-and-son relationship between a cop (Junzaburo Ban) and a veteran soldierturned-gang-boss (Noboru Ando). An insightful textbook case of one driven gangster’s morbid psychology. Industrial Spy is a clever, subtle look at class warfare in the guise of an industrial espionage thriller. Tatsuo Umemiya excels as the morally ruthless blackmailer and thief who is an expert at what he does. He’s ready to sacrifice all, including the love of his nightclub dancer girlfriend (Reiko Oshida), to gain acceptance in the lofty circle of back-stabbing businessmen. At the conclusion, he’s mortified to find that all the top captains of industry are the same. No matter how many times he’s raised their stock prices or saved their businesses by his underhanded tactics, no matter how good he is at his dirty job, to them he will always be nothing more than a second-class citizen. Up On Thirty Charges is a skilful, seamless integration of humor and action. Number seven of the Viper Brothers series, Bunta Sugawara and Tamio Kawaji return as the perpetual ex-cons – two amoral, soft-hearted bumpkins who idolize the yakuza idyll, yet end up sabotaged by their naiveté and blindness to the betraying ways of their gangster brethren. Of course, the murderous betrayals – in this case the slaying of their tomboy protegé (Michi Azuma) – never fail to result in their homicidally over-the-top payback assaults on bad guy headquarters.\n\nEIICHI KUDO\n\nAftermath Of Battles Without Honor And Humanity was the ninth and final film in the Battles series, and was the sole one not made by the original director, Kinji Fukasaku. Hiroki Matsukata is the only main star returning from previous installments with newcomers Jinpachi Nezu, Mieko Harada and Rudo Uzaki pumping new blood into the proceedings as up-and-coming gangbangers. Although a good idea to have Kudo at the helm, a man responsible for what might be termed jitsuroku samurai movies as well as several excellent yakuza sagas, the end result is somewhat uneven. Kudo elicits good performances from his young stars, but the writing is not quite up to the high standards of the previous Battles entries.\n\nPoster for Japan’s Underworld History – Blood Feud\n\n35\n\nOUTLAW MASTERS OF JAPANESE FILM\n\n36\n\nKudo finally got to make Beast Detective in 1982, a picture that had been put on hold in the late seventies while Toei studios had brought the Battles series to conclusion. Ken Ogata plays a maverick cop at odds with his superiors while trying to establish a relationship with his new love, a single mother. Kudo worked mostly in television in the eighties, most notably on the Sure Death (Hissatsu) series, and Beast Detective remains one of his best movies of that decade. Tale Of A Scarface is the story of a middle-aged gangster (Kiyoshi Nakajo) returning from prison who feels out of place back at home with his gang, a bunch now populated with brash"
