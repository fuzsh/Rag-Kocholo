        "text": "Description\n\n未来世紀ニシナリ\n\nNishinari, one of the neighborhoods in Osaka, had been labeled a slum or flophouse district for a long time, defined by the many flophouses, homeless persons, buraku (a discriminated community of descendants of outcast groups), and Korean-Japanese communities found there.\n\nNow a new strategy for changing the social system has begun in this area in south Osaka centered on redefining the concept of “all.” “All” should have dual meanings. One is “all the people living in Nishinari,” such as day laborers, new-comers, homeless, the disabled, and old widowers and widows. They have to be accepted as people who compose the community. The other meaning is “all things necessary for living in Nishinari,” such as housing, jobs, health, nursing care, and environment.\n\nFilmed over two years, this documentary captures the progress in this redefinition. In the film, up-and-coming entrepreneurs reinvigorate the area by starting recycling businesses, helping day-laborers to move out of flophouses and providing job opportunities to the homeless."
