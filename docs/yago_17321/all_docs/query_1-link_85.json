        "text": "Search Subway Serial Rape: Lover Hunting on Amazon.\n\nSubway Serial Rape: Lover Hunting (地下鉄連続レイプ 愛人狩り, Chikatetsu Renzoku Reipu: Aijin-Gari) is a 1988 Japanese pink film written and directed by Shūji Kataoka. It was named the Best Film at the first Pink Grand Prix ceremony.[2]\n\nSynopsis[edit]\n\nTomoko, a newscaster, decides to do a series of stories on rapes in subways. A gang which perpetrates these attacks targets the newscaster, and she is assaulted while broadcasting live.[3]\n\nCast[edit]\n\nKanako Kishi (岸加奈子) as Tomoko (newscaster)[4]\n\nMegumi Takahashi (高橋めぐみ)\n\nSayaka Hitomi (瞳さやか)\n\nSayaka Kimura (木村さやか)\n\nTsubasa Hayase (早瀬つばさ)\n\nShirō Shimomoto\n\nYukijirō Hotaru (螢雪次朗)\n\nRen Ōsugi (大杉漣)\n\nBackground[edit]\n\nShūji Kataoka filmed Subway Serial Rape: Lover Hunting for producer-director Kan Mukai's Shishi Productions and it was released theatrically in Japan by Nikkatsu on May 7, 1988.[1] It became available online through the Hokuto Corporation's DMM service on December 17, 2004.[5]\n\nKataoka's Subway Serial Rape series was inaugurated in 1985. The first film was intended as a single, but led to three loosely related sequels. Kataoka had worked as assistant director to Yōjirō Takita in his Molester's Train series. Unlike the light tone of Takita's films, Kataoka's Subway Serial Rape series is intentionally shocking and offensive. All the films in the series were released by Nikkatsu during the last years of its Roman porno series era. Subway Serial Rape: Lover Hunting was the fourth and last entry in the series, released in 1988, the year that Nikkatsu ceased production. In their Japanese Cinema Encyclopedia: The Sex Films, Thomas and Yuko Mihara Weisser write that these films may be \"the most perfect portrayal of voyeurism ever captured on celluloid\".[3]\n\nFollowing Nikkatsu's bankruptcy the year of the release of Subway Serial Rape: Lover Hunting, lead actress Kanako Kishi became one of the most prominent pink film actresses of the 1990s.[3] She is especially associated with the work of actor-director Kazuhiro Sano, appearing in several of his films.[6] Known for his supporting roles in such mainstream films as Takeshi Kitano's Sonatine (1993) and Hana-bi (1997), Ren Ōsugi had started his film career in the pink genre with Banmei Takahashi's Tightly Bound Sacrifice (1980). Subway Serial Rape was his last appearance in a pink film.[7]\n\nBibliography[edit]\n\nEnglish[edit]\n\nSubway Serial Rape: Lover Hunting (1988) on IMDb Search this movie on\n\n\"CHIKATETSU RENZOKU RAPE: AIJIN-GARI\".
