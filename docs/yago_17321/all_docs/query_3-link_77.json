        "text": "5 Communist Propaganda Films That Don’t Suck\n\nFor some odd, odd reason, I enjoy watching Communist Era Propaganda films. They aren’t very good, and most aren’t that enjoyable… yet I have this morbid fascination that compels me to see them. Perhaps it’s just the completionist in me that forces me to bear them, just for the sake of saying I’ve seen them.. but eh. Sometimes you just like what you like. Thankfully, I’ve discovered a few gems along the way that have made sitting through hours of some crappy movies worth it. Here are 5 that definitely don’t suck.\n\n1. Wan shui qian shan / The Long March\n\nDirector: Cheng Yin, Hua Chun\n\nYear: 1959\n\nCast: Lan Ma, Li Meng, Chen Huiliang, Huang Kai\n\nRating: 8\n\nSummary:\n\nOld Li is injured during one of the many confrontations between the Chinese and Japanese armies. Now, he and his company must trek through mountains, marshes, meadows and plains to reach their next engagement, but Old Li is having a difficult time making it through. The troop, loyal to their instructor and friend, do whatever it takes to help him make it.\n\nComments:\n\nAn excellent drama, probably one of the best propaganda films made during this period. Old Li is a great protagonist, nuanced and well crafted, which is really rare for movies from this period. It’s his character’s bravery, and the difficult journey he must make, that makes this one special. There are also a couple of nice war sequences at the beginning, but at its heart this one is more of a drama.\n\n——–\n\n2. Gao shan xia de hua huan / Wreaths at the Foot of the Mountain\n\nDirector: Xie Jin\n\nYear: 1985\n\nCast: Gai Ke, Guan Zhongxian, Lu Xiaohe, Ni Dahong, Sigin Gaowa, Tang Guoqiang, Wang Yumei\n\nRating: 8.1\n\nSummary:\n\nThe story of a troupe of soldiers during the Sino-Vietnam war of 1979.\n\nComments:\n\nThe summary doesn’t sound very great, but so much happens in the movie that it’s a little difficult to come up with a summary. You get camaraderie between soldiers, corruption in the army, training sequences, heroic leaders, repentful leaders, and lots and lots of tears. It’s more similar to modern war movies that focus on character and tragedy rather than war films from the 60s and 70s that wanted to show heroism, nationalism, and of course a win for the home side. Definitely one of the best war movies ever to come from China. It probably doesn’t count as a communist propaganda film but… I had nowhere else to put it. :p\n\n——–\n\n3. Yong bu xiao shi de dian bo / The Eternal Wave\n\nDirector: Wang Ping\n\nYear: 1958\n\nCast: Huang Wansu, Sun Daolin, Wang Gang-Xin, Xing Jitian, Yuan Xia\n\nRating: 6.5\n\nSummary:\n\nCommunist Party undercover agents operate in Shanghai in 1939 against the Japanese.\n\nComments:\n\nSpies! Okay, they are spies, but this is actually a bit more like a domestic drama between two spies of the communist army who act as husband and wife to try to stay under the radar. It focuses more on the difficulties in living that double life–and it’s not sexy or exciting like James Bond. There’s not a lot of action and there’s quite a bit of talking, but the movie is pretty solid especially compared to its contemporaries. The movie also stars Sun Daolin, one of the few actors from this period who I actually recognize (so I’ll just assume he was a big star during the day). This one has a modern remake, I think.\n\n——–\n\n4. Di lei zhan/ Warfare of Landmine\n\nDirector: Tang Yingqi, Xu Da, Wu Jianhai\n\nYear: 1962\n\nCast: Bai Dajun, Zhao Changrui, Wu Jianhai, Lu Zaiyun, Xu Fuchang\n\nRating: 6.2\n\nSummary:\n\nIt’s the Sino-Japanese War (as usual), and the Japanese army slowly takes control of Jiaodong county. With few soldiers and an overstretched line, the Chinese army decides to train the locals on the use of landmines! Yes, there will be a lot of explosions.\n\nComments:\n\nWell, this is just silly. But in a good way? After having scene hours upon hours of propaganda films, I’ve sort of conditioned myself into thinking that most of them are comedies. It doesn’t always work to make the movies better, but at the very least it makes them more enjoyable. Warfare of Landmine is a prime example of “So Silly It’s Awesome”, and while the movie isn’t necessarily BAD, I’d definitely not recommend it for the acting, plot or cinematography. But Landmines… landmines are always exciting when they blow up bad guys.\n\n——–\n\n5. Dongfang Hong / The East is Red\n\nDirector: Wang Ping\n\nYear: 1965\n\nCast:\n\nRating: 6.2\n\nSummary:\n\nThe history of the People’s Republic of China from the start of the 20th century up to the Cultural Revolution… but as a musical stage play! Yes, the movie is literally one song and dance number after another, shot as a play within a movie.\n\nComments:\n\nHonestly, I didn’t enjoy this that much, but I’m not a big fan of musicals. It’s a little absurd and of course full of communist propaganda, but it’s still an impressive production with nice scenes and pretty decent songs. This is by far the most unique propaganda film I’ve seen (seriously… a musical about communism), and it’s worth a watch if only because of that.\n\n——–\n\n5 Best Matsumoto Toshio Short Films\n\nMatsumoto is best known for the film Bara no souretsu / Funeral Parade of Roses, a movie about Tokyo’s hidden gay subculture during the 1960s. His other notable film, Shura / Pandemonium is also highly regarded, and I’d consider it even better than Bara no souretsu. He was a prominent figure in 60s and 70s Japanese experimental cinema, directing over 30 shorts during this time, and is now a professor and dean at the Kyoto University of Art and Design. This is a list of his 5 best shorts.\n\n1. Atman\n\nYear: 1975\n\nRuntime: 11 mins.\n\nSummary:\n\nA man in a Noh demon mask and costume is kneeling on a bed of rocks. The camera pans around him, zooms in, zooms out. The colors change, the images flash, still shots of him flow into each other.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– The dude in a Noh mask is freaky\n\n– There is a growing sense of anxiety and thrill even though nothing really happens\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Every shot, from every angle, looks fantastic\n\n– The sequence of still shots combined creates a wonderful effect\n\n——–\n\n2. Haha-tachi / 母たち / Mothers\n\nYear: 1967\n\nRuntime: 40 mins.\n\nSummary:\n\nShort segments about motherhood from 3 different cultures: the West, Asia, and Africa.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Simple structure of showing one culture after another is effective\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Frank and unsentimental look at motherhood\n\n——–\n\n3. Ishi no uta / 石の歌 / The Song of Stone\n\nYear: 1963\n\nRuntime: 25 mins.\n\nSummary:\n\nA documentary about stone and the miners who depend on it for their subsistence.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Camera movements while picturing photographs is interesting\n\n– Music reminiscent of Takemitsu’s score for Suna no onna\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Beautiful pictures of rocks and use of photographs\n\n——–\n\n4. Ki = Breathing\n\nYear: 1980\n\nRuntime: 30 mins.\n\nSummary:\n\nA kakejiku (Japanese hanging scroll) hangs in darkness and the camera enters its picture of trees and mist. There is a strange, eerie forest with a strange woman. More forests, mountains, a beach… and more bizarre images.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Thrilling, chilling, eerie… but in a good way?\n\n– More similar to Terayama Shuji’s work than Matsumoto’s own, standing out from the rest\n\n– Calm and stunning images, but kinda freaky\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Wonderful music by Takemitsu Toru as usual\n\n– Great use of sound\n\n——–\n\n5. Nishijin / 西陣 / The Weavers of Nishijin\n\nYear: 1962\n\nRuntime: 26 mins.\n\nSummary:\n\nA documentary about traditional weavers of Nishijin.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Very poignant narration\n\n– An interesting subject even though we don’t learn that much about them\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Weaving may never look this beautiful, probably Matsumoto’s best looking short\n\n——–\n\nOverall, his short films cover a diverse array of subjects each with their own unique visual style or concept. The above films are all worthy of seeing, even though you may not have any interest in experimental cinema (whatever the heck that is).\n\nYou can view them here.\n\nThat’s right, period films, but about yakuza. I wasn’t sure if there was a particular term for it, so yeah, I guess I’ll stick with that.\n\nKunisada Chuji / 国定忠治 / Chuji the Gambler (1960)\n\nDirector: Taniguchi Senkichi\n\nCast: Mifune Toshirô , Katô Daisuke, Aratama Michiyo, Natsuki Yosuke, Fujita Susumu, Tôno Eijirô, Tanba Tetsurô\n\nSummary:\n\nChuji the gambler comes home to find the village, and his family, deep in suffering because of corrupt official Jubei. Unable to take any more abuse, the villagers, along with Chuji, revolt against the magistrate to take back their village and get revenge for their suffering.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Mifune being Mifune, but there are times when he’s just too Mifune for the character\n\n– The script is by Shindô Kaneto, and the score by Satô Masaru, so you know it’s not your average movie\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Refuses to glorify the yakuza/gambler lifestyle and gives a very balanced portrayal of Chuji, often a do-no-wrong folkhero\n\n– Many of the scenes are at night, adding to the film’s darker tone\n\n—\n\nMatatabi sannin yakuza / 股旅三人やくざ / Three Yakuza (1965)\n\nDirector: Sawashima Tadashi\n\nCast: Nakadai Tatsuya, Matsukata Hiroki, Shimura Takashi, Nakamura Kinnosuke, Tanaka Kunie, Fuji Sumiko\n\nSummary:\n\n1 – Nakadai is Sentaro, a yakuza wanted for murder, who finds himself under the protection and employment of a local yakuza boss. He is tasked with protecting a young prostitute from being rescued by her lover. Sentaro’s kind heart and conscience, however, cause him to feel conflicted.\n\n2 – Genta (Matsukata) and Bunzo (Shimura) meet outside a gambling den. Genta helps Bunzo escape after getting caught cheating at the tables. They eventually find themselves in a small house occupied by Omiyo (Fuji), where the past is revealed.\n\n3 – Nakamura is Kaze-no-Kyutaro, a seemingly world-weary, badass yakuza, who is hired by a small village to protect them from an evil government official taxing the town into the ground. This yakuza, however, isn’t the kind of person he says he is.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Yakuza action!\n\n– Nakamura is hilarious in this one, one of his least “cool” characters\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Three yakuza stories, three great leading men\n\n– Three different characters that could have had an entire movie made for them\n\n– Probably Sawashima Tadashi’s best film?\n\n—\n\nHitori okami / 一人狼 / Lone Wolf Isazo (1968)\n\nDirector: Ikehiro Kazuo\n\nCast: Ichikawa Raizô, Ogawa Mayumi, Iwasaki Kaneko, Nagato Isamu\n\nSummary:\n\nIsazo is a famous yakuza man traveling around as usual (he even gets an intro song). One day he meets a boy whose mother is revealed to be Isazo’s old lover. His once carefree and guiltless life suddenly changes as he finally decides to right some wrongs and follow the Yakuza code.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Interesting yakuza > samurai message\n\n– Isazo is a pretty down-to-earth Yakuza, surprisingly!\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Hard to imagine anyone but Raizô playing this role\n\n– Great heroic climax\n\n—\n\nKogarashi Monjiro / 木枯し悶次郎 / The Withered Tree (1972)\n\nDirector: Nakajima Sadao\n\nCast: Sugawara Bunta, Ibuki Goro, Watase Tsunehiko, Yamamoto Rinichi, Koike Asao, Enani Kyoko, Sasazawa Saho\n\nSummary:\n\nKogarashi Monjiro is framed for a crime he did not commit, and is sent into exile on a deserted island along with other criminals. He spends his days pining for revenge, until one day, a chance to escape arrives. He takes it, along with a few of his fellow criminals, and returns to the mainland. There is only one thing on his mind: revenge.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Kinda reminds me of Mikogami no Jokichi, but Sugawara Bunta is way more badass than Harada Yoshio\n\n– The exiled part of the story could have been more interesting\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– I like Sugawara’s sword style–simple, believable, and effective\n\n– Sugawara Bunta as a yakuza is awesome, and you should already be aware of this by now\n\n—\n\nMushuku mono / 無宿者 / Drifting Crow (1964)\n\nDirector: Misumi Kenji\n\nCast: Ichikawa Raizô, Ishiyama Kenjiro, Abe Tôru, Taki Eiko, Tsubouchi Mikiko, Sawamura Sonosuke, Mizuhara Koichi, Taki Keiichi, Fujimaki Jun\n\nSummary:\n\nIpponmatsu goes on a journey to find his father’s killer. On the way he meets Kuroki, a samurai on a similar journey to find his father who disappeared 5 years ago after escorting a caravan that was robbed of 4,000 ryo. Ipponmatsu suspects Kuroki’s father of being his own father’s killer, but now they must work together to reveal the plot behind boss Sanshu-ya, the mysterious Shima-ya, and the even more mysterious person behind them.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Good murder mystery and plot twist\n\n– Misumi Kenji knows how to shoot action sequences (if you don’t know this already!), so you know this will be a treat\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– The relationship between Ipponmatsu and Kuroki is fairly complex and nuanced\n\n– Fights in the village are awesome\n\nSame concept, slightly different genre!\n\nJushichinin no ninja / 十七人の忍者 / Seventeen Ninja (1963)\n\nDirector: Hasegawa Yasuto\n\nCast: Kotaro Satomi, Otomo Ryutaro, Konoe Jushiro, Azuma Chiyonosuke, Matsukata Hiroki\n\nSummary:\n\nA band of ninja led by Jingoza (Otomo), must steal a scroll detailing Tokugawa Tadanaga’s plot to take the throne. However, they must deal with ninja master Saiga Magokuro (Konoe), who must protect the scroll, and Tadanaga, at all costs.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– 17 + 1 ninja. The more ninjas the better?\n\n– A bunch of cool ninja moves and gadgets, though not as many as the Shinobi no mono series\n\n– Azuma plays a Tokugawa once again. I wonder why.\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Otomo, Kotaro, Konoe. That’s a pretty cool lineup.\n\n– Revisionist history / hypothetical possible history movies are always interesting\n\n—\n\nNinjutsu gozen-jiai / 忍術御前試合 / Torawakamaru (1957)\n\nDirector: Sawashima Tadashi\n\nCast: Arima Koji, Fushimi Sentaro, Hori Masao, Ôkôchi Denjirô, Tsukigata Ryonosuke\n\nSummary:\n\nNinja clans fight with each other. Yes, that’s about it. By the way, this is a kiddie film.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Magic? I guess some people like that\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Some nice swordfights and creative ideas, that will later be realized in the sort of the same but not quite the same (actually I’ve no idea why I’m making this comparison other than the presence of a giant frog and snakedragonthing) movie, Kairyu daikessen\n\n– You don’t need a brain or an attention span to enjoy this film yay!\n\n—\n\nNinja hicho fukuro no shiro / 忍者秘著梟の城 / Castle of Owls (1963)\n\nDirector: Kudo Eiichi\n\nCast: Otomo Ryutaro, Ohki Minoru, Kawarazaki Choichiro, Takichiho Hizaru, Mishima Masao\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Iga ninjas are a dying breed as Toyotomi’s rule allows Japan to experience some peace. Juzo, an Iga ninja who had vowed revenge for the death of his family, is hired by a rich weapons merchant to assassinate Toyotomi, restarting his quest for blood. In his way are rival ninja, and his once best friend who has decided to become a government vassal.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Lots of ninja action, with jumps, tumbling and lots of thrown sharpthingies\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Kudo is known for having very well shot movies, and this is no exception\n\n– Great use of depth of field in forests\n\n– Distanced shots of fights\n\n– That low angle with the candles in the temple–you’ll see\n\n—\n\nNinja gari / 忍者狩り / Ninja Hunt (1964)\n\nDirector: Yamauchi Tetsuya\n\nCast: Konoe Jushiro, Yamashiro Shingo, Sato Kei, Tamura Takahiro\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Gamo clan hire Wadakura, Shinzo, Hachi and Yajiro to protect their clan from the Koga ninja and their Shogunate masters. As the Gamo clan daimyo nears death, the Shogunate sends a letter to allow a legitimate heir to succeed him. The shogunate, however, also sends their ninjas to destroy the proclamation to allow them to abolish the clan. The four ninja hunters, who once belonged to clans that suffered similar fates, will stop at nothing to get revenge on the Koga and their leader, Yami-no-Kurando.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Konoe is so evil even as the protagonist\n\n– Interesting and realistic (that is, not overly cool) final battle\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Quite a bit of blood and brutality\n\n– Cheezy synthy soundtrack surprisingly works!\n\n– Lots of plots and counterplots\n\n—\n\nYoja no maden / 妖蛇の魔殿 / Ninja’s Weapon (1956)\n\nDirector: Matsuda Sadatsugu\n\nCast: Kataoka Chiezo, Tsukigata Ryonosuke, Yamagata Isao, Hasegawa Yumiko\n\nSummary:\n\nOgata Taromaru’s family is slain by the corrupt and evil Sarashina Danjo. For 10 years he trains to become a ninja, and finally sets out to extract his revenge on those that have harmed his family. On the way, he meets a youth named Tsukikage Hamanosuke, who also bears a grudge against Danjo. On their travel together they also meet Orochimaru, a mysterious ninja who seems interested in their affairs. They head for Kyoto, where Danjo now resides, to get revenge.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Matsuda Sadatsugu is a reliable name for chambara and action movies\n\n– Straight up action film unencumbered by a complicated plot\n\n– Fights are more samurai than ninja\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– A somewhat (I stress somewhat) youthful Kataoka Chiezo playing a 22 year old is HILARIOUS\n\n– Possibly one of Yamagata Isao’s most hilarious death faces (he dies a lot you know)\n\nAnd I’m back with a new installment of this uninformative, yet space filling series!\n\nKisaragi musô ken / きさらぎ無双剣 / Kisaragi Sword (1962)\n\nDirector: Sasaki Yasushi\n\nCast: Ichikawa Utaemon, Kotaro Satomi, Matsukata Hiroki, Wakayama Tomisaburo, Konoe Jushiro, Azuma Chiyonosuke, Yamagata Isao, Arima Koji, Hori Masao\n\nSummary:\n\nRindo Tsukinosuke is a secret agent of mysterious origin. Sakon Takada is a booze loving Hatamoto. Itsuzume-kozo is a sneaky yakuza-ninja-hybrid who has just gotten out of jail. Hayatomasa Tachibana is a nice-guy samurai fencing master. These four dudes work together to crack a plot to overthrow the shogun.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– An eventful story, unique enough not to be redundant\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Holy crap that’s one crazy lineup!\n\n– Mister Utaemon being all Ichikawa Utaemon on everyone\n\n– A great controlled final fight scene with the top 5 stars in it\n\n—\n\nShokin kasegi / 賞金稼ぎ / Killer’s Mission (1969)\n\nDirector: Ozawa Shigehiro\n\nCast: Wakayama Tomisaburo, Kataoka Chiezo, Tsuruta Koji, Amatsu Bin\n\nSummary:\n\nIchiro (Wakayama) is a Tokugawa spy sent to Satsuma to foil the clan’s plot to start a war and overthrow the Shogunate. The Satsuma are trying to smuggle in new guns that would give them an advantage in battle, but Ichiro, probably the James Bond of his day, is up to the task.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Wakayama parodies Zatoichi (played by his brother, Katsu Shintaro) in a couple of scenes\n\n– A little bit of history in this one, although.. uhh.. not much unless you feel like researching\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Wakayama in his chubby days with a noticeable and distinctive mustache!\n\n– Lots of people getting chopped to bits\n\n—\n\nAdauchi / 仇討 / Revenge (1964)\n\nDirector: Imai Tadashi\n\nCast: Nakamura Kinnosuke, Tamba Tetsurô, Mishima Masao, Shindô Eitarô\n\nSummary:\n\nEzaki Shinpei is a lowly samurai retainer involved in the maintenance of the clan’s gear. One day, Magodayu, a government inspector, insults the cleanliness of the clan’s spears, and Ezaki rebukes him, earning his ire. Magodayu challenges him to a duel, and Ezaki duly dispatches of the inspector. Unfortunately, Ezaki’s low status betrays him.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Lots of leftist criticism about the government and tradition if you’re into that sort of thing\n\n– Nakamura tries to be all Nakadai-ish\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– The focus on brotherhood and inheritance is a unique angle\n\n– Great wiiiiiide picture\n\n—\n\nTengu-to / 天狗党 / Blood End (1969)\n\nDirector: Yamamoto Satsuo\n\nCast: Nakadai Tatsuya, Wakao Ayako, Kato Go, Nakamura Kanemon,\n\nSummary:\n\nSmall-time farmer Sentaro learns how to use a sword and joins the Mito tengu group. It doesn’t take long, however, for Sentaro to become disillusioned with the Mito tengu and their increasingly political nature. Politics sucks, and the ideologies that back them are even worse, he soon discovers.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Imperialist/revolutionary ideological dichotomy explored more than in other films\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Probably one of the most politically focused jidaigeki I’ve seen\n\n– Political soliloquys?! Yeah really. And a lot of them. Only great if you like that stuff, I guess!\n\n—\n\nObozu tengu / お坊主天狗 / Demon Priest (1962)\n\nDirector: Yasushi Sasaki\n\nCast: Kataoka Chiezo, Okawa Hashizo, Otomo Ryutaro, Misora Hibari, Yamagata Isao, Mishima Masao, Shindô Eitarô\n\nSummary:\n\nOkay, honestly I don’t remember what happened in this movie. All I remember is Kichisaburo (Kataoka) wants revenge against Honda (Mishima), Kosome (Misora) wants revenge on Tokaiya (Shindô), and Shinzaburo (Okawa) is an eccentric sword expert. The title honestly doesn’t make sense, too.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\n\n– Misora Hibari as a girl for a change\n\n– Lots of revengings to go around\n\nThe Best Stuff:\n\n– Okawa Hashizo as an eccentric sword expert is hilarious for some reason\n\n– Kataoka Chiezo is always, always a character you cheer for"
