        "text": "Japanese movies (日本映画, Nihon Eiga?, lit. Japanese Movies) are movies that are funded (produced) by a person with Japanese nationality or a corporation based on Japanese domestic law , on the assumption that they will be released in movie theaters in Japan in general. Although it points, the detailed definition differs depending on the expert. It is also called a Japanese Film and Eiga . It is also called activity photography , kinema , cinema, etc. depending on the times .\n\nThe kinetoscope , invented by Thomas Edison in 1891, was the origin of the world-famous film, but it was first screened in Japan in November 1896 , at the forefront of Western technology at the time. This is the year when the movie arrived. The cinematography by Japanese 1898 of Shiro Asano begin in a short film by the \"garbled Jizo\", \"dead of resuscitation.\" From here to the present day, Japanese films have been strongly influenced by Japanese culture, have achieved their own development, and have been positioned as one of Japan's leading popular entertainment.\n\nJapanese film genre to be clearly defined as it is difficult, \" Japanese supervision by, Japanese actor and according to the Japan shooting and, in Japan screened for Japanese under the condition that movie\", the Those for which some are true are commonly referred to as Japanese films . For this reason, \" Honokaa Boy total overseas, such as\" location of and movies, France of the capital on the basis of the Akira Kurosawa and Nagisa Oshima movie was shot, Yoichi Choi , Lee Sang-il , such as Korean residents in Japan by the Director, such as a movie, Some are recognized as Japanese movies even if they do not meet all the conditions.\n\nThere is a name for foreign films ( Western films ) in the sense of Japanese films , but in today's world where multinationalization is common in terms of both production and distribution , such as the borderless market , the strict definition as a genre is almost the same. It's becoming meaningless.\n\nBackground\n\nNaturally, the influence of Japanese culture exists in the background of Japanese movies becoming Japanese movies. When movies arrived in Japan, Japan boasted a high literacy rate , which is rare in the world, and all kinds of books such as popular reading materials, newspapers , and children's books were familiar to the common people. In addition, the influence of traditional plays such as Kabuki and Ningyo Joruri, which have a much longer history than movies, on Japanese movies is immeasurable. This can be seen from the fact that movie theaters are still called theaters today.\n\nAlso, in the early silent film era, there was a film explainer called Benshi at the time of screening, but the system of enjoying the sound separated from the image and the sophisticated narrative technique called Kuchidance are already available. It is said that it has been established in theaters such as, and has been easily accepted by Japanese people and has achieved its own development. For the common people, who acts as a benshi is also an important criterion for watching a movie, and movies played by a flower-shaped benshi have become popular as a whole. Silent movies refer to movies with only voiceless images, but it can be said that there was no true silent movie in Japanese movies .\n\nWhile trying to sublimate Japanese culture into movies and give it a Japanese-style feel, many Japanese movies have been born in which foreign cultures and materials are chewed and mixed in a Japanese style. Jacques Feyder \"of Mimosa Hall from\" idea The resulting Sadao Yamanaka \"of Humanity and Paper Balloons \" and William Shakespeare of \" King Lear is\" \"Akira Kurosawa of which is the original turbulent such as\" falls on it...\n\nHistory\n\nSilent era\n\nThe first movie screening in Japan began in November 1896 at the Shinko Club in Kobe by Shinji Takahashi , a gun merchant . This is due to Thomas Edison 's kinetoscope . Lumiere brothers of cinematograph screen screening by the 1897 to January Katsutaro Inabata by Kyoto Electric Light at the time of the head office of the Corporation (the current original-TatsuMakoto elementary school was conducted for the first time in the courtyard of the site of). Subsequently , in February 1897, the first \"paid screening\" was held in Osaka by Katsutaro Inabata. In March of the same year it was to improve the Kinetoscope in Tokyo Vai data scope is published, gained popularity. Junichiro Tanizaki described in his book \"Childhood\" that \"the same scene can be projected over and over again by connecting both ends of a volume of film.\"\n\nAfter that , several short films were made by Shiro Asano , and in 1898, the first film was made in Japan.\n\nIn 1898, the previously mentioned \"Ghost Jizo\" and \"Revival of the Dead\" were released, and in 1899, \"Geisha's Hand Dance\" (Tokyo Kabukiza ) was released. This is (Konishiroku photographic industry after, the current Konishi head office Konica Minolta ) of Shiro Asano Gaumont Shiba at manufactured by shooting machine colored leaves museum and live-action taken by, Yoshihiro Komada led by \" Japan taking the initiative activities photo session by\" It was open to the public. The same year the Volume 1 70 feet of Japan's first feature film in the \" pistol robbery Sadakichi Shimizu \" is photographed by Yoshihiro Komada, as Japan's first movie actor new school of Unpei Yokoyama has been appointed. Unlike the Shinpa, who actively tried to come into contact with the movie, Kabuki and others despised the movie as a \"mud play\" and hesitated to provide the original work and actors . The oldest surviving Japanese movie is Momijigari, which was shot by Tsunekichi Shibata in the same year .\n\n1903 The shop Yoshizawa is Asakusa first to become movie professional museum \"in Japan in the electrical Hall was installed.\" The next 1904 years to the Russo-Japanese war and the outbreak dispatched a live-action shooting team in the local mainland China, screened the video as a documentary film, gained popularity.\n\n\" Honnoji Battle \" released in 1908 was the first full-scale feature film, and Shozo Makino, who shot this film at the request of Yokota Shokai , has left his name as Japan's first film director. Makino, who owned a Joruri hut in Kyoto and was active as a Kyogen artist, memorized the Joruri used in the original work in the sky, so it is said that he shot without using a script. The following year, \"Tadanobu Goban\" starring Kabuki actor Matsunosuke Onoe became a big hit, and Japan's first star was born as \" Matsunosuke Onoe \". Since then, Onoe has starred in over a thousand movies in his 14-year career as an actor. Among them, \" Chushingura \" , which was shot in 1910, continued to be popular among the common people as an indispensable subject in subsequent Japanese films, following Joruri and Kabuki. Later, Makino was praised for his achievements and was given the title of Griffith Makino by American film director D.W. Griffith .\n\nIn 1912, four movie companies , Yokota Shokai, Yoshizawa Shoten, M. Pathe Shokai, and Fukuhodo , jointly formed a trust and established Nikkatsu , abbreviated as Nikkatsu . Nikkatsu became Japan's first full-scale movie company, which set it apart from the conventional small-scale production of cottage industries. Tokyo Mukojima of Mukojima studio , Kyoto Nijo Castle in the west Yagurashita Kansai studio provided the two places of the studio, and in Tokyo new school (the modern drama of later), in the Kyoto classical drama (after the era drama was manufactured).\n\nMany of the films so far have only reproduced theatrical productions, and it was not until the late 1910s that unique techniques were tried as films. Masao Inoue 's 1917 \" Captain's Daughter \" introduces techniques such as close-ups , movement techniques , and cutbacks . Around this time, the name gradually changed from \"activity photography\" to \"movie\", and by around 1922, the word \"movie\" had become deeply ingrained in the general public.\n\nOn the other hand in the movie critic, Yoshizawa Shoten 1909 but such first movie magazine \"activities photography world\", which was announced in is already there, 1917 to norimasa kaeriyama theory entitled is a \"creative and radiography of activities photos drama\" In 1918, the publication of the book led to the \" Pure Film Movement,\" a movement to modernize Japanese films . In the same book, Kiyama, who presided over the Film Arts Association , explained that movies should not be imitations of theater, and named the stage script as a scenario, the onnagata as an actress, and the benshi as subtitles. His works include \" The Glow of Life \" using Japan's first actress Harumi Hanayagi , and \" Phantom Woman \", which shot Japan's first female nude scene .\n\nBehind this is the end of World War I and the gradual expansion of Hollywood movie companies into Japan. In line with these movements, movie companies such as Kokusei and Daikatsu were established one after another, and in 1920 Shochiku, whose main business was Kabuki , established the Shochiku Kinema Partnership Company and embarked on production. In particular, Shochiku is built actor training school in Hollywood's star system adopted, \" the soul of the streets of the\" English Yuriko or \" field poppy of\" Sumiko Kurishima such, has produced a large number of the actress. In addition, the influence of Henry Kotani , an active Hollywood cameraman called by Shochiku, is also significant. He reflex plate episodes that were taken brilliant using is, from Japan stage that it simply mirrors the movie, as a commodity proceed one step, was intended to symbolize the new art, the way of the movie as the media.\n\nThis Pure Film Movement was caused by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, which destroyed all the studios in Tokyo that were producing contemporary films, and only filmed in Kyoto, the center of the old drama. It was a sudden end. In 1926, Shochiku's contemporary drama began in earnest, and urban styles such as Kiyohiko Ushihara 's \"He and Tokyo\" (1928) and \"King of the Land\" (1928) portray ordinary ordinary people in life size. A modern drama has emerged. There are also pastoral and lyrical works set in the countryside, such as \"The Village Bride\" (1928) and \" Izu no Odoko \" (1933) by Heinosuke Gosho . Ernst Lubitsch received a strong influence on Yasujiro Ozu is, \" but the University went out \" (1929), \"but failure is the\" (1930) a lot of work packed with the view of life as the hero of the common people, such as left.\n\nNikkatsu, who was behind the movement of Shochiku, finally made the transition from a female figure to an actress after the closure of the Mukojima studio due to the 1923 earthquake. The following year, the \" Nikkatsu Tahata Photo Studio \" (later Daiei Kyoto Studio ) will be opened in Tahata Village , a suburb of Kyoto . Kenji Mizoguchi, who is also regarded as the representative of Nikkatsu contemporary drama, makes full use of the shooting techniques learned in Hollywood, \" Kiri no Minato \" (1923), \" Blood and Spirit \" (1923), \"The Passion of a Woman \" (1926). ), And laid the foundation for various genres.\n\nOn the other hand, activity photo censorship by the Ministry of Home Affairs Bureau was also carried out, and the work of Teinosuke Kinugasa 's \" Nichiwa \" (1925), etc. was forced to be extensively edited due to the intervention of the authorities, and was released after being revised. , There are many works that have failed in the box office due to the influence of censorship. However, Kinugasa also continue to vigorously activity then, the first avant-garde film to become \"Japan KyoTsuta one page \" (1926) and received a high reputation in Europe \" crossroads \" (1928), such as, \"pure movie The purpose and goal of the \"Drama Movement\" have been achieved.\n\nIf you turn your attention to the historical drama, the 1,000-piece commemorative work \"Araki Mataemon\" (1925) starring Onoe will be taken up, but it is more speedy from the traditional style of sword-fighting and sword fighting. A fierce sword fight was required. Bando Tsumasaburo, who quickly established this style, gained popularity in \" Orochi \" (1925). In addition, many new historical dramas such as \" Tange Sazen \" by Denjiro Okochi , \" Hatamoto Taikutsuo \" by Utaemon Ichikawa, and \"Kurama Tengu\" by Kanjuro Arashi have appeared.\n\nGolden Age before the war\n\nAttempts to add audio to the video were made almost at the same time as the movie was introduced, and Kenichi Kawaura conducted a talkie experiment in 1902 by synchronizing the rotation of the record with the rotation of the film . It was Mina Torquay by Showa Kinema in 1927 that these attempts came into the commercial limelight . This is due to Yoshizo Minagawa, who purchased the rights to talkie technology from Lee de Forest in the United States .\n\nKaoru Osanai 's \"Dawn\" using Mina Torquay was not released due to technical problems, and Japan's first Torquay movie was \"The Captain's Daughter \" in 1929 . In the same year, another method is the Mina-talkie, Tojo Masao was research and try to adopt the East von Torquay, after all, own the disc type Torquay in Makino Masahiro was director \" Modohashi \" has been published .. Eastphone did not generally penetrate. After that, Kenji Mizoguchi's \" Furusato \" (1930) continued, but the so-called part-talkie format that used both subtitles and audio was common, and Heinosuke Gosho first appeared as a complete talkie movie. It was \" Madame and his wife \" (1931).\n\nLarge, well-capitalized companies actively transitioned from silent films to talkie films during this period, with some exceptions , such as Yasujiro Ozu , skeptical of talkies . A complete transition was achieved in 1935, but financially difficult independent productions continued to make silent films until around 1938. As a result, small studios are being absorbed by major movie companies one after another.\n\nIn addition, Benshi, who survived as a commentary translation for overseas films even after the silent film era ended , became unnecessary with the advent of the subtitle superimpose , which was first adopted in 1931 in \" Morocco .\" Benshi, who tried to protect his vested interests, went out to obstruct the invasion of Torquay, but it was no longer possible to go against the times, and his existence was forgotten.\n\nThe emergence of these talkies has led to the emergence of new actors and the establishment of new genres. People who live in narrative arts such as rakugo and vocal cord copying have begun to appear on the screen, and comedy actors such as Kenichi Enomoto and Roppa Furukawa have emerged. In addition, movies such as \" Aizen Katsura \" that have gained popularity through the popularity of theme songs have also appeared.\n\nThe advent of talkie films has led to the phenomenon of prolonged shooting periods. With this as a trigger, Nikkatsu moved and expanded its studios to the Tama River in 1934 and Shochiku to Ofuna in 1936 . As a characteristic of each, Nikkatsu was good at a heavy and muddy style, and Shochiku was good at a sophisticated urban style. Representative directors of Nikkatsu include Tomu Uchida in \" Theatre of Life: Youth \" (1936), \" Sat \" (1939) , \" Thank You \" (1937), and Hisatora Kumagai in \" Abe Clan \" (1938). , as the director representing the Shochiku \" Yae-chan next to the\" (1934) Yasujiro Shimazu , \" Katsura Aizen \" (1938), \" only son \" (1936) of Hiromasa Nomura , \" There Gata's \" (1936), Hiroshi Shimizu of \"A Star Athlete \" (1937), etc. Kenji Mizoguchi, who questioned this series of styles, wrote \"Osaka Elegy\" (1936) and \" Sisters of the Gion \".(1936) and other dialect-based works, breaking down the existing concept of \"movies must be Tokyo dialect.\" Founded in 1930, PCL has announced its entry into the filmmaking industry since 1933. Akira Kurosawa and Ishirō Honda , Shuzo Takiguchi , Ibuka large such as, attracted a large number of staff, became the first producer-system adopted by the company in Japan. Early on, Sotoji Kimura 's \" Kawamukou no Seishun \" (1933), \" Ani Imoto \" (1936), and Mikio Naruse 's \" Wife, Be Like a Rose \" (1935), who had transferred from Shochiku . Tamizo Ishida 's \"Flower Have Fallen\" (1938) became popular. In particular, Naruse's \"Wife! Be Like a Rose\" has expanded overseas and became the first Japanese movie to be released to the public in New York. Initially, PCL from that did not own the distribution Museum, but was forced to box office of struggle, 1937 , Kazumi Kobayashi \"photo Institute for Chemical Research,\" by the action, such as, Kyoto of Osawa Shokai in the movie studio A certain \" JO studio \", HankyuBy merging with the capital distribution company \" Toho Film Distribution \", etc., Toho Film resolved the difficulty of distribution and became a major movie company following Nikkatsu and Shochiku.\n\nIn 1937, a national film was produced between Japan and Nazi Germany at the time. Good and the Germany of the mountain movie Arnold funk and Mansaku Itami was made in the co-director of \" The Daughter of the Samurai is\". Setsuko Hara, who played the typical Japanese woman Mitsuko Yamato as the leading actress, was praised for her appearance and performance, and although she failed in the box office performance in Japan, she became an indispensable actress in Japanese movies during the war. became.\n\nSecond Golden Age\n\nWhen the San Francisco Peace Treaty was signed in 1951, GHQ film censorship would be abolished the following year. As a result, the historical drama that had been banned from screening was revived, and a large number of movies were produced. Japanese film works such as Akira Kurosawa and Kenji Mizoguchi won awards one after another at the International Film Festival, and worked to restore Japan's cultural pride. In 1958, the movie population exceeded 1.1 billion, and the movie became an immovable hall of fame for entertainment, and the second golden age in the movie industry came.\n\nWar movies restricted by GHQ began to be produced, Hideo Sekigawa 's \" Kike, Wadatsumi no Koe \" (1950), Tadashi Imai's \" Himeyuri no Tou \" (1953), and Keisuke Kinoshita 's \" Twenty-Four Eyes\". (1954), Kon Ichikawa 's \"The Burmese Harp \" (1956), and other works aimed at the tragic and sentimental retrospective of the war experience, rather than the works that regarded war as a simple evil, appeared one after another. It became a social impact. In addition, nostalgic films such as \" Battleship Yamato \" (1953) and \" Pacific Eagle \" (1953) were also mass-produced. Under these circumstances Kanjuro Arashi is Emperor Meiji played the \" Emperor Meiji and the Russo-Japanese War , such as\" (1957) until the work also has appeared. It was a situation that was unthinkable before the war, the commercialization of the emperor, who was sacred and should not be invaded.\n\nThe international reputation of the film has also risen, and Akira Kurosawa won the Grand Prix of the Venice International Film Festival for \" Rashomon \" in 1951, Kenji Mizoguchi \"The Life of Oharu \" in 1952, and \" Ugetsu Monogatari \" in 1953. , 1954 \" Sansho the Bailiff \" and won the award for the third consecutive year. In 1954, Kurosawa's \" Seven Samurai \" also won the Silver Lion Award at the Venice International Film Festival , and Teinosuke Kinugasa 's \" Gate of Hell \" won the Grand Prix at the Cannes International Film Festival . The film marveled the world.\n\nIn addition to Toho, Shochiku, Nikkatsu, and Daiei, the mass production system for such movies was led by Toei, which showed rapid development. The trends of each company are as follows.\n\nToei\n\nIn order to force the mass production system of two new works, a short story in a serial drama format for children will be shown in a long film. The \" New Country Story Fuebuki Doji \" series (1954, trilogy) and \" New Country Story Red Peacock \" series (1954-1955, pentalogy ) starring Kinnosuke Nakamura and Chiyonosuke Azuma are overwhelming to children. Receive the target. In addition, Utaemon Ichikawa , Chiezo Kataoka , Ryunosuke Tsukigata , Ryūtarō Ōtomo of appearances, also activated adults age drama. Along with the starring works by Kinnosuke Nakamura and Hashizo Okawa , Toei establishes itself as a historical drama kingdom.

In 1957, Hiroshi Teshigahara and Susumu Hani young movie people, et al., Such as is formed the group \"Cinema 57\", it has been performed, such as production of experimental film.\n\n1960s\n\nIn 1960, it reached its peak with the production of 547, the highest number in the history of Japanese cinema. Most of them are program pictures by six major companies , and since this year, the movie industry has begun to show and hide. The number of spectators mobilized to a maximum of more than 1.1 billion in 1958, then dropped sharply, and in 1963 it was less than half, more than 500 million.\n\nBehind this is the rapid spread of television , which appeared in 1953 . TV is widely penetrate the general in the wake of the Crown Prince marriage of 1959, 1964 of the Tokyo Olympic Games that momentum accelerated in. In addition, Hideo Gosha, who was enrolled in Fuji TV at this time, was seconded to Shochiku and made his debut as a movie director with \" Three Outlaw Samurai \". This is an opportunity for human resources from the television field who have no experience in the movie industry to advance into major movie works. In 1961 the new Toho to manufacture stop, Nikkatsu sold the studio in 1969, became the production stopped in 1971.\n\nAt the same time, Yasushi Nakahira , Seijun Suzuki , Masumura Yasuzo , koreyoshi kurahara , Teruo Ishii , Kihachi Okamoto , Shohei Imamura , Toshio Matsumoto , Nagisa Oshima , Osamu Takahashi , Yoji Yamada , Yoshishige Yoshida , Masahiro Shinoda , Kosaku Yamashita , Hideo Gosha , Kinji Fukasaku , Kenji Misumi , Eiichi Kudo , kirio urayama , Kei Kumai , Hiroshi Teshigahara , Koji Wakamatsu unique and a wide variety of young directors such as is was also the era was active.\n\nToei\n\nToei , which became the No. 1 audience mobilization , established the second Toei ( renamed to New Toei a year later) in 1960, doubling the number of productions and aiming for a 50% share of sales in the Japanese movie industry, but it was successful. Disbanded in 2 years. From the 1960s to the early 1970s, when the movie recession began, Koji Tsuruta , Ken Takakura , Sumiko Fuji and others made a boom. The founder of this genre is said to be Tadashi Sawashima 's \" Jinsei Gekijo Hikaku \" (1963), and it was a content that kept self-sacrifice while being sandwiched between in-law and humanity. Since then, the series such as \" Bakuto \", \" Nihon Kyokakuden \", \" Abashiri Bangaichi \", \" Showa Zankeiden \", and \" Hibotan Bakuto \" have gained popularity and were produced until around 1972, and Makoto Naito 's \" Furyo Bancho \" Series ”was also a hit. On the other hand, in 1969, the all-star cast \" Memoir of Japanese Assassin \" ( starring : Sonny Chiba , director): Sadao Nakajima ) has been released to the public, reflecting the tumultuous social conditions of the University of Tokyo and the Anpo Protests .\n\nToho\n\nFollowing the president's series , Toho started an irresponsible series starring Hitoshi Ueki by Kengo Furusawa and the best man series in Japan, and gained popularity as a cheerful musical comedy. Also, in the Wakadaishō series starring Yuzo Kayama , he showed a hit that robbed the stock of sportsman college students who were good at Shochiku.\n\nOn the other hand, Akira Kurosawa and monster movies also remained popular, and Kurosawa continued to co-produce with Toho Productions, \" Yojimbo \" (1961), \" Sanjuro Tsubaki \" (1962), \" Heaven and Hell \" (1963) ), \" Red Beard \" (1965) and other works. Kurosawa, who was asked to write and direct the American 20th Century Fox war movie \" Tora Tora Tora! \" In 1969, opposes the Hollywood system, which does not have the final editing rights. Shooting did not proceed easily, and he was dismissed after intense effort, causing a suicide attempt. In 1970, he produced the first color movie \" Dodes'kaden \".\n\nIn \" Desperado Outpost \" (1959) by Kihachi Okamoto, he advanced into warfare and appealed various genres. In the subsequent \" Japan's Longest Day \" (1967), Okamoto told Toho about the production claim and made a \" flesh bullet \" (1968) at his own expense .\n\nOther masterpiece, Kon Ichikawa general director \" Tokyo Olympic Games \" (1965), Mikio Naruse director of \" others who are in the woman \" (1966), \" Two in the Shadow and the like\" (1967).\n\nAround 1961, Toho bought the long-established movie theater \" La Brea \" in Los Angeles and started showing its own works, which functioned as a showcase for Japanese movies in the United States . In the 1960s, he also owned a specialty building in Times Square , New York .\n\nShochiku\n\nShochiku's specialty melodrama line, which was said to be \"Ofuna-style,\" could not generate profits, and President Shiro Kido resigned in 1960 . Hiroshi Otani, Audit & Supervisory Board Member, became president. A group of assistant directors called Shochiku Nouvelle Vague debuted one after another, directed by Nagisa Oshima \" Cruel Story of Youth \" (1960), \" Night and Fog in Japan \" (1960), and directed by Yoshishige Yoshida \" Rokudashi \" (1960). , \" Akitsu Onsen \" (1962), directed by Masahiro Shinoda \" One-Way Ticket for Love \" (1960), \" Assassination \" (1964) and other novel works , but dealt with the issue of Japan-US security revision Director Nagisa Oshima's \"Night and Fog in Japan\" will be closed by Shochiku four days after its release. Nagisa Oshima, who quit Shochiku, started an independent production company, and the directors of Shochiku Nouvelle Vague later left Shochiku. Yoshitaro Nomura directed humanity comedies such as \" Dear His Majesty \" (1963) and a movie starring Conte 55 . Director Yoji Yamada directed \" Shitamachi no Taiyo \" (1963) and \" Baka Marudashi \".(1964), \" Kiri no Hata \" (1965), and started the \" Otoko wa Tsuraiyo Series \" in 1969 . Representative works include Yasujiro Ozu 's \" Akihiwa \" (1960), \" Akitou no Aji \" (1962), Keisuke Kinoshita 's \" Fuebukigawa \" (1960), and \" Eternal Man \" (1961). , \" several Spring and Autumn walked by two people \" (1962), \" the legend of Struggle \" (1963), \" Koge \" (1964), Minoru Shibuya 's \" Mozu \" (1961), Masaki Kobayashi 's \" seppuku \"The Shrikes \" (1962), Director Zenzo Matsuyama \"The Bridge Between \" (1962), Director Susumu Hanin \" Fulfilled Life \" (1962), Director Noboru Nakamura \" Old City \"(1963), \" Kinokawa \", \"Warm Spring\" (1966), \" Chieko Sho \", \" Saharu \" (1967), \" My Love My Song \" (1969), \" Sleeping Beauty \" directed by Kozaburo Yoshimura 1968), \" 5000 km to glory \" (1969) directed by Koreyoshi Kurahara . \" The X from Outer Space \" (1967), \" Goke also announced monster movies such as\" (1968), but did not result in a hit.\n\nNikkatsu\n\nContinuing from the 1960s, Japanese-made western films called non-national films ( Akira Kobayashi 's The Rambler series, the drifter series, etc.) became a big hit, but with the advent of the full-scale television era and the declining trend of the entire Japanese film industry. In addition to being swayed , the business performance deteriorated sharply from the mid-1960s due to a series of disasters such as the mannerism of action movies, lack of planning, the decline in popularity of Yujiro Ishihara and Kobayashi, and the one-man constitution of the president, Hisaku Hori. .. In the 1960s, Sayuri Yoshinaga , Mitsuo Hamada , Hideki Takahashi , Tetsuya Watari , Yoko Yamamoto , Masako Izumi , Chieko Matsubara , Tatsuya Fuji , Meiko Kaji , Ryotaro Sugi and others were produced, but the tide could not be stopped. On the other hand, Shohei Imamura is \" Pigs and Battleships \" (1961), \"The Insect Woman \" (1963), \" Intentions of Murder \" (1964), Seijun Suzuki is \" Tokyo Drifter \", \" Fighting Elegy \"(1966) , but was dismissed from the moat who was dissatisfied with \" Branded to Kill \" (1967). In addition, the directors included Kei Kumai and Kirio Urayama .\n\nDaiei\n\nShintaro Katsu and Jiro Tamiya emerged in the 1960s, but Kazuo Hasegawa and Junko Kano retired (1963), and Fujiko Yamamoto (1963) and Jiro Tamiya (1968 ) were signed by President Masaichi Nagata for a five-company agreement. The number of spectators fell sharply due to the sudden death of Raizo Ichikawa (1969), and the business performance deteriorated due to Nagata's one-man management. Japan's first 70mm film \" Buddha \" (1961) and \"The Great Wall \" (1962) and other major movie lines ended in a few films. Daiei 's masterpieces of this age include Kon Ichikawa 's \" Younger Brother \" and \"The Son \" (1960), \" Ten Dark Women \" (1961), \" I am Two Years Old \" and \"A False Student \" (1962). , \"An Actor's Revenge \" (1963), \" Fake College Student \" directed by Yasuzo Masumura(1960), \" My wife confesses \" (1961), \" The wife of Seisaku \" (1965), \" The wife of Hanaoka Seishu \" (1967), \" Kill \" (1962 ) directed by Kenji Misumi Year), \" Sword \" (1964), \" Kenoni \" (1965), directed by Kozaburo Yoshimura \" I will never forget that night \" (1962), \" Echizen Bamboo Doll \" (1963), directed by Yuzo Kawashima \" Temple of the Gan \" (1962), \"The Gentle Beast \" (1963), Satsuo Yamamoto 's \" Mountain River Full of Scars \" (1964), \" White Tower \" \" Freezing Point \" (1966), Director Issei Mori \"A certain killer \" (1967) and so on. Daimajin series (1966), GameraHe also released monster movies such as the series (1965-1971), but did not make a hit. The main popular series are as follows.\n\nInfamous series (1961-1969) starring Shintaro Katsu and Jiro Tamiya .\n\nThe Tale of Zato City (1962-1968) starring Shintaro Katsu\n\nThe Hoodlum Soldier Series (1965-1968) starring Shintaro Katsu and Takahiro Tamura it reached its peak with the production of 547, the highest number in the history of Japanese cinema.

On the other hand, with the shift of the movie industry, it has become possible to see directors leaving large companies to produce independently, and Kaneto Shindo 's \" Naked Island \" (1960) and \" Onibaba \" (1964 ). Year), \" Live Today , Die Tonight \" (1970), \" Pitfall \" by Hiroshi Teshigahara and Kobo Abe (1962), \" Woman in the Dunes \" (1964), \" The Face of Another \" (1966) ), A work full of black humor has appeared.\n\nATG\n\nEstablished Japan Art Theater Guild (ATG) in 1961 (-1992). Produced and distributed non-commercial works of art. The first distribution work is \" Mother Joan of the Angels \" directed by Jerzy Kawalerowic (April 1962). The first Japanese movie was \"Otoshiana\" directed by Hiroshi Teshigahara (July 1962). Since then, in 1968, he started producing 10 million films, and in addition to independent directors such as Kento Shindo and Susumu Hani , Yukio Mishima (writer), Akio Jitsuoji (TV director), Shuji Terayama (theatre), Tahara He has opened the door to many graduates and styles, including directors from different industries such as Soichiro (journalist) and Kunio Shimizu (drama), and newcomers such as Kazuo Kuroki and Toshio Matsumoto . In the latter half of the 1960s, Koji Wakamatsu from a pink movie , and Nagisa Oshima , Shohei Imamura , Yoshishige Yoshida , Masahiro Shinoda , Kihachi Okamoto , who resigned from the five major films ,Kei Kumai , Yasuzo Masumura , Koichi Saito, and Kon Ichikawa, a freelancer, have also been given the opportunity to produce and present. Many works received high praise, such as being selected as the Kinema Junpo Best Ten, and became a big trend not only in the 1970s but also in the latter half of the 1980s.\n\n\" List of the Japan Art Theater Guild public works refer to the\"\n\nOther movements\n\n1962, Osamu Tezuka is Mushi Production established.\n\n1970s\n\nEven in the 1970s, the ability of Japanese movies to attract customers did not stop, and in terms of breakdown, the ratio of the five major companies to the 367 movies released in 1971 dropped sharply to about 40%. Of these, Daiei went bankrupt and was later acquired by Tokuma Shoten in 1974 . On the contrary, pink movies that can be produced on a low budget and movies by independent professionals are making great strides. Nikkatsu, which had fallen into financial difficulty, was rebuilt mainly by the labor union, and from 1971, the Nikkatsu Roman Porno line was implemented. In addition, due to the collapse of the star system, actors have switched from belonging to production companies to contracts for each work. The directors who were active in the previous era, such as Kurosawa and Oshima, who sought capital overseas, and Imamura, who turned to documentary, gradually disappeared. This is the end of the so-called Five-Company Agreement.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1960s, if 10 movies were made, 6 were in the black , but in the latter half of the 1970s, about 2 out of 10 hits were . The movie population is also one-seventh of its peak . It was said at the time that there was no other country in the world where movies had declined so much . From the country from the movie industry for the first time in too much of the decline subsidies but rose to actively voice of the, in June 1978 the Japanese filmmaker Federation was appointed chairman of Shigeru Okada in the mouth also issued if put out also \"money, after all It's like strangling yourself at the mercy of that. You have to steadily put your strength into each and every one of them and regenerate them on your own. It's not the time when Toei and Shochiku are glaring at each other with a strange corporate culture. The industry as a whole must think about measures against the sun, \"he said, categorically opposed the support from the government .\n\nOn the other hand, Haruki Kadokawa entered the movie production in 1976 and developed a strategic promotion with abundant budget production and media mix . The release of the film continued to be a huge hit, breaking through the stagnation of the Japanese film industry, which had been pushed by Western films and television, and the momentum of Kadokawa films continued until the mid-1980s . The fields of animation and documentary have evolved and laid the foundation for later. In \" Space Battleship Yamato \" distributed by Toei in 1977, the all-nighter group, which is said to be the first in a Japanese movie, appeared. In 1979, \" Galaxy Express 999 \" (produced and distributed by Toei) was released, and became the number one Japanese movie distribution in 1979, making it the first feat in the history of anime movies. Gained an exceptional reputation in the era when anime films were not rated.\n\nToei\n\nWith the decline of the student activism, Toei's Nintendo has come to be described as a faded movie. Toshiya Ito \"of female prisoner Scorpion series after publication of\", in 1973 Annals route \"of Jingi Without battle and\" series, \"of fighting movie Karate Kiba , such as\" series is a big hit, is one after another series of later, Annals・ The fighting route has become the two pillars that support management. In particular, Sonny Chiba 's fighting movie was a big hit in Europe , America and Southeast Asia . In 1975, he released the first panic movie in Japan, \" Bullet Train \", but although it was not a hit in Japan, it was highly evaluated overseas and became a big hit. In the same year was \"against the\" Tough Being a Man \"series of Shochiku track guy is\", is the series of from which more than offset the box office in Japan than \"The Bullet Train\", Bunta Sugawara is gangster movie to break away from the starting point It became. In 1978, \"The Yagyu Clan's Conspiracy \" became a big hit, and \"Works such as \"The Fall of Ako Castle \" were produced one after another with the aim of rebuilding the historical drama. From the late 1970s Kadokawa Pictures, office Academy of such independent professional incorporating actively the .\n\nShochiku\n\nIn Shochiku, Yoji Yamada 's \"It's Tough Being a Man \" series , which started in 1969, has won national popularity. The series has produced 48 films for nearly 30 years and was registered with the Guinness World Records in 1983 as the \"longest film series in the world .\"\n\nKadokawa Movie\n\n\"1976 Inugamike no Ichizoku starting with\", aimed at the combined effect of the publication and TV dramas such as media mix to expand the marketing, \" Proof of the Man ,\" \" wild certificate \", 1979 of \" Sengoku Self-Defense Forces \", etc., was a big hit in quick succession the epic . In \"The Inugami Family,\" Toho produced the film, and Toei distributed it. Subsequent films also adopted only the strengths of each film company, and proceeded with the production of original films that broke the boundaries of the conventional film industry. .\n\nNikkatsu Roman Porno\n\nThe transition of Nikkatsu means a Separation from the big actors and directors to whom he had belonged. Asahi Kobayashi and Tetsuya Watari to Toei, Jo Shishido is seeking the playing field to the TV. On the contrary, new directors and actors who had no chance until now appeared one after another, and it became the only place for human resource development during the stagnation period of the industry. Until 1988, Nikkatsu Roman Porno was produced at a pace of two per week, producing a large number of human resources such as Tatsumi Kumashiro , Noboru Tanaka , Masaru Konuma , Toru Murakawa , Toshiharu Ikeda , Shun Nakahara , Naosuke Kurosawa , and Shusuke Kaneko ...\n\n1980s\n\nIn 1980, the conventional studio system collapsed, and the system in which major movies were released simultaneously at exclusive theaters nationwide was no longer valid.\n\nNikkatsu changed the company name to \"Nikkatsu\" in 1978 and \"Ropponica\" in 1988 to try to break away from the romantic pornography line, but it could not stand up well.\n\nIn terms of new directors, Nikkatsu made a great contribution, and directors such as Takashi Ishii , Hiroyuki Nasu , and Kichitaro Negishi left Nikkatsu [ citation needed ] . It was also around this time that unique directors such as Yoshimitsu Morita , Kazuo Hara and Go Takamine appeared in personally produced films [ citation needed ] .\n\nIn 1984, Juzo Itami (the son of the movie director Mansaku Itami) made his debut as a movie director at the \" Funeral \" at the age of 51. Although it was not so well known, it started with screening in a small movie theater and gradually expanded to receive high praise, and finally it reached 30 including the Japan Academy Prize and the New Artist Award. It is now in a state of winning a movie award that exceeds it. (Although many people evaluate \" Dandelion \" in 1985 as an honorable mention), \"A Taxing Woman \" in 1987 was a work that covered the same period and skillfully incorporated it, and it became a social phenomenon and the world is this movie. It became a hot topic. Itami introduced Itami's unique sense, new perspectives, and new methods (in production) to Japanese films. (Itami continued to work on \" Marusa no Onna 2 \" (1988), \" Tales of a Golden Geish \" (1990), \" Minbo no Onna \" (1992), \" Daibyonin \" (1993), and \" Quiet Life \" ( 1995), \" Super Woman \" (1996), \" Martai Woman \" (1997), and in the latter half of the 90's, he continued to release solid works and made a total of ten movies. Masayuki Suo at the scene of \"Woman in Witness Protection \"Suo Masayuki later said that the unique technique of Itami that he learned at the scene was very useful when he made a movie by himself, and Itami also contributed to Japanese movies in that sense. )\n\nIn the late 1980s, there was a series of movements to bring celebrities to film directors, and directors of all genres such as musicians, actors, writers, and painters appeared, but the second megaphone was taken by Takeshi Kitano and Tamasaburo Bando . There were very few such as Naoto Takenaka .\n\nOn the other hand, there are also works by the masters who have been silent in the 1970s, and representative ones are Akira Kurosawa's \" Kagemusha \" (1980), \" Ran \" (1985), and \" Dream \" (1990). And Seijun Suzuki 's \" Zigeunerweisen \" (1980), \" Heat Shimmer \" (1981), \" Yumeji \" (1991), Yoshishige Yoshida 's \" A Promise \" (1986), Toshio Matsumoto 's There is \" Dogra Magra \" (1988).\n\n1990s\n\nIn the 1990s, when the cinema complex settled in Japan, the number of movie theaters, which had been declining for a long time, finally switched to an increasing trend in 1994, despite the long-term constant recession. From 1960 to 30 years, it can be said that it was a time when signs of recovery began to appear, albeit slightly, in the movie industry, which had been declining in all figures. The movement of media mix became active, and the number of movie works linked with games , manga , animation, etc. increased. The risk diversification method based on the production committee method has become common, and the number of TV production companies entering the movie business has increased. It became the foundation for the revival of Japanese films in the 2000s. In addition, some topics of the international film festival that had been away since 1950 appeared, and in 1997, Shohei Imamura 's \" Unagi \" won the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival, and Naomi Kawase 's \" Suzaku Moe \" won the Caméra d'Or. .. At the Venice Film Festival, Takeshi Kitano 's \" HANA-BI \" won the Golden Lion Award, and even the slogan \"Renaissance of Japanese Film\" was born in the mass media. In terms of entertainment, Masayuki Suo 's \" Shall we Dance? \" Was successful in the United States and other countries. Even in Japan , bright topics continued, such as Hayao Miyazaki's \" Princess Mononoke \" becoming a record hit in 1997 .\n\n2000s\n\nIn recent years, as we enter the multi-channel era, the video expression unique to Japan has been reviewed due to the evaluation of overseas film directors. In particular, horror movies , also known as Japanese horror, have been in the limelight overseas, and \" Ju-on \" and others will be remade in Hollywood . At the same time, there is a movement to support the sluggish Japanese movies. Probably because of the result, in 2006, the box office revenue of Japanese movies exceeded the box office revenue of Western movies for the first time in 21 years (Motion Picture Producers Association of Japan). However, this is also due to the slump in the box office revenue of Western films. In 2014, most of the top 20 movie box office revenues were Japanese films, with only five American films .\n\nIn addition, there is a backlash that a large amount of commercials for movies funded by TV stations are being broadcast on their own stations, and they are fueled by information programs, etc. . However, these trends have continued since the slump in the 1980s, and there is a view that such media development does not necessarily promise an increase in box office revenue.\n\nAlso, regarding the on-the-spot use due to topicality such as talents and trendy single-shot entertainers, unlike Europe and the United States, the individuality of the performers is burned into the mind because the talents appear from CM to comedy, dramas and movies. Some people say that it cannot be seen as a \"movie\".\n\nThe Broadcasting Law stipulates that TV stations should not produce products other than programs because they can freely promote them, but there is no problem because commercials of movies that will be played on their own stations in the future do not violate the Broadcasting Law. The over-promotion mentioned is a matter of morals .\n\nOn the other hand, there are more works that shoot locations in local cities than in big cities such as Tokyo. Some of the hit works are set in local cities, and in some cases, the number of tourists visiting locations has increased. The aspect that movies play a role in regional revitalization has also grown rapidly since this era.
