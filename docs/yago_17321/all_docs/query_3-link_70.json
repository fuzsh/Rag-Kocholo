        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis essay explores the specific aesthetics and politics of pink film, a popular soft-sex film genre that exerted immense influence on the history of Japanese cinema after the 1960s. It argues that the explosive success of pink film – making up nearly half of Japanese film production within just three years of its first appearance – was due to its ability to mix, contain and express the contradictions of postwar and high-growth Japan. Focusing on the strategy of mixing live theatrical performances with film screenings, but also pointing out other aesthetic strategies such as part-colour films, the essay describes how on the levels of its material aesthetics, carefully calibrated but highly problematic identificatory strategies, and its interaction with live performance, pink film deliberately and successfully performed a politics of confusion. It concludes that this resulted in the establishment of a homosocial intimate public that perceived itself as oppositional but was just as much a site of the development of exactly what it attempted to resist – the high-growth system of the 1960s with its reorganization of labour and capture of gendered audiences.\n\n‘Shock! First class cinemas are swarming with mites! … 58 types targeting the soft skin of women!’. Thus ran the headline in a 1978 issue of the popular Japanese women’s magazine Josei Jishin.1 It was flanked by a closeup image of a mite that stretched across the page, extending its translucent legs and feelers over the text as if trying to attack the magazine itself. While the numbers were supposedly based on a report issued by the municipal hygiene office, the sensational feel of the page seems to articulate a deeper anxiety. It is not difficult to see this article as latching onto the period’s feelings about the threatening nature of cinemas in Japan more generally – especially those showing films made in Japan – that were increasingly seen as run-down and gendered as a uniquely male territory, unsafe for women.\n\nIncreased audience segmentation was one of the fundamental trajectories of media culture in Japan during the 1960s, and gender was one of its main axes. During this decade, female audiences began to abandon the cinemas that specialized in screening films from Japan. This was a development heavily shaped by the meteoric rise of ‘pink film’ and the concomitant shift of a large section of studio films to more male audience-oriented genres that emphasized themes of sexuality and violence. By 1979 around eighty per cent of all Japanese films released in cinemas were either pink films, Nikkatsu Roman Porno films or sexploitation films that explicitly targeted a male audience.2 Pink film was central to the reorganizing of cinema space and viewership in Japan from the early 1960s onward. This shift intersected with the longstanding division of cinemas into those that specialized in films produced in Japan (hōga) and those of foreign origin (yōga), as female audiences either migrated to yōga cinemas or dropped out completely.\n\nHaving said this, the full significance of pink films during the time of their greatest popularity has yet to be fully explored. I contend that the first ten years of pink film need to be understood on a number of levels, beyond the mere question of recurring narrative tropes. In forming a generic identity, pink film crucially relied as heavily on a set of stylistic conventions and paratexts as it did on various production, distribution, exhibition and reception practices.3 These aspects worked in tandem with each other, but often contained complex and divergent meanings – a feature that also applies to the films in their own right. To be more precise, pink film depended on the combination of numerous, seemingly opposed elements, resulting in what I call ‘an aesthetics of confusion’.\n\nIn what follows, I argue that this aesthetics of confusion functioned through the process of making specific sets of contradictions palatable by eroticizing the very confusion that they entailed. I thus claim that the notion of confusion – used here in the very literal sense of irreversibly fusing together – played a central role in the way that it addressed exactly the state of contradiction in which pink film audiences found themselves. This confusion was devised aesthetically via an intertwining of apparently contradictory formal strategies and conventions.\n\nAfter first providing a historical overview, I take a closer look at the early pink film practice of mixing film screenings and theatrical performances, a practice called jitsuen. I then explore the method of ‘part-colour’, by which colour film and black-and-white film were combined within the same filmic text. Finally I explore the various suggested gender-aligned identifications of pink film in its early phase. As will become clear, in calculated opposition to the alternative paradigm of commixtion, the idea of confusion enabled pink film to constitute a specific attitude towards temporality, identification, gender and nation.\n\nMost accounts so far – whether in English, Japanese or other languages – have focused on a tiny sliver of pink film production. In particular the films of Wakamatsu Kōji (and those of other directors involved in Wakamatsu Productions), which are actually fairly unusual pink films, have become a pars pro toto, or synecdoche, for the genre, and accounts have emphasized their experimental and political aesthetics.4 As a result, an approach that frames pink films as auteurist and deliberately politically subversive has dominated discussion, in effect making many of their contradictions invisible and relativizing the genre’s problematic treatment of gender.\n\nIt was, however, the genre of pink film as a whole, rather than (atypical) individual films, that was immensely successful in attracting largely male audiences. And while pink film politics were by and large explicitly and performatively anti-establishment and leftist, which for a time endeared them to the student movement, they also acted as an avant garde for those industry practices of outsourcing and labour casualization now often termed neoliberal. While decrying the aggressive political and social stratification of high-growth Japan, pink film answered with an increasingly efficient system of exploitation. The male communal space it offered served as a theatre for the dramatization of a discourse that included as much the promise of new prosperity and the expansion of visual or material consumption as it did the widespread trope of an emasculated nation, rage at social disparity and fear of exploited labour. Pink film, especially in its first ten years, presented stories full of impotence, frustration and traumatic violence, framed via complex identification mechanisms that deliberately tangled gender lines. The constellation of themes, tropes and practices that pink film was able to tie together also points to the trappings of a simplistic psychoanalyzing of a homogenized male audience. That said, it is nonetheless possible to work with the overarching hypothesis that the contradictions of pink film are less a flaw in its system than an intrinsic part of its purpose and performance – one that is highly problematic yet, when taken as a whole, may be seen as neither primarily politically resistant nor broadly reactionary.\n\nPink film was, however, highly exclusionary. In the 1960s Kawashima Nobuko, the female chief editor of the pink film specialist publication Seijin Eiga/Adult Film, occasionally wrote about the impossibility of watching a pink film in the cinema without immediately becoming the target for groping hands, which led to her watching pink films only at press screenings. While her remarks were written years before pink film settled into being shown exclusively in pink film cinemas in the early 1970s, the development of pink film spaces was already well underway. Along with the emphasis on sexual violence, mainly towards women, in the films themselves and the increasingly decrepit state of the auditoria, the spaces of pink film became representative of the increasingly fraught force-field of cinema more generally.\n\nFew studios were left untouched by the success of pink film, and film in Japan overall was significantly affected. From the early 1960s onwards, several of the major studios increasingly shifted their output towards genres considered to be targeting a male audience. Concentrating on themes of sexuality and violence became seen as one of the few safe bets in cinema’s competition with television and the swiftly developing leisure culture of high-growth Japan. The Toei studio moved towards the production of yakuza ninkyo (chivalry) films and eventually sexploitation movies, while Nikkatsu and Daiei experimented with lurid themes in films such as Aru Sekkusu Dokutā no Kiroku/Diary of a Sex Counsellor (Yuge Tarō, 1968). The result was a general sense that by the 1970s female audiences were increasingly focused on foreign films, a development that intensified with the mini-theatre or arthouse cinema boom of the early 1980s.\n\nPink film is therefore connected to a deeper level of transformation in Japanese cinema, even if its initial appearance did not raise that particular expectation for contemporary observers. It emerged in 1962 as a then unnamed type of film that quickly transformed Japanese film and its industry. Pinku eiga as a genre designation for a specific kind of sexploitation film only became standard usage in Japan in the late 1960s, after several years of informal competition with other early terms such as erodukushon (a hybrid of the Japanized terms for ‘erotic’ and ‘production’), sanbyakuman-en eiga (three million Yen films) or o-iroke (roughly, and ironically, ‘honourable sexy’). Yet belying the sense of a stable umbrella term, pink film in fact was characterized by a state of constant aesthetic and industrial flux for a period of around ten years. From its first explosive success in 1962 and 1963 to the increasingly rigid structure it would assume in terms of both film form and industry infrastructure around 1972 and 1973, pink film used this flux to consistently produce and market confusion as a core part of its audience appeal. This confusion was by no means a matter of random disarray, but rather a strategic and often contradictory constellation of traits and practices. This entailed the notion of confusion as a coherent counter-position to an ordered, hegemonic, state-supported and decidedly gendered vision of Japan, one that formed the ideological basis of the economic boom years of 1960s. It also signified confusion in the sense that pink film articulated various challenges to the narrow usage of the term ‘genre’ as something mostly derived from literary genre theory – thus emphasizing primarily narrative and textual tropes – and largely developed via the foil of Hollywood’s filmic output.5 Reaching beyond the signifiers on the screen, the specific confusion of which pink film made use encompassed a triangle formed of industrial structure, formal (filmic) strategies, and a complexly gendered form of spectatorial practice.\n\nThe growth of pink film was explosive. Production rose from just three films in 1962 to 213 in 1965, thus making up forty-four per cent of the total feature film output. This phenomenon attracted largely male audiences, but was definitely not to everyone’s liking.6 Pink film provided a kind of volatile coping mechanism for its audiences that was framed within particular gendered and nationalized identity discourses, and it did so on the levels of production, distribution, exhibition and reception. The generic identity and recognizability of pink film was thus defined by much more than just the filmic text itself. Pink film was charged with meaning across its economic structures and practices, all of which were used to argue for its objection to the status quo.\n\nThe concept of pink film negotiates a form that, on a number of levels, expressed a vague feeling of objection surrounding a male homosocial community. If the participants in what Lauren Berlant has called an intimate public ‘feel as though it expresses what is common among them, a subjective likeness that seems to emanate from their history and their ongoing attachments and actions’, then pink film supplied exactly such an intimacy.7 While Berlant, however, discusses the idea of an intimate public through the notion of a social minority, the male pink film audiences of the 1960s could hardly claim the same degree of disenfranchisement as Berlant can for women in the USA.8 Nonetheless there are several indications that the social and geographical uprooting brought about by the frenzied recovery of Japan’s high-growth economy from the 1950s onwards elicited a discourse – accurate or otherwise – of male disenfranchisement. A spreading affluence rendered social gaps more visible and, amongst other factors, a common public association of the new consumption culture with a specifically female consumerism gendered these divisions.9 The periodic return of discourses of the supposed ‘feminization’ of Japan – visible in the shift from cinema to television as the dominant media form – played into these divisions with the argument that men specifically were losing authority. This notion was, however, laden with inconsistencies, as the (re)division of labour or the reassertion of a specific family model also stabilized access to positions of power for men. In the claims of male embattlement, these inconsistencies were bypassed via a short-circuiting of gender, nation and the temporality of postwar geopolitical power relationships. If the relationship between Japan and the USA following the war deliberately played off old colonial tropes of the male colonizing force and the female colonized – leading to a kind of gender-switch for a Japan that had previously been a colonizer itself – these geopolitical politics also affected the gendered construction of social experience within high-growth Japan.\n\nConfusion – the purposeful arrangement of perceived incompatibles to emphasize actual and permanent inextricability of connection – suffused pink film’s generic Lebenswelt. It helped to constitute a community that lay at the heart of pink film’s historically situated success. In what follows I attempt to map out some of the levels and problematic consequences of pink film’s attractive confusion. What gave this confusion an oppositional feel was its confrontation of a state-imposed vision (once again) of a ‘modernizing’ Japan ideally marked as heterosexual and (cisgender) male. It did this, however, from a site geared towards male audiences, which allowed for participation in homosocial discourses of disempowerment that were entangled with associations of nation and gender. As such, a window on a more complicated politics of identification had to be opened, but also controlled.\n\nThe homosocial expanse of the screening space of pink film offered such an opportunity: a vista on a temporal politics that was resistant to the present and critical of the past but also, contradictorily, nostalgic. In this way pink film latched onto prior histories and strategies of temporalized homosociality in Japan. As Keith Vincent writes in relation to modern Japanese literature, there is a need to\n\nbegin to pluralize and taxonomize the understanding of male homosociality as a spectrum of different ways in which desire between men can [be] and has been mediated. This includes, of course, mediation through women as in the classic homosocial triangle, but also through other men, through literary tropes, hero-worship, national community, and various sexual ideologies and identities.10\n\nTemporality is key here, as these are ‘literally “two-timing” narratives in the sense that they stage tensions between two forms of temporality at once: the forward-looking time of modernization and normative development, and the “perverse” time of nostalgia, recursion and repetition’.11 In a very similar sense, pink film used its serial form and repetitive structures to allude in part to a supposedly better time before military occupation and high growth, even though this also entailed a flesh-focused antagonism to wartime spiritist ideology.12 The homosociality in pink film thus supplied a platform for coping with these temporal contradictions. That platform, it bears repeating, was established not only through particular narratives and tropes but through a combination of industrial structure, the formal properties of the filmic texts, and different sets of industrial and reception practices – all of which essentially constituted the overall ‘confused’ textuality of pink film.\n\nA small and speculative detour into the nomenclature and conceptual history of ‘confusion’ should help to illustrate what this specific kind of confusion may have meant in 1960s Japan. Closely connected to the history and strategies of globalization, this entails a journey into the conceptual history of the term ‘confusion’ that begins with the Romans and ends somewhat unexpectedly in Japan. The notion of ‘confusion’ is connected to confusio, a legal term from Roman law. Confusio denotes a situation in which two goods are combined to the degree that they can no longer be separated or distinguished, such as when barrels of wine have been poured together, and was a term designed for use in property disputes. It stands opposed to commixtio, which describes a situation in which the goods belonging to each party can be identified and, at least in theory, separated again. Confusio and commixtio actually entered the Japanese legal system in 1898, when German law (via the Prussian civil code, heavily influenced by Roman law) became the model for the Japanese civil code. The terms entered Japanese law as kondō (confusio) and konwa (commixtio).\n\nFields such as law, medicine, education, politics and fashion, as well as other institutions and social structures, were often heavily revised in the period following the imposition by US military force of trade treaties in the 1850s, specifically during the Meiji Restoration after 1868. The state initiated institutional transformations that necessitated decisions on what to acquire and what to reject in the drive to create a ‘modern’ nation state, by turns eliciting both anxiety and enthusiasm about how this process would affect the fabric of the country. It can be said that the concepts of confusio and commixtio entered Japan precisely at the point when the question of mixing a perceived self (though a newly constructed ‘national’ self) and other became central to the Meiji era as the discourse of the nation. The concepts can therefore function as representative of a certain discourse on different forms of influence and self-possession, but they also present two options for the future: one preserves an imagined pure (though gendered and ‘national’, so by implication modern) self that presumes a moment of clean separation at some point in the future; the other accepts an inextricable blending that must accept the impossibility of ever returning to a previously imagined state of separate purity.\n\nThe official state position has not fundamentally changed since that point (although the discourse is now led on other terms). Even the 1980s call to kokusai-ka (internationalization) associated itself with the idea of commixtio by making the assumption that ‘Japanese culture’ or identity could be preserved unblemished alongside the superficial acquisition of ‘foreign’ technology/culture to the extent that the two would remain fundamentally separable. The famous slogan used to describe this in the Meiji era was wakon yōsai or ‘Japanese spirit, western technology/learning’. We can posit commixtio as a strategy – itself not free of contradictions – that has aimed to negotiate the modern notions of the nation and national identity via essentialized categories that can coexist but must always be uncoupled, and whose commingling must always be reversible. It is therefore not surprising that Japanese law does not in practice distinguish between confusion/kondō and commixtio/konwa, and in the end applies the term konwa to stand in for both. To understand the role of pink film it is important to note that any active introduction of discourses of confusio into the system would inevitably be perceived as opposing not only the imperative of order that national ‘commixtive’ authority yielded, but also the concrete paradigms for identity construction that the principle of commixtio stood for.\n\nHow, then, did the confusionist tendency of pink film play out in the cinema? For almost eight years pink films were shot as part-colour attractions, and for around seven years they were commonly, or at least regularly, accompanied by theatrical performances. This is arguably the period of pink film’s broadest distribution, the time when it was at the apex of its perceived (oppositional) political significance and its most dynamic interval as a category of film. This turbulent dynamism is characterized by a combination of media and aesthetic modes.13 It is, however, less an expression of chaos than of a force of structured confusion, one that provides structure to the very contradictions its audience experienced. I now take a closer look at the specific ways in which this confusion was introduced.\n\nThe setting is in early 1966 in the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo. The Aka to Kuro (Red and Black) theatre troupe is performing a rendition of the play Modaeru Umeki/Agonized Moan at the Cinema Ririo, and a critic for the magazine Seijin Eiga/Adult Film is in attendance.14 The Cinema Ririo is one of the few specialized pink film cinemas existing at the time. Pink film at this point is still mostly screened as part of double or triple bills including major studio films – sometimes officially, sometimes illegitimately. The play, written by a certain Tozuka Jun (possibly, like so many names in the business at the time, a pseudonym) does not fulfil the expectations of the ample audience that has gathered. The story of a gang of escaped convicts who barge into a convent with the intent of sexually assaulting the resident nuns is performed on a tiny ramshackle stage; the props consist of a worn pink curtain, a large image of Mother Mary, and a wire bed.15 The narrative unravels several complications in which nothing is at it seems: the nuns are successively exposed as having affairs with the groundskeeper and the head priest, and one is even revealed to be a former yakuza moll with hidden tattoos. Yet rather than being enticed by the revelations, there is an atmosphere of discontent in the audience. The drama is insufficient, the acting by six pink film actresses, the well-known Hayashi Miki among them, is terrible, and despite a scene with same-sex intimacies that draws attention, there is barely any nudity, only ‘breasts that look as if they might slip out’.16 One audience member complains about this conspicuous absence, incomprehensible to him as ‘there is no Eirin [the film industry’s self-censorship organization] on stage’.17 For their poor performance the actresses are scolded backstage by Tozuka, who tells the journalist that they are fully aware that the regular audience in a pink film theatre will be disappointed. However, he adds, they are aiming for ‘real theatre’. The unnamed, but presumably male journalist does not agree. As the troupe is obviously not striving for either modern shingeki or shinpa styles of theatre, he believes they should concentrate more on delivering the product.18 The extension of pink film beyond the projected image seems by his account to have been a failure.\n\nThree years later, in early 1969, Murai Minoru of Adult Film magazine visits another stage performance, this time at the Ginza Chikyū-Za cinema, appropriately located behind that flagship symbol of affluent modernity in Japan, the Mitsukoshi department store. The play of the week is Nureru Utsuwa – Zen Sankei/Wet Vessel – All Three (Famous) Views, and although it is two in the afternoon the cinema is packed; according to Murai, the audience consists mostly of students and salarymen. The story of ‘a sadistic professor and his maid’ features scenes of whipping, tickling, and bondage that supply generous nudity and ‘daringly spread legs’. This time the audience seems content, although one man again remarks that the acting is unsatisfactory and the performers should simply stick to the nudity (figure 1).\n\nThe so-called jitsuen (literally, ‘real performance’) theatre and its uneasy but highly profitable relationship to the films themselves was one of several markers of pink film’s initial insistence on blurring boundaries, although this always tellingly (and typically for pink film) entailed an initial emphasis on the boundaries themselves. In the 1920s the Pure Film movement in Japan had fought hard to emancipate film from theatrical conventions.19 Certain acting styles, the performance of all female roles by male-identified actors called oyama, or the insufficient use of closeups were some of the factors it perceived as holding film in Japan back from achieving its full, modern potential. The 1960s, on the other hand, saw artists in Japan experimenting with what at the time was called intāmedia (intermedia), promoting a kind of media promiscuity that sought out combination and cross-pollination as a cutting-edge artistic strategy. Jitsuen can be seen as developing in exactly that climate.\n\nA year before the performance of Wet Vessel, the Keitsū exhibition chain had introduced jitsuen as a fixed part of their pink theatres’ schedule. Preceding each triple bill, troupes performed stage plays of about an hour in length twice daily, with the plays changing each week. They often featured actresses known from pink film, which at this time was still nurturing something of a star system.20 According to the Keitsū chain, jitsuen raised attendance by about twenty-five or thirty per cent, even though it meant increasing admission prices from 400 to 450 Yen, and was an important weapon in countering an increase in the major studios’ forays into pink film’s sexually themed territory.\n\nJitsuen was immensely successful in the later 1960s, so much so that troupes regularly toured the entire country, and a great number of specialized theatre groups formed between 1968 and 1972. Some of the more famous pink film actresses, such as Tani Naomi, later a star of the major studio Nikkatsu’s films, formed their own troupe, in Tani’s case the Gekidan Naomi (Theatre Troupe Naomi). The production company Kokuei found it so profitable that it founded a subdivision devoted to the jitsuen, Kokuei Geinō. There were in fact extensive ties between pink film and non-pink specialized young theatre troupes throughout the 1960s. The increase in nudity between the two jitsuen performances described above can be traced not only to audience demand but also to the general developments in experimental theatre of the time. The experimental theatre scene and pink film gravitated towards each other because they both participated in discourses of opposition. Wakamatsu Kōji was the first to give experimental theatre star Kara Jūrō of the Red Tent troupe a film role; prominent pink film actress Niitaka Keiko and later pink film director Ikejima Yutaka were both involved in the theatre troupe of Terayama Shūji, himself a prominent example of an artist working across film, poetry, theatre, radio, and so on; and butoh dance legend Māro Akaji played parts in films such as Yamatoya Atsushi’s experimental pink film Kōya no Dacchi Waifu/Inflatable Sex Doll of the Wasteland (1967).\n\nThe success of jitsuen eventually partially revived the rensa-geki or chain drama, which had experienced popularity in the 1910s and combined film screenings with theatre performances. For the 1970 New Year's Day release of Himitsu Kurabu no Onna/Woman from the Secret Club (Seki Kōji, 1970), Nihon Shinema experimented with the format, and the central company Kokuei Geinō used the comedy Jain no Yakata/Mansion of the Lewd Snake (Seki Kōji, 1970) for its own venture, even touring the country. Although it is very difficult to verify, the jitsuen format seems to have faded away with the fundamental changes to pink film around 1973, the last year that jitsuen performances still officially took place at the Ginza Chikyū-Za cinema. Yet for a stretch of several years, pink film as a genre relied heavily on the fact that it consisted of more than just film – a fact that has retrospectively been erased in nearly all accounts of pink film history, be they in Japanese or in English.21\n\nThe Keitsū chain also ran Million Film, a production outfit for pink films, so anyone who remained in the theatre after the Wet Vessel performance would probably have seen at least one of the Million Film productions of that month, such as Zankoku Nikutai Seme/Cruel Flesh Torment (Takeda Yūki, 1969), described as a film about a high-school girl hounded by lustful adults. Or perhaps a film by a production company associated with one the theatre troupes that were involved in the jitsuen, such as Wârudo’s Nozoki no Tsumi/The Offence of Peeking (Okuwaki Toshio, 1969), starring the aforementioned Hayashi Miki. According to the synopsis, this lost pink film (like so many others) follows an impotent man who tries to treat his condition by spying on couples in love hotels, only to discover his wife in one of them.\n\nThese films used another pink aesthetic strategy for performing confusion in the form of intermittent blasts of colour in an otherwise black-and-white film. ‘Part colour’, as the category was called, became standard for pink films around 1965, and denoted the introduction of colour sequences, usually for scenes featuring nudity or sexual activity, though this was not always the case, as I discuss later. The technique was first used by Ogawa Kazuhisa for his 1964 film Tsuma/Wife, and proved both cost-efficient and successful. As Satō Keiko, one of the few prominent female producers in the Japanese film business, famously recalled, ‘When the sexy part begins, the screen lights up like a musical!’22 The first all-colour pink films were shot in 1967: Fukai Yokubō no Tanima/Valley of Deep Desire (Sawa Kensuke), Abazure no Etsuraku/The Pleasure of a Hussy (Kobayashi Satoru) and Shin Jōji no Rirekisho/New History of a Love Affair (Yamashita Osamu). These all-colour pink films were reserved for special releases at the busiest seasons for film in Japan – New Year’s Day and Golden Week in late April and early May – and only became standard from 1973 onwards, when the pink film industry was forced to reorganize after Nikkatsu switched its production to sex films under the marketing label Nikkatsu Roman Porno.23 This shocking switch of the oldest major studio in Japan to the wholesale production of sex films effectively ended the history of part-colour, jitsuen, rensa-geki and many other modes of confusion. It was the catalyst for the single most decisive moment in the history of pink film: the restructuring of a still fairly open distribution/exhibition network into a closed circuit based largely on pink film specialized cinemas and a small oligopoly of distributors. For the first ten years of what had been discussed as pink film only in the mid 1960s, the very backbone of the genre was its strategic presentation of confusion on several different levels of its activity.\n\nWhat, then, were some of the disparate elements that pink film brought together? Ogawa Kinya’s pinku kaidan (pink ghost) film Kaidan Bara Bara Yūrei/Supernatural Tale Dismembered Ghost (1968) features a plot that, as in so many pink films, formulates its concerns through the tale of an abused female body. The young heiress of a family fortune, just returned from the USA, is murdered by her newly widowed stepmother and several accomplices. The murder takes place in a cave to which the victim, Masako, had fled after suspecting the conspiracy. What follows is a lengthy and shocking dismemberment scene, in which Masako’s limbs are sawn off and disposed of separately. Once the exhausted group have returned to their respective houses, they are haunted by hallucinations of amputated limbs, which appear in their hands as they attempt to grasp at something else, and by the gruesomeness of Masako’s disfigured presence, which eventually drives them to their deaths. The film is typically shot in part-colour, but in the second half it is not only the sex scenes that suddenly ‘light up like a musical’, but also bloody scenes of spectral revisiting. Thus Supernatural Tale Dismembered Ghost is, in many ways, representative of pink film itself. In 1968 pink film was a collection of seemingly incongruous discourses on gender, realism and vague political opposition – disconnected limbs that return to haunt the present together. It was only tentatively available to the public, yet hard to take one’s eyes off (both for the viewing audiences and for the organizations that decried its existence). The oppositional atmosphere surrounding pink film was a result of this particular ghostly shadowing. First of all, in terms of industry discourse it was connected to the history of dokuritsu eiga, or independent film. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, independent film was directly influenced and partly initiated by the Occupation government’s ‘red purge’ of leftist filmmakers and staff from the major film studios. Accordingly these films were often highly politicized and co-funded by various labour unions, to the extent that the term ‘independent film’ was often used synonymously with the terms sayoku eiga (leftist film) or shakai eiga (society/socialist film). Independent production virtually died out under the increasingly airtight major studio hegemony of the 1950s, and by 1957 independent production comprised a minuscule 0.32% of the total distribution gross in Japan.24 When pink film emerged with its almost default anti-censorship stance, it was the first real inroad made for independent production in over a decade, and thus it effectively became politicized by association. It is this fuzzy oppositionality, in combination with its reinforcement of modernization strategies, that still made it possible for different audience groups, from New Left students to blue-collar workers, to latch onto pink film’s complex bundle of discourses.\n\nPink film emerged in the early 1960s, a decade heralded by Prime Minister Ikeda Hayato’s 1960 proclamation that his administration’s goal would be to double its national income. This aim was linked to the political priority of Japan re-presenting itself to the world in a cleaned-up, ahistorical, peaceful and prosperous form, specifically through the Tokyo Olympics held in 1964. In line with its aesthetics of confusion, pink film was associated not only with resistance to this denial of history and its (perceived) foreign-induced process of ‘modernization’, but also with the influx of erotic films from the USA and Europe in the late 1950s. We can see the parallels to Supernatural Tale Dismembered Ghost and the logic of it being made as a pink film in the 1960s. A dismembered body of discourses – of imagined modernization, of the modern nation-state, of a supposed originary foundation layered beneath it – comes back to haunt high-growth Japan as much as the film. It appears as decidedly liminal, stuck somewhere between what was troubling in the past and what will be repeatedly troubling in the near future. This dismembered body is scattered painfully across time. The imagined male spectator is momentarily dismembered from the official framework of the nation, yet somehow the free-floating limbs of these discourses are connected – and that connection itself is difficult to comprehend and deeply troubling. The spectre that appears before the spectator shows a ghostly, impossible coherence. If the contextualization of the pink film genre and its films in specific discourses in 1960s Japan seems to run counter to an ahistorical conception of genre, that is certainly one lesson that the study of pink film supplies. Pink film and its strategic confusion were deeply modern, although this dispersive/recombinatory model of history also reminds one of arguments made regarding postmodernism. The ultimate point made by pink film does not seem concerned with upholding a cleanly separated radical alterity: it is precisely not about commixtio, which relies on the revocable, hygienic combination of pure binaries; rather it is about confusio, a demonstration of the inseparability of the modern(s) and Japan, of the foreign and the self, of the colonial and militarist past with the sanitized present. Yet just as the free-floating body parts still suggest the possibility of recombination, the ghost is explicitly female. On the level of representation, at least, confusion in the case of pink film almost never extends explicitly to the question of binary gender divisions. To locate that extension requires a move beyond the basics of narrative design.\n\nA closer look at Supernatural Tale Dismembered Ghost opens up additional avenues to pink film’s peculiar discursive position. It was produced and distributed by Ōkura Eiga, a company founded by the former benshi (silent film narrator) and later Shintoho studio head Ōkura Mitsugi. After a succession of scandals, Ōkura had resigned from the studio just prior to its bankruptcy in 1961, retaining his theatre chain and a small studio lot. It was Ōkura Eiga and its drive for a fixed exhibition structure that would become the main stabilizing force for pink film, right to the present day. While the interiors for Supernatural Tale Dismembered Ghost are obviously shot in Ōkura’s studio, almost all other pink films had to rely on location shooting. Ōkura’s studio lot allowed him to produce films quickly and efficiently, on lower budgets than other companies but reaping greater profits through his direct control of exhibition.25 It was probably Ōkura who set up the first specialized pink film cinemas around 1964 and, unusually for Japan at the time, remodelled the entrances to his cinemas so that one could buy tickets without being seen from the street. He thereby initiated the new segregation that was taking place in cinemas in the 1960s, with venues increasingly stratified along national and class-connoted gender lines. It is important not to take these connotations at face value, but the discourse of the time constructed a clear image: blue-collar male audiences watched Japanese films such as pink films or Toei yakuza films, while the middle-class female audience began to migrate to foreign films, usually shown in more upmarket cinemas. Pink film and its audience, especially where specialized cinemas were concerned, was increasingly confined to smaller, older, ramshackle venues that used the films as a last stand against bankruptcy.\n\nOnce again we see pink film’s tactics of confusion at work. While ostensibly, by its mere existence, a counterstatement to the top-down directed Tokyo Olympics style of ‘modernization’, it actively participated in the division of consumers into compartmentalized, exploitable groups. While tapping into the body-centred individualist subjectivism of the postwar literature of flesh (itself a critique of the spiritism of militarist Japan, which valued communal spirit over individual corporeality), it was creating a Gemeinschaft, or community, of males with an unmistakably national connotation.26 Yet this community was immediately in internal flux via a spectrum of homosocial relations and criss-crossing identifications.27\n\nIn fact the principle of confusio reaches into the fabric of the industry itself. While Ōkura upheld something of a pink mini-studio system until the mid 1970s, pink films were generally produced by a large number of small or tiny companies – usually pro forma fronts for the directors themselves – that were subcontracted by a distributor. The director/producer received half of the money for the production in advance, and the other half upon completion. Pink film directors thus possessed a level of autonomy unknown within the studio system, which appeared static and feudal by comparison. In the mid 1960s it seemed that anyone with the necessary energy could become a pink film director. While assistant directors at a studio had to wait at least ten to fifteen years to direct their first film (and often had to come from an elite university, as indeed Ōshima Nagisa, Yamada Yōji and many others did), young men like the high-school educated Wakamatsu Kōji or Yamamoto Shinya dived into their first pink directing jobs with barely any experience at all, and respectively shot eight and nine films respectively in their debut year alone. This ‘independence’ and freedom from a traditional teacher–pupil relationship was, of course, in the avant garde of liberalized work relations within a ‘modernizing’ country. In practice the vectors of anti-feudalism, anti-elitism, anti-censorship and anti-modernization proved impossible to combine in a manner that was free from contradiction, but this was exactly pink film’s point. As a discursive formation, pink film managed to coagulate contradictions into a coherent form that was accepted by the audience, the critics and even the industry itself. It provided a coping strategy for the crevice that was opening up between the national project of commixtio and a much more complex history. Centred on the principle of confusion, pink film made such contradictions acceptable via (female) nudity, male exclusivity, structural trade-offs and a very specific use of violence.\n\nIn Funōsha/Impotent Man (Kobayashi Satoru, 1967), Susumu is a fatherless young man who is near suicidal on account of his impotence. He moves to the city with his girlfriend Mari, who secretly prostitutes herself to her hedonistic and prosperous westernized boss. She desperately wants to finance an operation for Susumu to cure his condition. While waiting for the completion of Susumu’s medical procedure, Mari inexplicably encounters a Hitler impersonator, in full uniform, who rapturously expounds on the virtues of the Olympics (along with the urban ‘clean-up’ that preceded it, one of the most spectacular instantiations of the state’s vision for postwar Japan). Initially Susumu seems invigorated by the surgery, but after a traumatic sexual experience with a dominant older woman his inability resurfaces; agitated, he returns to his mother in the countryside. On the way, he strips, beats and possibly kills a passing schoolgirl in the woods, screaming that she should ‘Call me impotent now!’ This explosion of misogynist violence triggers a switch from the previous part-colour structure to a permanent full-colour scheme. Susumu flees to his mother, sobbing and searching for solace in her arms. Mari, in the meantime, dances apathetically at a beat club; stripped down to her underwear, she climbs onto a chair towards a noose, proclaims ‘You are all sentenced to death by hanging!’ directly into the camera (presumably at an almost all-male audience), and as her feet begin to dangle above the ground, other exhausted dancers snore on sofas in the background.\n\nImpotent Man was shot in 1967, the same year that the magazine Adult Film lamented the increasing violence in pink films with an article titled ‘Throw away the rope, whip and knife!’28 In fact violence had long been a mainstay of pink film, even before it fully emerged as a selfconscious genre. A previous film like Nikutai no Ichiba/Flesh Market (1962), for example, produced by Ōkura and, like Impotent Man, directed by Kobayashi Satoru, already revolved around the themes of rape, suicide and a murder plot.\n\nBy the late 1960s, however, the overproduction of pink films and the increasingly systematic attempts by the destabilized and desperate major studios – especially Toei, Daiei and Nikkatsu – to venture into the field of sexually themed films had created intense pressure for product differentiation.29 This problem could not be solved merely by increasing the level and variety of violence. ‘Ideas men’ such as Seki Kōji, a pioneer of the genre who had directed the female Tarzan film Jōyoku no tanima/The Valley of Desire (1962), tried out many other novel concepts: an ‘invisible man’ pink film called Tōmei ningen ero hakase/Invisible Man: Ero Doctor (1968); the first 3-D feature film in Japan, Hentaima/Pervert Freak (1967); rensa-geki (chain dramas) such as Himitsu Kurabu no Onna/Woman from the Secret Club (1970); even the use of infra-red film stock in Zuitai Ōkoku Nihon: Kōi, Shussan/Obedient Belly Kingdom Japan: Intercourse, Birth (1972). Sexual violence nonetheless remained a dominant narrative theme, a central dramaturgic tool and a central marketing strategy throughout these transformations.\n\nHow, then, did the audience relate itself to what was happening on screen? For spectators today – in both Japan and beyond – pink films and their emphasis on sexual violence, usually levelled at female characters, remain highly disturbing. This may also have been the case for large sections of the all-male pink film audience in the 1960s, and was certainly so for organizations such as the Japanese Parent–Teacher Association (PTA), which openly opposed pink film distribution. With their emphasis on male impotence, pessimistic violence, societal unease and brutal fatalism, what made these films attractive to their audience at the level of audiovisual design and narrative? It is difficult to understand them purely as the reaffirmation of a bruised or (subjectively) entrenched monolithic masculinity; such an explanation’s reliance on the model of straightforward identification of male spectators with male characters on the screen is hardly sufficient, especially given the degree of sophistication that feminist film theory and queer theory have brought to such questions of identification.\n\nIn Miriam Hansen’s classic study of female audiences’ relation to Rudolph Valentino, she moved away from an exclusive model of screen identification to one that was mercurial and unfixed, part of a constantly shifting spectatorial gaze.30 Carol Clover’s analysis of identification mechanisms elicited by slasher films similarly questioned a simple gender matching of identification.31 Clover mapped a typical shift from the killer’s perspective to that of the surviving ‘final girl’, even though this tendency still assumed the model of ‘one identification at a time’. Later models have analysed identification in film (and in social contexts) as an even more fractured process, and one even less connected to supposedly fixed borders of gender. Rather it has been viewed as a flurry of partial, temporary, and often simultaneous but contradictory identificatory attachments that are by no means restricted to human representation. The greater part of recent theories of identification has been concerned with how it can be figured as a strategy of minoritarian politics. To this end José Muñoz developed the notion of disidentification, which he conceives as the simultaneous recognition and performance of oneself as being both outside of a dominant (ideology or public sphere) and partially integrated within it. Looking at performance art, Muñoz regards this as a ‘survival strategy that is employed by a minority spectator’.32 It is a strategically employed confusio that recognizes the impossibility of a clear either/or relation.\n\nYet it is important to note – as Judith Butler has warned in Bodies That Matter 33 – that mobile identification and especially disidentification do not necessarily promise a destabilization of the categories and power structures attached to them. They can also make uneven power relations acceptable, or at least bearable, and thus provide the important but potentially problematic promise of a group or community. Nonetheless, according to Butler, they do simultaneously offer the positive possibility of questioning the process of group-consolidation through identification; as she states in an oft-quoted passage, the uneasy identificatory fit of disidentification between the hegemonic and the marginal provides ‘the point of departure for a more democratizing affirmation of internal difference’.34\n\nAn even more complicated example of this model might be supplied by pink film spectatorship, with its almost exclusively male audience group that at least perceived itself to be increasingly disenfranchised and relied heavily on gender discourse for providing form to this perception. Pink film’s appeal partly rested upon a sense of embattlement felt by a group that was not, as a whole, actually losing much of its power. The confused argument that pink film makes relies heavily on the very commixtive concept of gender, and this problem in some ways exemplifies why pink film was unable to fulfil its promise of the significant destabilization of power.\n\nThe discourse of embattlement was, however, real. Pink film drew on a slew of pre-existing discourses that fed this claim, often through the connection of gender with nation. Unsurprisingly, films in colonial and militarist Japan labelled the nation and its national body or kokutai as male, while the colonies in Korea and Taiwan or China were connoted as female. The switch to discourses of a female-gendered Japan of the postwar period was in turn actively supported by the US occupation. This coexisted with the well-established idea of woman as fluid, modern, and tied into an emerging consumer society. In Mukai Kan’s Burū Firumu no Onna/Blue Film Woman (1969), a young woman turns into a blackmailing prostitute prioritizing only cold hard cash after her family has gone bankrupt due to her incompetent father; she is in the end, however, killed by the (westernized) elite businessmen that she attempts to blackmail. The double signification of ‘woman’ as both anchor of stability (in this case of a postwar, middle-class society removed from a colonial and militarist history) and modern, threatening fluidity is in many ways typical of film and its relationship to modernity in general, but here it unfolds in a historically specific context.\n\nThe male characters of pink film in the 1960s were rarely wish-fulfilment fantasies; more often they were desperate, scrambling and impotent figures. The eruptions of violence so typical of pink film plots, however, possessed a polysemy that went beyond the mere re-enforcement of masculine virility and was paired with a very deliberate nudging towards multiple identifications. When a male character sexually assaulted a female character on screen, the male audience may have found a degree of reinforcement for the bruised and wobbly male subjectivity of postwar Japan with its national narrative of emasculation. When a female body was victimized, abused or beaten on screen, it was the re-enactment of a national metaphor: Japan, once male, now female, seen as helpless and violated. As the critic Yajima Midori wrote of the film Kuroi Yuki/Black Snow (Takechi Tetsuji, 1965), its message was simply ‘Don’t forget that the country called Japan is being raped by the American military bases!’35 The image of a woman in bondage, an increasingly common trope from the late 1960s onwards, was an attempt to fix the fluidity that she represented, to neutralize the flux of history that corresponded to an influx of the foreign and the fantasy of male disempowerment. But this trope also represented Japan itself, tied by geopolitical restraints such as the ANPO treaty (the Treaty of Mutual Co-operation and Security between the USA and Japan), a major target of public protests during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn this process of complex identification, the male-identifying spectator simultaneously invested ‘himself’, sometimes partially, sometimes more fully, into various different entities on the screen. Identity was, at the same time, tentatively retained by the bounded space of the cinema, by the spatial and masculine practice of ‘going to see a pink film’. This practice retained a social cohesion among men, moving them closer together against the free-floating incommensurability of woman and a newly internationalized nation. Yet by moving together, by buying tickets to see naked, abused and bound female bodies, they redistributed their identifications, their relations within the homosocial spectrum, and ended up supporting an increasingly fragmented public sphere and exactly the kind of liberalized capitalist system that was such a major source of unease and insecurity in the first place. The movement that pink film brought to the homosocial spectrum still lingers on in the decidedly queer space of pink film cinemas after the 1990s, as sites of sleeping, cruising and gender-identity play. Since the 1980s, pink film spaces have become used less for viewing what is playing out on the screen and more as sites for interaction amongst the audience.\n\nThe increased standardization of pink film texts, however, arguably led to the gradual semiotic blurring of the meanings of sexual violence, a reduction to an obligatory but repetitive formality. Maureen Turim has discussed exactly this problem of sexual representation via her at least partial defence of the films of Ōshima Nagisa. According to Turim, Ōshima’s films shift portrayals of sexual violence against women from those based on realist representation to those based on an investigation of the formal possibilities of film. As she argues:\n\nMost films that depict rape operate within the frame of realism that either creates audience identification with the urges of the rapist or represents the rape in a way that evokes sympathy for the woman as victim. Some even try to present a combination of these two antithetical possibilities. Oshima’s narrative strategies are different. Rape as a narrative event is subject to the same interrogation of the status of an event per se as are all other events in the narrative. Is it to be taken literally or metaphorically? Is the event ‘real’ within the fiction, or ‘imaginary’? All events in Oshima’s films are, in a sense, narrative tropes that one might compare to figures of speech within an elaborate discourse.36\n\nYet even Turim cannot see the films as transitioning successfully and fully into an emancipatory probing of the representation of women. She sees them instead as remaining inextricably tied to conventions regarding both the cinematic exploitation of women and male perspectives on sexual liberation: ‘I am arguing that these allegories are not simple but already multiple and internally contradictory’.37\n\nIf this sounds similar to the trajectory of pink film as a whole, albeit with less of a deliberately auteurist and emancipatory centre, it may explain Ōshima’s fascination with pink film (he was one of the few well-known directors who often participated in round-table discussions with pink directors for Adult Film magazine). While pink films moved away from a representational strategy in which sexual violence also stood in for a larger, perceived form of oppression, they remained tied to the convention of a ‘male space’ being reinforced and secured by gendered violence. The contradictory and incomplete emptying of pink S&M films from the late 1970s of the previous levels of meaning often left behind a formalist spectacle. In Takahashi Banmei’s Aru Jokyōshi: Kinpaku/A High School Teacher: Bondage (1978) the theme of rape leading to obsessive repetition (on the part of the victim) stripped the film of anything more than the most diffuse sense of societal disease. The trope of sexual violation became so polysemic that eventually it failed to contain the weight of contradictory meanings invested in it and collapsed into convention, whilst still retaining its primary element of misogyny. It is probably no coincidence that this collapse occurred just three years after the Osaka Expo of 1970 reinforced the ‘modernized’ nation-state at precisely the same moment that the distribution system for pink film began to stabilize.\n\nŌkura shut down its studio lot in 1973, shifting primarily to location shooting for its pink film productions. In contrast to this delocalization of production, pink film was now ending its valorization of flux and settling into a spatially fixed and increasingly hermetic circuit of exhibition. After Nikkatsu switched its production, distribution and cinema chain’s focus to its Nikkatsu Roman Porno line, pink film was forced into a consolidation process. The distribution market was, at the time, evenly divided between Ōkura’s OP Chain and Shintoho’s network, with barely any actual form of ‘independent’ distribution left (later in the 1970s Million Film would also become a major distribution force). The exhibition sector’s decade-long recession meant that cinemas were switching to screening exclusively pink films in much larger numbers, often as a last resort to stave off bankruptcy.38 Pink films themselves changed decisively due to this transition from films that were distributed to any kind of cinema to those produced almost exclusively for specialized venues. They became standardized in length at around sixty minutes, were designed to be shown in triple bills, and switched to all-colour. Subgenres became much more rigidly formatted, with less variation or subgenre mixing; pink films with a period setting disappeared almost entirely, as did jitsuen, part-colour, rensa-geki and other formal experimentation. At the same time there was a general narrative shift away from trauma, represented by sexual frustration and violence, as a site of political import. Instead, still producing hundreds of films a year, pink film moved towards formalist, obsessive repetition and lighter entertainment. In parallel with the generally increasing phobia of explicit political expression in Japanese society in the 1970s, the director Yamamoto Shinya pushed pink film into comedic territory with his chikan densha (train molester) and bathhouse series, in turn becoming the most influential pink film director of the 1970s. Neatly hived off into specialized cinemas and clearly distinguishable, highly standardized subgenres, pink film now witnessed the resurgence of the politics of commixtio.\n\nMeanwhile, the mainstream film industry was starting to follow pink film’s lead – and as a result pink film in retrospect looked like a testing ground. In a seminal move, Toho split off its production sector in 1970, signalling the shift away from a vertically organized major studio system to an exhibition/distribution-dominated market with outsourced forms of production. The pink film hothouse of flux and confusion had become a de facto repository of strategies for the casualization of labour relations in the media industry. Similarly, with the expansion and marketing of its discourses of opposition to all levels of its generic existence, it had also paved the way for Kadokawa Haruki who, from the late 1970s, used a very similar aestheticization of the economic sphere to promote some of the biggest blockbusters in Japanese cinema history.39 Much like pink film itself, the image of a film-industrial rogue opposed to the cinematic powers-that-be supplied Kadokawa with oppositional cultural capital, although in his case this was marketed as a fashionable flavouring for decidedly pop-culture films. By the early 1980s pink film had become a training ground for directors for a mainstream industry that had itself stopped recruiting or training staff long ago: directors such as Wakamatsu Kōji, Takahashi Banmei, Suo Masayuki, Hiroki Ryūichi, Nakamura Genji or Izutsu Kazuyuki began crossing over into regular film production; the Academy Award-winner Takita Yōjirō and Kurosawa Kiyoshi both began their commercial directing career within pink film. Ironically, these developments saw pink film in many respects became a fortress of tradition. By the 2000s, the traditional directorial teacher–apprentice relationship with its on-the-shoot training only survived in any organized fashion within pink film production. Japan remained the only country in the world shooting softcore sexploitation films on 35mm film until the late 2000s, and it is only here, in an industry now dominated by multiplexes, that specialized sex film cinemas survive in any systemic sense. In a peculiar sense, pink film can therefore still be read as a form of rebellion by the very fact of its tenuous, continued existence, even if this rebellion nowadays exists in opposition to the new world of transmedia texts, super-flexible media circulation, large-budget transnational film funding and the very term ‘media content.’\n\nTo summarize, a simple oppositional reading of pink film in terms of a straightforward formulated resistance to the status quo was problematic from the beginning, as pink film was already part of a larger movement towards efficiency, economic stratification, casualized labour and commodification. The disturbing violence it exerted against the female bodies represented on screen both utilized identification across gender lines and reinforced a gender binary. Its strategic confusion was in a sense always already part of this compromise, a tool to express a complexly configured – and initially male orientated – discontent as much as a desire to commodify it and make it more acceptable and exploitable. The confusion it structured itself around was escapist and epistemological, an acknowledgement of the impossibility of separating the contradictory vectors it, and the concept of nation in Japan, were immersed in. The eventual ossification of pink film into a fixed and highly formalized system of production, distribution and exhibition was heavily centred on the establishment of pink film specialized cinemas. These venues in a sense harnessed the confusion of pink film as a genre, and jitsuen and part-colour practices faded away, just as the ‘confusing’ identification mechanisms arguably became increasingly stratified along conventional gender divisions. Paradoxically, the queer potential of pink films rooted in their deep reliance on intensified homosociality began an extended process of assimilation into the space of exhibition, connecting to the diverse cruising practices that take place in the remaining pink film cinemas of today. The rapidly shrinking landscape of the pink film specialized cinema is now less a site of viewership than of active participation. In this sense pink film cinemas ostensibly targeting a heterosexual male audience have fused with the practice of the now defunct barazoku (‘rose tribe’) cinemas, where pink films directed at gay men were originally shown. In the pink film industry it was a common opinion that barazoku films provided greater artistic freedom to the director, as neither the audience nor the exhibitor actually cared what was being shown on screen.\n\nThe now differently homosocial space of the pink film cinema has lost the ability to hold the complex constellation of radical oppositionality and conciliatory consumption that it once performed within the arena of high-growth Japan. Once producing a fantasy of marginalization as one of its selling points, it is now (in a very different way) a decidedly marginal space, without actually making that part of its explicit institutional identity. It no longer represents a ‘two-timing’ tension that fuses a ‘modernizing’ and normative temporality of the present-future with an ambivalently nostalgic one. Instead the pink film space – where it still exists, in a progressive state of decay – has become a largely forgotten form of time capsule.\n\n© The Author(s) 2019.
