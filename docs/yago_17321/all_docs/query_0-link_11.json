        "text": "Shuji Kataoka's S&M Hunter (1986) was one of two films supplied by Pink Eiga for the Behind The Pink Curtain retrospective at Fantastic Fest. The screening of the company's newly subtitled digibeta source proved to be one of the highlights of the festival. S&M Hunter's casual parade of vulgar humor and taboo imagery might be as extreme as pinku eiga gets.\n\nS&M Hunter's kooky narrative is as follows. A misogynist goes to a dungeon where he takes out his frustration on a woman dressed as nun. After a bit of psycho-analysis, the dungeon master tells him that he is not a sadist but a masochist. The dungeon master then presents him with the ultimate sadist: S&M Hunter ((Shiro Shimomoto from Uncle's Paradise). Dressed like Indiana Jones with a designer eye-patch, the S&M Hunter is a master of the art of seduction through use of ropes. The S&M Hunter is so skilled at the art that he can wrap a body in a complex set of knots and patterns, including giant spider-like webs. Eventually, the misogynist reveals that an all-female gang named the Bombers kidnapped his boyfriend. The Bombers, who looked like they stepped out of a stage production of Grease, are lead by a man-hater who has a secret history with the S&M Hunter. Where does this all lead? It leads to a battle of the super sadists with the S&M Hunter employing a crane truck to pull off his ultimate rope trick."
