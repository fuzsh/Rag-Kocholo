        "text": "Well, it seems I had a little bit of drama here, yesterday. One of my oldest Letterboxd friends informed me that he's unfollowing me because I celebrate \"aberrant and morally repugnant\" films. The catalyst for this, of course, was some Christian loonball—who believes Hollywood is a den of Satanic, flesh-eating pedophiles—practically accusing me of being a pedo because I watched Lolita: Vibrator Torture. Crazy stuff.\n\nMy response to all this, of course, was to immediately go and watch more \"aberrant and morally repugnant\" films. Fuck 'em.\n\nEven if Hulk Hogan were a girl, she'd be his slave.\n\nMan, this is one weird ass film. The whole thing feels like some bizarre mashup of 70s exploitation sleaze and 70s tokusatsu shows,…\n\nI'll admit I’m not super well-versed in the Pinku Eiga genre but I’m sure this is still out there for even hardcore fans. Whew!\n\nA gay man has his boyfriend kidnapped and used as a sex slave by an all female gang, so he acquires the help of the S&M Hunter to get him back. The Hunter must use is rope bondage skills to stop the girl gang by taming them and showing them just how much they \"desire his ropes\".\n\nThe Hunter himself is the coolest dude out there. He wears an eyepatch with a skull symbol on it. That's fucking awesome! Instead of a gun holster he has a holster for his rope, which he uses like Spiderman from…\n\nPride is never over when \"S&M Hunter\" just saved the gays. I've wanted to see this for a while: the idea of it belongs to a pantheon of other predator \"heroes\" like Hanzo the Razor or the 9-film \"R***man\" franchise. Unlike those, this is an actual pink film born from the gutter. It's a somewhat bizarre splash of gay (way too tender petting) and straight pink film. Of which, director Shūji Kataoka has dabbled in both genres (like the similarly crass \"Rope and Boys\"). Our \"Hunter\" Shirō Shimomoto has played \"Miraki\" (of Angel Guts) in Nikkasu's finest hour, \"The Girl and the Wooden Horse Torture\" (1982). So yes, I was ready for this. Ready to sit back, relax, and not…\n\n\"Even If Hulk Hogan Were A Girl She'd Be His Slave\"\n\nSuch a ridiculously fun film and only an hour long!. You have a girl gang called the bombers who kidnap a gay dude and force him to have sex with them and the gay dudes lover asks the titular S&M Hunter to save his boyfriend from the girls. S&M Hunter somehow infiltrates the Bombers layer and found time to install a net in the bathroom so that when the one of the girls flushes the chain it springs down on her and somehow thrusts a vibrator inside her.\n\nS&M Hunter specialises in rope play and keeps his rope holstered like a gun which he quickdraws and flings at the…"
