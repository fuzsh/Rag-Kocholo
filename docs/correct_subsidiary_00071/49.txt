AOL is set to acquire Quigo, a US content-targeted advertising company. The deal will allow AOL to offer advertising that matches the content of specific webpages. The financial terms of the agreement have yet to be disclosed.

Quigo, founded in 2000, provides AdSonar technology that enables advertisers to buy space on websites, narrowed down to particular pages, sections, topics or keywords. The company has relationships with more than 500 publishers and has established a network of about 3,000 advertisers.

Once the deal is finalised, Quigo, which employs 100 people, will operate as a fully owned subsidiary of AOL.

Quigo also operates FeedPoint, which offers assistance to advertisers with search marketing and managing comparison-shopping platforms.

The acquisition will be the fourth company AOL has bought in recent months as it ramps up its advertising offerings. It has also bought mobile advertising company, Third Screen Media, German-based advertising platform AdTech and behavioural-targeting specialists, Tacoda.
