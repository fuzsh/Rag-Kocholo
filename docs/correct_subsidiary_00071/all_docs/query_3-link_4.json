        "text": "AOL has scooped up yet another online advertising company — this time, one that has faced off with Google and Yahoo in selling contextual text ads, those small, sponsored links that run next to articles.\n\nQuigo is AOL’s fourth advertising acquisition this year as the company, a unit of Time Warner, tries to reinvent itself. Historically AOL has made money selling Internet connections and subscriptions to its online service, but last year it changed the focus to selling Web advertising. AOL’s site and features — like e-mail — are now free.\n\nQuigo, which reportedly cost AOL about $350 million, is the third advertising network acquired by AOL in the last few years, and the deal, announced yesterday, highlights AOL’s goal of selling ads across cyberspace rather than simply on its own Web sites. AOL executives are trying to turn their company into a one-stop shop for advertisers that want to reach customers throughout the Internet.\n\n“A major thing we believe that advertisers are looking for is great reach, and we’ve been on this mission this year to make sure we had the largest reach,” said Ron Grant, president and chief operating officer of AOL.\n\nQuigo sells ads on the sites of Time Inc. magazines, ESPN, Forbes, CareerBuilder, the McClatchy Company newspapers and other well-known media outlets. Quigo has exclusive agreements with several of them, prohibiting them from running text ads from other companies. Recently, Quigo expanded into selling display and video ads.\n\nAOL, meanwhile, has been selling more ads on other companies’ sites, primarily through two networks that it acquired recently: Advertising.com, which sells leftover space for Web sites, and Tacoda, a behavioral ad network. Last quarter, AOL’s ad sales through networks increased 21 percent, faster than the 13 percent growth of its overall ad sales, Time Warner said yesterday. Most of that came from Advertising.com, since the Tacoda deal closed just recently.\n\nQuigo will become a part of Platform A, AOL’s newly formed advertising division, which is headed by a Tacoda executive.\n\n•\n\nIn addition to the Quigo deal, Time Warner announced its third-quarter earnings yesterday. Profit dropped 53 percent from the same quarter last year, when the company benefited from some one-time gains, but revenue grew 9 percent over last year’s third quarter.\n\nTime Warner, which also owns HBO, Time Warner Cable and Time Inc., announced this week that Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the company’s chief operating officer, would succeed Richard D. Parsons as chief executive at the end of the year.\n\nIn a conference call with analysts, Mr. Bewkes responded to suggestions that Time Warner split itself up by saying that the company would consider all options. One of the businesses that analysts have frequently suggested selling is AOL, where third-quarter revenue was down 38 percent to $1.2 billion, as more people ended their subscription services. AOL’s ad sales for the quarter were $540 million, nearly half the total revenue.\n\n“AOL’s advertising growth may be a little bit of a disappointment compared to your expectations, but we are pleased with the effort and progress that AOL has been making,” Mr. Parsons said in the call.\n\nQuigo grew from selling about five billion advertisements in September of 2006 to nearly 21 billion this September, said Henry Vogel, the company’s chief revenue officer. The company signed Time Inc. as an exclusive partner in June, meaning that none of Time Inc.’s magazines would run text ads sold by Google, Yahoo or others.\n\nQuigo offers its customers more information than Google and Yahoo do about where ads appear — on what sites and in what locations. Quigo allows advertisers to purchase specific placements for their text ads, which in turn encourages them to pay higher rates, the company says. Although Google has recently started offering more information of this type about its text ad system, neither it nor Yahoo have traditionally given customers that much transparency.\n\n•\n\nQuigo is testing a system called PageCast, which helps media companies run video ads in relevant locations. The system looks at various characteristics of videos — like tags and transcripts — to determine what stories the videos should run alongside.\n\nMr. Vogel of Quigo said the system could be used to share videos and video ad revenue among media companies. A newspaper, for example, could run a video from another Quigo partner next to a relevant story, and both companies would share the ad revenue.\n\nBob Davis, a managing partner at Highland Capital Partners, a venture fund that invested in Quigo, said he would have been surprised if AOL had tried to purchase Quigo two years ago.\n\n“We wake up one day and now AOL has become a real player in online advertising,” said Mr. Davis, who was formerly the chief executive of the Web site Lycos.\n\nAnthony J. Noto, a managing director and analyst at Goldman Sachs, said it was unclear how well AOL’s ad network strategy would work and how well Time Warner Cable would be able to compete with telecommunications and satellite companies. He said that Time Warner might benefit by taking a portion of AOL public.\n\n“This is a conglomerate company, and there are two underlying companies that are really driving the valuation: AOL and Time Warner Cable, both of which have some uncertainties right now,” Mr. Noto said."
