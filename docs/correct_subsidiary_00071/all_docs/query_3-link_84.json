As CEO, I’m excited to pair my passion for consumer-facing technologies with MyFitnessPal’s commitment to improving human wellness,” said Fisher. “MyFitnessPal’s mission to empower its users to achieve their weight management and broader health goals resonates with my own aspirations to live a healthier life and my desire to help others do the same.”\n\n“We are excited to partner with Mike as we see tremendous growth in the health and wellness technology sector and believe Mike’s experience at driving product innovation will further enhance our user experience and help millions more achieve their goals,” said Christine Wang, partner at Francisco Partners. “We are grateful to Dinesh for his service and appreciate his ongoing involvement at the board level.”\n\nFisher is a U.S. Army veteran who served as a Captain and pilot. He served on the Board of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and sits on the Board of the West Point Association of Graduates.\n\nUnder Armour, Inc. completed the sale of the MyFitnessPal platform to Francisco Partners in December 2020 for a transaction value of $345 million, including the achievement of potential earn-out payments. Under Armour acquired the app in February 2015.\n\nImages courtesy of MyFitnessPal"
