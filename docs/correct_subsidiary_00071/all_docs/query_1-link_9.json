He'll spend the next six months pretending to work as an adviser to Curt Viebranz, president of AOL's Platform A advertising division.\n\nGuess Yavonditte doesn't want to stick around and find out if losing News Corp.'s business to Google will hurt as much as some are predicting. Dealing with that happy development falls to Quigo CTO Michael Fisher, who will become president of the subsidiary."
