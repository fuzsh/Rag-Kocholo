        "text": "As a company, Bosch will pursue the goal of processing only recyclable materials in the future in the face of scarce resources and growing mountains of waste. This means that the raw materials are processed, used, recycled, and then used again. This principle is the foundation for using plastics in a way thatâs sustainable and climate neutral. To this end, most of the plastic components in the Quigo Green have been converted from conventional plastics to recycled materials. The housing is now made of 85 percent recycled plastic, and the MM2 universal clamp and adapter plate the Quigo Green comes with together amount to 95 percent.\n\nClimatec, a subsidiary of Bosch, advises cities and companies on how to become more climate-neutral by automating their buildings and using energy efficiency and sustainability services. Californiaâs City of Ontario is among the cities Climatec advises. Climatec evaluated the cityâs technical equipment in every public building, every park, and every other urban space. The team installed new equipment, such as air conditioners or solar thermal heating systems, in 26 public facilities and erected 13,000 new smart streetlights with LED technology that use up to 80 percent less energy. As a result, Ontario can reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by about 10,000 tons annually.\n\nThe core of Boschâs new fuel cell drive, the power module, can be seen behind the tilted cab of this Chinese test truck. The new drive uses the water-forming chemical reaction that occurs between hydrogen and oxygen to generate the necessary electrical energy. The technology also includes a battery for storing electricity, an electric drive motor for the rear wheels, and an electronic control system that ensures the electric drive is used as needed.\n\nFuel cell technology is a promising way to overcome environmental challenges. The truck doesnât emit a single gram of CO2 as it drives. And if itâs possible to produce the hydrogen without using fossil energy, the drive will function without emitting any CO2 at all."
