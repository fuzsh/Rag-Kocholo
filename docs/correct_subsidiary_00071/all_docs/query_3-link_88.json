        "text": "Our modern life relies on electricity: The number of electric vehicles is increasing. Digitization is advancing, and buildings as well as industrial facilities are becoming increasingly electrified.\n\nSo hydrogen is essentially the key to our future as it will become a decisive factor for ensuring a steady energy supply. It can replace fossil fuels across the board, including energy-intensive industries. Hydrogen is produced in electrolyzers. They use electricity to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. Combustion occurs in reverse order: Oxygen and hydrogen react to release energy. All that remains is water. This technology thus provides answers to pressing issues in the struggle against climate change â from decarbonization through to safeguarding our power supply by means of green energy.\n\nAt present, hydrogen is still too expensive for the mass market. Nevertheless, innovative pilot projects are being carried out in various areas to test its operational range. For example, hydrogen-powered trucks are already proving their worth in the daily transport of goods across hundreds of kilometers. In another example, a hospital is testing how energy-efficient fuel cell systems can reliably power critical infrastructures.\n\nFurther research and innovation is needed to establish hydrogen as a comprehensive solution over the long term. The objective is to increase the efficiency of hydrogen production and reduce costs. In this topic, you will learn more about the current state of the art and what steps are necessary for this promising technology to reach its full potential.\n\nTo produce hydrogen, purified water is broken down into its components hydrogen and oxygen. This separation takes place with the aid of an electrolysis cell consisting of an anode, a cathode, and a proton exchange membrane (PEM). The water is fed into the electrolysis cell, and the electrodes are energized. This causes hydrogen ions to react at the negatively charged cathode and form hydrogen gas. To produce large quantities of hydrogen, many hundreds of individual cells are connected in series. Bosch combines these electrolyzer stacks with a control unit, power electronics, and sensors to create a so-called smart module for scaling hydrogen production. Only green hydrogen produced with electricity from renewable sources makes an effective contribution to climate protection.\n\nWe are on the constant lookout for test engineers, chemists, project managers, energy experts, researchers, and many other talents.\n\nCheck out our global job opportunities or visit your local career website for insights into our application process and to get helpful advice. Become part of the Bosch family and discover what the future holds for you."
