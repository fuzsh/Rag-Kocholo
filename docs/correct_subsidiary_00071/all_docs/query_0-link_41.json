        "text": "T-Mobile USA tapped AOL's Platform-A for a billion-impression Web advertising campaign during a two-day period, Nov. 10 and 11.\n\nPlatform-A claims that it can reach more than 90 percent of U.S. online consumers, and that T-Mobile's advertising buy is the first of its kind. Platform-A includes AOL's owned-and-operated sites -- AOL.com, AIM and MapQuest -- along with the thousands of sites in the Advertising.com third-party network.\n\n\"T-Mobile was motivated to pursue this first-of-its-kind advertising vehicle by the groundbreaking experience of the T-Mobile G1,\" said Brett Dennis,director of branded entertainment and media management at T-Mobile USA.\n\n\"The already successful launch of the T-Mobile G1 is driving us to new and innovative ways to reach the broadest range of U.S. consumers possible,\" he said.\n\nPlatform-A and T-Mobile collaborated to create the \"T-Mobile Billion Block\" to spotlight the T-Mobile G1 with Google, the first Android-powered mobile phone.\n\n\"Our partners at Google and HTC, our partners for the T-Mobile G1, are not directly involved in this media buy,\" Mr. Dennis said.\n\nThe T-Mobile G1 with Google is produced by Taiwanese manufacturer HTC.\n\nOver a two-day period, the T-Mobile G1 will dominate a significant amount of AOL and other Platform-A inventory.\n\nIt is estimated that approximately 81.5 million consumers will be exposed to the new phone over the campaign's 48-hour run.\n\nAdvertising for the Billion Block will appear on the top 100 U.S. sites, as measured by unique visitors.\n\nThe partners claim that it is the most-expansive two-day ad buy in Platform-A history.\n\nThe message of the ad campaign is simple: \"The T-Mobile G1 offers a rich, accessible mobile Web experience for the masses.\"\n\n\"The advertising will feature the benefits of the T-Mobile G1,\" Mr. Dennis said.\n\nLate last year, Platform-A was established by merging AOL's advertising business, Advertising.com, TACODA and Quigo, to provide marketers with a means to leverage display, video, mobile, contextual, affiliate and search marketing services.\n\nTo date, Platform-A has fully integrated its sales forces and developed one insertion order and other processes to streamline ad buying.\n\nIn addition, Platform-A has accelerated its product development efforts with recent launches including Spot Marketplace, letting advertisers bid on non-reserved inventory across AOL's Web sites; PubAccess, a self-service interface enabling Web sites to place their inventory for sale in Platform-A's third party display network; audience targeting across Platform-A; and the creation of a 300x600 ad unit across AOL's homepages and co-branded sites.\n\nPlatform-A also includes Third Screen Media, a mobile ad-serving network, and buy.at, an affiliate marketing service.\n\nPlatform-A and currently has operations in the U.S., Japan (through a joint venture with Mitsui) and nine countries across Europe, including Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Britain.\n\nBased in Bellevue, WA, T-Mobile USA Inc. is the U.S. operation of Deutsche Telekom AG's mobile communications business, and a wholly owned subsidiary of T-Mobile International.\n\nBy the end of the third quarter of 2008, 127 million mobile customers were served by the mobile communication segments of the Deutsche Telekom group -- more than 32 million by T-Mobile USA -- all via a common technology platform based on GSM.\n\nT-Mobile is the third largest carrier in the U.S."
