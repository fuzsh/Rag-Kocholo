        "text": "It’s no secret that Igal Lichtman, the successful businessman behind numerous technology companies stretching back to 1986 goes by the online moniker “MrsJello LLC“.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nIgal Lichtman was the founder, chairman and CEO of Magic Solutions International, a software company in the field of help desk & asset management, with 300 employees and annual trailing sales over $50M. In 1996 and 1997, Magic Solutions was among INC 500’s fastest growing companies in the US, and in April 1998 was acquired by Network Associates Inc. (NETA) (formerly and currently McAfee Associates) for $110M.\n\nAfter the sale of Magic Solutions, Igal built and funded a number of high tech start ups including iboogie.com, quigo.com and domainSpa.com – the latter being an early entrant into “pay per click” Internet advertising business model.\n\nIn 2007, Israel-based Quigo was sold to AOL for a staggering $363 million.\n\nIgal has influenced several successful domainers, including Chris Chena and Ron Jackson, who featured DomainSpa in its very first issue of DNJournal.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Igal at TRAFFIC Las Vegas, after having engaged in business with him for almost seven years. Igal’s photos are a rare commodity – but we will exclusively present several photos in further updates of this post.\n\nAt TRAFFIC Las Vegas, Igal cited former DNForum owner, Greg Ricks, as the “culprit” behind his full-time engagement in domaining.\n\nGreg sold him a portfolio of LLL .com’s which Igal then resold making a great profit – the rest is history, or shall we say, historia.\n\nIgal’s NameJet acquisition of Historia.com – Spanish for history – brings yet another great generic into the MrsJello LLC stable of quality domains.\n\nUsing his trademark mannerisms, Igal explained to me at TRAFFIC Las Vegas, the secret behind the MrsJello name:\n\n” It’s the first letter of a first name of my wife and kids:\n\nMichal, Rochelle, Sahar, Jason, Erica, Lori and Leeshy.\n\nAnd… When its all done and explained most people say “Ohhhh!”\n\nWhat makes Igal so successful is his extreme focus to his business, keeping white noise and the usual “parasites” away from his day to day functions.\n\nAfter my introductory presentation of DomainGang at the podium on the first day of TRAFFIC, Igal had some advice for me:\n\n“To those that like what you do, great. To those that don’t, fuck them.”\n\nAnd that’s some of the best off-the-cuff advice I’ve received in years.\n\nCopyright © 2024 DomainGang.com · All Rights Reserved."
