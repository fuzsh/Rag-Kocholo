        "text": "The brain of the vehicle relies on high-performance vehicle computers that run intelligent software on powerful hardware. The vehicle must calculate the best driving strategy in real time from a vast host of data captured by the environment sensors and networked services such as digital high-resolution maps, while at the same time making reliable predictions for anticipatory driving. To meet this challenge, Bosch is bringing together its combined software and electronics expertise and is cooperating with strong partners. Together with Volkswagen subsidiary CARIAD, Bosch is working on hands-free systems that allow drivers to explicitly take their hands off the steering wheel in certain situations. In the future, they will be used in all privately used vehicle classes of the Volkswagen Group brands â thatâs a substantial share of the worldâs vehicles.\n\nBosch is further expanding its competencies by adding fresh know-how. This results, among other things, from the acquisition of Five, Europeâs leading start-up for automated driving. Using the Five platform, Bosch can analyze real-world data from a fleet of test vehicles, create a wide variety of test scenarios, and build a simulation environment that enables lightning-fast evaluation and validation of system behavior.\n\nGiven that high-resolution digital maps have become an absolute must in terms of having an additional sensor to ensure that automated driving is safe and easy, Bosch is positioning itself even more broadly for its customers with the acquisition of Atlatec â one of the worldâs most innovative manufacturers of high-resolution 3D maps for automated driving functions at SAE levels 3 and 4.\n\nThe drive, brakes, and steering system are the muscles of the self-driving vehicle. In much the same way as the brain controls muscles via the nervous system, the vehicle computer sends signals to the various parts of the vehicle via cables to have them execute the driving strategy with precision. The vehicle knows where it is at any moment and is fully aware of its surroundings. This allows it, for example, to initiate lane changes on its own. Redundant systems are one of the keys to guaranteeing the highest degree of safety and are also of tremendous importance in implementing the âsenseâ and âthinkâ capabilities. In the event of a fault in the electronics, for instance, a second, independent circuit immediately takes over. The development and manufacture of such hardware is one of Boschâs core competencies, and it is already being mass produced for use on the road today.\n\nThe steering technology of the future no longer relies on a mechanical connection between the steering wheel and the wheels. In Steer-by-Wire, this is replaced with a cable connection. The steering wheel actuator uses precise sensor technology to determine the driverâs intention and transmits it digitally to the rack and pinion actuator â for maximum ease and safety. The system is made possible by sophisticated steering system technology and a redundant on-board data and voltage supply.\n\nWith Steer-by-Wire, the front end and chassis can be standardized, thus making a significant contribution to reducing complexity and costs. The system also enables a wide range of technical features that were not possible with previous, conventional steering systems â in particular when it comes to automated steering."
