        "text": "Missing Rosie? Too bad, she won't be hosting the anticipated 9pm live show on MSNBC. Talks seized between the “unemployed” Rosie O'Donnell and the ratings thirsty MSNBC, according to the Huffington Post, and it's no surprise that Rosie broke the news herself, on her blog.\n\nFox news reports that the network couldn't afford the deal just based on a nighttime show, and Rosie doesn't want a busy work schedule while her kids are at school.\n\nAlso:\n\nAOL has acquired Quigo, its fourth advertising acquisition this year\n\nSouthwest Airlines has ended its first-come-first-serve approach to seating, increasing its fare options and benefits for business travelers.\n\nNow Canadians can get their cigarettes, candy, and new cell phones at 7-Eleven. Nokia is partnering with 7-Eleven and Petro-Canada, to debut and sell its new Canadian phone."
