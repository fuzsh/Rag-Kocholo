        "text": "From the looks of it, AOL has taken a page from Steve Ballmer's playbook. The recently bullish web portal has snapped up yet another startup this week, bringing the weekly count to two, and the yearly count to five. However, instead of making yet another ad acquisition, the struggling web portal has purchased the Israeli question and answer service, Yedda.\n\nAlthough Yedda has grown in prominence (raising $2.5 million in a recent round of funding) it will be interesting to see how it is eventually incorporated into AOL. As it stands, details of the deal have not been released, save for the fact that the startup will become a wholly owned subsidiary of AOL, and eventually incorporate its service across the portal.\n\nIt's odd to see an embattled company go on a shopping spree like this, but there may be light at the end of the tunnel. If Yedda's semantic search resources are allocated effectively, AOL could easily construct a Q&A service that could rival Yahoo Answers. However, a large portion of that strategy could be scuttled depending on how Time Warner's new CEO plans to overhaul the beleaguered web portal. Either way, we're not sure that this is the best time for AOL to be spending money.\n\n[Press Release]\n\nSee Also:\n\nWill Time Warner's New CEO Boot AOL?\n\nAOL to Make Another Ad Acquisition -- Quigo\n\nAOL's Growth Plan Spawns Hindi, Tamil Language Portals\n\nAOL Cuts 2000 Jobs to Rally Ad Ambitions\n\nDonald Trump and Silicon Valley's Billionaire Elegy\n\nVenture capitalists Ben Horowitz and Marc Andreessen claim the tech industry, California, and the country are doomed if we don’t embrace the former president.\n\nAt 25, Metafilter Feels Like a Time Capsule From Another Internet\n\nAfter a quarter century the community-driven site hasn’t changed much.
