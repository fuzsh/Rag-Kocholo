INVESTOR INFORMATION\n\n3. To Our Shareholders, I welcome the opportunity in this letter — my first to you as Time Warner’s CEO — to set out where the company is going and how we’ll take it there. TimeWarnerisbuiltonstrongbusinesses,butwecompeteinindustriesthatareundergoingfundamental transformations as new technologies and consumer expectations continue to evolve. Against this backdrop of accelerating change, we’re intensifying the company’s focus on growth by aggressively capitalizing on our most promising opportunities. Everything we’re doing reinforces our commitment to increasing shareholder returns in a sustainable, long-term way. To achieve this goal, we’re working to: • Operate our businesses for better performances and higher returns than our competitors; • Ensure that we have the right businesses and the right structure; and • Actively manage our balance sheet and deploy capital to the right places — including, when appropriate, directly to our shareholders. A MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT & CEO JEFFREY L. BEWKES\n\n4. to the industry, we’re putting an increasing amount of our own network programming on demand. All leaders in their categories, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Time Inc., HBO and Turner Broadcasting continue to build on their foundation of award-winning entertainment and news. At the 2007 Primetime Emmy® Awards, I’m proud to say, HBO received 21, the most of any network for the ﬁfth consecutive year, and Time Warner companies won six 2008 Academy Awards®. As we generate revenue growth, we’ll also manage our expenses to expand our businesses’ margins and proﬁtability. Recently, I announced a plan to cut over 15% of our corporate costs, resulting in an annual savings of more than $50 million. Making cost management a continuing commitment, we’re extending this discipline across all of our operations. Our decision to combine Time Warner’s ﬁlm studios, for example, will enable New Line Cinema to achieve signiﬁcant Growing our businesses is critical to Time Warner’s long-term success. Not only do we need to sharpen our current opera- tions, but we must also take full advantage of emerging digital technologies. We’ve recently made great progress across our divisions — including AOL’s Platform-A advertising business; CNN’s global leadership in online and wireless news; Time Warner Cable’s groundbreaking Enhanced TV features such as Start Over; Time Inc.’s successful SI.com, CNNMoney.com and People.com Web sites; and HBO On Broadband. Going forward, we’ll be even more revolutionary than evolu- tionaryinpursuingnewopportunities. Atourstudios,networks and publishing companies, digital content and distribution are extending our brands globally. These businesses are now stepping up their efforts to create new ways for consumers to enjoy compelling content how, when and where they want it. For instance, we believe that advertising-supported networks would beneﬁt from making their programming lineupavailable on demand to TV viewers. And, as an example A MESSAGE FROM PRESIDENT & CEO JEFFREY L. BEWKES\n\n5. savings in overhead by taking full advantage of Warner Bros.’ infrastructure. Aiming at putting the right businesses in the right structure, we launched two initiatives earlier this year. First, we began working to separate AOL’s declining access operations from its higher-growth audience, communications, community and advertising platform businesses. We’re conﬁdent that AOL is pursuing the right strategy, and success is now about execution. Key to AOL’s business model is strengthening Platform-A, in which we invested almost $900 million in 2007 for such acquisitions as TACODA and Quigo. Just as vital is growing usage on AOL properties, something that our planned acquisition of Bebo, a leading global social media network, should help us do. We expect that separating AOL’s access from its other businesses will signiﬁcantly enhance operational focus and multiply strategic options.

Second, we started a formal process to review our ownership of Time Warner Cable. We have long believed that cable is a great business, offering such advanced services as digital video, broadband Internet access and Digital Phone to both residential and commercial customers. But, as the industry evolves, Time Warner Cable has increasingly different capital and financial needs than our other businesses. Currently, Time Warner owns about 84% of the cable company’s com- mon stock while public stockholders hold the remaining 16%. The formal review process, which involves the boards of both Time Warner and Time Warner Cable, will determine what changes, if any, we should make to our ownership of the cable company. In these and any future initiatives, you can rest assured we’ll approachchangesmethodicallyandinawaythatmakessense for our shareholders. Finally, we’ll continue to manage our balance sheet effectively — with an eye to maintaining a healthy leverage ratio while retaining our investment-grade credit rating. In addition, we’ll keep evaluating the investment opportunities across our businesses and balance them against the beneﬁts of returning capital directly to our shareholders. In closing, let me underscore the conﬁdence that I have in our future. Time Warner is a great company of superb brands and talented people. Fast-changing industries are challenging, but they also provide our greatest opportunities to innovate and stay ahead of the competitive curve. We’re moving quickly to make the most of them. There’s a lot of work ahead of us. And, with my dedicated colleagues, I have no doubt we’ll succeed. Thank you for your support of Time Warner. Jeffrey L.

(This page intentionally left blank) 2\n\n11. COMPANY DESCRIPTION Overview Time Warner Inc. (the “Company” or “Time Warner”), a Delaware corporation, is a leading media and entertainment company. The Company classifies its businesses into the following five reporting segments: k AOL, consisting principally of interactive consumer and advertising services; k Cable, consisting principally of cable systems that provide video, high-speed data and voice services; k Filmed Entertainment, consisting principally of feature film, television and home video production and distribution; k Networks, consisting principally of cable television networks that provide programming; and k Publishing, consisting principally of magazine publishing. At December 31, 2007, the Company had a total of approximately 86,400 employees. For convenience, the terms the “Company” and “Time Warner” are used in this Annual Report to refer to both the parent company and collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which its various businesses are conducted, unless the context otherwise requires. Businesses AOL AOL LLC (together with its subsidiaries, “AOL”) operates a Global Web Services business that provides online advertising services on the AOL Network and on third-party Internet sites, referred to as the “Third Party Network.” AOL’s Global Web Services business also develops and operates the AOL Network, a leading network of web brands and free client software and services for Internet consumers. In addition, through its Access Services business, AOL operates one of the largest Internet access subscription services in the U.S. During 2007, AOL continued its transformation from a primarily subscription-based dial-up Internet access business into a primarily advertising-supported web services business. Historically, AOL’s primary focus had been its Internet access business. In 2006, due in part to the growth of online advertising, AOL shifted its focus to its advertising business and began offering many of its services for free. Consequently, AOL’s focus is on growing its Global Web Services business, while managing costs in this business as well as managing its subscriber base and costs in its Access Services business. In addition, AOL has begun separating its Access Services and Global Web Services businesses, which should provide them with greater operational focus and increase the strategic options available for each business. AOL’s Global Web Services business is comprised of Platform-A and the Publishing business group, which develops and operates the AOL Network (defined more fully below). In support of its transformation into a primarily advertising-supported web services business, AOL has formed a business group within AOL called Platform-A, which includes advertising sales activities, the Third Party Network advertising business, and advertising-serving platforms. Platform-A offers advertisers access to targeting and measurement tools that will enable AOL to optimize advertising inventory across the Third Party Network and the AOL Network. AOL offers advertisers a range of advertising services, including customized programs, premier placement of advertising, text and banner advertising, mobile advertising, video advertising, rich media advertising, sponsorship of content offerings for designated time periods, local and classified advertising, contextual and behavioral targeting opportunities, search engine management and lead generation services. Online advertising arrangements generally involve payments by advertisers on either a fixed-fee basis or on a pay-for-performance basis, where the advertiser pays based on the “click” or customer action resulting from the advertisement. 3\n\n12. Advertising services on the Third Party Network are primarily provided by Advertising.com, Inc. (“Adverti- sing.com”), TACODA, Inc. (“TACODA”) and Quigo Technologies, Inc. (“Quigo”), each a wholly owned subsidiary of AOL. To connect advertisers with online advertising inventory, AOL’s Platform-A business group purchases this inventory from publishers of the Third Party Network websites and uses proprietary optimization technology to best match advertisers with available inventory. AOL has expanded its online advertising business through several acquisitions over the past two years. These acquisitions include Lightningcast, Inc., a video ad-serving company, Third Screen Media, Inc. (“TSM”), a mobile advertising network and mobile ad-serving management platform provider, ADTECH AG (“ADTECH”), an international online ad-serving company, TACODA, an online behavioral targeting advertising network, and Quigo, a site and content-targeting advertising company. In addition, on February 5, 2008, AOL announced that it acquired Perfiliate Limited (doing business as buy.at), which provides advertisers and publishers a platform for e-commerce marketing programs. AOL’s Global Web Services business also includes the products and programming functions associated with the AOL Network. The AOL Network consists of a variety of websites, related applications and services, including those accessed via the AOL and low-cost Internet access services. Specifically, the AOL Network includes owned and operated websites, applications and services such as AOL.com, international versions of the AOL portal, e-mail, AIM, MapQuest, Moviefone, ICQ and Truveo (a video search engine). The AOL Network also includes TMZ.com, a joint venture with Telepictures Productions, Inc. (a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.), as well as other co-branded websites owned by third parties for which certain criteria have been met, including that the Internet traffic has been assigned to AOL. AOL’s audience includes AOL subscribers and other Internet consumers, including former AOL subscribers, who visit the AOL Network. AOL seeks to attract and engage Internet consumers on the AOL Network by offering compelling and differentiated free programming, products and services. AOL has recently introduced, and plans to continue to introduce, several new or enhanced products and services, as well as several programming and product improvements aimed at attracting and engaging Internet consumers. A part of AOL’s strategy is to maintain and expand relationships with current and former AOL subscribers and to increase their activity, whether or not they continue to purchase the dial-up Internet access subscription service. Another component of this strategy is to permit the use of most of AOL’s services, including the AOL client software and AOL e-mail, without charge. As a result, as long as an individual has a means to connect to the Internet, that person is able to access and use most of the AOL services for free. AOL distributes its free and paid products and services through a variety of methods, including relationships with computer manufacturers, and through search engine marketing and search engine optimization. AOL also offers paid services to AOL members and to Internet users generally, including storage and online safety and security products. AOL is also expanding its Global Web Services business internationally. In Europe, AOL has transitioned from a primarily subscription-based Internet access business to an advertising-supported web services business. Plat- form-A conducts activities in Europe through AOL’s subsidiaries, Advertising.com and ADTECH. In 2007, AOL launched new or refreshed portals in India and in eleven countries in Europe. In September 2007, AOL announced that it signed an agreement with Hewlett-Packard to offer co-branded, localized versions of the AOL portal, toolbar and search services pre-loaded on computers sold in various countries. By the end of 2008, AOL expects to serve over 30 countries. Internationally, the AOL Network also includes applications and services such as ICQ, MapQuest, Truveo and Winamp, and AOL is working to create international versions of other products and services. Historically, AOL’s primary product offering has been an online subscription service that includes dial-up Internet access for a monthly fee. In 2007, this subscription service continued to generate the majority of AOL’s revenues. As of December 31, 2007, AOL had 9.3 million AOL brand Internet access subscribers in the U.S., which does not include registrations for the free AOL service. The primary price plans offered by AOL are $25.90 and $9.99 per month, which provide varying levels of Internet access service, storage, tools and services. In addition, AOL subsidiaries continue to offer the CompuServe and Netscape Internet access services. AOL also earns revenues through its relationship with Google Inc. (“Google”) under which Google sells certain advertising that appears on the AOL Network and shares the resulting revenues with AOL. On April 13, 2006, AOL, Google and Time Warner completed the issuance to Google of a 5% indirect equity interest in AOL in 4\n\n13. exchange for $1 billion in cash, having entered into agreements in March 2006 that expanded their strategic alliance. Under the alliance, Google continues to provide search services to, as well as a greater share of revenues generated through searches conducted on, the AOL Network. Google agreed, among other things, to provide AOL the use of a white-labeled, modified version of its search advertising platform to enable AOL to sell search and contextually-targeted text based advertising directly to certain advertisers on AOL-owned properties, to provide AOL with marketing credits for promotion of AOL’s properties on Google’s network and other promotional opportunities for AOL content, to collaborate in video search and promotion of AOL’s video destination, and to enable Google and AIM instant messaging users to communicate with each other. On March 13, 2008, AOL announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire Bebo, Inc., a leading global social media network, for $850 million in cash. The transaction, which is subject to customary closing conditions, is expected to close in the second quarter of 2008. Cable The Company’s cable business, Time Warner Cable Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “TWC”), is the second- largest cable operator in the U.S., with technologically advanced, well-clustered systems located mainly in five geographic areas — New York state (including New York City), the Carolinas, Ohio, southern California (including Los Angeles) and Texas. As of December 31, 2007, TWC served approximately 14.6 million customers who subscribed to one or more of its video, high-speed data and voice services, representing approximately 32.1 million revenue generating units, which reflects the total of all TWC basic video, digital video, high-speed data and voice subscribers. In addition to its video, high-speed data and voice services, TWC sells advertising time to a variety of national, regional and local businesses. On July 31, 2006, Time Warner NY Cable LLC (“TW NY”), a subsidiary of TWC, and Comcast Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Comcast”) completed their respective acquisitions of assets comprising in the aggregate substantially all of the cable assets of Adelphia Communications Corporation (“Adelphia”) (the “Adelphia Acquisition”). Immediately prior to the Adelphia Acquisition, TWC and Time Warner Entertainment Company, L.P. (“TWE”), a subsidiary of TWC, redeemed Comcast’s interests in TWC and TWE, respectively. In addition, immediately after the Adelphia Acquisition, TW NYexchanged certain cable systems with Comcast. On February 13, 2007, Adelphia’s Chapter 11 reorganization plan became effective and, under applicable securities law regulations and provisions of the U.S. bankruptcy code, TWC became a public company subject to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the terms of the reorganization plan, during 2007, substantially all of the shares of TWC Class A Common Stock that Adelphia received as part of the payment for the systems TW NYacquired in July 2006 were distributed to Adelphia’s creditors. On March 1, 2007, TWC’s Class A Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “TWC.” Time Warner owns approximately 84% of TWC’s common stock (including approximately 83% of the outstanding TWC Class A Common Stock and all outstanding shares of TWC Class B Common Stock), and also owns an indirect 12.43% non-voting equity interest in TW NY. Time Warner is in discussions with TWC’s management and its board of directors regarding Time Warner’s ownership of TWC. TWC offers video, high-speed data and voice services over its broadband cable systems. TWC markets its services separately and as “bundled” packages of multiple services and features. Historically, TWC has focused primarily on residential customers, while also selling video, high-speed data and commercial networking and transport services to commercial customers. Recently, TWC has begun selling voice services to small- and medium- sized businesses as part of an increased focus on its commercial business. TWC customers who subscribe to a bundle receive a discount from the price of buying the services separately as well as the convenience of a single monthly bill. Increasingly, TWC’s customers subscribe to more than one primary service. As of December 31, 2007, 48% of TWC’s customers subscribed to two or more of its primary services, including 16% of its customers who subscribed to all three primary services. TWC offers three main levels or “tiers” of video programming — Basic Service Tier, Expanded Basic Service Tier and Digital Basic Service Tier. The basic service tier generally includes broadcast television signals, satellite- delivered broadcast networks and superstations, local origination channels, and public access, educational and government channels. The expanded basic service tier enables basic service tier subscribers to add national, 5\n\n14. regional and local cable news, entertainment and other specialty networks. In certain areas, the basic service tier and the expanded basic service tier also include proprietary local programming devoted to the communities TWC serves, including 24-hour local news channels in a number of cities. Together, the basic service tier and the expanded basic service tier provide customers with approximately 70 channels. The digital basic service tier offers subscribers up to 50 additional cable networks. Generally, subscribers to the expanded basic service tier and the digital basic service tier can purchase thematically-linked programming tiers, including movies, sports and Spanish language tiers, and subscribers to any tier of video programming can purchase premium services, such as HBO and Showtime. TWC’s video subscribers pay a fixed monthly fee based on the video programming tier they receive. Subscribers to specialized tiers and premium services are charged an additional monthly fee, with discounts generally available for the purchase of packages of more than one such service. TWC’s customers may receive video service through analog transmissions, a combination of digital and analog transmissions or, in systems where TWC has fully deployed digital simulcast, digital transmissions only. Customers who receive any level of video service via digital transmissions are referred to as “digital video subscribers.” As of December 31, 2007, 50% of TWC’s homes passed, or approximately 13.3 million customers, were basic video subscribers and of those, approximately 8.0 million (or 61%) were digital video subscribers. Digital video subscribers using a TWC-provided set-top box generally have access to an interactive program guide, Video on Demand (“VOD”), which is discussed below, music channels and seasonal sports packages. Digital video subscribers who receive premium services generally also receive “multiplex” versions of these services. On-Demand services are available to digital video subscribers using a set-top box provided by TWC. Available On-Demand services include a wide selection of featured movies and special events, for which separate per-use fees are generally charged, and free access to selected movies, programs and program excerpts from cable networks, music videos, local programming and other content. In addition, premium service (e.g., HBO) subscribers receiving services via a digital set-top box provided by TWC generally have access to the premium service’s On-Demand content without additional fees. TWC is expanding the use of VOD technology to introduce additional enhancements to the video experience. For instance, TWC has launched Start Over, which allows digital video subscribers using a set-top box provided by TWC to restart select “in progress” programs airing on participating cable and broadcast networks directly from the relevant channel, without the ability to fast-forward through commercials. Start Over was available to over one million digital video subscribers as of December 31, 2007, and TWC plans to continue to roll out Start Over in 2008. TWC has begun rolling out other Enhanced TV features such as Look Back, which utilizes the Start Over technology to allow viewing of previously aired programs, and Quick Clips, which allows customers to view short- form content tied to the cable or broadcast network then being watched. TWC is also working to make available Catch Up, which will allow customers to view previously aired programs they have missed. Set-top boxes equipped with digital video recorders (“DVRs”), among other things, enable customers to pause and/or rewind “live” television programs and record programs on a hard drive built into the set-top box. In its more advanced divisions, TWC offers between 30 and 40 channels of high-definition (“HD”) television, or HDTV, and expects to add additional programming during 2008. In addition to its linear HD channels, TWC also offers VOD programming in HD. As of December 31, 2007, TWC offered residential high-speed data services to nearly all of its homes passed and approximately 7.6 million customers, or 29% of estimated high-speed data service-ready homes, subscribed to a residential high-speed data service. High-speed data subscribers connect to TWC’s cable systems using a cable modem, and pay a flat monthly fee based on the level of service received. In virtually all of its systems, TWC offers four tiers of its Road Runner high-speed data service: Turbo, Standard, Basic and Lite. The tiers offer different speeds at different monthly fees. TWC’s Road Runner service provides communication tools and personalized services, including e-mail, PC security, parental controls, news groups and online radio, without any additional charge. The Road Runner portal provides access to content and media from local, national and international providers and topic-specific channels, including games, news, sports, autos, kids, music, movie listings and shopping sites. In addition to Road Runner, most of TWC’s cable systems provide their high-speed data subscribers with access to the services of certain other on-line providers, including Earthlink. 6\n\n15. TWC has offered its Digital Phone service broadly since 2004. Under TWC’s primary calling plan, its customers receive unlimited local, in-state and U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico calling and a number of calling features for a fixed monthly fee. TWC also offers additional calling plans with a variety of calling options that are designed to meet customers’ particular usage patterns, including a local-only calling plan, an unlimited in-state calling plan and an international calling plan. As of December 31, 2007, approximately 2.9 million customers, or 12% of estimated voice service-ready homes passed, subscribed to Digital Phone. TWC offers business customers a full range of video programming tiers marketed under the “Time Warner Cable Business Class” brand. Packages are designed to meet the demands of a business environment by offering a wide variety of video services that enable businesses to entertain customers or stay abreast of news, weather and financial information. TWC also offers business customers a variety of high-speed data services, including Internet access, website hosting and managed security. These services are offered to a broad range of businesses and are also marketed under the “Time Warner Cable Business Class” brand. Business subscribers pay a flat monthly fee, which differs from the fee paid by residential subscribers, based on the level of service received. In addition to TWC’s existing commercial video and high-speed data businesses, TWC recently introduced Business Class Phone, a business-grade phone service geared to small- and medium-sized businesses. TWC rolled out Business Class Phone in the majority of its systems during 2007 and expects to complete the roll-out of Business Class Phone in the remainder of its systems during 2008. The introduction of Business Class Phone enables TWC to offer its commercial customers a bundle of video, high-speed data and voice services and to compete against bundled services from its competitors. Filmed Entertainment The Company’s Filmed Entertainment businesses produce and distribute theatrical motion pictures, television shows, animation and other programming, distribute home video product, and license rights to the Company’s feature films, television programming and characters. All of the foregoing businesses are principally conducted by various subsidiaries and affiliates of Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., known collectively as the Warner Bros. Entertainment Group (“Warner Bros.”), and New Line Cinema Corporation (“New Line”). On February 28, 2008, the Company announced the planned consolidation of its Filmed Entertainment businesses, under which New Line will be operated as a unit of Warner Bros. while maintaining separate development, production and other operations. Warner Bros. produces feature films both wholly on its own and under co-financing arrangements with others, and also distributes its films and completed films produced by others. Warner Bros.’ feature films are produced under both the Warner Bros. Pictures and Castle Rock banners, and also by Warner Independent Pictures (“WIP”). Warner Bros.’ strategy focuses on offering a diverse slate of films with a mix of genres, talent and budgets that includes several “event” movies per year. In response to the high cost of producing theatrical films, Warner Bros. has entered into certain film co-financing arrangements with other companies, decreasing its financial risk while in most cases retaining substantially all worldwide distribution rights. During 2007, Warner Bros. and WIP released a total of 28 original motion pictures for theatrical exhibition, including 300, Ocean’s Thirteen, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and I Am Legend. Of the total 2007 releases, eight were wholly financed by Warner Bros. and 20 were financed with or by others. WIP produces or acquires smaller budget and alternative films for domestic and/or worldwide release. WIP released five films during 2007, including In the Valley of Elah. Warner Bros. distributes feature films for theatrical exhibition to more than 125 international territories. In 2007, Warner Bros. released internationally 19 English-language motion pictures and 28 local-language films that it either produced or acquired. After their theatrical exhibition, Warner Bros. licenses its newly produced films, as well as films from its library, for distribution on broadcast, cable, satellite and pay television channels both domestically and internationally, and, as further discussed below, it also distributes its films on DVD and in various digital formats. Theatrical films are also produced and distributed by New Line, a leading independent producer and distributor of theatrical motion pictures. Included in its 13 films released during 2007 were Hairspray, Rush Hour 3 and The Golden Compass. Like Warner Bros., New Line releases a diverse slate of films with an emphasis on building and leveraging franchises. As part of its strategy for reducing financial risk and dealing with the rising cost of film 7\n\n16. production, New Line typically pre-sells the international rights to its releases on a territory-by-territory basis, while still retaining a share of each film’s potential profitability in those foreign territories. New Line also has entered into a two-year co-financing transaction arranged by The Royal Bank of Scotland that began in February 2007. Picturehouse, a theatrical distribution company formed in 2005 and jointly owned by New Line and Home Box Office, Inc., is also a producer and distributor of independent films. This venture released eight films in 2007, including La Vie En Rose and The Orphanage. Warner Home Video (“WHV”), a division of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Inc. (“WBHE”), distributes for home video use DVDs containing filmed entertainment product produced or otherwise acquired by the Company’s various content-producing subsidiaries and divisions, including Warner Bros.

In January 2008, WHVannounced that, commencing in the second quarter of 2008, it would distribute its high-definition products exclusively in the Blu-ray high-definition format. Warner Premiere, a division of Warner Specialty Films Inc. established in 2006, develops and produces filmed entertainment that is distributed initially though DVD sales (“direct-to-video”) and short-form content that is distributed through online and wireless platforms. Warner Premiere released three direct-to-video titles in 2007. Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (“WBIE”), a division of WBHE, licenses and produces interactive videogames for a variety of platforms based on Warner Bros.’ and DC Comics’ properties, as well as original game properties produced by it and its subsidiary, Monolith Productions Inc. In 2007, WBIE expanded its business to include games publishing, utilizing the global supply chain infrastructure of WHV, and entered into a number of games distribution agreements. In 2007, WBIE distributed 23 game titles in North America, and in 2008, WBIE plans to release a number of new games and expand its game publishing operations into international territories. In December 2007, WBHE acquired TT Games Limited, which includes Traveller’s Tales, one of the world’s largest independent game developers, and TT Games Publishing, a U.K.-based game publisher.

WBTVG’s online destination, TMZ.com, a joint venture with AOL, is the number-one entertainment news website in the U.S., according to comScore Media Metrix. In November 2007, WBTVG launched a second online destination, MomLogic.com, and plans to launch a third destination site featuring animated properties from the Looney Tunes, Hanna-Barbera and DC Comics libraries in the second quarter of 2008. In 2007, WBTVG’s digital production venture, Studio 2.0, which works with creative talent and advertisers to create original live action and animated short form programming for broadband and wireless devices, developed and/or produced more than two dozen new live action, short form programs for distribution in 2008. Many of WBTVG’s current on-air television series are available on demand via broadband and wireless streaming and downloading and cable VOD platforms under agreements entered into with the broadcast and cable networks exhibiting the series. Internationally, in 2007, WBTVG launched five Warner Bros. branded on-demand program channels. Warner Bros. Digital Distribution (“WBDD”), a division of WBHE, enters into domestic and international licensing arrangements for distribution of Warner Bros.’ film and television programming through VOD and/or permanent download or electronic sell-through (“EST”) via online, cable and wireless services. WBDD has VOD and EST licenses with Apple Inc. for iTunes, Amazon.com, Inc. for Unbox, Microsoft Corporation for Xbox 360 and with Netflix, Inc. for movies via its subscription VOD service, as well as licenses with local online retailers in various international territories including Europe, Asia and Latin America. In 2007, WBDD commenced testing with Comcast and TWC in limited markets the release of films in VOD on the same date as their release on DVD. WBDD plans to expand this “day and date” release strategy for VOD in 2008 both domestically and internationally. WBDD has also worked with WHV to develop programs that make electronic copies of new release movies available to consumers who purchase DVDs, either by entering a code contained in the DVD packaging that allows consumers to download a file containing the film or by including an electronic copy of the film directly on the DVD that the consumer can upload. WBDD plans to expand this program in 2008. Warner Bros. Consumer Products Inc. licenses rights in both domestic and international markets to the names, likenesses, images, logos and other representations of characters and copyrighted material from the films and television series produced or distributed by Warner Bros., including the superhero characters of DC Comics, Hanna- Barbera characters, classic films and Looney Tunes.

Networks The Company’s Networks business consists principally of domestic and international networks and pay television programming services. The networks owned by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”) are collectively referred to herein as the “Turner Networks.” Pay television programming consists of the multi-channel HBO and Cinemax pay television programming services (collectively, the “Home Box Office Services”) operated by Home Box Office, Inc. (“Home Box Office”). The programming of the Turner Networks and the Home Box Office Services (collectively, the “Networks”) is distributed via cable, satellite and other distribution technologies. The Turner Networks generate revenues principally from the sale of advertising (other than Turner Classic Movies and Boomerang, which sell advertising only in certain European markets) and from the receipt of monthly subscriber fees paid by cable system operators, satellite distribution services, telephone companies, hotels and other customers (known as affiliates) that have contracted to receive and distribute such networks. The Home Box Office Services generate revenues principally from fees paid by affiliates for the delivery of the Home Box Office Services to subscribers, who are generally free to cancel their subscriptions at any time.

Effective January 1, 2008, Court TV was renamed truTVas part of a rebranding initiative that also included expansion of the network’s programming to emphasize real-life stories.

These statements are based on management’s current expectations or beliefs and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.

(This page intentionally left blank) 14\n\n23. RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATING TO TIME WARNER GENERALLY Several of the Company’s businesses operate in industries that are subject to rapid technological change, and if Time Warner does not respond appropriately to technological changes, its competitive position may be harmed. Time Warner’s businesses operate in the highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing media, entertainment, interactive services and cable industries. Several of its businesses are dependent to a large extent on their ability to acquire, develop, adopt, and exploit new and existing technologies to distinguish their products and services from those of their competitors. Technological development, application and exploitation can take long periods of time and require significant capital investments. In addition, the Company may be required to anticipate far in advance which of the potential new technologies and equipment it should adopt for new products and services or for future enhancements of or upgrades to its existing products and services. If it chooses technologies or equipment that do not become the prevailing standard or that are less effective, cost-efficient or attractive to its customers than those chosen by its competitors, or if it offers products or services that fail to appeal to consumers, are not available at competitive prices or do not function as expected, the Company’s competitive position could deteriorate, and its operations, business or financial results could be adversely affected. The Company’s competitive position also may be adversely affected by various timing factors, such as delays in its new product or service offerings or the ability of its competitors to acquire or develop and introduce new technologies, products and services more quickly than the Company. Furthermore, advances in technology or changes in competitors’ product and service offerings may require the Company in the future to make additional research and development expenditures or to offer at no additional charge or at a lower price certain products and services the Company currently offers to customers separately or at a premium. Also, if the costs of existing technologies decrease in the future, the Company may not be able to maintain current price levels for its products or services. In addition, the inability to obtain intellectual property rights from third parties at a reasonable price or at all could impair the ability of the Company to respond to technological advances in a timely or cost-effective manner. The combination of increased competition, more technologically-advanced platforms, products and services, the increasing number of choices available to consumers and the overall rate of change in the media, entertainment, interactive services and cable industries requires companies such as Time Warner to become more responsive to consumer needs and to adapt more quickly to market conditions than in the past. The Company could have difficulty managing these changes while at the same time maintaining its rates of growth and profitability. Piracy of the Company’s feature films, television programming and other content may decrease the revenues received from the exploitation of the Company’s entertainment content and adversely affect its business and profitability. Piracy of motion pictures, television programming, video content and DVDs poses significant challenges to several of the Company’s businesses. Technological advances allowing the unauthorized dissem- ination of motion pictures, television programming and other content in unprotected digital formats, including via the Internet, increase the threat of piracy. Such technological advances make it easier to create, transmit and distribute high quality unauthorized copies of such content. The proliferation of unauthorized copies and piracy of the Company’s products or the products it licenses from third parties can have an adverse effect on its businesses and profitability because these products reduce the revenue that Time Warner potentially could receive from the legitimate sale and distribution of its content. In addition, if piracy continues to increase, it could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and profitability. Although piracy adversely affects the Company’s U.S. revenues, the impact on revenues from outside the United States is more significant, particularly in countries where laws protective of intellectual property rights are insufficient or are not strictly enforced. Time Warner has taken, and will continue to take, a variety of actions to combat piracy, both individually and together with cross-industry groups, trade associations and strategic partners, including the launch of new services for consumers at competitive price points, aggressive online and customs enforcement, compressed release windows and educational campaigns. Policing the unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property is difficult, however, and the steps taken by the Company will not prevent the infringement by and/or piracy of unauthorized third parties in every case. There can 15\n\n24. be no assurance that the Company’s efforts to enforce its rights and protect its intellectual property will be successful in reducing content piracy. Time Warner’s businesses may suffer if it cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which its businesses depend. The Company relies on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and licenses and other agreements with its employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain its intellectual property rights in technology and products and services used in its various operations. However, the Company’s intellectual property rights could be challenged or invalidated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of current industry trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product and service offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect Time Warner’s proprietary rights, or such laws may not be strictly enforced. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions the Company may be unable to protect its intellectual property adequately against unauthorized copying or use, which could adversely affect its competitive position. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the industries in which the Company operates, much of the business of its various segments relies on technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and Time Warner may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses from these third parties on reasonable terms, if at all. It is also possible that, in connection with a merger, sale or acquisition transaction, the Company may license its trademarks or service marks and associated goodwill to third parties, or the business of various segments could be subject to certain restrictions in connection with such trademarks or service marks and associated goodwill that were not in place prior to such a transaction. The Company has been, and may be in the future, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s businesses or operating results due to a disruption in its business operations, the incurrence of significant costs and other factors. From time to time, the Company receives notices from others claiming that it infringes their intellectual property rights. Recently, the number of patent infringement claims resulting in lawsuits, in particular against the technology-related businesses at AOL and TWC, has increased. The number of other intellectual property infringement claims also could increase in the future. Increased infringement claims and lawsuits could require Time Warner to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question. This could require Time Warner to change its business practices and limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if Time Warner believes that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management’s attention and resources away from its businesses. In addition, agreements entered into by the Company may require it to indemnify the other party for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which could require the Company to expend sums to defend against or settle such claims or, potentially, to pay damages. If Time Warner is required to take any of these actions, it could have an adverse impact on the Company’s businesses or operating results. The use of new technologies to distribute content on the Internet, including through Internet sites providing social networking and user-generated content, could put some of the Company’s businesses at an increased risk of allegations of copyright or trademark infringement or legal liability, as well as cause them to incur significant technical, legal or other costs and limit their ability to provide competitive content, features or tools. Time Warner faces risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect its business and operating results. Time Warner’s businesses operate and serve customers worldwide. There are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally, including: k local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; k import or export restrictions and changes in trade regulations; k difficulties in developing, staffing and simultaneously managing a large number of foreign operations as a result of distance and language and cultural differences; k issues related to occupational safety and adherence to stringent local labor laws and regulations; k longer payment cycles; 16\n\n25. k political or social unrest; k economic volatility; k seasonal volatility in business activity; k risks related to government regulation; k currency exchange rate fluctuations; k potentially adverse tax consequences; k statutory shareholder minority rights and restrictions on foreign direct ownership; and k cost of entry. One or more of these factors could harm the Company’s international operations and its business and operating results. Time Warner’s businesses face additional risks internationally. Across the media industry, opportunities for revenue growth are beginning to shift toward developing nations, such as India, Mexico, Brazil, Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and China. In addition, revenues generated by certain media sectors, including television networks, local content production, online advertising and video games, are expected to experience robust growth in both developed and developing nations outside the U.S. The Company’s businesses currently do not have a strong presence in some of these fast-growing sectors. Accordingly, the Company could be at a competitive disadvantage in the long term if its businesses are not able to strengthen their positions and capitalize on international opportunities in high-growth economies and media sectors. International expansion involves significant invest- ments as well as risks associated with doing business abroad, as described above. Furthermore, investments in some regions can take a long period to generate an adequate return and in some cases there may not be a developed or efficient legal system to protect foreign investment or intellectual property rights. In addition, if the Company expands into new international regions, some of its businesses will have only limited experience in operating and marketing their products and services in certain regions and could be at a disadvantage compared to competitors with more experience, particularly diversified media companies that are well established in some developing nations. Although the Company is seeking to expand its businesses in certain strategic international regions and is formulating strategies for the growth of diversified media businesses in developing nations, there can be no assurance that such strategies will succeed. Weakening economic conditions or other factors could reduce the Company’s advertising or other revenues or hinder its ability to increase such revenues. Because several of the Company’s segments derive a substantial portion of their revenues from the sale of advertising, a decline or delay in advertising expenditures could reduce the Company’s revenues or hinder its ability to increase these revenues. Expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting general economic conditions, such as recessions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. In addition, advertising expenditures could be negatively affected by shifting societal norms, pressure from public interest groups, changes in laws and regulations and other social, political and regulatory developments. Disasters, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities also could lead to a reduction in advertising expenditures as a result of uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Advertising expenditures by companies in certain sectors of the economy, including the automotive, financial services and pharmaceutical industries, represent a significant portion of the Company’s advertising revenues, and any political, economic, social or technological change resulting in a significant reduction in the advertising spending of these sectors could adversely affect the Company’s advertising revenues or its ability to increase such revenues. Also, a continued downturn in the U.S. housing market could negatively impact TWC’s ability to attract new basic video subscribers and generate increased subscription revenues. In addition, because many of the products and services offered by the Company are largely discretionary items, weakening economic conditions or outlook could reduce the consumption of such products and services and reduce the Company’s revenues. The introduction and increased popularity of alternative technologies for the distribution of news, enter- tainment and other information and the resulting shift in consumer habits and/or advertising expenditures from traditional to online media could adversely affect the revenues of the Company’s Publishing, Networks and 17\n\n26. Filmed Entertainment segments. The Company’s Publishing and Networks segments derive a substantial portion of their revenue from advertising in magazines and on television. Distribution of news, entertainment and other information via the Internet has become increasingly popular over the past several years, and viewing news, entertainment and other content on a personal computer, cellular phone or other electronic or portable electronic device has become increasingly popular as well. Accordingly, advertising dollars have started to shift from traditional media to online media. The shift in major advertisers’ expenditures from traditional to online media has had an adverse effect on the revenue growth of the Publishing and Networks segments, which may continue in the future. This shift could also further intensify competition for advertising in traditional media, which could exert greater pressure on these segments to increase revenues from online advertising. In addition, if consumers increasingly elect to obtain news and entertainment online instead of by purchasing the Publishing segment’s magazines, this trend could negatively impact the segment’s circulation revenue and also adversely affect its advertising revenue. The Publishing and Networks segments have taken various steps to diversify the means by which they distribute content and generate advertising revenue, including increasing investments in Internet properties. However, the segments’ strategies for achieving sustained revenue growth may not be sufficient to offset revenue losses resulting from a continued shift in advertising dollars over the long term from traditional to online media. In addition, this trend also could have an indirect negative impact on the licensing revenue generated by the Filmed Entertainment segment and the revenue generated by Home Box Office from the licensing of its original programming in syndication and to basic cable networks. The Company faces risks relating to competition for the leisure and entertainment time of audiences, which has intensified in part due to advances in technology. In addition to the various competitive factors discussed in the following paragraphs, all of the Company’s businesses are subject to risks relating to increasing competition for the leisure and entertainment time of consumers. The Company’s businesses compete with each other and all other sources of news, information and entertainment, including broadcast television, movies, live events, radio broadcasts, home video products, console games, sports, print media and the Internet. Technological advancements, such as video on demand, new video formats and Internet streaming and downloading, have increased the number of media and entertainment choices available to consumers and intensified the challenges posed by audience fragmentation. The increasing number of choices available to audiences could negatively impact not only consumer demand for the Company’s products and services, but also advertisers’ willingness to purchase advertising from the Company’s businesses. If the Company does not respond appropriately to further increases in the leisure and entertainment choices available to consumers, the Company’s competitive position could deteriorate, and its financial results could suffer. Several of the Company’s businesses rely heavily on network and information systems or other technology, and a disruption or failure of such networks, systems or technology as a result of computer viruses, misap- propriation of data or other malfeasance, as well as outages, natural disasters, accidental releases of information or similar events, may disrupt the Company’s businesses. Because network and information systems and other technologies are critical to many of Time Warner’s operating activities, network or information system shutdowns caused by events such as computer hacking, dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks and other malicious activity, as well as power outages, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and similar events, pose increasing risks. Such an event could have an adverse impact on the Company and its customers, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to equipment and data. Such an event also could result in large expenditures necessary to repair or replace such networks or information systems or to protect them from similar events in the future. Significant incidents could result in a disruption of the Company’s operations, customer dissatisfaction, or a loss of customers or revenues. Furthermore, the operating activities of Time Warner’s various businesses could be subject to risks caused by misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification and accidental release or loss of information maintained in the Company’s information technology systems and networks, including customer, personnel and vendor data. The Company could be exposed to significant costs if such risks were to materialize, and such events could damage the reputation and credibility of Time Warner and its businesses and have a negative impact on its revenues. The Company also could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to remedy any such security breach. As a result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information, the 18\n\n27. potential misuse of such information and legislation that has been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection, privacy and security of personal information, information-related risks are increasing, particularly for businesses like Time Warner’s that handle a large amount of personal customer data. The Company’s Internet and advertising businesses are subject to regulation in the U.S. and internationally, which could cause these businesses to incur additional costs or liabilities or disrupt their business practices. The Company’s businesses that generate revenues from online activities and the sale of advertising inventory and related services are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including those relating to issues such as consumer protection, content regulation, user privacy and data protection, defamation, pricing, advertising, taxation, gam- bling, sweepstakes, promotions, billing and real estate. The application of these laws and regulations to these businesses in many instances is unclear or unsettled. Further, the application of laws regulating or requiring licenses for certain businesses of the Company’s advertisers, including the distribution of pharmaceuticals, alcohol, adult content, tobacco or firearms, insurance and securities brokerage and legal services, can be unclear and is developing, especially with respect to the sale of these products and services on the Internet. Various laws and regulations are intended to protect the interests of children, such as the Children’s Online Protection Act and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which restrict the distribution of certain materials deemed harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect user information from minors. The Company’s Internet and advertising businesses could incur substantial costs necessary to comply with these laws and regulations or substantial penalties or other liabilities if they fail to comply with them. Compliance with these laws and regulations also could cause these businesses to change or limit their business practices in a manner that is adverse to the businesses. In addition, if there are changes in laws, such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that provide protections that the Company’s Internet or advertising businesses rely on in conducting their businesses or if there are judicial interpretations narrowing the protections of these laws, it would subject these businesses to greater risk of liability and could increase their costs of compliance or limit their ability to operate certain lines of business. RISKS RELATING TO TIME WARNER’S AOL BUSINESS The continuing shift in AOL’s business model from a primarily subscription-based business model to a primarily advertising-supported model involves significant risks. In addition to continuing to implement the shift in its business model, AOL is working to separate the operations of its Access Services business and its Global Web Services business. As AOL has continued to implement the shift in its business model, AOL’s subscription revenues have been declining, and, although its advertising revenues have been increasing, they have not increased in an amount sufficient to offset the decline in its subscription revenues. Subscription revenues will remain an important source of operating income before depreciation and amortization (or OIBDA) for AOL in 2008. If subscribers to AOL’s Internet access service decline at a rate faster than anticipated, AOL’s ability to generate OIBDA in 2008 may be adversely affected. In addition, as subscription revenues continue to decline, AOL will become more dependent on continued cost reductions and advertising revenues in order to improve its financial performance. Identifying and implementing cost reductions may become increasingly difficult to do in an operationally effective manner and may lead to employee distraction or a decline in morale, as well as difficulty in hiring or retaining necessary employees. Cost reductions could also impair AOL’s ability to provide satisfactory customer service. As AOL continues to implement the shift in its business model, it becomes increasingly prone to the risks associated with operating an advertising business. Advertising revenues may be more unpredictable and variable than subscription revenues and are more likely to be adversely affected during economic downturns. In addition, AOL’s advertising business has benefited from significant growth in online advertising, and, if online advertising does not continue to grow, whether because of changing economic conditions or otherwise, AOL’s advertising revenues could be adversely impacted. See “Risks Relating to Time Warner Generally — Weakening economic conditions or other factors could reduce the Company’s advertising or other revenues or hinder its ability to increase such revenues,” as well as the risks relating to AOL’s advertising business described below. Pricing for advertising may continue to face downward pressure. During 2007, advertisers increasingly purchased lower-priced inventory rather than higher-priced inventory, and increasingly demanded lower pricing, in addition to increasingly purchasing advertising inventory from third party advertising networks as described below. 19"
