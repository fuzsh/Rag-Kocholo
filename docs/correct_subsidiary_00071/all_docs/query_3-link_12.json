        "text": "Web advertising platform\n\nOutbrain is a web recommendation[5] platform founded in 2006 by Co-Founder and Co-CEO Yaron Galai and Co-Founder, Chief Technology Officer and General Manager, Ori Lahav.[6] The company is headquartered in New York City.[5]\n\nIn February 2024, Yaron Galai resigned.[7]\n\nThe company generates revenue for online publishers by displaying feeds of content and ads, or boxes of links, known as chumboxes, to pages within a website or mobile platform.[5] Advertisers pay Outbrain on a pay-per-click basis and a portion of that revenue is shared with publishers.[8]\n\nThe quality of Outbrain's recommendations have been debated.[9][5][10]\n\nOutbrain is a native advertising company. It uses targeted advertising to recommend articles, slideshows, blog posts, photos or videos to a reader. Some of the content recommended by Outbrain link to publisher's own content, while others link to other sites.\n\nAs of March 2019 , Outbrain's promoted articles are found on 108,121 websites.[11] In 2020, Outbrain delivered an average of 10 billion recommendations daily for over 20,000 advertisers.[12][13]\n\nOutbrain first marketed its content discovery platform in 2006.\n\nIt was founded by Yaron Galai and Ori Lahav, who were both officers in the Israeli Navy.[14] Galai sold his company Quigo to AOL in 2007 for $363 million.[15] Lahav worked at Shopping.com, acquired by eBay in 2005.[16]\n\nThe company is headquartered in New York with global offices in London, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Cologne, Gurugram, Paris, Ljubljana, Munich, Milan, Madrid, Tokyo, São Paulo, Netanya,[17] Singapore, and Sydney.[18]\n\nOutbrain went public in July 2021. The company offered 8 million shares in the IPO, bringing in $160 million.[19][20]\n\nOutbrain has acquired 6 companies—related content recommendation platform, Surphace (February 2011),[21] content curation platform, Scribit (December 2012),[22] and predictive analytics company, Visual Revenue (March 2013).[23] In early 2016, Outbrain acquired technology company Revee.[24][25] In July 2017, Outbrain acquired Zemanta.[26] In February 2019, Outbrain acquired Ligatus.[27]\n\nIn October 2019, Outbrain announced its intention to merge with Taboola under the Taboola brand.[28] In September 2020, Taboola and Outbrain ceased merger discussions.[29]\n\nAdvertisers typically pay on a pay-per-click basis and publishers generate income from external clicks.[30][8] Approximately 75% of that revenue is paid to the site or app which presented the Outbrain link.[31] Outbrain shares advertising revenue with publishers who implement their feeds or links on their sites, which are sometimes referred to as chumboxes.[32][10]\n\nOutbrain has often been compared with competitor Taboola.[33][34] One way that Outbrain claimed to distinguish itself from Taboola was that it tried to pre-filter spammy links before displaying them, whereas Taboola had a feature called Taboola Choice, where users can offer feedback on what recommendations they do not like.[35][36]\n\nBoth Outbrain and Taboola have been described by Internet commentators as alternatives to Google AdSense that content publishers could consider for revenue streams.[37][38]\n\nIn November 2012, in response to criticism of it for low-quality links, Outbrain decided to cut off showing such links and stated that doing so would cause it a 25% revenue cut, but that it was important for its long-term reputation with publishers and users.[39] In 2021, Outbrain revamped its algorithm to incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve the quality of its ads.[40] However, the quality of Outbrain's recommendations have been debated.[35][41][42]\n\nVigLink\n\nRuptly\n\nChumbox"
