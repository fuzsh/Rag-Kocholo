        "text": "-Contact Thomas Rasmussen\n\nRecently, we’ve covered the hardships of online advertising companies. However, for a clear example of just how tough the environment really is, we point to the weakness at ValueClick, one of the few remaining publicly traded pure-play advertising firms. Amid an advertising slump and tough competition, the vendor has seen its first-quarter revenue decline 20% from the same quarter last year and its own projections point to a similar decline for the current quarter. With the advertising market seemingly trapped in the doldrums for the foreseeable future, we wonder if an opportunistic acquirer might consider a run at ValueClick.\n\nValueClick trades at an enterprise value of about $800m. This is about half its 2008 high, and down about two-thirds from 2007, when Google and Microsoft were throwing billions of dollars around to secure market leadership. With $592m in trailing 12-month (TTM) revenue, the company trades at a scant 1.3x sales. This is a far cry from the multiples paid for aQuantive and DoubleClick of 10x TTM sales and 12x TTM sales, respectively.\n\nWith $100m in cash and no debt, ValueClick CEO Tom Vadnais has indicated that the company is interested in doing some shopping of its own. However, given the dire state of the economy, we think a takeout is a much more plausible outcome over the next year or so. The potential acquirers include the usual suspects such as Microsoft, Google and IAC/InterActiveCorp; soon-to-be-independent AOL; and large media companies. However, we would hasten to note that most of these vendors have full traditional advertising portfolios, so an acquisition of ValueClick would merely be for boosting market share.\n\n-by Thomas Rasmussen\n\nAkamai just got serious about online ads. It acquired ad network acerno from i-Behavior last week for $95m in cash. (See my colleague Jim Davis’ report for more on this acquisition.) This marks not just a somewhat drastic change in focus for Akamai, but is also an encouraging sign for the remaining online advertising networks. Despite the current economic meltdown, and more specifically the declining revenue and abysmal forecasts from ad giants Yahoo and Google, everybody seems to want a slice of the multibillion-dollar online advertising market.\n\nIncluding the Akamai transaction, a total of 23 online advertising deals have been inked this year. That is up more than 25% from 17 deals for all of 2007, and just four in 2006. This increase in M&A activity stands in stark contrast to the overall Internet M&A picture, where the number of deals has declined more than 10%.\n\nMoreover, despite highly publicized warnings from VCs about the decline in available venture capital and possible exits, funding has been flowing freely and rapidly to online advertising startups. Some of the many to receive funding recently include mobile ad firm AdMob, which raised $15.7m last week for a total of $35m raised to date; Turn Inc., which raised $15m recently for a total of $37m; ContextWeb, which raised $26m in July for a total of more than $50m raised; social networking ad network Lotame, which raised $13m in August in a series B round for a total of $23m raised; and Adconion Media Group, which closed a staggering $80m in a series C round in February, bringing its total funding to more than $100m.\n\nWith IPO markets closed, these startups should all be considered M&A targets. Adconion in particular stands out because of its international reach and large base of 250 million users, 50 million of whom are in the US. It would be a nice fit for one of the large media conglomerates competing for online advertising dominance. And they have shown that they are not afraid of opening the vault to do so. VC and banker sources say funding is likely to continue for the near term since there is still a lot of buyer interest. It is unlikely to suffer the same fate as the social networking funding fad, because some online advertising companies actually make money. As this segment continues to consolidate over the next year, we suspect deal flow will likely eclipse that of the past 12 months. Mobile and video advertising ventures are likely to lead the next generation of online advertising-focused startups.\n\nSelect recent online advertising deals\n\nSource: The 451 M&A KnowledgeBase\n\nAfter running up an M&A bill of more than $10bn on advertising deals last year, Internet titans are now taking the wraps off some of the platforms built on those acquisitions. This week, for instance, Google struck a content distribution deal with Family Guy founder Seth MacFarlane. Google will distribute a new Internet-exclusive cartoon series using the AdSense platform it picked up through its $280m acquisition of Applied Semantics back in 2003. Additionally, Google launched its Google Affiliate Network, which is essentially a re-branding of DoubleClick’s affiliate marketing product, Performics.\n\nThrough the AdSense deal, Google will syndicate two-minute ‘webisodes’ with accompanying advertisements to thousands of demographically chosen websites. Of course, other sites already offer Web video streaming. However, few of them have found a way to offer the content in a profitable way. Consider the online TV network Hulu, a $100m joint venture of NBC and News Corp that streams videos from its stand-alone website. Although it consistently sells out its ad inventories, Hulu still struggles to get viewers to its site, much less run profitably.\n\nOne boost to the flagging revenue outlook for this market may well come from online video advertising markets, particularly mobile video markets. While the top players, including Google, keep busy monetizing on previous acquisitions, we expect the scores of smaller players to get snapped up. Among those that might find themselves on a shopping list: VC-backed Qik, which streams live TV and video to mobile phones and enables users to upload content to social networking websites; a similar startup, Myframe’s Flixwagon, which has partnered with MTV Israel; and finally, decentral.tv’s Kyte.tv, based in San Francisco, is streaming video on the iPhone. If any of the big online advertising platforms want to go wireless, we expect they will probably take a close look at one or more of these startups.\n\nSelected Google online advertising deals\n\nSource: The 451 M&A KnowledgeBase"
