AOL has acquired independent affiliate network Buy.at. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Buy.at is the fifth advertising acquisition AOL has made in the past year. Last year, AOL acquired Quigo, a contextual advertising firm; Tacoda, a behavioral targeting firm; Third Screen Media, a mobile advertising network; and AdTech AG, an international online ad-serving company based in Frankfurt, Germany.

AOL acquired Lightningcast, a video advertising platform, in 2006 and display ad network Advertising.com in 2004. To round it all out, Buy.at has e-commerce marketing programs for advertisers and publishers.

The firm will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Advertising.com, part of AOLâ€™s Platform-A organization.

Buy.at has about 70 employees in its offices, which span across the UK and the US.
