NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AOL today announced that it has completed its acquisition of Quigo, a leading site and content-targeted advertising company. The acquisition of Quigo lets AOL expand the use of contextual advertising â€“ which matches ads to the contents of a Web page â€“ across AOL's own Web pages, as well as its third-party networks. Quigo will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of AOL within its Platform-A organization. AOL originally announced its intention to acquire Quigo on November 7, 2007.

Founded in 2000, Quigo provides innovative, performance marketing solutions for advertisers and premium publishers. The company has more than 500 premium publisher relationships, including a recently finalized deal with Time, Inc., and has a broad network of roughly 3,000 advertisers. Quigo's AdSonar technology lets advertisers purchase ads on Websites based on specific pages, sections, topics or keywords. In addition, Quigo operates FeedPoint, a search engine marketing business that helps local and retail advertisers efficiently manage their marketing relationships with search engines and comparison shopping platforms.

"This acquisition comes as interest in contextual advertising is climbing rapidly," said AOL Chairman and CEO Randy Falco. "Quigo is an important part of our new Platform-A organization that we announced in September. Our goal is to have the most sophisticated set of targeting tools, the ability to deliver ads on multiple platforms, including video and mobile, to power the world's largest advertising display network."

Quigo is the fourth advertising company AOL has acquired in 2007. Earlier in the year, AOL acquired Third Screen Media, a leader in mobile advertising, ADTECH, a leading ad serving platform based in Frankfurt, Germany, and TACODA, a leading behavioral targeting company. Platform-A reaches over 90% of the online audience.

Quigo, based in New York, employs approximately 100 people. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
