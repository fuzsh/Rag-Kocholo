        "text": "Location: Shibuya, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo\n\nOwner: Aoyama Gakuin\n\nRenovation: October 2019\n\nSeats: 856\n\nAoyama Gakuin High School Chapel is located in the school building that was completely renovated in 2019.\n\nIn the chapel, sermons that nurture the spirit of respect for others and hymns that envelop the mind and body like an echo of comforting melody. The first thing you see when you enter is the colorful stained-glass window, the pipe organ and the cross, which are the symbol of the chapel. The left and right walls supporting the vaulted ceiling are fitted with windows that let in natural light, creating a sacred and gentle atmosphere of worship space.\n\nThe 856-seat chapel, where high school students can gather, is lined with simple, compact wooden chairs. Unlike theatre chairs, where you can relax and enjoy the view, you can sit comfortably with your spine naturally stretched, which is suitable for a place of worship.\n\nThe height of the backrest is set lower than that of a normal chair to match the chapel space. At the back there is a shelf made of the same material as the tabletop, on which the Bible and hymnals can be stored. By placing a urethane foam pad on the seating surface, seating comfort is improved, and the environment allows you to concentrate more on worship. Because it is equipped with an automatic stand-up mechanism that allows the seat to tip-up when you leave your seat, you can stand up smoothly during worship. The elbow pads on both sides of the seat make the space for one person clear.\n\nThe tabletop with natural beech wood on the surface, the wooden part finished in a soft medium color, the woven upholstery in brown and the coordinated chair with black fittings are like part of the architecture. It blends in with the solemn atmosphere of the chapel."
