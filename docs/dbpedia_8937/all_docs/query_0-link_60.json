IF SO WE WILL COME TO YOU.\n\n1. PURPOSE\n\nMost of our students are businessmen and their wives, who stay in Japan only 2 or 3 years. For people like this we suggest studying conversational Japanese first and then learning how to read and write.\n\n2.

We have both romanized and hiragana textbooks. In Book 1, you will learn basic Japanese sentence patterns. We have carefully selected those essential words and patterns with which you can express yourself in everyday conversation. If you are an intermediate student, we teach you colloquial Japanese, not “Gaijin Japanese”. This means not only that you can speak colloquial Japanese, but that you can understand what Japanese are talking about. Additionally, special textbooks for economic terms and selected newspaper articles are used in providing specialized instruction.\n\n4. INSTRUCTORS\n\n45 experienced instructors, all university graduates, are ready to come and teach you. All instructors can speak either English or other foreign languages, so they can give you direction in your study of Japanese.\n\n5.

We will come by whenever you want and show you how we teach and discuss your schedule and specific needs.\n\nPlease contact us for detail.\n\nFees\n\n9：00～19：00 ￥4,800 ～￥5,700 (one lesson is 60 minutes)\n\nSupport\n\nYou want to go to a hospital? You lost your wallet? Want to know which train to take? …We could support even your smallest favors. Don’t hesitate to consult your teachers if you have problems or questions.\n\nStudent support\n\nEvery semester, we have individual check-ins with students. We mainly talk about how your studies are going, but we also listen to your concerns and give advice on how you can focus more on your studies.\n\nPaths after graduation\n\nThere are various paths graduates can take – moving to higher education or seeking employment in Japan, or returning to their home countries and make use of their Japanese language skills. At Aoyama School, we prioritize the students’ aspirations and provide catered support.\n\nLifestyle support\n\nIf you are enrolled in the long term course and need to process the following, our school staff will accompany and assist you.\n\nResidence registration・National Health Insurance enrollment\n\nA residence card is required.\n\nThese procedures must be completed within 14 days of moving into the long term place of stay in Japan.\n\nOpening a bank account\n\nOur school staff will accompany you and assist in opening your Japanese bank account.\n\nHousing Support\n\nAoyama school will introduce housing options.
