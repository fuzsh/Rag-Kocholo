        "text": "The important thing to ask yourself is, \"What comes next?\"\n\nOn January 10th the organizers of the Feb. 4 Beppu-Oita Mainichi Marathon announced their field for this year's race. Among the general division entrants is Aoi Ota, the Aoyama Gakuin University 3rd-year who ran down leader Komazawa University on the Hakone Ekiden's Third Stage to play a critical role in Aoyama Gakuin's upset win. Head coach Susumu Hara has floated the possibility of Ota running 2:04 at Beppu-Oita. This was the 7th Hakone title in the last ten years for AGU, but what's strange is that not a single member of those champion teams has gone on to make a Japanese national team at the two Olympics or five World Championships that have happened since AGU's era began.\n\nOne recent example is Shungo Yokota, now of the JR Higashi Corporate Team. Just before his graduation from AGU last year, Yokota was 4th overall and 2nd Japanese at the 2023 Beppu-Oita Mainichi Marathon in a collegiate record 2:07:47. That qualified him for last October's MGC Race Paris Olympic marathon trials, but at the trials he was only 30th. In contrast, trials runner-up Akira Akasaki, 25 and running for Kyudenko, ran Hakone all four years at the minor Takushoku University team during the period in which AGU scored its third through fifth Hakone wins.\n\nOne corporate team coach weighed in on AGU alumni's lack of progress post-graduation. \"There are several things to consider. Aoyama Gakuin athletes focus completely on the Hakone Ekiden, and for their four years of university they tailor their bodies according to Hakone's main demand of being ready to run a stage of around 20 km. This year they won half its ten stages. Over 20 km they have better speed and stamina than anyone, but when they enter the corporate leagues and have to refocus that ability on the 42 km full marathon where there isn't the same kind of mass popularity as at Hakone, it can be mentally and physically hard for them to make that transition.\"\n\n\"But in Ota's case, he said when he was a first year that he is going for the Paris Olympics, and he intends to go a different route from those who go on to the corporate leagues, and become a pro athlete. His way of thinking is like that of Suguru Osako, who left the corporate league, went abroad to learn and train, and operated as a pro. It's very interesting.\" The question is, will that be enough to him to earn the right to wear the Rising Sun?\n\nsource article:\n\ntranslated and edited by Brett Larner\n\nLabels\n\nWe've been busy the last few days working with the Mongolian marathon team at the Paris Olympics. Catching up on the Japanese national team's performances over the last 3 days of athletics competition, the big news was of course world champion Haruka Kitaguchi scoring Japan's first and only medal in Paris, gold in the javelin on her first throw. In the final evening session on Saturday Kitaguchi came out swinging with a season best 65.80 m first throw that left the rest of the field fighting for silver. South African Jo-Ane Van Dyk came closest to Kitaguchi's mark at 63.93 m, just holding off Czech Nikola Ogrodnikova for silver by 25 cm. Japan's other javelin finalist Momone Ueda was 10th with a season best 61.64 m throw. Kitaguchi's gold was the first-ever for a female Japanese athlete in the javelin throw and the first by any Japanese athlete since Mizuki Noguchi in the Athens Olympics marathon. Kitaguchi was seriously burned by the JAAF's massive 90%\n\nNext weekend's Hokkaido Marathon has a good men's field lined up, with five sub-2:10 men and some interesting matchups. At the front is 2024 Osaka Marathon winner Kiyoto Hirabayashi , the winners of the 2024 and 2022 Beppu-Oita Mainichi Marathon Derese Workneh and Yuki Nakamura , and 2023 Beppu-Oita runner-up Atsumi Ashiwa , with threats from two other race winners, 2022 Hokkaido champ Luka Musembi and Tokyo Olympics marathon trials winner Shogo Nakamura . Sub-61 half marathoner Kazuki Matsuyama is scheduled to debut, and if he or Hirabayashi actually start it will give the race a very different dynamic. The women's field is thinner, but 2018 World Half Marathon Championships bronze medalist Pauline Kamulu is on the list to make her debut. If she's for real nobody else in the field can touch her. If not, it'll probably be a head-to-head between the only sub-2:30 woman in the race, Yuri Mitsune , and Nanami Aoki , 2:30:01 on Osaka last year. Shiho Tachizako is\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
