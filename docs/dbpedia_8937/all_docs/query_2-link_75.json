        "text": "\"This year is an Olympic year, but is the Hakone Ekiden really helping Japanese athletics develop?\" \"Students are not running the Hakone Ekiden because of the Olympics!\" This exchange happened in a video on the ABEMA News Youtube channel between comedian Shigeo Takahashi of comedy duo Savannah, and Susumu Hara, head coach of Aoyama Gakuin University which had won the Hakone Ekiden for the seventh time three weeks earlier. Speaking with tremendous energy, Hara went on:\n\n\"If you think about it rationally, fundamentally the only people who would say they are interested in the Olympics are Japanese people. Japanese are the ones who place so much importance on the Olympics. If you go to the U.S., they have football and basketball. Our press conference after winning this time was an Olympic-level event. There were 50 or 60 news media companies there, a hundred of them, and all the reporters were clamoring for quotes. That has nothing to do with the Olympics. The Hakone Ekiden is such a stellar product that it's its own thing, a part of Japan's unique culture, and if that's what you want to go for then go for it. If you want to end it there and move on, end it there and move on. The idea of trying to tie this to the Olympics is one that belongs to a developing country.\"\n\nThe 100th Hakone Ekiden broadcast pulled in viewership ratings of 26.1% for its first day on Jan. 2 and 28.3% on its second day on Jan. 3. Viewership numbers are in this range around 30% every year. The Hakone Ekiden is often accused of being responsible for \"burnout syndrome\" and blamed for Japan's lack of successful Olympic marathoners, but Japanese people should take more pride in the value of their road relays, a uniquely Japanese sports culture.\n\nTranslator's note: Not a single athlete coached by Hara has ever made a World Championships or Olympic team. Part of the context of his comments was a statement by Atsushi Fujita, head coach of 2023 Hakone winner Komazawa University, after losing to Aoyama Gakuin this year. \"It's disappointing to lose,\" Fujita told reporters after the race, \"but we're thinking about more than just Hakone.\" Almost immediately after Hara's comments were public, Komazawa's Keita Sato ran 13:09.45, an indoor 5000 m national record and 2nd-fastest-ever time by a Japanese man, at the Boston University John Thomas Classic.\n\nDespite saying the above, Hara pulled Aoi Ota, who beat Sato to win Hakone's Third Stage this year in the equivalent of a 58:57 half marathon, from his planned marathon debut at this weekend's Beppu-Oita Mainichi Marathon claiming he wasn't feeling well after having floated the idea Ota could run 2:03 in his debut, and is expected to run him instead at the Osaka Marathon where based on his Hakone performance he would have a realistic shot at clearing the 2:05:50 standard to take the 3rd spot on the Paris Olympic Marathon team.\n\nsource article:\n\ntranslated by Brett Larner\n\nLabels\n\nWe've been busy the last few days working with the Mongolian marathon team at the Paris Olympics. Catching up on the Japanese national team's performances over the last 3 days of athletics competition, the big news was of course world champion Haruka Kitaguchi scoring Japan's first and only medal in Paris, gold in the javelin on her first throw. In the final evening session on Saturday Kitaguchi came out swinging with a season best 65.80 m first throw that left the rest of the field fighting for silver. South African Jo-Ane Van Dyk came closest to Kitaguchi's mark at 63.93 m, just holding off Czech Nikola Ogrodnikova for silver by 25 cm. Japan's other javelin finalist Momone Ueda was 10th with a season best 61.64 m throw. Kitaguchi's gold was the first-ever for a female Japanese athlete in the javelin throw and the first by any Japanese athlete since Mizuki Noguchi in the Athens Olympics marathon. Kitaguchi was seriously burned by the JAAF's massive 90%\n\nNext weekend's Hokkaido Marathon has a good men's field lined up, with five sub-2:10 men and some interesting matchups. At the front is 2024 Osaka Marathon winner Kiyoto Hirabayashi , the winners of the 2024 and 2022 Beppu-Oita Mainichi Marathon Derese Workneh and Yuki Nakamura , and 2023 Beppu-Oita runner-up Atsumi Ashiwa , with threats from two other race winners, 2022 Hokkaido champ Luka Musembi and Tokyo Olympics marathon trials winner Shogo Nakamura . Sub-61 half marathoner Kazuki Matsuyama is scheduled to debut, and if he or Hirabayashi actually start it will give the race a very different dynamic. The women's field is thinner, but 2018 World Half Marathon Championships bronze medalist Pauline Kamulu is on the list to make her debut. If she's for real nobody else in the field can touch her. If not, it'll probably be a head-to-head between the only sub-2:30 woman in the race, Yuri Mitsune , and Nanami Aoki , 2:30:01 on Osaka last year. Shiho Tachizako is\n\nA 20-year-old man has been arrested on charges of sexually assaulting a female runner along the banks of the Tama River in Ota Ward, Tokyo. \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go for a walk and move my body a bit,\" the man told police. Local resident Hirai Muroyama , 20, of no known occupation, was arrested on charges of sexual assault. He is accused of acts including grabbing the breasts of a woman in her 20s at around 10 p.m. on May 31 along the banks of the Tama River. According to police, the woman was taking a break in her run when Muroyama approached her silently from behind and grabbed her breasts before running away. Under police interrogation Muroyama told investigators, \"I've been stuck at home because of the coronavirus, so I wanted to go out for a walk and move my body. I'd had a few drinks and was feeling pretty hype. She was totally my type.\" source article: https://news.tbs.co.jp/newseye/tbs_newsey"
