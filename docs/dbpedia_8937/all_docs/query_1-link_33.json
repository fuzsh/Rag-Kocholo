It was wonderful \"Blended Mobility\" for staff(!) -- learned a lot from Todd Shumway on US Education system. Thank you (a big mahalo) for choosing Kansai University! It is considered a part of our new initiative JIGE (Japan hub for Innovative Global Education) 2023-2028. For those from our partner universities, if you are thinking of doing a short staff stay with us, on sabbatical or JSPS, or other resources available out there, we will be happy to consider hosting. International Education 2.0 (Shall we say Education 4.0) needs lots of capacity building among the teachers and staff-- why do something new and stick to it, if you are not quite sure what it is for? They need to know and believe that it is something worth paying effort for. \"Why\" + \"How\" and \"What\" -- golden combination of all three pieces are in need, none of them should be missed out. Staff exchange and faculty communication are great ways to do so; internationalization is not just with students. #IIGE #internationaleducation #COIL #JIGE\n\nVirtuEU - one of my greatest academic challenges so far?

It’s the largest \"gaokao\" ever held in China. 👇 📖 Gaokao is a standardised test, a prerequisite for entrance into all universities in China. It lasts about 9 hours over 2-3 days. 📖 Chinese students spend years preparing for the difficult exam, as a high score is needed for top universities. Unlike the SAT in the US, students in China usually get only one chance to take it. 📖 Last year, only 3% of exam-takers in Guangdong scored over 600. What’s happening in preparation? ✅ Several provinces this year have installed facial-recognition scanners to prevent candidates from cheating. ✅ In Beijing, traffic police were on the streets by 6 a.m. to manage traffic near a school by the Summer Palace. ✅ In Shanghai, taxi dispatch centres began accepting bookings for exam students a week ago. ❗️ Chinese social media was flooded with good-luck messages, with \"gaokao\" trending on Weibo. Many celebrities, both Chinese and international, also posted well-wishes for exam takers. Good luck to all the kids today!

This system, which lasted for over a millennium from the Sui Dynasty (581-618) until the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), was designed to select the most capable candidates based on merit rather than birthright. Key Aspects of the Imperial Examination System: - Intense Preparation: Candidates often began their studies at a young age, dedicating years to mastering the Confucian classics, history, literature, and philosophy. - Multiple Levels of Examinations: The system included several levels of exams, starting at the county level and progressing to provincial and national levels. - High Stakes: Success in these exams could elevate individuals from obscurity to positions of significant power and influence. The title of Zhuangyuan (状元), awarded to the top scorer in the highest-level examination, was particularly esteemed. Challenges and Difficulties: - Rigorous Standards: The exams were notoriously difficult, with low pass rates. Only a small fraction of candidates would succeed at each level. - Intense Pressure: The social and familial pressure to succeed was immense, often leading to significant personal and financial sacrifices. - Physical and Mental Toll: The demanding nature of the exams, combined with the lengthy periods of study and isolation, could take a substantial toll on candidates' well-being. The legacy of the Zhuangyuan in ancient China underscores the profound and lasting impact of the imperial examination system on Chinese culture and society. While the specific mechanisms have evolved, the underlying values of diligence, academic excellence, and the pursuit of top honors remain vibrant. This enduring tradition continues to shape the aspirations and achievements of individuals and the nation as a whole, reflecting a timeless commitment to education and intellectual growth. All the best in your educational endeavors and the pursuit of excellence, inspired by the rich heritage of the Zhuangyuan! ＃education #educationsystem\n\n𝗡𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗴𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗛𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗲𝗿 𝗘𝗱𝘂𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗥𝗨𝗛𝗦𝗖 🎯🇯🇵 Higher Study in Japan (Part 01) Why would you want to study in Japan?
