Mr. Cheetham has very wide knowledge of the flora and has been connected for so long with all aspects of the work of the Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union that no one could have been found better able to undertake the work of extracting all reliable data from the late Dr. Lees’s manuscript and from the records of the Union. Dr. Sledge has added very many recent records and has revised all the material in the light of the most recent developments in nomenclature and grouping of genera. The volume includes a complete list of the recorded species, including aliens, casuals and escapes which are dis- tinguished typographically from natives, with new recorded localities and points of interest concerning changes in distri- bution. This cheap and relatively small volume does great credit to the amount of work put into its preparation in order to condense the material to valuable essentials. — Nature.

Presidential Address to the Yorkshire Naturalists' Union, December $th, 1942 First of all I would like to express my appreciation of the honour the Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union have done me by electing me President, and at the same time say how sorry I am that I have not been able to fulfil my duties as I should have wished. Very soon after I had accepted your invitation I was appointed to the Regius Chair of Natural History in the University of Aberdeen and carried so far away from your activities ; with the present limitations on travelling I have not been able to attend your meetings since going north in April. While I have gone so far away I am very glad that I am not cutting myself off from Yorkshire entirely. I have been made Honorary Director of Oceano- graphical Investigations in the University College of Hull, so that after the war I shall keep in close touch with the progress of the researches which we have been developing during the last ten years, and which are being continued under the headship of Dr. C. E. Lucas, senior member of my research staff. Thus when marine research again becomes possible and travelling less restricted, I hope to make frequent visits to Yorkshire and shall look forward to keeping myself in touch with your new developments in ecology which I shall watch with the greatest interest. I have chosen the subject for my address partly because I have felt that you would, with your interest in ecology, like to hear something of the workings of ecological methods in fields rather different from those in which you are engaged, and partly I thought it would be appropriate, in addition to a general picture of the development of planktology, to give some account of the work my colleagues and I have been doing here in Yorkshire from the University College of Hull. It is good, from time to time, to pause and look at one’s work against the back- ground of what has gone before. It helps one to realise how much. one is indebted To the workers who have preceded one, and if I should be devoting a good deal of time to the work that has been done from my laboratories, I would like to emphasise that this work is, of course, built upon the foundations laid by the earlier pioneers and under the influence of the work going on in other marine stations at the present time. Let me begin by presenting in the merest outline a general sketch of the economy of the sea in its simplest form. We have the rays of the sun penetrating the upper layers of the water, we have oxygen and carbon dioxide dissolved into the water from the atmosphere, we have mineral salts brought in, of course, by the erosion of the land and spread throughout its mass. Here we have ideal conditions for the growth of plant life. Along our coasts we see the luxuriant growth of sea weeds but they extend only to very moderate depths, they form but a fringe and would be quite insufficient to support the vast populations of animals in the sea. If we think of the millions and millions of herrings taken from the sea every year by our drifters, the thousands of tons of bottom-living fish pulled up in the trawl and then the hosts of all manner of invertebrate life that swarm over the sea floor, we will realise that there must be an enormous production of plant life to support all this quantity of animals. The bulk of the plant life in the sea is invisible to the naked eye and was not discovered until just about a hundred years ago. It was in the early 1840’s that Johannes Muller began for the first time to use a little fine gauze net pulled through the surface layers of the sea. It at once revealed an amazing new world of life. The water was shown to be teeming with plants only visible through the microscope. On these tiny plants were found to feed hosts of tiny animals, some almost as small as the plants, but others just big enough to be seen as little specks in the water. These are the organisms, both plant and animals, to which we give the name of plankton, but many years passed before they received this name. G. O. Sars, the Norwegian naturalist, Edward Forbes in this country, to be followed by Sir Wvville Thomson, were enthusiastic users of this little ‘ tow net,’ as it is called. In the 1870’s came the great Challenger expedition which marked the birth of true oceanography. Sailing in 1943 January -Marcl^^ ~ £ tiS4S‘ A 2 Plankton Ecology in the Service of Man all the oceans of the world, in the tropical seas and as far south as the Antarctic Circle, they sampled the small life of the plankton and brought back material the description of which has filled so many of the great Challenger reports. Other nations followed, and in the nineties came the special German plankton expedition, under the leadership of Victor Hensen. It was he who gave the name ‘ plankton ’ to this category of life, including both the animals and the plants in a general term to signify all those forms which are passively drifted by the ocean currents and tides in contradistinction to those forms which can actively swim against the currents, such as fish and whales, which he called the Neckton. ‘ Plankton ’ is simply the Greek word meaning ‘ that which is drifted.’ The little plants are mainly diatoms and flagellates of various kinds with beautiful devices for pre- venting them sinking, their surfaces drawn out into long spines or their bodies flattened to ribbon-like dimensions, presenting as large a surface as possible to support them. Among the animals we find almost every great phylum of the animal kingdom represented. There are Protozoa of many kinds, particularly the Radiolaria and Foraminifera. We see medusae in countless forms from the small hydromedusae to the large jellyfish. There are planktonic worms, planktonic molluscs such as the Pteropoda, planktonic tunicates and the vertebrates them- selves are represented by the young stages of fish. Fish when they first hatch out are truly members of the plankton, drifting with the currents before they get their powers of active swimming. But by far the most important group of all is the Crustacea ; the smaller forms of which, particularly the Copepoda, swarm in the sea as insects do on land. There are very many different species not only at the surface, but some extending into great depths. There are a few marine Cladocera, many planktonic Amphipoda, and the Euphausiaceans play a very important part in the ecology of the polar plankton, they form the food of the great whales. Let us return for a moment to the sketch I was drawing of the economy of the sea. A number of fish, such as the herring, sprat and mackerel, feed directly on these little plankton animals. Then from this world of drifting life there is continually falling a rain of dead and dying material towards the seabed, and here we find hosts of animals adapted in different ways to catch this falling rain of food. Some stretch out arms, umbrella-like, others have specially constructed sieves to separate the smallest particles of organic material from the water. These sedentary filter-feeding organisms are then preyed upon by the more active crawling invertebrates. Both these and some of the filter feeders form a rich food for the fish which congregate on the bottom, fish such as cod, haddock, plaice, turbot, etc. Then comes Man with his miles of drifting herring nets, his trawl sweeping the sea floor, and his powerful modern whale catcher with explosive harpoon shooting the great Rorquals for oil. All this wealth of food and oil taken from the sea is ultimately dependent upon the plankton. It is not surprising, therefore, that he has begun to realise the importance of the scientific study of the seas. The beginning of this century saw the foundation of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the different nations of Europe taking part in one great plan to explore the life in the waters north-west of Europe, not only studying the fish themselves, their life histories, rates of growth, migrations, feeding habits, etc., but investigating the distribution of this all-important plankton and the physical and chemical causes underlying its production. Actually the importance of this drifting life in the economics of the sea was realised somewhat earlier. In the nineties Victor Hensen, whom I have already mentioned as coining the word ‘ plankton,’ founded his school of planktology at Kiel. He was the first to introduce quantitative methods into plankton research. That I always feel was the beginning of real ecology. It was taking a step from descrip- tive natural history, the recording and cataloguing of the different species found, to actual numerical estimations and so placing the study upon a quantitative basis. He developed methods for the calculation of the number of organisms in a given volume of sea water. He devised nets which could be drawn up vertically through the sea and so constructed that they would filter a column of water of known diameter ; then when all the little organisms caught in the jar at the end of the net were estimated one could compare the relative numbers of animals and plants in different parts of the sea, expressed in terms of organisms per cubic metre of sea water. In this way he believed it possible to estimate the total productivity of sea water. Applying the method to estimating the numbers of floating eggs of a fish like the plaice in known volumes of water in different parts The Naturalis t Plankton Ecology in the Service of Man 3 of the sea, he estimated the actual population of these fish in the sea. In this he has been frequently attacked on erroneous grounds, it being thought that he estimated the number of fish from the number of eggs that were likely to develop ; we know that the mortality of eggs is great and may vary from year to year, but that was not what he was doing. He was basing the estimate of the population on the number of eggs that are known to be laid by an average female fish. While speaking of this I should refer to an earlier and, indeed, perhaps the first contribution of planktology to the service of Man. In the sixties of last century when there was that great expansion of the trawl fisheries in the North Sea using larger and larger trawls, there was an outcry by a section of the industry demanding a limitation to the size of the trawl, on the grounds that these large trawls would be destroying the spawn of the fish which was believed to be laid on the sea bed, and a Royal Commission was set up to investigate the matter. Just at that time the Norwegian naturalist, G. O. Sars, whom I mentioned earlier, first showed that fish such as the cod, haddock, plaice, etc., do not lay eggs on the sea bed, but eggs floating in the plankton. The fears for the destruction of the spawn were groundless. Of the commercial fish, it is curious that the herring, which is caught in surface nets, should be one of the very few which lays its eggs on the bottom. The quantitative work of Victor Hensen and his colleagues had a profound influence on the development of planktology. Actually, as I shall explain later, the methods upon which he based his hope of forming estimates of the actual production of organic matter in different areas of the sea were open to criticism, but nevertheless his work marks a great step in the development of true ecology. I have already referred to his special plankton expedition ; it had the important result of demonstrating that the plankton is actually richer in polar and temperate seas than it is in the waters of the tropics, a result which was a surprise to most naturalists. It accounts, of course, for the development of the greater fisheries in temperate seas and particularly in the polar regions where we see to-day our trawlers steaming from Hull and Grimsby to the Arctic seas and the whaling fleet going south to the Antarctic. As part of the general programme of the International Council for the Explora- tion of the Sea a survey of the plankton of the North Sea and adjacent waters was made by the research ships of a number of different nations, taking quarterly samples at very many different points throughout a period of years from 1902 to 1908 and the results published in the Bulletin Planktonique . Many workers were engaged in analysing the vast number of samples obtained. So we came to have a very good knowledge of the planktonic flora and fauna of our waters. Whilst this was work over a wide area, an important series of more confined observations were undertaken by Sir William Herdman and his colleagues at the Port Erin Biological Station, which he founded in the Isle of Man. .Starting in 1907 he had weekly tow nettings taken across the bay at Port Erin until the close of 1920, giving a mass of material from which could be studied the seasonal changes in the plankton week by week over a number of consecutive years. This period was the great descriptive phase. The next period, which has been so unhappily interrupted by the present conflict, is marked by the development of the more physiological and ecological aspects of research. Particularly noteworthy have been the contributions from the Marine Laboratory at Plymouth, where the work of Dr. Atkins and Dr. Harvey have thrown so much light on the conditions underlying the annual production of planktonic life. From the work of Sir William Herdman and others it had become abundantly clear that there was a marked cycle of events in the sea as the year passed. The spring was heralded by a great outburst of plant life in March and April, followed by an increase in the animal plankton. It was then a matter of surprise that as spring passed to summer and the sunlight increased the plant life instead of in- creasing in bulk actually declined, until at mid-summer or a little later there was usually a distinct scarcity of plant plankton. It was realised, of course, that the animals were feeding on the plants and so would be using them up ; but these little plants can multiply by simple division at a much greater rate than the animals, which have a prolonged life cycle, so that one might have expected them to keep pace with and even exceed the demands of the animal populations. It was further found that as the season advanced and autumn came there was often a second outbust of plant growth, not usually so great as that of the spring, but I943 January -March 4 Plankton Ecology in the Service of Man nevertheless one of considerable magnitude. Then both the plants and animals die down during the winter. The Plymouth workers, Atkins and Harvey, have shown us the reason for this cycle of events. In the spring, as the intensity of the sunlight increases and the sea warms up, there is, as one would expect, a great increase in plant growth. Now, just as on the land, plants in the sea are dependent for their growth upon certain mineral salts, particularly the phosphates and nitrates which are present in sea water in strictly limited quantities (in our own waters only about 40 mgs. per cubic metre). The plant growth depending on photosynthesis is limited to the upper lays of water where the sunlight is strong enough ; the sun’s rays being rapidly absorbed by the water as one goes deeper. As the summer advances these upper layers of the water become warmed and so lighter, and very sharply separated from the colder water below. As the plants multiply they use up the available phosphates and nitrates and themselves become the food of animals which in turn are either eaten by other animals or die so that their bodies sink towards the bottom. Thus as the season advances the phosphates and nitrates are being removed from the upper layers of the water and locked up in the bodies of animals which pass into the larger bodies of fish or sink to the lower layers. At the bottom the dead bodies decay and the phosphates and nitrates are returned to the water through the action of bacteria. Now this dis- continuity layer, or thermocline as it is called, separating the warmer surface waters from the cooler deeper layers, prevents the phosphates and nitrates coming up into the surface waters to replace the salts that have been taken out by the plants. Thus as the summer advances the gradually impoverished surface layers are no longer able to support an abundant plant growth and so it dies down, and it is not until the autumn, when the surface waters become cooled, that a mixing with the lower layers is possible. Such a mixing is now promoted by the onset of the equinoxal gales, which stir up the waters and once again bring the phosphates and nitrates towards the surface. This results in the secondary autumnal outburst of plant life which exists so long as there is sufficient sunlight for growth. As we pass into winter the sun sinks lower in the sky and the rays penetrate so much the less that photosynthesis is reduced to a minimum and the plant life dies down to a low ebb, being carried forward usually by resting stages awaiting the next awakening of spring. On the more ecological side we have the plankton investigations undertaken in direct relation to the fisheries by the Government research stations of the Ministry of Fisheries at Lowestoft and the Fishery Board for Scotland at Aberdeen. The work we have developed at Hull, which I am going to describe, is an offshoot of work begun at Lowestoft, where I gained my first experience of planktology when I was Assistant Naturalist to the Ministry of Fisheries. There I became specially interested in the relation of the herring to its animate environment, both its food organisms and its enemies. I started by making a detailed study of the food of the herring. The fish which are landed at port, having been dead some hours, are useless for stomach examination, the contents are too far decomposed. A system of collecting herring stomachs from freshly killed fish was developed. Numbers of steam drifters taking part in the work were provided with bottles of formalin. As they gutted their freshly caught fish for breakfast they dropped the heads and guts into the formalin, adding a label with the date, and the bottles were eventually collected at the port. Thus we got regular samples from many different boats throughout the seasons. Each stomach was examined in the laboratory and the contents recorded. I also examined large numbers of the young stages of the herring from just after they had hatched out, lost their yolk sacs, and started to feed, taking first small plants and then small Crustacea. From this work I drew up a diagram- matic representation of the food links between the herring at its different ages and the different members of the plankton community, and added the results of other workers showing the food relationships between certain members of the plankton. We see that as the young herring gets older it starfs to take the small Crustacea, the copepods, and for an important part of its life, the early post-larval stage, it is dependent almost entirely upon one species of copepod : Pseudocalanus. Here we see probably one of the critical periods in the life of the fish. We know, particularly from the more recent work I shall presently describe, how the numbers of these little copepods fluctuate from year to year. Some years they may be very much more abundant than in others. In the years of scarcity the mortality of the The Naturalist Plankton Ecology in the Service of Man 5 young herring may well be much larger than in years of plenty. Such fluctuations in the plankton may well reflect themselves in the fluctuations in the numbers of fish which will be coming into the feeding and spawning shoals fished by the industry some three, four, and five years later. We see, too, from the work of Dr. Marie Lebour at Plymouth, that the very young herring itself forms the food of certain carnivorous plankton animals, small medusae, ctenophores such as Pleurobrachia, and the chaetognath worms, Sagitta. The ctenophores, Pleuro- brachia, sometimes occur in prodigious numbers in the areas where the young herring fry are coming up into the surface waters. Sometimes the stomach of one Pleurobrachia may contain the remains of five or six larval herring. A year of exceptional abundance of Pleurobrachia must mean a very much heavier mortality amongst the larval herring. Examining the stomachs of adult fish throughout the year one saw a distinct wave in the activity of feeding. A curve drawn representing the percentage of stomachs found containing food will show a steep rise in March and April, reaching a peak in May and June and then falling away more gradually through the summer to a low level in September, and then a period of winter when scarcely any feeding takes place at all. The herrings are building up a food reserve in the form of fat from the abundance of animal plankton that follows the spring maximum of plants to carry them through the winter period of scarcity until again the animal plankton increases in the following spring. This wave of feeding is reflected in the growth of the fish. During the winter the fish stops growing, but as spring advances into summer the rate of growth accelerates and then it falls off again towards the autumn. The curve of feeding and the curve of growth increments month by month show a close parallelism. They effect the scales of the fish ; each year the scale grows a little more and then stops growing. In winter the cessation of growth is registered as a line on the scale, a ring separating one season’s growth from the next. It is these rings which can be read to give the age of the fish just like the annual rings in the trunk of a tree. Each scale, as it has been said, is the herring’s birth certificate. This ready method of age determination has played an important part in fishery investigations, enabling one to analyse stocks of fish into their component age groups, and so reveal marked fluctuations in the numbers of fish of different ages. We see that the stock reared in one year may fall very far short of that reared in another year. This is not due to the quantities of eggs spawned, for we see clearly that one abundant year class of fish does not by any means necessarily give rise to another abundant year class ; it reflects, most likely, differences in the animate environment of the baby fish. The autumn of 1921, when I started these herring food investigations, was a bad herring season, the fish were not being taken in their usual quantities. When out on a herring drifter I took samples with a tow net and found that the water was thick with a great production of the diatom, Rhizosolenia styliformis . So thick that the net had its meshes clogged and was slimy with it. The skipper said that they called it ‘ weedy water,’ or ‘ Dutchman’s baccy juice water,’ and knew they were unlikely to catch fish in it. In the next season I started experimenting with a little instrument I have called the plankton indicator, a little torpedo -shaped device open at each end to allow the water to flow through it. It was designed to be taken down by a weighted rope when towed behind a drifter. Before being thrown out a small gauze disc was placed in the slot across the water tunnel so that it sieved out the plankton as it was towed along. Fishermen were asked to use this instrument to take a sample of the plankton where they fished and then to wrap up the disc after they had used it and drop it into a tin containing formalin. Then after they had shot their nets and hauled them again they filled in a printed label giving the date, position, and the number of herring caught. The idea was to get a series of samples of the plankton together with records of the catch of fish so to obtain definite experimental evidence as to whether the fishermen’s belief in the poor catches in this so-called ‘ weedy water ’ was actually a fact or not. It was first tried out in the autumn of 1922. I only obtained twelve records with it that season. The number was very low but the results were remarkably significant. In six of those twelve hauls the indicator disc was quite clean, in the other six it was coloured a distinct green colour by the presence of quantities of the tiny plants, I the phytoplankton, this time not the diatom, Rhizosolenia , but a colonial flagellate, Phceocystis . The six herring catches corresponding to the clean discs were 17, 1943 January -March 6 Plankton Ecology in the Service of Man 15, I5> 3°, 3°, an(i 45 crans (a cran is a volumetric measure for roughly a thousand fish). The catches corresponding to the six green discs were 2, 3, 3, 3, and 6 crans. We see that all the catches which were in clear water were over 15 crans with an average of 25, whereas all the catches with a green disc were not greater than 6 crans, with an average of 3. The odds against such a clear-cut result being due to chance are of the order of eight million to one. It is as if one had taken coins and tossed them over a bit of paper marked in some places green and the other places white, and all the heads had fallen on the white ground and all the tails on the green. It was not until I had been working for some little time on these lines that I came across the very interesting observations of Pearcey carried out in 1884 and recorded in a paper in the Royal Physical Society of Edinburgh. He made a voyage in one of the old sailing luggers from Leith round the Shetland Isles. He, too, was using a tow net in relation to the herring. He was doing exactly what I was trying to do, forty years before me, and it is surprising that his results were not better known to fishery investigators. He came across dense banks of diatoms so thick, he writes, ‘ that little heaps of the algae were formed on the deck as it dropped from the nets,’ and in each of these areas he caught hardly any herring. In the clear zones between, the herring catches were high. It seemed likely that the dense patches of phytoplankton, produced in the autumn in the southern North Sea, might play an important part in the success or failure of the East Anglian herring fisheries which extend from the end of September to the beginning of December. Mr. Savage, of the Ministry of Fisheries, and I therefore started a series of annual cruises in the research ship George Bligh to chart the extent of such patches during each autumn fishery. In 1924 I left the Ministry of Fisheries to join the first of the present series of Discovery expeditions to investigate the biology of the whales in the Antarctic, but Mr. Savage continued the autumn cruises and it was shown that these patches varied enormously in both size and position from year to year. Sometimes there were patches of Rhizosolenia, sometimes patches of Phceocystis , and at other times again patches of the diatom, Biddulphia sinensis, or sometimes areas of a mixture of Rhizosolenia and Biddulphia . Considerable evidence was obtained that when these patches occurred near to the main shoaling grounds the arrival of the herring was delayed and sometimes deflected from the normal grounds. In passing, it is an item of considerable ecological interest that this species of diatom, Biddulphia sinensis, is, as the name implies, a Chinese form common along the eastern coasts of Asia. It was not recorded in European waters until 1893, when it suddenly appeared in the Gulf of Hamburg, at first in small quantities but then spreading until now it has reached the dimensions of a dominant form, and one, as we have seen, of no little economic importance. It is believed to have been carried from China to Hamburg by some ship, and finding suitable conditions in the coastal waters of Europe it has spread apace. I now come to the work we have been developing here in Yorkshire at Hull. It has fallen under two main headings. First, I was anxious to try out again the small plankton indicator which I had begun to use at Lowestoft. In addition to its trial in the autumn fishery I had made fairly extensive trials of it in the summer Shields fishery in an attempt to establish whether or not any correlation could be found between the catches of the feeding shoals and the abundance of the animal plankton which was their food. The plankton is patchy ; it is known often to vary enormously in quantity and kind at points even quite short distances apart. No correlation was then established, but I then realised that the instrument, while efficient in the capture of the phytoplankton, was by no means so well adapted to the collection of the animal forms. Very often the weight failed to take it down properly below the surface. I therefore started the experiments all over again with a newly-designed indicator on the lines of a paravane, fitted with diving planes and stabilising tail so that it automatically dived below the surface and took up a position at about the depth that the herring nets are used. The experiment was carried out on a large scale, some 40 odd herring drifters taking part. The same system of supplying them with labels and tins of formalin was adopted. They were asked to use the instrument just before they reached the position at which it was intended to shoot their nets and to tow it for one mile up to their position for fishing. The experiments started in 1930 and extended until 1934. Over fourteen hundred records were obtained, records of catches of fish The Naturalist Plankton Ecology in the Service of Man 7 with corresponding samples of plankton for analysis. We divided the areas of fishing into regions separated by degrees of latitude and dealt with samples in half-monthly periods. We studied the correlations between herring and its most important food organism, the copepod , Cal anus finmarchicus . Having analysed the samples we tabulated them in ascending order of numbers of Calanus found, but we put them down in two columns, that on the left having half the number of samples with the lower Calanus values, those on the right the other half with the higher Calanus values. Then in another column opposite the Calanus figures we wrote down the corresponding quantities of herring caught. Thus we can total up the number of herring caught in the regions of poor Calanus water and compare it with the number caught in the richer 'Calanus water. For the whole of the Scottish, fisheries the catches in the higher Calanus water exceeded that in the poor Calanus water during fourteen periods ; the reverse was true in only four periods. The increase in the higher Calanus water was usually very considerable. We now wanted to find what would be the advantage if the herring skippers actually used the instrument as a means of guiding them towards richer feeding grounds. To get a fair estimate of this we took the average catch of herring for both the poor and the richer waters, thus giving us the average catch of fish they would have caught if fishing purely at random. We then took the average catch of fish obtained in half the samples that were in the richer Calanus water, and expressed the gain as a percentage of what they got when fishing at random. If they used the instrument to test the water as they steamed out from port and took samples every few miles and returned to fish at the region where they got the most Calanus, they should come into water that was distinctly above the average Calanus content. The gains shown in this way ranged from 4 per cent, to as much as 85 per cent., and including the four periods in which a definite loss would have been entailed, they gave an average percentage gain for the whole of the Scottish fisheries of 24.5% . That meant, by the systematic use of the instru- ment, although it would fail on certain occasions due to irregularities in the move- ments of the fish (sometimes they are swimming in search of food, sometimes they are collecting for spawning), it would increase the average yield per boat by some 25 per cent. In the Shields fisheries, where one is dealing at times with fish collecting for spawning, particularly in August, the results were not so good, but still they gave an average gain of 12.7 per cent. At the same time we had abundant evidence of the negative correlation between the herring and dense zones of phytoplankton which would give the fisherman a clear indication by a green coloured disc. The instrument has thus now become a commercial possi- bility. The green indication is at once obvious ; but to see the Calanus they drop the disc into a little frame carrying a lens powerful enough to give a good magnifica- tion of the copepods. They cannot mistake Calanus for anything else ; photo- graphs and discs with preserved Calanus on them are provided for comparison ; they soon learn to distinguish it. The more progressive skippers have taken up its use and express themselves as highly pleased with its results. The second and more important line of work wdiich has occupied us at Hull has been the study of the large-scale changes in the density and distribution of the plankton over wide stretches of the North Sea month by month for a number of years. The plankton varies from season to season and in no two years is it alike. The strength and path of ocean currents alter, as do the climatic and hydrological factors which may favour or discourage the growth of this or that species. These changes in the nature of the plankton have, as I have indicated, a profound influence upon the fisheries — and not only on the herring fisheries. The baby fry of the bottom living trawl-caught fish live for a time in the plankton, and, as with the herring, the fluctuations in the quantities of adult fish are likely to be due to varying quantities of suitable planktonic food for the fry in different years or to changes in its distribution. Again the animal life on the sea bed is, as -we have seen, fed by the supply of plankton from above, so that one may expect areas of rich plankton to give rise to areas of richer bottom -living food for trawl- caught fish ; changes in the distribution of these fish may prove to be linked with earlier changes in the distribution and density of the plankton. It has been our aim to study and record these major changes over wdde areas much as the meteorologist studies the changes in the distribution of centres of high and low- pressure in the atmosphere with a view to forecasting. We are 1943 J anuary -March a Plankton Ecology in the Service of Man building up a series of monthly charts of the changing plankton distributions for correlation with the changes in the fisheries with a view to a better understanding of the causes of fishery fluctuations and eventually in the hope of being able to forecast such fluctuations for the benefit of the industry. It is pioneer work and we must not expect results too quickly, but at the time when it was interrupted by the war it was already giving us a clear picture of the more important trends of events in the plankton of the North Sea. The charting is done from records obtained by automatic sampling machines that are towed behind ships crossing the North Sea on a number of regular routes. We call such a machine a continuous plankton recorder. It is torpedo shaped, and, like the little plankton indicator already described, fitted with diving planes which make it dive below the surface and swim at a standard depth. As it is towed along it continually samples the plankton from the sea by means of a long gauze banding which is slowly wound across a water tunnel by the action of a propeller turned by the passing water. This gauze banding is graduated in num- bered divisions. For every mile of sea through which the machine is towed a fresh section of gauze strains off the plankton from the water and then it is wound into a preservative chamber where it is stored on a spool in formalin for future examination. At the end of a run the spool is taken out, mounted on a special stage and examined below a traversing microscope so that one can estimate the changing plankton mile by mile. The first experimental machine I took with me on the 1.925-27 voyage of the Discovery . In my earlier work in the North Sea I had been struck by the patchi- ness of the plankton distribution often experienced. By ordinary tow net methods where one has to stop or slow down the ship at intervals to take samples one can only take observations at points some distance apart. One cannot knew whether the sample at one point is really representative of the whole surrounding area. Here one must be critical of the method developed by Hensen which I referred to earlier: it is no use carrying the estimation of the population in a plankton sample to a very high degree of accuracy when one knows that had the sample been taken a few miles to the right or left one would have got a very different result. The plankton recorder was designed to give an uninterrupted series of samples along the line of travel. The first was a clumsy machine which frequently went wrong, but by continued alteration and improvement it became the parent of a fleet of smaller more efficient machines suitable for use on commercial ships crossing the North Sea. The whole process is automatic ; the machine is set ready for working and all the ship has to do is to lower it into the water when leaving one coast and haul it up on reaching the other side. Actually there are standard points for launching and hauling the machines on the different routes, the passing of certain lightships or lighthouses. We began in 1932 and for five years charted the southern North Sea on lines from Hull to the continent. In 1938 we opened a new laboratory at Leith and now covered the whole of the North Sea by inter-crossing lines. At last we were obtaining pictures of the whole change of events from a line between the Shetlands and Norway southwards to the English Channel. Just as we were beginning to get some idea of the nature of the changes taking place the war intervened and put, we hope only temporarily, a stop to our activities. Already the recorders have shown us big seasonal and yearly changes, marked differences in the production of different species, and indications of long-range trends over a number of years which must have a profound influence on the fisheries. One direct economic result has ensued ; when large patches of phytoplankton are encountered in regions where they are likely to have an effect upon the autumn East Anglian herring fishery the information is passed on to the Ministry of Fisheries so that they can make a more detailed survey of the patch with their research ship for the benefit of the herrin*? drifter fleet. Space will not allow me to present any detailed account of the results so far obtained ; these will be found recorded in full in a special series of publications, the Hull Bulletins of Marine Ecology, of which No. 10 has recently been issued. I would like to end by referring to another branch of plankton ecology which is destined to play an important part in the future. Different bodies of water, such as Arctic and Atlantic water, oceanic water and coastal water, have different plankton species which are characteristic of them. When we encounter these different organisms we can regard them as labels telling us the source of origin The Naturalist Plankton Ecology in the Service of Man 9 of this or that mass of water. This aspect of plankton ecology has been largely developed under the influence of Mr. F. S. Russell, of the Plymouth Laboratory, who for many years has been studying the changing plankton populations at the western end' of the English Channel. He found that of two species of the arrow- worm Sagitta, S. elegans was indicative of oceanic water and 5. setosa of typical English Channel water. Sometimes one dominated in the plankton off Plymouth, sometimes the other ; this demonstrated whether the flow of oceanic water into the English Channel was strong or weak. He has pointed out many other organisms as indicators of water movements, and Dr. Fraser, of the Scottish Fishery Board, by the use of such organisms has mapped out boundaries between Arctic, Atlantic, and typical North Sea water, and regions of their mixture. These boundaries change as the flow of different waters masses varies in different years. We cannot doubt that these changes in the distribution of the major water masses must have a great effect upon the fisheries. It has been known for some time that the strength of the Atlantic inflow into the North Sea varies from year to year. Our plankton recorder survey is making a special feature of charting these indicator species. As the summer passes into autumn we see the line separating the Sagitta elegans population of the Atlantic water from the 5. setosa population of the North Sea water advancing down the east coast of Scotland and spreading outwards. Similarly the small pelagic mollusc, the pteropod Limacina, also marks the Atlantic advance. The survey is providing not only information about the plankton itself, but through it to information of the variations in the movements of the water masses within the area. All this work I have described as being developed at Hull, and later at our sub-station at Leith, has only been possible by good team work, by the hard work enthusiastically put into it by my colleagues on the research staff. For the moment they are all scattered in their country’s service : to the navy the army, and special scientific war work. It is to be hoped that they all come together again to continue and further develop these investigations. Just before the war, in the spring of 1939, we began our first monthly line into the Atlantic, on a ship sailing from Leith to Iceland crossing the deep Faeroe-Shetland channel up which the main Atlantic current passes before turning south into the North Sea. It is our hope that when peace comes our survey may be extended to cover a large part of the Atlantic. Many puzzles of the North Sea fisheries may be solved by a better knowledge of what is happening in the ocean to the west. Finally I must not forget to say how extremely grateful we have been at Hull for all the kind help given us in our work by the fishermen, by the various steam- ship lines and their officers and men, who have all so willingly co-operated in our schemes of investigation.

JENNIE AND JOHN GRAINGER The policy of holding Forays at the same place on succeeding years allowed some interesting comparisons to be made. General collections were similar in both years, and again the acid' leaf mould of the woods yielded a flora quite different from the less acid or neutral pastures. Panus torulosus was found upon the same rotting stump as last year, and Polystictus versicolor was also found in the same habitat in both seasons. Collections from Seckar Wood represent only a slight survey as heavy rain curtailed extensive investigation. Mrs. M. Grainger, M.Sc., delivered the Chairman’s address on ‘ Some Chemical Aspects of the Fungi.’ Mr. W. E. L. Wattam was elected Chairman for the ensuing year, and Mr. W. D. Hincks was elected to the Mycological Committee. A new record for Yorkshire was found in Gyrodon ccespitosus Massee. This was easily recognised by its labyrinthine pores and Boletus-like fruit body.

Obituary. — The Botanical Section has lost one of its old members in the late J. W. Haigh Johnson, M.Sc., F.I.C., and the Vertebrate Section by the death of Sydney H. Smith, J.P., F.Z.S. Another loss is C. O. F. Saner, of Cottingham, whose membership dates back to 1897. The Naturalist (W. R. Grist). — 1942 has been a difficult year. In April we were suddenly faced with an ultimatum from the Paper Control and asked to reduce the weight of paper used to 19 J per cent, of the weight consumed in 1939. This would mean that unless drastic steps were taken we should be printing less than twenty pages for every hundred in previous years. After considerable correspondence with the Headquarters of the Paper Control and further dealings with our publishers, we were able to get the concession that the weight of paper used could be 30 per cent, of the previous amount. The publishers made several suggestions as to the best way of utilising the much reduced paper area, and the Editors consulted with the Secretary and Treasurer, and as a consequence one of Messrs. Browns’ proposals was accepted. It will be noted that this involved a change over from a monthly journal to one published quarterly. But each of the quarterly numbers would consist of 32 pages instead of 24, which is within 16 pages of a. former six months issue. Thinner paper than formerly is now being used, but our publishers advise us against going any further in this direction ; otherwise, especially when half-tone blocks were being printed, opaqueness could not be guaranteed. BOTANICAL SECTION (Chris. A. Cheetham) : Every report which I have received from my botanical correspondents has some mention of abnormal weather conditions. These may be summed up by saying that 1942 started with a severe winter which lasted into early March ; this was followed by an early spring drought with persistent east winds. There was a short hot spell in early June, which was followed by damp and cool conditions throughout what should have been summer ; this lasted until the end of September when some warmer and drier weather was experienced. Grass made little growth and no use could be made of the early June warmth. Later on, after the hay had been cut, growth restarted and corn crops looked hopeful, but late August and early September brought heavy rain and wind storms which beat down the crops, making the task of the harvester almost hopeless. The early spring flowers were held back, and I did not see a bloom on Saxifraga oppositifolia upon the cliffs of Pen-y-ghent until March 29th. Conditions must vary in different districts according to correspondents reports. Here at Austwick we have the heaviest hazel crop of recent years, better than the very good crop of last year, but Wattam says it is poor at Huddersfield. Crab apples are plentiful around Austwick and at Scarborough, Tadcaster, and Huddersfield, but Malins Smith finds them poor near Shipley. The oak I find reasonably good ; Wattam says excellent, but Malins Smith says poor. I find far more sloes than for some years, but at Shipley they are said to be poor. All agree on the lack of fruit on the ash and many note its very late leafage. I saw oak leaves on May 5th but no sign of ash leaves until June 7th (just after the hot spell). Some ash trees had no leaves until the month end. Can the cold drought and late date for ash leafage be connected with the lack of ash fruits ? In the 1939 report ash and oak were said to come into leaf together and the ash had a good crop of fruits ; much the same was noted in 1937 though not so marked. The Naturalist Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union : Annual Report, 1942 15 I found the early spring flowers a fortnight later than I did last year ; the orchids were generally poor, those blooming later in the season being distinctly better. I have brought the various writers views together in the following table : Cheetham Wattam Malins Smith Highfield Bramley Cross Pear . Good Excellent Good Apple .

Very good — Good, variable — — Very good Raspberry Good — Very good — Abundant Mr. W. E. L. Wattam, writing from Huddersfield, says : The wintry conditions after a mild autumn were for a third successive year of a severe type. Indeed, the months of January and February registered the coldest period in local meteoro- logical records for the past 40 years. Snowfalls were slight, the only one of noticeable depth coming in March. The early days of spring gave great promise and the elms and willows produced a magnificent display of bloom, as did many acclimatised shrubs and trees. April was the sunniest for 40 years, but was prac- tically spoilt by the strong persistent east wind ; the first 19 days were rainless. An unfortunate spell of drought in May cut short the wealth of bloom of laburnum, lilac, almond, cherry, and rhododendron. Cultivated apples, pears, plums, and cherries gave a memorable display of floristic beauty. The display of wild bloom has been glorious and prolonged by the constant moist conditions from summer into early autumn. Though the sycamore blossom display was very fine, the fruit yield is not what might have been expected. It might be here placed on record that three large crab trees at Bank Top, High Hoy land, were cut down in spring to prevent damage which ensued yearly, this considerably reduces the wild crab in our district. For a second year both flower and fruit have been an outstanding feature on the lime. Mr. E. R. Cross, writing from Scarborough, says : Owing no doubt to the exceptionally wet August (and to the check during the early growth — C.A.C.), secondary growths have been remarkable, many trees and shrubs which in the ordinary course would have been showing autumn tints are masses of vivid green. Fruits have been exceptionally abundant, apples and plums have been a very heavy crop, and pear trees, which generally fruit badly here, have yielded good crops. Wild fruits have been prolific : wild rasps have been gathered in great quantities, crab apples and brambles have been abundant. Regarding the ash in this district, I have carefully examined the trees up Oliver’s Mount and as many as possible in Raincliffe Woods, Forge Valley, and Hackness and I cannot find a single fruit. Mr. A. Malins Smith, from Shipley, says : I commented last year on the very late cold spring of 1941, but I think the spring of 1942 was even later. Judged by my dates of flower opening there was not much difference. For example, first coltsfoot flower I saw on March 22nd, 1942, and March 23rd, 1941 ; first celandine, April 5th, 1942, April 12th, 1941 ; dog rose, June 27th, 1942, July 1st, 1941. But the leafing of the trees was extraordinarily late this year, especially that of the 1943 January -March i6 Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union : Annual Report, 1942 ash. On June 21st a proportion of the ash trees were not in leaf, and ash trees were not all in full leaf till the end of the month. The lack of fruit on the ash followed a very poor flowering. I noticed that as a rule the good crops on the rowan were on trees in the open, while those in the woods had a poor crop. Though I classified the hazel as moderate, yet the crop was much better than the average for this district, where it is usually a very poor fruiter. The woody nightshade and honey- suckle have moderate crops and the black bryony poor. The idea that trees do not crop well or badly in two successive years is refuted by the results of 1941 and 1942. For example, Holly was very good in both years (C.A.C. finds two excellent crops of hazel in 1941 and 1942). Secondary growth, especially in the oak, was exceptionally abundant. Mr. E. G. Highfield writes from Pickering : The weather conditions during the year have been briefly as follows : (1) a very severe winter with the ground con- tinuously under snow for eight weeks ; (2) a fairly acute spring drought during May and June ; (3) a very wet and cool summer from the middle of July onwards. Owing to the long winter the spring was very much delayed, even aconites and snowdrops were not in bloom until March. The woodland flowers were not at all luxuriant or plentiful. Gagea lutea had a very poor season and only produced a few scattered blooms. Early purple and green wing orchids did quite well but were not in flower until May. Fly orchid and bee orchid are becoming very scarce in this district. Butterfly orchid, which is generally very abundant, was quite scarce. The later flowering orchids, O. maculata, O. latifolia, O. pyramidalis, Habenaria conopsea, and Epipactis palustris all flowered well. The dwarf cornel in the Hole of Horcum had a very poor season, there were plenty of plants but the flowers were very scarce. The same was the case with the lily of the valley. Trees were late in getting into leaf, especially the ash, which was quite bare up to the second week in June. Most blossom was plentiful, but it was obviously impoverished by the drought and in consequence there is a scarcity of fruit, especially on dry soils. Acorns are very scarce, even sycamore is not showing much fruit, and the ash none at all. From my observation it has not been a healthy season for trees. Many have been shedding their leaves since the middle of July and it would seem that the wood from which the leaves have been shed is mostly dead. I have seen this in many cases, and very specially in a plantation of young larch in which on September 19th the trees had shed nearly all their leaves before having taken on any autumn tints. Botanical Records Committee (Dr. W. A. Sledge) : In spite of the present- day restrictions on travel and more limited opportunities for botanical activities the past season has been unusually productive. To some extent this is due to my own good fortune in having had a job of work to do during the early summer which involved many outings to widely separated parts of the county. Mr. Cross has sent several interesting gatherings from the Scarborough district. These include Anthemis tinctoria and Orobanche elatior. It is particularly interesting to know that Linum anglicum has reappeared in its old station at Seamer. Miss Rob has been making intensive investigations of the Catterick and Richmond areas, and especially noteworthy among many interesting local records is her rediscovery of Dipsacus pilosus near Richmond in its most northernly British station and in the locality where James Ward first discovered it over a century ago. My own finds include Arnoseris minima from Camblesforth (new to V.C. 64), Carex digitata from Anston Stones Wood, C. axillaris from Balne, Orchis prcetermissa from Auckley (new to V.C. 63), and O. purpurella from Skip with Common (new to V.C. 61 ) . At Skipwith Common I also found Cirsium Forsteri. This is new to Yorkshire. Pride of place, however, amongst all this year’s records goes to a discovery made by Dr. J. M. Taylor who has been paying special attention to the violets of Thorne Waste where he has discovered Viola stagnina. A more detailed account of this discovery will form the subject of a separate paper. Aquilegia vulgaris L. (63) Abundant in some parts of Edlington Wood, near Doncaster ; W.A.S.

Ecological Committee (Miss D. Hilary) : The members of the Ecological Committee cordially welcome the proposal to extend the scope of ecology by the formation of an Ecological Section. Although the study of the more widespread heather moor will no doubt make a more general appeal, yet it is intended also to study the Moughton juniper as vigorously as before. This was examined at the Whitsuntide meeting of the Union at Horton, but no striking change was noted. Later Messrs. Hincks and Steel examined the juniper from an entomological point of view and they will report in due course. Our Chairman, Mr. Malins Smith, sends the following account of some observations made on juniper in Surrey which have an interesting bearing on the study of the Moughton juniper : ‘ On August 22nd I examined an area of mixed scrub with rather sparse juniper on Puttenham Common, Surrey. The common is on the chalk of the Hog’s Bank The Naturalist Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union : Annual Report, 1942 19 ridge. There were numerous young plants of most of the shrubs, including sloe, privet, buckthorn, wayfaring tree, holly, rose, and dogwood, but I saw no young junipers or yews, though both were present as mature bushes. The juniper showed dead branches on many bushes covered with brown leaves and there were occasional dead bushes. I did not see the fungoid parasites, Gymnosporangium or Lopho- dermium, though the search was not thorough enough to enable me to say that these were absent. Certainly they were not common. There was not much sign of rabbit attack. Though some bushes showed proliferation of small branches as if due to nibbling, there were none which were close cropped all over, such as are often found on Moughton Fell. The apparent absence of young junipers and the occurrence of dead and dying bushes are features very similar to those noted on Moughton. Though rabbit attack was light, these animals were present and may be in sufficient numbers to account for the absence of seedling and young junipers. I took some juniper branches for measurement with the following results : Bush Condition Age of branch Average increase in circumference per annum 1 Healthy 16 years 3-1 mm. 14 >> 3*4 » > 11 ,, 4'2 „ 2 , , 5 y y 5*7 >> 4 >. 5-5 ,, 3 Much nibbled 9 ,, 2-9 ,, ‘Reference to my paper ( Naturalist , 1935, p. 121) will show that these rates are much higher than those of junipers on Moughton. The soil on Puttenham Down is shallow and should probably be compared with the limestone of Moughton, rather than with the drift. The highest rate on Moughton limestone was 1-3 mm. per annum and the average 0-7 mm. per annum. Thus the Puttenham rates are about three times those on Moughton. They are, in fact, higher than all the drift soil measurements but one on Moughton. A certain deduction should fairly be made since the Puttenham measurements were all of comparatively young branches which usually show higher rates than the main stems or main branches, which alone were measured on Moughton. But a marked difference still remains and may probably be caused by the more genial climate of the more southernly and lower Puttenham area, aided possibly by the lighter animal attack to which the plants are apparently subjected.’ Mr. Wattam has continued his valuable study of the juniper seedlings which he has been growing for several years and sends the following report : Observations on the Seedling of Juniper ( Juniperus communis L.) Moughton Fell Survey — Sixth Report First report, 9th October, 1934. Second report, 24th September, 1935. Third report, 12th September, 1936. Fourth report, 30th September, 1937. Fifth report, 24th September, 1940. Sectional Paragraph in Previous Reports (12 whole fruits planted 28th October, 1933)— Two of the three seedlings which were being grown in the soil obtained from beneath a large juniper south of Test Plot 3 died during the winter of 1941-42. The remaining seedling plant which had attained the height of i|- in. is still living. Three-quarters of the upper portion of this plant had died off. The living lower portion has produced three small branchlets which have produced nine, eight, and six small leaves, and below these branchlets another growing point has pro- duced four small leaves. The pot containing these seendling plants was placed outdoors in an exposed easterly position in late September, 1941. The frost conditions commencing in January, 1942, were the highest recorded for the Huddersfield district for 40 years. As stated, one plant only has been able to withstand this wintry severity. The. soil in the pot has been kept moist as occasion required. I943 J anu ary -March 20 Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union : Annual Report, 1942 Sectional Paragraph in Previous Reports (Naked Seeds) — The seedling plants placed in my own garden continue to thrive and have withstood the arctic weather conditions of 1940-41 and 1941-42 with but little mishap. A measurement taken on October 1st, 1942, revealed that two of the plants were 20 in. in height, and the whole of the plants had a profusion of vigorous growing branches. — W. E. L. Wattam. Another very important piece of ecological work has been done at Huddersfield under the leadership of Dr. J. Grainger, and a full account of this, entitled ‘ The Soils of the Huddersfield District,’ has appeared in the last two issues of The Naturalist. Mycological Committee (Miss J. Grainger) : The Fungus Foray was held at Cawthorne and Seckar Wood was added to the woodlands to be investigated. Mrs. Grainger delivered the Chairman’s address at Cinderhill’s Farm on September 19th. The subject was ‘ The Chemistry of Fungi,’ which gave a review of the nutrition and chemical products of the fungi. The address was published in The Naturalist, Autumn, 1942. Before the business of the Annual Meeting began the members stood in silence to honour the memory of Mr. J. W. H. Johnson, who had been a constant attender at the Forays. His quiet, effective help will be greatly missed. Discussion took place as to the time the Foray should be held. The end of August or early September suits some members, but others cannot be sure of attending till the end of September or early October. It was thought advisable to hold a Foray at Farnley Tyas in 1943 at the earlier date with the possibility of another meeting near York at a later date. During the year another part of Mr. Petch’s * Notes on Entomogonous Fungi ’ has been published. Mr. W. G. Bramley is responsible for the majority of the following records.

Milsom) : Work in bryology has been at a low ebb during the past year, the chief causes being lack of time and lack of facilities for transport, which have grown steadily worse. These conditions are likely to persist for some time, and it has been thought desirable therefore to indicate some of the problems with which bryology in Yorkshire should be concerned in the future and which should not be lost sight of. Taxonomic problems will consist chiefly in the re-grouping of existing species and varieties. At one time The Naturalist Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union : Annual Report, 1942 21 the tendency was to split wherever possible, but it is being felt that re-grouping is now more essential. The Scapanias are a case in point as exemplified by the disappearance of S. rosacea and the recognition of the close relationship between S. obliqua and 5. uliginosa. The merging of Lophozia atlantica with L. Floerkii is another example. Problems such as the above, however, have perforce to be left to the college laboratory and the home microscope. Dealing more particularly with field work, one of the most essential things is the keeping check of habitats and records for rare species. Several of these have not been found for many years. For example, Paludella squarrosa at Skipwith, Mielichoferia nitida at Ingleby Greenhow, Spruce’s old records of Dicranums in Teesdale, Thuidium Blandovii at Halnaby and Malham, etc. The work of Dr. Bedford in rediscovering Hynum crista-castrensis and Camptothecium nitens shows that records need not be considered permanently lost if they have not been found for a long time. In this connection it is highly important to keep in the archives of the Union exact and detailed descriptions of habitats of the rare species, accompanied if possible by photographs. To try and trace a habitat from the meagre description in Lees or Baker, for example, usually involves a lot of wearisome field-work which is often unsuccessful. It is hoped that the above will encourage Yorkshire bryologists to map out schemes of future work for use when general conditions improve. VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY SECTION MAMMALS, REPTILES, AMPHIBIANS AND FISHES Mammalia (Mrs. A. Hazelwood). — Around Rotherham Foxes ( Vulpes v. crucigera) have increased to an unusual extent. Several lots of domestic fowls in gardens and allotments close in to the town have been killed. At Southowram a farmer has just (October) shot his fifty-fifth fox, presumably since the beginning of the year. Foxes are also very numerous and impudent in the East Riding, where several broods of cubs have been reared within the Scarborough boundary, two of them in the Castle Holmes. Around Thornton-le-Dale they are also very numerous. A few miles north of Thornton, towards the end of February, much commotion and barking was heard near a keeper’s house, due to a fierce combat among three dog foxes, watched by one bitch. On April 26th an Otter ( I.utra lutra) and cub were observed in the Ouse about two miles above York, a regular haunt. Badgers ( Meles meles) continue plentiful in all the wooded valleys of the tributaries of the Rye. Nearer York they have been ruthlessly exterminated on some estates. A note in The Field of August 29th recorded that on July 26th a terrier killed an apparently adult white Weasel ( Mustela nivalis) at Lilymere, Sedbergh. The animal was not an albino, as the eyes were dark brown. In May Mr. Taylor witnessed a fight to the death between a Stoat (M. erminea stabilis) and a large Brown Rat on the Tilmere golf links. After much sparring the Stoat was victorious. This is the second fight of this character recorded recently by Mr. Taylor, both being in favour of the Stoat. Red Squirrels ( Sciurus vulgaris leucourus) , although still scarce at Egton, near Whitby, are rather more plentiful there this year. A small colony of them was observed in a wood at Harwood Dale in company with American Grey Squirrels. Red Squirrels have been recorded for the following districts of Sheffield : Wentworth Woodhouse Park, Cannon Hall Park, a wood at Strines, Wharncliffe Woods and woods at Rivelin Dams. Grey Squirrels (S. carolinensis) have almost disappeared from Egton for no apparent reason as they were abundant there up to two years ago. They continue very plentiful around York and are sometimes seen on the outskirts of the city. They are also reported from Thornton-le-Dale, and on March 12th one was seen at Cottingham in trees by Waterworks. Mr. James Cooper reported that he had never known Long-tailed Field Mice ( Apodemus sylvaticus) to be so common in Egton district as they were in March of this year. Field Voles ( Microtus agrestis hirtus ) are also numerous in the same locality, although not quite so abundant as they were last year. Water Voles ( Arvicola amphibius) are plentiful in York district, with occasional melanic specimens. Mr. James Taylor, rat-catcher to the Scarborough Corporation, reports that he has never known rats (Rattus norvegicus) so scarce as during the present time. During 1941 he caught 847 rats, the largest of which measured just 24 inches in length . 1943 January-March 22 Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union : Annual Report, 1942 In Thornton-le-Dale district, Rabbits ( Oryctolagus cuniculus) were extensively shot last winter (1941 -2) and greatly reduced in numbers. Disease this spring is also reported to have aided the reduction. As everywhere was under snow, almost continuously during January and February, food was scarce, and trees were attacked, bark gnawed off from ground level to about twenty inches above, Ash being the favoured tree. Felled timber, Ash, was also debarked. Larch and Pine in the vicinity were not attacked. Rabbits around Whitby are abnormally scarce, not due to shooting or trapping. Farmers who normally kill two thousand rabbits every year have this year not killed two dozen, and the scarcity is also reported from Hull. Brown Hares ( Lepus europcsus occidentalis) were hard put to exist in York district during the severe frosts of the early months of the year, and visited vegetable gardens in the outskirts of the city. On March 24th strange noises were heard in a small willed garden, where a Hare was trying to scramble up the wall, which was 6 ft. 6 in. high. The third attempt succeeded. The wall on the outside only necessitated a five foot jump, but why the animal went to such trouble when there were plenty of open vegetable gardens is unknown. Hares around Thornton-le-Dale are also greatly reduced in numbers. A few have been shot while feeding on vegetables near farmsteads. A courtship incident was witnessed on February 23rd. On the Tilmere near York the Moles ( Talpa europcea) seem to have great difficulty in obtaining food when the spring is dry. It is level heathland with slight moist depressions, and these are worked so intensively just below the turf that it all collapses as soon as the rain comes. In the marshy parts they build very large nesting hills in order to get the nests up to a safe level. On March 7th the whole area around Northallerton bore an even 3 inches of snow. One field near Scruban of about 2 acres, at 9 a.m. was observed to have not a spot to mar its whiteness ; at 4 p.m. there were 111 mole hills thrown upon it. Moles have been very numerous, almost a plague in some fields. A Pigmy Shrew ( Sorex europcea) was trapped at Killersby Hall, Cayton, by James Cooper, and sent to W. J. C., March 20th, 1942. Several very small Shrews had previously been trapped, and they might have belonged to the same species. A male Noctule Bat (Nyctalis noctula ) was caught at Knaresborough in early September and sent to E. H., September nth, 1942. Pipistrelle Bats ( Pipistrellus pipistrellus) are also recorded from the same locality. A large colony of Pipistrelle Bats has lodged beneath the tiles of a house in Oak Road, Scarborough. On July 20th about 150 specimens were seen to emerge at dusk. On another occasion seventy-eight were counted within half an hour, but many others emerged so quickly that it was impossible to count them all. A specimen was procured for identification. The catchwater to White Holme Reservoir is yielding its autumnal crop of mammals, and for the second time has included a Mole. On February 18th, at Jervaulx, a cow gave birth to four white calves, three of w'hich are still living (September). It is reported that on October 5th, within a length of three miles of road, just south of Northallerton, ten Hedgehogs, all of which had been run over in the previous hour or two, were counted, suggesting the possibility of a certain kind of local movement at certain times of the year. Outside the distance mentioned no other corpses were seen. Reptilia (Mrs. A. Hazelwood). — An Adder ( Vipera berus) was killed by Captain Medlicott at Goathland and sent to E. H. on July 26th. It was a female, length 20 in., ova undeveloped. The reptile was in excellent condition, fat present everywhere in quantity, and its belly was of a beautiful pale blue colour, not due to the proximity to sloughing or any other normal condition. This blue belly coloration is a most rare marking. Grass Snakes ( Natrix natrix ) are reported common at Kelsey Hill near Hull. Five Viviparous Lizards ( Lacerta vivipara) were seen basking by the side of the main road near Allerton in June. Amphibia (Mrs. A. Hazelwood) : Frogs ( Rana temporaria ) have been very conspicuous. Spawn was noted at Newsome (two localities) and Farnley (near the bottling works) on April 6th. At Newsome Tadpoles were extremely numerous by April 18th, while in early August young Frogs were strikingly abundant. The Crested Newt in good numbers were seen in the service reservoir outside Stockmoor Station on August 1st. The Great Crested ( Triturus palustris) and Common Newts The Naturalist Yorkshire Naturalists’ Union : Annual Report, 1942 23 (T. vulgaris ) occur commonly around Hull, although the Palmated Newt appears to be of only rare occurrence. Twenty newts and many frogs were killed in a pond at Sipho during a sharp frost on March 27th. Pisces (Mrs. A. Hazelwood) : One Sturgeon ( Aoipenser sturio), weighing 35 st. 8 lb., was caught by the S.T. Acuba about seven miles off Hartlepool on April 15th. Owing to the omission of the Government to classify this fish it had to be sold at offal price. Two hundred Rainbow Trout ( Sal-mo irideus ) were placed in the River Derwent at Hackness and Forge Valley on March 21st.. Crucian Carp, previously unknown around Scarborough, was discovered in considerable numbers in a pond at Kirby Misperton, where fifty were caught by an angler in one evening. Most were around 8 in. in length. Some were placed in the Scarborough Mere, and in a pond at Scalby in June ; also in Throxenby Mere, where an Otter has found them, and the animal has been seen there in May and on subsequent dates, although the mere is several miles from the nearest river. For assistance in compiling this report I am indebted to Messrs. W. J. Clarke (Scarborough), C. F. Procter and C. W. Mason (Hull), F. H. Edmondson (Keighley), E. W. Taylor and R. Wagstaff (York), R. Chislett (Rotherham), W. W. Nicholas (Hessle), R. M. Garnett (Thornton-ls-dale), A. S. Frank (Egton), W. Greaves (Halifax), W. E. L. Wattam (Huddersfield) ; to Capt. J. P. Utley (Northallerton) and to Lieut. R. Hewson, R.M. (Knaresborough) . It is with deepest regret that another name is omitted from this short acknowledgement, a name that has been and meant so very much to our section and its records during very many years — S. H. Smith, of York. His loss is indeed great, and it would here seem only fitting to pay tribute to the great amount of trouble he took to ensure absolute accuracy in all records and observations, and consequently to the high standard of anything submitted by him. His knowledge of fishing will be J greatly missed. ORNITHOLOGY Committee for Ornithology (Ralph Chislett) : The detailed report for 1941 j was duly reprinted. A few copies are still available. The loss sustained by the death of the late S. H. Smith, J.P., for so long the Recorder for the York district, will be felt and deplored by all members of the Vertebrate Section. In 1942 facilities for travel have further decreased, and calls upon our time have increased, but activities have been maintained. To those who have thought that such activities should cease during the present crisis, the Yorkshire Post recently gave effective answer in a leader headed ‘ Learned Societies, Carry On ’ : * They stand for something so rare, and so necessary, "
