She had sought the injunction to stay in her research position beyond June 30.\n\n\"I think this is a favorable first step in what will ultimately be a vindication of our position,\" Hopkins spokesman Gary M. Stephenson said yesterday. He has said Ko's contract was not renewed because she did not collaborate with colleagues.\n\nKo has alleged that Hopkins denied her the lab space needed to qualify for grants and the opportunity to seek government approval to start human clinical trials.\n\nHer research to eradicate advanced cancerous tumors in lab rats, which was described in a Jan. 8 article in The Sun , attracted attention from cancer patients hoping to be part of possible human clinical trials.\n\n\"I'm concerned because the question really is, will the research continue without her?\" said Joanne Merrill, whose husband has prostate cancer and wants to be part of a trial.\n\nShe and several other supporters demonstrated last Saturday in front of Johns Hopkins Hospital on Ko's behalf.\n\nIt is unknown whether her research will continue once Ko leaves Hopkins next week.\n\n\"At this point I hope that the decision-makers at the Johns Hopkins University and institution, for which we have tremendous respect, will reconsider their position and do everything they can to take advantage of Dr. Ko's unique expertise working with her revolutionary anti-cancer agent,\" said Ko's attorney, Charles Piven.\n\nCopyright © 2005, The Baltimore Sun\n\nHouse bans Medicare payments for Viagra\n\nTaxpayers could save $105 million in '06 alone from drug amendment\n\nAssociated Press\n\nBaltimore Sun\n\nSaturday, June 25, 2005\n\nWASHINGTON - Impotence drugs such as Viagra would not be covered by Medicaid and Medicare, the government health programs for the poor and the aged, under new prohibitions approved by the House yesterday.\n\nBy a 285-121 vote, the House approved an amendment by Rep. Steve King, an Iowa Republican, to stop the government from paying for the drugs. King said his amendment would save taxpayers $105 million next year alone.\n\nKing had earlier commissioned a budget study that found the government would spend more than $2 billion on such impotence drugs over the next decade. The amount spent would greatly increase as the Medicare prescription program begins next year.\n\n\"We don't force taxpayers to pay for face lifts, weight-loss drugs, hair-growth treatment or vacations, so we should not force them to pay for sexual-performance drugs,\" King said. \"Medicare and Medicaid were established to provide lifesaving medication for the truly needy.\"\n\nThe Senate has yet to act on the measure.\n\nThe vote came as the House debated a spending bill for health and education programs. The underlying bill already contains a ban on providing drugs such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra to sex offenders.\n\nThat provision came in response to outcries after it was revealed that almost 800 registered sex offenders in 14 states have been receiving taxpayer-funded impotence drugs through Medicaid. That prompted other states to search their databases.\n\nBut Rep. Nancy Johnson, a Connecticut Republican, said that the overwhelming majority of Medicaid and Medicare patients who are law-abiding deserve to receive the drugs, especially men who have lost sexual function after suffering prostate cancer and other life-threatening conditions.\n\nThe trade group representing prescription drug manufacturers also criticized the vote. The group said Medicaid and Medicare recipients should have access to the most effective treatments available for their condition.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the House is telling these men, 'Tough luck, you're on your own,'\" said Ken Johnson, senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. \"Hopefully, the Senate will view this important health issue with a little more compassion.\"\n\nCopyright © 2005, The Baltimore Sun\n\nPreviously cleared tissue tests positive for mad cow disease\n\nIt is 1st case thought to be from cattle born in U.S.\n\nBy Andrew Martin and Greg Burns, Chicago Tribune\n\nBaltimore Sun\n\nSaturday, June 25, 2005\n\nWASHINGTON - A cow that was cleared of having mad cow disease last fall by the U.S. Department of Agriculture was in fact infected with the brain-wasting disease, the department announced yesterday, making it the second confirmed case of the disease in this country.\n\nThe cow was incinerated last fall and never made it into the U.S. food supply, said Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns. He said the cow appeared to have been born in the United States, a significant fact because it suggests that the animal ate infected feed in this country that could have been eaten by other animals.\n\nU.S. officials were able to mitigate damage from the first case of mad cow disease in the nation, discovered in Washington state in December 2003, because that cow was born in Canada and thought to have eaten infected feed there.\n\nTesting problem\n\nThe infected animal, which was at least 8 years old, couldn't walk and was covered with manure, placing it in a category of \"downer\" cattle that are more likely to have mad cow disease and are randomly tested by the Agriculture Department. But while an initial \"quick test\" was inconclusive, two more sophisticated tests were negative.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the Agriculture Department's inspector general noticed inconsistencies in the testing as part of an audit of the agency's mad cow surveillance program and asked for additional tests. A renowned laboratory in England, as well as the Agriculture Department's own labs, confirmed that the cow was infected using a test known as the \"Western blot.\"\n\nJohanns suggested that one of the reasons the disease wasn't initially found was that the animal had a variation on the classic mad cow disease that swept through England in the early 1990s. Instead of finding the disease throughout the brain, it was isolated to certain parts of the brain, a form of the disease that has been found in some animals in France, he said.\n\nSafe beef\n\nWhile insisting on the safety of the U.S. beef supply, Johanns said he would initiate new protocols for testing that would include the \"Western blot\" test when an initial \"rapid-response\" test for mad cow disease was inconclusive. He also said that he was correcting a number of problems he had uncovered in how the Agriculture Department handled the diseased cow - from failing to segregate tissue samples from those of other cows to freezing the samples.\n\nStill, Johanns tried to put a positive spin on yesterday's announcement, pointing out that the Agriculture Department had tested 388,000 cows in the past year and found only one instance of mad cow disease.\n\nMad cow disease is officially known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE. The disease attacks brain cells and leaves spongy holes behind, and it can be spread to humans by eating contaminated meat. The human form, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has killed about 150 people worldwide, mostly in England.\n\nCritics on Capitol Hill and from consumer groups accused the government of not doing enough to detect and prevent mad cow disease.\n\n'Serious lapses'\n\nMichael Hansen, a researcher at Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports, said the fact that it took seven months to retest the animal shows \"serious lapses\" in the Agriculture Department's testing program. He also said it would be significant if the animal was born in the United States because it would show that the problem wasn't isolated to Canada.\n\nJohn Stauber, author of Mad Cow USA and the executive director of the Center of Media and Democracy, said the Agriculture Department needed to adopt the more aggressive strategies of nations such as Japan.\n\nMarket reaction was expected to be negative, though some of the bad news has already been factored into cattle prices during the past two weeks, since the Agriculture Department announced that it was conducting further tests on the tissue.\n\nThe announcement could hurt U.S. beef exports and it might doom aggressive efforts by trade negotiators to persuade Japan to reopen its border to American beef. Once the biggest importer of U.S. beef, Japan has kept its borders closed since the first U.S. case of mad cow disease was found.\n\nJohanns, however, said he didn't think the news would affect negotiations with Japan because the United States is proposing sending only beef that is from cows 20 months or younger. Nearly all cows infected with mad cow disease are 30 months old or more.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune is a Tribune Publishing newspaper.\n\nCopyright © 2005, The Baltimore Sun\n\nIn Vietnam, Experts Study Bird Flu Risk\n\nReuters\n\nWashington Post\n\nSaturday, June 25, 2005; A20\n\nHANOI, June 24 -- A team of international experts is in Vietnam studying whether the H5N1 bird flu virus could be evolving into a form that might trigger a human pandemic, the World Health Organization said Friday.\n\nThe team of virologists and epidemiologists was looking at \"the possibility of more widespread H5N1 human transmission, changes in the H5N1 virus and the likelihood of increased human-to-human transmission,\" WHO said in a statement.\n\n\"What has happened in Vietnam may have public health implications for the entire world and will be crucial in preparing for a possible pandemic,\" Hans Troedsson, WHO representative in Vietnam, was quoted as saying in the statement.\n\nWHO officials in Hanoi were not immediately available for comment about details of the study in a country where the virus has killed 38 people.\n\nScientists have been tracking the evolution of the H5N1 virus, which is infectious in birds but does not spread easily among humans. Health experts fear the disease could mutate into a form that does spread easily among people, unleashing a pandemic.\n\n© 2005 The Washington Post Company\n\nBig pharmaceutical firms are buying biotechs\n\nPfizer, other drugmakers no longer satisfied with acquiring just patents\n\nBy Denise Gellene, Los Angeles Times\n\nBaltimore Sun\n\nSaturday, June 25, 2005\n\nFaced with patent expirations on highly profitable drugs, big pharmaceutical companies are turning to small biotechs to restock their medicine chests.\n\nThe latest example came when Pfizer Inc. agreed recently to buy Vicuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. for $1.9 billion. Vicuron, based in King of Prussia, Pa., worked on antibiotics and drugs for fungal infections, key areas for Pfizer.\n\nThe acquisition followed one in April by GlaxoSmithKline PLC, which agreed to buy Corixa Corp., a Seattle company focused on vaccines.\n\nOther recent Pfizer deals include the purchase of Angiosyn Inc. and Idun Pharmaceuticals by Pfizer, while Johnson & Johnson acquired TransForm Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Peninsula Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nOf course, Pfizer, Glaxo, Johnson & Johnson, Merck & Co. and some other big pharmaceutical companies have always looked to the biotechnology industry as a source of new products.\n\nDrugs licensed from biotech companies account for 30 percent of their revenues, according to consulting firm Deloitte & Touche.\n\nWhat's changed is that big drugmakers aren't just negotiating product deals, but are snapping up biotech companies themselves. There have been 16 acquisitions of biotech companies by drug companies this year, compared with three in the first six months of 2004, according to data provided by investment bank Barrington Associates.\n\nFraction of deals\n\nBig drug companies were responsible for a fraction of the total merger deals in the biotech sector, which increased from 59 in 2003 to 99 the next year, according to merger information company FactSet Mergerstat.\n\nBut they clearly were the biggest spenders. Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and others together have spent $5.5 billion to acquire biotech companies this year, half the total value of all mergers in the sector.\n\nThere's no mystery to the trend, said Paul E. Kacik, head of health care practice at Barrington. The big drug companies need to fill their product development pipelines because they stand to lose billions in revenue when some popular drugs lose patent protection and face competition.\n\nIn addition, the American Jobs Creation Act has allowed U.S. companies to repatriate earnings from foreign subsidiaries at a reduced tax rate, leaving big drug companies with large cash hoards available for investment. The 2004 law was promoted as a way to galvanize job growth by encouraging companies to invest overseas profits domestically.\n\nPfizer, for example, has repatriated foreign income of $28.3 billion and says the total may climb to $40 billion before the year is over, creating a vast pool for acquisitions.\n\nBy 2007, Pfizer drugs with annual sales of $14 billion - one-quarter of total company sales - will lose patent protection. Among them are Zoloft, an antidepressant, and Zithromax, an antibiotic.\n\nSo the world's largest drug company has been on a highly visible shopping spree. Pfizer agreed to pay an 84 percent premium for Vicuron - a price that fund managers said prevented a bidding war from breaking out for the firm.\n\n\"I suspect some people think we're crazy and buying everything that moves,\" said John L. LaMattina, Pfizer's research and development chief. \"But all our acquisitions have been strategic.\"\n\nAngiosyn, a San Diego company, added to Pfizer's depth in eye diseases, he said, an area where the drug giant co-markets Macugen for macular degeneration.\n\nDrugs in development at Vicuron could help replace revenue lost when Zithromax loses patent protection in November.\n\nRight now, big pharmaceutical companies are finding willing sellers among smaller biotech companies. According to Ernst & Young, 40 percent of publicly traded biotechnology companies have less than two years of cash remaining, up from 31 percent at this time last year.\n\nAt the same time, private biotech companies hoping to go public face investors who have become hostile to new stock offerings.\n\n'Confluence of factors'\n\n\"We're seeing sort of a confluence of factors\" driving merger deals, said Richard S. Kollender, a principal with Quaker BioVentures in Philadelphia.\n\nBecause drug companies are looking for deals, biotechs with promising technology or drugs close to market can command premiums, as in the case of Vicuron.\n\n\"These companies are very hungry for assets,\" said Kollender, adding that a four-way bidding war had broken out over a biotech that Quaker invested in.\n\nNot every deal may be as good as it looks. Kurt von Emster, a partner with MPM Capital LP, said that Corixa was worth more than Glaxo offered for the company. Glaxo offered $300 million for Corixa in April, a 48 percent premium over the company's share price at the time.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times is a Tribune Publishing newspaper.\n\nCopyright © 2005, The Baltimore Sun\n\nHouse Votes $602 Billion for Health, Education\n\nMany Programs Cut; Drugs for Impotence Barred From Coverage Under Medicare and Medicaid\n\nBy Shailagh Murray\n\nWashington Post Staff Writer\n\nSaturday, June 25, 2005; A04\n\nThe House yesterday approved a health and education spending bill for 2006 that cuts deeply into scores of programs and bars Medicare and Medicaid from covering impotence drugs.\n\nThe $602 billion bill, approved 250 to 151, is slightly more than President Bush proposed but less than many lawmakers had wanted. Republicans and Democrats took up two days of floor time trying to win extra money for popular programs that fall under the $142.5 billion portion of the bill that Congress controls, the balance going to mandatory programs such as Medicaid.\n\nOnly a few of those efforts were successful, including a bid Thursday to restore $100 million to public broadcasting.\n\nThe ban on coverage of impotence drugs, approved 285 to 121, is part of a larger debate on whether Medicare and Medicaid should cover \"lifestyle drugs.\" Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who offered the amendment, cited Congressional Budget Office estimates that impotence drugs could cost the federal government at least $2 billion between 2006 and 2015, at a time when health care costs are spiraling and Congress is trying to chip away at the deficit.\n\n\"Medicare and Medicaid were established to provide lifesaving medication for the truly needy,\" King said.\n\nEarlier, the Appropriations Committee added a provision to ban coverage of impotence drugs for convicted sex offenders. Recent studies have shown that hundreds of sex offenders in numerous states had obtained such drugs under the Medicaid program.\n\nOpponents of the amendment, including Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R-Conn.), who chairs the Medicare subcommittee on the Ways and Means panel, argued that men who lost sexual function because of prostate cancer or other diseases have a legitimate claim to medications such as Viagra and Cialis.\n\nThe spending bill funds federal education programs, including Pell Grants, special-education grants, teacher training, Head Start and basic skill assessments. It also pays for a vast array of medical research and health care programs, including Medicaid, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Ryan White AIDS program, and numerous public health initiatives, including bioterrorism preparation.\n\nThe bill provides funding to implement the new Medicare prescription drug program and for two big priorities of the conservative movement: religion-based community outreach and abstinence education.\n\nBut a tight budget squeeze forced the termination of 57 programs and froze or reduced funding to many others.\n\nDemocrats sought to depict the bill as the outgrowth of misplaced Republican priorities. Citing the billions in tax cuts that Congress has enacted under the Bush presidency, many of them targeting the wealthy, Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said, \"It is inexcusable, and I find it immoral, that the first thing that goes is our investment in our children's future.\"\n\nMenendez singled out education cuts, a rich target given that one of Bush's proudest achievements is No Child Left Behind Act, a package of education revisions passed in his first term. Menendez noted that the appropriations bill cuts funding for initiatives created under No Child Left Behind by more than $800 million from last year, to a level far less than Bush had requested for fiscal 2006.\n\nNoting that 1.7 million fewer disadvantaged children will receive after-school care under the bill, and that it provides only half of the increased promise for the maximum Pell Grant, Rep. David R. Obey (Wis.), ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said, \"This bill just does not measure up to our national obligations.\"\n\nThe frustration was bipartisan. Many Republicans offered amendments or spoke out against certain cuts. Rep. Mark S. Kirk (R-Ill.) complained that the only federal program for disadvantaged gifted students was slotted for elimination. He noted that the program reached 2 million children nationwide for about $11 million per year.\n\n\"We must continue to provide support for our brightest children to succeed,\" responded Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), who chairs the Appropriations subcommittee that wrote the bill. But \"with such a tough budget allocation, some important and successful programs\" had to go by the wayside, he lamented.\n\n© 2005 The Washington Post Company\n\nA final gift\n\nCeremony recognizes 800 who donated bodies to science\n\nCumberland Times News Editorial\n\nFriday, June 24, 2005\n\nThe state of Maryland paid tribute this week to the hundreds of Marylanders who each year donate their bodies to science.\n\nIn a reflection of the wide range of people who donate their bodies for medical research, the annual ceremony at Springfield Hospital in Sykesville included a military color guard, taps, floral arrangements and a small teddy bear tucked among the flowers. A granite memorial on the hospital grounds is dedicated to \"those who gave unselfishly of themselves to advance medical education and research.\"\n\nNearly 800 donors bequeathed their bodies to science upon their death last year, including an athlete, a prisoner and an infant who lived less than a day. Protestant, Catholic and Muslim clerics offered prayers. This was the 31st year for the ceremony, which is conducted by the State Anatomy Board.\n\nBodies donated to science are used by medical students, surgeons and paramedics to further their understanding of human anatomy.\n\n\"These donations say that you have taken the time to think ahead and to think how you might help others,\" said Dr. Mark Teaford, chairman of the anatomy board. \"In one simple gesture, these donors have taught us in immeasurable ways about themselves and about humanity.\"\n\nTo learn more about donating your body to science, visit http://www.dhmh.state.md.us/anatomy or call 1-800-879-2728.\n\nCopyright © 2005 Cumberland Times-News\n\nAddiction often key to homelessness\n\nBaltimore Sun Letter to the Editor\n\nSaturday, June 25, 2005\n\nThe Sun's article \"City census finds a rise in homeless population\" (June 13) reported that 40 percent of the people who participated in the homeless census are homeless because of a health problem.\n\nWhile many addicts are not willing to identify or report their addiction or identify it as a health problem, my experience is that many of the health problems encountered, and the homelessness that results, stem from a root cause of addiction - either to drugs or alcohol or often both - that affects an addict's mental and physical health.\n\nWhile affordable housing is an important need in Baltimore, the availability of and access to drug and alcohol addiction recovery and treatment programs are equally important.\n\nAn addict who is spending all of his or her money on drugs or alcohol, who is unable to become steadily and gainfully employed, is not going to be able to afford or maintain a residence no matter how \"affordable\" it is.\n\nWe must begin to address the primary root causes of homelessness, including addiction and mental illness, to truly make an impact in the lives of the majority of Baltimore's homeless.\n\nClare M.
