        "text": "This is part of my Series on University Entrepreneurship.\n\nEntrepreneurs and venture capitalists know all too well that launching a successful startup is perhaps one of the most challenging and difficult of all human endeavors. (Please note my stress on the word \"successful\"). We've also learned that only a small sub-section of the human population are actually suited for this line of work. (They all must share some rare strain of DNA yet to be identified!)\n\nI also like to say that there is actually an even more difficult endeavor. And though I say it in a tongue-and-cheek way- it's actually true. In my opinion, launching a successful university spinoff is much harder.\n\nThe higher degree of difficulty has everything to do with the fact that the entrepreneur/vc/angel has the added hurdle of navigating the oftentimes arcane atmosphere of a given university before he or she can \"spin-out\" the technology. And depending on the particular university, this process can take anywhere from a couple of months to over a year!\n\nYou see, unlike a \"normal startup\", launching a university spinoff involves such steps as identifying and validating the university intellectual property, cultivating a strong relationship with the professor and the students in his lab, building a relationship with the appropriate people in the university's technology transfer office, and ultimately negotiating a license agreement and stock purchase agreement with them. This will entail agreeing to diligence milestones, sub-licensing fees, minimum annual royalties, reimbursing patent costs incurred by the university, paying royalties back to the university once you have a product and often making the university a minority equity partner in your venture.\n\nIt takes a special kind of person to pull all of these moving parts together and it is more than many seasoned entrepreneurs and/or investors can stomach. \"It takes forever to get anything done there.... Why should I pay royalties to the university? ... The IP is just sitting there in the lab and I'm the one that's going to create all the value!\", are all common refrains I have heard many times.\n\nMind you- these reactions are totally legitimate and natural without a doubt. For many, it may certainly not be worth the effort. Yet these criticisms always overlook a couple of key points about the nature of university technology that should be mentioned. First, some of the best and most commercializable work going on within the academy is world class and has often been under development for years- in some cases for almost a decade. Second, it is often the case that hundreds of thousands, even millions of research dollars have already gone into the underlying work by the time the entrepreneur/investor shows up for the first time. In many such cases, there is enormous value waiting to be unlocked. This would no doubt have something to do with the stunning historical IPO rate that university spinoffs enjoy.\n\nProbably the most important and overlooked point of all, however, is the fact that the professor has often devoted his or her entire professional life to this work! In many cases these professors are world experts in this particular domain/technology. This can simply be a priceless asset! Involving the professor as your chief scientific advisor and equity partner can thus bring with it an enormous positive effect.\n\nI've actually posted about bridging this cultural divide between VC, Entrepreneur and Professor before, and have advocated for cultural sensitivity on both sides. Upon reflection I've come to realize that this is really not enough. After four years and with some fifty plus university spinoffs under my belt, I now understand that something much deeper needs to occur, and in this sense, a university spinoff is no different from any other startup. It will always be a story of human relationships and how successful and enduring these relationships will be. So now we arrive at a university spinoff distilled to its very core:\n\nIt is the parable of the VC, the Entrepreneur and the Professor...\n\nIt is their story to write and it will be a human story about their relationships, their level of trust, their communication and their collegiality and fellowship.\n\nIf it is a story rife with avarice and smallness and conflict- all is lost and we have a failure on our hands. Time, money and resources will have been wasted. Years of people's lives. It is a tragedy.\n\nOn the other hand, if it becomes a story of respect, of trust, of friendship and cooperation, we have the necessary foundation upon which a successful university venture can flourish. I have not seen it work any other way.\n\nFor Part 25 in in this Series, click here\n\nThis is part of my Series on University Entrepreneurship.\n\nIn the coming weeks I’ll be discussing the popular Entrepreneur Office Hours Program we launched at Columbia University’s Venture Lab some months ago. The program is open to anyone in the Columbia community and is scheduled on a rolling basis by appointment.\n\nIn the meantime, for all you fledgling entrepreneurs out there in universities around the country and overseas, I thought I’d begin to post some inspirational information on some of the successful exits Columbia’s portfolio companies have enjoyed over the years.

It’s about a gentleman by the name of Bill Powell, a veteran of WWII, a great-grandson of Alabama slaves, and a man who endured enormous indignities and discrimination but nonetheless persevered in achieving his entrepreneurial dream. His particular ambition was to design, build and run his own golf course.\n\nUpon his return from the war no bank deigned to give him a loan and he was essentially denied the rights accorded to him in the G.I. Bill. Unbowed, he managed to scrape together some seed money for his venture, borrowing from his own brother and from two black physicians. He then proceeded to handle the rest on his own and slowly and steadily built a golf course from scratch. He finished with the front nine in 1948. After earning the means to buy some more land, he completed the back nine thirty years later- in 1978.\n\nToday his Clearview Golf Club of East Canton, Ohio is on the National Register of Historic Places and Mr. Powell, who is now 92 years old, will shortly be receiving the PGA’s Distinguished Service Award.\n\nI write quite a lot about entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial culture and you can find my various posts on this subject here. These two passages below, however, said it all to me and embody somehow what being an entrepreneur is all about:\n\n“He did much of the heavy work himself, clearing brush, pulling out fence posts and hauling away stones in a wheelbarrow. He seeded the fairways by hand, sometimes helped by Marcella, who died in June 1996 after 56 years of marriage.”\n\n“He and my mother planted most of the trees you see there bordering the first hole,” she [his daughter] said. “When you think about what he was able to accomplish here, with everything that was arrayed against him, it really is quite amazing.”\n\nFor Part 6 of this Series, click here.\n\nRelated articles by Zemanta\n\nAfter Battling Racism, Veteran Found Peace on His Golf Course (nytimes.com)\n\nThis is part of my Series on University Entrepreneurship.\n\nA big factor in having success spinning-out university startups is the ability to bridge the cultural gap between academia and the investment community. I think about this divide a great deal, both as a long-time investor in this space and perhaps even moreso now that I am the director of a prominent university venture lab which spins out 10-12 new companies a year.\n\nI was therefore delighted to recently come across this short post written by Amit Monga, Professor of Finance at the University of Alberta. He shares some excellent insights into the practice of investing in university startups courtesy of his prior experience as a venture capitalist. Dr. Monga’s central premise is that investors want to see much more than technology when they speak with a university tech transfer office. They are, after all, in the business of launching new companies, which require quite a bit more to succeed than the initial invention or discovery.\n\nWhat really caught my eye, however, is his very first point which addresses the cultural divide to which I refer above. He points out that whereas it’s very much the custom in academia to focus on a professor’s achievements in research, (including his or her credentials, awards, honors, the number of grad students in their lab, etc.), the reality is that investors first want to hear a value proposition articulated for a potential business. Monga asserts that investors must actually have the answer to this question within the first five minutes of a pitch.\n\nHaving politely sat through quite a number of such lengthy introductions that never quite arrive at describing the “pain in the market”, I must wholeheartedly agree with Dr. Monga. In fact, I would say that this value proposition should be expressed within the first two minutes of a pitch. If the investor is interested, there will be plenty of time to learn more about the professor’s academic achievements.\n\nI’ll go a step further on the subject of the cultural divide and say that I’ve seen instances where an investor’s motives are viewed extremely dimly by the academic. This too can be a problem. Again, in this instance, it’s incumbent on the tech transfer folks to invite only the most reputable people into the university and to help work through any ingrained biases that might exist on either side. For an eventual start-up to be successful, both parties will have to get along extremely well and will come to rely on each other. Start-ups are the very opposite of “arms-length” transactions.\n\nSo whether you’re an angel investor, a VC, an entrepreneur, a grad student, a post-doc or a university professor, it’s always valuable to approach university spin-offs with a great deal of cultural sensitivity and understanding. I assure you, this sort of awareness alone can make all the difference.\n\nFor Part Ten in this Series, click here\n\nThis is part of my Series on Venture Capital.\n\nLet’s start by dispelling some myths about raising capital.\n\nMyth #1: That because you've started a company, someone ought to fund it.\n\nFact: Actually, no one owes you anything. VC’s are in business to make money, not to take a bunch of fliers.\n\nI am consistently amazed at how often I hear people complaining about how “vc’s don’t want to take any risks”. Of course they don’t ! They want to de-risk deals as much as possible. Venture capitalists are already in the highest risk class of the alternative investments category. Definitely keep this in mind when you are pitching your company to investors. Remember, fewer than 1% of start-ups actually receive venture funding.\n\nMyth #2: That a first-time entrepreneur can raise Venture Capital money.\n\nFact: Of the less than 1% of start-ups that actually receive venture backing each year, you can be assured that with few exceptions the leadership/track records of those companies are well-spoken for in the venture community.\n\nIf you are a first-time entrepreneur, 99.9% of the time you will be looking at funding your company with your own money, friends and family money, or, with angel money.\n\nMyth #3: That investors will actually read your business plan\n\nFact: Investors do not read business plans. If they did, they wouldn’t be able to get any work done.\n\nThe way deals get done are through referrals to investors from trusted colleagues. A one-page executive summary is an acceptable way to initially share one’s company profile with an investor. So never bother sending your 50+ page business plan to someone unless they’ve asked for it. If you don’t believe me, see these links below from actual studies that have been carried out.\n\nhttp://bit.ly/O4kO4http://bit.ly/Cj92J\n\nMyth #4: That a first-timer can raise money without serious proof-of-concept.\n\nFact: Unless you are Marc Andreesen or an uber-successful, cashed-out entrepreneur who has made his investors a lot of money, you will need to demonstrate a certain amount of traction before professional investors will even consider investing in you.\n\nWhat I mean by this is as follows:\n\n·If you are a biotech entrepreneur, you will need to show at least strong results in animal studies.\n\n·If you are a medical device entrepreneur, you will need to show a working prototype, validation and support from multiple clinicians who would use such a product, as well as a clear path through FDA approval.\n\n·If you are a tech entrepreneur, you will need to show heavy traffic and consistent month on month growth to your site.\n\nMyth #5: That because you have spoken to a venture capitalist about your company you are “in talks with investors”.\n\nFact: What this simply means is that you met someone that may or may not be interested in your start-up.\n\nSpare yourself a lot of heart-ache and lower your expectations. If you’ve had a conversation or pitched someone who happens to be an investor, don’t get your hopes up until they are actually ‘in diligence’ and you have a term sheet."
