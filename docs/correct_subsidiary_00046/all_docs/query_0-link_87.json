        "text": "UM partnership keeps jobs in Montana\n\nUniversity of Montana\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\nPublished in\n\nVision 2017\n\n·\n\n7 min read\n\n·\n\nMar 8, 2017\n\n--\n\nBy Cary Shimek\n\nIn 1980, a guy named Edgar Ribi started a biotech company in his Hamilton, Montana, garage. He and his partners had figured out how to detoxify a certain component in the cell wall of bacteria, and that knowledge allowed them to create MPL (monophosphoryl lipid A) — a substance that improves the immune response of vaccines.\n\nRibi Immunochem took off, adding employees and buildings on the edge of town with the lovely Bitterroot Mountains as a backdrop. (Truly, if one starts an advanced biotech company that can exist anywhere, why not locate it in scenic Montana with all the extra outdoor amenities?)\n\nThe company experienced two decades of success before being snatched up by Seattle-based Corixa Corp., a company seeking to expand its own programs with a strong portfolio of vaccine boosters such as MPL. Then in 2005, Corixa was in turn purchased by the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, which used MPL in its new HPV vaccine to prevent cervical cancer in women worldwide.\n\nMPL — still manufactured in Hamilton — is used in many of GlaxoSmithKline vaccine products around the globe. Things became complicated two years ago when GSK announced it would buy Novartis Vaccines, another large drug company. A multitude of research and manufacturing sites were acquired, and GSK officials decided they needed to simplify the vaccine side of their business by having just three research-and-development centers in the world. In the U.S., that site was Rockville, Maryland.\n\nThis meant the research side of the business in Hamilton would close. Employees were told they could relocate to Maryland or GSK would support them in finding another option.\n\n“Nobody on the team wanted to relocate outside of Montana,” says Jay Evans, a native of eastern Washington and former GSK researcher. “We would have lost everybody if we moved our R&D team to Maryland. Most of the team has been together for more than 15 years. We have families and kids, and we love the Montana lifestyle. The team works very well together — we are greater as a team.”\n\nSo they devised a plan to keep their merry band of researchers together by forming a new company, Inimmune, which would partner with the nearest sizeable research institution, UM in Missoula. Evans, named president and CEO of the fledgling company, knew UM could provide fee-based access to essential research services. He also knew Scott Whittenburg, UM vice president for research and creative scholarship, and the first step was meeting with Whittenburg and Joe Fanguy, UM director of technology transfer.\n\nA complicated yearlong dance began between Inimmune, UM, a fully supportive GSK and the National Institutes of Health. Soon others around campus became involved.\n\nThe net result is the transfer of $16 million in NIH contracts to UM. GSK also donated millions in lab and office equipment to the effort. In January 2015, Inimmune opened its doors at MonTEC, UM’s business incubator, located across the river from campus. Evans says the availability of laboratory space at MonTEC was key, and Inimmune will remain there for the foreseeable future. The NIH research will relocate to UM’s Health Sciences Building on the main campus when a remodel there is completed.\n\nFifteen former GSK employees now have split appointments between Inimmune and UM. Evans, for example, is also a research professor in UM’s Division of Biological Sciences. Faculty appointments purposely were split between various UM research units to promote interdepartmental collaboration. The team now has 23 people working in MonTEC, with more hires expected, and UM grad students have been added to the operation.\n\n“This was a great example of a public-private partnership keeping jobs in Montana,” Evans says. “It was a difficult process from a legal perspective, involving a big university bureaucracy, one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies and the federal government. This only came together because everybody involved wanted to make it happen.”\n\n“It was good for the state because we saved 15 good jobs that were going to be lost,” Whittenburg says. “This is a growing company, so the long-term benefits to the area should be sizable.”\n\nEvans says Inimmune researchers are seeking treatments for everything from autoimmunity and allergies to cancer. The company made a profit during its first year of operation by contracting its services out to other companies, and it has three different products poised for Phase I clinical trials. Company scientists dream of alleviating or even curing food allergies, seasonal allergies and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and Crohn’s disease.\n\n“We have very strong preclinical data in animal models,” he says. “Of course, going from an animal model to human beings is a big step, but that’s how new drugs are advanced with both efficacy and safety as top priorities. Having a strong team and multiple shots on goal is the key to success in this industry, so we have a diverse platform of technologies in development.”\n\nCraig Johnson, a senior scientist with Inimmune and now UM, has been with the company since the Ribi Immunochem days. He’s excited to get back to doing basic research with a small biotech company.\n\n“When you are purchased by a big pharmaceutical company, often they have their own agenda, and lot of our projects got lost,” he says. “Now it’s our chance to shine.”\n\nRob Child, the company’s business development lead and a UM research scientist, laughingly described moving expensive laboratory equipment in a rickety trailer from Hamilton to Missoula — all in the dead of winter.\n\n“From my perspective, it’s almost a best-case scenario how everything has gone,” he says. “Now we can take these compounds that were developed and all these years of work and experience and put it together into something we truly own — that we drive ourselves. It’s a really hopeful feeling.” •\n\nCenter Designed to Nurture Startups\n\nAs Inimmune workers settled into their new partnership with UM and worked more closely with the University’s research enterprise, it became clear that many campus scientists had great ideas but needed assistance moving them forward. The folks at Inimmune, on the other hand, had years of experience translating research from the lab bench to Phase I clinical trials.\n\nSo Jay Evans of Inimmune and Scott Whittenburg, UM’s research vice president, hatched a plan: Use the teams’ experience as the foundation for a new Center for Translational Medicine. The center will help faculty, staff and students across the Montana University System move their research ideas from bench to bedside and provide new medicines for improving the lives of people. The center also will seek to increase funding at UM through new research collaborations and licensing. The center will link resources and expertise across diverse disciplines and departments.\n\n“The people at Inimmune are very interested in helping others generate startup companies,” Whittenburg says. “They have good connections to major pharmaceutical companies, so we see a lot of potential for the new center. It’s all about trying to create more economic development for our region.”\n\nAt the end of last year, about 30 UM faculty members already had started attending center meetings. Most are from major research units, but some are from sectors such as computer science, mathematics and business. And partners from other Montana campuses also are welcome.\n\nEvans says the new center, in conjunction with UM’s Office of Technology Transfer, can answer a lot of questions: How do I move an idea or research finding to a clinical trial to help people? How do I approach a pharmaceutical company with my idea? How do I patent my idea and then license it to generate revenue for UM? How do I document and archive my research correctly to protect my intellectual property? How do I write a small-business research grant?\n\nEvans says a pitch to a pharmaceutical company structured like an academic research proposal or presentation likely is dead on arrival. The new center can improve proposals with a market analysis, product profile and information on target populations, medical need, safety, manufacturing and scalability.\n\nResearchers may apply for external grants using the center, and a portion of that money from successful applications will be banked to nurture great ideas among those who can’t land outside funding. Evans says many of the best translational research ideas aren’t great basic academic science that federal funding agencies will support — such as developing a drug — but the idea may result in viable licensing revenue or a new biotech company in Missoula. So the center will help address this funding gap by providing money for preliminary data that might attract assistance from an outside company or a small-business grant.\n\n“The more biotech companies that locate in Montana, the better it will be for everybody,” Evans says. “Because if one company falls on hard times and those employees need jobs, then there are other companies to go to. It’s good to have a cluster where employees can move back and forth and share\n\nideas.” •"
