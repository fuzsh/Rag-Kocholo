        "text": "SEATTLE--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Proniras Corporation (“Proniras”), a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of substance use and specialty central nervous system disorders, today announced the successful completion of a $4.65 million funding round, marking a significant milestone in its ongoing Series B financing, which aims to secure up to $9 million. The new Series B funding will be used to support a Phase 1 clinical study of the Company’s lead program PRN-001-01 (tezampanel), a novel modulator of glutaminergic signaling designed to treat patients seeking to recover from opioid addiction and associated conditions. The Phase 1 study will apply the unique and groundbreaking mechanism of action of PRN-001-01 (tezampanel) to reduce brain over-activation in circuits involved in drug withdrawal, addiction, and mental illness without relying on direct stimulation or antagonism of the opioid system. PRN-001-01 (tezampanel) has the potential to provide significant improvement in the treatment of opiate withdrawal syndrome, opioid overdoses, and conversion to long term medications that can help patients addicted to opiates to achieve full remission from their illness. The Series B financing was co-led by funds managed by Accelerator Life Science Partners and ARCH Venture Partners, with participation from both new and existing investors, including Watson Fund, LP, WRF Capital (the investment vehicle for Washington Research Foundation), and other undisclosed investors. PRN-001-01 (tezampanel) is a novel small molecule compound that will be the first parenteral therapeutic to be evaluated for the treatment of symptoms associated with opiate withdrawal in a Phase 1 clinical study. Previously investigated for its potential in acute migraine therapy with positive outcomes observed in over 400 human subjects, PRN-001-01 (tezampanel) has also demonstrated encouraging results in various preclinical models of seizure disorders, suggesting the use of the drug in other therapeutic applications with high unmet medical need. Proniras licensed exclusive global rights to PRN-001-01 (tezampanel) from Eli Lilly and Company in 2017. In conjunction with the Series B financing, Proniras has appointed Steven Gillis, Ph.D., as Chairman and Atul Saran as an independent member to the Company’s Board of Directors. Dr. Gillis and Mr. Saran join Thong Q. Le, Senior Managing Director from Accelerator Life Science Partners, on the Proniras Board of Directors. With the insights gained throughout their professional careers, Dr. Gillis and Mr. Saran will positively impact guidance on the Company’s strategic decision-making and product development plans. In addition, their extensive networks in the industry will help Proniras on multiple fronts. Dr. Gillis has more than 30 years of experience in the life sciences industry and is focused on the evaluation of new life science technologies and also on the development and growth of ARCH's biotechnology portfolio companies. In addition to serving as Chairman of the Board for Proniras, he serves as a Director of multiple ARCH biotechnology portfolio companies, including Homology Medicines (FIXX), 48 Bio, Pheast Therapeutics, BE Biopharma, SonoThera, Dispatch Biotherapeutics, and Carrick Therapeutics. He serves as Chairman of Faraday Pharmaceuticals, eGenesis, HiberCell, hC Bioscience, Skylark Bio, Walden Biosciences, OncoResponse, Mozart Therapeutics, Bitterroot Bio, Vilya, TFC Therapeutics, and VBI Vaccines (VBIV). Dr. Gillis also serves as a director of Takeda Pharmaceuticals (TAK). Dr. Gillis was a founder and director of Corixa Corp. and served as the company's Chief Executive Officer from its inception and as its Chairman from 1999 until its acquisition in 2005 by GlaxoSmithKline. Prior to Corixa, Dr. Gillis held numerous positions at Immunex Corp., including founder and director. Dr. Gillis is a trained immunologist with over 300 peer-reviewed publications in the areas of molecular and tumor immunology. Atul Saran currently serves as Chief Executive Officer of IntegerBio, a privately held biotechnology company focused on developing immunovirology therapeutics. Prior to IntegerBio, Mr. Saran served in various roles at Emergent BioSolutions, a specialty biopharmaceutical company focused on opioid overdose, biodefense, and other public health threats, most recently as Executive Vice President & Chief Scientific and Development Officer with responsibility for the company's research, development, medical, and regulatory activities as well as corporate strategy and M&A. Before that, Mr. Saran was Emergent's General Counsel and Corporate Secretary with responsibility for corporate strategy, M&A, legal, public affairs, and government affairs. Prior to Emergent, Mr. Saran served as Senior Vice President and General Counsel at MacroGenics, and before that he held positions of increasing responsibility at MedImmune/AstraZeneca culminating with Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Ventures for MedImmune and Vice President, Corporate Development & Strategy for AstraZeneca. Mr. Saran previously served as a Director on several boards, including Arriva, VentiRx, and Xencor. \"We are honored to welcome Dr. Steve Gillis as our Chairman and Atul Saran as a new independent director to our Board of Directors,\" said Thong Q. Le, Senior Managing Director of Accelerator Life Science Partners, and CEO of Proniras. \"Their wealth of knowledge and industry experience will be instrumental in guiding Proniras through its next phase of growth. We look forward to their leadership and contributions as we continue to advance Proniras through the next stages of product development.\" About Proniras Corporation Proniras Corporation is a clinical-stage biotechnology developing novel small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of substance use and specialty central nervous system disorders. The Company’s lead program PRN-001-01 (tezampanel) is being clinical developed as a treatment option for opioid withdrawal and related disorders of addiction. Although effective treatments exist for opioid addiction, painful and difficult withdrawal is one of the primary reasons why current treatment fails, and relapse occurs. By alleviating the symptoms associated with opioid withdrawal, Proniras hopes to help patients successfully discontinue opioid usage and sustain an opioid-free life. Proniras was formed in 2017 by Accelerator Life Science Partners.

A mail-order diabetic testing supplies company previously owned by Alere allegedly violated the False Claims Act. Now, Abbott will have to pay $160 million to settle the allegations. Alere acquired Arriva Medical, which at one point was the nation's largest Medicare mail-order diabetic testing supplier. Abbott acquired Alere in October 2017 in a contentious deal that Abbott fought hard to get out of it. Now, Abbott is paying the price for mistakes allegedly made by Alere and Arriva, which ceased business operations in December 2017. “This matter relates to alleged activities that took place prior to Abbott’s acquisition of Alere and was previously disclosed by Alere in financial filings,\" an Abbott spokesperson told MD+DI. \"This business was discontinued shortly after the transaction closed.” The settlement resolves allegations that Arriva and Alere made, or caused, claims to Medicare that were false because kickbacks were paid to Medicare beneficiaries, patients were ineligible to receive meters, or patients were deceased. “Paying illegal inducements to Medicare beneficiaries in the form of free items and routine copayment waivers can result in overutilization and waste taxpayer funds,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton for the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “We will continue to protect the integrity of the Medicare program by pursuing fraudulent claims arising from violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable reimbursement requirements.” The United States alleged that, from April 2010 until the end of 2016, Arriva, with Alere’s approval, paid kickbacks to Medicare beneficiaries by providing them “free” or “no cost” glucometers and by routinely waiving, or not collecting, their copayments for meters and diabetic testing supplies. Specifically, the United States alleged that Arriva advertised that glucometers would be “free,” and then during intake calls offered Medicare beneficiaries a “no cost guarantee,” under which Arriva would provide the meters at “no cost” if Medicare denied payment, which typically happened because the beneficiaries were not yet entitled to a new glucometer paid for by Medicare. Arriva also allegedly offered and provided existing customers “free” additional meters to induce them to reorder testing supplies from Arriva. Arriva also allegedly routinely waived, and failed to make reasonable efforts to collect, Medicare copayments. It allegedly failed to send invoices to beneficiaries, and failed to take other basic steps, like sending collection letters or making phone calls, to collect copayments. Specifically, Arriva allegedly systematically waived “small” dollar copayments without informing beneficiaries of their copayment obligations by sending them an invoice, and allegedly automatically waived other unpaid copayments after sending no more than three invoices seeking payment and making no other collection efforts. Arriva also allegedly waived copayments when customers complained that Arriva had advertised and otherwise indicated that their supplies would be free or at no cost. “The False Claims Act and related statutes exist to protect the public fisc and to ensure companies do not benefit from unfair competition by gaining an illegal advantage over competitors,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Mary Jane Stewart for the Middle District of Tennessee. “When companies engage in such practice, they can expect to be held accountable for their actions.” The settlement also resolves allegations that Arriva and Alere caused the submission of false claims to Medicare for glucometers because Arriva, with Alere’s approval, allegedly systematically provided to all of its new patients, and billed Medicare for, a meter without regard to the patients’ eligibility for one. Medicare beneficiaries are only eligible to seek reimbursement for a new meter once every five years. Arriva also allegedly repeatedly billed Medicare for new meters for existing patients where Arriva itself had previously billed Medicare for meters for those patients within the five-year window. Finally, the settlement resolves claims that Arriva submitted false claims to Medicare on behalf of deceased beneficiaries. In November 2016, the Medicare program revoked Arriva’s Medicare supplier number for doing so. “Engaging in activities that result in the submission of false claims to Medicare diverts funding from the necessary treatment and medical supplies beneficiaries need,” said Special Agent in Charge Derrick L. Jackson of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “We will continue working with our law enforcement partners to hold accountable those who seek to enrich themselves by submitting false claims to federal health care programs.” The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Gregory Goodman, a former employee at an Arriva call center in Antioch, Tennessee. Under those provisions, a private party can file an action on behalf of the United States and receive a portion of any recovery. The Act also permits the United States to intervene and take over the litigation of such actions, as the United States did here. Goodman will receive $28,548,749 as his share of the recovery. The qui tam case is captioned United States ex rel. Goodman v. Arriva Medical LLC et al., Case No. 3:13-cv-00760 (M.D. Tenn.). Arriva’s founders, David Wallace and Timothy Stocksdale, previously paid $1 million to resolve allegations that they participated in the kickback scheme. Ted Albin and Albin’s company, Grapevine Billing and Consulting Services, are not parties to the settlement and remain defendants in the ongoing litigation. The United States filed suit against Albin and Grapevine shortly after it intervened in the qui tam action against Arriva and Alere. Alere Recently Settled Other False Claims Allegations Alere has been on the Justice Department's radar for a while. In July the company agreed to pay $38.75 million to settle allegations that Alere entities sold diagnostic devices knowing the devices had a materially defective algorithm. Doing so violated the False Claims Act, the government claimed, because the company billed, and caused others to bill, the Medicare program for defective rapid point-of-care testing devices. The settlement announced today resolves allegations that, from 2008 to 2016, Alere knowingly sold defective INRatio blood coagulation monitors used by Medicare beneficiaries taking anticoagulant drugs, such as warfarin. For those patients, blood coagulation monitoring is essential to determining a clinically appropriate and safe dosage for their medications. Too much of an anticoagulant drug can cause major bleeding, and too little of the drug can cause blood clots and strokes. Since at least 2008, Alere allegedly knew that the software algorithm used in each version of its INRatio monitors contained a material defect. Based on its own internal research, as well as external complaints and warnings, Alere allegedly was aware that INRatio devices had a “system limitation” that produced inaccurate and unreliable results for some patients. The United States alleged that, despite awareness that INRatio systems were linked to over a dozen deaths and hundreds of injuries, including intra-cerebral hemorrhaging and cardiovascular events following bleeding episodes, Alere concealed the defect for years and billed Medicare for the use of defective INRatio devices. Alere allegedly failed to take appropriate corrective actions until 2016, when the devices were removed from the market following a nationwide Class I product recall at FDA's request. Prior to being acquired by Abbott, Alere had to settle another Department of Justice investigation related to its triage cardiac and toxicology products. That investigation, among other revelations that came to light after Abbott first agreed to buy Alere, drove Abbott to take Alere to court in an effort to get out of the merger. Still, Abbott's diagnostics business has benefited from the technology it acquired through the $5.3 billion deal. That technology helped to put Abbott ahead of the pack when the world was in dire need of rapid COVID-19 tests last year."
