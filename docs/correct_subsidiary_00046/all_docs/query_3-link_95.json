The investigators adhered to Title 21, Part 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations and the recommendations from the Declaration of Helsinki in the performance of investigations involving human subjects. Acknowledgments The DCI staff would like to acknowledge the significant and varied contributions of many individuals and organizations, all of whom were instrumental in making Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC) research a resounding success in 2006. We appreciate the support and participation of the Western Regional Medical Center (WRMC) Command Leadership for fostering an environment where \"Care with Compassion\" is the motto and meticulous scientific process is the standard. We would like to thank our many corporate and industry research sponsors and partners, especially those foundations that foster military, medical research and support the Madigan community. We also would like to acknowledge the dedicated members of the Madigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), the Clinical Investigation Committee (CIC), and the Human Use Committee (HUC) whose tireless efforts ensured quality science and ethical conduct of our research. And, last but certainly not least, we would like to thank the hundreds of MAMC’s military health care beneficiaries who volunteered to participate in so many demanding research studies, often when the only conceivable benefits were to individuals other than themselves. 8 Foreword Clinical Studies Service (CSS) The Clinical Studies Service has as its mission to increase the quantity and the quality of clinical trials that are open and available to military beneficiaries. This is accomplished by working with investigators in the clinics to determine their research interests, commonly seen disease states, and logistical hurdles to implementing trials. The goal is that each clinic have the support staff necessary to offer patients clinical trial options for most commonly seen diseases. Successful collaborations over the past year include progress toward participation as the only IRB outside of the National Capitol Area to join the United States Military Cancer Institute IRB. Successes in terms of hiring research personnel include participation with USUHS to provide a 3-year grant to hire a research nurse to the Hematology/Oncology Clinic and offering a contract to a physician-researcher to perform clinical trials within primary care clinics, primarily Internal medicine and Family Practice. Other successes include recruiting clinical trials to multiple specialty services, including Cardiology, Oncology, Orthopedic Surgery, and Cardiothoracic Surgery. The goals for the next year are to recruit clinical trials to MAMC that will allow hiring of research staff in the Family Medicine, Neurology, and Emergency Medicine services, improve the collaboration with the USMCI, and represent MAMC interests with CIRO in simplifying and standardizing research protocols and IRB practices, with a goal of increasing collaboration between military medical centers. Laboratory Animal Resources Service (LARS) LARS remains heavily involved in the trauma training course offered to combat and combat support units of Ft. Lewis and other units under the Western Regional Medical Command. This course has trained over 220 medics, physician assistants, nurses, and doctors in combat trauma management; 64 Emergency Department residents in emergency procedures; 14 urology residents and 24 surgery residents in advanced laparoscopic techniques; and 88 providers in pediatric intubation. LARS has supported the training of more than 72 Special Forces medics. There is increased collaboration between LARS, the Anderson Simulation Center, and the Medical Simulation Training Center to stay current with simulator technology which reduces the number of animals required for effective training. The newt limb regeneration study is ongoing. LARS supports research studies involving cancer metastasis, hypoperfusion/reperfusion injuries, and acute inflammatory reactions. There are new protocols being planned to study effectiveness of a new hemorrhage control material. Research Administration Service (RAS) FY06 was a typically busy year for RAS with a total of 127 new protocols and 460 active protocols. New initial and continuing review protocols continued to show 100% 9 HIPAA compliance. New protocols reviewed at convened IRB meetings averaged less than those in FY05 overall, but the numbers of ERC protocols increased slightly. However, formal research conducted in MAMC and the Western Regional Command Medical continues to be a solid and viable program. No RAS personnel staffing changes have occurred. The internal audit program continues to be refined, with 21 protocols having been audited. Most audits have shown satisfactory results; however, findings in one instance raised concern about the conduct of retrospective review protocols and the use of subject’s protected health information. The number of audits planned during FY07 will be double those conducted in FY06 and will include a few minimal risk retrospective review protocols to ascertain whether the use of codes and the de-linking procedures described in the protocol are being adequately carried out. The RAS/Protocol Management Quality Improvement Team has continued to refine and implement improvements to local IRB administrative policies and procedures: 1. Updated entire SOP book in preparation for FDA inspection, which RAS is still awaiting. 2. Begun consolidating human use protocol template into one universal format for local and multicenter studies. 3. Turned the Expedited Review Committee (ERC) into a weekly (as needed) meeting for reviewing ERC eligible protocols. Participated in coordinating 2 semi-annual Applied Research Training (ART) Courses (formerly called Introduction to Clinical Research Course), which are held in collaboration with the MAMC Faculty Development Fellows. Attendance averages about 50 students. Additionally, investigators are still obtaining the required Human Subjects Protections training through DCI’s subscription with the University of Miami’s Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI). In FY07, RAS plans to: (1) implement a universal human use protocol template; (2) continually expand the DCI website to offer more information and reporting options for investigators; (3) continue to develop and refine the constructive internal audit program; (4) participate in planning the semi-annual ART Course and annual Madigan Research Day; (5) work more closely with the Foundations (Geneva, Jackson, and True) to improve communication for the research program; (6) host and conduct the annual DCI HELPER Course for research coordinators working within MAMC. Research Operations Service (ROS) DCI’s Research Operations Service at Madigan Army Medical Center experienced continuing growth in FY 2006. Acquisition of a SELDI-TOF mass spectrophotometer ushered in the official start of high throughput proteomics work at Madigan. The SELDI 10 technology offers enormous potential for protein biomarker discovery in the analysis of clinical samples and application to ongoing research projects. ROS made significant progress introducing the SELDI-based high throughput proteomic capabilities to MAMC. In our initial longitudinal studies of the human Pregnancy Proteome, study staff enrolled and collected samples at various points of gestation from over 110 patients. ROS also welcomed three new medical technologists to the lab who will be essential in supporting recent increases in GME research activity at MAMC. The laboratory maintained active basic research protocols with 4 of 6 medical departments at MAMC including the departments of Surgery (General Surgery, Urology, and Orthopedics), Pediatrics, Pathology, and OB/GYN (Maternal Fetal Medicine Fellowship). Residents won 2 separate awards at the 9th Annual Madigan Research Day for research conducted within the lab. In further support of our GME mission, ROS hosted the 2006 DCI Molecular Biology Short Course. The 5-day lab and lecture course provides novice clinical researchers with perspective on modern molecular and cellular biology techniques and the relationship between basic and clinical research. The ROS laboratory made marked progress on several basic science research protocols including but not limited to the following: a) methods for creating transgenic plants to produce proteins of clinical, environmental and military-unique utility; b) development of cell-based assays against neurotoxins and characterization of G protein coupled receptors using neurons derived from mouse embryonic stem cell culture; c) characterization of the CXCR4/SDF-lalpha chemokine axis as a potential means of directing therapeutic cells to damaged tissue; d) characterization of the molecular mechanisms of limb regeneration in newts. ROS maintained an active internship program with Bates Technical College wherein interns gain valuable real world experience while increasing laboratory productivity. In FY07, ROS looks forward to promoting sustainable and synergistic research efforts among laboratory staff and medical center residents in support of our graduate medical education mission. 11 Intentionally left blank 12 UNIT SUMMARY - FISCAL YEAR 2006 A.
