Registered sources in Montana include oil and gas facilities, crushers and screens, concrete batch plants, and asphalt plants. All other industry would fall under our permitting program. Click below to find more information about existing permitting and registration sources, including what to do if a change of ownership occurs, how to enter annual emission inventory, and how to meet compliance requirements.\n\nPermitted Sources\n\nIntroduction\n\nAny source with the potential to emit regulated pollutants above the following threshold levels is required to submit an application:\n\nAny source emitting more than 5 ton/year of lead (Pb) or 25 tons/year or any other pollutant; OR\n\nAn incinerator of any kind\n\nAny source with the potential to emit regulated pollutants above the following threshold levels is required to submit a Title V permit application.\n\nA source that has the Potential To Emit (PTE)>100 tpy of any criteria pollutant, which include sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter 2.5, particulate matter 10 , carbon monoxide\n\nPTE>10 tpy of any individual hazardous air pollutant (HAP) or\n\nPTE>25 tpy of combined HAPs\n\nWhen required by other applicable regulations (For example, NSPS or MACT).\n\nMontana Air Quality Permits(MAQPs)\n\nSome general guidance for minor source operation is described below.\n\nIf you have questions, please call 406-444-3490\n\nDo I need to renew permit?\n\nA valid Montana Air Quality Permit (MAQP) does not expire. However, preconstruction permitting approval associated with a specific project generally expires if commencement of construction or contractual obligations that would constitute a substantial loss associated with the project has not occurred within 3 years. A facility requiring an MAQP will generally require modification of that MAQP for any new or modified emitting unit(s) or emissions increase(s) which do not qualify as a de minims change as provided by the Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.8.745.\n\nThe Department may revoke an MAQP or any portion of an MAQP in accordance with ARM 17.8.763 upon written request of the permittee, or for a violation of any requirements of the Clean Air Act of Montana, rules adopted under that Act, or any applicable requirement contained in the Montana State Implementation Plan.\n\nWhat do I need to do if I make changes to my permitted facility?\n\nA facility must apply for a modification to their existing MAQP for changes not covered by the de minimis permitting exclusion provided by the Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.8.745. In most cases, changes allowed by the de minimis rule requires a minimum 10-day notification to the Department prior to the change, and must provide specific information required by the rule including information necessary to determine the change in potential to emit of the facility. The Department strives to provide written response to a written proposal of applicability of the de minimis permitting exclusion upon request. Contact the Department for further information at 406.444.3490.\n\nTo apply for a modification to your existing MAQP, utilize the application forms available here and submit to : DEQ-ARMB-Admin@mt.gov\n\nWhat do I need to do if a facility with a Montana Air Quality Permit changes owner/operator?\n\nThe Administrative Rules of Montana (ARM) 17.8.765 provides that a Montana Air Quality Permit (MAQP) may be transferred from one owner or operator to another if the Department receives written notice of intent to transfer, including the names and authorized signatures of the transferor and transferee. The Department has developed an Intent to Transfer Ownership form which may help administrate this. A request to transfer ownership can be submitted to DEQ-ARMB-Admin@mt.gov.\n\nDo I need to submit an emissions inventory?\n\nYes. Annual emissions data can be submitted via the Air Emission Inventory Entry System\n\nAn Instruction Manual is available here.\n\nData entry can be completed here.\n\nAre there any fees associated with my facility?\n\nYes. In addition to application fees, the Department also requires annual operation fees. Operation fees are collected on an annual basis based on the emissions submit to the Air Emissions Inventory Entry System.\n\nHow to prepare for source testing and reporting?\n\nFacilities preparing to conduct a source test or submit test results must following the Montana Source Test Protocol and Procedures Manual (MSTPPM). A source test protocol may be submitted according to the MSTPPM or it may use the alternative source test protocol worksheet and supplement (when testing more than one emission unit). An example of a completed worksheet is available. Source test reports must follow the requirements of the MSTPPM.\n\nSource Test Protocol Worksheet\n\nSource Test Protocol 3-page Supplement\n\nSource Test Protocol Example\n\nMontana Source Test Protocol and Procedures Manual\n\nTitle V Sources\n\nSome general guidance for Title V sources is described below.\n\nIf you have questions, please call 406-444-3490\n\nWhat is a Title V Operating Permit?\n\nTitle V of the Clean Air Act requires ‘major sources’ of air pollutants and certain other sources to obtain and operate in compliance with a Title V Operating Permit.\n\nA major source with respect to Title V is a source above that emits above the major source thresholds:\n\nEmits over 100 tons per year of any criteria pollutant;\n\nEmits over 10 tons per year of a single HAP; or\n\nEmits over 25 tons per year of any combination of HAPs.\n\nThese facilities are subject to and the associated operating permits are issued pursuant to the Administrative Rules of Montana Title 17, Chapter 8, Subchapter 12 (ARM 17.8.12).\n\nOnce you have a Title V Permit\n\nThe goal of a TV Operating Permit is to serve as a single document that contains all the applicable requirements associated with the source. The Operating Permit contains permit limits, monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements that are designed to make sure the source knows when it is or isn’t in compliance with air quality regulations.\n\nOperating permits require annual certifications that the source is complying with all applicable requirements. Additionally, permits must be renewed every 5 years.\n\nWhen do I need to make a change to my Title V Permit?\n\nTitle V Operating Permits can be updated. Most changes that require revision to a Montana Air Quality Permit will require revision to the Title V. See the What do I need to do if I make changes to my permitted facility? section regarding the MAQP.\n\nThere are different types of modifications. These include minor modifications, significant modifications, and administrative amendments. Please call 406-444-3490 to discuss your specific situation.\n\nWhat do I need to do if I sell my facility?\n\nComplete the Intent to Transfer Ownership form and submit to DEQ-ARMB-Admin@mt.gov\n\nWhat is a Responsible Official?\n\nThe Responsible Official (RO) has the duty to verify and document that the information submitted is compliant with all applicable requirements in the Operating Permit. The RO can be a corporate officer (a person in charge of a principal business function such as a president, vice president, secretary or treasurer, or any other person who performs similar policy or decision-making functions for the corporation) or their duly authorized representative as approved by the Department, who is responsible for the overall operation of the permitted facility and either supervises 250 or more persons or is in charge of $25 million or more in sales or expenditures.\n\nThe RO signs as a representative of the corporation, but may be individually liable under environmental criminal provisions.\n\nWhat is required if a change in Responsible Official occurs/is requested?\n\nPlease notify the Department of the new Responsible Official, including name of the Responsible Official, Title, how the person qualifies as a Responsible Official, and contact information including phone number, mailing address, and email. Please also clearly request an Administrative Amendment to your Title V to initiate the Title V being updated to reflect the new Responsible Official in the permit. The Title V permit need only list the Responsible Official’s name. This submission needs to be signed by the new Responsible Official.\n\nDo I need to renew my permit?\n\nYes. Title V permits expire every 5 years. Your Title V expiration date should be reflected on the first page of your permit (the first page following the cover letter). A Title V renewal is a separate and distinct requirement from other permit actions such as administrative amendments, minor modifications, and significant modifications. Title V expiration dates are extended only through a renewal action. A complete Title V renewal application is due no less than 6 months prior to your Title V expiration date.\n\nIf your permit has already expired, you may be covered under an application shield. Please consult ARM 17.8.1221. Please call 406-444-3490 with questions.\n\nDo I need to submit an emission inventory?\n\nYes.
