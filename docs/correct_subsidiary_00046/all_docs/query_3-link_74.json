CANVAS is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that randomized participants to canagliflozin 100 or 300âmg or placebo added to routine therapy. The present post hoc analysis assessed the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin 100 and 300âmg compared with placebo in subsets of patients from CANVAS who were taking background DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists with or without other antihyperglycaemic agents at weekâ18. Of the 4330 patients in CANVAS, 316 were taking DPP-4 inhibitors and 95 were taking GLP-1 receptor agonists. At 18âweeks, canagliflozin 100 and 300âmg provided larger placebo-subtracted reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors [-0.56% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.77, -0.35), and -0.75% (95% CI: -0.95, -0.54), respectively] and GLP-1 receptor agonists [-1.00% (95% CI: -1.35, -0.65), and -1.06% (95% CI: -1.43, -0.69), respectively]. Body weight and blood pressure (BP) reductions were seen with canagliflozin versus placebo in both subsets. Higher incidences of genital mycotic infections and osmotic diuresis-related adverse events (AEs) were seen with canagliflozin compared with placebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was numerically higher with canagliflozin versus placebo; nearly all events occurred in patients on background insulin or insulin secretagogues. In patients on background incretin mimetics, canagliflozin improved HbA1c, body weight and BP, with an increased incidence of AEs related to SGLT2 inhibition.

GLP-1 and its related incretin hormone, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), a key determinant of incretin bioactivity. Two classes of medications that enhance incretin action, GLP-1R agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We review herein the cardiovascular biology of GLP-1R agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors, including direct and indirect effects on cardiomyocytes, blood vessels, adipocytes, the control of blood pressure and postprandial lipoprotein secretion. Both GLP-1R activation and DPP-4 inhibition exert multiple cardioprotective actions in preclinical models of cardiovascular dysfunction, and short term studies in human subjects appear to demonstrate modest yet beneficial actions on cardiac function in subjects with ischemic heart disease. Incretin-based agents control body weight, improve glycemic control with a low risk of hypoglycemia, decrease blood pressure, inhibit the secretion of intestinal chylomicrons, and reduce inflammation in preclinical studies. Nevertheless, there is limited information on the cardiovascular actions of these agents in patients with diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. Hence, a more complete understanding of the cardiovascular risk:benefit ratio of incretin-based therapies will require completion of long term cardiovascular outcome studies currently underway in patients with T2DM.

By acting on the pancreas and brain, they potentiate insulin secretion and induce weight loss to preserve normoglycemia. Despite this, incretin therapy has been associated with off-target effects, including nausea and gastrointestinal disturbance. A novel photoswitchable incretin mimetic based upon the specific glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide was designed, synthesized, and tested. This peptidic compound, termed LirAzo, possesses an azobenzene photoresponsive element, affording isomer-biased GLP-1R signaling as a result of differential activation of second messenger pathways in response to light. While the trans isomer primarily engages calcium influx, the cis isomer favors cAMP generation. LirAzo thus allows optical control of insulin secretion and cell survival. Â© 2015 The Authors.

GLP-1 mimetics are on the market as treatments for type 2 diabetes. Both GLP-1 and GIP mimetics have shown neuroprotective properties in previous studies. In addition, the GLP-1 mimetic exendin-4 has shown protective effects in a clinical trial in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Novel GLP-1/GIP dual-agonist peptides have been developed to treat diabetes. Here, we report the neuroprotective effects of a novel dual agonist (DA-JC1) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. MPTP was injected once daily (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally) for 7 days and the dual agonist was coinjected once daily (50 nmol/kg intraperitoneally). We found that the drug reduced most of the MPTP-induced motor impairments in the rotarod, open-field locomotion, and muscle strength test. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and striatum was reduced by MPTP and increased by DA-JC1. Synapse numbers (synaptophysin expression) were reduced in the substantia nigra and the striatum by MPTP and DA-JC1 reversed this effect. The activation of a chronic inflammation response by MPTP was considerably reduced by the dual agonist (DA) (astroglia and microglia activation). Therefore, dual agonists show promise as a novel treatment of PD.\n\nIncretin therapies: highlighting common features and differences in the modes of action of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nNauck, M\n\n2016-03-01\n\nOver the last few years, incretin-based therapies have emerged as important agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). These agents exert their effect via the incretin system, specifically targeting the receptor for the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is partly responsible for augmenting glucose-dependent insulin secretion in response to nutrient intake (the 'incretin effect'). In patients with T2D, pharmacological doses/concentrations of GLP-1 can compensate for the inability of diabetic Î² cells to respond to the main incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and this is therefore a suitable parent compound for incretin-based glucose-lowering medications. Two classes of incretin-based therapies are available: GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. GLP-1RAs promote GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signalling by providing GLP-1R stimulation through 'incretin mimetics' circulating at pharmacological concentrations, whereas DPP-4 inhibitors prevent the degradation of endogenously released GLP-1. Both agents produce reductions in plasma glucose and, as a result of their glucose-dependent mode of action, this is associated with low rates of hypoglycaemia; however, there are distinct modes of action resulting in differing efficacy and tolerability profiles. Furthermore, as their actions are not restricted to stimulating insulin secretion, these agents have also been associated with additional non-glycaemic benefits such as weight loss, improvements in Î²-cell function and cardiovascular risk markers. These attributes have made incretin therapies attractive treatments for the management of T2D and have presented physicians with an opportunity to tailor treatment plans. This review endeavours to outline the commonalities and differences among incretin-based therapies and to provide guidance regarding agents most suitable for treating T2D in individual patients. Â© 2015 The Authors\n\nThe Role of Incretins in Glucose Homeostasis and Diabetes Treatment\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Wook; Egan, Josephine M.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIncretins are gut hormones that are secreted from enteroendocrine cells into the blood within minutes after eating. One of their many physiological roles is to regulate the amount of insulin that is secreted after eating. In this manner, as well as others to be described in this review, their final common raison dâÃªtre is to aid in disposal of the products of digestion. There are two incretins, known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), that share many common actions in the pancreas but have distinct actions outside of the pancreas. Both incretins are rapidly deactivated by an enzyme called dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). A lack of secretion of incretins or an increase in their clearance are not pathogenic factors in diabetes. However, in type 2 diabetes (T2DM), GIP no longer modulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion, even at supraphysiological (pharmacological) plasma levels, and therefore GIP incompetence is detrimental to Î²-cell function, especially after eating. GLP-1, on the other hand, is still insulinotropic in T2DM, and this has led to the development of compounds that activate the GLP-1 receptor with a view to improving insulin secretion. Since 2005, two new classes of drugs based on incretin action have been approved for lowering blood glucose levels in T2DM: an incretin mimetic (exenatide, which is a potent long-acting agonist of the GLP-1 receptor) and an incretin enhancer (sitagliptin, which is a DPP4 inhibitor). Exenatide is injected subcutaneously twice daily and its use leads to lower blood glucose and higher insulin levels, especially in the fed state. There is glucose-dependency to its insulin secretory capacity, making it unlikely to cause low blood sugars (hypoglycemia). DPP4 inhibitors are orally active and they increase endogenous blood levels of active incretins, thus leading to prolonged incretin action. The elevated levels of GLP-1 are thought to be the mechanism underlying their\n\nEffects of incretin agonists on endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide synthesis in human coronary artery endothelial cells exposed to TNFÎ± and glycated albumin.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarczorz, Wojciech; Francuz, Tomasz; Siemianowicz, Krzysztof; Kosowska, Agnieszka; KÅych, Agnieszka; Aghdam, Mohammad Reza F; Jagoda, Krystyna\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThere have been a number of beneficial effects of incretin agonists on the cardiovascular system. Glycated albumin (GA) and tumor necrosis factor (TNFÎ±) may lead to endothelial dysfunction. Due to reports of cardioprotective effects of incretin agonist, we wanted to determine if GLP-1 and exendin-4 can reverse diminished production of nitric oxide (NO) after treatment with TNFÎ± and GA. The objective of our experiment was to study the interaction between incretin agonists and proinflammatory substances like TNFÎ± and GA on production of NO in HCAEC. Human vascular endothelial cells from the coronary artery (HCAEC) were used. The mRNA expression and protein level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and inducible (iNOS) were quantified. NO production was measured in cells using DAF-FM/DA and flow cytometry. TNFÎ± (10 ng/mL) decreased eNOS: mRNA by 90% and protein level by 31%. TNFÎ± also decreased NO by 33%. GA (500 Î¼g/mL) neither affected eNOS expression nor the protein level, but inhibited nearly all formation of NO in endothelium. GLP-1 (100 nM) and exendin-4 (1 and 10nM) decreased the amount of NO compared to control. Incubation of HCAEC with TNFÎ± and incretin agonists did not change or moderately reduce the amount of NO compared to TNFÎ± alone. TNFÎ± and GA decrease production of NO in HCAEC, presumably by inducing reactive oxygen species or eNOS uncoupling. Incretin agonists in tested concentrations in the presence of l-arginine were not able to reverse this effect and instead led to a further reduction in NO production.

To date, the physiological importance of GIP has received much less attention than its younger sister incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1. Thus, it is worthwhile to refocus on this important and somewhat neglected incretin hormone. The potential role of GIP as a treatment option for type 2 diabetes is highlighted. Furthermore, the use of GIP as a new therapeutic option for obesity, osteoporosis and cognitive impairment is also considered. Long-acting GIP receptor agonists offer a potential new class of antidiabetic drugs. Furthermore, recent observations suggest an as yet untapped potential for GIP agonists in the treatment of osteoporosis and cognitive impairment. In addition, GIP is known to play a role in lipid metabolism and fat deposition. Accordingly, both genetic and chemical ablation of GIP signalling in mice with obesity-diabetes can protect against, or reverse, many of the obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. This review focuses on preclinical data generated to date. GIP-based therapeutics have potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity, with the possibility of further beneficial actions in osteoporosis and cognitive decline.\n\nIncretin Therapy â Present and Future\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGarber, Alan J.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAlthough newer treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients have produced continual improvements in outcome, a large and growing population with prediabetes remains under-treated. In the last few years, incretin-based therapies have become an important treatment option for patients with T2D. There are two classes of incretin agents: the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and the glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. The ultimate goal of agents within both of these classes is to increase GLP-1 signaling, which results in augmented glucose-induced insulin secretion, inhibition of glucagon secretion, and decreased appetite. This should result in improved regulation of glucose homeostasis. GLP-1 receptor agonists enable patients to achieve significant weight loss. In contrast, DPP-4 inhibitors result in a less dramatic increase in GLP-1 levels; therefore, they are weight neutral. Incretin therapies are currently recommended for use early in the treatment algorithm for T2D patients whose disease is not manageable by diet and exercise alone, but the potential for these agents may be farther reaching. Current studies are evaluating the potential benefits of combining incretin therapies with basal insulin to provide continuous glucose control before and after meals. In addition, these agents may be promising for patients with prediabetes since they effectively reduce glycosylated hemoglobin levels and fasting plasma glucose levels, enable weight control, and have the potential to preserve Î²-cell function. Clearly, all of these properties are desirable for patients with prediabetes.

There are two subtypes of PPAR receptors that have been studied in addiction: PPAR-Î± and PPAR-Î³. The role of each PPAR subtype in common models of addictive behavior, mainly pre-clinical models, is summarized. In particular, studies are reviewed that investigated the effects of PPAR-Î± agonists on relapse, sensitization, conditioned place preference, withdrawal and drug intake, and effects of PPAR-Î³ agonists on relapse, withdrawal and drug intake. Finally, studies that investigated the effects of PPAR agonists on neural pathways of addiction are reviewed. Taken together this preclinical data indicates that PPAR agonists are promising new medications for drug addiction treatment.

The incretin hormones gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) are secreted from the intestine in response to nutrient intake and exhibit several physiological functions including regulation of islet hormone secretion and glucose levels. A number of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are currently used in treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. However, GIP and GLP-1 cognate receptors are widely expressed suggesting that incretin hormones mediate effects beyond control of glucose homeostasis, and reports on associations between incretin hormones and bone metabolism have emerged. The aim of this MiniReview was to provide an overview of current knowledge regarding the inÂ vivo and inÂ vitro effects of GIP and GLP-1 on bone metabolism. We identified a total of 30 pre-clinical and clinical investigations of the effects of GIP, GLP-1 and GLP-1RAs on bone turnover markers, bone mineral density (BMD), bone microarchitecture and fracture risk. Studies conducted in cell cultures and rodents demonstrated that GIP and GLP-1 play a role in regulating skeletal homeostasis, with pre-clinical data suggesting that GIP inhibits bone resorption whereas GLP-1 may promote bone formation and enhance bone material properties. These effects are not corroborated by clinical studies. While there is evidence of effects of GIP and GLP-1 on bone metabolism in pre-clinical investigations, clinical trials are needed to clarify whether similar effects are present and clinically relevant in humans.

Herein, we report the further characterization of SMM-189 as a potent and selective CB2 inverse agonist, which acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of CP 55,940. The ability of SMM-189 to regulate microglial activation, in terms of chemokine expression and cell morphology, has been determined.

Glycemic control is important to prevent the development and progression of diabetic complications. Various classes of anti-diabetic agents are currently available, and their pleiotropic effects on diabetic complications have been investigated. Incretin-based therapies such as dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are now widely used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. A series of experimental studies showed that incretin-based therapies have beneficial effects on diabetic complications, independent of their glucose-lowering abilities, which are mediated by anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative stress properties. Based on these findings, clinical studies to assess the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1RA on diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications have been performed. Several but not all studies have provided evidence to support the beneficial effects of incretin-based therapies on diabetic complications in patients with type 2 diabetes. We herein discuss the experimental and clinical evidence of incretin-based therapy for diabetic complications.

GLP-1 mimetics are on the market as treatments for type 2 diabetes and are well tolerated. Both GLP-1 and GIP mimetics have shown neuroprotective properties in animal models of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the GLP-1 mimetic exendin-4 has shown protective effects in a clinical trial in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Novel GLP-1/GIP dual-agonist peptides have been developed and are tested in diabetic patients. Here we demonstrate the neuroprotective effects of a novel dual agonist (DA-JC1) in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. MPTP was injected once-daily (20 mg/kg i.p.) for 7 days, and the dual agonist was injected 30 min later i.p. (50 nmol/kg bw). The PI3k inhibitor LY294002 (0.6 mg/kg i.v.) was co-injected in one group. DA-JC1 reduced or reversed most of the MPTP induced motor impairments in the rotarod and in a muscle strength test. The number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) was reduced by MPTP and increased by DA-JC1. The ratio of anti-inflammatory Bcl-2 to pro-inflammatory BAX as well as the activation of the growth factor kinase Akt was reduced by MPTP and reversed by DA-JC1. The PI3k inhibitor had only limited effect on the DA-JC1 drug effect. Importantly, levels of the neuroprotective brain derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) were reduced by MPTP and enhanced by DA-JC1. The results demonstrate that DA-JC1 shows promise as a novel treatment for PD. Copyright Â© 2016.

Recently, marketed anti-diabetic drugs include incretin-based therapies (GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors) and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. In contrast to well-known detrimental effects of thiazolidinediones on bone metabolism and fracture risk, clinical data on the safety of incretin-based therapies is limited. Based on meta-analyses of trials investigating the glycemic-lowering effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP4 inhibitors, it seems that incretin-based therapies are not associated with an increase in fracture risk. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors may alter calcium and phosphate homeostasis as a result of secondary hyperparathyroidism induced by increased phosphate reabsorption. Although these changes may suggest detrimental effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on skeletal integrity, treatment-related direct effects on bone metabolism seem unlikely. Observed changes in BMD, however, seem to result from increased bone turnover in the early phase of drug-induced weight loss. Fracture risk, which is observed in older patients with impaired renal function and elevated cardiovascular disease risk treated with SGLT2 inhibitors, seems to be independent of direct effects on bone but more likely to be associated with falls and changes in hydration status secondary to osmotic diuresis.\n\nMetabolic effects of orally administered small-molecule agonists of GPR55 and GPR119 in multiple low-dose streptozotocin-induced diabetic and incretin-receptor-knockout mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcKillop, Aine M; Moran, Brian M; Abdel-Wahab, Yasser H A; Gormley, Noella M; Flatt, Peter R\n\n2016-12-01\n\nAbnormal cannabidiol (Abn-CBD) and AS-1269574 are potent selective agonists for GPR55 and GPR119, respectively. The present study evaluated the actions and ability of these small-molecule agonists to counteract experimental diabetes in mice. Diabetes was induced in NIH Swiss mice by five consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of 40Â mg/(kg body weight) streptozotocin. Diabetic mice received daily oral administration of Abn-CBD or AS-1269574 (0.1Â Î¼mol/kg) or saline vehicle (0.9% wt/vol. NaCl) over 28Â days. Body weight, food intake, fluid intake, plasma glucose, insulin, glucose tolerance, insulin release, lipid profile and pancreatic morphology were examined. Mechanism of action of agonists was assessed in acute studies using incretin-receptor-knockout mice. Abn-CBD and AS-1269574 decreased plasma glucose (20-26%, pâ<â0.05) and increased circulating insulin (47-48%, pâ<â0.05) by 10-28 days, compared with saline-treated diabetic controls. Food intake and polydipsia were reduced by both agonists (21-23%, pâ<â0.05 and 33-35%, pâ<â0.01, respectively). After 28Â days of treatment, plasma glucagon concentrations were reduced (pâ<â0.01) and glucose tolerance was enhanced by 19-44% by Abn-CBD (pâ<â0.05 or pâ<â0.001) and AS-1269574 (pâ<â0.05 to pâ<â0.001). Plasma insulin responses were improved (pâ<â0.01) and insulin resistance was decreased (pâ<â0.05 or pâ<â0.01) in both Abn-CBD- and AS-1269574-treated groups. Triacylglycerols were decreased by 19% with Abn-CBD (pâ<â0.05) and 32% with AS-1269574 (pâ<â0.01) while total cholesterol was reduced by 17% (pâ<â0.01) and 15% (pâ<â0.05), respectively. Both agonists enhanced beta cell proliferation (pâ<â0.001) although islet area was unchanged.

Incretin based therapy was found to improve B cell mass and glycaemic control in addition to having multiple beneficial effects on the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, weight loss in addition to their other beneficial effects on the liver and cardiovascular system. In prediabetes, several well-designed preventive trials have shown that lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions such as metformin, thiazolidinediones (TZD), acarbose and, nateglinide and orlistat, are effective in reducing diabetes development. In recent small studies, incretin based therapy (DPP IV inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists) have also been extended to patients with prediabetes since it was shown to better preserve B-cell function and mass in animal studies and in clinical trials and it was also shown to help maintain good long term metabolic control. Because of the limited studies and clinical experience, their side effects and costs currently guidelines do not recommend incretin-based therapies as an option for treatment in patients with prediabetes. With future clinical trials and studies they may be recommended for patients with impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance. Copyright Â© 2014 Primary Care Diabetes Europe.

In this study, we show that in addition to L-Tryptophan, GPR142 signaling is also activated by L-Phenylalanine but not by other naturally occurring amino acids. Furthermore, we show that Tryptophan and a synthetic GPR142 agonist increase insulin and incretin hormones and improve glucose disposal in mice in a GPR142-dependent manner. In contrast, Phenylalanine improves in vivo glucose disposal independently of GPR142. Noteworthy, refeeding-induced elevations in insulin and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide are blunted in Gpr142 null mice. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate GPR142 is a Tryptophan receptor critically required for insulin and incretin hormone regulation and suggest GPR142 agonists may be effective therapies that leverage amino acid sensing pathways for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Two GLP-1 receptor agonists/analogues are currently approved for the treatment of T2DMâexenatide (ByettaÂ®, Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, IN, US) and liraglutide (VictozaÂ®, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark); a once-weekly formulation of exenatide (BydureonÂ®, Eli Lilly & Co.) has also been approved by the European Medicines Agency. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has recently published guidance on the use of liraglutide in T2DM, based on evidence from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes (LEAD) Phase III trial programme, which compared liraglutide with existing glucose-lowering therapies, such as exenatide and insulin glargine. The LEAD programme reported HbA1c reductions from 0.8 to 1.5% with liraglutide (1.2 and 1.8 mg), accompanied by low rates of hypoglycaemia and some weight loss; side effects were primarily gastrointestinal in nature (e.g. nausea and diarrhoea). Based on the findings of the LEAD studies and the NICE recommendation, liraglutide now represents an important therapy widely available in the UK for certain patient groups, including those with a body mass index (BMI) â¥35.0 kg/m2, and patients with a BMI <35 kg/m2 who are considered unsuitable for insulin and are failing to meet targets for glycaemic control with oral agents. NICE guidelines still suggest that most patients without considerable obesity (BMI <35 kg/m2) are probably best managed using insulin therapy. Evidence also suggests a future role for GLP-1 mimetics in combination with basal insulin.

Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor and has been shown to exert prokinetic effects on gastrointestinal (GI) motility via the vagus and pelvic nerves. The pharmacological potential of ghrelin is hampered by its short half-life. Ghrelin receptor (GRLN-R) agonists with enhanced pharmacokinetics were thus developed. Centrally penetrant GRLN-R agonists stimulate defecation and improve impaired lower GI transit in animals and humans. This review summarizes the current knowledge on relamorelin, a potent ghrelin mimetic, and other GRLN-R analogs which are in preclinical or clinical stages of development for the management of disorders with underlying GI hypomotility, like constipation.

This effect, which is uniformly defective in patients with type 2 diabetes, is mediated by the gut-derived incretin hormones glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The importance of the incretin effect for the maintenance of glucose homoeostasis is clearly established, and incretin-based therapies are among the most promising new therapies for type 2 diabetes. However, despite the effectiveness of these therapies in many patients, the idea that they restore the incretin effect is a common misconception. In type 2 diabetes, the endocrine pancreas remains responsive to GLP-1 but is no longer responsive to GIP, which is the most likely reason for a reduced or absent incretin effect. Incretin-based drugs, including GLP-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, stimulate GLP-1 receptors and thus augment insulin secretion in response to both oral and intravenous glucose stimulation, thereby abolishing any potential difference in the responses to these stimuli. These drugs therefore do not restore the defective incretin effect in patients. By contrast, some bariatric surgical procedures enhance GLP-1 responses and also restore the incretin effect in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. Thus, not all biological actions elicited by the stimulation of GLP-1 receptors lead to quantitative changes to the incretin effect. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Among the most thoroughly studied TLR agonists are the lipid A molecules that target the TLR4 complex. One promising candidate, monophosphoryl lipid A, which is a derivative of lipid A from Salmonella minnesota, has proven to be safe and effective as a vaccine adjuvant in > 120,000 human doses. A new class of synthetic lipid A mimetics, the aminoalkyl glucosaminide 4-phosphates (AGPs), have been engineered specifically to target human TLR4 and are showing promise as vaccine adjuvants and as monotherapeutic agents capable of eliciting nonspecific protection against a wide range of infectious pathogens. In this review, the authors provide an update of the preclinical and clinical experiences with the TLR4 agonists, MPL (Corixa Corporation) adjuvant and the AGPs.\n\nPharmacokinetics in patients with chronic liver disease and hepatic safety of incretin-based therapies for the management of typeÂ 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nPubMed\n\nScheen, AndrÃ© J\n\n2014-09-01\n\nPatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have an increased risk of chronic liver disease (CLD) such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis, and about one-third of cirrhotic patients have diabetes. However, the use of several antidiabetic agents, such as metformin and sulphonylureas, may be a concern in case of hepatic impairment (HI). New glucose-lowering agents targeting the incretin system are increasingly used for the management of typeÂ 2 diabetes. Incretin-based therapies comprise oral inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) (gliptins) or injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. This narrative review summarises the available data regarding the use of both incretin-based therapies in patients with HI. In contrast to old glucose-lowering agents, they were evaluated in specifically designed acute pharmacokinetic studies in patients with various degrees of HI and their hepatic safety was carefully analysed in large clinical trials. Only mild changes in pharmacokinetic characteristics of DPP-4 inhibitors were observed in patients with different degrees of HI, presumably without major clinical relevance. GLP-1 receptor agonists have a renal excretion rather than liver metabolism. Specific pharmacokinetic data in patients with HI are only available for liraglutide. No significant changes in liver enzymes were reported with DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists, alone or in combination with various other glucose-lowering agents, in clinical trials up to 2Â years in length. On the contrary, preliminary data suggested that incretin-based therapies may be beneficial in patients with CLD, more particularly in the presence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Nevertheless, caution should be recommended, especially in patients with advanced cirrhosis, because of a lack of clinical experience with incretin-based therapies in these vulnerable patients.\n\nIncretin-based therapies in prediabetes: Current evidence and future perspectives\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPapaetis, Georgios S\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is evolving globally at an alarming rate. Prediabetes is an intermediate state of glucose metabolism that exists between normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and the clinical entity of T2D. Relentless Î²-cell decline and failure is responsible for the progression from NGT to prediabetes and eventually T2D. The huge burden resulting from the complications of T2D created the need of therapeutic strategies in an effort to prevent or delay its development. The beneficial effects of incretin-based therapies, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, on Î²-cell function in patients with T2D, together with their strictly glucose-depended mechanism of action, suggested their possible use in individuals with prediabetes when greater Î²-cell mass and function are preserved and the possibility of Î²-cell salvage is higher. The present paper summarizes the main molecular intracellular mechanisms through which GLP-1 exerts its activity on Î²-cells. It also explores the current evidence of incretin based therapies when administered in a prediabetic state, both in animal models and in humans. Finally it discusses the safety of incretin-based therapies as well as their possible role in order to delay or prevent T2D.

However, the effects of this class of compounds on neuro-cardiovascular system damage induced by high fat diet remain unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of incretin-based therapies on neuro-cardiovascular dysfunction induced by high fat diet in Wistar rats. We have evaluated fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance, heart rate variability quantified on time and frequency domains, cerebral microcirculation by intravital microscopy, mean arterial blood pressure, ventricular function and mitochondrial swelling. High fat diet worsened biometric and metabolic parameters and promoted deleterious effects on autonomic, myocardial and haemodynamic parameters, decreased capillary diameters and increased functional capillary density in the brain. Biometric and metabolic parameters were better improved by glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) compared with dipeptdyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. On the other hand, both GLP-1 agonist and DPP-4 inhibitor reversed the deleterious effects of high fat diet on autonomic, myocardial, haemodynamic and cerebral microvascular parameters. GLP-1 agonist and DPP-4 inhibitor therapy also increased mitochondrial permeability transition pore resistance in brain and heart tissues of rats subjected to high fat diet. Incretin-based therapies improve deleterious cardiovascular effects induced by high fat diet and may have important contributions on the interplay between neuro-cardiovascular dynamic controls through mitochondrial dysfunction associated to metabolic disorders.\n\nThe role of GLP-1 mimetics and basal insulin analogues in type 2 diabetes mellitus: guidance from studies of liraglutide.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarnett, A H\n\n2012-04-01\n\nIn people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the incretin effect is reduced, but the recent advent of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 agonists/analogues has enabled restoration of at least some of the function of the incretin system, with accompanying improvements in glycaemic control.

The objective of this review was to describe the controlled preclinical and clinical trial data regarding the incidence of pancreatitis with sitagliptin, the first DPP-4 inhibitor approved for use in patients with T2DM. Tissue samples from multiple animal species treated with sitagliptin for up to 2 years at plasma exposures substantially in excess of human exposure were evaluated to determine whether any potential gross or histomorphological changes suggestive of pancreatitis occurred. Sections were prepared by routine methods, stained with haematoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically. A pooled analysis of 19 controlled clinical trials, comprising 10,246 patients with T2DM treated for up to 2 years, was performed using patient-level data from each study for the evaluation of clinical and laboratory adverse events. Adverse events were encoded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 12.0 system. Incidences of adverse events were adjusted for patient exposure. Tissue samples from preclinical studies in multiple animal species did not reveal any evidence of treatment-related pancreatitis. The pooled analysis of controlled clinical trials revealed similar incidence rates of pancreatitis in patients treated with sitagliptin compared with those not treated with sitagliptin (0.08 events per 100 patient-years vs. 0.10 events per 100 patient-years, respectively). Preclinical and clinical trial data with sitagliptin to date do not indicate an increased risk of pancreatitis in patients with T2DM treated with sitagliptin.

Cumulatively, these oral agents address the influx of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract, impaired insulin activity, and acute beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes; however, until recently, there were no means to deal with the inappropriate hyperglucagonemia or chronic beta-cell-decline characteristic of the disease. The recently introduced incretin-based therapies serve to address some of the challenges associated with traditionally available oral antidiabetic agents. In addition to improving beta-cell function, stimulating insulin secretion, and inhibiting glucagon secretion, these agents reduce appetite, thereby stabilizing weight and/or promoting weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes. Of the incretin-based therapies, both the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists stimulate insulin secretion and inhibit glucagon secretion. The subsequent review outlines evidence from selected clinical trials of the currently available GLP-1 receptor agonists, exenatide and liraglutide, and DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin and saxagliptin. Earlier and more frequent use of these incretin-based therapies is recommended in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, based on their overall safety and ability to achieve the glycosylated hemoglobin level goal. As such, both the American Diabetes Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology (AACE/ACE) treatment algorithms recommend the use of incretin-based therapy in both treatment-naive and previously treated patients. The AACE/ACE guidelines clearly state that these agents should not be limited to third- or fourth-line therapy.\n\nChoosing between GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and DPP-4 Inhibitors: A Pharmacological Perspective\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrown, Dominique Xavier; Evans, Marc\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn recent years the incretin therapies have provided a new treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The incretin therapies focus on the increasing levels of the two incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). This results in increased glucose dependent insulin synthesis and release. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as liraglutide and exenatide exert an intrinsic biological effect on GLP-1 receptors directly stimulating the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin and linagliptin prevent the inactivation of endogenous GLP-1 and GIP through competitive inhibition of the DPP-4 enzyme. Both incretin therapies have good safety and tolerability profiles and interact minimally with a number of medications commonly prescribed in T2DM. This paper focuses on the pharmacological basis by which the incretin therapies function and how this knowledge can inform and benefit clinical decisions. Each individual incretin agent has benefits and pitfalls relating to aspects such as glycaemic and nonglycaemic efficacy, safety and tolerability, ease of administration, and cost. Overall, a personalized medicine approach has been found to be favourable, tailoring the incretin agent to benefit and suit patient's needs such as renal impairment (RI) or hepatic impairment (HI).

The clinical benefits of good glycemic control have been well established. Most patients eventually require the use of multiple hyperglycemic drugs in combination to approach or achieve the American Diabetes Association's recommended target A1C value of 7%. The role of incretin-based therapies for both glycemic control and beta-cell protection has become an area of intense interest and development. Although current practice guidelines do not include specific recommendations about when and how to incorporate incretin-based agents, a consensus statement published by the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes suggests the addition of a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist for patients not at goal A1C with metformin and lifestyle changes. The goal of this article is to review this class of agents, discuss their role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and address the practical aspects of integrating incretin-based agents into the management of patients with diabetes. Currently, 3 incretin-based therapies are available and widely used in clinical practice. Several more agents are either under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or are in the very late stages of development. For diabetes educators trying to help their patients understand the differences among their antidiabetic medications, a comprehensive understanding of these agents and their role in therapy is imperative.\n\nGPR40 partial agonists and AgoPAMs: Differentiating effects on glucose and hormonal secretions in the rodent\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPachanski, Michele J.; Kirkland, Melissa E.; Kosinski, Daniel T.; Mane, Joel; Cheewatrakoolpong, Boonlert; Xue, Jiyan; Szeto, Daphne; Forrest, Gail; Miller, Corin; Bunzel, Michelle; Plummer, Christopher W.; Chobanian, Harry R.; Miller, Michael W.; Souza, Sarah; Thomas-Fowlkes, Brande S.; Ogawa, Aimie M.; Weinglass, Adam B.; Di Salvo, Jerry; Li, Xiaoyan; Feng, Yue; Tatosian, Daniel A.; Howard, Andrew D.; Colletti, Steven L.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nGPR40 agonists are effective antidiabetic agents believed to lower glucose through direct effects on the beta cell to increase glucose stimulated insulin secretion. However, not all GPR40 agonists are the same. Partial agonists lower glucose through direct effects on the pancreas, whereas GPR40 AgoPAMs may incorporate additional therapeutic effects through increases in insulinotrophic incretins secreted by the gut. Here we describe how GPR40 AgoPAMs stimulate both insulin and incretin secretion in vivo over time in diabetic GK rats. We also describe effects of AgoPAMs in vivo to lower glucose and body weight beyond what is seen with partial GPR40 agonists in both the acute and chronic setting. Further comparisons of the glucose lowering profile of AgoPAMs suggest these compounds may possess greater glucose control even in the presence of elevated glucagon secretion, an unexpected feature observed with both acute and chronic treatment with AgoPAMs. Together these studies highlight the complexity of GPR40 pharmacology and the potential additional benefits AgoPAMs may possess above partial agonists for the diabetic patient.

A population-based cohort study was conducted using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD 2007-2012). A total of 182 428 adult patients with â¥1 non-insulin antidiabetic drug (NIAD) prescription were matched to control subjects without diabetes. Cox regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of pancreatitis in incretin-users (N = 28 370) compared with controls and with other NIAD users. Adjustments were made for lifestyle, disease and drug history. In a sensitivity analysis, a new-user design was used. Current incretin users had a 1.5-fold increased risk of any pancreatitis compared with NIAD users (adjusted HR 1.47, 95% CI 1.06-2.04). In incident current incretin users the risk of any and acute pancreatitis was increased 2.1- and 2.0-fold compared with NIAD users (adjusted HR 2.12, 95% CI 1.31-3.43 and adjusted HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.13-3.41), whereas there was no increased risk found for chronic pancreatitis. Incretin use was associated with an increased risk of any pancreatitis. Moreover, risk of any and acute pancreatitis was higher when applying a new-user design. We were not able to detect an association with chronic pancreatitis, but the number in this subgroup was small.

However, the effects of liraglutide on pulmonary hypertension (PH) and pulmonary endothelin (ET) system are unknown. Eight-week-old C57BL6/J mice were injected liraglutide or vehicle for 5 weeks. One week after injection, the mice were exposed to either room air (normoxia) or chronic hypoxia (10 % O(2)) for 4 weeks. The right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) was significantly higher in hypoxia + vehicle group than in normoxia + vehicle group. ET-1 mRNA expression in the lungs was comparable among all the groups. ET(B) mRNA and protein expression in the lungs was significantly lower in hypoxia + vehicle group than in normoxia + vehicle group. The above changes were normalized by liraglutide treatment. The expression of phospho-eNOS and phospho-AMPK proteins in the lungs was significantly higher in hypoxia + liraglutide group than in normoxia + vehicle group. We demonstrated for the first time that liraglutide effectively improved RVSP and RV hypertrophy in hypoxia-induced PH mice by activating eNOS through normalization of impaired ET(B) pathway and augmentation of AMPK pathway. Therefore, GLP-1R agonists can be promising therapeutic agents for PH.\n\nIncretin-based therapy in combination with basal insulin: a promising tactic for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nVora, J; Bain, S C; Damci, T; Dzida, G; Hollander, P; Meneghini, L F; Ross, S A\n\n2013-02-01\n\nIncretin therapies such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4Is) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have become well-established treatments for type 2 diabetes. Both drug classes reduce blood glucose through physiological pathways mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, resulting in glucose-dependent enhancement of residual insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion. In addition, the GLP-1RAs reduce gastrointestinal motility and appear to have appetite-suppressing actions and, so, are often able to produce clinically useful weight loss. The glucose-dependency of their glucagon-inhibiting and insulin-enhancing effects, together with their weight-sparing properties, make the incretin therapies a logical proposition for use in combination with exogenous basal insulin therapy. This combination offers the prospect of an additive or synergistic glucose-lowering effect without a greatly elevated risk of hypoglycaemia compared with insulin monotherapy, and any insulin-associated weight gain might also be mitigated. Furthermore, the incretin therapies can be combined with metformin, which is usually continued when basal insulin is introduced in type 2 diabetes. Although the combination of incretin and insulin therapy is currently not addressed in internationally recognized treatment guidelines, several clinical studies have assessed its use. The data, summarized in this review, are encouraging and show that glycaemic control is improved and weight gain is limited or reversed (especially with the combined use of GLP-1RAs and basal insulin), and that the use of an incretin therapy can also greatly reduce insulin dose requirements. The addition of basal insulin to established incretin therapy is straightforward, but insulin dose adjustment (though not discontinuation) is usually necessary if the sequence is reversed.

In clinical practice and in previously performed clinical trials, these agents are often used in combination with other oral anti-diabetic agents (OADs) and Insulin. Prior meta-analytic reviews however do not adequately address the impact of background therapy and active comparator arms. Accordingly, we aimed to further investigate the efficacy of incretin based therapies by updating existing reviews by including clinical trial evidence after 2008; estimating the pooled effect of incretin therapies on glycemic efficacy and weight-loss, stratified by comparator therapy (placebo, mono-therapy, etc.), estimating the impact of background OADs and within class (GLP-1Ra or DPP-4i) comparative efficacy, on glycemia control. 82 randomized controlled trials after 2008 with glycemic control and weight loss as primary end-points were included. Both DPP-4i and GLP-1Ra reduced HbA1c, but only GLP-1Ra caused weight loss when compared to either active comparator drugs or placebo. GLP-1Ra were more effective than DPP-4i in glycemia lowering. Long acting GLP-1Ra were more effective in HbA1c lowering than short-acting agents but with similar weight loss effect. The effect of DPP-4i incretin glycemic efficacy was not modified by background therapy used in the study. Copyright Â© 2016.

The NOP receptor remained an orphan receptor until 1995, when the endogenous neuropeptide agonist, known as nociceptin or orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) was isolated. Five years later, a group at Hoffmann-La Roche reported on the selective, nonpeptide NOP agonist Ro 64-6198, which became the most extensively published nonpeptide NOP agonist and a valuable pharmacological tool in determining the potential of the NOP receptor as a therapeutic target. Ro 64-6198 is systemically active and achieves high brain penetration. It has subnanomolar affinity for the NOP receptor and is at least 100 times more selective for the NOP receptor over the classic opioid receptors. Ro 64-6198 ranges from partial to full agonist, depending on the assay. Preclinical data indicate that Ro 64-6198 may have broad clinical uses, such as in treating stress and anxiety, addiction, neuropathic pain, cough, and anorexia. This review summarizes the pharmacology and preclinical data of Ro 64-6198.\n\nAMPK and PPARÎ´ agonists are exercise mimetics\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNarkar, Vihang A.; Downes, Michael; Yu, Ruth T.; Embler, Emi; Wang, Yong-Xu; Banayo, Ester; Mihaylova, Maria M.; Nelson, Michael C.; Zou, Yuhua; Juguilon, Henry; Kang, Heonjoong; Shaw, Reuben; Evans, Ronald M.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nSUMMARY The benefits of endurance exercise on general health make it desirable to identify orally active agents that would mimic or potentiate the effects of exercise to treat metabolic diseases. Although certain natural compounds, such as reseveratrol, have endurance-enhancing activities, their exact metabolic targets remain elusive. We therefore tested the effect of pathway-specific drugs on endurance capacities of mice in a treadmill running test. We found that PPARÎ²/Î´ agonist and exercise training synergistically increase oxidative myofibers and running endurance in adult mice. Because training activates AMPK and PGC1Î±, we then tested whether the orally active AMPK agonist AICAR might be sufficient to overcome the exercise requirement. Unexpectedly, even in sedentary mice, 4 weeks of AICAR treatment alone induced metabolic genes and enhanced running endurance by 44%. These results demonstrate that AMPK-PPARÎ´ pathway can be targeted by orally active drugs to enhance training adaptation or even to increase endurance without exercise.

The lack of hypoglycemia as a side effect when GLP-1 receptor agonists are used along with the tendency of these therapeutic agents to prevent or even reduce weight gain makes them valuable targets in therapy development. However, native GLP-1 and many of its early analogues have very short half-lives, requiring repeated treatment to maintain therapeutic levels. As all current treatments are injected subcutaneously, a large focus has been made on trying to extend the half-lives of GLP-1 analogues while retaining bioactivity. Most success in this regard has been achieved with the use of peptide-protein fusions, which are not as well suited for oral administration. However, recent work focused on the development of non-fusion peptides with increased half-lives that may be more appropriate for oral administration. This minireview discusses the structural characteristics of past and present analogues as well as the recent work conducted toward developing novel GLP-1 receptor agonists.

ABT-526 and ABT-510, two peptide mimetics of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), block angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo and slow tumor growth in mice. To guide the clinical development of these drugs, translational studies in dogs with naturally occurring cancers were initiated. A prospective open-label trial using ABT-510 or ABT-526 in pet dogs with measurable malignant spontaneously arising tumors. Endpoints included safety, pharmacokinetics, antitumor activity, and preliminary assessment of changes in circulating endothelial cell populations. Two-hundred and forty-two dogs were sequentially entered to this open-label trial. The elimination half-life for ABT-510 and ABT-526 was 0.7 and 0.8 h, respectively (range, 0.5-1 h). No dose-limiting toxicities were seen in any dogs (N = 242). Forty-two dogs receiving peptide had objective responses (>50% reduction in tumor size; n = 6) or significant disease stabilization. Most objective responses were seen after 60 days of exposure to the TSP-1 peptide. Antitumor activity was similar for both peptides and was seen in several histologies, including mammary carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, soft tissue sarcoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Assessment of circulating endothelial cell populations in a small subset of dogs suggested that effective exposure to TSP-1 peptides may be associated with reductions in circulating endothelial cells. These results support the safety and activity of ABT-526 and ABT-510 in dogs with naturally occurring malignant cancers. Data from this preclinical trial support the development of TSP-1 mimetic peptides as anticancer agents.\n\nComparing olive oil and C4-dietary oil, a prodrug for the GPR119 agonist, 2-oleoyl glycerol, less energy intake of the latter is needed to stimulate incretin hormone secretion in overweight subjects with type 2 diabetes.\n\nPubMed\n\nMandÃ¸e, Mette Johannsen; Hansen, Katrine Bagge; WindelÃ¸v, Johanne Agerlin; Knop, Filip Krag; Rehfeld, Jens Frederik; Rosenkilde, Mette Marie; Holst, Jens Juul; Hansen, Harald Severin\n\n2018-01-12\n\nAfter digestion, dietary triacylglycerol stimulates incretin release in humans, mainly through generation of 2-monoacylglycerol, an agonist for the intestinal G protein-coupled receptor 119 (GPR119). Enhanced incretin release may have beneficial metabolic effects. However, dietary fat may promote weight gain and should therefore be restricted in obesity. We designed C4-dietary oil (1,3-di-butyryl-2-oleoyl glycerol) as a 2-oleoyl glycerol (2-OG)-generating fat type, which would stimulate incretin release to the same extent while providing less calories than equimolar amounts of common triglycerides, e.g., olive oil. We studied the effect over 180âmin of (a) 19âg olive oil plus 200âg carrot, (b) 10.7âg C4 dietary oil plus 200âg carrot and (c) 200âg carrot, respectively, on plasma responses of gut and pancreatic hormones in 13 overweight patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Theoretically, both oil meals result in formation of 7.7âg 2-OG during digestion. Both olive oil and C4-dietary oil resulted in greater postprandial (Pââ¤â0.01) glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) responses (incremental area under curve (iAUC)): iAUC GLP-1 : 645âÂ±â194 and 702âÂ±â97âpMâÃâmin; iAUC GIP : 4,338âÂ±â764 and 2,894âÂ±â601âpMâÃâmin) compared to the carrot meal (iAUC GLP-1 : 7âÂ±â103âpMâÃâmin; iAUC GIP : 266âÂ±â234âpMâÃâmin). iAUC for GLP-1 and GIP were similar for C4-dietary oil and olive oil, although olive oil resulted in a higher peak value for GIP than C4-dietary oil. C4-dietary oil enhanced secretion of GLP-1 and GIP to almost the same extent as olive oil, in spite of liberation of both 2-OG and oleic acid, which also may stimulate incretin secretion, from olive oil. Thus, C4-dietary oil is more effective as incretin releaser than olive oil per unit of energy and may be useful for dietary intervention.\n\nStructure and biological activity of endogenous and synthetic agonists of GPR119\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTyurenkov, I. N.; Ozerov, A. A.; Kurkin, D. V.; Logvinova, E. O.; Bakulin, D. A.; Volotova, E. V.; Borodin, D. D.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nA G-protein-coupled receptor, GPR119, is a promising pharmacological target for a new class of hypoglycaemic drugs with an original mechanism of action, namely, increase in the glucose-dependent incretin and insulin secretion. In 2005, the first ligands were found and in the subsequent years, a large number of GPR119 agonists were synthesized in laboratories in various countries; the safest and most promising agonists have entered phase I and II clinical trials as agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. The review describes the major endogenous GPR119 agonists and the main trends in the design and modification of synthetic structures for increasing the hypoglycaemic activity. The data on synthetic agonists are arranged according to the type of the central core of the molecules.

Insulin desensitisation has been observed in the brains of patients, which may promote neurodegeneration. Incretins are a family of growth factors that can re-sensitise insulin signalling. We have previously shown that mimetics of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) have neuroprotective effects in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropypridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. Recently, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists have been developed. We therefore tested the novel dual agonist DA3-CH in comparison with the best GLP-1 analogue currently on the market, liraglutide (both drugs 25nmol/kg ip once-daily for 7 days) in the MPTP mouse model of PD (25mg/kg ip once-daily for 7 days). In the Rotarod and grip strength assessment, DA3-CH was superior to liraglutide in reversing the MPTP-induced motor impairment. Dopamine synthesis as indicated by levels of tyrosine hydroxylase was much reduced by MPTP in the substantia nigra and striatum, and DA3-CH reversed this while liragutide only partially reversed this. The chronic inflammation response as shown in increased levels of activated microglia and astrocytes was reduced by both drugs. Importantly, expression levels of the neuroprotective growth factor Glial Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF) was much enhanced by both DA3-CH and liragutide. The results demonstrate that the combination of GLP-1 and GIP receptor activation is superior to single GLP-1 receptor activation alone. Therefore, new dual agonists may be a promising treatment for PD. The GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 has already shown disease modifying effects in clinical trials in PD patients.

In patients with advanced solid malignancies, CD40 agonists have demonstrated some anti-tumor activity and a manageable toxicity profile. A 2nd generation of CD40 agonists has now been designed with optimized Fc receptor (FcR) binding based on preclinical evidence suggesting a critical role for FcR engagement in defining the potency of CD40 agonists in vivo. AREAS COVERED We provide a comprehensive review using PubMed and Google Patent databases on the current clinical status of CD40 agonists, strategies for applying CD40 agonists in cancer therapy, and the preclinical data that supports and is guiding the future development of CD40 agonists. EXPERT COMMENTARY There is a wealth of preclinical data that provide rationale on several distinct approaches for using CD40 agonists in cancer immunotherapy. This data illustrates the need to strategically combine CD40 agonists with other clinically active treatment regimens in order to realize the full potential of activating CD40 in vivo. Thus, critical to the success of this class of immune-oncology drugs, which have the potential to restore both innate and adaptive immunosurveillance, will be the identification of biomarkers for monitoring and predicting responses as well as informing mechanisms of treatment resistance.

Oligosaccharide mimetics discussed in this chapter may possess a linker of two or more atoms such as amide or urea groups that may lead to isosteric linkage replacements but mostly do not. Larger groups that replace a full sugar unit we refer to as spacers and have grouped molecules with flexible acyclic spacers and more rigid cyclic spacers . The employment of pharmacophore models has led to oligosaccharide mimetics with only one sugar unit or finally without any saccharide unit as exemplified in mimotopes.\n\nThe CTRB1/2 Locus Affects Diabetes Susceptibility and Treatment via the Incretin Pathway\n\nPubMed Central\n\nât Hart, Leen M.; Fritsche, Andreas; Nijpels, Giel; van Leeuwen, Nienke; Donnelly, Louise A.; Dekker, Jacqueline M.; Alssema, Marjan; Fadista, Joao; Carlotti, FranÃ§oise; Gjesing, Anette P.; Palmer, Colin N.A.; van Haeften, Timon W.; Herzberg-SchÃ¤fer, Silke A.; Simonis-Bik, Annemarie M.C.; Houwing-Duistermaat, Jeanine J.; Helmer, Quinta; Deelen, Joris; Guigas, Bruno; Hansen, Torben; Machicao, Fausto; Willemsen, Gonneke; Heine, Robert J.; Kramer, Mark H.H.; Holst, Jens J.; de Koning, Eelco J.P.; HÃ¤ring, Hans-Ulrich; Pedersen, Oluf; Groop, Leif; de Geus, Eco J.C.; Slagboom, P. Eline; Boomsma, Dorret I.; Eekhoff, Elisabeth M.W.; Pearson, Ewan R.; Diamant, Michaela\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) promotes glucose homeostasis and enhances Î²-cell function. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, which inhibit the physiological inactivation of endogenous GLP-1, are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Using the Metabochip, we identified three novel genetic loci with large effects (30â40%) on GLP-1âstimulated insulin secretion during hyperglycemic clamps in nondiabetic Caucasian individuals (TMEM114; CHST3 and CTRB1/2; n = 232; all P â¤ 8.8 Ã 10â7). rs7202877 near CTRB1/2, a known diabetes risk locus, also associated with an absolute 0.51 Â± 0.16% (5.6 Â± 1.7 mmol/mol) lower A1C response to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment in G-allele carriers, but there was no effect on GLP-1 RA treatment in type 2 diabetic patients (n = 527). Furthermore, in pancreatic tissue, we show that rs7202877 acts as expression quantitative trait locus for CTRB1 and CTRB2, encoding chymotrypsinogen, and increases fecal chymotrypsin activity in healthy carriers. Chymotrypsin is one of the most abundant digestive enzymes in the gut where it cleaves food proteins into smaller peptide fragments. Our data identify chymotrypsin in the regulation of the incretin pathway, development of diabetes, and response to DPP-4 inhibitor treatment.

In this study, we investigated an effective anti-diabetic therapy via exendin-4 expressing chimeric plasmid based on two-step transcription amplification (TSTA) system with dendrimer-type bioreducible polymer for more improved incretin-based gene therapy. Arginine-grafted poly (cystaminebisacrylamide-diaminohexane) (ABP)-conjugated poly (amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimer (PAM-ABP) was used as gene carrier. PAM-ABP/chimeric DNA polyplex was markedly elevated exendin-4 expression in ectopic cells as well as increased insulin production through an enhanced activation of protein kinase K (PKA) induced by up-regulation of exendin-4-stimulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in pancreatic Î²-cell. Consistent with these results, intravenous administration of PAM-ABP/chimeric DNA polyplex improved glucoregulotory effects, as well as increased insulin secretion by high expression of exendin-4 in blood in type 2 diabetic mice with no any toxicity. Our exendin-4 system can be attributed to provide a potential diabetes therapeutic agent for improved incretin gene therapy.

Approximately 90% of all diabetic patients suffer from Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The world's economy coughs out billions of dollars annually to diagnose, treat and manage patients with diabetes. It has been shown that the naturally occurring gut hormones incretins, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) can preserve the morphology and function of pancreatic beta cell. In addition, GIP and GLP-1 act on insulin receptors to facilitate insulin-receptor binding, resulting in optimal glucose metabolism. This review examines the medicinal chemistry and roles of incretins, specifically, GLP-1 and drugs which can mimic its actions and prevent its enzymatic degradation. The review discussed GLP-1 agonists such as exenatide, liraglutide, taspoglutide and albiglutide. The paper also identified and reviewed a number of inhibitors, which can block dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4), the enzyme responsible for the rapid degradation of GLP-1. These DPP-4 inhibitors include sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin and many others which are still in the experimental phase.

These data provided a basis for studying the effect of Noopept on major indexes of the incretin system. Streptozotocin was shown to decrease the concentrations of incretin GLP-1 and insulin in the blood. Noopept had a normalizing effect on these parameters. This influence of Noopept was not related to the inhibition of a major enzyme metabolizing incretins (dipeptidyl peptidase IV). A reference drug sitagliptin also increased the contents of incretins and insulin, which was associated with the inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV. It is known that GLP-1 increases NGF expression in the insular system. Our results suggest that the increase in incretin activity contributes to the antiapoptotic effect of Noopept on pancreatic Î² cells. The mechanism for an increase in blood GLP-1 level after oral application of Noopept requires further investigations.\n\nPositioning SGLT2 Inhibitors/Incretin-Based Therapies in the Treatment Algorithm.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilding, John P H; Rajeev, Surya Panicker; DeFronzo, Ralph A\n\n2016-08-01\n\nSodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are the most recent addition to the therapeutic options available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and became available after the introduction of incretin-based therapies, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). These agents have potential advantages with regard to their weight loss-promoting effect, low risk of hypoglycemia, reduction in blood pressure, and reduction in cardiovascular events in high-risk patients (with empagliflozin). Apart from these clinically important outcomes, they may also correct core defects present in type 2 diabetes (i.e., improvement in Î²-cell function and insulin sensitivity). They do, however, have some adverse effects, notably, nausea with GLP-1 RAs and genital tract infections and potential for volume depletion with SGLT2i. Whether incretin-based therapies are associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis is unclear. Most recently, diabetic ketoacidosis has been reported with SGLT2i. Therefore, a key clinical question in relation to guidelines is whether these clinical advantages, in the context of the adverse effect profile, outweigh the additional cost compared with older, more established therapies. This article reviews the therapeutic rationale for the use of these newer drugs for diabetes treatment, considers their place in current guidelines, and discusses how this may change as new data emerge about their long-term efficacy and safety from ongoing outcome trials.

Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists were well recognized to attenuate renal injury independent of glucose control in diabetic nephropathy. There are limited studies focusing on their effects on ORG. We explored the effects of incretin-based therapies on early ORG and the inflammatory responses involved mainly concentrated on mast cell (MC) and macrophage (M) infiltration and local pro-inflammatory factors. ORG rat models were induced by high-fat diet and then divided into ORG vehicle, vildagliptin (3âmg/kg/day, qd) and liraglutide (200âÎ¼g/kg, bid) treated groups. After 8 weeks of treatments, albuminuria, glomerular histology, renal inflammatory cell infiltration, and pro-inflammatory factors were analyzed. Early ORG model was demonstrated by albuminuria, glomerulomegaly, foot process fusion, and mesangial and endothelial mild proliferation. Incretin-based therapies limited body weight gain and improved insulin sensitivity. ORG was alleviated, manifested by decreased average glomerular area, attenuated mesangial and endothelial cell proliferation, and revived cell-to-cell propagation of podocytes, which contributed to reduced albuminuria. Compared with ORG vehicle, MC and M1 macrophage (pro-inflammatory) infiltration and M1/M2 ratio were significantly decreased; M2 macrophage (anti-inflammatory) was not significantly increased after incretin-based treatments. Tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and IL-6 in renal cortex were significantly downregulated, while transforming growth factor-Î²1 (TGF-Î²1) remained unchanged. Incretin-based treatments could alleviate high-fat diet-induced ORG partly through the systemic insulin sensitivity improvement and the attenuated local inflammation, mainly by the decrease of MC and M1 macrophage infiltration and reduction of TNF-Î± and IL-6.\n\nSelf-Assembly of a Modular Polypeptide Based on Blocks of Silk-Mimetic and Elastin-Mimetic Sequences\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n2002-04-01\n\nSilk -Mimetic and Elastin-Mimetic Sequences DISTRIBUTION: Approved for public release, distribution unlimited This paper is part of the following...724 Â© 2002 Materials Research Society N3.8 Self-Assembly of a Modular Polypeptide based on Blocks of Silk -Mimetic and Elastin- Mimetic Sequences...Chrystelle S.

More recently, this family of pattern recognition receptors has been attributed a critical role in the elicitation of anticancer immune responses, raising interest in the development of immunochemotherapeutic regimens based on natural or synthetic TLR agonists. In spite of such an intense wave of preclinical and clinical investigation, only three TLR agonists are currently licensed by FDA for use in cancer patients: bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG), an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that operates as a mixed TLR2/TLR4 agonist; monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), a derivative of Salmonella minnesota that functions as a potent agonist of TLR4; and imiquimod, a synthetic imidazoquinoline that activates TLR7. One year ago, in the August and September issues of OncoImmunology , we described the main biological features of TLRs and discussed the progress of clinical studies evaluating the safety and therapeutic potential of TLR agonists in cancer patients. Here, we summarize the latest developments in this exciting area of research, focusing on preclinical studies that have been published during the last 13 mo and clinical trials launched in the same period to investigate the antineoplastic activity of TLR agonists.\n\nThe role of the Wnt signaling pathway in incretin hormone production and function\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChiang, Yu-ting A.; Ip, Wilfred; Jin, Tianru\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGlucose metabolism is tightly controlled by multiple hormones and neurotransmitters in response to nutritional, environmental, and emotional changes. In addition to insulin and glucagon produced by pancreatic islets, two incretin hormones, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP, also known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide), also play important roles in blood glucose homeostasis. The incretin hormones mainly exert their regulatory effects via their corresponding receptors, which are expressed in pancreatic islets as well as many other extra-pancreatic organs. Recent studies have shown that the genes which encode these two incretin hormones can be regulated by the effectors of the Wnt signaling pathway, including TCF7L2, a transcription factor identified recently by extensive genome wide association studies as an important type 2 diabetes risk gene. Interestingly, TCF7L2 and Î²-catenin (Î²-cat), another effector of Wnt signaling pathway, may also mediate the function of the incretin hormones as well as the expression of their receptors in pancreatic Î²-cells. In this review, we have introduced the incretin hormones and the Wnt signaling pathway, summarized recent findings in the field, and provided our perspectives.

This article is the first comprehensive review of the 50-year long history of the mimetic methodology and describes in a systematic way the major mimetic ideas and their relevance to academic and real-life problems. The supporting applications include diffusion, electromagnetics, fluid flow, and Lagrangian hydrodynamics problems. The article provides enough details to build various discrete operators on unstructured polygonal and polyhedral meshes and summarizes the major convergence results for the mimetic approximations. Most of these theoretical results, which are presented here as lemmas, propositions and theorems, are either original or an extension of existing results to a more general formulation using polyhedral meshes. Finally, flexibility and extensibility of the mimetic methodology are shown by deriving higher-order approximations, enforcing discrete maximum principles for diffusion problems, and ensuring the numerical stability for saddle-point systems.\n\nConverting One-Face Î±-Helix Mimetics into Amphiphilic Î±-Helix Mimetics as Potent Inhibitors of Protein-Protein Interactions.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Ji Hoon; Oh, Misook; Kim, Hyun Soo; Lee, Huisun; Im, Wonpil; Lim, Hyun-Suk\n\n2016-01-11\n\nMany biologically active Î±-helical peptides adopt amphiphilic helical structures that contain hydrophobic residues on one side and hydrophilic residues on the other side. Therefore, Î±-helix mimetics capable of mimicking such amphiphilic helical peptides should possess higher binding affinity and specificity to target proteins. Here we describe an efficient method for generating amphiphilic Î±-helix mimetics. One-face Î±-helix mimetics having hydrophobic side chains on one side was readily converted into amphiphilic Î±-helix mimetics by introducing appropriate charged residues on the opposite side. We also demonstrate that such two-face amphiphilic Î±-helix mimetics indeed show remarkably improved binding affinity to a target protein, compared to one-face hydrophobic Î±-helix mimetics. We believe that generating a large combinatorial library of these amphiphilic Î±-helix mimetics can be valuable for rapid discovery of highly potent and specific modulators of protein-protein interactions.\n\nKappa Opioid Receptor Agonist and Brain Ischemia\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChunhua, Chen; Chunhua, Xi; Megumi, Sugita; Renyu, Liu\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOpioid receptors, especially Kappa opioid receptor (KOR) play an important role in the pathophysiological process of cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury. Previously accepted KOR agonists activity has included anti-nociception, cardiovascular, anti-pruritic, diuretic, and antitussive effects, while compelling evidence from various ischemic animal models indicate that KOR agonist have neuroprotective effects through various mechanisms. In this review, we aimed to demonstrate the property of KOR agonist and its role in global and focal cerebral ischemia. Based on current preclinical research, the KOR agonists may be useful as a neuroprotective agent. The recent discovery of salvinorin A, highly selective non-opioid KOR agonist, offers a new tool to study the role of KOR in brain HI injury and the protective effects of KOR agonist. The unique pharmacological profile of salvinorin A along with the long history of human usage provides its high candidacy as a potential alternative medication for brain HI injury.

This loss appears due to the synaptic accumulation of toxic AÎ² oligomers (ADDLs), which damages synapse structure and function. Although it has been reported that oligomer binding and toxicity can be prevented by stimulation of neuronal insulin signaling with PPARÎ³ agonists, these agonists have problematic side effects. We therefore investigated the therapeutic potential of chiro-inositols, insulin-sensitizing compounds safe for human consumption. Chiro-inositols have been studied extensively for treatment of diseases associated with peripheral insulin resistance, but their insulin mimetic function in memory-relevant central nervous system (CNS) cells is unknown. Here we demonstrate that mature cultures of hippocampal neurons respond to d-chiro-inositol (DCI), pinitol (3-O-methyl DCI), and the inositol glycan INS-2 (pinitol Î²-1-4 galactosamine) with increased phosphorylation in key upstream components in the insulin-signaling pathway (insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate-1, and Akt). Consistent with insulin stimulation, DCI treatment promotes rapid withdrawal of dendritic insulin receptors. With respect to neuroprotection, DCI greatly enhances the ability of insulin to prevent ADDL-induced synapse damage (EC50 of 90 nM). The mechanism comprises inhibition of oligomer binding at synapses and requires insulin/IGF signaling. DCI showed no effects on AÎ² oligomerization. We propose that inositol glycans and DCI, a compound already established as safe for human consumption, have potential as AD therapeutics by protecting CNS synapses against AÎ² oligomers through their insulin mimetic activity.âPitt, J., Thorner, M., Brautigan, D., Larner, J., Klein, W.

We evaluated the hypothesis that low postprandial plasma insulin levels in lean exercise-trained individuals are associated with low concentrations of incretin hormones. A cross-sectional study was performed to compare postprandial incretin hormone levels in lean endurance exercise-trained individuals (EX; n = 14, â¥40 yr) and age- and sex-matched, nonobese, sedentary control subjects (CON, n = 14). The main outcome measures were GLP-1, GIP, insulin, and glucose incremental areas under the curve (AUC) as measured in plasma samples collected during a 2-h,75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The EX group had lower body fat percentage (14.6% Â± 1.1% vs 23.3% Â± 1.7%, P = 0.0002) and higher maximal oxygen uptake (53 Â± 2 vs 34 Â± 2, P < 0.0001) than CON. Glucose AUC did not differ between groups (P = 0.20). Insulin AUC was lower in EX (2.5 Â± 0.5 vs 4.2 Â± 1.2 Î¼UÂ·mLÂ·1000 min, P = 0.02). No differences were observed between groups (EX and CON, respectively) for GLP-1 AUC (3.5 Â± 0.7 vs 4.1 Â± 1.1 pmolÂ·minÂ·100 L, P = 0.61) or GIP AUC (19.2 Â± 1.4 vs 18.0 Â± 1.4 pgÂ·minÂ·1000 mL; P = 0.56). In CON, insulin AUC was correlated with AUC for GLP-1 (r = 0.53, P = 0.05) and GIP (r = 0.71, P = 0.004), but no such correlations were observed in EX (both P â¥ 0.67). Low postprandial insulin levels in lean exercise-trained individuals are not attributable to lower incretin hormone concentrations. However, exercise may decrease the dependency of postprandial insulin levels on incretin hormones.\n\nDiabetes and cardiovascular disease: the potential benefit of incretin-based therapies.\n\nPubMed\n\nAddison, Daniel; Aguilar, David\n\n2011-04-01\n\nThe health burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to increase worldwide.
