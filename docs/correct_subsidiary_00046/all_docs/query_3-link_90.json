The discovery of recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibody technologies in the 1970s markedthe birth of the biopharmaceutical industry. Biopharmaceuticals are complex macromolecules derived from recombinant DNA technology, cell fusion, or processes involving genetic manipulation. They include recombinant proteins, genetically engineered vaccines; therapeutic monoclonal antibodies; and nucleic acid based therapeutics (i.e. DNA based drugs), including gene therapy vectors. While small molecule drugs of traditional pharmaceuticals \"re delivered orally, biopharmaceuticals are usually administered by subcutaneous, intravenous, or intramuscular injection. Proteins expressed by genes are the targets of most drugs on the market and in development. Companies look for a compound that binds to a protein, either activating it or block it from working. In some cases, a protein can also be used as a drug e.g. insulin or human growth hormone. The first drug produced via genetic engineering was human insulin, which appeared on the market in 1982. By mid-2000, 84 biopharmaceuticals had been approved for marketing with almost half launched during the past three years. Worldwide sales have grown more than seven-fold over the past decade to reach US $ 15 billion by 1998. The US represents 46% of the market; compared to 36% for conventional drugs, due to a combination of earlier regulatory approval, easier market acceptance, and greater pricing flexibility than other countries. Although biopharmaceuticals comprise only 5% of world prescription drug sales, they account for six of the top 50 selling drugs, 13% of new medicines approved by the FDA in the 1990s and about 18% of all drugs in development. At the end of 1999, there were 369 biotechnology drugs in US clinical development against 438 disease indications with 25% in Phase III. Despite decreases in regulatory approval times in the US and the EU, there has been a substantial increase in the time biopharmaceuticals spend in clinical development, from 39.4 months for products approved in the 1980's to 61.5 months in the late 1990's. A large number have also been discontinued in Phase III. Many of the earlier products were recombinant versions of natural hormones with relatively well-understood properties compared to newer biopharmaceuticals with more difficult therapeutic targets and undefmed disease mechanisms. Also, the hurdle for discontinuing development is higher for a biotechnology company because it only has a handful of products in clinical development and its lead product largely determines its stock price. The biopharmaceutical industry is a key part of the knowledge-based economy. Biopharmaceutical development, however, is inherendy a high-risk activity. BiopharmaceutiCalS are gaining significance worldwide as big pharma companies are realizing the need to fill their depleted pipelines and due to unmet medical needs. About 300 bio-ventures are in place in Korea, 200 in Australia, 170 in India, 140 in Japan, 100 each in China and Taiwan and 30 in Singapore alone. Asia is becoming a prominent region for the sector due to huge natural resources for biotech development and a huge pool of bio-scientists, positive demographic trends, market growth potential, favourable government policies and returning of scientists from the Western countries. Asian countries lack first class scientists and scientific business managers, lack strong research base, low R&D investments, shortage of private venture capital and financial skills to efficiendy allocate early-stage capital. In the US, venture capital community has a critical role in bioentrepreneurship. This critical part of value chain needs to be addressed for the Asian biotech industry to thrive. (Pharmabiz.com, 16th April 2005) In the next 15 years more than 20 per cent of chemical drugs would be replaced by biologicals/ biotech drugs.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\n1.2 ADVANTAGES OF RECOMBINANT BIO-PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS Conventionally proteins and other biological products, processed from human or animal serum or tissues, often are of low purity. On the other hand, rDNA promises around 99 per cent purity, higher efficacy (therefore lower dosage requirement) and lower side effects. The other advantages with recombinant technology are that the final protein can be changed by a slight modification of the amino acid sequence. In other words, gene expression can be modified easily with faster product innovations. Recombinant drugs can be manufactured without encountering shortfall of raw materials. Besides; companies do not have to depend on factors like shortage of donors or animals. Many products like plasma derived hepatitis vaccines, human growth hormone, erythroprotein are dependent on donors who have to pass through stringent tests to ensure good quality proteins. Recombinant technology is free from such issues. The unlimited supply of recombinant drugs means constant and steady flow of products, hence is likely to be a driving factor in the coming years. Since recombinant drugs can be produced en masse, they achieve economies of scale much faster than chemically developed/animal derived drugs. This in turn results in lesser costs of the final product. The lower price, combined with the benefits offered by them make them value for money products. For instance, recombinant erythropoietin is about 30 per cent less expensive than the currently available imported products in India. Similarly, many Asian companies (predominantly Indian & Chinese) manage to sell Hepatitis B vaccines at low prices. This has encouraged local governments to include Hepatitis B vaccme in its list for compulsory vaccines. Biotech attempts at understanding individual response to drugs. Traditional methods focused on having the same drug for the entire population. This meant savings for the manufacturer. Genetic testing could let pharmaceutical companies segment people into four groups, according to how they react to a given drug: high responders (those who respond especially well), low responders, non responders, and adverse reactants. Warner-Lambert's revenues from Rezulin would have grown much more quickly had it been possible to identify the patients susceptible to the liver problem, who could then have taken the drug provided their Jiver enzyme levels were monitored. Instead, the company lost about $200 million in potential sales while it investigated the problem. (Naik Nitin, 'Asian Biotech Industry' A checklist on challenges ahead, Pharmabiz.com, 18th April 2002). With approximately 350 products in clinical testing and more than 1,000 others in early development phases, biopharmaceuticals are growing at almost twice the rate of total pharmaceuticals.\n\n1.3 PRODUCT DEFINITION Biopharmaceutica1 Products: Although small molecule drugs remain the standard trea.tment for disease, new strategies based on the engineering of proteins, genes and cells as therapeutic agents will revolutionize medicine in the coming decades. Areas may include gene therapeutics, tissue engineering, stem cell biology, cell-based therapeutics and gene correction technologies. There is a growing conflict between the development of small-molecule and large-molecule therapies-between the pharmaceutical industry's traditional synthetic organic chemicals and the complex proteins and antibodies that are emerging from biotechnology. Many new drug targets key on proteinprotein interactions, and traditional small molecule approach is getting abandoned. Industry sources estimate that about 30% of the drugs in the development pipeline are biopharmaceuticals-the majority at pre-clinical stages. Industry expects that the 40% failure rate for small-molecule drug candidates in late-stage clinical trials will probably translate into a bleak prospect for success in biotech drugs.\n\n4\n\nBiopharmaceuticals\n\n30 biotech drugs missed critical milestones in phase IT or phase ill trials. Still, 20 biopharmaceuticals received final approval last year, and 15 received approvals for new indications. From their small base~urrently 8% of the $ 390 billion worldwide drug market-biopharmaceuticals are expected to reach 15% of a $ 550 billion market by 2006. Barriers to developing large-molecule therapies are: (i) The mainstream pharmaceutical industry is still geared to the production of small-molecule drugs and lacks the infrastructure to produce major biopharmaceutical products, (ii) Small-molecule drugs can be administered in oral dosage form, whereas large-molecule drugs are administered via injection-a less popular option with patients and (iii) The cost of producing biotech drugs. is much higher than that of manufacturing small-molecule drugs. Biologics: Biologics, include products, which may be regarded as conventional biologics and recombinant biologics. Conventional biologics consist of blood derived polyclonal antibodies and clotting factors, antibiotics, and classical vaccines based on live or killed viruses, and are frequently classified as biopharmaceuticals, but these products long predate the emergence of recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibodies. As per an estimate, there are over 1100 biologicals in pre-clinical stage, over 220 biologicals in phase I stage, over 340 in phase II stage, about 80 in phase III and about 380 are approved or waiting for approvals.\n\nBiopharmaceuticals: Chemically synthesized small molecule drugs have been the mainstream of the traditional pharmaceutical industry. Biophannaceutica1s are complex macromolecules created through the genetic manipulation of living organisms using gene cloning, recombinant DNA (gene splicing), or cell fusion technologies. In terms of product type, these include: . • Recombinant proteins; • Recombinant antigen vaccines and vaccines crafted from genetic material such as DNA; • Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies; and • Oligonucleotides (short sequences of DNA or RNA) such as antisense molecules which interrupt the production of disease causing proteins by inhibiting gene function and gene therapy which can enhance the production of a missing protein through the addition of a synthetic gene. Conventional drugs have molecular weights of the order of several hundred daltons but biopharmaceuticals are 100 times or more larger e.g. interferons (20,000), interleukins (15,000), tPA (70,000), and Factor VIII and several monoclonal antibodies (close to a million). The first recombinant protein (human insulin) was launched in 1982, the first recombinant vaccine (against hepatitis B) in 1986, the first therapeutic monoclonal antibody (against kidney transplant rejection) also in 1986, and the first and only oligonucleotide in 1998 (against Cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients). No gene therapy product has yet been approved. Recombinant proteins dominate the biopharmaceutical market accounting for the bulk of sales to date. Generics (or, more appropriately, multisource pharmaceuticals) are typically defined as pharmaceutical preparations that: • are essentially similar to an original product; • involve an active substance with expired patent protection; • are approved through a simplified registration process; and • sell under a common name typically with very little (if any) promotional activities.\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nEssentially, generic pharmaceutical companies offer consumers a cheaper version of a product for which patent protection has expired. Within this framework, a critical success factor is represented by the ability to develop the generic copy with relatively modest investments, in order to make the economics work. Generics are prescription medicines that have lost patent protection and are being marketed by one or more companies that did not originally develop the drug. They are essentially similar to the original product, are approved through a simplified regulatory process and are sold under a common name with very little promotion. By extension, the term 'BiogenericsJ is used for pharmaceutical preparations (involving a biologically active substance) stemming from modern biotech tools. As with pharmaceutical generics, these biogenerics are essentially similar to an original biopharmaceutical whose substance patent has expired, are approved through a simplified abbreviated registration process, and are sold under the generic substance name as opposed to a brand name (e.g., EPO as opposed to Epogen). Biogenerics refers to therapeutic products based on genetically engineered or recombinant technologies. Biogenerics are generic versions of pharmaceutical preparations involving a biologically active substance that has generally been created using modern biotech tools. These products are still in their infancy due to the relatively recent patent expirations of the first branded set of biotech products. Biotech-engineered drugs are products based on large molecule proteins. On the other hand, generics generally refer to non-biologi 1,000\n\n$ 40-65\n\n$ 32-55\n\n1,000-5,000 30-100\n\n< 40\n\n(a) These costs are for bulk active purified proteins but do not include the fill and finishing costs associated with the production of biopharmaceuticals.

The drug discovery value chain can be broken down into five stages: from target discovery (5000-10,000) to lead discovery (500-1000) to clinical trials, one has about five from the original 10,000, making it to phase III and, possibly, one goes to the manufacturing stage, to the market. Biopharmaceuticals with exception of insulin are much more expensive than small molecule drugs. Monoclonal antibodies, for example, are in the range of US $ 15,000 to $ 25,000 per year, estimates for ex vivo gene therapy are over US $ 100,000, while certain orphan drugs e.g. genetically engineered blood clotting factor for heamophiliacs can cost as much as US $ 150,000 per year. The new generation of vaccines will not be affordable outside industrialized countries. Governments and third party payers are increasingly demanding evidence that pharmaceuticals generate benefits commensurate with their high costs .(e.g. reduced public health care expenditures, decreased mortality, functional improvement, increased quality of life, or shorter length of therapy). Ontario, BC, a number of countries (Australia, New Zealand, Finland, UK, France, Italy, Norway and the Netherlands), and several US managed care groups (e.g. Blue Cross, Blue Shield) have instituted mandatory cost-effectiveness submission guidelines. However, comparisons are difficult because of the lack of standard study methodologies, the use of placebos in clinical trials, problems in measuring quality of life benefits and improved workplace productivity, and in accounting for differences in the cost of health care inputs from country to country. Clinical trials have generally not been aimed at demonstrating long-term health outcomes and cost savings so the need to capture this additional information will increase trial costs and extend development times.\n\nBiopharmaceuticals\n\n10\n\n1.7 BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS NfJ.\n\nExamples\n\n1.\n\nAntianaemic Agents\n\nErythropoietin (EPO)\n\n2.\n\nAntihaemophilic Agents\n\nFactor VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Tissue Factor, von Willebrand Factor\n\n3.\n\nAnti-inflarrunatory Agents\n\nAngiogenic Factors, Inhibitors of Proteolysis, Colony Stimulating Factors, Transforming Growth Factors, HeparinBinding Growth Factors, Interferon-Gamma, Interleukins, Lipocortins, Lysozyme, Superoxide Dismutase, Tumor Necrosis Factor\n\n4.\n\nAntineoplastic Agents\n\nAngiogenic Factors, Aproliferin, Inhibitors of Proteolysis, Colony Stimulating Factors, Interleukin-3, Granulocyte/ Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor, GranulocyteColony Stimulating Factor, Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor, Endothelial Cell Growth Factors, Epidermal Growth Factor, Erythroid Differentiation Factor, Interleukins, Interferons, Transforming Growth Factors, Tumour Necrosis Factors, Laminin, Monoclonal Antibodies\n\n5.\n\nAntithrombotic and Fibrinolytic Agents\n\nHirudin, Protein C, Protein S, Thrombomodulin, Pro-Urokinase and Urokinase, Streptokinase, Tissue Plasminogen Activator, Antithrombin III\n\n6.\n\nAntiviral Agents\n\nInterferons, Tumour Necrosis Factors, Antisense Nucleic Acids, Recombinant Vaccines\n\n7.\n\nCardiovas~lar\n\nAlpha-I-antitrypsin, Angiogenic Factors, Apolipoproteins, Atrial Natriuretic Factor, Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide, Lipid Exchange Proteins, Superoxide Dismutase\n\n8.\n\nGrowth Factors\n\nNerve Growth Factor, Osteogenic Factors\n\n9.\n\nHormone Replacement Therapies\n\nInsulin, Proinsulin, Growth Hormone, Calcitonin\n\n10.\n\nImmunomodulators\n\nColony Stimulating Factors, Interferons, Interleukins, Tissue Necrosis Factors, Monoclonal Antibodies, Catalytic Antibodies\n\n11.\n\nWound Healing Accelerators\n\nEpidermal and Fibroblast Growth Factors (EGF and FGF), Platelet-Derived Growth Factor, Transforming Growth Factors, Somatomedinsflnsulin-Like Growth Factors\n\n12.\n\nOther Biopharmaceuticals\n\nAnalgesics, Gastrointestinal Agents, Anti-obesity Agents, Respiratory Agents, Elastase Inhibitors, Superoxide Dismutase, Human Pulmonary Surfactant Protein, Atrial Natriuretic Peptide, Sex Hormones and Related Products, Gonadotrophins and their Releasing Factors, Inhibins, Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide\n\nSystem-Related Agents\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\n1.8 CLASSIFICATION OF BIOLOGICS No\n\nCategory\n\nClass\n\n(I) Blood and Blood Derivatives • Cellular Components. • Stem Cells.

These include: • Enzymatic - proteins that trigger all the chemical reactions that occur in the cells of living organisms. • Transport - proteins that carry other substances throughout the body or molecules aC{\"Qss cell membranes. For instance, the protein haemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to other parts of the body. • Structural- proteins that help in supporting functions in the body. For instance, Keratin is the protein that is important for supporting hair and other skin parts. • Storage - proteins that store amino acids. For instance, casein is the protein in milk that provides a source of amino acids for baby mammals. • Hormonal - proteins that coordinate bodily activities. For instance, insulin is the protein hormone secreted by the pancreas that regulates the level of sugar in the blood. • Receptor - proteins that are built into the membrane of a cell and detect chemical signals released by other cells. They contribute to the cell's response to the chemical stimuli. • Contractile - proteins that help in movement. For example, actin and myosin are responsible for the movement of muscles. • Defensive - protect the body against diseases. For example, antibodies are proteins that protect the body against viruses and harmful bacteria. • Immunoregulators - Proteins that act as molecular messengers in cell-cell interactions for immune response. For example interleukins. Protein-based drugs are: Cytokines, Hormones, Clotting Factors, Vaccines, Monoclonal Antibodies.\n\n1.11 EMERGING BIOPHARMACEUTICALS Mimetics and peptidomimetics (small molecule compounds that mimic proteins and peptides) have advantages over proteins in terms of ease of delivery and cost, but there are considerable technical challenges in mimicking the large and intricate protein-protein interacting surfaces and overcoming the weak binding forces of small molecules, a major cause of side effects. Examples include mimetics of insulin and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (in early stage development), peptide based mimetics of erythropoietin (late stage), and Montreal based Neurochem's mimetics of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs - complex carbohydrates that promote amyloid fibril formation characteristic of Alzheimer's) which compete with naturally occurring GAGs to inhibit deposition of amyloids (early stage). Glycotherapeutics (complex sugars/carbohydrates) have significant potential both as drugs and drug targets because of their diverse biological roles (cell surface carbohydrates act as binding sites for other molecules, playing structural roles in cancer transformation, immune system regulation, tissue repair, and anti-infection responses, as well as genetic disorders such as Gaucher's and Fabry'S diseases) and their enormous structural diversity (more than 10 million polysaccharides can be formed from nine common monosaccharides compared to 16,000 peptides from 20 amino acids). However, their application as biopharmaceuticals has lagged far behind protein drugs because they are difficult molecules to analyse and synthesize. Fully Human Monoclonal Antibodies First generation mouse-based antibodies provoked a strong immune reaction in humans limiting their clinical utility. Strategies to generate more human compatible antibodies include mouse-human chimeras (60%-70% human protein) first introduced in 1995, followed by humanized antibodies (90%-95% human protein) in 1998 in which certain mouse antibody amino acid fragments are grafted onto a human antibody. The next generation now in clinical\n\n14\n\nBiophannaceuticals\n\ndevelopment are fully human antibodies produced via methods such as transgenic mice containing human antibody genes, phage display, or collection of human B cells from infected individuals which are then fused with human tumor cells to create antibody producing hybridomas. Because of their high costs and large dose requirements, advances in manufacturing capability are needed to meet market demand. Vaccines Conventional vaccines based on inactivated (killed) viruses; live, attenuated (weakened) viruses; microbial toxoids; or antigenic fragments (subunit vaccines), have a number of disadvantages. 11 New vaccine' strategies include:\n\n• recombinant antigen vaccines where the antigen is produced in bacteria or yeast rather than extracting it from chronic human or animal carriers (e.g. hepatitis B); • recombinant vector vaccines using weakened viruses such as poliovirus, vaCCInIa virus or salmonella bacterium as carriers of the disease causing organism to overcome the inability of inactivated whole antigens or recombinant antigen vaccines.to enter cells and express the desired gene product (hepatitis B, HIV, herpes simplex, in development); • DNA vaccines, produced from a core gene of a virus, are effective against those pathogens that change their exterior protein coat by attacking the interior proteins of a virus (HIV, malaria, and a number of anticancer applications are the closest to commercialization); and • RNA vaccines (particularly applicable to yellow fever and polio caused by RNA viruses). Genomics has the potential to improve the effectiveness of existing vaccines and ot:sign vaccines for diseases for which no protection currently exists: by sequencing invading bacterial and viral organisms, those critical genes that encode the proteins that cause disease can be identified, leading to the development of novel and more effective antigens. Complete DNA sequences of most human pathogenic viruses and more than 20 bacterial pathogens have already been determined. The first genomics derived vaccine (Group B meningitis) developed by Chiron is expected to enter clinical trials in 2001. Vaccines are also being developed as anti-cancer agents, involving attempts to activate immune responses against antigens in the tumour to which the immune system has already been exposed. Research is also being undertaken on edible vaccines e.g. transgenic bananas in order to offer an improved mode of delivery. Gene therapy Whereas recombinant proteins and antibodies are produced outside the body and administered to the patient,gene therapy has the potential for the body to produce the desired protein on its own if a synthetic gene with the correct DNA sequence for that protein can be inserted into targeted defective cells. A number of major challenges have to be solved: design of a safe and effective gene delivery system, the short duration of gene expression, control over where the transferred gene is expressed, and possible immune reaction caused by the vectors, genes or new proteins. Many efforts now concentrate on conditions that require only transient gene ~xpression, e.g. cancer and coronary artery disease, because sustained gene expression is not necessary once the targeted tumor cells die or new blood vessels grow to bypass blocked arteries.\n\n15\n\nIntroduction\n\n1.12 FDA-APPROVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS AND VACCINES Product NR.me Actimmune\n\nGeneric NR.me gamma interferon\n\nActivase\n\nCompany Genentech, Inc.\n\nDR.te ofApprovR.l Dec. 1990 Nov. 1987\n\nGenentech, Inc.

The current global market for biopharmaceuticals is well in excess of $ 25 billion and is expected to approach $ 40 billion within the next couple of years. 200 million people world-wide use biopharmaceuticals and there are 2,500 biotech companies producing these products. It is forecasted that in 2005, 70 per cent of the drugs in the market will be from biopharmaceuticals and 20 per cent of the top 100 drugs will be developed using biopharma research. The largest biopharma market is the US that accounts for 46 per cent of total sales. Biogenerics drugs are set to replace 70 per cent of the conventional therapies by the year 2025. Drugs that go off patent during the 2004-2006 period include Erythropoietin a (Amgen, J&J and Sankyo), Sermorelin (Serono), Palivizumab (Abbott), Alteplase (Genetech, Boehringer Ingelheim,\n\nMarket for Biopharmaceuticals\n\n25\n\nMitsubishi and Kyowa Hakko Kogyo), Somatrem (Genentech) and Filgrastim (Amgen and Roche). The global market for interferon product is estimated to be $ 1.8 billion. The global biopharmaceutical market is estimated at Rs. 33,000 crores and is said to be growing at the rate of 15 per cent annually, in a scene dominated by global majors. India is seen as a key source and market for biopharma and food. When several big drugs go off patent in the coming years, pharma companies from all over will be getting into this market quickly through the biotech mode. New analysis from Frost & Sullivan, Strategic Analysis of the World Plant Molecular Farming, reveals that the biopharmaceutical market generated revenues of USD 45.0 billion in 2004. It is likely to reach USD 98.2 billion by 2011. In 2004, overall generic and biogeneric revenues worldwide totaled $ 39 billion, with an ;lverage growth rate of 10%. The U.S. comprised the largest portion with $ 17.4 billion. This was followed by Europe with $ 12 billlion, Asia with $ 5.5 billion and the ROW region with $ 4.1 billion. By May 2005, some 160 biopharmaceuticals (recombinant therapeutic proteins, monoclonal antibody based products used for therapeutic or in vivo diagnostic purposes, and nucleic acid based products) have gained marketing approval in the US and EU. Approximately one-fourth of new drugs coming to market are biopharmaceuticals. These drugs have benefited some 325 million people worldwide. These biopharmaceuticals generate over $ 30 billion annually with sales projected to cross $ 50 billion by 2010. 12 biopharmaceuticals got approval in US and EU in the year 2004.\n\n2.2 US MARKET According to one estimate, US Biologic products demand in 2001 was $ 32.3 billion. Recombinant proteins accounted for 44%, monoclonal antibodies - 15% and conventional biologics (vaccines, blood producs, diagnostics) accounted for 41%. US demand for biologics will advance almost 12 per cent annually to over $ 56 billion in 2006. New product introductions evolving from advances in recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibodies will spur growth. Applications in the treatment, prevention and diagnosis of complex viral, malignant and auto-immune disorders will see the strongest gains in demand due to the safety and performance shoncomings of available conventional products. There are around 45 competitors in the field of biologics, including Amgen, Biogen, Johnson & Johnson, Aventis, Eli Lilly, Genentech, Genencor, Wyeth, Baxter, GlaxoSmithKline, Schering-Plough, Merck, Biogen, Chiron, MedImmune, and Genzyme.\n\n2.3 EUROPEAN UNION MARKET The research-based pharmaceutical industry in Europe accounts for about 3.5% of the total EU manufacturing value-added and for 15% of the whole EU business R&D expenditure and performs well on most standard measures, such as: • employment: about 588,000 jobs in Europe, including 100,500 in R&D units; • R&D investment:\n\nE\n\n20,200 million in 2002 (up from\n\nE\n\n7,900 in 1990);\n\n• trade surplus: E 36,000 million in 2002 (up from E 7,100 in 1990). , According to latest research from Frost & Sullivan, Biopharmaceuticals Industry Analysis Quantification of Supply and Demand of Manufacturing Capacities, Europe generated an estimated US $ 8.30 billion in global biotech revenues with R&D spends totalling almost US $ 5 billion in 2002. However, since the early 1990s, the research-based pharmaceutical industry in Europe has been losing competitiveness with respect to the US. Data for 2002 and preliminary figures' for 2003 confirm the vulnerability of Europe's research-based pharmaceutical industry. Benchmarking and performance indicators show that the US has continued to improve its relative position as a locus of innovation.\n\n26\n\nBiopharmaceuticals\n\n• In 1990, the global research-based pharmaceutical industry invested still roughly 50% more in Europe than in the US. Today, the same industry is investing 40% more in the US compared to investments in Europe. • Between 1990 and 2003, R&D investment in United States rose fourfold while in Europe it only grew 2.6 times. • In 1990, the European companies still invested 73% of their R&D spending in Europe, while in 2000 this figure declined to 59%. • In 1960-65, European companies invented 65% of new chemical entities (NCEs) placed on the world market, but by the end of '90s, this share had fallen to about 35%. • Although Europe's biopharmaceutical sector is growing steadily, it remains dominated by its American counterpart. While direct employment is estimated at 33,300 in Europe, about 142,900 employees work in the US. • In 1990 the European market was the world's largest market with a 37.8% share (against 31.1 % for the North American market); in 2003, North America accounted for 49.2% of the world pharmaceutical market against 27.8% for the European market. • Between 1992 and 2002, the US market grew by 11.8% per annum well ahead of Europe (weighted average growth of 7.0). Figures adjusted for inflation show a higher differential of market growth in relative terms, with the US market growing twice as fast as the European market. These market evolutions have particularly benefited to US-based companies which have significantly increased their share in sales of new medicines and development of new molecules. • According to IMS Health data, 70% of sales of new medicines marketed since 1998 are generated on the US market, compared with 18% on the European market. • The fragmentation of the EU pharmaceutical market results in a lucrative parallel trade which benefits neither social security nor patients but deprives the industry from additional resources to fund R&D. Parallel trade was estimated to amount to E 4,300 million (value at ex-factory prices) in 2002. It would be too simplistic to attribute the deterioration of the European pharmaceutical environment to a single factor. As a whole, Europe remains less attractive for R&D investments than the US. The economic and regulatory framework, the science base, the investment conditions, and societal attitudes towards new technologies all contribute.\n\n2.4 ASIAN MARKET The Asian biotechnology market, which is dominated by the biopharmaceuticals that represents 68.4 per cent of the total size, was estimated at $ 9.63 billion in 2001. The other significant market is genomics (dominated by pharmacogenomics) and molecular diagnostics and the trend of the prominence of biopharmaceuticals is likely to continue in the future. The industry projections for 2002 stood at $ 10.72 billion in the Asian market. Biotech companies in the US typically spend about 50 per cent of their turnover on R&D. This is drastically different from Asian companies spending less than 20 per cent on the same. To have a faster turnaround time for producing new molecular entities, it is essential for biotech companies to have techniques like combinatorial chemistry and high throughput screening. However, Asian companies are not able to afford these. Hence, they focus on developing products that have already been developed by other companies worldwide. This has resulted in price wars in the biopharmaceutical markets.\n\nMarket for Biopharmaceuticals\n\n27\n\nSales from imported products constiUlte a major chunk of the biopharmaceutical markets in Asia. Examples include recombinant streptokinase, recombinant insulin and recombinant interferon. However, the import duty for these products is phenomenally high (in countries like India the duty stands at 44 per cent). On the other hand, local companies have neither the technological infrastrucUlre nor the supply of raw materials to produce them indigenously. As a minimum volume criteria drives companies to import products future rationalization of the duty strucUlre is considered necessary.\n\n2.5 INDIAN MARKET The areas that the biopharma industry could focus on are manufacruring and marketing of biogenerics, contract manufacUlring, contract research and development and over-the-counter products that are naUlral extracts. The biopharmaceutical industry in India is mainly restricted to two segments; recombinant drugs and monoclonal antibodies. The Indian Biopharmaceuticals is in the development stage with about 30 players currently in the business. With a host of activities happening, this market is likely to almost double in terms of its revenue turnover by 2004. The major advantage of entering this market is the short timelines needed to develop a product and make it available in the market. The total Biopharmaceuticals market is worth Rs. 2800.1 million in 2001. Revenues are expected to reach to Rs. 4028.3 million by 2004. The market for recombinant medicine such as vaccines in India is expected to rise by over 80 per cent to about Rs. 958 crores by the year 2005 from the current market of Rs. 535 crores in India. Biopharmaceuticals is restricted to recombinant drugs and monoclonal antibodies. The potential of the Biopharmaceuticals market in India is large. Many of the products in this market are imported, which is why they are expensive. However, a number oflndian companies have entered/are planning to enter this market. They are expected to introduce products at much lower prices. This is likely to result in larger volumes by the end of the forecast period. With over .350 biotech drug products in the pipeline across the world, this is also the chance for Indian pharma biotech companies. By 2005, the Indian market for recombinant medicine is also tipped to grow from Rs. 535 crore to Rs. 958 crores. Investments into biodrugs are also expected to grow to Rs. 500 crores. Currently, four companies are into making the hepatitis B and several pharma companies have active biotech plans.\n\n2.6 CHALLENGES, ISSUES AFFECTING BIOPHARMACEUTICALS The challenges affecting the biopharmaceutical products market are: • Small biotech start ups find marketing of products difficult • Moderate success rates daunts research activities • Myths surround biopharmaceutical products. The driving forces of this market are: • Large scale production leads to lowering of production costs • Inadequacy of traditional drugs to fulfil a need and perception of the value and safety of the therapy • Unlimited production ensures constant supply The factors that restrain the Biopharmaceuticals mark~t in India are: • High investment results in companies focusing one or two products and hence enter price war zones\n\n28\n\nBiophannaceuticals\n\n• High capital and recurring costs hinder investments • Absence of microorganisms patent laws deter companies from investing in basic research • A large number of regulatory bodies in the country slow down processes of approval • High duties on imported products deters distributors\n\n2.7 DEMAND OUTLOOK FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICALS Most important factor in the growing demand for therapies is increasing elderly population in industrial nations over the next 25 years. The main causes of death are cardiovascular disease, cancer, and respiratory disorders, all of which are strongly age-related. Other age-related illnesses such as osteoporosis, arthritis, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's are major factors affecting quality of life. Mortality from cancer, diabetes, liver and kidney diseases have hardly changed, offering significant areas for research breakthroughs. Development of drugs for treatment of cancer is a major opportunity area for biotech firms. The investment needed to develop a cancer drug is lower than other diseases: the field has high priority with regulatory authorities who are willing to give it fast track status on the basis of smaller (and therefore cheaper) clinical trials (a few extra months of survival could be enough to win FDA approval); the clinical community is highly concentrated; and the market size is often larger than the approved indication because of a high off-label use (for other cancers). Infectious diseases, the third most common cause of death in the US, highlight the pressing need for new vaccines and antibiotics with novel mechanisms of action to avoid growing drug resistance. Only one new class of antibiotics has been approved over the last 30 years. Global Biopharrnaceutical Sales are expected to increase by 5% p.a. over the next five years approaching US $ 20 billion by 2004. Growth will largely be driven by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, new approved indications for drugs already on the market, and second-generation versions of existing blockbusters such as EPO and interferon alpha and beta. Many of the new biopharmaceuticals in development are aimed at niche markets and may never reach the blockbuster status of EPO, human insulin, or human growth hormone. . Products and Markets: By mid-2000, 84 biopharmaceuticals had been approved for marketing with almost half launched during the past three years. Worldwide sales in 1998 totalled US $ 15 billion. Although representing only 5% of world prescription drug sales of $ 300 billion, biopharmaceuticals comprise six of the top 50 selling drugs, 13% of new medicines approved by the FDA in the 1990s, and 11% of all drugs in development. The US is the largest and most rapidly growing market, accounting for 46% of sales, compared to 36% for conventional prescription drugs, reflecting a combination of earlier regulatory approval, easier market acceptance and greater pricing flexibility. Europe and Japan are the next most important markets, accounting respectively for 30% and 17%. Recombinant Proteins: Recombinant proteins will continue to dominate the biopharmaceutical market. Genome sequencing efforts are making it possible to identify new protein candidates; protein product life cycles are longer than synthetic molecules because they are harder to duplicate and manufacturing methods are unique; new delivery vehicles may make oral or inhalation delivery possible; and proteins such as growth factors will allow \"firms to enter the market for regenerative medicine organ and tissue repair. The first drug candidates derived from genomics (an anti-obesity drug from Amgen and four drugs from Human Genome Sciences for wound healing, obstructed arteries, infections, and as an adjunct in cancer chemotherapy) are all protein drugs.\n\nMarket for Biopharmaceuticals\n\n29\n\nProtein Biogenerics: A number of US biopharmaceutical patents (e.g. interferon alpha, human insulin, human growth hormone, and hepatitis B vaccine) will expire within the next five years, potentially opening the market for biogenerics. However, competition may not be as intense as that currently experienced in the generics industry. With traditional chemical generics, extensive clinical trials are not required for marketing authorization as long as bioequivalence studies confirm that the rate and extent of drug adsorption and hence safety and efficacy are similar. Proteins on the other hand are much more complex molecules whose mode of action is not completely understood and whose properties are influenced by many factors during the production, purification, and formulation processes, such as host cells and culture conditions. Because biological products are produced in living organisms, they do not have the same manufacturing consistency as drugs based on synthetic chemistry. Regulatory standards for biogenerics are still being developed. To prove that impurities and inactive compounds, which might differ from the original process, do not affect the safety and efficacy of the generic, new clinical trials may be required to validate the manufacturing process. The costs required for these trials, as well as the fact that the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals is more difficult and expensive, could be a significant barrier to entry. In addition, patent holders are developing second-generation products which are longer lasting and do not have to be injected as often. Recombinant Vaccines: The first FDA-approved recombinant vaccine (against hepatitis B) came in 1986, followed in 1998 by a vaccine against Lyme disease. Chiron also developed a recombinant vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough) but this is only marketed in Italy. The scarcity of approvals is due to numerous technical challenges: devising the correct recombinant antigens; increasing the immune response (the engineered protein has a limited lifetime in the body which reduces its antigenicity compared to inactivated/innocuous viruses); and designing broad antigenic variants of rapidly mutating RNA viruses such as HIV and influenza. Monoclonal Antibodies (Mab): Since the first approval of a therapeutic Mab in 1986, it took a decade for the next product to reach the market (to treat blood-clot-related complications in patients undergoing angioplasty), and are now achieving notable successes e.g. respiratory syncytial virus. Mabs are more versatile than other drugs as they can be constructed to treat a wide range of diseases such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease; are one the fastest ways of translating genomicsderived targets into therapeutics by targeting novel cell surface receptors; and entail relatively fewer subjects for clinical trials as they are designed to target specific cells. As anti-cancer agents, antibodies can be used alone to disable cancer antigens; conjugated to cytotoxic drugs or radioisotopes to kill tumor cells; or used as a vaccine in which an antibody is designed to mimic a tumor antigen in order to stimulate the immune system to identify and eliminate cancer cells with that particular antigen on its surface. The first anticancer antibody (against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was launched in 1997 and the first antibody linked to a chemotherapy agent was approved in 2000 against relapsed myeloid leukemia. Gene Therapy: Gene therapy was originally proposed as a treatment for genetic disorders such as hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis, but over 80% of clinical activity is currently focused on cancer, AIDS and cardiovascular disease, areas considered to be more commercially promising. Worldwide, approximately 4000 patients participated in nearly 400 trials since 1990 for a variety of diseases but no convincing evidence of a long term beneficial effect has been established. In the US, 25 products were in clinical development at the end of 1999 with over two-thirds in Phase I. Only in cancer gene therapy has progressed into Phase III with only two products (against head and neck cancer and melanoma). It is still to be established as to whether the entire solid tumor can be killed or only those cancerous cells around the site of the injection, and whether there will be any effect on malignant cells that may have migrated elsewhere in the body.\n\n30\n\nBiophannaceuticals\n\nAntisense: Antisense involves the use of nucleic acids (oligonucleotides) to prevent the production of proteins expressed by specific genes through RNA targeting. It is still an experimental technology with considerable challenges such as finding the right gene to target, delivery mechanisms and costs. Only one product (Isis' Formivirsen for the treatment of CMV retinitis, a virus that causes blindness in AIDS patientS) has been approved. Most antisense drugs are a' long way from market and suffer from the same delivery problems as gene therapy.

In certain discussions, Biopharmaceutical is expressed as (Bio) pharma [name is purposely bracketed in parenthesis] used in a wider context, which includes traditional therapies using local plants and biological ingredients, bioprospecting, modern pharmaceutical industry based on organic chemistry synthesis and recombinant DNA (rDNA), and hybridoma technologies. Biopharmaceutical industry is a typical combination of biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry. Biopharmaceutical sector in developed countries is typically represented by hundreds of small start-up companies. Pharmaceutical companies are facing increasingly stringent regulatory requirements, intense competition, pressures to control costs, and demands for lower prices. For the rapidly growing biopharmaceutical segment of the industry, there are additional hurdles: (i) constantly changing technology, (ii) evolving regulations for biologics, and (iii) intense public and political scrutiny of biotechnologies such as gene therapy and stem-cell research.\n\n36\n\nBiopharmaceuticals\n\nBruce Babbitt, JanHasker Jonkman, and Paul McKim in their article on \"Small Biopharmas Face Unique Challenges\" \"Outsourcing Early-Stage Drug Development Issues\" describe important issues faced by small biopharmaceutical start-ups. Small start-up biopharmaceutical companies have to face additional hurdles than expressed above. These are limited funding, dependence on a single product, the need to find additional investors or partners to move their product forward, and pressure from investors to show results quickly. Small start-up biopharmaceutical companies have little or no experience in preparing regulatory submissions, interacting with regulatory agencies, designing and managing clinical trials, or producing investigational drug supplies for clinical trials under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). During the last 30 years, the biopharmaceutical industry has successfully launched nearly 1,400 new chemical entities as human therapeutics, and has achieved strong sales as a result. In 2000, the global biopharmaceutical industry was projected to have invested US $ 58 billion in R&D. In 2001, the output of the global biopharmaceutical industry in terms of new drugs was the lowest in ten years. Only 31 new drugs were recorded as having been launched by the industry as a whole during 2001. Many companies in the biopharmaceutical industry are beginning to focus on previously unidentified disease targets and on marketing innovative medicines designed to treat conditions for which there is no existing treatment, or where treatment is inadequate. This is going to involve entirely new R&D processes and also more complex and longer clinical development than in the past. The secret of a successful generic biopharmaceutical industry lies in preparing and tackling the manufacturing, regulatory and scientific hurdles that are coming its way. Outsourcing in the biopharmaceutical industry began in the 1980s and exploded in the 1990s in the three core areas of clinical trials, contract manufacturing and sales force solutions. Staffing for clinical trials is found to be burden even by large pharmaceutical company. So outsourcing of this laborious work became a practice. Large pharmaceutical companies in spite of the fact that they did have the production setup found very soon even contract manufacturing appealing. This happened at peak in 1990s. Tomorrow even R&D will get outsourced. \"Biopharmaceutical Industry Contributions to State and US Economies\" a study conducted by the Milken Institute focuses on the economic impact of America's biopharmaceutical companies including jobs, economic output, and taxes paid - both at a national level and on a state-by-state basis. According to this study, America's biopharmaceutical companies are creating over 2.7 million jobs across the United States. It found that over 400,000 Americans are directly employed in the biopharmaceutical industry and that, on average, 6 jobs are created economy-wide for each biopharmaceutical job. The biopharmaceutical industry cannot be identified using the Standard Industrial Classification, which distinguishes firms on the basis of their output rather than their technology or production process, and international data are difficult to compare. Many biotechnology firms, for example, are identified, as biopharmaceutical companies to differentiate them from the mainstream pharmaceutical industry, but their prime focus are small molecule drugs targeted against proteins thought to be important in the disease pathway (proteins can be used both as drugs i.e. biopharmaceuticals or drug targets). Biologics, an area that consists of blood derived polyclonal antibodies and clotting factors, antibiotics, and classical vaccines based on live or killed viruses, are frequently classified as biopharmaceuticals, but these long' predate the emergence of recombinant DNA and monoclonal antibodies. Insulin, for example, was originally obtained from porcine or bovine pancreas while human growth hormone was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers. The biopharmaceutical category also often includes drugs derived from plants, fungi or marine organisms, but these are more in the realm of traditional medicinal chemistry research based on the random screening of natural compounds.\n\nBiopharmaceutical Industry\n\n37\n\nIndustry Size: There are approximately 3,000 dedicated biotechnology companies worldwide employing 230,000 people with the US accounting for 40% of firms and 70% of employment. Publicly traded firms - including an estimated 100 that floated IPOs during 2000 - number approximately 460 of which 74% are based in the US and 18% in the EU. The segment involved in biopharmaceuticals numbers about 150 firms. Only a handful of biotech firms -:- primarily those involved in biopharmaceuticals- have a product on the market. The industry as a whole continues to experience major losses because of high R&D costs. The largest and most successful (e.g. Amgen, Chiron, Biogen and Genentech) are mainly US based. With the exceptions of Serono (Switzerland), Celltech (UK), and Bio-Technology General (Israel), few non-US firms have brought a biopharmaceutical to market, reflecting their later startup dates. The total market capitalization of all public European biotechnology companies, for example, is only a little larger than Amgen. Japan has few dedicated biotechnology companies, with the industry primarily consisting of large food and pharma firms with historic strengths in fermentation attempting to diversify into biopharmaceuticals.\n\nIt is important to understand the distinction between biotechnology as a new process technology and as a drug discupery research tool. The first uses genetic engineering to manufacture large molecular weight drugs that cannot be directly synthesized or extracted. The second involves understanding the molecular basis of disease and the search for new therapeutic targets using techniques such as cloned receptors as screens or transgenic organisms created through gene knock-out technologies to determine protein function; most of the focus is on small molecule drugs that interact against those targets. As the pharmaceutical industry is using biotechnology in drug discovery, it will likely maintain its dominant position in small molecules, but the development and manufacture of protein-based therapeutics requires a completely different set of core competencies. Industry Structure: The biotechnology industry consistS of three groups: dedicated biotechnology firms, usually university spinoffs, researching disease mechanisms at the molecular level; traditional pharmaceutical companies (\"big pharma\") marketing drugs developed by biotechnology firms; and a specialized tier of companies serving both the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with platform technologies that can speed up the drug discovery process or improve drug delivery. The boundary between these three groups has blurred. Big pharma is investing heavily in molecular biology and genomics, biopharmaceutical firms are moving into small molecule therapeutics because of production and delivery advantages, and platform companies are entering the drug development field because of the prospects for higher returns.\n\n3.2 BIOPHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY A breakdown of clinical development candidates among the top pharmaceutical companies shows that major drug firms are paying increasing attention to large-molecule, primarily protein, therapeutics. Big drug companies are typically viewed as committed to small-molecule drugs-even if they employ biotechnology steps in discovery and early development. However, small purely biotech companies and labs owe the credit of advances in biopharmaceuticals. All of the major drug players had begun biopharma programs prior to their big acquisitions. Most biopharma products in the top drug companies' portfolios were acquired along with the biotech firms that developed them. Others were accessed through partnerships. Through acquisition, major companies have also taken over well-established biopharma R&D and manufacturing operations. In most cases, the big drugmakers avoided the risks taken by biopharma pioneers. Amgen, Wyeth, Roche, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, are top in the ranking of biopharmaceuticals in terms of manufacturing of biologics (as compared to small molecules). Pfizer, Abbott are also strong biopharma players. Among the top 10 drug companies, Roche has the longest involvement in biopharmaceuticals. With 40% of its sales coming from biopharmaceuticals-top products include\n\nBiopharmaceuticals\n\n38\n\nRituxan (rituximab) for non-Hodgkins lymphoma and erythropoietin f~r treating anemia-Roche is the second largest biopharma firm in the world by sales. For global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, the primary value driver of the genomic era will be an explosion of targets. Today's 400 or so targets are estimated to increase to at least 4,000 during the next decade. The $ 300 billion pharmaceutical market could grow to $ 3 trillion by 2020. These targets will be used both as diagnostic and focal points for the development of new precision drugs.

The Indian Biopharmaceutical business presently is estimated at $ 200 million and is expected to grow to about $ 3.3 billion by 2007-08. It is dominated by recombinant proteins, vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. The potential of the biopharmaceuticals market in India is large. Many of the products in this market are imported, making them expensive. The biopharmaceutical sector is likely to witness doubling of its revenue turnover by '05 from the current levels of Rs. 33,000 crores. Wockhardt is aiming to launch a slew ofbiopharmaceuticals in the US and the European Union using India as a cost..effective base. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is working through its arm Aurigene and through its biotech and diagnostics division, it is developing biopharmaceuticals, vaccines and diagnostics. While Ranbaxy Laboratories is investing about Rs. 120 crores in Hyderabad to cover biopharmaceuticals, Bangalore-based Biocon India is entering the sector through a joint venture company with Cuba-based Centre for Molecular Immunology (eMI) to manufacture and market a ~~lect range of products.\n\nBiopharmaceutical Sector in India\n\n43\n\nProducts like insulin and erythropoietin are doing well here, but interferons and monoclonal antibodies (MABs) are also considered interesting by some pharmaceutical companies. But in India, currently, only two MABs are available for therapeutic use, for the treatment of cancer. While one is used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, the other is used for a subset of breast cancer patients. The global market for biopharmaceuticals, which is currently valued at $ 41 billion, has been growing at an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21% (over the previous five years). With over one-third of all pipeline products in active development being biopharmaceuticals, this segment is set to continue outperforming the total pharmaceutical market and could easily reach $ 100 billion by the end of the decade. Pharma is a very strong sector for India but it does not have the same excitement in the global context in terms of new products, whereas biotech offers you that scope, because it will be affordable to do research in biotech. With this potential, a number of Indian companies have entered or are planning to enter this market. They are expected to introduce products at much lower prices. This is likely to result in larger volumes by '05. For Indian pharma companies, the major advantage of entering this market is the short timelines needed to develop a product, availability of human resource and produce it at an affordable rate in the market. In India, Biopharmaceuticals is restricted to recombinant drugs and monoclonal antibodies. With a paucity of funds and infrastructure, biopharmaceutical research is restricted in these two fields. The large and diverse Indian population is a potential database for genetic analysis. It is estimated that there are as many as 28,000 endogamous groups in the country. A sizeable number of rare genetic disorders are found too. In spite of this genetic pool, pharmacogenomics, or the development of tailor made drugs suited to the gene type of a patient, has not yet made its mark in India. The essential aspect of pharmacogenomics is an understanding of all the genes that determine action and sensitivity to drugs. This would help in minimizing adverse drug reactions, finding the set of people who would respond best to a particular dosage and identify new drug targets. The challenges affecting the biopharmaceutical products market, the driving forces of this market and the factors that restrain the biopharmaceuticals market are already mentioned in Chapter 2 and are important while considering development of biopharmaceutical market in India. The Indian Biopharmaceuticals is in the development stage with about 30 players currently. The total Biopharmaceuticals market was worth Rs. 2800.1 million in 2001. Revenues are expected to reach to Rs. 4028.3 million by 2004. This represents a CAGR of 15 per cent between 2000 and 2004. Most of the present revenues stem from recombinant products. Bharat Biotech, producing the fist biotherapeutic molecule from India, and the first protein against staphylococcus infection has received a global patent for Lysostaphin, which works on staphylococcus infection. The market potential is $ 12 billion. Production facilities as manufacturing base and interdisciplinary base are important issues for India to develop in this sector.\n\n4.2 SCENARIO OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS In biotech sector in India, biopharmaceuticals is the largest segment in market. Biopharma Bioservices Bio Industrial\n\n75.24% 8.95% 6.74%\n\nBiopharmaceuticals\n\n44\n\nBio Agri\n\n6.95%\n\nBio IT\n\n2.09%\n\nIn biopharmaceuticals, share of different category of the product is: Vaccines\n\n-\n\nSales of US $ 383.6 million (2004-2005)\n\nTherapeutics\n\n-\n\nMarketing licenses granted for over 25 recombinant therapeutic proteins\n\nDiagnostrics\n\nSales US $ 138.2 million (2004-200S)\n\nTherapeutics\n\nAccounts for 16.7% of total biopharma sales. Diagnostics is forcasted to grow by 35-40% in 2005.\n\nBiotherapeutics The biotherapeutic business features generic biotherapeutics that is a pre-genome business and new biotherapeutics that is a post-genome. The question is how much is one lagging behind, even with pre-genomic biotherapeutics. Insulin was approved in 1982 and companies are still struggling to come out with insulin. There are multiple approaches to biotherapeutics; natural products can be biotherapeutic. So can stem cells, improved and modified vaccines, proteins, genes and monoclonal antibodies. Not just protein alone. One has to look at the bigger picture. Natural products as biotherapeutics include plant sources such as taxol and trypsin inhibitors, animal sources such as immunoglobin produced by horses and cow urea and through the mining of microbial diversity. This has traditionally been used for small molecule but has not been exploited from the biological and therapeutic points of view. Most of it is used for antibiotics. Two monoclonal antibodies currently available in India are Mabthera (rituximab) and Herceptin (Transtuzumab). Both are marketed by Nicholas Piramal/Roche. Mabthera is indicated for relapsed/ refractory low-grade B-cell Non Hodgin's Lymphoma (NHL). It was the first monoclonal antibody to receive approval for a cancer indication in 1997. The product was made available in India in January 2001. The parent company for developing this drug - IDEC, is also developing a murine version of Mabthera, Zevalin, which is linked to a radioisotope for refractory B-cell NHL. Coulter Pharmaceutical's Bexxar is a similar product that targets the same antigen on B-cells but is conjugated to a different radioisotope. Herceptin is used for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress the HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor2) protein and who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Product patents are expected in India by 2005, and once the system is implemented, Indian companies would not be allowed to reverse engineer molecules that are under patent protection globally. However, Indian companies would still be able to compete in the domestic market for generics, that is, drugs on which the patent has expired. The option available to the Indian companies would be to either operate in the generics market or invest in R&D and invent new chemical entities and dosage forms so as to achieve growth in the long run. The global market for biopharmaceuticals is estimated to grow at nearly 30 per cent per year for the next two years. As against this, the Indian biopharmaceuticals market is expected grow at a CAGR of 15 per cent during the same period and that too driven mainly by volume growth rather than value. Experts expect the Indian biopharmaceuticals market to increase to Rs. 400 crores in 2004 from the current Rs. 280 crores in 2002. Recombinant products and monoclonal antibodies will be characteristic of the Indian market. Advances in genomics and rapid understanding and exploitation of genetic information to make tailormade drugs suited to the gene type of the patients will drive the industry in advanced markets.\n\nBiopharmaceutical Sector in India\n\n45\n\nAccording to a Frost and Sullivan report on biopharmaceuticals, absence of microorganisms patent laws deter companies from investing in basic research and a large number of regulatory bodies in the country slow down the registration and approval process. High capital and recurring costs and herd mentality of focusing on me too products and the subsequent price wars are cited as the other factors that restrain the biopharmaceuticals market in India. The cost of biotech research per say may be cheap in India, but government policies still do not encourage investments in this high-risk area where success rate is moderate. There is a general opinion that the public sector will have a central role in the biotech field because biology is not ideal for a business centric or purely commercial exercise with short-term goals. Globally speaking, around 100 biopharmaceuticals are in late stage development. There are 700 biotech molecules in human clinical trials, 140 of which are cancer therapeutics and over 2,000 new products are in pre-clinical development. More precisely, there are six antibody therapies in phase III development. Currently, the focus for Indian companies is restricted to the development and manufacturing of biogenerics. The priority'is towards monoclonal antibodies, insulins, hepatitis B vaccine, interferon and erythropoetin as the demand is huge. Augustin Maria and Shyama V. Ramani in their paper on TRIPS and its possible impact on the Indian biopharmaceutical industry for the presentation in the conference (held in Toulouse) on \"Markets for Pharmaceuticals and the Health of Developing Nations\" have commented on Strategic positioning of Indian firms in biopharmaceutical sector. According to them, the Indian biopharmaceutical firms visualize six main areas of activity to improve their competitive position in India and abroad: 1. Entry into the biogenerics market and the market for off-patent diagnostics, and 2. Vaccines; 3. Contract research; 4. Creation of new pharmaceutical products; 5. Bioinformatics; 6. Clinical trials. The recombinant drugs that are approved for marketing in India include (1) Human insulin, (2) Streptokinase, (3) Erythropoietin, (4) Hepatitis B vaccine, (5) Human growth hormone, (6) Human interleukin 2, (7) Human Interleukin 11, (8) Granulocyte colony stimulating factor, (9) Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, (10) Alpha-Interferon-2a, (11) Alpha-Interferon2b, (12) Gamma-Interferon, (13) Blood factor VIII, (14) Follicle stimulating hormone, (15) Tissue plasminogen activator, (16) Injection-Forte - the bone building drug, (17) Xigris, (18) Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), and (19) Platelet derived EGF.

Healthcare market and people are looking for more and more generics. India has started assuming significance as a big generic supplier. India is well-poised to have an exciting time in biopharmaceuticals in the next five-ten years. Biopharma production is a very sensitive process and having reliable power supply, telecommunication system, lo~istics structure, etc, is very important. This is where China is ahead of India. However, the fact that En~;jsh language skills, higher compared to China, is great advantage, particularly in research collaborations. Indian companies already have a very good understanding of how to deal with WHO, US FDA and other international regulatory requirements.\n\nThe national biopharmaceutical industry posted a total revenue of over US dollar 500 million (Rs. 2,292 crores) 2003, accounting for 70 per cent of the whole biotechnology industry at 700 million (Rs. 3,213 crores) which is expected to test US dollar seven billion to US dollar 10 billion by 2010, according to an \"optimistic\" estimate by the Export-Import Bank of India which has set eyes on the sector. The biopharma sector also contributed 76 per cent of the total biotech export revenue at US dollar 300 million (Rs. 1,377 crores) during the period, with vaccine business contributing most of it. Although this industry is relatively small as compared to US or some countries in Europe, it can be considered as fairly developed amongst countries in the Asia Pacific region and is showing the highest growth rates th"
