        "text": "The Pacific Northwest also aims to make a name for itself in nanotechnology. Set up in 2001, the Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL)–University of Washington joint institute for nanoscience has the aim of furthering research and education in the field. The university's Center for Nanotechnology boasts the first PhD programme in nanotechnology in the United States, funded by a National Science Foundation–Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (NSF–IGERT).\n\nState leaders are building on Oregon's reputation as the 'silicon forest' of semiconductor-based industry to develop nanotechnology. The recently established Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI) is a collaboration between Oregon universities, PNNL and companies including Hewlett Packard at Corvallis and Beaverton-based electronics firm Tectronix. ONAMI recently received $28 million in state funding to raise additional funds for these fields. The University of Oregon in Eugene is leading the training effort with its new Materials Science Institute, complete with an NSF-IGERT for MS and PhD training at the interface of chemistry and physics.\n\nV.G.\n\nSeattle\n\nHealth-related research is expanding in Seattle, with many institutions in the midst of construction to house their growing staff. Starting in 2008, the Washington Life Sciences Discovery Fund will have $35 million annually to disburse for ten years, potentially creating many new jobs.\n\nCalifornia-based pharmaceutical company Amgen plans to take a healthy helping of local talent at its facility in Seattle (pictured below). Richard Farley, Washington director of human resources for Amgen, says it plans to recruit 150 employees over the next year to grow their drug-discovery pipeline — that is a 15% increase in the workforce, primarily in research positions.\n\nPortland\n\nCompared with its neighbours on either side, Oregon's foray into the life sciences could be viewed as baby steps. But the recent $500-million public–private investment in Portland's Oregon Health and Sciences University (OHSU) — the Oregon Opportunity — was a tremendous leap towards the state's goal of obtaining its share of the bioscience industry and converting research into clinical reality. The OHSU is halfway through recruiting 70 principal investigators and staff to fill the new 25,500 square metre biomedical research building that will serve as the cornerstone of the project.\n\nVancouver\n\nVancouver may be only the eighth largest life-sciences cluster in North America, but its companies offer the highest rate of return to investors. George Hunter, president of Vancouver-based Leading Edge BC, which promotes technology in the region, credits British Columbia's progressive government policies for their impressive stats. In addition to a tax-credit programme that makes Canada a low-cost place to conduct research, business skills get specialized attention. Leading Edge has developed a one-year mentorship programme called BC Excels to address the skills needed by the biotech community.\n\nVancouver companies have also shown that they can attract talent in their own right. OncoGenex, which is developing drugs for hard-to-treat cancers, has opened an office in Seattle, having hired some of the clinical team from Corixa, a Seattle-based biotech company that recently merged with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nV.G."
