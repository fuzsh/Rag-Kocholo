        "text": "Corixa is a developer of immunotherapeutics with a commitment to treating and preventing autoimmune diseases, cancer and infectious diseases by understanding and directing the immune system. Having founded in 1994, the company conducted various preclinical development programs, including the BEXXAR® therapy and the MELACINE® vaccine. Corixa is focused on immunotherapeutic products and has a broad technology platform enabling both fully integrated vaccine design and the use of its separate, proprietary product components on a standalone basis. The company partners with numerous developers and marketers of pharmaceuticals, targeting products that are powered by Corixa™ technology with the goal of making its potential products available to patients around the world. Corixa was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline on 12 July 2005, and GSK had formerly made use of the Corixa's MPL adjuvant in some of their vaccines. The company ceased operations in March 2006.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, and commercializes pharmaceutical products for the treatment of serious medical conditions.

Merck, also known as “German Merck” and “Merck Darmstadt”, was founded in Darmstadt, Germany, in 1668, making it the world's oldest operating chemical and pharmaceutical company. The company was privately owned until going public in 1995. However, the Merck family still controls a majority (≈70%) of the company's shares. Following World War I, Merck lost possession of its foreign sites, including the Merck & Co. subsidiary in the United States. Merck & Co., which operates as Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD) outside the U.S. and Canada, is now an independent company. Merck KGaA operates mainly in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. Since Merck & Co. holds the rights to the Merck name in the U.S. and Canada, the company operated under the umbrella brand EMD Chemicals in North America, and since 2010 as EMD Millipore (after the acquisition of Millipore Corporation), formed from the initials of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt. Founded in 1668 in Darmstadt, Merck KGaA of Darmstadt, Germany, is the world's oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company. The success of the export business to the United States led in 1887 to the establishment of an office in New York, which gave rise to their subsidiary [Merck & Co.](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/merck-co-inc) four years later. Owing to World War I, Merck & Co. was expropriated in 1917. The two companies have been separate every since. Merck KGaA Subsidiaries: - [Merck Consumer Healthcare](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/merck-consumer-healthcare) - [Merck Performance Materials](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/merck-performance-materials)\n\nALK is a global research-driven pharmaceutical company that focuses on prevention, diagnosis and treatment of allergies. Since 1923 ALK has been working to improve the quality of life for allergy patients by developing drugs that target the cause of allergy.

Drug candidates based on the Company’s unique carbohydrate technology target galectin proteins which are key mediators of biologic and pathologic function. Galectin Therapeutics uses naturally occurring carbohydrate polymers with galactose residues to create complex carbohydrates with specific molecular weights. Using these unique carbohydrate-based candidate compounds that bind and inhibit galectin proteins, we are pursuing therapies for indications where galectins have a demonstrated role in the pathogenesis of a particular disease. We focus on diseases with serious, life threatening consequences to patients, and those where current treatment options are limited. Our strategy is to establish clinical development approaches that add value to the Company in the shortest time possible, and to seek partners as the program advances and requires much greater resources. Galectin Therapeutics leverages extensive scientific and development expertise as well as established relationships with outside sources to achieve cost effective and efficient development. We are pursuing a clear development pathway to clinical enhancement and commercialization for our lead compounds in liver fibrosis and cancer immunotherapy. Galectin Therapeutic stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol GALT. The company is located in a suburb of Atlanta known as Norcross, Georgia USA"
