        "text": "Massachusetts General Hospital was established to provide care to Boston's sick, regardless of socioeconomic status—an innovative idea in 1811. In the words of their founder, John Warren, MD, “When in distress, every man becomes their neighbor.” They subsequently became the first teaching hospital for Harvard University’s new medical school and have been redefining excellence in healthcare ever since. They have remained at the forefront of medicine by fostering a culture of collaboration, pushing the boundaries of medical research, educating the brightest medical minds and maintaining an unwavering commitment to the diverse community they were created to serve. They believe that because of diversity they excel, through inclusion they respect their community, and with a keen focus on equity they serve, heal, educate and innovate at the highest levels. Their first priority is the well-being of their patients—near and far. As a team they are able to maintain a singular focus on providing the highest quality, most compassionate care to each and every patient.\n\nMerck (d.b.a. EMD Millipore in the U.S. and Canada) is a German chemical and pharmaceutical company. Merck, also known as “German Merck” and “Merck Darmstadt”, was founded in Darmstadt, Germany, in 1668, making it the world's oldest operating chemical and pharmaceutical company. The company was privately owned until going public in 1995. However, the Merck family still controls a majority (≈70%) of the company's shares. Following World War I, Merck lost possession of its foreign sites, including the Merck & Co. subsidiary in the United States. Merck & Co., which operates as Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD) outside the U.S. and Canada, is now an independent company. Merck KGaA operates mainly in Europe, Africa, Asia, Oceania and Latin America. Since Merck & Co. holds the rights to the Merck name in the U.S. and Canada, the company operated under the umbrella brand EMD Chemicals in North America, and since 2010 as EMD Millipore (after the acquisition of Millipore Corporation), formed from the initials of Emanuel Merck, Darmstadt. Founded in 1668 in Darmstadt, Merck KGaA of Darmstadt, Germany, is the world's oldest pharmaceutical and chemical company. The success of the export business to the United States led in 1887 to the establishment of an office in New York, which gave rise to their subsidiary [Merck & Co.](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/merck-co-inc) four years later. Owing to World War I, Merck & Co. was expropriated in 1917. The two companies have been separate every since. Merck KGaA Subsidiaries: - [Merck Consumer Healthcare](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/merck-consumer-healthcare) - [Merck Performance Materials](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/merck-performance-materials)\n\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, tuberculosis was one of the UK’s most urgent health problems. A royal commission, entitled The Royal Commission Appointed to Inquire into the Relations of Human and Animal Tuberculosis, was set up in 1901. It aimed to find out whether tuberculosis in animals and humans was the same disease and whether animals and humans could infect each other. This page describes how, by 1919, the Commission had evolved into the independent Medical Research Council.\n\nAgenus develops and commercializes immunotherapies and vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases.
