        "text": "PERRY BACKUS, Missoulian 10/21/07\n\nHAMILTON — GlaxoSmithKline officially unveiled a $137 million addition to its Hamilton biotechnology production plant Thursday.\n\nFew could be more proud than Kent Myers.\n\nMore than 20 years ago, Myers joined a small staff of researchers working at Hamilton’s Ribi ImmunoChem Research laboratory. Their dream: to discover a way to harness the potent immune-stimulating power of components in a bacteria cell wall.\n\nThe researchers focused their efforts on an adjuvant called Monophosphoryl Lipid A MPL, for short.\n\nAdjuvants are added to vaccines to enhance their effectiveness.\n\nIt turns out that MPL is a powerful adjuvant. When mixed in quantities smaller than the head of a pin with antigens — the part of the vaccine that puts the immune system into action — MPL can work wonders.\n\nMyers, who now serves as GSK’s Hamilton plant site director, said there are still many working at the site who spent years developing MPL.\n\n“For those of us who worked at Ribi ImmunoChem, it seemed like a far-off distant goal maybe someday we’d get to this point,” he said. “And now we’re here.”\n\nIn 1999, Ribi ImmunoChem was purchased by Corixa Corp. In 2005, the Belgium-based GSK Biologicals acquired Corixa.\n\nThat same year, GSK announced a $2 billion expansion effort to accelerate the development of a global vaccine production infrastructure. The plant in Hamilton, along with acquisitions in Canada and Pennsylvania, were part of the company’s initiative to ensure a continued supply of vaccines to the U.S. population.\n\nProduction of MPL in Hamilton will play a critical role in the company’s global vaccine development effort, said GSK industrial operations vice president John Picken.\n\nThe 130,000-square-foot addition was constructed in Sweden in 55 separate semi-trailer-sized modules. The high-tech, specialized pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment came from all parts of the globe and was installed in Sweden before being broken into modules and shipped to Houston.\n\nThe modules were then trucked across the country before being carefully lowered into place by cranes at the 35-acre Hamilton site.\n\nThe construction is mostly complete, and the company is working through a required testing period before full-scale production begins sometime in mid-2008.\n\nWhen that occurs, the facility’s production of the freeze-dried white cake-like adjuvant will triple.\n\nWith more than 20 vaccines in clinical development, GSK is counting on the immune-boosting power of adjuvants and its promise for vaccines both today and into the future.\n\nAdjuvant technology is what brought the company to Hamilton, Picken said. Retaining the people who’ve spent decades working on the technology was very important to GSK, he said.\n\n“This is the center of the universe for MPL,” he said. “It’s exactly the right spot for us.”\n\nThe state of Montana has stepped up to help train a work force for the growing industry.\n\nLast December, the Montana Department of Commerce provided a $400,000 community development grant to help begin developing a work force for GSK. The University of Montana created a 14-week lab tech program that provided the basic skills workers would need to work at the plant.\n\nOver the last 16 months, GSK’s work force in Hamilton has doubled to about 260 employees, Myers said. The target is closer to 290 when the facility is up and running at full capacity.\n\n“The nice thing about these jobs is they are offered in a wide range of educational levels,” Myers said. “We have employees with high school educations or two years of college up to the Ph.D. level.”\n\nThe average base salary level is $40,000 almost double the average wage in Hamilton.\n\nSchweitzer said it’s important that Montana continues to invest in training its residents for high-tech jobs like GSK offers. The state is competing not only against other places in the U.S. for facilities like these, but also against countries like India and China, he said.\n\nCompany officials suggested further expansion could boost employment to the 800 mark sometime in the future, Schweitzer said. The largest employer in the state has 2,200 employees.\n\n“When you get to 700 or 800 employees, you’re on the speed dial of the governor’s telephone,” he said. “These are not only good jobs, they’re good-paying jobs so the best and brightest of Montana can stay in Montana.”\n\nHamilton Mayor Jessica Randazzo said GSK’s expansion goes beyond economic development for the Bitterroot Valley.\n\n“It’s an economic explosion,” Randazzo said.\n\nThe company’s decision to continue and expand its operations in Hamilton creates the kind of economic diversity and high-paying jobs that help drive further economic opportunity, she said.\n\nIt also establishes Hamilton as a national “hotbed” for biotechnology, Randazzo said.\n\n“The work being done here is putting Hamilton on the map, not only in the U.S. but throughout the world,” she said.\n\nLove\n\n0\n\nFunny\n\n0\n\nWow\n\n0\n\nSad\n\n0\n\nAngry\n\n0\n\nThe business news you need\n\nGet the latest local business news delivered FREE to your inbox weekly.\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy."
