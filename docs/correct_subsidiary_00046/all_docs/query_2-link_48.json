        "text": "Dr. Lieber is an academic researcher with training in molecular and applied medicine. His lab has been working on the biology and translational aspects of human adenoviruses for almost three decades. They have capitalized on mechanisms evolved by adenoviruses and developed new approaches for the treatment of cancer involving recombinant adenovirus proteins. Two of these approaches are currently being translated into the clinic. More recently, they have developed a new technology that allows for in vivo genome engineering of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) for the therapy of genetic blood diseases and infectious diseases. It involves the mobilization of HSCs from the bone marrow and intravenous injection of helper-dependent adenovirus vectors with tropism to HSCs. They have validated the safety and efficacy of our new approach in several murine disease models as well as in non-human primates. They showed phenotypic correction in mouse models of Sickle Cell Disease, b-thalassemia, hemophilia A, and spontaneous cancer. They used the in vivo approach to express secreted virus decoy receptors and demonstrated protection against SARS-CoV2 challenges in mice and Simian/Human Immunodeficiency Virus challenges in rhesus macaques. More recently, they have focused on in vivo genome editing with base and prime editors to treat Sickle Cell Disease in a mouse model. He is an academic co-founder of two other biotech companies (Ensoma Bio and Compliment Corp) that work on the clinical translation of his lab's technologies.\n\nDr. Cobbs is the Director of the Ivy Center for Advanced Brain Tumor Treatment at Swedish Neuroscience Institute in Seattle. He is an authority in the area of glioblastoma surgery and research. He first hypothesized that malignant gliomas and other tumors may be associated with chronic viral infection with human cytomegalovirus (CMV), and he published the first evidence that CMV is associated with glioblastoma. His group has subsequently found evidence of cytomegalovirus infection in other tumor types and evidence that the CMV receptor is a major receptor tyrosine kinase involved in tumor growth. These findings have led other researchers to explore treating these tumors with antiviral drugs and tumor vaccines against the CMV pp65 protein. Preliminary studies demonstrate unexpectedly prolonged survival in these glioblastoma patients.\n\nDr. Cobbs received his undergraduate degree from Princeton University and his medical degree from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB). He completed a residency in Neurological Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), where he also completed a fellowship in molecular neuro-oncology. Dr. Cobbs has previously been a principal investigator on NIH R01 grants, Special Project in Oncology Research (NCI SPORE) grants at UAB and UCSF, as well as an editor at Journal of Neuro Oncology and other journals. He has been a member of the NCI SPORE and PO1 brain tumor study sections.
