        "meta_description": "131I-Tositumomab has been used in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is generally recommended that high-energy collimators be used to image patients before they receive 131I-tositumomab therapy, to determine the effective half-life for therapeutic dose and gross biodistribution. Because many nuclear medicine departments do not possess high-energy collimators, this study was designed to assess the suitability of using medium-energy collimators. The effect of scanning speed was also investigated, in an attempt to optimize the acquisition time. Methods: Measurements were taken using an elliptic anthropomorphic torso phantom and an organ-scanning phantom fitted with fillable spheres (1–5 cm in diameter) and organ inserts. Three phantom studies were performed with differing initial 131I concentrations in the organs, the spheres, and the thoracic and abdominal chambers. Images were acquired with both high-energy and medium-energy collimators and at acquisition speeds of 20 and 100 cm/min. The half-life for each combination (study/collimator/speed) was calculated from a linear fit of the data. The contrast of the tumor sphere was assessed using 2 identical regions, placed on and beside the sphere, and averaged over several time points. Biodistribution and image quality were visually assessed by 2 independent observers. Results: Measured half-life values and visual assessment of biodistribution showed no significant difference between the 2 collimators ( P = 0.32) or acquisition speeds ( P = 0.85). A significant difference in the contrast of the tumor spheres was observed between the 2 collimators ( P < 0.01) but not between acquisition speeds. Visual assessment of the images showed increased noise on the image acquired at 100 cm/min, although this noise did not affect lesion detectability. Conclusion: Measured half-life is not significantly different between the 2 collimators; hence, calculation of the residence time would be nearly the same. Medium-energy collimators can be used to accurately calculate the 131I-tositumomab therapeutic dose and detect alterations in biodistribution.",

        "text": "Bexxar\n\nmedium-energy collimators\n\nwhole-body acquisition speed\n\nTositumomab labeled with 131I (Bexxar; GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals) has been used recently in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma by targeting CD20 antigen expressed in B-lymphocytes (1–4).\n\nA 131I-tositumomab therapeutic regimen consists of a dosimetric component and a therapeutic component. Whole-body counts measured at 0, 3 or 4 d and at 6 or 7 d after dosimetric 131I-tositumomab administration are used to determine the total-body residence time. Whole-body images are viewed to assess altered biodistribution. Organ dysfunction, such as urinary tract obstruction, can result in increased organ toxicity and poor targeting of the tumor CD20 antigen. In such a case, therapy should not be given (1).\n\nBecause of the relatively high photon energy of 131I (364 keV), it is recommended that a high-energy, parallel-hole collimator be used for the dosimetric study. However, many nuclear medicine departments, particularly smaller departments, do not have a set of high-energy collimators. Such being the case, it is important to assess the suitability of using medium-energy collimators for the dosimetric study. Compared with high-energy collimators, medium-energy collimators offer increased detection efficiency. However, scatter is also increased because of the higher septal penetration.\n\nIn this study, the application of medium-energy collimators in measuring 131I-tositumomab biodistribution, half-life, and lesion detectability was assessed both visually and quantitatively using an anthropomorphic phantom model. The results were compared with results obtained using high-energy collimators. As well, the effect of image acquisition speed was assessed for both the high-energy and the medium-energy collimators. It is important to optimize this parameter to decrease imaging time and increase throughput while maintaining image quality."
