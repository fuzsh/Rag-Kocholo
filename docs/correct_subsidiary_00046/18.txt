Corixa Chief Executive Officer, Steven Gillis said, "GlaxoSmithKline has been a long-term and steadfast partner of Corixa, not only in proprietary vaccine antigen discovery and development, but as the leading customer for our adjuvants and as a co-developer of Bexxar. Acquisition of Corixa by GSK represents a logical step given the importance of MPL in multiple GSK vaccines. We look forward to working with GSK during the upcoming transition period by assisting with continued expansion of manufacturing operations in Montana, and by helping GSK to evaluate the other programs in the Corixa portfolio."

Selected Corixa Board Members and their investment funds, all of which collectively own approximately 11 percent of the outstanding voting shares of Corixa, have entered into support agreements pledging that they will vote all their shares in favor of the transaction at the meeting of Corixa stockholders.
