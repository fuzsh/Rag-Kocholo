GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has completed the acquisition of ID Biomedical. This follows regulatory clearances of the transaction and adoption of the acquisition agreement by ID Biomedical’s shareholders. ID Biomedical becomes a wholly-owned subsidiary of GSK.

“This is a major step toward fulfilling our mission of becoming a leading global influenza vaccine manufacturer,” said Jean-Pierre Garnier, chief executive officer of GSK.

ID Biomedical provides GSK with a significant increase in flu vaccine manufacturing capacity, which will improve GSK’s ability to address both seasonal and pandemic influenza threats. The combined seasonal flu vaccine production capacity of the newly acquired Canadian facilities and of GSK's Dresden plant is expected to reach around 150 million doses per year before the end of this decade, states a company release.

“We are actively working with governments and health authorities around the globe to support their plans for pandemic flu readiness and we are committed to bring the capabilities of our flu vaccine production facilities to the global preparation effort,” continued Garnier.

This transaction follows recent strategic initiatives to expand GSK’s vaccine research and production network in North America, including the acquisition of Corixa Corporation and the purchase of the Marietta vaccine site.

“With this acquisition, GSK continues to move forward to support the delivery of GSK’s broad pipeline of novel vaccines in North America. We are very pleased to expand GSK's vaccines capabilities in Canada. We have every confidence that the excellent relationships built up by both organisations with the Canadian public health authorities will continue,” said Jean Stéphenne, president of GSK Biologicals, the vaccine division of GSK.

GlaxoSmithKline is one of the world’s leading research-based pharmaceutical and health care companies.
