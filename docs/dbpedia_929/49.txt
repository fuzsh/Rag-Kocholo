TWINSBURG, Ohio -- Revco Drug Stores Inc. said Tuesday the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron has approved its purchase from CVS of 29 Peoples Drug stores in Virginia and two in North Carolina, plus the pharmaceutical inventory and files of 16 stores in Virginia and three in North Carolina.

The drug stores are located primarily in the Tidewater region, including Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Va.

The deal is scheduled to close around July 2 and would leave Revco with 267 stores in North Carolina and 175 stores in Virginia.

In 1990, Revco, which has been operating under bankruptcy protection, completed a 712-store divestiture program.

Gregory K. Raven, executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the focus of that realignment was 'the development and expansion of markets in the 10 contiguous eastern states in which Revco operates.'

'This strategic acquisition underscores that focus. As other attractive opportunities present themselves, we will study them carefully,' Raven said.

Raven said that Revco's strong operating-cash position allowed the company to to fulfill its marketing strategy. As of May 28, the company had more than $110 million in short term investments.

CVS, the drug and health and beauty aid division of Melville Corp., operates 1,300 drug stores in 17 states under the names CVS/Pharmacy and Peoples Drug.

Revco operates more than 1,100 Revco drug stores in 10 states. The privately held company is based in Twinsburg, Ohio.
