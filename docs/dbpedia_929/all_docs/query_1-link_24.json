        "text": "Big B, Inc. was a Birmingham, Alabama-based drugstore chain. The company began operation in 1968 as division of Birmingham based Bruno's Supermarkets. Most of its stores were located next to a Bruno's, Food World or FoodMax. Big B also operated a discount drugstore chain called Drugs For Less. The company had close to $800 million (~$1.44 billion in 2023) in revenue by the end of 1996.\n\nIn 1982, Big B was spun off from the Bruno's Supermarkets into an independent company, Big B, Inc., based in Bessemer, Alabama. In 1989, Big B acquired 85 Reed Drug and Lee Drug stores from Peoples Drug, giving them a presence in Atlanta, north Georgia and western Alabama. A few years later, Big B acquired 80 \"Treasury Drug\" stores from JCPenney's Thrift Drug division. Big B was finally becoming a major drug retailer in the Atlanta area.\n\nIn 1996, Big B was acquired by Revco, and within a year Revco was acquired by CVS. By the end of 1997, all Big B Drugs and Revco were operating as CVS/Pharmacy."
