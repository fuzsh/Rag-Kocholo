        "text": "Revco Drug Stores Inc. put its retail operations in 17 states up for sale Friday, a move that will affect about 150 employees in metropolitan Oklahoma City.\n\nEmployees were given the news Thursday, Revco spokesman Diana Lueptow said from the firm's Twinsburg, Ohio, corporate headquarters.\n\nThere are six stores in Oklahoma City, nine elsewhere in the central metropolitan area, and nine over the state for a total employment of about 250.\n\n\"We are not shutting down or closing them,\" she said. \"They are open for business as usual right now. Basically, we want to focus on 10 eastern states.\"\n\nThe company plans to cut its stores from 1,873 in 27 states to about 1,100 to concentrate on its strongest markets. Stores in Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas and Missouri are among those to be sold.\n\nThe chain still will operate about 1,100 drugstores with expected sales of about $2 billion. Boake A. Sells, the chain's chief executive, said in a prepared statement that the majority of Revco employees will keep their jobs.\n\nNo timetable has been set for a divestiture of the 712 Revco drugstores. The stores being cut represent about 36 percent of the chain's total sales, the spokesman said.\n\nMetropolitan area stores were identified as 5730 S May; 8015 Northwest Expressway; 1646 SW 89; 11717 S Western; 6000 NW 122; and 3639 NW 39 Expressway. There also are three stores in Edmond and single stores in El Reno, Guthrie, Mustang, Norman, Shawnee and Yukon.\n\nAcross the state there are stores in Ada, Altus, Ardmore, Chickasha, Cushing, Hugo, Muskogee (2) and Stillwater.
