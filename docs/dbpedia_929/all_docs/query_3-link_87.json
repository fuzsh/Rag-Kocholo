Normally I order from Fortnine, which is responsive and reliable. From what I can tell Revco is not an actual company but just a scam site that looks really convincing.

The only reason we've had bad reviews this year is the pandemic situation due to shippers. 25% of the hundreds of order we shipped daily between end of April and mid-July got delayed without reason by the carriers. Tracking information was not updated etc... It's a fact of life we had to deal with. Revco if a family owned business that started on our founder's parent's house garage 10 years ago. We did not expect our business to increase so dramatically and we were caught off guard and short staffed. We hired new staff, programmed a new more powerful customer service area and things are better than before the Pandemic.\n\nRevco.ca is a legitimate incorporated business in Canada. We used to be named atvtirescanada.com and we changed ot to Revco for the simple reason we started selling more and more motorcycle and snowmobile products so... ATV Tires Canada became Revco, simple as that. Company was originally founded in 2008.\n\nWhy would we scam people? We try our best (seriously) to have customers come back and purchase multiple times. Pricing is important but when something goes wrong, it's always better to get service by a human being that can resolve issues.\n\nBy the way, getting bots to post Google reviews for an online store is the best way to get your business blacklisted from Google which means instant death for ANY online business. Think about that before assuming stuff like that.\n\nI tried contacting the original poster before posting this, but no reply.\n\nI'd like to thank the people who answered truthfully about our business and all the folks that purchased from us in the past. Because without you, we are nothing.\n\nThank you!\n\nMark\n\nMarketing Mgr\n\nRevco.ca\n\nmark@revco.ca\n\nI haven't ordered. Seem reasonably legit though.

Again specifically with Schuberth, not sure if there is a shortage or if it is just Fortnine being Fortnine showing a wide variety of products whereas most of them are marked as out of stock. I was looking at the new Sena Outrush R that just came out a week or 2 ago. Features wise looks amazing for the price point and Revco is the only store that actually has it on their website, even Revzilla does not have it yet. Was going to order from Revco and just risk it but when it got to that stage it said no stock which really is not surprising as Sena seems to be the only one you can order from at the moment."
