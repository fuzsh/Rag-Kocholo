        "text": "Kiss your local Eckerd Drug store goodbye because once CVS Corp. is done, you'll hardly recognize it.\n\nBy early 2005, all of Polk's 18 Eckerd stores, with the exception of perhaps one location, will have been transformed into CVS, part of a multi-billion-dollar buyout.\n\nIn April, CVS and the Canadian Jean Coutu Group agreed to pay a combined $4.5 billion to buy and split up Eckerd Corp.\n\nCVS paid $2.15 billion for more than 1,200 Eckerd stores, including all 622 stores in Florida.\n\nAs part of the takeover, CVS has announced that it may close some stores if they are near an existing CVS. Since Polk has no CVS stores, CVS spokesman Mike deAngelis said store closings would be minimal.\n\n\"At the most, I would say only one store in Polk would close,\" deAngelis said, meaning Polk would have 17 former Eckerds transformed into CVS stores. But deAngelis added that he doesn't know what specific locations are slated to close and announcements regarding closings aren't made until employees are notified.\n\nWhether CVS closes any Polk stores is of little circumstance to Lakeland resident Harold Snow, who stopped by the Eckerd at 407 E. Memorial Blvd. in Lakeland on Thursday. He's just sad to know Eckerd is no more.\n\n\"I trade here all the time, ever since Eckerd has been here,\" Snow said.\n\nUnbeknownst to Snow, and most of Polk's pharmacy shoppers, the physical transformation of the neighborhood Eckerd already may have begun.\n\nDeAngelis said computer system conversions have either already begun at Polk stores, or will \"happen imminently.\" Inventory control also will be switched to an electronic format.\n\nThe nonelectronic changes -- the ones that will make the biggest difference to the average shopper -- won't begin for several weeks.\n\nBut when those changes do begin, \"the stores will physically become CVS,\" deAngelis said.\n\nCVS, a Woonsocket, R.I.-based company that opened its first store in Lowell, Mass., in 1963, counts among its company distinctions wall-to-wall carpeting, rather than the shiny, hard surfaces used in Eckerd and Walgreens stores.\n\n\"It provides for a more comfortable experience,\" deAngelis said.\n\nIn addition to new floor coverings, CVS will install shorter shelving and new signs, which will follow the company's red color scheme.\n\nBecause CVS emphasizes its beauty and photo departments, deAngelis said those departments, in many cases, may be moved closer to the entrance.\n\nStore conversion also will involve stocking shelves with CVS products.\n\nThe company promotes its products by saying that for 20 to 40 percent less than competing national brands, customers will enjoy the same quality and satisfaction.\n\nExamples of the CVS brand: Vitamin shampoo in 13.5-ounce bottles for $2.99; 40 newborn diapers for $8.99; and 18 cherry-flavored throat lozenges for $3.39.\n\nOne Polk City resident said she shopped at CVS all the time in Blairsville, Ga., before moving south and can't wait for the company to come into the county.\n\n\"I'm for CVS,\" said Mary Anne Wicker, who also shops at the Memorial Boulevard Eckerd. Wicker said she misses a particular kind of concealer, which she once bought at CVS but can't find anywhere in Polk. \"There are things you can get at CVS that you can't get other places, especially makeup.\"\n\nNo stores will be closed during renovations, which will cost between $300,000 and $350,000 per location.\n\nOnce the CVS transformations are complete, customers will find that hours vary by location. Some stores are open 24 hours, others close at midnight and others shut down a few hours earlier. Polk will have a few of each.\n\n\"We try to have a mix,\" deAngelis said.\n\nWhen CVS builds a new store in Florida, it typically measures about 13,000 square feet -- roughly the same size of new Eckerd stores but bigger than older versions.\n\nIn Bartow, on the northwest corner of U.S. 98 South and State Road 60, a project that was permitted as an Eckerd is under way. According to the Bartow building department, it measures 14,500 square feet.\n\nThat store will be finished as a CVS but won't be open until the first quarter of 2005. DeAngelis said decisions regarding what to do with structures under construction are being made on a case-by-case basis.\n\nEmployees at Polk's Eckerd stores, deAngelis said, will all be hired by CVS. A typical Eckerd store employed 20, deAngelis said, bringing the total number of those who will be hired by CVS to 360. That number could increase in the coming months.\n\n\"Part of the conversion involves retraining them on the computer and cash register systems,\" deAngelis said. \"One of the things we'll be looking at is whether we need to increase staffing. So we might even be hiring more employees.\"\n\nIn Polk, CVS will have strong competition from Walgreens. Walgreens, based in Deerfield, Ill., operates 17 stores in Polk and employs approximately 535.\n\nThe two companies are major competitors on a national level as well. Walgreens operates 4,480 stores across the country. As of July 3, CVS operated 4,206 stores but with the Eckerd purchase that number is more than 5,000.\n\nCarol Hively, Walgreens spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail, \"we just don't comment on the competition\" but for many, it's obvious Walgreens is gearing up for the new competition.\n\nSigns at a number of local Walgreens stores ask \"has your pharmacy been sold\" and mailers to local residents include the phrase \"there have been many changes in pharmacies in our area recently, but the only change at Walgreens is that we've constantly added stores, extended hours and introduced new services throughout this market for the past decade.\" The mailers include a check for $20 to be used toward store items after purchasing a new or transferred prescription.\n\nThe new competitor on the local drug store scene is one with an established nationwide presence, built through a history of acquisitions.\n\nIn 1990, CVS -- an acronym for Consumer Value Stores -- bought Peoples Drug. That purchase involved 500 stores and introduced the CVS name into markets such as Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nIn 1997, CVS took over Revco, a chain comprised of 2,552 stores, giving the company locations in the Midwest and Southeast.\n\nIn 1998, CVS purchased Arbor Drugs Inc. of Michigan, gaining another 207 stores.\n\nIn 2002, CVS entered the Dallas, Houston, Phoenix and Las Vegas markets. The next year, it opened locations in Minneapolis and by 2004 it had moved into California.\n\nIn July, CVS Corp, traded on the New York Stock Exchange under CVS, announced its second quarter sales and earnings.\n\nNet sales for the second quarter ending July 3 increased 7.7 percent to $6.94 billion, up from $6.44 billion in the second quarter of 2003.\n\nSame-store sales increased 6.1 percent for the quarter over the same period in 2003.\n\nIts stock closed Friday at $40.71, up a penny from Thursday.\n\nCVS may be a drug store powerhouse, and may be the newest, brightest thing in Polk County, but Jeri Jackson couldn't care less.\n\nJackson is a Realtor at Elliott & Company GMAC. She stopped at the Memorial Boulevard Eckerd on Thursday and said she shows no loyalty to one drug store over another.\n\n\"I came here because it was on the right side of the road and I didn't want to cross the street and go to Walgreens,\" Jackson said of the Memorial Boulevard pharmacy. \"CVS is just a drug store.\"\n\nRachel Pleasant can be reached at rachel.pleasant@theledger.com or 863-802-7592."
