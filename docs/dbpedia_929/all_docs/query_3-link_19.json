        "text": "The price-tag on the 220 Revco Drug Stores that Jack Eckerd Corp. agreed last week to buy is $60.5-million, if a bankruptcy judge approves the transaction June 26, according to papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron, Ohio. Eckerd last week entered into a partnership with Merrill Lynch Capital Partners to acquire the stores from Twinsburg, Ohio-based Revco D.S. Inc., once the largest drug store chain in the nation. Merrill Lynch will finance the acquisition, which will be repaid by cash flow generated by the newly acquired stores.\n\nThe Revco stores _ which will be converted to Eckerds or closed _ will be owned by a separate company called Revco Holdings II Inc., which consists of Merrill Lynch Partners and Eckerd Management.\n\nRevco is seeking to spin off more than 700 stores as part of a\n\nbankruptcy reorganization plan. In April, Revco sold 221 stores in the Midwest to a holding company comprised of Indianapolis-based Reliable Drug Stores Inc., and Acadia Partners LP, which is affiliated with Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass.\n\nThe purchase price of that transaction was $83.2-million, according to court files. A federal bankruptcy judge is expected to rule on the proposed transaction today, according to the filings. When Revco completes its divestitures, it will operate 1,100 stores in 10 adjacent states.\n\nThe purchase of the Revco stores in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas will give Eckerd 1,795 drug stores in 13 states, making Eckerd the second largest retail drug chain after Rite Aid Corp. of Shiremanstown, Penn.\n\nRevco claimed the spotlight by becoming the first leveraged buyout to collapse when the company filed for bankruptcy protection in 1988.\n\nEckerd, like Revco, went private in 1986 in a $1.2-billion leveraged buyout.\n\nThe company reported a $6.1-million loss for 1989, despite record sales of $3.2-billion, according to the recently published annual report.\n\nStewart Turley, chairman and president, said that gross profits were lower, particularly in prescription sales in the pharmacy department. In addition, Eckerd had increased staffing in stores to improve customer service, thereby increasing payroll somewhat, said Gene Ormond, company spokesman.\n\nHowever, operating profit (earnings before interest and taxes) rose to $204-million, almost double the amount reported for the year ended January 1986, just prior to the company's LBO.\n\nEckerd maintained a record-high cash flow of approximately $250-million and continued to reduce the $915-million bank debt it incurred when it went private. The drug chain's bank debt has been reduced to $420-million, the annual report said."
