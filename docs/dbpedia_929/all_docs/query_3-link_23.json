        "text": "Big B Drugs was a drug store chain that began operation in 1968 as part of Bruno's Supermarkets, headquartered in Birmingham. Most of its stores were located next to a Bruno's, Food World or FoodMax, all Bruno's-owned stores.\n\nIn 1982, Big B was spun-off from Bruno's Supermarkets into an independent company, Big B Inc., headquartered at 2600 Morgan Road in Bessemer. In 1989, Big B acquired 85 Reed Drug Stores and Lee Drug Stores in Georgia and East Alabama from Peoples Drug.\n\nThe company had 397 locations, 6,000 employees, and close to $800 million in revenue by 1996, making it the 10th largest pharmacy chain in the United States. It had experienced 19 straight quarters of sales and earnings gains until costs overshadowed revenues in the third quarter of 1995, partly because of the pricing pressure exerted by Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). The precipitous decline in earnings were compounded by higher employee and insurance costs. A new $20 million computerized tracking system, installed the same year, quickly revealed the rapidly-tightening margins, forcing the company to adjust its forward outlook statements downward, causing a tumble in stock prices. The combined effects of those developments made the company especially vulnerable to a takeover.\n\nA $14-per-share hostile takeover bid by Twinsburg, Ohio-based Revco Drug Stores was initially dismissed by chairman Anthony Bruno and was quickly raised to $15. After Big-B's investment bankers solicited offers from other rival chains, a bidding competition broke between Revco and an unnamed suitor. Revco ultimately pushed their offer up to $17.25 per share and the other suitor dropped out of the bidding.\n\nWithin months, Revco was itself acquired by Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS. By the end of 1997, all Big B Drugs and Revco were operating as CVS locations. Big B Inc. remained the franchise owner and licensee well after the change was made.\n\nBirmingham District locations\n\n520 Highway 119, Alabaster\n\n629 20th Street North Bessemer\n\n901 9th Avenue North, Bessemer\n\n2910 Morgan Road, Bessemer\n\n221 20th Street North, Birmingham\n\n7501 1st Avenue North, Birmingham/East Lake\n\n1431 11th Avenue South, Birmingham\n\n2228 Bessemer Road, Birmingham\n\n5956 Chalkville Mountain Road, Birmingham\n\n228 Gadsden Highway, Birmingham/Roebuck\n\n105 Inverness Plaza, Birmingham/Highway 280\n\n4500 Montevallo Road, Birmingham\n\nQueensbury Shopping Center, Carson Road, Birmingham\n\n2040 Springdale Lane, Birmingham\n\n301 Walker Chapel Road, Fultondale\n\n1303 Decatur Highway, Gardendale\n\n4685 Highway 17, Helena\n\n3030 Independence Drive, Homewood\n\n418 West Valley Avenue, Homewood\n\nClearbrook Road near Shades Mountain Plaza, Hoover/Bluff Park\n\n1769 Montgomery Highway, Hoover\n\nSouthlake Shopping Center, Valleydale Road, Hoover\n\n3068 Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive, Hueytown\n\n1715 Crestwood Boulevard (U.S. Highway 78), Irondale\n\n200 Highway 78, Jasper\n\nAtlantic Thrift Shopping Center, Midfield\n\nLeeds\n\nThe Crossroads, Moody\n\n2738 U.S. Highway 31, Pelham, opened January 1974\n\nCenter Point Road, Pinson\n\n315 Main Street, Trussville\n\n1451 Montgomery Highway, Vestavia Hills\n\n2480 Rocky Ridge Road, Vestavia Hills\n\n4197 Crosshaven Drive, Vestavia Hills/Cahaba Heights\n\nBellview Plaza Shopping Center Aaron Aronov Drive Fairfield\n\nReferences"
