        "text": "It was Jan. 5, a Sunday evening, and Jack Eckerd Corp. Chairman Stewart Turley felt things were coming together. The mood among the contentious creditors of Revco D.S. Inc. was shifting in his favor. An outsider might think he was kidding himself. After all, only two days earlier, Eckerd's plan--to acquire Revco and take the merged entity public--had received the least support of the three reorganization bids submitted to end the drugstore chain's three-year-plus bout in bankruptcy court. But that didn't deter Turley. Working the phones, he began to sweeten his bid and build the needed consensus among creditors.\n\nHis hunch was right. By Monday night, competitor Rite Aid Corp. had decided to bow out, deeming the deal too costly. And by week's end, most creditors had swung to Eckerd's plan from a deal that would have kept Revco independent. Now, assuming that a majority of creditors and the bankruptcy court confirm the plan, worth an estimated $779 million, it appears Eckerd will not only end Revco's tortuous bankruptcy but will leapfrog to a leading industry position."
