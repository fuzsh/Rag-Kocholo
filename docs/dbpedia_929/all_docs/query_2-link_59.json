        "text": "The old-fashioned drugstore business is entering a new phase. Although drug chains have long dotted shopping malls, many of the chains are going heavily into general merchandise, some are going into deep- discount pricing and the general merchandisers themselves are getting more into the drugstore business.\n\nThe result is increasing competition - and increasing concern - that corporate casualties are likely.\n\nPerhaps the biggest vote of confidence in drugstore potential has been cast by the K Mart Corporation, which said 10 days ago that it would acquire the 164-store Pay Less Drug Stores Northwest Inc. chain for about $500 million in cash.\n\nK Mart, the second-biggest American retailer, after Sears, Roebuck & Company, already knows the drugstore business, since it operates 895 pharmacies in its existing stores. Its acquisition of Pay Less represents its entry into the ''super'' drugstores, with their heavy complement of sporting goods, housewares and soft lines such as hosiery and linens.\n\n''We expect to show substantial growth in Pay Less,'' said Bernard M. Fauber, K Mart's chairman.\n\nSuch optimism seems warranted. A recent study by the Marketing Science Institute of Cambridge, Mass., concluded that drugs, and health and beauty aids, will represent the only area of the so-called convenience merchandise field that will enjoy a higher growth rate in the 1980's than in the prior decade. The convenience merchandise category includes groceries, meals and snacks, alcoholic beverages, tobacco, drugs, and health and beauty aids.\n\nThe New Variety Stores\n\nSometimes referred to as the new variety stores, the nation's drugstores are increasingly taking on that role by adding considerable general merchandise, and assuming the aura, bustle and merchandise complexity of the variety store chains. But some experts caution that too much non- pharmaceutical diversification may hurt expanded drugstores - and cause the same consolidations and liquidations as have occurred in some venerable variety store businesses.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
