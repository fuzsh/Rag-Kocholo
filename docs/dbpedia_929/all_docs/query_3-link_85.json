        "text": "Tell us a little about the history of your company.\n\nRevco Industries has been innovating performance protection under the Black Stallion® and BSX® brands for over 35 years. Headquartered in Southern California, we still manufacture in the USA as well as design product lines here for global production to ensure competitive prices for distributors. Our Western Distribution Center is just east of Los Angeles and a newly upsized Eastern Distribution Center is located near Memphis in the state of Mississippi.\n\nWhat has been your company’s business strategy to gain market share?\n\nWe have always preferred to work on a long-term partnership basis with our distributors and have no intention to stray from this tradition. While our main focus is on making the right products very well and at reasonable prices,\n\nwe support our distributors in any way possible insofar as to enable them to fulfill the needs of their customers.\n\nDescribe the core branded products of your company that you promote most heavily.\n\nThe Black Stallion® and BSX® brands of gloves and protective wear are renowned across industries for quality, reliability, and innovation. Our brands have been tested in boom and lean years, serving our distributors well throughout.\n\nHow do distributors contribute to your success in the marketplace?Delete Table\n\nDistributors are truly the framework that supports Revco’s success. They are the partners we count on to channel our amazing products from California to Maine, and beyond.\n\nDo you offer distributors training and other value-added services?\n\nTraining is a must in our industry, even for gloves and protective wear. As a leader in innovation, often there are advantages and features we need to educate the market about. That involves passing accurate information on to our distributors. As true partners, we make sure our distributors have the right support to do their jobs, including custom marketing tools, joint end-user calls, and other special programs.\n\nWhat business characteristics do you look for when selecting to work with a distributor?\n\nRevco seeks distributors who wish to partner with a manufacturer that constantly seeks to move forward and stay ahead of the pack. This characteristic usually applies to both parties and makes for the best success in promoting our exciting product line.\n\nDo you have any recent news to report?\n\nOur Eastern Distribution Center expanded to a new property in Olive Branch Mississippi. All operations are online as of November 2011 with better service to all our distributors.\n\nDescribe your current financial picture.\n\nWhile the economy may remain volatile, we are financially sound and focused on growth. Inventory has not been an issue for us through the past years of fluctuations and we continue to invest in comfortable stocking levels and sales support to our distributors.\n\nWhat should distributors know about your company’s future?\n\nRevco’s expertise continues to be with innovative, quality glove and protective wear solutions. We are positioned well to support any distributor engaged in maintenance and growth in virtually any industrial segment, including the growing oil, gas, mining, and 70E areas."
