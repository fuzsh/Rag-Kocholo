        "text": "Revco D.S. Inc. said today that its loss in its first quarter after emerging from bankruptcy proceedings narrowed to $1.54 million from $14 million a year earlier.\n\nThe drugstore chain's results for the first quarter ended Aug. 22 included a $3 million income tax benefit. A per-share earnings comparison was not available because Revco revised its capital structure. The company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on June 1.\n\nSales in the quarter rose to $472.9 million from $438.6 million. Comparable-store sales rose 7.2 percent.\n\nRevco said profit from operations rose to $6.1 million from $1.7 million, in part because of a lower depreciation charge resulting from its reorganization plan.\n\nRevco's first quarter is the chain's lightest season. Improved performance this year resulted from enhanced marketing and customer service efforts that \"offered value\" to customers and improved cost controls, the company said.\n\nAt the end of the quarter, Revco operated 1,147 drugstores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia and eastern Tennessee.\n\nIn trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, Revco shares were down 12.5 cents at $8.50."
