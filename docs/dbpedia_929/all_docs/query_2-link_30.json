        "text": "Editor’s note: Take a look back into The Dallas Morning News Archives.\n\nEarly Dallas drugstores were popular neighborhood institutions. You could purchase a Waxahachie (soda shop slang for a Dr Pepper and a Coke) and pick up your prescriptions — and the person behind the counter knew how to prepare both.\n\nThese family-friendly pharmacies were one-stop shops for everyone to enjoy. Beyond slinging sodas, selling toiletries and dispensing medicines, drugstores bustled as hubs of social activity — each adding value to its community. Patrons could pop by after school and pass the time reading magazines and newspapers. Or they could slip a coin into the jukebox, slide onto a stool and order two scoops and a sandwich.\n\nTake a look into The Dallas Morning News archives and relive the memories of some classic area drugstores.\n\nSkillern’s\n\nOne of Texas’ first drugstore chains, Skillern’s, was founded in 1885 in Lewisville by James Arthur Skillern. By 1895, Skillern’s established its first Dallas location near the old courthouse downtown. The chain quickly expanded, and by the 1930s, Skillern’s storefronts were sprinkled throughout Dallas. During back-to-school season, customers enjoyed a free Big Shake milkshake for every $3 to $5 spent on school supplies. In 1980, Revco Discount Drug Stores purchased the 145-store Skillern’s chain.\n\nDoc Harrell’s\n\nIn 1924, Eldridge C. Harrell opened Doc Harrell’s Pharmacy at 6348 Gaston Ave. at Abrams Road in Dallas. Seated in the heart of Lakewood, Doc Harrell’s became an East Dallas after-school hangout spot for William Lipscomb Elementary School and Woodrow Wilson High School students, including the Lakewood Rats — a street gang that headquartered and schemed there. Reminiscing on his Rat days, Dallasite John Fort extolled the Doc in The News, calling him “a father to many of the Rats.”\n\nNews writer John Anders also held fond memories of Doc’s, writing on Aug. 8, 1993: “Forty years ago, a boy growing up in Lakewood could lie on his stomach in the middle of the floor at Harrell’s Drugs and read Donald Duck comic books.”\n\nToday, a Republic Title of Texas stands where Doc Harrell’s Pharmacy once was.\n\nHarris Service Drugstore\n\nSoutheast of Doc’s, at 4852 Gaston Ave. in Dallas, stood Harris Service Drugstore. In 1945 and 1946, it posted its first classifieds in The News seeking soda counter help and registered druggists.\n\nCo-owner Paul Scarborough’s art appreciation influenced the apothecary’s decor. According to The News, it served as a gallery, rotating exhibitions of local artists’ works. The art was featured above the top shelves of the drugstore’s stock, dazzling neon borders drawing visitors’ eyes up to the works.\n\nAn unmarked car wash now stands at Harris Service Drugstore’s original location.\n\nFriedman’s Drugs\n\nHerman Friedman opened Friedman’s Drug Store in 1925 at Grand (now Al Lipscomb Way) and Harwood in South Dallas. As an Aug. 21, 1986, article attested, it was “the home of the chocolate soda for the kids who went to Forest High School ... now Madison.”\n\nIn 1942, Herman was drafted to serve in World War II, leading him to post the drugstore for sale in The News. Four years later, a new Friedman’s cropped up a half-mile away at 1705-A Forest Ave., now Martin Luther King Boulevard, and Colonial Avenue. Shelby, Herman’s brother, ran this location until 1969, after which it was taken over by Herman’s son, Arthur.\n\nWhile the second Friedman’s shop didn’t have a soda counter, it provided old-time remedies found nowhere else, such as Absorbine Veterinary Liniment and Dr. Kilmer’s Swamp Root.\n\nBig State Drug Store\n\n“When a customer comes in and says he has a cold, I don’t just point at the wall. We bend over backward to help them.” - Brian Smith, owner of Big State Drug Store\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, fewer independently run drugstores existed due to rising drug prices as well as competition from large chain pharmacies and fast-food joints. Established in 1948, Big State Drug Store in Irving set itself apart through exceptional customer service — greeting customers by name, asking how family members were doing, and sometimes sharing morning coffees with them at the soda counter.\n\nBig State Drug Store closed briefly in May 2014, resurfacing in September of that year as Big State Fountain Grill. The shop lost its drug counter but retained its soda fountain.\n\nMillar Drugs\n\nFounded in 1927, Grand Prairie’s Main Street drugstore Millar Drugs was a popular date spot where many teens opened their first charge accounts to purchase snacks, sodas and candy. The soda counter began serving hot plates in the ’60s, and fan favorites included the pressed ham sandwich, the pimento cheese sandwich and the hand-crafted cherry ­limeade.\n\nMillar Drugs fell under the limelight on a couple of occasions. In September 1960, the drugstore’s façade served as a backdrop during an impassioned speech that presidential candidate John F. Kennedy delivered atop a car trunk. Almost 40 years later, it made a cameo in the 1998 Wes Anderson movie Bottle Rocket.\n\nMillar Drugs was transferred to the Eckerd Drug chain in 1998. Nowadays, Tuscany’s Pasta & Pizza stands in its place.\n\nOrder up!\n\nOrders at soda fountains were often placed without the use of tickets, which led soda counters to develop their own distinctive language for food and drinks, such as:\n\nDraw one: a coffee\n\nA Waco: a Dr Pepper\n\nA Dallas or Shoot one: a Coke\n\nShoot a wild one: a cherry Coke\n\nShoot one frowning: a lime Coke\n\nShoot one yellow: a lemon Coke\n\nCalifornia: orangeade\n\nPalm Beach: pimento cheese sandwich\n\nMince: ham salad\n\nA pair of dobbins: two barbecue sandwiches with nothing else on them\n\nRelated:Highland Park Soda Fountain may close, but its timeless spirit will carry on"
