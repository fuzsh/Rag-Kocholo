Speaker for the evening was Dr. Seymour Blaug, Dean of the UNC School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, whose remarks entitled \"The State of Pharmacy\" included the following: \"Among the changes in pharmacy practice mentioned by Dean Blaug was the increase in the number of prescriptions filled annually in the average community pharmacy. There was a 2.5 fold increase from 11,000 to 27,000 pre- scriptions. Despite the sharp increase in the cost of living since 1967, prescription prices were remarkably stable. If the prices for pre- scriptions of identical size were measured each (Continued on Page 9) Inducted into the North Carolina Academy of Pharmacy, left to right, L. Milton Whaley, Wallace; William H.

These will be employed to process third party drug claims, to store and retrieve patient medication profiles, to retrieve information on specific drug interactions and to assist the pharmacist in financial management and in- ventory control. \"This year the federal government involve- ment in pharmacy practice reached an all- time high. Next year government's influence on the profession will be even stronger. For better or worse, pharmacy is now one of the most thoroughly regulated professions in the world. \"In addition to federal regulations there are also state laws, pharmacy board rules and regulations, and local ordinances governing pharmacy. Clearly, many of these government controls are desirable, but it is just as clear that the average community pharmacist is in- undated with paperwork and bureaucratic re- quirements that detract from his professional tasks and lead to increased drug delivery charges.\" JACKSON RETIRES A director of North Carolina Mutual Wholesale Drug Company since it was founded in 1952, Pharmacist J.

The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy 13 120 DAY MEDICAID CONTRACT REPORT SUMMARY The integrity of the private Medicaid con- tract between the State of North Carolina and Health Application Systems, Inc., has been proven clearly by an evaluation of perfor- mance during the first 120 days of the contract period (July 1st to October 31st, 1975). Simply put — since the contract began, more people are being served with a higher degree of quality health care at no increased cost to the tax- payers. SPECIFICS: 1. HEALTH APPLICATION SYSTEM, INC. HAS is processing and paying 80% of all claims during the first passthrough of the computer system. Thus far, this represents 1 million claims at a total cost of 78.7 million dollars. 22,000 additional people received medicaid services across the state without any input of additional public funds. All claims are now correctly processed and paid within 30 days — exceeding the contract requirements. Average payment time is 10 days. The sophisticated MMIS system is now in place and operative— replacing the old state processing system — a significant technical achievement. North Carolina has one of the first MMIS systems in the U.S. to become fully operational and it is the first to be completed and operative in as few as 120 days. In the first 120 days the contract has already identified approximately 4 million dollars — which cannot be considered dollar savings, but which does represent avoidance of addi- tional cost had the program continued under state administration. Inflationary pressures will affect such cost avoidances and/or savings and it is difficult to perdict rates during the remainder of the year. 2. MEDICAL PEER REVIEW FOUNDA- TION: The Medical Peer Review Foundation — involving approximately 1,000 doctors across the state — monitors and checks the quality and appropriateness of Medicaid care. This review is done by regional teams that practice in the areas where the medicaid ser- vices are performed. The Foundation — working in cooperation with hospitals, medical professionals across the state and with professional medical organizations — developed parameters for claims processing which generally audits the claim before it enters the system. The Foundation also — working with the Department of Human Resources and with hospitals and Medical groups has established a Long Term Care Bed Register which pro- 3. DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RE- SOURCES The DHR has completely revised the state plan for Medicaid. Effective December 1st a telephone network to identify recipients and verify eligibility will be operative. Also on December 1st the De- partment of Human Resources will assume the responsibility for issuance of all Medicaid eligibility labels. Subsequently — a move from paper labels to possibly plastic I.D. cards for eligibility will be considered. All these steps — are aimed at streamlining eligibility process. DHR is also establishing a procedure to monitor the MMIS system to aid the state in keeping abreast of information it needs for surveillance and utilization reviews, in keep- ing with the state's responsibility for program policy control and the eligibility determina- tion for the Medicaid program. SUMMARY: North Carolina has come a long way in the first 120 days of the private Medicaid contract. It is a highly innovative and successful con- tractual arrangement to efficiently deliver health care to the indigent people of our state. Many states have expressed interest in our program. We are now sharing information with Florida, Alaska, Georgia, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Illinois and the National Governor's Conference Health Task Force. This agreement is parts and pieces of 26 contracts and sub-contracts which are now fit- ting together like pieces of a jig-saw puzzle to complete the whole picture. It is fair comment to say that North Carolina is the only state in the southeast — and probably the nation — with a truly viable Medicaid program — one that is addressing both need and cost. North Carolina Medicaid contract is indeed a pioneer effort in health care that is providing to be highly sound and workable. 14 The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY Members — David D.

He was given a suspended jail term and fined $1000.00 The wife of a husband who had received some tranquilizers without a prescription acted as an undercover agent. RX PRICE POSTING In the following twelve states pharmacists are required to post the prices of prescription drugs — generally the 100 most prescribed drugs as determined by the state board of pharmacy: California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New York, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont and West Virginia. Several states (Washington and Arkansas as examples) permit but do not require Rx price posting. No default insurance Tofranil-PAT Geigy imipramine pamoate In depression Daily Dosage Chart r~\\ 1 h.s A major reason for drug de- faulting is multiple daily dosage schedules. Ayd* reports that 70 percent of patients default on a q.i.d. regimen; 60 percent on t.i.d.; 30 percent on b.i.d., and only 7 percent on a single daily dose. A single daily capsule that provides a full day's medi- cation would logically assure better therapeutic results. Because one capsule lasts from bedtime to bedtime, Tofranil-PM may markedly reduce the probability of missed doses. For single-dose therapy in depression when the dosage is established. Please review the prescrib- ing information summa- rized on the following page. *Ayd, F.J. , Jr. (Ed.): Int. Drug Ther. Newslett. 7(9/10): 35-50 (Nov./Dec.) 1972. Tofranil-PM@ imipramine pamoate Tofranil-PM\" imipramine pamoate Tofranil' imipramine hydrochloride USP Indications: For the relief of symptoms of depression. Endogenous depression is more likely to be alleviated than other depressive states. Contraindications: The concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibiting com- pounds is contramdicated. Hyperpyretic crises or severe convulsive seizures may occur in patients receiving such com- binations. The potentiation of adverse effects can be serious, or even fatal. When it is desired to substitute Tofranil, brand of imipramine hydrochloride, in patients receiving a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, as long an interval should elapse as the clinical situation will allow, with a mini- mum of 14 days. Initial dosage should be low and increases should be gradual and cautiously prescribed. The drug is con- traindicated during the acute recovery period after a myocardial infarction. Patients with a known hypersensitivity to this compound should not be given the drug. The possibility of cross-sensitivity to other dibenzazepine compounds should be kept in mind. Warnings: Usage in Pregnancy: Safe use of imipramine during pregnancy and lactation has not been established; there- fore, in administering the drug to preg- nant patients, nursing mothers, or women of childbearing potential, the potential benefits must be wei hed against the possible hazards. Animal reproduction studies have yielded inconclusive results. There have been clinical reports of con- genital malformation associated with the jse of this drug, but a causal relationship nas not been confirmed. Extreme caution should be used when :his drug is given to: -patients with cardiovascular disease because of the possibility of conduc- tion defects, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, strokes and tachycardia; -patients with increased intraocular pressure, history of urinary retention, or histo y of narrow-angle glaucoma because of the drug's anticholinergic properties; - hyperthyroid patients or those on thyroid medication because of the possibility of cardiovascular toxicity; -patients with a history of seizure dis- order because this drug has been shown to lower the seizure threshold; -patients receiving guanethidine or similar agents since imipramine may block the pharmacologic effects of these drugs. 'age in Children: Pending evaluation of .•suits from clinical trials in children, Dfranil, brand of imipramine hydrochlo- de, is not recommended for treatment f depression in patients under twelve sars of age. Dfranil-PM, brand of imipramine pamoate, lould not be used in children of any age scause of the increased potential for ;ute overdosage due to the high unit Mency (75 mg., 100 mg., 125 mg. and 0 mg.). Each capsule contains imipra- ine pamoate equivalent to 75 mg., 0 mg.. 125 mg. or 150 mg. imipramine 'drochloride. nee imipramine may impair the mental id/or physical abilities required for the irformance of potentially hazardous sks. such as operating an automobile One capsule lasts from bedtime to bedtime. or machinery, the patient should be cau- tioned accordingly. Precautions: It should be kept in mind that the possibility of suicide in seriously depressed patients is inherent in t^e ill- ness and may persist until significant remission occurs. Such patients should be carefully supervised during the early phase of treatment with Tofranil, brand of imipramine hydrochloride, and may require hospitalization. Prescriptions should be written for the smallest amount feasible. Hypomanic or manic episodes may occur, particularly in patients with cyclic dis- orders. Such reactions may necessitate discontinuation of the drug. If needed, Tofranil, brand of imipramine hydrochlo- ride, may be resumed in lower dosage when these episodes are relieved. Admin- istration of a tranquilizer may be useful in controlling such episodes. Prior to elective surgery, imipramine hydrochloride should be discontinued for as long as the clinical situation will allow. An activation of the psychosis may occa- sionally be observed in schizophrenic patients and may require reduction of dosage and the addition of a pheno- thiazine. In occasional susceptible patients or in those receiving anticholinergic drugs (including antiparkinsonism agents) in addition, the atropine-like effects may become more pronounced (e.g., paralytic ileus). Close supervision and careful ad- justment of dosage is required when this drug is administered concomitantly with anticholinergic or sympathomimetic drugs. Avoid the use of preparations, such as decongestants and local anesthetics, which contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g.. adrenalin, noradrenalin), since it has been reported that tricyclic antidepressants can potentiate the effects of catecholamines. Patients should be warned that the con- comitant use of alcoholic beverages may be associated with exaggerated effects. Both elevation and lowering of blood sugar levels have been reported. Concurrent administration of imipramine with electroshock therapy may increase the hazards; such treatment should be limited to those patients for whom it is essential, since there is limited clinical experience. Adverse Reactions: Note: Although the listing which follows includes a few ad- verse reactions which have not been reported with this specific drug, the pharmacological similarities among the. tricyclic antidepressant drugs require that each of the reactions be considered when imipramine is administered. Cardiovascular: Hypotension, hyperten- sion, tachycardia, palpitation, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, heart block, stroke, falls. Psychiatric: Confusional states (especially in the elderly) with hallucinations, dis- orientation, delusions; anxiety, restless- ness, agitation; insomnia and nightmares; hypomania; exacerbation of psychosis. Neurological: Numbness, tingling, pares- thesias of extremities; incoordination, ataxia, tremors; peripheral neuropathy; extrapyramidal symptoms; seizures, al- terations in EEG patterns; tinnitus. Anticholinergic: Dry mouth, and, rarely, associated sublinaual adenitis hlurred vision, disturbances of accommodation, mydriasis; constipation, paralytic ileus; urinary retention, delayed micturition, dilation of the urinary tract. Allergic: Skin rash, petechiae, urticaria, itching, photosensitization (avoid exces- sive exposure to sunlight); edema (gen- eral or of face and tongue); drug fever; cross-sensitivity with desipramine. Hematologic: Bone marrow depression including agranulocytosis; eosinophilia; purpura; thrombocytopenia. Leukocyte and differential counts should be per- formed in any patient who develops fever and sore throat during therapy; the drug should be discontinued if there is evi- dence of pathological neutrophil depres- sion. Gastrointestinal: Nausea and vomiting, anorexia, epigastric distress, diarrhea; peculiar taste, stomatitis, abdominal cramps, black tongue. Endocrine: Gynecomastia in the male; breast enlargement and galactorrhea in the female; increased or decreased libido, impotence: testicular swelling; elevation or depression of blood sugar levels. Other: Jaundice (simulating obstructive); altered liver function; weight gain or loss; perspiration; flushing; urinary frequency; drowsiness, dizziness, weakness and fatigue; headache; parotid swelling; alopecia. Withdrawal Symptoms: Though not indic- ative of addiction, abrupt cessation of treatment after prolonged therapy may produce nausea, headache and malaise. Dosage and Administration: Lower dos- ages are recommended for elderly pa- tients and adolescents. Lower dosages are also recommended for outpatients as compared to hospitalized patients who will be under close supervision. Dosage should be initiated with Tofranil, brand of imipramine hydrochloride, at a low level and increased gradually, noting care- fully the clinical response and any evi- dence of intolerance. Following remission, maintenance medication may be required for a longer period of time, at the lowest dose that will maintain remission. Once-a-day maintenance dosage can be provided with Tofranil-PM, brand of imipramine pamoate, capsules if this dosage has been established as explained above. This dose may be given at bed- time. For the occasional patient who manifests stimulation and insomnia with this dosage regimen, the capsules may be given in the morning. Parenteral administration should be used only for starting therapy in patients un- able or unwilling to use oral medication. The oral form should supplant the inject- able as soon as possible. How Supplied: Tofranil, brand of imipra- mine hydrochloride: Round tablets of 25 and 50 mg.; triangular tablets of 10 mg.; and ampuls, each containing 25 mg. in 2 cc. for I.M. administration. Tofranil-PM, brand of imipramine pamoate: Capsules of 75, 100, 125 and 150 mg. (Each capsule contains imipramine pamo- ate equivalent to 75, 100, 125 or 150 mg. of imipramine hydrochloride.)

V\\.f}\\ Bioequivalence the weight of scientific opinion: Are drug products equally safe and effective simply because the chemical content is the same? Definitely not, unless bio- equivalence tests and other quality assurance checks have been con- ducted. The pharmaceutical in- dustry and many scientists have maintained this position for years, but others have questioned it. Now the Office of Technology Assessment of the Congress of the United States has reported on the issue in its Drug Bioequivalence Study.* Here are a few definitive statements in the O.T.A. report: \"... the problem of bioin- equivalency in chemically equiva- lent products is a real one. Since the studies in which lack of bio- equivalence was demonstrated involved marketed products that met current compendial stand- ards, these documented instances constitute unequivocal evidence that neither the present standards for testing the finished product nor the specifications for mate- rials, manufacturing process, and controls are adequate to ensure that ostensibly equivalent drug products are, in fact, equivalent in bioavailability. \"While these therapeutic failures resulting from problems of bioavailability were recognized and well documented, it is entirely possible that other therapeutic failures and /or instances of tox- icity that had a similar basis have escaped attention.\" The Pharmaceutical Manu- facturers Association supports DRUG BJOEQUIVALENCE federal legislative amendments that would require manufacturers of duplicate prescription pharma- ceutical products, subject to new drug procedures, to document: (a) chemical equivalence; and (b) biological equivalence, where bioavailability test methods have been validated as a reliable means of assuring clinical equivalence; or (c) where such validation is not possible, therapeutic equivalence. In addition, the PMA sup- ports federal legislation that would require certification of all manufacturers of prescription products before they could start in business, annual inspections and certification thereafter, and strict adherence to FDA regula- tions on good manufacturing practices. The overall quality of the United States drug supply is ex- cellent. But only a total quality assurance program, envisaged in these and other policy positions adopted by the PMA Board of Directors in 1974, can bring about acceptable levels of performance by all prescription drug manufac- turers and thereby assure the in- tegrity of the prescriptions you dispense...

Neu£ 26 The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy QUESTIONS BOARD \"TESTING\" OF EXAM APPLICANTS North Carolina Board of Pharmacy Orange Savings and Loan Bldg. 101 E. Rosemary Street Chapel Hill, N. C. 27514 An Open Letter to the Board Members: Gentlemen: Recently, we accepted with deep regret the resignation of a graduate pharmacist from the University of North Carolina School of Phar- macy, because the pharmacist had failed to pass the State Board Examinations and the pharmacist felt that because the Board was so \"made-up\" of primarily community oriented pharmacists, then they would never be able to pass the Boards until they accepted employ- ment in a community pharmacy . . . having to take a considerable reduction in order to, hope- fully pass the Boards at the next opportunity. Let me make this observation: this is the 31st anniversary of my professional career (the School of Pharmacy hierarchy, presently will not agree — they have in the past) but I have served as preceptor for a number of fine young pharmacy externs and interns, who have gone on to do a fine job in the profession, and I've been proud to have had the privilege of working with these wonderful people; but none of those students and interns have shown the competency that this most recent pharma- cist showed while with us here at Annie Penn Memorial since last January. It therefore, be- came a real problem for me, in my own mind, how a pharmacist with the skills and the ex- pertise and the forte and the personality could possibly fail a State Board examination follow- ing 5 years in the only, but best School of Pharmacy in the State of North Carolina! This resulted in Annie Penn Memorial losing one of the best potential pharmacists in the State, in our opinion. We felt that justice would not be served if we did not do at least a degree of investigation into other States — our findings were astonish- ing! No Southeastern Regional State has had more than a 15% failure rate, can you believe that! When the Boards sat in August in excess of 175 applicants stood the Board's exams; 69 were deemed qualified; 69? 38.3% passed in North Carolina; this means that 61.7% FAILED. Gentlemen, we have a problem; a very serious problem and I fear one of our own making. As of November 22nd Annie Penn Memorial will have two pharmacists positions open; to date we have exhausted our files and refer- ences of applicants — we do not believe in tacitly performing the functions of pharmacy services in our hospital; we take them seri- ously; we cannot continue legally performing our programmed functions after November 22nd; we cannot cut-back on our services — the patients are paying for these services. In view of the enormity of the situation, I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Gover- nor, to each member of the Board and to the North Carolina Pharmaceutical Association, asking the N.C.Ph.A. to publish it in the next issue of the Journal. Finally, it is my consi- dered thought and opinion that we are not \"testing\" Board applicants on competency; and therein lies our failure. Joseph C.

CHARLOTTE KERNERSVILLE FAYETTEVILLE WILMINGTON RALEIGH DURHAM If You Don't Know Photofinishing Know Your Photofinisher The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy 27 RESPONSE Mr. Joseph C. Estes, Jr. Annie Penn Memorial Hospital, Inc. Reidsville, North Carolina 27320 Dear Joe: I have received your open letter to the mem- bers of the Board relative to the examination results The Board of Pharmacy is, of course, concerned with any failure on the examina- tions. I am afraid, however, that the figures on which you base your conclusions are totally inaccurate. Before his untimely death, Dean Blaug made a detailed analysis of the results of our last examination and a copy of his report is enclosed along with certain comments which he made about the examinations. As you will note, Dean Blaug found that 83% of the graduates of UNC who were eligible for license passed the examination as opposed to 62% failing the exams as you state. Further, your figures relative to the failure rate in the Southeast do not coincide with those which we have recently received from the Boards in eleven (11) southeastern states. In constructing an examination for license, the Board attempts to develop an examination that tests practice competence as opposed to cognitive skills. When a student is graduated from a College of Pharmacy, his diploma is accepted as testimony of his educational at- tainments. What the Board wishes to learn is whether or not this individual can use that which he has learned in school in terms of practice and can surround this practice with the requisite safeguards to protect the public health and safety. Thus, the contents and techniques employed in a test for practice competence would be different from a test used in a course in school, for example. The fact that an individual has been graduated from a Col- lege of Pharmacy is no assurance in itself that he can adequately fulfill the requirements of practice. I think this statement is borne out by the fact that following the March examina- tions, approximately fifty (50) practicing pharmacists volunteered to take this same ex- amination as the candidates for license. On the average, these pharmacists outscored the stu- dents in all areas except a rather highly tech- nical math exam and in jurisprudence. On these two subjects the scores of the candidates and the pharmacists were aboat the same. This seems to indicate to us that the Board examinations are doing exactly what they are designed to do and that is to test for practice competence. In our survey of the southeastern states mentioned above, we learned that one state \"curves\" the examination results so that 96% of all candidates taking the examination pass. This is a matter of great concern to our Board in matters of reciprocity since the Board ex- aminations given in that state are almost meaningless. The North Carolina Board at- tempts to measure the candidate's fitness to practice against the examination and not against the scores made by other candidates taking the examination. In reviewing the results of the last examina- tion, it should be noted that 35 of the candi- dates who failed the examination had failed previously one or more times (several candi- dates as many as six times). We have ex- amined the scholastic record of all of these candidates and find that a surprisingly large number have a grade point average of 2.00 which is the minimum for graduation and would thus indicate that they are weak stu- dents to begin with. As Dean Blaug stated, there are some exceptions, but the Board's findings correspond with his. The Board of Pharmacy believes that it has a responsibility to the public to certify only those candidates for license which in the Board's judgment are competent and safe to practice, irrespective of the pressures that might be brought to do otherwise. The examination questions of the last two examinations given by the Board are pres- ently being reviewed by the Committee on Ex- aminations of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy with the view of using our examination in lieu of the present Blue Ribbon examination prepared by the NABP and which is used by about three-fourths of the Boards of Pharmacy in the country. So that you might get a better first-hand knowledge of the examinations and the candi- dates' performance on them, I would invite you to visit the office of the Board and review the examination questions as well as the exten- sive analyses that have been made of the re- sults which have been interpreted objectively so as to avoid bias and emotionalism in certify- ing practice competence.

RAMSEY MANUFACTURING CORPORATION Suite 103, Cameron-Brown Building 301 South McDowell Street CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA 28204 Telephone (704) 334-3457 The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy 29 DEAN SEYMOUR BLAUG On November 19, 1975, our school suffered an ultimate tragedy with the death of a great man, our Dean, Seymour M. Blaug, the impact of whose death will affect the lives of innumer- able people. In August of 1974, he entered the halls of the UNC School of Pharmacy. A stranger herald- ing from the University of Iowa, he took office as the new Dean of our school. An unfamiliar face at first, he quickly made a place for him- self in the hearts and lives of each and every individual he came in contact with. And he soon became one of the most admired, loved, and respected individuals ever to come into this school. Dean Blaug's involvement with our school was not in the form of a typical eight hour work day. His work was a twenty four hour com- mitment for him, with his involvement in stu- dent, faculty, and professional affairs. More than anyone probably realizes, Dean Blaug's life was totally devoted to working for the good of pharmacy. And as a result of this devotion, he was praised by students, faculty, and practitioners — here and all over the country. His unfailing interest in student affairs led to his wholehearted support, guidance, and participation in student activities. He stood behind Student Branches in all of its many activities. He attended the meetings, helped in money raising efforts, offered opinions, and acted as both a liaison between the students and faculty and as an outlet for them to air complaints. He assisted at all meetings concerned with Student affairs. He worked closely with the curriculum committee to upgrade the quality of our courses. He fought for the addition of the Pharm D program here at our school. He was very concerned about the State Board and was doing his best not only to modify the board to make it a representative test of what we should know as professionals, but also to al- leviate the students fear of the exam itself. He created the system of individual advisors for each student, so that each person would have a one-to-one relationship with a faculty member to help him with his selection of courses and with other problems he might have. At a moments notice he vould prepare presentations for various courses, always striving to add to and upgrade the quality of our education. He worked very closely with the members of the externship notebook commit- tee. His ideas for the improvement of the notebook exemplified his attitude about our education in general. He felt that we all de- serve to get something out of our education if we work for it, and that we should get a well rounded education as the basis for this, and he felt that a really good notebook was a defini- tive part of the educational process. He was a unifying force for the faculty in the midst of divisions and differences among de- partments, he reinstated confidence and hope when morales were at their lowest, and he always offered satisfaction and encourage- ment when students just didn't know which way to turn. His attitudes and his ideas, cou- pled with his amazing modesty and humility, created a new sense of unity here where there had only been confusion and disagreement. But this was only a beginning. Not only did he work for the students, but for the faculty as well. He felt that if he could do anything for them at all, no matter how small, that it was well worth his time, and they viewed him the same way the students did; he was fair . . . understanding . . . friendly . . . likeable . . . uncanny at making decisions . . . and most of all a very modest and humble man. In the words of our Assistant Dean, \"The guy was a beautiful man.\" Putting into words how we feel about a man who viewed fairness for all concerned as a primary goal, who did his level best to under- stand all sides of every dispute, whose door was always open no matter how busy he was, would be impossible for any of us to attempt. What can be said about a man with his unique qualities? Words cannot sum up the total man — this man who gave his whole life for pharmacy. Dean Blaug could never be replaced. People who talked with him — who asked him for advice — will never forget how he would look you in the eye — bob his head and say yes — no matter what their problem was. His accom- plishments will be the beginning of new things for our Pharmacy School. But most of all, WE will always remember Dean Blaug— because HE CARED.

Drugs, cash and watches valued at more than $500 were taken. GASTON I A Akers Center Pharmacy — After breaking a hole through a concrete block wall, thieves entered the pharmacy and removed a large quantity of drugs and some cash. YANCEYVILLE Yanceyville Drug Company — Police ar- rested a Charlotte man for an attempted break-in at the pharmacy. Thomas Peete Davis made a post-midnight stop at the phar- macy and was alerted by noise originating at a side-wall; police were called and arrested the man who had partially opened an entrance into the pharmacy. NORTH WILKESBORO Red Cross Pharmacy — A large quantity of drugs was taken in a break-in at the phar- macy. Two 15 gallon garbage cans were filled with drugs but one of the cans was left behind in what police surmized was due to hastly de- parture of the night visitors. DUBLIN Dublin Drug Company — On their first un- invited night visit by way of the pharmacy's roof, an unknown party or parties made off with merchandise valued at $1000. In the meantime, the pharmacy owner, Gene Brown, had installed an alarm system (light beam) in the prescription department which proved its worth on November 5 in preventing a second robbery but not another hole in the roof. DUNN Hospital Pharmacy — Drugs and $200 cash taken in a break-in. Entrance was by way of a side door which was smashed. GASTONIA Revco Drug Store, Grant City Center — After deactivating the store's alarm and then sledge-hammering their way thru a concrete wall, burglars made off with more than $1,000 in merchandise, including the store's safe. NEWTON GROVE Newton Grove Drug Company — Thieves cut a hole in the roof of the drug company and escaped with $4,000 worth of merchandise. FAYETTEVILLE Medicine Shoppe, 638 Person Street — Forty bottles of CS drugs were taken from the phar- macy following a break-in. ASHEVILLE Eckerd Drug Store, Tunnel Road Shopping Center — Someone shot a hole in a 5 x 8 foot plate glass window and 14 holes in the sign on the front of the building. The loss: $400.00. HIGH POINT Elder Drug — Police arrested a man follow- ing holdup of the pharmacy. Recovered: $168 and a pistol. COOLEEMEE Cooleemee Drug Company — Burglars cut a hole in the roof to gain entrance to the phar- macy, then remoeed CS drugs and $300 in cash. The thieves failed in an attempt to open the pharmacy's safe. Water which poured thru the hole in roof damaged some of the pharmacy's merchandise. The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy 31 PITTSBORO McCrimmon's Drug Store — Another roof job. Drugs valued at $2,000 taken from the pharmacy in a mid-November robbery. LINCOLNTON Revco Drug Store— Two burglars cut their way through the roof of the pharmacy, by- passed two alarm systems, then took posses- sion of a large quantity of drugs and a safe. GLEN ALPINE Clinic Drug Store — One of two men who was charged with armed robbery of the pharmacy on July 18, Johnny Levi Miller Jr. of McDowell County, received a 12 to 15 years sentence. RAEFORD Hoke Drug Company — James T. Corum of Fayetteville has been arrested and charged with the November 4 break-in at the phar- macy. More than $700 in drugs and syringes were taken. PITTSBORO McCrimmon Drug Company — For the sec- ond time in three weeks, the pharmacy was robbed of five watches, Demerol, Morphine, Preludin and Quaalude. Entrance was the same as first break-in — by a hole in the roof. GREENSBORO Doggett's Pharmacy (Summerfield) — Two Greensboro men were arrested and charged with a roof-top break-in at the pharmacy. One of the men was captured on the rooftop; the other was found inside the pharmacy with a pillow case filled with drugs. LEXINGTON Revco Discount Drug Center — Loss of ap- proximately $5,000 in cash and drugs in mid- December. A gunman forced four employees to remain face down on the floor while a fifth employee gave the bandit drugs he requested by name from the Rx department. The man filled a large garbage bag with barbiturates and amphetamines. The gunman entered the store shortly before 9 p.m. and as employees began to turn off lights he pulled a pistol and ordered one em- ployee to lock the front door. After taking the cash and drugs, he ordered the door unlocked and fled while employees were on the floor. PILOT MOUNTAIN Surry Drug Company — A large number of watches and jewelry taken in a break-in. GREENVILLE Big Value Drugs — More than $600 in cash and a quantity of drugs were taken during an armed robbery of the drug firm.

Hager, Chairman Present: Jesse M. Pike, Claude V. Timber- lake, George P. Hager (Chairman), and W. J. Smith (Executive Director, NCPhA). Seymour Holt was unable to attend but he had met with Mr. Smith and Chrmn. Hager in advance (Oc- tober 10) when agenda was planned and dis- cussed briefly. Maximum Allowable Cost Update — There is much opposition to the MAC regulations promulgated (over much opposition) by Cas- par Weinberger when, until recently, Secre- tary o#DHEW. Four suits have been filed against the MAC regulations: AMA, PMA, Association of County Medical Societies, and (October 31) by Kenwood Laboratories, Inc. (a \"small\" regional drug manufacturer). Mr. Timberlake pointed out, however, that the new Secretary of DHEW (Matthews) has the power to withdraw the MAC regs promulgated by his predecessor (Weinberger). An an- nouncement of action that would resolve this controversy is expected in the immediate fu- ture. Any further deliberation by the Committee on this issue should be deferred until results of a meeting of PMA representa- tives with DHEW Secretary Matthews are known. In any case, implementation of the MAC regs would be delayed considerably by the four cases now pending. Gosselin and Campbell have projected an unfavorable im- pact of MAC on CHAMPUS. Robinson-Patman Act (Rx Price Differentials — Product Selection) — A \"State- ment of the National Association of Retail Druggists\" of the NARD position on the Robinson-Patman Act was made before the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on antitrust, the Robinson-Patman Act and Related Matters (House Committee on Small Business), on November 6, 1975 by William E. Woods, to wit, \"NARD and its members vigorously support the American free enterprise system and strongly endorse the Robinson-Patman Act (and) oppose repeal of the Act.\" A letter expressing the Committee's en- dorsement (hopefully also that of the officers of the Association) of the NARD position and statement will be sent by Mr. Smith to Presi- dent Gerald Ford with copies to Mr. Roderick M. Hills (White House Staff), the House Com- mittee on Small Business and the N. C. Con- gressional Delegation. The Committee took above action after dis- cussing at length the seriously adverse effects of RP would have on all small businesses in this nation as epitomized in this country's community pharmacists.

Call or write the NCPhA, Box 151, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27514 34 The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy NATIONAL PHARMACY LEGISLATION the pharmacy profession with respect not to the profession's welfare alone but especially to the need and expectations of the health and medical care-consuming public with the wel- fare of which the welfare of the pharmacy pro- fession is intimately fused. Differential pricing is one of the most divi- sive issues in pharmacy (profession and indus- try). Experience to-date has indicated the effi- cacy of the profession's leaders (NARD) deal- ing with pharmaceutical manufacturing com- panies individually. The Committee con- curred that the NARD's dialogue with individual pharmaceutical manufacturers should be endorsed by the Association and that the NARD should now be notified of this. The Committee concurred in the resolution (728, Aug. 15, 1975) of the Veterans of Foreign Wars pertaining to \"Quality Assurance of Pre- scription Drugs\" (Add II). The same concerns respecting quality assurance not only of drug products but, as well, of all pharmaceutical services indispensable for safe and effective use of drug products must be advocated in the interest of the consumer as strongly as possi- ble by the pharmacy profession. The VFW and the American Legion are large consumer groups with whom communications should now be established and with whom concerted actions should be taken in the profession's ef- forts to assure consumers high quality phar- maceutical services (including high quality pharmaceutical products). Mailing of prescribed medication to patients by the Veterans Administration is a matter of immediate concern common to the profession, the VFW, and the A.L. Mr. Holt is requested to assist in starting appropriate dialogue with the Director and other leaders of the American Legion. Mr. Timberlake is requested to work toward same objective with the VFW, through Mr. Fred Van Rembow. Mr. Timberlake will also provide the Committee with a copy of the list of VFW adjutants in each state. The Committee concurred also in conviction that the medical care consumer's best in- terests are of necessity compromised — almost certainly subordinated to a personal profit motive — in the AARP and other mail order operations. The profession should deal with these also (Common Cause — ?, President's Consumer Advisory Staff — ?, etc.). Pharmacy's serious lack of any basis for con- certed political action is a major factor mitigating against pharmacy's best efforts in the medical care consumer's best interests. Pharmacy has no \"political clout.\" Mr. Smith suggested that one or two key pharmacists in each Congressional District be identified as switching points for communication and dis- seminating information needed in promotion of better pharmaceutical services and better pharmacy. Mr. George Scharringhausen (Park Ridge, Illinois) is a central figure in an NARD communication's system. COPES was mentioned as one possible organizational base, but the Committee, expressing some concern about the viability of a communica- tion system so-based, requested Mr. Pike to discuss the matter with NARD leaders. Health Manpower Legislation — A 5-point summary of the position of the American As- sociation of College of Pharmacy (Nov. 3, 1975, Christopher A. Rodawskas, Jr., Executive Di- rector) was distributed (Addendum III) as was a four-part resolution prepared for the Committee by G. P. Hager ( Addendum IV). The Committee concurred in the resolution and in- structed the Chairman to send it to the Senate Health Subcommittee (Senator Kennedy) with copies to N. C. Congressional Delegation, AACP (Executive Director Rodowskas), and NCPhA (Executive Director W. J. Smith). Federal Trade Commission Regarding Rx Price Disclosures — The FTC has scheduled hearings on a rule concerning disclosing retail prices: Dec. 1, 1975—10:00 AM, John C. Kluc- zynski Federal Building, Room 347 A and B, 230 S. Dearborn Street, Chicago Dec. 15, 1975—10:00 AM, The Federal Building, Room 12138, 430 Golden Gate Avenue, San Francisco, Califor- nia Jan 12, 1976—10:00 AM, Federal Trade Commission, Room 332, 6th and Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, DC The FTC regulations constitute an attempt by the Federal agency to preempt regulations operation at state level. Although advertising prescriptions could legally take place in N. C. this really is not happening. The FTC seems to be concerned that some type of coercion (e.g. The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy 35 For ninety years . . since 1885 seemcin OF DURHAM Has been producing good printing, and with prompt- ness. Machines and tech- niques in printing have changed but the inherent quality is maintained. We are proud of our long association with North Car- olina druggists through The Carolina Journal of Phar- macy and its editors. The Journal is now in its fifty- fourth volume, and the first printed copy was \"Seeman Printed.\" W A DIVISION OF FI6HER-HARRIS0N CORP. enforcement of code of ethics) is constraining prescription drug advertising. Even chain store executives' statements show that this is not the case. Mr. Timberlake will supply the Committee members with copies of \"Prescription Drug Price Disclosures\" a staff report of the FTC. Granting that the present situation in N. C. does not call for vigorous action at this time, the Committee should be alert with respect to any future advertising practices. Further- more, the N. C. Association of the Profession (B. Cade Brooks, President) should be alerted to any interference by a Federal agency (such as the FTC) in the State's affairs (including prescription price disclosures/advertisements) and should be ready to take action as occasions arise. It would also be appropriate for the NCPhA to submit a statement to the FTC hearings on Prescription Price Disclosures (see above). Mr. Smith will promote a joint statement with the Southeastern Pharmaceutical Association Executives. An expression of appreciation is appropriate to the N. C. Board of Pharmacy for its work in regard to advertising of professional services. Federal Drug Crime Legislation— Model State Act— Drug crimes (including, for exam- ple, forging of prescriptions and burglarizing of drug store drug stocks) is on the increase and no relief is in sight. A substantial effort has been made by the NARD but little prog- ress has been realized. The NARD is encoun- tering cooperative attitudes in the phar- maceutical industry. Every company that has been approached individually has committed itself to aid in the case for a Federal role in drug crime management. The NABP has withheld support on the basis that this would simply be another instance of Federal inter- ference in the practice of pharmacy. It is clear however that state statutes are ineffective in combatting the problem, and cases are usually dismissed as the criminals are placed on pro- bation. Many bills are being prepared at the Federal level. Hopefully, there will be agree- ment on one of these— the bill being supported by the NARD. N. C. is sending a monthly re- port to the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and Mr. Smith has recommended that Del Konner of the DEA prepare a model state act similar perhaps to acts that have been passed recently in Ohio and in Louisiana. Members of 36 The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy NATIONAL PHARMACY LEGISLATION the Committee stated that strong sanctions against drug crimes and criminals are essen- tial. At the root of many drug crimes is the lack of authentication of legitimate prescription drug transactions. Possibly a vigorous state-wide inter- and intraprofessional relations cam- paign should be promoted so that, in handling prescriptions, the pharmacist would be strongly urged to \"know the prescriber\" \"know the patient and prescriber's inten- tions\" \"be sure the patient is kept aware of and complies with the prescriber's intentions especially as these undergo changes.\" Maybe we should be asking it it is not equally (perhaps more) important for the pharmacist, as a health professional, to assure himself of the authenticity of a prescription he is filling than a check he is accepting or cash- ing. Cost of Dispensing a Rx (HEW Re- quirement)— Regardless of the disposition of the MAC regulations, a study should be made of the cost of dispensing prescribed medications. Dr. Jean Gagnon, a new member of the faculty of the School of Pharmacy, has submitted a proposal for a study ($15,000.00 budget) to an agency of the State of North Carolina. Perhaps support for the study should also be sought from the Small Business Ad- ministration, or from PAID Prescriptions, Better Business Bureau. Reference was made to a study in Kentucky (Medicaid), to a study conducted by NARD, and to a survey by Eli Lilly and Company. FDA Policy Regarding Clinical Investiga- tion of New Drugs — The PMA \"Policy on Clini- cal Research\" had been distributed in advance to members of the Committee. The Committee recommends that a special committee of the NCPhA be appointed to study the PMA state- ment and to recommend action by the Associa- tion. Malpractice/Professional Liability In- surance-Trends— Mr. Pike recommended the appointment of a standing committee of the NCPhA to deal with this subject on behalf of N. C. pharmacists (recognizing that insur- ance coverage must be updated from time-to- time). A one-day program on liability insurance held in Cleveland in August may be a pattern for a program that should be arranged in N. C. (Mr. Timberlake will supply the program of the Cleveland meeting). The Marketing Committee of the PMA should be asked to arrange for manufacturers to supply statements with respect to their liabilities in connection with the pharmacy practitioner's need for protection by the man- ufacturer with regard to their products dis- pensed by him. A superb \"Soup/Salad Lunch\" was a very fitting capstone for a successful meeting and the Committee is grateful to Mrs. W. J. Smith for preparing it. OFFICERS INSTALLED BY CAPE FEAR At the November 18 meeting, members of the Cape Fear Pharmaceutical Society re- elected Ms. Ellon Martin as president for the upcoming year. Serving with Ms. Martin will be current officers Al Pittman, vice-president; Betty Revie, secretary; and Hunter Smith as treasurer. The new county representatives that were selected are Warren Elkins, Cumberland; Eddie Malion, Robeson; and W. A. West, Sampson County. The guest speaker at the meeting was Mr. Bill Randall, member of the N. C. Board of Pharmacy. Mr. Randall discussed current pending legislative activities of interest to pharmacy, recent malpractice suits, activities of the Board, and Board Examinations. The members voted to contribute $ 100 to the UNC Consolidated Loan Fund in memory of their late president, Leon Tomlinson. SK&F ASSIGNS REAMES TO RALEIGH TERRITORY Frederick V. Reames has been assigned to the Raleigh, North Carolina, territory as a Professional Sales Representative for Smith Kline & French Laboratories, the phar- maceutical division of SmithKline Corpora- tion. Mr. Reames graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1972 with a Bachelor's degree in history. Before joining SK&F, he was a sales representative for E. R. Squibb & Sons. The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy 37 JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S ANTITRUST ACTION SURPRISES' APhA APhA has expressed surprise that the United States Justice Department has filed an antitrust suit against APhA and the Michigan Pharmaceutical Association, an action which attacks a provision of the APhA Code of Ethics. APhA had initiated action in July of this year to revise the provision and any possible legal objection to it. The complaint filed November 24 in the U. S. District Court in Grand Rapids, Michigan, contends that Section 8 of the APhA Code of Ethics— which has also been adopted by the Michigan Pharmaceutical Asso- ciation—encourages anti-competitive prac- tices and therefore violates Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Section 8 reads as fol- lows: . . \"A pharmacist should not solicit profes- sional practice by means of advertising or by methods inconsistent with his opportunity to advance his professional reputation through services to patients and to society.\" APhA has always regarded this section of the Code of Ethics as a lawful standard and denies that APhA has ever engaged in any conspiracy to fix prices or violate any section of the antitrust laws. In any event, APhA executive director Dr. William S. Apple pointed out that the APhA Board of Trustees voted at its July 16-17 meet- ing to seek membership approval for the fol- lowing revision of Section 8: \"A pharmacist should strive to provide in- formation to patients regarding profes- sional services truthfully, accurately and fully, and should avoid misleading patients regarding the nature, cost or value of phar- maceutical services.\" As APhA said November 21 in its formal response to a Federal Trade Commission in- vestigation of prescription drug price disclos- ure, the Association has always held that pharmacists have a professional obligation to provide patients with total information on the cost of both prescription drugs and phar- maceutical service. \"The profession of pharmacy has nothing to hide,\" said Apple. \"We invite public scrutiny and believe our record of honesty and fairness with the public and both state and federal gov- ernments is second to none. Consequently, it surprises us that the Justice Department has chosen to file a complaint which alleges prac- tices we have never condoned and in fact have fought against for many years.\" \"We want what the Justice Department wants— a free and open marketplace,\" con- cluded Apple, \"and we believe our actions in the past have documented our dedication to the principle of free enterprise. Nothing in the Justice Department complaint filed November 24 convinces us otherwise.\" BANKRUPT PHARMACY FIXTURES SOLD The fixtures of Fisher's Pharmacy, Elkin, (for many years operated as Abernathy's Pharmacy) have been auctioned off in a bank- ruptcy sale. The pharmacy closed in September when Paul Fisher, president of the corporation, filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Fisher and his wife, Elizabeth, have also filed for personal bankruptcy, listing assets of $116,132 and liabilities of $193,782.06. Documents filed with the clerk of the U. S. Middle District Court in Greensboro show the pharmacy with assets of $42,674.90 and liabilities of $111,301.59. Creditors include Justice Drug Company, Scott Drug Company, Grant Key, Northwest- ern Bank of Elkin, Community Press of Winston-Salem, Surry County and the Town of Elkin (property taxes). The pharmacy listed its assets as its fixtures $17,750; inventory $10,000; accounts receiva- ble $14,774.90; and cash on hand, $150.00. 38 The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy UNC PHARMACY SCHOOL NOTES STUDENT BRANCHES OF THE NCPhA/APhA Reported by June Hall The Student Branches of the American Pharmaceutical Association and the North Carolina Pharmaceutical Association has begun its best year yet. The Membership drive in September and October brought in an all time high of 300 members. This is a 66% in- crease over last year's 180 members and rep- resents over 50% of the student body. State membership began in the fall and the National membership starts in January at which times the members should begin receiving their Journals. With increased membership has come in- creased activity. We have had four programs this semester. They include: 1) \"VD Blues\" — a film narrated by Dick Cavett providing educa- tion on venereal disease in an entertaining way; 2) Seymour Holt, Vice President of Dista Labs, speaking on manufacturing and MAC; 3) Dr. Mark Novich, the Assistant Deputy of the FDA spoke on MAC; and 4) Ben Bailey from Upjohn spoke on Prostaglandins. Many thanks go to these speakers and to the professors for scheduling no tests on Thurs- days so that students can participate in these programs. Activities really began this year with an introduction of the faculty and student organi- zations to all new and interested students. Several days later, a fall picnic, sponsored by all the pharmacy school organizations proved to be a greater success than was expected. Diabetes week followed this. Faye Crawford and Ben Lemberg began the week by riding in the Bike-A-Thon. Their efforts and the con- tributions of their sponsors brought in over $300.00 for the diabetes association. On November 12, 13 and 14, SAPhA and the Orange County Health Department cospon- sored a diabetes screening clinic at University Mall. During the three nights of the clinic, we tested 200 shoppers by blood samples for dia- betes and answered the many questions which were posed. Also helping us were dietitians from NCMH and members of the clinical staff from the school. SAPhA members donated a lot of time and work to this project and it is not stopping here. With over 100,000 undiscovered cases of dia- betes mellitis in North Carolina today, we feel that a continuation of this public educa- tion and screening is important. We will speak with any interested group or organization as well as carry our clinic to other towns and cities. Hopefully, we will soon have similar groups pertaining to hypertension and Vene- real Disease. Jennifer Stancil, the Executive Committee Member, has again been working with the Intern/Extern notebook. With the help of her subcommittees and several professors, a re- vised notebook, containing more detail, new areas and answers, will be ready for us as we enter the working world for another summer. Janice Kuran, our Council of Students Rep- resentative, serves as a liaison between the student and the faculty and as a student member of the curriculum committee. This is a reason why she became actively involved dur- ing the problems in Physiology 93. Buddy Lingle, who is the president-elect of the Senate aided Janice. Both deserve thanks for their efforts. Our final major activity for this semester was the Regional SAPhA convention in Charleston, S. C. We were well represented by eight of our members including Billy Price, Ray Peedin, Janice Kuran, Jane Hall, Buddy Lingle, Ronald Carmichael and Gail Wiggins. Our other representative, Martha Mayo was elected as Alternate Delegate of the Region. She is responsible for all regional committees and acts as the regional delegate in his ab- sence. Next semester's plans are also big. There is Pharmacy Week, Poison Prevention Week, Hypertension Week and the National Conven- tion April 1-4 in New Orleans. Hopefully a large and active delegation will be able to at- tend this convention and we can begin to show other schools that Carolina is #1.

CHARLOTTE AUXILIARY Reported by Mrs. Charles Jarrett The Charlotte Woman's Pharmaceutical Auxiliary met on December 9th for their An- nual Christmas Bazaar and luncheon with Mrs. Don Smith presiding. Mrs. Leslie Barn- hardt gave the devotional and Mrs. Perry Hawkins and Mrs. Bruce Medlin decorated the tables and place cards with a Christmas theme. After a brief business session a drawing was held for an afghan made by Mrs. Ralph Smith. The net gain from the sale of chances on the afghan was $198.85 and Mrs. Don Smith was the winner. Hand-made items and baked goods donated by the members were auctioned by Mrs. Robert Lewis and Mrs. Charles Jarrett. The Auxiliary netted $269.50 from this yearly pro- ject. The members also prepared 75 potted plants, decorated with red satin ribbon, to be delivered to the Community Hospital and to six Mental Health Group Homes as part of the State Project. CHARLOTTE The November luncheon meeting of the Charlotte Woman's Pharmaceutical Auxiliary was held at the Y.W.C.A. with Mrs. Donald Smith presiding. Mrs. A. E. Galloway gave the devotional. A brief business meeting was held: — the December bazaar was discussed and members were reminded to bring items for sale and guests. — Mrs. Don Weather's attractive table decorations were sold with the proceeds going to the bazaar fund. — plans were presented for a workshop for planting live plants in clay pots for dis- tribution to \"Shut-ins\" in participation with the State's project \"Operation Flowerpot.\" — an invitation was issued to attend \"An Old Fashion Christmas\" for the De- cember meeting. Mrs. Don Weathers introduced the speaker, Miss Michelle Dezutto, Director of the Rape Crisis Center and member of the N. C. Rape Crisis Commission. Miss Dezutto outlined the objectives of the Center and ways in which it hopes to help people combat the problem of rape. 40 The Carolina Journal of Pharmacy CLASSIFIED ADVERTISING Classified advertising (single issue inser- tion) 10 cents a word with a minimum charge of $3.00 per insertion.

APPOINTMENTS OF NARD SUPPORT APPLIANCE EXAMINING BOARD ANNOUNCED In a bold move to assure the retail pharma- cists of an important role in the support ap- pliance field, the NARD Health Supports and Appliances Committee appointed their first examining board. This board will prepare and administer examinations for fitters of these supports and appliances in pharmacies. Members of the Board appointed by the Health Support and Appliance Committee and approved by the Executive Committee in Chicago are: Barbara Fitzpatrick — Chairwoman Roland Reagan Justin Eisele Lee Kirchner Paul Case Dr. Thomas Quigley Dr. Arthur Weaver Dr. Harry Swartz In commenting on this action, Paul Dumouchel, Chairman of the Health Supports and Appliances Committee said \"We expect this Board to meet at an early date to prepare an examination for pharmacists or other fit- ters. This is a growing field for pharmacists today and I think this program meets a real need of the profession. Many pharmacists have a real opportunity to become certified under the 'grandfather' clause early in 1976 and I trust they will take advantage of it.\" Pharmacists and their employees who meet the standards can be certified as an exception under the guidelines until May 1, 1976. Re- quirements include an attestation by two physicians of the individual's service in the area and a verification of education and ex- perience. Pharmacies can also achieve certifi- cation provided they have a private fitting room, sufficient inventory to serve the public and a certified fitter or certified associate fit- ter.
