Inc. in 1986 by a group of investors. Revco was the largest chain of discount drug stores in the U.S. at the time, operating over 2,000 stores. The buyout paid a 48% premium over Revco's stock price before the deal was announced. The buyout was controversial due to its high debt levels and declining operating performance in recent quarters for Revco. Analysts were skeptical about the company's ability to repay debt in the early years relying significantly on uncertain asset sales.",
