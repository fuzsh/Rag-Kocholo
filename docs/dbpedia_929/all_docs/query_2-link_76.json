This store is listed as being a Revco then a CVS before CVS built a new store outside of the shopping center in 2002.\n\t\n\tThe Hocking Mall was built in 1977. It was originally anchored by a Kroger grocery store and a Murphy's Mart discount store. This shopping center was never enclosed so it makes me wonder if an enclosed mall was originally planned here.
