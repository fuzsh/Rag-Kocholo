        "text": "This is possibly the only former Peoples Drug in existence that is still a drug store and has its original lighting, windows and entrances. Unfortunately the disco-tastic interior did not survive. :-) This store opened with the mall in 1974, became a Revco in 1993, then converted to CVS in 1997. I don't know of any other CVS stores in enclosed malls in Southwest Virginia, either.\n\n__________\n\nUniversity Mall is a shopping center in Blacksburg, Virginia adjacent to the Virginia Tech campus at the intersection of Prices Fork Road and University City Boulevard. Opened in 1974, the original enclosed mall contained about 250,000 square feet of retail space and was anchored by Woolco and Roanoke-based Heironimus, with Kroger on an outparcel across the street.\n\nDuring the 1970s and much of the 1980s, this was the hottest retail address in the New River Valley. The center featured a strong mix of regional and local tenants including Mills Fabric, Ritz Camera, H&M Shoes, John Norman (menswear), Sidney’s, The Sickle Moon, Dana (all three were women’s apparel stores), Printer’s Ink bookstore and Peoples Drug. Even Woolco’s closure in 1983 didn’t cripple the place; Roses quickly moved in to replace it.\n\nWhat did take this place down was the opening of the New River Valley Mall in neighboring Christansburg in 1988. Though the anchors stayed in place, the small shops inside the mall largely closed or moved.\n\nIn the early 1990s, both anchors folded and Virginia Tech took over their spaces for various university services and a branch of the University Bookstore. During this time, People Drug became Revco and then CVS and the mall interior slowly filled back in with various local businesses.\n\nIn 2004, the mall was sold to a group of local businessmen and plans were made to eventually donate the property to the Virginia Tech Foundation, the mall’s primary tenant. During this time, the interior of the mall received its only renovation. Its tile and concrete floors were carpeted. The globes of its pole lights were changed, and the mall was painted. Two large mobiles were placed over its pair of fountains, which have were thoroughly cleaned. On the exterior, the south end of the mall was expanded and heavily renovated with a parking garage and multistory office building added next to the intersection of Prices Fork Road and University City Boulevard, along with an outparcel for Panera Bread.\n\nThough the center is almost fully tenanted now, the interior mall remains a well-preserved relic of 1970s retail design. Many storefronts are still original and substantially all of the interior décor from 1974 is still here. Even the CVS is still here, largely unchanged from its days as a Peoples Drug.\n\nUniversity Mall is a shopping center in Blacksburg, Virginia adjacent to the Virginia Tech campus at the intersection of Prices Fork Road and University City Boulevard.

It originally opened alongside the rest of the shopping center in 1984 as a Revco Drug Store, and became a Reliable Drug Store around 1990 as some of Revco’s stores were sold to Reliable Drugs at the time as Revco was in the middle of bankruptcy. All of the Reliable Drug stores would be sold to Rite Aid in 1993, and this store became part of the Rite Aid chain the following year. Interesting to note, this was one of two former Revco/Reliable/Rite Aid stores in Hazard; the other was located next to a former A&P supermarket in the Grand Vue Plaza Shopping center (which would later close in 2002 and would later be a relocated Dollar General store within that same shopping center). It would be converted to a Walgreens in the spring of 2020, as part of a lengthy process that saw many of Rite Aid’s stores being acquired by Walgreens.\n\nI was originally planning on writing this blog post next weekend, but since the storms today kept me indoors (besides, you know, everything else that’s kept me indoors), I went ahead and knocked it out today. If you’re a fan of vintage retail surviving into the 21st century, then I think you’ll like this pharmacy in Columbus, MS! Please check out the post over at the Mid-South Retail Blog here.

Kirby & Company building at 904 Main Street in Lynchburg, Virginia has been home at various times to Woolworth, Strother Drug Company, Kresge, Revco Drug Store and CVS Drug Store. The brick structure has 3 levels--the ground floor (which has been altered) and two upper levels punctuated by the centrally located two-story oriel. This oriel almost functions as a tower with a slight domed roof capping the feature. Intricate terracotta embellishments of swags, festoons, and garlands are elaborately executed. The windows on the third level are arched with as are the windows in the oriel. Keystones on the oriel feature and on the arched windows have a vertical series of overlapping discs (I don't know the name of this architectural feature). On the underside of the oriel base are dentil and egg-and-dart decorations. The facade has four simulated columns in a quoin pattern; I don't know if this is for weight-bearing or for ornamentation.\n\nMain Street, Lynchburg, Virginia is included in the Court House Hill-Downtown Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places August 16, 2001, reference number 01000853.

There has also been a 3 screen theater (now owned my Carmike) in the mall since it opened. The mall also opened with a SuperX and a Sears corporate hardlines only store as junior anchors. Kmart closed here in 2002 and was replaced with Steve & Barry's in 2004. That store closed with the rest of the chain and in 2010 was replaced by Roses. SuperX became Revco and when Revco was bought by CVS they closed this location. Imterestingly enough Middlesboro is a town of about 12,000 people and has no presence of Walgreens, Rite Aid or CVS. That junior anchor spot was taken over by Dawahares untilbthat chain closed in 2008. Other stores at the mall in the past include KB Toys which closed with the chain ( where yours truly had his first real job!). Disc Jockey \\ fye ( closed in 2010), Cato, foot locker Claires (closed in 2014) and Aladdin's Castle were also Tennant's at different times. Today inline stores include hibbets, shoe show, Bookland ( closing in April ) Rue 21, factory connection and Dollar Tree."
