        "text": "Big B Drugs began operation in 1968 as part of Bruno's Supermarkets, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Most of its stores were located next to a Bruno's, Food World or FoodMax, all Bruno's owned stores. The company had close to $800 million in revenue by the end of 1996.\n\nIn 1982, Big B was spun-off from the Bruno's Supermarkets into an independent company, Big B Inc., based in Bessemer, AL, a suburb of Birmingham. In 1989, Big B acquired 85 Reed Drug Stores and Lee Drug Stores from Peoples Drug. The Reed stores were located in metro Atlanta, and north Georgia, while the Lee stores were located in Columbus, Georgia and eastern Alabama.\n\nIn 1996, Big B was acquired by Revco, and within a year Revco was acquired by CVS. By the end of 1997, all Big B Drugs and Revco were operating as CVS/pharmacy.\n\nSources"
