        "text": "Patrick Austin, J.D. | July 25, 2024\n\nGetting harassed by debt collectors such as Revco Solutionsis annoying, stressful, and upsetting. Why? Because debt collectors often use unethical and even illegal methods to try to persuade you to pay what they think you owe. That's why Revco Solutions may call you all day and even into the night. They may try to contact you on your Facebook and send you threatening letters in the mail.\n\nIf you find yourself in this situation, do not despair. You have legal rights and protections that can help you beat Revco Solutions in court.\n\nWhat is Revco Solutions?\n\nRevco Solutions is a debt collection agency doing business out of Columbus, Ohio. Its original name was Credit Bureau Collection Services (CBCS), but rebranded itself to Revco Solutions LLC in 2020.\n\nRevco Solutions focuses on debt collection for hospitals and physicians. The agency also engages in debt collection for public and private utility companies, government agencies, and retail and banking institutions. In fact, Revco Solutions has been collecting debts on behalf of government agencies for close to two decades.\n\nIf you need to reach a Revco collector, call them at the Revco Solutions phone number, which is listed below with the company’s other contact information:\n\nAddress:\n\n250 E Broad St Ste 400\n\nColumbus, OH 43215-3761\n\nPhone number: (855) 202-0113\n\nEmail: Mail@RevcoSolutions.com\n\nWebsite: https://revcosolutions.com\n\nIs Revco Solutions legit?\n\nYes, Revco Solutions is a real debt collection agency, not a scam. However, it is not accredited by the Better Business Bureau (BBB) and has a B rating.\n\nIf you are feeling angry towards Revco Solutions, you're not the only one. As of 2024, Revco Solutions has received dozens of complaints on its BBB profile over a three-year period. These complaints mention several violations of the FDCPA, and they demonstrate just how aggressive Revco Solutions can be when trying to collect on a debt.\n\nLet's take a look at a real example.\n\n“Revco Solutions, Inc. is attempting to collect a debt that I do not owe. I have never signed a contract nor have I ever received any monies from Revco Solutions, Inc. They continue to send intimidating letters with an attempt to collect money from me. I do not owe Revco any money nor do I ever intend to pay them any money for which I never received. I would like an apology for their negative tactics and have all negative information removed from all credit reporting agencies IMMEDIATELY! Furthermore, Revco should compensate me for loss of time to handle this matter and taking my important time with unwanted letters and telephonic calls.”\n\nRead Revco Solutions reviews\n\nGoogle reviews give Revco Solutions an average rating of 1.3 out of 5 stars. Most of these reviews complain about Revco Solutions debt collectors calling and asking for social security numbers or other personal information. Many people think it's a scam, but Revco is a real debt collector.\n\nHave a look at some real Revco Solutions reviews below:\n\nUnderstand your legal rights when Revco Solutions contacts you about a debt\n\nRevco Solutions is known to try to take advantage of people who do not know their rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. The FDCPA lays out many rules and regulations that restrict how debt collectors can contact and treat you. Some of these rules include the following:\n\nA debt collector may not call you before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m.\n\nA debt collector cannot use rude or vulgar language when they contact you.\n\nA debt collector is not allowed to threaten you with a debt collection lawsuit.\n\nA debt collector cannot call you at your workplace.\n\nRespond to a debt lawsuit against Revco Solutions\n\nIf Revco Solutions sues you for debts you allegedly owe, it is vital to respond to the lawsuit quickly and aggressively. Do not ignore the lawsuit and throw the notices in the trash. The lawsuit will always be there and even if you ignore it, it will not go away. Ignoring the suit means Revco Solutions wins by default. This gives them the right to garnish your wages and put liens on your property. Never make this mistake of ignoring a debt lawsuit—you can fight back!\n\nFollow these three steps to respond to a debt lawsuit against Revco solutions:\n\nRespond to each claim listed in the Complaint document. You can admit, deny, or deny due to a lack of knowledge. Most attorneys suggest that you deny as many allegations as possible. This makes Revco Solutions work harder because they have to gather all the necessary documentation to prove the debt is actually yours.\n\nAssert your affirmative defenses. These are legal reasons that Revco Solutions doesn't have a case against you. A common affirmative defense to raise in a debt collection lawsuit is the statute of limitations. If the debt is past the statute of limitations, then Revco has run out of time to sue you for the debt. If this is true, the case will be dismissed.\n\nFile the Answer with the court, and send a copy to Revco Solutions. Make sure to file before the deadline, which is 14-35 days, depending on which state you live. Make a copy to send to Revco Solutions via USPS-certified mail. You should also request a return receipt so you can prove that you properly sent the Answer to the opposing party.\n\nYou can learn more about these three steps in this video:\n\nNow, let's break down each step a little further.\n\n1. Respond to each claim listed in the Complaint document\n\nWhen you're sued for a debt, you should receive two court documents called the Summons and Complaint (also known as a Petition in some states). The Summons notifies you of the lawsuit, while the Complaint lists the specific claims being made against you.\n\nThe most important section of your Answer is the part where you respond to each claim listed in the Complaint. You can use one of the following responses:\n\nDeny (like saying, “Prove it.”)\n\nDeny due to lack of knowledge (like saying, “I don't know.”)\n\nAdmit (like saying, “This is true.”)\n\nMost attorneys advise denying as many claims as possible. This forces Revco Solutions to do more work to prove their case. If they don't have the proper documentation to prove their claims, they may choose to dismiss the case altogether.\n\nUse SoloSuit to create an Answer in just 15 minutes.\n\n2. Assert your affirmative defenses\n\nWhen you answer the debt collection lawsuit filed by Revco Solutions, you have a chance to highlight any problems with the allegations contained within the Complaint. As mentioned earlier, debt collectors are legally obligated to prove that you owe what they claim you owe. This means Revco Solutionsmust prove these things before you are legally responsible for the debt:\n\nThe debt collector is legally authorized to sue you.\n\nYou are the person who owes the debt.\n\nYou owe the amount noted by Revco Solutionsin the complaint filed with the court.\n\nIf Revco Solutions cannot prove the above points, there is a great chance that you can win in Court and even get the lawsuit tossed out.\n\nDepending on your case facts, you could argue that Revco Solutions did not file the suit within the statute of limitations timeline. The statute of limitations states the time that someone has to sue you. The debt collection company needs to file the suit within that time limit or they have no legal recourse.\n\nIf the case facts show that Revco Solutions sued you for something where the statute of limitations expired, you may file a motion to have the legal action dismissed with prejudice.\n\nThere are other things you can do to defeat Revco Solutions at their shady game. Think about filing a counterclaim if you possess evidence that Revco Solutionsdid something that violates the FDCPA. If you have such evidence, Revco Solutionsmay need to pay you damages as well as cover your legal fees.\n\nSoloSuit can help you make the right defense the right way.\n\n3. File the Answer with the court, and send a copy to Revco Solutions\n\nYou have 14-35 days to file your Answer in the court, depending on which state you live in. You can send your Answer in the mail, deliver it by hand to a court clerk, or even file online (only some courts offer this option).\n\nAfter you've filed the Answer, be sure to send a copy of it to Revco Solutions. The copy should be sent via USPS certified mail with a return receipt requested. This serves as documented proof that your Answer was properly delivered to the opposing party.\n\nSoloSuit can file your Answer for you in all 50 states.\n\nDoes Revco Solutions report to credit bureaus?\n\nYes, Revco Solutions reports defaulted debt accounts to the credit bureaus, just like any other debt collection agency. There are two ways you can remove Revco Solutions from your credit report:\n\nAsk them to validate your debt and dispute it. If you suspect that the debt reported to the credit bureaus is inaccurate, dispute it. Send a Debt Validation Letter to Revco Solutions to force them to prove that the debt is owed and real.\n\nPay Revco Solutions. If you know the debt is valid, set up a payment plan with Revco, discuss settlement options, or pay off the full amount on their portal. Keep reading to learn more.\n\nPay Revco Solutions\n\nIt’s easy to pay Revco Solutions because of their online payment portal where you can log on, review your current balance, choose a payment plan that works for your budget, and submit your payment online.\n\nIf you know you owe the debt, working with Revco Solutions to settle it might be in your best interest.
