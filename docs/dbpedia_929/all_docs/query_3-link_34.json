        "text": "Jack Eckerd Corp. plans to close or sell for an undisclosed sum 15 of 18 Oklahoma stores acquired in a 220-store package from Revco D.S. Inc., an Eckerd's spokesman said Tuesday.\n\nBut part of the deal involves selling six stores to Tulsa-based May's Drugstores Inc., a 25-store Oklahoma chain. Terms of the deal were not available. May's officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nNine Oklahoma Revco stores employing about 180 people will be permanently closed, with the remaining three converted to Eckerd's outlets. Eckerd's has pledged to offer 75 percent of the 180 Revco employees jobs elsewhere with Eckerd's. Relocation may be necessary in some cases, Eckerd's spokesman Gene Ormond said.\n\nThe Revco stores set to close include eight in metropolitan Oklahoma City. They are at 3639 NW 39 Expressway, 5730 S May Ave., 8015 Northwest Expressway, 1646 SW 89, 6000 NW 122 and 11717 S Western in Oklahoma City; 824 W 3 in Edmond; and a store in Norman. Shawnee's store will also be closed.\n\nThe closings are a function of inadequate performance or proximity to competing drugstores, including Eckerd's stores. The closings are expected, but not firm until complete inventories of those stores are taken in early August, Ormond said.\n\nThe three Oklahoma Revco stores due for conversion to Eckerd's locations are at 3400 S Boulevard in Edmond, plus one each in Ardmore and Chickasha.\n\nThe stores involved in the six-store package sale to May's are single stores in Ada, Stillwater, Guthrie and Cushing, plus two in Muskogee. May's is headed by Tulsa businessman Jerald Heller.\n\nSix Oklahoma Revco stores were not acquired by Eckerd's. They are in Altus, El Reno, Yukon, Hugo, Mustang and at 1327 E Danforth Road in Edmond. They remain for sale by the Revco bankruptcy estate, and if not sold, will be closed.\n\nEckerd's operates 1,575 drugstores in 13 states. The Florida-based chain announced the $60.5 million acquisition of the Revco stores in June. The affected stores are in Oklahoma, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Revco announced that the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Akron, Ohio, had extended to Aug. 31 the company's deadline for filing a reorganization plan.\n\nThe court also extended until Nov. 30 the deadline for Revco to gain acceptance of any plan it files.\n\nTwinsburg, Ohio-based Revco has been operating under Chapter 11 protection of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since July 28, 1988.
