        "text": "I love Inzy. Rate him higher than Younis. I think he was of a higher caliber. There can be millions of stats to tell x or y to me but I can't quantify such things. Having seen them both a fair bit, I feel more confident about Inzy's skill level.\n\nI do agree with Fusion that Inzamam was severely underrated. Isn't that far behind Dravid, really.\n\nFor me he is quite ahead of Dravid actually..the stats don't quite show it and I understand that why people will think differently but there is just far too many factors to consider here.\n\nDravid has only one century in Australia, as you mentioned, a 230 in Adelaide and we all know how flat Adelaide is..against Gillespie, Bichel, Brad Williams and MacGill..Macgill might be a decent bowler but his 2003 series was terrible..anyone who has seen that series should remember that he was bowling one full toss and one half tracker an over..\n\nThe main factor here is Dravid is associated with the famous 2001 test match which was undoubtedly a brilliant innings. However his overall record against Australia and South Africa aren't all that for someone who is supposed to have the best technique against pace bowling.\n\nInzamam on the other hand has a hundred in Australia against McGrath, Fleming and Warne in 99.\n\nHe has also not played against Australia at home since 1998.\n\nSo pretty much we have 3 test matches in 99 in Australia.\n\nThe 2004 series Inzamam was unfit and played only 1 game with an injury and got a pair if I am not mistaken.\n\nOverall the stats are still in Dravid's favour and I totally understand if most people rate him higher. Personally I find him a tad overrated, not to say he is crap or anything but I feel he is considered a tad greater than he was because of the Kolkata test match.\n\nPakistan on the other hand didn't really get to play Australia as much in the same period, and certainly not at home. Younis for example would have had at least 5 more centuries had Pakistan been playing regular test cricket like India or Australia in the last few years.\n\nInzamam of course had other problems, his poor fitness being a major issue and he has only himself to blame for that. This is where Younis scores over Inzy for me..despite not being as good in terms of ability, his work ethic, his fitness, his hard work is what allowed him to surpass players better than him.\n\nFor me he is quite ahead of Dravid actually..the stats don't quite show it and I understand that why people will think differently but there is just far too many factors to consider here.\n\nDravid has only one century in Australia, as you mentioned, a 230 in Adelaide and we all know how flat Adelaide is..against Gillespie, Bichel, Brad Williams and MacGill..Macgill might be a decent bowler but his 2003 series was terrible..anyone who has seen that series should remember that he was bowling one full toss and one half tracker an over..\n\nThe main factor here is Dravid is associated with the famous 2001 test match which was undoubtedly a brilliant innings.

Personally I find him a tad overrated, not to say he is crap or anything but I feel he is considered a tad greater than he was because of the Kolkata test match.\n\nI don't think saying Inzi>Dravid is ridiculous, but this was a pretty biased post imo. Saying Dravid's double at Adelaide came on a flat track against a not so great attack and thus discounting it in favour of a hundred from Inzi just because it came against McWarne is just silly. No matter what conditions Dravid faced that day, the team was 4 wickets down and 500 runs behind Australia in the first innings. There's just no way to knock down that innings. Dire circumstances and anything less than a double hundred from him and we would've lost. We also probably would've lost if he hadn't followed it up with 72 in the 4th innings. I'd take that over whatever Inzi did against McWarne thanks. There's also Perth 2008, which no one except me seems to remember.\n\nAnd if you're so intent on hundreds against great bowlers in the 90s, why do you ignore that Dravid got ne against Donald and Pollock while Inzi didn't? I'm not going to use that to say Dravid>inzi. Nor should you use Inzi's sole hundred against McGrath in Australia to say Inzi>Dravid.\n\nThen you make all these excuses for Inzi saying that he was injured, etc, which may all be true, but also consider that for some inexplicable reason, Dravid was often made to openthe batting just because our openers were ***, and several times, this came against Australia (in the 2008 series especially), and against South Africa (I think in the 96 series). These are extenuating circumstances too, right?\n\nAnd anyway, I do agree Dravid and inzi were both not quite as good against Australia and SA as they should've been, but for me, personally, my overall impression of Inzi was already made by the time I'd watched his first 50-60 tests, when he was nothing more than a mediocre batsman, for me. Was brilliant lattter on in his career, but my mind was rather unfairly, maybe, already made up."
