        "text": "Former India captain MS Dhoni left the audience in splits as he was speaking about the success mantra and the importance of processes and hard work at a recent event. Dhoni was enthralling the gathering by giving a sneak peek into his thinking process which has made him a decorated cricketer and one of the most successful captains in cricket.\n\nDhoni has found success so much so that his leadership has become textbook material in B schools across the country. When Dhoni was asked how he would have approached a hypothetical situation in which he was to run between the wickets with former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq, the World Cup winner shed light on the importance of being a team player while understanding the strengths and weaknesses of one's teammates.\n\nIn an interaction with popular presenter Vikram Sathaye for Livfast, MS Dhoni said he would definitely slow down when running alongside Inzamam-ul-Haq, the legendary Pakistan batter who was not known for his running skills between the wickets.\n\n\"If I am running with Inzy bhai, it's important that I reduce my speed. If I don't reduce my speed. then run-out was going to happen 100 percent,\" MS Dhoni said, cracking up the gathering on Thursday.\n\n-1 MINUTE TEAM MEETING\n\nDhoni also recalled the 'shortest team meeting' of his career, saying it lasted \"-1 minute\" during an Indian Premier League season with Chennai Super Kings.\n\nIt's common knowledge that Dhoni kept his team meetings short, be it at CSK or for Team India. The Jharkhand hero has often said in the past that he likes to sleep in the mornings on match days and be fresh for on-field action.\n\nWith an unconventional approach, Dhoni has found plenty of success at the highest level. While he became the only captain to win all 3 major ICC trophies -- the T20 World Cup, the Cricket World Cup and the Champions Trophy, Dhoni also won 4 IPL trophies and 2 Champions League trophies with CSK.\n\n\"Our shortest team meeting ever was at CSK. IT was actually -1 minute. You can debate as to how you can have a meeting for -1 minute. The meeting was scheduled for 5:30 pm. All the players, support staff and everyone, we got together by 5:28. Then we said 'everyone has come, let's start the meeting'. By 5:29 pm, the meeting was over. 5:30 we left. So it was -1 minute,\" Dhoni explained.\n\nDhoni will be back to lead Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2023. Despite having retired from international cricket in August 2020, the 41-year-old has been playing in the IPL."
