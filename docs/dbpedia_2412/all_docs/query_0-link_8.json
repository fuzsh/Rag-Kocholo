        "text": "'I am going to make a promise to the Foreign Minister right now and that is that I will even try to understand cricket.'\n\nSo said the US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice on arriving in New Delhi recently. In the past, Henry Kissinger affected a love of football to aid diplomatic relations, but for an American to say that she will make an effort with cricket shows both how important the sport is in Asia and how important Asia is in the global game.\n\nThe series between India and Pakistan is likely to be won by India, but its finest moment came on Thursday after lunch, when Inzamam-ul-Haq, as Javed Miandad had done before him, celebrated his one hundredth Test with a century against India. 'This was one of my best innings because of the circumstances,' the Pakistan captain said. 'This is a crucial Test and I walked out to bat when the score was seven for two. The team needed me to stay at the crease.'\n\nStay he did, batting in that beguiling, lethargic way of his, getting into line as late as possible and rattling up the runs with deceptive ease.\n\nSeldom has a batsman played with such economy of effort. So sluggish is Inzamam as he goes out to bat that one can doubt that he will ever make it to the middle. Once there, he bats with an extraordinary stillness. Never flustered, never flashy, always effective. Since he started exercising, belatedly in his career, he has shed a few stone, but he remains a big man surrounded by athletes. A throwback to the days of Colin Milburn or Wally Hammond.\n\nIf he had the drive and ambition and focus of Brian Lara or Sachin Tendulkar, Inzi might have matched their records. That he does not, and has not, does not necessarily make him less admirable. What he has done, throughout his career, is deliver when it matters. In his early twenties he was drafted into the Pakistan 1992 World Cup squad at Imran Khan's insistence and went in to bat fourth wicket down in the semi-final against New Zealand with his team needing 123 at more than eight an over. He scored 'a less haste, more speed' 60. In the final, his 42 from 35 balls turned the match against England.\n\nInzamam has not only helped his country in their moments of triumph but also ensured that they have avoided belittling failure. In front of his home crowd in Multan in 2003, he scored a nerveless 138 to secure a squeaky one-wicket victory over Bangladesh. Furthermore, the big man can make big scores. In Lahore against New Zealand in 2002 he weighed in with 329, eight runs short of Hanif Mohammad's record for their country. After that marathon effort he was typically modest, saying: 'Even if I had broken Hanif's record I would never have been as good as he was. He is still an icon in Pakistan and probably the best batsman we have produced. It was my destiny to fall short.'\n\nThis humility was evident again at close of play on Thursday, when, rather than draw attention to his achievements, he praised fellow century-maker Younis Khan, saying: 'Younis played a better innings than me.'\n\nIt is doubly remarkable that Inzamam, undemonstrative and self-effacing, will also be remembered as cricket's Eric Cantona after an incident in Toronto during an exhibition match between India and Pakistan eight years ago. Prasad Chodavarupu, who was present, takes up the story. 'And then suddenly, the Pakistan twelfth man walks out with a bat, Rameez [Raja] asks Inzamam to go to long leg and Inzamam comes innocuously jogging there. To my amazement, he then jumps into the stand, grabs the bat and runs wild at a guy with a megaphone. If not for the spectators and security staff curbing him, he would have broken the head of that guy. The guy with the megaphone was no match for Inzamam and got mauled. Even when Canadian police took Inzamam back on to the field, he was trying to get back to the stands.'\n\nAfter being ushered to safety, the heckler said: 'I was calling him a potato in Punjabi because he is a little fat. And as a result the ' aloo ' hit the fan. Inzamam received a two-match ban - but there was no talk of seagulls.\n\nInzamam was brought up in Multan, an unforgiving place where the temperatures can stay at 45 degrees for months at a time. He is the son of a 'successful landlord' and grew up playing cricket with his brothers on a dust track without a blade of grass. It is a town many want to leave; Inzamam, by contrast, is president of the local cricket club, keeping a low profile 'even at home with my wife'.\n\nThe aberration in Toronto aside, Inzamam's career has been marked by gentleness. He is more likely to meld into a crowd than wade into it. Before he finally accepted the captaincy, twice he turned it down on the grounds that he would not feel comfortable dictating to senior players. Pakistan captains tend to follow the Miandad or Imran model and be fiery and pugnacious; Inzamam is the reverse.\n\n'If people think I don't care enough it is the wrong impression,' he says. 'My way of captaincy is totally different. I will never shout at a team-mate because he dropped a catch. I will instead tell him in the dressing room that he needs more fielding practice.'\n\nIt is an approach admired by Pakistan team manager Bob Woolmer. 'He's a terrifically respected captain and makes lots of wise decisions on the field that he's not given credit for,' he says. 'He thinks things through and people interpret that as indecisive. He has a quiet presence.'\n\nA point emphasised by Steve Bucknor, who describes him as the quietest captain he has umpired. It was no surprise that when Inzamam completed his century on Thursday there were no histrionics. He simply acknowledged the Pakistan dressing room by raising his arms, then, without the hint of a fist pump, put them down again. Why do anything more?"
