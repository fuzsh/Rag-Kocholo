Players playing in this league get huge amount of money. Meanwhile, a big news is coming out. The Board of Control for Cricket in India is soon going to take a big decision for the players playing domestic cricket. BCCI is considering a special plan for the players who are not playing in the IPL. Salaries of domestic players may increase soon. <!-- /8323530/Khabar_Desktop_VDO_1X1 --> BCCI is going to take a big decision soon According to a report by Cricbuzz, the Board of Control for Cricket in India may soon increase the salary of players playing domestic cricket. Ajit Agarkar’s selection committee has been entrusted with the task of giving suggestions regarding its implementation. According to reports, BCCI believes that the fees of domestic cricketers should be at least double. The board can give Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore as annual salary to players who play 10 Ranji Trophy matches. What is the salary of domestic players now? At present, salary is given on the basis of experience in domestic cricket. BCCI pays Rs 60,000 per day to players who play more than 40 Ranji games, Rs 50,000 to those who play 21 to 40 games and Rs 40,000 to those who play 20 matches. At this pay scale, a senior cricketer earns up to Rs 25 lakh if his team reaches the finals, while other players in the team earn between Rs 17 lakh and Rs 22 lakh. BCCI wants to promote red ball cricket BCCI is working on promoting red ball cricket. BCCI has recently started an incentive scheme in Test cricket to promote red ball cricket. Under this, the match fees of players who play more than 75% of the tests in a year will increase by 300%. At the same time, BCCI had recently asked the players included in the central contract to play domestic cricket. In such a situation, BCCI is bringing new schemes to promote domestic cricket. read this also T20 World Cup 2024: Haven’t played even a single World Cup, what if you haven’t got a chance now….

This controversy has escalated to the point where even Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor has publicly questioned the selection criteria for the Indian ODI team. The esteemed cricketer Gautam Gambhir has previously emphasized the need to support Samson with the same dedication afforded to stalwarts like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, asserting that such backing would catapult Samson to become the world's premier batsman. Gambhir's endorsement is not frivolous; it reflects a deeply held belief in Samson's potential and merits. However, this brings us to a troubling crossroads. What has become of Gambhir's prescient assertion? Was it made merely to serve some past agenda, or to sow discord within the selection committee? Aligning with Gambhir’s perspective, it's evident that he has always been forthright, unafraid to speak his truth, a rarity among cricketers. This situation begs a critical question: Who is truly at the helm of Team India? Gambhir’s observation that those making pivotal decisions have likely never played cricket and sit in air-conditioned rooms, rings alarmingly true. If the coach and team head are unable to exercise autonomy in selections, it bodes ill for Indian cricket. It's disheartening to consider that someone of Rahul Dravid's stature might be constrained in his player choices. This must change. The coach should be the primary authority in player selection. Administrators should focus on their substantial responsibilities, including developing world-class stadiums, enhancing infrastructure, promoting women’s cricket, and appropriately rewarding Ranji players, especially those who have contributed since the early 1980s. The BCCI is not lacking in funds; what it seems to lack is the wisdom to utilize them effectively. Exceptional consultants with diverse expertise are available and could steer Indian cricket towards a more judicious path. To ensure the best interests of Indian cricket are served, it is imperative that we reevaluate and rectify the current selection process, empowering the coach and making informed, cricket-driven decisions. The time for change is now. Gautam Gambhir's Remarks On 'World No.1' Sanju Samson Go Viral After ODI Snub vs Sri Lanka: 'Loss Of India...' | Times Now (timesnownews.com)\n\nNEW DELHI: <!-- -->England<!-- -->‘s cricket coach <!-- -->Brendon McCullum<!-- --> has openly admitted that the team’s much-touted ‘<!-- -->Bazball<!-- -->‘ approach requires significant adjustments following their 4-1 Test series defeat against India.In a candid assessment, McCullum conceded to the travelling British media, “Sometimes, you can get away with things. But when you’re exposed the way we have been in the back end of this series in particular, it does require some pretty deep thinking and some adjustment to make sure we’re staying true to what we believe in.”Highlighting the pressure exerted by the Indian team, McCullum noted, “If anything, we got more timid as the series went on, and that was because of the pressure that was applied to us by the Indian lineup.”The series saw promising performances from Indian youngsters in the absence of key players like <!-- -->Virat Kohli<!-- --> and <!-- -->Mohammed Shami<!-- -->. Yashasvi Jaiswal<!-- -->, Dhruv Jurel, and <!-- -->Sarfaraz Khan<!-- --> made significant contributions, complicating matters for the visitors.This series loss marked the first setback for England in the ‘Bazball’ era, sparking debates about the team’s one-dimensional approach. McCullum acknowledged, “There are some things where you can get a little bit of luck on your side and you paper over a couple of the cracks. When you are exposed in the way we have been here, you know that you have to get better in some areas.” Reflecting on England’s missed opportunities and lapses in judgment, McCullum suggested, “Whether that affected our approach a little bit and put some doubt in our minds that wasn’t there early in the series, I’m not really sure why at this point in time.”Looking ahead, McCullum stressed the importance of refining England’s approach to ensure they are better prepared for future challenges. “The next couple of months will be us working out that and making sure when we come to the summer we are a more refined version of what we are at the minute,” he concluded.(With inputs from PTI) !(function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { function loadFBEvents(isFBCampaignActive) { if (!isFBCampaignActive) { return; } (function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { if (f.fbq) return; n = f.fbq = function() { n.callMethod ? n.callMethod(...arguments) : n.queue.push(arguments); }; if (!f._fbq) f._fbq = n; n.push = n; n.loaded = !0; n.version = '2.0'; n.queue = []; t = b.createElement(e); t.async = !0; t.defer = !0; t.src = v; s = b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s); })(f, b, e, 'https://lnkd.in/d-eUnHGy', n, t, s); fbq('init', '593671331875494'); fbq('track', 'PageView'); }; function loadGtagEvents(isGoogleCampaignActive) { if (!isGoogleCampaignActive) {\n\nNEW DELHI: Amidst growing concerns over the prioritization of the Indian Premier League (IPL) over <!-- -->first-class cricket<!-- -->, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (<!-- -->BCCI<!-- -->) is deliberating on potential reforms to ensure a balanced approach to player development. The spotlight falls on players like <!-- -->Ishan Kishan<!-- -->, whose reluctance to engage in first-class cricket has sparked discussions within the cricketing fraternity. A BCCI official shed light on the matter, stating, “We can understand <!-- -->Hardik Pandya<!-- -->‘s case as his body can’t take the rigors of <!-- -->red-ball cricket<!-- -->. He can’t withstand the workload of Test cricket and Team India needs him fit for ICC events.” The official emphasized the need to preserve Pandya’s fitness for crucial ICC events, acknowledging the unique circumstances surrounding his absence from red-ball cricket.However, concerns have been raised regarding players who prioritize personal factors over professional commitments. “Some of the other youngsters, whenever you call them, they will cite that they are currently doing physio work. There needs to be a stop somewhere,” remarked the BCCI official to PTI, underscoring the necessity of addressing such trends.In response to these concerns, the BCCI has reportedly directed Ishan Kishan to participate in Jharkhand’s upcoming <!-- -->Ranji Trophy<!-- --> match against Rajasthan. Kishan’s frequent absence from first-class fixtures, often attributed to reasons like “travel fatigue,” has drawn criticism from cricketing authorities, especially given his active involvement in training with his IPL team in Baroda.Echoing these sentiments, a senior BCCI official highlighted the need for a stringent policy to deter players from solely focusing on the IPL. “The decision makers in BCCI are well aware that some players don’t want to play any red-ball cricket,” the official stated, suggesting that mandatory participation in a set number of Ranji Trophy matches may be implemented to promote a balanced approach to player development.Even the Indian team’s management expressed dissatisfaction with players exhibiting reluctance towards playing Ranji Trophy matches, underscoring broader concerns regarding player commitment and development within the domestic cricketing landscape.

The game of cricket is like this. There is so much excitement between victory and defeat that people remain glued to the screen to see and feel it. But many years ago, such a strange incident happened in the world of cricket, knowing which people are surprised. 286 runs were scored on 1 ball (1 Ball 286 run cricket match). Have you ever heard about this incident? A video was posted a few months ago on the Instagram account @bdm_cricket_fans which is becoming increasingly viral. It has been told in this video that there was a cricket match in the world in which 286 runs were scored on a single ball (1 ball 286 runs in cricket match). So is this video true or fake? An article about this has been published on the reliable website of the cricket world, ESPNcricinfo, which has explained about this incident in depth. This photo related to that match keeps going viral on social media. (Photo source: Social media) What is the truth of the incident?According to the article, such an incident is recorded in history, but at that time the only source of this news was the English newspaper Pall Mall Gazette in which this news was published. This incident was not recorded in any camera. The report of that newspaper was later published in newspapers of many other countries, so it can be believed. What is the whole incident?This incident happened on 15 January 1894. This match was being played in Western Australia between two teams named Victoria and ‘Scratch-XI’. This match was being played at Bonbury ground. Victoria’s batsmen were batting. The batsman hit the ball in such a way that it got stuck in a tree in the field. What happened next, the batsmen started running on the pitch for runs. The ball was stuck very high and could not be removed. The opposition team appealed to the umpire to declare the ball lost so that they could prevent the batsmen from scoring runs. But the umpire rejected the appeal saying that the ball was in plain sight, hence it could not be declared lost. It has been claimed in the report that the fielding team had asked someone to bring an axe, with which they could cut the tree and take down the ball, but even the ax could not be found there. Then a rifle was called for and the ball was aimed and brought down. When the ball came down, the players were so frustrated that they did not even think it was right to catch it. By that time the batsmen had scored 286 runs. He had run on the pitch for a total of 6 kilometers. Even today this incident shocks everyone, and many people do not even believe it. , Tags: Ajab Gajab news, trending news, Weird news FIRST PUBLISHED: <!-- -->April 22, 2024, 12:17 IST\n\nIn a recent ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, a rare incident occurred Angelo Mathew’s dismissal, and Bangladesh's captain, Shakib Ul Hassan’s, appeal for a \"Timed out\" decision. The rule, as mentioned, dictates that the incoming batter must be ready to receive the ball or for the other batter to be ready within 3 minutes of the dismissal or retirement. If this isn't met, the incoming batter is given out, \"Timed out.\" It's important to note that this rule is a part of the game, and any captain or team has the right to utilize it when the situation arises. Shakib's decision to appeal for a \"Timed out\" dismissal, although rare, was within the laws of the game. The controversial discussions that often follow such incidents highlight the balance between playing by the rules and the spirit of sportsmanship. While cricket is known as a gentleman's game, the adherence to rules is crucial for maintaining discipline and ensuring the game's integrity. In the absence of this rule, there might be a lack of discipline, and the number of overs bowled per hour could be affected. Ultimately, whether to give the opposition a chance or not is a decision left to the players and the team's discretion. It's a reminder that cricket, like any sport, is a combination of rules, strategy, and sportsmanship, and the balance between them can sometimes be a subject of debate. #cricket\n\nNEW DELHI: Following India’s triumph in the five-match series against England, securing a 4-1 victory, <!-- -->BCCI<!-- --> secretary <!-- -->Jay Shah<!-- --> unveiled a novel initiative, the ‘Test Cricket Incentive Scheme’. This scheme aims to reward players who commit to representing the country in red-ball cricket, providing additional incentives beyond the standard match fees.India captain <!-- -->Rohit Sharma<!-- --> lauded Shah’s efforts. “Test cricket was & will be the ultimate format and it’s great to see BCCI and Jay Shah leading the way in prioritizing Test cricket,” Rohit wrote on his Twitter handle.Lauding Shah’s decision, Team India head coach Rahul Dravid hoped that the players would look at it as a reward for their hard work rather than another source to earn money.“I really hope money is not going to be the incentive to play Test cricket. It’s just the hard work and how tough Test cricket can be is being recognised.“So, I wouldn’t see it as an incentive to make people play Test cricket, I hope not. But it is nice that the BCCI is recognizing it. I think it is a reward, not an incentive,” said the former Indian skipper. !(function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { function loadFBEvents(isFBCampaignActive) { if (!isFBCampaignActive) { return; } (function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { if (f.fbq) return; n = f.fbq = function() { n.callMethod ? n.callMethod(...arguments) : n.queue.push(arguments); }; if (!f._fbq) f._fbq = n; n.push = n; n.loaded = !0; n.version = '2.0'; n.queue = []; t = b.createElement(e); t.async = !0; t.defer = !0; t.src = v; s = b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s); })(f, b, e, 'https://lnkd.in/d-eUnHGy', n, t, s); fbq('init', '593671331875494'); fbq('track', 'PageView'); }; function loadGtagEvents(isGoogleCampaignActive) { if (!isGoogleCampaignActive) { return; } var id = document.getElementById('toi-plus-google-campaign'); if (id) { return; } (function(f, b, e, v, n, t, s) { t = b.createElement(e); t.async = !0; t.defer = !0; t.src = v; t.id = 'toi-plus-google-campaign'; s = b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(t, s); })(f, b, e, 'https://lnkd.in/d_uP4Cr7', n, t, s); }; function loadSurvicateJs(allowedSurvicateSections = []){ const section = window.location.pathname.split('/')[1] const isHomePageAllowed = window.location.pathname === '/' && allowedSurvicateSections.includes('homepage') if(allowedSurvicateSections.includes(section) || isHomePageAllowed){ (function(w) { var s = document.createElement('script');\n\nNEW DELHI: Former South African cricket sensation <!-- -->AB de Villiers<!-- --> has found himself at the center of a storm after inadvertently spreading misinformation regarding the absence of Indian cricket stalwart <!-- -->Virat Kohli<!-- --> from the ongoing <!-- -->England Test series<!-- -->. De Villiers, known for his camaraderie with Kohli both on and off the field, expressed regret over his earlier statement, acknowledging that he had shared false information about Kohli’s personal life.“Absolutely family comes first, it’s a priority, as I said on my YouTube show. Also, I made a terrible mistake at the same time and yeah, sharing false information which was not true at all. No one knows what’s happening. That’s all I can do is wish him well,” de Villiers told Dainik Bhaskar in an exclusive interview.Initially, de Villiers had suggested that Kohli and his wife, Anushka Sharma, were anticipating their second child, linking Kohli’s absence from the initial matches of the England series to family commitments. However, realizing his error, de Villiers promptly retracted his previous comments, admitting to disseminating false information and extending his apologies for the confusion caused.Despite the clarification, speculations regarding Kohli’s prolonged hiatus continue to linger, with reports hinting at the possibility of his absence extending to upcoming Tests in Rajkot and Ranchi. With the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) yet to provide official updates, uncertainty shrouds Kohli’s status and its implications for the team.Reflecting on the incident, de Villiers emphasized the paramount importance of family obligations while urging fans to extend their support and well-wishes to Kohli during this period of uncertainty.What AB de Villiers said earlier: It’s confirmed!

Unusual for a day one of a test match, 23 wickets fell for only 271 runs, leaving many cricket enthusiasts, including myself, perplexed. While commentators and news outlets have heaped praise on the bowlers' performances, labeling it a \"bowlers' paradise\" and celebrating their brilliance, there appears to be a lack of acknowledgement regarding the substandard pitch prepared by Cricket South Africa. This raises questions about potential biases and double standards when it comes to evaluating pitches. It is worth considering how similar situations have been criticized in the past. When Indian spinners have achieved a five-wicket haul on pitches deemed favorable to them on day 3 or 4 of a test match , there have been widespread complaints about the poor standards and unplayability of the pitches. It is essential to maintain consistency and fairness in assessing pitches across different cricketing nations. The responsibility for pitch preparation lies with the respective cricket boards, in this case, Cricket South Africa. If there are concerns about the quality of the pitch at Newlands, it is valid to express disappointment and address these concerns to the relevant governing body, such as the International Cricket Council (ICC), who can investigate the matter. It is important to recognize that while the Newlands pitch may have produced an unusual match, it also showcased the skills and abilities of the bowlers, who were able to capitalize on the challenging conditions. However, it is crucial for cricket authorities to strike a balance that provides a fair and competitive playing field while upholding the integrity and quality of Test cricket. To foster a healthy cricketing environment, open discussions about pitch conditions are necessary, and continuous efforts should be made to improve the overall standard and experience of Test cricket. It is within the realm of possibility for the ICC and Cricket South Africa to address concerns and to ensure that future pitches meet the expected standards of the game. Let’s hope that the 2nd test will end on day 2"
