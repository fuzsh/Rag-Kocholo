        "text": "The Pakistan Cricket Board has announced its 15-member team for the 2023 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup, confirming that an injured Naseem Shah will be on a lengthy layoff.\n\nThe tournament is set to begin in India on October 5, with Pakistan’s first match being on the next day against the Netherlands.\n\nShah, 20, who has been a key player in Pakistan’s performance recently, is set to undergo surgery for a shoulder injury and has been replaced by Hasan Ali.\n\nThe blow to Shah’s shoulder ruled him out of the Asia Cup during Pakistan’s match with India on September 10 and is likely to push him to the sidelines for a few months.\n\n“Unfortunately, the report we have from our doctors, we hear Naseem will be out for a longer time than just the World Cup,” Inzamam-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s chief selector, told ESPNcricinfo website.\n\nShah also shared his disappointment about not being able to join the tournament through X, formerly Twitter. “With a heavy heart, I’m sharing that I will not be part of this amazing team that will be representing our beloved country,” he wrote.\n\nHasan Ali in the team\n\nAli, 29, last played a one-day international (ODI) in June 2022. His most recent performance in the Pakistan team was in the second Test match against New Zealand in January this year.\n\n“If you see how Hasan Ali performed in the LPL [Lanka Premier League], or other performances, he has performed better than most. He is an experienced bowler who has played big mega events for Pakistan and performed well in them,” Inzamam told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nHe added that the medium pace bowler was included because of his “team spirit and ability to bring energy to the squad”.\n\nOther squad changes\n\nShah was not the only Pakistan team player to sustain injuries in recent matches. Muhammad Hasnain and Ihsanullah have also been left out of the squad owing to injuries.\n\nUsama Mir has been included as an extra leg-spinner after making his ODI debut earlier this year and Mohammad Haris is among the reserves.\n\n“I have not made any such changes. The team has been playing with this combination for the last two years and if I tried to disrupt the team within three weeks of my appointment that would not be okay,” said Inzamam.\n\nThe announcement of the Pakistan squad comes two days after Muhammad Hafeez resigned from the Pakistan cricket technical committee, adding to speculations about tensions surrounding the squad selection process.\n\nPakistan squad: Babar Azam (captain), Shadab Khan (vice captain), Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Abdullah Shafique, Mohammad Rizwan (wicketkeeper), Saud Shakeel, Iftikhar Ahmed, Salman Ali Agha, Mohammad Nawaz, Usama Mir, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Shaheen Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jr"
