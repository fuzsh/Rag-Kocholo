The PCB selects junior and senior national men’s and women’s cricket teams to represent the country on the global stage, runs high performance cricket centers across the country and plans and organizes domestic competitions and international bi-lateral series.\n\nThe PCB is committed to developing ground and facility infrastructure, monitoring the implementation of playing codes and regulations, and supporting the game at every level through its high-quality training provision for officials and coaches.\n\nIn a rare treat for the Pakistani Tech Community, the Google AMP Road Show recently came to Karachi on October 3rd, 2019. If you have ever searched for content and interacted with the results on a mobile device, you have probably encountered AMP, or Accelerated Mobile Pages.\n\nAMP is an open source framework developed by Google in collaboration with Twitter. Accelerated Mobile Pages create better, faster experiences on the mobile web and at its core, the framework allows you to build lightweight experiences for mobile.\n\nIn the few years since AMP was launched, it is generally accepted that media sites do well on AMP. Since most of the content on media sites is static, these websites have seen significant boosts in organic search traffic. In addition, Google has also made it simple for publishers to make their content stand out with Rich Cards and the publishing industry at large took the lead on deploying and innovating on the AMP stack. Whilst mobile commerce and other users have tried to build complex solutions on AMP, TCS was the first company to demonstrate a logistics and delivery use case.\n\nAs the leading courier company and Pakistan’s Logistics backbone, the TCS Labs team, an internal innovation unit under TCS Holdings, built out and deployed an AMP/PWA hybrid across the extensive national and regional network of TCS Retail locations. Faizan Siddiqi, COO & Head of Digital Transformation at TCS, demonstrated the new AMPlify Stack at the Google led, AMP Roadshow in Karachi.\n\nTCS will continue to invest, innovate and enhance its thought leadership on the Google AMP platform. Similar to our pioneering and ongoing contributions to the broader courier industry, TCS is committed to building out and enabling a center of excellence within its Labs group to upskill domestic resources using our platform with a view to engineer more transformative solutions that run on AMP and PWA and to prepare our nation for the Digital age in general. As always, our goal remains to delight our customers with increasing reliability and convenience while also providing nationwide digital services to every corner of Pakistan including the remotest of areas, that we reach every day, to promote digital inclusion and connectivity for all.\n\nUber, the global ride-hailing giant, connecting riders to drivers, has partnered with TCS, Pakistan’s largest and most recognized courier, logistics and e-commerce solutions provider. The new partnership offers exclusive discounts for Uber riders to make commuting to and from TCS retail outlets even more safe and convenient.\n\n“The thought behind this initiative is to provide an easy and seamless travel experience to our riders,” said Omar Askari, Head of Business Uber, “We are delighted to announce our partnership with TCS and are looking forward to making the Uber more and more convenient for our riders.”\n\nThe new service will initially be implemented at over 40 TCS outlets in Karachi and Lahore. Not only will new Uber riders have the option to avail promo codes at these TCS locations, but the Uber app will also show users the various TCS Express centers as safe and prominent pick-up locations on the map.\n\nWhile commenting on the partnership Ms. Saira Awan, Vice Chairperson and Group CEO at TCS Holdings said, “TCS is really excited about its partnership with an innovative global brand like Uber. We feel that our walk-in customers will benefit greatly from synergies being created by the two organizations.”\n\nRiders can now book Uber rides from any of the selected outlets by merely tapping on the map. Additionally, new users will be able to avail a unique promo code for their first rides.\n\nThe collaboration between the two companies is aimed at giving riders a safe and easy solution for their travel needs and is expected to expand to more cities across Pakistan given the nationwide reach and coverage of TCS.\n\nTCS has recently embarked on a collaborative journey with researchers at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), to study the performance, well-being and commitment of its employees.\n\nThe LSE team includes Dr. Jordi Blanes i Vidal (an Associate Professor at the Department of Management, LSE) and Dr. Diego Battiston (an Assistant Professor in Economics at Stockholm University, and an Associate at the Centre of Economic Performance, LSE). Both Dr. Jordi and Dr. Diego hold PhDs in Economics from LSE and are renowned experts in the economics of organisations. They have taught and extensively researched topics such as performance incentives, worker productivity, and the effects of social connections in organisations.\n\nFrom LSE’s perspective, TCS is the ideal partner for this research collaboration. As the premier courier and logistics company and one of the leading family-owned firms in Pakistan, TCS over the years has developed an unmatched reputation and brand synonymous with internal efficiency, service excellence and trust. Dr. Jordi Blanes i Vidal stated that “TCS delivers countless parcels from a large number of customers and it does so every day. This is a highly-optimised, time sensitive operation in which nothing can go wrong. TCS has invested extensively in its processes and systems and it has attracted the best employees and trained them relentlessly. At LSE, we want to study how to create and sustain such highly performing organisations.”\n\nThe research will use econometric methods to explore quantitatively the determinants of high performance. Initially, the focus will be on the effects that TCS HR policies and performance incentives have on its couriers' work satisfaction, productivity and turnover. The research team will then move to study how the organisation of the work flow contributes to TCS’s ability to keep its promise to customers of guaranteeing the prompt and reliable delivery of each parcel. Dr. Battiston said that “this collaboration constitutes a great opportunity for us. It is unusual to find a leadership team as enlightened as TCS, in terms of being willing to engage with the latest scientific research. We are definitely going to learn a lot from this company and hopefully TCS will learn from us also.”\n\n“As an alumnus and current employee, we are thrilled to partner up with LSE to analyse some of the most pressing issues of our time” said Harris Jamali the Group Head of Strategy at TCS Holdings. “With the rapid pace of change in the industry and broader economy, we feel it is the responsibility of a national and homegrown institution like TCS to drive such thought leadership. Given our reach and eco-system of services, TCS essentially represents a pulse on the economy and a microcosm of the national fabric of our society including its challenges and complexities. Therefore, we hope that any lessons from our collaboration will yield positive and growing externalities for the future of Pakistan.”\n\nThe courier industry has been going through a transformation globally and ecommerce is a very important sector to capitalize on, said Qasim Awan, Director at TCS, during a panel discussion at Expo Center in Karachi.\n\nTitled ‘Momentum8 Creating Possibilities’ the 2-day conclave brought together tech professionals for a discourse on e-commerce, startups and fintech.\n\n“We plan to continuously innovate and make our customers comfortable in working with us,” he said as part of the discussion on the topic ‘Is Ecommerce the Future Mode of Business?’.\n\nAwan also spoke about the global scenario of e-commerce logistics and its impact in Pakistan. He highlighted what TCS was already doing for e-commerce online startups.\n\n“Online start-ups need more investment and liquidity during the early phase of their development and TCS supports online startups by providing them with special SME offers such as free deliveries for a certain time period,” he added.\n\nHe was also of the view that due to TCS’s international alliance with UPS, deliveries were possible anywhere in the world just by being plugged into the TCS ecommerce platform.\n\n“We do believe that we have the capability and local knowledge, and we aim to remain the number one player in the ecommerce market,” he pointed out.\n\nModerating the Panel was Raza Matin, with Hassaan of Trax Logistics, Imran Baxamoosa of BlueEx, Qasim Awan of TCS on the panel. A host of other industry specialists addressed such thought-provoking areas as ‘New Face of the Pakistani Entrepreneurial Ecosystem’, ‘Opportunities in the ICT Sector’, ‘Why Telcos are Looking at Tech Startups’, etc. End.\n\nAbout TCS\n\nPakistan’s most recognizable and preferred courier, logistics and e-commerce provider; TCS provides services to the corporate sector, SMEs and household customers.
