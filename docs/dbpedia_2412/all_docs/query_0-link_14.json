        "text": "Umm, I never mentioned anything about EPO. As for the interview, I'll take your word for it. I'm sure it was interesting.\n\nNo it was discussed with some one else and not with you ,When I wrote that post I was also hearing the interview and I heard him (Javed) saying some thing against this EPO type of rants .Anyways see the interview and its in two parts actually ....\n\nYou know what ,I only discuss any thing other than cricket in CC when it is extremely important .\n\nOK ! let me tell you and the others who do not accept my vocabulary as a unique one .\n\nAfter the initial goo goo ga gaas ,I developed my own vocabulary ,e.g. I used to call any potential edible item as \"Khum\" , And I used to ask my dad \" Is it khum\" , if his reply was \"yes\" only then I put the thing in my mouth. Strangely he never permitted cannibalism .I developed this habbit of inventing my own terms when I was in diapers. Then it was the turn of Urdu and Punjabi . Then came the faith demands of Arabic (Finished reading the book at the age of 5) . Then Urdu was taught to me along with the basics of Persian . I admit that I started A,B,C when I was in the K.G. But never had the chance to speak or extensively write \"the\" language until my Master's levels . Thats my history sunny ... *** outta your Island for goodness sake and try learning even a single verse in Persian .\n\nEPO EPO , sick and tired !!!!!!!!!!! This term suited only the man who invented it, Alas he is long gone . May his stupid little teenage soul rest in peace ..\n\nBack to cricket , Inzamam's captaincy = Ewwwwwwwwww !!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHaha Fraz."
