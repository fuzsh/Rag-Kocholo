        "text": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's chief selector, Inzamam-ul-Haq, stepped down from his post on Monday, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said, amid the national side's below-par performance at the World Cup.\n\nHaq's resignation came after media reports suggested he had a stake in a company that contracted several Pakistan players for marketing and commercial promotions.\n\nIn a statement shared by the PCB, Haq said he was resigning for the sake of a \"transparent inquiry\" into the conflict-of-interest allegations against him.\n\n\"I am stepping down from the post to offer the PCB the opportunity to conduct a transparent inquiry about the conflict-of-interest allegations raised in the media,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\n\"If the committee finds me not guilty, I will resume my role as the chief selector.\"\n\nHaq was appointed chief selector of the Pakistan men's team in August 2023 and was appointed chairman of the junior men's selection committee earlier this month.\n\nThe PCB earlier said it had set up a five-member fact-finding committee to investigate allegations in respect of conflict of interest reported in the media pertaining to the team's selection process.\n\nThe committee would submit its report and any recommendations to the PCB management in an expeditious manner, it added.\n\nThe developments come amid Pakistan's poor performance in the ongoing World Cup.\n\nPakistan are on the verge of crashing out of the ongoing World Cup in India, having lost four of their six matches.\n\nThey face Bangladesh in Kolkata on Tuesday and not only need to win all their remaining three matches but also hope other results go in their favor in order to reach the semifinals.\n\nISLAMABAD: The children sat huddled on the concrete floor of a park in Islamabad’s F-6 sector, scribbling on their notebooks as they listened intently to the teachers.\n\nThis is the open-air classroom run by 66-year-old Mohammed Ayub, better known as “Master Ayub” to the thousands of students the retired government employee has taught in the federal capital since 1982.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, Pakistan has the world’s second-highest number of out-of-school children with an estimated 26.2 million children aged 5-16 not attending school. Gaps in service provision at all education levels, socio-cultural demand-side barriers combined with economic factors and issues such as availability of school facilities and teachers together hamper access and retention of certain marginalized groups, in particular adolescent girls.\n\nAyub wants to change this.\n\n“These children should not become addicts,” he told Arab News at his open-air classroom. “If they study, someone will become a doctor, an engineer, someone will go to colleges and schools, my country will progress. This is my passion, this is my love for these children.”\n\nAyub moved to Islamabad in 1976 from his hometown of Mandi Bahauddin to provide for his seven siblings after his father passed away. He got a job at the government’s civic emergency services department and became a firefighter and would retire ultimately as the Chief Fire Officer at the Pakistan Secretariat.\n\nAyub was motivated to start a learning center for the underprivileged when he met a 12-year-old bussing tables at a restaurant in Islamabad in 1982. When the boy told Ayub his parents couldn’t afford tuition, Ayub started giving him lessons on a footpath initially and later at a park.\n\nHis initial group of students came from Islamabad’s slums and grew in number as the years passed, with many going on to get admissions in colleges and universities and find jobs at hospitals and in the army and police departments, said Ayub, who has been given Pakistan’s national “Pride of Performance” award for his contributions to education.\n\n“CHANGED MY LIFE”\n\nUp to 270 students are enrolled at Ayub’s free school at any one time. One student who has passed through is Zafran Ali, AGE, who now works as a firefighter at the IT ministry.\n\nAli became a child laborer after his parents moved to Islamabad to find domestic work but started studying at Ayub’s classroom in 2000, taking grade 1 lessons with his two sisters and a brother. Six years old at the time, Ali’s other classmates were daily wage laborers, flower sellers and car washers. He went on to pass his matriculation exams and get a Faculty of Arts (FA) qualification, degrees that helped him get a decent job.\n\n“My family was working in someone’s house and if I had not studied here or if Master Ayub had not worked so hard on me, I would also be working in someone’s house,” Ali told Arab News.\n\nAli, who is now married with two children, said Ayub was so dedicated to his task he would show up at children’s homes when they did not come to class.\n\n“Master Ayub has changed my life, and not only mine but also the lives of many others,” Ali said, giving examples of other peers who went on to secure “good positions,” including as policemen.\n\nAzika Shehbaz, an 18-year-old intermediate student, was also Ayub’s student years ago and is now a volunteer teacher at his school.\n\n“When he used to teach children, we were watching him from the beginning,” Shehbaz told Arab News. “So, in our hearts, we thought that we have to become teachers also.”\n\nIn 2022, Ayub’s classroom closed briefly for the first time in 40 years when he had an accident in which his wife, brother and child were killed while the teacher escaped with a broken arm and leg.\n\nDespite his grief, Ayub said people lifted his spirits and convinced him to resume classes for the children.\n\n“People came to me, Muslims and Christians alike, they said, ‘Master sahib, this is life, we all have to go’,” Ayub recalled. “They said to me, ‘Get up again. If you don’t, these children’s lives will be ruined’.”\n\nNow, as the teacher’s classes continue, his request to people is not for funds but for donations of books and notebooks for the students.\n\n“It is my intention that as long as there is a drop of blood in my body,” he said, “I will continue to educate these children.”\n\nPARIS: From a colorful, sometimes controversial opening ceremony to boxers caught up in a gender row to respectful bows on the gymnastics podium, the 2024 Olympics served up many memorable moments.\n\nAFP Sport looks at 10 of the best:\n\n-- Organizers promised a spectacular opening ceremony and the rain-soaked boat parade on the River Seine ended up making global headlines, but not for the expected reasons.\n\nChurch leaders, conservatives, and even US presidential candidate Donald Trump were left outraged by a scene involving drag queens and lesbian DJ Barbara Butch that appeared to parody Jesus’s Last Supper.\n\nArtistic director Thomas Jolly denied any such intention. He and others involved ended up facing vicious online harassment that led to police complaints.\n\n-- Novak Djokovic stunned Carlos Alcaraz in a memorable men’s final to clinch tennis gold and become only the fifth player to complete the Golden Slam of all four majors plus Olympic gold.\n\nThe 37-year-old celebrated with a roar that echoed around Roland Garros before the tearful Serb clambered into the player’s box to embrace his wife Jelena and two children.\n\n“There is no greater inspiration than representing your country,” said the 24-time Grand Slam title winner.\n\nAlcaraz was also in tears, claiming he “had let Spain down.”\n\n-- Simone Biles may have been the star of the show but she was widely praised for bowing to her arch-rival Rebeca Andrade on the podium.\n\nBiles said it was “just the right thing to do” after she and team-mate Jordan Chiles finished in silver and bronze medal position respectively behind the Brazilian in the floor final.\n\n“Rebeca’s so amazing, she’s queen,” said Biles.\n\nRomanian Ana Barbosu was later awarded the bronze medal after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that Chiles should not have been upgraded from her initial fifth-place finish.\n\n-- World champion Noah Lyles roared to victory in 9.79sec to claim gold in a dramatic men’s Olympic 100m final in the closest finish in modern history — just five thousandths of a second separated him from Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson.\n\n“I’m the man among all of them. I’m the wolf among wolves,” said Lyles whose victory was only confirmed after a photo-finish.\n\n-- Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem won the men’s javelin title, his country’s first individual gold at an Olympics, with a Games record of 92.97m.\n\nIn second place was India’s defending champion Neeraj Chopra.\n\n“Rivalry is there when it comes to cricket matches, other sports, the two countries have a rivalry, but it’s a good thing for the young people in both countries to watch our sport and follow us. It’s a positive thing for both countries,” said Nadeem.\n\n-- Images of Olympic table tennis players from North Korea and South Korea taking a selfie together on the medal podium went viral in South Korea, hailed as a rare show of cross-border unity.\n\nAfter South Korea won bronze and North Korea silver in the mixed doubles behind China, South Korea’s Shin Yu-bin took a group photo after the medal ceremony.\n\nNorth Korea’s Ri Jong Sik and Kim Kum Yong, the South’s Shin Yu-bin and the victorious Chinese team Wang Chuqin and Sun Yingsha all beamed into Lim’s phone, a South Korean-made Samsung.\n\n“A selfie with both Koreas’ national flags and a Samsung phone,” said the widely read daily JongAng Ilbo.\n\n-- Australian skateboarding sensation Arisa Trew, just 14, won the women’s park event to become her country’s youngest ever gold medallist.\n\nTrew nailed a high-risk and high-speed final round in her trademark pink helmet, bringing the crowd to their feet at a sun-drenched Place de la Concorde.\n\nThe event also featured 11-year-old Zheng Haohao, the youngest athlete ever to represent China at the Olympics.\n\n“Skateboarding in the Olympic Games isn’t much different from skateboarding in my neighborhood. It’s just more spectators,” she told reporters.\n\n-- On a raucous night at Roland Garros, the storied home of the French Open, Algerian gender-row boxer Imane Khelif claimed gold and used her platform to hit back at “attacks” and “bullying” before defiantly declaring “I am a woman like any other.”\n\nTogether with Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting, who also fought in Paris, Khelif was disqualified from last year’s world championships after they failed gender eligibility tests.\n\nHowever they were cleared to compete in Paris, setting the stage for one of the biggest controversies of the Games.\n\n“I am fully qualified to take part, I am a woman like any other. I was born a woman, lived a woman and competed as a woman,” said the 25-year-old.\n\n-- Cuban wrestler Mijain Lopez made Olympic history when he became the first athlete to win five consecutive individual golds in the same event, bettering the records of Games icons such as Carl Lewis and Michael Phelps.\n\nThe soon-to-be 42-year-old then placed his shoes in the center of the mat to signify his intention to retire.\n\n“Wrestling has been the love of my life, for all of my life,” he said.\n\n-- Turkish Olympic shooting silver medallist Yusuf Dikec became an overnight sensation for his casual style during competition.\n\nHis eye-catching posture saw the marksman wearing standard glasses, a team T-shirt and with his left hand casually tucked in his pocket.\n\nOther than his pistol, he notably had none of the specialized equipment used by athletes in the hyper-precise event, like headphones, special lenses or a hat.\n\n“The name’s Dikec. Yusuf Dikec,” said a social media post in reference to cinema icon James Bond.\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Test captain Shan Masood this week clarified that no member of the current national squad is involved in match-fixing, saying that his players are intent on winning the upcoming series against Bangladesh and other nations.\n\nPakistani cricketers in the past have been involved in match-fixing and spot-fixing controversies. The most high-profile fixing incident that rocked Pakistan cricket took place in 2010 when the International Cricket Council (ICC) banned former Pakistan captain Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir and Mohammad Asif after a tribunal found them guilty of spot-fixing during the Lord’s Test in 2010.\n\nA Pakistani high court judge in 2000 recommended a life ban on former captain Salim Malik for his involvement in match-fixing. The same judge also fined legendary Pakistani cricketers Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed, Saeed Anwar and recommended to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) not to give Akram and Ahmed positions of responsibility again in a detailed report.\n\nDuring a press conference on Sunday, a journalist asked Masood if he would give any message to the players after javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem’s historic Olympic triumph. The reporter mentioned that bringing glory to the nation can reward players much more than they can earn through match-fixing and other illicit activities.\n\n“I will never question any player’s intentions,” Masood responded. “You used the word match-fixing. I don’t think there is anything that points toward match-fixing in the current Pakistan setup or the current Pakistan cricketers.”\n\nPakistan cricket team’s dismal performance came under the spotlight during the T20 World Cup 2024 in June this year, when the green shirts crashed out of the group stage of the tournament after losing to minnows the United States and arch-rivals India.\n\n“Whatever happened in the World Cup, it happened. It is now in the past,” Masood said. “You always have to move forward.”\n\nThe first Test between the two sides will be played on Aug. 21 in Rawalpindi followed by the second in Karachi on Aug. 30. About the upcoming series, Masood said Pakistan has a “very good opportunity” to win the upcoming Test matches.\n\n“We have to play our own style of cricket that wins Pakistan matches,” Masood said.\n\nPakistan squad:\n\nShan Masood (c), Saud Shakeel (vc), Aamir Jamal (subject to fitness), Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Kamran Ghulam, Khurram Shahzad, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Ali, Mohammad Huraira, Mohammad Rizwan (wicket-keeper), Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Sarfaraz Ahmed (wk), Shaheen Shah Afridi.\n\nBangladesh squad: Najmul Hossain Shanto (c), Mahmudul Hasan Joy, Zakir Hasan, Shadman Islam, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim, Shakib Al Hasan, Litton Kumar Das, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Taijul Islam, Nayeem Hasan, Nahid Rana, Shoriful Islam, Hasan Mahmud, Taskin Ahmed, Syed Khaled Ahmed\n\nISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday met with Imam of the Prophet’s Mosque, Sheikh Dr. Salah bin Muhammad Al-Budair, in Lahore and told him that his visit would further strengthen relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, Sharif’s office said.\n\nSheikh Dr. Salah bin Muhammad Al-Budair arrived on a seven-day visit to Pakistan on Thursday. Since his arrival, the Imam of Prophet’s Mosque has met President Asif Ali Zardari, Army Chief General Asim Munir, and has led Friday prayers at Shah Faisal Mosque in the federal capital.\n\nDuring their meeting, PM Sharif told Sheikh Salah that his visit was an “honor” for the South Asian country and expressed his best wishes for King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, according to Sharif’s office.\n\n“The people of Pakistan have immense respect for the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques and the Saudi leadership,” Sharif’s office quoted him as telling the Imam of Prophet’s Mosque. “Your visit will further improve relations between the two countries.”\n\nThe Prophet’s Mosque, more popularly known as Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, holds profound historical and spiritual significance in Islam, having been built by the first Muslim community under the supervision of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).\n\nIt is also his last resting place, making imams of this sacred mosque deeply respected across the Muslim world and widely viewed as embodiments of religious devotion and scholarly wisdom.\n\nDuring the meeting, Sheikh Salah expressed his gratitude to the premier for the hospitality accorded to him in Pakistan, according to Sharif’s office. The meeting was also attended by members of PM Sharif’s cabinet and Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Pakistan, Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Malki.\n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia enjoy strong economic, defense and religious ties. The Kingdom is home to over 2.7 million Pakistani expatriates, serving as the top source of remittances for the cash-strapped South Asian country.\n\nPakistan has also been frequently visited by the prayer leader of the Grand Mosque in Makkah in the past. These visits, along with high-level official exchanges, have played a significant role in strengthening the relations between the two countries.\n\nSaudi religious scholars, such as the prayer leaders of the two holy mosques, have fostered closer ties between the two countries, with many of them often taking a special interest in Islamic education and religious institutions in Pakistan.\n\nSheikh Salah is also scheduled to meet prominent Pakistani scholars and visit universities during his stay in the South Asian country."
