Players like myself, Shoaib Malik, and Younis Khan were quite into fitness, and we used to push ourselves. Those who push others out of their limitations are not considered good trainers nor good coaches. Their tummies are visible; their lower are heavy and they can't move. The reason behind this is there has not been a single fitness test, there is no benchmark\"\n\n\"Fitness test level during domestic season becomes a joke. We used to have arguments that we used to say that the standard used for the international level must be used for the domestic level as well.

Misbah is no exception.\n\nApart from Micky Arthur, I don't recall anyone else who really took Pakistan's fitness on - that too only at national level.\n\nHaving said that, Pakistan's fielding isn't disastrous. In fact, its quite good. It only buckles in two situations:\n\n1. When Pakistan take it too easy\n\n2.

Malik saying if he loses a lot for weight, hell also lose his stable base. Wasim saying he doesn't believe that. Then Misbah mentioned yo yo tests and Malik interrupted him saying in other countries like SA the yo yo test is individualized for a player and not sorm generic form everyone has to pass.. Misbah didn't answer that question but went on to emphasize that hiding him in the field would be the biggest problem we would have and the runs hell leak will overwhelm any he makes with the bat.\n\nSavak\n\nTest Captain\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 16, 2006\n\nRuns\n\n47,878\n\nPost of the Week\n\n3\n\nSomeone as super fit as Shoaib Malik is, i am surprised to see him spar with Misbah and defending the likes of Harris Sohail, Azam Khan, Imad Wasim for poor fitness.

Misbahs backing and safety first, no aggression has killed the Pakistani team a lot. I rmb in 2019 WC and series before that against England under MA Pakistan was scoring 330+ regularly and not happy with their poor batting efforts. To chase against NzL in a hell wicket to bat was an awesome pieces of display by Babar Hafeez and Haris Sohail after losing the openers early. Suddenly after the WC were Misbah played his dirty politics to become Coach cum selector the team start to trundle to score past 230 and returned to his olden ways for 250 being the new 350 for them, bowlers coming to save every time. He even benched an inform Haider Ali and played his Asif Ali , Danish Aziz, Ifthikar and Khushdhil. Finally Haider Ali became a slogger to say the least. If Misbah is around he will suck all the momentum, attitude, aggression, energy from any team.\n\nask_analyse_act\n\nODI Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nOct 6, 2014\n\nRuns\n\n10,294\n\nMisbah is also a part of this poor planning, when he took over the reigns from Mickey Arthur four years ago.

I was furious to see him in yesterday's show. If he cares so much about Pak cricket, why dont he along with other so called experts work with domestics teams?

In both the tournaments we couldn't even reach Semifinal.I hope people remember 0-4 vs WI and who can forget his legendary innings in Mohali.\n\nI fail to understand how can these mediocre, defensive and timid cricketers of limited overs get invited for analysis who couldn't even achieve half of the what current team has achieved.\n\nKianig89\n\nSenior Test Player\n\nJoined\n\nOct 30, 2012\n\nRuns\n\n26,863\n\nAsad Shafiq Umar Akmal U Salahuddin Muhammad Talha Usman Shinwari too name a few, all played under Misbah but he failed to groom any of them instead who can forget the legendary selections by Misbah ul Haq.\n\nAwais Zia, Rafatullah, Tanvir Ahmed, Shakeel Ansar, Muhammad Salman\n\ndeltexas\n\nLocal Club Star\n\nJoined\n\nNov 1, 2022\n\nRuns\n\n1,739\n\nUnder Misbah's captaincy in white ball, we played Champions Trophy 2013 and World cup 2015.

Why didn't he do anything that he suggests when he was the captain coach and selector?? That mohali innings was legendary. I mean as an Ind supporter I didn't mind at all as it helped Ind win but boy if you are a Pak supporter that was an absolute disgrace. Scoring runs and hitting 6s after the match is done and dusted was pathetic.\n\nAnd his 2007 scoop was the shot which pretty much made Pak have a mental block against Ind if not for a very long time probably forever. There was no more fear factor associated with Pak anymore for Ind.. yes 2017 CT final was an exception but that anxious psyche was never regained.. Man I used to like watching Pak cricket pre 2007 and used to be thrilled and excited when Ind beat Pak but post 2007 after Misbah there was no fun or excitement like before.. Again Babar azam for all his faults atleast put people on seats and made Pak cricket watchable again. And all the previous Pak cricketers are simply piling up on Babar when they actually had worse records with better teams..\n\nNikhil_cric\n\nSenior Test Player\n\nJoined\n\nDec 4, 2011\n\nRuns\n\n26,598\n\nMisbah was exposed as a poor reader of the game during the last World Cup.\n\nAfter the thrashing at the hands of the West Indies , during post match analysis on ESPNcricinfo, Raunak Kapoor asked what was the issue with PAK batting and Misbah kept blaming PAK bowlers for not bowling the right length.\n\nIt was absolutely comical.

He sent Umar Akmal back from the 2017 CT for poor fitness. He is now allowing a fat Imam ul Haq to play for Pakistan unchallenged.\n\n@Markhor had a fantastic posted earlier in the thread where he pointed out how the 2017-2018 was the fittest pakistani team with the best catching percentage in the world.\n\nI reckon this also coincided with Rixon’s stint as fielding coach.\n\nThe same players today look unfit and are dropping catches like no tomorrow. Mickey’s second tenure has been absolutely toothless. Not sure if this toothlessness has to do with him double dipping or Babar having absolute authority.\n\nSlim\n\nT20I Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nApr 18, 2018\n\nRuns\n\n6,353\n\nMisbah was exposed as a poor reader of the game during the last World Cup.\n\nAfter the thrashing at the hands of the West Indies , during post match analysis on ESPNcricinfo, Raunak Kapoor asked what was the issue with PAK batting and Misbah kept blaming PAK bowlers for not bowling the right length.\n\nIt was absolutely comical.

The same way sohaib Akhtar makes perfect sense on social media.\n\nHowever these 2 don't implement any changes made, they are the definition of all talk no action.\n\nWhen eoin Morgan made comments in 2015 and said what the problem was, and highlighted everything, you can clearly see how he implemented it which led to 2019 all star England team.\n\nMisbah may be making Morgan esc comments but unlike Morgan he will never implement them.

In on the the interviews, he defended his slow approach by claiming that everytime he walks out they are 20-3 then he bails them out to 220 and when he gets out then they get dismissed for 240. Pak batters may not have been setting the world on fire but they were not this bad. Such statements show that he had no faith in his batters.

To say stuff to please the masses while on TV. We all know what kind of safety approach was taken by having Kamran Akmal keep. What was happening when Imran Farhat was opening? What was Asad Shafiq doing playing LOI? Nothing made sense during the Misbah days.\n\nYes that England 4-0 series i rmb he played Imran Farhat, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq and Younis Khan in the top 4 along with Hafeez as the opener... He rotated these 4 and when he lost 3-0 in the final match he promoted Umar Akmal and Shoaib Malik ahead of him and also he was desperate to save his face against the whitewash he played 1 seamer in Junaid Khan and 4 spinners (Ajmal, Rehman, Afridi and Hafeez) yet cant post a score of 250+, KP sealed it with a big century 130\n\nask_analyse_act\n\nODI Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nOct 6, 2014\n\nRuns\n\n10,294\n\nYup, that was his propaganda piece.

Malik complained that during Misbah's time, the Fitness tests were unplanned and that they should not be held during the middle of the series where the players got exhausted before they went out to play in the middle.\n\nMisbah countered that in his opinion, fitness tests should be held daily because if a player is working hard on his fitness training wise and his nutrition, then he should not be unable to clear the fitness tests on a daily basis, the ideal system should be that the players should be asked to give their fitness tests daily and only then allowed to participate in the nets after passing the fitness tests, you have to work on your training, fitness every day so that passing the fitness test every day should be a piece of cake for you, your aim should be to be the best version of yourself from a fitness, athletic point of view and the goal should not necessarily be to just do the bare minimum to just just barely pass the fitness test. All those who are complaining about getting fatigued because of the fitness tests being held during the middle of the series are just making excuses, if you cannot handle running of 15 minutes daily, 8 minutes sprinting daily and 6 bench-presses at body weight, if you cannot handle these bare minimum requirements then how will you meet the standards required in international cricket? Every player is told what the requirements are, when the fitness tests will be held e.t.c.\n\nask_analyse_act\n\nODI Debutant\n\nJoined\n\nOct 6, 2014\n\nRuns\n\n10,294\n\n@Markhor had a fantastic posted earlier in the thread where he pointed out how the 2017-2018 was the fittest pakistani team with the best catching percentage in the world.\n\nI reckon this also coincided with Rixon’s stint as fielding coach.\n\nThe same players today look unfit and are dropping catches like no tomorrow.

He made an in-form Haider ali to warm the bench an entire tour of England then giving him the last T20 , he took Abdullah Shafique as backup opener and then made Rizwan open the inns in the T20...
