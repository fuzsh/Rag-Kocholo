        "text": "Starting with the first-ever Test match on the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1877 and finishing with the latest new venue to be used when Australia played Bangladesh in Cairns two years ago, there are or were, if my adding is correct, 91 grounds worldwide on which Tests have been played. I reckon that I have either played or watched international cricket on about two-thirds of them. Never in Multan though, something that will be rectified in a couple of weeks when I take my place in the press box there to report on England's first Test of the winter against Pakistan.\n\nWhat are we to expect from this city in the southern Punjab? Contrasting things have been written. In verse for example it is a city of \"dust, heat, beggars and burial grounds\", a view that probably did not emanate from the Multan city council's PR department and is probably the equivalent of using Charles Dickens' writing about London in a travel supplement. But a website rather more cheerily promotes it as the city of saints, shrines and mangoes, which if you happen to be particularly into saints, shrines and mangoes (personally I'm not bothered with the first two but the fruit is messy but nice) sounds a whole lot better. Anyway, a journalist friend who has been there says it is \"OK\"- that is good enough for me.\n\nUnquestionably it gets hot there. The rehydration techniques of the England side, prolific even at home, could be something to behold with the scamper to the dressing room for a pee in itself using more fluid than they can take on board. This alongside the almost total lack of interest in Test cricket from the citizens of Multan and consequent echoingly empty ground, could make the Test a soporific occasion.\n\nHowever, this makes the prospect of watching Inzy on his own territory all the more appetising. Now I have to come clean here. Inzamam-ul-Haq, the Sultan of Multan, is right up there with my favourite all-time cricketers. It is not only his batting, which at its languid best can make Marcus Trescothick's footwork seem like a qualification for a starring role in Riverdance, but the whole way he approaches being in the game's top echelon. He is the absolute antithesis to the gym culture into which everyone must now buy: burp rather than beep test. He is generally impassive, immovable if given out lbw (in one Test we saw the game restart before he had crossed the boundary rope), hates fielding with a passion, has been responsible for more cockups between the wickets than anyone else in cricket history and, with the coach Bob Woolmer, currently forms perhaps the most corpulent management team seen since Warwick Armstrong ran the Australian side on his own.\n\nBut if I would pay good money to watch Inzy bat (although obviously not in a Super Series, where he made a complete tosser of himself having whinged about not getting into the world squad in the first place) then I would fork out double to watch him practice. Five years ago, before the final Test in Karachi, we were given a demonstration of what it is like to be a special case, one for whom the rules are bent.\n\nPakistan, then under Javed Miandad's tutelage, began their session with warm-ups and some strenuous training. It all bypassed Inzy, who had yet to leave the airconditioning of the dressing room. Fielding drills followed, during which he emerged, tracksuited and padded up. He wandered across to a large wicker chair by the nets and slumped down to observe the efforts of his team-mates.\n\nThen came a net session that he also viewed nonchalantly for a while before deciding it was time for a spot of batting. So he unzipped his top, removed it, placed his green Pakistan helmet on his head, and strolled into the nearest net, where for 20 minutes he proceeded to bat like a prince, before deciding enough was enough. Out he came, collecting his extraneous gear on the way, and disappeared back to the dressing room, not to be seen again. Next day, of course, he made a century.\n\nGatting relives torrid series\n\nThe news that Mike Gatting is to front a BBC documentary about previous England tours to Pakistan is, like Chris Broad becoming an International Cricket Council match referee, not without its irony given that his own tour there as captain in 1987 was England's most rancorous since the Bodyline tour of Australia. From the first Test in Lahore, where England cried foul, through to the Shakoor Rana affair in Faisalabad and the final match in Karachi, his side (in the face of provocation, it is true) had scarcely acted with decorum, something that senior players were aware of.\n\nSo there were a few glum faces but general acceptance when, as the squad was preparing to return home, rumours arrived that Raman Subba Row, chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board (as it then was), was going to fine the team Â£1,000 each. \"It [hasn't been] great,\" moaned the off-spinner John Emburey to no one in particular, \"but a grand is a bit fucking steep in my view.\"\n\nCame the response: \"No mate, he's giving you a bonus.\" Neither before nor since have I ever seen a look of such incredulity."
