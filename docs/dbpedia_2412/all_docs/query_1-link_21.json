        "text": "My sources are the British Indian censuses.\n\npost 'em again please..\n\nYours are simply hearsay by some journalist. 15 million is a ridiculously exagerrated figure invented by some journalist to try and wow his audience. The most accurate data is census data, and that is what I've used. Your links don't prove anything.\n\nYeah BBC is now crap and Hindutva is correct..\n\nWell you might wish it..But it's not true. Every population is mixed to a degree. There are no pure ones. Genetics clearly proves this. Some Pashtuns, mainly those on the Pak-Afghan border are quite unmixed. Some on the fringes of the area are mixed..as with anyone else.\n\nPossible.. but the bloodlines of Indians are generally very pure.. there are centuries old records...Gothra, jatti etc..\n\nI actually have been saying all along that you will get instances of very Persian looking Pakistanis, or Indian looking Pakistani, or Afghan looking Pakistanis and so on. However averages are important, and this average defines the Pakistani look.\n\nWhat is Indian looking.. please post a foto of a person if you think he is Indian looking..\n\nLooking at the cricket team, I would say Misbah ul Haq is Persian looking,\n\nAlright he is fairer than an avg Pakistani..\n\nKamran Akmal is Indian looking,\n\nHe is outright ugly..\n\nand what is Indian looking...\n\nI go 500kms south and I see different faces than what I am used too..\n\nYounis Khan is Afghan looking,\n\ncool\n\nSalman Butt is somewhere in between (a mix),\n\nmix between whom?\n\nAfridi is Afghan looking, and so on. It's difficult to place the other players, as I havent seen much of them.\n\nTry having a look at then tell me this player looks Pakistani..\n\nThe Pathan is the only one I know. Irfan Pathan looks very Indian. He doesn't even look Pakistani Punjabi or Sindhi. He looks like he's from Uttar Pradesh, but definitely not Pathan looking.\n\nSo noe Indian looking = Uttar Pradesh looking??\n\nThe fact is that Indian looking for a westerner is the same.. for me I can make out the difference..\n\nI'm Mr Brown in your words, not Mr White Color is unimportant though. You just seem to be desperate to prove Indians and Pakistanis are alike.\n\nNah.. I am countering the fact that you are saying that all\n\nINdians are Same looking..\n\nAll pakistanis are fair.,,\n\nIndians cannot be fair\n\nPakistanis don't look similar to any Indians..\n\nthere is a propaganda by Indians to appear white..\n\nBhaijaan watch south Indian movies which cater to 30-40% of the population or Bhojpuri+Bengali Movies which cater to further 30-40% of the population and then counter the propaganda of Bollywood geared for the rest 20% of the population...\n\nLook at\n\nIshant Sharma, Vikram SIngh, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajhan Singh, Gautam Gambhir they are Punjabis..\n\nRP Singh, Praveen Singh, MS Dhoni are Rajputs..\n\nZaheer Khan Irfan Pathan are Pathans.. though Irfan looks different I agree that much\n\nWasim Jaffer Sachin Tendulkar Rohit Sharma rahul Dravid are Marathis\n\nMunaf Patel is Gujarati\n\nRobin Uthapa Anil Kumble are Kannada\n\nVVS Laxman is Telugu/Hyderabadi\n\nMurali and Dinesh Karthick are Tamil...\n\nPlease have a look at them and then point out if all Indians look at the same.. are dark or generally try to show that they are fair etc..\n\nYeah BBC is now crap and Hindutva is correct..\n\nCensus data is correct. They are not figures from the Hindutva\n\nPossible.. but the bloodlines of Indians are generally very pure.. there are centuries old records...Gothra, jatti etc..\n\nRubbish. Hardly anyone is pure, especially the Indians.\n\nWhat is Indian looking.. please post a foto of a person if you think he is Indian looking..\n\nAlright he is fairer than an avg Pakistani..\n\nIn fact Persians aren't so fair. Refer to the skin color map. Slightly fairer on average perhaps again, but some Persians I've seen could pass for even Indian.\n\nThe fact is that Indian looking for a westerner is the same.. for me I can make out the difference..\n\nI agree. So?\n\nNah.. I am countering the fact that you are saying that all\n\nINdians are Same looking..\n\nAll pakistanis are fair.,,\n\nIndians cannot be fair\n\nPakistanis don't look similar to any Indians..\n\nthere is a propaganda by Indians to appear white..\n\nWhich of course isn't what I said. I said ON AVERAGE Pakistanis will be fairer than North Indians, as proved by the commonly accepted skin color maps. Quit trolling. The last two statements of what you say are true on average.\n\nBhaijaan watch south Indian movies which cater to 30-40&#37; of the population or Bhojpuri+Bengali Movies which cater to further 30-40% of the population and then counter the propaganda of Bollywood geared for the rest 20% of the population...\n\nLook at\n\nIshant Sharma, Vikram SIngh, Virender Sehwag, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajhan Singh, Gautam Gambhir they are Punjabis..\n\nHe looks Indian to me..perhaps Tamil.\n\nI could go on..\n\nZaheer Khan Irfan Pathan are Pathans.. though Irfan looks different I agree that much\n\nWasim Jaffer Sachin Tendulkar Rohit Sharma rahul Dravid are Marathis\n\nMunaf Patel is Gujarati\n\nRobin Uthapa Anil Kumble are Kannada\n\nVVS Laxman is Telugu/Hyderabadi\n\nMurali and Dinesh Karthick are Tamil...\n\nPlease have a look at them and then point out if all Indians look at the same.. are dark or generally try to show that they are fair etc..\n\nIn Bollywood they do for sure. Look there's many different factors that will affect a cricket team selection. One of them being you need a lot of time to waste, which would indicate priveledged backgrounds for each, would again indicate the Indian players would be of higher caste.\n\nBut anyway, just for comparison.\n\nHow does he look Pathan? He looks Indian. Because he's mixed.\n\nCensus data is correct. They are not figures from the Hindutva\n\nwell here are some more figures from academicians\n\nDemographic data, for example, are scanty indeed. The governments\n\nof the Indian Union and of Pakistan have had little time to gather and\n\npublish statistics.\n\nIn the meantime one must depend on\n\nthe 1931 and 1941 censuses, whose usefulness as sources of information\n\nconcerning the two countries considered separately is limited by four\n\ncircumstances. (I) Publication of the 1941 census had to be curtailed\n\ndrastically because of the war. Such volumes as have been published\n\n(representing only a small fraction of the data collected) are but thin\n\nwraiths compared to the large and comprehensive ones published for\n\neach previous census in a magnificent series beginning in 1872. (2) In\n\nthe award separating Pakistan from the Union of India, the boundary\n\ncut through certain districts. Since in the census volumes the statistics\n\nare not generally cross-tabulated for areas smaller than districts, the\n\nnumbers and kinds of people living on each side of the boundary in\n\nthe divided districts have to be estimated. (3) Certain of the princely\n\nstates have until recently been in dispute, and Kashmir still is in dispute.\n\n(4) Use of the 1941 census to deduce current population characteristics\n\nin India and Pakistan is affected by the mass migration which\n\noccurred after partition. Since accurate statistics on this migration\n\ncould not be compiled, the roughest sort of estimates must be utilized.\n\nKingsley Davis, 1949, India and Pakistan:\n\nThe Demography of Partition\n\nTherefore the census of 1941 was a guesstimate putting it kindly..\n\nRubbish. Hardly anyone is pure, especially the Indians.\n\nQuote a source... I don't trust your hate propaganda..\n\nEveryone said that the person to talk to if I wanted to understand the genealogies and the lineages was Pandit Harinandan Jha. He became my principal informant, the priest-expert who is the keeper of the genealogies of the Khandavala Dynasty and all the Srotriyas. Only he has a complete understanding of the system of patrilineages and the rules of marriage which determine the rank of the offspring. No Srotriya can marry without his permission. He maintains the genealogical records which proves a family's good bloodlines going back 24 generations\n\nHe taught me about the lineages of the Brahmans, how their records are maintained, how he goes about certifying that a proposed marriage is not incestuous, and how he writes the certificate on behalf of the maharaja which allows a marriage to proceed.\n\nInterview with the Genealogist\n\nThere you go I suggest if you want to go actually academically try to prove that Indians are whatever then I suggest you interview and critically examine his records.. instead of picking up bits and pieces of info from at times Islamic or Hindutva sites.. don't trash your fine brain think tank..\n\nDying, Death and Bereavement in a ... - Google Book Search\n\nThe priest came with an enormous scroll my parents had told me about. It contained the record of my father&#8217;s past trip to Haridwar, as well as all of his father&#8217;s trips, as well as that of his father&#8217;s father&#8217;s trips, and his too! The scroll went back in time more than two hundred years and had recorded the visits of more than 10 generations of my ancestors before us.\n\nBHARAT CHOPRA'S FIRST BLOG - Ma's passing : IntentBlog\n\nAshish Sharma Pawan, 28, a priest in Haridwar, northern India, records in a 144-year-old book the genealogies of families visiting the ancient city to pay homage to their dead.. ((Emily Wax - The Washington Post) )\n\nWith Pen and Paper, a Hindu Priest Helps Pilgrims Trace Their Past - washingtonpost.com\n\nthere 1st. Pandits check the gothras etc. and bloodlines are kept pure.\n\n2nd all the past ancestors are recorded.. in some more orthodox families upto centuries..\n\nas an academician you should come here and check them out..\n\nIn fact Persians aren't so fair. Refer to the skin color map. Slightly fairer on average perhaps again, but some Persians I've seen could pass for even Indian.\n\nso???\n\nSome Indians can pass of for Persians..\n\nbut on an average Persians are fairer than people from the subcontinent..\n\nyour maps are old and flawed as per academicians..\n\nI agree. So?\n\nthis proves Your fixation with the fact you think you are fair and so are your countrymen is obsessive and stems from insecurities..\n\nWhich of course isn't what I said. I said ON AVERAGE Pakistanis will be fairer than North Indians, as proved by the commonly accepted skin color maps.\n\nall your maps.. are crappy..\n\nI have given a list of critiques..\n\nshall I post 'em again..\n\nQuit trolling.\n\nWhat trolling? you are the one giving me advice on threads where it is not reqd like the begum one and also in the suggestion thread you came in unwanted and started attacking..\n\nthanks..\n\nThe last two statements of what you say are true on average.\n\nWell this is what you believe and is false..\n\nHe looks Indian to me..perhaps Tamil.\n\nNot to me..\n\ndinesh karthick and murali karthick are tamil players they don't look like Sehwag.. thanks for proving your inexperience..\n\nI could go on..\n\nbe my guest..\n\nwhat does Sohaib AKhtar look like?\n\nKamran Akmal?\n\nMohamaed Yousuf?\n\nSami?\n\nIftikhar Anjum?\n\nSarfaraz Ahmad?\n\ncheers\n\nIn Bollywood they do for sure. Look there's many different factors that will affect a cricket team selection.\n\nOne of them being you need a lot of time to waste, which would indicate priveledged backgrounds for each, would again indicate the Indian players would be of higher caste.\n\nI think talent counts for a lot as well..\n\nthey would not delibrately pick up people from high caste if they didn't perform ..\n\nthis is ridiculous..\n\nthere are 3 sikhs in the team out of 18.. shows 161&#37; of the players in the team are Sikhs though SIkhs just make up only 2% of Indian population\n\nthere are 4 muslims in the playing 18 which is shows that 22.5% of the players are muslims .. though in India muslims are just 15% of the populations\n\nthere are a total of 6 punjabis in the team representing 33% of the team in which punjabi population is 6% of the Indina population..\n\ncheers..\n\nBut anyway, just for comparison.\n\nHow does he look Pathan? He looks Indian. Because he's mixed.\n\nYep he is most definetly mixed.. so??\n\nhe will look similar to any kid/grandkid of a Pashtun married to a Subcontinental woman..\n\nPS: Define an Indian & Pakistani look please... for starters...\n\nwell here are some more figures from academicians\n\nDemographic data, for example, are scanty indeed. The governments\n\nof the Indian Union and of Pakistan have had little time to gather and\n\npublish statistics.\n\nIn the meantime one must depend on\n\nthe 1931 and 1941 censuses, whose usefulness as sources of information\n\nconcerning the two countries considered separately is limited by four\n\ncircumstances.

Totally agree, and I have been saying this all along.\n\nTherefore the census of 1941 was a guesstimate putting it kindly..\n\nYes, but it is the most accurate information available.\n\nQuote a source...

Only he has a complete understanding of the system of patrilineages and the rules of marriage which determine the rank of the offspring. No Srotriya can marry without his permission. He maintains the genealogical records which proves a family's good bloodlines going back 24 generations\n\nHe taught me about the lineages of the Brahmans, how their records are maintained, how he goes about certifying that a proposed marriage is not incestuous, and how he writes the certificate on behalf of the maharaja which allows a marriage to proceed.\n\nInterview with the Genealogist\n\nThere you go I suggest if you want to go actually academically try to prove that Indians are whatever then I suggest you interview and critically examine his records.. instead of picking up bits and pieces of info from at times Islamic or Hindutva sites.. don't trash your fine brain think tank..\n\nDying, Death and Bereavement in a ... - Google Book Search\n\nThe priest came with an enormous scroll my parents had told me about. It contained the record of my father&#8217;s past trip to Haridwar, as well as all of his father&#8217;s trips, as well as that of his father&#8217;s father&#8217;s trips, and his too! The scroll went back in time more than two hundred years and had recorded the visits of more than 10 generations of my ancestors before us.\n\nBHARAT CHOPRA'S FIRST BLOG - Ma's passing : IntentBlog\n\nAshish Sharma Pawan, 28, a priest in Haridwar, northern India, records in a 144-year-old book the genealogies of families visiting the ancient city to pay homage to their dead.. ((Emily Wax - The Washington Post) )\n\nWith Pen and Paper, a Hindu Priest Helps Pilgrims Trace Their Past - washingtonpost.com\n\nthere 1st. Pandits check the gothras etc. and bloodlines are kept pure.\n\n2nd all the past ancestors are recorded.. in some more orthodox families upto centuries..\n\nas an academician you should come here and check them out..\n\nI'm not interested to be honest. I know Indians are not super human, unlike your impression of them. I know all populations are mixed to a degree with surrounding populations and ethnic groups, and for sure after millenia of living with each other, people will get mixed to different degrees. How much do you think it would cost to bribe a priest in India for a geneaology tree of one's choice? Not a lot I would suspect.\n\nso???\n\nSome Indians can pass of for Persians..\n\nbut on an average Persians are fairer than people from the subcontinent..\n\nyour maps are old and flawed as per academicians..\n\nPersians are on average a lot fairer than Indians as per the COMMONLY ACCEPTED MAPS BY EVERY ACADEMIC CURRENTLY.\n\nPersians are not much fairer than Pakistanis though. In fact Persians have the same skin color distributions as Pakistanis. Visually there would not be a huge difference, except for those Karachiites and those on the Eastern fringe of Punjab and Sindh.\n\nthis proves Your fixation with the fact you think you are fair and so are your countrymen is obsessive and stems from insecurities..\n\nI agree that Westerners cant tell Indians apart. How does that prove I have a fixation that I think I am fair?\n\nall your maps.. are crappy..\n\nI have given a list of critiques..\n\nshall I post 'em again..\n\nI explained that your maps are either predictions, or they show the exact same data as the Basutti map I posted. No difference. Post the maps again if you like, I will answer it the same way I answered them last time, and prove you wrong.\n\nWhat trolling? you are the one giving me advice on threads where it is not reqd like the begum one and also in the suggestion thread you came in unwanted and started attacking..\n\nthanks..\n\nWell this is what you believe and is false..\n\nIt is not false to say Bollywood projects India to be much fairer skinned and European acting than it really is. Even Imran Khan agrees. And Indians don't look the same as Pakistanis. I've proved it with a scientific map the wider academic community accepts.\n\nNot to me..\n\ndinesh karthick and murali karthick are tamil players they don't look like Sehwag.. thanks for proving your inexperience..\n\nIf that is Sehwag on the front cover of TIME he looks very Indian to me, even though he's wearing Western clothes.\n\nbe my guest..\n\nLol, waste of time.\n\nwhat does Sohaib AKhtar look like?\n\nKamran Akmal?\n\nMohamaed Yousuf?\n\nSami?\n\nIftikhar Anjum?\n\nSarfaraz Ahmad?\n\ncheers\n\nWell Iftikhan Anjum doesn't look Indian to me, unless you need glasses.\n\nHe could even pass for Iranian.\n\nSarfraz Ahmed doesn't look Indian to me either .. he's just a kid anyway, so it's difficult to tell. I'd put him perhaps Eastern Punjabi, or from the fringe of India or mixed a bit.\n\nAkmal perhaps could pass for Indian.\n\nSami, no. Moyo no, though no far off the sort of North West Indian look, Shoaib Akhtar, no because of his build.\n\nSohail Tanvir, Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi, Misbah Ul Haq, Inzamam, Yasir Hameed, all under no circumstances look Indian. They are clearly very different.\n\nAnyhow these individual examples are useless. On average, you will find the Pak team does not have similar features to the Indian team. I would say for a start that aside from facial features the Indians are on average much less well built. That is evident in the stature of the fast bowlers.\n\nYep he is most definetly mixed.. so??\n\nhe will look similar to any kid/grandkid of a Pashtun married to a Subcontinental woman..\n\nPS: Define an Indian & Pakistani look please... for starters...\n\nSo that is the mid way to an Indian look. If you can imagine Irfan Pathan but slightly darker and perhaps a weaker build, smaller head, then that would be the Indian look.\n\nAttachments\n\n52a72fc7dec038073abb2531089f2666.jpg\n\nSo the census figures which I quoted are the only estimates that one can use to estimate the number of people who migrated at partition. Totally agree, and I have been saying this all along.\n\nYes, but it is the most accurate information available.\n\nRR for 5 mins think from the other POV would you like people to believe info that is incorrect??\n\nI'm not interested to be honest. I know Indians are not super human, unlike your impression of them.\n\nSuperhumans hardly.. but neither are they sub-human..\n\nI know all populations are mixed to a degree with surrounding populations and ethnic groups, and for sure after millenia of living with each other, people will get mixed to different degrees. How much do you think it would cost to bribe a priest in India for a geneaology tree of one's choice? Not a lot I would suspect.\n\nWell if they could be bribed to throw away centuries year old record books is akin to saying a Mullah may be bribed to let a kafir in with pork in Mecca..\n\nPersians are on average a lot fairer than Indians as per the COMMONLY ACCEPTED MAPS BY EVERY ACADEMIC CURRENTLY.\n\nwhich map..? post it.. and I'll post a critique of it..\n\nthough agreeably irresp of the map as per empirical evidence Persians are fairr than any sub-continental people..\n\nPersians are not much fairer than Pakistanis though. In fact Persians have the same skin color distributions as Pakistanis. Visually there would not be a huge difference, except for those Karachiites and those on the Eastern fringe of Punjab and Sindh.\n\nPersians are fairer than Punjabis, Mohajirs and Sindhis..\n\nas for Pashtuns, Balochs, Tajiks etc.. they share a similar colour tone..\n\nI agree that Westerners cant tell Indians apart.How does that prove I have a fixation that I think I am fair?\n\nQuite elementary.. actually most of your posts are a fixation on colour..\n\nI explained that your maps are either predictions, or they show the exact same data as the Basutti map I posted. No difference. Post the maps again if you like, I will answer it the same way I answered them last time, and prove you wrong.\n\nwhat?? your maps are incorrect.. and I posted other maps as well with shortcomings though Have a look at EBritannica's skin color map..\n\nIt is not false to say Bollywood projects India to be much fairer skinned and European acting than it really is. Even Imran Khan agrees.\n\nBollywood of India as I said targets mostly North India which have fairer people than rest of India.. and what about the dark famous actors??\n\nYeah now we follow what Imran Khan says and produce bastard kids.\n\nthough if you worship him.. he says in the extended clip that Pakistanis are also doing the same these days. cheers.\n\nAnd Indians don't look the same as Pakistanis. I've proved it with a scientific map the wider academic community accepts.\n\nLook??\n\nyeah post the Basutti Map again.. it is full of misinfo and is rejected as it is inconclusive and incorrect..\n\nIf that is Sehwag on the front cover of TIME he looks very Indian to me, even though he's wearing Western clothes.\n\nDefine INdian looking..\n\nyou can make an algorith or some thing by which a person can be conclusively proved as Indian...\n\nBy this then some of the Pakistanis are Indian looking and some of the Indians are Pakistani looking..\n\nLol, waste of time.\n\nWell actually..\n\nWell Iftikhan Anjum doesn't look Indian to me, unless you need glasses.\n\nHe could even pass for Iranian.\n\nHe looks like a typical paindu Punjabi or any other north indian.. not Iranian..\n\nthough by his build he is not a Pakistani as you explain below\n\nSarfraz Ahmed doesn't look Indian to me either\n\nWell he is a Mohajir..\n\nAkmal perhaps.\n\nbecause he is ugly innit?\n\nSami, no.\n\nhe is a mohajir.. though to me he looks a part Nepalese/Pahari ancestry..\n\nMoyo no, though no far off the sort of North West Indian look,\n\nMo Yo looks like a typical Punjabi or North Indian..\n\nShoaib Akhtar, no because of his build.\n\nBuild?? eat steroids and make your build..\n\nthanks for showing your shallowness...\n\nthese guys will look Pakistanis to you as well then?\n\nor these guys?\n\nSohail Tanvir, Younis Khan, Shahid Afridi, Misbah Ul Haq, Inzamam, Yasir Hameed, all under no circumstances look Indian. They are clearly very different.\n\nInzaman looks like a typical well built tall Jatt of India..\n\nhere is a fattier version of Haq..\n\nSohail Tavir also looks like some Sikhs esp of West Punjab.. because of the Nose.\n\nUmar Gul. Younis Khan, Yasir, Shahid look like Indian Kashmiris because of the nose and skin tone..\n\nAnyhow these individual examples are useless. On average, you will find the Pak team does not have similar features to the Indian team. I would say for a start that aside from facial features the Indians are on average much less well built. That is evident in the stature of the fast bowlers.\n\nSee know you are talking..\n\nPakistani players have 3 distinct groups\n\nPunjabis, Pashtuns and Mohajirs\n\nPashtuns have no similarity with rest of the Pakistani players and/ior Indian players largely..\n\nPunjabi and Mohajir players are similar in appearance to North Indian players...\n\nNorth Indian players are different from others regional players etc..\n\nBuild is something inherent\n\nAkhtar is Punjabi well built.. anjum is punjabi kiddish build..\n\nso it depends on genetics and drugs in case of akhtar..\n\nSo that is the mid way to an Indian look. If you can imagine Irfan Pathan but slightly darker and perhaps a weaker build, smaller head, then that would be the Indian look.\n\nRacist.. hahaha.."
