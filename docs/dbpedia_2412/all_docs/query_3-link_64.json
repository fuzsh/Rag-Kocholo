        "text": "KINGSTON, Jamaica â€” The Jamaican police have concluded that the coach of Pakistan's cricket team, who was found dead in his hotel room after his team lost a critical match in the sport's World Cup here, was strangled.\n\nThe final pathology report on the coach, Bob Woolmer, 58, blamed \"asphyxia as a result of manual strangulation\" for his death early Sunday.\n\nDeputy Police Commissioner Mark Shields said Thursday that there had been no signs of struggle inside the room. He told BBC Radio, \"It's difficult to believe it would have been a complete stranger. At this stage if looks as if it may be somebody somehow linked to him.\"\n\nShields also said that because Woolmer was a big man, it might have taken more than one person to subdue the coach.\n\nPolice Commissioner Lucius Thomas said in a statement, \"It is our belief that those associated with or having access to Woolmer may have vital information that would assist this inquiry.\"\n\nThe police interviewed and fingerprinted Pakistani players and team officials throughout Thursday but said they had no suspects and were not investigating anybody in particular.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
