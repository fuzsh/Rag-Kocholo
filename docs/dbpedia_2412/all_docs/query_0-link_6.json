        "text": "I am guessing he wanted to say \"alag quom\" ..but ended up saying \"tagdi quom\"\n\nThe utterly low IQ of Pak Punjabis compared to all the states in India is a sure shot indicator of that.\n\nImagine comparing the brilliance of a South Indian or a business acumen of a Gujarati or Marwari to this low IQ \"quom\"\n\n40 minutes ago, rangeelaraja said:\n\nI am sorry but for someone who wants to boycott anything pakistan you follow anything pakistan way too passionately.\n\nAs far as Akthar goes , not for a second ill believe his is a person with low IQ, he is an entertainer, he will say whatever his immediate audience wants to hear from him. To be honest i am fine with his approach cause most of us at work do what it takes to remain relevant. Never take Akhtar seriously.\n\nPakistani Punjabis have to be the most retarded race on the planet. Infact I'd say anyone living between west of Ravi and Hindukush is a bonafide retard anyway.\n\nA mixed hybrid place with no distinct culture of their own. Almost everyone out there is a product of mass raping.\n\nThe said region bore the biggest brunt of Turkic invasions and the repeated humiliation ensured that they could never live with dignity again. This is clearly reflected in their mindset and perception of the world.\n\nI went on a trip to the subcontinent Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Lahore and then Islamabad in 2012. For all the talk I had heard about how improved/developed Urban India had become and how much more civilised India was compared to Pakistan, I didn't see it myself. A couple of my colleagues at work (TCS) didn't like it when I told them this.\n\nSomething that was glaringly obvious to me was there a lot more in common than not in common. The hussle and bussle of the big cities was the same in all them. The touristy places had the same sellers. Beggers were around every corner.\n\nI did encounter the hatred both sides had for each other on a couple of occassions primarily when I told people I watched cricket. I had to shut off the conversations quite quickly because neither side was rational in these conversations.\n\nEvery time I see comments from one side about the other it doesn't suprise me. Both are as bad as each other."
