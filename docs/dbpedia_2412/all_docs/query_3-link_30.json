It would be difficult for me to continue as captain if this unhealthy trend of demoralising the team after a few bad performances continues.\n\nI have no problems playing under anyone.\n\nI do think the ICC has financially helped Afghanistan and Ireland a lot, but I think it’s crucial that the ICC provides these Associate nations with quality coaches to work on their basics.\n\nI don’t have a magic wand, and there is a lot we need to do right in Pakistan cricket to build a strong team.\n\nHandling pressure is the key to doing well in Indo-Pak matches.\n\nIt is not my domain to speak on pitches, but they play an important role in producing quality players in every format.\n\nOnce you start feeling the pressure, you start to struggle. That is the beauty of Indo-Pak cricket contests.\n\nI coached Afghanistan for seven months. Out of those, I spent five and a half away from home.\n\nI’ve never linked team selection to offering prayers, and reports suggesting otherwise are all wrong.\n\nWe must live in peace. It’s necessary.\n\nIn the past, when we toured countries like Australia or South Africa, we struggled, but we also got to learn a lot, and we learnt to cope with pressure.\n\nIn the one-dayers, it boils down to who performs better on the day of the match.\n\nI can’t leave cricket. It is my passion.\n\nWhen I look back and think about it, I feel my career was fairly good but, certainly, not tremendous.\n\nRegardless of where we play, we should play India on regular basis.\n\nAs my parents are from India, I am told a lot of positive things about the country, the culture and traditions of Muslims in India. I don’t remember anything nasty told to me by my parents.\n\nI am not a big supporter of sledging or insults that are hurled at you. But I don’t mind if a bowler glares or stares at the batsmen. During my career, I have faced these situations numerous times.\n\nI control my anger.\n\nWe were able to dominate the world in the ’90s because the World Cup victory completely transformed us and changed our mindset."
