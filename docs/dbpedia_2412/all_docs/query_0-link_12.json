For those of us growing up in the nineties, he was the gentle giant. Even when he smashed Indian bowlers around, one could not help but marvel at his skill with the willow in hand. But he lacked speed when it came to running between wickets. Some of his run outs are so funny they have to be seen to be believed. Don't think we are telling the truth? Take a look:\n\nThere was never a dull moment when he was batting and sometimes a run out was the only way he could be sent back, such was his form more often than not. Sadly, despite his brilliant record with the bat, the stigma of being a slow runner has never left Inzamam. So I guess the only solace he can take from this, if he was so good despite being a bad runner, imagine how deadly he would have been if he had been a good one? Food for thought is it not? You be the judge!\n\nNot known to be the fastest runner between wickets, Inzamam still has a record worthy of mentioning. He has also represented Pakistan in 5 World Cups and played some top-notch innings along the way.\n\nThe name is an institution in Pakistan cricket. The man is an all-time great and a legend in many ways. The only Pakistani with over 10,000 ODI runs, a World Cup Winner and an entertainer to the core.\n\nWho can forget the epic 60 vs New Zealand in the 1992 semifinal or the brilliant 329 against the same opposition in a Test in 2002? It remains the 2nd highest Test score by a Pakistani batter.\n\nThe numbers back him as well."
