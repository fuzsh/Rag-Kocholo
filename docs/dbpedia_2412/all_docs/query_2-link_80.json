        "text": "Former Pakistani cricket captain Inzamam-ul-Haq discussed the disappointing performance of Pakistan's cricket team against Ireland at the T20 World Cup 2024.\n\nEven though Pakistan scraped to victory over the European minnows they were eliminated from the tournament. Defeats against India and USA meant Pakistan could not progress to the Super 8 stage.\n\nIt was a disappointing performance from the former champions and Inzamam pointed out that the \"fear of failure\" seemed to be the main reason behind their lackluster display.\n\nGet the latest sports betting odds on ICC T20 World Cup 2024 here!\n\nDuring the match against Ireland, Pakistan needed 12 runs off 14 balls to win. Despite the relatively small target, they struggled to achieve it. Ireland had set a modest target of 107 runs, and Pakistan's batting lineup faced challenges. Pakistan did win the match, but they won from a situation where the match could have gone either way.\n\nWhat did Inzamam-ul-Haq say about Pakistan cricket team's approach?\n\nInzamam criticized the Pakistani batsmen for their lack of composure. He said that the team’s performance was far below expectations. “We are struggling against teams like Ireland, and that is not acceptable. Our batsmen should have performed much better.”\n\nMore: Is there a rift between Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill?

He highlighted the inclusion of players like Abbas Afridi and Shadab Khan, and questioned the rationale behind these choices. He mentioned, “Why were these players not utilized effectively? The team seems to be overly afraid of making changes, fearing a loss.”\n\n“It looks like the players are so scared of losing that they are not willing to take risks or make bold decisions,” he added. This fear, according to him, led to a lack of aggression and confidence on the field.\n\nInzamam also pointed out the inconsistency in individual performances. He noted that no Pakistani batsman had shown a standout performance in the tournament. “There hasn’t been a single innings where a batsman took control. Our players seem to be playing without any clear strategy.”\n\nWhats next for Pakistan?\n\nInzamam stressed the need for better planning and execution. He said, “Our coaching staff should focus on developing a clear strategy for each player. We need to work on their strengths and weaknesses.” He also emphasized that the team should focus on building confidence rather than being paralyzed by the the fear of losing.\n\nAs Pakistan prepares for future matches, it is essential for the team to address these mental barriers and build a more confident and aggressive approach to the game."
