There are many players in our current line up even who have somewhat of bulging stomach (Tidd). Now I am not asking them to be fit like Kohli or Gill but if I, at 27 years of age, working a 9 to 5 can maintain a flat stomach with 2 hours of gym a week then why cant our players do the same.\n\nFrom my understanding of fitness, you need to be at or above 20% bodyfat to have a visible lower belly. Someone correct me if I am wrong on this.\n\nIs it lethargic attitude when it comes to overall fitness or does cricket, especially batting, require you to have some fat on you.

I maintain 15% BF all year round and you dont even need a super strict diet for that. There is a lot of lee way even when you are 15% BF, like you can have a KFC and multiple ice creams in a week and it wont matter much as long as your caloric intake is within limits.\n\nTo be 20% and above you really need to off the handle. Also, considering our player expend a lot of energy on the field as well, the only sense I can make of it is they are consistently munching on upwards of 3000-3500 calories a day which for a 6 feet tall person, is a lot of food.\n\nsaqib.rai\n\nTape Ball Captain\n\nJoined\n\nSep 6, 2023\n\nRuns\n\n1,027\n\nWhat is up with the inability of our current players to maintain decent levels of body fat.

Even on a bad day, Fakhar saves you 10 runs from the outfield and on a good day, he will get you quick singles that the unfit players might not.\n\nThe problem with unfit players is that if they fail then you are starting with -10 runs at least.\n\nAsad T\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nAug 1, 2023\n\nRuns\n\n3,668\n\nJust look at the commitment of other athletes.

The point is that players have only to gain by maintaining proper fitness.

You need to be well feed and nurtured to be healthy. Starving yourself and trying to maintain the body of Usain Bolt as a cricketer is a very foolish action.\n\nI want to emphasize you need to eat food and alot of it. It is what makes people stronger.\n\nRoti, salan, rice is the best food to eat. Traditional home-style cuisine of Muhajir, Punjab, Pakhtun, etc. has nothing but benefits. It helps with the KHORAQ E KHELARI.\n\nEating American food like burgers, pizzas, fries, noodles, etc. is a curse.

You need to be well feed and nurtured to be healthy. Starving yourself and trying to maintain the body of Usain Bolt as a cricketer is a very foolish action.\n\nI want to emphasize you need to eat food and alot of it. It is what makes people stronger.\n\nRoti, salan, rice is the best food to eat. Traditional home-style cuisine of Muhajir, Punjab, Pakhtun, etc. has nothing but benefits. It helps with the KHORAQ E KHELARI.\n\nEating American food like burgers, pizzas, fries, noodles, etc. is a curse. All should avoid these types of foods.\n\nAll these “fitness gurus” who consume protein shakes, energy drinks, salads are frauds of the biggest degree.\n\n12% body fat is the minimum required to be a high performing athelete. There are no ifs and buts.\n\nSome of these players must be eating 3000 calories a day for dinner if they are burning from training and probably end up eating 5000+ calories a day. I am sure they drink full fat cola and eat fried chicken. Don't some of them smoke too?\n\nIt's just lack of discipline and self respect.

Now there isnt anything wrong with going out to eat but as professional athletes there needs to be some adherence to discipline.\n\nEverybody loves food, there are no 2 ways about it. But you pay a price for munching which can be clearly seen in the case of Azam. In parallel, you have examples like VK and Gill who are gym freaks and treat their bodies like a temple.

A lot of players let themselves go in the off season or when they are away from the team, on social outings and come back with higher body fat percentages. Maybe the PCB should start fining and even dropping players from the team for not meeting minimum standards but sadly we never developed our bench strength to make this possible.\n\nhassan918\n\nAdministrator\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 14, 2018\n\nRuns\n\n4,814\n\nPCT players's fitness is probably the worst when we compare it with the likes of England, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa or ever India. We only have 2-3 players in our XI who we can see are super fit. This is where the management should take more effort to make players fitter so they can perform at their best all the time.\n\nFreakCricket\n\nFirst Class Player\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 17, 2014\n\nRuns\n\n2,620\n\nNo offence but Pakistani cuisine is so oily & fatty.

This are athletes who are representing the country on a global level. As much as I admire bobby, there is no excuse for why his fitness has progressively worsened over time rather than improving. Same is the case for Imam.\n\nI am all for supporting your countrymen but this support shouldnt be that blind that it stops you from calling a spade a spade. AUS, SAF, NZ, ENG cricketers are setting the benchmark for fitness and our players are falling short. I will never criticize the team but being out of form or failing to win something because those things happen. What I cannot stand for as a cricket fan is that players dont even control the stuff that is 100% in their hands.\n\nThis is the same attitude that has led to the downfall of many players. Sarfraz and Imad were quite overweight when they were playing for PCT but the moment they get dropped, they finally find the magic diet and drop 5-10 kilos. Same is the case with Azam Khan. Not everyone can be a Jos Buttler like many at PP want Babar to do, but him not taking fitness seriously is something no fan should stand by, no matter who much you love Babar.\n\nPlaying for Pakistan is not anybody's birth right, even if the player under question is BA. Playing for Pakistan is a privilege and our players need to take it as such.
