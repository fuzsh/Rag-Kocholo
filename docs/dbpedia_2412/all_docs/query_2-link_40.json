        "text": "Former Pakistan cricketer and captain Inzamam-ul-Haq made a bizarre claim that India pacers like Arshdeep Singh have been consistently tampering with the ball in their 2024 T20 World Cup campaign. Inzamam opined that India's bowlers are altering their match balls to ensure reverse swing, hailing that as crucial for their success so far in the tournament. India's star-bowlers like Arshdeep and Jasprit Bumrah have been in top form with the ball, which has often seen them play a decisive role in the side's success in the T20 World Cup.\n\nadvertisement\n\nInzamam and another former Pakistan skipper, Saleem Malik, during a show for Pakistan news channel 24 News HD, drew reference to Arshdeep's reverse swinging deliveries in India's Super 8 clash against Australia on June 24. Both the former cricketers claimed that the 14th or 15th over of a game is a bit too soon for a pacer to get reverse swing on the ball. The first glimpse of Arshdeep getting a hint of reverse swing came in the 16th over of Australia's 205 run chase. The very second ball of that over was missed by both Travis Head and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and went for four byes. Ultimately, the 22-year-old's 3/37 spell played a key role in India's win over their arch-rivals, which booked their place in the T20 World Cup semi-final against England.\n\nT20 World Cup Coverage | Points Table | T20 World Cup 2024 Schedule | Player Stats\n\nSpeaking at the show for 24 News HD, Inzamam shared his bizarre intuition and even received acknowledgement for the same by Saleem Malik.\n\n“ Arshdeep Singh, when he was bowling the 15th over, the ball was reversing. is it too early (for reverse swing) with the new ball? This means the ball was ready for reverse swing by the 12th or the 13th over. Umpires should keep their eyes open (to spot) these things...If it was Pakistani bowlers (reverse swinging the ball) this would have been a big issue. We know reverse swing very well and if Arshdeep can come in the 15th over and start reversing the ball, it means some serious work had been done before,\" Inzamam said.\n\n“Inzy, I always say this, eyes are kept shut when it comes to some teams, and India is one of those teams. I remember in Zimbabwe, when Wasim (Akram) was bowling, he made it wet, and we all were surprised at it; as in how come one side was wet, and when I went and complained I was fined quite heavily,” Malik said in support.\n\nThis is not the first time that former Pakistan cricketers have made surprising accusations against India bowlers, with Hasan Raza claiming that India used some chips inside the ball during the 2023 ODI World Cup, slandering Mohammed Shami's success in that tournament."
