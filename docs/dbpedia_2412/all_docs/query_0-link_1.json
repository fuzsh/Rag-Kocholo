        "text": "Former Indian cricket team spinner, Harbhajan Singh, recently took to social media to express his frustration over a viral interview involving him, narrated by former Pakistan skipper Inzamam Ul Haq. In the interview, Inzamam claimed that Harbhajan was impressed with Maulana Tariq Jameel and even contemplated converting to Islam.\n\nAccording to Inzamam, the cricketers, including Harbhajan, attended prayer sessions led by Maulana Tariq Jameel.\n\n“We had a room where prayers were conducted. Maulana Tariq Jameel used to visit us in the evening and lead us into a namaz. After a few days, Irfan Pathan, Mohammad Kaif, and Zaheer Khan also started coming. Four other Indian cricketers sat and watched us,” Inzamam said in an interview.\n\nALSO READ: India vs New Zealand, Cricket World Cup 2023 Semifinal: India's Record In ODI World Cup Semifinals From 1975 To 2019\n\n“Harbhajan, who was unaware that Tariq Jameel was a maulana, said that ‘I am impressed with this man and want to follow his words',” he added.\n\nThe revelation caused a stir, especially considering Harbhajan's known Sikh background. Harbhajan, known for his on-field aggression, promptly dismissed the story on social media, asserting his pride in being an Indian and Sikh.\n\n“What kind of intoxication substance is he taking? I am a proud Indian and proud Sikh… These people speak all kinds of rubbish,” Harbhajan replied to the viral video on X.\n\nALSO READ: IPL 2024 Auction: Chennai Super Kings To Release Ben Stokes; KKR Likely To Drop Lockie Ferguson\n\nSocial media ignited with opinions on the matter, with some fans criticising Harbhajan, while others rallied behind the veteran spinner, noting that players from Pakistan have been associated with similar incidents in the past.\n\nCheck Reactions-\n\nThe cricketer in the past has had his share of conflicts on the field, notably with Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar, despite their off-field friendship.\n\nThe cricketing world recently witnessed the intensified rift between the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and chief selector Inzamam. The PCB accepted Inzamam's resignation amid allegations of a conflict of interest.\n\n\"Pakistan Cricket Board has accepted Inzamam-ul-Haq's resignation as the chairman of the national men's selection committee and junior selection committee and will announce his replacement in due course,\" PCB said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter)\n\nInzamam, who assumed the role of chairman of the national men's selection committee in August 2023, also recently took charge as chairman of the junior men's selection committee. On the other hand, Harbhajan is currently associated with the Hindi commentary panel in Cricket World Cup 2023."
