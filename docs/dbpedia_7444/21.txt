Babe (also known as Babe the Sheep-Pig in the working title) is a 1995 comedy-drama film directed by Chris Noonan, produced by George Miller and written by both. It is an adaptation of Dick King-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep-Pig, which tells the story of a farm pig who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The film is narrated by Roscoe Lee Browne and the main animal characters are played by both real animals and animatronic puppets.

Babe was filmed in Robertson, New South Wales in 1994 and released theatrically on 4 August 1995, going on to become a critical and commercial success, with several Academy Award nominations. A sequel, Babe: Pig in the City, was released on 25 November 1998 and failed to achieve the same success as the original film.

Storyline[]

Plot[]

Gentle farmer Arthur Hoggett (James Cromwell) wins a piglet named Babe (Christine Cavanaugh) at a county fair. Narrowly escaping his fate as Christmas dinner when Farmer Hoggett decides to show him at the next fair, Babe bonds with motherly border collie Fly (Miriam Margolyes) and discovers that he too can herd sheep. But will the other farm animals, including Fly's jealous husband Rex, accept a pig who doesn't conform to the farm's social hierarchy?

Production[]

Babe is an adaptation of Dick King-Smith's 1983 novel The Sheep-Pig, also known as Babe: The Gallant Pig in the US, which tells the story of a pig raised as livestock who wants to do the work of a sheepdog. The main animal characters are played by a combination of real and animatronic pigs and Border Collies. The breed of pig used was a Large White, which grows rapidly. On account of this, 46 piglets of the required size were used during the course of the filming, as well as the animatronic model for special effects.

The film is divided into six chapters to preserve the storybook-like feel of the original novel (although none of the film's chapters are the same as the book's). The film's mice characters were subsequently added to read the chapters aloud after a test screening in which producer George Miller noted that younger audiences had trouble reading them, needing help from the adults.

After seven years of development, Babe was filmed in Robertson, New South Wales, Australia. The talking-animal visual effects were done by Rhythm & Hues Studios and Jim Henson's Creature Shop. The film was both a box office and critical success, grossing $254 million worldwide and earning seven Oscar nominations, including a win for Best Visual Effects.

According to actor James Cromwell, there was tension on the set between producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan. Noonan later complained, "I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I thought that he tried to take credit for Babe, tried to exclude me from any credit, and it made me very insecure... It was like your guru has told you that you are no good and that is really disconcerting."

Miller shot back, "Chris said something that is defamatory: that I took his name off the credits on internet sites, which is just absolutely untrue. You know, I'm sorry but I really have a lot more to do with my life than worry about that... when it comes to Babe, the vision was handed to Chris on a plate."

Interviewed about the movie in 2020, Cromwell admitted he nearly turned it down, as his character only had about 16 lines. He was persuaded by his friend Charles Keating to take it anyway. Keating told him: "it's a free ticket to Australia, and if the movie tanks, it's not your fault, it's the pig's fault." Cromwell said Noonan wanted him for the part, and won out over Miller, who had wanted to cast an Australian actor. Cromwell's fee was around $50,000. He asked for an increase when he realised the movie was making millions of dollars, but was turned down. Nevertheless, he said "I got a lot out of that film, and it turned my whole life around. I didn't have to audition anymore."

In 1998, a sequel directed by Miller, Babe: Pig in the City, was released. In 2006, a video game of the same name based on the film, was published by Mastertronic for the PlayStation 2.

Reception[]

The film was a box office success, grossing $36.7 million at the box office in Australia and over $254 million worldwide. It also received critical acclaim and was ultimately nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for James Cromwell, Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing, winning Best Visual Effects. At the APRA Music Awards of 1996 it won Best Film Score for Westlake's work. In 2006, the American Film Institute named Babe #80 on its list of America's Most Inspiring Movies.

This film has a 6.9 rating on IMDb and a 97% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Trivia[]

When James Cromwell was handed the screenplay for Babe, he thumbed through it to see how many lines he had. He saw that he didn't have that many (he had only 171 words of spoken dialogue, and 61 words that were sung), so decided that he would do it as a nice easy film. What he didn't realize was that he would have more screen time in this film than any of his previous films.

Because baby pigs grow so fast, 48 pigs were used during filming for the role of Babe.

Jerry Goldsmith originally composed the film's music, but it was ultimately rejected for being too dark in tone. Nigel Westlake was then brought in to compose a lighter score.

USA pork sales dropped by 20% after the movie came out.

The talking pig is a combination of 48 real Yorkshire pigs plus an animatronic double. A makeup artist added toupee and eyelashes to each, and computer digitization manipulated pictures of the snout to make the pig appear to talk.

The film had 56 animal trainers on set to handle nearly 1000 animals.

Magda Szubanski was only in her early 30s when she won the role of Esme Hoggett, who was supposed to be elderly, so Szubanski was made up to look about 20 years older.

James Cromwell, a longtime vegetarian, decided to become a vegan after starring in the movie.

Filmed in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia, though all vehicles drive on the right side of the road.

Babe was released in theaters in 1995, which was the year of the pig.

One of the reasons why it took George Miller ten years to bring the story to the screen was because he was waiting for special effects technology to catch up with his vision for the film.

The music for the movie's theme song is taken from the Organ Symphony by Camille Saint-Saëns, whose most famous composition is "Carnival of the Animals."

The man who buys three of Fly's puppies is head animal trainer Karl Lewis Miller.

The sheepdog championship takes place at the Kingsmith Fairground. The electrician whose truck Rex hitches a ride on is named Dick. Near the beginning of the film, the trophy Esme Hoggett polishes is for the Kingsmith District Show. These are tributes to author Dick King-Smith.

Preproduction lasted eight months, shooting took six months and post-production twelve months.

A ten-year labor of love for producer George Miller.

Sometimes considered the film that began the CGI talking animal movie revolution.

Quentin Tarantino called Babe one of his favorite films of 1995, which surprised some fans due to the violent nature of his films.

James Cromwell claimed that he paid for his own Oscar consideration campaign at the cost of $60,000.

During test screenings of the film, kids would often ask 'what did that say' when the chapter of the movie begun, that musical group The Harlettes were brought in to sing the chapter openings.

Included among the American Film Institute's 1998 list of the 400 movies nominated for the Top 100 Greatest American Movies.

Most films released in the German-speaking parts of Europe are dubbed in Germany with standard (Prussian-German) pronunciation. This film, however, was released in a special re-dubbed version in Austria. Each of the animals speaks in a very specific regional Austrian accent: Ferdinand the Duck sounds like a Tyrolean, Duchess the cat has a Vorarlberg accent and so on. To an American speaker of English, the accents might sound like Deep South, Australian or Scottish English, including regional words and figures of speech.

Two of the three 'Agents' from The Matrix (1999) appear in this film. Paul Goddard (Agent Brown) portrays Farmer Hoggetts Son-in-law, while Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) provides the voice of Rex, the sheepdog.

According to actor James Cromwell, there was tension on the set between producer George Miller and director Chris Noonan. Noonan later complained, "I don't want to make a lifelong enemy of George Miller but I thought that he tried to take credit for Babe, tried to exclude me from any credit, and it made me very insecure... It was like your guru has told you that you are no good and that is really disconcerting." Miller shot back, "Chris said something that is defamatory: that I took his name off the credits on internet sites, which is just absolutely untrue. You know, I'm sorry but I really have a lot more to do with my life than worry about that... when it comes to Babe, the vision was handed to Chris on a plate."

Included among the American Film Institute's 2000 list of the 500 movies nominated for the Top 100 Funniest American Movies.

One of the animal handlers on the film was Brett Lee, who later played international cricket for Australia and was part of the team which won the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

The movie's dollhouse scene was deemed so infamous, that it became an internet meme.

Hugo Weaving's first time voice acting in a theatrical film, later as well as Rex the Border Collie in this film's sequel, he'd go onto voice Noah the Elder the Emperor Penguin in the Happy Feet films, Megatron in the live-action Transformers films, and both Noctus the Barn Owl and Grimble the Boreal Owl in Legends of the Gaurdians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole (2010).

Three years earlier, James Cromwell portrayed a priest in another movie with a similar name about baseball legend Babe Ruth - The Babe (1992).
