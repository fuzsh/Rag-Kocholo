Her teacher has given her this book (now year 2 and not 7 until March) as her home reading book and she is really struggling. It has a lot of colloquial Yorkshire/Lancashire speak in it and just seems a bit too advanced. I don't wish to discourage her, but she is struggling to understand it as the language is so foreign to her. We are in Manchester by the way, so this isn't a north/south thing, but she has no concept of 'theseyer' 'twas' 'tis' 'afore' and 't'wont'. I told her I would post here for advice."
