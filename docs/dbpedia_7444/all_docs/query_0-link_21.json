Most Chinese people also believe that babies born in a Goat year will grow up to be followers rather than leaders.\n\nTherefore, many Chinese couples take steps to avoid having children in a year of the Goat. Previously, many young Chinese couples tried desperately to conceive in a racing against time to had a baby in 2014, which was a year of the Horse. A year of Horse is considered far luckier than a Goat year.\n\nAlthough this is an outdated superstition, which seems silly, it has a real effect on Chinese society.\n\nIs It the Year of the Sheep, Goat, or Ram?\n\nChinese people are actually also not quite sure about this.

Although its head was lost, its present reproduction according to historical records is in the image of a goat.\n\nBest-Suited Careers for Goats\n\nPeople born in a year of the Goat prefer to work in a team.
