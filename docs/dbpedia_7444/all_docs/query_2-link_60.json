        "text": "The Sheep-Pig is one of Dick King-Smith’s most famous tales.\n\nIt shot to further fame when the film adaptation, Babe, was released in 1995.\n\n‘Why can’t I learn to be a Sheep-Pig?’\n\nWhen Babe, the little orphaned piglet, is won at a fair by Farmer Hogget, he is adopted by Fly, the kind-hearted sheep-dog.\n\nBabe is determined to learn everything he can from Fly.\n\nHe knows he can’t be a sheep-dog. But maybe, just maybe, he might be a sheep-pig.\n\nDick King-Smith served in the Grenadier Guards during the Second World War, and afterwards spent twenty years as a farmer in Gloucestershire, the country of his birth.\n\nMany of his stories are inspired by his farming experiences.\n\nHe wrote a great number of children’s books, including The Sheep-Pig (winner of the Guardian Award and filmed as Babe), Harry’s Mad, Noah’s Brother, The Queen’s Nose, Martin’s Mice, Ace, The Cuckoo Child and Harriet’s Hare (winner of the Children’s Book Award in 1995).\n\nIn 2009 he was made an OBE for services to children’s literature.\n\nDick King-Smith died in 2011 at the age of eighty-eight.\n\nOrders are processed and dispatched Monday to Friday.\n\nEstimated Dispatch Times:\n\nItems are usually dispatched within twenty-four to seventy-two hours. Dispatch time does not include delivery. If one or more items are not available when you place your order there may be a delay in dispatch, so that we can send your items in as few parcels as possible.\n\nLatest UK Delivery Estimates\n\n1st Class - 1-2 working days\n\n2nd Class - 2-3 working days\n\nFree Click and Collect at Daunt Books Marylebone\n\nLatest International Delivery Estimates\n\nEurope - Standard 7-10 working days\n\nEurope - Tracked and Signed 4-7 working days\n\nRest of the World - Standard 15-20 working days\n\nRest of the World - Tracked and Signed 10-15 working days\n\nOngoing Covid restrictions, reduced air and freight capacity, high volumes and winter weather conditions are all impacting transportation and local delivery across the globe.\n\nOverseas Delivery Information\n\nWe are experiencing delays with deliveries to many countries, but in most cases local services have now resumed. For more details, please consult the latest information provided by Royal Mail's International Incident Bulletin.\n\nOverseas Customs\n\nIf you are ordering goods for delivery outside of the UK, please note that your consignment may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the goods reach the country of destination.\n\nAny such charges levied in relation to customs clearance must be paid by you.
