        "text": "REVIEWS\n\n“There comes a happy point in children’s theatre when one can almost forget the word ‘children’s’ and declare: This is real theatre, with an appeal to all, from infant to octogenarian, in whom a sense of wonder and a bright imagination are alive and well. So it is in David Wood’s adaptation…” - Eastern Daily Press\n\n“The show is absolutely enchanting. It’s aimed at kids but the drama, the tension, the humour, the lovable heroes and menacing villains, make it compelling theatre for grown-ups too… a crackling good story, beautifully adapted for the stage” - Evening News\n\n“What marvellous theatre … As for the denouement – well, children applauding Babe for driving the sheep through the trial gate is just terrific theatre… First class.” - The Stage\n\n“When a packed theatre is chanting the lead character’s name at the end of a production, it’s fair to assume you’ve got a hit on your hands. So it was with Babe, The Sheep Pig as the hundreds of young children (and a few adults) acclaimed a masterful adaptation… A delight.” - Birmingham Evening Mail\n\n“David Wood’s script is the real star… The kids in the audience revelled in the slapstick… Everyone got involved when Fly beseeched the crowd to recall a password to help Babe… This production should inspire many more across the country.” - Dallas Morning News"
