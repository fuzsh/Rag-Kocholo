On November 12, 1983, she was united in marriage to Roger Matye in Random Lake. For almost 40 years, she ran a home daycare, and loved every second spent holding those babies, as well as her own children and grandchildren. She enjoyed tending to the flower gardens at her home. Whether it was jokes, silly photos, or crazy adventures, Judy loved to make people laugh. Her legacy will live on in the countless memories of laughter, smiles and celebrations she shared with loved ones. She was grateful for every day of sunshine she was blessed with and looked forward to her eternity in heaven.\n\nJudy is survived by her husband, Roger Matye; children, Melanie Fuller of Plymouth, Dawn (Brad) Westphalen of Kentucky, Jack (Julie) Wallace of Plymouth, Jonathan (Nisha) Schowalter of Saukville; stepchildren, Bryan Matye of Milwaukee, Lisa Matye of Sheboygan; 9 grandchildren; one great-grandchild.

She is further survived by nieces, nephews, other relatives, and many, many friends.\n\nMemorial services will be held on at Wenig Funeral Home, 108 Center Ave. in Oostburg on Wednesday, July 7, 2021, at 4:00pm.
