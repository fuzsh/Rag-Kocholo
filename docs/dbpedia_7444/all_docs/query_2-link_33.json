        "text": "The best-selling British author of The Sheep-Pig passed away at age 88.\n\nDick King-Smith, best-selling children’s author, has passed away in his sleep. His agent, who confirmed the news, noted that King-Smith had been in declining health for a number of years. King-Smith’s book The Sheep Pig was adapted into the 1995 film Babe, which went on to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Babe was not the only film adaptation of King-Smith’s work; his story The Water Horse, about a mysterious Scottish sea creature, was adapted into a film of the same name in 2007.\n\nThe BBC reports that King-Smith “was a farmer for 20 years before turning his hand to writing,” penning his first book when he was well into his fifties. His farming life informed his writing, and many of his books featured animals in some capacity, including The Sheep-Pig, The Fox Busters, Harriet the Hare, and The Invisible Dog. King-Smith was a highly prolific author, writing over 100 books since 1978. His autobiography, Chewing the Cud, was published in 2004.\n\nBaa-ram-ewe, Mr. King-Smith, and thank you."
