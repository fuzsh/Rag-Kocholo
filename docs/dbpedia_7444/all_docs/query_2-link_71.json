        "text": "When Farmer Hoggett wins a pig at the fair his wife wastes no time in deciding its future. Babe is destined for the freezer but Mrs. Hoggett is completely unaware of how unusual a pig he is.\n\nFly, the sheep dog on the farm, fosters Babe straight away and with her constant care and tuition changes what everyone thought was an ordinary pig into a most extra ordinary “sheep-pig.”\n\nWith an emphasis on politeness and manners Babe wins over the unruly sheep to do just what he wants, using the most unconventional methods. The story is packed with exciting adventures including Babe’s saving the sheep from rustlers and wolves, and culminating in the little pig’s triumph at the sheep dog trials.\n\nThe Sheep-Pig is a challenging read for beginners but the story is such an endearing one that once began it will just have to be finished."
