        "text": "Index Nos.: 0051.00-00\n\nRefer Reply to: CC:IND:I:1:1\n\nMAY 17, 1984\n\nKey: A = * * * Dear Sir or Madam: This refers to your request for a ruling dated March 14, 1984, concerning the targeted jobs credit under section 44B of the Internal Revenue Code. You are concerned with the timely certification provision of section 51(d)(16)(A).\n\nYou indicate that A began work for you as an employee on November 11, 1983, which was Veterans Day, a federal holiday. You made a written request for certification that A is a member of a targeted group to your State Employment Security Agency (SESA) on that date. However, the SESA declined to issue a certification for A because the postmark date placed by the United States Postal Service on that written request was subsequent to the date that A began work.\n\nYou indicate that because the United States Postal Service was closed on the Veterans Day, a federal holiday, you could not obtain a postmark date of November 11, 1984, to show that you made a timely request for certification. You ask for a ruling that your request for certification for A be considered timely.\n\nSection 51(d)(16)(A) of the Code provides that an individual shall not be treated as a member of a targeted group unless, on or before the day the individual begins work for the employer, the employer (i) has received a certification from the designated local agency that such individual is a member of a targeted group, or (ii) has requested in writing such certification from the designated local agency.\n\nSection 51(d)(15) of the Code provides that the term \"designated local agency\" means a state employment security agency established in accordance with the Act of June 6, 1933, as amended (29 U.S.C. 49 - 49n).\n\nIn general, in the case of a request in writing for certification mailed via the United States Postal Service, the request is deemed to be made on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in which such request was mailed to the designated local agency provided the request is mailed in accordance with the mailing requirements in section 301.7502 - 1(c) of the Procedure and Administration Regulations.\n\nIn the situation you present, it is not generally possible for the employer to either obtain a postmark from the United States Postal Service or have the written request date stamped at the SESA office because both the United States Postal Service and the SESA offices will generally be closed on a legal holiday. The purpose of the targeted jobs credit was to increase employment opportunities for members of the various targeted groups. Requiring the employer to delay the beginning work date for the employee until a day the employer can obtain a postmark from the United States Postal Service or deliver the written request to the SESA may result in that individual not being hired. That result is not the intent of the targeted jobs credit or the timely certification provision of section 51(d)(16)(A) of the Code.\n\nTherefore, for purposes of the targeted jobs credit, we conclude that in the case of an employee who begins work on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the deadline for making a timely request in writing for the certification or receiving a timely certification is the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday. For these purposes, the term \"legal holiday\" has the same meaning as that term is defined in section 7503 of the Code.\n\nThe information furnished indicates that the postmark date was November 12, 1983; therefore, your request for certification for A is timely for purposes of section 51(d)(16)(A) of the Code.\n\nThis ruling letter only addresses the issue of whether your request for certification is timely for purposes of section 51(d)(16)(A) of the Code.\n\nThis ruling letter only addresses the issue of whether your request for certification is timely for purposes of section 51(d)(16)(A) of the Code. It does not address the question of whether A meets the criteria for membership in a targeted group. That determination is made by the SESA.\n\nNo opinion is expressed as to the federal income tax consequences of the transaction described above under any other provision of the Code.\n\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it. Section 6110(j)(3) of the Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. Temporary or final regulations pertaining to one or more of the issues addressed in this ruling have not yet been adopted. Therefore, this ruling will be modified or revoked by adoption of temporary of final regulations, to the extent the regulations are inconsistent with any conclusion in the ruling. See section 17.04 of Rev. Proc. 84-1, 1984 - 1 I.R.B. 10, 20. However, when the criteria in section 17.05 of Rev. Proc. 84-1 are satisfied, a ruling is not revoked or modified retroactively, except in rare or unusual circumstances.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nMario E. Lombardo Director, Individual Tax Division WD 84-31-109.0"
