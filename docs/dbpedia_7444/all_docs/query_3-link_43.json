        "text": "Dick King-Smith’s hilarious, inspirational tale of a chubby little piglet who dreams of herding sheep. When Babe, an orphan piglet, is won by Farmer Hoggett at a fair, he is quickly adopted by Fly, the farmyard sheep-dog. Inspired by Fly’s skill at herding sheep, Babe is determined to learn everything he can from his new mentor, even though the other animals laugh at him. He knows he’ll never be a sheep-dog. But can Babe prove himself against the odds, and become a true sheep-pig?\n\n6 copies of this classic children’s book to accompany Read and Respond: The Sheep-Pig.\n\n#readandrespond-0816\n\n#bookpacks-0816\n\n#reading-spine-year-3\n\n#reading3for2\n\n#pie3for2\n\n#rbmember\n\n#summer-18\n\n#sum-18\n\n#sum-18-ie\n\n#piecorbettreadingspine\n\n#pm19-offer\n\nDick King-Smith was born and raised in Gloucestershire, surrounded by pet animals. After twenty years as a farmer, he turned to teaching and then to writing children’s books. Dick’s love of animals and farmyard life shines through in his stories. His gentle, accessible stories are ideal for young readers, blending humour and fantasy with useful lessons about life and the world.\n\nAmong his best-loved books is Babe, The Sheep Pig, which became a major film and was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nDick died in January 2011, aged 88."
