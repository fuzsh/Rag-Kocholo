McDonald\n\nA few short weeks ago, America unof-\n\nficially declared war on the Third\n\nWorld.\n\nYes America declared war...not just\n\nRonald Reagan. It was through\n\nAmerica's complacency, naivete, or\n\nwillingness which brought Ronald\n\nReagan to the presidency. So far it\n\nseems that a strong majority backs the\n\npresident's foreign policies. If not all\n\nAmerica agrees, that opposition is\n\ndiscouragingly silent.\n\n- America has embarked into the\n\ndubious waves of gunboat diplomacy\n\nonce again. If the country involved is in\n\nany way obstinate, America flexes its\n\niuscles. The problem is that physical\n\nstrength does not necessarily overcome\n\nthe strength of will and emotion.\n\nAmerica is stepping out of bounds into\n\nthe domain of the Third World.\n\nGRENADA is where America\n\ndeclared its opposition to the Third\n\nWorld. It is more a fear of a Third\n\nWorld network than of the expansion of\n\nSoviet communism. America sees its\n\nflanks being ringed by countries who\n\nwant self-determination. A split from\n\nthe American sphere of influence is\n\nseen as a slap in the face to the United\n\nStates. What better place to retaliate\n\nthan a country with the square mileage\n\nbf Detroit,and the population of a sold\n\nout Michigan Stadium.\n\nBut what about the Soviet arms,\n\neveryone points out vociferously. If\n\nAmerica did not constantly rebuke\n\nThird World self-determination, those\n\narms could have very well been U.S.\n\narms. Maurice Bishop, the late head of\n\nthreat to the rest of the world. But when\n\nAmerica rejects and badgers the will of\n\nnew governments, America's position\n\nwill not be held highly by the Third\n\nWorld.\n\nIMMEDIATELY after World War II,\n\nVietnam asked for assistance from the\n\nUnited States, who said its task was to\n\nmake the world safe for democracy.\n\nAmerica strongly objected to Viet-\n\nnam's policy of agrarian reform.\n\nDisregarding U.S. military might, the\n\nVietnamese forced the United States to\n\nwithdraw from the fight because of the\n\nVietnamese will.\n\nChile, under Salvador Allende, asked\n\nfor U.S. assistance in forming a system\n\nof social democracy. The United States\n\nstrongly disagreed with Allende's\n\npolicies and sent the CIA to brutally\n\nmurder him amid a hail of machine gun\n\nfire. Chile is now ruled by a military\n\ngroup oblivious to human rights.\n\ntoward socialism. But they seek aid\n\nfrom America before they inquire in the\n\nSoviet Union. The Third World seeks\n\nout America, supposedly the champion\n\nof freedom and democracy. But, they\n\nare strongly rebuffed, and at times\n\nignored. It can only be expected that\n\nthe Third World becomes a staunch\n\nsupporter of the Soviet Union.\n\nSelf-determination is a right of eadh\n\ncountry. How quickly America forge,\n\nthat at one time it fought for its ow6\n\nself-determination. Now America warit-\n\nts to impose its philosophies upon al\n\nothers. The threat to America, if there\n\nis one, has been brought upon itself by\n\nits callous attitudes and self-righteous\n\nomnipotence towards other countries.\n\nIf America is to remain a symbol 4f..\n\nfreedom and democracy, it must lear\n\nto negotiate. The new trend o\n\npeacekeeping through gunboat(\n\ndiplomacy will lead to a view of\n\nAmerica as an imperialist country. Im-\n\nperialism has nothing to do with,,\n\nfreedom and democracy.\n\nAmerica has to try to educate itself to!\n\nthe histories and cultures of other coun-\n\ntries. There are too many others who\n\nsee the inequities of life to simply allow\n\nfor the Americanization of the world.\n\nThe United States must come to grips\n\nwith the reality that this is a world of\n\nfour billion, not 250 million, people.\n\nMcDonald is a senior in the\n\nSchool of Art. He is a member of\n\nthe Black Student Union.\n\nNicaragua asked for a democratic\n\nend to the strongarm rule of Anastasio\n\nSomoza. America continued to back\n\nthe Somoza regime. Somoza was run\n\nout of Nicaragua with the resultant\n\ngovernment being strongly anti-\n\nAmerican. Can we now expect the\n\nAP Photo Grenadian government to be an arm of\n\nts will the United States, with the new head\n\nbeing strong enough to quell any inter-\n\nnal dissension?\n\nshould do CAN THE United States expect new\n\nat before Third World governments to do\n\nt, they are anything but to seek assistance from\n\n)nalism is the Soviets? These fledgling gover-\n\n)mmunist nments confess that yes, they do lean\n\nIf the United States is going to gain the respect and support of Third World nations it cannot continue to impose i\n\non nations such as Grenada. Negotiations and compromise is the proper course of action, not taking prisoners.\n\nGrenada, two years ago asked the\n\nUnited States for aid for his fledgling\n\nsocialist government. The U.S. gover-\n\nnment denied his requests simply for\n\nfear of the word socialist.\n\nSince World War II, America has\n\nrejected requests for aid by one after\n\nanother Third World government. Its\n\nreasoning has been that it cannot\n\nethically support a socialist or com-\n\nmunist government. America;\n\na bit or research and realize th\n\nthese countries are communist\n\nstrongly nationalist.

A\n\nfederal district court judge in Califor-\n\nnia overturned a more than 40-year old\n\nconviction that was one of the worst\n\nmiscarriages of justice in the long\n\nhistory of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nJudge Marilyn Patel reversed the\n\nJ942 decision against Fred Koremat-\n\nu. Korematsu had been convicted of\n\nrefusing to obey evacuation orders that\n\norced 100,000 Japanese-Americans,\n\ninost of them from the West Coast, into\n\nInternment camps for much of World\n\nII. The Supreme Court eventually\n\nupheld Korematsu's conviction.\n\nPatel's ruling is the first judicial\n\nr-ecognition that the internment was\n\nunconstitutional.\n\nThursday's decision - particularly\n\npoignant because it came the day\n\nbefore Veteran's Day, which honors\n\nthe people who served and died for this\n\nnation in war - begins to correct a\n\ncase of racial discrimination that was\n\n.\n\n..\n\n/\n\nueaky wheels\n\ndisturbing all the more because it was\n\nperpetuated by the men who were sup-\n\nposed to protect all the people from\n\nsuch discrimination. It was a case in\n\nwhich the institutions and laws\n\ndesigned to check such discrimination\n\nfailed as well. Correction of the in-\n\njustice is long overdue.\n\nPerhaps Patel's ruling will pave the\n\nway for the restitution due Japanese-\n\nAmericans rounded up merely because\n\nof their ancestry and not because they\n\nposed any individual threat to the war\n\neffort.\n\nSince the end of the war many have\n\nrecognized what a great injustice had\n\nbeen rendered, though no one was\n\nwilling to right the wrong. The Depar-\n\ntment of Justice, in its brief for\n\nKorematsu's present appeal, admitted\n\nthat the case was \"an unfortunate\n\nepisode in our nation's history.\" Judge\n\nPatel said that statement was \"tan-\n\ntamount to a confession of error.\"\n\nIt only took 40 years to begin to\n\ncorrect that error. But the system has\n\nstarted to correct itself. That is Mr.\n\nKorematsu's - and the 100,000 other\n\ninternees' - victory.\n\nTHE STONEY BURKE\n\nPOINT OF VIEIV\n\nNUCLEAR WAR IS SUICIDE.\n\nFEYT HING FUCKING DISI\n\nv\n\n4\n\n'4\n\nMILITARY RESEARCH\n\n$ A DEAD ISS$a\",\n\na3r\n\n\\\\\n\n( tip\n\n4\n\n4\n\n~-.\n\n\"\n\n4\n\nLETTERS TO THE DAILY:\n\nGiggles and scribbles with the Moodies\n\nTo the Daily:\n\nIn response to Mike Cramer's\n\nreview of the Moody Blues con-\n\ncert at Crisler Arena on October\n\n29 (\"The Moody Blues travel in\n\ntime,\" Daily, November 1): I\n\nwas one of the girls sitting next to\n\nhim. Until he let us know that we\n\nwere disturbing him, we had no\n\nidea he could even hear us over\n\nthe music. And when he let us\n\nknow (very unceremoniously I\n\nmight add), we adjusted our con-\n\nversation accordingly.\n\nBut to assume because we were\n\n\"stylish young women of the\n\neighties\" that we would ap-\n\npreciate Duran Duran more, is to\n\nCorrection\n\nexhibit the kind of prejudice\n\nfound too much on the music\n\nscene (and in the world in\n\ngeneral). After all, we didn't\n\nquestion his preppy presence at a\n\nconcert by such a mystical band\n\nas the Moody Blues.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that\n\nMr. Cramer was probably in\n\ndiapers when the Moody Blues\n\nhad their first successes, he\n\nassumes that we know little of the\n\nband because I shouted for \"Blue\n\nWorld\", from the new album,\n\nwhich he found to be \"the least\n\nthrilling of all the new songs they\n\nplayed.\" To the contrary, I have\n\nevery one of the Moody Blues'\n\nBLOOM COUNTY\n\nalbums, and I have just as much\n\nright to my opinion as he, the critic\n\ndoes. I was there from the start of\n\ntheir career.\n\nAs for not being great fans of\n\nthe Moodies, just because my\n\ngirlfriend and I were discussing\n\nthe show doesn't mean we\n\nweren't listening. Just as people\n\ndress differently, so do they react\n\nto events differently. Some of u4\n\nscream and giggle and comment;\n\nSome dance.
