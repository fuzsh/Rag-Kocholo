        "text": "ODDS ‘N’ BODS\n\nRobbie Vincent starts the new year on January 1st with a weekly Sunday 10pm-midnight soul show on BBC Radio One (simulcast on stereo Radio Two), “more or less a national version of my Radio London Saturday lunchtime show”, says Robbie . . . Dave Gregory on Southend’s Essex Radio (95.3 & 96.4 FM, 210/1359 & 220/1431 MW) not only has a Friday 7-9pm soul edition of his daily ‘The Gregamix’ but also now presents a Saturday 6-9pm ‘Electric Boogie’ with weekly disco DJ guests . . . Mayfair Gullivers DJ Graham Gold has David Joseph as guest on his very last Sunday 10am-midday JFM show, before switching next week to the Mon-thru-Fri 1.30- 4pm slot on the now 7 days a week 187/1602 MW London station . . . Wham are disclaiming all responsibility for their new ‘Club Fantastic Megamix‘ in an on-going argument with their record company Inner Vision, but have not unnaturally got its innocent mixer Alan Coulthard upset by telling their fans not to buy it (he needs the money!) . . . ‘Street Sounds Edition 7‘ will have Lydia Murdock ‘Superstar’/Curtis Hairston ‘I Want You’/Dayton ‘Sound Of Music’/ Tom Browne ‘Brighter Tomorrow’/Billy Griffin ‘Respect’/Lew Kirton ‘Talk To Me’/Instant Funk ‘You’ll Be Mine’/Lillo Thomas ‘I Love It’/Second Image ‘Don’t You’/Jones Girls ‘Knockin’, while Morgan Khan’s most ambitious project yet, the approximately 180 track ‘Dance Decade‘ boxed set has grown to 14 albums (or 9 cassettes) all for about £29, due in a fortnight or so . . . Island’s new club plugger Adrian Sykes is compiling additional mailing lists for experimental/alternative-type music, Hi-NRG, and video-using DJs — if you’re into one of those categories and can prove it, apply to Adrian at Island Records, 22 St Peters Square, London W6 . . . Angus Robertson is also compiling an alternative-type list at Illuminated Records, 452 Fulham Road, London SW6 . . . Mark Franklyn invites all nearby workers (and UB40 holders) to his Friday lunchtime soul club in The Royal Oak, Tooley Street, near London Bridge . . . Roger Dynamite has taken over his regular venue Tiffanys in Gt Yarmouth to promote his own ’60s/Motown night this Friday (25), when Steve Walsh funks Fleet Country Club and Jeff Young souls Dartford Flicks . . . Radio London soul broadcaster Tony Blackburn joins George Alexander and a PA by Phil Fearon at Harrow Leisure Centre this Saturday (26) . . . Greg Wilson & Chad Jackson mix up “The Perfect Beat” weekly on Mondays now at Bolton’s Dance Factory, where resident jock Peter Lee has moved ‘Dr Soul’s ’60s Stompers‘ to number one — Al Duprés (Cardiff Neros) and Nick Davies (Watford New Penny) are amongst those reporting great reaction, too . . . Norman Scott is calling Thursday at Haringey’s gay Lazers the ‘Stepping Back’ club with nothing but ’60s music and an opening special next week (1) of Helen Shapiro doing a one hour live show! . . . London Town Radio Roadshow is permanently at Bethnal Green’s Weavers Arms in Roman Road (free admission, pub hours), souled by The Big M Thur/Fri, Big Phil Etgart Sat/Sun . . . Peter Stringfellow opened his Hippodrome regardless that the lights weren’t working properly yet — and in fact their controlling computer is unlikely to be installed before Christmas . . . Dave Perry has already replaced the “too tired” Des Russell as resident jock at Edgbaston Faces French Club Jardine . . . Ian Gordon, upset by the national notoriety of King Kurt’s recent appearance there, left Liverpool’s Venue for calmer crowds at a the nearby Pembroke Sporting Club’s Brakes disco . . . Jonathan Guy, recently “blooded” by his first summer season in Wales now does the Cellar disco in Manchester University Students’ Union . . . Andy ‘Snake Hips’ Baker (0745-591135) is after a venue around the Mersey / Manchester / Cheshire / Lancashire area, and is not only a DJ but VJ too . . . Michael Sowden (24 St Annes Road, Caversham, Berks RG4 7PA) needs a 12in of Fantastique ‘Mama Told Me‘ — any offers? . . . Shaun James (Leighton Buzzard Unicorn) says one clever little member of the Aylesbury Posse pointed out the “get down” scratches on DJ Divine are from Raw Silk ‘Do It To The Music’ — Shaun also adds that with import 7in, UK 12in, LP, US 12in instrumental, Lionel Richie ‘All Night Long’ is getting just a bit expensive (but the instrumental is easier to mix into Herb Alpert ‘Red Hot’!) . . . Ray Parker Jr ‘N2U2‘ synchs sensationally right through Spence ‘Get It On‘, The System ‘Sweat‘ not surprisingly synchs ditto with Howard Johnson ‘Let’s Take Time Out‘ while Ronnie McNeir is great synched out of the Arnie’s Love fading tag . . . Instant Funk’s ‘Kinky’ LP, sleeve apart, is not so hot, other disappointing import sets being Maurice Starr, Howard Johnson, Earth Wind & Fire — though Womack & Womack is good soul, Ron Banks pleasant . . . Paddington’s Bluebird Records shop were dead impressed by the immediate reader response to their very first ad in RM last week, getting enquiries from places they’d never heard from before . . . Palo Alto Jazz has dropped the “Jazz” from its name, just by chance as the US label’s jazz saxist Richie Cole joins veteran country saxist Boots Randolph for an album reviving mainly ’50s C&W and R&B classics, including a 7in-issued remake of Randolph’s own raucous ’63 hit, ‘Yakety Sax’! . . . Trevor Hughes (Telford 592648) due to ill health is selling off lots of his Northern Soul and some Jazz/funk records . . . Steven Fay (Darwen) doesn’t have the Invitations ‘Skiing In The Snow‘ but gets great reaction to a version by the Beach Girls, which cost him a fortune anyway! . . Graham ‘Disco Kid’ Cambridge (York) asked over 500 of his mobile Outer Limits disco punters to compile an all-time chart and Little Eva ‘The Loco-motion’ came in at number five! . . . LET THE MUSIC PLAY!\n\nHOT VINYL\n\nEARTHA KITT ‘Where Is My Man’ (Record Shack SOHOT 11, via IDS)\n\nThe latest “diva” to revive her fortunes after adoption by Boys Town, the veteran growling and purring chanteuse sets all her cornily seductive tricks to a tuneful simple solidly pulsating 117bpm 12in rhythm produced by Jacques Morali (inst flip), good out of Madonna and likely to cross over massively once radio jocks follow Greg Edwards in playing it to death. You’ve been warned.\n\nGERRY TREW: ‘Deeper’ (Bluebird BRT 6, via PRT)\n\nPossibly Steve Jerome’s best-ever song, this softly starting then huskily crooned spurting and soaring 112bpm 12in hustler has female backups, exotic brass and thumping break, all rising to several exciting crescendoes and sounding extremely powerful on radio especially (where it should have wide appeal). Selling well in London after many plays on Capital, it’s looking like a hit for the Watford Baileys singer.\n\nSHARON REDD: ‘Somebody Save The Night’ (LP ‘Love How You Feel’ Dutch Rams Horn RHR 5065)\n\nProd/penned by Eric Matthew with no mention of Steve Harvey amongst the sleeve’s fulsome thanks!), Sharon’s insubstantial but danceable set —oddly out first in Holland — revolves rhythmically around her now drastically slowed-down 112bpm title track hit, this 113bpm canterer and the faster 120bpm ‘You’re A Winner‘ both imperceptibly mixing with it for a good sandwich, while the chunkier ‘Activate‘ and ‘Got Ya’ Where I Want‘ are both 0-114bpm, the slightly Mtume-ish ‘Sweet Sensation‘ is a pleasant 92½bpm slow slinker, and ‘Liar On the Wire‘ a rock-tinged 109bpm throbber. Continue reading “November 26, 1983: Eartha Kitt, Gerry Trew, Sharon Redd, Kool & The Gang, George Benson”\n\nODDS ‘N’ BODS\n\nLondon’s airwaves are reeling as all the Home Office-harrassed pirates join Radio Jackie on the Medium Wave, only London Weekend Radio being left on FM (for the moment), although JFM is doing split FM/MW broadcasts on Sundays to publicise that they’re in the process of pumping out soul 7 days a week on 187m/1602kHz MW . . . Dayton ‘Sound Of Music‘, Lew Kirton ‘Just Can’t Get Enough‘, Third World ‘Lagos Jump‘, Billy Griffin ‘Serious‘; Bobby Nunn ‘Don’t Knock It‘/’Private Party‘ are all set for UK 12in . . . Marvin Gaye’s newly extended ‘Grapevine’ originated in the States as a 12in promo for clubs to plug Motown’s unexpectedly successful soul oldies soundtrack album from hit US movie ‘The Big Chill’ — the LP’s own high sales to young white Americans despite its lack of a current single has caused some rock radio programmers to rethink their segregated oldies policy, while the continued resurgence of Top 40 radio formats is further rattling complacent AOR rockers out of their ruts . . . Channel 4’s Malibu World Disco Dancing world final actually saw reality rule as Italy’s Jay Janani delighted the London crowd by fitting break, smurf, webbo and other current moves into the 135bpm beat, winning the title with great credibility — however, if someone other than a muscleman had been allowed to win the UK final, it might have been a different story . . . Miss USA, Regan Miller, can come dance in my front room any time she likes, but was hardly representative of the best that America has to offer, while India’s enchantingly demure Ila Rani Jhunjhunwala made a refreshing change from all the disco puppets . . . Ken Gold’s co-penned ‘I’m Out Of Your Life’ originally appeared on an old Delegation album, Arnie’s Love picking it up only after it was recently submitted to Radar as material by the publishers — while Brian Mason (St Albans) reckons Delegation’s own current ‘It’s Your Turn‘ cops a like from Fantasy ‘You’re Too Late‘! . . . Mark Sherwood-Edwards is revamping the club mailing list at Interdisc, 249-251 Kensal Road, London W10 5DB (01-969 9414/3801) . . . Lance Nuttall urgently needs a resident “personality” jock at Hickstead’s Dance Factory in Sussex (0273-833795) . . . Tony Prince’s home studio for the Disco Mix Club wants a pair of Technics 1500 decks — call 06286-63227 if you can help . . . Pete King (0675-63554) is after PAs at Nuneaton’s Raffles Night Club, and Thursday gigs for himself . . . Graham Hunter (Basingstoke) missed a date last month, Andover’s Country Bumpkin burnt down before he got there . . . Paul Major & Tony Allen are chuffed at Hinckley’s Bubbles, which won Mecca Leisure’s ‘Club Of The Year’ award . . . Bob Jones jazz-souls Royston’s Bull Thurs (17), Benson-on-Thames Rivers Fri (18) . . . Chris Hill joins Colin ‘Kenwood’ Hudd at Dartford Flicks this Friday (18), when Dave Rawlings has “vicars and tarts” fancy dress at Basingstoke Martines . . . Dave Smith is back at Mayfair’s Samanthas (off Regent Street next to Rockafellas late nite eaterie) Mon/Wed/Fri, the latter night all drinks at 50p . . . Feminine Touch (Jackie & Lorraine) spin soul and funk on Saturdays at Upton Park’s JR’s Wine Bar in East London . . . Liverpool’s Venue bodypops every Wednesday now to DJ Electra Bop Master 1090, videos, abstract animation, spraycan graffiti and the whole ‘Fort Apache, Toxteth’ vibe — sounds interesting! . . . Eddie Gee takes over Loughborough Toff’s (ex-Adam & Eve) on Wednesdays for 50p admission electro/jazz/funk/reggae, the “perfect beat” . . . Steve Walsh this Wednesday (23) starts fortnightly at Copthorne’s Smugglers near Crawley, and for the next two Sundays at his new Brixton Ace residency the first 500 through the door get tickets for an Old Grey Whistle Test filming of Level 42 — oh yes, and big Steve’s left Soho Gossips . . . Steve Ogley gets fairly funky four nights a week at Lowestoft’s Snaps, while up the coast at Gt Yarmouth’s One Five One on Thur/Fri/Sat young Danny Smith is pleased to find the punters are beginning to understand good mixing, at last . . . Steve ‘Stevie Q’ Gladders (Winchester Seasons) re-edited a respectable extended version of ‘All Night Long (All Night)’ on cassette, but’ll have to re-do it now the instrumental’s in (incidentally, not forgetting the import 12in is ½bpm slower than the LP, both run together so perfectly you can get phasing from the inst/vocal combined) . . . Peter Lee (Bolton Dance Factory) knows how to suck up to people — he’s got my ’60s Stompers megamix tape, in his Top 10! . . . Super Jocks indie plugger Theo Loyla has moved to 6 Tomay Cottages, Hawthorne Corner, Herne Bay, Kent CT6 6TL (022786-604) . . . Tony StMichael (62 Talbot House, Harvist Estate, London N7 7LU) is after some guest spots around the Oakham area in Rutland (or wherever it is now!) . . . Al Dupres, basking under the new lights at Cardiff’s Nero ‘s Thurs/Sat, presents the Saturday 6-9pm soul show and Sunday l0pm-midnight rock show on local ILR station CBC, 221 MW/96 FM . . . ‘DJ Of The Year’ Franklin Hughes presents Portsmouth’s Radio Victory soul show every Saturday 6-9pm, and has just started Mondays 8-10pm on Nottingham’s Radio Trent . . . Geoff Dorsett, ex-Hallam, has turned up playing dance hits ‘n more on Saturdays 9am-noon at ‘The Sound Of South Shropshire’, Sunshine Radio 299/1017kHz MW . . . Butch McCartney & The Blackface Kid have shot up the sales chart not surprisingly following the impact of their incredible video — like a whole movie in miniature, wouldn’t it make a great full-length feature film? . . . Eddy Grant’s current video runs subtitles of the line “I don’t know what to do” across the screen, and then mind-messingly the “what to do” stays painted on his jacket when he moves! . . . New York’s Playboy Club is being up-dated for a new year reopening as a two million dollar video club, featuring 75 screens of widths from 1 to 10 feet, and a dome-shaped screen suspended over the dancefloor showing up to eight different video projections at the same time, all controlled by two VJs and a DJ . . . WEA’s US parent company Warner Communications Inc seems in trouble deep, despite the music side making money their Atari consumer electronics (and, to a lesser extent, MTV-operating Warner Amex cable company) have helped WCI lose an unbelievable 425 million dollars so far this year . . . James Ingram ‘Party Animal’ is only 111¼bpm . . . Baiser, about since the summer, has belatedly been taken up by the Thames Estuary mafia! . . . Steve Harvey used to drum for Bogaz . . . Per Cussion and his All Stars are Swedish, his real name being Per Tjernberg! . . . Quando Quango ‘Love Tempo‘ (top 3 US Dance/Disco) varies-down nicely out of ‘Cavern’ . . . Africali ‘Ayiko Bia‘ is a disappointment, the beat just isn’t quite right . . . I want you (all tonight), tonight, ALL NIGHT LONG!\n\nHOT VINYL\n\nMADONNA: ‘Holiday’ (Sire W 9405T)\n\nHurrah! This is the one that’ll give her a (Christmas holiday?) hit — originally big in Boys Town before breaking wide open on New York radio and now in better UK clubs, this incredibly frisky bright and breezy Jellybean Benitez produced 115bpm 12in smacking skipper has all the elements of a massive pop smash (good 118bpm ‘Think Of Me‘ flip, too). Get it, right now!\n\nAZYMUTH: ‘Make Mine Guarana’ (LP ‘Rapid Transit’ US Milestone M-9118)\n\nThe boys from Brazil are back with a dynamite long ultra jittery simple 113- 114-113-116-114-116-115-116bpm instrumental jazz-funk-latino groove powered by cleanly clinking and clonking percussion and their usual vocodered organ sound over an infectious bass line, “groove” being the operative word (the rest of the set through is really specialist either soft or frantic latin jazz). How about a 12in?\n\nHI VOLTAGE: ‘Love Is The Message’ (US One Way OW-007)\n\nBegan Cekic has recreated the old Vince Montana-arranged MFSB instrumental (a cult disco classic in New York), then with John Morales & Sergio Munzibai mixed it into a new (scratch-)116-120-121-116(rap on)bpm 12in form that’s still good mellow flowing jazz-funk like the original but with lots of scratching over it and an off-puttingly abrupt slower scratch ‘n “partay” rap break towards the end (the flip’s shorter different mix is minus rap). Combining the best of two worlds in ear-grabbing style, it could be huge. Continue reading “November 19, 1983: Madonna, Azymuth, Hi Voltage, Howard Johnson, David Joseph”\n\nODDS ‘N’ BODS\n\nLIONEL RICHIE’s import 12in of ‘All Night Long (All Night)’ is the LP-length 108½bpm remix with, really usefully, its instrumental as flip (great for mixing in at singalong points to catch your crowd in full voice!) . . . UK 12in releases will only qualify for Gallup’s combined main national singles chart as from the end of this month provided they feature the exact same tracks as the equivalent 7in, although remixed/extended versions will of course still be allowed: this may hopefully decrease the amount of creatively marketed pop product in the 12in chart, but could cause problems in cases like the new Michael Jackson 12in when two different mixes of the main track are padded with a throwaway filler, the filler though being 7in flip (where it makes good sense) — which track in the future would the company sacrifice, rather than have a 3-track 7in? . . . A&M pressed up all their 12in copies of the Jeffrey Osborne remix (yet to be received) and it wasn’t until freelance plugger Orin Cozier told ’em that they realised somehow every single one featured an extended instrumental instead of the vocal! . . . Disco Mix Club’s November oldies floor-filler should have read last week as part one of ‘Dr Soul’s ’60s Stompers’, mixed “live” by myself and left in such a way that next month’s girlie group part two will follow on perfectly if both are transposed onto a separate cassette . . . Alan Coulthard’s current DMC megamix is of George Benson, but more importantly he’s also megamixed together three tracks from Wham’s album for commercial 12in release as their next single, probably called ‘Club Fantastic’ . . . Radio London soul broadcaster Tony Blackburn was thoroughly entertaining in a corny self-mocking way last week at Dartford Flicks (where you can get nervous exhaustion watching Colin Hudd mix!), but some soul fans were disappointed he was so “Radio One Roadshow” — however, after much discussion, he says that at his next proper soul gig he’ll get behind the decks for a while just to prove he can actually play a record! . . . Flicks found a little knot of observers all kitted out in fancy knits — Ian Reading (Southend Zero 6), Nicky Peck (Medway), Tom Holland (Flicks), Ralph Tee (Groove On), Orin Cozier (Pzzazz) and me! . . . Big Al Mayfield (Guildford & Purley Cinderella’s Rockerfella’s) has been voted Mecca Leisure’s entertainer of the year, a DJ for the first time beating all the groups and singers . . . Channel 4’s Malibu World Disco Dancing UK final with its 138bpm music was won by Frankie Johnson Jr (Cardiff) doing a body building routine, runner-up the buxom Anita West (Hornchurch), their competition being jerky over-animated marionettes apart from the excellent Ray Dillon (Warley) and Everett Jervis (East London), who didn’t even make the final five despite being the only glimpse of 1983 on display — don’t Malibu realise that all the new excitement in dancing (especially in the public’s mind) is being caused by body popping and other sinuous movements done to slower funk tempos? . . Peter Stringfellow’s new Hippodrome doesn’t actually open until Friday next week (18) — oops, I knew there was an 8 in the date! NY Skyy impressed everyone at Hammersmith, while there just ain’t no stoppin’ Brass Construction once their rumbling bass/smacking drums rhythm machine gets put into gear — great! . . . Mayfair Gullivers then saw several of the guys, plus gig-visiting Ralph Randell (Birmingham Powerhouse) and Roger Tovell (Severn Sound), the latter telling me that around Gloucester The Tribe ‘Jungle Rock‘ is currently huge . . . Discomart ’83 is this Sunday (13) from noon-5.30pm at Gloucester Leisure Centre in Station Road, £1 general admission, the equipment exhibition including a high power laser and periodical demonstrations of a full sound and light show . . . Rush Release (65 Bedford Hill, London SW12) are updating their Groovemasters mailing list for electro/rap/scratch jocks — and Lydon ‘T’ at Polo Records (351 Edgware Road, London W2), still looking for funky acts to sign, is updating his lists too . . London Records promoted The Walkers by sending DJs a slip mat — yes, just the one! . . . Shannon is now top US Dance/Disco hit . . . Slick ‘Space Bass’ (US Fantasy D-218) is out again on import in a slight remix . . . Charing Cross Heaven DJ/hot hi-NRG producer Ian Levine has megamixed together an excellent ‘Twelve Inches Of Pleasure‘ LP (Proto 1) full of fast Boys Town chart stuff . . . Pinnacle’s new Red Rooster label will be releasing Koffie here . . . Liverpool Concert Street jock Gary Allan is looking for a DJ capable of non-stop high energy mixing for possible work starting January (not necessarily in Liverpool) — if you’re really good, send career details and demo tape to him at 7 Gatley Drive, Maghull, Liverpool L31 3DH . . . Bob Jones miaows that the Caister chart should have been determined by all the jocks who worked there rather than just two — ooh! (but have you ever tried to get them all to agree on a chart?!), Bob ‘Dr Jazz’ is himself back reviving the goodies every Tuesday at Chelmsford’s Countryman in Victoria Road, and this Thurs (10) at Hemel Hempstead Whip & Collar, Fri (11) at Sheffield Green Sheffield Arms near Uckfield . . . Chris Dinnis starts souling Thursdays this week (10) at Taunton Kingstons in Station Road with a PA by David Grant (faint, swoonl) . . .Chris Hill joins Kev Ashman & Tom Felton at Charing King Arthur’s Court this Friday (28), when Robbie Vincent & Tom Holland soul Dartford Flicks, and Jeff Young joins Dave Collins at Staines Jacksons . . . King Enri at Deptford Cheeks (Fri) and West Kingsdown Kings Lodge (Sat) is after guest star PAs for both venues on 01-852 3900 (shop hours) . . . Grandmaster Flash ‘The Message’ has been adapted into a current Green Cross Code road safety jingle — so how long before they get around to STAY OFF THOSE YELLOW LINES!\n\nHOT VINYL\n\nARNIE’S LOVE: ‘I’m Out Of Your Life’ (Streetwave WAVEL 9)\n\nThe very soulful light voiced Arnie turns out to be Toney Lee’s brother, getting cooing support on a superb dreamily shuffling 0-104bpm 12in swaying jogger that’s already been an overnight sales sensation on import . . . possibly because side one’s fading tag is just like the start of side two’s jazzier instrumental version, making two copies pretty well essential so you can prolong the groove! Pure class.\n\nRONNIE McNEIR & INSTANT GROOVE: ‘Just Can’t Let You Go’ (US Crossroad Entertainment Corp CR 12-2)\n\nBunky Shepherd’s new soul label now hits us with a fantastic pent-up jittery little 102bpm 12in shuffle, jiggle ‘n kick jogger based on the Herb Alpert ‘Rise’ riff (they mix divinely!), Ronnie and friends swapping lead vocals around bluesy harmonica, guitar and organ while whipping up an ultra-infectious storm (inst flip). It is dynamite!\n\nCUBA GOODING: ‘Happiness Is Just Around The Bend’ (London LONX 41)\n\nArthur Baker powers this terrific zappily infectious 120-119-120bpm 12in revival of Cuba’s Main Ingredient oldie with a driving ‘Billie Jean’ beat and shrill supporting chix, setting up a frisky lick that’s got most dance crowds covered (119bpm dub/acappella flip). Sit still if you can! Continue reading “November 12, 1983: Arnie’s Love, Ronnie McNeir & Instant Groove, Cuba Gooding, Michael Jackson, Daryl Hall & John Oates”\n\nODDS ‘N’ BODS\n\nMichael Jackson’s caption last week (which gained a stray “no” — there IS doubt that ‘Thriller’ will be a US single) now continues with the news that Vestron Video in the States are releasing a one hour ‘Michael Jackson: Making Of The Thriller Video’ which reportedly will contain the finished 10 minute ‘Thriller’ video along with candid footage of its filming, plus “major elements” of the ‘Billie Jean’ and ‘Beat It’ clips as well as older ‘Off The Wall’ material — out before Christmas, the US video will be about £20 there but its availability in UK-compatible formats has yet to be announced . . . Streetwave are rushing Arnie’s Love here, label boss Morgan Khan currently devoting his time to a boxed ten album set ‘Decade Of Dance Hits 1973-83‘, promised for the party season and full of original smash classics! . . . Clubhouse’s follow-up medley (already on promo) will be the far less notable 113bpm ‘Supergood‘ melding of Stevie Wonder ‘Superstition’ and Chic ‘Good Times’, while Freeez follow with the pace changing 50-100bpm ‘Love’s Gonna Get You‘ .. . David Joseph’s surprisingly amateurish “Britfunk” LP due soon has only two really dynamic dancers, the 95bpm ‘Joys Of Life‘ title track and 0-118bpm ‘Do You Feel My Love Now Baby‘ . . . Brass Construction/NY Skyy at Hammersmith Odeon this Friday sold out so fast that they’re there Sunday (6) now too! . . . Channel 4 televise the Malibu World Disco Dancing finals “live” tonight (Thursday 3) — the music last week actually dropped to only 132bpm, so there may be a hope for the more subtle contestants yet! . . . Peter Stringfellow’s daringly different Hippodrome opens (at London’s old Talk Of The Town) this coming Tuesday (8), and already has a TV variety show emanating from it . . . In Store Music previously free promo cassette programmes are being forced by the BPI to institute a nominal charge for their service (“music users should be educated to expect to pay for the use of recorded music”) and so have formed a “club” restricted to bona-fide working DJs, who must first prove they work in PPL licensed premises (or have a PPL licence if mobile — which is unfair as most mobiles doing private domestic parties don’t need one), cheques for £52 (year)/£30 (six months) being payable to Midas Records Ltd, 104 Harley House, Upper Harley Street, London NW1 4PR (full details on 01-935 3987) . . . Disco Mix Club’s November oldies medleys Mary Wells ‘My Guy’/ Jackie Wilson ‘Sweetest Feeling’/ Chairmen Of The Board ‘Give Me Just A Little More Time’/Four Tops ‘I Can’t Help Myself’/Miracles ‘Tears Of A Clown’/Isley Bros ‘This Old Heart’/Stevie Wonder ‘Uptight’/Vandellas ‘Dancing In The Street’/Jr Walker ‘Road Runner’/Show Stoppers ‘House Party’/Chubby Checker ‘(At The) Discotheque’/Edwin Starr ‘SOS’/ Frankie Valli ‘You’re Ready Now’/Billy Butler ‘Right Track’/Dobie Gray ‘Out On The Floor’/Bandwagon ‘Walls Of Heartache’ — all the chops/mixes being done “live” apart from one piano-to-piano tape edit (how much will boots of that be worth up North?) . . . Discoscene ’83 equipment exhibition is this Sunday (6) at Wishaw’s Belfry Hotel in Sutton Coldfield, noon-6pm . . . Simon Berwick (0706-216980 evenings) urgently needs a versatile smart pop jock for three months at a new hotel club in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, pay around £550 all-in per month — and alcohol is legal there! . . . The Chi-Lites and David Copperfield play Watford Baileys next week, Jr Walker returns to Mayfair Gullivers on Wednesday (9)… STAY OFF THOSE WHITE LINES!\n\nHOT VINYL\n\nKLIQUE: ‘Stop Doggin’ Me Around’ (MCA MCAT 843)\n\nOnly Lionel Richie is stopping this from being the biggest black hit in the States at the moment, a fabulous rolling slow 54bpm revival of Jackie Wilson’s 1960 ‘Doggin’ Around‘ that’s true to his original catch-in-the-throat chokingly soulful treatment, here on 3-track 12in with the otherwise Shalamar-ish trio’s blandly clopping 117bpm ‘Honey (I Want To Be Your Lover)‘, and burbling 117bpm ‘Try It Out‘.\n\nSHANNON: ‘Let The Music Play’ (Club LET 112, via Phonogram)\n\nHailed Stateside as the best electro dancer ever as it combines powerful hip-hoppery with a tuneful vocal, this chick-sung 0-114½bpm 12in judderer is actually a bit offputtingly “disco” in its vocal version, the far harder and freakier electro scratch instrumental 0-116½bpm flipside dub being more exciting — though both sides mixed together is best of all! A pop smash, no sweat.\n\nGRANDMASTER & MELLE MEL: ‘White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)’ (Sugarhill SHL 130)\n\nThe realisation that this adventurously arranged 115bpm 12in rapper owes so much to Liquid Liquid’s distinctively rumbling ‘Cavern‘ rhythm track doesn’t detract from its exciting impact, and it should still be huge here as it’s ear-grabbingly different in ‘The Message’ class (alternative breakdown flip). Should it prove tricky to put across, just try running the “freeze!” start over Herbie Hancock’s ‘Autodrive’ break!
