Several methodological contributions have been published at different times and by various people to facilitate this task, largely relying on a macro-morphological approach. This is now routinely adopted by zooarchaeologists but, although it certainly has its value, has also been shown to have limitations. Morphological discriminant criteria can vary in different populations and correct identification is highly dependent upon a researcher’s experience, availability of appropriate reference collections, and many other factors that are difficult to quantify. There is therefore a need to establish a more objective system, susceptible to scrutiny. In order to fulfil such a requirement, this paper offers a comprehensive morphometric method for the identification of sheep and goat postcranial bones, using a sample of more than 150 modern skeletons as a basis, and building on previous pioneering work. The proposed method is based on measurements—some newly created, others previously published–and its use is recommended in combination with the more traditional morphological approach. Measurement ratios, used to translate morphological traits into biometrical attributes, are demonstrated to have substantial diagnostic potential, with the vast majority of specimens correctly assigned to species. The efficacy of the new method is also tested with Discriminant Analysis, which provides a successful verification of the biometrical indices, a statistical means to select the most promising measurements, and an additional line of analysis to be used in conjunction with the others.",

        "text": "3.1 Biometrical indices\n\nBiometrical indices were plotted to emphasise potential shape differences. Although in some populations one of the two species may have larger body size than the other, their variability is such that neither can universally be characterised as being larger (or smaller), therefore absolute size is of limited interest for this analysis. In a few cases, however, a linear measurement (as opposed to a ratio) was retained on one of the two axes, which means that, along that axis, the distribution will reflect size. Although, due to allometric development, shape is not entirely independent from size, the emphasis in the analysis of metric ratios is on shape. Should shape differences, to some extent, be the product of variability in size, this would not invalidate the comparison, particularly when a mix of different populations/breeds is considered.\n\nFig 14 shows how, by plotting the ratios E/F against measurement A, the separation between the horncores of the two species is clearly visible with a minimum amount of overlap. The ratio between the length of the horncore (E) and the length of its outer curvature (F) is the most useful characteristic to discriminate between the two groups. Sheep and goat in Fig 1A have similar maximum diameters (A) but very different E/F ratios. By plotting the ratio E/F against the ratio A/F (Fig 15), the separation between the two species is almost complete. Sheep, whose horncores are more curved and shorter, have a higher A/F value compared to goats. On the other hand, goats, which have longer, sharper and less curved horncores, have a higher E/F value. Horncores are generally easily distinguishable through simple visual observations, but this method allows us to demonstrate identifications and provide an indication of the degree of variability.\n\nFig 16 plots the ratio ASG/BG and ASG/LG for the scapula. There is a significant amount of overlap between the two groups. Goats tend to plot in the upper part of the diagram, reflecting the greater distance between the spine-edge and the glenoid cavity in this species ([28]; [29]). Fig 17 describes the area of the processus articolaris and the articulation of the scapula (GLP/LG plotted versus GLP/BG). This combination shows a relatively well-defined separation between the two species, despite some overlap. Fig 18 shows the combination of ASG/SLC with GLP/BG. The goat cluster has lower GLP/BG and higher ASG/SLC values, reflecting the more slender collum scapulae of this species, as well as the greater ASG as mentioned above ([28]).\n\nFig 19 compares BT/HT and BT/HTC ratios; these describe the shape of the distal trochlea of the humerus. Goats show a greater width of the trochlea in relation to its height: in both species the medial part of the trochlea is higher, but in sheep more so than in goat, giving the goat trochlea an overall more cylindrical shape ([28]; [29]). The ratio BE/HTC plotted against BE/BT (BT was preferred to Bd as this latter has been demonstrated to be an age dependent measurement in pigs [30]) provides a fair separation between the two species (Fig 20), despite some significant overlap. The combination BEI/BT against BEI/Bd (Fig 21) seems to give the best results, probably reflecting the fact that BEI describes a morphological trait considered as a good indicator for sheep/goat discrimination ([28]; [29]; [8]; [4]). The only reason why this may not seem so obvious in Fig 3C is that the two ratios are highly correlated, resulting in a very dense distribution of points; yet almost all goats plot in the lower part of the diagram.\n\nThe ratio BFp/Bp works well for discriminating between sheep and goat radii (Fig 22). The measurements efficiently describe the presence of a well-developed (in sheep) or less developed (sometimes even absent in goat) lateral bicipital tuberosity on the lateral side of the proximal articular surface ([28]; [8]; [4]).\n\nEqually promising are the results obtained from the ulna. The BPC/DPA ratio in particular seems to be useful as it describes the shape of the anconaeus process. Fig 23 shows two distinct groups with a small degree of overlap. Goats show higher values in both indices, reflecting how the lateral coronoid process projects more laterally than in sheep ([28]; [1]). Some sheep outliers, however, plot in the middle of the goat distribution. Although these represent a distinct minority, they warn us that identifications must focus on the spread of the distributions rather than individual points, and that multiple lines of evidence and analysis must be used whenever possible.\n\nThe results obtained from the distal tibia, disregarded by Boessneck [1] as a useful element for the sheep/goat distinction, confirm the solidity of Kratochvíl’s observations [9] on its diagnostic potential. Fig 24 describes the shape of the distal articulation (though the horizontal axis only expresses size). A certain degree of overlap is present, but the distribution reflects the differences in shape of the distal articulation. As the sheep distal tibia is described as a trapezium and the goat as rectangular ([9]; [8]), the difference between the two measurements is expected to be more marked in sheep, providing a higher ratio value (Dda/Ddb).\n\nGood results were obtained for metapodials. The separation is clearer for metacarpals (Figs 25–27) than metatarsal (Figs 28–30), confirming previous observations by Boessneck [28] and Payne [13].\n\nFor both metapodials the most diagnostic measurements are those taken on the condyles and the verticilli of the condyles. A closer look at Figs 25 and 26 and Figs 28 and 29 reveals that the medial condyle measurements (1/a versus 1/2) are slightly more successful in discriminating than the lateral measurements (4b versus 4/5) in both metapodials, confirming what had already been pointed out by previous studies ([28]; [13]; [14]). Nevertheless, when both combinations (1/a versus 1/2 and 4/b versus 4/5) are used, therefore reflecting the well-known morphological difference of the peripheral part of the trochlear condyles between the two species ([1]; [13]; [4]), two very distinct groups can be recognized. Figs 27 and 30 compare measurements which describe the overall shape of the bone. Two groups are visible, but the separation is less clear-cut: the goat group falls in the upper right part of the graph while the sheep group is located at the bottom right; this distribution reflects the greater slenderness of sheep metapodials compared to goats’ ([28]; [8]).\n\nThe most successful ratios for the astragalus include measurements (GLl, Dl and Bd) that have also been adopted by Davis [10] and form the basis of a metrical method for separating sheep and goat astragali. In addition, the new measurement H, has also been proven to have some diagnostic value. Fig 31 shows (H/Dl versus Bd/GLl) that the separation between the two species is determined by both axes, with a major influence exercised by H/Dl. This reflects the fact that the sulcus at the middle of the trochlea is usually deeper in sheep than goat [1]. In addition, Dl in goat is influenced by the presence of an articular ridge which projects more obliquely in a distal direction, while in sheep it is less pronounced and more horizontally oriented ([1]; [4]). On the other hand sheep show higher Bd/GLl scores, reflecting the more robust shape (wider in relation to the height) of the bone of this species. Fig 32 represents a modified version of Fig 31 where H replaces GLl. The pattern is similar, with the greater separation occurring on the horizontal axis. A description of the complete shape of the bone is given by Fig 33, which includes all three main dimensions (breadth, depth and length). The two groups fall into two different areas of the plot with only a few specimens overlapping. The distinction is almost entirely due to Dl/GLl, with the more robust astragali of sheep plotting in the upper part of the graph. A fair separation between the two groups is shown also in Fig 34 (ratio Bd/H against Bd/GLl) where, once again, sheep tend to plot towards the top and goats the bottom.\n\nFig 35 demonstrates how the measurements suggested by Boessneck [28] (in this study c, d and B) for the calcaneum can be useful and, when plotted together, they provide good separation. These ratios clearly mirror the fact that the length of the articular facet for the os malleolare on the lateral process is greater than half of the entire process (c/d) in sheep, while in goat it is smaller ([28]; [4]). Measurement B describes the difference between the articular facet of the os malleolare, which in sheep is of greater length than width, whereas in goat it is of greater width than length ([28]; [1]; [4]). A good degree of separation was also obtained when c and d were plotted against DS/c (Figs 36 and 37).\n\nSince one of the main morphological differences between sheep and goat for the third phalanx is represented by the shape of the sole (in sheep it is more curved and less triangular, while in goat it is shaped almost like an isosceles triangle), the ratio MBS/DLS was plotted against DLS. Fig 38 shows that these measurements are very effective as they provide good separation between the two groups.\n\nMann Whitney tests of significance were run on the adopted indices, using the taxa as a grouping variable. This non-parametric test is an equivalent to the more commonly used independent t-test (parametric test) but requires fewer assumptions ([31]: 540). It was carried out with the purpose of checking whether differences between the two groups were statistically significant. The results are provided in S3 Table, along with the Median (middle score of a set of ordered observations), a more appropriate value than the mean for non-parametric tests ([31]: 789), and Effect Size values (objective and standardized measure of the magnitude of an observed effect; [31]: 785). A Bonferroni adjustment was applied in order to avoid Type I Error (i.e. the running of many consecutive paired tests can lead to finding more significant differences than there actually are). S3 Table clearly shows that all metrical indices (apart from 4/b in the metatarsal and Bd/Dl in the astragalus. BE/BT and BE/Bd also provide no significant differences when a Bonferroni’s correction is applied) have highly significant scores (p value<0.001) thus confirming the significance of the separation between the two groups.\n\nIn order to test if statistical significant differences were present also when two biometrical ratios were compared simultaneously, a Manova test was carried out for every combination of ratios used. As S4 Table shows, all the F values are greater than 1 and the related p values are all significant, confirming that the differences between the modern sheep and goat samples, even when multiple ratios are combined, are statistically significant.\n\n3.2 Discriminant analysis\n\nStandard Discriminant Analysis ([32]: 395) was run in order to see if, by including all measurements at once, we could find a means of maximising the separation between the two species. In addition, this method runs a re-classification of the known cases, thus testing the validity of the discriminating criteria ([33]: 105).\n\nThe analysis was undertaken for each element individually, using species as the grouping variable and the chosen measurements as the independent variables. Output options were set to give case-by-case discriminant data, so that the identification result for each individual specimen was obtained as well as a summary table. A plot of all cases was also produced using the canonical discriminant individual scores as the vertical axis. Prior to the analysis, a method of standardisation was applied to the raw data (following Davis [34]: 523) in order to exclude the size factor, which was not relevant to this research and can sometimes cloud the results. This was done by dividing individual measurements by the total for that anatomical element and multiplying the result by 100.\n\nS5 Table presents a summary of the results obtained. The percentage of correct re-attributions for each species is provided, along with the overall rate of successful re-attributions. S6 Table shows the Correlation Coefficients for each variable/measurement for each anatomical element considered. The Correlation Coefficient value represents the extent to which the variable participates in the function; in other words, it quantifies the extent to which a particular measurement contributes to the separation between the two taxa. Variables with higher positive/negative coefficients are those that contribute the most. The positive or negative coefficients attest that variables/measurements have the opposite effect on the function: this indicates that two different contributions are made to the differentiation process [31]).\n\nFor the horncores, the function is highly influenced by the length of the horncore (E) and the shape of the base taken either at the middle (C and D) or at the base of the bone (A and B). The variable F has been excluded by the program because it correlates too highly with one or more other variables (S6 Table). The percentage of originally grouped specimens correctly classified by the Discriminant Analysis for this element is 95.2% (S5 Table), a substantially high value as it means that, on a hypothetical sample of 100 unknown specimens, 95 would be correctly identified. When the Discriminant Individual Scores of each modern specimen are visually displayed (Fig 39), two almost completely distinct groups can be identified, confirming that DA can assign horncores to one of the two species with a high degree of success.\n\nFor the scapula, the variables which mostly contribute to the separation are GLP and ASG (S6 Table). The percentage of correct identification is 86.4% (S5 Table), predictably lower than for horncores, but still encouraging. The relative success of the discriminant function becomes visually clear in Fig 40: despite an area of overlap, most of the plot area is mainly occupied by only one of the two species (sheep at the top, goats at the bottom).\n\nFor the humerus, the variables which contribute the most to the separation of sheep from goat are BEI, BE and BT (and, to a lesser degree, HTC and HT) (S6 Table).The percentage of cases correctly classified for the humerus is 88.4% (S5 Table), a good score considering that measurements taken on the distal humerus have previously been considered of no use for sheep/goat discrimination [11]. When the Individual Discriminant Scores are plotted (Fig 41) some area of overlap can be seen, but there are also areas of the graph in which, by and large, only one taxon can be found.\n\nBp and GL are the most powerful variables for the function when the radius is considered (S6 Table). The classification rate for this element is 93.5%, a promising score (S5 Table). The scatterplot of the Individual Discriminant Coefficients (Fig 42) shows that, despite the presence of a few overlapping specimens, two groups are clearly visible.\n\nThe ulna has provided some of the best results. The measurements DPA and SDO along with BPC (S6 Table) are the most important, contributing heavily to the separation. The classification rate for this element is 92.9% (S5 Table). When the Individual Discriminant Coefficients are plotted (Fig 43), despite a few specimens falling in the ‘wrong’ area, the occurrence of two distinct groups is evident.\n\nFor the tibia, Dda is clearly the most important variable contributing to the separation (S6 Table). The re-classification result is 89.1% (S5 Table), a successful percentage when one considers that this element has scarcely been considered in previous studies ([28]; [15]; [4]).The scatterplot of the Individual Discriminant Coefficients (Fig 44) shows that, despite some overlap, most specimens fall into different areas of the graph.\n\nOn the basis of previous work, expectations were high for the taxonomic distinctiveness of the metacarpal, and these found confirmation in the DA analysis. GL and 1 along with BFd, a, 5, b and 2 contribute highly to the discrimination (S6 Table). The overall percentage of grouped cases correctly classified is 98.3% (S5 Table), a score which leaves a very low probability of erroneous attributions. Fig 45 displays two clearly distinct groups with just two goat specimens plotting in the sheep area.\n\nAlthough not as clear-cut as for the metacarpal, the metatarsal also produced encouraging results. For this element GL, 5, 6 and 3 play a major role in discriminating between the two groups (S6 Table). The percentage of correct attributions for the metatarsal is 92.7% (S5 Table). When the Individual Discriminant Scores are plotted (Fig 46) the presence of two almost completely distinct groups is clearly visible; the separation between them is not as clear as for metacarpals, but the overlap is not particularly significant, attesting to the diagnostic potential of this element.\n\nOf the measurements taken on the astragalus, H and GLl are the most important, along with Dl and Bd; these have a major impact on the discriminating power of the function (S6 Table). The correct attribution score is of 89.0% (S5 Table), a high percentage, although not the highest found so far. If the scatterplot of the Individual Discriminant Coefficients is considered (Fig 47), the distribution of the specimens attests that, despite some overlap, the astragalus is probably a useful bone to separate the two species.\n\nThe importance of c and GL for the calcaneum is confirmed by S6 Table. The correct attribution rate for this element is very high at 95.1% (S5 Table). The scatterplot of the Individual Discriminant Scores (Fig 48) shows a good separation between the two groups with just a few goat specimens falling in the sheep area of the graph.\n\nDiscriminant Analysis was also run on the 3rd phalanx, but the results revealed that the measurements for this element were affected by multicollinearity and, as such, the results cannot be considered to be reliable ([31]: 223)."
