        "text": "English author Dick King-Smith first published his children’s novel The Sheep Pig in 1983. In this book, King-Smith shares with the world the inspiring tale of how a livestock piglet called Babe turns his fate around and becomes a shepherd, or, in this story, a ‘sheep-pig’.\n\nBabe is introduced into a farm where he meets his mentor, a sheepdog named Fly. How does Babe’s method of herding sheep differ from Fly’s? What does this reflect about their personalities and roles? Which method do you think is better?\n\nIn the story, both Babe and the sheep were initially stereotyped as being stupid. Does this phenomenon exist in our society? How do they later prove the animals and humans wrong? What is the relationship between who we are and what we appear to be?\n\nIn the sheepdog trials, how is the element of teamwork and cooperation portrayed? What does Farmer Hogget mean when he tells Babe “that’ll do, pig”? What is the significance of that line? Last but not least, how does Babe and his unexpected success impress and inspire us?"
