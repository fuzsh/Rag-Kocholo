Naso outlined a six-\n\npoint plan to combat student\n\napathy, a major problem on cam-\n\npus according\n\nto Naso and\n\none vowed to\n\nfight since\n\ntaking office.\n\n'?Making\n\nstudents\n\naware and in- 'jfl\n\nooiem on ca\n\nvolving them\n\nare difficult\n\ntasks he\n\nsaid.

Students are also more\n\ncareer orientated and not general-\n\nly interested in any issues other\n\nthan those that will help them get\n\na job, he said.\n\n\"How will students be able to\n\nfunction outside the university en-\n\nvironment if they are not made\n\nmore aware of what's going on0\"\n\nhe asked. Naso said it took him\n\nsome time that getting an educa-\n\ntion is more than studying. \"Our\n\nsocial and emotional growth will\n\nnot take place by merely reading a\n\nbook he said.\n\nImproving communications will\n\nbe a major factor toward fighting\n\napathy, according to Naso. He\n\nasked the legislature to start\n\nwriting letters to various campus\n\nleaders and to become informed\n\non student problems and issues.\n\nCiting the recent meetings\n\nacross campus on raising the\n\ndrinking age, Naso said it was a\n\ngood example of a communica-\n\ntions network in action. \"We\n\nmanaged to get people together to\n\nhear what was happening\n\nNaso also suggested a student\n\nhotline. \"Much information\n\ncould be taped and heard over the\n\nphone that would give out any\n\nmessage concerning students he\n\nsaid. Naso added the service could\n\nexpand into a referral or informa-\n\ntion center.\n\n\"If students were having room-\n\nmate problems, needed a\n\ncounselor or tutor, they, especial-\n\nly new students, could get their\n\nanswers from one location he\n\nsaid. \"It's important to provide\n\nseveral ways to communicate.\n\n\"Let's also utilize the groups\n\nwe fund Naso said.

More than a\n\ndozen speakers presented their\n\nviews for and against last month's\n\ninvasion of the small Caribbean\n\nnation.\n\nAn equal number of forum par-\n\nticipants took positions that were\n\ngenerally for or against the inva-\n\nsion, while observers appeared to\n\noverwhelmingly back the presi-\n\n&SLi?

Comparing the\n\nGrenadian invasion with the 1979\n\nSoviet invasion of Afghanistan,\n\nSkidmore asked, \"Why is their\n\naction one of barbaric com-\n\nmunism and our action one of\n\nrighteousness?\n\n\"It is a sad day when no other\n\ncountry in the world can condone\n\nour action, yet the majority of\n\nde?!Sve?Iand Impress&e mifitar?\n\nvictory\n\nSupporting the invasion,\n\nmarketing student Stephen Sher-\n\nbin said for more than 100 years\n\nthe U.S. has had a policy to pro-\n\ntect the security of the Western\n\nHemisphere from external aggres-\n\nsion. \"President Reagan has pro-\n\nven that Cuban and Grenadian\n\nnational forces were actively sup-\n\nported, supplied and being led by\n\nthe Soviet Union Sherbin said\n\nadding later that America should\n\nnot be expected to \"tuck its tail\n\nbetween its legs and run at the\n\nfirst sign of trouble\n\nPolitical science student\n\nWilliam Wilson disputed\n\nReagan's excuse for invading to\n\nrescue American citizens in\n\nGrenada. \"Why had the ad-\n\nministration decided by October\n\n&V\n\nfour days before the assasination\n\nof Grenadian Prime Minister\n\nMaurice Bishop.\n\nWilson said the First Amend-\n\nThe East Carolinian\n\nGeneral Manager Named\n\nBv PATRICK\n\nSuff Writer\n\nEast Carolina Business\n\nManager Hunter Fisher was\n\nunanimously selected by the ECU\n\nMedia Board in closed session\n\nMonday as The East Carolinian's\n\nnew general manager.

The article\n\ndescribes programs at several state\n\ncolleges and universities and in-\n\ncludes reports of the efforts of\n\nsereral private colleges which are\n\nchallenging their best students.\n\n\"Economic factors play a par-\n\nticularly interesting role in the\n\n(college) choices made by gifted\n\nstudents writes C. Orey Austin,\n\nOhio State University honors\n\ndirector, in an essay. Austin says\n\n52 percent of the 4,930 1981 Na-\n\ntional Merit Scholars enrolled in\n\ninstitutions which did not fall into\n\nthe \"most prestigious\" or \"highly\n\ncompetitive\" categories in Bar-\n\nron's Guide.\n\nA recent study at an open-\n\nadmission state university reveal-\n\ned that 71.8 percent of the more\n\nable freshmen considered cost a\n\ndecisive factor in their college\n\ndecisions, while only 20.9 percent\n\nof all students considered it im-\n\nportant. Able students, assured of\n\naccess to high quality programs in\n\nboth public and private institu-\n\ntions, choose primarily on the\n\nbasis of costs, Austin says.\n\nThis isn't to say that talented\n\nstudents will suffer academic\n\ndeprivation, Austin stresses. In-\n\nstead, many students are enrolling\n\nin the honors programs now\n\nfound at more than 32 percent of\n\nthe country's colleges and univer-\n\nsities. Says Austin: \"After\n\ngraduation, many of them will\n\nmove on to prestigious graduate\n\nand professional schools to\n\ndiscover that their abilities in\n\nspeaking, writing and critial\n\nthinking are as sharply focused as\n\nthose of their fellow students who\n\nhave an Ivy League education\n\nAdmission to honors programs\n\nis usually based on high school\n\ngrades, college entrance examina-\n\ntion scores and lettes of recom-\n\nmendation.

According to\n\na number of\n\nemployers, hiring\n\nliberal arts graduates\n\nhas become increas-\n\ningly popular.\n\n\"The more\n\nsophisticated the com-\n\npany is generally, the\n\nmore it will hire\n\nliberal arts\n\ngraduates says\n\nhuman resources con-\n\nsultant Andrew A.\n\nSherwood, \"They feel\n\nthe liberal arts\n\ngraduate has plenty of\n\nbalance personally\n\nDuring the past\n\nyear, on-campus\n\nrecruiting gave more\n\njob offers in the\n\nhumanities than any\n\nother area. A survey\n\nby the College Place-\n\nment Council showed\n\na salary increase over\n\nlast year for\n\nhumanities graduates\n\n? 7.6 percent to\n\n$16,560.\n\nMoney is an impor-\n\ntant factor in hiring,\n\nas flexible graduates\n\noften can be trained\n\nto do jobs such as\n\nrunning computers. A\n\ncomputer science grad\n\nmight start at\n\n$35,000, but a liberal\n\narts grad can be hired\n\nfor less than $25,000.\n\nA 1983 Peterson's\n\nGuides survey showed\n\neven 14 percent of\n\ncomputer-related\n\ncompanies were very\n\ninterested in hiring\n\nliberal arts graduates.\n\nAmerican\n\nTelephone and\n\nTelegraph, in a\n\n20-year career study,\n\ndiscovered that well-\n\nrounded graduates\n\nwere promoted faster\n\nand performed better\n\nover the long term.\n\nAT&T cited motiva-\n\ntion, flexibility and\n\nability to accept\n\nchange as assets in\n\nfavor of these\n\nemployees.\n\nOther companies\n\nshowing strong liberal\n\narts hiring tendencies\n\ninclude General Elec-\n\ntric Co. (about 25 per-\n\ncent of their\n\nworkforce), Control\n\nData Corporation\n\n(sales, strategy and\n\nbusiness planning)\n\nand Lehman Brothers\n\nKuhn Loeb Inc\n\nwhich found that\n\nliberal arts graduates\n\nmake better liaisons\n\nbetween data process-\n\ning and other divi-\n\nsions.\n\nThere are some\n\ndrawbacks that poten-\n\ntial employees should\n\nbe aware of\n\nEmployers say\n\nmistakes are more\n\ncommon, computer\n\nprograms are often\n\nwritten with too mam\n\noptions, and of\n\ncourse, training is\n\nnecessary.

All\n\nthose people in one place talking\n\nabout a current event. At ECU.\n\nWell, it sure did happen, and those\n\n200 students who showed up at\n\nThursday's Soap Box Forum to\n\ndebate the merits of the Grenada\n\ninvasion should be congratulated\n\nfor their political awareness. More\n\nthan 20 speakers took their turn at\n\nthe podium and showed their con-\n\ncern for United States' foreign\n\npolicy.\n\nStudents seemed to realize how\n\nserious an issue the use of military\n\nforce is in today's world. We were\n\nglad to see the apathy gone and\n\nhope the experience encourages\n\nstudents to speak out more often.\n\nThose who spoke brought out\n\nthe usual facts and figures about\n\nthe situation, but the most impor-\n\ntant aspect of the afternoon was\n\ndefinitely the students themselves.\n\nHere they were, constituting by far\n\nthe largest gathering on campus\n\nfor a political affair in years, ex-\n\ncercising their freedom of speech.\n\nThose of us who use the First\n\nAmendment tool for a living\n\nrespect and admire our fellow\n\nstudents who got out and gave\n\ntheir feelings on the Grenada situa-\n\ntion.\n\nThe '80s is not a time of discon-\n\ntent. And ECU is not Berkeley. In\n\nfact, most of the students who\n\nspoke Thursday applauded the\n\npresident's move to take over the\n\nisland and install a democratic\n\nform of government. But, we as\n\nstudents on today's college cam-\n\npuses should realize we are the bas-\n\ntion of political awareness. We\n\nwho are supposedly tomorrow's\n\nintellectual leaders will be called\n\nupon in the future to do what our\n\n200 fellow students did Thursday.\n\nSo, even if we all agree, which we\n\nwon't, let's talk about it. Even if\n\nwe all love Ronnie, let's at least\n\ndiscuss what he's doing.\n\nThere are so many things that\n\nwill face the adults of the 21st cen-\n\ntury. There is poverty in the\n\nworld's streets and technology fac-\n\ning tomorrow's businessman.\n\nThere is an arms race among na-\n\ntions that could possibly end the\n\nworld. We should learn to com-\n\nmunicate our feelings in the open,\n\nin meetings designed to welcome\n\nall points of view where all can say\n\nwhat they feel. Only then can our\n\nproblems be solved. This is the\n\nlesson we must learn from the\n\nforum.\n\nYou know, Mark Twain once\n\nsaid that reports of his death were\n\ngreatly exaggerated. Well, we\n\nthink the death of ECU's\n\nawareness is definitely in the same\n\nboat.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service\n\nhas released figures that indicate\n\nthat taxes on cigarettes have slow-\n\ned down the pace of smoking. The\n\ntax is at present is 16 cents per\n\npack. This is encouraging; it shows\n\nthat a regressive tax can help stem\n\nthe public from purchasing items\n\nthat are harmful to its health.\n\nWe all know that smoking is\n\nhazardous to our health. But,\n\nsomehow, it is conviently forgot-\n\nten when the urge comes to light\n\none more up. But this is not the\n\npoint. The point is that the govern-\n\nment who taxes tobacco also warns\n\nus against it and subsidizes those\n\nwho farm it. Why is there such a\n\ncontradiction?\n\nHere in Pitt county, tobacco is\n\nbig stuff; so big that our university\n\n? all the state's universities for\n\nthat matter ? is dependent on the\n\ntobacco tax dollar. We say let's\n\nstart now to eradicate this. In an\n\nera of fitness awareness, its time to\n\nshed the plantation. If our govern-\n\nment stops, maybe we people will.\n\nPERSONALLY I IMP THE W AIRLINES WERE BEFORE DEREGULATION,\n\nGrenada Poses Questions\n\nBy WILLIAM WILSON\n\nHad President Reagan been at ECU's\n\nSoap Box Forum Thursday, he would\n\nhave been overjoyed. He had written the\n\nscript, and ECU students were following\n\nit to the letter. The forum provided an\n\nopportunity for approximately 20\n\nstudents to debate the U.S. led invasion\n\nof Grenada. Although Reagan originally\n\nlabeled the action of Oct. 25 an inva-\n\nsion, he later toned it down to read\n\n\"rescue mission\n\nSome serious questions have been pos-\n\ned by the incredible lack of finesse ex-\n\nhibited in handling the public relations\n\naspect of the entire affair. The most\n\ndistressing facet (after the loss of lives by\n\nboth sides) was the muzzling of the\n\npress. In a democracy, the most vital\n\ncondition is freedom. You may physical-\n\nly constrain an individual, but when you\n\nchain his mind, you are engaging in the\n\nmost heinous crime of ail ? the final\n\nsupression of the last bastion of free\n\nwill.\n\nIn a society such as ours, a relatively\n\nunbiased news media plays a vital role in\n\ngiving us the opportunity to exercise\n\nfreedom of choice. For a period of six\n\ndays the American public chowed down\n\nwhat the White House told them. What\n\na chilling example of Groupthink pro-\n\nphesized by George Orwell.\n\nThe original motive of rescuing the\n\nAmericans on the island was lost in the\n\nstampede of boots hitting Grenadian\n\nsoil. Oddly enough, the neat juxtaposi-\n\ntion of after the fact rationales was not\n\nharmful to Reagan's domestic standing.\n\nIt really couldn't and didn't matter\n\nbecause most Americans' minds had\n\nalready been made up. Not until six days\n\nlater when contradictory evidence was\n\navailable did we get a chance to examine\n\nthe larger issues involved. It was largely\n\nan academic question by this time\n\nbecause for a vast majority of\n\nAmericans their support was solidified\n\nfor the invasion.\n\nThe crowd that witnessed the forum\n\nwas reflective of this distressing mental\n\nmanipulation. The atmosphere assumed\n\nthe trappings of a redneck bar. These\n\npeople are supposedly today's intellec-\n\ntuals and definitly tomorrow's leaders,\n\nyet when several students screamed \"kill\n\nall commies\" and \"America love it or\n\nget the hell out the crowd roared its\n\napproval. I leave it to the reader to\n\ndecide if this is reflective of the vital\n\nqualities embodied in a university. Ar-\n\nticulate argument against the invasion\n\nfell on deaf ears while the most impas-\n\nsioned polemical diatribes were greeted\n\nby overwhelming approval.\n\nceptable. The question this raises is what\n\nis the essential cost-effectiveness equa-\n\ntion utilized in deciding to overthrow\n\none government and not others. The ob-\n\nvious answer is whatever we can get\n\naway with the least cost. If the govern-\n\nment had been honest and said, \"What\n\nthe hell. No smokescreens here. We\n\ndon't like that country's government ?\n\nit's in our hemisphere so we'll overthrow\n\nit This, of course, is naive and ob-\n\nviously would not be supported by a\n\ndemocratic populace.\n\nWhy weren't domestic avenues\n\nemployed to extricate the students\n\nThe crowd that witnessed the forum was reflective of this\n\ndistressing mental manipulation. The atmosphere assumed\n\nthe trappings of a redneck bar. These people are supposedly\n\ntomorrow's leaders, yet when several students screamed\n\n\"kill all commies\" and \"America love it or get the hell\n\nout, M the crowed roared its approval\n\nWhy are people who criticize the\n\npolicies of their government (a light\n\nresponsibility of citizens of a\n\ndemocracy) denounced as subversive\n\nelements? Instead of immediately offer-\n\ning your unquestioning support of your\n\ngovernment's action, you have a respon-\n\nsibility to stand back and look at the en-\n\ntire issue. You must learn to practice\n\neclecticism ? the examination of each\n\nissue on its individual merits and pro-\n\nblems. Unfortunatly, most Americans\n\ndo not seem sufficiently energetic to\n\nengage in the mental gymkhanas; it is\n\nsimply to taxing to make an effort to\n\nbecome sufficiently informed. This is ex-\n\nistence not living.\n\nOn the plus side, it is true that the\n\nGrenadians will probably now enjoy\n\nmore democracy than under Bishop's\n\nregime, but why did we wait until a\n\nbunch of \"Leftist thugs\" overthrew his\n\nMarxist dictatorship? The answer lies in\n\nwhat Reagan felt would be politically ac-\n\npeacefully? Because the original ra-\n\ntionale of the invasion would disappear.\n\nThe true rationale of overthrowing\n\n\"Marxist times would ?ta.rt to look like\n\nthe dichotomous rationale of end-means\n\njustification and thinly disguised im-\n\nperialism.\n\nThus to rally support domestically,\n\nthe public had to ultimately believe it\n\nwas purely a rescue mission, but \"Golly\n\ngee whiz folks once we got there you just\n\nwouldn't believe what we found. You\n\nnever seen so many AK-47s and ammo\n\nin your life. Folk's you can rest now; we\n\njust got there in the nick of time\n\nGranted, this is perhaps unusually\n\ncynical, but sometimes we can't see the\n\nforest for the trees. You owe it to\n\nyourself to examine the real reasons for\n\nthe invasion, and are the ultimate\n\nramifications of this as perhaps a policy'\n\nsetting issue? Ronald where do you draw\n\nthe line here?\n\nCampus Forum\n\nSoap Box Forum Brings Out Both Sides Of Issue\n\nIt takes two to argue. That is what\n\nPatrick O'Neill had in mind when he\n\nstaged yet another soap box forum. I\n\ngot the chance to walk and talk with\n\nhim after the forum was over. His\n\nviews on current events and politics\n\nwere frightening and somewhat sur-\n\nprising.\n\nFirst he stated emphatically, \"I am\n\nnot a communist which surprised\n\nme. I found out that he admired the\n\nempathy the Soviet Union has for\n\nSouth and Central America which\n\nfrightened me. I also found that his ac-\n\ntions were aimed at eradicating the ig-\n\nnorance college students have of their\n\ngovernment's actions in South\n\nAmerica. I got the idea that he felt the\n\nforum was a no-lose situation. That is,\n\nwhether or not the students and\n\nspeakers completely disagree with him,\n\nthe forum leaves them questioning\n\ntheir own ideas about their govern-\n\nment's actions.\n\nI agree with Mr. O'Neill on this idea\n\n? opening the student's mind. On Mr.\n\nO'Neill's other ideas we are like night\n\nand day. But I urge others to rise up\n\nand get involved with current events as\n\nMr. O'Neill has been doing for years.\n\nIf students are interested, ECU has\n\nboth Young Republican and Young\n\nDemocratic organizations. For Mr.\n\nO'Neill, I say keep reaching for the\n\nstars but please, please keep at least\n\none toe on the ground.\n\nDavid Pere\n\nSenior, Business Admn.\n\nEditor's Note ? Mr. O'Neill did not\n\nstage the Soap Box Forum. It is spon-\n\nsored by the Catholic Newman Center.\n\nSecondly, he does not admire the\n\nSoviet's \"empathy\" for South and\n\nCentral America. He believes neither\n\nthe United States or Soviet Union puts\n\nthe needs of the people of the region\n\nfirst.\n\nSoap Stained\n\nWhat started out as a lone speaker\n\nand a handful of spectators turned into\n\nvocal abuse of ideologies and an angry\n\nmass mob. The debate on the issue\n\nstarted out intelligently. Facts and\n\nfigures were presented in relatively\n\ndiplomatic ways. Yet, as the speakers\n\nspoke on, persons in the audience\n\njumped up on the soapbox. The\n\nrelatively calm speech exploded into\n\nangry shouts. Facts became more\n\nvague. Stands became confused, and\n\nthe audience fell into a let's-kill-those-\n\ncommies fever. All hope of an intellec-\n\ntual and meaningful debate was aban-\n\ndoned.\n\nThis was exemplified by the ag-\n\ngresive actions of a presumed professor\n\nwho unplugged the mike and threw the\n\nextension cord at some of the speakers\n\ntelling them to shut up.\n\nIt is appalling to think that college\n\nstudents, who are labeled as our up-\n\ncoming intellectual public, can allow\n\nthemselves to pull the wool over their\n\neyes in order to accept the easiest solu-\n\ntion. Admittedly, I know of no one\n\nwho wouldn't prefer an easier answer.\n\nYet, in the interworldngs of interna-\n\ntional politics the \"easy way out\" has\n\nbecome archaic.\n\nThe interpolitical system is just too\n\ncomplex and touchy to accept a solu-\n\ntion that the average, not very\n\nknowledgeable person on the subject\n\ncan deduce. The general public has a\n\ntendency to grasp hold of the ideas to\n\nwhich they can relate and spit out and\n\nreject the more definite facts that back\n\nup each side of the issue. The situation\n\nin front of the student store on Thurs-\n\nday pertaining to the Grenada debate\n\nresembled the adding of water to solid\n\nsoap only to create bubbles.\n\nLisaDwyer\n\nFreshmen, Pols\n\nCold On 'Chill'\n\nI was deeply offended by Mick\n\nLaSalle's attempt to review the recently\n\nreleased Big ChiU. Firstly, Mr. LaSalle\n\ndid not review the movie. He gave us\n\nhis own opinions, nauseating though\n\nthey may be, on the '60s era of history,\n\nMarxism, reptiles, Gilligan's Island,\n\nmale impotence, and the normal aging\n\nprocess. It seems the subtlety and art-\n\nful nostalgia of the \"Big Chill\"\n\nescaped LaSalle entirely.\n\nGranted, I did not grow up in the\n\n'60s; however, it seems any ignoramus\n\ncan place him or herself within the\n\nframework of reliving a college ex-\n\nperience. It is inconceivable to me to\n\nfind that, given the role of movie\n\nreviewer, Mr. LaSalle comments solely\n\non the characters' looks and sexual\n\nproclivities. (Considering LaSalle's\n\nprevious articles; however, it becomes\n\na touch more conceivable.)\n\nThis movie is one with believable\n\ncharacters, a touching theme, very art-\n\nful camera work and a fantastic sound-\n\ntrack. LaSalle, it seems, is only able to\n\ndefine these characters as nymphs,\n\n\"Meg's good friend \"Sara's\n\nhubby \"snakes \"a real slime \"a\n\ngymnast (she's a ballet dancer) and\n\n\"a real man Come on, LaSalle!\n\nWhere's your perception? In-\n\ntuitiveness? Sense of artistry? Where's\n\nyour sense?\n\nMick LaSalle's limited scope\n\nprevents me from accepting a single\n\nidea he's presented. His only saving\n\ngrace is his comedy. This guy's a joke.\n\nBarbara Dobyns\n\nEnglish\n\nRadio Wrong\n\nThis past summer, as I made three\n\ntrips to and from the Midwest, I\n\nbecame more and more aware of a\n\nphenomenon which has continued to\n\nperplex me. It was this: as I traveled\n\nand listened to the FM band, I heard\n\non the college and university stations\n\nnot rock or pops, but rather a fairly\n\nconsistent affiliation with National\n\nPublic Radio and its dedication to\n\nquality news, panel discussion and a\n\nvariety of fine music programs.\n\nI would like to list for your interest\n\nthe station whose names I can recall:\n\nUNC-Chapel Hill, Wake Forest.\n\nDavidson, University of Tennessee-\n\nMemphis, University of Tcnnessce-\n\nKnoxville, Eastern Kentucky State,\n\nMorehead State, University of Ken-\n\ntucky, University of Cincinnati, In-\n\ndiana University, Butler University, In-\n\ndiana Central College and even the In-\n\ndianapolis Public Schools' station.\n\nI know that I may have ommitted\n\nsome names, but the point is dear,\n\nlarge or small, public or private, the\n\ncollege and university stations in other\n\nareas are attempting to offer\n\nsomething more than a mere repetition\n\nof that which is so plentifully available\n\non commercial radio. Why has ECU\n\nalone of those mentioned not attemp-\n\nted to raise expectations and stan-\n\ndards? For a university community to\n\nhave a quality reputation, it must show\n\nas high a degree of regard for the\n\ncultural as for the academic and\n\nathletic.\n\nCharles W.Moore\n\nSchool of Music\n\nO'Neill No Puppet\n\nI had a hearty laugh at Charles\n\nShavitz's letter characterizing Patrick\n\nO'Neill as a puppet. I wasn't alone.\n\nRemember the spring of 1982 when\n\nMr. O'Neill joined three students from\n\nChapel Hill in a symbolic blockade of\n\nFt. Bragg? Remember how he went on\n\nto serve out two more months after the\n\nChapel Hill students paid court costs,\n\naccepted probation and were released?\n\nHe was no puppet then, and he hasn't\n\nbecome less independent in the months\n\nsince. After sharing space with men\n\njudged to be society's most dangerous\n\ncriminals, he should also be safe from\n\nany implication of cowardice.\n\nIt's a sad day for the country and,\n\nespecially, the university when its\n\nstudents can only respond to reasoned\n\nargument by name-calling. Perhaps it's\n\na result of war mentality. When the\n\nguns begin to go off and our people are\n\nkilled, an unconscious compulsion\n\ntakes over. The war drums set an insis-\n\ntent beat and everyone is required to\n\nkeep step with it.\n\nIn my own behalf and that of others\n\nwho generally agree with Mr. O'Neill\n\nbut lack his credentials, I ask, \"What's\n\nso courageous about sending young\n\nmen out to die?\" and \"What's so un-\n\npatriotic about wanting to save our\n\ncivilization and our species from\n\nnuclear destruction?\n\nEdith Webber\n\nI\n\nECU Mea,\n\nD:\n\nB PATRK K\n\nO'NEII I\n\nThe ECU M\n\nBoard Mom\n\nselected former\n\nCarolinian N\n\nEditor Err-\n\n\"Buddy' tonne:\n\nits day representatj\n\nConner, a veteran!\n\nECU student poln\n\nwill serve on\n\nboard for the\n\nmainder of\n\nEx-Re\n\nB PATRK\n\nO NFII I\n\nB\n\nstandards Hi\n\nMoss a\n\ntative of a pei\n\nhad mi\n\ngoals A g.xd\n\nden: M\n\nhis doctor\n\nbioche\n\nCathci L c J\n\nand late: eai\n\ncoveted pos I\n\ncancer res c i\n\nthe National\n\nof Hea\n\nUNC\n\nWrite\n\nBv PATRICK\n\nO'NEILL\n\nA group of law\n\nfessors at the Umi\n\nsity of of \"l\n\nCarolina-Chap?.\n\nhave written a I\n\nPresident Reagan\n\ntesting the Ui\n\nStates milita i\n\nsion of Grenada\n\nAmong the ?\n\n17 signees were\n\nneth S.

Two of the sport's\n\npremier athletes meet Nov. 10 at\n\nCeasar's Palace, Las Vegas,\n\nNeveda for the world mid-\n\ndleweight title. Scheduled for 15\n\nrounds, champion Marvelous\n\nMarvin Hagler will defend his\n\ncrown against Roberto Carlos\n\n\"Manos de Piedra\" Duran.\n\nThe event is a first in many\n\nways. These two boxers have\n\nnever met in the ring before\n\nDuran has never fought in this\n\ndivison, and it will probably be\n\nthe biggest purse ever offered for\n\na middlewight fight.\n\nThese two outstanding boxers\n\nbring incredible records into the\n\nring. Hagler (61 bouts?-57 wins,\n\n48 knockouts, 2 losses, and 2\n\ndraws) will defend his crown for\n\nthe third time this year. Duran (80\n\nbouts?76 wins, 57 by KO, four\n\nloses and 0 draws) enters the ring\n\nafter demolishing junior mid-\n\ndleweight champ Davey Moore in\n\n8 rounds.\n\nCalled today's best fighter at\n\nany weight by Ring Magazine.\n\nHagler has earned the title by\n\nfinishing opponents in a burr)\n\nSince 1978, his 21 opponents have\n\naveraged a total rate of eight\n\nrounds per match. Hagler's op-\n\nponents hae averaged only five\n\nrounds per match since he took\n\nthe title from Alan Minter on\n\nSept. 27, 1980. His last seven title\n\ndefenses ere all decided by a\n\nknockout.\n\nSimilar \"be fighter\" ac-\n\ncolades were bestowed on Duran\n\nwhen he fought as a lightweight.\n\nHe kept the light v. eight crown\n\nthrough 12 successful defenses, 11\n\nby KO. Now the owner of 3 world\n\ntitles, Duran will go for an un-\n\nprecedented fourth title against\n\nHagler. This will be the first and\n\nmaybe last attempt by Duran to\n\nachieve that goal.\n\nOddsmakers give Hagler a\n\n3-to-l nod, and most are probably\n\nlooking aTj\n\npaper, phj\n\nowns.\n\nHAGLE1\n\n29\n\n160\n\n5 )\n\n73\n\n15\"\n\n12\"\n\n12\"\n\nle v.e\n\nii wei\n\nBo\n\nadversa\n\nDuran. i\n\nLeona\n\n(or\n\neasily n\n\ndie-\n\nDave\n\ning if Du\n\ncelebrate\n\nDuran n\n\ning\n\nTr\n\ndd ha\n\nBenitez c\n\nsho\n\ng on S\n\n? ?\n\nbv D.\n\nNov\n\nbut ther\n\nThe com\n\nTh-\n\nph\n\nboxing .\n\nKO of fo\n\nPipino i\n\ncor.\n\n?siinesse\n\nBoxing\n\ndleweig\n\nfinally\n\neighth\n\n1\n\nJ\n\nCan 'Hands of Stone' Roberto Duran do tl\n\nGolden\n\nBv MICK LASALLF\n\n?MMMfea\n\nSo vou go to the football game\n\nHalf time comes, and 20 girls in\n\nmini-skirts and go-go boots run\n\nout onto the field and start kick-\n\ning their legs up in the air For me,\n\nthis part of the game's the best. 1\n\nadmit it: Mick LaSalle likes\n\nbroads better than football.\n\nYou watch them.

Two of the sport's\n\npremier athletes meet Nov. 10 at\n\nCeasar's Palace, Las Vegas,\n\nNeveda for the world mid-\n\ndleweight title. Scheduled for 15\n\nrounds, champion Marvelous\n\nMarvin Hagler will defend his\n\ncrown against Roberto Carlos\n\n\"Manos de Piedra\" Duran.\n\nThe event is a first in many\n\nways. These two boxers have\n\nnever met in the ring before.\n\nDuran has never fought in this\n\ndivison, and it will probably be\n\nthe biggest purse ever offered for\n\na middlewight fight.\n\nThese two outstanding boxers\n\nbring incredible records into the\n\nring. Hagler (61 bouts?-57 wins,\n\n48 knockouts, 2 losses, and 2\n\ndraws) will defend his crown for\n\nthe third time this year. Duran (80\n\nbouts?-76 wins, 57 by KO, four\n\nloses and 0 draws) enters the ring\n\nafter demolishing junior mid-\n\ndleweight champ Davey Moore in\n\n8 rounds.\n\nCalled today's best fighter at\n\nany weight by Ring Magazine,\n\nHagler has earned the title by\n\nfinishing opponents in a hurry.\n\nSince 1978, his 21 opponents have\n\naveraged a total rate of eight\n\nrounds per match. Hagler's op-\n\nponents have averaged only five\n\nrounds per match since he took\n\nthe title from Alan Minter on\n\nSept. 27, 1980. His last seven title\n\ndefenses were all decided by a\n\nknockout.\n\nSimilar \"best fighter\" ac-\n\ncolades were bestowed on Duran\n\nwhen he fought as a lightweight.\n\nHe kept the lightweight crown\n\nthrough 12 successful defenses, 11\n\nby KO. Now the owner of 3 world\n\ntitles, Duran will go for an un-\n\nprecedented fourth title against\n\nHagler. This will be the first and\n\nmaybe last attempt by Duran to\n\nachieve that goal.\n\nOddsmakers give Hagler a\n\n3-to-l nod, and most are probably\n\nlooking at the decided, if only on\n\npaper, physical advantage Hagler\n\nowns.

He out dueled Sugar Ray\n\nLeonard for the welterweight title,\n\n(only to lose it in a rematch) and\n\neasily won his junior mid-\n\ndleweight crown from the taller\n\nDavey Moore. But many are ask-\n\ning if Duran's comback is for real.\n\nAfter losing to Leonard in the\n\ncelebrated \"no mas\" debacle,\n\nDuran has struggled. The Nov.\n\n25, 1980 bout had many wonder-\n\ning if Duran was finished.\n\nThree lackluster fights in 1982\n\ncould have ended Duran's career.\n\nA loss in 15 rounds to Wilfred\n\nBenitez on Jan. 20, and a horrible\n\nshowing in a loss to Kirkland La-\n\ning on Sept. 4 had many thinking\n\nit was the end. A pot-bellied, flab-\n\nby Duran took on Jimmy Batten\n\nNov. 12, and Duran won in 10,\n\nbut there was little to celebrate.\n\nThe comeback wasn't working.\n\nThen came two stunning trium-\n\nphs in '83. First, the near perfect\n\nboxing display in a fourth-round\n\nKO of former welterweight champ\n\nPipino Cuevas on Jan. 29. Se-\n\ncond, a national T V audience\n\nwitnessed Duran punish World\n\nBoxing Association junior mid-\n\ndleweight champ Davey Moore,\n\nfinally dumping Moore in the\n\neighth.\n\nTwo questions remain for\n\nDuran to answer. Is the comeback\n\ncomplete? And, can he stay in the\n\nring with a middleweight like\n\nMarvin Hagler?\n\nMarvelous Marvin Hagler will\n\nhave to work Nov. 10 if he wants\n\nto keep his title. 1983 has been an\n\neasy year for the champ. He has\n\nfought twice and on each occasion\n\nbreezed through his opponents.\n\nOn Feb. 11, Tony Sibson lasted\n\nonly six rounds with Hagler in\n\nwhat looked like a training session\n\nfor the champ.\n\nNext came Wilford Scypion on\n\nMay 27. At 2:47 of the fourth\n\nround, Hagler finished Scypion\n\nwith a flurry of punches coming\n\nfrom every direction. Scypion was\n\nnever in the bout and probably\n\nshould have remained in his dress-\n\ning room. Form the opening bell it\n\nwas all Hagler's show.\n\nThese two opponents were not\n\n\"journey-man\" punching bags\n\nthrown into a wolf's den. Ring\n\nMagazine continues to rate the\n\npair in the top five of world-class\n\nboxers. As was the case with\n\nMustafa Hamsho and Fulgencio\n\nObelmejias, Hagler simply\n\ndestroyed his opponents.\n\nThere are few if any major\n\nquestions Hagler must answer on\n\nNov. 10. Unlike Duran, Hagler is\n\nthe undisputed champion and not\n\na doubtful performer. He is in\n\npeak shape and in his prime. Only\n\nthe fight's setting is a source of\n\nnegative deja vu for the champ.\n\nIt was in Las Vegas that Hagler\n\nboxed to a draw with then mid-\n\ndleweight champ Vito Antuofer-\n\nmo after 15 tough rounds. Vito\n\nkept the title as a weary Hagler\n\nwaned in the closing rounds on\n\nNov. 30, 1979. Hagler's other\n\nVegas match, a 10-round decision\n\nover Marcos Geraldo on May 17,\n\n480, was not his best, but it served\n\nas a tune-up for his victory over\n\nAlan Minter.\n\nThe Minter bout won Hagler\n\nthe middleweight crown on Sept.\n\n27, '80. Minter lasted only 3\n\nMarvelous Marvin Hagler shows why he is called the best fighter in the\n\nCan 'Hands of Stone Roberto Duran do the impossible and crush middleweight champ Marvin Hagler?\n\nrounds as Hagler took control\n\nearly and never let up. That fight\n\nwas stopped to prevent further\n\nharm to a bloodied, battered\n\nMinter. Druken fans, irate at the\n\ncall, trashed the ring with\n\nanything that could be thrown.\n\nChairs, bottles, and bricks nar-\n\nrowly missed Hagler, and he was\n\nlucky to escape the crowd without\n\nbeing hurt.\n\nHagler hasn't had any close\n\ncalls since then; there have been\n\nno more riots to contend with,\n\nand the opposition, except for\n\nHamsho, has proven ineffective.\n\nDuran will be Hagler's next test.\n\nCan the \"Hands of Stone\" stop\n\nthe world's best boxer?\n\nThe Undercard: Roldan vs. The\n\nAnimal\n\non the same bill with Hagler-\n\nDuran, Frank \"The Animal\"\n\nFletcher will meet Juan Domingo\n\nRoldan. There is no title at Make\n\nfor their bout, but the winner has\n\nbeen guaranteed a match with\n\nwhoever holds the middleweight\n\ntitle after Nov. 10. Fletcher is a\n\nhighly regarded middleweight\n\nknown for his strength and\n\nstamina rather than his finesse in\n\nthe ring.\n\nRanked third in the world by\n\nRing Magazine as of October,\n\nFletcher has performed in\n\nnumerous televised bouts.\n\nFollowers of ESPN, the sports\n\ncable channel, will remember Flet-\n\ncher as the winner of that net-\n\nwork's middleweight title in 1980.\n\n\"The Animal\" has fought twice\n\nin '83.\n\nAfter losing the NBC televised\n\nbout with Wilfred Scypion in 12\n\nrounds, Fletcher regained his\n\nform by stopping Curtis Ramsey\n\non July 5 in eight rounds. \"I stop-\n\nped him with body shots Flet-\n\ncher told the East Carolinian.\n\nHis upcoming bout with\n\nRoldan does not have him wor-\n\nried. \"The guy can't fight; I'U\n\nknock him out in the sixth\n\nround said Fletcher. The\n\nnatural southpaw from\n\nPhiladelphia feels his style is a\n\ndefinite advantage.\n\nJuan Domingo Roldan is a\n\nrelatively unknown middleweight\n\nboxer, although the Argentine\n\nchamp is rated the World Boxing\n\nAssociation's number-one con-\n\ntender. Roldan has fought three\n\ntimes in '83. One bout was his\n\ndebut in America, and this fight in\n\nVegas marks the third time he has\n\nbeen on an undercard with\n\nHagler.\n\nOn February 11, Roldan KOd\n\nWilbur Henderson in eight prior\n\nto the Hagler-Sibson match. His\n\nsecond appearance in the U.S.\n\nsaw him outpoint \"Irish\" Teddy\n\nMann on May 27, Hagler-Scypion\n\nbeing the main event.\n\nMany experts viewed the match\n\nas unimpressive. If Roldan is to\n\none day challenge the likes of\n\nHagler, he'll have to improve\n\nagainst Fletcher, according to the\n\n\"experts\n\nWi iti ft for tti0& ' MMkte\n\n\"The Bible Of Boxing Nigel\n\nCollins sees their match-up a less\n\nthan artistic show. \"It will be a\n\nstrength rather than skill\n\ncontest he said. \"Roldan's\n\nnumber one rating by the WBA is\n\na political decision more than\n\nanything else he added.\n\nWhatever the outcome for Flet-\n\ncher or Roldan, the winner gets a\n\nguaranteed match with the mid-\n\ndleweight champ in 1984. Neither\n\nhas fought for a world title\n\nbefore. The prospects could make\n\neach boxer hungry for the glory\n\nand money associated with a\n\nworld crown.\n\nTough Ghetto Kids\n\nThe careers of Hagler and\n\nDuran follow a typical pattern ex-\n\nperienced by many boxers. Hagler\n\nis a product of a Newark, N.J.\n\nghetto. He survived the slums by\n\nhis involvement in athletics.\n\n\"Sports kept me away from drugs\n\nand the gangs when I was a little\n\nkid in Newark Hagler said in an\n\ninterview.\n\n\"I wanted to be a Mickey Man-\n\nworld at any weight.\n\ntie, a Floyd Patterson one of\n\nthe best athletes ever he said.\n\nHagler left the ghetto and moved\n\nto Brockton, Massachusetts at 17.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Goody and\n\nPat Petronelli, brothers and ex-\n\nboxers, Hagler began his road to\n\nthe championship.\n\nIt was Hagler who told the\n\nbrothers, \"I was born a cham-\n\npion Struggling for money and\n\nrecognition, the trio made it\n\nthrough some lean years. Often\n\nreceiving purses of $50, $100, or\n\n$200, Hagler's career took off\n\nwhen Steve Wainwright, a\n\nBrockton lawyer, entered his life\n\nin 1978.\n\nHagler won the U.S. mid-\n\ndleweight title that year from\n\nDoug Demmings on April 7.\n\nLater, he KOd former Olympic\n\ngold medalist Sugar Ray Scales in\n\nround 1 on Febuary 2, '79. That\n\nyear also brought Hagler into the\n\nring for a shot at the world title.\n\nAfter 15 punishing rounds, the\n\nmatch was scored a draw, and\n\nVito Antuofermo retained the ti-\n\ntle.\n\nThat blemish, along with\n\nanother draw and two losses, have\n\nall been removed. In rematches\n\nwith those opponents, Hagler\n\nscored impressive KOs against all\n\nfour.\n\nHagler considers himself a\n\nhungry fighter ? hungry for\n\nmoney and the fame that general-\n\nly eludes boxers even with\n\ndistinguished careers. \"I still fight\n\nlike a challenger because it took\n\nme a long time to get the title he\n\nsaid.\n\nThis will be a big payday for\n\nHagler, the first since winning the\n\ntitle. The winner will reportedly\n\nreceive $12 million. It will give\n\nHagler the financial security he\n\nhas sought.\n\n\"I'm trying to make as much\n\nmoney as possible for the security\n\nof my wife and kids he said.\n\nBoxing is Hagler's life.\n\nHagler's challenger, Roberto\n\nDuran, began his life in a ghetto\n\nsimilar to the champ's.

Whether it suc-\n\nceeds depends on your point of\n\nview, whether you're a College\n\nRepublican or a member of the\n\nGreenville Peace Committee.\n\nCalled a \"dark comedy\" by its\n\nmakers, the film shifts from com-\n\nedy, to drama, to utire. Even\n\ndirector William Friedkin admits\n\nthe balance between comedy and\n\nseriousness is a major problem\n\nwith the film.\n\nThe movie begins in a provin-\n\ncial town somewhere in Central\n\nAmerica. Cynical wiseguy Eddie\n\nMuntz (played by a thick-waisted\n\nChevy Chase) sets the opening\n\ntone by saying, \"It's only my se-\n\ncond day here, and already I'd\n\nlike to hitchhike to Jonestown\n\nMuntz is a second-hand weapons\n\ndealer peddling small arms to all\n\nparties in this bannana republic.\n\nHe sells pistols, automatic rifles\n\nand hand grenades to peasant\n\nrebels one day, and sells more\n\nguns and ammo to the military\n\ngovernment the rebels are attack-\n\ning the next day.\n\nJust before a meeting with rebel\n\nbuyers, Muntz mutters, \"When\n\nthe going gets tough, never\n\nunderestimate the power of a\n\ndemonstration We see what a\n\n\"demonstration\" is in the next\n\nscene. Like a slick-talking vacuum\n\ncleaner salesman, Muntz clinches\n\na sale by demonstrating a Tank-\n\nBuster bazooka on a government\n\njeep parked across the street from\n\nthe cheap hotel he's operating\n\nfrom. He obliterates the jeep, and\n\nthe bazooka rocket's exhaust\n\nnearly obliterates the rebels stan-\n\nding behind him.\n\nBy chance, Muntz stumbles into\n\nbig-time arms dealing. After\n\nwaiting six weeks in a sweaty hotel\n\nroom for a contract-clinching\n\nphone call that hasn't come, the\n\nsales rep for Luckup Aerospace\n\nIndustries blows his brains out\n\nwith a .38 revolver. Before the\n\nsales rep's corpse is even cold, the\n\nphone rings, and Muntz steps in\n\nand makes the multi-million\n\ndollar arms sale.\n\nAt this point the plot twists.\n\nComedy gives way to a sfange\n\nmixture of satire and drama as\n\nMuntz moves higher in the world\n\nof international asms marketing.\n\nRay Kasternak (Gregory Hines),\n\nMuntz's partner in arms peddling,\n\nbegins to question the morality of\n\ntheir business as the deadliness of\n\ntheir weapons increases. Muntz\n\ncounters, \"All we're doing, Ray,\n\nis selling a commodity, like Coca\n\nCola. If we don't make the sale,\n\nsomebody else will\n\nBecasue of his smooth expertise\n\nwith the Latinos, Muntz becomes\n\nLuckup's new sales rep for the\n\n\"Peacemaker a deadly\n\ncomputer-controlled drone air-\n\ncraft. Fellow opportunist\n\nCatherine DeVoto (Sigourney\n\nWeaver) joins Muntz in his quest\n\nfor the big bucks.

The bottom\n\nline is sales and money. Luckup\n\nmarketing v.p. Frank Stryker\n\n(Vince Edwards) expresses this\n\nsuccinctly when he says, \"We're\n\nnot competing against the Rus-\n\nsians. Our advisary is Northrop,\n\nRockwell, McDonald Douglas\n\nand all the other corporate arms\n\nmanufacturers.\n\nRay finally turns against the\n\narms business. He accepts Jesus\n\nand is baptized in a hotel swimm-\n\ning pool. Muntz, however, even\n\ngoes so far as to pimp girlfriend\n\nDeVoto to the dictator to finalize\n\nthe Peacemaker deal. But by the\n\nmovie's end, even Muntz sees the\n\ninsanity of the business and swit-\n\nches to the used car game.\n\nDespite the confusion in Deal\n\nof the Century over just how\n\nseriously it takes it's own\n\nmessage, the film does avoid\n\nmoralistic lecturing. Rather than\n\npreaching against corporate arms\n\nmerchants, it uses low-key satire.\n\nFor example, a powerful Arab\n\narms dealer explains to Muntz\n\nabout the business acumen of sell-\n\ning arms to Third World coun-\n\ntries: \"Whoever wins, we win.\n\nWhoever loses, we win And in a\n\ntelephone conversation with a\n\nThird World buyer, Muntz says,\n\n\"You need 500 anti-tank\n\nweapons!
