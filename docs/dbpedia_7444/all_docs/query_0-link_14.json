        "text": "Released 1995 Duration 89 minutes Director Chris Noonan Written by Dick King-Smith (novel The Sheep Pig), George Miller & Chris Noonan (screenplay) Studio Universal Pictures Rated G\n\nBabe is a 1995 movie based on the novel The Sheep Pig (published in America as Babe: The Gallant Pig). In addition to the use of live animals, Jim Henson's Creature Shop supplied realistic animatronic animals for Babe (approximately 50% of the total shots), Ferdinand the Duck (approximately 50% of the total shots), Fly and Rex the sheepdogs (approximately 10% of the total shots), Duchess the Cat (approximately 90% of the total shots), and the singing mice (100% of the total shots). Standing, sitting and lying models were created, as well as hand-puppet versions for certain scenes. John Cox's Creature Workshop supplied the sheep, and Rhythm and Hues created the CGI lipsync of the real animals.\n\nThe 1998 sequel, Babe: Pig in the City, was made without Creature Shop involvement.\n\nThe film won an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, with the Creature Shop's Neal Scanlan sharing with visual effects supervisors from other studios.\n\nCast[]\n\nLive Cast\n\nJames Cromwell as Farmer Arthur Hoggett\n\nMagda Szubanski as Mrs. Esme Hoggett\n\nZoe Burton as Daughter\n\nPaul Goddard as Son-in-Law\n\nWade Hayward as Grandson\n\nBrittany Byrnes as Granddaughter\n\nMary Acres as Valda\n\nMarshall Napier as Chairman of Judges\n\nVoices\n\nChristine Cavanaugh as Babe\n\nMiriam Margolyes as Fly\n\nDanny Mann as Ferdinand\n\nHugo Weaving as Rex\n\nMiriam Flynn as Maa\n\nRussi Taylor as Duchess\n\nEvelyn Krape as Old Ewe\n\nMichael Edward-Stevens as Horse\n\nCharles Bartlett as Cow\n\nPaul Livingston as Rooster\n\nRoscoe Lee Browne as Narrator\n\nPerformance Puppeteers: Mak Wilson, David Greenaway, Allan Trautman, Ian Tregonning\n\nAssistant Puppeteers: David Collins, Janet Dalgliesh, Terry Ryan, Hugh Simpson\n\nCredits[]\n\nCreature Shop Supervisor: John Stephenson\n\nCreative Project Supervisor: Neal Scanlan\n\nHead of Production: William Plant\n\nAnimal Visual Designers: Jeremy Hunt, Graham High, Barry Sutton\n\nCGI Sculptor: John Coppinger\n\nFur Design Specialist: Val Jones\n\nFeather and Anatomy Designer: Monique Brown\n\nAnimatronic Designers: Chris Barton, Chris Howes, Tim Jordan, Jim Machin, Jason Reed, Joe Scott\n\nWorkshop Supervisor: Geoff Paige\n\nTrivia[]\n\nIn media coverage of the film, and the Creature Shop's involvement, inevitable comparisons were made to the most famous puppet pig:\n\n“One pig who thrives on human attention is Jim Henson's Miss Piggy. Was the sultry sow, as rumored, angry she didn't land the part of Babe? \"Hogwash\", says Lynn Calle of Jim Henson's Creature Shop: \"Miss Piggy doesn't acknowledge she's a pig. She's upset she's not getting parts that go to Michelle Pfeiffer.\"[1]”\n\nReferences[]\n\nDuring the 68th Academy Awards that were held on March 25, 1996, Miss Piggy intercepts a video conference uplink between host Whoopi Goldberg and nominee Babe in order to assert her porcine ranking in Hollywood by offering to save the show with one of her sensational production numbers she titles \"Porkahontas,\" but instead the audience is saved by the recovery of the initial connection.\n\nOn November 12, 1996, Kermit appeared on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. He mentioned that Miss Piggy was giving him a tough time since Babe came out and got nominated for an Academy Award. He also explains that he felt a strange attraction to the film.\n\nIn Sesame Street Episode 4142, the number 0 is fed up with representing \"nothing,\" so he poses as a pig, dubbing himself \"Babe.\"\n\nSources[]\n\n[]\n\nIMDb"
