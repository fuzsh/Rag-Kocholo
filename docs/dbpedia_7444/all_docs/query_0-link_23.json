        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) has evolved in recent decades from a typical forest edge and scrub habitat dweller to an inhabitant of diverse habitat types [1, 2]. As a typical synanthropic species, it increasingly uses agricultural habitats, where the energy supply is sometimes even higher than in pure forest areas and to which it is optimally adapted to browse [3, 4]. Nevertheless, various types of forest, alpine areas, or grassland farming are also used by roe deer. The diverse habitats give the animals different forage offers, both seasonally and regionally, because of the plant availability and nutrient composition [3, 5, 6].\n\nThe essential tool for adaptation to these conditions is the ruminal microbiome of the roe deer, which is the key for the ruminant to access energy and nutrients from the plants. The rumen forms the first anaerobic digestive chamber and is inhabited by a diverse microbial community. The bacteria and fungi living in it provide the required carbohydrate-active enzymes for the hydrolysation of complex polysaccharides. The following microbial fermentation processes generate volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which the host uses as a primary energy source [7, 8]. In addition to active fermentation, the microbiome also serves as an essential non-vegetable protein source for the host forming the central part of the protein that the host can digest. Most of the protein supplied through food intake is converted directly into ammonia and is then used to build microbial protein [9].\n\nThe roe deer is a selector [4] and can efficiently break down and utilise high fibre content in the ingested forage. Thanks to microbial plasticity, they are largely resistant to changes in diet composition [3]. It shows snacking habits and consumes many different plants per browsing period. It prefers young shoots, buds, shrub fruits, tree fruits, and herbs, if available [10]. However, grass and woody plant parts are also integral to the diet. Over 300 plant species are known to be ingested by the deer [6, 11, 12], which adapts to the seasonal and local supply. The roe deer takes its forage, distributed over the day, in an average of 8–11 browsing periods [11, 12]. The passage rate is, therefore, much faster than for typical grazers [11]. In times of lower or less diverse food availability, however, it can also adapt to even more fibre-rich food, which has to stay longer in the rumen. One adaptation mechanism is, for example, the increased filling of the rumen per browsing period in winter and the resulting longer digestion and rumination times [4].\n\nThe degree of tolerance to the fibre content in selectors (or browsers) is still highly discussed. Although there is sufficient evidence to the contrary, it is still often said that selectors can only utilise small amounts of fibre and depend on forage with a very high protein and energy content, even in scientific circles. Browsing areas are often evaluated only based on the protein content of the plants. It was also assumed for a long time that selectors such as roe deer had hardly any cellulose-utilising bacteria in their rumen [13]. But fortunately, the point of view has slowly changed. The rigid picture of categorising ruminants as roughage eaters, intermediate types, and concentrate selectors [11] is being replaced by the knowledge that the transitions between the individual feeding types are fluid. Therefore, we can speak of a “browser-grazer continuum” [14]. However, the field of wildlife nutrition continues to offer much potential for further research.\n\nThe extent to which ruminants adapt smoothly to nutritional changes is known mainly from numerous dairy cow, beef cattle, and sheep studies [15–17]. Literature on wild ruminants is rather limited and often based on minimum sample size [18]. In addition, the correct identification and functional assignment of individual bacterial genera of the microbiota is not trivial, as many species still need to be isolated and described [19]. So, there is still an enormous gap in knowledge in this field.\n\nThis study aims to identify the core microbiota of Bavarian roe deer and promote a basis for future comparability of wildlife studies. The second aim was to describe the variations of the rumen microbiota and its fermentation products of free-living roe deer from seven different characteristic Bavarian habitat types throughout the year. When communicating with parties involved in wildlife management (such as foresters, hunters, or farmers), it is often argued that results from other habitats are not comparable to their local situation. To avoid this, the most characteristic and extreme Bavarian habitat communities from different growth areas were selected in this study to present a comprehensive picture.\n\nWe hypothesise that a dynamic adaptation of the nutritional conditions is reflected by changes in the rumen microbiota depending on the respective ecological habitat.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe present study investigated 311 rumen contents and the microbiota of wild roe deer living in seven different habitats across different seasons, animal ages, and gender. Especially based on a large number of samples, this study provides many more insights about wild ruminants and their microbiome as the number of studies is limited in contrast to domesticated ruminants. To the best of the author’s knowledge, only four publications studied European roe deer using amplicon sequencing methods [19, 36–38], and one the Chinese roe deer [39]. These studies mainly lack a representative number of rumen samples varying between 3 and 19. Studies with larger numbers of samples from deer were only carried out with faecal samples (red deer, 136 faecal samples) [40].\n\nThe challenge with relatively unexplored microbiomes is a large number of unclassified species. Previous studies in wild animals found a considerable number of unclassified OTUs [19, 35, 41, 42], as observed in the present study. Similarities were found at the phylum level between the present and previous studies focused on the roe deer ruminal microbiome by Ricci et al. [19] and Wilson et al. [37] and also in the rumen content of other wild ruminants, such as reindeer, elk, bison, moose, red deer, and sika deer [40, 42–48]. Firmicutes (Bacillota) was the dominant phylum, followed by Bacteroidota.\n\nThe rumen microbial ecosystem is dominated by a core community comprising Prevotella, unclassified Clostridiales, unclassified Bacteroidales, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcus, and Butyrivibrio, known as the “core microbiome”, which is found in domesticated and wild ruminants around the world [35, 41]. All these genera are present in the samples, but an exact comparison of the genera is not possible due to a deeper taxonomy classification. The core microbiota of the current Bavarian roe deer study contains five genera. The most frequently represented genus in the present samples is Christensenellaceae (R-7). In the worldwide comparison, Prevotella is in the lead, which is the second most common species in the roe deer samples.\n\nThe observed differences in microbial composition due to various habitats and the apparent impact of the forage were also studied for other wild ruminants, including reindeer and moose [42, 43], but mostly selectively composed diets were used [19, 49]. A high proportion of concentrate feed often characterises these. In other publications, natural forage was compared with selectively composed diets in the husbandry of actual wild ruminants [19, 40, 45, 47, 48, 50, 51].\n\nThe significant difference between the age classes can be explained by the animals eating different forages at different stages of development. It should be noted, however, that the data on juveniles are only available from September to April due to hunting seasons. Seasonal effects are caused by the sometimes strongly differing forage availability per season and were already analysed for Sika and White-tailed deer [52, 53].\n\nIn this study, we compared roe deer from seven different habitat types, representing Bavaria’s most characteristic and extreme habitats. The analysis of the crude nutrient and the plant species composition in the rumen contents showed that the roe deer are confronted with very different forage offers. This is also reflected in the ruminal microbiota. The average cross-habitat crude protein content is 23.6%. This is slightly lower than in the previous study (27.4%), in which only two habitats were investigated [3]. It must be considered that a large part of this is microbial protein and that vegetable protein is quickly converted into ammonia. A confirmation of that is that the ingested plants have significantly lower protein contents (coniferous trees: ~12.9%/DM; shrubs: ~17.3%/DM; herbs: ~19.4%/DM; grasses: ~3–12.6%/DM [54, 55]). Furthermore, nitrogen can be recovered via the ruminal-hepatic cycle. The average NFC content of 14.9% was higher than in the previous study (11.1%). As expected, the average fibre content (47.9% NDF, 27.8% CF) was high and corresponded to the values from the preliminary study (47.6% NDF, 27.8% CF). The protein content in the rumen content always reaches its minimum, and the total fibre content is at its maximum in winter (with the only exception: habitat ABF), regardless of how large the respective proportions are in the habitat as a whole. However, there are big differences between the individual fibre fractions.\n\nThanks to recent findings and the switch from the rigid classification into feeding categories, it is known that roe deer are pretty tolerant of high fibre content. This does not only apply to so-called intermediate types or roughage eaters [3, 14]. However, there are many differences between the seven habitats, some of which are significant, and each habitat has its own specific browsing range and nutrient profile. Commonalities, as demonstrated in Fig. , were found among all forest habitats (beech, spruce, grassland spruce and mountain forest), which are dominated by similar tree species, as well as shrub and dwarf shrub communities. Furthermore, the agricultural and agricultural beech habitats show strong similarities in cultivating the agricultural areas and the field edge vegetation. The pine habitat forms more of a cluster with the two agricultural habitats, which may indicate a tendency toward monoculture. The pine stands here are almost pure, and the ground vegetation is relatively poor in species. Likewise, the plant culture in the agricultural area is very one-sided in larger sections. Further correlations can be seen in the Shannon diversity index (Fig. B), which is higher in the alpine habitats GSF and AMF, which could indicate adaptation to higher altitude habitats. Inhabitants of high altitudes have been described as having a more diverse microbiome than inhabitants of lowlands [56].\n\nInterrelationships can also be depicted at the functional level. Functional relationships between microbial abundance in the rumen content and nutrient supply can be identified in several habitats. A correlation between nutrients, fermentation products, and the core microbiota members was shown for individual genera. Still, not all of them can be explained based on the literature. The genus Prevotella, for example, shows a significant decrease in association with increasing acetic acid, which is fibre-associated, whereas Prevotella is clearly protein-associated. The significant decrease in Oscillospiraceae (NK4A214) associated with increasing propionic acid results from cellulolytic properties [57], mainly increasing acetic acid production. Christensenellaceae (R-7) is also described in the literature as an acetic acid producer and fibre utiliser [57], so the positive correlation with propionic acid cannot be explained or must be influenced by unknown factors. The ammonia found in rumen contents is primarily the product of the breakdown of vegetable protein. A negative correlation with mainly fibre-associated species, like Christensenellaceae (R-7), Oscillospiraceae (NK4A214), and unclassified Lachnospiraceae [58], can therefore be explained.\n\nThe Eggerthellaceae (DNF00809), the core microbiota’s last representative, are significantly increasing with increasing NFC and NDF content. The Eggerthellaceae are known for degrading polyphenols [59], which could explain the association with fibre content. Another known function of the Eggerthellaceae is their involvement in maintaining homeostasis [60], which could explain a link with NFC content.\n\nAcross all habitats, a very differentiated, habitat-specific composition of the microbiota can be identified. Even four of the five taxa of the core microbiota show significant differences between the habitats. Not all habitat-specific distributions can be explained, as there are still many unclassified genera in the microbiome of wild ruminants whose functional assignment is unclear. However, some clear correlations can be shown between the available forage, the nutrients thus consumed, and the resulting microbiota.\n\nThe agriculture habitat (AG) was characterised by high protein availability, and hemicellulose dominated the fibre fractions. Hemicellulose is found in large amounts in field crops and sweet grasses, an essential part of the forage in this habitat. The lignin content was highest in winter and spring when many woody branches and shrubs were eaten. In autumn, on the other hand, the NFC content dominates due to tree fruits, which are increasingly found in the tree communities at the edges of the fields [6]. Accordingly, proteolytic genera such as Prevotella, Prevotellaceae (UCG001) [61], and Family XIII AD 3011group [62] play an important role here. Prevotella also has hemicellulolytic properties [61]. In contrast, Ruminococcus, Oscillospiraceae, and Clostridia are specialised in fibre utilisation [63, 64], especially cellulose [58], were present in significantly low numbers. Tyzzerella is described as a pathogenic bacterium [65] and occurs more frequently in spring. From winter to spring, the microbiota in the habitat AG changes very strongly (see Fig. S3). The increased occurrence of Tyzzerella at this time could possibly be connected to a microbial imbalance.\n\nThe Agriculture-Beech-Forest habitat (ABF) included large areas of agricultural land but also beech and oak-hornbeam forests [66]. The total fibre content in the rumen contents was relatively low. Protein and NFC content were in the mid-range. The NFC content was highest in autumn when the deer could browse the numerous beech and oak tree fruits [66]. These were available in large quantities, especially in the sample year 2018, as this was a fattening year for both species. The particularly high levels of ammonia, lactate, and some VFAs were also striking. This could explain the importance of the Ralstonia genus. Ralstonia is known to utilise VFAs and is capable of denitrification under anaerobic conditions [67, 68]. An N surplus in the course of the harvests could be an explanation for particularly high Ralstonia proportions in autumn. The proteolytic and pectinolytic genera Prevotella, Prevotellaceae (UCG 001), and Prevotellaceae (UCG 003) are also found in significant abundance in this agricultural habitat. As an important cellulolytic genus, Treponema [69] occurs in significantly high abundances in this habitat.\n\nLarge areas of pure beech forest are also located north of Bavaria, as in habitat beech forest (BF) [70, 71]. The rumen content contained significantly more total fibres with a high cellulose content. The protein content was in the medium range, and the NFC content was slightly below average. The seasonal fluctuations in this habitat were strongly reflected in the crude nutrient profile. A large proportion of shrubs (mainly) in the rumen contents dominated almost at all times of the year; only in spring do the conifers predominate, when presumably only a few deciduous shrubs are still to be found. Accordingly, high total fibre contents are found in the rumen content in winter and spring. Appropriately, the proportion of uncultured Lachnospiraceae and Enterococcus, which have fibrolytic properties [58, 72], occurs in significantly high abundances. In summer, tree and shrub fruits and herbs are added, which explains the crude protein and NFC peak in summer. The NFC content remains relatively high even in autumn when abundant beechnuts are available to the animals. The low proportion of Prevotella, Prevotellaceae (UCG 001), and Prevotellaceae (UCG 003) can be explained by the overall relatively low crude protein content and higher Olsenella (glucose fermenters) and Latilactobacillus (saccharolytic) proportions [73, 74], possibly by the higher sugar content in the forage in the summer months.\n\nAnother extreme habitat is the almost pure pine forests (PF) in the Upper Palatinate Basin [75, 76]. Accordingly, strong seasonal fluctuations in the nutrient profile are also reflected here. In this habitat, the deer mainly use dwarf shrubs, especially blueberry. Tree and field fruits, berries, cherries and apples are also on the otherwise very fibrous menu, depending on the season. The crude nutrient profile shows significantly high total fibre values, which, as expected, are highest in winter and lowest in summer. Again, the crude protein content is highest in summer, when shrubs, trees, and field crops supplement the forage. A clear connection can be drawn between the high proportions of Ruminococcus, which show their highest values in winter, parallel to the fibre values. The increased starch content of crops such as maize can explain the high proportion of Streptococci in summer. For the Eggerthellaceae (DNF00809), it is known that an essential function of genera belonging to this family is the maintenance or support of homeostasis [60], and they are increased by stress exposure. Since this genus is also more abundant in summer, this could be related to the forage’s significantly higher protein and starch content in summer. Genus Syntrophococcus is another fascinating bacteria with the highest abundance in habitat PF (1.15%). These bacteria can demethylate lignin [77]. The breakdown of lignin is otherwise only known from anaerobic fungi but not from rumen bacteria.\n\nIn contrast, the spruce forest habitat SF in the south of Munich [78] has high crude protein content in the nutrient profile. The total fibre content is also high over the year, with a high proportion of hemicellulose and lower cellulose content. Especially in winter, the animals must resort to coniferous wood, while herbs strongly dominate the forage composition the rest of the year. This explains the high protein content, which peaks in summer. In addition to deciduous wood and shrubs, the forage is strongly supplemented by forbs, cryptogams in autumn, and field crops in summer. The high protein content probably also explains the high proportion of proteolytic Prevotella, Prevotellaceae (UCG 001), Prevotellaceae (UCG 003), Butyrivibrio, and Eubacterium nodatum group [61, 79–81]. Most of them can also utilise hemicelluloses well [61, 80].\n\nCharacteristic Bavarian habitats are the alpine areas, which roe deer use up to a certain altitude. An important pre-alpine area is grassland farming, which is complemented by forest areas [82]. The Grassland-Spruce-Forest habitat (GSF) has a high NFC content in the nutrient profile. The total fibre and crude protein content are average. The total fibre content is highest in winter and lowest in spring. The lignin content is comparatively high, as is the cellulose content. In contrast, the crude protein content is highest in spring. The high protein content in spring can probably also be explained by the increased browsing of herbs in this habitat. However, the correlation between the botanical rumen content analysis (BRCA) and the crude nutrient profile must be considered with reservations, as only 13 samples from the BRCA were examined in this habitat. Moreover, these were mainly from the winter months, which also explains the relatively high proportion of anthropogenic bait feed in the form of apple pomace in the rumen contents. Significantly high abundances of cellulolytic unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Treponema, and Eubacterium hallii group can be explained by the high cellulose contents [58, 69, 79]. The saccharolytic genus Marvinbryantia [69] also has significantly high proportions, which fits with the high NFC values.\n\nThe Alpine Mountain Forest habitat (AMF) is in the middle of the mixed mountain forest of the Ruhpolding Limestone Alps [83]. Due to the alpine location, the animals living here must be able to adapt quickly to changing weather conditions and endure distinct seasons. The NFC content is also high in this alpine habitat; in fact, the highest proportions of all are found here. The total fibre content is relatively low, and the crude protein content is average. The total fibre content is only high in winter and low the rest of the year. The fractions are dominated by cellulose and lignin. The crude protein content is highest in spring, as in Habitat GSF. The NFC content is consistently high. Shrubs also dominate the food choice in this habitat, but the selection of shrubs consumed is much more diverse than, e.g. in habitat BF or PF. In summer and autumn, fruits also play a major role. A significantly increased proportion of Marvinbryantia is probably due to a starch- or sugar-associated forage. High proportions of Eggerthellaceae (DNF00809) and Enterorhabdus could be related to presumably high proportions of plant secondary metabolites in the pronounced herbaceous layer and various woody branched plants [84]. However, exact proportions have not yet been examined but will be part of the following analyses. Significantly occurring fibre-associated genera in this habitat are unclassified Clostridia, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, and Prevotellaceae (UCG 003).\n\nIn order to understand the needs or adaptive mechanisms of roe deer, this should be considered in the context of their surrounding habitat. The roe deer is highly and rapidly adaptable to the changing forage availability, contributing to these animals’ distribution success. However, they are also very well adapted to their habitat to make the best possible use of the given forage, even in months of privation. As we could already show in our preliminary study based on the energy density in the habitats, roe deer cope well with the given forage offer and adapt to less energy-rich food, e.g. by an increased rumen filling [4]. The energy densities from all the habitats studied are still being evaluated. Still, the animals’ weights already indicated no malnutrition or insufficient supply in any of the habitats. And results of the actual study show that the energy densities and the animals’ weights indicated no malnutrition or insufficient supply in any of the habitats [85]. For example, if we consider additional feeding in winter, habitat-specific adaptations should definitely be considered.\n\nThe dynamic changes in the microbiome structure support the colonisation of new habitats. Adaptation to a particular forage per se is, of course, also determined by their anatomy and by the environment in which they live, but we can see that the roe deer is a tolerant animal with strong dietary deviations involving plant species high in nutrients. The limits of this research were that due to the new nature of the study, several bacterial species have not yet been cultured; therefore, there were a considerable number of unclassified/unknown taxa among the sequencing data. However, this study opens the possibility of understanding the interplay between microbiome, crude nutrients, and VFAs. A future perspective will be to culture anaerobic species from the rumen of wild animals to better classify them."
