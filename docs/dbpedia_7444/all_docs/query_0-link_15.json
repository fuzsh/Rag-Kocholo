        "text": "Babe is a charming and ingenious hit about Babe, a dedicated farm pig who aspires to become a “sheep-pig.” By talking kindly and respectfully to the sheep, Babe succeeds where the disdainful sheepdogs fail. Babe’s talents attract the notice of Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell), who enters Babe in the climactic sheepdog competition. Seamless, subtle (and Oscar-winning) visual effects, along with terrific performances by a wide variety of farm animals (ducks, mice, horses, cows, cats), make this one of the very few outstanding movies for children (and adults can just as readily enjoy it).\n\n1995 had a notoriously weak roster of Best Picture nominees (many films that deserved a nod in the category, like Seven and The Usual Suspects, didn’t get one). So it came down to Apollo 13, Braveheart, Il Postino, Sense and Sensibility … and Babe. Though Emma Thompson and Ang Lee’s adaptation of Jane Austen would run a close second, I’d rank the pig well above the remaining nominees — and certainly above Mel Gibson’s overlong barbaric yawp.\n\nExplore posts in the same categories: tspdt"
