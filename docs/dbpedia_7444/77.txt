Books into Film

The Sheep-Pig by Dick King-Smith

The Sheep-Pig is an enchanting children’s story about a polite little pig that learns to look after sheep in a most unconventional way. Published in 1983, it immediately became a best-selling book that was released as the highly successful film ‘Babe’, in 1996.

The story is a charming farmyard adventure. When Farmer Hogget wins a piglet at the local fair, Mrs. Hogget thinks of fattening it up for the freezer. But the old sheepdog, Fly, has other ideas. She befriends Babe and trains him up as a sheep-pig. Babe’s methods of herding the sheep are unusual; instead of chasing them he makes polite requests, and the sheep are so pleased to be asked, that they obey him! Babe has many adventures, proves himself a hero, protecting Farmer Hogget’s sheep from thieves, and wins the heart of Mrs Hogget, who gives up all plans of eating him.
