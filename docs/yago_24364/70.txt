EW.com has learned that Ken Olin will join his wife Patricia Wettig on screen for a three-episode arc of Brothers & Sisters. Olin, who also executive produces the ABC drama, will play a former lover of Holli Harper (Wettig) who comes back into her life and exposes some personal secrets. The couple’s son, Cliff Olin — who’s a writer on the series — may pen one of the episodes. Filming begins later this month. Olin and Wettig, who have been married since 1982, starred together on ABC’s thirtysomething.
