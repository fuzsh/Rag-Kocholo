        "text": "thirtysomething, American television drama about the lives of young urban professionals that was broadcast on the American Broadcasting Co. (ABC) network for four seasons (1987–91). Initially panned by some critics as self-indulgent, the show built up a loyal following among its baby boomer audience and came to be revered by many critics for its innovative style and realistic stories.\n\nCreated by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz and based loosely on their personal experiences, thirtysomething was set in Philadelphia and revolved around the often angst-ridden personal and professional lives of a group of yuppies in their 30s (hence the name, which reflected the show’s 1960s counterculture sensibility in its unusual one-word lowercase form). At the centre of this group of friends is Michael Steadman (played by Ken Olin), an advertising copywriter, and his wife, Hope (Mel Harris), a stay-at-home mother and part-time social worker, whose feminist views cause her to struggle with her status as a homemaker. The ensemble cast of characters also included Elliot Weston (Timothy Busfield), Michael’s best friend from his college days and occasional business partner, whose not-yet-grown-up behaviour is contrasted with the “adult” life of the Steadmans; Elliot’s wife, Nancy (Patricia Wettig), who also struggles with being a homemaker (before becoming a successful children’s book illustrator); Michael’s cousin Melissa (Melanie Mayron), a freelance photographer; Ellyn Warren (Polly Draper), Hope’s childhood friend; Gary Shepherd (Peter Horton), Michael’s college roommate, who teaches English literature at a liberal-arts college; and Gary’s wife, Susannah Hart (Patricia Kalember), whom he marries after having a child with her.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nThe domestic trials and tribulations of marriage and raising children, the romantic perils of being single, and the various professional indignities suffered by the characters supplied most of the story lines and bestowed the series with its dramatic power and emotional impact. The verisimilitude of its stories, as well as its deft understanding of the zeitgeist and the obsession of 30ish baby boomers with their transition from childhood to maturity, made the show a hit with its yuppie fans and with many critics.\n\nThe show was nominated for more than 40 Emmy Awards and won 13 of them, as well as two Golden Globes and numerous other awards. Soon after the show went on the air, “thirtysomething” entered the lexicon (and, in 1993, the Oxford English Dictionary) as a catch-phrase for people in their 30s, specifically in reference to those of the baby boomer generation who reached that age in the late 1980s, when thirtysomething was on the air."
