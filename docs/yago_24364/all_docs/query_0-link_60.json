        "text": "Encountering “Thirtysomething” again more than two decades after it made its debut on ABC is a little like discovering a late-1980s time capsule. The show, which will be available for the first time on home video on Aug. 25, perfectly captured the intimate details of the baby boomer lifestyle in ways no network series had previously, and sparked intense debate about its merits.\n\nNow fiftysomething and still married in real life, Ken Olin (Michael Steadman) and Patricia Wettig (Nancy Krieger Weston) sat down with co-star Timothy Busfield (Elliot Weston) in April at a hotel in Santa Monica, Calif., to record commentaries for the DVD and to speak with The New York Times about their time on the show. Mel Harris (Hope Murdoch Steadman) and Peter Horton (Gary Shepherd) and the series’ creators, Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, spoke later by phone about the show’s place in TV history and the origin of its lexicon-altering title. What follows is an edited and condensed version of those interviews.\n\nSomething Completely Different\n\nTimothy Busfield: The biggest conflict in the pilot was buying the stroller.\n\nKen Olin: You had your leading man break down and cry. That was different for a grown man.\n\nPatricia Wettig: To be vulnerable!\n\nEd Zwick: We didn’t know what we didn’t know and that ignorance gave us a kind of license. We were just uninhibited and unencumbered and able to be free and personal. It was a remarkable gift and something that has only grown greater in retrospect when you look at how corporate, policed, scrutinized the process has become in television.\n\nMarshall Herskovitz: We were ferocious in a way that you can’t be ferocious today in television without being fired. We got into screaming fights with executives over the phone, got into fights that ended up in the press, we would do battle with the authorities, we had such issues with authority anyway and I think the way the game is structured today you can’t get away with that, you’ll be kicked out, especially if you’re a beginner.\n\n“Thirtysomething,” by Any Other Name\n\nMr. Herskovitz: It wasn’t a term. People said things like that, but it wasn’t in general use. This was literally the whole conversation: We were writing the pilot, I turned to Ed and I said, ‘What should we call this?’ and I think it took maybe one second, not two, and Ed said, ‘Thirtysomething.’ I said, ‘Oh, O.K.’ And that was the whole conversation.\n\nMr. Zwick: The network said, ‘What does that mean? You can’t call it that! We insist that you change it!’ And Marshall likes to quote ‘Catch-22’ when he says, ‘What kind of a name is Yossarian?’ And he says, ‘It’s Yossarian’s name, sir.’ That was its name!\n\nThe Laboratory\n\nMr. Olin: I think there was an unspoken commitment to striving to do great stuff that was meaningful to us.\n\nMs. Wettig: I don’t think anybody thought that all the episodes were great. When you’re willing to experiment and try things, you’ll have some loser episodes and nobody seemed to care. What we were aiming for and those that did get there were worth something.\n\nMr. Busfield: Really, Marshall and Ed did not exclude us. You could walk upstairs between scenes and look at a cut of an episode. They wanted us to be a collaborative. We’d go in their office and we’d sit on the floor right away. They’d be sitting on the floor, just very relaxed. [As if to say] ‘let’s negate any sense of our power.’\n\nMr. Herskovitz: We were the bosses because we had to be, because we created the show. We were never comfortable with the mantle of authority though we knew we had the authority.\n\nMr. Zwick: I felt I was a privileged editor working with a gifted staff at a fiction magazine.\n\nA True Ensemble\n\nMel Harris: We were all green. No one was quote-unquote a star or anything like that.\n\nPeter Horton: Part of what helped I think was the real star of ‘Thirtysomething’ was the writing. I think we all kind of intuitively got that. It wasn’t the ego that often follows casts around. We all felt like we were part of this great show.\n\nMr. Busfield: I always saw ‘Friends’ as sort of the comedy version of our show. I think it’s a great ensemble, exploring those issues of jealousy, possession, sort of the comedy half-hour answer to our show.\n\nNo Divas Allowed\n\nMr. Busfield: Kenny had come off ‘Hill St. [Blues]’ and I’d come off ‘Trapper John, [M.D.],’ where there were actors who wouldn’t talk to each other. We really made a team sport of it, which was also not done a lot at that time. You had your leads, your supporting actors, we did interviews as a group: ‘Donahue,’ Rolling Stone, Playboy. You’d see shows change. We couldn’t afford to go through star changes and sustain this.\n\nIt very much could have gone the other way, but it wasn’t in our natures as people. If people wanted to break out with diva attitudes it wasn’t possible with Marshall and Ed and Ken and me. I remember walking through the set one day and an argument [was happening] between two members of the crew on the stage. Kenny stopped and said, ‘Hey we don’t do that here, we don’t go to that level. Knock it off.’ As sort of the leader of all of us that was the environment he created, and you can see it in the success of the work he’s created on ‘Brothers and Sisters’ and ‘Alias,’ shows where he’s been able to create really healthy environments.\n\nThe Influence of “Thirtysomething”\n\nMr. Herskovitz: I will say that when we did ‘Thirtysomething’ there was precious little intimate, serious drama on television and today there’s precious little intimate, serious drama on television. So I don’t think we had much influence there.\n\nMs. Wettig: The network and studio weigh in so much more now.\n\nMr. Busfield: With the act-outs every 5, 6 minutes and the network insisting on them being you know some sort of cliffhanger  which doesn’t work  I’m battling the networks constantly on that. Not many shows have been able to do it since.\n\nMr. Horton: It’s almost like that influence is gone now. There was a period of time when there was real an awful lot of attempts to bring that kind of intimacy and a depth of writing that was surrounding that, interesting shows like ‘I’ll Fly Away.’ In this day and age, shows born of a need to stand out, networks trying desperately to hold on to what they ve got, cable networks desperately trying to stand out. Broadcast networks are driven by, How can we make people feel good? And cable: How can we be shocking? Within that spectrum isn’t the room for real human reflection, and I think we’re all at a loss for it.\n\nMr. Herskovitz: In the past, things were always acted out, people were the very primary colors of behavior. It was all writ large. We rebelled against that, we tried to write small, tried to find what’s epic in the small. But now there seems to have been a swing back to that kind of acting out, that kind of oversized behavior.\n\nLike Real Life, Except When It Wasn’t\n\nMs. Harris: Ed and Marshall were married to blond shiksas, but I was glad that they went with a brunette. They took that creative freedom of choice.\n\nMr. Herskovitz: The show very quickly borrowed from our lives. When Michael’s father died, that was autobiographical, very close to my experience when my father died. But mostly we borrowed things that happened in someone’s life and used it in an entirely different context.\n\nMr. Zwick: I’ll contradict you utterly in some sense, Marshall: Everything was personal, and everything was true. In other words, the more important chords of the show had to do with those feelings and inner dynamics. And the details of plot, of how you got there, were less important.”\n\nMr. Herskovitz: That’s not contradicting me, that’s just saying it better, goddammit![Mr. Zwick laughs.]\n\nGary’s Long-Planned (But Secret) Departure\n\nMr. Horton: I had stopped acting. I was just going to be a director. Ed took me aside and said, ‘This thing will never get picked up, and if it does, for some reason, it’ll only last for 10 episodes and you can direct one of the first 10. And if it does last, we’ll kill you off after four years.’ So that was the way that happened. The network had no idea. That was just between me and Ed and Marshall. When they came to me at the beginning of the fourth year with it, it was like, ‘Wow are we really sure we want to do this?’ I was really really mixed at that point. I’d had such a great experience. We really wanted this to be a secret, so they told me this is what we’re gonna do, but you can’t tell anyone. Here I was having to keep my mouth shut, but, of course, at some point I had to tell Kenny, who was the worst person I could tell because soon enough Ed and Marshall called me down to their office and said, ‘You had to tell!’ Ken is such a gossip! He’s such a woman that way! But he was my pal. I couldn’t keep it in. The idea was to tell people as they needed to know. They even put out a dummy script. The press was aware someone was going to die that year, but they thought it was Patti.’\n\nThe Future: “Fiftysomething”?\n\nMr. Zwick: We’ve seen some of the cast recently, they look surprisingly good. Then again, HD brings with it a particular horror.\n\nMr. Herskovitz: I don’t think we’re gonna do ‘Fiftysomething’ [laughing]."
