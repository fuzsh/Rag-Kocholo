She is perhaps best known for her role as Nancy Krieger Weston in the ABC television drama thirtysomething (1987–91) for which she received three Primetime Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award.\n\nContents\n\nGolden globes 1991 sharon gless and patricia wettig both win the award for best actress\n\nPatricia wettig actor\n\nEarly life\n\nCareer\n\nPersonal life\n\nFilmography\n\nReferences\n\nOther notable works include the portrayal of Vice President Caroline Reynolds in the Fox serial drama Prison Break (2005–07), and playing Holly Harper in the ABC television drama Brothers & Sisters (2006–11). She is also known for her roles in the comedy films City Slickers (1991), City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold (1994), and the science fiction miniseries The Langoliers (1995).\n\nPatricia wettig actor\n\nEarly life\n\nWettig was born in Milford, Ohio, to Florence (née Morlock) and Clifford Neal Wettig, a high school basketball coach. She has three sisters: Pam, Phyllis, and Peggy. She was raised in Grove City, Pennsylvania and graduated from Grove City High School in 1970. She attended Ohio Wesleyan University and graduated from Temple University in 1975. She returned to her studies later in life and received a Master of Fine Arts in playwriting from Smith College in 2001. F2M, a play she authored, was performed in 2011 as part of the New York Stage and Film and Vassar College's 2011 Powerhouse Theater season.\n\nCareer\n\nAlthough Wettig has acted in a number of films (including City Slickers, Guilty by Suspicion, and The Langoliers), she is best known for her work on television. She received critical acclaim (and a number of awards) for her role as Nancy Weston on ABC's thirtysomething. Her portrayal of Nancy's cancer struggle attracted considerable acclaim and attention. She also portrayed Joanne McFadden on the television program St. Elsewhere. In addition, Wettig appeared in a number of popular television programs during the 1980s and 1990s including L.A. Law, Frasier, Hill Street Blues, and Remington Steele.\n\nWettig starred in the ABC comedy-drama series Brothers & Sisters, which debuted in September 2006, where she portrays the Walker family patriarch's mistress, Holly Harper. Her character was the co-CEO at Ojai Foods with Sarah Walker, the daughter of William Walker. She left the show mid-season during Season 5 after her character Holly Harper followed her daughter to New York along with her fiance David played by real life husband Ken Olin. This season sees the whole Harper family absent from the show. Wettig also had the recurring role of CIA psychotherapist Dr. Judy Barnett on Alias (husband Olin was a producer and director on the series). Before joining Brothers & Sisters, she played the fictional Vice President Caroline Reynolds on the 2005 Fox television drama, Prison Break. She turned down Fox's offer of becoming a series regular on Prison Break in order to pursue Brothers & Sisters. In 2007 ABC and FOX agreed that Wettig could briefly reprise her role as Caroline Reynolds, providing off-camera voice-overs and appearing in a scene with Wentworth Miller.\n\nIn 2012, Wettig joined the national tour for Larry Kramer's production, The Normal Heart.\n\nPersonal life\n\nWettig is married to actor and producer Ken Olin; they have two children, Clifford Olin (b. 1983) and Roxanne \"Roxy\" Olin (b. 1985). Roxy Olin was a principal cast member of the MTV series The City, and also had a regular role on the ABC drama Brothers & Sisters.\n\nFilmography\n\nActress\n\n2021\n\nThe Timekeepers of Eternity as\n\nLaurel\n\n2019\n\nDolly Parton's Heartstrings (TV Series) as\n\nHarper Cantrell\n\n- Sugar Hill (2019) - Harper Cantrell\n\n2015\n\nMajor Crimes (TV Series) as\n\nJudge Virginia Ryan\n\n- Fifth Dynasty (2015) - Judge Virginia Ryan\n\n2014\n\nIdentity (TV Movie) as\n\nLiana Grant\n\n2006\n\nBrothers & Sisters (TV Series) as\n\nHolly Harper\n\n- Walker Down the Aisle (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- For Better or for Worse (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Father Unknown (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Wouldn't It Be Nice (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Never Say Never (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Olivia's Choice (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Home is Where the Fort Is (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Brody (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- The One That Got Away (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Safe at Home (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Thanks for the Memories (2011) - Holly Harper\n\n- Scandalized (2011) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Cold Turkey (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Get a Room (2010) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- The Rhapsody of the Flesh (2010) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Resolved (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- An Ideal Husband (2010) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Call Mom (2010) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- A Righteous Kiss (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Faking It (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Brief Encounter (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- The Homecoming (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- On the Road Again (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Lights Out (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Love All (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Where There's Smoke- (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- If You Bake It, He Will Come (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Time After Time: Part 2 (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Time After Time: Part 1 (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Freeluc.com (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Leap of Faith (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- A Valued Family (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- The Pasadena Primary (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Run Baby Run (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- The Science Fair (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- A Bone to Pick (2010) - Holly Harper\n\n- Nearlyweds (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Pregnant Pause (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- The Wine Festival (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- The Wig Party (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Zen & the Art of Mole Making (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Last Tango in Pasadena (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- From France with Love (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Almost Normal (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Breaking the News (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- The Road Ahead (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Mexico (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Let's Call the Whole Thing Off (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Julia (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- S3X (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Missing (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Spring Broken (2009) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Taking Sides (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Troubled Waters: Part 2 (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Troubled Waters: Part 1 (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Lost and Found (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Owning It (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- It's Not Easy Being Green (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- Sibling Rivalry (2009) - Holly Harper\n\n- A Father Dreams (2009) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- Just a Sliver (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Unfinished Business (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Going Once- Going Twice (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Do You Believe in Magic (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Bakersfield (2008) - Holly Harper (credit only)\n\n- You Get What You Need (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Everything Must Go (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Tug of War (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Book Burning (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Glass Houses (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Prior Commitments (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Moral Hazard (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Double Negative (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Separation Anxiety (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Compromises (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- The Missionary Imposition (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- The Feast of Epiphany (2008) - Holly Harper\n\n- Holy Matrimony!
