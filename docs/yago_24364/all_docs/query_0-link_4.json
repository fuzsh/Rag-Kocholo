        "text": "Ken Olin and Patricia Wettig are breaking up with their Scandinavian-inspired modern home in Venice, CA, having just listed it for $4,995,000.\n\nThe married couple, who starred in the ’80s TV drama series “Thirtysomething,” purchased the two-story, 3,820-square-foot abode in 2019 for $4.5 million. It was custom designed by Amber Interiors and Hawaii-based architect Peter Vincent in 2017.\n\nThe sophisticated four-bedroom, 3.5-bath home features a stark two-tone exterior and an interior with polished concrete flooring, tongue-and-groove paneling, floor-to-ceiling pocket doors, and built-in shelving.\n\nThe floating steel, wood, and glass staircase looks a bit like an art installation.\n\nThe kitchen is illuminated by large pendant lights and features steel-and-glass cabinetry and open shelving. The Lacanche range features both electric and gas ovens, and a spacious island with bar seating allows for entertaining or casual family meals. The large pantry is equipped with a wine fridge and additional storage.\n\nThe primary suite has a vaulted ceiling, built-in shelving, a walk-in closet, and a luxe bath.\n\nThe guesthouse includes a living room, a full bath, and a Murphy bed. When that’s folded up into the wall, the room can be used as an office or gym.\n\nThere’s a surprising amount of mature foliage on the 7,296-square-foot lot, providing plenty of shade for the plunge pool, tree house play area, and outdoor kitchen. A lounge area with a fire pit and dining space complete the backyard.\n\nWhile Wettig, 72, and Olin, 70, starred of the baby boomer hit “Thirtysomething,” it hardly defines them. Olin moved behind the camera, working as a director and producer on shows such as “Brothers & Sisters,” “Alias,” and “This Is Us.”\n\nWettig starred in other hit TV shows, including “St. Elsewhere,” “L.A. Doctors,” “Alias,” “Prison Break,” and “Brothers & Sisters.” She also appeared in several movies, most notable among them the two “City Slickers” films."
