        "text": "Twenty years before Brothers & Sisters became this season's must-see family drama for America, another ensemble show captured hearts and headlines. Thirtysomething, which began in 1987, was the addictive, soapy tale of a group of friends heading towards middle age while clinging to what remained of youth. It was both infuriating and influential, attracting as much criticism as praise for its neurotic yuppie characters and shameless sentimentality. Yet it went on to form a blueprint for shows as diverse as Cold Feet, Six Feet Under, Grey's Anatomy and now Brothers & Sisters.\n\nIf there's one man who understands why thirtysomething captured the feelings of the late-Eighties generation, it is Ken Olin. He played ad executive Michael, thirtysomething's occasionally sanctimonious main character and resident sex symbol. He is now an executive producer and director of Brothers & Sisters. 'There are a lot of similarities between the two shows,' he admits. 'If you look at most of the other successful shows - Ugly Betty, Desperate Housewives, even CSI - they're very escapist, they aren't based in reality, and we felt it was time to go back to that.'\n\nEpisodes tackle everything from the impact of the Iraq war on an ordinary family to drug addiction, infidelity and the pressures of a family-run business. Olin says he is relieved that he's no longer in front of the camera and thus in the front line. 'I was awful at all that sort of thing,' he admits. 'I mean its flattering to hear that people thought of you in that way [as a sex symbol] but I was never very comfortable with it. I was married by the time thirtysomething came out [to Patricia Wettig who plays Holly Harper in Brothers & Sisters and was the cancer-stricken Nancy in thirtysomething] and it was all a bit overwhelming. It wasn't just the pressures away from acting either - I always felt really self-conscious in front of the camera. I kept thinking I should be better than I was.\n\nHe is much happier working on Brothers & Sisters. 'It's just a great show to work on,' he says. 'And it does come across that they all get on really well - the boys [Balthazar Getty, Matthew Rhys and David Annable who play the three brothers in the series] all hang out together away from filming and Sally [Field, the family matriarch] does keep everything in order. There is a real family vibe and I think that comes through.'\n\nThirtysomethings: where are they now?\n\nPolly Draper (Ellyn Warren)\n\nWrote and produced The Tic Code (1999), a film about Tourette's Syndrome, from which her husband suffers.\n\nMelanie Mayron (Melissa Steadman)\n\nDirected The Baby-Sitters Club in 1995 as well as episodes of Dawson's Creek and Ed.\n\nMel Harris (Hope Murdoch Steadman)\n\nHas featured in The West Wing, Dawson's Creek and House and had a recurring role in Stargate SG-1.\n\nPatricia Wettig (Nancy Krieger Weston)\n\nStarred in City Slickers and a number of TV shows including Alias and Prison Break. Now plays Holly Harper in Brothers & Sisters.\n\nTimothy Busfield (Elliot Weston)\n\nSet up two prestigious children's theatre companies. Played a White House correspondent in The West Wing. Now stars in Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\n\nPeter Horton (Gary Shepard)\n\nAs well as directing episodes of The Wonder Years and Grey's Anatomy, Horton starred in Two Days in the Valley and The Geena Davis Show."
