When Ken [Olin] and I met, we did a play together and then we did *thirtysomething* for four years. I think we've worked together so much that is seems normal -- you go to work and there's your husband. My son Cliff is writing and my daughter is an actress who's re-occurred on the show, and everyone thinks, 'Isn't that odd? Having your family around?' I think, no, it seems perfectly natural!\" Patricia recently reunited with her *thirtysomething* co-stars for a special project sponsored by Tylenol. \"They had done this national survey of young boomers asking them what it's like to be 50,\" Patricia explains. \"And most of them said, 'Well, 50 is the new 40.' This program encourages people not to stop -- to keep moving, to exercise and to eat well. Don't let age stop you.\" Check out [Justkeepmoving.com](https://www.justkeepmoving.com) for more information and to get your Keep Moving kit."
