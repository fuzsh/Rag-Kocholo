        "text": "It's Ken Olin and Patricia Wettig's 36th wedding anniversary today- so we celebrate by sharing some things you might not know about the couple.\n\nPatricia Wettig and Ken Olin (Credit: Famous)\n\n1. Actor Wettig married producer Olin on the 8 th May 1982.\n\n2. The couple have two children together: Roxanne Elizabeth Olin born in 1985 and Clifford Olin, born in 1983.\n\n3. Roxanne appeared in the MTV series The City and also had a regular role on the ABC drama Brothers and Sisters alongside her mother and father.\n\n4. Wettig played the character of Holly Harper and Olin played Dave Caplan- he also was the executive producer on 106 episodes of the show.\n\n5. Wettig and Olin were no strangers to working together before Brothers and Sisters as they were first caught on screen together in Thirtysomething in 1987, however they had different spouses on the show. Actress Mel Harris played his wife on the programme and apparently the public was often confused as to who Ken's wife really was while it aired.\n\nHappy Wedding Anniversary Patricia and Ken!\n\nSource: Wikipedia and IMDB."
