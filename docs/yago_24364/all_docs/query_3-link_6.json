        "text": "Kenneth Edward \"Ken\" Olin is an American actor, producer, and director best known for his roles in thirtysomething and Brothers & Sisters.\n\nBiography[]\n\nOlin was born on July 30, 1954, to a former Peace Corps official and a pharmaceutical company owner. He is of Jewish descent. He was born in Chicago, Illinois, but raised in Highland Park. He graduated from The Putney School in Putney, Vermont, in 1972, and then attended Pennsylvania State University, attaining a degree in English Literature. Olin then completed the rest of his college education at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nBecoming an actor, Olin portrayed his noted roles of Michael Steadman on thirtysomething and Dr. Roger Cattan on L.A. Doctors. He also starred as Detective Harry Garibaldi on Hill Street Blues and as the lead character in the short-lived but critically-praised EZ Streets. Olin has also starred in a number of TV programs, including Alias (also producing and directing it), Falcon Crest, and Murder, She Wrote. In 1995, Olin starred as Bradly Morris Cunningham in the made-for-TV film Dead by Sunset, which aired on the Lifetime network. The film was based on the bestselling nonfiction crime novel of the same name, which was written by crime author Ann Rule. In addition to his acting roles, he served as director for several TV series, including L.A. Doctors, The West Wing, Felicity, Judging Amy, Freaks and Geeks, thirtysomething, and EZ Streets.\n\nIn his personal life, Olin is married to his thirtysomething and Brothers & Sisters costar, Patricia Wettig, with whom he has a son, Clifford, and a daughter, Roxanne, the latter of whom appeared in The City.\n\nOn Criminal Minds[]\n\nOlin portrayed writer and murder suspect Bruce Morrison, who appeared in the Season Eight episode \"All That Remains\".\n\nFilmography[]\n\nCriminal Minds - \"All That Remains\" (2013) TV episode - Bruce Morrison\n\nAmericana (2012) as Martin Garano\n\nBrothers & Sisters (2007-2011) as David Caplan (30 episodes)\n\nBreaking News (2002) as Richard Sloan\n\nAlias (2001-2002) as David McNeil (3 episodes, uncredited)\n\nY2K (1999) as Nick Cromwell\n\nEvolution's Child (1999) as James Mydell\n\nL.A.
