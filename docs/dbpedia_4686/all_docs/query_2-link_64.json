The following glossary is a guide to all things flexible packaging.\n\nFlexible Packaging Definitions\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nD\n\nE\n\nF\n\nG\n\nH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nK\n\nL\n\nM\n\nN\n\nO\n\nP\n\nQ\n\nR\n\nS\n\nT\n\nU\n\nV\n\nW\n\nX\n\nY\n\nZ\n\nTOP\n\nFlexible Packaging Definitions\n\nTOP\n\naclar\n\nTrade name for a polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) polymer. The polymer has outstanding moisture and excellent oxygen barrier properties, as well as being clear, rigid, and relatively easy to thermoform. Its main packaging application is for pharmaceutical blister packages.\n\nTOP\n\nacrylonitrile\n\nA monomer with the structure (CH = CHCN). Its copolymers have good gas barrier and chemical resistance properties.\n\nTOP\n\nair gap\n\nThe distance from the die lips of a polymer-melt extruder and the chill roll.\n\nTOP\n\nanilox roll\n\nEngraved ink metering roll used in flexo presses to provide a controlled film of ink to the printing plates which print onto the substrate.\n\nTOP\n\naluminum foil\n\nA thin gauge (.285-1.0 mil) aluminum foil laminated to plastic films to provide oxygen, aroma and water vapor barrier properties.\n\nTOP\n\nbaggy, bagginess\n\n(a) In processing flexible packaging materials, slack areas in the web that should be flat. Usually caused by bands of unequal thickness (gauge bands) in the rollstock. (b) A roll in which the tension is not even across the width of the roll. A slack floppy area in the web is caused by the material being stretched and permanently elongated in the tighter areas. Rolls of film or laminate where one side of the material coming off the roll is loose or baggy while the opposite edge is tight is said to have a baggy edge.\n\nTOP\n\nBarex\n\nA trade name for acrylonitrile plastic.\n\nTOP\n\nbarrier\n\nIn packaging, this term is most commonly used to describe the ability of a material to stop or retard the passage of atmospheric gases, water vapor, and volatile flavor and aroma ingredients. A barrier material is one that is designed to prevent, to a specified degree, the penetrations of water, oils, water vapor, or certain gases, as desired. Barrier materials may serve to exclude or retain such elements without or within a package.\n\nTOP\n\nbase film\n\nThe original form in which a film exists before coating or laminating.\n\nTOP\n\nbiaxial orientation\n\nOrientation of plastic films in both machine and cross machine (transverse) directions by stretching. Biaxial stretched films are generally well balanced in both directions and much stronger in terms of tear strength.\n\nTOP\n\nbleed\n\nImage or color that extends beyond the trim edge of the finished printed piece.\n\nTOP\n\nblister packaging\n\nA package type where the item is secured between a pre-formed dome or “bubble” and a paperboard/flexible surface.\n\nTOP\n\nburst strength\n\nA measure of the ability of a sheet to resist rupture when pressure is applied to one of its sides by a specified instrument under specified conditions.\n\nTOP\n\nbutt\n\n(a) To join with overlap or space between. (b) Butt register is where two or more colors meet with no significant overlap or space between.\n\nTOP\n\ncast film\n\nPlastic film produced from synthetic resins (such as polyethylene) by the cast process. In this process, the molten resin is extruded through a slot die onto an internally cooled chill roll.\n\nTOP\n\nchemical resistance\n\nAbility of a material to retain utility and appearance following contact with chemical agents. Chemical resistance implies that there is no significant chemical activity between the contacting materials.\n\nTOP\n\nchemical compatibility testing\n\nAny procedure that exposes a material to chemicals or mixtures of chemicals to determine whether such exposure has a negative effect on the material being evaluated.\n\nTOP\n\nco-extrusion (COEX)\n\nSimultaneous extrusion of two or more different thermoplastic resins into a sandwich-like film with clearly distinguishable individual layers.\n\nTOP\n\nCOF (coefficient of friction)\n\nCoefficient of friction, a measurement of “slipperiness” of plastic films and laminates. Measurements are usually done film surface to film surface. Measurements can be done to other surfaces as well, but not recommended, because COF values can be distorted by variations in surface finishes and contamination on test surface.\n\nTOP\n\nCAN\n\nCast nylon film. Used mostly for thermoformable packaging applications.\n\nTOP\n\ncoating\n\nAny fluid material applied as a thick layer to a substrate material or object.\n\nTOP\n\ncolor management\n\nThe process of translating specific color information from the computer screen image, through prepress, plate-making, printing presses and finally to a substrate in such a manner that color accuracy is maintained at acceptable levels throughout.\n\nTOP\n\ncolor value\n\nThe lightness or darkness of a color. A color may be classified as equivalent to some member of a series of shades ranging from black to white. The other two fundamental characterizers of color are hue and saturation.\n\ncompatibility\n\nThe ability of a container or material to resist chemical degradation or physical change caused by the product, or where a container or material does not chemically degrade or physically change the contained product.\n\nTOP\n\nconformability\n\nThe ability of a material to be bent or shaped around a form without being damaged or marred in any way.\n\nTOP\n\ncorona treatment\n\nA treatment to alter the surface of plastics and other materials to make them more receptive to printing inks.\n\nTOP\n\ncross-linking\n\nA film conversion technique in which polymer chains are bound into a web or network to increase the web’s heat stability and strength.\n\nTOP\n\nco-monomer\n\nA monomer that is mixed with one or more other monomers for a polymerization reaction, to make a copolymer.\n\nTOP\n\ncurl\n\nThe tendency of a paper sheet to curl as humidity conditions change due to the hygroexpansive nature of paper. A paper sheet that is identical in construction on each side will expand and contract as humidity changes with little tendency to curl. However if the sheet is printed, varnished, or laminated to a plastic film or a foil, then the two sides will have different expansion and contraction rates and the paper will curl as the humidity changes from the conditions when the printing, varnishing or laminating were done. The greater the humidity difference, the greater the curl.\n\nTOP\n\ncurtain coating\n\nA method of applying wax or other coating to a material where the material is passed through a free-falling curtain or film of the fluid coating.\n\nTOP\n\ncut edge\n\nThe uncovered edge of a laminated product. For example a high-barrier paper/foil laminate made into a hermetically-sealed carton using lap seals would have an exposed cut edge of paperboard through which oxygen could still permeate into the product. Such edges are often skived and folded back on themselves to seal the cut edge.\n\nTOP\n\ncutoff\n\nln web-fed processing, the cut or print length corresponding to the circumference of the plate cylinder.\n\nTOP\n\ndeck\n\nA term used mostly in flexographic printing to describe a single print station with plate, impression cylinders, and inking rolls.\n\nTOP\n\ndegradation\n\nA change or break-down in a material’s chemical structure.\n\nTOP\n\ndelamination\n\nSeparation or splitting of laminate layers caused by lack of or inadequate adhesion, or by mechanical disruption such as peeling or shearing forces.\n\nTOP\n\ndirectionality\n\nThe tendency for certain materials to have properties imparted by the flow direction through a machine.\n\nTOP\n\ndot gain\n\nA physical and/or optical measurement and theoretical calculation of the apparent increase in dot area from one medium to another. Normally expressed as the difference between a midtone (nominal 50%) dot area on a film negative and the printed dot area; for example, a 50% film dot area which prints as a 78% dot has 28% dot gain. Dot gain (and loss) are normal and must be controlled throughout the press and printing process.\n\nTOP\n\ndraw\n\nln flexible packaging laminates, the distance that a web travels between supporting rolls.\n\nTOP\n\ndrawdown\n\nA swatch of color or coating made by spreading a small amount of ink or varnish across a sheet of material.

EAA’s adhesive and toughness qualities are taken advantage of in high performance multi-layer laminates.\n\nTOP\n\nethylene-ethyl acrylate (EEA)\n\nThe copolymerization of ethylene with ethyl acrylate produces an ethylene acid copolymer. The polymers are produced with varying percentages of acrylate content, most typically between 15 and 30%. EEA is compatible with all olefin polymers and often is blended with these to modify properties. EEA is used in hot-melt formulations. lt also can be used alone or as a component of heat-sealable coatings where it offers improved toughness at low temperatures, excellent adhesion to nonpolar substrates, and a broad service temperature range. EEA is used as a tie layer between mating laminate films.\n\nTOP\n\nethylene-methyl acrylate (EMAC)\n\nThe copolymerization of ethylene with methyl acrylate produces an ethylene copolymer, one of the most thermally stable of the olefin copolymers. The polymers are produced with varying percentages of methyl acrylate content, most typically between 1 8 and 24o/o of the structure. Alone or in blends, it has found applications in film, extrusion coating, sheet, laminating, and co-extrusion.\n\nTOP\n\nethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA)\n\nA polar copolymer of ethylene and vinyl acetate, retaining some of the properties of polyethylene but with increased flexibility, elongation, and impact resistance. EVA is frequently specified as the extrusion coating on polypropylene, aluminum foil and poly(ethylene terephthalate), to provide good heat-seals at high converting rates, or as the adhesion layer in some laminates.\n\nTOP\n\nethylene-vinyl alcohol (EVOH)\n\nCan be regarded as a copolymer of polyethylene in which varying amounts of the -OH functional group have been incorporated. A typical packaging EVOH is about 20 to 35% ethylene. EVOH is one of the best polymeric oxygen barriers available to packagers. However, its susceptibility to water requires that for most applications it be laminated or co-extruded into a protective sandwich with materials that will keep the EVOH layer away from water.\n\nTOP\n\nextrusion\n\nThe process of forming a thermoplastic film, container, or profile by forcing the polymer melt through a shaped orifice.\n\nTOP\n\nextrusion coating\n\nA process where a film of molten polymeric material is extruded onto the surface of a substrate material and cooled to form a continuous coating.\n\nTOP\n\nextrusion lamination\n\nA laminating process in which individual layers of multi-layer packaging materials are laminated to each other by extruding a thin layer of molten synthetic resin (such as polyethylene) between the layers.\n\nTOP\n\neye mark register\n\nA printed rectangular mark most often found along the edge of rollstock that can be identified by an electric eye.

A term normally applied to bags, pouches, or wraps made of materials ranging in thickness from 13 to 75 micrometres (0.0b0á to 0.003 inch) such as paper, plastic film, foil, or combinations of these.\n\nTOP\n\nflexographic printing\n\nA method of printing using flexible rubber or photopolymer printing plates in which the image to be printed stands out in relief. Fluid ink metered by an engraved roll is applied to the raised portions of the printing plate and then transferred to the substrate.\n\nTOP\n\nform-fill-seal (FFS)\n\nA packaging machine that forms, fills, closes and seals a package in one continuous or intermittent-motion operation. Flexible packaging stock fed from a roll is folded to the desired package shape and stabilized by heat sealing. The product is placed into the formed package, and the remaining opening is sealed. Machines can be configured so that the stock travels horizontally through the machine (horizontal form-fill-seal) or vertically through the machine (vertical form-fill seal).\n\nTOP\n\nfour-color process\n\nPrinting with cyan, yellow, magenta, and black ink (CMYK) using halftone screens to create a full color reproduction.\n\nTOP\n\nfour-side-seal pouch\n\nA pouch with seals along all four edges.

Test conditions may vary and must always be stated.\n\nTOP\n\ngauge band\n\nA thickness irregularity found in rolls of film. A thicker area in the machine direction at some location across the width of a flat film will produce a raised ring in a finished roll. Gauge bands can cause winding problems and when unwound, the material tends not to be perfectly flat.\n\nTOP\n\ngauge\n\nThickness. In North America, film thickness, measured in mils, is usually given in gauges. A 100 gauge shrink film is one mil, or 1/1000 of an inch, thick. In Europe, the film thickness metric is the micron. A quick equivalency equation is: 1 mil = 25.4 microns.\n\nTOP\n\ngood manufacturing practice (GMP)\n\nGood manufacturing practice implies that the entire manufacturing procedure has been designed in such a way as to produce a quality product that presents a minimum risk to the consumer. GMP will vary from industry to industry depending on the nature of the product being packaged. Many GMPs have been formalized and are required by law for critical industries such as food and pharmaceutical packaging. Typically these GMPs describe the kind of equipment to be used, its validation, manufacturing procedures, inspection types and frequencies, record keeping, container types and approvals, and registration of company and product.\n\nTOP\n\ngravure printing\n\nGravure is abbreviated from the term rotogravure. During gravure printing an image is etched on the surface of a metal cylinder and chrome plated for hardness.
