        "text": "DAVID ATTENBOROUGH: Imagine creatures so beautiful that people thought they had come down directly from heaven...\n\nSo striking that the first Europeans to see them thought they could only have escaped from the Garden of Eden.\n\nIn fact, that Eden was New Guinea -- one of the last inhabited islands to be explored by Europeans.\n\nAnd it remains virtually the only place where you can see these wonderful creatures.\n\nThey were birds, but unlike birds that anyone had ever seen before.\n\nThey brought the image of beauty almost to the edge of absurdity.\n\nAnd their displays were even more extraordinary and bizarre than their appearance, some of the most complex to be found in the animal kingdom.\n\nThey may not have come from the Garden of Eden, but they certainly deserve the name that the first European scientists gave them -- the birds-of-paradise.\n\nYet much of what they do is still unknown.\n\nMore than 150 years after the first scientific observations of these creatures, in spite of innumerable expeditions and countless hours of scientific observation, we are still only catching glimpses, tantalizing glimpses, of these heavenly creatures.\n\nA new generation of scientists and film crews are attempting to put that right.\n\nBut these remarkable birds don't give up their secrets easily.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Another expedition is setting off to look for birds-of-paradise.\n\nBut this one is different.\n\nThis one is being mounted by the New Guinea people themselves.\n\nA new generation of local conservationists are concerned that paradise bird numbers may be falling.\n\n[Recorded bird calls playing] [Calling] This team is led by Miriam Supuma.\n\nWith her is bird expert Paul Igag.\n\nSUPUMA: Ah, I've got my knickers wet!\n\n[Laughs] ATTENBOROUGH: Miriam's love of nature began in a small village school in the mountains.\n\nTo follow that passion, she learned English, got herself to university, and finished her ecology field work in Australia.\n\nOver the next three months, she aims to see and document 10 birds-of-paradise species.\n\nShe has agreed to let our camera crew go with her.\n\nThey are starting with the smallest of the family -- the King Bird.\n\nMiriam searches for signs.\n\nYou have to know what to look for -- and she does.\n\nSUPUMA: You can see peck marks on this fruit here.\n\n[Bird calling] ATTENBOROUGH: That's his call.\n\nBut she just can't see him.\n\nSUPUMA: It tends to like this area.\n\nOne of the reasons is because of the light coming through.\n\nThey're show-off birds, so they like to show their plumage, and the light complements their bright plumage.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: The signs are good.\n\nThey decide to build a hide.\n\nIt must be big enough to seat her and the camera crew.\n\nBut there's a problem.\n\nA dead banana tree blocks the camera's view.\n\nMiriam has it gently pruned back.\n\n[Birds calling] She's confident the birds will return.\n\nThis is the mating season, when they become less shy.\n\nShe discovered this when she was still a student.\n\nWorking in the forest, early one morning, she spotted a bird-of-paradise high in the tree tops and below it, another, preening its plumes in the morning sun.\n\n[Calling] And then they displayed.\n\nThe sight changed her life.\n\nSUPUMA: On that day, I noticed there were about six or seven birds-of-paradise, singing and dancing, and it just continued for five or ten minutes.\n\nI stopped what I was doing -- I was measuring trees at the time -- and I was looking at it, just staring at it in awe.\n\n[Calling continues] ATTENBOROUGH: Naturalists fall in love with nature, and then come back for more.\n\nSeven years on, and experience has taught Miriam that the best way to observe the male King Bird is to find his display perch and then wait for him to arrive.\n\nTeaches you a lot of patience, doesn't it?\n\nATTENBOROUGH: And patience can often pay off.\n\nOh, there it is... Wow!\n\nThe King Bird.\n\nIt's facing that way, with its back towards us.\n\nYou can see the red back.\n\nIt's gone up into the canopy.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: He's a deep chili-pepper red, with a snow-white breast.\n\nTwo long quills sprout from his tail, each tipped by a green disk like a coin.\n\nThat was a rare moment.\n\nOh, there, there it is again.\n\nWow!\n\nATTENBOROUGH: She's thrilled.\n\nWith other males calling in the forest nearby, Miriam is sure that she's found a good population here.\n\n[Calling] The male King Bird will call to the females in the area.\n\n[Calling continues] If none come, he will perform without them.\n\nAfter puffing himself up, he flicks his quills above his head and waggles them, making the little disks dance in the air above him.\n\nHe's still hoping for an audience.\n\nUndeterred, he ends with a flourish.\n\nHe swings upside down and locks his legs.\n\nAnd then he turns himself into a pendulum.\n\nThe King Bird is a soloist.\n\nThe males of many other species display in groups.\n\nThese are the Greater Birds-of-paradise.\n\nMales assemble every day in one special tree, waiting for a female to arrive.\n\nWhen one does, they all snap into action.\n\nAnd she selects the one she prefers.\n\nShe's rewarded with a one-on-one -- starting with pecks on the head.\n\nAnd eventually she accepts him.\n\nWhile all the males may appear equally gorgeous to our eyes, females apparently detect differences.\n\nWhat's more, they nearly all mate with the same male.\n\nBy selecting the finest plumes in this way, the females have increased the males' beauty generation after generation, and so brought these magnificent dances into existence.\n\nThe spectacular beauty of their birds fascinates the people of New Guinea, as I discovered back in 1957.\n\nI knew that the bird-of-paradise plumes were important, and I quickly discovered just how important.\n\nThe plumes are the equivalent of money and an essential payment in the bargaining that goes on between families when fixing a wedding settlement... [Men singing in native language] ATTENBOROUGH: And when men want to dance.\n\nAnd what I saw 50 years ago is still going on today.\n\n[Men singing] ATTENBOROUGH: Goroka Town, in the heart of the mountains.\n\nIt's festival time, and feathers are still essential headwear.\n\nGo with the photograph, if you can.\n\nOr the -- ATTENBOROUGH: It's a key moment in the year for Miriam's research.\n\nLook at these and then look at what's on the headdresses.\n\nIf you see something like this... ATTENBOROUGH: The feathers of many different species of bird are used in the headdresses, and the team want to find out how many come from birds-of-paradise.\n\nThese scenes are not very different from those I filmed myself half a century earlier.\n\nATTENBOROUGH ON FILM: There were 500 of these men, stamping up and down monotonously and unceasingly.\n\nAnd as I watched them, I realized that here was the reason why no one had brought us birds-of-paradise.\n\nMiriam wants to see my footage from 1957 so that she can compare the numbers and species used by the dancers then and now.\n\nEach man was wearing the feathers of 30 or 40 birds.\n\nAt this one dance, we were seeing the plumes of over 20,000 slaughtered birds-of-paradise.\n\nThe desire to possess the beauty of the birds is an ancient obsession, still alive in these tribal lands.\n\nThe island of New Guinea is huge.\n\nA thousand miles long, lying between Australia and the equator, it was pushed up from the bottom of the sea way back in geological time.\n\nA few land mammals from Australia managed to get here -- including some marsupials, such as the strange tree kangaroo.\n\nBut there are no indigenous carnivorous mammals here.\n\nWith fruit growing all the year round, this is indeed a paradise for birds.\n\nThen, some 30,000 years ago, the greatest threat to their existence walked in on two legs.\n\nBut today, there are people here whose only aim is to protect the birds.\n\nPaul Igag was brought up on the coast, a fisherman's son.\n\nPaul gave up the fishing life to study biology.\n\nHe married a highland girl and stayed up here to pursue his love of forest birds.\n\n[Birds calling] The call of the Raggiana Bird-of-paradise.\n\nYou can see a male up there with full adult plumage.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: He's trying to attract females.\n\nPaul has seen many of the forest's rarest bird species.\n\nHe builds platforms in the canopy, where he can sit quietly and wait.\n\n[Calling continues] Some birds are quite bold and seem undisturbed by his presence.\n\nOthers are much more wary, like the magnificent Rifle-Bird of paradise.\n\nPaul has been watching the birds intensively for over 15 years.\n\n[Calling] His tracking skills are crucial to the project.\n\nTogether, Paul and Miriam start to identify the bird populations that may need protection.\n\nPaul is taking Miriam to a remote village southeast of Goroka.\n\nAs I did on my own journey to the interior, they have to cross high mountain ranges, blanketed by forest.\n\nBetween these walls of rock lie immense valleys, like the Wahgi.\n\nHundreds of tribes have lived on the island for thousands of years, separated by these barriers of water and rock.\n\n800 languages have evolved, some as different from one another as English is to Chinese.\n\nThe language of Haia Village is spoken only here.\n\nEven today, the only contact between these people and the outside world is the plane that takes away their coffee beans.\n\nIt's a warm welcome back for Paul.\n\nHe's been coming here for the last few years to help map tribal boundaries.\n\n[Speaking native language] ATTENBOROUGH: This forest belongs to the Haia people.\n\nThey have always been hunters -- but now they are helping to record the rich wildlife.\n\nOne day, all this may become a protected reserve.\n\nFor now, it's hundreds of square miles of untouched mountain forest.\n\nFor the villagers, a wildlife reserve could bring work and education.\n\nThere's a lot at stake.\n\nThe locals' hunting knowledge is invaluable for the project.\n\nPaul and Miriam need to find natural paths and trees in fruit if they are to locate all the threatened species.\n\nThe three-foot-long tail feathers of the male Black Sicklebill are the reason why his kind is almost extinct locally.\n\nHis plumes fetch the highest prices.\n\nBut hunting here has now been banned.\n\nThis trip is to find two special birds-of-paradise that are still unprotected by law.\n\nOne of them can sometimes be seen in the very early mornings, busy on the floor of the darkest parts of the forest.\n\nMiriam is looking for the Parotia Bird-of-paradise -- a bird with a very special dance.\n\nThe male Parotia is most particular about where he dances.\n\nAnd this could be the place.\n\nPaul is looking for the Magnificent Bird-of-paradise, a bird which also displays close to the ground, and is therefore very vulnerable to hunters.\n\nIGAG: \"Well, that's it,\" I said.\n\nThat's the display court, and that's it.\n\nWe will not get him there.\n\nWe didn't want to spend a long time in that area, because we want to come back and see the bird, so our presence there might, you know, spoil everything.\n\n[Thunder, pouring rain] ATTENBOROUGH: Six inches of rain can fall in a single day on Crater Mountain.\n\nAnd during the downpours, the birds-of-paradise shelter beneath the leaves.\n\n[Thunder] SUPUMA: I was sitting in the hide, thinking we might not get to see anything because it did rain.\n\nBloody mosquitoes.\n\nAnd then I heard a male Parotia.\n\nThere were other males calling, as well.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Black as the blackest night, he seems to absorb all the light around him.\n\nHe is Lawes' Parotia.\n\nOn his head, six strange wire-like plumes -- each tipped with a black pennant.\n\nOn his chest, a shield of iridescent green and gold.\n\nThis is his court, a stage he has carefully cleared so that he can dance unimpeded.\n\nCleaning away last night's leaf fall is essential housekeeping.\n\nA female arrives.\n\nShe is comparatively drab, with none of his flashy glamour.\n\nShe's touring all the courts in the neighborhood to choose a mate.\n\nHe sets about impressing her.\n\nBut one of his rivals has called by, uninvited.\n\nAnd he is followed by others.\n\nMore females arrive and take up seats for the performance.\n\n[Squawking] Tensions rise, but nobody dances.\n\n[Squawking] Suddenly, one of the intruders mates with a female.\n\nAnother male does the same.\n\nThe court has become a free-for-all.\n\nIt's not what Miriam expected.\n\nThey just went straight into mating without even any dance at all.\n\nIt's almost like skipping dinner and getting straight into dessert.\n\nIt would be nice to see them actually dancing.\n\nSitting in the hide for three or four hours isn't fun with all the mosquitoes, and you'd like to go away feeling that you've seen the whole performance.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: It is possible that the birds have been disturbed by the presence of humans in the forest around.\n\nIt will be several days before they venture back to try another filming session.\n\nPaul has been searching for the Magnificent Bird-of-paradise for a few days now, listening for their calls and quietly assessing their numbers.\n\nHe recently saw one far from here in the town market.\n\nAll birds-of-paradise have a street value.\n\nIt's not illegal for local people to hunt them or sell them.\n\nThey're a way of making some cash.\n\nIGAG: This is a Magnificent Bird-of-paradise.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: The hunters have mounted the bird's skin, complete with feathers, on a stick, ready to be stuck into a headdress.\n\nAnother bird wanders by, a Pheasant Pigeon, feeding on the forest floor.\n\nBut this is a female Magnificent, and here's another.\n\nThere's the female.\n\nThings look promising.\n\nThey can only have come for one reason.\n\nA flicker of gold, and there he is -- the Magnificent Bird-of-paradise.\n\nThe male Magnificent is clearing away leaves that have fallen on his court.\n\nDoves and pigeons are helping by picking up a few seeds.\n\nHe's stripping away moss and leaves, letting shafts of sunlight into his display court.\n\nHe wants to look his best.\n\nIGAG: It's really interesting to see the Magnificent Bird-of-paradise.\n\nThe feather itself is quite bright, and you can see it out there.\n\nIt's like a flame.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: The stage seems set, but there's a distraction.\n\nAnother male.\n\nThere's a standoff between the two males.\n\nThen the females take action.\n\n[Squawking] Surprisingly, they charge the intruder... [Squawking] And drive him out.\n\nWith his stage now to himself, the court maker can give the most interested female all his attention.\n\nHe begins to transform himself for her.\n\nPuffing and pulsing his breast feathers creates a special effect -- an emerald-green, heart-shaped breast shield to dazzle her with.\n\nNext to his eyes, two tiny iridescent spots flash at her.\n\nYou might think that this little jewel of a bird was one of a kind.\n\nBut he has a cousin on an offshore island that in isolation has changed into a different species -- Wilson's Bird-of-paradise.\n\nBoth have those sickle-shaped tail quills.\n\nBut his cousin has a bald head, and his scalp is blue.\n\nAnd whereas the Magnificent's back is a golden yellow, his cousin's back has turned red.\n\nDifferent populations, isolated in different areas, are still evolving different plumes to match the tastes of the local females.\n\nIGAG: We were thinking, when is mating taking place, when is mating taking place?\n\nIt's sort of an activity that probably goes on for a while, until only the birds know when is the right time.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: It's Paul's first sighting of a Magnificent Bird-of-paradise -- after 15 years working in the forest.\n\nSeveral days later, Miriam returns to the court of the Parotia.\n\nThe male is back on his dancing ground.\n\nBut the camera can't get a proper view.\n\nA log has dropped.\n\nIt's too late to build another hide.\n\nInstead, the crew has to make adjustments.\n\nThe log is propped up.\n\nThere is a risk, of course, that the court owner will notice the change and never come back.\n\nBut he does.\n\nIt's a very promising start.\n\nHe removes little bits of litter and prepares to perform one of the most complex dance routines in the whole bird world.\n\nBut now there's trouble -- an intruder, another male.\n\n[Squawking] But the owner of the court is not put off.\n\nAnd that is how it's supposed to be.\n\nSeeing the Parotia dance gives Miriam an insight into the intimate rituals of her people.\n\nSUPUMA: When I was sitting in the hide, I was thinking back to people here in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThey have these gatherings where they go into a hut and sit in a row, alternating male-female-male-female.\n\nThey start singing and rocking their heads back and forth...\n\nIt's like picking out someone they fancy.\n\nAnd I can understand why, when they do their traditional dance, they put the feathers on.\n\nProbably to them, represents something, you know, that's kind of sacred they find in the forest, and because of the bird's behavior -- it's a very unique and special bird.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Papuans are steeped in the mysteries of their tribal past.\n\nNobody knows it all, only that birds and humans have been together for thousands of years.\n\nThe desire to possess the beauty of the birds is an ancient obsession.\n\nEverywhere, the paradise birds are hunted and their plumes treasured and stored on the rafters in houses throughout the land.\n\nThese precious feathers are kept in bamboo tubes, ready to adorn the bodies of a new generation, to help them begin a new cycle of human life.\n\n[Drums playing] [People singing] Miriam and her team are counting feathers.\n\nShe wants clues as to which birds are suffering most from hunting.\n\n[Supuma speaking native language] ATTENBOROUGH: They question the dancers about where and how they got their feathers.\n\n[Man replying in native language] ATTENBOROUGH: She's keen to know about one species in particular.\n\nSUPUMA: What I have here is the Blue Bird-of-paradise.\n\nI've seen it worn by some of the highlanders on their headdress.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: It's a very vulnerable bird, and its feathers fetch high prices.\n\nSUPUMA: It's been hunted heavily in the past.\n\nI haven't seen it display in the wild, and if I were, that would be something.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: In the meantime, beliefs die hard.\n\nBut among them, there are some that can actually protect the birds.\n\n[Ghostly voices] There's a fear of angering the spirit world.\n\nAnd where spirits live, hunters will not go.\n\nIGAG: Imagine a mountain that is covered with forest.\n\nNo one goes up there.\n\nPeople believe that there is a spirit up there.\n\nPeople don't touch that mountain, so that forest remains intact.\n\nFor us working in conservation, it works perfectly.\n\nIt leaves that place unspoiled.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Early one morning, Paul and Miriam begin climbing up to part of the forest where hunters fear to tread, to look for two special birds-of-paradise.\n\nDifferent species live at different altitudes, depending on the rainfall and the type of fruit trees growing at different levels.\n\nEven today, not a great deal is known about these birds -- where they nest; how they raise their young; whether species overlap, even interbreed.\n\nBiologists are still trying to find the answers.\n\nField work like this brings its own delights.\n\nSUPUMA: I got my knickers wet!\n\n[Laughs] SUPUMA: It's a challenge in itself to working -- being a researcher and working in a remote area.\n\nSometimes you get to spend months and months out in the field, and you miss your comforts in life.\n\nThe tradeoff is that you get to listen to birds singing in the morning... You wake up to that every day.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Miriam is looking for the Blue Bird-of-paradise.\n\nIn undisturbed forest, she hopes to find populations of birds that will be less wary of humans.\n\nPaul is looking for the Superb Bird-of-paradise, whose breast feathers are so sought after.\n\nIt calls in the dense mid-canopy, but it displays on or near the ground, and in open spaces.\n\nA large fallen tree -- and there's a hopeful sign here.\n\nOn one side, some of the moss is missing.\n\nSmall dancing feet could have rubbed it away.\n\nThis could be a good place to watch for the Superb.\n\nBut the weather is not good.\n\n[Raining] [Speaking native language] ATTENBOROUGH: In wind and rain, birds, like people, take shelter.\n\nThere is nothing to be done except wait for a break in the weather.\n\nIt's now getting late in the birds' breeding cycle.\n\nTheir displays are becoming less frequent and intense.\n\nIt's been six days since the team built the hide beside the fallen tree.\n\nPaul arrives in the rain at 5:00 each morning and leaves in the rain at noon.\n\nAnd the fallen tree is just remaining a fallen tree.\n\nIn a damp thicket, Miriam is keeping vigil for the Blue Bird.\n\nDay seven, and finally a visitor to Paul's log -- but it's only a Ground Dove.\n\n[Bird calls] That's the call of the Superb.\n\nHe's making an advertising call from a high point.\n\n[Calling continues] And it's not far from Paul's hide.\n\n[Bird calling] SUPUMA: That's nearby.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: After many days of solid rain, the birds are quickly becoming active again.\n\nMiriam's bird, a Blue Bird, has come to the edge of the thicket and is calling.\n\nSUPUMA: I wonder if that's the same bird or two different birds.\n\n[Bird calling] ATTENBOROUGH: Paul's bird is calling nonstop.\n\nAnd there he is.\n\nThere's that fabulous green-and-blue breast shield.\n\nHe's trying to entice a female down from the canopy.\n\n[Calling] [Second bird calls] ATTENBOROUGH: But that's not her.\n\nThe call seems to irritate him.\n\nAnd there she is.\n\nHe transforms himself.\n\nA black cape appears behind his head.\n\nThen he moves into a trance-like state and he dances.\n\nSuccess.\n\nAnd here is that performance again.\n\nAll is not what it seems.\n\nThose spots that look like eyes are, in fact, feathers, reflecting the dawn light.\n\nThat clicking noise is not his wings striking the wood, but quills flicking against one another -- like the clicking of fingers.\n\nBizarre and beautiful.\n\nNo wonder his breast shield is so treasured by human dancers.\n\nIt's day nine.\n\nMiriam is still waiting for the Blue Bird to appear in the thicket in front of her.\n\n[Bird calling] He calls from nearby trees.\n\nCould the hide be putting him off?\n\nAt last, he comes... And takes up his position on his favorite branch in his own special way.\n\nSUPUMA: Wow!\n\nIt's our lucky day.\n\nI've never seen anything like this -- this is crazy.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: It's a performance of such exquisite beauty, it seems unfair that no female is here to see it.\n\nHe's serenading like a love-struck Romeo, but the balcony above is empty.\n\nOne can only sympathize.\n\nMale birds-of-paradise have played to empty seats for hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nIt's been their special evolutionary destiny to spend their lives displaying their beauty.\n\nIt's what makes them so extraordinary.\n\nThe next morning, the male Blue Bird returns.\n\nSuddenly he stops.\n\n[Calling] Miriam has seen something off camera.\n\nThere's a female in the tree above.\n\nSUPUMA: She's here, she's here!\n\nATTENBOROUGH: And now she's here, his performance changes.\n\nHis pulsing gives way to a subtle low buzzing that also throbs.\n\nIt's barely audible to human ears, but the microphone picks it up loud and clear.\n\nIt's an unearthly sound that he only makes in her presence.\n\nThere's nothing like it to be heard anywhere else in the bird world.\n\nSUPUMA: The vibrating movement and the puffing of the chest to expose the black patch was, you know, something intimate, and it only did that when the female was next to him.\n\nJust looking at it was -- gave you a sense of guilty pleasure just looking at them, it was something intimate going on between the two birds.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Moving closer, but without touching him, the female seems to be studying every feather of his vibrating body.\n\nSurely he's done enough...\n\nBut no.\n\nSUPUMA: And then all of a sudden she just flew away, and it was like, \"ugh!\n\nCome on!\"\n\nFor the male to go through all that, it was excruciating, just to put all that energy into it.\n\nAnd I think for him it was like, \"Okay, maybe we'll try another day.\"\n\nYeah.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Yet his effort is the whole point.\n\nMales can but try their best.\n\nThe rest is up to the females, and it was ever thus.\n\n[Calling] The plaintive call of the rejected male echoes across the mountains.\n\nThese dances have been performed here for millennia, but for how much longer?\n\nMiriam and her team have made a good start on their project.\n\nBut much more work needs to be done.\n\nSUPUMA: We need numbers.\n\nIn order to do that, we need to do research, so we need numbers so that we can see how they are fluctuating with time and with the different factors -- human population growth, hunting, disturbance, forest clearing -- so we can understand their conservation status better.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Meanwhile, to preserve the feathers that the dancers already have, the team are handing out mothballs.\n\nThese can be put inside the bamboo tubes in which the feathers are stored and so save them from decay.\n\nThat should reduce the demand for freshly hunted plumes.\n\nSUPUMA: If we were to lose one of these birds, or two, it could mean the loss of something that people hold close to their hearts.\n\nATTENBOROUGH: Papua New Guineans are now caring for their birds in a new way.\n\nThe birds have survived the tribal culture for thousands of years, but the world is changing, and their forest is changing.\n\nMiriam and Paul are starting a new conservation movement to ensure that generations to come will still be able to delight in these astonishing birds-of-paradise.\n\nTo learn more about what you've seen on this \"Nature\" program, visit pbs.org."
