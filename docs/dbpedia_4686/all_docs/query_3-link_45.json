        "text": "Woody Allen has been a leading figure in the film industry for more than 50 years. His use of black and white cinematography is one of his distinguishing stylistic elements. In his films, Allen masterfully employs this method to evoke strong feelings, important issues, and a certain atmosphere. From Manhattan to Celebrity, some of his most recognisable films make use of black and white photography.\n\nThe film Manhattan from 1979 is frequently cited as Allen’s finest work. The movie, which was beautifully shot in black and white, is a love letter to New York City, with its recognisable skyline and exquisite architecture. Allen’s use of black and white, which enables him to create a timeless and nostalgic ambiance, is crucial to the movie’s success. The contrast between the gleaming, dazzling metropolis and the darker, more private moments of the protagonists’ lives brilliantly captures the love themes of the movie. The amazing Zubin Mehta soundtrack also perfectly complements the film’s use of black and white photography as its backdrop.\n\nAnother one of Allen’s films that makes the most of black and white photography is Stardust Memories (1980). The movie offers an insightful examination of the artistic process and the mind of an artist. The use of black and white photography serves to contrast the protagonist’s recollections and feelings with the present. The contrast and grainy texture give the movie a raw, emotional feel that properly reflects the sufferings of the characters. In order to create a surrealistic ambiance that accurately captures the character’s state of mind, Allen again turns to black and white photography.\n\nMockumentary-style movie “Zelig” from 1983 tells the tale of a man who can change his appearance to match those around him. The majority of the black-and-white material was used in this faux-documentary style. “Zelig”’s use of black and white photography gives the film a genuine, historically accurate sense, as if it were a genuine documentary from the 1920s or 1930s. The usage of black and white in the movie also contributes to the nostalgic and whimsical feeling that we are reminiscing about a simpler time.\n\nAnother film that makes superb use of black and white photography is “Broadway Danny Rose” (1984). A talent agent who finds himself involved in a string of disasters is the subject of the movie’s character study. The choice of black and white in “Broadway Danny Rose” lends the movie a vintage, old-school vibe that harkens back to the height of Hollywood. The utilisation of light and shadow in the movie also contributes to its noir-like feel.\n\nA dark, Kafkaesque comedy from 1991 called “Shadows and Fog” is set in a fantastical, unidentified European city. The film is an homage to German Expressionist filmmakers Fritz Lang, G. W. Pabst and F. W. Murnau and is shot entirely in black and white, giving it the signature moody and atmospheric feel. The use of black and white photography in “Shadows and Fog” and its use of shadow and light is particularly effective, creating a sense of foreboding and unease.\n\nBlack and white cinematography has been a defining feature of many of Woody Allen’s films. It’s been used by Allen to improve the mood, tone, and atmosphere of his films, from the nostalgic atmosphere of Manhattan (his best work in my opinion) to the Expressionist atmosphere of Shadows and Fog. Allen has shown a profound awareness of the impact of black and white cinematography, whether he is emphasising the contrasts between light and dark or just paying homage to the traditional Hollywood era of cinema."
