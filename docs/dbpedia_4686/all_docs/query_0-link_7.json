        "text": "In a filmed interview for a documentary history of our national pastime we made several years ago, the writer and essayist Gerald Early told us that \"when they study our civilization two thousand years from now, there will only be three things that Americans will be known for: the Constitution, baseball and jazz music. They're the three most beautiful things Americans have ever created.\" His astute comment made me realize that we have worked almost unceasingly for the past nearly seventeen years on a series of projects to honor that statement. Having grappled with many Constitutional issues in our Civil War series (the Constitution's greatest test) and many other films, and having explored our national pastime and its exquisite lessons in our series on Baseball, we have over the last several years struggled to understand the utterly American art form of jazz.\n\nWhat each of the three subjects daily reminded us was that the genius of America is improvisation, our unique experiment a profound intersection of freedom and creativity, for better and for worse, in nearly every gesture and breath. Nowhere is this more apparent than in jazz — the only art form created by Americans, an enduring and indelible expression of our genius and promise. And so, in Jazz, we complete our trilogy of American life, finding in the music's lines and phrases and riffs not only a meditation on American creativity, but a joyous and sublime celebration of the redemptive future possibilities of this remarkable republic.\n\nFor those of us engaged in trying to understand it, the history of jazz turns out to be much more than a study of this extraordinary American music. Jazz has offered a precise prism through which so much of American history can be seen — it is a curious and unusually objective witness to the 20th Century. It is the story of two world wars and a devastating Depression — the soundtrack that helped Americans get through the worst of times. Jazz is about sex, the way men and women talk to each other, and negotiate the complicated rituals of courtship; a sophisticated and elegant mating call that has all but disappeared from popular music in recent times. It is about drugs and the terrible cost of addiction and the high price of creativity. It is about the growth and explosion of radio and the soul of great American cities — New Orleans (where the music was born), Chicago, Kansas City and New York (where it grew up). It is about immigration and assimilation and feeling dispossessed — and the music that came to the rescue. It is about movement and dance and showing your behind. It's about entertainment — the frequently dismissed but sacred communion between artist and audience. It's about solitude and loneliness and the nearly unbearable burden of consciousness. It's about suffering and celebration — it's hugely about celebration — and tapping your feet.\n\nAnd Jazz is also a story about race and race relations and prejudice, about minstrelsy and Jim Crow, lynchings and civil rights. Jazz explores the uniquely American paradox that our greatest art form was created by those who have had the peculiar experience of being unfree in our supposedly free land. African-Americans in general, and black jazz musicians in particular, carry a complicated message to the rest of us, a genetic memory of our great promise and our great failing, and the music they created and then generously shared with the rest of the world negotiates and reconciles the contradictions many of us would rather ignore. Embedded in the music, in its riveting biographies and soaring artistic achievement, can be found our oft-neglected conscience, a message of hope and transcendence, of affirmation in the face of adversity, unequaled in the unfolding drama and parade we call American history.\n\nWhen I began this project, I had perhaps two jazz records in my fairly large collection. Today, I can't find the other records. I listen to jazz all the time — old and new, straight-ahead and avant-garde and fusion, swing and bop and cool. I play it day and night, in the car, as I go to bed, as I write now, its sophisticated rhythms and elegant American lines simply medicine for me. But there is one musician whose work I listen to more than any other. The biggest surprise and delight of all has been getting to know the power and force and genius of Louis Armstrong.\n\nI had always known that he was important to the history of the music, but he had mostly come down to me as a guy with a smile and a handkerchief, a singer of popular songs like Hello Dolly and It's a Wonderful World. I was not prepared for the truth, borne out in interview after interview, record after record: Louis Armstrong is quite simply the most important person in American music. He is to 20th century music (I did not say jazz) what Einstein is to physics, Freud is to medicine and the Wright Brothers are to travel. He transformed first instrumental playing, liberating jazz, cutting it loose from nearly all constraints, essentially inventing what we call swinging, and then brought an equally great revolution to singing. And he did it all with a heart and a humanity so spiritually encompassing that my own contemplation of mortality is now tempered by the undying hope that I will get to hear him playing with Gabriel someday. (And as he would say, blowing Gabriel out of the clouds.) To make this discovery was startling and exhilarating and thrilling.\n\nEach time we did an interview for the film, whether it was with musicians who played with him years ago or musicians struggling today to come to terms with his legacy; whether it was critics, writers or historians, friends, hangers-on or people in management, each would in the end shake their head and say that Louis Armstrong was a \"gift from God\" or \"an Angel.\" Near the end of the editing process, I happened to be out on the road and came across a women who for lack of a better word is a psychic, a medium familiar with things not of this world. When I told her of the interviews and how each person had called Armstrong an angel, she closed her eyes and smiled and said softly, \"biggest wings I've ever seen.\"\n\nBut maybe Wynton Marsalis, a great trumpet player in his own right, said it best when I asked him about Louis. He had already insisted that Armstrong was chosen by God \"to bring the feeling and message and the identity of jazz to everybody.\" But in a final reflection said,\n\nLouis Armstrong's overwhelming message is one of love. When you hear his music, it's of joy... He was just not going to be defeated by the forces of life. And these forces visit all of us... My great-great grandmother used to say that \"life has a board for every behind\" and it's a board just fit to yours, so maybe your board is not going to work on someone else's behind. And when it's your turn ... that paddle is going to put on your booty and it's going to hurt as bad as it can hurt. And Louis Armstrong is there to tell you after you get that paddling, \"It's all right son.\""
