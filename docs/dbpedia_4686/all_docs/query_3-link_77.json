They have different ISOs and use different emulsions that react uniquely to light. That means some film stocks are better suited to certain types of photography.\n\nWe’ll take you through all the best black and white film rolls available. And we’ll start by saying our top choice is the Ilford HP5 Plus. It’s the most versatile black and white film on the market. It has a 400 ISO and a fine grain structure. You can use it for everything from portraits to street photography.\n\nWhat Is the Best Black And White Film?\n\nFilm photography is experiencing another boom period. Many photographers are putting down their digital cameras and picking up analog cameras instead.\n\nSome young photographers avoid digital altogether. They are going straight for film cameras.\n\nWe’re far beyond questioning, “Is film dead?” We know film photography is alive and kicking. And there’s no better example of this than the black and white film market.\n\nWhile color films remain limited, the black and white market is full of variety. Film photographers have plenty of stocks to choose from.\n\nBut before you buy, there are a few things to consider. First, you need to think about the size of the film. Do you need 35mm or 120mm film for your camera?\n\nISO is another important consideration. Every film has a set ISO. So you need to choose the one that’s right for your photography. You also have things like grain structure and flexibility.\n\nSkip to the FAQ section to learn more about black and white film.\n\nHere’s a full rundown of the best back and white film stocks. We’ll take a more detailed look at each film in the following section. And we’ve included examples to give you a better idea of what to expect from each roll.\n\n15 Best Black And White Film\n\nThe black and white film scene has never been more vibrant. Today’s film photographers have plenty of stocks to choose from.\n\nYou have different film rolls with a wide range of ISOs. Plus, several companies are producing reliable rolls of 35mm and 120mm film. We’ve included stocks from Ilford, Foma, and Rollei.\n\nThe Ilford HP5 Plus 400 is our top black and white film pick. Ilford is the master of black and white film. And their HP5 Plus is the most popular roll with film photographers.\n\nThe HP5 400 is the best all-around roll of film with incredible versatility. With an ISO of 400 and a fine grain structure, it works well in low-light conditions.\n\nIt gives you consistent results even when lighting conditions are inconsistent. The results outdoors are fabulous, with deep contrasts in natural light.\n\nYou can also use HP5 for indoor photography. The detail and brightness give you top results when shooting indoor events. And the higher light sensitivity allows you to shoot concert photography.\n\nHP5 Plus 400 is the ultimate all-around black and white film stock. And you can also buy Ilford HP5 Plus in 120mm for medium-format cameras.\n\nFomapan 100 has been a revelation to me as a photographer. It’s one of the cheapest 100 ISO stocks available. And this led me to believe it was an inferior film.\n\nHow wrong I was. When I tried Fomapan 100 for the first time, I was blown away by the results.

But it gives you beautiful results when you know how to get the best out of it.\n\nIt has a 125 ISO, which is unusual. Most film cameras don’t have a 125 ISO setting.

And you might need to use a fast lens and tripod to get the best results.\n\nThe Rollei RPX 25 is a high-quality film for serious analog enthusiasts. It is also available as 120-format film.\n\nDelta 400 is another 400 ISO film from Ilford. It has a wider tonal range than the HP5 Plus. And it gives you a wider variety of grey tones throughout the grey scale.\n\nThere’s a lower contrast level, so the images have a softer impact.

Film shooters should always have a roll of Ilford Delta 400 in their camera backpacks. It’s also available as 120 medium-format film.\n\nFomapan 200 is a funny old film. Many have asked if the world really needs a 200 ISO black and white film. But I think it does.

And Fomapan 200 is the perfect roll for experimenting with slower films.\n\nThis film is more forgiving than most 100 ISO stocks. Details aren’t lost to blackness if you don’t get the exposure spot on.\n\nIt does tend to produce flat and monotone images.

It’s a great starting place if you’re new to film photography.\n\nThe quality is consistent from roll to roll. And it’s forgiving if you’re still getting used to the exposure settings.\n\nIt isn’t only a film for beginners. Professional shooters are also using it more and more. You get a wide tonal range with soft shades of grey. The detail is good. But you do get a fairly strong level of visible grain.\n\nSome might not like the grain of Lady Grey. But other photographers want a grainy texture in their photographs.\n\nThat’s one of the reasons Lomography Lady Grey B&W is growing in popularity. And if you care about the future of film photography, you should support the Lomography project.\n\nIlford Delta 3200 is a professional film for low-light photography.

It’s the only mass-produced 80 ISO black and white film on the market.

But Retro 80s, with its deeper black tones, gives you the best of both worlds. You get rich, silky blacks. But you also get lots of grey details in the lighter areas.\n\nMost cameras will only have settings for 100 or 50 ISO, so an 80 ISO film is a tricky one. It’s best to set your camera to 100 ISO, but understand you’ll need a little bit more light.\n\nRollei have kept their prices low. Rollei Retro 80s isn’t their cheapest stock. But it’s still more affordable than most films from other brands.\n\nFomapan 400 is one of the best black and white film stocks just due to its price. While film prices are skyrocketing, Foma prices are staying low. So it is the best-value film on the market.\n\nIt isn’t as reliable as the Ilford HP5 Plus. But it does give you similar results.

But it can be a confusing topic when you’re just starting.\n\nThere are lots of technical terms. You have loads of brand names to remember. And finding a film that matches your needs as a photographer can be difficult.\n\nWe’ve answered some of the most frequently asked questions to help guide you.\n\nWhy Use Black and White Film?\n\nThe timeless quality of black and white photos excites our imagination. And they have a heightened sense of mystery and romance. Before the arrival of color film, everyone had to use black and white film.\n\nColor film was a revelation when it was first released. But black and white photography continued in the background. And now, black and white photography is once again growing in popularity.\n\nColor gives us a more true-to-life image. It captures the vivid tones and hues of our colorful world. But black and white photography has more depth.\n\nAnd using black and white film also makes you work harder as a photographer. You can’t rely on color to dazzle the viewer. It forces you to look for other elements to make the shot interesting.\n\nYou need to look for areas of contrast. You have to find shapes and textures. And your composition has to be perfect, so using black and white film makes you a better photographer.\n\nWhich Brands Make Black and White Film?\n\nBlack and white photographers are lucky. Unlike color film, many brands make good-quality black and white film. There’s Kodak, Ilford, Fomapan, Rollei, and Lomography.\n\nKodak is one of the biggest manufacturers. They dominate the color film scene. And they also have a couple of good black and white options. But their price hikes are turning film shooters away.\n\nIlford is the biggest name in black and white film photography. Their HP5 Plus and Delta 400 are two of the most popular film stocks. They also produce other films with higher and lower film speeds.\n\nAll film photographers should try Fomapan films. You can get 100, 200, or 400 ISO film rolls. They’ve kept their prices low. So they offer excellent value for money.\n\nAnd Rollei is another film brand offering excellent value. They have a wide range of films available. And they’re all set at a good price.\n\nFinally, Lomography is a name all film shooters should know. It isn’t just a film brand. They have created a community around analog photography. And they have been working for decades to revive the film photography scene.\n\nLomography has some excellent films available. And you can join their online community and share your images.\n\nWhy Is ISO Important in Film Photography?\n\nYou can change the ISO setting on digital cameras. But rolls of film have a set ISO that can’t be changed. Every film has a set ISO number.\n\nThe ISO number indicates how sensitive the film is to light. The higher the number, the more sensitive it is. This means a film with a low ISO needs more light to expose.\n\nBut while a low ISO needs more light, it does produce better image quality. A film with a higher ISO is more prone to having a grainy texture. Plus, you also lose detail and depth of tone.\n\nEvery film has strengths and limitations based on its ISO level. Low ISO films give you outstanding image quality. But it’s best to have bright light and long exposure times.\n\nHigh-ISO films have fewer tones and more grain. But you can use them in low-light situations.\n\nSo ISO plays a large part in determining the best black and white film. If you want intense quality and a smooth finish, you need 100 ISO or lower film. Night photographers need something like a 3200 ISO film.\n\n400 ISO sits right in the middle. They work well in different lighting conditions. And you might get the odd hint of grain. But the quality is still excellent. That’s why 400 ISO films are so popular with film shooters.\n\nWhere Can I Share My Black and White Film Photos?\n\nThe film photography scene has a thriving community. And there are many ways to share your black and white film photos with other enthusiasts.\n\nFacebook is a great place to start. There are plenty of excellent groups where people share images, info, and tips.\n\nFollowing hashtags like that also helps you find other film photographers to follow. You can also try a new app for photographers called Plates.\n\nYou can also become a member of the Lomography community. Their website allows you to share your work.\n\nYou can find other people’s film photos. You can find people using specific rolls of black and white film. And you can publish the films you like to use.\n\nYou need to digitize your photos to share them online. The best way to do this is with a photo scanner. You can get flatbed photo scanners. Or you can use dedicated film scanners for scanning negatives.\n\nConclusion: The Best Black And White Film\n\nThere’s a wide variety of black and white films to choose from. You have options from Ilford and Kodak. And you can also try film stocks from Foma and Rollei. You have every ISO you need to shoot any photo in black and white."
