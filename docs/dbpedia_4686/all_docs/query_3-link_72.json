About this list: Back in the day, films were made in black and white because they had to be. Now, the reasoning behind the decision to dispense with colour is filled with thought and purpose and creative intention. Or at least we hope it is. Luckily, there are some fine examples that prove the existence of method behind the monochromatic madness. Most producers and directors of the modern age choose colour film because it's a progressive representation of truth - that is to say, we see the world in colour, we interact in colour, so when the ability to communicate in colour is gifted to us... we snap it up. Why wouldn't we? Using evolutionary logic, it might seem that to revert to black and white film, makes no sense. But this 'step back' in time can actually serve to strip back the experience offered to our senses, therefore encouraging a purer focus on the story in front of us.",
