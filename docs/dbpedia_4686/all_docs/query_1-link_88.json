        "text": "A Louisiana woman who the state contends is black has gone to court to have herself declared white, and that is but the short of it.\n\nThe story, a story as old as the country, has elements of anthropology and sociology special to this region, and its message, here in 1982 America, is that it is still far better to be white than black. Some New Orleans blacks are cheering the woman on.\n\nHer name is Susie Guillory Phipps. She is a 48-year-old, blackhaired woman with big dark eyes, and she says she was flabbergasted and sickened to learn when she applied for a birth certificate five years ago that the state's Bureau of Vital Statistics had her down as ''colored.''\n\n''I'm not light,'' she said, pointing to her face. ''I'm white.'' Traced Back 222 Years\n\nSo say thousands of Louisianians with Negroes in their ancestry, while thousands of others, blue-eyed and light as day, consider themselves black. In Mrs. Phipps's case, the state has traced her geneology back 222 years, to a black slave named Margarita, Mrs. Phipps's great-great-great-great grandmother.\n\nThe great-great-great-great grandfather was a white planter named John Gregoire Guillory. Louisiana law since 1970 has held that if a person has one thirty-second ''Negro blood,'' the person is black. Before 1970 ''a trace'' of Negro ancestry made a person black in the eyes of the state.\n\nThe 1970 law is the only one in the country that gives any equation for determining a person's race. Elsewhere in most of the nation, race is simply a matter of what the parents tell the authorities to record on the birth certificate, with no questions asked. The chief advocate of the Louisiana law at the time it was passed, a New Orleans lawyer who asked not to have his name published, said he was then representing a white family whose child was given a black birth certificate because when the documents came through the state office, someone ''saw the name and it alerted him to the fact that the family had a trace of Negro blood.''
