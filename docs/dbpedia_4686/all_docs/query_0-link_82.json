For other uses, see Rabbit (disambiguation).\n\nA rabbit is an uncommon passive mob and is a source of rabbit's foot, rabbit hide, and raw rabbit.\n\nSpawning[]\n\nRabbits spawn above grass, snow blocks, or sand. They generate individually after the generation of the world.\n\nRabbits of the following colors spawn in the following biomes:\n\nYellow:\n\nDesert\n\nWhite, Black & White:\n\nSnowy Plains\n\nSnowy Taiga\n\nGrove\n\nSnowy Slopes\n\nFrozen Ocean‌[BE only]\n\nFrozen River‌[BE only]\n\nSnowy Beach‌[BE only]\n\nBlack, Brown, Brown & White:\n\nFlower Forest\n\nTaiga\n\nMeadow\n\nOld Growth Pine Taiga‌[JE only]\n\nOld Growth Spruce Taiga‌[JE only]\n\nCherry Grove\n\nCreamy rabbits are the most common rabbit color and are found only in deserts and its variants. White and black and white rabbits are also quite common and spawn in snowy biomes such as snowy taigas, snowy plains, groves and snowy slopes. Default rabbit colors such as brown, black and salt and pepper spawn naturally in flower forests, taigas and meadows, but can also spawn in any other non-snowy biome via spawn eggs, commands, spawners or breeding. In all these places, groups of an adult and one to two babies spawn.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition, up to three kits spawn in flower forests and rabbits can also spawn in frozen aquatic biomes: snowy beaches, frozen oceans, and frozen rivers.\n\nIn Java Edition, rabbits can also be found in giant tree taigas.\n\nIn taigas, wolves and foxes are also found. If left alone, these may quickly kill rabbits, so rabbits are generally more plentiful in the desert, flowery or icy biomes.\n\nThe Killer Bunny does not spawn naturally and must instead be spawned using the /summon command, although it is exclusive to Java Edition.\n\nDesert Forest Taiga Frozen Snowy plains Mountain Biome Desert Flower forest Taiga\n\nOld growth taiga‌[JE only]\n\nSnowy taiga Frozen river\n\nLegacy frozen ocean‌[BE only]\n\nSnowy beach‌[BE only]\n\nFrozen ocean‌[BE only] All snowy plains variants Meadow\n\nGrove\n\nSnowy slopes\n\nDrops[]\n\nWhen killed, an adult rabbit drops:\n\n0–1 rabbit hide. The maximum is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n0–1 raw rabbit (cooked rabbit if killed while on fire).‌[Bedrock Edition only] The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 0-4 with Looting III.\n\n1 raw rabbit (cooked rabbit if killed while on fire).‌[Java Edition only] The maximum amount is increased by 1 per level of Looting, for a maximum of 1-4 with Looting III.\n\nThere is a 10% chance of dropping a rabbit's foot upon death when killed by the player or a tamed wolf. The chance can be increased by 3% per level of Looting, up to a maximum chance of 19% with Looting III.\n\n1–3 upon player kills.\n\nUpon successful breeding, 1–7 is dropped.\n\nBehavior[]\n\nRabbits hop around aimlessly instead of walking. They can jump up almost 2 blocks in height. They slowly approach players holding carrots, golden carrots or dandelions within 8 blocks. They don't follow the players that hold carrot on a stick although pigs do.[1] Rabbits also jump off of cliffs to reach carrots but do not go into lava for them. They randomly flee around if attacked. All non-hostile rabbits avoid players within 8 blocks and avoid most hostile mobs within 4 blocks (except slimes, magma cubes, and ghasts). They also avoid wolves within 10 blocks.\n\nIf /gamerule mobGriefing is true, rabbits find and eat mature carrot crops‌[Java Edition only] / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1‌[Bedrock Edition only]. This reduces the growth stage by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.\n\nWild wolves, foxes, and stray cats track down and kill any rabbits.\n\nBreeding[]\n\nRabbits can be bred using carrots, golden carrots or dandelions.\n\nBaby rabbits usually inherit the same type of fur as one of the parents (47.5% chance of each), but there is a 5% chance for the baby to have the fur type matching the current biome. Baby rabbits grow to adulthood after 20 minutes, although their growth can be slowly accelerated using carrots, golden carrots or dandelions; each use reduces 10% of the remaining time to grow up.\n\nDespite their hostile nature, killer bunnies can breed with other rabbits and with each other, having the unusual chance of creating a baby killer bunny.\n\nA Toast rabbit does not produce a Toast rabbit baby, however.\n\nIn Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, baby rabbits follow their parents; this behavior is absent in Java Edition.[2]\n\nVariations[]\n\nRabbits typically spawn using one of six different skins. Skins include regular brown fur, white fur with red eyes (albino), black mottled fur, black and white spotted fur, gold (cream) fur, and salt and pepper fur. The biome determines the skin used:\n\nRabbits in snowy biomes have 80% white fur and 20% black and white fur.\n\nRabbits in deserts have 100% gold fur.\n\nRabbits in other biomes have 50% brown fur, 40% salt & pepper fur, and 10% black fur.\n\nRabbits with specific skins can be spawned using /summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType: (Number from 0 - 5)}‌[Java Edition only] or /summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ in_desert (gold)/in_snow (white)‌[Bedrock Edition only].\n\nWhile it is possible to go above 5, this results in rabbits with skins identical to RabbitType: 0, with the exception of RabbitType: 99, the Killer Bunny.\n\nThere are two special variants of rabbits:\n\nThe Killer Bunny[]\n\nThe killer bunny is an aggressive variant of the rabbit exclusive to Java Edition that is hostile toward players, foxes, and wolves. Its fur is pure white with blood-red eyes that are horizontal, compared to a normal rabbit's vertical eyes. It can be spawned only by using the /summon rabbit ~ ~ ~ {RabbitType:99} command. It appears with a nameplate over its head reading \"The Killer Bunny\".\n\nIf the killer bunny finds any player within a 16-block radius, it hops toward the player much faster than a normal rabbit. It moves in a style similar to that of a spider. Once it closes in, it jumps at the player, dealing 8 damage on Normal difficulty. If the player strikes at the killer bunny, it runs away for a brief moment, then returns to lunging at the player. Killer bunnies are immune to the Thorns enchantment.\n\nIf it cannot find a player, the killer bunny actively seeks out and attacks any foxes or wolves, including tamed wolves. These mobs, in return, attack the killer bunny, leading to a vicious fight.\n\nOn peaceful difficulty, the killer bunny does not despawn, despite its hostile nature. It still attacks wolves and tamed wolves, but not the player.\n\nThe killer bunny can be bred and leashed and follows players holding carrots, despite its hostile nature.\n\nToast[]\n\n\"Toast\" redirects here. For messages displayed on-screen, see Toasts, Advancements, Recipes, or Tutorial hints. For Bread, see Bread.\n\nNaming a rabbit Toast (using either a name tag or a renamed spawn egg) re-textures it to have the appearance of a black dutch, with a large black and white patch and more black fur around the face than the natural black and white spotted rabbit. Other than its name and skin, Toast behaves exactly like it would if it were unnamed. When Toast rabbits are bred, whether with each other or with regular rabbits, their offspring do not have the Toast pattern; they have a pattern consistent with the parents' original coloring prior to renaming. If the player renames a killer bunny to Toast, it still attacks players and wolves. Like the killer bunny, Toast does not spawn naturally.\n\nThis rabbit is the skin of user xyzen420's girlfriend's missing rabbit, which Ryan Holtz implemented as a memorial.[3]\n\nSounds[]\n\nJava Edition:\n\nRegular rabbits use the Friendly Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events. Killer bunnies use the Hostile Creatures sound category for entity-dependent sound events.\n\nSoundSubtitlesSourceDescriptionResource locationTranslation keyVolumePitchAttenuation\n\ndistancehttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_idle1.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_idle2.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_idle3.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_idle4.oggRabbit squeaksFriendly Creatures(normal)\n\nHostile Creatures(killer)Randomlyentity .rabbit .ambientsubtitles .entity .rabbit .ambient0.250.8-1.2\n\n(Baby: 1.3-1.7)16 https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_attack1.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_attack2.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_attack3.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_attack4.oggRabbit attacksHostile CreaturesWhen the killer bunny attacks somethingentity .rabbit .attacksubtitles .entity .rabbit .attack1.00.8-1.216 https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_death.oggRabbit diesFriendly Creatures(normal)\n\nHostile Creatures(killer)When a rabbit diesentity .rabbit .deathsubtitles .entity .rabbit .death0.50.8-1.2\n\n(Baby: 1.3-1.7)16 https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hurt1.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hurt2.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hurt3.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hurt4.oggRabbit hurtsFriendly Creatures(normal)\n\nHostile Creatures(killer)When a rabbit is damagedentity .rabbit .hurtsubtitles .entity .rabbit .hurt0.50.8-1.2\n\n(Baby: 1.3-1.7)16 https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hop1.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hop2.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hop3.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hop4.oggRabbit hopsFriendly Creatures(normal)\n\nHostile Creatures(killer)When a rabbit hopsentity .rabbit .jumpsubtitles .entity .rabbit .jump0.10.64-0.9616\n\nBedrock Edition:\n\nSoundSourceDescriptionResource locationVolumePitchhttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_idle1.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_idle2.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_idle3.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_idle4.oggFriendly CreaturesRandomlymob .rabbit .idle0.20.8-1.2 (Baby: 1.3-1.7) https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_death.oggFriendly CreaturesWhen a rabbit diesmob .rabbit .death0.40.8-1.2 (Baby: 1.3-1.7) https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hurt1.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hurt2.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hurt3.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hurt4.oggFriendly CreaturesWhen a rabbit is damagedmob .rabbit .hurt0.40.8-1.2 (Baby: 1.3-1.7) https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hop1.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hop2.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hop3.ogghttps://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:Rabbit_hop4.oggFriendly CreaturesUnused sound eventmob .rabbit .hop0.11.0\n\nData values[]\n\nID[]\n\nJava Edition:\n\nNameIdentifierEntity tags (JE)Translation key Rabbitrabbitpowder_snow_walkable_mobsentity.minecraft.rabbit\n\nBedrock Edition:\n\nNameIdentifierNumeric ID Translation key Rabbitrabbit18entity.rabbit.name\n\nEntity data[]\n\nRabbits have entity data associated with them that contain various properties.\n\nJava Edition:\n\nMain article: Entity format\n\nBedrock Edition:\n\nSee Bedrock Edition level format/Entity format.\n\nAchievements[]\n\nIcon Achievement In-game description Actual requirements (if different) Gamerscore earned Trophy type (PS4) PS4 OtherRabbit SeasonCook and Eat Rabbit Meat—15GBronze\n\nAdvancements[]\n\nIcon Advancement In-game description Parent Actual requirements (if different) Resource location It Spreads\n\nKill a mob near a Sculk Catalyst Monster HunterKill one of these 70 mobs near a sculk catalyst: Mobs that drop no experience are ignored for this advancement.adventure/kill_mob_near_sculk_catalyst The Parrots and the Bats\n\nBreed two animals together HusbandryBreed a pair of any of these 25 mobs: A mule must be the result of breeding a horse and a donkey for this advancement as they are not breedable together.

They would spawn randomly and jump around. When attacked, they would pop into many pieces and start bleeding. May 20, 2009Bunnies were ultimately rejected at the time due to negative feedback. Java Edition 1.8May 17, 2014Screenshots of rabbits were released by Ryan Holtz. June 5, 2014Rabbits are revealed as a feature to be added to Minecraft. June 6, 2014Twitter user @xyZenTV asks Ryan Holtz to add Toast to the game. Ryan Holtz accepts the Toast suggestion, and reveals he is planning for rabbits to have multiple skins, similar to horses and cats. June 30, 2014Holtz uploaded a \"video\" showcasing the mob's path-finding and animation. Holtz reveals a preview of the rabbit's drops. July 1, 2014 Holtz reveals a hostile variant of rabbits, the \"Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog\". July 2, 2014Holtz tweets a screenshot of all six natural rabbit types, just prior to their introduction. 14w27a Added rabbits.
