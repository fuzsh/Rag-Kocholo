        "text": "1. Should I offer birdseed year-round?\n\nYes! Cardinals require food throughout the year as they are not known to migrate. It is important to keep your feeders filled or the cardinals will leave to find food elsewhere. Cardinals have a high metabolism and therefore need to eat all day long. Cardinals nest late winter through late summer and ample natural food is not available, so they require additional food while breeding and raising their young. From early fall through the winter season, natural food sources become difficult to find, so it is incredibly important to keep your feeders filled with birdseed during this time.\n\n2. What is the best bird food to offer?\n\nCardinals love Black Oil Sunflower Seeds and Safflower Seeds above all others. Birdseed blends are also wonderful to offer should you wish to attract other beautiful birds in addition to cardinals. Wagner’s offers a variety of high quality birdseed such as Wagner’s Cardinal Blend. They offer mixes to attract any backyard bird species with prices to fit any budget. Wagner’s products are available online and at countless retailers throughout the United States.\n\n3. Where should I store my birdseed?\n\nThe best place to story seed is elevated on a shelf in a cool, dry area such as your shed, garage or basement. Birdseed that is stored in any type of container should be closed tightly. It is very important that your storage location has good air circulation and is away from direct sunlight. Avoid storing your seed on a ceramic floor as moisture could be transferred to the seed. Keeping your seed dry will help it to last much longer.\n\n4. What do cardinals eat during the winter months?\n\nIn addition to large seeds, northern cardinals enjoy eating crushed peanuts, cracked corn, and berries. Suet cakes and/or small chunks of suet are another great choice. Be sure to check your feeders in the early morning and in the late afternoon which are the most common times that cardinals prefer to eat.\n\n5. What do cardinals eat during spring, summer, and autumn?\n\nBird seeds that are known to attract northern cardinals are black oil sunflower, cracked corn, suet, Nyjer seed, mealworms, crushed peanuts, safflower, striped sunflower, and sunflower hearts and chips.\n\n6. Where should I place my feeder?\n\nIt is best to display your feeder close to natural shelter such as trees and shrubs which will provide protection for the birds. Cardinals want to feel safe and protected while they are eating.\n\n7. Should I offer birdseed year-round?\n\nYes, cardinals require food throughout the year as they are not known to migrate. It is important to keep your feeders filled or the cardinals will leave to find food elsewhere. Cardinals have a high metabolism and therefore need to eat all day long. Cardinals nest late winter through late summer and ample natural food is not available, so they require additional food while breeding and raising their young. From early fall through the winter season, natural food sources become difficult to find, so it is incredibly important to keep your feeders filled with birdseed during this time.\n\n8. How do I stop squirrels from eating all of my birdseed?\n\nSquirrels are the most common problem at backyard feeders, which is why a large number of feeder styles have been designed to prevent squirrels from reaching the seed. One example are feeders that use a weighted system that closes the feeder port when the squirrel’s weight is sensed. Squirrel baffles are available to place above or below your feeder, which depends on how your feeder is mounted. Baffles prevent the squirrels from reaching your feeder altogether. It is also good to know that safflower and nyjer seeds are two types of birdseed that squirrels do not enjoy. Many individuals offer cracked corn for the squirrels in an open feeder far away from their bird feeders."
