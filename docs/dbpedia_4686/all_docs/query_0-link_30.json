        "text": "There have been a number of nonfiction accounts that have tackled the Nazis’ horrific, systematic “Final Solution” — but Ken Burns’ six-and-a-half hour docuseries comes at the subject from a slightly different angle. In addition to chronicling how the rise of Nazism in Germany would lead to Jewish persecution on a mass scale, the filmmaker and co-directors Sarah Botstein and Lynn Novick chart how the response (or lack thereof) of the U.S. would end up adding to the death count. From racism-fueled immigration laws to homegrown antisemitism, pro-isolationist policies to sheer indifference, these three episodes offer a counternarrative to the notion that America was offering refuge to European Jews and opposing Hitler’s plans from the very beginning. It’s a sobering look at how a nation’s inability to recognize or care about what was happening elsewhere turned into benign complicity, and a history lesson that somehow seems more timely than ever.\n\n(Bonus viewing: Three Minutes: A Lengthening, which turns a snippet of pre-WWII footage of a small Polish town into a forensic examination of the damage done; and Who We Are: A Study of Racism in America, which gives a lecture by Jeffrey Robinson on our inability to deal with race the full An Inconvenient Truth treatment.)\n\nW. Kamau Bell’s four-part docuseries on the good, the bad, the ugly, and the very ugly regarding Bill Cosby’s six decades in the spotlight examines how the comedian constructed his persona of the lovable, family-friendly philanthropist — and then used that same persona to hide the fact that he was serially drugging women and allegedly raping them throughout his career. It’s not interested in dropping bombshells or staging “gotcha” moments so much as sifting through the rubble of this once-beloved figure’s reign as “America’s dad” and asking why we refused to believe that he was capable of such horrifying things for so long. The voices of survivors are given a platform to speak about their trauma, while Bell himself tries to reconcile his (and, by extension, our) feelings over a personal hero who turned out to be a monster. A tough watch, but a rewarding one.\n\nYou’d see it on fliers and bulletin boards all around Chicago circa 1969: “Pregnant? Need help? Call Jane.” If you dialed the number, you’d could leave your information on a message machine. Someone would get back to you and, if you so desired, help facilitate the termination of a pregnancy. Directors Tia Lessin and Emma Pildes delve into a relatively unknown corner of the era’s radical political activism, which involved an underground network of women who risked life, limb, family and their freedom to help their fellow females have a say over their own bodies. Featuring interviews with former Janes — and the “doctor” who performed many of the procedures — it’s a history lesson that somehow avoids falling into a talking-heads-old-clips-rinse-repeat rut. These women were outlaws. They were also heroes, and it’s high time more people recognized them as such. This doc is a great start.\n\nJournalist and radio-show/podcast host Elvis Mitchell adds “filmmaker” to his resume with this look back at a 10-year period — from 1968 to 1978 — when Black cinema and filmmakers like Melvin Van Peebles completely changed the game. A host of talking heads (Harry Belafonte, Laurence Fishburne, Zendaya) and film clips give it the appearance of a standard history-lesson film doc. Except Mitchell has a knack for embedding a sense of memoir into the mix, and taking some interesting detours in connecting Hollywood’s “onscreen crushing of Black hope” to a revolutionary new moment of representation that came and went — but definitely left its mark. It’s the rare movie-mad documentary that makes the personal political, and vise versa. (Bonus viewing: Sidney, Reginald Hudlin’s equally wonderful biography on Sidney Poitier that covers some of the same ground from an entirely different perspective while paying tribute to an icon.)\n\nIn 2016, veteran Italian filmmaker Marco Bellocchio arranged for a large family gathering with all of his surviving elderly siblings. There was one noticeable absence that cast a shadow over the reunion: His twin brother Camillo, who took his own life in 1968. His passing had long haunted the family — particularly the filmmaker, whose career his brother envied. A sensitive yet unsparing excavation of an artist’s family history, this work from the world-cinema legend (had he only made 1965’s Fists in the Pocket, he’d still have earned his place in the canon) weaves in clips from his work and home movies to paint a picture of a personal tragedy. Yet it also chronicles how Marco and his kin truly begin to reckon with this loss and how these late-in-life conversations finally let their healing begin, decades after the fact.\n\nWhen Chris Smith (American Movie) approached Robert Downey Jr. with the idea of making a documentary about him, the star pitched a counter-offer: What about a film on my dad? Robert Downey Sr. was recognized as a key underground filmmaker in the 1960s and early ‘70s who’d broke through to what was then considered the mainstream before drugs, some bad decisions and the changing tides of Hollywood waylaid his career. As Smith and his crew began filming the older man, however, Sr.’s health began to decline — and Jr. started to let Smith & co. film their conversations as time runs out. A moving, intimate look at a father and a son both expressing their love for each other and letting go of long-harbored resentments, and a tribute to an artist from someone who picked up more than a few tricks from his pops. (Bonus viewing: Last Flight Home, in which DIG! filmmaker Ondi Timoner captures the final days of her 92-year-old dad as he chooses to die via the state of California’s End of Life Option.)\n\nIn the middle of New Delhi, there is a small clinic devoted to caring for black kites, the hawk-like birds of prey that call the city home. Run by brothers Muhammad Saud and Nadeem Shehzad, along with their friend Salik Rehman, in an underground garage, this sanctuary allows the wounded predators to heal before being released back into the skies. The trio does it out of a sense of respect for nature. But as Shaunak Sen’s free-flowing documentary ably demonstrates, there’s a spiritual element to what they do — an attempt to maintain a sense of balance between all creatures great and small in a vast urban jungle, even when sectarian violence hovers in the background. The rare film to win Best Documentary awards at both Sundance and Cannes, it’s the sort of lyrical nonfiction work that reminds you how activism can take many forms. Ditto kindness and compassion. (Bonus viewing: Invisible Demons, Rahul Jain’s city symphony in D minor that focuses on New Delhi’s pollution problem.)\n\nIn 1967, the U.S. military built a model town in Fort Belvoir, a base in Virginia, designed to train police officers and the National Guard on methods to deal with urban rioters. Uprisings were happening with more and more frequency in cities across the country, so the mock-chaos scenarios held in “Riotsville” would teach troops how to control crowds. It was viewed as such a success that a second fake town in Georgia was built. The mere existence of these places would be enough fodder for a documentary, but filmmaker Sierra Pettengill (The Reagan Show) uses the footage of the exercises as a jumping-off point to examine how the media covered these uprisings, the report on the phenomenon issued by the Johnson administration, and the way the ‘68 political conventions provided a real-life chance to test the military’s theories on actual citizens. Plus ça change.\n\nGiven the blessing of the David Bowie estate and full access to the late, great Thin White Duke’s archives, Brett Morgen could have easily made a standard cradle-to-grave biodoc, buffered with the occasional rare performance clip. Instead, he decided to do something a little bolder: drop moviegoers into something akin to Bowie’s stream of consciousness for over two hours. And on an IMAX-level canvas to boot! You still get to-die-for concert footage, old interviews, and a sense of how rock’s greatest chameleon changed musical styles — and pop music itself — several times over. But as with his Kurt Cobain documentary Montage of Heck, the director takes his cues from the subject himself, blending film clips, fine art, lowbrow sci-fi pulp, and a variety of musical and visual influences to tell the story of the man who fell to Earth and sold the world. (The backstory behind the end result is almost as cracked as the film itself.) You get the sense that if Bowie had ever gotten around to making an autobiography, it would have looked exactly like this.\n\nFor decades, everyone pointed to Joanne Woodard and Paul Newman as the ideal celebrity couple. She liked to knit. He liked to race cars. They made 16 films together. What people tend to ignore, however, was that they also harbored respective resentments over the other’s critical praise and careers, dealt with unflattering gossip, drank too much too often and fought a lot. Ethan Hawke’s extraordinary six-part documentary starts out as a rose-colored look at Old Hollywood royalty and ends up as a real-life Scenes From a Marriage starring actual movie stars — it somehow manages to burnish the mythology of this god-tier acting duo and tear it down at the same time. Even Hawke’s enlistment of actor buddies to read interview transcripts from an aborted Newman memoir quickly goes from gimmicky to graceful, as it gives voice to the highs and lows of screen icons in love. A great example of when not to just print the legend.\n\nLaura Poitras turns a portrait of an artist — photographer Nan Goldin — into a work of protest art, toggling between biography and chronicling how the “Ballad of Sexual Dependency” creator took on the Sackler family and forced art institutions to recognize that philanthropists can also be Big Pharma pushers. As with Poitras’ past looks at whistleblowers and disruptors (Citizenfour, Risk), there’s an erasing of the boundaries between the personal, the political and the ethical that enhances both the backstory (notably re: the influence of Nan’s sister Barbara) and Goldin’s back catalog. Some biodocs serve as victory laps or epitaphs. This one feels like a call to arms, soundtracked by shutter clicks.\n\nBay Area documentarian Sam Green (The Weather Underground) turns his lens on — and his boom mics toward — the subject of sound. Designed partially as an essay film and partially as one element of an immersive live event (though it works wonders either way you view it), this unique look into the role that audio, natural or manufactured, plays in our lives is more than just a deep dive into our great big sonic world. Yes, avant-garde musicians, archivists and experts weigh in on the science of it all. But the film also touches on sense memory, where a snippet of an old disco song can make an ex-pat think of home, or an old phone-message recording can remind someone of an immeasurable loss. And it dares to tackle the question: If a tree falls in the woods, does it really make a sound? The answer is yes, if you hire a professional Foley artist to recreate it. Playful, profound, and probably the only movie to ever turn a Moho braccatus’s mating call into something that could move you to tears.\n\nKatia and Maurice Krafft bonded over a common obsession: volcanoes. And by the time they’d married in 1970, this scientific duo had already started trotting the globe together to study these beautiful, violent ruptures in the earth whenever and wherever eruptions occurred. Constructed completely out of vintage 16mm footage — much of it shot by the couple themselves — filmmaker Sara Dosa’s valentine to the first couple of volcanology is not only Exhibit A regarding the notion that for every pot, there is a lid. It’s also a gorgeously rendered exploration of what Dosa herself has called “a love triangle” between two people and one natural phenomenon.\n\nAnd even if you know the ending of this story going in, Fire of Love never stoops to exploit the tragedy of their story. If anything, it’s a testament to how this duo obsessively followed their bliss, made all the more apparent by Miranda July’s oddly uplifting, lyrical narration. (The Me and You and Everyone We Know director’s voiceovers may initially push your anti-twee button, but the more the film winds through the Kraffts’ travelogues, the more her readings add to the overall big picture.) The couple were not idle thrill-seekers nor adrenaline junkies. The respect and awe they have for these forces of nature is part of the respect and awe they have for each other. Going in to this magma cum laude doc, it’s easy to think of the Kraftts as little more than self-destructive eccentrics. Spend 90 minutes with them, however, and you leave thinking of their journey as the greatest lava story ever told."
