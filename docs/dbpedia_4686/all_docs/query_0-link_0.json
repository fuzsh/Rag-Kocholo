        "text": "The Mating Call sub-series (1927-1929) is comprised of materials pertaining to the film's editing, legal, financial, production and direction, and story development records. Under director Lewis Milestone and producer Howard Hughes, The Mating Call was released on July 21, 1928 and starred Thomas Meighan, Renée Adorée, and Evelyn Brent. It was considered a lost film until 2016.\n\nEditing records include multiple censor requests. Legal records include agreements for Renée Adorée and Evelyn Brent, Rex Beach’s agreement for story rights, and supporting actor contracts. The financial records are reports of domestic and international revenues. The production and direction records contain black-and-white photographic prints and a negative depicting principal and supporting cast, interior and exterior sets, and publicity images, as well as a production report ledger. The story development records include a manuscript copy of the story, a production script, and cutting and dialogue continuities."
