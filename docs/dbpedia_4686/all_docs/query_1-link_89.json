        "text": "Winter is a season of extremes â from frosty mornings and snowy days to grey days of endless drizzle â it can be a tough time of year for us and our wildlife. With an overarching theme of Resilience and Renewal, Winterwatch will be shining a light on the wildlife and people who battle through this inhospitable season and come out the other side.\n\nBBC Winterwatch is keeping the UK connected to our native wildlife with four nights of live programmes. The series returns to BBC Two from Tuesday 16 January at 8pm for four nights, with nature notes from a raft of the BBC Natural History Unitâs finest wildlife presenters based across the country.\n\nOur weather is often unwelcoming and rarely encouraging but on Winterwatch weâre always determined to bring you the very best of British wildlife and on this series, weâll be bringing live wildlife from the heart of the UKâs first Super National Nature Reserve - RSPB Arne in Dorset - part of the Purbeck Heaths Super NNR.\n\nThe stories of this Winter will be revealed by presenters Chris Packham, Michaela Strachan and Iolo Williams live from RSPB Arne in Dorset for their first Winterwatch since 2017 whilst Gillian Burke has been at the other end of the UK, the Orkney Isles, to witness the fascinating wildlife that calls the islands home.\n\nThe series will also feature wildlife stories that showcase the diversity of our UK habitats and species, stories from passionate people who care for our wildlife and mindfulness moments filmed by the countryâs top wildlife camera operators.\n\nIn Dorset, Chris, Michaela and Iolo will be exploring a whole host of wildlife, both near to them in the south of England and also stories from further afield in the UK.\n\nWinter is anything but a slow time of year at RSPB Arne. Badgers will still be busying themselves around their setts whilst Arneâs Sika Deer will be recovering from their Autumn rut exertions.\n\nWith our carcass cameras, we hope to see the areaâs resident pair of White-tailed Eagles and get intimate views of these spectacular birds. A winter feast such as this is unlikely to go unnoticed by other opportunistic scavengers, with Ravens and Foxes very likely to make an appearance too.\n\nWeâll have cameras based on Brownsea Island to check in on its population of Red Squirrels, whilst the surrounding Poole Harbour is an important overwintering site for thousands of wading birds that gather to feed on the invertebrate-rich tidal zones. Hundreds of Avocet form mesmerising monochrome flocks with a diverse supporting cast of other species such as Redshank, Lapwing, Spoonbills, Egrets and Divers. The area is also a hub for raptor species. As well as the eagles, thereâs the chance to see Hen Harriers, Short-eared Owls, Goshawks, Marsh Harriers, Peregrines, Merlins and many more!\n\nLucy Lapwing will also be back in the macro studio showing Michaela Strachan some of the fascinating bugs that battle through the season.\n\nCH\n\nQ&A with Chris Packham\n\nWhat can we look forward to this series on Winterwatch?\n\nThere's always this lingering misconception that winter is a time of death and decay, where everything has hibernated or migrated, and it couldn't be further from the truth, there's always an enormous amount of activity. Practically, there are no leaves on the trees. It makes it easier to see some species. We get an enormous influx of waders and waterfowl from further north in Europe. Poole Harbour, Brownsea Lagoon, and the estuary areas around Arne itself will be filled full of those migrant birds. We probably won't see some species which 20 years ago, 30, 40 years ago would have been quite common in that area because it would have been much colder further north in Europe, but it isn't this year. So that will that will have an impact. So we'll be able to discuss that as well.\n\nWhat are your best wildlife spotting tips this Winter?\n\nCheck the tide make sure that itâs on its way out. If you turn up at high tide it's not going to be quite as much fun. Also don't think that you've got a short working day, because there's lots of activity at night. My tawny owls are going berserk at the moment in the garden as soon as it gets dark. Birdfeeders will be at their busiest at that time of year so make sure you keep your feeder topped up, but also clean, really important to say that, given the diseases that are going around with birds at the moment. So clean them out at least once a week.\n\nWhat are your favourite places to spot wildlife and why?\n\nThe first one I'd say is sat where I am now looking out my window at the bird feeder in my own garden. I'm helping them along by putting some food in there to give those goldfinches happy. I think wildlife close to homes is really important. I've got camera traps up to put out in my garden and I get a badger that comes through which is really nice to see. I've never seen the animal once in real life but I see it in my camera trap and it gives me a nice warm feeling knowing that it eats some of the food that I put our for it down at the end of the garden.\n\nWhat can viewers do in their garden to support wildlife?\n\nIf you're doing gardening and you're cutting things down, don't burn it, compost it. If you've got thistles, if you've got teasels, those are good bird food stores for the winter. Leave those up until the spring until those goldfinches have exhausted them. I've always said keep the feeders filled up, keep them clean. Putting food out for mammals is equally as important if itâs appropriate to do so. Don't do it where they associate that food with humans. This is also the time of year to put bird boxes up.\n\nWhat wildlife are your favourites to catch a glimpse of in Winter?\n\nI like the foxes because they are widespread, beautiful, successful. I saw one earlier this week when I was out in the woods. It's always a treat to see a fox dashing through that sort of crumbling, rusty bracken. I've really got a thing about tawney owls, they've grown on me over the years because I've been lucky enough to live in a couple places where they've been really close to the house so I get to go see. And then I suppose the taste of the exotic, there are plenty of waxwings in the country at the moment. These are birds that come from Scandinavia and they come some years in greater numbers than others and this appears to be quite a good year for them.\n\nQ&A with Gillian Burke\n\nWhat can we look forward to this series on Winterwatch?\n\nThe chance to see Orkney's wildlife. The archipelago sitting at the top of Scotland is one of the UK's best wildlife spots where spotting birds of prey, seals, dolphins, whales, the marine megafauna, is an everyday occurrence.\n\nWhat are your best wildlife spotting tips this Winter?\n\nGet outside! Wrap up warm and definitely plan ahead (a flask of something hot is nice to have) but don't let the weather put you off.\n\nWhat are your favourite places to spot wildlife and why?\n\nMy local patch and coastline in Cornwall because I've gotten to know little details over the years. I love seeing how it changes over the seasons and from one day to the next. I especially love looking out for a kingfisher that hunts at low tide along a stretch of exposed rocky reef. It only shows up here in the winter, presumably when inland streams are running fast after heavy rains and winter storms.\n\nWhat can viewers do in their garden to support wildlife?\n\nBe an untidy gardener. Wildlife loves the messy tangles of woodpiles, cuttings and an overgrown hedge. If you really struggle to 'let it all go', then at least try and leave one small corner or border to look after itself.\n\nWhat wildlife are your favourites to catch a glimpse of in Winter?\n\nThe kingfisher.\n\nQ&A with Iolo Williams\n\nWhat can we look forward to this series on Winterwatch?\n\nThis series we can look forward to seeing Arne at its brilliant, best. Winter in and around Arne is a fantastic time. Some of the summer highlights are not there, the nightjars have gone back down to Africa. A lot of the reptiles will have disappeared underground into hibernation. But the shallow lagoons and the harbour there just comes into its own now because it'll be alive with thousands of waders and wildfowl. And that's what I'm looking forward to seeing more than anything else.\n\nWhat are your best wildlife spotting tips this Winter?\n\nMy best one, if spotting, is this one simple tip I would give to everyone. Get up off your backside and get out because you're going to see nothing sitting on the sofa in front of the fire. The local woodlands, into your garden, into the park, to the river, to the estuary, doesn't matter where you go, just get up and go out.\n\nWhat are your favourite places to spot wildlife and why?\n\nI love it in my garden because I put out food for the birds. So I see a lot that I don't really see in spring, summer and early autumn. But for me, for the real winter highlights, you have to head to the coast and I really enjoy going to places in Wales like the Dee Estuary, thousands of birds are there over the winter, so if it was up to me I would tell people to head for the estuaries.\n\nWhat can viewers do in their garden to support wildlife?\n\nLoads and loads. If everybody did something it would make a massive difference. You could start by digging a pond. Doesn't have to be a big pond, you don't have to dig it, you could even turn over a bin top. You can create a hedge or plant some native trees, preferably something like holly or a bit of ivy, which is evergreen and provides shelter and food all year round for not just birds but for small mammals, for invertebrates, for pollinators as well. You can put up bee boxes, you can put up nest boxes, you can create little piles of brash, little piles of branches, twigs, leaves, used by all kinds of invertebrates, by frogs, toads, newts, slugs, snails and hedgehogs. You can leave small sections of your lawn, or all of your lawn if you want to, turn it into a meadow, that is absolutely brilliant. I've done that for the last five years. So you can do all of those things and so much more as well.\n\nWhat wildlife are your favourites to catch a glimpse of in Winter?\n\nThis winter in particular I would urge people to get out and see their local waxwings. These are visitors, scarce visitors, very rare most years, that come down from Scandinavia. This winter happens to be a really good winter for them. They're colourful, they're noisy, they're berry eating. So get out and look for your local waxwings.\n\nQ&A with Michaela Strachan\n\nWhat can we look forward to this series on Winterwatch?\n\nThe theme of Winterwatch is resilience and renewal. In the Winter wildlife needs to be resilient to get through the colder, leaner months. Only the tough survive. Then Spring brings warmth, respite and renewal.\n\n2023 has been a tough year for people too. Many people are still recovering from the trauma of covid and now there is so much more trauma and stress to cope with. Two wars playing out in real time on the news. We're all witnessing so much heartbreak, so much sadness, trauma and horror. We're also experiencing a huge amount of anxiety including eco anxiety. I hope Winterwatch will bring people some joy, a programme to look forward to. Of course the Natural World is suffering hugely, but hopefully we can showcase the beauty of winter, celebrate our wildlife, soak up the extraordinary survival techniques of the natural world and in some ways learn from it. We always hope to inspire and to bring some warmth and humour to people's living rooms!\n\nWhat are your best wildlife spotting tips this Winter?\n\nThe best tip I can give, is to spend time outdoors! I know that sounds obvious, but Winter is a time where people tend to hibernate. But if you get the right gear on, wrap up warm and make the effort to go out into the natural world, you will be rewarded. Do a bit of research, find out where to go to see some fab wildlife, especially all the great winter spectacles. Starling murmurations are such a treat to see, a spectacular aerial ballet. Winter flocks of noisy pink footed geese are always a memorable sight, and if you're looking for cute, grey seals pup in the winter and are fabulous to see. Personally I love just walking in a wood on a crisp winter day, searching for fungi and appreciating the beauty, the colours and the structure.\n\nWhat are your favourite places to spot wildlife and why?\n\nFirst choice is a back garden. Sitting with a cuppa watching the birds that come to a garden bird feeder. It's such a simple, accessible, wildlife pleasure. Further afield, a visit to one of the grey seal colonies is well worth the effort. It's a sensation for many of your senses! It's noisy, smelly and visual. The newborn pups are incredibly cute and the interactions between all the individuals can be mesmerising.\n\nWhat can viewers do in their garden to support wildlife?\n\nIn Winter the most important thing to do for wildlife is to provide food and water. Winter is such a tough season and food is hard to find, so any supplementing you can do, is going to be vital.\n\nWhat wildlife are your favourites to catch a glimpse of in Winter?\n\nI love whatever the season brings, barn owls, badgers, beavers, red squirrels, red deer, red shank! I also love focussing on the unexpected. We'll be bringing our macro studio back for Winterwatch, showcasing creatures that are so often overlooked and underappreciated. Last winter I fell in love with earwigs! Who would've thought? But when you look at them in close up, they are actually quite beautiful with absolutely stunning wings.\n\nThe females are surprising super mums. In winter they are busy tending to dozens of little bright yellow eggs, diligently turning them and cleaning them. Câmon, what's not to love!\n\nOrkney Isles\n\nGillian Burke will travel to the upper reaches of the British Isles â the breath-taking Orkney Isles. The archipelago is made up of around 70 islands and is home to some of our rarest and most spectacular wildlife.\n\nThe islands are one of the most dramatic places in the UK in the winter. With its wild location and Atlantic position, the wildlife and landscapes in this exposed set of islands is unique. Whales and orca patrol the seas while seals haul out on the beaches and rocks. Otters make the lochs and beaches their homes which they share with the myriad of birdlife.\n\nThere will be at least one film from Gillian on Orkney every night of the series.\n\nShe meets up with local artist and PhD student, Anne Bignall. After living on the islands for a decade, in 2014 Anne decided she wanted to know more about the otter population on the Orkneys, so she started experimenting with trail cameras. After successfully capturing an otter family on film, she was sold and her interest into these sometime elusive mammals grew and grew. Now she knows a lot more about the best places to see otters without disturbing them and takes Gillian to some of her favourite spots.\n\nOrkney is one of the best places in the UK to spot whales, dolphins and porpoises so Gillian teams up with Emma Neave-Webb from Orkney Marine Mammal Research Institute. Gillian heads out on a boat with Emma to explore the seas around Orkney hoping to survey porpoises but what she actually sees is something MUCH bigger. Only a few minutes into their trip into Scapa Flow and they see a group of gulls tracking something in the water â itâs a pod of Killer whales or Orca. The whales are looking for grey seals to predate and itâs not long before they get lucky. With their bellies full, the whales are ready to play, and Gillian experiences one of the most amazing wildlife encounters of her life!\n\nThe birdlife on Orkney is second to none. The resident population is joined every year by thousands and thousands of birds on their migratory journeys. Gillian meets Sarah Sankey from the RSPB to talk all things avian and why the islands are such a haven for species such as shrike, stone chats, sanderlings and many more.\n\nHeard of the Orkney vole? Neither had Gillian but she meets up with Adam Hough a landscape gardener who frequently sees them in his garden. Theyâre found nowhere else in the world and are thought to be a subspecies of the common vole which has developed over thousands of years. Theyâre elusive but Adam has a trick to tempting them out â an apple core!\n\nPre-filmed Stories\n\nAs ever, Winterwatch have produced a number of pre-recorded films covering the length and breadth of the country, bringing geographical diversity as well as a wide variety of animal, scientific and cultural stories.\n\nPeter Lau â Leeds photographer\n\nPeter Lau worked in the fire service in West Yorkshire for 25 years. In his adventurous spare time, he enjoyed mountain biking scuba diving, kayaking and hiking but in 2014 he had a terrible mountain bike accident which left him paralysed.\n\nHe hit a very low point in his life until his wife Debbie bought him a camera. It ignited a huge passion in Peter for wildlife photography but he soon discovered that, as a wheelchair user, accessing reserves to capture wildlife on film was an additional challenge. So heâs worked with a number of organisations to make reserves more accessible for people like him, keen to explore the natural world and experience all the benefits it brings.\n\nFern Lifecycle â Chris Packham\n\nFerns are ancient plants whose ancestors first appeared on Earth over 300 million years ago. They were around long before the dinosaurs. But the remarkable way they reproduce has remained unchanged in all that time. Chris Packham heads to Lydford Gorge in Devon â home to an astonishing variety of ferns, mosses and lichens. In this lush and ancient forest, laced with waterfalls and lagoons he reveals that the fern lifecycle involves two distinct plants â the adult fern and the tiny gametophyte â a single layer of glistening cells. These mini plants produce sperm â that swims! Right into the female parts of the plant, fertilising an actual egg. This triggers the growth of a new fern. For such an ancient plant, itâs all very â¦ human.\n\nShetland Otters\n\nShetlandâs wild islands are teeming with otters. Thereâs a higher density found here than anywhere else in Europe. But they have to be bold to take advantage of everything the archipelago has to offer. Unlike otters in mainland UK, which are normally nocturnal, Shetland otters are most active in the daytime. We meet a mother and cub grooming and playing in the wide open of a grassy clifftop. Itâs not long before they need to feed, but in Shetland these river otters donât actually feed in rivers â they hunt in the ocean. No mean feat â these seas are wild. But theyâre also full of fish. Itâs a bounty that attracts another family â a mother and two younger cubs. After shoring up their cliffside holt with seaweed, they all head out to hunt, though its mum that does most of the legwork! Working hard to feed them around 1kg of fish every day. After a good clean to keep their fur in tip top condition, they settle down, soothed to sleep by the sound of the sea.\n\nGoldeneye\n\nIn the Cairngorms in Scotland, winter is in full swing and everything is covered in a thick blanket of snow. Apart from the lochs. They are alive with a kaleidoscope of wildfowl, dressed in their finest plumage. Mallards and Shoveler scour the surface for food â vegetation and invertebrates. Wigeon graze weed. But one especially dashing duck stands out from the crowd. The Goldeneye. With its black and white plumage and striking amber eye, it also has a different way of feeding. Diving down to the bottom of the loch to find molluscs and small fish. But food isnât the only thing on this maleâs mind. With nesting season just around the corner, he out to attract a female. So he presents his very best moves â in a courtship display that resembles a series of dance moves. If he can impress her enough, heâll have a partner secured for the whole of the springtime ahead. All in the shake of a tailfeather!\n\nCurled Octopus\n\nIt might be the depths of winter, but while the land freezes, in our coastal shallows temperatures are a little kinder â¦ and rather than hunkering down for the season, life for many marine species is business as usual. Shore crabs are busy jostling for scraps. With a set of fearsome pincers they wrestle with pieces of rotting fish. Little do they know that danger is lurking right next to them. A curled octopus, perfectly camouflaged against some rocks is awaiting the perfect time to strike. This is the most intelligent invertebrate in the world. And a fearsome ambush predator. It waits for a crab to come closer â and then it pounces. Enveloping the crab in its tentacles it injects it with poison, melting the crabs muscles before prising away the shell. A grisly end for the crab â but a hearty meal for our octo. And it needs the sustenance â only 1% of the 200,000 eggs an adult curled octopus will lay will survive into adulthood.\n\nThe Horrid Ground-Weaver Spider\n\nIn the corner of an industrial site in the heart of the city of Plymouth in Devon, one of the worldâs rarest spiders makes its home. Found only in a few sites in Plymouth, the horrid ground weaver is just 3mm big and is specialised to the limestone that runs through this part of the UK. But with so much development theyâve found themselves pushed to the fringes of places like this. Horrid comes from its latin name and means âbristlesâ â this male, though hairy is really quite romantic. This is his busiest season, not only does he have to find food and avoid larger predators (like centipedes) â he also needs to find a mate. But beware â if the female mistakes him for prey, sheâll eat him. The male delicately approaches, trembling her web as he goes. It does the trick and she accepts him â theyâll now share a web all winter. After mating sheâll need to feed up before laying her eggs, ready for a new generation of this very special spider in Spring.\n\nWinterwatch Digital\n\nThe Winterwatch digital team will be providing a wealth of exciting extra content to complement the BBC Two programmes.\n\nWe'll be bringing you stories from the UK's wild places, right into your living rooms.
