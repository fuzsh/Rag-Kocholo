Lawrence.\n\nLast revised 3 July 2017.\n\nNo copyright is asserted for NASA photographs. If a recognizable person appears in a photo, use for commercial purposes may infringe a right of privacy or publicity. Photos may not be used to state or imply the endorsement by NASA or by any NASA employee of a commercial product, process or service, or used in any other manner that might mislead. Accordingly, it is requested that if a NASA photograph is used in advertising and other commercial promotion, layout and copy be submitted to NASA prior to release.\n\nNASA photos reproduced from this archive should include photo credit to \"NASA\" or \"National Aeronautics and Space Administration\" and should include scanning credit to the appropriate individuals or agencies as noted in the captions.\n\nWe have begun adding scans of the original film. These scans are being done by NASA Johnson, with some post-processing by Kipp Teague. The film is scanned at 4096 x 4096 pixels per image. (See a discussion from Arizona State University about the scanning process.) Kipp reduces each digital image to approximately 2350 x 2350 pixels (equivalent to 300 dpi) and does minor adjustments of levels to ensure that (1) brightly lit areas of lunar soil are neutral grey, (2) objects with known colors (such as the CDR stripes or the LCRU blankets) look right, and (3) information in bright or dark areas is not lost. These images from original film are indicated by the notation 'OF300' in the image description. In each case, a 900 x 900 pixel version is also provided.\n\nAnaglyphs in the image libraries created from sequential panorama frames by the ALSJ editor exist only because of Yuri Krasilnikov's willingness to teach me the art. Whatever value the anaglyphs have is due to Yuri's insights and guidance. Flaws are my doing. Briefly, panorama stitching software Hugin is used to create both non-stereo pan assemblies and remapped versions of the images. The latter are then made into anaglyphs using GIMP. The individual remapped images are linked from the corresponding Library entries for the original frames. The remapped images can be used to create stereo views using other methods.\n\nJournal Contributor Paul White has made detailed comparisons of cloud patterns seen in a large number of Apollo images with imagery taken at close to the same time by various meteorlogical satellites.\n\nFor those interested in the subject of Apollo Photography and the Color of the Moon, see a brief discussion written for the ALSJ by Michael Light.\n\nThis Apollo 12 Image Library contains all of the pictures taken on the lunar surface by the astronauts together with pictures from pre-flight training and pictures of equipment and the flight hardware. High-resolution version of many of the lunar surface images are included. A source for both thumbnail and low -resolution versions of the lunar surface images is a website compiled by Paul Spudis and colleagues at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston.\n\nJournal Contributor Paul White has made detailed comparisons of cloud patterns seen in a large number of Apollo images with imagery taken at close to the same time by various meteorlogical satellites.\n\nSections:\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Images\n\nApproach Views and Lunar Orbiter Photos\n\nLanding Site Maps/Images\n\nPlanimetric Maps\n\nSurveyor III Images\n\nAssembled Panoramas\n\nCrew and Equipment Pre-Flight\n\nVehicle Assembly, Transport, and Checkout on the Launch Pad\n\nSaturn V Launch\n\nMission Support Photos\n\nMission Photos by Magazine Number\n\nMagazine 46/Y (Color) EVA-1\n\nMagazine 47/V (Color) EVA-1\n\nMagazine 48/X (B&W) EVA-2\n\nMagazine 49/Z (B&W) EVA-2\n\nMagazine 50/Q (Color) TLC and Rev 3\n\nMagazine 51/R (Color) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 52/S (B&W) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 54/T (B&W) Lunar Orbit\n\nMagazine 55/EE (B&W) Lunar Orbit/TEC\n\nMagazine 57/ (B&W) ALSCC\n\nRecovery and Post-Flight Photos\n\nSamples\n\nMIscellaneous Images\n\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Images\n\nOriginal LROC image courtesy NASA/GSFC/ASU.

(3.4 Mb)\n\nWith the Sun close to the zenith the range of brightness in the field-of-view is narrow. The disturbed areas near the LM and Surveyor III are the darkest portions of the image but, up close, would not appear as dark as they seem to be in the image. A labeled detail shows the LM and ALSEP. Note that portions of the ribbon cables connecting the SIDE/CCIG and LSM to the Central Station are quite bright. The shiny, surface of the cables is a good sunlight reflector so that, with the Sun and the spacecraft both virtually at the zenith, those portions of the cable which are lying flat on the surface are bright. Pete's photo AS12-46-6820 shows the SIDE/CCIG cable running off to the right. Although the cable clearly has up/down 'waves', it doesn't appear to be twisted.

Late in EVA-1, Pete and Al ran out to the rim of Middle Crescent Crater, where Pete took a pair of partial pans showing the crater. A variety of craters and boulders in the crater are identified in a comparison ( 5.1 Mb ) between Pete's first pan and the 29 Nov 2009 LROC image.\n\nDeconvolved, 0.25 m/pixel (3.1 Mb TIF) and 0.5 m/pixel (3.4 Mb TIF) versions by GoneToPlaid.\n\n09 January 2010 04:27:29 UTC; Solar El/Az 9.3/270.5; LRO altitude 43.1 km; resolution 0.49m/pixel ( 8.4 Mb )\n\nThe raw image is M117650516R.

Images of the Apollo 12 site were obtained on two successive LRO orbits on this date. A comparison between details of the LM/ALSEP area show a number of differences in the appearance of specific features near the LM and at the ALSEP site. Some may be due to differences in viewing angles and solar elevation. Others may be due to imaging anomalies. No processing has been done to the screen grabs (done in Mid-August 2010) other than cropping.\n\nDeconvolved, 0.25 m/pixel (12 Mb TIF); deconvolved/gamma-corrected 0.25 m/pixel (15 Mb TIF); deconvolved 0.5 m/pixel (3.0 Mb TIF) and deconvolved/gamma-corrected 0.5 m (4.1 Mb TIF) versions by GoneToPlaid.\n\n01 April 2010 02:35:56 UTC; Solar El/Az 84.7/25.6; LRO altitude 44.3 km; resolution 0.45 m/pixel (width) and 0.55 m/pixel (height)\n\nThe raw image is M124728623L.

Original LROC images by NASA/GSFC/ASU.\n\nApproach Views and Lunar Orbiter Images\n\nApollo Zone of Interest ( 2.1Mb or 0.4Mb )\n\nThis later map shows five regions, each of which contains one of the five possible Apollo Landing Sites considered for the first landings. These sites were numbered, from east to west, ALS-1 to ALS-5. The sites initially considered for Apollo 12 were ALS-4 and ALS-5, which are in IIIP-11 and IIP-13, respectively. Don Wilhelms's book, To a Rocky Moon, contains a wealth of information about site selection. Data from the first three Lunar Orbiter missions are discussed in pages 150-161; and selection of the Apollo 12 site is discussed in pages 213-217. A labelled version shows the actual Apollo 12 site.\n\nLunar Orbiter View of the Landing Ellipse (S69-57076) ( 2.1 Mb or 0.4 Mb )\n\nComposite of Lunar Orbiter III strips showing the prime Apollo 12 lunar landing site. The landing ellipse is 7.2 nautical miles by 2.6 nautical miles. The coordinates of the ellipse center are 2 degrees 56 minutes 33 seconds (2.943 degrees) south latitude and 23 degrees 26 minutes 36 seconds (23.443 degrees) west longitude, and the elevation is 1,735,900 meters. Scan courtesy of David Harland.\n\nLunar Orbiter View of the Landing Site ( 0.5Mb or 87k )\n\nThis photo is made up of Lunar Orbiter III strips showing the prime Apollo 12 lunar landing site. Scan by John Pfannerstill. Note that the small white crosses are reference marks. This photo was taken prior to the Surveyor III landing. The pattern of craters surrounding the landing site came to be known as the Snowman and the origin of the name is most easily seen in this detail of a site map prepared by geologists at the US Geological Survey in Flagstaff. The white circles surrounding the craters denote the geologists' estimates of the extent of the ejecta blankets and it is those circles that show the Snowman most clearly and, indeed, may have suggested the name.\n\nLunar Orbiter View of the Landing Site (detail) ( 0.5Mb )\n\nThis detail shows head Crater and the larger of the two soil mounds found by the crew on the north rim. Scan by John Pfannerstill. AS12-46- 6793 is a surface-level photo of the mound.\n\nApproach View\n\nFigure 4-9 from the Apollo 12 Mission Report shows the approach view (top) used in training. Head Crater is the large crater just below the top of the frame and Surveyor Crater is the larger crater just below it. Note that this view overemphasizes the apparent depth of the crater below and slightly to the left of Surveyor Crater. The photograph at bottom right is a frame of 16-mm film shot through Al's LM window during the approach. The sketch at the bottom right includes an outline of the Snowman. The large crater beyond and to the right of the Snowman is Middle Crescent Crater, which Pete and Al will visit at the end of EVA-1.\n\nSurveyor Crater Contour Map ( 1.1Mb )\n\nThis contour map is reproduced on page 49 in NASA SP-184, Surveyor Program Results, published in 1969. An explanation of the map can be found on a scan of the entire page ( 0.3Mb or 21Mb ). This map was undoubtedly used in planning the EVA-2 entry into the crater and in properly tilting the Surveyor mock-up used in training. Scans courtesy Mary Ann Hagar, Lunar and Planetary Institute.\n\nDescartes Landing Site\n\nThis mosaic of Lunar Orbiter strips shows the approach to the Descartes landing site, which Dick Gordon photographed during Apollo 12 orbital operations. John Young and Charlie Duke landed at this site on Apollo 16 and such prominent landmarks as Stone Mountain and the white South Ray ejecta blanket can be seen on the left side of the partial circle drawn around the Descartes site. About 14 minutes prior to the Apollo 12 Powered Descent Initiation (PDI) Pete noted that he was flying over some high mountains and Houston replied that he was probably crossing the very large crater Theophilus, which is at the lower left in the this mosaic at about 27E 11S.\n\nApollo Landing Site 5\n\nPete and Al trained for a landing at this western site prior to the selection of the Surveyor III site for their landing. Frank O'Brien has provided an approach map (1090k) and a map showing the landing ellipse (821k) for ALS 5. See the discussion at 113:03:55.\n\nTargets of Opportunity\n\nThis map ( 2348k ) shows CSM ground tracks and various photographic targets. There is a legend at the upper right. Scan by Frank O'Brien.\n\nCSM Ground Track for Revolutions 1, 18, 19, 38, 39, 45\n\nThis map ( 1358k ) shows CSM ground tracks for the first orbit after Lunar Orbit insertion (Rev 1), for the landing (Revs 18 and 19), for LM liftoff and rendezvous (Revs 38 and 39) and for TransEarth Injection (45). Scan by Frank O'Brien.\n\nLanding Site Maps/Images\n\nRed-Blue Anaglyph from LROC images ((0.7 MB)\n\nAnaglyph by Patrick Vantuyne.\n\nSeptember 2011 Traverse Map (1.9 Mb)\n\nThomas Schwagmeier and Eric Jones have created a detailed traverse map derived from LROC low-periapse image M168353795R (released 6 September 2011) and traverse details extracted from the Journal Text. See, also, a version with the traverses drawn on the LRO image, and an animated version.\n\nThe Snowman in Rome 0.3 Mb PDF\n\nSchwagmeier and Jones have superimposed the Apollo 12 traverse map with a simplified map of Rome, with Surveyor Crater coinciding with the Colosseum. We have also done a superposition of the traverse map with a map of the Vatican. See, also individual JPEG versions of the Rome (2.4 Mb) and Vatican (1.2 Mb) comparisons.\n\nLM Lunar Surface Maps\n\nThis large set of maps includes a view of the landing ellipse and its surroundings at 1:100,000, three 1:25,000 maps covering just the ellipse, and a large set 1:5000 maps of much the same area. Some of the maps, particularly around the landing site, have geologic features marked. Four maps show traverses laid out for landings at four different locations around Surveyor Crater.\n\n69-H-1549\n\nThis September 1969 diagram shows a preliminary landing spot northeast of the Snowman's left foot and about 250 feet (75 meters) east of Landing Point 1 of later maps. Compare with LSE 7-F. Scan by Frederic Artner.\n\nThe following maps were produced for use by the crew while on the lunar surface. The coordinate system helped them discuss locations with Houston. Note that various traverse routes, dependent on four possible landing locations, are sketched on some of the maps. Houston and the crew planned the actual traverses around these designs once they knew where Intrepid had touched down.\n\nLAM 7 ( 3.0 Mb or 0.4 Mb )\n\nThis 1:100,000 scale map shows an area of about 25 x 20 kilometers centered on the center of the landing ellipse. Each of the small squares is 1 km across.\n\nLSE 7-F ( 0.3 Mb )\n\nThis 1:5000 composite is made from portions of LSE 7-6g and LSE7-7g and shows four possible traverses laid out around Surveyor Crater based on landings at Points 1, 2, 3 and 4.\n\nLSE 7-6G Site 4 and Post-EVA-1 Plan ( 3.2 Mb or 0.4 Mb )\n\nThis 1:5000 map shows the traverse planned for a landing at Site 4, just to the west of Sharp crater and the post-landing traverse plan drawn in by hand in dark ink. The collection of maps from which this image was scanned is marked - probably with a felt-tipped pen - 'PAO' - and may well have been marked shortly before, or even during, the time Ed Gibson was describing the traverse plan to the crew at 121:18:14 or, in more detail, at 129:38:43.\n\nLSE 7-6G and How the Snowman Got His Name (515k)\n\nThe Snowman is the cluster of craters that surrounds their target point. It can be seen slightly left of center on a large-scale map of the landing site. Surveyor Crater is centered at about N.3/29.5 and Head Crater - the Snowman's head - is immediately to the right of Surveyor Crater at N.4/28.6. The Snowman's feet are at N.4/30.7 and M.4/30.7. See, also, a version of LROC image M120005333R labeled by Thomas Schwagmeier.\n\nI have never been impressed that this pattern was easily called the Snowman until, late in 1999, I was looking at one of the USGS site maps covering the immediate area around Surveyor Crater and really saw the Snowman for the first time. The key to success was to look at LSE-7-6G with west at the top and to look, not at the craters, but at the white ejecta circles drawn around them by the geologists who prepared the map. As can readily be seen in a detail, the ejecta circles create a striking Snowman image. Although I can easily imagine Pete Conrad spotting the figure the first time he was shown the map, I have not been able to confirm this conjecture and do not yet know exactly how or when the Snowman got its name. Note that the Snowman's Right foot is labeled \"Right Foot\"\n\nLSE 7-30 ( 2.4 Mb or 0.3 Mb)\n\nThis map section shows a large crater which is 500 meters in diameter and is 4.5 kilometers west of the Apollo 12 landing spot. The grid spacing is 50 meters and the large rock on the northeast crater rim is 20 meters across.\n\nLSE 7-31 ( 2.1 Mb or 0.3 Mb)\n\nThis map section shows the area northeast of the 500-m crater.\n\nLSE 7-38 ( 1.9 Mb or 0.3 Mb)\n\nThis map section shows the area northwest of the 500-m crater.\n\nLSE 7-39 ( 2.2 Mb or 0.4 Mb )\n\nThis map section shows the area southwest of the 500-m crater.\n\nLSE 7-6G -annotated for Site 2 landing ( 315k )\n\nThis map section shows the immediate area around the Apollo 12 landing site. Pete landed the LM near map coordinates Q-5/15.2. This map shows the traverse planned for a landing at Point 2 south-southeast of the center of the crater. Note that Head Crater is labeled \"Head\". Similar labeling of the Snowman's right foot indicates that crater is Right Foot Crater.\n\nLSE 7-6G - annotated for Site 4 landing ( 313k )\n\nThis map shows the traverse planned for a landing near Sharp Crater at Point 4, which is at map coordinates K-0/7.0. The actual traverse has been sketched in, probably by someone in Mission Control during the mission, and was an adaptation of the Site 4 traverse.\n\nLSE 7-7G - annotated for Site 1 landing( 333k )\n\nThis map shows the traverse that was planned for a landing near Site 1 at map coordinates A-5/18.5, which is north of Surveyor Crater. Note that the ejecta blanket surrounding Left Foot Crater is labelled.\n\nLSM 7-A ( 0.4 Mb or 2.2 Mb )\n\nThis large-scale map shows the area west of the planned Apollo 12 landing site. The large crater at the intersection of areas 30, 31, 38 and 39 is 500 meters in diameter and 4.5 km west of the actual landing site. The grid squares are 250 meters across.\n\nLSM 7-B ( 0.5 Mb )\n\nThis large-scale map shows the area around the planned landing site. The left foot of the Snowman is just below the numeral \"6\" and Surveyor Crater is above and slightly to the right of center in area 6.\n\n1991Traverses ( 0.7 Mb )\n\nThis map is figure 10.15 from the Lunar Sourcebook, G.H. Heiken, D.T. Vaniman and B.M. French, editors, copyright 1991 by Cambridge University Press, reproduced with permission. The traverses shown on this map were deduced from Hasselblad pictures taken by the crew and from their commentary. NASA photo S69-59538 is another representation of the traverse.\n\nPlanimetric Maps\n\nThis section includes planimetric maps created by Brian McInall in 2014-7 from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera photos and re-examination of the Hasselblad images.\n\nEVA-1 Activities prior to ALSEP Deployment, Planimetric Map 2017 (3 Mb)\n\nMap by Brian McInall.\n\nEVA-1 ALSEP Deployment and Middle Crescent Traverse, Planimetric Map 2017 (11 Mb)\n\nMap by Brian McInall.\n\nEVA-1 Closeout Activities, Planimetric Map 2017 (3 Mb)\n\nMap by Brian McInall.\n\nEVA-2 Traverse to Head Crater and Head Crater Activities, Planimetric Map 2017(8 Mb)\n\nMap by Brian McInall.\n\nEVA-2 Bench and Sharp Craters Activities, Planimetric Map 2017(6 Mb)\n\nMap by Brian McInall.\n\nSurveyor III Images\n\nContour Map of Surveyor Crater (175k)\n\nApollo 12 ground track during the landing (101k)\n\nSurveyor III scoop marks (142k)\n\nSurveyor III Photo Mosaic ( 1 Mb or 76 Mb )\n\nThis mosaic of Surveyor III pictures shows Block Crater just below the rim of Surveyor Crater to the right of center. Scan courtesy Stephen Tellier, LPI. Compare with Al Bean's photos AS12-48-7090 and 7094, which show the relationship of Surveyor III, Block Crater and the LM. Ewan Whitaker compared the positions of large blocks this imagery with block locations seen in Lunar Orbiter imagery to identify the crater that Surveyor III landed in.\n\nAssembled Panoramas\n\n111:58:43 Pre-EVA-1 Window Pan ( 0.1 Mb )\n\nPete and Al took the frames of this 'pan' out the windows, which means that the righthand and lefthand portions show views from points seperated by a few feet and, necessarily, that the central portions have to be force into a 'fit'. Note that the LM shadow is well to the left of the spacecraft centerline. That is, the shadow is left of a point midway between the left and right clusters of thrusters. The frames are AS12-48- 7023 to 7033. Pan assembled by Dave Byrne.\n\nHigh-resolution assemblies of the CDR ( 6 Mb ) and LMP ( 9 Mb ) window pans by Eric Jones. Details from 7024 and 7026 show that the bright spot in the center of the shadow at about the boundary between the ascent and descent stage shadows is a patch of lunar surface - including a small rock and small crater - illuminated by sunlight shining through a path between the stages. The path is almost certainly next to the ascent engine bell on the south side.\n\n116:22:29 Pete's 12 O'clock LM Pan ( 890k )\n\nPete took this pan early in EVA-1 from a position due west of the LM. As Pete mentions at 118:27:12, he mistakenly took this pan at 15-foot focus instead of 74-foot focus. Al can be seen in several frames taking documentation photos of the Solar Wind Collector (SWC) that he has just deployed. The frames are AS12-46- 6730 to 6745.

Two of the frames show Al carrying the ALSEP packages out from the LM. the assembly linked immediately above uses the first of the two frames showing Al. Note that, not surprisingly, Al's shadow in the frame the includes him does not match up with his shadow in the next frame to the right which, is, in fact, part of the second frame showing Al. Assembled by Dave Byrne.\n\nDave Byrne has assembled an alternate version ( 1.1 Mb ) using the second image of Al carrying the ALSEP packages. In this assembly, he is attached to his shadow. Note, also, the shadow of the RTG package, which Al has on his right. Marv Hein has produced a VR version.\n\n118:18:09 Pete's First Pan at Middle Crescent Crater ( 382k )\n\nPete took this partial pan from the southeast rim of Middle Crescent just before he and Al headed back for the LM. The frames are AS12-46- 6836 to 6844. Note the strong colors at the center of the righthand frames. Examination of successive frames indicate that this related to the camera lens, very likely a dust smudge. Kipp Teague notes \"The lens aberration begins at as12-46-6813. It's a blue glow around the astronaut in 6818, again in 6826, a discoloration in other frames, affecting clarity in most, and it's not gone again until 6853 (back in the LM). Whatever the phenomenon is, it has a varying impact on color based on the brightness of the central object in the image. On bright subjects, the aberration adds a blue cast, and on darker subjects, the aberration adds a reddish cast.\" I note that it also seems to vary with sun angle.

These are presented at 300 dpi equivalent and are labeled \"OF300\". See a discussion from Arizona State University about the scanning process used on the original film.\n\nSome images are currently available only as low-resolution scans provided by NASA Johnson in the mid-1990s. The individual scans have TARGA filenames. Markus Mehring has compiled cross-references between those filenames and the NASA photo ID designations customarily used. Other images are available as higher resolution scans from prints and, unless otherwise credited, were provided by Kipp Teague.\n\nMagazine 46/Y (Color) Frames 6715-6868\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all images processed by Kipp Teague from raw scans provided by NASA Johnson. Images labeled \"OF300\" are from the original film and are presented at the equivalent of 300 DPI on an 7.5 inch by 7.5 inch reproduction.\n\nEd Hengeveld has provided a set of thumbnails images ( 1 Mb ) made from low-resolution scans provided by Glen Swanson of NASA Johnson.\n\nAl Bean took the first four frames throught hatch of Pete starting down the ladder.

The TV camera is on the MESA (at the lower left) pointed at the bottom of the ladder. The thermal shroud that contains the U.S. flag that they will deploy can be seen under the lefthand ladder rail. Note the reflection of the lunar surface in the LM window.\n\nAS12-46-6727 (OF300) ( 218k or 1078k )\n\n115:50:57 Al Bean is about halfway down the ladder, with his right foot on the fourth rung up. He may be reaching down with his right hand to grab the siderail before he steps down with his right foot. An enhanced detail shows the hatch and other features in the shadowed region.\n\nAS12-46-6728 (OF300) ( 230k or 1150k )\n\n115:50:57 Al is one rung up from the bottom of the ladder, with his right hand on the ladder and his right foot on the rung. His OPS antenna doesn't appear to be up. The MESA is at the lower left. Surveyor Crater is visible beyond the ladder.\n\nAS12-46-6729 (OF300) ( 204k or 1143k )\n\nAt about 115:51:59, Pete asked Al to pose as he stepped off the LM footpad for the first time.

As Pete mentions at 118:27:12, he mistakenly took the pan at 15-foot focus instead of 74-foot focus.\n\nAS12-46-6730-31 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 0.8 Mb )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph with perspective correction by Eric Jones.\n\nAS12-46-6731 (OF300) ( 170k or 1075k )\n\n116:22:29 Rightward of 6730. Down-Sun view. The larger of the two mounds that Pete and Al will investigate after deploying the ALSEP is visible at the right side just below the local horizon. As can be seen in a traverse map ( 715k ), the large mound is about 22 degrees north of west as seen from the LM. At the time Pete took this picture ( about 1244 GMT/UTC on 19 November 1969 ), the Sun was almost exactly east of the spacecraft at an azimuth of 91 degrees and at an elevation of 8.4 degrees. The north rim of Head Crater is on a line about halfway between the tip of Pete's shadow and the mound. As Pete mentions at 118:27:12, he mistakenly took the pan at 15-foot focus instead of 74-foot focus.\n\nAS12-46-6731-32 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 1.2 Mb )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph with perspective correction by Eric Jones.\n\nAS12-46-6732 (OF300) ( 200k or 1242k )\n\n116:22:29 Rightward of 6731.

In the distance, Al is taking pictures of the Solar Wind Collector (SWC) . Comparing with Al's picture AS12-47-6898, the cross piece on top of the SWC staff and the collector sheet itself both lie in the vertical plane that passed thru Pete's position and are, therefore, virtually edge-on and hard to see. As Pete mentions at 118:27:12, he mistakenly took the pan at 15-foot focus instead of 74-foot focus.\n\nAS12-46-6735-36 Red-Blue Anaglyph ( 1.2 Mb )\n\nRed-blue anaglyph with perspective correction by Eric Jones.\n\nAS12-46-6736 (OF300) ( 226k or 1305k )\n\n116:22:29 Rightward of 6735.

Compare with the corresponding frames from Pete's 4 o'clock pan, AS12-46-6746, and his 8 o'clock pan, AS12-46-6769. The body and legs of the Surveyor are in shadow. Note the two overlapping craters on the sunlit, southeast inner wall of Surveyor Crater. Note, also, the blocky rimmed crater just outside the LM shadow in the foreground. These blocks may be ejecta from Surveyor Crater which was buried by regolith sprayed onto the site by other impacts and was then brought back to the surface for a second time (at least) by the impact that made the small crater.

Close-up of the TV camera, with the Solar Wind Collector (SWC) at the left edge of the picture. Note the loop in the TV cable running off to the left.\n\nPaul Coan, Manned Spaceflight Center Television Subsystem Manager who was responsible for the equipment used on the Apollo spacecraft, writes, \"The same type of cable used to carry video and power between the Apollo 11 TV camera and the LM was used during Apollo 12 to power the first color TV camera to be put on the lunar surface. However, the connector on the color camera did not match the connector on the end of the lunar surface cable that was an integral part of the camera handle. (See a detail from Apollo 11 photo S-69-31575 ). Since the design and qualification of the lunar surface cable was so expensive, it was cost prohibitive to replace the connector on the cable. Cost, schedule, and design constraints also precluded replacing the connector on the color camera. So, we decided to build an adapter that provided the interconnection.\"\n\nIn a detail from 6756, the color-camera camera hangs down from the back, with the yellow-coated adapter immediately blow attached to the silver-tube of the 'handle' from the Apollo 11 configuration.\n\nCoan adds, \"During testing of the color lunar camera connected to the LM on the pad at KSC, we noticed hum bars in the video. We then realized that the finite resistance of the power circuit in the 100 foot lunar camera cable combined with the switching power supply in the camera was sufficient to inject the hum bars in the video. We had to rework the power supply circuits to eliminate the hum bars. There was some quick redesign/rework done to make the camera work.\"\n\n\"Finally, there was a special room provided at KSC for final checkout of the cameras before they were installed in the spacecraft. So that we could test under controlled lighting conditions, the room was painted totally black and provided with heavy window curtains to eliminate light from outside.\".\n\nAS12-46-6756-57 Red-Blue Anaglyph (0.5 Mb)\n\nRed-blue anaglyph with perspective correction by Eric Jones.\n\nAS12-46-6757 (OF300) ( 203k or 1003k)\n\n116:24:47 Rightward of 6756, with the TV camera on the left.

A good picture of Al, who is still photographing the plus-Y footpad with the TV camera in the background. Notice the line of footprints that Pete made when he came over from the location of the 4 o'clock pan. This photo gives an impresssion of the way the ground was swept by the engine exhaust. This is particularly evident - perhaps because of lighting - along a line from the engine bell (off-image to the left) through the probe at the left edge to the lower right corner.

We can see the \"saddlebag\" he is wearing at his left hip. The saddlebag material resembles the Teflon cloth used for the Sample Collection Bags (SCBs) used on Apollos 15, 16 and 17. Note that the transmitted light in the shadow of the saddlebag has a reddish-brown color. We can see the boom on which the RTG package rode as it was pulled out of the SEQ bay. We can also see the pulleys that were operated with the tapes. The SEQ bay door that covered the right-hand 2/3rds is folded up out of the way. At the left side of the bay, we can see the vertically hinged portion of the door pulled back out of the way. Note that the SEQ bay is not an integral part of the LM structure but, rather, hangs on the outside. Below the SEQ bay, we can see a shield which protects the landing radar (mounted on the bottom of the Descent Stage) from heat radiating from the engine bell. On the package, the RTG, with its distinctive, grey radiator fins is nearest the ground while the folded, silver frame of the HTC is above it, nearest to Al's right hand.\n\nAS12-46-6784 (OF300) ( 165k or 946k )\n\n116:34:14 Down-Sun photograph of ALSEP package No. 1, which Pete removed from the SEQ Bay at 116:33:36.\n\nAS12-46-6785 (OF300) ( 203k or 964k )\n\n116:34:14 Al has placed the RTG package on the ground. Note the cooling fins on the RTG. Note the pull rings on the edge closest to Al. These pull rings are used to release \"pip pins\" with which some pieces of equipment are attached to the RTG pallet. The light-colored piece of gear that is attached to the part of the RTG pallet that is on top in this picture is the SIDE (Suprathermal Ion Detection Experiment). Note the deployment rail and pulleys extending out from the SEQ bay above the upper ends of the lanyards. The distinctive ring-shaped top of the fuel cask can be seen behind the left-hand SEQ bay door. The landing radar is under the SEQ Bay, directly beneath the partition separating the two ALSEP compartments. The shield that protects the radar from descent engine exhaust is farther to the right. Note the saddlebag on Al's left hip and note, also, that Pete's shadow shows that he is wearing one too.\n\nAS12-46-6786 (OF300) ( 164k or 855k )\n\n116:40:44 Al Bean lowers the cask that holds the plutonium fuel element used to power the RTG. During the flight from Earth, the cask is positioned vertically against the side of the LM. Here, Bean is using a lanyard to rotate the cask down into a horizontal position so that he can use a special tool to remove the dome top and extract the fuel element. The landing radar is under the SEQ Bay beyond the RTG and the radar shield is farther back. Note that Pete and Al have closed the SEQ Bay doors to prevent the cavity from heating and putting a thermal load on the LM interior.\n\nAS12-46-6787 (OF300) ( 256k or 1273k )\n\n116:42:40 Al Bean removes the protective dome from the RTG fuel cask. The landing radar and the shield that protects the radar from the engine exhaust are visible beyond the RTG. Note the fuel-element extraction tool sticking out of the HTC sample bag. Compare with AS12-46-6789 below.\n\nAS12-46-6788 (OF300) ( 251k or 1142k )\n\n116:43:02 Al Bean has removed the protective dome from the RTG fuel cask and is placing it out of the way to his left. The landing radar and the shield that protects the radar from the engine exhaust are visible beyond the RTG. Note the fuel-element extraction tool sticking out of the HTC sample bag. Compare with AS12-46-6790 below.\n\nAS12-46-6789 (OF300) ( 186k or 935k )\n\n116:43:38 Al is fitting the fuel-element exraction tool onto the fuel element. The HTC is behind him on the left and the landing radar and radar shield are on the bottom of the LM to the right.\n\nAS12-46-6790 (OF300) ( 191k or 851k )\n\n116:43:38 Al is trying to remove the RTG fuel element from the cask.\n\nAS12-46-6791 (OF300) ( 261k or 1231k )\n\n116:50:59 Al attaches the RTG package to the carrybar which will later serve as the Central Station antenna mast. As can be seen in a detail, he has inserted the end of the carry bar into a slightly larger round opening in the lock on what will be the bottom of Package 2 - to his right - and will then pull up on the carry bar to seat it in the close-fitting upper hole. With the center-of-mass of the pallet below the upper hole, gravity will help keep the package secure on the carrybar. He has already secured the carry bar to Package 1, which is on Al's left and, as indicated in the detail, holds the Passive Seismic Experiment (PSE), the Solar Wind Spectrometer (SWS), and the Lunar Surface Magnetometer (LSM).\n\nAS12-46-6792 (OF300) ( 255k or 1229k )\n\n116:50:59 Similar to 6791, showing Al attaching the RTG package to the carrybar.\n\nAS12-46-6793 (OF300) ( 111k or 770k )\n\n116:55:53 Pete took this down-Sun of the larger of the two mounds near the ALSEP deployment site. Pete's shadow shows us that he is using a UHT to carry the SIDE subpallet.\n\nAS12-46-6794 (OF300) ( 192k or 1190k )\n\n116:55:53. As Pete got closer to the larger mound, he took a stereopair, starting with this frame.\n\nAS12-46-6795 (OF300) ( 227k or 1323k )\n\n116:55:53. Pete stepped to his right to get this stereo-companion to 6794.\n\nAS12-46-6796 (OF300) ( 170k or 1103k )\n\n116:57:52 Pete starts a 16-frame pan near the ALSEP deployment site. This first frame shows the view a little to the left of down-Sun. We can see the shadow of the UHT sticking up out of the SIDE subpallet.\n\nAS12-46-6797 (OF300) ( 136k or 919k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6796. Down-Sun.\n\nAS12-46-6798 (OF300) ( 187k or 1170k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6797.\n\nAS12-46-6799 (OF300) ( 216k or 1337k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6798.\n\nAS12-46-6800 (OF300) ( 238k or 1398k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6799. View to the north.\n\nAS12-46-6801 (OF300) ( 265k or 1547k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6800.\n\nAS12-46-6802 (OF300) ( 234k or 1392k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6801.\n\nAS12-46-6803 (OF300) ( 230k or 1409k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6802.\n\nAS12-46-6804 (OF300) ( 123k or 762k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6803, with the Sun on the righthand side.\n\nAS12-46-6805 (OF300) ( 108k or 672k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6804. Up-Sun.\n\nAS12-46-6806 (OF300) ( 163k or 891k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6805. Al is carrying the ALSEP package out from the LM. As can be seen in a detail, he is walking flat-footed, in part because the mass of the ALSEP packages is nearly the same as the his own mass, including the suit and backpack; and, in part, because the carrybar is flexing and would be difficult to control if he tried to use a loping stride. Note that he is holding the carrybar in his hands, with his arms hanging down in front of him. Other LMPs discovered that it was easier to carry and control the packages by holding their arms up in front of them and getting the carrybar in the elbow crooks. Note the flag and the S-Band antenna to the left of the LM.\n\nAS12-46-6807 (OF300) ( 229k or 1317k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6806. Al carrying the ALSEP package out from the LM.\n\nAS12-46-6808 (OF300) ( 206k or 1257k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6807, with Al's shadow in the foreground.\n\nAS12-46-6809 (OF300) ( 191k or 1168k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6808. Frame from Pete's pre-deployment ALSEP pan. View to the south with Al's shadow at the bottom. A portion of the large mound is on the right edge.\n\nAS12-46-6810 (OF300) ( 228k or 1229k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6809. Frame from Pete's pre-deployment ALSEP pan centered on the large mound SSW of Pete's current location.\n\nAS12-46-6811 (OF300) ( 195k or 1096k )\n\n116:57:52 Rightward of 6810. Last frame in Pete's pre-deployment ALSEP pan. View to the southwest.\n\nAS12-46-6812 (OF300) ( 216k or 994k )\n\n117:18:46 Solar Wind Spectrometer.\n\nAS12-46-6813 (OF300) ( 246k or 1424k )\n\n117:35:14 Al has deployed the three-arm Lunar Surface Magnetometer (LSM). The LM is in the background at the left edge of the picture. Good view of the saddlebag on Al's left hip. Because Pete landed so close to Surveyor crater, the LM footpads are below their current position and are hidden by a very slight, intervening rise.\n\nNote the foggy blue patch around Al. Examination of successive frames indicate that this feature is related to the camera lens, very likely a dust smudge. Kipp Teague notes \"The lens aberration begins at as12-46-6813. It's a blue glow around the astronaut in 6818, again in 6826, a discoloration in other frames, affecting clarity in most, and it's not gone again until 6853 (back in the LM). Whatever the phenomenon is, it has a varying impact on color based on the brightness of the central object in the image. On bright subjects, the aberration adds a blue cast, and on darker subjects, the aberration adds a reddish cast.\" I note that it also seems to vary with sun angle.\n\nAS12-46-6814 (OF300) ( 191k or 957k )\n\n117:43:45 This picture, taken across the top of the Central Station toward the magnetometer, shows the Central Station antenna. Note the attachment hardware that held the various experiment packages prior to deployment. A detail shows two Boyd bolt sleeves on the near edge and an empty hole where another one popped out after being released. The Solar Wind Spectrometer is at the center right edge of the picture.\n\nAS12-46-6815 (OF300) ( 155k or 843k )\n\n117:43:45 Pete has stepped to his left to take a different view of the Central Station antenna. A detail shows the male portion of a Boyd bolt and its sleeve lying on the top of the Central Station\n\nAS12-46-6816 (OF300) ( 156k or 877k )\n\n117:43:45 Similar to 6815.\n\nAS12-46-6817 (OF300) ( 240k or 1285k )\n\n117:43:45 Pete has moved away from the Central Station to take a longer view from the north. The Solar Wind Spectrometer is to the right of the Central Station, the Passive Seismic Experiment is to the left, and the Lunar Surface Magnetometer is in the background beyond and just to the left of the Central Station.\n\nAS12-46-6818 (OF300) ( 186k or 1086k )\n\n117:49:44 Pete is next to the RTG, which can be seen at the lower left, when he takes this picture to the southwest of Al deploying the SIDE/CCIG. Pete took the picture at some point before going over to help Al.\n\nAS12-46-6819 (OF300) ( 98k or 619k )\n\n117:55:54 Documentation of the Central Station and nearby equipment from roughly 25 meters southwest. Most details are lost in the glare of the Sun. The various piece of equipment can be identified in a comparison between a level-adjusted detail from 6819 and a detail from 6821 ( 282k ). The PSE cover can be seen in place on the ALSEP package in a detail from 6791.\n\nAS12-46-6820 (OF300) ( 243k or 1229k )\n\n117:56:56 Showing Al taking a close-up of the top of the SIDE. The CCIG is to the left of the SIDE while the ribbon cable connecting the SIDE to the Central Station runs out of the field-of-view to the right. The blue 'fog' is do to a dust smudge which first shows up on 6813. The crater at the lower right is large enough and deep enough to show up on LROC images (0.2 Mb) taken at high solar elevations high enough to show tracks left by the astronauts. The crater is labeled 'a' in the LROC images. Pete would have taken 6820 while standing just below the 'a'.\n\nAS12-46-6821 (OF300) ( 311k or 1724k )\n\n117:56:56 Pete's 'locator' to the Central Station from the SIDE/CCIG site. Note the blue-tinged area at center due to the dust smudge. As indicated in a comparison between a level-adjusted detail from 6819 and a detail from 6821 ( 282k ), the objects around the Central Station are (left to right) the RTG, Central Station, PSE cover, PSE, and SWS.\n\nAS12-46-6822 (OF300) ( 236k or 1247k )\n\n118:00:46 Pete took this photograph from just south of the small mound which, as can be seen in Al's magnetometer documentation photo AS12-47-6921, is north of the Central Station.\n\nAS12-46-6823 (OF300) ( 208k or 1134k )\n\n118:00:46 Stereo companion to 6822.\n\nAS12-"
