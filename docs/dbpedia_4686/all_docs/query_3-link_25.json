        "text": "Comparison\n\nWe are going to be looking at 13 different 120mm film stocks today. Both in color and black and white. Basically, we shot 13 different rolls of film with the same lighting condition and model so we could compare all the film stocks together. This isn’t a scientific process and isn’t meant to be. Register to get access to the full images here https://theslantedlens.com/filmscan/\n\n100 ISO\n\nFujifilm 100 Acros\n\nBoth Kenneth and I have no experience shooting with this film stock. It has a nice black, open shadow and holds the highlights well. There’s a smooth transition from blacks, shadows, and mid-tones. The highlights in the background are blown out but it has a nice quality to it.\n\nIlford 100\n\nThe Ilford has a larger grain texture than the Fujifilm did. It’s also much darker in the blacks. This film stock has a clearer distinction between white, mid, and black. Whereas the Fujifilm we were getting a smooth transition.\n\nIlford 125\n\nWe’re seeing the 125 is way more open than the 100. There’s nicer roll off from the whites to blacks. It opens up the image more and is more comparable to the Fujifilm we looked at before.\n\nTMAX 100\n\nTMAX is the gold standard in black and white because it’s so clean and open. The shadows are open and you get a nice image.\n\nBetween this and the Ilford 125 — it would be a tough choice. The TMAX would be amazing for portraits.\n\nMedium 400 ISO\n\nIlford HP5 400\n\nThe HP is far less contrasty compared to the Delta 400. It almost seems like the HP5 you would manipulate in post to look like the Delta. HP is going to give you a little bit more flexibility on the backend if you want to manipulate the image at all. Deta will give you a good look if you’re going directly to print.\n\nIlford Delta 400\n\nThis film stock gives you the classic street photography feel. Nice grain in the shadows and mid-tones.\n\nIlford XP2 Super 400\n\nThe cross-process gives off a ‘punchy’ look. Even more than the Ilford 100 which we thought was too contrasty.\n\nKodak TMAX 400\n\nIt’s interesting to see this film stock. It seems to not have any true blacks – which was a really popular style for a second.\n\nTRI-X 400\n\nTRI-X is ‘the film’ that people shot on. It’s a great film that has smooth transitions. Upper mid-tones look very bright and go up to the highlights. Compared to the Ilford Delta 400, it’s not as contrasty or sharp.\n\nIf I had to pick, the Delta 400 and the Tri-X would be the contenders. The Delta looks crisper, but the TRI-X is up there too.\n\nHigh ISO\n\nIlford Delta 3200\n\nWe only have one film in 3200. The grain is much more prominent obviously. It feels much more open than you’d expect though.\n\nLow ISO Color\n\nKodak Portra 160\n\nPortra is the gold-standard when it comes to color film. Skin tones look amazing. We just wish the shadows retained that magenta color but it tilts towards green. If you’re going for the vintage look, Portra is the way to go.\n\nExtar 100\n\nThe shadows on this stock look a bit blue to the eye.\n\nCine Still 50D\n\nFor this film stock they’ve stripped one of the layers off of it so you get this washed out look. There’s a yellow tint to the image and you can see a halo effect around her hat. It feels like a dreamy look.\n\nMid ISO 400 Color\n\nKodak Portra 400\n\nRealistic skin tones with less of a green tint than the Fujifilm 400. The safe choice in the color spectrum.\n\nFujifilm 400H\n\nBetween the Portra and the Fujifilm in this category, it’s a tough race. The Fujifilm seems to pop more with more vibrant colors. It skews a little green which we don’t necessarily like. It definitely has a certain look to it that some people will gravitate towards.\n\nHigh ISO Color\n\nKodak Portra 800\n\nHigher ISO color film — Kodak Portra 800 is the standard. This has a blue/magenta shadows and has a bit more contrast than the Portra 160.\n\nCine Still Tungsten 800\n\nWe were really impressed with how clean this 800 stock looked. The Cine Still looks a little bit more ‘organic’.\n\nFilm Stock We Used\n\nKodak Ektar 100 – B&H / Amazon\n\nKodak Portra 160 – B&H /Amazon\n\nKodak Portra 400 – B&H / Amazon\n\nKodak Portra 400H – B&H / Amazon\n\nKodak Portra 800 – B&H / Amazon\n\nKodak Tri-X 400 – B&H / Amazon\n\nKodak TMAX-2 400 – B&H / Amazon\n\nIlford 100 – B&H / Amazon\n\nIlford 125 – B&H / Amazon\n\nIlford HP5 400 – B&H / Amazon\n\nIlford Delta 400 – B&H /Amazon\n\nIlford XP2 Super 400 – B&H / Amazon\n\nIlford Delta 3200 – B&H / Amazon\n\nFujifilm Acros 100 – B&H / Amazon\n\nFujifilm Pro 400H – B&H / Amazon\n\nCine Still 50 – B&H / Amazon"
