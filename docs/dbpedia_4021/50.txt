The National Security Council (NSC) was established by the National Security Act of July 1947 (PL 235-61 Statute 496; U.S.C. 402). President Harry S. Truman created the Council in order to advise and assist the President on national security and foreign policies and to coordinate these policies among various government agencies.

This file group consists of correspondence, memoranda, reports, telegrams, cables, press releases, speeches, lists, drafts, news clippings, briefing papers, schedules, courtesy messages, invitations, public opinion mail, and printed materials that were generated or received by the Executive Office of the President. The Central Files consist of 60 subject categories that are divided into numerous sub-categories, confidential files, name files, chronological files, oversize attachments, and bulk mail. The materials in this file group reflect the diverse activities of the official and public activities of the First Lady and the President’s family.
