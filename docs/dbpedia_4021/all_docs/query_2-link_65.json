        "meta_description": "The history of art is different from other historical disciplines in that it is founded on direct visual confrontation with objects that are both concretely present and yet documents of the past. Department faculty emphasize analysis of images, objects, and built environments as the basis for critical thought and visual literacy. In addition to formal and iconographic analysis, faculty members use the work of other disciplines to understand visual images, such as social history, perceptual psychology, engineering, psychoanalysis, cultural studies, and archaeology. Because of its concentration on visual experience, the art history major increases one’s ability to observe and to use those observations as analytical tools for understanding history and culture. The studio division of the art major has been structured to foster the development of a critical understanding of making art to support creative interests, and to develop students’ perceptions and imaginations as they investigate a variety of visual media.",

This course celebrates the glory of works of art as physical objects, to be viewed and contemplated, to be sure, but also often to be worshiped, worn, touched (even licked), held, exhibited, bought and sold, passed through or around, and lived in. To help students begin to appreciate how these works of art might have been understood by those who originally made and used them, the course sets its objects of study within a number of revealing historical contexts, from the social and the political to the philosophical and the art historical. To give students time with original works of art, our discussion-centered conferences use the wealth of art resources in Williamstown: the Clark Art Institute, the buildings and sculpture of the Williams College Campus, and the Williams College Museum of Art.

Students will learn how to analyze art made for the widest variety of purposes, from inspiration and contemplation to commemoration and condemnation. We will look at some of this era's most deeply moving art, including works by Rembrandt and Maya Lin, Bernini and Frank Lloyd Wright, Van Gogh and Kehinde Wiley. To the extent that we are able, we will also spend time with original works and familiarize ourselves with the wealth of resources in Williamstown: the Williams College Museum of Art, the Clark Art Institute, and the Chapin Rare Book Library.

Following a chronological order, the course surveys important artworks that represent major developments in medium, style, and subject matter in the three cultures, while paying attention to the movement of objects and art techniques across the region. Key themes of the course include bronzes, lacquerware, ceramics, tomb building, Buddhist reliquaries, ink painting, wood-block printmaking, and timber frame architecture. Students will learn about the development of art and artisanal practices in East Asia, while gaining a broader understanding of the continuity and discontinuity of the local artistic traditions in relation to the region's history, politics, religion, and culture. East Asia boasts a history of art that stretches five thousand years. In addition to gaining an overview of important artistic traditions in the region through the lectures, students will develop visual analysis skills and engage with critical methodologies in East Asian art through closelooking exercises and discussion-driven case studies during sections. The course pays special attention to how the constant cross-cultural exchanges between China, Japan, and Korea contributed to the development of art in unique ways across time. What is the shape of \"East Asian art\"? How does art help define East Asia culturally? And what does it tell us about East Asia's past, present, and future? Exploring these questions through art, students gain an objectbased understanding of the civilizations in East Asia. The curriculum also integrates objects from the Williams College Museum of Art.

In the context of this course, students will not only study a wide array of objects, images, and structures that have been produced within this vast geography, but will also consider how such forms have used materials, ideas, and aesthetics to function variously as tools of divine manifestation, political intervention, social commentary, and identity construction. [ more ]\n\nARTH 105 LEC Arts of South Asia\n\nLast offered Spring 2024\n\nSouth Asia, which includes the modern-day nations of Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives, is often compared to the European continent. Regional societies in the Indian \"subcontinent\" are as distinct from each other as those of Italy, Germany and France. Similarly, they also differ in their language, dress, diet, rituals and politics. However, parallel to the wealth of diversity, South Asia also demonstrates a rich history of interconnectedness. This complex web of culture, language, religion and politics is best manifested in the arts of the region. How does visual culture reflect regional variations? How does a survey of artistic style and iconography help uncover networks of exchange across South Asia? What role did the arts play in the expression of religious traditions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Jainism and Islam? With these questions in mind, this course is designed as a survey of the arts of South Asia starting with the height of the Indus Valley Civilization in 2600 BCE and ending in 1857 CE, a date that marks the cessation of independent rule in South Asia. Using the study of architecture, painting, sculpture and textiles, students will learn how to make stylistic and iconographic analyses, while also improving their art historical writing and analytic skills.

How do we think about architecture as we move around, within, and through it? What can architecture tell us not only about material, design, and engineering, but also about the individuals, groups, and communities who make it? These inquiries provide the starting points for thinking about what architecture means as concept, space, and practice, and how it affects the ways in which human beings experience the world. As the primary mode through which we organize our lived reality, architecture not only channels human behavior into specific repertoires of action and reaction but also symbolizes beliefs, value systems, and ideas about the self, gender, nation, race/ethnicity, community, life, death, and the transcendent. Such themes, thus, constitute the critical lenses that students will use over the course of the semester to unpack how structural form has and continues to define the human condition in the broadest sense. Drawing from a variety of texts and examples that emphasize the diversity and complexity of architectonic traditions around the world, this course will analyze how individuals have employed architectural strategies to solve the problems of living within diverse contexts and how such spaces not only provide meaning in everyday life but also actively and dynamically order the world as space, object, environment, text, process, and symbol.

It will consider the artistic productions of several pre-contact and early colonial cultures that emerged in the regions now referred to as Mesoamerica, the \"United States,\" and \"Canada.\" Cultures to be addressed include Olmec, Maya, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Mexica (Aztec), Chaco, Mississippian, Inuit, and Native Hawaiian, among others. Students will learn not only about these cultures but also the sources and methods by which present-day scholars have come to know of their complexity. Artforms to be addressed will include ceramics, murals, sculpture, inscriptions, feather work, shell work, sacred architecture, residential architecture, and urbanism. This is one half of a two-course sequence that also includes, \"Arts of Ancestral Native and Indigenous South America and the Caribbean,\" (Spring 2024) and may be taken in any order or independently.

It will consider the artistic productions of several pre-contact and early colonial cultures that emerged in the Andes, Amazonia, the Southern Cone, and the Caribbean. Cultures to be addressed include Chavín, Nazca, Moche, Tiwanaku, Inca, Casarabe, Tupi-Guarani, Cocle, Taíno, and Mapuche, among others. Students will learn not only about these cultures but also the sources and methods by which present-day scholars have come to know of their complexity. Artforms to be addressed will include ceramics, murals, sculpture, khipu, tocapu, feather work, shell work, sacred architecture, residential architecture, and settlement. This is one half of a two-course sequence that also includes, \"Arts of Ancestral Native and Indigenous North America,\" and may be taken in any order or independently.

Latinx art and artists have gained significant attention and inclusion in the art world. For example, the opening of the Cheech Marin Center for Chicano Art and Culture reignited interest in Chicana/o art and revamped pressure on peer institutions to diversify their collections, exhibitions, and programming. While this renewed interest is positive, this context runs the risk of framing Latinx art as a new and an emergent category, thus dismissing a longer history of visual arts within Latinx communities across the U.S. This course offers an historically grounded introduction to Latinx visual art by placing the artistic production for the groups included under the label \"Latinx\" in their social, political and historical contexts. The course provides students with the visual arts vocabulary and theoretical skills to analyze visual art forms including sculptures, murals, posters, performances, and altares, while exploring their relevance to Latinx communities and American art. In debunking the notion of Latinx art as a new phenomenon, students will understand the conditions, struggles, and modes of resistance that inspire Latinx visual arts production in the U.S. since the 19th century and into our contemporary moment. Students will deepen their visual art literacy, enrich their understanding of the histories encapsulated by the term \"Latinx,\" and develop their appreciation for the visual arts.

In this course, we will learn the fundamental terms and theories in the field, and engage seminal artworks in the genre of performance art. Together, we will study artistic genealogies, analyze specific contemporary artworks, and center performance as a mode of analysis to engage the themes of identity, embodiment, self/other, memory, temporality, and systems of power. We will ask: What does performance do? How is performance art distinct from other creative modes of expression? What are the social, cultural, and political implications of using the body as material? This course will explore performance as an theoretical tool to understand everyday life and embodied practices, and as a creative mode of expression, critique, and world-building. Our readings will draw from feminist and queer theory, critical race theory, and disability studies, while centering various key strategies from contemporary performance art practices, including drag, camp, endurance-based works, re-enactment, performing for the camera, and collaboration. Class sessions will privilege group discussion.

While readings and viewings will focus on dance genres practiced at Williams and beyond, an important element of the course will be the practice of documenting, interpreting, and writing about performances. The course will enable students interested in dance, theater, and visual arts to hone their skills in the practice of analyzing still and moving images, while also offering students of history and art history the opportunity to develop competency in historical research. This is primarily a discussion-based seminar course. Learning objectives: to understand the social and political contexts for various artistic and performative genres; to develop the ability to document, analyze, and write about dance as a socio-historical practice; to explore interdisciplinary modes of engaging with movement-based performances.

We focus on the ways different communities--the imperial court, immigrant artists, monks, women, and commoners--employed and venerated Buddhist images for political legitimacy, personal salvation, and worldly benefit. This course also examines how Japanese Buddhist imagery became aestheticized in the early twentieth century and appropriated later in modern and contemporary visual cultures. Some of the topics to be discussed include the reception of continental styles of Buddhist sculpture, the relationship between mandalas and rituals, the role of women in developing Buddhist embroideries, and the Western reappraisal of Zen arts. Students will develop familiarity with the concepts and ideas underlying the production of Buddhist images and will gain foundational skills in analyzing the visual, material, and iconographic qualities of Japanese Buddhist art. For the final project, students will design a digital exhibition focused around one of the topics of the course.

Through a diverse set of readings, we will discuss how Islamic art is viewed today. How did, for instance, Colonialism and Orientalism from the 18th to the 20th centuries create an entrenched narrative for the study of the field, that continues to hold sway to this day? How have Muslim cultures defined their own artistic production? In particular, how can specific artworks, such as figural painting or palace architecture, be understood as \"Islamic\"? What are some key scholarly debates around the term \"Islamic Art\"? The tutorial is specifically designed keeping in mind the period of soul-searching the field is currently going through, even to the point of questioning the very term \"Islamic art\" and its epistemological parameters. By familiarizing students to an important discipline in art history, the aim of the tutorial is to provide alternate methodologies as well as epistemologies that run parallel to more mainstream or familiar avenues of study.

From colonial-era propaganda newsreels about Africa's 'fighting men' to contemporary white-savior narratives that exploit current socio-political ruptures on the continent for epic effect, films about Africa produced by a primarily Western cinematic regime have proven themselves to be highly effective apparatuses for framing \"Africa\" as a concept to be summoned time and time again to tell different stories for different audiences, and in doing so privilege particular viewpoints and imaginaries. This tutorial will provide a space for robust discussion and debate about the various representative tropes, conceptualizations, and visualizations that have been used to shape the contours of \"Africa\" as understood by a primarily Western audience from past to present, and how these same tropes in many ways have come to define the nature of the relationship between film / cinema and the continent over the history of their engagement. In doing so, it will also address how strategic displays and narratives deployed by cinematic productions often support specific power dynamics that locate an idea of \"Africa\" within paradigms of specific cultural and political understanding. In zeroing in on how such films promote targeted realities for people and places within the continent, this tutorial will address how \"Africa\" in Western film and cinematic traditions is positioned within a particular framework of understanding that is more often than not irrevocably tethered to a Western imaginary. [ more ]\n\nARTH 208(S) LEC Chinese Painting\n\nThis course surveys the Chinese painting tradition, from the second half of the first millennium BCE to the present. Following a dynastic timeline, the course covers important painting genres including funerary, religious, figures and portraiture, landscape, ink, bird-and-flower, and oil painting and considers them in relation to the shifting historical and cultural context of China. Key themes of the course include the relationship between the art of painting and religious beliefs, political ideology, self-expression, premodern painting theories and criticism, and encounters between the East and the West. As is the case with other cultures, the art of painting in China is shaped by both the painter and its time. In addition to an overview of the history of Chinese painting, students will develop skills in visually analyzing the style, the composition, and the brushstrokes of various painting genres, while gaining an understanding of how painting responded to different historical and cultural conditions in China. The course also pays special attention to primary sources on painting, through which students will learn to think about Chinese painting in its original artistic and intellectual context.

Its complex calendrics, astronomy, mathematics, art and hieroglyphic writing system are celebrated worldwide. The course will examine the trajectory and nature of ancient Maya civilization from the combined perspectives of archaeology and art history. The origins and evolution of the Maya states during the Preclassic period (1000 B.C.-A.D. 250) will be explored through the rich archaeological remains and Preclassic art styles. The Classic Maya civilization (A.D. 250-1000) will then be presented through a detailed survey of the archaeology, art and hieroglyphic texts of this period. Finally, the collapse of Classic Maya civilization and its transformation and endurance during the Postclassic period and under early Spanish rule (A.D. 1000-1600) will be critically evaluated through a review of the archaeological, iconographic, and ethnohistorical evidence.

The course begins in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when artists and writers first began formulating the notion of an art \"native\" to Latin America, and continues through the ever-expanding cultural expressions developed throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. Through a contextual approach, we will pay particular attention to Latin American artists' shifting relationships to race, class, and gender issues, their affiliations with political and revolutionary ideals, and their critical stance vis-à-vis the European avant-gardes. Similarly, we will analyze the emergence and development of Latinx artistic practices in the postwar U.S., tracing these artists' own exploration of race, class, and gender dynamics. This class introduces Latin American and Latinx artistic practices and scholarship to enable students to develop a critical understanding of the historical specificity of diverse movements, their relation to canonical definitions of modern and contemporary art, and their relevance to issues of colonialism, nationalism, revolutionary politics, and globalization. We will consider a vast array of genres--from painting and sculpture to printmaking, photography, conceptual, installation, and performance art--and will draw from artist statements, manifestos, and secondary interpretive texts to consider both the impetus behind these dynamic artworks and their lasting legacies.

Much like today, spectacle and the dissemination of images lay at the heart of political and social life. The visual arts were crucial both to how the Romans rehearsed their identity and goals as a community, and to how individual Romans communicated their achievements and values. In this course, lectures on the art and architecture of ancient Rome (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 400) will provide the backdrop for an investigation into the role visual culture played in the lives of all Romans, including slaves and former slaves, women and children. Special topics will include the funeral and funerary portraiture; the military triumph and monuments of victory; the house as a site of memory; the use of images on coins; participation in religious celebrations; displays of war booty and prisoners of war; experience and audience at the racetrack and in the amphitheater; the spectacle of food and dining; and the Roman street as both contested space and a place for art. Readings will include a combination of primary and secondary sources. All readings are in translation.

From the beginnings of Christianity, pilgrims from Europe made the long journey to sacred sites in what they called the Holy Land (extending across ancient Palestine and parts of present-day Egypt, Israel/Palestine, Syria, and Turkey), the place of Christ's life, death, and believed resurrection. Large numbers of pilgrims even made the long journey to the Holy Land, and especially to Jerusalem, to visit a range of sacred sites related to Christ and his saints. When these sites became less accessible with the spread of Islam in the seventh century -- and even before this time -- Europeans sought to recreate many of them at home. Later, from 1095 onward, Christian Europeans attempted to reclaim and hold the Holy Land from non-Christians by force, through an ill-fated series of five major and several lesser \"crusades.\" Over the centuries, before, during, and after the Crusades, exposure to the peoples, ideas, and cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean also came through trade and through the travel and settlement of non-Europeans in Europe itself, particularly in Spain, Sicily, and Venice. Through all of these centuries, moreover, the Christian, Greek-speaking empire of Byzantium, focused on its great capital of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), interacted in myriad ways, both friendly and hostile, with the Latin-speaking polities of Western Europe, focused at least symbolically on their ancient capital of Rome. Together, by way of open discussion, we will explore artistic production within each of these different cross-cultural contexts of East-West encounter. In the process, we will reflect on how art could function as a conduit for the exchange of ideas in the Middle Ages, and how it could be used both to negotiate and to intensify cultural difference.

This course will consider cultural ideas about the body in antiquity, and trace their repercussions in the modern era. Over the course of the semester we will concentrate on 12 case studies, each representing a specific concept from an area of the Mediterranean. Topics include the \"shining bodies\" of bare-chested potentates in Egypt and the ancient Near East, statues that give the dead voice, the perfection and humanity of the bodies of the gods, ancient Greek science and the nude goddess, the pathos of Hellenistic athletes, and the interpretative challenge of the ambiguous and sensuous marble forms of the Barberini Faun or the Sleeping Hermaphrodite, both found in Roman contexts. We'll consider the cross-influences of ideas about gender, class, race and the body coded in public and private art. Reading material will include ancient literature in translation as well as contemporary critical essays. Evaluation will be based on participation in discussion and group presentations, short response paper, tests on images, and a final 8-page research paper. Engaged library research of original paper topics will be supported throughout the semester.

How were these pictures used, both in public and in private life, and why? How did the art of these unique religious traditions forge connections between the visible and invisible worlds? Paying particular attention to the function and experience of works of art within Christian and Islamic cultures, this seminar examines the evolution of devotional visual expression, while also exploring the problems sacred images generated in these distinct yet often overlapping traditions. Through readings and class discussion, the course will investigate, among other topics: the varied attitudes toward the representability of God in Judaism, Islam, and Christianity; the impact of earlier image traditions on the religious art of medieval Christians and pre-modern Muslims; the cult of the devotional image, concerns over idolatry, and the destruction of images; ideas about spiritual versus physical vision and their influence on the making and viewing of pictures; the relationship of sacred images to relics and to various aspects of organized ritual; and the possible roles played by pictures of the sacred in silencing or giving voice to dissent.

We will trace the rise of Modernism and Anti-modernism and investigate the concept of the avant-garde. We will situate the crucial artistic movements of the period--from Fauvism to Futurism, Cubism to Constructivism, Social Realism to Surrealism, Art Deco to Dada, the Harlem Renaissance to the Bauhaus--within the social, political, economic and historical contexts in which they arose. Particular attention will be paid to how the work of women artists contributed to the aesthetic and philosophical motivations that shaped the avant-garde.

Created within a hundred years of each other all within territories controlled by the Normans--a warrior dynasty that settled in northern France in the 10th century and then expanded north into England and south into Italy in the 11th and 12th centuries--each of these works is unprecedentedly ambitious in scale, dazzling in its material properties, and survives in its original wholeness, a rarity in the medieval world. Despite these similarities, however, each work is very different from the other two and so sheds light on very different aspects of Norman experience, across Europe. The Bayeux Tapestry, likely made by female embroiderers for a baronial hall, is a giant textile (over 70 meters long) that in gruesome and fascinating detail tells the story of the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066. The Cappella Palatina in Palermo, in turn, commissioned by King Roger II, is a royal chapel covered in sumptuous mosaics that reveals through its decoration and ritual the dynamic interaction of Islamic, Byzantine, and Latin Christian traditions in the multicultural Norman kingdom of Sicily in the 12th century. And the Psalter of Christina of Markyate, a large prayerbook made for the use of a female recluse in southern England, contains 40 full-page paintings and 215 decorated initials, a vast and inventive program of imagery that through its creative profundity helped reshape private devotional art and culture for centuries to come. Through their variety, then, these three objects--an embroidery, a building, and a book--give students insight into the rich array of concerns and aspirations, from the political to the spiritual and from the public to the private, that gave substance and meaning to 11th- and 12th-century European life, for women as well as men. What is more, these three remarkable works of art have been the focus of much interesting scholarship in recent years, so an exploration of some of that literature provides a compelling introduction to the discipline of art history itself, past and present.

These structures range from traditional columned halls of brick and timber to modernist ensembles of reinforced concrete and plate glass; monuments may be open to the elements, flat-roofed or domed; surfaces may be enhanced with carved marble, inlaid wood, glazed tile and other beautifying elements.

We will examine photographs used for documentary, scientific, and aesthetic purposes, and we will trace the medium's emergence and acceptance as a fine art. We will also explore photography's physical and conceptual characteristics as a medium, paying particular attention to its uniquely intimate and frequently contested relationship to \"the real.\" By the end of the course, students will have a broad understanding of photography as a unique medium within the history of art and knowledge of the theoretical frameworks that developed alongside that history.

In the Middle East, the powers and pleasures of the medium have been valued by colonial forces, indigenous populations, photojournalists and artists; the resulting images merit aesthetic and art historical appreciation even as they grant visual access to the social and political dynamics operative in diverse cultural contexts. We will explore photographic practices in various zones of the Middle East--e.g., the Holy Land, Turkey, Egypt and the Persian sphere--by attending to individual photographers and case studies. This tightly focused approach will support, in turn, a consideration of the agency and power of images more generally--what work do photographs do? Who resists and who benefits?

Drawing on graphic novels such as the late Congressman John Lewis' March and Ebony Flowers' Hot Comb, this course illustrates and critiques multiple ways the graphic novel commingles word and image to create more sensorial access into ethnic traumas, challenges and interventions in critical moments of resistance throughout history. Students will practice analyzing graphic novels with the help of critical essays, reviews and film; the chosen texts will center on Africana cultures, prompting students to consider how the graphic novel may act as a useful alternate history for marginalized peoples. During the course, students will build comic creation and analysis skills through short exercises, eventually building up to the final project of a graphic short story that illustrates historical and/or autobiographical narratives. No art experience is required, only an openness to expanding one's visual awareness and composition skills. This course is often taught in collaboration with the Williams College Museum of Art's Object Lab program, which allows the class to have its own space and art objects that are directly related to the course topic. This class may feature Object Lab participation, film screenings, and collaborations with guest speakers.

Students are introduced to important artworks in ceramics, bronze, lacquer, jade, and built spaces including royal palaces, mausoleums, and ritual monuments, while learning to think about them in their archaeological context. Special attention is paid to the relationship between artistic innovations and the rise of new materials and craft technologies, such as glass and fire gilding.

Though these painters are world famous, they are rarely studied comparatively, and in the context of their Spanish artistic roots. The syllabus will cover the historical and social contexts in which they started working, and how they followed, and departed from, artistic conventions of the time. Through specific paintings, we will consider the historical evolution of the artists' relationship to their patrons and subjects, from the elite status of Velázquez within the royal court, to Goya's dramatic rise with the reigns of Charles III, and Charles IV, and his subsequent exile to France. Picasso was free of royal patronage and also lived in France, yet despite this freedom he remained deeply connected to the themes and concerns of his Spanish artistic predecessors. In addition to key paintings including Velázquez's \"Las Meninas\" and other royal portraits, Goya's \"Maja Desnuda\" and his series \"The Disasters of War,\" Picasso's \"Guernica,\" and his own 20th century reinterpretation of \"Las Meninas,\" we will focus on the artists' shared subjects of portraits and war, and consider the following issues: How does the role of the Spanish artist change over the periods covered? How did the artist exercise his freedom whilst under the scrutiny of the court and the Catholic Church? How were these painters' lives and work shaped by key historical events such as the Inquisition, Napoleon's invasion of Spain, or the Spanish Civil War? How does the work of art evolve in its role from private royal commission to public display in museums open to all? We will read short literary pieces from each period, primary materials such as letters and other documents, and historical and critical works. All readings will be in English. Knowledge of Spanish is encouraged, but not required.

New discoveries in the natural sciences and competing theories of evolution intertwined with shifting conceptions of natural history, of nature, and of humankind's proper place within it. This course will investigate the links between art and natural science. It will seek to understand the crucial role of the visual arts and visual culture in the study and staging of natural history from the eighteenth century to the present. We will pursue the questions that preoccupied the artists themselves. How should an artist react to new ecological insights? What is the proper artistic response to newly discovered flora and fauna? What is the role of aesthetics in the communication of knowledge? How are those aesthetics connected to ethics? How might a drawing of a plant convey information that is different from that of a photograph or a glass model of a plant? How might a theatrical diorama frame a scientific idea in a way that is different from a bronze statue? Students will seek to understand the myriad connections between seeing, depicting, and knowing, to question long-held assumptions about the division between \"objective\" science and \"subjective\" art, and to recognize that art has the ability not only to interpret, disseminate, and display scientific knowledge, but to create it as well.

Large numbers of non-Greeks came under the control of newly established Hellenistic kingdoms, while in the west Rome's emergence as a superpower offered both new opportunity and danger. The Hellenistic world was a place of vibrant change in the spheres of art, architecture, urban planning, and public spectacle. In this course, we will consider the art and archaeology of this period in their political, social, and religious contexts, focusing on the visual language of power and royalty; developments in painting, sculpture, mosaics, and monumental architecture; interactions between Greeks and non-Greeks; and the impact of Greek culture in Rome.

From our modern vantage point, the cultural accomplishment of the 15th and 16th centuries in Italy clearly has the ability to astound. Calling to mind the inimitable imagination of Botticelli, the scientific genius of Leonardo, or the superhuman creativity of Michelangelo brings into focus an inspiring narrative of individual accomplishment, innovation, and progress (ideals we easily understand and may well share). This is an important story we still tell of human achievement. This tutorial explores a critical question: where are the women in this narrative? Women were not typically artists, so how might we bring their roles, force, and power into focus? To do this, we will turn away from the grand historical narrative we so easily recognize and enter a more foreign world: a realm of everyday experience in which art-never created for its own sake-was powerful, and mattered to people. Art shaped realities and mediated the fundamental questions and of life and death, from power, sexuality, love, desire, and self-definition, to mortality and communion with divinity When we approach Renaissance art on its own terms, our picture expands to include women, their lives, and what they themselves wanted to see. In addition to secondary scholarship, we will pay close attention to primary sources (including images themselves), giving students ample change to forge original arguments: one of the central goals of the tutorial. [ more ]\n\nARTH 232 LEC Renaissance Rome: Renovating the Eternal City\n\nLast offered Spring 2023\n\nGeorge Eliot called Rome \"the city of visible history,\" a place with the power to bring \"the past of a whole hemisphere\" right before our eyes. The magnetic visual power of Rome did not just occur naturally, however; it is a product of a bold urban project first envisioned by Renaissance popes and brought into being by the artists and architects they hired. During the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Rome was transformed from a shrinking and neglected medieval town into a thriving center of artistic energy and invention. Beginning with the papacy's return to the city in 1417, we will focus on the historical, ideological, and artistic forces behind this period of renovation and restoration that reshaped the urban and artistic fabric of the city. We will study the particularly Roman foundations for the period known as the High Renaissance, then, approaching art historical touchstones by Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bramante as works grounded in a uniquely Roman sense of time and historical destiny. We will conclude with a selective look at Baroque works by Caravaggio, Bernini and Borromini, exploring their powerful innovations and effects as a continuation of the Renaissance renewal of the eternal city.

This course will follow a chronological framework, giving students a grounding in the development of Italian art over the course of the 14th-16th centuries, but will also take a thematic approach that will allow us to delve into important art historical issues. Some, such as historical consciousness and the relationship to the past, or the reinvention of the idea of the artist and of art itself, will be important as we construct a critical understanding of the idea of \"renaissance,\" or \"rebirth,\" long central to the identity of the period. Others, such as gender, patronage, power, naturalism, and the materiality of objects, will bring us deep into the worlds in which these dazzling and still powerful works of art were originally created and experienced.

Traditionally understood as the divine abode of Avalokitesvara, the bodhisattva who embodies the compassion of all buddha in Buddhist cosmology, Tibet was also fantasized as the immortal realm of \"Shangri-la\" by western interpreters. In this course, we will begin by examining the imagination and representation of Tibet and its culture in modern western discourses, and then shift the focus to the development of artistic forms of Tibet in the context of Tibet's history and religious movements, from ancient times to the present.

It is an artistic practice whose legacy stretches back to at least the first century CE. This studio course will introduce students to the technique and practice of traditional Indian drawing and painting. The course is designed as a workshop in which students will learn to use materials and techniques of this art form. By engaging with a non-western traditional practice, the aim of the course is to expose students to a pluralistic engagement with art making. Students will learn paper and pigment preparation, as well as the basics of traditional drawing and painting techniques. The class will learn from studying a selection of original masterworks of Indian art from the Williams College Museum of Art that will be displayed in the Object Lab. Working with original artworks will help students situate the hands-on study of Indian painting practice alongside exemplary historical examples.

This course will explore the overlaps between documentary photography and field methods of social science, concentrating particularly on the genre in which the two intersect: the photo essay. The students will learn methods of visual narrative and storytelling, using techniques of interviewing, still photography, and video. Concurrently, we will explore a number of examples of investigative work that blend word and image. We will ask questions about the changing practices and expectations associated with the documentarian's role, and the evolving media in which such work can be presented. Lastly, we will discuss ethical questions that haunt documentary work, including issues of responsibility and politics of representation, as well as the perennial question of whether \"objective representation\" is even possible or desirable. Experience in photography and/or video is not required, but students will be expected to master basic technical skills in image acquisition and audio editing taught in a separate lab section. Students should also be prepared to interact extensively with people in the community and spend a significant time off campus doing fieldwork. [ more ]\n\nARTH 238 LEC Greek Art and the Gods\n\nLast offered Spring 2020\n\nIn the Iliad, when the god Apollo is visualized, it is as a man, angry in his heart, coming down from the peaks of Olympos, bow and quiver on his shoulders, the arrows clanging as the god moves, \"like the coming of night,\" to bring dogs, horses, and men to their deaths. By the end of the Classical period, one statue of the archer god depicted him as a boy teasing a lizard. In this course, we will examine the development of the images the Greek gods and goddesses, from their superhuman engagement in the heroic world of epic, to their sometimes sublime artistic presence, complex religious function, and transformation into metaphors in aesthetic and philosophical thought. The course will cover the basic stylistic, iconographical, narrative, and ritual aspects of the gods and goddesses in ancient Greek culture. The course will address in detail influential artistic monuments, literary forms, and social phenomena, including the sculptures of Olympia and the Parthenon; divine corporeality in poetry; the theology of mortal-immortal relations; the cultural functions of visual representations of gods, and the continued interest in the gods long after the end of antiquity. Readings assignments will include selections from Homer, Hesiod, Sappho, Aischylos, Euripides, Plato, Walter Burkert, Jean-Pierre Vernant, Nikolaus Himmelmann, Erika Simon, and Friedrich Nietzsche. [ more ]\n\nARTH 240 LEC Histories, Communities, and Collections\n\nLast offered Fall 2018\n\nWhat can the College's collections of documents, artifacts, art objects, natural history specimens, and rare books--whether housed in the Special Collections of the Library, Archives, or at the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA)--teach us about our institutional past? How do we put that past into dialogue with our present? Planned specifically to engage with the WCMA's The Field is the World, an exhibition that investigates two invisible histories contained within collections here on campus, this course will approach the questions of histories, communities, and collections in two ways. First, in lectures we will survey the history of collecting in Europe and the United States from the eighteenth century up to critical reinterpretations by contemporary artists and consider how collecting was often tied to other endeavors like establishing national institutions, researching human variety, representing colonial expansion, or documenting missionary efforts. Second, in interactive sessions we will meet with curators, librarians, and guest speakers to look at objects first hand and to discuss the relationship between collecting and scholarship. Over the course of the semester we will examine the historical models of knowledge production and audience engendered by collections and their display. Moreover, we will work together to formulate new models of interpretation that address overlooked histories and engage with the current interests of our campus community. [ more ]\n\nARTH 241 LEC Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, and Modernity\n\nLast offered Fall 2020\n\nIn 1874, an art critic mockingly termed Claude Monet's painting of a sunrise over the sea \"impressionist [...] more unfinished than wallpaper in an embryonic state.\" With this phrase, he gave a name to a new style of painting that profoundly shaped the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century avant-garde movements in Europe and beyond. Beginning with the invention of photography in the early nineteenth century and ending with the advent of cinema, abstraction, and mechanized warfare in the first decades of the twentieth, this course will trace the origins and afterlives of \"Impressionism\" in art and cultural history. Many of the artists who continue to draw the largest crowds in museums around the world today--among them Manet and Monet, Degas and Seurat, Van Gogh and Rodin, Klimt and Picasso--fall within our period of study and will be subjects of our examination. Designed for students who have no prior experience studying art history, the course will prioritize methods of close looking and formal analysis. (If social distancing protocols allow, the course will include optional study visits to examine first-hand examples of paintings, sculptures, decorative arts, and printmaking at the Clark Art Institute and Manton Study Center for Works on Paper and Williams College Museum of Art). At the same time, the questions and methods at the core of our inquiry will be fundamentally interdisciplinary, and will engage students all across the humanities and sciences (major scientific figures such as the inventor Thomas Edison and the evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin will figure prominently in our narrative). Readings will emphasize close engagement with primary sources drawn from multiple disciplines: writings by artists and art critics from the period, as well as scientists, philosophers, psychologists, political theorists, and poets. We will approach \"Impressionism\" and \"Post-Impressionism\" as episodes in the cultural history of Europe that are uniquely revealing of a historical experience we still acutely feel today, which was called, for the first time in the nineteenth-century, \"modernity.\" [ more ]\n\nARTH 552 LEC Art and Enlightenment in Europe\n\nLast offered Fall 2022\n\nThis lecture course traces the emergence of new modes of art- and image-making during two momentous centuries of European history that established the paradoxical foundations of our modern world. In this period, modern democracy was founded and determined by exploitative labor, the extraction of natural resources, and the rise of the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Over two centuries from the founding of the French Academy in 1648 to the 1839 invention of photography, this course traces these tensions in art and intellectual thought, examining beauty and the sublime, rationality and madness, personhood and enslavement, natural history and extraction, democracy and tyranny. Often defined in terms of the \"Enlightenment,\" this intellectual and artistic period engaged with freedom of religious thought, scientific experiment, and a belief that humanity was guided by reason and rationality. Yet these same discourses also laid the foundation for the invention of race, nationalism, and the expansion of European colonialism. Isolating a series of pivotal moments and emblematic figures in visual culture of this period, this course asks students to consider how art was implicated in Enlightenment, and, in turn, how Enlightenment was implicated in both newly liberatory and newly oppressive concepts of subjectivity and personhood. Particular emphasis will be placed on the history of science, and, relatedly, on the increasing global circulation of ideas, people, and goods. Artists in our purview include well-known figures like Velázquez, Rembrandt, Watteau, Hogarth, Goya, and Blake, as well as makers until recently left out of the art-historical canon, such as the Frankfurt-born botanical illustrator Maria Sibylla Merian, the Polynesian navigator and draftsman Tupaia, and the Guadeloupean neoclassical painter Guillaume Guillon-Lethière, the subject of a major upcoming exhibition at the Clark Art Institute. Designed for students with no prior experience studying art history, the course will work directly from objects in local collections, prioritizing methods of close looking and formal analysis. At the same time, the questions and methods of our inquiry will be fundamentally interdisciplinary. Readings will emphasize primary sources and recent scholarship. A separate discussion section will be offered for MA students.

This alluring notion has preoccupied artists and theorists from Michelangelo and Thomas More to Albrecht Dürer and Christopher Wren; it achieved tangible form in such new capitals as St. Petersburg and Washington, D.C. But the West has remained characteristically ambivalent about the city, especially in the United States, an ambivalence reflected in persistent attempts to decentralize the city (Frank Lloyd Wright), to beautify it (the City Beautiful Movement), reshape it (Urban Renewal) or abandon it (suburbanization). This course looks at the roots of those movements, and the development of urban and anti-urban thought from the Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution. Topics include Renaissance fortification design, the colonial cities of the New World, the picturesquely landscaped English garden, and the separatist societies that sought to create communal utopias in the wilderness. [ more ]\n\nARTH 245 SEM The Nature of Work\n\nLast offered Spring 2023\n\nWork is something that touches the lived experience and historical realities of almost every human being in every time and place. But how did ancient Mediterranean societies and cultures define and deploy the concepts of \"work\" and \"working,\" as both an activity and as discourse? This is a question that has received remarkably little attention, in part since modern scholars have all too often followed the lead of elite authors, who obscure the nature of work through their focus on its products: agricultural prosperity, material luxury, urban grandeur, etc. In this course, we will seek to shed light on the world of work in antiquity, to better understand both the experiences of those who worked for a living across an array of spheres and professions, and the value of work as a cultural, aesthetic, and literary concept. Special topics will include: the place of work in conceptions of a \"golden age\"; the literary topoi of work (like the idle shepherd or the virtuous peasant); representations of \"heroic work\" (most famously, the Labors of Hercules); the elision or erasure of non-elite labor for elite audiences in art and text; the iconography of work in painting, mosaic, and sculpture; and investigations into specific trades, crafts, and other forms of \"making\" (from midwifery to shoe making). Readings will be a combination of primary and secondary sources. All readings will be in translation.

What we see and how we make meaning from it all depends on so many variables--who we are, where we are, and what we choose to look at. A critical question is how art figures and what agency it wields in millennial settings. This class is an opportunity to explore these issues with particular reference to museums and the objects enshrined therein. Digitized collections enable us to wander freely in space and time, following ideas/images through history even as we might also engage the 'real thing' in person. Our approach will be comparative and interrogative; case studies might range from an oil painting to a wooden sculpture, a coin to an illuminated manuscript, a photograph to a video. Along the way, we will consider what \"art\" really is and how different visual cultures might be presented or distorted in museum exhibitions and public spaces.

Spanning such conflicts as the French Revolution of 1789, Napoleonic occupations, and imperial wars, this period of dramatic intellectual and social change ushered in a revolution in art in turn, keyed to new conceptions of subjectivity, freedom, and human experience. How did painting and sculpture of this period convey, wrestle with and embody these crises? We will examine the work of leading artists in depth, particularly as revolutions in art helped explore new accounts of the modern subject, both the interior self and that self in the public sphere. Additionally, we will discuss the ways in which these works have been in art-historical writing into the present.

This period witnessed the establishment and loss of Spanish, English, and French colonies, a proliferation of exploratory voyages, and the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade. Some of our objects of study will be European in origin from well-known artists including Rubens, Velasquez, Reynolds, and Gauguin. In many cases we will be asking questions about circulation--whether we are looking at Tupi featherwork from Brazil brought to Europe, Flemish prints adapted by artists in Central and South America, or tattoos on the bodies of people traveling to and from Tahiti. Against the backdrop of these context-specific case studies, students will be asked to consider contact, colonialism, exchange, and appropriation more conceptually.

This course looks at the major architectural movements of this period, and the theoretical ideas that shaped them. Topics include Neoclassicism, new building types, Victorian Architecture, the development of the architectural profession, and Art Nouveau. Major architects to be discussed include Piranesi, John Soane, Schinkel, Pugin, and H.H. Richardson. When possible, primary sources will be used. Students will be given experience in reading plans and writing about buildings.

In this course, students will explore how artistic forms and traditions in Africa have functioned as vehicles of access and integration for Islam, enabling it to assimilate itself with numerous African contexts towards becoming the dominant religious force on the continent. In addition, students will investigate how the forms, functions, and meanings of Afro-Islamic objects across the continent reflect not just one African Islam, but many different iterations, each shaped by the specific frameworks of its cultural context. The contemporary component of the course will examine how modernity in the form of globalization, technology, and Westernization has affected Afro-Islamic artistic traditions, and how these shifts reflect larger evolutions within understandings of Islam in Africa in the contemporary period. [ more ]\n\nARTH 262(F) LEC Modern Architecture\n\nA century ago, the Modern Movement promised the most sweeping cultural transformation since the Renaissance. Architecture was only one lobe of a comprehensive movement that embraced literature and painting, music and theater, all aspiring to the same radical emancipation from traditional form and structures of authority. What happened? How and why did modern architecture abandon its utopian vision? Students will explore the major developments in Western architecture from 1900 to the present, and become familiar with its major figures: Loos, Wright, Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, Le Corbusier, Aalto, Kahn, Venturi, Gehry, Hadid, and others. Students will learn a variety of skills as they design a 1000-square foot vacation house and present it to the class in the form of a model and set of drawings at quarter-inch scale.

This course examines American architecture, painting, and sculpture on its own terms, in the light of the social, ideological and economic forces that shaped it. Special attention will be paid to such themes as the Puritan legacy and attitudes toward art; the making of art in a commercial society; and the tension between the ideal and the real in American works of art.

Items such as comic strips, advertising, movie stills, television programs, soup cans, \"superstars,\" and a variety of other accessible and commonplace objects inspired the subject matter, form, and technique. This course will critically examine the history and legacy of Pop Art by focusing on its social and aesthetic contexts. An important component of the course involves developing skills in analyzing visual images, comparing them with other forms, and relating them to their historical context.

Artistic expression, regional politics and cultural landscapes have been shaped by its remarkable influence. With patrons ranging from powerful monarchs and monks to merchants and tradespeople, Buddhist art has historically reflected the religion's social inclusivity. This course will survey the architecture, painting and material culture of Buddhism in Asia, tracing its influence in diverse media, from rock-cut architecture to Zen painting. A close reading of primary texts, such as architectural inscriptions in India, manuscripts from Tibet, and travelogues of Chinese pilgrims, will provide greater context for the artworks. [ more ]\n\nARTH 275(S) LEC Digital Humanities in Art History and Literary Studies\n\nThis course introduces students to critical topics, techniques, and methods related to digital scholarship in the humanities. Students will learn how to critique the reliability of published case studies that use digital methods, and how to construct basic projects that use digital techniques, including text analysis, digital mapping, 3d modeling & imaging, and data analysis with both quantitative and qualitative data sources. They will also explore different ways of sharing research through digital methods, including virtual storytelling and best practices of data communication. Digital Humanities in Art History and Literary Studies provides a foundation to encourage student exploration of digital projects in a variety of disciplines at Williams, whether students wish to incorporate digital methodologies into a humanities discipline or to understand the ways humanities materials require different approaches to data and digital projects in the sciences. While trying different tools and approaches, we will discuss the larger ramifications of using digital techniques in humanistic disciplines. What kinds of ethical questions should we consider? What sorts of environmental footprint or sustainability issues do our projects raise? What kinds of power structures do they create, reflect, sustain, or dismantle?

Home to Genghis Khan and Timur (Tamerlane), Akbar the Great and Shah Jahan, it has generated some of the most renowned monuments (e.g. the Taj Mahal and the blue tiled mosques of Isfahan) and refined manuscript painting ever known. We will cover a broad swath of time--from the 10th to the 20th century--concentrating on important centers of artistic production such as Timurid Central Asia and Mughal India. Students will have the opportunity to study original works of art in the college museum collections.

In this course we will examine a range of modern and contemporary artists who create immersive or multisensorial works, or art projects that require audience participation. In addition, we will think together about artworks that are conventionally visual to understand how even more traditional works can communication and open up multisensorial possibilities for the viewer. This course emphasizes being in museum spaces and spending time with works of art at Williams and other local museums. Students will also have an opportunity to be in conversation with other specialists from these institutions, to learn first-hand about topics like cutting-edge approaches to curating multimedia art for diverse audiences or using digital storytelling to make museum collections more accessible. Artists discussed range from billboards by Korean-American Deaf artist Christine Sun Kim to Jacolby Satterwhite's immersive installations that engage queer theory; Wolfgang Laib's pollen \"sculptures\"; James Turrell's sensory immersion installations of light and space; Ernesto Neto aromatic hanging sculptures; and participatory works by Rirkrit Tiravaniha, Carsten Höller and EJ Hill, to name just a few, as well as Jeffrey Gibson's installation and performance series on view at MASS MoCA winter 2025.

This course will explore concepts of divinity in five civilizations in Precolumbian Central America: Aztec, Maya, Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and Nayarit. The course examines how the broad concept of divinity is materialized in everyday life. We will query how the human body is used as the prism through which concepts about humanity, the human soul and the supernatural are perceived and depicted in the art of these civilizations. This is a project based course, and each student will study one or more art objects from these five civilizations, and consider how these objects could be presented in a museum exhibit.

The mass trauma inflicted by the war prompted artists and critics throughout the region to reassess the role and potential of art in society. But the war's mass displacement of communities also displaced the centers for artistic activity, and avant-garde practices soon expanded vigorously throughout the Americas. Through comparative studies, this course will analyze the artistic avant-gardes that emerged simultaneously in the United States and Latin America after 1945. We will place these myriad practices in dialogue, to elucidate the complexity, richness, and vitality of artistic practices in the postwar era.

This course traces Japanese popular culture through a range of visual media: kabuki and puppet theater, premodern and postmodern visual art (ukiyoe, Superflat), classic film (Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kurosawa), manga/comics (Tezuka, Otomo, Hagio), and animation (by Oshii, Miyazaki, and others). We will develop visual reading skills to come up with original interpretations of these works, and compare different media to make them shed light on one another.

With attention to visual and literary ethnography, science fiction, feminist theory, and creative non-fiction, we will contemplate methods of making and inventing in the contemporary world, focusing on the transhistorical and transcultural production of knowledge. Speculative forms of creative production and seminar discussion, as well as some of the most challenging ethical proposals for the future will guide our investigation of artworks, media, and literary production. Climate change, environmental justice, indigeneity, and multispecies interaction will resonate at the political center of this experimental seminar.

From the iconic paintings of Rembrandt and Vermeer to the pictorial reproductions of the plantations in Indonesia and the Americas, we will ask how the visual record of this period has both written and erased the violent histories that are integral to the canon of Dutch painting. The course will begin with the iconoclastic riots in Antwerp in the 1560s and end with the slave revolt in the Dutch Colony of Curaçao in 1795, and throughout we will ask how to tell this history of enslavement and colonialism over two centuries when the voices of the enslaved and colonized were excised from the historical record. [ more ]\n\nARTH 300(F) SEM Experimental Documentary Forms and the Archive\n\nThis course will introduce students to contemporary lens and media-based practices that experiment with the traditional documentary narrative form and archival source materials. We will explore how artists and film-makers critique, expand, and reimagine documentary notions of objectivity, truth and authenticity, and creatively contaminate the form with fiction, self-reflection, performance, and abstraction. Through readings from the fields of visual art/criticism, film theory, and critical archival studies, as well as viewing films in class, we will explore complex debates related to the production of historical knowledge, the politics of the archive and archival practice, issues within documentary photography and film, and the creative possibilities of using traditional and non-traditional lens-based media in historical research. By bringing together a range of exploratory practices, such as strategies of docu-fiction, visual auto-ethnography, and collaboration, we will reflect on the archive and the source document not as a passive collection of material, but as an active and ongoing performance in the construction of historical narratives. This course will broaden student understanding of the history of experimental and alternative film and media practices, and will familiarize students with contemporary discourse on archival and documentary methodologies that aim to question processes of categorization and interpretation related to underrepresented histories and communities.

The course surveys influential definitions of the discipline, the evolving tasks it has set itself, and the methods it has developed for implementing and executing them. Works of art will inevitably enter into our discussions, but the main objects of study will be texts about art as well as texts about methods for an historical study of art. The course is designed to offer a pluralistic perspective on key theoretical and methodological approaches to art history. Readings will regularly compare the Western discipline with frameworks from other parallel cultures.Topics include: style and periodization; iconography, narratology, and phenomenology; the social functions of images and the social history of art; the materiality of art; race, gender, and sexuality; the global scope of art and art history.

They include the idea that art has a history, that style is unique to individuals but also definitive of entire periods or cultures, that interpretation should be contextual, that representation is fundamentally subjective, that art can be an instrument of power, that reception is as much a part of the history of art as production, among many others. This course begins with a series of texts from around 1900, which drew upon nineteenth-century fields such as cultural history, psychology of perception, and psychology of empathy, to articulate the first methodologies of art history. The course then considers the critiques of those methods that emerged in the middle twentieth century from the fields of iconology, marxism, feminism, structuralism, and ethnic studies, among others. The course concludes with a consideration of the current interest in a global history of art from perspectives such as anthropology, curation, phenomenology, aesthetics, new materialism, and \"Bildwissenschaft.\" In this way, it becomes possible to see that the history of art is not merely the sum total of information available throughout the world about art objects, but also a coherent tradition of methodological debate about what are the most effective and responsible ways of writing the history of art.

The first half of the semester involves an immersive look at the urbanism, architectural history, archaeology, and historiography of Teotihuacan, the present-day name of which means, \"Where Men Become Gods,\" in the Mexica (Aztec) language of Nahuatl. The following four weeks of the course will consider those major Ancestral American polities with which Teotihuacan interacted, including Monte Alban, Oaxaca and Tikal, Guatemala, or upon which its legacy exerted influence, including Chichen Itza, Yucatan and Tenochtitlan, Mexico City. The final two weeks of the course will consider comparative settlement and architectural data from Indigenous North and South America. Topics to be addressed over the semester will include the role of space in forging complex ancient societies; criteria for the identification of cities through archaeological remains; definitions of \"complexity;\" economic inequity within and between city-states; and comparative settlement patterns.

How are queer art histories being written and presented? And how is queer art being collected and preserved? We will explore these questions (and others) through the lens of the archive and the research and collecting practices associated with archives. As a class, we will critically examine the role, limits, and possibilities of archives in art historical research, curatorial practice, and museum exhibitions. Course readings will consider various historical, theoretical, and methodological approaches to the archive and curatorial practice. We will also consider artists' archives and what has been described as an \"archival impulse\" in contemporary art. This course is being developed in conjunction with Williams College Museum of Art's presentation of the traveling exhibition Axis Mundo: Queer Networks in Chicano L.A., the first historical exhibition on queer Latinx art. Select assignments and student presentations will encourage first-hand experience with artworks in the exhibition.

We will speculate on the role of the artist, the curator, and the critic as \"host\" in order to foreground how a care-centered and collective approach to knowledge production can run counter to existing power paradigms, such as patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism. Building on existing exchanges between disciplines--from feminist thought, queer theory, disability studies, visual and media studies--this hybrid studio and critical theory course presents contemporary art as a field uniquely suited to imagine alternative structures of institutional support and mutual aid. Through engagement with critical and creative texts, as well as a series of making exercises, we will experiment with practices of care and resource-sharing through art production, and imagine how arts practitioners can take a critical position that counters prevailing logics of individualism and enclosure.

Covering topics ranging from early collection and display methodologies to exhibition-based practice in the current digital era, this tutorial will provide an opportunity for robust discussion about the interactions that have occurred between the arts of Africa and the Western museum over the lengthy history of their engagement. Students will investigate the nature of the cross-cultural dialogues taking place and the politics of display at work in regional museum spaces that display African art towards fleshing out how exhibitions function through the strategic organization and display of objects. Further, students will explore how the dialogues created between objects, individuals, and space often speak to the voices and agendas that collide, collaborate, and even compete with each other within the environment of the museum.

The series generated an enormous amount of media attention, commentary, and controversy when it premiered on PBS in 1973. Today, it is regarded as the origin of so-called \"Reality TV.\" In addition to challenging standard rules for television programming, the show challenged social conventions and asked viewers to think seriously about family relations, sexuality, domesticity, and the \"American dream.\" Documenting the family's life over the course of eight months, the series chronicled the dissolution of the Louds' marriage and broadcast the \"coming out\" of eldest son Lance Loud, the first star of reality television. In this class, we will view the An American Family series in its entirety, research the program's historical reception, and analyze its influence on broadcast and film media, particularly on \"reality\" television. A final 14- to 18-page research paper will be prepared in stages, including a 6- to 8-page midterm essay that will be revised and expanded over the course of the semester.

This seminar explores the critical roles women played as patrons, artists, and collectors of the arts in China, Korea, and Japan. We cover historical periods from the 10th century to the present day and discuss both traditional and nontraditional media including painting, sculpture, photography, and embroidery. Topics include didactic paintings for women in the Song court, calligraphy and painting as gendered modes of expression in Heian period Japan, the revival of Buddhist arts in Korea under the patronage of aristocratic women, and artworks by modern and contemporary artists that contest dominant representations of gender and sexuality. The course does not simply focus on artistic production, but also contextualizes these topics in light of emergent theorizations and readings on femininity, feminism, and the sexual politics of representation. Along with a final research paper, students will generate a substantial Wikipedia entry on a certain aspect of the course to promote the coverage of women and the arts online.

The Mughal Empire was the grandest and longest to rule the Indian subcontinent--much larger than any European empire in the early modern world--and it continued to have a lasting impact on South Asia. Mughals established a centralized administration with a vast complex of personnel, money and information networks. Styling themselves as 'Emperors of Heaven and Earth', the Mughal kings were also globally viewed as political innovators and unprecedented patrons of art. Their visual practices were as much a part of their imperial ideologies as their administrative and military measures. This co-taught course combines the disciplines of Art History and History to explore the intricate workings of Mughal politics and ideologies. The first of its kind to bring an interdisciplinary approach to teaching South Asia at Williams, the course asks: How did the Mughals sustain their empire for three centuries? How did they use art and politics to rule over diverse and largely non-Muslim populations? How did these Muslim imperial patrons merge Persian and Central Asian cultural values with preexisting Indian forms of administrative and artistic expression? How does Mughal culture continue to shape the South Asian imagination today? Readings will include a variety of visual and literary texts. We will delve deep into the world of biographies, travel accounts, poetry, architecture and a plethora of artworks. Students will take a hands-on approach to Mughal painting through several visits to the WCMA and a dedicated Object Lab. The primary aim of this co-taught course is to introduce students to a multifaceted picture of one of the greatest empires in pre-colonial world history. Another goal is to familiarize them with a wide range of visual and written primary sources and develop a vocabulary for 'reading' these.

This course reflects upon this history to understand Berlin's present, its contradictory mix of new and old, \"deep history\" and nostalgia. Often described as an island moored within the communist territory of East Germany during the years of the Berlin Wall, West-Berlin became the city towards which many queer artists, musicians, and activists gravitated in order to avoid the involuntary conscription in the Bundeswehr, as an unexpected outcome of the government's plan to boost population in the former capital. We will focus on the excavation and recognition of inter/cultural positions that challenge German nationalism, at the same time that the country reestablished itself as a world power. Over the semester, we will rethink Berlin with respect to the once nascent geopolitics of the European Union, and the city's social fluctuations and periods of migration as registered through audiovisual and performative forms in advance of and in the decades following the fall of the wall in 1989. Focusing on art, performance, and film, we will examine the architectural, discursive, and cultural spaces in which these forms of creative and political expression take shape--from art museums and theater houses to occupied buildings, from independent publishing imprints and collaborative nonprofit organizations to night clubs. This course will examine the changing city with respect to activism, collectivity, alienation, solidarity, and belonging.

Organized thematically, this course addresses the aesthetics and politics of environmentalism alongside larger debates in the visual arts--including decolonial practices, globalization, conceptualism, collaboration and authorship, aesthetic reception, and the artistic transmission of ideas. We will place particular focus on lens-based and moving-image media practices with respect to the conceptualization of nature, as well as delve into the interrelation of materials and media in our greater cultural reckoning with climate change and environmental justice. Experiential engagement in the forms of screenings, group assignments, and the creation of site-specific and creative works in all media will amplify our art and media historical study of environmental politics in the public sphere. Students will also conduct independent research and essay writing in order to analyze the way we interpret, engage, alter, and mediate the natural world.

The Cold War was therefore \"everywhere and nowhere,\" as new superpowers maneuvered to maintain geopolitical balance. Through a transnational lens this course considers the Cold War in Latin America as an aesthetic phenomenon with many facets, to recover how artistic practices unfolded myriad--and often conflicting--ideas regarding power, cultural influence, modernization, and revolution.

We'll begin with early court diaries and related scroll paintings as examples of \"private\" art. Then we'll move through progressively more public visual media of the 17th through 21st centuries: Kanô screen painting; nô, kabuki, and puppet theater; premodern architecture; popular woodblock prints; turn-of-the-century photography; and finally some examples of contemporary popular culture like comics, animation, and/or film. We will focus on the specificities of each medium while simultaneously developing formal visual reading skills that can work across different media.

Owing both to their portability and status as finely crafted art objects, books have transmitted ideas across the continent, spreading courtly styles of painting from China to India, esoteric Buddhist teachings from Kashmir to Tibet and Mongolia, as well as the Quranic arts of calligraphy and illumination from Islamic South Asia to Southeast Asia. This co-taught seminar will highlight the interwoven history of book arts as it developed and disseminated across different regions of Asia. The course will also introduce students to the major art forms of the book, such as painting, calligraphy and illumination. The aim of the seminar is to understand the book as object while also investigating its content and its larger cultural significance. A number of class meetings will take place in the Chapin Library, where students will have the opportunity to study original manuscripts from the Special Collections. The course will culminate in an exhibition at Chapin Library which the students will curate using the Special Collections holdings.

Factors considered in selecting objects include: the museum's existing collection, its mission, the availability of suitable objects, evaluation of the art historical importance of potential purchases, and the available budget. How can objects be identified and obtained at the most reasonable cost? How do auctions work and what strategies are best for purchasing works at auction? Is it more economical to purchase art at auction or to work with dealers or (for contemporary works) directly with artists? Do museums consider value in the same way as private collectors? What role does an object's history and condition play in the evaluation process? In this course students will work as teams to identify and propose objects for addition to the collection of the Williams College Museum of Art (WCMA). A significant budget will be made available for the acquisition. We will discuss approaches for identification, acquisition and evaluation of objects. Student teams will be responsible for identifying a set of objects that would make appropriate additions to the WCMA collection, and a strategy for acquiring one or more of those objects. Working with the advice of WCMA curatorial staff, one or more of these objects will be acquired using the agreed strategy, and the object will become part of the WCMA permanent collection. Graduate students will participate in all aspects of the class but may be required to undertake different assignments.

Indeed, the classic image of the artist as a brooding, tortured genius of unstoppable creative force finds its roots in the Italian Renaissance, and specifically in the fascinating biography--and mythology--of Michelangelo. With a life and career more fully documented than those of any western artist to precede him, Michelangelo provides the foundations for a triangulation of person-persona-artistic production that has a modern ring. But what are the limits of our knowledge, and what are the boundaries of interpretation? And how might we approach the study of an artistic self when that self is, also, a work of art? In this course, students will become well-acquainted with the life and work of Michelangelo, giving critical attention to the connection between the artist and his work. We will investigate, in particular, the practice of interpreting his work according to his philosophical outlook, political convictions, religious beliefs, sexual desire, and more. While this course will bring us deep into the life and work of a single artist, one of its goals is to generate ideas about the very act of biographically-based art historical interpretation. How can thinking carefully about Michelangelo reshape our own thinking about art historical practice? [ more ]\n\nARTH 331 TUT Michelangelo: Self and Sexuality\n\nLast offered Spring 2021\n\nWho are artists? We each have different answers to this question, but our responses would probably share some common assumptions about human individuality and the centrality of the self to artistic creation. In this tutorial, we will take a critical lens to these ideas by studying the life, work, and passions of the Italian artist, Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564). Michelangelo is a towering archetype of the autonomous artistic self: the distinctive personality who telegraphs individual beliefs, feelings, and desires through the creative act. His lifelong engagement with the physicality, beauty, and sensuality of the (male) human body has encouraged the connection between the man and his work on the most intimate levels of pleasure and desire. Ironically, Michelangelo would not have understood our modern conceptions of artistic selfhood or sexuality, but his own Renaissance moment was obsessed with questions surrounding the nature of human identity and subjectivity. His artistic practice--from painting to poetry--wrestles with them in countless, fascinating ways. Students' writing and critical conversation will venture into the spaces between man and myth, selfhood and self-fashioning, artist and patron, past and present.
