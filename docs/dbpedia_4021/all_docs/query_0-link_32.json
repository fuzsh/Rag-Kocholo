        "text": "Type: Endowed\n\nDonor:\n\nAlison and George Gratton\n\nEstablished: 2020\n\nAlison Gratton graduated from JBU in 1987 with a degree in broadcasting and then received a pharmacy degree from the University of South Carolina in 1994. She currently works as an inspector with the South Carolina Board of Pharmacy after working for many years as a retail pharmacist. George Gratton earned his GED in 2005 after spending 22 years just one credit short of his diploma. He then received an associate's degree in 2007 and an A.A.S. in HVAC/R in 2013 from Midlands Technical College. He currently works as a commercial HVAC technician.\n\nGeorge and Alison met and fell in love in elementary school, but took the scenic route before getting married in 2001. They love their cats, their home and their families. The Grattons also love when God uses them to help others and hope this scholarship will make a Christ-centered education more accessible to more people.\n\nAlison's parents, Ronald and Sandra Barber, were amazing Christian parents and good stewards of their money. This scholarship is a way to honor their legacy.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: David and Bernadine Teague\n\nEstablished: 2009\n\nAndrew Teague was born in 1906. His memories of the Great Depression created a desire to be in control of his own destiny. Andrew received an Engineering degree from Oklahoma State University, and his younger sister and brother also earned degrees. While training in California for World War II, he saw the growth opportunities and relocated his family there after the war. Those around Andrew respected his education and community service.\n\nHis wife, Nora Belle Thornberry Teague, was also influenced by the Depression and taught school in the Ozarks with only a high school education. They both encouraged their children in every aspect of learning. David, Andrew and Nora’s son, remembers Sunday School in their front yard and Vacation Bible School in the back pasture, because there were no churches nearby. Later, Andrew’s faith became more personal, and he reveled in sharing Jesus with his Sunday School class or helping in ministry.\n\nDavid, who after his parents’ death began to truly appreciate his heritage, created this scholarship in their memory.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Barbara and John Bragg\n\nEstablished: 2007\n\nBarbara and John Bragg were married on June 3, 1963. Barbara was raised in Farmington, Arkansas while John grew up in Fayetteville. John graduated from the University of Arkansas, and Barbara graduated from John Brown University. She remembers her family taking weekend drives to Siloam Springs and driving through the campus. She decided as a child that she would attend JBU. Barbara spent her career as an elementary school teacher, while John worked as a rural mail carrier and a farmer. They have 2 daughters, Gladys Strickland and Becky Hall, and 3 grandsons: Jonathan Strickland, Austin Hall, and Eric Hall. When asked why she was interested in supporting students with an endowed scholarship, Barbara replied, \"I had to work when I attended JBU. I know what it means to have someone willing to help financially. I want to return the favor.\" The Bragg's desire for this scholarship was to help provide financial assistance for students majoring in Elementary Education. These students will then educate the youth of our country to be sincere Christian witnesses.\n\nJohn passed away in 2012 and Barbara in 2014, but their legacy lives on.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor:\n\nInternational Entertainment Buyers Association (IEBA)\n\nEstablished: 2011\n\nFounded in 1970, IEBA (International Entertainment Buyers Association) is the leading trade organization for live entertainment industry professionals. IEBA established its Educational Outreach Fund in 2017. To date, IEBA has permanently endowed more than $1,000,000 in scholarships at universities across the U.S. and, in 2018, awarded more than $50,000 through these endowments and other scholarship programs. Barry Jeffrey is the Fund’s first President. Jeffrey has devoted nearly twenty years to IEBA's board of directors. His strong belief in the next generation of entertainment industry leaders drives his tireless fundraising. It is most fitting that IEBA honors Jeffrey's contributions to the organization and the industry by creating the Barry Jeffrey/IEBA Endowed Scholarship at his alma mater, JBU.\n\nBarry Jeffrey joined the William Morris Agency, now known as WME, in 1990. He is one of four agents who book the entire WME roster for festivals, fairs, private, and corporate engagements. During his tenure at WME, Barry has also been co-responsible agent for several clients and continues to serve in that capacity for Brad Paisley, Josh Turner, The Oak Ridge Boys, and others. He was made a partner at the agency in 2018.\n\nBarry majored in Broadcasting at John Brown University. He is a member of the Country Music Association, Academy of Country Music, NARAS, Gospel Music Association, and served as a Past Chairman of the Board for IEBA. The association has presented Jeffrey with “Talent Agent of the Year” and the prestigious “President’s Award.”\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Jerry and Susie Wilson\n\nEstablished: 2014\n\nJerry and Susie Wilson created this scholarship in grateful memory of Bill Berry, and in recognition of his integrity, commitment to excellence, blend of talents, courage, optimism, leadership, and his deep faith in God. Bill Berry and Jerry Wilson were President and Executive Vice President respectively of Titan Specialties, Ltd., a manufacturer of oilfield perforating products, based in Pampa, Texas. Along with Clarence Marak, they were owners of the company until selling it in 2007. Bill was unquestionably the heart and soul of Titan and it was Jerry’s privilege to work alongside him, and be wind beneath his wings. Bill was the ultimate encourager. He understood well that people may not remember what you say, but they will remember how you made them feel.\n\nJerry and Susie Wilson are ardent supporters of local, national, and international ministries. While they are committed supporters of conservative causes such as life before and after birth, their over-arching passion is following Christ, helping grow God’s kingdom on earth, and serving the local church. Jerry C. Wilson is a native and long-time resident of Pampa, Texas. His career included public practice as a CPA, serving as CFO of a chain of discount centers, and founding a chain of retail stores, and Executive Vice President of Titan. Susie Wilson grew up in Overland Park, Kansas. Susie and Jerry met and married while students at Texas Tech University, where Jerry earned his Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Accounting, and Susie earned her Bachelor of Music degrees. In 2006, she earned a Doctorate in Choral Conducting from the University of North Texas.\n\nThe Wilsons raised their children in Pampa, Texas. While Jerry pursued entrepreneurial business ventures, Susie was a fulltime homemaker while also serving as pianist at First Baptist Church, maintaining a private voice studio, and performing as an area soloist. She became the assistant choir director at Pampa High School after the children were grown. She has sung with the Dallas Symphony Chorus since 2001, performing multiple times in Carnegie Hall with the DSC, and with famed conductor Robert Shaw. In 2014, the Wilsons celebrated 50 years of marriage. They are the parents of three adult children: Kim Stevens (B.S. Ed. ’93) and husband, Kenny, of Waco, Texas; Chris Wilson and wife, Erin, of Lubbock, Texas; and Greg Wilson and wife, Michele, Wake Forest, North Carolina; ten grandchildren, and one great grandchild. Now living in Dallas, Jerry and Susie love traveling domestically and internationally, and have seen much of the world together. They are involved in their churches in Dallas, Texas, and Scottsdale, Arizona, where they reside in the winter.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Bill and Judy Pollard's family\n\nEstablished: 2007\n\nThis scholarship was created in honor of Bill and Judy Pollard by their family. Bill and Judy attended Wheaton College in Wheaton, Illinois, and Bill received a J.D. from Northwestern University School of Law and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. Bill and Judy are the parents of four children, Julie, Chip, Brian, and Amy, and the proud grandparents of 15 grandchildren. From 1963-1972, Bill practiced law, specializing in corporate finance and tax, and from 1972 to 1977 served on the faculty and as a Vice President of Wheaton College. After Wheaton College, Bill served in various roles, including Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of ServiceMaster for 30 years. He is also the author of two books, The Soul of the Firm and Serving Two Masters? Reflections on God and Profit.\n\nJudy has spent much of her life caring for others, including her children, grandchildren, parents, and friends. She has been active in her local church and in her neighborhood. Together they have sought to serve Christ through their work, family, church, and community and have been a wonderful example to their children and grandchildren.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Bill and Mary Eva George\n\nEstablished: 2007\n\nWhen a young man from Pennsylvania graduated from JBU in 1948 by the name of Bill George, no one could have known that his relationship with the university was only beginning. Since that day, Bill’s life was intertwined with the university’s work, both personally and professionally. After receiving his JBU diploma, Bill stepped away from JBU briefly to serve the Department of State in the Foreign Service Division. Just two years later, he began a long tenure of employment working at JBU-owned radio stations in California and Oklahoma. He also consulted at JBU stations in Texas, Florida, and Missouri. For most of his career – 40 years of it – Bill worked with JBU organizations in California. In addition to his radio work, Bill also worked with Brown Military Academy, Southern California Military Academy, the western operations of John Brown Schools, and the John Brown Schools Foundation.\n\nLong-time friends of founder John Brown and his family, Bill and his wife Mary Eva took a personal interest in the university community that goes beyond employment. They frequently hosted students in JBU’s Sound Generation in the 1960s and 1970s as the group traveled through California. Bill lent his leadership and expertise to JBU’s development office and served as a consultant to the university from early 1990 through 2008. Throughout his life, Bill had an interest in serving his community as well as JBU. They volunteered with civic organizations, served on a number of boards, and faithfully gave their time to the churches which they called home. He received a number of awards and honors, including an honorary doctorate degree from JBU in 1998.\n\nIn 1994, Bill had the privilege and great responsibility of serving as JBU’s interim president before the arrival of President Lee Balzer later that year. Bill passed away in October of 2008. John Brown University’s Bill George Arena, constructed in 2010, is named in his honor and memory.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Jim and Marilyn Holliday\n\nFriends and family\n\nEstablished: 2011\n\nJulia Holliday got her nickname, “Billie” from the Billiken doll that was popular in the years before her birth. At the age of 7, Billie moved from Center Point, Iowa to Siloam Springs in 1919 as Southwestern Collegiate Institute, later to become John E. Brown College and finally John Brown University, was beginning. Billie’s mother, known as Aunt Elsie on campus, was the sister of John E. Brown Sr. and had moved with her children to work with her brother in the beginning years of the college. In those early years, Aunt Elsie and her children, including Billie, lived in the Sager Cabin which is still on the JBU campus. Billie grew up on campus and attended John E. Brown College.\n\nYears later, while living in Long Beach, California, Billie’s husband passed away suddenly leaving her with two young children to raise on her own. Her uncle, John E. Brown Sr., offered her a position managing the JBU cafeteria. In 1950, she moved back to Siloam Springs. From 1950 to 1978 Billie managed the JBU Cafeteria. At that time the cafeteria was in the basement of the California Dormitory and later moved to its present location. During those years Billie and her staff gained quite a reputation for the food they prepared. Alumni still remember the fried chicken and pecan pie served for Sunday dinner. She was also known for the fancy buffets that she prepared for special occasions on and off campus. Not only did she touch the lives of everyone she and her crew fed, but she had an impact on the students who worked in the cafeteria and dishroom. One former student wrote: “Billie gave me my first job, washing pots in the old California dorm cafeteria. I worked for her for over two years, and I can honestly say that I have been forever changed by the experience. She taught me about responsibility, about integrity, about being part of a team, and about having fun at work. She taught me that you can both love and fear a boss at the same time. She gave me confidence that I could please a tough supervisor (and we all knew that she was tough). I guess mostly, Billie taught me self-discipline. Without that, you don’t finish college, go to graduate school, or succeed in a career.”\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Anonymous\n\nEstablished: 2007\n\nBorn November 7, 1918, Mr. Graham was reared on a dairy farm in Charlotte, North Carolina. In the fall of 1934, at age 16, Mr. Graham made a personal commitment to Christ through the ministry of Mordecai Ham, a traveling evangelist, who visited Charlotte for a series of revival meetings. Ordained in 1939 by a church in the Southern Baptist Convention, Mr. Graham received a solid foundation in the Scriptures at Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College in Florida). In 1943 he graduated from Wheaton College in Illinois and married fellow student Ruth McCue Bell. After graduating from college, Mr. Graham pastored the First Baptist Church in Western Springs, Illinois, before joining Youth for Christ, an organization founded for ministry to youth and servicemen during World War II. He preached throughout the United States and in Europe in the immediate post war era, emerging as a rising young evangelist. Mr. Graham once said: \"My one purpose in life is to help people find a personal relationship with God, which, I believe, comes through knowing Christ.” Billy Graham took Christ literally when He said in Mark 16:15, “Go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to every creature.” Mr. Graham has preached the Gospel to more people in live audiences than anyone else in history—nearly 215 million people in more than 185 countries and territories—through various meetings, including Mission World and Global Mission. Hundreds of millions more have been reached through television, video, film, and webcasts.\n\nRuth Bell Graham was born in China. Her parents were medical missionaries at a small hospital compound 300 miles north of Shanghai. As a young girl in the compound, Ruth first sensed the great calling to abandon all for the sake of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. She spent her childhood on China’s mission field with her parents and siblings, surrounded by disease, despair, and the eventual disorder and chaos of civil wars. The suffering she observed only strengthened in her the conviction of people’s need for the Savior. Until her early adult years, she dreamed of serving as a single missionary in a far corner of the world—the mountainous nation of Tibet. In the fall of 1937, she enrolled at Wheaton College, outside Chicago, Illinois, and three years later was introduced to Billy Graham. Shortly after their graduation from Wheaton, the two were married in Montreat, NC, on August 13, 1943. Ruth passed away in 2007 and Billy died in 2018.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Family and Friends of Caroline Brown\n\nEstablished: 2005\n\nFrom 1948 to 1979, Ella Caroline Trahin Brown served the John Brown University family faithfully as the President's wife. She married John E. Brown Jr., son of JBU founder John E. Brown Sr., in 1941. They were married for 63 years and 31 of those years she spent as first lady of JBU. Caroline was a lifetime resident of Siloam Springs, graduated from Siloam Springs High School and from JBU in 1947 receiving a BA in English. Her son, John E. Brown III, said that he and his sisters watched their mother interact with different types of people while they were at JBU, and she treated them all the same way. \"She's your best friend even if you've just met her. She makes you feel comfortable no matter who you are,\" he said. Caroline Brown's legacy goes beyond her impact on people at JBU. She was also significantly involved in the community of Siloam Springs.\n\nMrs. Brown earned an associate degree in nursing from the University of Arkansas in 1974 and later completed the requirements for a license in Social Work. She became Director of Patient Services at Siloam Springs Memorial Hospital and retired (the second time) in 2000 following 26 years of service. In 2000, Mrs. Brown was recognized with a Pioneer Citizen Award by the Siloam Springs Chamber of Commerce. She was presented the Dr. Frist Humanitarian Award by Quorum Healthcare in 1986. Caroline Brown passed away in 2005.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Estate of Carrie Sliger\n\nEstablished: 2009\n\nThis scholarship was created by an estate gift from Carrie B. Sliger. Carrie grew up near Palestine, TX, and lost her mother when she was 2 years old and her father when she was 18 years old. Carrie was one of 10 children, 9 of which preceded her in death. She approached a bank to borrow $50 so that she could attend JBU. The banker thought for a while and then gave her the money to attend JBU as a gift, not as a loan. Carrie attended JBU high school and came to college at JBU and graduated in 1935 with a 2- year degree (all that JBU offered at the time). One of Carrie’s greatest memories of John Brown University is sitting at the Founder’s feet in the California Dorm lobby. She accepted the Lord there in front of the fireplace. The title of his talk was “Nothing but Leaves.”\n\nCarrie later earned a Masters Degree in Education in Tempe, Arizona. She taught 2nd grade for 4 years in Oklahoma and then taught in the Andalucía Independent School District in Phoenix from which she retired after more than 40 years of teaching. She lived in the Phoenix neighborhood where she taught and was known around the community by the families as “Ms. Sliger, the 2nd grade teacher who cared deeply for students.” Carrie created this scholarship to help other qualified students with financial need as she was helped.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Family and friends of the Gehron family\n\nEstablished: 1982\n\nClyde Gehron believed in John Brown Senior’s philosophy on teaching. He agreed that training the youth is the very best investment that can be made. Clyde believed that the best education is training youth by experience in whatever vocation they choose and to encourage them to live their lives as Christians.\n\nClyde was a JBU grad who studied agriculture. He served in the Navy and traveled to the Pacific, South America, and Alaska. One of his most interesting happenings since his time at JBU was building two nurseries where he grew 1 billion pine trees and planted over 1 million acres in Louisiana. He was a charter member of the Dean’s Association in 1990, which was formed to ensure appropriate recognition of those persons who have shared significantly in furthering the spiritual and academic goals of the University.\n\nClyde’s brother Vernie and his wife Helon also contributed to this scholarship. Vernie received a B.S. in Mechanical engineering from JBU and went on to be the President of G and R Consultants Inc. and APEX Printing and Envelope Co. He served in the Air Force Material Command all throughout WWII. He met and married his wife, Helon, while at JBU. He also enjoyed studying under Ben Ward who greatly influenced his life by being one of the smartest professors and Christian men that Vernie knew. He was thankful for the many life-long friends he made while at JBU. He was especially thankful to John E. Brown who provided him an opportunity to receive a college education even though he was a poor, young farm boy. He and his wife also became charter members of the Dean’s Association in 1990.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: The Charles H. Stout Foundation\n\nEstablished: 2009\n\nCharles H. \"Chick\" Stout's noted career in newspapers and printing-related industry spanned more than half a century. Born in Winterset, Iowa, the fourth oldest in a family of six boys, he worked his way to a degree in accounting at the University of Iowa, as a Linotype operator at the University Press. After graduation, he became an instructor in newspaper management at the University. In 1927, he co-authored the book The Business Department of School Publications with Harry S. Bunker and future pollster, George H. Gallup.\n\nCharles served as Vice President and Sales Manager for Matrix Contrast Corporation in New York, and served during World War II as a U.S. Navy Commander in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters.\n\nIn 1948, college friend Bunker, then General Manager of Speidel Newspapers, recruited Stout to serve as Assistant General Manager of the Colorado Springs, Colorado headquarters of the eight-newspaper group. In 1957, Stout was named Publisher of the Nevada State Journal and Reno Evening Gazette and Vice President of Speidel. He became President of the Transcontinental group in 1964 and continued to serve as a Director and Chairman of the Executive Committee until his retirement in 1976 when Speidel merged with Gannett Co., Inc. This scholarship was created to support journalism majors at JBU.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Family of Chong-Nock Lee\n\nEstablished: 2016\n\nThe Chong-Nock Lee Endowed Scholarship was created in honor of Chong-Nock Lee by his family. Mr. Lee was born in Gongju, South Korea in 1929, and graduated from Seoul National University in 1949 with an agricultural engineering degree. Mr. Lee and his wife, Moohee, are the parents of five children­­: Wonwoo, Choonwoo, Minwoo, Eunkyoung, and Chunwoo and the grandparents of 8 grandchildren. His eldest grandchild, Ted Song, has been teaching engineering at JBU since 2012.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1994, Mr. Lee served in public schools in South Korea as an English teacher and school administrator. He particularly enjoyed being a school principal as he was committed to creating better teaching-learning environments for teachers and students. His love for education greatly impacted his children and grandchildren, leading two of his children to public school teaching careers and one of his grandchildren to a college teaching career.\n\nAfter his retirement and until his death in 2016, Mr. Lee focused his time on writing and encouraging others to follow God. His life verse was 1 Thessalonians 5:16-18: “Rejoice always; pray without ceasing; in everything give thanks; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.”\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Joe Zimmerman\n\nHerb and Jane Zimmerman\n\nClaude Zimmerman Jr.\n\nRichard and Anne Ruble\n\nMargaret Arnold\n\nEstablished: 1995\n\nJoe Zimmerman created the Claude R. and Blanche A. Zimmerman Memorial Endowed Piano Scholarship in memory of his parents. Claude and Blanche were married on August 14, 1919 after Claude’s return from U.S. military duty in France at the end of World War I. They settled in Byron, a small town in northwestern Oklahoma where Claude worked as a blacksmith, sharpening plow shears and discs used by farmers in the area to cultivate the soil for the production of crops such as wheat and alfalfa. Due to a meager income, the family had only bare necessities for living. The Great Depression was difficult for everyone, but it taught outstanding qualities. Unsophisticated, humble Christians who were faithful in church attendance, the Zimmermans were always willing to use some of their modest financial means to help those in need in their community as well as those spreading the gospel of Christ on the mission field.\n\nClaude and Blanche had four sons, Claude Jr., Robert, Herbert, and Joe. Although Blanche had only a high school education and Claude terminated his education after eighth grade, they were very encouraging when three of their sons expressed interest in earning bachelor degrees. Claude Jr. obtained a bachelor’s degree and master’s degree in Civil Engineering which enabled him early in his career to obtain a job at NASA where he worked until retirement. Robert had a 22-year career in the U.S. Air Force servicing aircraft. Herbert graduated from JBU with assistance from a GI Bill®. Joe graduated from JBU, with considerable help from a JBU academic scholarship. Years later, after Joe had earned a doctorate and was serving on the JBU faculty, Claude and Blanche gave financially to help a deserving music student.\n\nThe Zimmermans had a great sense of humor. Claude took great delight in telling jokes and relating humorous stories he had read in Reader’s Digest. Blanche had a hearty and infectious laugh. They not only had a profound influence on their sons, they also enriched all the lives they touched.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Clinton Fowler\n\nFriends and family\n\nEstablished: 1984\n\nClinton H. Fowler was born into a large farming family in Missouri in 1921, the youngest of 13 children. He was the first of his siblings to attend college, JBU, where he was able to work his way through college. It was at JBU that Clint met and married his wife, Jean Anne Barkley. While at JBU, Clint studied radio broadcasting and aviation. He was also a pilot for Dr. John E. Brown Sr. and worked for KUOA, a radio station licensed to Siloam Springs, Arkansas, from 1947 to 1951, while attending JBU. Jean Anne was a music major and a member of the original Triple Trio.\n\nWhen WWII began, Clinton joined the US Army Air Corps and taught young men to fly. While he was overseas, his first son, Clint Jr. was born. After the war, his family moved back to Siloam Springs where Clint began working for JBU. In Siloam Springs his daughters, Deborah and Andrea were born. His work with JBU moved him out to Long Beach, California where his daughter, Jonnye Faye, was born. Out in California, beginning in 1951, he went to work as Vice President and General Manager of KGER, a radio station in Long Beach, CA. He worked in this capacity for more than three decades.\n\nIn 1983, his wife went home to be with the Lord. It was after his wife died that Clint created a memorial to her in the form of an endowed scholarship. When Clint died in 2002 his children wished to honor him and his broadcasting career by including his name on the scholarship.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Col. Kenneth W. Patrum\n\nPeter N. Stathis\n\nEstablished: 2005\n\nThis scholarship was created in honor of Colonel Kenneth Patrum. Kenneth Walter Patrum, a retired attorney and Lt. Colonel in the US Air Force Reserve, was a long-time resident of the District of Columbia. However, as a native of Springfield, Missouri, Mr. Patrum spent his formative years in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Siloam Springs, Arkansas. Before Kenneth finished high school his parents passed away. Determined to earn his high school diploma, Kenneth heard about a school in Northwest Arkansas where he could work half of the day at the school to pay his expenses and attend classes the other half. That school was John Brown in Siloam Springs.\n\nWith his high school diploma in hand, he moved to Washington, DC in 1930 and pursued an undergraduate degree at George Washington University and at the Benjamin Franklin University. He earned a J.D. degree in law from American University and was a long-time member of the District of Columbia Bar Association. Drafted as a Private in the armed forces during World War II, Col. Patrum continued to serve for many years afterwards in the US Air Force Reserve. He was also employed by the Washington Gaslight Company, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Central Intelligence Agency. He attended S. Albans Episcopal Church and served many years as a member of the Ushers Guild. His wife of 49 years, Elizabeth Thompson Patrum of Warrenton, Virginia, passed away in 1991. Col. Patrum passed away in 2010.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Family and Friends of David Brooker\n\nEstablished: 1993\n\nDavid Scott Brooker's desire was for students to become light and salt in the marketplace; always placing people and their needs first. It is in this spirit that the family and friends of David Scott Brooker created this scholarship. He believed a compassion for excellence and steadfastness in all one does was as important as marketplace success. David attended Siloam Springs High School and then worked his way through JBU as a radio announcer and Sports Information Director for JBU. He graduated magna cum laude in 1980, completing degrees in radio/TV Broadcasting and English. It was at JBU that he met his wife, fellow student Amy Garber Brooker. He also played intramural basketball and city league basketball all 4 years.\n\nDavid began his career in marketing for Long John Silver's the summer he graduated from JBU and worked his way up the corporate ladder in a relatively short period of time. At the age of 31, he was made a vice president in the Kentucky Fried Chicken division of Pepsico in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1992, he returned to Siloam Springs as a marketing consultant for Outreach Publications and the Campaign Manager for Mike Huckabee in Huckabee’s US Senate race.\n\nThat spring, David was diagnosed with multiple brain tumors. All his personal and professional achievements paled in comparison to the passion and spirit with which David confronted death--his greatest challenge. David’s favorite Bible verse was I Peter 5:6.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Estate of Dorothy Jelley\n\nEstablished: 2008\n\nDorothy Evelyn Jelley began her quite remarkable life in England on October 12, 1914. As a young woman, she joined the Women’s Royal Naval Service (WRNS), during WWII. She was in charge of a kitchen that provided food for the servicemen and women. After the war, a friend persuaded Dorothy to join her in emigrating to Canada. Dorothy said she made her decision more or less on the spur of the moment and accompanied her friend. Things were difficult in England after the War, and Dorothy thought Canada might be better. After her arrival, she discovered that she had Tuberculosis and spent time in a sanitarium to recover. While there, she enrolled in bookkeeping classes and became so proficient that she was hired by the sanitarium to do its bookkeeping.\n\nLater, she immigrated to the U.S., became a U.S. citizen and worked for a businessman in Washington, D.C. She later moved to Long Beach, California where she worked as the chief bookkeeper for a firm in Los Angeles. She was very interested in Missions and Bible study.\n\nAlthough she was colorblind, she became accomplished in needlework, both sewing and embroidery. She made several trips back to England to visit friends and family. A trip to Australia was one dream that went unfulfilled. She was a faithful Christian, full of kindness, warmth and humor and always with a glint of mischief in her eyes. Dorothy believed that “anything worth doing was worth doing well.” Dorothy was never able to visit the campus and her only connection was the radio ministry of JBU’s founder, Dr. John Brown Sr.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Alumni\n\nEstablished: 1983\n\nDorothy Woodland was a pilgrim in life. From working on the World War II’s top-secret Manhattan Project to preparing many young students for the challenges of the field of science, Woodland challenged the norms of her day. Dorothy graduated with an undergraduate degree from the College of Wooster in Ohio and received her Doctor of Physical Chemistry degree at Ohio State University. She then launched into a life dedicated to teaching and spent the first 30 years of her career teaching at JBU from 1944- 1974. She served as a professor as well as Academic Dean and was heavily involved with many of the artistic productions on the JBU campus. She believed in her students and they knew it. Dorothy passed away in 1999.\n\nDr. Irvin A Wills is one of the dominant figures of JBU history. He was a professor of biology here from 1935-1974, and head of the Biology Department for about half those years. Wills’ educational background included a bachelor’s of science from Wheaton College, and master’s and doctorate degrees from the State University of Iowa. He was the sponsor of the Science Club for several decades, which made numerous field trips each year and hosted campus activities. Wills also served as Academic Dean from 1940-1955. In those days before computer registration, one student remembers that this involved writing out a note card for each student in each class, spreading them out all over a wall, and rearranging the cards until all needs were met and seats were filled! Wills was more than suited for these tasks. He had an incredibly sharp mind and consistently strove to learn more about this world. When he found items of interest in magazines or other reading materials, he would remove the article in question and place it in a scrapbook for future reference, or make illegible scribbles in one of his many notebooks. Students who worked with him marveled at how he could always direct them through his piled-up collections to the exact article he needed to reference. Irvin Wills died around 1983.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor:\n\nAnonymous\n\nEstablished: 2005\n\nThis scholarship is created in honor of Dr. Gary Guinn, the 2006 Distinguished Professor of English at John Brown University.

At the height of the depression in 1933, Fred began his studies at John Brown University, having watched the institution mature through his teenage years. When he graduated with a science degree in 1937, Fred stayed for one year to teach. With support from JBU, he then went to Texas A & M to pursue a mechanical engineering degree. While in Texas, Fred met Laverne and they were married during the Christmas season of 1941, just after Fred finished his degree. They immediately went to a war-time assignment with the Wright Aeronautical Company in Cincinnati, Ohio. Fred was intimately involved in the production engineering of the Liberty engine which was famous for its reliability and for its service as prime mover of the P-38. While the Olneys were in Ohio, their first son, Fred Paul, was born.\n\nIn the summer of 1945, as the war effort was ending, the Olneys stopped at JBU on their way back to Texas. Anticipating a great influx of students from returning armed forces personnel, Dean Irwin Wills made Fred an offer to stay and teach. He stayed, holding the position until his retirement in 1978. Fred earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at the University of Arkansas in 1958, thus encouraging JBU’s faculty to pursue advanced degrees in engineering. He was the chairman of the engineering division from 1961 through 1976. The Olneys’ other two children were born in Siloam Springs, Robert in 1946 and Rosanne in 1949. All three children graduated from JBU.\n\nOver his long tenure at JBU, Fred added several other credentials to his teaching portfolio. In 1951, Fred became a Professional Engineer and founded Siloam Engineering Services. Fred became a Registered Land Surveyor in 1965 and for many years ran a successful surveying business employing many student assistants. He was the first head of the engineering division at John Brown University and assisted the division as it made the transition in the early 1960s from technology to a modern engineering emphasis. He served the University for 33 years. After retirement, Fred revived his business and fulfilled many surveying needs in the area, especially for the city of Siloam Springs.

Gary directs the Center for Relationship Enrichment, an endowed center at John Brown University, is a Professor of Psychology and Practical Theology and is a nationally known speaker and author who has been victorious over several bouts with cancer. The Olivers lost their son, Matt, in May 2007. Gary said at Carrie’s memorial service, “Carrie and I didn’t understand why I had all of my cancers, why she was allowed to have cancer…why Matt was allowed to die…But Carrie was clear that the purpose of our life as a couple and her life as an individual was to somehow manifest the difference that Jesus can make in a life and marriage and family, to somehow demonstrate that circumstances don’t determine ultimate reality (even when those circumstances include a deadly diagnosis) and to somehow show that God is not just a promise maker but also a promise keeper.

He served in the U.S. Navy from 1941 to 1945 and received the Navy Unit Commendation Award for outstanding heroism while serving on the USS Salt Lake City. He later retired from Getty Oil after 30 years of service. Mary E. Nicholas was born in 1924 in Mesquite, TX. Her family members were migrant farm workers who worked in Texas, Oklahoma and California. Mary was the oldest of 7 children and helped raise her younger siblings after her mother’s death.\n\nHarold and Mary were married on July 15, 1948 and made their home in CA until 1999 when they moved to Arkansas for retirement. Mary was a devoted homemaker and helpmate to Harold, and was the love of his life. He often referred to her as \"my beautiful bride.\" The Nicholas’ were active members of Southside Freewill Baptist Church. The character of Christ – love, honesty, integrity, diligence, kindness and servitude – was always evident in their day-to-day lives. They lived joyfully together for 61 years, and enjoyed traveling, hunting, fishing, camping and playing dominoes.\n\nNeither Harold nor Mary attended college. In fact, Mary did not attend school as a child. As an adult, she enrolled in a few educational classes, studied and practiced on her own until she could read and write fluently. Helping others achieve an education was very important to Harold and Mary, and this is the primary reason they created this memorial scholarship.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Leland and Ireane Stratton\n\nEstablished: 1988\n\nThis scholarship was created by Leland and Ireane (Brittell) Stratton in honor of their brother-in-law, Mr. Harold C.

Harold came to JBU with his wife, Mildred, in 1927. He was the head of the electrical department and later became head of the production department. He also served on the electrical engineering faculty and as chairman of the university industries in the late 1940’s. During his service at JBU, the electrical department produced cotton choppers, aircraft parts, beet-choppers, and hub-cutting machines to name a few. Harold Ward was a man of many talents and abilities. He was credited for several inventions including a grader that was developed to grade out all of the imperfect rice. A more modern version of his rice grader is still being used all over the world today.\n\nMildred, Ireane's sister, taught high school math at John Brown from 1927 to 1935.

If ever there was a life lived to the fullest in the Lord it was Harriett born to George and Emma Roads in Hinsdale, Illinois. At a very young age, while sitting at her grandmother’s knee, Harriett surrendered her life to Christ, and never relinquished her call to follow. Her life truly personified and exemplified a life of obedience to her Lord and Savior. Inexplicable joy of her faith was always on display and was a cornerstone in every aspect and season of her life. The fruit of the spirit was clearly exhibited through her walk with Him that was offered on a daily basis. The foundation of her steadfast faith was the word of God and prayer that she exercised and strengthened daily in her ceaseless time spent with the Lord. Her sacrificial life of servitude touched lives all over the world through giving, hosting, entertaining, feeding, clothing, sheltering, ministering to countless strangers, family, friends, missionaries, pastors and leaders of the faith who crossed paths with Ms. Harriett. Perhaps it was just for a night or for an extended stay she served with an eternal smile. Whether in person, through letter, service or prayer, no life was the same after encountering her contagious faith.\n\nA 1951 graduate of NYACK college in New York, Harriett found herself back in Chicago knocking on doors in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods sharing her faith and the gospel of Jesus. A season of her life that not only vitalized her faith, but delighted her spirit with fond memories for years. Through ministry, Harriett met her husband, Cliff Dudley, whom she soon married and joined in ministry. With her loyal support and gifted spirit, she embodied the Christian example of a godly woman in marriage, motherhood and family. As Cliff transitioned from Moody Press to starting his own Christian Publishing Company, there was Harriett being the constant pillar of faith and confirming wife of strength. As they moved their family and business to Northwest Arkansas to start New Leaf Press, Harriett transitioned with a devoted spirit of the call to touch eternity through the printed page that Christian publishing could bring. It was the prayers of Harriett that held together and sustained an eventual means of grace that New Leaf Press became.\n\nAge never tripped up Ms. Harriett, as she worked every day up until weeks before her death. She continued in ministry in a plethora of ways, always ready to serve, pray and share her faith. She always marveled in what God was doing and what He had done. She faithfully followed Jesus and wanted to be a part of what was going on. Harriet, through everything life brought (good and bad) never faltered, failed, nor was ever shaken. Her faith abided in Jesus, always. It was that unwavering faith that touched so many lives and gave encouragement to innumerable souls. Such a beautiful vessel that allowed the Holy Sprit to work with and through to express His eternal love.\n\n“Love the Lord they God with all thy heart, soul and strength. Love they neighbor as thyself.” The two great commandments met and storied through your servant Harriett. “Yes Lord, here am I.”\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Joanna Haspels\n\nEstablished: 2012\n\nAfter graduating from JBU in 1962, Joanna Klock Haspels took her first teaching position on the Navajo Reservation in Kayenta, Arizona.

When Jack returned from the war, his family started an agriculture business in Springdale, AR. This was the start of Springdale Farms, one of the first poultry processing plants in the 1950’s. As the company grew, they built a new plant north of Springdale. About a year later, they met Willard and Pat Walker when the Walkers built a new home on the lot next to Jack and June. It did not take Pat and June long to learn they both loved to play Bridge and started having regular games together. Jack and Willard had so much in common too; a love of horses and farms and the rural life. After both Jack and Willard passed, June and Pat continued to share many hours of friendship. One of the highlights of their time together was dressing up and going to the John Brown University events. Their smiles and laughter were legendary as they enjoyed each other’s company.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Mike King\n\nAlumni\n\nEstablished: 2008\n\nThis scholarship was created in honor and memory of Ken Schoenwald. Ken’s untimely death occurred February 16, 2008 in a car accident which also claimed the life of his 13-year old son, Jace, and one of his daughters, 18-year old Jennalea.

Kent Davis came to know Christ at the age of 12 through his future father-in-law. Kent first heard of John Brown University from an aunt in California who knew John E. Brown Sr. Eager to learn, he traveled to Arkansas with no idea what to major in. With the guidance of Charles Willis, head of the building construction department, he gained interest in this field and graduated in 1963. Kent went on to teach high school math and science, earned his master's degree in civil engineering from the University of Maine, and between work, service to missions, and attending to family life, received his doctorate in civil engineering from Clemson University in 1987.\n\nWhile Kent was teaching high school, he felt the Lord, with a little help from Charles Willis, calling him back to JBU to utilize his skills in teaching building construction. He returned to JBU to teach from 1969 until 1975. He and his wife, Beth, felt another calling--the mission field. This interest led them to serve 2 years with Africa Inland Mission. Then, they determined they could have an even greater impact on missions by training students. They returned to JBU where many students became interested in missions under Kent and Beth's guidance. Kent continued to teach building construction until his retirement in 2004. He received the Outstanding Alumnus award in 1990.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Mr. and Mrs. Frank Kinsman\n\nEstablished: 2015\n\nMr. and Mrs. Frank Kinsman created the Kinsman Family Endowed Scholarship for Engineering Students in gratitude for their experience at John Brown University. Frank and Ednamae came to JBU as a married couple expecting their first child. Frank enrolled as an engineering student and Ednamae became a supporting, full-time mother. Frank pursued an electrical engineering major with dual minors in general engineering and Bible. While Frank had already served in the U.S. Navy, he was not prepared academically for college. To this day Frank continues to be amazed that JBU Admissions, when informed he was lacking in high school math and science, said, “Come on. We’ll tutor you.” They did and he caught up with his classmates as he entered his sophomore year. Frank and Ednamae have never forgotten the care and encouragement they received from administrators, faculty and staff. Frank went into research at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory upon graduation in 1958, then on to Texas Instruments as a systems analyst. After leaving TI, he became Vice President of a small engineering firm before forming his own engineering consulting firm in 1986. Frank and Ednamae have been deeply involved in church ministries all their lives, but their experience at JBU opened doors for ministry, technology advancement and leadership which they never dreamed possible.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor:\n\nBill and Jody Kitchen\n\nEstablished: 2018\n\nKitchen family siblings, Bill Jr., Eric, Renee, and John have chosen to honor their parents, William (Bill) and Rosemary (Rosie) Kitchen through the Kitchen Family Endowed Scholarship. Bill and Rosie’s legacy of love for one another and devotion to Christ began when they met at JBU. Bill and Rosie were direct beneficiaries of John Brown Sr.’s vision to provide a Christ-centered college education to those who could not otherwise afford to attend college. To help pay their tuition, Bill worked as a JBU night watchman and Rosie as a librarian assistant. Rosie earned a Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education in 1952. A few years later, after completing a tour of duty in Korea with the U.S. Army, Bill earned a Bachelor of Arts in Christian Education.

Larry’s mother applied for a payment plan of $25 per month (the balance to be paid later in life). Larry applied to JBU, was accepted, and enrolled in the spring of 1932. That following summer, Larry’s mother wrote and sent $5 telling him not to come home because California was experiencing a depression. However, Larry wanted to go home so he sold his books, two blue shirts and overalls for $7. It took him five days to get home to Los Angeles, making it on $3.50. Now financially able, Larry and his wife Adeline created this scholarship to honor the commitment to John Brown School that his mother made for him sixty-eight years ago.

Lola’s aunt, Bertha Maddux Magouirk, first attended JBU and later, Lola boarded a train for JBU the day after she graduated from high school. As the oldest of six children and with limited resources, Lola worked and took out loans to pay for her education. Her first job at JBU was working in the print shop and she later worked in the business office. Because she was far from her home of Oakwood, Texas, she was never able to return home during her time at JBU. Lola graduated from JBU in 1938 with a degree in journalism. She was very grateful for her JBU education and remembered her time with fondness. Lola created this scholarship to help make a JBU education and experience a reality for other young people.

Luke, along with his oldest friend, tragically lost their lives in a senseless automobile accident when struck by a drunk driver just a few days before Christmas, 2017. He was a Construction Management student at John Brown University. While his time at JBU was short, he immersed himself in campus life. He made and had an impact on many of his friends. Luke was the fifth of his siblings to attend JBU.\n\nThis scholarship has been established to honor and perpetuate his memory and the character qualities which were so vibrantly demonstrated in his life. Those who knew Luke knew that he lived with humility, compassion, joy, reverence, loyalty, and consistency. It is no coincidence that his qualities closely parallel the Fruits of the Spirit, evidences of a maturing Biblical faith found in Galatians 5:22-23. It is our desire that he thus be remembered, and opportunities to attend JBU be made available to others who seek to matriculate at a school that seeks to educate the whole person; Head, Heart, and Hand.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Steve and Jill Mitchael\n\nEstablished: 2009\n\nSteven Mitchael graduated from John Brown University in 1984 with a Bachelor Science in Construction Management.

She graduated from John Brown University in 1963. Previously, while in high school, Martha dedicated herself to foreign missions. She was later introduced to Africa Inland Mission (AIM International) through a missionary kid at JBU. After teaching school in her hometown of St. Louis for two years, she enrolled at Moody Bible Institute for a year of further Bible study. In October 1966, she relocated to Kenya where she was assigned and accepted a position in Kesho’s literature department.\n\nIn 1972, Martha married Bob Munce.

We are glad that God has given us the opportunity to give back to the Lord's work.\"\n\nDr. Netherton began his service at JBU in 1969, completing his Ph.D. in organic chemistry in 1977 from the University of Arkansas. He was Chair of the Division of Natural Science from 1986 to 1997. Dr. Netherton was selected as the JBU Teacher of the Year in 1980 and 1994, the JBU Outstanding Alumnus in 1990 and was awarded the Faculty Excellence Award in 2005.

Dr. Mabel Oiesen, Sarah Williams’ aunt, accepted the invitation by Dr. John Brown Sr. to come to John Brown University from New York City to create a music department because she shared Dr. Brown’s dream for a Christ-centered university. Though the struggles were almost overwhelming, with God’s guidance and her tenacity, a formidable department was created from which many music majors studied and afterwards began lifetime music careers. As the music department grew, the Cathedral Choir was formed. While serving as its conductor, Mabel traveled with the choir extensively across the United States participating in worship services, radio and television programs. A MIGHTY FORTRESS IS OUR GOD became the signature anthem closing every appearance the choir made.\n\nJames L. Williams, Sarah Williams’ late husband, came to JBU to study voice and prepare for full-time music ministry. Sarah studied piano and organ. Both dedicated themselves to full- time ministry and, upon graduation, they formed a music ministry team. Together they served several large churches creating integrated choir programs with Christian education curriculum written by James. He was an engaging man with many talents and skills: professional baritone soloist, choral conductor and clinician, college professor, visionary and developer of large youth choirs, which were on several occasions invited to tour churches in Europe. At the time of his death, it was most apparent that his greatest legacy was the winning of souls through his ministry.\n\nSarah Williams’ career was also a witness of the power of the Lord and the training at JBU. In addition to being a mother of three, an organist, and piano teacher, she has had the great privilege of teaching at Wheaton College in the conservatory of music and becoming its director of the Community School of the Arts. During that time, one program was created between Wheaton College’s music education students and Daystar University students to serve school children in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya. Sarah Williams’ prayer is that this scholarship will underline the power of music and how God can use humble servants to bring honor and glory to Him.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor: Peter and Yvonne Nicolay\n\nEstablished: 2011\n\nThis scholarship was created by Peter and Yvonne Nicolay, who were married in 1949.

The Rosses have 7 children—most of whom have attended or will attend JBU. They have been long term supporters of JBU primarily because JBU’s mission and vision is much like their own. It is Mike and Deann’s goal to have their children realize the breadth of God's creation, discover their own role in it, and be prepared to be successful in that role. They also recognize that JBU has similar goals for its students—realization, discovery, and preparation. The Rosses firmly believe this process must begin with an understanding of who God is and our relationship to Him. This is our central calling— to make Him known and to teach others about Him. Mike and Deann believe that God designated the local church as the venue through which much of this revelation occurs. This motivated the Rosses to create the Preach the Word Endowed Scholarship to help train young men who are called to ministry which makes Christ known and teaches about His love and grace.\n\nType: Endowed\n\nDonor:\n\nDavid and Lynne Moll\n\nEstablished: 2018\n\nThe Psalm 16:11 Endowed Scholarship was created by David and Lynne Moll to help students pursue a Christ centered education at John Brown University.\n\nWhile a student at JBU in 1964, Lynne walked around campus on a beautiful spring day asking God to show her the path of life.
