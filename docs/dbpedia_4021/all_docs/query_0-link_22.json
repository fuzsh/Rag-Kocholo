        "text": "JUST AS VIRGINIA WOOLF was aware of differences among readers, so she was aware of differences among libraries. In “Hours in a Library” (1916), an essay whose title she borrowed from a collection of her father Leslie Stephen’s periodical criticism (1874), she distinguishes between people who read because they love learning and people who read because they love reading. Although the dichotomy is a loose one, her lover of learning is more likely to be a sedentary specialist who reads “on a system” in search of “some particular grain of truth.” Woolf’s lover of reading, whom she calls a “true reader,” is often younger and motivated by “intense curiosity” and open-mindedness. Prone to raids on libraries and secondhand bookstores, a true reader’s reading is like taking “brisk exercise in the open air,” not like sitting in a “sheltered study” (E2 55-7). Although true readers retain knowledge of the literary tradition, with maturity they move adventurously from past to contemporary writers, and thus from secondhand bookstores to shops that stock new publications (E2 59).\n\nWhen Virginia Woolf considers reading in libraries, however, she adds gender to her distinction between types of readers. Institutional libraries, like those of the great English universities, are traditional, protected places designed mainly for the sedentary specialists of her description. A woman may love learning, but her access to such libraries is limited by her sexas the female narrator discovers in A Room of One’s Own (7-8). She may need not only her own private space and sufficient income, but also her own library (Miletic-Vejzovic 4-5). Access to these three necessitiesprivacy, money, and bookssymbolizes and fosters intellectual independence, a woman’s ability to say what she thinks. Although, as Woolf documents in an endnote to Three Guineas (1938), “women were apparently excluded from the British Museum Reading-Room in the eighteenth century” (174 n. 6), the early twentieth-century narrator in A Room of One’s Own goes there unimpeded. Pursuing her research, she is thwarted not by library rules or officials, but by a paucity of information on women and literature. Wryly she contrasts her own frustrated search for truth about women’s poverty with the “grunts of satisfaction” of a sedentary specialist nearby, a man who, trained at Oxbridge, seems to find “pure nuggets” of truth “every ten minutes or so” (28). In the very same British Library Reading Room, Woolf’s Julia Hedge, “the feminist” character in Jacob’s Room (1922), waits for her books and observes that all around the dome are “the names of great men…‘why didn’t they leave room for an Eliot or a Bronte?’” she wonders (JR 106). In both A Room of One’s Own and Jacob’s Room, as Anne Fernald notes, the British Library Reading Room dome is imaged as a “great cultural mind” that is masculine, just another “part of the factory of London” that ignores the individual (106-8). Women might read in the British Library, but its catalogue, available books, and architecture remind them constantly that they live in, and read about, a patriarchy.\n\nVirginia Woolf also worked at the London Library, a private subscription collection founded in 1841 by Thomas Carlyle. Leonard Woolf recalls that she “used it much and was once found to have about 50 books unreturned” (L 501). She continued to use it even after 1935 when she was infuriated by E. M. Forster’s implication that he would have proposed her for the library board had its members not concluded, because of one previous female member (ironically during her father Leslie Stephen’s tenure as president), that “ladies are quite impossible” (D 4 297, D 5 278). Woolf’s relationships with libraries, therefore, often suggest a need for more accessible, egalitarian collections governed by, as well as open to, women readers. No doubt the ambiguities of her own long-standing use of libraries, combined with their lack of respect for and information about women and their work, culminated in her decision in 1938 to lend her name to an endowment fund appeal for the Millicent Fawcett (Marsham Street) library, “the oldest and largest research resource in Britain devoted entirely to the study of women and their achievements” (Pankhurst 1). Woolf used the Fawcett library resources herself when she was doing research for Three Guineas. She sent questions to librarian Vera Douie as well as corresponded with her about the library’s needs and about books written by women that she proposed to buy for the Fawcett collection (Pawlowski). Both she and Leonard sent letters to a number of women asking for their support (Snaith).\n\nResponding to some of the replies, Virginia Woolf continues the discussion of libraries suitable for women readers, especially curious and open-minded lovers of reading. She tells Ethel Smyth, for instance, in a letter written a day before the publication of Three Guineas (1938), that the Marsham Street Library is “almost the only satisfactory deposit for stray guineas, because half the readers are bookless at home, working all day, eager to know anything and everything, and a very nice room, with a fire even, and a chair or two, is provided” (L6 232). These kinds of avid, unspecialized readers not only need a library, but they also need a comfortable one in which they feel welcome. “I owe all the education I ever had to my father’s library,” Virginia Woolf writes to another potential subscriber, “and so perhaps endow libraries with more divinity than I should” (L6 234). “But books have always been so prolific in my life,” she tells yet another correspondent, “that I can’t help being shocked to think that there are those who go without” (L6 236). Indeed, Virginia Woolf actually owned many of the books her narrator in A Room of One’s Own consults in the British Library (Luedeking 2). She knew she did not have to risk, so often as most women, “wetting her pen in bitterness” (JR 106) while reading in an inhospitable setting.\n\nThe Genealogy of the Woolfs’ Personal Library\n\nMany books owned by Leonard and Virginia Woolf were accumulated well before either was born. It is a combined collection of many decades, with a wide variety of volumes added by numerous people at many different times. These bookswith their dedications, bookplates, signatures, inscriptions, and annotationsare like fragments of conversations. They define institutional, intellectual, and emotional networks of relationships among contemporaries as well as among people of different generations.\n\nVirginia Stephen was born in 1882 into a prominent intellectual family of evangelical philanthropists, imperialists, academics, and judges. Her father Leslie Stephen owned, before his daughter inherited them, books written and inscribed to him by his father, Sir James Stephen, among them Essays in Ecclesiastical Biography. Leslie, in turn, inscribed books to his young daughter Virginia, like J. G. Lockhart’s Memoirs of Sir Walter Scott (Miletic-Vejzovic 9, 5) and The Complete Poetical Works (1896) of James Russell Lowell, her godfather. As biographers have established, and as she herself has acknowledged, Virginia Stephen had the run of her father’s personal library. Upon his death in 1904, she inherited his books, more than 1,000 volumes of which remain in the library today (Daugherty 10). Her sister Vanessa moved them to their new home at 46 Gordon Square in Bloomsbury, while Virginia recovered from a mental breakdown at Caroline Amelia Stephen’s home in Cambridge. This aunt’s Quaker Strongholds (1891), inscribed by the author to her niece, is still in the Woolfs’ library. “Certainly books are wonderful things,” Vanessa wrote to Virginia. “Even Ithough you may hook your learned nose at me in disdainafter spending some time grubbing amongst them, get to feel a great affection for the scrubbiest and most backless volume. I suppose it’s from living in a book-loving family. I feel happy and content sitting on the floor in an ocean of calf” (Bell 21).\n\nAmong the books Vanessa moved were ones Leslie Stephen wrote himselfon mountaineering and on English philosophy and literatureas well as his sixty-three annotated volumes of the Dictionary of National Biography (of which he had edited the first twenty-six). Leslie Stephen’s collection included works by William Makepeace Thackeray (his father-in-law by his first marriage), as well as by his friends Thomas Hardy, Henry James, and George Meredith. Leslie Stephen’s library, Beth Daugherty concludes, is “a humanities curriculum in history and political science, philosophy and religion, and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century literature.” She adds, however, that it is a curriculum short on women writers (14). Leslie Stephen did own twenty-four volumes of The Works of George Eliot, as well as a gift copy of The Spanish Gypsy, and he wrote a volume on Eliot for the English Men of Letters Series (Annan 111). A few women writers of the family, in addition to Caroline Emelia Stephen, are also represented among Leslie’s remaining books. For instance, ten books are authored by Leslie’s first wife’s sister, Anne Thackeray Ritchie, one of which is inscribed to him by the author, plus her collected works in eight volumes. Although Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s Aurora Leigh (1873) is also there, inscribed by Robert Browning to Laura Makepeace Stephen (Leslie and Minnie Thackeray’s daughter), most of the volumes in the Woolf library by women writers were added later. Even though his library’s contents were skewed toward masculine points of view, Leslie Stephen made no attempt to confine his daughter to books deemed appropriate for a young woman with a feminine social role to learn. Virginia’s reading, which began with lists her father provided, evolved into reading whatever she liked and making up her own mind about it. Not through conversations experienced among young university men, as Daugherty points out, but through inscriptions to her father and through his own marginalia, Virginia Stephen learned the meaning of membership in “a literary community at work” (14-16).\n\nThrough her father, Virginia Stephen also inherited books her mother Julia Stephen had owned. Virginia’s maternal grandfather, John Jackson, was a doctor in India when Julia was born. Perhaps more prominently, however, the family’s associations, through Julia’s mother Maria Jackson (nee Pattle), were with politicians and especially with artists. Frequenting Little Holland House and Freshwater, the homes of Maria Jackson’s sisters, were important statesmen, writers, painters, and sculptors, among them Gladstone and Disraeli; Tennyson and Thackeray, G. F. Watts, Holman Hunt, and Edward Burne-Jones. “In this environment, Julia grew up, loved and admired, proposed to, painted, and photographed” (Gillespie, “The Elusive” 4-5). Julia married Herbert Duckworth, whom Leslie Stephen later called a “perfect type of public school man” (Stephen, L. 35), who died suddenly prior to the birth of their third child. Duckworth’s books, among them copies of Ovid, Rudyard Kipling, Robert Herrick, Thomas Moore, a book on English universities, one on the Highlands, a New Testament, a novel by J. M. Barrie, and a travel book by Alexander Kinglake, all came into Virginia Woolf’s handsalong with a copy of Charlotte Bronte’s Villette (1855)from her mother through her father (Gillespie, “The Elusive,” 260 n. 15).\n\nIn the Dictionary of National Biography is Julia Stephen’s entry on her aunt, the pioneer photographer Julia Margaret Cameron. Although Julia also published Notes From Sick Rooms (Smith Elder, 1883), she exists among the books Virginia inherited primarily through the volumes she owned. Books expressing conventional sentiments about a woman’s role and religion, like Coventry Patmore’s Amelia, Tamerton Church-Tower (1878), are inscribed to Julia by her mother Maria Jackson. When Virginia Woolf wrote in “Professions for Women” of the woman writer’s need to kill the feminine stereotype that forbade criticism of masculine values, she had on her shelves Patmore’s The Angel in the House, inscribed to her mother by the author (Gillespie, “The Elusive,” 10-11, 260 n. 19-22). Among the books Virginia Stephen inherited, Anne Thackeray Ritchie’s are so well represented, more perhaps because she was a friend of Julia’s than because she was Leslie’s sister-in-law. Ritchie dedicated Miss Angel, about the painter Angelica Kauffmann, to “Mrs. Herbert Duckworth” and inscribed books to Julia and Leslie’s children by their first marriages and, after their marriage, to their first child. James Russell Lowell admiringly inscribed books to Julia, as did George Meredith and Henry James (Gillespie, “The Elusive,” 7-8, 260 n. 16; 12, 261 n. 29; 14-15, 262 n. 36).\n\nAfter their marriage, Leslie and Julia Stephen had four more children, each of whom began receiving and then giving books. Virginia thus inherited books given to various Stephen siblings, among them her brother Thoby, whose gifts or school-prize books, like Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1897), came to her upon his premature death in 1906. Early gifts to Virginia herself, inscribed to her not only by her father but also by other family members and friends like Vanessa and Thoby Stephen, Violet Dickinson, and Madge Vaughan, are also among the books remaining in the Leonard and Virginia Woolf Library.\n\nKk\n\nVirginia Stephen’s books were an appropriate intellectual dowry when she married Leonard Woolf on August 10, 1912. With a background very different from Virginia’s, Leonard was born in London in 1880 to the son of a Jewish “tailor who had done extremely well in his trade,” who, by the time of his death, defined himself as a “gentleman” and who “educated his [seven] sons out of their class” (Woolf, L. Sowing 13-14). His mother’s Jewish family came from Holland, and his prosperous maternal grandfather was a diamond merchant whose ten children pretty much “drained away” their father’s wealth (Woolf, L. Sowing 16). Leonard’s father, Sidney Woolf, was an intelligent, hard-working, and successful barrister and Q. C. He died at age forty-seven, leaving his widow with nine children and a much-reduced income, which she managed with considerable common sense. Leonard’s education at St. Paul’s School and Trinity College, Cambridge, was in the classics, with additional interests in philosophy and literature. An avid reader with access to libraries, Leonard amassed and contributed his own books to what became Leonard and Virginia Woolf’s joint collection. Some of Leonard’s books duplicated ones Virginia already had, and two or more different editions remain in their combined library. Virginia’s bookplate appears, for instance, in the Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, edited by Rev. Walter W. Skeat (1901), and Leonard Woolf has signed the Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, edited by Alfred W. Pollard, et. al. (1898). Robert Burton’s The Anatomy of Melancholy, 8th edition (1676), is inscribed to Virginia by Violet Dickinson and The Anatomy of Melancholy, edited by A. R. Shilleto (1893), is signed by Leonard. Both had editions of Edward Gibbon’s The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Virginia’s twelve-volume 1820 edition was given her by her brother Adrian; Leonard’s is a two-volume 1898 edition. Some books, reflecting Leonard’s reading at Cambridge, range from canonical playwrights like Shakespeare to contemporaries like Bernard Shaw and Henrik Ibsen, and from novelists like Henry Fielding to George Meredith (Woolf, L. Sowing 162-71). Because of his seven years as a colonial administrator in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the combined library contains many books belonging both to Leonard and to his sister Bella Sidney Woolf on that country. The 1784, seventy-volume edition of the complete works of Voltaire which Leonard had taken with him to Ceylon (Woolf, L., Letters, 107 n. 1), remains in the combined Woolf library. Leonard’s developing political interests also are reflected in many books on English imperialism, Fabian and Labor Party politics, and international government. Books on Judaism, and Bibles (mostly Old Testaments) were also likely contributed by Leonard (Miletic-Vejzovic 18). There is, however, a Holy Bible inscribed to Virginia Woolf by Violet Dickinson, one inscribed to her by Leonard, and two Greek New Testaments, one owned by Leonard and annotated by Virginia. Leonard’s other interests, somesuch as gardening, birds, and butterfliesshared with Virginia, also are well represented.\n\nAccording to his, her, and their joint interests and writing or research commitments, the Woolfs continued to add numerous books after their marriage. These included ones they authored, as they were published; review and signed copies of books published by their acquaintances and friends; as well as gift copies given to Leonard or Virginia by various people. Virginia, for instance, received books as presents from many people, including Maynard Keynes, Saxon Sydney-Turner, Vita Sackville-West, Roger Fry, and Ethel Smyth. The Woolfs also kept books loaned or given to them but signed by and apparently belonging to friends and family members, among them Clive Bell, Duncan Grant, Lytton Strachey, Julian Bell, Vanessa Bell, Boris Anrep, and Roger Fry. One result is a library strong in English literature, from the fourteenth to the nineteenth century; with some twentieth-century literature, including selected American works; with a strong showing of French literature from Molière to Proust; and with good representation of Russian literature in translation. The Woolfs’ shared interest in Russian literature is evidenced by Leonard’s gift of Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov (1912) to Virginia and Virginia’s gifts of The Idiot (1913) and The Insulted and the Injured (1915) to Leonard as Constance Garnett’s translations appeared in the second decade of the twentieth century. Philosophical, psychoanalytical, and aesthetic studies are represented along with practical books on cooking and, predictably, on book printing and production (Miletic-Vejzovic 17). An interest in travel is reflected in many books, including fifteen volumes of Karl Baedeker’s travel guides, as well as a box that includes maps of Ceylon, street maps of London, and numerous road maps (showing various degrees of use and dated, in some cases, after Virginia Woolf’s death) to many parts of the British Isles and Europe.\n\nSome books came with fascinating inserts. One example is a handwritten poem entitled “To V. S. with a Book” that Clive Bell inserted in his gift to Virginia Stephen of John Vanbrugh’s plays (1776). “Books are the quiet monitors of mind,” begins the first stanza, and the second and third reinforce the importance of books as “the mind’s last symbol” and “the heart’s memorial.” The second stanza, exalting the writer’s art, reads,\n\nBooks are the mind’s last symbol. They express\n\nIts visions and its subtletiesa dress\n\nMaterial for the immaterial things\n\nThat soar to immortality on wings\n\nOf words, and live, by magic of the pen,\n\nWhere dead minds live, upon the lips of men\n\nAnd deep in hearts that stir. Wherefore do I,\n\nDrawing a little near, prophetically,\n\nSend you a book.\n\nA later example is a typed letter from Virginia Woolf, dated 10 December 1930 and inserted in the cover of “On Being Ill.” Addressing someone who had complained about the quality of the Hogarth Press’s printing of the essay-volume, Woolf agrees with the criticisms. She explains, however, that the essay was printed in a basement by uninstructed amateurs for whom such activity is a hobby. “In spite of all this,” she adds, “I believe that you can already sell your copy for more than the guinea you gave, as the edition is largely over subscribed, so that though we have not satsified [sic] your taste, we hope that we have not robbed your purse.”\n\nThe Woolfs’ Library at Washington State University\n\nOn the surface, it seems ironic that the bulk of the personal library owned by Leonard and Virginia Woolf is now housed within an institutional library, in Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections (MASC), in the new addition of the Holland Library, Washington State University (WSU), in Pullman on the state’s rural eastern side. WSU, however, founded in the late nineteenth century, is no 3,000-year-old Oxbridge. It was actually the other, slightly older, University of Washington (UW), located on the more urban, western side in Seattle, that “usurped the ivy-draped, Oxbridge image” (Stimson 27). WSU, says one of its historians, had an entirely different atmosphere from “that of the more typical patrician and cliquish, turn-of-the-century institutions of higher learning” elsewhere (Stimson 17).\n\nWSU is a product of the Morrill Act, passed by the U.S. government in 1862, which “gave each state a grant of land to support tuition-free college for ‘the industrial classes.’” The state of Washington, established in 1889, claimed land under this act and, in 1892, admitted the first students to a coeducational, tuition-free institution initially called the Agricultural College, Experiment Station and School of Science of the State of Washington (or Washington Agricultural College) in Pullman. The original students studied “chemistry, American and European history, mathematics (trigonometry was mandatory), English literature, and two foreign languages”all required whatever their majors (Stimson 14-15). West-side legislators as well as the UW objected, however, to a college “that proposed to teach foreign languages and mathematics to farm kids” (Stimson 6-7, 29, Frykman 1, 273 n. 1). Since students in other fields actually outnumbered those in agriculture, the college changed its name in 1905 to the State College of Washington, although it retained its agricultural research and teaching mission (Stimson 17). By the 1950s, the Faculty Executive Committee persuaded state legislators that the institution deserved to be called a university. Universities, everyone agreed, were “comprehensive teaching and research institutions offering degrees ranging from bachelors to doctorates of philosophy in various subjects” (Frykman 185). In 1959, therefore, the State College of Washington became Washington State University.\n\nThe combination of an egalitarian tradition and an identity as a research institution makes WSU an appropriate institutional venue for the Leonard and Virginia Woolf Library. WSU’s history, in fact, reminds us that for three years, beginning in 1905, Virginia Stephen taught a weekly class in English literature and history at Morley College, an evening institute for working people, and that Leonard Woolf was involved with, and published on, the economic and political movements that affected workers and consumers. Nor is the new addition to Holland Library like the British Museum Reading Room with the names of famous men ranged around the dome, or its U.S. equivalent, the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The dome over the central atrium in the new addition (added in 1994 to the 1950 Holland Library building) is conical and made entirely of glass. Light pours in, and everyone is free to walk below it through the glass doors into Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections, where the Woolfs’ books are housed.\n\nHow the Woolfs’ library came to rest in the western United States, so far away from Rodmell and London, requires some explanation. The descriptions of the dispersion of the Woolfs’ books following Leonard’s death in 1969 are a bit murky. Clearly, though, it was through the efforts of John Elwood, then chair of the English department, that the Woolfs’ books came to the WSU Library’s attention. Elwood’s brief account in Virginia Woolf Miscellany of the books’ acquisition differs somewhat from George Spater’s overview in the Virginia Woolf Quarterly of their distribution and sales from Monks House. When John and Karen Elwood visited Sussex in 1967, Fred Lucas, owner at that time of the Bow Windows Book Shop in Lewes, introduced them to Leonard Woolf, still living in nearby Rodmell. John Elwood observed on several occasions that Leonard’s library was in disarray, many volumes having been “stacked in the sun on landings” (1). Similarly George Spater noted books on both shelves and floors where they were “allowed to accumulate dust, spider webs and defunct spiders” (61). After Leonard Woolf’s death in 1969, Mrs. Ian (Trekkie) Parsons, his executor, gave copies of books Virginia Woolf herself had written, including some translations into foreign languages from her room at Monks House, to Sussex University Library, along with copies of many books Leonard had written, manuscript materials belonging to both Woolfs, and considerable correspondence (Spater 61).\n\nAccording to Spater’s outline of what happened to the rest of the Monks House books, two lots were sold at Sotheby’s in April and July of 1970. Most of the first lot, largely signed presentation copies by twentieth-century writers, was bought by the Henry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas, Austin. The second lot, mostly first editions of earlier works, went to individual bidders, the highest prices being paid for The Origin of Species, inscribed to Leslie Stephen by the author, a book containing John Donne’s notes and signature, nine first editions of Peacock, and a copy of Pope’s An Essay on Man bound “in one volume with first editions of other eighteenth-century works” formerly owned by Leslie Stephen (Spater 62-3). Elwood refers to WSU’s authorization of Fred Lucas to bid on “the approximately 300 books selected to be auctioned at Sotheby’s” of which “we managed to get over thirty” (1).\n\nAccording to Elwood, however, this transaction followed a much larger initial purchase. A casual communication from Nancy Lucas to the Elwoods in 1971 indicated that Fred Lucas was looking for a buyer for the Monks House books (1). These would be “several thousand more volumes” that, according to Spater, were “sold as a lot to George Holleyman of Holleyman & Treacher, booksellers of Brighton.” These comprised several thousand “important and association” Monks House books, including first editions and presentation copies of well-known, mostly British nineteenth- and early twentieth-century writers. WSU bought these through a London bookseller, Wm. Dawson & Sons Ltd. The Bow Windows Book Shop in Lewes, owned by Wm. Dawson & Sons, bought “several thousand more volumes” of the Monks House books. Spater thinks this lot “is similar in range to that purchased by George Holleyman,” but that it “contained, in addition, the important collection of books on Ceylon” belonging to Leonard (63). A conversation between John Elwood and G. Donald Smith, director of Libraries at the time, authorized WSU to bid on what may have been both lots of books owned, directly or through the Bow Windows subsidiary, by Wm. Dawson & Sons.\n\nWhen Virginia Woolf died in 1941, all of the Woolfs’ books were at Monks House in Rodmell, the London residence at 37 Mecklenburgh Square having been damaged by the World War II bombings. After Virginia’s death, Leonard rented 24 Victoria Square and moved many books back to London, keeping his library (including sets like the Voltaire and the Waverly novels) divided until his death. In 1972 Holleyman and Treacher catalogued and offered for sale the Victoria Square Library. As no one else seemed interested enough in these books either, WSU was able to purchase them and thus to acquire “a larger proportion of volumes associated with Leslie Stephen,” books given as gifts to Virginia, books rebound by her, and books with various bookplates (Spater 64). Spater indicates his relief that there would be no “further fragmentation” now that “the bulk of the Woolf books [are] back under a single ownershipsomething for which scholars should be eternally grateful” (65).\n\nThe Woolfs’ library at WSU is not complete, but it represents a substantial portionmore than 4,000 titles (approximately 6,000 volumes, given the multivolume sets) that Leonard and Virginia Woolf inherited, bought, were given, and published. Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections has since purchased additional books known to have been in the Woolfs’ library. These include most of the actual Hogarth Press publications, only a few of which came with the initial library purchases. In 1974, MASC purchased from Trekkie Parsons, who had inherited them from Leonard, a collection of 19171941 Hogarth Press publications. Those complete, MASC has collected the 194146 titles. In 1979, MASC purchased about four hundred books from Leonard’s nephew, Cecil Woolf, who had bought them from his uncle over the years. In 1983, MASC purchased another hundred books from Quentin Bell, Virginia Woolf’s nephew (Miletic-Vejzovic 7-8) and, more recently, additional books that came into the hands of dealers.\n\nWhen the Woolfs’ books arrived at WSU in 1971, they were unpacked with great excitement by library staff Leila Luedeking and Anne Wierum, with help from Karen Elwood and others. Originally the books were shelved in a fourth-floor room of Holland Library’s west wing. Although the books were noncirculating, scholars visiting the collection could get a sense of the Woolf library as a whole. In 1978, however, when the Humanities and Special Collections division was combined with Manuscripts-Archives under one administration, the Woolf library was dispersed and catalogued, according to the Library of Congress system, among the other books in what is now Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections. Although the dispersal satisfies those whose concerns are security as well as consistency with other MASC collections, the move has caused some concern among users and potential users who would prefer a supervised browsing among the Woolfs’ books (e.g., Bishop). MASC would like to reassemble the Woolfs’ books in one place. Meanwhile, the knowledgeable staff continues to be helpful in answering mail, e-mail, and telephone inquiries as well as pulling many books and other materials for on-site reader use. This short-title catalogue facilitates some of the preliminary browsing currently difficult to do on-site. The printed short-title catalogue (in combination with the online version) also makes the Woolf library more accessible to those reluctant to travel to this noncirculating collection without surveying, in a preliminary way, what they might find there. This catalogue renders obsolete the incomplete, inaccurate, and scarce “Important and Association Books from the Library of Virginia and Leonard Woolf” at Monks House (10 copies, 1970) and “Books from the Library of the late Virginia and Leonard Woolf from 24, Victoria Square, Westminster, London, S.W. 1” (12 copies, 1972), compiled by Holleyman and Treacher.\n\nThere is no substitute, however, for handling the books themselves. I remember how moved Nigel Nicholson was on his visit in 1979 when he held in his hands Virginia Woolf’s copy of Agamemnon with the English words she had pencilled in over the Greek. I frequently have witnessed the curiosity and awe of undergraduate and graduate students who see for the first time the rare, early hand-printed productions of Leonard and Virginia Woolf’s newly founded Hogarth Press. As the appreciative, published user accounts indicate, the Library of Leonard and Virginia Woolf is available not only to sedentary, specialized readers whom Virginia Woolf would have associated with Oxbridge academic institutions, but also to interested students and general lovers of reading. Scholars and biographers may read, for example, Leslie Stephen’s marginalia and examine the droll drawings that provide insight into a different facet of a complex man (Hyman 3, Daugherty 10). Although the Woolfs were book users rather than book collectors, their books meant a lot to them. Readers in their library can factor into Virginia Woolf’s love of books her “largely unorthodox, or experimental and creative” efforts at bookbinding (Isaac 5). Over the years, she took most of her notes on what she read in sixty-seven reading notebooks, described and catalogued in Brenda Silver’s guide, but in some of her books, there are light marks in the margins or handwritten genealogies of characters. Leonard, on the other hand, kept indices in the back or marked passages in many books he read (Wilson 6, Miletic-Vajzovic 12). The Woolf library also gives readers access to many difficult-to-find, out-of-print works (Lee, L. 6). It enables scholars to learn what editions of specific books the Woolfs read and used (Hungerford 7), an increasingly important opportunity as editorial theory reveals the effects of editing, publishing, and marketing decisions on authors’ reputations and on readers’ responses. To look at the Woolfs’ books is to begin to access, as one graduate student has recorded, the lives of their minds (Brocato 7). Scholars, collectors, and artists alike appreciate the various bookplatessome heraldic reflections of family background, some designed by the Omega Workshop, some by Virginia Woolf herself (Barber, Gillespie, “More...”). Small press publishers and printers identify instantly with the production of Hogarth Press first editions (Bissinger 8).\n\nThe Woolf library in WSU’s Manuscripts, Archives and Special Collections has become the center of a larger collection of books and works by people associated with the Woolfs, initial Bloomsbury writers like Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster, Clive Bell, and Roger Fry; later associates like David Garnett, Vita Sackville-West, and Harold Nicolson; and other period writers like Edith Sitwell, Katherine Mansfield, and D. H. Lawrence. A few manuscripts have been added, like Julia Stephen’s story and essay manuscripts published by Gillespie and Steele and drafts of Roger Fry’s translations of Mallarme’s poems. There are some letters and papers of other writers and artists as well. MASC owns, in addition, a number of striking etchings, lithographs, and book illustrations by Duncan Grant and other Bloomsbury artists, as well as art exhibition catalogues ranging from the post-Impressionist exhibitions to more recent ones of Bloomsbury art. MASC has added books by and about Virginia Woolf’s family. It has also collected different editions, including some foreign language translations of Woolf’s books.\n\nMost of us have books in our libraries that we have read only in part or not at all. The Woolfs were no exception. Gift books and review copies were, no doubt, sometimes unwelcome or uninteresting. Indeed, now and then one finds a volume with uncut pages. Other books are obviously well used, although one cannot always be certain by which generation of readers. Drawing conclusions from a list of books the Woolfs owned, therefore, requires caution and often a look at the book itself. On the other hand, as increasing numbers of lovers of learning and lovers of reading are discovering, the Woolf library is a rich resource, a legacy worth using and preserving from two of the most prolific and influential writers and thinkers of the twentieth century.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBarber, Emma-Rose. “A Book Label for Lytton Strachey.” Charleston Newsletter 16 (September 1986), 35-6.\n\nBell, Vanessa.
