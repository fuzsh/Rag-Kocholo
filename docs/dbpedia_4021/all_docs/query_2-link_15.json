        "text": "I want these to be about scenarios rather than prospects. So in this mock draft, I wanted to represent what happened at the Senior Bowl and look at a situation where Ronald Jones II is off the board before pick #18.\n\nThis mock includes trades. Notes are underneath.\n\nThe trades\n\nBuffalo trades #21, #22 & #53 to Indianapolis for #3\n\nThe Bills move up to draft Sam Darnold\n\nArizona trades #15, #47 & 2019 R1 to Cleveland for #4\n\nThe Cardinals move up to draft Josh Rosen\n\nAtlanta trades #26 & R3 to Seattle for #18\n\nThe Falcons move up to draft Maurice Hurst\n\nCleveland trades #33 & R4 to Seattle for #26\n\nThe Browns trade up to draft Daâ€™Ron Payne\n\nThe mock\n\n#1 Cleveland â€” Josh Allen (QB, Wyoming)\n\n#2 New York Giants â€” Saquon Barkley (RB, Penn State)\n\n#3 Buffalo (via Indy) â€” Sam Darnold (QB, USC)\n\n#4 Arizona (via Cle, Hou) â€” Josh Rosen (QB, UCLA)\n\n#5 Denver â€” Quenton Nelson (G, Notre Dame)\n\n#6 New York Jets â€” Bradley Chubb (EDGE, NC State)\n\n#7 Tampa Bay â€” Vita Vea (DT, Washington)\n\n#8 Chicago â€” Tremaine Edmunds (LB, Virginia Tech)\n\n#9 San Francisco â€” Marcus Davenport (DE, UTSA)\n\n#10 Oakland â€” Denzel Ward (CB, Ohio State)\n\n#11 Miami â€” Minkah Fitzpatrick (S, Alabama)\n\n#12 Cincinnati â€” Orlando Brown (T, Oklahoma)\n\n#13 Washington â€” Baker Mayfield (QB, Oklahoma)\n\n#14 Green Bay â€” Tim Settle (DT, Virginia Tech)\n\n#15 Cleveland (via Ari) â€” Ronald Jones II (RB, USC)\n\n#16 Baltimore â€” Calvin Ridley (WR, Alabama)\n\n#17 LA Chargers â€” Derwin James (S, Florida State)\n\n#18 Atlanta (via Sea) â€” Maurice Hurst (DT, Michigan)\n\n#19 Dallas â€” Roquan Smith (LB, Georgia)\n\n#20 Detroit â€” Billy Price (C, Ohio State)\n\n#21 Indianapolis (via Buf) â€” Kerryon Johnson (RB, Auburn)\n\n#22 Indianapolis (via Buf, KC) â€” Joshua Jackson (CB, Iowa)\n\n#23 LA Rams â€” Isaiah Wynn (G, Georgia)\n\n#24 Carolina â€” Taven Bryan (DT, Florida)\n\n#25 Tennessee â€” Rashaan Evans (LB, Alabama)\n\n#26 Cleveland (via Sea, Atl) â€” Daâ€™Ron Payne (DT, Alabama)\n\n#27 New Orleans â€” James Washington (WR, Oklahoma State)\n\n#28 Pittsburgh â€” Harold Landry (LB, Boston College)\n\n#29 Jacksonville â€” Lamar Jackson (QB, Louisville)\n\n#30 Minnesota â€” Courtland Sutton (WR, SMU)\n\n#31 New England â€” Leighton Vander Esch (LB, Boise State)\n\n#32 Philadelphia â€” Mike McGlinchey (T, Notre Dame)\n\nNotes\n\nâ€” Josh Allen at #1 number represents two thoughts. Firstly, that John Dorsey will likely add a veteran quarterback such as Alex Smith. Whoever they take at #1 surely isnâ€™t going to be tasked with immediately leading the Browns back to relevance? Smith instantly made Kansas City competitive after they â€˜earnedâ€™ the #1 overall pick in 2013. A move like that buys Allen time. And if youâ€™re drafting to develop a QB, Allen is the prototype. Great size, mobility, arm strength, hand size, the ability to make gains on the ground. Fans and media might prefer the bigger names but itâ€™s completely plausible that GMâ€™s and coaches will look at Allen as the ultimate lump of clay to mould.\n\nâ€” Saquon Barkley is so good, it wouldnâ€™t be a surprise if heâ€™s receiving Andrew Luck level grades from some teams. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s automatic that the Giants just draft a QB to eventually replace Eli. Dave Gettleman is determined to repair the O-line and will reportedly do whatever it takes to sign Andrew Norwell. If he gets it right up front, imagine how potent the Giants could be with Odell Beckham Jr, Evan Engram and Saquon Barkley. They also have enough talent on defense to be competitive. Are they thinking long term, or about the opportunity to win immediately?\n\nâ€” Teams were aggressive in trading up for quarterbacks a year ago. This mock represents the possibility that this could happen again, with the Bills and Cardinals making big moves to get Darnold and Rosen.\n\nâ€” A lot of mocks only have one running back â€” Saquon Barkley â€” going in the first round. Ronald Jones II is certainly talented enough to go very early, possibly top-20. I gave him to the Browns here because John Dorsey had first hand experience of Jamaal Charlesâ€™ impact at Kansas City. Jones II is Charles 2.0. I still think itâ€™s possible Kerryon Johnson goes in round one too. He ran with toughness, legitimised Auburnâ€™s season in 2017 and shares Leâ€™Veon Bellâ€™s patience in the backfield. Josh McDaniels spent a top-15 pick on Knowshon Moreno when he was in charge in Denver. He could push for another talented runner if his new team trades down.\n\nâ€” I made some picks that I donâ€™t necessarily agree with. I think Billy Price is one of the best players in the class but many others see him as a borderline first rounder. Having him go at #20 was a compromise between the two positions. Denzel Ward (CB, Ohio State) is expected to have a sensational combine and that could propel him in a week year at cornerback. It also felt like the right time to move Isaiah Wynn up the board. Following his sensational Senior Bowl and superb 2017 season, he thoroughly deserves to go in the first round. What a talent.\n\nNotes on the Seahawks\n\nâ€” As I said at the start, I want these to be about scenarios not players for now. Thatâ€™s why I deliberately didnâ€™t place Seattle with an individual at #18 or after the two trades. That said, there are appealing options left on the board at running back, the O-line and defensive front seven. Will Hernandez and Frank Ragnow are there. Nick Chubb, Sony Michel and Rashaad Penny are there. Thereâ€™s a whole host of defensive possibilities, including the find of the Senior Bowl Darius Leonard.\n\nâ€” I wanted to do a mock where the Seahawks donâ€™t get a golden ticket offer via trade. Fans have talked a lot about doing a deal for a couple of second round picks, or a second and a third. Itâ€™s possible such an offer isnâ€™t available â€” especially with this being a draft with minimal legit first round picks. Here the Seahawks are forced to trade down twice just to get a third and a high fourth. They end up with pick #33 but could feel obliged to move down again.\n\nâ€” If thereâ€™s one running back I think the Seahawks might consider taking at #18, itâ€™s Ronald Jones II. Heâ€™s different to any of the backs Seattle has drafted in the Pete Carroll era so far but he has a special quality. He could be a star. Heâ€™s off the board here so it takes that option away. They trade down instead.\n\nâ€” This scenario raises what I think is a key point â€” the likely need to hedge at running back. Theyâ€™ll possibly sign a veteran RB of some description. Whether thatâ€™s a Carlos Hyde type or someone a lot less high profile, they probably have to at least prepare for needing to wait on the running backs longer than they might prefer.\n\nâ€” They might need to add to multiple positions. D-line, linebacker, cornerback, safety, receiver, tight end, O-line, running back. This would be exercise in finding value and identifying the pockets of talent available at each position. For example, how long can you wait on a running back? Are Nick Chubb and Rashaad Penny, for example, second or third rounders? How early do you want to add a receiver? Do you wait until day three or consider D.J. Chark (one of the big risers in Mobile) earlier? How early is Durham Smythe going to go and could he have some appeal as a â€˜Yâ€™ tight end? When do you start re-stocking on defense and who are the players that can help make up your next core? How early is Darius Leonard going to be taken? Do you need to find a safety? And will you have enough room for the customary fifth or sixth round cornerback pick?\n\nâ€” A lot of the questions above are difficult to answer. And there are more. For example, can anyone say with any confidence where they think Marquis Haynes, Tyquan Lewis, Andrew Brown, B.J. Hill, Ogbonnia Okoronkwo, Lorenzo Carter, Jeff Holland, Terrell Edmunds, Justin Jones, Daâ€™Shawn Hand, Kyzir White and others are going to go? You could list more. The combine will provide some answers. Yet there are a long list of defensive prospects (and some offensive ones too) where the stock could be anywhere from round two to round five. We know the Seahawks are going to try and start re-shaping the defense. Projecting who might go where is the challenging part.\n\nâ€” Durham Smythe (TE, Notre Dame), Darius Leonard (LB, SC State), D.J. Chark (WR, LSU), Austin Corbett (T, Nevada), Marquise Haynes (LB, Ole Miss) and Tyquan Smith (DE, Ohio State) gave off quite a â€˜Seahawkyâ€™ vibe at the Senior Bowl. Weâ€™ll see how they test at the combine.\n\nâ€” One other thing Iâ€™ve noticed doing these mocks this year is thereâ€™s something slightly unsatisfying about the projections. Thatâ€™s indicative of where the Seahawks are right now. In previous years theyâ€™ve had one or two needs. Itâ€™s been possible to identify someone they might like or at least someone fans can agree would fill a need. This year, thereâ€™s a lot more work that needs to be done to the roster. Youâ€™re unlikely to take solace in any mock draft over the next few weeks, pairing Seattle with one name at #18. Youâ€™re probably going to be more reassured by an overall assessment of whatâ€™s actually out there in this draft class. The positions of strength, the options, the possible targets. So thatâ€™s what we should aim to cover over the next few weeks.\n\nYou can now support Seahawks Draft Blog via Patreon by clicking the tab below."
