        "meta_description": "Abstract. Northern New Zealand is an important location for understanding Last Glacial Interval (LGI) palaeoclimate dynamics, since it is\ninfluenced by both tropical and polar climate systems which have varied in\nrelative strength and timing. Sediments from the Auckland Volcanic Field\nmaar lakes preserve records of such large-scale climatic influences on\nregional palaeo-environment changes, as well as past volcanic eruptions. The\nsediment sequence infilling Orakei maar lake is continuous, laminated, and\nrapidly deposited, and it provides a high-resolution (sedimentation rate above\nâ¼â1âmâkyrâ1) archive from which to investigate the dynamic nature\nof the northern New Zealand climate system over the LGI. Here we present the\nchronological framework for the Orakei maar sediment sequence. Our\nchronology was developed using Bayesian age modelling of combined\nradiocarbon ages, tephrochronology of known-age rhyolitic tephra marker\nlayers, 40Arâ39Ar-dated eruption age of a local basaltic volcano, luminescence dating (using post-infraredâinfrared stimulated luminescence,\nor pIR-IRSL), and the timing of the Laschamp palaeomagnetic excursion. We\nhave integrated our absolute chronology with tuning of the relative\npalaeo-intensity record of the Earth's magnetic field to a global reference\ncurve (PISO-1500). The maar-forming phreatomagmatic eruption of the Orakei\nmaar is now dated to >â132â305Â years (95â% confidence range:\n131â430 to 133â180Â years). Our new chronology facilitates high-resolution\npalaeo-environmental reconstruction for northern New Zealand spanning the last\nca. 130â000Â years for the first time as most NZ records that span all or\nparts of the LGI are fragmentary, low-resolution, and poorly dated. Providing\nthis chronological framework for LGI climate events inferred from the Orakei\nsequence is of paramount importance in the context of identification of\nleads and lags in different components of the Southern Hemisphere climate\nsystem as well as identification of Northern Hemisphere climate signals.",

        "text": "The Orakei sediment sequence is a composite of several overlapping cores (Peti and Augustinus, 2019). Two overlapping cores with a 50âcm vertical offset were retrieved from Orakei Basin in 2016 using wireline drilling in 1âm sections. The sediment sections collected in 2016 were combined with a shorter core collected in 2007 to produce a complete composite stratigraphy as described in Peti and AugustinusÂ (2019). The Orakei sediment sequence consists of 14 sediment facies units overlying the WaitematÄ sandstone basement and basaltic volcanic ejecta from the maar-forming eruption; it is summarised in Fig.Â 2 (Peti and Augustinus, 2019). The Orakei maar core chronology presented here was established based on the event-corrected depth (ECD; Peti and Augustinus, 2019), in which all identified events of instantaneous deposition (tephra layers and mass movement deposits) have been removed.\n\n3.1âTephrochronology\n\nDetailed tephrochronology is possible since several volcanic centres from the TVZ, North Island, New Zealand, frequently ejected large volumes of rhyolitic material throughout the late Quaternary, repeatedly mantling the Auckland region with volcanic ash providing isochronous tephra marker layers (e.g. Shane and Hoverd, 2002; Molloy et al., 2009; Zawalna-Geer et al., 2016) in the AVF maar lake sequences (Fig.Â 1).\n\nTephra identification of eight visible layers was undertaken by major element analysis of glass shards via electron microprobe analyses (EMPAs) following standard protocols as described in Peti et al.Â (2019). EMPAs were performed by a JEOL JXA-8230 Superprobe at Victoria University of Wellington. A minimum of 10 individual glass shards in carbon-coated epoxy mounts were analysed using wavelength diffraction spectroscopy (WDS) with a static defocused beam at 10âÂµm and 8ânA. Major element oxide concentrations were determined using the ZAF correction method and normalised to 100â% to account for variable degrees of post-eruption hydration (Shane, 2000). Compositional data, such as major element percentages, are non-normally distributed and highly constrained by the closed-sum effect (Aitchison, 1986). For this reason, we transformed the major element oxide concentrations using the centralised-log-ratio transformation (clr in the RÂ package âcompositions 1.40â2â; van den Boogaart et al., 2018) prior to principal component analysisÂ (PCA) using the prcomp command in the âstatsâ package as part of RÂ versionÂ 3.5.3 (RÂ Core Team, 2020).\n\nThe age for the Okareka tephra layer was re-calculated using 14C ages from Molloy et al.Â (2009) as follows: only 14C ages from leaf fragments were accepted for the age determination of the Okareka tephra layer from the Molloy et al.Â (2009) 14C dataset. The 14C ages OZK262 and OZK263 were combined in OxCal 4.3 (Bronk Ramsey, 2009) with the âR_combineâ command to obtain a combined conventional radiocarbon age for the Okareka tephra (used in Sect.Â 3.2 for reservoir-correction determination), which was then calibrated with SHCal20 (Hogg et al., 2020).\n\n3.2âRadiocarbon dating\n\nRadiocarbon dating was used to refine the tephrochronology-based age estimates of the Orakei sequence. Twenty-five macrofossils (twigs and bark) were extracted for radiocarbon dating, rinsed with de-ionised water and dried at 40ââC. Twenty-eight bulk sediment samples were also extracted from 1âcm thick slices, dried at 40ââC, and thoroughly homogenised. Anomalously old radiocarbon ages in lacustrine sediment samples can arise due to a freshwater reservoir effect, resulting from water rich in dissolved ancient calcium carbonate (Philippsen, 2013). We made efforts to restrict radiocarbon dating to short-lived terrestrial material, but the scarcity of macrofossils often obviated this approach so that we also used bulk sediment 14C dates at the risk of obtaining anomalously old ages via incorporating old carbon. To determine facies-dependent freshwater reservoir-effect corrections, we compared paired radiocarbon ages from terrestrial macrofossils and bulk sediment taken from the same depth. For facies unit 4, we selected the age of the Okareka tephra layer instead of a macrofossil and sediment sample OZX348, and samples OZX341 (wood) and OZX347 (bulk sediment) for facies 8 following the recommendations of PhilippsenÂ (2013).\n\nRadiocarbon dating of organic macrofossils and bulk sediment was conducted at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) (Fink et al., 2004), apart from one macrofossil sample at the Radiocarbon Dating Laboratory (Department of Geology, Lund University) and one published date (NZA28865) from the Rafter Radiocarbon Laboratory (GNS, New Zealand). Samples for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement were pre-treated with 2âM HCl to remove carbonate, 0.5â4â% NaOH to remove humic and fulvic acids, and then 2âM HCl to remove absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere during the preparation process. After drying, the samples were combusted, graphitised, and analysed at the respective AMS facilities. Ages were reservoir-corrected and calibrated using the SHCal20 calibration curve (Hogg et al., 2020) as part of the ageâdepth modelling process (see Sect.Â 3.7).\n\n3.3âLuminescence dating\n\nLuminescence dating, a technique which determines the time elapsed since crystalline minerals such as quartz and feldspar were last exposed to sunlight (Aitken, 1990), was also applied. In this case, feldspar was used for luminescence dating, since New Zealand's relatively young geological history precludes effective dating of quartz due to reduced sensitisation of the luminescence signal (Almond et al., 2007). Feldspar is common in the Orakei sediments; its comparatively brighter infrared-stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signal was used to date deposition of the lake sediment. The most stable known signal from feldspar, known as post-infraredâinfrared-stimulated luminescence (pIR-IRSL), was used for the Orakei sediments >â50â000Â years old since it was recently demonstrated to be effective for dating lacustrine feldspars (Roberts et al., 2018). Luminescence dating of feldspar from 10 samples was undertaken for the Orakei core. The fine-grained fraction was targeted in order to maximise the percentage component of non-volcanic, distally sourced dust, which is more likely to yield a reliable luminescence signal. The sediment cores were stored wrapped in light-proof plastic at 4ââC until opened and subsampled for luminescence dating under subdued orange light at the University of Auckland (UoA, New Zealand), taking care to only sample the innermost parts of the core for dating. Samples were taken to ensure maximal spread over the >â45â000-year interval of the Orakei sequence, based on a preliminary age model which extrapolates the sedimentation rate between the two oldest tephra layers of known age (Tahuna and Rotoehu).\n\nLuminescence dating sample pre-treatment for polymineral fine grains (4â11âÂµm) was undertaken at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (Mainz, Germany) following published methods (Mauz and Lang, 2004) and involved HCl and H2O2 digestion, sieving, and settling. Additionally, coarse-grained K-feldspar (90â115âÂµm) was extracted from sample L20 (A0113) by density separation using lithium heterotungstate for comparison with the fine-grained signal. The other samples yielded insufficient coarse-grained material for dating. Samples were loaded using a pipette onto 10â15 1âcm diameter stainless steel discs depending on the amount of material remaining after chemical preparation. Additional details are included in AppendixÂ B.\n\nThe equivalent dose (De) was measured using the pIR-IRSL protocol stimulated at 290ââC (pIR-IRSL290) to minimise the potential for feldspar signal fading (Buylaert et al., 2012; Thiel et al., 2011, 2014). Measurements were undertaken using an automated RisÃ¸ TL-DA-20 reader using infrared (IR) LEDs for illumination, with the resulting signal detected by an EMI 0235QA photomultiplier tube with a D410 filter for feldspar (BÃ¸tter-Jensen, 1997; BÃ¸tter-Jensen et al., 1999). Irradiation was provided by a calibrated 90Srâââ90Y beta source (BÃ¸tter-Jensen et al., 2000). An internal alpha contribution of 0.12 was assumed for the samples, in order to account for the lower luminescence efficiency of alpha radiation relative to the beta and gamma components (Rees-Jones, 1995; Rees-Jones and Tite, 1997). A higher stimulation temperature was chosen based on equivocal results of the preheat plateau test which showed substantial inter-aliquot scatter irrespective of measurement temperature (Fig.Â B1). The accepted aliquots of all samples yielded either normal distributions, which were typically very wide, or skewed distributions indicative of incomplete bleaching. In the first case, equivalent-dose values were calculated using the Central Age Model (CAM) (Galbraith et al., 1999). In the latter, equivalent dose was calculated using the Minimum Age Model (MAM; Olley et al., 2004; Fig.Â B2). Further details can be found in AppendixÂ B.\n\nSubsamples were collected for dose rate analysis from the same depth in the core as each dating sample. These were dried and homogenised. A weighed part of this sample was ashed at 950ââC, and K concentrations were obtained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) at the University of Waikato, Hamilton (New Zealand; see AppendixÂ B for further details). The other weighed part was treated with HNO3 and hydrofluoric acid (HF) at ANSTO, from which U and Th concentrations were obtained by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) at the University of Auckland (see AppendixÂ B for further details). The measured activities of the radioactive elements K, Th, and U were converted to dose rates using published factors (Adamiec and Aitken, 1998; Guerin et al., 2011). Dose rate attenuation was estimated using published values (Mejdahl, 1979) and the sediment moisture content. Water content was estimated assuming saturation of the lacustrine sediments, taking into account water loss in the laboratory subsequent to core extraction (Lowick and Preusser, 2009). Substantial uncertainties in water content of 20â%âÂ±â10â% were included in order to mitigate potential inaccuracies in the dose rate calculations due to desiccation. Cosmic-ray dose rates were calculated based on sediment density estimates, altitude, latitude, longitude, and depth, following Prescott and HuttonÂ (1994). Cosmic-ray dose rate values were negligible (<â0.01âGyâkyrâ1) due to the depths of the samples within the lake sediments.\n\n3.4âPalaeomagnetism\n\nSynchronous changes observed in multiple proxies allow the transfer of chronological information from one record to another. For example, correlation of changes preserved in polar ice cores and sediment archives can be made on the basis of fluctuations in geomagnetic field intensity (reconstructed from palaeomagnetic measurements such as the ratio of natural to anhysteretic remanent magnetisation (relative palaeo-intensity); Stockhecke et al., 2014). Palaeomagnetic measurements down-core can also be used to identify magnetic excursions of known age, for integration into an absolute-age model.\n\nSediments below â¼â40âm depth (representing ages >âca.Â 36â000Â years) were used for palaeomagnetic measurements. The upper (younger) interval of the Orakei sequence was not used for palaeomagnetism as it can be reliably dated with radiocarbon, and we note that the presence of numerous basaltic tephra layers can obscure a reliable palaeomagnetic signal (Nilsson et al., 2011). This is a problem especially around the age of the Mono Lake excursion, which correlates with a flare-up of the basaltic volcanoes of the AVF around 30â000âcalâyearsâBP (Molloy et al., 2009). Measurements of the natural remanent magnetisation (NRM), anhysteretic remanent magnetisation (ARM), and saturation isothermal remanent magnetisation (SIRM) were conducted using a 2GÂ Enterprises model 760-R SQUID magnetometer equipped with an automatic three-axis alternating field (AF) demagnetisation system at Lund University (Sweden). Oriented standard (volumeâ=â7âcm3) plastic palaeomagnetic sampling cubes were used, with 48 samples treated as pilot samples and progressively demagnetised in 5âmT increments from 0 to 40âmT, and in 10âmT increments up to a maximum AF of 80âmT. The remaining samples were demagnetised in increments of 5 up to 30âmT, and in increments of 20âmT from 40âmT to a maximum AF field of 80âmT. Preliminary analyses on the pilot samples indicated that a stable single-component magnetisation, demagnetising towards the origin, could usually be isolated between 15 and 80âmT (see AppendixÂ C). This interval was therefore used to isolate the characteristic remanent magnetisation (ChRM) using principal component analysis (Kirschvink, 1980). Samples with maximum angular deviation (MAD) >â15, mostly associated with weak NRMs, were rejected.\n\nARMs were induced in a peak AF of 80âmT with a DC bias field of 0.05âmT. The ARMs were measured and AF demagnetised in increments of 5âmT from 0 to 30âmT, and in increments of 20âmT from 40 to 80âmT in the pilot samples and in increments of 10âmT from 20 to 40âmT in all remaining samples. SIRMs were induced with a DC field of 1 T using a Redcliffe 700 BSM pulse magnetiser. Volume-specific magnetic susceptibility (Îº) was measured using an AGICO MFK1-FA Kappabridge.\n\nRPIs were estimated by normalising the NRM20âmT with the magnetic-concentration-dependent ARM20âmT. There remains a possibility for some minor RPI variations induced by changes in lithology and indirectly by magnetic grain size and concentration, which we attempt to correct with a facies-dependent correction factor in coarser sediments (see details in Sect.Â 4.4).\n\n3.5âBeryllium-10\n\nWith regard to terrestrial sediment archives, 10Be-inferred dating is a relatively recent approach with utility for chronology development for sediment records beyond ca. 50â000Â years (limit of radiocarbon dating). Though the radioactive decay of 10Be has been used to date sediment much older than the Orakei sequence (e.g. Frank et al., 2008; Simon et al., 2020a), no study has been published yet applying 10Be variations in sediment cores as a relative dating tool by comparison to RPI reference data beyond the Laschamp excursion (Nilsson et al., 2011). Meteoric cosmogenic 10Be is produced in the atmosphere via nuclear reactions of cosmic-ray particles with nuclei such as nitrogen and oxygen. 10Be readily attaches to aerosols and dust and, with a short residence time of â¼â1Â year, is deposited on the Earth surface mainly via precipitation (Willenbring and von Blanckenburg, 2010). In open depositional environments (i.e. deep-sea and polar-ice cores), variability in (normalised) 10Be concentrations can be used as a proxy of past geomagnetic field variation (e.g. Frank et al., 1997; Muscheler et al., 2005). In terrestrial settings, such as lakes, catchment processes and lithology (i.e. erosion, soil geochemistry, aeolian input, grain size) complicate 10Be provenance, delivery, and accumulation and hence the identification of a 10Be production signal (e.g. Czymzik et al., 2015; Nilsson et al., 2011). To overcome such complexity, one approach is to normalise 10Be measurements to an element or isotope with similar geochemical properties, such as 9Be, where it has been demonstrated that the authigenic 10Beâââ9Be ratio can compensate for effects of catchment processes and grain size variations (e.g. Bourles et al., 1989; Wittmann et al., 2012). Although the Orakei catchment is small, grain size and lithology variability throughout the core is problematic due to in-wash events of clastic grains. In this study, we extract both authigenic 10Be and 9Be to compensate for the effect of grain size and possible variation in catchment processes. Meteoric 10Be and authigenic 9Be were measured in order to detect variations in cosmogenic nuclide production rates to supplement palaeomagnetic measurements (Sect.Â 3.4).\n\nLaminated sediment intervals below â¼â40âm depth were targeted for cosmogenic 10Be measurements with a focus on the lower half of the sequence.\n\nFifty-nine samples were processed for AMS measurements at ANSTO. Sample preparation (detailed in AppendixÂ D) followed White et al.Â (2019) and involved 1âcm thick core slices (representing ca. 25-year duration; average sedimentation accumulation rate (SAR) of 0.04âcmâyrâ1), from which 0.5 to 1âg of dried, homogenised sediment was treated with 6âM HCl for 2âh to leach out the authigenic 10Be and 9Be. A subsample of each leachate was extracted to measure 9Be concentration (White et al., 2019) using an Agilent 7700 ICP-MS at the Mass Spectrometry Equipment Centre (UoA, New Zealand). 9Be spike, derived from 10Be-free beryl mineral, was added to the remainder of the leachate prior to treatment with HF and HClO4 to remove silicon and boron complexes. Beryllium was separated from other cations by passage through anion and cation exchange columns, converted to Be(OH)2, oxidised to BeO at 800ââC, and finally mixed with Nb powder. AMS 10Beâââ9Be measurements of these 59 samples were performed at the Centre for Accelerator Science, ANSTO (Australia), on the 6âMV SIRIUS accelerator (Wilcken et al., 2019). The measured 10Beâââ9Be values were normalised to either the 2007-KN5-2 (nominal ratio of 8.558Ã10-12 ) or the 2007-KN5-3 (6.320Ã10-12 ) standard (Nishiizumi et al., 2007). Full-chemistry procedural blank 10Beâââ9Be ratios range from 1.1 to 13.7Ã10-15 and are â¤â¼ â1â% of the measured sample ratios.\n\nTen additional samples were prepared at Lund University to increase the 10Be resolution during the Laschamp excursion. Each sample consists of a 10âcm interval, representing ca. 250-year duration (SARâ=ââ¼â0.04âcmâyrâ1). Samples were weighed; homogenised; spiked with 9Be; and leached with H2O2, HCl, and HNO3. Separation and precipitation of Be(OH)2 was achieved by treatment with ammonia solution and NaOH for pH adjustment and followed by oxidation to BeO at 600ââC (see details in AppendixÂ D). AMS 10Beâââ9Be measurements of these 10 samples were performed at ETH (EidgenÃ¶ssische Technische Hochschule) Zurich. Authigenic 9Be was not analysed for these 10 samples and was considered negligible compared to the 9Be spike mass following measurements at UoA and ANSTO (see above). The measured 10Beâââ9Be ratios were normalised to the ETH Zurich in-house standard material S2007N, which has a nominal 10Beâââ9Be ratio of 28.1Ã10-12 (Christl et al., 2013) and is consistent with the 2007-KN 10Beâââ9Be standards used at ANSTO. All measured 10Be concentrations were several orders of magnitude higher than the background of full-chemistry procedural blanks, so that blank corrections were negligible.\n\n3.6âCorrelation of magnetic relative palaeo-intensity for relative dating\n\nWe applied relative dating using magnetic RPI to sediments older than ca. 45â000Â years to supplement the absolute age information provided by luminescence (pIR-IRSL) dating (see Sect.Â 4.3). It is crucial to avoid circularity in tuning climate proxies based on assumed synchroneity when the presence or absence of this possible synchroneity is actually an overarching study objective (Blaauw, 2012). Hence, we make use of the relative intensity of the Earth's magnetic field (RPI), which is considered to be a globally synchronous signal over millennial timescales (e.g. Channell et al., 2000; Laj et al., 2004). This approach was successful in Lake Van (Turkey), where several RPI minima were aligned to provide a chronologic framework (Hatfield et al., 2020; Stockhecke et al., 2014).\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nWe use a dynamic programming algorithm to align the Orakei RPI with the virtual axial dipole moment (VADM) reference curve from the marine PISO-1500 stack (Channell et al., 2009). Dynamic time warping (DTW) aligns time series datasets through generalised dynamic programming (Hay et al., 2019) and has been adapted for palaeomagnetic vector data by Hagen et al.Â (2020). The DTW algorithm calculates every possible match between the reference and query time series at every stratum (data point), producing a cost matrix. This cost matrix quantifies the Euclidean distance between each point in the query time series and each point in the reference time series. Under step-pattern constraints, an optimal alignment path is then found through the cost matrix which represents the optimal alignment path between both time series (Hagen et al., 2020). The step pattern only allows two directions in the path. This prevents the creation of age inversions and heavily penalises alignments between points with very different indices, so that major jumps and/or hiatuses are very unlikely. The DTW approach relies on (mostly) complete time series with a substantial component that overlaps between the reference and query time series (Hay et al., 2019).\n\nVisual inspection of the Orakei RPI and the variation of the PISO-1500 VADM (Channell et al., 2009) over the period of ca. 30â000â140â000Â calâyearsâBP suggests strong similarities between both curves (see Sect.Â 4.6). These similarities facilitate an improvement of the absolute-age model by tuning the Orakei RPI to the PISO chronology. The PISO-1500 stack has a temporal resolution of one data point per 1000Â years. To reach a similar resolution in both time series, the Orakei RPI was interpolated to match the resolution of the PISO-1500 stack and at the same time to smooth possibly unreliable features in the Orakei RPI record. Records were scaled by subtracting the mean of the time series and dividing by its standard deviation. DTW was then performed in R (package dtw; Giorgino, 2009) with closed start and open end points on the two time series, and using a Euclidean distance-based cost matrix and symmetric step pattern. We integrated 13 tuning points from the resulting alignment path into a Bacon age model. We selected 12 random tuning points supplemented by the basal tuning point. We chose to select these tuning points randomly (apart from the basal point) in order to prevent any bias that involved selecting points to arrive at a favoured solution. The depth and age values of these 13 tuning points were incorporated into the Bacon age modelling process (see Sect.Â 3.7). The standard deviation for these tuning points reflects the match between the RPI and PISO so that a point matched to several ages has a larger standard deviation spanning the entire range of matched ages.\n\nDownload\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\n3.7âBacon age model development\n\nThe final ageâdepth model for the entire Orakei sediment sequence was produced using the Bacon package (Bayesian accumulation model), using rbacon 2.4.3 (Blaauw and Christen, 2011, 2020) with a prior accumulation rate of 15âyrâcmâ1 (assumed from a maximum core age of ca. 130â000Â years and a core length of 8000âcm, i.e. â¼â16.25âyrâcmâ1). Prior accumulation shape, memory strength, and memory mean were suggested by the Bacon package following Blaauw and ChristenÂ (2011) based on the age data provided (see TableÂ 1). The ageâdepth model is further constrained by the provided rhyolitic tephra, radiocarbon, and luminescence ages from the core (TablesÂ 2â4 respectively); the 234Uâ230Th age of the Laschamp excursion as identified by palaeomagnetic direction and intensity using the age of 41â100âÂ±â350 (2Ï) yearsâBP from Lascu et al.Â (2016); the 40Arâ39Ar age of the locally sourced basaltic Mt Albert eruption (119â200âÂ±â5600 (2Ï)Â years; Leonard et al., 2017); and the dated tuning points obtained from matching the Orakei RPI to the PISO-1500 global stack (see Sect.Â 3.6, TableÂ 5). Reservoir correction and calibration of radiocarbon ages using the Southern Hemisphere calibration curve SHCal20 (Hogg et al., 2020) were done by Bacon as part of the age modelling procedure (Blaauw and Christen, 2020). A Student's tÂ distribution, essentially a symmetric distribution with longer tails than a typical Gaussian distribution, was used for the radiocarbon ages since it is more robust against outliers (Blaauw, 2010; Blaauw and Christen, 2011; Christen and PÃ©rez E, 2009). Gaussian distributions were assumed for tephra and pIR-IRSL ages, the Laschamp excursion age, and tuning point ages.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\n4.1âTephrochronology\n\n4.1.1âRhyolitic tephra layers\n\nThe identification of the rhyolitic tephra layers follows Peti et al.Â (2019) with the addition of the Rotorua tephra and is demonstrated in Fig.Â 3 using multivariate statistics. PCA was first performed on published tephra EMPA data (black and grey symbols in Fig.Â 3), which serve as reference tephra in this study. The same scaling and rotation of the reference PCA were then applied to the unknown compositional data, and the tephra layers were thus assigned to their source eruptive events through multivariate similarity (Fig.Â 3). The identification of tephra layers, and the correlation to their eruption events, is supported by the geochemical composition of the glass shards and stratigraphic position in relation to the AVF framework (Hopkins et al., 2015; Molloy et al., 2009). The resulting identifications then allowed the direct transfer of published ages (or adjusted ages in this study) onto the Orakei sediment sequence.\n\nTephra sample T-74 could not be clearly identified solely from its major oxide geochemistry (Figs.Â 3,Â A1), since many layers show similar geochemical composition. However, its stratigraphic position and substantial thickness (>â30âcm) suggest that this layer is the Rotoehu tephra. Tephra sample T-73 displays the same geochemistry as the Tahuna tephra, an interpretation supported by its stratigraphic position (Figs.Â 3,Â A1). Tephra sample T-71 can confidently be assigned to the eruption pair of Hauparu and Maketu (both from Okataina volcanic centre), which occurred within 300Â years of each other (Molloy et al., 2009) and show similar major oxide compositions (Fig.Â 3). Given the similarity between Hauparu and Maketu reference major oxide data (Fig.Â 3), we cannot confirm from the tephra geochemistry whether T-71 represents the Maketu or Hauparu eruption. Since only one layer has been found, we assign sample T-71 to Maketu given that this was the larger eruption with more widespread and voluminous ashfall (estimated to be 15âkm3 for Maketu compared to 10âkm3 for Hauparu by Froggatt and Lowe, 1990). From a chronological perspective, this uncertainty in identification is irrelevant, since the two tephra are essentially the same age (Hauparu dates to 36â000âÂ±â1000â2000Â years and Maketu to 36â300âÂ±â1000â2000Â years; ages and generic error ranges of 1000 to 2000Â years for rhyolitic tephra older than 21â000Â years from Molloy et al., 2009).\n\nThe geochemical compositions of tephra T-02 (25âmm thick) and T-04 (5âmm thick) are very similar (Figs.Â 3,Â A1). They are positioned between the Okareka and Maketu tephras (above T-02 and below T-04). Stratigraphically feasible candidates include the Te Rere tephra, Kawakawa/Oruanui tephra (KOT), Poihipi tephra, and Okaia tephra (Lowe et al., 2013). Te Rere and Poihipi can be rejected, since neither T-02 nor T-04 shows geochemical overlap with reference data for the products of these two eruptions (Figs.Â 3,Â A1). Stratigraphic ordering suggests that T-02 may be the younger KOT, whilst T-04 may correlate to the older Okaia tephra. However, a similar depth in the stratigraphic framework developed for the Orakei sequence (Peti and Augustinus, 2019), and the position of T-04 between several basaltic AVF tephra layers (Peti et al., 2019) suggests an identification of sample T-04 as the KOT as identified by Molloy et al.Â (2009). This would imply a previously unknown eruption as the source of the thicker T-02 layer (25âmm thick), which is unlikely given the well-studied eruptive history of the Taupo Volcanic Zone (e.g. Lowe et al., 2013). Layer T-02 is well preserved, fining upwards, and shows no signs of reworking (Peti et al., 2019). Its thickness supports identification as KOT, since the Kawakawa/Oruanui eruption was much larger than Okaia (Froggatt and Lowe, 1990), and thus a thicker deposit would be expected in the sediment sequence. Most importantly, the glass shards of both samples show very different morphology in backscatter images (Fig.Â A2). Shards in T-02 are very large, cuspate, and bubbly with preserved thin bubble walls signifying a very large, explosive eruption. On the other hand, small blocky shards in T-04 suggest a smaller, less explosive eruption (Heiken, 1972; Liu et al., 2015). This observation links sample T-02 to the Kawakawa/Oruanui super-eruption and, out of stratigraphic necessity, T-04 to the smaller Okaia eruption. It follows that Molloy et al.Â (2009) may have mis-correlated the apparent KOT in light of very similar geochemical compositions between sample and reference data and, following the same assumption, that the larger eruption should have been more easily preserved over the smaller eruption. The true KOT had been missed in a core break in the 2007 Orakei sequence.\n\nOther known major tephra â including Rerewhakaaitu, Te Rere, and Poihipi â were not observed as macroscopic event layers within the Orakei sediment sequence in this study, although they may be present as cryptotephra. Samples T-01 and T-15 can be clearly identified as the Okareka and Rotorua tephras based on geochemistry (Fig.Â 3) and stratigraphic position.\n\nDownload\n\n4.1.2âBasaltic tephra sample T66\n\nAn unidentified basaltic tephra layer, sample T66 could not be matched stratigraphically or geochemically to any other AVF tephra layer previously documented in Molloy et al.Â (2009) or Hopkins et al.Â (2015, 2017). Its occurrence between the layer AVF1 and the basal eruptive material sourced from the Orakei volcanic centre (Fig.Â A3) suggests that it is a new, previously undocumented tephra layer from a different AVF source. We confirmed that T66 is not a correlative to the Orakei volcanic centre and/or AVFa tephra layer (Fig.Â 4a). Furthermore, glass shard geochemistry also obviates correlation to the AVF1 tephra layer (Fig.Â 4b). We consider T66 to constitute a basaltic tephra that has not so far been encountered in any AVF maar cores (Hopkins et al., 2015, 2017).\n\nBased on the position of T66 between AVF1 (correlated to Domain/Grafton eruption) and AVFa (correlated to Orakei eruption; Hopkins et al., 2017), several AVF volcanoes are potential sources for the T66 tephra (Hopkins et al., 2017; Leonard et al., 2017). Despite the difficulties in comparing whole rock and tephra material based on major element oxides, we compare data from sample T66 to the potential AVF source centres (Fig.Â 4c): Grafton Park; Mt Albert; Mt Roskill; and the correlatives for AVF1 and AVFa, Domain and Orakei, respectively. Low FeO and SiO2 percentages in Mt Albert whole-rock composition as well as in sample T66 strongly suggest that Mt Albert is the source of the T66 tephra layer (Fig.Â 4c). The formative eruption of Mt Albert has been ArâAr-dated to 119â200âÂ±â5600 (2Ï)Â years by Leonard et al.Â (2017), which falls between the ages obtained for AVFa (126â150âÂ±â3320 (2Ï)Â years; Hopkins et al., 2017) and AVF1 (106â170âÂ±â4300 (2Ï)Â years: Hopkins et al., 2017; 83â100Â years: Molloy et al., 2009), giving further support for this identification. Hence, we conclude that sample T66 is sourced from Mt Albert with an eruptive age of 119â000âÂ±â5600 (2Ï)Â years. In order to maintain nomenclature consistency, we assign the name âAVFaaâ to this tephra layer.\n\n4.2âRadiocarbon dating\n\nAll 54 radiocarbon dates from the Orakei core (53 new and the NZA28865 date previously published in Hayward et al., 2008) are summarised in TableÂ 3.\n\nThe Bacon age model recognises 13 ages as outliers (24â%), which is in agreement with visual identifications in comparison to the model. Since the model recognises these outliers, there was no need to remove them manually. The four wood sample ages OZW884â887 and three bulk sediment sample ages OZX869, OZX888, and OZX889 are considered outliers, being much older than bracketing ages and thus the ageâdepth model. These outliers, all between 12.5 and 16.5âm depth, are interpreted as representing fluvial in-wash containing reworked organic matter and, in the case of bulk sediment ages, carry additional uncertainties from necessary reservoir corrections. The ages for OZX873 and OZX882 are also older than anticipated. This is most likely due to the unknown reservoir correction, since no double dating of these facies units (5â7) was possible due to an absence of plant macrofossils. The ages OZW874, OZX340, OZX343, and OZX878 are too young and probably explained by the first three yielding very small masses of organic carbon, whereas the reason for the latter age is unclear.\n\nThe facies-dependent reservoir effect is 1026âÂ±â117Â years in facies 4 and 410âÂ±â170Â years in facies 8. Where the reservoir correction is stated with a question mark in TableÂ 3, no reservoir correction for these specific facies could be calculated. In that case we used the reservoir correction from the stratigraphically closest facies (i.e. reservoir correction from facies 4 also applied to facies 3 and 5, marked with a question mark in TableÂ 3).\n\n4.3âLuminescence dating\n\nLuminescence data were obtained for 6 of the 10 fine-grained samples measured from the Orakei series, and for one coarse-grained sample, L20. Samples L18, L20, and L29 yielded insufficient natural signal for equivalent-dose estimation. These are also the youngest luminescence samples according to depth and therefore had accumulated less charge during burial. The sensitivity of the Orakei samples was low for feldspars and may suggest a primary igneous origin.\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nDownload Print Version | Download XLSX\n\nResults of the remaining six samples are summarised in TableÂ 4. They conform (within 2Ï error) to the expected ages based on the other approaches presented here but suffer from limitations as described below and in AppendixÂ B.\n\nThe luminescence characteristics of the Orakei samples were not optimal for age determination. Ages could only be calculated by relaxing the acceptance criteria for analysis. The samples are typically very dim, yielding generally low signal counts (Fig.Â B4a) and low sensitivity. Late background subtraction was used to optimise the signal measured. The sensitivity to test dose over the regenerative cycles of the pIR-IRSL290 protocol typically decreased to 20â30â% of the test dose sensitivity following the natural signal measurements and remained fairly constant over subsequent cycles (Fig.Â B4b). Dose-response curves could often, but not always, be fitted to an exponential or exponential-plus-linear function but rarely passed through the origin due to the high degree of thermal transfer (Fig.Â B4c). Recuperation was very high, yielding values of up to 50â%, and recycling ratios were variable but often exceeded 20â% divergence from unity (TableÂ B1). In order to obtain results, aliquots were accepted if dose-response curves could be reasonably fitted; threshold criteria for other quality control measurements such as recycling ratios and recuperation were relaxed such that values of 1.0âÂ±â0.4 and <â67â% (mostly <â25â%) were accepted for analysis respectively. The residual dose test run on sample L15 (A0111) provided usable signals only in one out of three aliquots, and so the residual correction was made on the basis of that lone aliquot. Despite these limitations, the residual-corrected ages yield results more closely fitting with the age predicted by the matching of the palaeomagnetic RPI to the PISO-1500 stack.\n\nDownload\n\n4.4âPalaeomagnetism\n\nDown-core palaeomagnetic measurements of the Orakei sediment sequence were undertaken to support the development of the chronology with the identification of known-age geomagnetic excursions. Additionally, relative changes in the strength of the Earth's magnetic field were estimated to allow the transfer of chronological information from dated sediment sequences showing corresponding variations in the relative palaeo-intensity.\n\nMineral magnetic data (Fig.Â 5) of the Orakei sediment sequence are consistent with the detrital magnetite as the main magnetic carrier. Following Peters and ThompsonÂ (1998) we classify the magnetic assemblage of the Orakei samples as magnetite/titanomagnetite (Fig.Â 5a). We identify both detrital and extracellular magnetite components based on the definition of EgliÂ (2004; Fig.Â 5b), with the latter mostly found in facies 10. Variations in magnetic grain size, estimated following Thompson and OldfieldÂ (1986), suggest that most Orakei sediment samples used for palaeomagnetic measurements fall in the pseudo-single-domain range of magnetite (0.1â20âÂµm; Fig.Â 5c), consistent with a detrital origin, although the increased scatter in the lower left half of Fig.Â 5c, suggesting increasing magnetic grain size, may partly reflect the importance of superparamagnetic (e.g. facies 10) and/or paramagnetic effects in samples with low magnetite concentration. The magnetic data partially fulfils the loosely defined criteria to assess the reliability of palaeo-intensity data from sediments (Tauxe, 1993). It appears that magnetic concentration variations exceed 1 order of magnitude at times, and the magnetic grain size is likely not confined to a very narrow range, but all other criteria are generally fulfilled.\n\nThe coring procedure at Orakei prevented useful declination determination. The 1âm long core sections were not oriented with respect to magnetic northâsouth, and several segments were further rotated as they broke along coarser clastic layers such as tephra.\n\nDownload\n\nThe ChRM inclination in the lower â¼â40âm of the Orakei sediment sequence mostly varies from â50 to â60â, which is consistent with the geocentric axial dipole prediction of â56â for the site latitude. A reversed polarity direction with inclination reaching +66â is observed at 43.24âm (Fig.Â 6a). Its position between the Tahuna and Rotoehu tephra layers (see Sect.Â 4.1) implies that this short-lived reversal can be assigned to the Laschamp excursion (e.g. Cassata et al., 2008; Ingham et al., 2017; Laj et al., 2014; Laj and Channell, 2015; Mochizuki et al., 2006; Roperch et al., 1988) dated to 41â100âÂ±â350 (2Ï)Â years by Lascu et al.Â (2016). Significantly shallower inclinations are recorded between â¼â63 and 68âm, as well as around the facies unit boundary 13â12 at â¼â73âm (Fig.Â 4). The inclination flattens to â4.1â at 73.42âm, 10âcm below the tephra AVFaa from the Mt Albert eruption (119â200âÂ±â5600 (2Ï)Â years; Leonard et al., 2017; Fig.Â 6). This age constraint in proximity to this near-reversed inclination, along with pronounced and sustained decrease in RPI starting at the time of deposition of AVFaa, suggests that it could correspond to the Blake excursion (Smith and Foster, 1969; Thouveny et al., 2004; Tric et al., 1991; Zhu et al., 1994) dated to 116â500âÂ±â700 to 112â000âÂ±â1900 (2Ï)Â years by Osete et al. (2012). Other occurrences of reversed or transitional (positive or near-zero) inclinations at 49.77 and 63.38âm, and shallower inclinations between â¼â63 and 68âm, occur in intervals of coarser grain size, possibly indicating previously unidentified thin mass movement deposits (King, 1955). No data were obtained between 65.8 and 67.78âm due to sand bands preventing sampling of the intercalated laminated sediment as the sample cubes are larger (2.2âcm) than samples taken for other techniques (e.g. 1âcm slices for beryllium; see below).\n\nThe NRM and ARM variation of the Orakei sediment sequence show the same broad pattern in each demagnetisation step (Fig.Â 6b, c). Very low NRM and ARM in facies unit 14 are followed by a sudden increase at â¼â76âm (Fig.Â 6b, c), then decreasing stepwise until very low values are reached again at â¼â60âm. Up to 40âm, NRM and ARM values remain very low, although the ARM curve is interrupted by slightly elevated values in facies unit 9 (â¼â55â50âm; Fig.Â 6c).\n\nTo calculate the relative palaeo-intensity â expressed by the NRMâââARM ratio â we used the NRM and ARM after 20âmT AF demagnetisation, as a similar pattern was obtained from all demagnetisation steps (different colours in Fig.Â 6d). Valet and MeynadierÂ (1998) and Stanton et al.Â (2011) show that differences between different methods of obtaining the RPI values are minor. Very low values are associated with the partially reversed polarity direction tentatively identified as the Laschamp excursion (Fig.Â 6). The strength of the global magnetic field is known to have been exceptionally low during the Laschamp excursion as measured in sediments (e.g. Channell et al., 2009) as well as in lava flows from France (e.g. Laj et al., 2014; Roperch et al., 1988) and New Zealand (Cassata et al., 2008; Ingham et al., 2017; Mochizuki et al., 2006), supporting this interpretation. Equally low RPI values are also observed in facies unit 9 and facies unit 11 (Fig.Â 6). These facies units represent coarser grain size facies, suggesting that the low RPI values could be artefacts associated with less efficient NRM recording in a higher-energy depositional environment (compare Fig.Â 2) and observed in a minor anti-correlation between dry bulk density (not shown) and RPI. This may indicate a possible link between sedimentary facies and the efficiency of acquiring an NRM signal, which was not fully removed by the NRMâââARM normalisation procedure. The down-core variation in NRMâââARM (Fig.Â 4d) is assumed to be proportional to the scatter around a linear trend line in a scatterplot (Fig.Â C5). The offset between the linear trend lines fitted to the data points of the coarse and the fine-grained facies units indicates only a very small difference in efficiency of NRM acquisition. Nevertheless, we correct this difference with a facies-dependent correction factor applied to the palaeomagnetic intensities of facies 9 and 11 to match the slope of the fine-grained facies. The facies-corrected RPI (shown in Fig.Â 6e) strongly resembles the raw RPI, and henceforth RPI refers to this facies-corrected RPI.\n\nThe Orakei RPI shows marked variation with a short-lived peak at 78.35âm (Fig.Â 6d) and troughs around 70, 73, and 76âm. Pronounced low RPI values between â¼65Â and 61âm are followed by high-frequency variability up to â¼â55âm and then a pronounced decrease to reach a short-duration trough around 52âm. RPI values then increase toward a maximum around 49âm, followed by a stepwise decrease to a RPI minimum coincident with the Laschamp excursion (Fig.Â 6d).\n\nThe short-duration RPI trough around 52âm aligns with a very shallow inclination of +0.4â at 51.2âm (Fig.Â 6). The combination of inclination, low RPI, and its depth (implying an age of ca. 61â000Â years) suggests that this may be the NorwegianâGreenland Sea excursion (Bleil and Gard, 1989; LÃ¸vlie, 1989). This probable reversal of the geomagnetic field was considered to be restricted to high latitudes accompanied by a global low in geomagnetic field intensity and has been confirmed at various northern high-latitude sites (Channell et al., 1997; Nowaczyk et al., 1994, 2003; Nowaczyk and Baumann, 1992; Nowaczyk and Frederichs, 1999; Simon et al., 2012; Xuan et al., 2012). However, low field strength and potentially excursional directions have also been interpreted as the NorwegianâGreenland Sea excursion in Black Sea sediments (Liu et al., 2020; Nowaczyk et al., 2013) and the western equatorial Pacific (Lund et al., 2017). The occurrence of the NorwegianâGreenland Sea excursion in the Orakei maar lake record would thus constitute its first observation this far south, although additional samples are needed to confirm its occurrence in the Orakei record.\n\n4.5âBeryllium\n\nRelative changes in the 10Be production rate in the atmosphere, at first order, should reflect fluctuations in the relative strength of the Earth's magnetic field, whilst on shorter time scales it should reflect solar magnetic shielding assuming a constant galactic cosmic-ray flux (e.g. Frank et al., 1997; Muscheler et al., 2005). As such, the direct-fallout meteoric 10Be record can be expected to provide an inverse record to the relative palaeo-intensity time series (Elsasser et al., 1956; MÃ©nabrÃ©az et al., 2011). However, in this case, the authigenic 10Be signal contains contributions from non-direct-fallout component(s), such as those associated with catchment-derived erosional influx and material of aeolian origin, and thus may be modulated by associated grain size variability. Authigenic (HCl-extracted) 9Be serves as the normalising factor for 10Be to compensate for such effects but may also indicate shifts in the sedimentary regime on its own as 9Be is commonly released by weathering (Wittmann et al., 2015).\n\nDownload\n\n4.5.1âBeryllium-9\n\n9Be shows nearly constant, long-term increasing values from the core base up to large stepwise increase between 50 and 45âm, reaching its maximum of â¼â6Ã1017âatomsâgâ1 just below the Rotoehu tephra layer and then returning to constant (near pre-peak) values up-core (Fig.Â 7a). The large peak between 47 and 45âm may reflect accelerated weathering and erosion in the catchment and/or wind-blown deposits with a different 9Be inventory, although the catchment is confined to the crater rim environment and enhanced weathering and erosion are not apparent at this depth in the Orakei core.\n\n4.5.2âBeryllium-10\n\nThe 10Be record (from ANSTO; black in Fig.Â 7b, d) increases up-core, peaking at the top of unit 10 (â¼â57âm), interrupted by a prominent trough in facies unit 9 and followed by relatively constant values across facies unit 8, punctuated by discernible peaks at â¼â44 and â¼â42âm. The LundâETH 10Be data largely follow the ANSTO 10Be but deviates considerably for three of its deepest four samples (i.e. below â¼â44âm; Fig.Â 7b,Â d). The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but it may be due to very heterogenic lithologies or represent a sampling or analytical artefact.\n\nThe trough in 10Be in the coarser facies unit 9 (50â55âm depth) is interpreted to be caused by a higher proportion of coarser (sandy) grains and, hence, reduced surface density of 10Be per gram, reflecting apparent reduction of surface area per unit of mass in coarser grains. The same behaviour of the 10Be profile is observed in facies unit 11 (â¼â64â69âm depth, sand and silt dominated), but the trough is not as distinct as in facies unit 9 (Fig.Â 7b). This is likely a response to the more effective separation between distinct coarse-grained sand bands, which have been removed on the ECD, and intercalated finer silt from which the beryllium samples originate. On the other hand, in facies unit 9, the sand bands are less distinct, and the beryllium sample material likely originates from a multi-modal grain size distribution in which particles of different grain sizes (clay, silt, sand) are mixed.\n\n4.5.3âBeryllium-10âââberyllium-9 ratio\n\nIn order to correct for catchment processes that modulate the 10Be concentration (e.g. sediment influx variability, grain size variation, and geochemical variation in beryllium transport and deposition), the 10Beâââ9Be ratio (BourlÃ¨s et al., 1989) is plotted in Fig.Â 7c. The data incur high analytical uncertainties originating from low-level 9Be ICP-MS measurements near detection limits (ranging from <â1 to 13âppb, with most data <â2âppb, to which we assigned 30â% errors). Very low ratios in facies unit 14 are followed by elevated ratios in unit 13, which are largely maintained to â¼â48âm depth (Fig.Â 7c). The uppermost studied interval is characterised by a pronounced 10Beâââ9Be trough (due to the strong 9Be peak at 45.5âm) followed by an abrupt increase near coincident with facies unit boundary 8bâ8a (dashed grey line in Fig.Â 7c) and associated with elevated values up to â¼â40âm depth (Fig.Â 5c).\n\nThe conspicuous sawtooth profile in the 10Beâââ9Be ratio in facies unit 9 originates from 9Be measurement uncertainties (Fig.Â 7a, c) rather than from the bimodal grain size distribution of sand and silt, which we avoided. Samples were measured for 10Be and 9Be in two campaigns in 2018 and 2019, with the former having larger uncertainties. Thus, we attribute the scatter mostly to measurement uncertainties rather than a true signal of the geomagnetic field strength, cosmogenic nuclide production, or sediment influx. In summary, 10Beâââ9Be ratios are associated with large uncertainties preventing any correlation to palaeomagnetic variations with high confidence as the ratio does not respect the homogeneous mixing of both isotopes prior to scavenging. On the other hand, 10Be data â except for unit 9, where effects of larger grain size cannot be ruled out â are probably more reliable and discussed further below.\n\n4.5.4âPalaeomagnetic excursions in the beryllium record\n\nElevated 10Be deposition during a palaeomagnetic excursion, such as the Laschamp excursion (McHargue et al., 1995), enables the use of peaks in the 10Be concentration record to identify dated excursions and hence to include them in the age modelling process. Based on the estimated age range covered by the lower â¼â40âm of the Orakei sediment sequence, for which we have obtained a beryllium isotope record, we expected to see elevated 10Be (and/or 10Beâââ9Be) during the Laschamp and Blake excursions. The magnitude of the peak above baseline would depend on the magnitude of the decrease in palaeomagnetic field intensity and the impact of competing terrestrial processes which can also alter beryllium delivery and deposition.\n\nThe Tahuna (38â400âÂ±â1700 (2Ï)âcalâyearsâBP) and Rotoehu (45â100âÂ±â3300 (2Ï)Â yearsâBP) tephra layers serve as upper and lower age markers, respectively, for the Laschamp excursion in the Orakei sediment sequence. For a detailed, high-resolution study of this interval, we use 10Be data from ANSTO and LundâETH (Fig.Â 7d). Aside from one data point at â¼â44.5âm and two data points below 46âm depth, the two curves overlap well despite the LundâETH samples above 46âm representing mixed sediment from 10âcm intervals (i.e. â¼â250Â years) and the ANSTO samples representing 1âcm sediment slices (i.e. â¼â25Â years) of sediment only. Three LundâETH samples below 46âm, which deviate the most from ANSTO data, represent mixed material from 2âcm intervals (â¼â50Â years). Again, we have no clear explanation of this discrepancy, but it likely is due to heterogenic lithologies and/or represents a sampling or analytical artefact.\n\nDownload\n\n10Be shows increasing values from â¼â44 to 42âm with a distinct peak at 42.5âm and return to lower 10Be at 41âm depth (Fig.Â 7d). This peak may represent the Laschamp excursion at Orakei, as also observed at nearby Lake Pupuke (Nilsson et al., 2011), and the onset may be placed at 43.3âm depth, which aligns well with the sharp reversal in palaeomagnetic inclination (Fig.Â 6a) and RPI minimum (Fig.Â 6d; see Sect.Â 4.4).\n\nThe 10Be increase in the lower part of the section (facies unit 13) is interrupted by smaller peaks â a pattern not observed in the previous 10Be records (Simon et al., 2016). Furthermore, none of these peaks stand out above background level as would be expected for the Blake excursion (116â500âÂ±â700 to 112â000âÂ±â1900 (2Ï)Â years; Osete et al., 2012). However, the AVFaa tephra (119â200âÂ±â5600 (2Ï)Â years; Leonard et al., 2017) provides a suitable time marker in proximity to where the Blake excursion is expected as an RPI low, hence a peak in 10Be (Fig.Â 7). Two small peaks in 10Be at 73.6 and 74.6âm may correspond to the inferred level of the Blake excursion (Fig.Â 7c). However, the Blake excursion is not independently identifiable in the Orakei sediment sequence, neither in the palaeomagnetic inclination or intensity (RPI) records (see Sect.Â 4.4, Fig.Â 6) nor in the cosmogenic 10Be record. Consequently, the Blake excursion is not used to inform the chronology development.\n\nIn the present study, the 10Be data, although showing trends and variability correlated with different facies units, are limited in their ability to directly reflect geomagnetic field variations, whilst the 10Beâââ9Be data suffered from large analytical uncertainties. For example, the Laschamp reduction in geomagnetic field strength approximately doubled the globally averaged atmospheric production rate of 10Be as observed in polar ice core (e.g. Wagner et al., 2000) and marine sediment (e.g. Simon et al., 2020b) 10Be records. In this study, the inferred Laschamp 10Be is no larger than Ã1.3 above adjacent base level 10Be, and the Blake excursion barely stands out. Variations in the 10Beâââ9Be data suggest strong catchment and/or regional influences on isotopic beryllium records that may not easily be compensated for via normalisation with 9Be. Therefore, the interpretation of 10Be in terms of geomagnetic field changes and its utility for dating appears to be rather limited in the context of the Orakei maar sediment sequence.\n\n4.6âTuned palaeomagnetic RPI curve\n\nInitial visual inspection highlighted the similarities between the Orakei RPI curve and the PISO-1500 stack (Fig.Â 8a, b). The fit of both curves following DTW alignment (Fig.Â 8c) is presented in Fig.Â 8d. The stretching and compressing by the DTW alignment become visible in the aligned RPI curve, which shows strong agreement with the PISO-1500 stack, although some minor fluctuations between ca. 80â000 and 95â000Â years appear only in the PISO-1500 stack (Fig.Â 8d).\n\nNeither 10Be concentration nor 10Beâââ9Be curves display a comparable pattern, likely due to an unidentified catchment-influx overprint. We therefore do not incorporate the beryllium results into the tuned chronology.\n\nDownload\n\nDownload\n\n4.7âIntegration of multiple chronologies: the Orakei age model\n\nAll ages from radiocarbon dating, tephrochronology, the Laschamp excursion, luminescence dating, and the RPI tuning points obtained in the Orakei sediment core are presented in Fig.Â 9. The age of the Blake excursion has not been used for the chronology development, since its identification in the Orakei sequence is equivocal in both the palaeomagnetic and 10Be data, and the AVFaa tephra provides an age for the chronology development close to the position of the possible Blake excursion. The age model obtained using Bacon is shown in Fig.Â 10. The mean 95â% confidence age range is 1431Â years, with a minimum of 220Â years at 2.57âm ECD and a maximum of 3231Â years at 59.23âm ECD. Only 68â% of all ages overlap with the 95â% range of the ageâdepth model.\n\nThe Orakei ageâdepth model defines the age of onset of lacustrine sedimentation (at 79.24âm ECD) as 132â305Â years (95â% confidence range: 131â430â133â180Â years). Following that, the ageâdepth model is predominantly guided by the RPI tuning points (Fig.Â 10) despite not always passing through or near the mean. This occurs as the modelling process is designed to avoid strong or abrupt changes in the accumulation rate unless supported by a hiatus (which has not been observed). Nevertheless, a notable inflection of the age model occurs at ca. 59âm caused by nearby tuning points of different ages which represent the interval of ca. 80â000 to 95â000Â years, in which two RPI minima are matched by the DTW algorithm but the intermittent variations are not captured in the Orakei RPI (Fig.Â 8d). Whilst this inflection is not supported by any noticeable sedimentological change in the facies model, the strong match between Orakei RPI and PISO after the age modelling process (Fig.Â C6) gives credibility to this behaviour of the age model, although it might be slightly overexaggerating the change given the more robust uncertainty estimations of the tuning points. The Orakei age model agrees well with the AVFaa tephra age (Fig.Â 10). Except for sample L32, the Orakei age model lies well within the error ranges of the accepted luminescence ages (L15, L14, L35, L65; Fig.Â 8), despite their limitations. Aside from the outliers (see Sect.Â 4.2), most radiocarbon ages, all known-age rhyolitic marker tephras, and the Laschamp excursion age agree well with the Orakei ageâdepth model in its upper half (Fig.Â 10). The facies units 6 and 7, as well as (parts of) 2 and 3, are, however, much less well constrained. The radiocarbon dating density is less than ideal given the lack of inÂ situ, datable terrestrial macrofossils in these facies units. Furthermore, the absence of macrofossils adds uncertainty to the freshwater reservoir or input of old carbon correction estimates and potentially introduces additional error in the bulk sediment radiocarbon ages of the bulk sediment (Fig.Â 10). The shape of the ageâdepth model (steepness, inflection points, angles) represents changes in the sedimentation rate, which are described in Sect.Â 4.8 and shown in Fig.Â 11.\n\nDownload\n\n4.8âSedimentation rate variability\n\nAt the Orakei core base the sedimentation rate is â¼â0.2âcmâyrâ1 and maintains a fairly constant rate, except for a short-term drop within the finely laminated facies unit 10 caused by the inflection in the age model described in Sect.Â 4.7 to â¼â45âm in facies unit 8 (Fig.Â 11). Stepwise accelerations in sedimentation rate follow and reach â¼â0.6âcmâyrâ1 around the boundary between the facies units 8 and 7. An interval with slightly decreased sedimentation rates in facies unit 4 is followed by a jump to the maximum sedimentation rate of â¼â0.9âcmâyrâ1 at â¼â20 m (Fig.Â 11). A high but slowly decreasing sedimentation rate towards the Orakei core top follows in facies units 3 and 2, with an abrupt drop to â¼â0.4âcmâyrâ1 at 8âm (Fig.Â 11). Another strong decrease in sedimentation rate occurs at the onset of the peat interval (facies unit 1), which records values below 0.2âcmâyrâ1 (Fig.Â 11).\n\nThe stepwise increase in sedimentation rate at â¼â45âm nearly coincides with the change in chronometer from RPI tuning points to tephra and 14C ages. Whilst we cannot entirely disprove an influence of the chronometer change on the increase in sedimentation rate, we do note several observations that support this sedimentation rate change being method-independent: (1)Â it is a stepwise change, not a sudden change, at the exact change point in chronometer. (2)Â In the interval where both chronometers overlap, albeit very shortly, the Rotoehu tephra and the uppermost RPI tuning point agree well (Fig.Â 10). (3)Â The increase in sedimentation rate does occur at the transition from facies unit 8b to 8a. These sub-facies differ in their colour contrasts between the laminations, potentially indicating slightly different chemical composition and thus a slightly different depositional context which may well agree with a different sedimentation rate. (4)Â Further changes in sedimentation rate, even larger in magnitude than at â¼â45 m, occur at other positions in the sediment sequence independent of strong lithological or facies changes (and independent of chronometer changes), such as at â¼â39âm and within facies unit 4 (Fig.Â 11).\n\nAdamiec, G. and Aitken, M.: Dose-rate conversion factors: update, Ancient TL, 16, 37â50, 1998.â\n\nAitchison, J.: The statistical analysis of compositional data, Chapman and Hall, London, New York, 1986.â\n\nAitken, M.
