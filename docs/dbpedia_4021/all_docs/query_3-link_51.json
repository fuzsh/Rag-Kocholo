They also acquired interest in the processing plant in Siler City, NC, which made them one of the largest poultry processors in North Carolina.\n\nWhile spending many long hours developing a large and progressive business, Mr. Watson still had time to participate in many other endeavors, serving his community through church and civic activities. He had a genuine concern for people and served on the board of directors of the Raleigh Rescue Mission and the Raleigh Chamber of Commerce. For many years, Mr. Watson was an active member of the Brooks Avenue Church of Christ, where he served as an Elder and Bible School teacher.\n\nDuring his poultry career, Mr. Watson participated actively in various agricultural and poultry organizations throughout North Carolina and the United States.

He endowed Salisbury State University with funding to establish the Perdue School of Business, and he served for five years on the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland. In keeping with one of his greatest loves — baseball — Mr. Perdue was instrumental in bringing the Class A Delmarva Shorebirds baseball team to Salisbury in 1996. He built a stadium in Salisbury in honor of his father, Arthur W. Perdue.\n\nIn North Carolina, Mr. Perdue is well-known and respected, having spent more than 40 years working with farmers and growers to build his business. Mr. Perdue surrounded himself with associates who recognized opportunities offered by North Carolina’s geography: expansive farmland able to support and maintain a fast-growing poultry business. Mr. Perdue attributes the success of Perdue Farms in North Carolina to the strong work ethic, energy and enthusiasm of its people; the state’s favorable business and farming climates; and the state’s location and proximity to major northeastern markets.\n\nThrough his keen vision, passion for quality and ability to create marketplace demand, Mr. Perdue has become a symbol of entrepreneurial success. His driving work ethic and approach to marketing opportunities are well-regarded, having transformed a small family-farming operation into a multi-billion-dollar agricultural business leader. Perdue Farms’ success story fills many pages in business and marketing textbooks.\n\nIn honor of his numerous contributions to the growth and development of North Carolina’s and US’s poultry food industry the North Carolina Poultry Federation is pleased to induct Franklin Parsons Perdue into the North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\nYYYY – YYYY\n\nE. Marvin Johnson was born into a hard-working, close-knit rural farm family in southeastern North Carolina during the Depression. In 1942, he graduated from Rose Hill High School. He joined the Merchant Marines in 1944, serving until 1946. He married Grace Powell in 1951.\n\nAs a young man, Mr. Johnson and his brother, Bizzell, began their venture into the poultry business, selling live turkeys on the streets of Rose Hill, NC. The turkeys were raised on their parents’ farm. Operating in 1955 as Nash Johnson and Sons Inc., Nash Johnson and his sons Mr. Johnson and Bizzell built the first feed mill in Rose Hill. In 1959, with surplus capacity from the mill, the Johnson family expanded their business to include a chicken hatchery and grow-out operation. They became part owners in 1962 of Rose Hill Poultry, a chicken processing plant in Rose Hill. The same year, they became part-owners of a turkey processing plant in Raeford, NC. In 1967, the Johnsons became the sole owners of Rose Hill Poultry, and in 1974, under the Johnsons’ sole leadership, Raeford Turkey Farms became known as the House of Raeford. In the years that followed, Rose Hill Poultry became part of the House of Raeford Farms, Inc. In 1988, the company’s breaded specialty product plant opened in Hemingway, South Carolina.\n\nIn 1991, the Johnsons built a new feed mill — the largest in the United States. That same year, Marvin’s son Bob Johnson became Vice President of the House of Raeford Farms, Inc. The Johnsons further expanded their operations in 1992, opening a specialty products plant in Athens, Michigan. As the poultry industry continued to grow throughout North Carolina and the US, by 1993 the House of Raeford had positioned itself as the 12th-largest privately-owned company in North Carolina. In 1996, the House of Raeford opened a new 243,000-square-foot further-processing plant and distribution center in Raeford. The House of Raeford purchased Columbia Farms in South Carolina in 1998, adding an additional 195 million pounds of chicken to its sales base.\n\nMr. Johnson’s vision and insight helped build the House of Raeford into one of North Carolina’s premier business operations. He helped pioneer and build the turkey industry in eastern North Carolina, as well as the entire poultry food industry across the state of North Carolina and the US. Mr. Johnson served as President of the NC Turkey Federation, the North Carolina Poultry Federation, the National Turkey Federation, and the Southeastern Poultry & Egg Association — later known as the U. S. Poultry & Egg Association — the largest poultry organization in the world.\n\nAlways taking time to participate in and support worthy causes, Mr. Johnson was active in NC State’s Wolfpack Club; the North Carolina Republican Party; served on the State Board of Agriculture; was a member of Rose Hill Methodist Church; and was one of the principal sponsors of the noted North Carolina Turkey Festival held annually in Raeford. Well-known for his vision, his keen insight, his use of common sense and his wit and humor, Marvin was respected by his family, friends, peers and business associates as a remarkable entrepreneur.\n\nIn honor of his numerous contributions to the growth and development of North Carolina’s poultry food industry, the North Carolina Poultry Federation is pleased to induct E. Marvin Johnson into the North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\n1927 –\n\nJames Louis Maxwell Jr. was born in 1927 in Goldsboro, North Carolina. He graduated from Goldsboro School in 1944 and attended Davidson College. After service in the U.S. Navy at the end of World War II, he attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, graduatin in 1950 with a B.S. in Commerce. He married Mary Ann Jeffreys in 1952.\n\nFounded in 1916 by Mr. Maxwell’s grandfather, Goldsboro Milling Company was a part of Mr. Maxwell’s life from birth. Goldsboro Milling produced corn meal and grits, later adding poultry, hog and dairy feeds under the Diamond Feeds brand. Most of the products were distributed through wholesale grocers and “country stores.” Early on, Mr. Maxwell made the rounds of customers as a Diamond Feeds salesman.\n\nMr. Maxwell’s father, affectionately known as Big Louis, died at 53, leaving Mr. Maxwell and his uncles to continue the business. Both uncles retired, and Mr. Maxwell and Billy Shepard continued to work as salesmen, office managers and feed millers.\n\nMr. Maxwell would explain that he and Billy Shepard convinced his uncles to let them try chickens, hogs, turkeys or anything else that might provide income; the feed business was drying up and they needed to diversify. Some of their ideas failed, but, with some advice from Marvin Johnson, the turkey business stuck.\n\nGoldsboro Milling Company and its related companies became one of the largest fully-integrated turkey operations in the world. In partnership with Smithfield Foods, Goldsboro Milling produced over 450 million pounds of turkey products and over 325 million pounds of hogs. In addition, the company was a major landowner in North Carolina and Florida and had extensive timber interests.\n\nMr. Maxwell’s greatest assets were his vision, his honesty and his understanding of human frailties. His family, friends, peers and business associates knew him on a straightforward basis: what you see is what he is.\n\nIn honor of his numerous contributions to the growth and development of North Carolina’s poultry food industry, the North Carolina Poultry Federation is proud to induct James Louis Maxwell Jr. into the North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\nYYYY – YYYY\n\nJohn W.

Until his retirement in 1986, Mr. Hamby served as Operations Manager of the North Carolina Division of Gold Kist Eggs.\n\nThough much of his life was devoted to agriculture and the poultry food industry, to Mr. Hamby his family and his church always came first. He was a faithful member of the First Presbyterian Church in Durham, where he served as an Elder and a Deacon. He also served as Chairman of First Presbyterian Board of Deacons, Church Treasurer and Chairman of the Finance and Every Member Canvass Committees.\n\nThroughout his years of loyal service to the poultry food industry, Mr. Hamby was always looking for new ideas and innovative ways to help refine and improve North Carolina’s egg production and processing. Two of his most significant contributions were the concepts of caged poultry houses and egg pasteurization. Mr. Hamby gave generously of his time and talents. A few of the many leadership roles he held were: Member of the Board of Directors of the Southeastern Poultry & Egg Association (now the U. S. Poultry & Egg Association); Chairman of the Egg Advisory Committee for the NY Mercantile Exchange; Chairman of the North Carolina Poultry Council; Chairman of the N. C.

Hamby Jr. made a lasting and vital impact on the growth and development of North Carolina’s entire poultry food industry and the North Carolina Poultry Federation is pleased to honor his contributions with induction into the North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\n1930 –\n\nDon Tyson was born in 1930 in Olathe, Kansas; in 1931 his parents moved the family to northwest Arkansas. Following his early education in the Springdale Public Schools, Mr. Tyson continued his education at the Kemper Military Academy in Booneville, Missouri and the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, AR.\n\nMr. Tyson’s stellar career in the poultry business began in 1952 when he joined his father’s poultry operation, then known as Tyson’s Feed and Hatchery. From 1952 until 1958, Mr. Tyson and his father worked together closely, developing and building their poultry feed and live production business. Their dedication and hard work led to the opening of their first poultry processing plant in Springdale, AR in 1958. Tyson’s Feed and Hatchery thus became the first fully-integrated poultry firm in Arkansas, and Mr. Tyson was the company’s first plant manager.\n\nUnder the leadership of John W. Tyson, the company bought Garrett Poultry in Rogers, AR in 1963, the first of many acquisitions. 1963 also saw the initial public offering of stock in the newly-named company — Tyson Foods, Inc. In 1967, John W. Tyson and his wife, Helen, died in an automobile-train collision. Mr. Tyson took over leadership of Tyson Foods, Inc. Under his leadership, Tyson Foods, Inc. expanded in 1967 by acquiring Franz Foods in Green Forest, AR, making that facility the third plant operated by Tyson Foods. The company grew internally over the next 25 years and completed 23 more acquisitions of poultry and other food processing facilities. In 1994, Tyson Foods became the 10th largest manufacturing company on the Fortune 500 listing. When Mr. Tyson stepped down as Chairman of the Board of Tyson Foods, Inc. in 1995 and assumed the role of Senior Chairman, Tyson Foods was the world’s largest producer, processor and marketer of poultry and poultry-based food products.\n\nIn North Carolina, the name Tyson Foods, Inc. is well-known and respected as an industry pioneer and leader. It currently operates facilities in Wilkesboro, Monroe, Sanford, Harmony, Creswell, and Fayetteville, NC and employs over 5,000 team members statewide. A key component in the success of Tyson Food’s commitment to consistently providing only the highest-quality products for its customers is the close relationship it maintains with its 600 grower families spanning eight North Carolina counties. Tyson Foods provides jobs to thousands of North Carolina residents and positively impacts the state’s economy, contributing to the success of many allied industries.\n\nIn honor of Don Tyson’s vision, his pioneering spirit and his exemplary leadership skills in propelling Tyson Foods, Inc. into a model of entrepreneurial success and in honor of his numerous contributions to the growth and development of the poultry food industry in both North Carolina and the United States, the North Carolina Poultry Federation is pleased to induct Don Tyson into the North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\nYYYY – YYYY\n\nRobert “Bob” S. Erwin Jr. grew up in Hickory, North Carolina and attended Hickory High School. He graduated from Davidson College in Davidson, NC in 1952. Mr. Erwin joined the U.S. Army and served for two years. The Korean War ended just as Mr. Erwin was posted to Korea, so he was afforded the special opportunity to spend one year of his military service in northern Japan. Mr. Erwin was discharged from the Army in 1954 as a 1st Lieutenant.\n\nMr. Erwin married Sara Breeden. Mr. and Mrs. Erwin spent their first year of marriage in Charlotte, NC working for Commercial Credit. In 1955, they moved to Morganton, NC, where Mr. Erwin joined Breeden Poultry, started by his father-in-law R. T. Breeden, Sr. Shortly after joining the company, Mr. Erwin became President of B and L Feed, the feed and grow-out division of Breeden Poultry. When Mr. Erwin joined the business in 1955, most of the chickens Breeden Poultry processed were purchased from hatcheries, feed dealers and feed mills. By 1964, the company had constructed a hatchery and feed mill, and and Mr. Erwin supervised the growth and eventual total integration of the company over the following years. In 1988, B and L Feed and Breeden Poultry were sold to Tom Shelton of Case Farms. Mr. Erwin continued as a valued consultant for Case Farms.\n\nIn addition to his active service as President of the Carolina Feed Industry Association, Mr. Erwin served as a member of the initial Board of Directors of the North Carolina Poultry Federation and became the second President of the Federation serving from 1969-70. Mr. Erwin was active on the Federation’s Public Affairs Committee and contributed extensively to the Federation’s fund-raising efforts. Mr. Erwin served for nine years on the Board of the American Feed Industry Association.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Erwin were very active in their local Methodist Church. Mr. Erwin’s contributions included loyal service as a Sunday School teacher, Finance Chairman, Chairman of a special fund-raising campaign for a church building addition and service as an Eagle Scout and Scout Leader. The Erwins were active members of a special building team that traveled to Mexico to help with the construction of a church.\n\nMr. Erwin’s many contributions to his community and to local professional and civic organizations included: serving for nine years as a Trustee and Development Committee Chair for the Methodist Children’s Home in Winston-Salem, NC; serving on the Board of the Givens Estate Methodist Retirement Home in Asheville, NC; serving on the Board of Grace Hospital in Morganton, NC; serving on the Board of the Senator Sam J.

After completing high school in Illinois, Mr. Guglielmi attended Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. At Duke Mr. Guglielmi met his future wife, Chiquita Murray, of Mocksville, NC, the daughter of North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame member Malcolm Harry Murray.\n\nIn 1961, Mr. Guglielmi’s career in the poultry business began with a training program at Holly Farms Poultry Industries in Wilkesboro, NC. Mr. Guglielmi worked for several departments at Holly Farms during the training program, including Hatchery Operations, Grow Out Management and Sales. In 1966 Holly Farms relocated Mr. Guglielmi to Mocksville, where he learned the commodity purchasing aspects of the poultry business under M. H. Murray’s mentorship.\n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mr. Guglielmi got involved in local and state politics. He worked diligently to educate policy makers on the needs of the poultry industry and to temper regulations that affected the industry. During this same period Mr. Guglielmi became active in the North Carolina Poultry Federation and the North Carolina Feed Manufacturers Association, quickly rising to leadership positions in both associations. Mr. Guglielmi moved through the chairs of the North Carolina Poultry Federation and became the Federation President in 1974.\n\nIn 1976, Holly Farms moved Mr. Guglielmi back to Wilkesboro to head the corporation’s Commodity Purchasing Department. The Department was challenged with the task of centralizing commodity purchasing for all of Holly Farms’ feed manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, Virginia, and Texas. Mr. Guglielmi’s success in leading the Commodity Purchasing Department resulted in his promotion to Vice President of the Corporation and later being named to Holly Farms’ Executive Committee.\n\nA series of presidential and congressional actions in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to the deregulation of a large segment of the transportation industry. Of significance to the poultry industry, railroads and interstate trucking were deregulated. Mr. Guglielmi served as Chairman of the Traffic Committee for the Southeastern Poultry & Egg Association (now the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association) and spearheaded the Association’s work with Congress and the United States Department of Transportation. As Traffic Committee Chairman, Mr. Guglielmi supported the poultry industry by monitoring transportation the rates, surcharges and cost effectiveness of trucking and rail. The Traffic Committee under Mr. Guglielmi’s leadership commissioned a study to measure the short-term and long-term effects of deregulation the Association used for many years to guide their actions.\n\nMr. Guglielmi’s tremendous efforts and leadership in the poultry industry earned him the Southeastern Poultry & Egg Association’s highest award in 1978: “Workhorse of the Year.” Soon after, Mr. Guglielmi was elected to the Board of Directors and later to the Executive Committee of the Southeastern Poultry & Egg Association.\n\nMr. Guglielmi continued his statewide representation of the poultry industry as a member of the North Carolina Board of Agriculture. He worked closely with North Carolina Agriculture Commissioner Jim Graham, advising him on regulations and policies affecting the poultry industry. In 1982, Mr. Guglielmi was elected President of Southeastern Poultry & Egg Association. In his role as President, he focused on Washington, D.C. Agriculture Secretary John Block became a central figure for Mr. Guglielmi’s efforts to ensure that the poultry industry was represented fairly in Washington.\n\nAs active as he was in his representation of the poultry industry, Mr. Guglielmi never lost sight of his commitment to his community. Mr. Guglielmi was a past member of the Mocksville Jaycees and a member of the Masons. In Wilkesboro, Mr. Guglielmi was a member of Saint Paul’s Episcopal Church, serving on the church’s vestry as both Junior and Senior Warden. He also served on the Foundation Board of the Diocese of Western North Carolina.\n\nIn honor of his numerous contributions, dedicated service and tireless work on behalf of the poultry food industry, the North Carolina Poultry Federation is pleased to induct John Anthony Guglielmi into the North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\n1923 –\n\nJohn Henry Hendrick was in 1923 and grew up with his parents, four brothers and six sisters on a cotton farm near Fallston, North Carolina. Mr. Hendrick graduated from high school in 1941 and married Osteen Spurling in 1942.\n\nMr. Hendrick was drafted into the Army during World War II and served on the front lines at the Battle of the Bulge. He reached the rank of Platoon Sergeant and came home in 1946 with three battle stars.\n\nAfter WWII, Mr. Hendrick purchased some land from his father, built a house and began farming. In 1949, he began his turkey operation with 500 poults and by 1992 was producing 350,000 turkeys annually. The Hendricks quickly became one of the most successful family turkey operations in the United States.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Hendrick played a major role in the development of the poultry industry locally, regionally and nationally. As a long-time president of the Cleveland County Poultry Council, he worked with the Agricultural Extension Service to bring educational programs to the county poultry producers. He was active in supporting Future Farmers of America poultry-judging teams, Cleveland County Fair poultry exhibits and a poultry judging contest for youth. In 1993, Mr. Hendrick was elected to the Cleveland County Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\nMr. Hendrick served as President of the North Carolina Turkey Federation from 1979-80; President of the North Carolina Poultry Federation in 1981; Executive Committee of the National Turkey Federation from 1981-83; and President of the National Turkey Federation in 1984. For many years, he chaired the entertainment committee for the Federation banquet and in 1996, the North Carolina Poultry Federation honored Mr. Hendrick with its Distinguished Service Award for his long service to the organization.\n\nAs president of the National Turkey Federation, Mr. Hendrick emphasized nutritional education programs for consumers. He worked with universities in many states to develop new turkey products and to search for ways to eradicate avian disease in poultry. He helped move the industry from the whole-bird concept by offering a wider variety of products — from drumsticks, thighs, breasts and giblets to turkey salami, bologna and hot dogs.\n\nAs a leader in his community, Mr. Hendrick served as chairman of the Board of Directors of First Citizens Bank in Shelby, NC, member of the Cleveland County Fair Board of Directors and member of the Board of Trustees of Gardner Webb University. He served his church, Pleasant Grove Baptist, as a deacon and Sunday School Director.\n\nMr. Hendrick served the North Carolina Poultry Federation and the state poultry industry in many capacities. Because of his many years of service to the industry and the Federation and because of his pioneering spirit as an industry leader, the North Carolina Poultry Federation is pleased to induct John Henry Hendrick into the North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\n1927 –\n\nDr. Robert “Bob” E. Cook was born in 1927 and grew up on a general livestock farm near Spencer, West Virginia. During high school, he was active in 4-H and served as the State Future Farmers of America President. Dr. Cook entered West Virginia University, earning a B. S. in Agricultural Education in 1949. Prior to serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, he worked for the International Harvester Company. After being discharged from the Army, he taught Vocational Agriculture for a year before starting graduate school at West Virginia University. He earned his M.S. in Animal Science then attended NC State University, earning his Ph.D. in poultry genetics in 1958.\n\nIn 1958, Dr. Cook joined the Department of Poultry Science at the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL as an Assistant Professor. In 1961, he moved to become the Coordinator of the USDA’s Southern Regional Poultry Genetics Project. From 1964-1965, Dr. Cook worked exclusively for the USDA as Leader of Genetic Investigations. In 1965, he entered university administrative as Chair of the Department of Poultry Science at The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. In 1969, he became head of the Department of Poultry science at NC State. During his tenure at NC State, he served on numerous state, industry and university committees and on a number of department evaluation teams for the USDA.\n\nIn 1985, Dr. Cook was appointed an Assistant director of the NC Agricultural Research Service. He served in that capacity until 1986, when he was named the Assistant Dean for the NC State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS). One of his primary duties as Assistant Dean was to work directly with the NC Legislature to address the research and extension needs of CALS and agriculture in general. He retired from NC State in 1992. Retirement was not, however, the end of Dr. Cook’s contributions to North Carolina agriculture. He actively worked with the North Carolina Poultry Federation in many capacities after his retirement, and in 1997 was appointed by then-Governor James B. Hunt, Jr. to serve as a member of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission. He served on that commission to represent agriculture and the animal industries’ viewpoints on proposed environmental regulations. He retired from the Commission in 2001.\n\nDuring his tenure as at NC State, both the Department of Poultry Science and the North Carolina poultry industry grew rapidly. Although no one person is responsible for that growth, Dr. Cook’s leadership and untiring efforts on behalf of the department’s extension, teaching and research programs played a key role. Based on his leadership, the department became one of the premier educational units of its kind in the world.\n\nDuring his tenure as Assistant Dean, Dr. Cook was instrumental in working with the poultry industry and the NC Legislature to fund the renovation and expansion of Scott Hall, home of the Department of Poultry Science at NC State. That accomplishment laid the foundation for the continued success of the poultry teaching, research and extension programs at NC State.\n\nDr. Cook received numerous honors over the years, including: an Achievement Award from the Ohio Poultry & Livestock Industry, 1969; the Golden egg Award from the North Carolina Egg Marketing Association, 1974; Distinguished Service Awards from the North Carolina Poultry Federation, 1971 and 1983; a Certificate of Merit from Phi Kappa Phi, 1984; a Distinguished Service Award from the North Carolina Egg Marketing Association, 1986; and the “Workhorse of the Year” Award from the Southeastern Poultry and Egg Association in 1990. He was very active in a number of industry and scientific associations and served as a board member and President of the Poultry Science Association from 1976-77 and as Vice president of the US branch of the World Poultry Science Association from 1984-1988. He was named as a Fellow of the Poultry Science Association in 1981.\n\nThe poultry industry within and beyond North Carolina benefited from Dr. Robert “Bob” E. Cook’s and the North Carolina Poultry Association is pleased to induct him into the North Carolina Poultry Hall of Fame.\n\nYYYY – YYYY\n\nWyatt Gray Upchurch was born in Lee County, North Carolina. His values — hard work, family, community, public service — were shaped on his family’s farm. He grew up when tobacco was king. Mr. Upchurch pursued a different line of agribusiness: turkey production. After graduating from high school in 1953, he took courses in poultry science and agricultural economics at NC State University. During that time he worked as an inspector for the USDA and met and married Mary Garner.\n\nIn 1959, Mr. Upchurch became eastern sales manager for Chicago-based Priebe Poultry. Constant travel and entrepreneural desire led Mr. Upchurch to join the Upchurch Milling Company and its Upchurch Turkey Farms. (The parent company was unrelated to Mr. Upchurch’s family.) In 1972, Mr. and Mrs. Upchurch purchased Upchurch Turkey’s breeder operation and hatchery outright, and formed a new company: Tar Heel Turkey Hatchery. Based in Raeford, NC the new company immediately took on a key investor when Carroll’s Foods (now Smithfield Foods) bought a share of the hatchery. Adding Carroll’s guaranteed a market for the new company’s product and was the beginning of strategic partnership.\n\nTar Heel Hatchery began with two incubators and two offices — one for Mr. Upchurch and one for Mrs. Upchurch. After several expansions, the company occupied multiple buildings, including a large office complex built in 1993. Tar Heel Hatchery always maintained the strictest health, safety and security standards, utilizing state-of-the-art techniques in protecting its products and workers.\n\nMr. Upchurch’s leadership in the poultry industry was felt far beyond Hoke County and North Carolina. In 1990, as part of his long association with the North Carolina Turkey Federation and the National Turkey Federation, both of which he served as president, Mr. Upchurch had the honor of presenting the official “holiday” turkey to President George H.W. Bush on the White House lawn. Closer to home, Mr. Upchurch exemplified the finest traditions of community service. He served for a decade on the Hoke County Board of Commissioners, seven of them as chairman. He chaired the Board of the Lumber River Council of Governments. They commended Mr. Upchurch’s leadership with the Calvin Haggins Award two years in a row. From 1995, his service as a Director of North Carolina’s Southeast Commission helped attract jobs and investment to an eleven-county region stretching from Richmond County to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nMr. Upchurch was an avid supporter of education. In 2001, the ribbon was cut on Upchurch Hall, a 10,000-square-foot facility on the Sandhills Community College’s Raeford campus. The $1.8 million structure sits on a 10-acre lot purchased by Mrs. and Mr. Upchurch and donated to the college. Mr. Upchurch was a man of strong faith, serving as Deacon and Elder of the Raeford Presbyterian Church.\n\nWith his sharp mind, tireless work ethic and business acumen, Mr. Upchurch might have pursued any number of careers in any number of places. The poultry industry in North Carolina is fortunate he chose the path he did. It was a good day for him and a great day for the poultry industry. Because of that choice, the North Carolina Poultry Federation is honored to induct Wyatt Gray Upchurch into its Hall of Fame.\n\nYYYY – YYYY\n\nBill Prestage grew up in Michigan with two older brothers and two sisters. His father was a beer distributor in Battle Creek. After one year of college at Western Michigan he married and started a family.\n\nThe beer business wasn’t Mr. Prestage’s ambition, so in 1960 he took a job with Central Soya selling Master Mix feeds. He moved his family to Spartanburg, South Carolina for his first sales territory, excelled, and moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina to cover a larger territory in 1963.\n\nOne of his customers was Ottis Carroll and their mutual respect led to an offer to be 50% partners in 1967. Mr. Prestage accepted the offer and moved his family to Clinton, NC to be closer to the business. The turkey operation grew and pioneered new and innovative production practices such as moving the birds inside to more controlled environments and optized growth opportunities. Contact production used the skills of the local farmers to manage the birds while offering farmers a stable income and a constant bird marketing opportunity. Centralized supplies acquisition, feed ingredients, genetic breeding, medications, veterinary services, transportation and management support created a vertically-integrated system.\n\nMr. Prestage perfected this new way of growing turkeys and carried the practices into the swine production business. Within a few years the company had become a significant presence in both poultry and swine production. In 1981, Mr. Prestage’s long-time friend and business partner, Ottis Carroll, died. Mr. Prestage sold his interest in Carroll’s Foods to Mr. Carroll’s family, 15 years after the partnership was formed.\n\nIn August of 1983, Mr. Prestage immediately resumed work in the turkey business with his wife, sons, 22 employees and 18 contract growers by acquiring the North Carolina grow-out operation of Swift. He reentered swine production as well. Prestage Farms was on its way. In 1991, Mr. Prestage expanded his business beyond North Carolina by starting another swine division in Mississippi. In 1993 he continued the expansion by building his own turkey hatchery. In 1994 his son Ron joined the family business and they started another turkey operation in South Carolina. Never afraid of a new challenge, Mr. Prestage and his family purchased the Rocco turkey processing plant in St. Pauls, NC in 2000.\n\nThe Prestage business philosophy has been simple from its start: be fair to your employees, your growers, your colleagues and your neighbors; don’t just meet the rules, exceed the rules; do business with good people; a business deal must be beneficial for all involved parties; above all, be competitive at everything you do.
