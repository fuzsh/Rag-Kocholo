        "text": "“I told (the team) after practice, I’m a head coach going into my ninth year, and you get a pretty good sense of a team by how the practice before the spring showcase or game (goes) and what their approach to it is.”\n\nMike Norvell appreciated the effort exemplified by his players on Thursday.\n\nFlorida State had its last “physical” practice of the spring today before the gates of Doak Cambell Stadium open, and the public gets to see what the team looks like. The Seminoles went out with a bang with explosive plays, competitive situations, and a couple of emotional moments that crossed the line.\n\nAlthough the headman did not admit it, the defense won the final practice. Poor offensive execution, mainly drops, helped Adam Fuller’s unit stay in front, as the offense did not know where to go with the ball most of the day. The key to success came from the stout secondary play that suffocated the wide receivers. Patrick Surtain stapled Azareye’h Thomas and Fentrell Cypress to the field, and they delivered with sticky coverage and pass break-ups. As Mike Norvell mentioned in his press conference, the offense worked heavily on the short passing game and screens, which meant Jaylin Lucas played a featured role.\n\nAs noted, the Seminoles will suit up inside Doak Cambell Stadium for the first time in 2024 at 4 P.M. on Saturday. Mike Norvell has shifted the goalposts on expectations, so I expect it to look more like a fancy practice than a glorified game.\n\nObservations\n\nQuarterbacks: DJ Uiagalelei did not put together his best practice of the spring. Honestly, he has not been particularly sharp in the last few days. His deep ball still looked like how it usually does, especially when FSU needed to throw a Hail Mary. Uiagagelei displayed impressive pocket presence as the pocket collapsed, as he stood tall and delivered passes down the field. Unfortunately, those rarely turned into positive plays. While the drops were a mainstay, he missed some layups and too often looked for the home run down the field.\n\nRunning backs: With short passes and the screen game the highlight of the game plan, Jaylin Lucas became the #1 pass catcher of the day. The linebackers snuffed the plays out quickly, but Lucas’ ability to weave through traffic and get lost amongst the trees makes it difficult for defenses to quickly key in on him. When FSU practiced in two-minute situations, Norvell usually tried to get the ball to #13 to give the offense positive yardage and momentum.\n\nPass catchers: Stop me if this sounds like a broken record: the drops were an issue today at practice. During the first 11-on-11 period in practice, on second down, DJ Uiagalelei stood in the pocket, invited pressure, bought time, and fired a strike to Kentron Poitier on a post route. Poitier found space against the zone defense, but he dropped a perfectly thrown ball, resulting in an incompletion. Malik Benson made a nice grab on the ensuing play, as he continues to be the most consistent force for the offense. The drop counter reached five, but I spent more time watching the line of scrimmage battle at the other end of the field. When the defense played in man coverage, the wide receiver group struggled to find separation in both 7-on-7 and 11-on-11 and often needed creative play calling from Mike Norvell to get open.\n\nLine of scrimmage: Speaking of, the fireworks came from the big men in the trenches. Richie Leonard and Patrick Payton created multiple melees that Mike Norvell and Alex Atkins alluded to. Whose fault it was is difficult to decipher, but Richie Leonard did not finish the 11-on-11 period of practice, presumably due to his role in instigating the insurgence.\n\nWhen the sides did calm down, they each produced solid moments. Maurice Smith continues to improve throughout the spring and had Grady Kelly’s number during one-on-ones toward the end of the day. The defense responded with stout play against the run as they ate up blocks and allowed the linebackers to flow through and clean up the rest.\n\nAfter the spring game, all eyes will be on these two units concerning the transfer portal. In all likelihood, FSU could see additions and subtractions from each group before April 30th.\n\nLinebackers: The linebacking core improves with each practice, and today, they displayed an excellent ability to defend against the pass. Omar Graham Jr. put together one of his best days of spring as he flew downhill, made plays against the run, and sprinted sideline to sideline to limit the screen passes the offense wanted to run. His running mate, DJ Lundy, stayed sticky with his tight-end responsibility and carried the seam the way a safety would.\n\nSecondary: Besides the straps that AZ Thomas and Fentrell Cypress put on the wideouts, Charles Lester looked like the player he was hyped to be. Thomas mentioned some of the injury struggles the freshman has dealt with this spring on an appearance with Battle’s end last night, but in the last few practices, he seems to be getting healthier. Today, he recorded an interception off a tip-drill that the whole defense celebrated. When he was not creating turnovers, he paired his speed and length to disrupt the receivers' timing and force the quarterbacks to throw the ball away or tuck it and run.\n\nMike Norvell\n\nDefensive Coordinator Adam Fuller"
