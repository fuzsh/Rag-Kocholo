Dr. Thanos is the lead inventor of PEG-ADA2 (US Patent 9,969,998), a checkpoint inhibitor that targets immuno-suppressive adenosine, currently in candidate nomination studies. Translational I/O studies from Dr. Thanos’ group on HALO’s PEG-PH20® therapeutic candidate (Phase III, pancreatic cancer) led to a broad strategic alliance between Halozyme and Genentech to study a combination between Tecentriq® (anti-PDL1) and PEG-PH20® in the clinic across 8 solid tumor types. Dr. Thanos’ group also developed an IDE-approved companion diagnostic currently being used in a global phase 3 pancreatic cancer trial. Before HALO, Dr. Thanos was Head of Protein Engineering at Sutro Biopharma (Nasdaq:STRO). Dr. Thanos is a named inventor on nine issued US patents assigned to Sutro, and is the lead inventor of core platform technology used by both Sutro Biopharma and SutroVax Inc. (US Patent 9,650,621). Prior to that, Dr. Thanos co-founded Catalyst Biosciences (NASDAQ:CBIO), where he participated in raising venture capital, and helped to establish the company’s technology platform. He is a co-inventor of Factor VIIa marzeptacog alfa, currently in Phase II/III clinical trials (purchased by Wyeth/Pfizer, garnering $41.2 million in milestones), Factor IX CB2679d/ISU304, currently in Phase I/II trials, and Factor Xa, currently in pre-clinical development. Dr. Thanos also devoted significant effort to establishing Catalyst’s directed evolution-based, protein engineering platform. Earlier in his career, Dr. Thanos was a National Cancer Institute Postdoctoral Fellow under Professor Jim Wells at UCSF and Sunesis (NASDAQ:SNSS). He earned a Ph.D. in Molecular Biology and Biochemistry from UCLA where he was an NIH Chemistry / Biology Interface Predoctoral Fellow. At UCLA, Dr. Thanos discovered the atomic structure and binding mode of SAM domains- one of the most common protein modules found in eukaryotic cells, work which was prominently featured in Science Magazine. He is a named inventor on 17 issued and multiple pending patent applications in the area of biological and cellular therapeutics and a first author of several peer-reviewed articles in top tier journals. As a recognized thought leader in the field, Dr. Thanos is frequently called upon to present as an invited speaker, workshop leader, and conference chairman at international scientific conferences focused on biological therapeutics to treat cancer.\n\nFollow Christopher Thanos:\n\nCrunchbase\n\nLinkedin\n\nAbout Actym Therapeutics, Inc.: Actym Therapeutics is a privately-held biotech focused on the discovery and development of novel immuno-oncology therapies to treat cancer.\n\nWebsite\n\nCrunchbase\n\nLinkedin\n\nWillam Rutter\n\nCEO and Founder of Boston Biomedical\n\nDr. Rutter is Chairman and Founder of Synergenics, LLC, which owns and controls a portfolio of biotechnology companies at various stages of development. In his academic career, Dr. Rutter joined the University of California–San Francisco (UCSF) as head of the newly formed department of Biochemistry and Biophysics in 1968, and played a key role in developing UCSF into a major scientific institution. In research, he is particularly known for the discovery of the enzymes involved in the expression of DNA (RNA polymerases), the first cloning of the insulin gene, the cloning of hepatitis B virus (HBV), and formation of an HBV-like particle that provided the basis for a safe and protective vaccine. With 2 colleagues, Dr. Rutter founded Chiron in 1981, a pioneering biotech firm that developed the first recombinant vaccine (against HBV) with Merck and a process for manufacturing insulin from yeast with Novo-Nordisk. Chiron was the first to clone the AIDS (HIV) virus and to discover, clone, and sequence the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Chiron developed quantitative diagnostic tests for HIV, HBV, and HCV, thus providing the means for eliminating blood contaminated with these viruses, a major contribution to public health worldwide. Chiron developed and promulgated the concept of “viral load” as the basis for determining disease status, as well as the basis for developing and evaluating antivirals and other treatment protocols for these and other diseases. Prior to Chiron, Dr. Rutter was a consultant to Abbott Laboratories for about 20 years, and a member of the Amgen Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Rutter’s past board memberships include Novartis, Sangamo Biosciences, Cytokinetics, Nugen, Oscient Pharmaceuticals, and Epitomics.
