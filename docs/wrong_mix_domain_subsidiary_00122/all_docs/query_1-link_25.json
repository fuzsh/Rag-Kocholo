Tim Eastman onetrekmnd@aol.com As a 14-year-old who cringes at any attempt of the adult generation to hold America in a state of cultural stasis by restricting the flow of information, and who is not restricted (either by parental meddling or personal ignorance) from information provided through most any media, shouldn't I be less auda¬ cious than to criticize Jon Katz - the young generation's sole crusader for justice and altruism in a world conspiring against freedom of infor¬ mation, as he so vividly portrays himself. Notatal!;my\"auda- dty\"is entirely justified. While I share many of Katz's beliefs about the necessity of providing children with the tools and knowledge to access information, I find his arrogant definition of a \"responsible child\" and his declara¬ tions of how to rear children and which rights chil¬ dren should be granted to be supremely demeaning and unfathomably megalomamacal. The article's mandates, rigid definitions, and con¬ tracts epitomize the \"hypocrisy\" for which he so chastises the media and political elite. Katz preaches John Locke's utopian vision while ignoring its fun¬ damental principle: the mutual development of and agreement to a binding set of rules, and the absence of a controlling class. More disturbing than the article's self-congratula¬ tory, holier-than-thou tone, though, is the author's cold indifference to (or ignorance of) the article's own central tenet: to self-rig hteously grant kids the right to see information, but deny them the oppor¬ tunity to develop their own impressions of it, to let kids have access to new ideas, but immediately brand all exposures as good or bad, so that children won't have the chance to forge their own value system or wrestle with ethical dilemmas for them¬ selves.The adult world is both afraid to deny chil¬ dren access to information, and afraid to grant it uncensored - by the V-Chip or Net Nanny or a par¬ ent's guiding hand - because, without a eonscience- in-the-flesh to oversee a child's every thought and pass on the flagrant stereotypes and sweeping generalizations of society's octogenarians, children might - heaven forbid! - develop ethics different from those of their parents. Historically, parents have postured and assumed facades of superiority or supreme correctness.The rebellion that marks adolescence to the point of cliche is actually the almost inevitable result of the child realizing that the parent is not always right Katz's article, through its pedantic psychobabble and less-than-mediocre pop psychology, simply repackages the age-old (but flat-out wrong) mes¬ sage that there's no substitute for a parent's watchful eye when it comes to a child's exposure to media of any kind; [fa child is allowed to roam free in the oh- so-frightening world of cyberspace, unencumbered by adults'severe and age-old prejudices, he or she might become what is perhaps the most horrific, the most frightening, the most dangerous thing to an uncertain parent:a grown-up. Ben Helfinstein georgia@cais.com Constitutional Theory It smacks of extreme arrogance for Alvin Toffler to suggest that the Constitution doesn't apply to issues such as cyberporn and Net connections (\"Antici¬ patory Democracy,\" Wired 4.07, page 45).The fore¬ fathers knew that their work would require change periodically and built in provisions for amendments; they also created sufficient impediments to so-called visionaries like Toffler by requiring a majority of Congress to ratify any vision into law. Even If the Constitu¬ tion were irrelevant, would you trust the current ruling caste to rewrite it? The same people who brought us the 5&L fiasco, PACs, check bouncing, legal sexual harassment, midnight pay raises, Whitewater, and other new-and-improved corruption? Do these individuals have the vision to carry us through another 200 years? Digital technology has the power to change our lives, but there Is a role for government. Cooperative devolution and anarchy is the stuff of fairy tales and Star Trek. The Constitution was meant to protect us - in spite of ourselves - not to suit the whims of a par¬ ticular period in our country's history. Amend? OK. Rewrite? I don't think so.

Some of this commentary - such as William Bennett Turner's excellent \"What Part of'No Law'Don't You Understand?\" [Wired 4.03, page 104) - has been insightful and useful! am amazed,however,that only passing reference has been made to the rest of the Telecommunications Act, a 161-page piece of legislation of which only 10 pages constitute the Communications Decency Act The provisions of the CDA applica ble to online communication are plainly unconstitutional. How¬ ever, the rest of the Telecommunications Act Is the most significant piece of communications legis¬ lation in more than 60 years and achieves many broadly deregulatory goals that have been long overdue. The act is already resulting In significant changes to the structure of the telecommunications industry.These changes - Influencing how services are structured, marketed, and priced - will have a far more significant effect on the development and use of the Internet than the ill-conceived inde¬ cency provisions. While I strongly support Wired 1 s role In airing these issues and sounding the clarion call to resist electronic censorship, I also believe you have failed to adequately discuss the other reforms of 1996. Jeffrey Carlisle jcarltsle@omm.com Back to School Your \"reality check\" on \"The Future of Schools\" {Wired 4.06, page 82) left out those who face the reality of schools every day: the classroom teachers. As a fifth-grade teacher in an inner-city Milwaukee public school, I shuddered at your choice of experts - particularly the excessive ink you gave to Lewis Perelman. Here is a person who claims that public schools have equal technology, yet wrote a 368-page book on public education (School's Out) without one mention of \"racism,\"\"segregation,\" or \"Ineq uality.\" As a teacher in a 93-year-old building with 11 donated Apple lie computers plugged into one outlet, I am outraged that you would print the drivel of some¬ one so blind to the savage Inequalities eloquently described by Jonathan KozoL My kids would gladly trade in their Apple lies for the Power Macs that populate the adjacent suburban schools. For Perelman, the bottom line is privatization. But I just have to look at my students and at how well the market has treated their families to know that a revitalized public school system Is one of the few hopes they have of being real players in the 21 st century. Next time, consider consulting some of us who are a bit closer to reality. And, by the way, I pay shipping costs for anyone willing to make a tax- deductible donation of a Mac computer - old or new - to a group of Inner-city kids who would love to have access to some decent technology. For them, the future the schools. Bob Peterson repmilw@aol.com A Fuller View of Romer Thanks for the article on Paul Romer and his invigo¬ rating theories on economics (\"The Economics of Ideas,\" Wired 4.06, page 148). The adoption of these theories by governments and corporations would certainly have a revolutionary impact on both the perception and function of the global economy. However, I am stunned that neither Romer nor Kevin Kelly mentioned that these ideas have been In circu¬ lation for many years. In his 1969 book Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth , Buckminster Fuller states,\" We find that the physical constituent of wealth - energy - cannot decrease and that the metaphysical constituent - know-how - can only increase .This Is to say that every time we use our wealth it increases.\" Fuller had been discussing the realignment of global wealth concepts since the 1920s. While Renter's economic model puts these con¬ cepts into a strict and usable format for today's economies, Fuller deserves credit for his vision.

But these companies are really thinking about market control - rights be damned. When the FBI or any other \"official\" agency can get into your hard drive or scan your email - and they can - you have no intellectual property rights. Rights belong only to the large financial Interests that control the markets, the FBJ, and the government Everyone's privacy matters.

Widar Andersson Stockholm, Sweden Brussels Pouts In Brussels, May 1996 will go down as one of the bleakest In history, not only because it was the cold¬ est month on record, indeed, the heart of Europe was left in darkness by the total absence of US Wired 4.0S. As the odds for maintaining freedom in the Virtual Universe plummeted (thanks to the Communications Decency Act), public awareness of what cyberspace is shrank to the size of a pin head. The situation was bad; It could not go on.... But hidden away in a little cranny surle vieux continent, a trusty little Vector plotted to bring cyber enlightenment to the klutzes who move, shake, and legislate in her city. While zapping on the Web one afternoon, Vector had a sudden flash of inspiration .. Wiredl That was the solution. After a!J, were not ali things explained in its pages? Yet oddly, no one in her Euro-circuit read it She couldn't fathom why not. If Vector could only find a way to make her peers more aware of its importance. With the US Wired, the average Brussels nerd would no longer need to plow through the insurmountable, incomprehensible Euro-jargon. At last, Euro-nerd would be freeeeeeeee and ready to clamber into space. It all looked so good. Had so much potential. But our ta !e ends sadly; it was not to be.Though our dogged Vector knows in her heart what could have been achieved ... the US version of Wired didn't land on planet Brussels: it was nowhere to be found, could not be bought at newsstands or bookstores. Aurore Lester-Smith auroreJester-smith@infoboard.be WIRED SEPTEMBER 1996 04 RANTS & RAVES Buggy R Tech If \"futurist and economist\" Albert Bressand [\"R-Tech,\" W/red4.06, page 138) is going to base his model of the future on his insight into the past, he should start by getting his facts straight A number of points he makes in the interview with Peter Schwartz show that both have serious gaps in their grasp of the history of technology and markets. For example, Bressand claims (and Schwartz nods) that the train and telegraph created the sense of certainty that made possible - for the first time in history - the emergence of futures markets Jhe first legally recognized futures market opened in Japan in 1730, and informal trading of futures went on for centuries around the world before that. Futures contracts have been found on day tablets in cunei¬ form. To have a futures market, all you need is a bunch of people in a fixed geographical area who make their living buying and selling commodities and agree to certain rules of conduct .Technology (exclud¬ ing writing) has nothing to do with it. Earlier, Bressand says that without the telegraph, the train would have been \"just a faster pony express.\" First, the Pony Express was the telegraph system. It carried telegraphs to regions that did not yet have wires installed. So without the telegraph, there would have been no Pony Express for trains to be faster than, Second, early locomotives were distinctly slower than galloping horses for the simple reason you can't send a large machine barreling down a track at high speed unless you have some way of \"keeping track\" of what's going to be around the bend .Third, the first models of \"the enormous Industrial company 1 'were railroad companies, not \"mainstream production com¬ panies \"And they did not spring up \"to take advantage of what was fast becoming mass consumption.\" They came into being because the only way to build, maintain, and operate a national network of train transportation was through an enormous, strictly organized enterprise. \"Mass consumption\" was not the result of trains or teiegraphs, It was built painstakingly, one brand at a time, through national advertising made possible for the first time by the mass medium of print. Print as a mass medium did not come into being until after the Civil War and was the result of two critical 19th-century \"megamachines\" Bressand neglects to mention: universal postal delivery and iow-cost printing, Bressand goes on to rhapsodize that, used properly, the \"new toots\" will bring us closer to \"one world\" which will make \"war... [and] barriers among peo¬ ple unthinkable.\" This assumes that war is an outcome of misunder¬ standings between individuals and communities. His¬ tory shows that wars have nothing to do with poor communication and everything to do with leaders who wish to impose their will on competitors and are willing to roll the dice with their countrymen's lives and resources. No citizenry has ever organized an aggressive war on its own. Every war has been a \"top down\" exercise manufactured both physically and psychologically by individuals with the political and economic resources to do so. What we need from the new communications technology is not \"one world\" - the dream of people like Genghis Khan and Adolf Hitler - but tools for communities - with their very local, human, and sane self-interests - to assert control over those in control of a superhuman concentration of assets. Ken McCarthy ken@e-media.com Notizen I have had about all the \"netizen\" crap I can take. What is it with you people? The Net isn't a culture; hippies are a culture, Islamic fundamentalism is a culture, NASCAR racing is a culture. But not the Net, Why not? A culture has a unifying purpose or glue that sets it apart. It has leaders, icons, heroes, and ene¬ mies. What Is the Internet's glue: connectivity? instant access? freedom of expression? If these created cul¬ tures, we would already have a culture of the tele¬ phone, the postal service - even FedEx. Connectivity is a tool and nothing more.

Matt Bishop msbishop@aol.com Negropundit Time for a sanity check (\"The Next Billion Users,\" Wired 4.06, page 220), If you want to estimate how many people will attend a Swirlies concert, you could extrapolate ticket sales from last year's event and factor In growing demand for records and tapes. But no matter how many fans the Swirlies have, you can't sell more tickets than concert-hall seats. Similarly, to surf the Net you must use a computer. There are about 200 million computers in the world today, and that figure is growing about 17 percent a year. (There are multiple computers in many homes, mind you, and not all computers are connected to a network.) But the Internet is adding users at about 17 percent every two months. So, In less than three years, the Web's growth will be terminally limited, 1 agree that the Web can be a positive force for change, but first we must shed our fixation on cheer¬ leading Web population growth.

THE N IE T Yz IE N The Powers That Were The US is no longer a democracy, but Government by Hallucinating Mob, driven mad by television. Little wonder then that this year's election feels like a choice between cancers. Take heart, because by the time we can elect enough of our own to make a difference, the Net will have changed society so much that the US Senate will seem about as relevant as the House of Lords. By John Perry Barlow 4.09/neti*e*>/ D ecently, I found myself appearing on a panel called “Presidential Campaigning from i960-1996; From Televised Debates to the Internet and Beyond.” I expected the title to be optimistic, and it was* NoL only did we not press boldly on to those unimaginable hustings “beyond the Internet” we rlidnT quite make it past television. Which was fine, I suppose - neither has politics in America, Whether or not it ever will, at least before the United States of America ceases to be a clearly definable political entity, is the question. But does this matter much to the development of soci¬ ety in Cyberspace? Should the netizen bother to vote? And if so, for whom and oil what basis? I was an oddity at the gathering, which was held at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government on the fallen president's birthday* {I sal there imagining the tachometer reading on my buried father, a cowshit-on-his-boots Wyoming politician who, had he ever heard of virtual reality, would John Perry Barlow is a retired Wyoming cattle rancher, a co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and a member of The Well hoard of directors , This is not political coverage as usual* Wired magazine and its online cousin HotWired have joined forces to produce The Netizen, a new magazine/Web site providing an innovative package of daily, weekly, and monthly coverage of the 1996 presidential election, the last surely have thought the campaign of the unwired generation* Kennedys came from there*) John Heilemann is filing an updo- The others on the panel the-minute diary of the campaign clearly belonged to the first in his''Impolitic'\" column on HotWired part of its title* There was fivww.jiehzen.com/!* veteran TV newsman Sander Vanocur, one of the questioners in the Kennedy-Nixon debates; Kiki Moore, a former press secretary for Tipper Gore and now a regular commentator on CNN; Lisa McCormack, who is the publications and “online communications” director for the Republican Nation¬ al Committee and who you could tell with one eye was no nerd. And me. I was the token geek. The program began with long cuts from the Kennedy- Nixon debates, a spectacle l had last watched through 12-year-old eyes and murkily re-remembered subse¬ quently* Seeing them again, I realized that the debates had been important not because they decided the con¬ test for the telegenic young Senator Kennedy - as was pronounced by most observers at the time and has been canonically held since - but because they had fundamentally changed the nature of the office itself. From that point forward, the president became ► 03 WIRED SEPTEMBER 1996 THE H £ T I Z B H more movie star than leader, more myth than man¬ ager, more affect than intellect. From that point for¬ ward, it was more important that the candidate not have a five o'clock shadow than that he have ideas that could suffer scrutiny. Not to defend the genuinely vile Nixon nor to defame the genuinely dashing Kennedy, but I was surprised by the clarity and persuasiveness of Nixon's actual content. Kennedy, on the other hand, said some things that were not very thoughtful, such as his assertion that it was more important for a country to have good missile technology than abundant color televisions. But his appearance , the visual semiotics of his virtual self, was as smooth as Nixon’s was lumpy I was looking at the first decisive national instance in which what a politician said was less penetrating and prehen¬ sile than his ability to look like he meant it And l have had my own confirmation of this principle. Thanks to C-Span (which, as it happened, carried the Kennedy School panel live) and PBS specials, my own talking head occasionally floats around Tele- visionland in repurposed snip¬ pets of videotape, so if people tell me they've seen me on TV, I don't know the context. Trying to determine it, 1 ask w r hat 1 was talking about. They never remember. Though sometimes they say they thought I was convincing. Of what? 1 wonder. The most striking realization that came to me as 1 watched the tapes was that Kennedy was not so much elected president by television as he was elected president of television - that strange projection from which most Americans have since derived their map of reality. He also, in some sense, participated in a process wdiereby television became president. Since then, this medium has defined the national agenda in ways that were often at odds with what might have been dic¬ tated by either sense or experience with un media ted reality, until we are left today with w r hat 1 call Govern¬ ment by Hallucinating Mob. As J w r atched the shiny old kinescopes, it seemed the transformation to this malignant new T governmental form was taking place before my eyes. During several sequences, it was clear that the most important debater was neither Kennedy nor Nixon but the im- nominated Sander Vanocur, as when he sprung on Nixon that his boss, President Eisenhower, had said that he couldn't think of any policy decision in which Nixon had played a deciding role. It was a harder and more damaging shot than any taken by Kennedy. I knew that never before had a mere reporter been able to exercise such power in real time before an entire nation. Afterward, as the line of speakers proceeded till my turn came (the geek speaks last), I heard the bland encomiums that are generally larded upon the Net by meatspace politicos whose knowledge of it, as of other things, descends mostly from what they’ve learned from traditional media; there were no tales of any real adventures in cyberspace. (Though it must be noted that none of them called it the Information Super¬ highway.) They talked about the Net as though it were the ’90s version of the space program, a wonderful and huge government project that America should undertake for reasons that were not entirely clear. They talked about it as though it might have a role in the upcoming elections similar to that played so deci¬ sively by the first televised debates. I don't think so. And neither, I suspect, did they. If any large number of our elected American leaders thought that our virtual precincts could affect an elec¬ tion outcome in their world, they never would have inflicted on us the Communications Decency Act nor most of the Digital Telephony Bill. Nor would they be contemplating other such depredations as the bill currently proceeding through Congress that would abolish fair use of copyrighted material in cyberspace, declaring a licensable copy to be made every time a copyrighted work is written into computer memory. If they thought the hundreds of thousands of angry email messages they’ve gotten from us over the lasL few years actually came from bodies likely to walk into a voting booth anywhere in their own districts, they wouldn't still be answering electronic input with such automatic responses as: Dear friend: Thank you for your recent email message to my office. Please accept this response as acknowl¬ edgment that we have received your message and will note your comments* Most of you will also receive an email response that addresses your concern. Given that the postal service may sometimes be the best way to get back to you, please also include a regular mailing address in your email. This is what I received after Senator Edward Kennedy challenged my assertion that no one in Congress was online. Tm online ” he said. ► If any large number of our elected leaders thought virtual precincts could affect an election outcome, they never would have inflicted on us the Communications Decency Act. s« WIRED SEPTEMBER 1996 IMAGE LOU BEACH THE NETIZEN “Write me an email and see ” In fairness, I'm not sure I want Senator Kennedy - or any other senator - reading and responding direct¬ ly to his own email. Most of Congress is in profound datashock already Hardly any of them has an atten¬ tion span longer than an elevator ride. They are located at a level in the informational ecosystem that has become too rich for reason, Stuart Kauffman at the Santa Fe Institute has stud¬ ied “complexity catastrophe ” in which an organism or natural system is forced by its context to process more information than it can. A frequent symptom of this kind of connection crash is fibrillation - a purpose¬ less, resource-expensive quivering that usually culmi¬ nates in system collapse. It could easily be said that Congress, indeed the entire gov¬ ernment of the United States of America, has already reached this state. But however useless and wasteful l think it has become, there are enough Americans who believe in the comforting myth that their government still works, that its continued institutional existence probably contributes to a calm, however delusionary, among the People. So I s ra not sure it would be a good idea to further inflict the riotous informational fertility of cyberspace upon an organism that evolved in the more temperate zones of the late 18th century, Thomas Jefferson was one of the most prolific letter writers of his time, and he generally produced five or six pieces of correspon¬ dence a day He would have considered it mad to attempt 50 or 60, as l often do, or hundreds, as Sena¬ tor Kennedy would have to. But therein lies the rub, or at least part of it. The political system we've got is too tangled in the para¬ sitic undergrowth of the last two centuries to process or understand what is being created for the century to come. Certainly, the powers that were want to understand cyberspace. They can tell iFs important, or at least that it will be, and, as they would like to go on ruling, they have been setting about in various ways - sSome terrifying, some hilarious - to rule the virtual world as well. But for the present, there are many factors diminishing their acuity on the subject. For one thing, democracy really does work in America. It works in that politicians are extremely sensitive to their mar¬ ket, the people who actually vote. And people who vote have bodies that dwell in precincts. A politician can grab the return addresses from letters he or she receives and give them to canvassing volunteers who will hustle the votes of the senders on their very doorsteps. No one has yet tried to canvass cyberspace. The email a politician receives can understandably seem to appear from the ether. It might have been gener¬ ated by a machine. It certainly might have been gener¬ ated by someone who can’t actually vote, because he or she doesn't even live on the same continent. Of course, that doesn't mean they're not working on it. Lisa McCormack, the panelist from the Republican National Committee (and a smart operative if, well, a bit of a Step ford wife), talked about how proud they were of Republican Main Street, the virtual village that is www.rnc.org/. McCormack had some reason to be proud. The site is state of the art. From it, you can order GOP golf shirts or grab, in QuickTime, “The Best of GOP-IT Download” and watch memorable moments from the Republican revolution. They even link to MCFs Net Vote '96 site: there, they hope to electronically register Republicans using the Uniform Voter Registration Form that was created, ironically, by Bill Clinton's Motor Voter bill. (“In two to three weeks, your official completed voter registration application card will be sent back to you. Read through it, check for mistakes, SIGN IT, and stick it in the mail. We have already addressed it to your state elections official. We even cover the postage! 55 ) But as much as I genuinely admired the work she was describing, I wondered how much good it would do them. Because Fm not at all sure there is a signi¬ ficant cybervote to curry 1 .1 think most voters come from a culture that has been created by mass media - a culture quite different from the one now gelling in The Great Conversation that is cyberspace. No one knows much about the civic habits of the wired world. Not everyone even agrees that “we” exist as a society* I do believe, however, that there is a dis¬ cernible cultural flavor to cyberspace, that whether we're jacking in from Sunnyvale or Uzbekistan, we tend to be libertarian, opinionated, and generally devoted to the free How of information. Whether or not one comes to cyberspace with any greater mission than emailing one's boss from the road, there is some¬ thing about this environment that seems to gradually induce a larger sense of purpose. And any large sense of purpose has political implications. It is my perception that much of the online world is already about pursuing those political implications, by constructing new systems of governance better adapted to a global information economy than those of a 19th-century industrial nation-state. I don't think most of us pay much attention to Washington unless Washington is actively trying to attack the Net. And 1 suspect that, in America, even fewer of us vote than do among the general populace, where suffrage 195 ► Most voters come from a culture that has been created by mass media - a culture quite different from the one gelling in The Great Conversation of cyberspace. 06 WIRED SEPTEMBER 1996 It happens to everyone.

PHOTO ABOVE: WILLIAM FAULKNER ay Old News Classics: Jim Bellows with an early word process or. a A ,| ith the same cold eye that V V sank a million bad headlines, Jim Bellows scans the menu at a Silicon Valley restaurant and orders a way old newsman's iron-gut choice: Phiily cheesesteak sandwich. And a glass of wine, thanks - at 73, you're entitled to a drink at lunch. Bellows, who's sat in more top edi¬ tor's chairs than practically anyone alive, isn't here for his health/'It's like the newspaper wars 40 years ago/' he says about his latest incar¬ nation, stoking the editorial fires for the Internet navigation service Excite,Tm here for the fight.\" Bellows arrived at Excite in early 1995, already sporting what he delights in calling \"'the longest resume in journalism\": Navy Hellcats in the wartime Pacific. Eight news¬ papers, including legendary last stands at the doomed New York Herald Tribune , the Washington Star , and the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner. Four national TV news shows, a pio¬ neering online news service, and, at 70, a stint as West Coast bureau chief for TV Guide, At Excite, for now at least, his brief is more focused/'My job,\" he says, \"is to help people understand what's out there and show them where to find it.\" Bellows intends to do this with Web site reviews - 60,000 and counting since the company went public late last year. Half a dozen of Excite's competitors offer a similar service; what they don't have is Bellows's half-century of experience giving people what they want. He's even got a mantra:\"Tight, true, and somewhat hip, with a little irrever¬ ence, but not too much. Be smart, be tart, and have a heart.\" Bellows isn't fazed by trying to run his operation on an edi¬ torial budget that would barely provide lunch money for some top New York editors. Nor is he wor¬ ried about Internet publishing's reputa¬ tion for spewing red ink.\"I've spent most of my career around Number Two newspa- pers that were losing money/ he says, \"What's new?\" What's new is the Web, of course. But Bellows argues that the song remains the same. \"Publishing - a newspaper, a TV show, a Web site - is about deciding what's important for your readers and creating a personality, a style, a voice. That's what differentiates us from a site like Yahoo!\" That said, Bellows doesn't claim to have a magic road map to the future/'We've taken some little steps,\" he says.\"But it's still a long way to wherever it is we're going.\" - Spencer Reiss The man with \"the longest resume in journalism\" is helping Net users find what's out there.

Green is Kurson's way of reaching average Joes and Janes who have decid¬ ed to play the personal finance game. Kurson hopes to maintain his zine roots while offering sound financial advice to the less financially endowed/information is being taken from the very few and put into the hands of many,\"he says/'Greerr is about making sure the many are well informed.\" - Marissa Raderman QUEEN 09 WIRED SEPTEMBER 1996 U % .

Iz in the 'Hood K okobar owners Rebecca Walker and Angel Williams, both 26, have fused the fashion of gourmet cyberlounges with multiculti values to create the first African-American and women-owned Internet javahouse and bookstore. After the two spent months as the only black women in the Expresso Bar, a popular Greenwich Village cybercafe, Williams decided to transport the concept across the Manhattan bridge. Located off the beaten track in the Fort Green section of Brooklyn, Kokobar aims to draw more people of color to the Internet by providing inexpensive access in a public space.‘'I thought it would be a good idea if someone put an espresso bar in the \"hood,\" Williams says, looking around at the sparsely decorated cafe pulsing with hip hop tunes. \"The of-color community is in danger of missing out on the information revolution,\" says Walker, - Rachel Lehmann-Haupt Wanted: H ome for the Geek Hall t's not in Cooperstown. It's not in Canton, either But one day it could be in San Jose. That's what the folks behind the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame are hoping, anyway. The Silicon Valley Engineering Council (SVEC), which created the Engineering Hall of Fame six years ago, claims it has an \"agreement in principle\" with San Jose's soon-to-be revamped Tech Museum of Innovation to provide a permanent home for the Hall of Fame. But Peter Giles, president and CEO of the Tech Museum, begs to differ. Giles says the SVEC pitched the idea years ago, although at present \"there are no plans to have a Hall of Fame.\"Still, Giles insists he's \"very supportive\" of the SVEC, an all-volunteer organization dedicated to increasing \"aware¬ ness of how engineering affects the quality of our life.\" Lord knows, engineers could use the boose Engi¬ neers are like the Rodney Dangerftelds of the labor force: they don't get no respect. Yet a good case could be made that the pencil- toting slide-rule set has exerted more Influence over the shape of the 20th century than any other profession. The status deficit faced by engineers was evoked by the chair of the SVEC's mentoring of Fame program,George Crothal,during the Hall of Fame awards cere¬ mony in February.\"When was the last time you saw an engi¬ neer on the TV news being hailed as a hero?\" Crothal asked. \"We save lives!\" It's not that hard to sympa¬ thize with CrothaTs frustration. Consider the talent and influ¬ ence of a few Hall of Famers: Frederick E.Terman, co-creator of the Stanford Research Park, was inducted in the Hall of Fame's first year. William R. Hewlett and David Packard got in the next year. And Robert Noyce, the Valley entrepreneur who helped develop the inte¬ grated circuit, is In there too. The game's not over for the Hail of Fame, but it's definitely the fourth quarter.The new US$59 million Tech Museum is scheduled to open in 1998. Giles insists he is willing to con¬ sider providing space for the SVEC.\"Well probably have to reopen the discussion,\"he says. - Spencer E.
