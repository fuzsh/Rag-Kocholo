His former team is getting ready to compete for that ever-elusive championship. His current team has one game remaining in the worst year since the franchise’s expansion season. And Shawn Marion, would like to stick around for the long haul.

It has been confirmed that The Matrix wants a contract extension from the Heat, but getting it will not be a simple matter.

Speaking about his future for the first time, Marion confirmed our earlier report that he ”definitely” would like a contract extension and will have agent Dan Fegan ask the Heat for one this summer — even though Miami’s seemingly in no position to do that because it wants big salary-cap space in 2009.

“I’ve been in the league so long now and I just need that security. Everybody wants that.”

The issue at hand is that the Heat will likely ask Shawn and his agent to take a significant pay cut, and we all know how that will be received.

Marion’s current deal – which he can opt out of this summer – pays him a little over $17 mil, but no one seriously expects him to get that kind of money on the open market. In other words, he’s stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Karma anyone?
