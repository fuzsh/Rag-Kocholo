Former Phoenix Suns star and current Cleveland Cavaliers forward Shawn Marion plans to retire after the 2014-15 season, the Arizona Republic reports.

The 15-year veteran said he had been contemplating retirement for a couple seasons, but the recent birth of his son was the tipping point, according to the article:

A four-time All-Star and one-time NBA champion (2011 with the Dallas Mavericks), the 36-year-old Marlon has career averages of 15.4 points on 48.4 percent shooting, 8.8 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.5 steals and 1.1 blocks. He spent time with the Suns, Miami Heat, Toronto Raptors, Dallas Mavericks and now the Cavs.

Marion established himself as a unique player, helping usher in the current era of "positionless" basketball and playing a key role with the "Seven Seconds or Less" Suns of the mid-2000s. He could shift over from small forward to power forward and create mismatches against bigger players, defend positions 1 through 4, serve as a terror in transition and create scoring opportunities without the ball, and was more than willing to share the spot light with — and even give it up to — Steve Nash and Amar'e Stoudemire.

And, of course, Marion is best known for his uncanny and sometimes hilarious shooting form:

This season, Marion is averaging 5.6 points on 42.3 percent shooting, 4.0 rebounds, and 1.1 assists in 38 games.

Marion has a borderline case for the Hall of Fame, and it'll be interesting to see how the committee ultimately views his career. Regardless, his ability to function as an on-court Swiss Army Knife is virtually unparallelled.
