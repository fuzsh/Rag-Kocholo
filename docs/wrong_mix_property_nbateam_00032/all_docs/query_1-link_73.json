        "text": "Super Bowl packed with Tennessee ties\n\nNew England Patriots coach Bill Belichick was born in Nashville; receivers coach Kippy Brown was a candidate for the head coaching position at Tennessee State; and Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson's grandfather was a professor at TSU and Fisk.\n\nThose are just a few of the connections the Midstate has with Super Bowl XLIX, which will be played Feb. 1 between the Patriots and Seahawks.\n\nBelichick was born in 1952 while his father, Steve, was an assistant on coach Bill Edwards' staff at Vanderbilt. Steve took a job at North Carolina not long after Bill was born and moved his family to Chapel Hill.\n\nThat's not the younger Belichick's only local tie. His fiancée, Linda Holliday, is from Franklin and graduated from Vanderbilt.\n\nThey both ran in the Country Music Half-Marathon last April.\n\nBrown, who is from Sweetwater and played at Memphis, was an assistant on the Tennessee Vols staff three different times (1983-89, 1993-94 and 2009). He became the Vols' interim head coach after Lane Kiffin left.\n\nBefore joining the Seahawks' staff, Brown applied for the head coaching position at TSU, which eventually went to current Tigers coach Rod Reed.\n\nWilson's grandfather Harrison Wilson was a professor at TSU and Fisk in the 1970s. He was a first cousin of legendary TSU football coach John Merritt. Their mothers were sisters, according to hbcustory.com.\n\nSome other local connections:\n\n•Patriots linebacker Dont'a Hightower was a standout at Marshall County and the state's Mr. Football (Class 3A) who went on to play at Alabama. He was a first-round draft pick of the Patriots in 2012.\n\n•Patriots running back LeGarrette Blount signed as an un-drafted free agent with the Titans in 2010.\n\n•Patriots middle linebacker Akeem Ayers spent four seasons with the Titans.\n\n•Former Vanderbilt receiver Jonathan Krause is on the Patriots' practice squad.\n\n•Seahawks defensive tackle Tony McDaniel played at UT. He has 31 tackles this season.\n\n•Defensive tackle Jimmy Staten, who is from Middle Tennessee State, is on the Seahawks' practice squad.\n\n•Seahawks running backs coach Sherman Smith was running backs coach for the Titans for 13 years, and offensive assistant Will Harriger coached at UT Martin in 2005-06 and 2009.\n\nMarion announces NBA retirement\n\nFormer Clarksville High star Shawn Marion announced he will retire at the end of the current NBA season.\n\nMarion, who is in his 16th season, is a part-time starter for Cleveland and averaging 5.7 points and 3.9 rebounds.\n\nHe also has played for Phoenix (1999-2008), Miami (2008-09), Toronto (2009) and Dallas (2009-14).\n\nMarion was a four-time All-Star and named to the All-NBA Third Team twice.\n\nAfter announcing his pending retirement, Marion told reporters he believes he is worthy of being inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\n\"I'm not in control of that, but I think my numbers speak for themselves,\" Marion said. \"What I've done on this court in the last 16 years at my position, I don't think nobody has ever done it the way I've done it.\"\n\nMurphy enjoys return to Tennessee\n\nThe Nashville Old Timers Baseball Association hit a home run Thursday by bringing in former Atlanta Braves outfielder Dale Murphy, a two-time National League MVP, as guest speaker for its 77th annual banquet.\n\nMore than 600 showed up at Airport Marriott to hear Murphy, who said he began his pro career as a catcher in Tennessee playing for the Kingsport Mets in 1974.\n\n\"It's always great to get back here where it all started,\" said Murphy, who is from Portland, Ore. \"I had my first taste of grits and country ham in Kingsport, Tennessee. I live in Utah. We finally got a Cracker Barrel, so I'm able to get some grits there.\"\n\nVanderbilt coach Tim Corbin, who led the Commodores to the NCAA national championship, and Cumberland coach Woody Hunt, who led the Bulldogs to the NAIA national championship, addressed the crowd.\n\nThe South Nashville All-Stars, who made it back to the Little League World Series last summer, were recognized, and their coach, Chris Mercado, was the recipient of the Mr. Baseball award.\n\n\"What great things are going on in this area for baseball,\" Murphy said. \"I've been educated tonight. I'm very familiar with Coach Corbin and Vanderbilt and their success. But to learn more about what's going (on) in this area has really blown me away.\"\n\nJones making splash in NBA D-League\n\nFormer Middle Tennessee State standout Shawn Jones signed with the Miami Heat during the summer and is having a solid season for the franchise's D-League affiliate in Sioux Falls, S.D.\n\nJones averaged 10.1 points, 8.0 rebounds and 1.3 blocks through the first 23 games.\n\n\"Shawn Jones is a vital member of our team on both ends of the court,\" Sioux Falls coach Phil Weber said. \"He continually works hard on all facets of his game, and his play has demonstrated his improvement.\"\n\nThe D-League regular season runs through April 4. Jones hopes to get a call-up to the NBA after that.\n\nProposal on the hardwood\n\nWest Wilson Middle School girls coach Holly Hudson was presented with a commemorative basketball after her team played Walter J. Baird on Wednesday.\n\nIt was Eighth Grade Night, the equivalent to Senior Night on the high school level, and all the players had signed the ball, which was nice.\n\nBut what really got Hudson choked up was what was written on the other side — \"Will You Marry Me???\"\n\nIt was former TSU football player Duvall Young's unique way of proposing.\n\nYoung then entered the gym and at half court went to one knee and presented Hudson with a ring.\n\n\"He had an amazing speech, but I don't know what he said,\" said Hudson, who played on Mt. Juliet's 2005 state championship team. \"Then he asked me and I said, 'Yes!' \"\n\nWest Wilson lost the game.\n\n\"All the girls knew what was going to happen, so I don't think their minds were on the game at all,\" Hudson said.\n\nYoung, who played offensive guard at TSU (2006-09) and was a graduate assistant coach in 2013, and Hudson starting dating after meeting at Fellowship of Christian of Athletes camp last summer.\n\nMajor leaguers to speak at Lipscomb\n\nMajor league players Rex Brothers and Caleb Joseph will be the guest speakers at Lipscomb's inaugural Fast Pitch Dinner on Feb. 7 at Allen Arena.\n\nBrothers, a pitcher from Shelbyville and the 34th overall pick in the first round of the 2009 draft, has spent the past four seasons at Denver after making his debut in 2011 against the Padres. He posted a 4-6 record with a 5.59 ERA in 2014.\n\nJoseph, a catcher from Franklin, made history by hitting home runs in five consecutive games for the Orioles last season.\n\nDoors open at 4:30 p.m. Tickets ($25 adults, $10 for ages 12-under) are available by contacting Andy Lane at 615-966-5853 or Andy.Lane@Lipscomb.edu.\n\nFather Ryan wrestling great dies\n\nTwo-time Father Ryan state champion wrestler Eric Wood died Wednesday. He was 60.\n\nAs a junior in 1971, Wood won the state title in the 155-pound weight class, and as a senior won the 185-pound title.\n\nHe also played center on the Fighting Irish football team.\n\nWood went on to become a pediatric dentist in Nashville for more than 30 years.\n\nA public viewing will be 2-5 p.m. Sunday at Lewis & Wright Funeral Home. Visitation is 11 a.m.-noon Monday at Mt. Zion Baptist Church on Old Hickory Boulevard with the service to follow.\n\nHines to speak to Rotary\n\nLongtime WTVF-5 sportscaster and author Hope Hines will be the guest speaker at the Donelson-Hermitage Rotary meeting on Wednesday at the Hermitage.\n\nThe meeting begins at 7:30 a.m. If you're interested in attending, call 615-847-4001.\n\nAustin Peay jerseys raise $8,000\n\nWhen Austin Peay played TSU in football this past season, the Governors showed up in camouflage uniforms with the names of the units from Fort Campbell in place of the players' names on the back.\n\nThe jersey was not in compliance with NCAA rules and cost the Governors a timeout each quarter.\n\nAfter the game, the jerseys were auctioned off online. Athletic department officials announced that $8,000 was raised and will be donated to the Wounded Warriors Project.\n\nShinn at it again\n\nFormer Charlotte Hornets owner George Shinn, who now lives in Nashville, presented a $1 million check last week to the Tennessee Baptist Children's Homes.\n\nEarlier in the month, Shinn partnered with Feed the Children and FiftyForward, distributing food boxes and other essentials to 400 Nashville families in need.\n\nIf you have an item for Midstate Chatter, contact Mike Organ at 615-259-8021 and on Twitter @MikeOrganWriter.\n\nSPORTS ON NASHVILLE TV\n\nThe top five ratings for local sporting events on television for Jan. 12-18.\n\n1.
