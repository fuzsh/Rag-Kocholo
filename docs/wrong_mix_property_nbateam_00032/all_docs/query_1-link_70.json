        "text": "It's not acceptable anymore.\n\nIt's not acceptable for the Heat to lose in the NBA Finals even after many - this writer included - projected that eight months ago as this season's most likely outcome.\n\nIt's not acceptable to fall flat now, even against an adversary that has proven much tougher mentally than five Junes ago.\n\nIt's not acceptable to fail to finish the deal simply because of the adversity - some real, some media-manufactured, some self-inflicted - that the team has endured since it first came together.\n\nIt's not acceptable, because history proves this is achievable. Since the NBA went to its current 2-3-2 format for the finals, seven teams have come home down 3-2. Three of those have won the series.\n\nErik Spoelstra said that if he had asked his team on the first day of training camp if it would be satisfied to have a chance to tie the finals in Game 6 at home Sunday night and win it here Tuesday in Game 7, every player would have said yes.\n\n\"Every single one of us would have said, 'I don't care what happened during the regular season, what ups and downs, what tribulations we had to go through, we'll take that,' \" Spoelstra said. \"And that's the way this mentality is right now.\"\n\nThat's as it must be. One Heat player said he expected Dwyane Wade and LeBron James to be \"monsters\" in Game 6.\n\nThey better be.\n\nSome inside the Heat organization are stressed about James' demeanor lately, and wonder if he's letting outside forces get to him.\n\nHe better not be.\n\nLosing now is not acceptable, because the Heat must be held accountable. It put itself in this spot by squandering late leads in all three of its losses in this series, including twice when the pace and style were in Miami's favor.\n\nIt's not acceptable, because all excuses have been exhausted.\n\nAll season, Spoelstra was forced to scramble for complementary pieces to the stars, trying to squeeze something - anything - out of a collection of unappealing options.\n\nBut in Game 5, Mike Miller and Udonis Haslem combined to log 56 minutes and convert 8 of 13 shots, with Haslem's unexpected presence for the last two rounds putting the Heat's one-trick centers out to pasture, and Miller's emergence giving Spoelstra welcome flexibility. Even reserve point guard Mario Chalmers has proven more trustworthy than at any time in his NBA life.\n\nLosing now is not acceptable, because this opponent is not invincible. That's not meant as disrespect - I wrote before the series that this Mavericks edition was superior to the one the Heat faced in 2006, better balanced and far less fragile, mostly because of Tyson Chandler's addition and Dirk Nowitzki's growth.\n\nStill, let's be serious. When some of us, way back when, picked the Heat to fall in the finals, we were expecting Miami to face the Los Angeles Lakers, the two-time defending champions, with all that size and the game's most accomplished coach. We weren't expecting the Lakers to come unglued, unseated by the Mavs when they were missing Caron Butler, their second-best player.\n\nThe Mavericks were so lightly regarded nationally that most media members - and fans, in polls - picked them to lose to Portland in the first round, and it was deemed a surprising breakthrough when Dallas closed out the Blazers after collapsing in Game 4 of that series.\n\nThe Lakers were favored in the second round, and still were expected to awaken after the Mavericks swept the first two games in the Staples Center.\n\nWhile Dallas was a slight favorite to beat Oklahoma City in the Western Conference finals, the national narrative was as much about the inexperienced Thunder, specifically Russell Westbrook, blowing it as about Dallas grabbing it.\n\nSo this is what Miami will see on its floor Sunday night, trying to sour its season: a very good team, with an exceptional player (Nowitzki) still at his peak but a couple of core ones (Jason Kidd, Shawn Marion) past their primes.\n\nThe Heat will see a determined team for sure, with Jason Terry speaking again Saturday of being hit by the confetti after the Heat celebrated in Dallas in 2006 and then crying the night away.\n\n\"Something I'll never forget,\" Terry said.\n\nNo, Dallas is not a forgettable team, nor would it be an unworthy champion.\n\nDominant? No. Dynasty in bloom? Hardly.\n\nThis Heat team claimed to be those things, from its moment of conception.\n\nNot one, not two, not three.\n\nNot acceptable to lose now.\n\nNot anymore."
