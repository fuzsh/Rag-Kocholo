        "text": "Welcome to a summertime series that navigates the countless sliding doors the Phoenix Suns organization has faced throughout its 56-year history. The “what ifs”, the “almosts”, the “so closes”; the team history is full of moments, decisions, and breaks (literally and figuratively) that will always leave us wondering what could have been.\n\nThis is Suns Sliding Doors.\n\nSome moments, when reflected upon, are so profoundly traumatic that they leave an indelible mark on our psyche. The emotions experienced in those instances are so intense and raw that recalling them can transport you back to that specific time and place with vivid clarity. You can almost smell the room you were in, hear the ambient sounds, and feel the exact mixture of hope and despair that enveloped you.\n\nToday’s moment in Suns’ history stands out as one of the most “oh no” experiences I’ve ever faced as a Suns fan. It was a time when the collective heartbeat of Phoenix seemed to pause, a moment so gut-wrenching that it’s etched into the memories of every fan who lived through it. The echoes of that day still reverberate, reminding us of the heights of our hopes and the depths of our heartbreak.\n\nYeah. I’m going down the “Joe Johnson” rabbit hole.\n\nThe 2004-05 Phoenix Suns\n\nWhat hasn’t been written about this team? They were different. They were revolutionary. We expected them to be better than the season before, but we had no idea what we were in store for as that season began. Neither did the NBA. The Seven Seconds or Less Era was born with the fast-paced style of basketball led by on-court general Steve Nash, who had returned to Phoenix via free agency during the off-season.\n\nThis was a team that defied the norms and challenged the established order of the NBA. The league, long dominated by imposing big men like Shaquille O’Neal, was unprepared for the Suns’ radical shift in strategy. It was an era when plodding post play was still considered the gold standard for championship contention, but the Suns had other plans.\n\nUnder Nash’s leadership, the Suns orchestrated a high-octane offense that was as dazzling as it was effective. The quick pace, precision passing, and relentless scoring transformed every game into a spectacle. They didn’t just play basketball; they reinvented it, turning each possession into a race against time and redefining the concept of teamwork on the court.\n\nThat season, in my opinion, was the Suns’ best chance at a title. They caught the entire league off guard, exploiting their speed and agility to outmaneuver traditional defenses. The regular season became a showcase of their brilliance, culminating in a franchise-record-tying 62 wins. Every game was a testament to their ingenuity and Nash’s unparalleled vision, making it clear that this team was something special.\n\nAs they marched through the regular season, it felt like destiny was on their side. The Suns didn’t just win games; they dominated them, leaving both fans and opponents in awe. The anticipation built with each victory, as the dream of a championship seemed more attainable than ever before. This team wasn’t just playing for wins; they were playing to redefine the sport, and for one glorious season, they succeeded beyond anyone’s wildest expectations.\n\nNash, who averaged 15.5 points (on 50.2/43.1/88.7 splits) and 11.5 assists, would win the NBA MVP for his efforts that season.\n\nThe Suns swiftly dispatched the Memphis Grizzlies in the First Round, sweeping them 4-0 with a display of sheer dominance. Their next challenge was a high-stakes showdown against Steve Nash’s former team, the Dallas Mavericks, in the Western Conference Semifinals.\n\nDespite losing Nash in the previous off-season, Dallas remained a formidable opponent. Led by the indomitable Dirk Nowitzki, the Mavericks boasted a well-rounded roster. With Michael Finley, Jerry Stackhouse, Josh Howard, Jason Terry, and Keith Van Horn all averaging double figures during the season, they were more than capable of matching the Suns’ athletic style of play. Nowitzki himself was a powerhouse, averaging 26.1 points and 9.7 rebounds per game, anchoring the team with his unique blend of size, skill, and shooting prowess.\n\nThe Suns set the tone early in the series, cruising to an emphatic victory in Game 1 with a score of 127-102. Amare Stoudemire was a force of nature, racking up 40 points and 16 rebounds, overwhelming the Mavericks’ defense. It was a statement win, asserting the Suns’ dominance and confidence.\n\nGame 2, however, was poised to be a true test of resilience and strategy; a tone-setter that would ultimately alter the course of the series and Suns’ history. It was in Game 2 that the series — and the fate of the Suns — would take a pivotal turn, etching a dramatic chapter into the annals of their storied rivalry with Dallas.\n\nMay 11, 2005\n\nLike I said before, some things you just don’t forget. After spending a year stationed in South Korea with the United States Army, I was back stateside for my next assignment. “Join the Army! See the world!”. That’s what my recruiter told told me. I was stationed at Fort Huachuca, Arizona...a three-hour drive from where I grew up.\n\nI had driven up to Phoenix earlier in the week, taking advantage of my leave to catch the game at my friend’s house while his parents were out of town. Little did I know, this would be the first and only game I’d ever watch there. The anticipation and excitement of the evening, set against the backdrop of a foreign environment, added a layer of intensity and significance to what was about to unfold.\n\nThe Suns were trailing by 9 points late in the first half when Joe Johnson sprinted out on a fastbreak. Shawn Marion’s precision pass found Johnson in stride, and with a burst of athleticism, he elevated for what seemed like a momentum-shifting dunk.\n\nHowever, fate intervened in the form of Jerry Stackhouse, who, with relentless determination, closed in swiftly from behind to contest the shot. His presence forced Johnson to adjust, extending his reach to secure the rim for balance. Yet, in that split-second decision to hold on, the unforeseen happened: Johnson lost his grip, slipping off the rim with a suddenness that defied the game’s pace.\n\nTime froze in that instant. The thud of Johnson’s impact reverberated through the arena, met with an eerie silence as players and fans alike held their breath. The sight of Johnson’s abrupt descent to the hardwood, and the collective gasp that followed, underscored the fragility and intensity of the moment.\n\nIn that suspended moment, the world seemed to pause, a stark reminder of the fine line between triumph and adversity in the unforgiving arena of professional basketball.\n\nThe injury inflicted upon Joe Johnson during that fateful moment left a lasting mark, both physically and strategically, on the Suns’ playoff journey. The fractured orbital bone sidelined Johnson for the remainder of the series against the Mavericks, leaving a notable void in Phoenix’s lineup. Despite the setback, the Suns persevered through adversity, demonstrating resilience as they navigated through a challenging series.\n\nGame 2 against the Mavericks proved to be a bitter pill to swallow without Johnson’s presence on the court, resulting in a loss. However, buoyed by their depth and collective resolve, the Suns rallied to win the series in six hard-fought games, a testament to their determination and team cohesion.\n\nMoving forward to the Western Conference Finals against the formidable San Antonio Spurs, the absence of Joe Johnson for the first two crucial games was keenly felt. By the time Johnson returned for Game 3, the Suns found themselves trailing 0-2 in the series, facing an uphill battle against a seasoned Spurs squad. Despite Johnson’s return bolstering their lineup, Phoenix struggled to regain momentum and ultimately succumbed in five games.\n\nThe absence of Johnson during those critical early matchups against the Spurs underscored the impact of his injury on the Suns’ championship aspirations that season. It was a stark reminder of how injuries can alter the course of playoff dynamics, shaping outcomes and leaving lasting impressions on team legacies.\n\nThe Impact of Joe Johnson\n\nLosing Joe Johnson was not just a setback but a seismic shift for Phoenix. As subsequent seasons would reveal, Steve Nash possessed a rare ability to elevate the performance of those around him to All-Star caliber. Joe Johnson epitomized this transformation, thriving under the Suns’ up-tempo style of play and benefiting immensely from the open-floor opportunities created by Nash’s penetrating passes.\n\nDuring the 2004-05 season with Phoenix, Johnson’s impact was undeniable. Averaging 17.1 points per game, he not only showcased his scoring prowess but also demonstrated remarkable efficiency, shooting an impressive 47.8% from beyond the arc. His ability to stretch defenses with his outside shooting made him a linchpin in the Suns’ offensive strategy and a formidable presence in their lineup.\n\nThe Sliding Door\n\nThe aftermath of Joe Johnson’s injury reverberated throughout the Suns organization, reshaping their trajectory and roster dynamics in unforeseen ways. Despite Johnson’s pivotal role and stellar performance during the 2004-05 season, tensions escalated during contract negotiations that off-season. Phoenix’s upper management, embroiled in a financial dispute over a few million dollars, failed to recognize the irreplaceable value Johnson brought to the team.\n\nFrustrated by the hardball tactics employed by Suns’ management, Johnson opted for a decisive move, forcing his way out of Phoenix to join the Atlanta Hawks. His departure marked a turning point for the Suns, who were compelled to reevaluate their roster strategy and approach to building a competitive team.\n\nIn a significant roster shake-up, the Suns traded Quentin Richardson for Kurt Thomas, a move aimed at bolstering their frontcourt presence to contend with dominant big men like Tim Duncan of the Spurs.\n\nUltimately, the decision to trade Johnson and Richardson and alter their roster composition in response to external pressures rather than doubling down on their strengths would haunt the Suns for the remainder of the decade. It underscored the delicate balance between strategic adaptation and staying true to a winning formula, a lesson learned through the lens of Joe Johnson’s departure and its ripple effects on Phoenix’s basketball trajectory.\n\nIf Joe Johnson had stayed healthy that season, the Suns would likely have been serious contenders for the NBA title. His absence during the Western Conference Finals against the Spurs was keenly felt, as Jim Jackson, though capable, couldn’t replicate Johnson’s dynamic impact in the starting lineup.\n\nA championship in 2005 would have elevated the Suns to a new level of NBA prominence and reshaped their trajectory in the following years. Instead, despite multiple deep runs in the Western Conference Finals, they never reached the NBA Finals during that era.\n\nThat season embodied everything I loved about those Suns teams. Raja Bell’s toughness was admirable in years to come, but Joe Johnson’s versatility and skill set resonated with me on another level. Watching Nash orchestrate the offense, flanked by Johnson, Quentin Richardson, Shawn Marion, and Amar’e Stoudemire was sheer basketball bliss for me. Their synergy on the court was electrifying, blending fast breaks, sharp shooting, and unselfish play seamlessly.\n\nThen came that fateful night, etched in my memory like a scar on the hardwood. Johnson’s injury not only derailed what felt like a Cinderella season but also foreshadowed a series of disappointments for Suns fans.\n\nSuch is the life of a Suns fan. Moments of brilliance overshadowed by the cruel twists of fate. Despite the setbacks, those Suns teams remain etched in my heart as a testament to their electrifying style of play and the camaraderie that made them a joy to watch, even in defeat."
