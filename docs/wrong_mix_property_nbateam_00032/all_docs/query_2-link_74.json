        "text": "South Carolina Gamecocks head coach Shane Beamer, ATH Luke Doty, defensive tackle Alex Huntley, and linebacker Debo Williams are in Dallas to represent the program at SEC Media Days.\n\nAfter going 7-6 his first year in 2021 and 8-5 in 2022, Beamer oversaw his first losing season in Columbia last year as the Gamecocks finished the year with a 5-7 record.\n\nLooking to shake off the losing ways of last year, what are some of the biggest questions Beamer is set to face at SEC Media Days?\n\nThree Most Significant Questions for Shane Beamer at SEC Media Days\n\n1) Who Will Start at QB?\n\nWith Spencer Rattler off to the NFL, Beamer has yet to name a starting quarterback for the 2024 season. Former Auburn QB Robby Ashford transferred in this offseason after throwing 1,758 yards, nine touchdowns, and nine picks in two seasons with the Tigers.\n\nAshford competed in the spring with redshirt freshman LaNorris Sellers, but after a strong spring showing, the general consensus is that Sellers has the upper hand.\n\nAshford has more experience, but Sellers has a higher ceiling. Thankfully, Beamer also has Doty he can sneak into the backfield to relieve pressure from time to time.\n\n2) How has the OL Improved Since the Spring?\n\nBeamer made no secret that the Gamecocks’ most frustrating areas needing improvement are along the offensive line, admitting after the spring game that the OL isn’t where he desires it to be.\n\nHe went to the transfer portal to elicit help, bringing in Aaryn Parks from OU, Kamarr Bell from FAU, and Torricelli Simpkins Jr. from North Carolina Central. Former Georgia State head coach Shawn Elliott was also added to the staff as TEs coach and run game coordinator, tasked with helping second-year OL coach Lonnie Teasley improve the line of scrimmage.\n\n3) Is Strength of Schedule a Concern?\n\nWhile this shouldn’t be a surprise for any team in the SEC, the South Carolina Gamecocks were slammed with the 14th-toughest slate in the nation according to the CFN’s 2024 strength of schedule metric.\n\nFREE: Sign up for the College Football Network Newsletter to receive unique stories from the world of college football directly to your inbox!\n\nThe SEC is now 16 teams deep, all of whom are playing eight conference games and at least one Power Four in non-conference. Stiffer competition means tougher stakes as the Gamecocks look to right the ship against an unforgiving sea.\n\nSEC Media Days Schedule: Shane Beamer, South Carolina Head Coach\n\nDate: Monday, July 15\n\nTime: 10:00 a.m. ET\n\nHow to watch: SEC Network+\n\nAfter improving from his first year to his second, Beamer’s regression in 2023 wasn’t in the plan for the trajectory of his tenure.\n\nEven more unfortunate for Beamer is having to replace an NFL-caliber quarterback in Rattler following a losing season while still saddled with a subpar OL unit and facing a top-15 toughest schedule — tough road ahead for the Gamecocks."
