        "text": "This is a passion project of mine that I did during an Independent Study in my Masters program. I only had a short amount of time the first time around so I built a proof-of-concept, but I plan to grow this into a much larger project now. This project will be a foray into using network analysis and graph machine learning to analyze flow sports, specifically Basketball because it’s my favorite sport. I hope this project inspires other sports analyst enthusiasts to keep pushing the craft forward.\n\nI wrote a python script that takes in the desired season’s playoffs games here (NBA Graph Machine Learning Github). Check out the README for directions on how to use the script to get your own playoff data if you so desire. The data is compiled via two primary sources:\n\nNBA games data from Kaggle\n\nnba_api\n\nIn this story, I’ll discuss the network topology of the player passing network in the 2019–2020 NBA Playoffs and showcase a new way of analyzing player & team performance.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIntroduction & Inspiration\n\nNetwork Topology\n\nFlow Metrics\n\nAnalysis and Evaluation\n\nSummary\n\nIntroduction & Inspiration\n\nI was inspired to pursue this project after I read Luís Amaral’s paper on analyzing team based activities using network analysis. Amaral & his team analyzed EuroCup Soccer games based on how the ball was passed for each game. He quantified a new metric for player performance coined “Flow Centrality”, and proposed that it can be a suitable metric to average at the team level as well. Amaral concluded that his approach can be a sound way to measure performance of individual entities in a flow pattern where information, content, data, items, etc. pass from one entity to the next.\n\nI chose to apply this and expand on it to the sport I’m passionate about — Basketball. Basketball is quite different from Soccer so it likely won’t transfer over perfectly, but I do believe that analyzing the way the ball is moved (or lack thereof) is a phenomenal indicator of analyzing offensive and defensive strategy and performance of teams.\n\nNetwork Topology\n\nThese networks have player nodes and 2 non-player nodes (Shot Made and Shot Miss). The edges between player nodes are encoded via their normalized log pass frequency. The player nodes are connected to the shot nodes via their make or miss frequencies, respectively. One side of the graph is one team and the other is the other team. Furthermore, the player nodes are encoded (size and color) by Flow Centrality (top) and Flow Dominance (bottom). These are two flow metrics we can use to measure player performance, which we’ll dive deeper in the next section.\n\nGraph Summary:\n\nNumber of nodes : 18\n\nNumber of edges : 82\n\nMaximum degree : 15\n\nMinimum degree : 1\n\nAverage degree : 9.11111111111111\n\nMedian degree : 10.0\n\nGraph Connectivity\n\nStrongly Connected Components : 8\n\nWeakly Connected Components : 1\n\nGraph Distance\n\nAverage Distance : 0.5294117647058824\n\nGraph Clustering\n\nTransitivity : 0.47277227722772275\n\nAverage Clustering Coefficient : 0.43494245763770245\n\nThe above stats are just for the Lakers vs Heat 2020-10–09 network. It can be interesting to note how this sports network differs from common networks like social ones. Those often have high triadic closure (if person A is connected to person B and person B is connected to person C, then person A likely would want to be connected with person C) and are very large. A network for each game is kind of the opposite — they tend to have low triadic closure (because it’s driven by a basketball acumen of players & the coach and not just social connectivity) and also relatively small. This can lead us into new territory of how to reason from and interpret graph information.\n\nWhen we look at the topology across all the Playoff games, here’s what we find.\n\nAcross multiple games, we do find the degree frequency to follow a slight power law distribution which seems natural. When we take the log of the degree frequency, we find less of a distribution and more of specific values that peak out. This is likely because each game has certain players that stand out, certain players that perform average, and certain players that barely perform at all — and they all fall into very similar buckets. This could also very likely be due to us only looking at one playoff season. If we added more data, we could likely see more variation.\n\nWhat are we really measuring though? What are we looking at?\n\nWhen we measure basketball games via a graph where we encode the edges as pass and shot frequencies, we are modeling the fundamental game strategy the team plays. Each team’s objective is to score more points than the opposing team so this way of encoding information about a game helps us model these objectives well because how players move the ball from one entity to the next is the fundamental leverage players have to optimize for this objective.\n\nTechnically, this can be even more effective if we draw a graph for a level even more granular than the game but that can be incredibly computationally intensive to monitor and calculate.\n\nFlow & Centrality Metrics\n\nWhen we want to reason from this graph, we can use centrality metrics and variants of them to assess importance of players and teams.\n\nAn additional interesting centrality measure we can look at as good measure of performance can be Load Centrality for each game network. Load Centrality of a node is the fraction of all shortest paths that pass through that node. This makes sense in Basketball as you ultimately want to find the shortest path the ball can find the shot made node.\n\nAmaral coins the metric of Flow Centrality in his paper, which is a normalized log of betweenness centrality — essentially how often a player comes in between paths when you have shot made/miss nodes at the ends.\n\nIn my initial analysis of this metric being applied to Basketball (Amaral proved it can be effective when measured to Soccer), I found that it wasn’t as effective of a measure mainly due to the differences Basketball and Soccer. In Soccer, the game is primarily spent passing the ball and occasionally scoring. This is starkly different from Basketball which has less players on a smaller field. In Basketball, we have a much more frequent frequency of shots happening and this has cascading effects in the measurement of importance.\n\nBasketball promotes a rich gets richer effect with the ball — players who start to make more shots will tend to get the ball more then next play and same for vice-versa. There is a more frequent, shorter feedback cycle that happens in basketball which is why I coin a metric call “Flow Dominance” — a variant of Hubs & Authorities.\n\nAccording to Stanford NLP Group, “This approach stems from a particular insight into the creation of web pages, that there are two primary kinds of web pages useful as results for broad-topic searches. By a broad topic search, we mean an informational query such as “I wish to learn about leukemia”. There are authoritative sources of information on the topic; in this case, the National Cancer Institute’s page on leukemia would be such a page. We will call such page’s authorities; in the computation we are about to describe, they are the pages that will emerge with high authority scores.”\n\nOn the other hand, there are many pages on the Web that are hand-compiled lists of links to authoritative web pages on a specific topic. These hub pages are not in themselves authoritative sources of topic-specific information, but rather compilations that someone with an interest in the topic has spent time putting together.\n\nA key assumption here is that nodes that have incoming edges from good hubs are good authorities, and nodes that have outgoing edges to good authorities are good hubs. For basketball, this seems to model our ‘rich get richer’ phenomena well:\n\nPlayer X starts doing well -> Player X gets passed the ball more often (becomes a good authority) -> Strategy shifts around Player X -> Player X has more people to pass to by virtue of having the ball more (good hub)\n\nIf at any point Player X starts missing more then the flow goes in the direction of having the ball less and having less people to pass to (low authority and hub). So, an ideal player would be both: a good hub and authority. In my study, I multiply each node’s hub and authority score and then apply a Yeo-Johnson Power Transformation, and this becomes Flow Dominance.\n\nAnalysis and Evaluation\n\nWe can start to assess these new metrics by measures Pearson Correlation to other measures of success that we already have (Points, Assists, Blocks, Rebounds, Steals, etc.).\n\nYou do see notable players stick out here like LeBron James, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Jimmy Butler. This was the finals that had the Lakers beat out the Miami Heat so it makes sense to see prominent players from those teams. We also see players stick out that we may not expect as all stars like Monte Morris. He played decent but not someone I’d expect to be in top 10.\n\nSummary\n\nIn this story, I dove into NBA Player Passing & Shooting data by modeling each game’s frequencies as a graph. This opens the door for us to look at the sport as it should be measured — relationally. Sports, specifically flow sports, should be measured not just individualistically but as a network. This allows us to use a larger array of metrics to look at performance and strategy, which can yield new insights in how the game of Basketball is played. Reasoning via graphs forces you to expand your scope of inference by at least 1 dimension more. It forces you to think about your data and the concept your studying differently than you would have otherwise; most of the times this forces a deeper study and review into the true nature of the underlying concept we’re studying.\n\nI only measured this for the 2019–20 Playoffs, but for future iterations I think it would be really fascinating to see how flow metrics may differ for Regular Season Games and Playoffs/Finals. Furthermore, I think it would be especially useful if we can measure graphs at a more granular level than at the end of a game. How the flow of a game’s network evolves adds a fourth dimension to this — time. This could also be done with our method if that proves to be too computationally intensive by measuring rate metrics such as Average Points per Minute.\n\nIf you read this and take inspiration to move this analysis forward, please do let me know! I’d love to see how network analysis of sports can go even further.\n\nThis story is connected to my Graph Machine Learning series I’m working on right now.
