        "text": "VINCENNES – Shawn Marion, one of Vincennes University's all-time greatest men's basketball players, will be honored on Wednesday at the P.E. Complex. The four-time NBA all-star and NBA champion will be recognized during a special ceremony at halftime of the Trailblazers' game against Lake Land, which begins at 6 p.m. CST.\n\nMarion, a two-time junior college all-America selection, played for VU from 1996-98. He ranks second on the Blazers' all-time lists with 1,685 points and 923 rebounds.\n\nVU athletics director Harry Meeks said his daughters, Molly and Mel, idolized him.\n\n“He gave Molly and Mel his sophomore year practice jersey, and we still have it at home,\" Meeks said. \"We have fond memories of Shawn.”\n\nMarion averaged 23.4 points per game over two seasons. He led VU to sixth and fifth places, respectively, at the NJCAA tournament in Hutchinson, Kan. Marion’s retired No. 31 VU jersey hangs in the rafters of the P.E. Complex. He was inducted into the NJCAA Hall of Fame in 2005.\n\n“We are excited about having Shawn back,” VU coach Todd Franklin said. “We really want everybody that has played here to feel like this is their basketball family and this is their basketball home, and we want them all back. Getting Shawn back, we’re hoping this opens the door to having more and more of the guys coming back.”\n\nMarion transferred from VU to UNLV, where he led the Runnin’ Rebels in both scoring (18.7 points per game) and rebounding (9.3 rebounds per game) during the 1998-99 season. In his only season at UNLV, he was a first-team All-Western Athletic Conference selection.\n\nMarion was selected as the No. 9 pick in the 1999 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns and played for the team for eight seasons. He won a NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks in 2011. Marion was a NBA All-Star in 2003, '05, '06 and '07. He is a two-time All-NBA pick, earning a spot on the third team in 2005 and '06.\n\nIn 2004, he won an Olympic Bronze Medal with Team USA at the Summer Olympic Games in Athens, Greece."
