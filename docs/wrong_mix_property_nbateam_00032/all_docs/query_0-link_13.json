        "text": "Key dates in NBA history:\n\nJan | Feb | Mar | April | May | June | July | Aug | Sept | Oct | Nov | Dec\n\nFebruary 1, 1967\n\nThe American Basketball Association was born. The league, which fielded 11 teams in its first season, lasted until the 1975-76 season, when it was forced to disband after facing financial difficulties. Four former ABA clubs joined the NBA in the summer of 1976–the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York (now New Jersey) Nets and San Antonio Spurs.\n\nFebruary 1, 1984\n\nBernard King scored 50 points for the Knicks at Dallas, equaling the 50 he tallied the night before in San Antonio. He was the first player to score 50 points on consecutive nights since Wilt Chamberlain did it 20 years earlier.\n\nFebruary 1, 1984\n\nDavid J. Stern officially took over as the NBA’s fourth Commissioner, replacing the retired Larry O’Brien, who had served as Commissioner since 1975. Stern had previously served as the NBA’s first General Counsel and later as Executive VP of Legal & Business Affairs.\n\nFebruary 1, 1995\n\nWith a crisp bounce pass to teammate Karl Malone, who hit a jumper from the corner, Utah guard John Stockton became the NBA’s all-time leader in assists with 9,922, surpassing the mark previously established by Magic Johnson. Utah topped visiting Denver 129-88 and Stockton finished with a game-high 16 assists.\n\nFebruary 1, 1996\n\nChicago defeated host Sacramento 105-85, giving the Bulls a 40-3 record, the most wins ever in a season with just three losses. That broke the 197 1-72 LA Lakers’ record, who started the season with a 39-3 mark but then lost their 43rd game to give them a 39-4 record.\n\nFebruary 1, 1998\n\nKarl Malone scored 20 points to pass Oscar Robertson (26,710 points) for sixth place on the NBA’s all-time scoring list.\n\nFebruary 1, 2001\n\nKarl Malone of the Utah Jazz grabbed the 13,000th rebound of his career in an 87-76 win over Charlotte, helping him become the sixth player in NBA history to record 26,000 points and 13,000 rebounds in his career. Malone joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Moses Malone, Elvin Hayes and Hakeem Olajuwon.\n\nFebruary 1, 2012\n\nSerge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City thunder blocks 10 shots in a 95-86 win over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nFebruary 2, 1968\n\nWilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers dished out a club-record 21 assists in a 131-121 win over Detroit. Maurice Cheeks tied this mark October 30, 1982 vs. New Jersey.\n\nFebruary 2, 1992\n\nMilwaukee’s Alvin Robertson collected four steals in the Bucks’ 122-106 win over Seattle at the Bradley Center, giving him a career total of 1,700 steals, at the time moving him into second place on the NBA’s all-time list, behind Maurice Cheeks.\n\nFebruary 2, 1993\n\nDominique Wilkins scored 34 points to help Atlanta defeat Seattle 118-109, becoming the Hawks’ all-time leading scorer with 20,885 points, surpassing Hall of Famer Bob Pettit, who previously held the franchise scoring record.\n\nFebruary 2, 1994\n\nAtlanta’s Lenny Wilkens became only the second coach (along with Red Auerbach) in NBA history to win 900 career games, after leading the Hawks to a 118-99 win over visiting Orlando.\n\nFebruary 2, 1995\n\nThe Houston Rockets ended Utah’s 15-game road winning streak with a 121-101 victory at The Summit. The Jazz’ streak, which began at Sacramento on November 27, came within one game of tying the Los Angeles Lakers’ NBA record 16-game road winning streak, set during the 1971-72 season.\n\nFebruary 2, 1996\n\nChicago’s 99-84 road win over the LA Lakers–with Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson meeting on the court for the first time since Game 5 of the 1991 NBA Finals–sets, at the time, a record as the highest-rated NBA game ever on cable TV. The telecast on TNT earns a 7.1 rating and a 13.1 share, being viewed in an average of 4.75 million homes. The rating mark stood until the May 21, 1996 Chicago-Orlando playoff game.\n\nFebruary 2, 2021\n\nToronto’s Fred VanVleet scores 54 points in a 123-108 win against Orlando and sets a trio of records in the process. His scoring total is the most by an undrafted player in NBA history (besting Moses Malone’s mark of 53 points vs. the Clippers in 1982) and the most in Raptors history (besting DeMar DeRozan’s 52-point game against the Bucks in 2018). VanVleet also hit eight 3-pointers in the first half, which set a Raptors franchise record for most 3-pointers made in any half. The mark had previously been held by Danny Green (vs. Memphis in 2019) and Terrance Ross (vs. the Clippers in 2014).\n\nFebruary 3, 1980\n\nBoston rookie Larry Bird scored the first three-pointer in All-Star history, hitting from the corner in the East’s 144-136 overtime victory at the Capital Center. Magic Johnson, playing for the West, became the youngest All-Star ever at 20 years, five months.\n\nFebruary 3, 1996\n\nVisiting teams were 7-0, the first time in NBA history that road clubs went undefeated in more than five games.\n\nFebruary 3, 1998\n\nBill Fitch tied Red Auerbach for second place with 938 all-time coaching victories as the Los Angeles Clippers defeated the Utah Jazz, 111-102.\n\nFebruary 3, 2000\n\nThe Houston Rockets honor Clyde Drexler by retiring his No. 22 in a ceremony held before the Rockets’ game against Philadelphia. Drexler becomes the fourth Rocket to have his jersey raised to the rafters of the Compaq Center, joining Calvin Murphy’s No. 23, Moses Malone’s No. 24 and Rudy Tomjanovich’s No. 45.\n\nFebruary 3, 2010\n\nPhil Jackson records his 534th win as the Los Angeles Lakers head coach, passing Pat Riley for the most wins in franchise history.\n\nFebruary 3, 2011\n\nLeBron James of the Miami Heat scored 51 points in a 104-100 win over the Orlando Magic.\n\nFebruary 3, 2016\n\nStephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors scores 51 points in a 134-121 win over the Washington Wizards.\n\nFebruary 4, 1987\n\nThe Sacramento Kings managed only four points in the first quarter of a 128-92 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, the fewest points in the first quarter by a team since the inception of the shot clock in 1954.\n\nFebruary 4, 1993\n\nIn a special two-hour ceremony celebrating his storied playing career, Larry Bird’s #33 Celtics jersey was retired at sold-out Boston Garden.\n\nFebruary 4, 1996\n\nDenver, behind 32 points from Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, knocked off visiting Chicago 105-99, snapping the Bulls’ franchise-record 18-game winning streak, tying for the third-longest winning streak in NBA history.\n\nFebruary 4, 2015\n\nStephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors scores 51 points in a 128-114 win over the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nFebruary 4, 2015\n\nAll five Atlanta Hawks’ starters — DeMarre Carroll, Al Horford, Kyle Korver, Paul Millsap and Jeff Teague — are co-named KIA Players of the Month for January.\n\nFebruary 4, 2021\n\nLakers forward LeBron James scores on a driving layup in the first quarter against the Nuggets to move past Wilt Chamberlain for third on the NBA’s all-time field goals made list. The shot gave James 12,682 field goals as the Lakers won 114-93. James also recorded his 96th career triple-double in the victory.\n\nFebruary 5, 1960\n\nBill Russell ignored a charley horse to grab a personal best (and second best in NBA history) 51 rebounds in a 124-100 win over Syracuse. Fourteen years later, Russell was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nFebruary 5, 1978\n\nIn what proved to be John Havlicek’s last All-Star Game, Philadelphia’s Doug Collins relinquished his starting spot so Hondo could be in the starting lineup. Havlicek scored 10 points in a 133-125 East win.\n\nFebruary 5, 1993\n\nBoston’s Robert Parish scored 18 points and grabbed 14 rebounds in a 105-93 win over Philadelphia, his 1,304th NBA game. That moved Parish into second place on the all-time games played list, trailing only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 1,560 games.\n\nFebruary 5, 2016\n\nHassan Whiteside of the Miami Heat blocks 10 shots in a 98-95 win over the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nFebruary 6, 1970\n\nBuffalo was granted an NBA franchise to be called the Braves. They later moved to San Diego, then Los Angeles and changed their name to the Clippers. Cleveland and Portland were also granted NBA franchises.\n\nFebruary 6, 1988\n\nLarry Bird, who defeated Dale Ellis by two points, left the floor with his finger extended in the #1 sign as his last shot swished in the AT&T Shootout at Chicago Stadium.\n\nFebruary 6, 1988\n\nThe Bulls’ Michael Jordan won the Nestle Crunch Slam Dunk with a perfect score of 50 on his final dunk, in front of an appreciative hometown crowd at Chicago Stadium during NBA All-Star Saturday.\n\nFebruary 6, 2008\n\nIn a blockbuster deal, the Phoenix Suns acquire Shaquille O’Neal from the Miami Heat in exchange for four-time NBA All-Star Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks.\n\nFebruary 7, 1969\n\nRick Barry of the Oakland Oaks set an ABA and professional basketball record by going 23-for-23 from the free throw line as Oakland defeated the Kentucky Colonels 124-122 in overtime. Dominique Wilkins of Atlanta later matched Barry’s feat and set the NBA mark on December 8, 1992.\n\nFebruary 7, 1978\n\nThe Nets were snowbound by a blizzard in New Jersey, forcing their game in San Antonio to be postponed. This marked the first time a basketball game in south Texas was snowed out. The game was rescheduled for March 7. The Nets lost to the Spurs, 129-98.\n\nFebruary 7, 1987\n\nIn Seattle, Michael Jordan started at the opposite foul line to get a running start and took off from the near foul line to dunk without touching the floor in the Nestle Crunch Slam Dunk.\n\nFebruary 7, 2011\n\nCarmelo Anthony of the Denver Nuggets scores 50 points in a 109-103 loss to the Houston Rockets.\n\nFebruary 7, 2023\n\nLeBron James sinks a 21-foot turnaround with 10.9 seconds left in the third quarter at Crypto.com Arena, moving him to 38,388 career points. With that basket, he surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the NBA’s all-time scoring mark, a title Abdul-Jabbar had held for almost four decades.\n\nFebruary 8, 1986\n\n5-foot-7 Spud Webb of the Atlanta Hawks scored two perfect scores of 50 to beat teammate Dominique Wilkins in Spud’s hometown of Dallas during the Nestle Crunch Slam Dunk. The AT&T Shootout debuted with Larry Bird capturing the crown.\n\nFebruary 8, 1987\n\nTom Chambers of the Seattle SuperSonics, a last-minute replacement for the injured Ralph Sampson, scored a game-high 34 points to lead the West to a 154-149 overtime win over the East in the 37th NBA All-Star Game before 34,275 at the Kingdome. Chambers was named the All-Star MVP for his efforts.\n\nFebruary 8, 1992\n\nCedric Ceballos used his “Hocus-Pocus” (blindfolded) dunk to win the Nestle Crunch Slam-Dunk in Orlando.\n\nFebruary 8, 1992\n\nCraig Hodges of the Chicago Bulls captured his third straight AT&T Shootout at All-Star Saturday in Orlando, beating Sacramento’s Jim Les in the final round. Hodges matched Larry Bird’s string of three straight titles in the event from 1986-88.\n\nFebruary 8, 1996\n\nAfter hitting for 30 points in a 107-102 win over visiting New Jersey, Phoenix’s Charles Barkley moves past 20,000 career points.\n\nFebruary 8, 1998\n\nMichael Jordan scored 23 points, grabbed six rebounds and also dished a team-high eight assists on way to being named the 1998 NBA All-Star Game MVP. Jordan became the oldest All-Star Game MVP, winning the award nine days before his 35th birthday. One night earlier, Utah’s Jeff Hornacek survived an overtime en route to winning the 1998 AT&T Shootout while Cleveland’s Zydrunas Ilgauskas, who scored a game high 18 points, is named the Schick Rookie Game MVP.

That streak, which helped Hodges capture his second straight shootout title, broke Larry Bird’s consecutive shot streak of 11 set in 1986.\n\nFebruary 9, 1991\n\nDee Brown used his “Peek-A-Boo” dunk with his head hidden by his forearm to win the Nestle Crunch Slam-Dunk in Charlotte.\n\nFebruary 9, 1992\n\nMagic Johnson, playing for the first time since announcing his retirement on Nov. 7, 1991 scored a game-high 25 points and dished off for a game-high nine assists to lead the West to a 153-113 win over the East in the 42nd annual NBA All-Star Game at the Orlando Arena. For his memorable effort, Johnson was honored with the second All-Star Game MVP award of his career.\n\nFebruary 9, 2000\n\nBobby Phills, who died in an auto accident on January12, 2000, became the first Charlotte Hornets player to have his number retired, as the team had a ceremony prior to their game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Phills’ No. 13 is raised to the Charlotte Coliseum rafters before the Hornets faced the Cavaliers, whose uniform Phills wore for six seasons before signing with Charlotte as a free agent in 1997.\n\nFebruary 9, 2004\n\nRasheed Wallace is traded from the Portland Trail Blazers to the Atlanta Hawks in the precursor to a more famous move. Ten days later, Wallace is dealt again, this time to the Detroit Pistons as part of a three-team deal involving the Hawks, Pistons and Boston Celtics. The trade would help spur Detroit on to The Finals and an upset of the Los Angeles Lakers for the NBA title.\n\nFebruary 9, 2012\n\nSerge Ibaka of the Oklahoma City Thunder blocks 10 shots in a 106-101 loss to the Sacramento Kings.\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\nIn a blockbuster trade, the Brooklyn Nets deal star forward Kevin Durant to the Phoenix Suns as a part of a four-team trade that also involved the Indiana Pacers and Milwaukee Bucks. In the swap, the Suns received Durant and TJ Warren, while the Nets got back Mikal Bridges, Cam Johnson and Juan Pablo Vaulet as well as six future Draft picks and a pick swap.\n\nFebruary 10, 1949\n\nJoe Fulks of Philadelphia scored 63 points in a 108-87 win over Indianapolis to set an NBA scoring record which would last for nearly a decade.\n\nFebruary 10, 1952\n\nThe Baltimore Bullets played a full 48-minute game without making a single substitution, beating the Fort Wayne Pistons 82-77.\n\nFebruary 10, 1991\n\nThe East team scored 45 second-quarter points–the most ever scored by the East in one quarter of All-Star play–en route to a 116-114 win over the West in the 41st annual All-Star Game in Charlotte. Charles Barkley of the East, the game’s MVP, had 22 rebounds, the most since Wilt Chamberlain grabbed 22 in 1967.\n\nFebruary 10, 1995\n\nFIBA and the NBA announced that the winner of the NBA Finals would represent the National Basketball Association in the McDonald’s Championship to be played the following October. The tournament featured many of the best club teams in the world. The McDonald’s Championship, formerly known as the McDonald’s Open, was established as a joint effort by FIBA and the NBA in 1987.\n\nFebruary 10, 1998\n\nKarl Malone passed Adrian Dantley for fifth place on the all-time free throws made list with 6,834.\n\nFebruary 10, 1998\n\nAtlanta’s Lenny Wilken’s earned his 1,100th career victory with a 108-100 defeat of Milwaukee.\n\nFebruary 10, 1998\n\nClyde Drexler notched an assist that helped him join John Havlicek, Oscar Robertson and Jerry West as the only NBA players with 6,000 career assists and 20,000 career points in a 97-83 win over the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nFebruary 10, 1999\n\nGolden State’s John Starks hit the 1,000th three-pointer of his career in an 89-82 loss to Seattle.

Green had 12 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals and four points in a 122-107 win over Memphis.
