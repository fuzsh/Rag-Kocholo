        "text": "The 2014-15 Cavaliers have championship pedigree.\n\nOne of the reasons for that purebred mentality is the presence of veteran players like Shawn Marion.\n\nThe Cavaliers officially signed the 15-year forward to a one-year, $1.4 million contract on Sept. 9. He agreed to play for the veteran’s minimum, even though he could have made more money elsewhere.\n\nThe 36-year-old Marion owns a championship ring from the 2011 Dallas Mavericks – one of eight possessed by members of the Cavaliers team (LeBron James, James Jones and Mike Miller won titles in Miami in 2012 and 2013, while Brendan Haywood was also a member of the 2011 Dallas team).\n\n‘I’m excited to be a Cavalier,’ Marion said in a prepared statement. ‘I can see the hunger and mentality of everyone in the organization and l look forward to being a part of it.\n\n‘The goal is to win a championship and that’s what I want.’\n\nThe 6-foot-7, 228-pound Marion is a versatile player, who can defend small forwards, as well as some power forwards and shooting guards.\n\n‘Shawn brings great versatility, talent and championship experience to the team,’ Cavaliers General Manager David Griffin said. ‘He will impact both ends of the floor and his ability to guard multiple positions will be particularly important for us.\n\n‘Shawn is an accomplished, high-caliber veteran that will help with leadership on and off the court and we’re very happy to welcome him to the Cavaliers family.’\n\nMarion, who will wear No. 31 with the Cavaliers, spent the last five years playing for the Mavericks.\n\nHe’s averaged 15.8 points, 9.0 rebounds, 1.6 steals and 1.1 blocks in his long career. He’s shot 48.5 percent from the field and 81.1 percent from the foul line and has played for Phoenix, Miami, Toronto and Dallas.\n\nThe four-time All-Star averaged 10.4 points, 6.5 rebounds and 1.2 steals in 76 games (all starts) for the Mavericks last season.\n\nMarion, the ninth overall pick in the 1999 draft by the Suns, has appeared in 103 career playoff games.\n\nHe’ll likely back up James at small forward with the Cavaliers.\n\nThe Cavaliers now have 17 players on their roster.\n\nCharge opens Nov. 15\n\nThe Canton Charge, the Cavaliers’ affiliate in the National Basketball Development League, will open their 50-game regular season vs. the Delaware 87ers (Philadelphia 76ers) on Saturday, Nov. 15 at 7 p.m. at the Canton Memorial Civic Center.\n\nThere are now a record 18 teams in the D-League this season."
