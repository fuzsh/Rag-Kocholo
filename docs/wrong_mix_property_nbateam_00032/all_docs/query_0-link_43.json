        "text": "NBA Roundup: John Wall scores 29 to lead Wizards over Pistons\n\nJohn Wall scored 29 points and the visiting Washington Wizards became the latest team to rally past Detroit in the fourth quarter, beating the Pistons 106-99 at Auburn Hills, Mich., on Monday night.\n\nWashington trailed 87-78 before starting the final quarter with a 17-4 run. The Pistons never went back ahead.\n\nBrandon Jennings had 15 points and 14 assists for Detroit, which has lost five of six.\n\nTrevor Ariza scored 15 points, to go along with 11 rebounds for the Wizards, who also beat Detroit 106-82 on Saturday in Washington.\n\nBradley Beal scored 11 of his 13 points in the second half for Washington.\n\nIt was another frustrating loss for Detroit, outscored 28-12 in the fourth quarter. The Pistons have also blown comfortable fourth-quarter leads at home against Portland and Charlotte during the latter part of December.\n\nPelicans 110, Trail Blazers 108: At New Orleans, Tyreke Evans hit a pull-up jumper from 17 feet with 1.2 seconds left and New Orleans beat Portland.\n\nMavericks 100, Timberwolves 98: At Minneapolis, Shawn Marion scored 32 points and hit two huge 3-pointers in the fourth quarter to help Dallas withstand a furious second-half charge from Minnesota.\n\nBulls 95, Grizzlies 91: At Memphis, Tenn., Jimmy Butler scored 14 of his 26 points in the third quarter, Carlos Boozer added 21 points and 10 rebounds, and Chicago defeated Memphis.\n\nJazz 83, Bobcats 80: At Salt Lake City, Trey Burke beat the shot clock on a driving layup with 19 seconds left and scored 21 points to power Utah past Charlotte.\n\nMatched against another 6-foot-1 sparkplug in Kemba Walker, Burke faked a shot, hesitated and drove the right side of the lane, releasing the ball just before the shot-clock buzzer to give the Jazz the lead in the closing moments of an often listless contest.\n\nHawks: Atlanta center Al Horford will have season-ending surgery on Tuesday to repair his torn right pectoral muscle.\n\nHawks spokesman Garin Narin on Monday night confirmed plans for the surgery.\n\nHeat: LeBron James was back in the Miami Heat’s starting lineup against the Denver Nuggets after missing the previous game because of a groin injury.\n\nJames, who turned 29 on Monday, injured his groin Friday night during the Heat’s overtime loss at Sacramento.\n\nMiami’s Norris Cole left the game at Denver midway through the third quarter after taking a fall at the end of a driving layup attempt and hitting his face on the floor.\n\nCole had come into the game in place of Dwayne Wade, who didn’t return after halftime because of back spasms, the Heat said in a tweet.\n\nAlso, Miami’s Chris Bosh was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week\n\nSpurs: San Antonio guard Tony Parker apologized for a newly surfaced photograph that shows him making the same gesture with anti-Semitic connotations that French soccer player Nicolas Anelka displayed while celebrating a goal this weekend, creating an uproar in their home country.\n\nThe photograph shows Parker and a French comedian making a gesture known in France as a “quenelle,” which critics describe as inverted Nazi salute. Parker said in a statement released through the Spurs that the photograph was taken three years ago.\n\nThunder: Oklahoma City’s Kevin Durant was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week.\n\nDurant led the Thunder to three wins by averaging 32 points, 10.7 rebounds and 5.7 assists per game.\n\nDurant scored 29 points in a win over the Knicks, 34 in a win over Charlotte and 33 in a win over Houston.\n\nDierking dead at 77: Connie Dierking, a former University of Cincinnati star and longtime NBA player who was part of the trade that brought Wilt Chamberlain to Philadelphia, has died. He was 77.\n\nHis death Sunday was announced Monday by Cincinnati’s WKRC-TV, where daughter Cammy Dierking is a news anchor. It was confirmed by the University of Cincinnati, where he starred in the late 1950s.\n\nWKRC reported that Dierking fell in November. No other details were released immediately.\n\nThe Brooklyn-born Dierking played with Oscar Robertson for the Bearcats in 1957-58. He later teamed with Robertson and Jerry Lucas on the NBA’s Cincinnati Royals."
