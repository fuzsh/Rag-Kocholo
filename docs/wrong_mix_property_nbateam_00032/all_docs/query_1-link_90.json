        "text": "1) DEFENSE – Adding LeBron James and Kevin Love along with shooters Mike Miller and James Jones brings a ton of offense and outside shooting, but three out of those four aren’t known for their defensive prowess. LeBron is the only one of that group that consistently plays defense with grit and determination. Shawn Marion will help as a wing defender, but he’s not a spring chicken any more. The need for a rim protector is REAL. Anderson Varejao, Tristan Thompson, and if he can play at all, Brendan Haywood, aren’t feared shot blockers. Add in that Kyrie Irving has yet to play defense in his three years in the league, and Dion Waiters is a liability as well, the Cavs have some serious issues on the defensive side of the ball. Those deficiencies need to be addressed either by adding an “Eraser at the Rim” or for the current players to show more determination and give more effort. Hopefully LeBron’s leadership and defensive make up will rub off on everyone on the team.\n\n2) TEAM CHEMISTRY – Ego’s will have to be checked at the door the first day of training camp. Shot attempts are going to have to be divided up amongst a number of ball dominate players, and point totals are going to have to be sacrificed for the betterment of the team in order for this mixture of superstars, all-stars and up and coming stars to gel and turn this group into a true championship contending team. That’s not going to be easy when a number of these players are used to being the number one or two option on every team they’ve played for. How soon this happens, if it happens, could determine how far the Cavaliers can go in 2014-15.\n\n3) HEAD COACH – David Blatt was an “Outside the Box Thinking” hire by first year G.M. David Griffin. Blatt has been a successful head coach for many years overseas, but never in the NBA. How will he transition to dealing with the ego’s that we mentioned earlier? With the rule changes that the NBA game brings? And how will he handle coaching against veteran NBA coaches night in and night out? Blatt as the head coach may be the biggest uncertainty facing this team as the season begins and moves forward. “Griff” has surrounded him with former NBA players as well as former NBA head coaches, so that should help, but David Blatt is still the man in charge and he needs to create his own identity, philosophy and style with his team. What is that? What will that be? Can the European game translate from a coaching standpoint to the NBA? We’re going to find out, and when we do, David Griffin will either have made his first mistake as a G.M., or he’ll continue to look like the basketball “Boy Wonder” genius he’s looked like this entire off-season.\n\nCLEVELAND, OH – The Cleveland Cavaliers have signed free agent forward Shawn Marion, General Manager David Griffin announced today from Cleveland Clinic Courts. Per league policy, terms of the contracts were not released.\n\n“Shawn brings great versatility, talent and championship experience to the team,” said Griffin. “He will impact both ends of the floor and his ability to guard multiple positions will be particularly important for us. Shawn is an accomplished, high-caliber veteran that will help with leadership on and off the court and we’re very happy to welcome him to the Cavaliers family.”\n\nMarion, a 15-year veteran, has played in 1,106 career games (1,038 starts) with averages of 15.8 points on .485 shooting from the field, .811 from the foul line, 9.0 rebounds, 1.9 assists, 1.6 steals and 1.1 blocks in 35.3 minutes for Phoenix, Miami, Toronto and Dallas. During the 2013-14 regular season, he played in 76 games (all starts) for the Mavericks and averaged 10.4 points, 6.5 rebounds and 1.2 steals in 31.7 minutes per game.\n\n“I’m excited to be a Cavalier,” said Marion. “I can see the hunger and mentality of everyone in the organization and l look forward to being a part of it. The goal is to win a championship and that’s what I want.”\n\nThe 6-7, 228-pound forward has made four All-Star appearances (2003, 2005-2007) and was selected to the All-NBA Third Team twice (2005, 2006). Throughout his career, Marion has notched 427 double-doubles, while averaging double figures in scoring in each of his 15 NBA seasons. The former UNLV star is also one of only four players in NBA history to record at least 17,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, 1,500 steals and 1,000 blocks, joining Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone and current Brooklyn Nets forward Kevin Garnett. Marion was drafted ninth overall in the 1999 NBA Draft by the Suns and was an All-Rookie Second Team selection.\n\nA member of Dallas’ 2011 NBA championship team, Marion has played in 103 career playoff games (all starts) with averages of 14.7 points, 9.1 rebounds, 1.2 steals and 1.2 blocks in 37.0 minutes per game. He spent the last five seasons with the Mavericks. Marion will wear #31 with the Cavs.\n\nThe A-Team’s “Hannibal” Smith loved it when a plan came together. So imagine how Cavaliers G.M. David Griffin must be feeling these days.\n\nThe first year general manager looks like he just landed another free agent piece to what he hopes is a championship puzzle, as various media outlets are reporting that free agent small forward Shawn Marion will join the Cavs for the $1.4 million veteran minimum.\n\nThe lure of playing with LeBron James and potentially for a championship this coming season were reportedly the deciding factors, as Marion selected the Cavaliers over the Pacers even though Indiana could pay “The Matrix” more money.\n\nIt also couldn’t hurt that the 15 year NBA veteran and Griffin have a prior relationship, having spent nine years together while Marion played for the Suns and “Griff” worked in the front office in Phoenix.\n\nThe 36 year old Marion averaged 10.4 points per game and 6.5 rebounds per game last season while playing in Dallas. Even at his age, he is still considered an above average defender which is something the Cavaliers desperately need.\n\nThe former first round pick in 1999 by Phoenix, will be looking for his second NBA Title as he was part of the 2010-11 Mavericks team that beat “King” James and the Heat in LeBron’s first year in Miami.\n\nThe Cavaliers have yet to officially confirm the signing."
