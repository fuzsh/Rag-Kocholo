        "text": "Anthony Bennett has been thinking about today for several years — from the clothes he’ll wear to how big he’ll smile and exactly how firm to shake the hand of NBA Commissioner David Stern. All of it has played out in his head multiple times, and tonight it becomes reality.\n\nGetting selected in the first round of the NBA Draft is something nearly every Division I basketball player dreams about but few realize. Rarer still is the top-10 pick, which appears to be Bennett’s fate. Coverage from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn starts on ESPN at 4 p.m.\n\nThirteen UNLV players before him have been selected in the first round, seven of them in the top 10. It’s a special fraternity that spans back to 1975 when Ricky Sobers went No. 16 to the Phoenix Suns.\n\nSince then, there’s been a slow drip of Rebels going in the first round, at least until 1991, when the gates momentarily flooded and a trio of former national champions went in the top 12, including No. 1 overall pick Larry Johnson. More picks followed in the next two years, but it’s slowed back down to a crawl in the past 20 years.\n\nAlthough a Rebel has won an NBA title each of the past three seasons, the first was the Dallas Mavericks’ Shawn Marion, who was drafted in 1999, and Miami Heat bench warmer Joel Anthony was a free agent in 2007. Marcus Banks in 2003 was the last UNLV player to be drafted.\n\nThe Rebels believe Bennett will help change that. The best way to win is with the best players, and a one-and-done success story can help attract other similar talents. That’s the hope, anyway.\n\nUNLV probably won’t have to wait long to keep the momentum going. It would be a surprise if junior Khem Birch’s name isn’t on a lot of draft boards by midseason, and fellow junior Roscoe Smith has an NBA body. Elite recruits play the same mental game Bennett has, and seeing that come true for him and possibly other guys already on the team is a great thing for the program.\n\nSo if Bennett’s about to be the 14th Rebel taken in the first round, who are the other 13? Click through the slides to see where they all were drafted and how they fared in the NBA:\n\nNote: Career earnings, when available, are pulled from basketball-reference.com.\n\nThe '70s\n\n1975 — No. 16 Ricky Sobers, G, Phoenix Suns\n\nDrafted after John Lambert (USC) and before Tom Boswell (South Carolina)\n\n• 11 seasons: Also played for the Indiana Pacers, Chicago Bulls, Washington Bulls and Seattle SuperSonics\n\n• Career numbers: 821 games (138 starts); 10,902 points; 45.9 fg%; 29.1 3fg%; 2,132 rebounds; 3,525 assists; 1,085 steals; 161 blocks\n\n1978 — No. 9 Reggie Theus, G, Chicago Bulls\n\nDrafted after Freeman Williams (Portland State) and before Butch Lee (Marquette)\n\n• 13 seasons: Also played for the Kansas City/Sacramento Kings, Atlanta Hawks, Orlando Magic and New Jersey Nets\n\n• Career numbers: 1,026 games (743 starts); 19,015 points; 47.1 fg%; 25.2 3fg%; 3,349 rebounds; 6,453 assists; 1,206 steals; 236 blocks\n\n• Honors: Two-time All-Star (1981, 83), All-Rookie team (1979)\n\n• Popular culture: From 1995-98, he starred as coach Bill Fuller, a fictional high school basketball coach on NBC’s “Hang Time.” When Theus left, he was replaced by a new coach played by former Chicago Bears linebacker Dick Butkus.\n\nThe '80s\n\n1983— No. 5 Sidney Green, F, Chicago Bulls>\n\nDrafted after Byron Scott (Arizona State) and before Russell Cross (Purdue)\n\n• 10 seasons: Also played for the Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, San Antonio Spurs and Charlotte Hornets\n\n• Career numbers: 679 games (242 starts); 5,080 points; 45.4 fg%; 4,128 rebounds; 635 assists; 369 assists; 223 blocks\n\n1986 — No. 21 Anthony Jones, G, Washington Bullets\n\nDrafted after Buck Johnson (Alabama) and before Scott Skiles (Michigan State)\n\n• Three seasons: Also played for the San Antonio Spurs, Chicago Bulls and Dallas Mavericks\n\n• Career numbers: 164 games (four starts); 594 points; 39.3 fg%; 30.6 3fg%; 214 rebounds; 119 assists; 38 blocks\n\n1987 — No. 2 Armen* Gilliam, F, Phoenix Suns\n\nDrafted after David Robinson (Navy) and before Dennis Hopson (Ohio State)\n\n• 13 seasons: Also played for the Charlotte Hornets, Philadelphia 76ers, New Jersey Nets, Milwaukee Bucks and Utah Jazz\n\n• Career numbers: 929 games (527 starts); 12,700 points; 48.9 fg%; 6,401 rebounds; 1,088 assists; 676 steals; 607 blocks\n\n• Honors: All-Rookie team (1988)\n\n*Gilliam, who died in 2011 while playing a pickup basketball game, changed the spelling of his first name from Armon to Armen near the end of his NBA career because he grew tired of it being mispronounced.\n\n1991\n\nThis is the group that redefined UNLV basketball.
