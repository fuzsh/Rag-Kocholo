        "text": "FOR a couple months now I’ve been saying on NBATV how much I prefer watching the baby-toothed, ego-less Timberwolves (Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Sebastian Telfair, Rashad McCants, Corey Brewer, Marko Jaric and, lately, Randy Foye) than Kevin Garnett’s uninspired, friction-ravaged, selfish teams the last two seasons.\n\nDespite being worst in the West, the T’wolves, I submit, are infinitely more appealing and acceptable to their fans, as well. There’s a lot of on-the-high-rise, coachable young talent in place. Their effort every game is indisputable. And there’s hope on the horizon in place of players’ passports painted black.\n\nThe playoff-contending Trail Blazers are dynamic proof renovations can be successfully done on the run. No doubt, they’re being used as role models by the T’wolves, 76ers, Sonics, Heat and Grizzlies, who’ve all traded one or more All-Stars within the last year in order to establish a more alluring personality.\n\nThe Kings (Mike Bibby, Ron Artest), Pacers (Jermaine O’Neal, Jamaal Tinsley) and Nets (Jason Kidd) are next.\n\nThe plan is to tear things down and give management flexibility to import fresh faces with airborne attitudes. All of the above-mentioned teams either did it or are on the verge.\n\nThe NudKnicks, on the other hand, have neither the stomach nor the Cablevision. And you wonder why they keep repeating mistakes by recruiting statistical-oriented players and self-centered name coaches.\n\nBut let’s not go there, not today, anyway; far be it from me to tell James Dolan how to squander his corporation’s money or bungle his business.\n\nInstead I’d rather quickly revisit the Grizzlies’ tax-deductible donation to the Lakers. Again, while I don’t necessarily fault VP Chris Wallace for trading Pau Gasol, thus creating cavernous cap room, gaining a pair of hallow first-round picks, two talented tadpoles and $3 million, I do believe he could’ve gotten more had he opened the bidding.\n\nFrom what I gather from communicating with numerous GMs, other than the Lakers not a single team was approached regarding Gasol’s manifest availability. Had they been, there’s every reason to believe the Grizzlies could’ve gleaned more.\n\nAt the very least, there’s no way Gasol should’ve been traded for next to nothing except promises of something to come unless Brian Cardinal’s contract ($6.3M/$6.7M after this year) was part of the outgoing package.\n\nGuaranteed, Pat Riley would’ve said “yes” to that in a heartbeat, as evidenced by the Shaq deal. Phoenix insisted Miami assume Marcus Banks’ remaining three ($4.2M/$4.55M/$4.847M) years after this one. I assure you, that would’ve been a Steve Kerr stipulation no matter where Shawn Marion wound up.\n\nMeanwhile, Miami could’ve satisfied Memphis with the expiring contracts of Jason Williams ($8.937M), Alonzo Mourning ($2.76M), Ricky Davis ($6.82M) and Dorell Wright ($2.04M), thrown in more enticing (temporarily lottery protected) No. 1 picks and $3M maximum allowed in trades.\n\nThose salaries meet NBA specifications (within 125 percent, plus 100G) to accommodate those of Gasol ($13.7M) and Cardinal (5.85M).\n\nNo, Memphis wouldn’t have Javaris Crittenton (a savings of $1.38M) to compete against Mike Conley and Kyle Lowry for point guard minutes, or the fundamentally pure 7-1 Marc Gasol, whose NBA future is luminous, according to three Spanish League experts.\n\nWhat Wallace would have is $22M in cap space to sign two significant free agents this summer (“I’m not going to allow the money to burn a hole in my pocket”) or next when there figures to be a more abundance, higher quality choices.\n\nThis just in from column conscience Geoffrey Gilbert: Fans have renamed the home of the Grizzlies the FedUp Arena.\n\nOne thing is indisputable; Miami made out like an ex-champ. Dwayne Wade, Marion, Udonis Haslem, Davis, White Chocolate, Mark Blount and Wright; all they need now is someone to clog the middle.\n\nPraise, Padre Riles; he’s suddenly favored to win comeback executive-of-the-year-in-the-same-year honors. He has rebuilt the team in one startling swoop. They’re a center and a coach away.\n\nHere’s a frightening thought: The Heat could win eight of 10 and be back in the East’s playoff picture.\n\nIt’s been a tough slate in the Bay State. Super Sunday, the Patriots finished second in the Super Bowl. Super Tuesday, the Ted Kennedy-blessed Barack Obama finished second in the Massachusetts primary. Now, ex-Mass. governor (O)Mitt Romney drops out of the Republican race. One more stunning setback and I’m taking down my swimsuit poster of Mike Dukakis.\n\nMeanwhile, Knicks fans were overjoyed by the Shaq trade. It means there’s still a market out there for Jerome James.\n\nThis just in: Isiah Thomas offered James to the Hornets for Fat Tuesday.\n\n*\n\nA fundraiser is being held for the wife of Kevin Houston, Liz, who has been battling the potentially fatal disease Scleroderma for five years but is now wheelchair-bound. The medical expenses and transformation of their home to handicap-accessible has become an alarming burden.\n\nFor those too young to remember, Kevin led the nation in scoring in 1987 while at West Point. He still holds The Meadowlands (Izod Center) scoring record of 53 against Fordham in the ’87 MAC playoffs. Kevin’s dad Jerry started and starred in the backcourt for St. John’s under Joe Lapchick at St. Johns.\n\nDonations can be sent to Friends of Liz and Kevin Houston P.O. Box 1104 Pearl River NY 10965, or they can visit FriendsofLizandKevin.com"
