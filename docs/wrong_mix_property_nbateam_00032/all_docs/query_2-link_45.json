        "text": "Scouting Report\n\n'Matrix' was one of the best defensive forwards in NBA history, and an explosively athletic scorer who dominated in transition. Very long, yet also very fast. Could defend any position. A team-first player who developed an all-round game. Took good care of the ball and didn't foul much at all. Struggled a bit in half-court setups since his style was more suited to an up-tempo game. Wasn't much of a passer or ball-handler (and sometimes needed someone to get him the ball on offense). Had a highly unorthodox outside shot and was streaky on treys."
