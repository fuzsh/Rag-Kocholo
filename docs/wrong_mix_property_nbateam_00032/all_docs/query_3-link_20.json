        "text": "Dotcomology the science of making money online\n\nDotcomology the science of making money onlineInnês Medrano\n\nThis document is an introduction to a book about making money online. It discusses how the author was inspired to start an online business after reading a book about developing multiple streams of income. The author struggled at first to make money online, spending money on various programs and information. Over time, some of the strategies started working and the author was able to make a full-time living working from home online. The purpose of this book is to share the information that helped the author succeed so that others can also learn how to legitimately make money online and avoid scams.\n\nEmotional face-twitter\n\nWhether you’ve been using online social media since day one or are fairly new to it, this 50 page e-book should get you looking at things in a new way, help you to be more aware of your online communications and show you how to navigate your way around the online social media spaces. Online social media for business is about ‘return on engagement’. Connect with people, build opportunities through dialogue that would not have otherwise occurred, then connect them with your business. It’s not irrelevant to you and can be very very powerful.\n\ne-learning_at_the_middle_school_level\n\ne-learning_at_the_middle_school_levelIan McKelvey\n\nThis document summarizes a thesis about middle school students' perspectives on the learning platform Fronter. It includes statistics about students' digital experiences and competency as well as their relationship to e-learning and Fronter based on questionnaires and interviews. Key findings are that students are highly digitally competent and experienced but have mixed views on Fronter, finding it useful for some tasks but preferring traditional classroom learning for other tasks. Teachers also have mixed views, seeing benefits of Fronter but having concerns about technical issues and its impact on pedagogy. Overall, while students are very digitally capable, their relationship to e-learning platforms depends on how well the platform integrates with and supports different learning styles and tasks\n\nSFCG_CMM-Evaluation-Report\n\nThe document provides an end of project evaluation report for the \"Stronger Together!\" project implemented in Zimbabwe. Some key findings include: 1. The project achieved many of its intended outputs and outcomes, building the capacity of communities to use dialogue and common ground techniques to manage conflicts. Comparisons between baseline and endline data showed improvements. 2. Communities initiated collaborative activities like infrastructure projects and engaged in less violence to resolve conflicts. Leaders demonstrated more inclusive attitudes in decision making. 3. The project was found to be highly relevant to the target communities and context in Zimbabwe. The dialogue approach used was appropriate. 4. Sustainability of the project's impacts is supported by communities taking ownership of activities\n\nTowards an Analysis-Ready, Cloud-Optimised service for FAIR fusion data\n\nTowards an Analysis-Ready, Cloud-Optimised service for FAIR fusion dataSamuel Jackson\n\nWe present our work to improve data accessibility and performance for data-intensive tasks within the fusion research community. Our primary goal is to develop services that facilitate efficient access for data-intensive applications while ensuring compliance with FAIR principles [1], as well as adoption of interoperable tools, methods and standards. The major outcome of our work is the successful creation and deployment of a data service for the MAST (Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak) experiment [2], leading to substantial enhancements in data discoverability, accessibility, and overall data retrieval performance, particularly in scenarios involving large-scale data access. Our work follows the principles of Analysis-Ready, Cloud Optimised (ARCO) data [3] by using cloud optimised data formats for fusion data. Our system consists of a query-able metadata catalogue, complemented with an object storage system for publicly serving data from the MAST experiment. We will show how our solution integrates with the Pandata stack [4] to enable data analysis and processing at scales that would have previously been intractable, paving the way for data-intensive workflows running routinely with minimal pre-processing on the part of the researcher. By using a cloud-optimised file format such as zarr [5] we can enable interactive data analysis and visualisation while avoiding large data transfers. Our solution integrates with common python data analysis libraries for large, complex scientific data such as xarray [6] for complex data structures and dask [7] for parallel computation and lazily working with larger that memory datasets. The incorporation of these technologies is vital for advancing simulation, design, and enabling emerging technologies like machine learning and foundation models, all of which rely on efficient access to extensive repositories of high-quality data. Relying on the FAIR guiding principles for data stewardship not only enhances data findability, accessibility, and reusability, but also fosters international cooperation on the interoperability of data and tools, driving fusion research into new realms and ensuring its relevance in an era characterised by advanced technologies in data science.
