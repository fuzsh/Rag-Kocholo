        "text": "PHOENIX -- Former Phoenix Suns forward Shawn Marion is set to be the latest member of the team's Ring of Honor, with his official induction coming at the conclusion of Phoenix's Friday night battle with the New York Knicks.\n\nPrior to the game, Marion met with reporters about the special night.\n\n\"It's surreal right now. Everybody keeps asking me if I've cried or if I've got emotional yet, but I guess I got to wait and see when it actually goes up there,\" Marion said on seeing his name immortalized. \"It's definitely sending chills through my body.\"\n\nMarion played 660 regular season games over nine seasons with the Suns from 1999-2008, averaging 18.4 points on 48.1% shooting, 10.0 rebounds, 1.9 steals and 1.4 blocks. He ranks fifth in franchise history in points (12,134), second in rebounds (6,616), second in steals (1,245) and third in blocks (894).\n\nMany believed Marion's time is coming far later than it should have been, though new owner Mat Ishbia has made good on his word to restore proper change to the organization.\n\n\"This is the right time for this and that's that's how I'm looking at it right now,\" Marion said. \"It's done. It wouldn't be right then. It's right now - and that's what it's about.\n\n\"Mat took over this team and man, it's been guns blazing. One of the first things he did was reach out to me personally and told me what he wanted to do and how he wanted to do it the right way. Ya'll see it tenfold right now. Moving forward. Look what he's done since he's been owner of this team. What do I need to say?\"\n\nThe Matrix is the teamâ€™s all-time playoff leader with 706 postseason rebounds during his Suns career. He twice earned All-NBA honors and was a four-time All-Star selection while with the organization.\n\n\"Reflecting on my journey here man, coming back from out there in Mesa. It's just like certain things are meant to be and certain things happen for a reason,\" he said.\n\n\"When I sit here and I reminisce of everything that transpired on this journey. ... there's just so many things I did here with the city. This is truly a moving, moving thought process for me, man. I still think about it to this day.\"\n\nMarion ultimately won a championship after departing the Valley and landing with the Dallas Mavericks, though he said one of his biggest regrets is not bringing one home to the Valley:\n\n\"That's one of the things I felt like I owed it to the fans. I wasn't able to help bring a championship here. It ate at me a lot. That's one thing I really tried to strive for here when I was here.\""
