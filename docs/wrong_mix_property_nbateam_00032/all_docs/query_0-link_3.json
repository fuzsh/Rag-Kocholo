        "text": "A look around the league and the web that covers it. It's also important to note that the rotation order and starting nods aren't always listed in order of importance. That's for you, dear reader, to figure out.\n\nC: ESPN Dallas (Via The Basketball Jones). Shawn Marion's left hand is not doing well.\n\nPF: WEEI Green Street. Paul Flannery on why Boston earning of the second seed matters.\n\nSF: The Basketball Jones. Daequan Cook lets one get away. Daequan!\n\nSG: Eye on Basketball. Matt Moore hilarious take on what the Heat really meant.\n\nPG: NBA Hoot. NBA stars as kindergarten participants.\n\n6th: Larry Brown Sports. Rajon Rondo is always terrible in March. The ides, man! The ides!\n\n7th: Complex Mag. Walt Frazier, stylin' and profilin'. Via SB Ross Gianfortune.\n\n8th: Orange County Register. Andrew Bynum has been ballin' since the All-Star break.\n\n9th: Talking About Things You Don't Care About. Taking it to the owners on the lockout.\n\n10th: SB Nation. Tom Ziller with a great look at how the playoff bracket should be. Kind of should be. The NBA is divided geographically, and you can't have the Suns and Nets or (in this case) Magic and Nuggets playing in a first round. It's too taxing on teams, media, and would be cost prohibitive in ways that not even a seven-game series would make up for. The league might have to look into dividing itself into a baseball or football-styled pair of arbitrary leagues.\n\n(Image courtesy The Basketball Jones.)"
