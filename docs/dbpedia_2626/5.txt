Humidity

We base the humidity comfort level on the dew point, as it determines whether perspiration will evaporate from the skin, thereby cooling the body. Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.

The chance that a given day will be muggy in GroÃharthau is essentially constant during February, remaining around 0% throughout.

For reference, on July 20, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time, while on September 27, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.

Wind

This section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.

The average hourly wind speed in GroÃharthau is decreasing during February, decreasing from 11.9 miles per hour to 10.9 miles per hour over the course of the month.

For reference, on January 17, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 12.2 miles per hour, while on August 6, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.0 miles per hour.

The hourly average wind direction in GroÃharthau throughout February is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 46% on February 8.

Growing Season

Definitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).

The growing season in GroÃharthau typically lasts for 6.4 months (195 days), from around April 15 to around October 26, rarely starting before March 28 or after May 2, and rarely ending before October 6 or after November 23.

The month of February in GroÃharthau is reliably fully outside of the growing season.

Growing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.

The average accumulated growing degree days in GroÃharthau are essentially constant during February, remaining within 1Â°F of 2Â°F throughout.

Solar Energy

This section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.

The average daily incident shortwave solar energy in GroÃharthau is gradually increasing during February, rising by 1.0 kWh, from 1.3 kWh to 2.3 kWh, over the course of the month.

Data Sources

This report illustrates the typical weather in GroÃharthau, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.

Temperature and Dew Point

There are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in GroÃharthau.

For each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and GroÃharthau according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.

The estimated value at GroÃharthau is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between GroÃharthau and a given station.

The stations contributing to this reconstruction are:

Dresden Airport (EDDC, 62%, 15 mi, west, -194 ft elevation change)

Cottbus (ETCB, 11%, 46 mi, north, -725 ft elevation change)

Cottbus (ETHT, 11%, 46 mi, north, -728 ft elevation change)

Liberec (LKLB, 11%, 47 mi, southeast, 358 ft elevation change)

Prague VÃ¡clav Havel Airport (LKPR, 6%, 71 mi, south, 299 ft elevation change)

To get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of GroÃharthau and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.

Other Data

All data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.

We draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.

We further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.
