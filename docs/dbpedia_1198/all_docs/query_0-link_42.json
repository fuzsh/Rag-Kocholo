        "text": "About six or seven years ago, for reasons I can’t begin to remember, Pete and I decided to watch Three Men and a Little Lady, the 1990 major motion picture and sequel to Three Men and a Baby. It was a weird situation; I remember it specifically being a weeknight. We don’t usually watch bad movies on weeknights, but I’m almost certain this was the case because as the movie ended, Pete went to the kitchen to make coffee for the next morning, which he does every night right before we go to bed. I was distracted by something as the credits rolled and the most intense sense of comfort and familiarity came over me as I heard the words “I hear your name whispered on the wind, it's a soooooound that makes me cryyyyyy.” I snapped to attention and stared incredulously at the TV as I struggled to understand how on earth I’d forgotten about this song for at least 25 years. It hadn’t entered my mind once. And now here it was. Back in my life. For good.\n\n“Waiting for a Star to Fall” was my absolute favorite song in the world when it was released. The experience of having a favorite song for a nine-year-old was very different in 1988 than it is for anyone of any age in 2020. This is particularly true if the favorite song is performed by NOBODY. Because they were ostensibly a one-hit-wonder who were on the radio constantly, I never considered getting the album and didn’t yet know of cassette singles, but it was ok because the song was on the radio CONSTANTLY. But because I never possessed any physical evidence of this song, it was able to leave my consciousness completely until we watched Three Men and a Little Lady on a weeknight for whatever reason.\n\nBoy Meets Girl was first a married-couple songwriting duo who put together some of Whitney Houston’s best early tunes, “I Wanna Dance with Somebody” and “How Will I Know.” They were inspired to write “Waiting for a Star to Fall” while watching a shooting star at an outdoor--that’s right--Whitney Houston concert. Knowing they had a pop classic on their hands, they tirelessly shopped the song around, first to their inspiration and best client Whitney, then to others, including Belinda Carlisle, who actually recorded it for an album, but didn’t end up including it. You can listen to THAT abomination here. Out of options, the duo formed their own group and put out an entire album just to include “Waiting for a Star to Fall” and the rest is history.\n\nThat last part isn’t true. “Waiting” appeared on their second album, but in my mind this is how it went. These two are not rock stars. The guy looks like Michael Bolton and until 30 seconds ago, I’d assumed he was bald in 1988 because despite having the long curly blond hair, he always wore a baseball cap. And not like an Athletics or Cowboys hat or whatever kind of hat white guys wore in 1988, it looks like the kind of hat you would get free from an insurance company. His partner is beautiful, but looks like the second-grade teacher your kids would like best because she’s “nice and really pretty.” Dresses accordingly, too. She completely lacks confidence and charisma. In the video for “Waiting” you can tell she’s really trying, but she looks like a robot doing an impression of Tiffany. It’s bad.\n\nIn the best possible way, though. I love this video. There are three settings: wheatfield with bubbles and children, the shoreline, and in a beach house with a bicycle. The children in the wheatfield seem random. Like, children aren’t the couple’s children. They’re just children. On the beach they’re frolicking and having a lovely time. In the beach house, when not riding the bicycle in the living room, they seem to be writing the song they’re performing in the video, which seems both high- and low-concept at the same time. They’re doing a passable job at looking like they’re having a good time while oozing stiff awkwardness. I love it because they’re clearly EXTREMELY talented songwriters, but performing just isn’t their thing. They’re fighting through it and it’s inspiring. I’m not a songwriter. I don’t think I could fight my way through writing a song.\n\nAdding to my attachment to this song and this story, how cute is it that these geeks were married to each other? They seemed like the kind of married-couple business-partners who really bonded over collaboration. I love that. It’s really fun when you and your best friend/sexy-time partner can click on a creative level. I bet they were creative partners first and then one late night, they broke through their nervous awkwardness over a bottle of wine and well, the rest of this story writes itself. Until of course, they divorced in 2000. I’m surprised they didn’t divorce on 9/11. That’s the only other edit I’d make to this story.\n\nI was so obsessed with this song that I made plans to produce a music video inspired by this one and “Baby Baby” by Amy Grant, another favorite song of mine from that general era (which will not appear on this list because it is not at all timeless, sounds too much like early 1991). The song was “We Threw Up on Nuns,” an underrated tune from our (not Whitney’s) Bodyguard Soundtrack, which has nothing to do with the beach. Nor is explicitly a love song, but has the bouncy, deliriously happy spirit of a late-80s/early-90s adult contemporary love song, despite being literally about throwing up on nuns. We were going to shoot it in Rehoboth in late September of 2014 when there wouldn’t be so many bozos around to crowd our shots, but we ran into budget and scheduling issues. I would still like to do this someday.\n\nI can’t state enough how much I feel this song is a unique, forgotten masterpiece. Occasionally a song from my childhood will unearth itself and I’ll be magically taken back to that time because I hadn’t heard or thought about it in SO long. “We’re All Alone”by Rita Coolidge comes close but that wasn’t nearly as much of a soundtrack-of-my-life track. The first time I heard “Everything About You” by Ugly Kid Joe in 15-odd years was cool, but I hadn’t completely forgotten about it. I was delighted to share this fixation with Josie. I never got the long-form story of Josie and “Waiting for a Star to Fall,” but evidently she hadn’t forgotten about it like I had, and would occasionally--out of nowhere--think about how good the song was. When she told me this, I’d never felt so close to anyone, ever.\n\nI saw Stop Making Sense for the first time at a house that Eric and Brandt lived very close to campus in during college. I’m pretty sure it was on my grad school visit to Ohio State when they were recruiting my cohort. What a weird trip that was. I recall on my last day there, Eric, Mike, Heather, and I made a special trip to Used Kids (iconic record store across from campus) and parked near the then-notorious and now-departed 4 Kegs. It is the Frat Boy Bar to end all Frat Boy Bars. I remember this because as we were getting out of the car Eric took stock of the spring-feverish mass of drinking-age Ohio State students and “charming,” a word Pete and I use to describe aggressive drunken college antics to this day.\n\nAll that said, Stop Making Sense didn’t make much of an impression on me then, but fitting that the introduction was in such a collegey atmosphere. I of course knew of Talking Heads from the well-played video for “Once in a Lifetime” as well as a song of theirs being featured prominently in Revenge of the Nerds. The Alpha Betas were rocking out to “Burning Down the House” when they set their house on fire. This is both ironic and appropriate. Appropriate of course because they burnt their own house down, but also, why were the jocks and face men listening to Talking Heads? I wasn’t in college in 1984 so I don’t know, but this does not seem right. Talking Heads are a band full of exceptionally good-looking geeks and their music does not attempt to cover this up, quite the opposite.\n\nGiven all this would you honestly believe that I never really got into Talking Heads until two or three years ago? This is a source of shame for me, particularly given that at this point in history, they’re as much on my regular rotation as the Ramones. They just clicked for some reason. The start of this Talking Heads kick coincided with David Byrne’s American Utopia tour. The day of the show was--not an ideal day for a big-deal concert. It was the same day we adopted Halloween Jack, so we were kind of tired and stressed out, since he immediately didn’t get along with our girl Betty. It was HOT AS A BITCH for mid-May. There was some crazy Metro closure situation we didn’t anticipate and then had a hard time getting a car and were running late. I didn’t make reservations at the only solidly vegetarian-friendly at the newly revitalized Wharf and we waited forever for a table and then for our food.It did end up being a lovely dinner with our buddy Jeff who was also on his way to the show. Walking to the venue, the sky opened up and we were treated to a signature Mid-Atlantic thunderstorm. I’d paid extra for floor tickets, which I thought would be ok because they’d put seats in, but of course everyone stood so as a short person I was miserable on the floor. The seats were also too close together and bolted together in each row. Ugh, it was rough. David Byrne was great, but I just wish it was a more normal day.\n\nI started this detour with mention of Stop Making Sense, Talking Heads’ absolutely legendary concert film. Along with its soundtrack, it is one of the productions for which Talking Heads is best known and deservedly so. I think what disappointed me when I first saw it was that there isn’t much to it. I guess I expected there to be more frills, but now I see that the lack of frills and the power of the performance is what makes it so special. Stop Making Sense is completely relevant to a discussion of “Girlfriend Is Better” because the enduring image of Stop Making Sense is David Byrne’s oversized suit, which he puts on leading up to “Girlfriend.” He used the giant suit for two major visual tricks. It enhanced that shadow effect Byrne still uses, where a spotlight is put right in front of him and projects this giant shadow on the wall behind him. He also uses it as a prop to enhance the herky-jerky style he appropriately uses when dancing to this song. The motion of the fabric draped over his thin frame is part of the dance. Genius. They’re so good.\n\nI bring all of this up because I have to. When this song comes up, people visualize Byrne’s suit (hahaha) and the legendary concert film, but I fell in love with the album version of this song, net of the truly excellent performance. Bands from the 70s and 80s are often really upfront about the debt they owe to Motown-era R&B and later funk, but this influence was never on display more skillfully and artfully than it was on this track. It’s SO GROOVY. I’m going to credit Tina Weymouth’s bass for this and she DESERVES IT. Most rock n’ roll songs with a bassline as obtuse as it is on this track (and I think other Talking Heads songs as well) fail to balance very well with other elements. You’re left with just a strong impression of bass. It’s here where I think the entire band takes their best cue from funk. Bass leads, but it’s a coordinated effort.\n\nGod help me if I don’t also love Byrne’s atypically effortless vocal performance on this song. This is weird to say about a legend like David Byrne, but he very rarely sounds solidly *cool.* He’s great at sounding agitated, frazzled, forceful, and even frequently vulnerable and sweet. But rarely cool like he does on “Girlfriend.” Thematically, it’s also off-brand. It’s from the perspective of a man in a committed relationship internally debating taking the opportunity to cheat. David! You can’t see me, but I’m clutching my pearls. He transformed himself completely to fit the song. That’s David Byrne magic for you.\n\nI went to an urban high school, lived in a suburb and commuted an hour and a half by bus to get home every day. Kids would commute from all over the island to get to and from school and those of us who would use the same bus routes often defaulted to being friends because we had to spend 10 hours a week on public transportation. You could easily spot Maryknollers on the bus by their uniforms. I rode with my two best friends from junior high and because we lived particularly far out, there weren’t a ton of other schoolmates on our bus route, but one such person can be directly linked to our bridge from alternative music to punk rock.\n\nI doubt anyone remembers this conversation besides me, but it was the very first time Cybil, Alison and I chatted Lisa up on the bus. As kids do, we practically opened the conversation with “so….what kind of music do you listen to?” This was freshman year and my prepared response included Stone Temple Pilots and Smashing Pumpkins. She shocked us by responding that she listened to punk rock. Confused, I was like “You...mean...like...the Sex Pistols or something?” No, she was into Bad Religion.\n\nAt the time I’d never heard of them but over the ensuing months and years picked up “American Jesus” on MTV and certainly heard quite a bit of “Infected” and “20th Century Digital Boy” on the radio. I got copies of Stranger Than Fiction and (eventually) The Gray Race because they were available on Columbia House.*\n\n*It never hit me until I started writing these things how much the economics of music collecting impacted what I listened to. Things are so different now.\n\nIn short, I am and always was an extremely casual Bad Religion fan. I remember leading up to “American Jesus” on Alternative Nation one time, Steve Isaacs said something to the effect of “people say all Bad Religion songs sound the same, but you know? It’s a really good song.” This is true, and is a consequence of Bad Religion having such a distinct signature sound. The other thing about Bad Religion is that their songs are so topical. They’re like Dead Kennedys without the sense of humor. This is unique and a cool idea but not 100% my bag. There’s often very little art and mystery and I feel like I’m being educated more than I’m being entertained.\n\nThen, there’s “Don’t Pray on Me,” to my ear the most distinct and by far my favorite tune by them. The guitar melody is more traditionally sing-songy than what Bad Religion usually puts out. I usually think of Bad Religion melodies being like a fuzzed out crank that’s moving the song along. The guitar in “Don’t” is more fun. It’s almost jovial. There are detours. It’s less *practical.*\n\nLyrically and thematically, the song is really fucking complicated, which is not a departure, but I feel like this one engages a little more artistry than usual? The first verse is about Rodney King and the LA Rebellion (who went 73 and 14 this season they had a great year). This is something I discovered today, which makes total sense given the timing of the release and Bad Religion being who they are. But in subsequent verses, they link together other parallel historical events in which (loosely) the media has obscured the relevant nugget of the story itself (i.e., the impact JFK’s possible affair with Marilyn Monroe on his legacy as compared with his being largely responsible for the Vietnam War)! Then, we get to talk about reproductive choice and my favorite verse of any Bad Religion song:\n\nA bitter debate and a feminine fate\n\nFly in tandem like two precious babes\n\nWhile the former gets warmer it's the latter that matters\n\nExcept on the nation's airwaves\n\nAnd custodians of public opinion stay back after vainly discussing her rights\n\nLay hands off her body\n\nIt's not your fucking life\n\nI always sing this out loud and in spite of myself always get goosebumps.\n\nGive me a sec, I need to catch my breath.\n\nAnd of course we need to bring it back to religion in the final verse because it’s Bad Religion and this time I get it because to review:\n\nThe media totally obscured the point of the uprising following the Rodney King verdict, failed to emphasize the human-rights relevance, which made the whole thing televised sound and fury signifying nothing.\n\nThis isn’t new; media sensationalism has always done a disservice to the actual truth.\n\nFor example in the reproductive-health arena, the focus is on the debate and not on structures that undermine equality.\n\nIT ALL GOES BACK TO THE GODDAMNED BIBLE.\n\nI also think of my brother when I think of this song. We shared it. I think one of his email addresses was dontprayonme@gmail.com somewhere along that line. Or maybe it was a screen name. He was very much into Being an Atheist as a teenager than I ever was, which is I think why he got off on BR so much more than I did. While he was like “yeah! Fuck you, Bible!” I was like “hey, a Bad Religion song I can dance to!” I was really mad at Bad Religion for a time. I’d heard somewhere along the line that they were no longer a functioning band, didn’t travel together, and kind of just kept the machine going because they gotta eat. Some bands can get away with this, but if you’re trying to Tell It Like It Is and change minds, you absolutely cannot. Also kind of highlights the dangers of commodifying rebellious music. I know we loosened restrictions on this since Kurt Died, but come on.\n\nBut these motherfuckers are STILL GOING. That anecdote about their not speaking to each other is like 20 years old. If it were true, or like, even important, they wouldn’t have literally put out like SEVEN albums since 2000. I haven’t listened to any of them and I’m having trouble wrapping my head around who on earth needs MORE BAD RELIGION ALBUMS, but someone must be buying them. I can see there being a greater market for them in the Age of Trump. I’m not really craving them so much as I am a Devo these days. Bad Religion kind of only makes me nostalgic for there being some reason in the opposition.\n\nSince starting this list, I’ve been struggling with what to do with the #47 spot. I’d initially had Michael Jackson by himself here but have been really thinking carefully about whether or not he belongs on this list. I can easily separate the art from the artist because Michael’s crimes are so grotesque, it takes effort to connect them to connect them to his staggeringly excellent musical output. However, I am not a victim of child sex abuse, so it is unfair of me to assume that everyone else should be able to do the same. I know I could have just switched out another tune for his, but I kind of wanted to address this because I do so love “Don’t Stop.” I want to credit Emily McGlynn (not on Facebook, also mentioned in the ABBA post) for kicking my ass about this. I put it on a jukebox in a bar in San Francisco when we visited last summer and she was like “What the fuck are you doing?” We argued about it for a bit before she finally said “oh, you’re separating the art from the artist?” I was like “well--yes?” I think she just wanted to stop arguing about it. She even apologized for picking a fight, but I want to say here and now that she’s absolutely right. It’s one thing to enjoy his tunes in the privacy of my own home. It’s quite another thing to play it in a public bar, where someone more deserving of support than Michael would hear it and associate it with a traumatic experience. The same goes for social media, so that’s that.\n\nI’m happy I am able to remedy this issue by slipping this tune by Bratmobile in. I totally forgot about it when making the list and it certainly deserves a spot. I learned of Bratmobile in college. Pete had the Kill Rock Stars compilation which featured “Girl Germs” which was on Bratmobile’s 1994 EP, The Real Janelle, which if memory serves, Pete subsequently got me a copy of for Christmas or something. Their first album and the Real Janelle EP are great, but sound really different than their two later albums, on which I think they really came into their own. It’s the classic template for a lo-fi indie/feminist outfit of its time. It’s great and I love it, but my favorite stuff of theirs is the more later, denser, more filled-out efforts.\n\nLadies, Women, and Girls and Girls Get Busy are both really excellent albums, but I love Girls Get Busy best. Much of it is a response to 9/11 and the culturally and politically conservative wave that followed. As an aside, post-9/11 music has a deservedly cringy reputation, but it was possible to do great, on-topic post-9/11 albums. Particularly Girls Get Busy and One Beat by Sleater-Kinney. Songs like “Combat Rock” and “Far Away” from Sleater Kinney are squarely on-topic and most of the time, pull it off gracefully. For Bratmobile, “Shop for America” and “United We Don’t” are adequately contrarian responses to a troubling time. I haven’t seen anything that responds to the Trump presidency that fits the mood quite so well (except of COURSE Cancelled, by us).\n\n“Shut Your Face” didn’t strike me at first until Pete told me to take a listen and tell him whether it’s about the Green River killer. I did, didn’t know, but looked it up and found to my delight/horror that it’s about CHANDRA LEVY. I love this for so many reasons. It’s a response to progressive men’s dismissal of media coverage being a distraction from war and presumably other “important” things. After reviewing the lyrics now, they also seem to take aim at conservative talking heads who used her death as a strategy in the context of Gary Condit’s misconduct.\n\nPolitical/feminist music is intended to make you think about things another way and I’m pleased to admit that this one really worked on me. Like a lot of people, I felt like Chandra Levy’s story got the cable-news gossip-rag treatment because it was scandalous and I was guilty of having gotten tired of it, thinking that there were more important things. I didn’t think of Chandra as having lived a life of value. She was just a name in a news story that made me uncomfortable. Put another way, I didn’t think of her murder as violence against women. I thought of it as a thing that happened which CAUSED a media blitz. I don’t think about such things this way anymore. So, full circle: Emily’s calling me out about Michael Jackson fits well into this story.\n\nI would guess that Bratmobile’s unique perspective is due in part to the case being semi-local to them. Just knowing now that Gary Condit’s DC apartment was in Adams Morgan makes the whole thing seem a lot more real to me, at least. I looked this up because the Washington Post had this interactive feature where you could look for all the homicides reported in your zip code within the District. I discovered this fun game shortly after we moved to town, back when we lived in the frou-frou, Forest Hills section of town. I had a moment when I searched for the previous 10 years (so 2001-2011). There was one pin identified on the map, waaaaay on the east end, right in Rock Creek Park. I clicked on the pin and seeing the name Chandra Levy made the hair on my neck stand on end.\n\nI did another switcheroo today for a song I’d forgotten about. Today’s was supposed to be “Alone Again, Or” by the Damned, but I didn’t feel like diving deep on that one. It’s a cover, there is not a lot to say. I did NOT forget “The Card Cheat” (how could I?), but shuffled things around a bit to accommodate a grave error closer to the top.\n\nIs it a meme to have multiple copies of London Calling or is that just in my house? We have three CD copies and somehow four on vinyl. I don’t know where the vinyl came from and the CDs are the result of my husband’s policy to never get rid of any tangible copies of beloved recordings. Even though neither of us would cite it as our favorite, it’s generally regarded as Everyone’s Favorite Clash album. It’s also the most iconic. I feel like it’s the perennial album cover to show up in music snobs’ record collections in movies like Singles and High Fidelity. All of those copies of records have to end up somewhere. I guess they landed in my record collection.\n\nIt was at one time my favorite Clash album, but I hated how predictable that sounded coming out of my mouth. And in terms of quality, it’s so close to the self-titled and Give ‘Em Enough Rope, that I just went with the latter because I love it too, and it sounds so much more thoughtful. When I discovered the Clash, ska was still my main thing, which kind of explains why London Calling appealed so much. All Clash albums have reggae influence to varying degrees. Eliminating the (still truly great but) lawless chaos that is Sandinista!, London Calling is the most unabashedly reggae-influenced of the Clash’s great albums. Though that also oversimplifies some of the crazy, genre-colliding experimentation done on this record, exemplified well on “The Card Cheat.”\n\nIn doing my pre-post reading, I’ve realized that there’s no guitar in this song. Son of a bitch! I never noticed in 25-odd years of listening to London Calling. Or maybe I just never conceptualized it. I guess I can be excused. There was slight-of-hand in the production. They were going for a big, loud, wall-of-sound effect and recorded the track twice. Pete does this. He tells me it’s ok because Kurt Cobain thought it was ok, reasoning that John Lennon thought it was ok. And now “The Card Cheat.” Why doesn’t everyone do this all the time? It’s so effective! Particularly on “The Card Cheat.” Big bass, big piano, big horns. It’s rich and it’s wonderful. Guitar would just dilute it.\n\nOther notable factoids I’m putting here because there’s nowhere else to put them: this song has no chorus and it has never been played live.\n\nAs it is, this song is so majestic. It sounds like it could be a national anthem for some obscure European monarchy. I think that’s the intended effect. The lyrics take you through the story of a sad/lonely gambler cheating at cards (as the title would suggest). The dealer catches and shoots him. I’ve read a handful of armchair analyses of this song and it’s clear to me we all agree there’s subtext. Others seem to think it’s about mortality? Like, an everything-ends kind of thing, whether it’s life or love. I mean, maybe. But I took a lot from the SIXTH VERSE:\n\nFrom the Hundred Year War to the Crimea\n\nWith a lance and a musket and a Roman spear\n\nTo all of the men who have stood with no fear\n\nIn the service of the King\n\nThat would suggest that all of this is a metaphor for the crumbling British empire, no? Gambling is in place for colonial occupation/control? Every empire’s rise has a fall? It’s not just me, I discussed this with someone else who cited “The Card Cheat” as their favorite Clash song. I was like “Colonialism!” and he was like “YES THANK YOU!” On longform analyses of the human mortality interpretation, I’ve seen responses echoing my own thoughts: “yeah but what about the British empire’s fall?”\n\nI was surprised by how little beard-stroking about this song I was able to find. It seems like it would invite 1,000 pontificators to write pages and pages on it. I’ve also read it referred to as a throwaway-track? I don’t think there *is* a throwaway track on London Calling. If there were, they could have cut them and not released a double album! Natalie recently shared an anniversary retrospective on London Calling which effectively referred to “Wrong ‘Em Boyo” as unlovable, which is incorrect, but I’d also go to the mat for any of these songs besides maybe “Koka Kola.” How much do you want to bet, though, that there’s someone out there that would get into a fist fight with the Independent about “Koka Kola?” That’s probably why London Calling is so enduring. It’s uniquely personal to a lot of people.\n\nI took yesterday off because I didn’t have my thoughts 100% together and just needed a break. What is there to say about “Israelites?” It’s a perfect song. It swings, it’s performed with intensity and conviction, it’s the exact right length. I have nothing of substance to add, so my focus here is just going to be on my personal relationship with it.\n\nI learned of “Israelites” in the late 90s because of the TV ads for the Pure Reggae compilation. I don’t mind admitting this because it’s hilarious. Pure Reggae was one of the very last iconic compilations with a strong television marketing campaign behind it. It frightens me to think about how some on my friends list are too young to remember when this was a Thing but in its day, televised ads for these kinds of compilations were so repetitive that out of nowhere you could have a handful of lines from Tears for Fears’ “Shout” in your head before you’d get mental whiplash and it would switch to “Hold Me Now” by the Thompson Twins just because of these commercials. The compilations were often time- and/or theme-specific. I think there were a variety of publishing houses that would put these out, but the best-known was Time-Life. Sometimes they’d just be a standard-length album and other times they’d include like 10 LPs or 8 cassettes (your choice). If you’re interested the Time-Life website still has these sets and they’re absurdly expensive.\n\nThe ubiquity of the TV ads was pre-internet, of course. Spotify has thousands of playlists with similar time and genre parameters that you can listen to any time, for free. One weird footnote of this historical-cultural curiosity is the mind-boggling success of the Now That’s What I Call Music series. I was shocked to learn that Volume 1 was released in 1983 (???!!!!), but I associate them with the fall of civilization, c. late-90s, early-2000s, CE. Of the official volumes, the most recent is #106, which was released last month. These are compilations that had a strong TV-advertising presence but were also found in stores. The degree to which these compilations have been certified platinum multiple times is STAGGERING and a little sickening and has continued while most of the rest of the tangible-media music market flounders. Look at the Wikipedia page; it’s crazy.\n\nI digress. The TV ads for Pure Reggae coincided with my TV-watching peak, during college, when Pete and I had a lot of time, cable TV, and very little money. As such our Pure Reggae consciousness saturation was 100%. We shared our interest in the compilation with my mom, who also watched a lot of cable TV (in her case it was watching the Food Network or ironically watching Fox News as opposed to MTV2 and Golden Girls on Lifetime in our case). We each got a copy. I believe my mom ordered it from TV and I *think* I bought Pete a copy on Amazon, back when Jeff Bezos was but a multi-millionaire. I used my very first credit card, a student Capital One card that had a $200 limit, which was still enough to ruin my life for a little while.\n\nI regret to inform you that Pure Reggae Volume 1 is NOT available on Spotify. There’s some imposter, which includes “Israelites,” is not the correct compilation and is fortunately/unfortunately far more high-brow than the old favorite edition. For reference, here is the tracklisting:\n\n1 Bob Marley & The Wailers - Stir it Up\n\n2 Aswad - Don't Turn Around\n\n3 Arrow - Hot Hot Hot\n\n4 Third World - Now That We Found Love\n\n5 Inner Circle - Bad Boys\n\n6 Eric Clapton - I Shot the Sheriff\n\n7 Desmond Dekker - Israelites\n\n8 The Melodians - Rivers of Babylon\n\n9 Jimmy Cliff - Many Rivers to Cross\n\n10 Chaka Demus & Pliers - Tease Me\n\n11 Freddie Notes & The Rudies - Montego Bay\n\n12 Lord Creator - Kingston Town\n\n13 Millie Small - My Boy Lollipop\n\n14 Apache Indian - Boom Shakalak\n\n15 Eddy Grant - Electric Avenue\n\n16 Big Mountain - Baby, I Love Your Way\n\n17 Dawn Penn - You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)\n\n18 Bob Marley & The Wailers - Exodus\n\nPart of the miracle of this compilation is that there’s a lot of fun trash on it, but there’s a lot of really, REALLY great stuff here, too. I wouldn’t think it was medically possible, but I love hearing “Bad Boys” in non-COPS contexts (which is now the only way to hear it; RIP COPS). Can anyone listen to “Tease Me” without doing the “meow” in the chorus? “Baby I Love Your Way,” which is Frampton trash to begin with, was given the reggae treatment by an otherwise excellent artist and then was drilled into the ground by the Reality Bites soundtrack and received an exhausting amount of play on alternative radio in the mid-90s. I legitimately hate it. However, hearing this compilation was also my introduction to the original version of “Rivers of Babylon” and easily my second favorite on the collection, “Montego Bay,” which I can’t wait to hear again when I dig out our CD after I’m done writing this up. THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION.\n\nANYway, as mentioned, Pete and I loved “Israelites” best and picked up a number of Desmond Dekker’s collections and his entire repertoire is fucking solid. “007 (Shanty Town)” is another stone-cold classic and appears on the soundtrack album to The Harder They Come, which is Pete’s current favorite morning listen. We watched the film for the first time recently and it wasn’t High Cinema, but both fun and bad-ass. I hope this isn’t too white-girl of me, but Jimmy Cliff was a hottie back in the day, too. “Honour Your Mother and Father” also slaps, despite the wholly unappealing title and “It Mek” is groovy as hell. He’s just the best. DEFINITELY check out the unofficial video I’ve linked here. He was a killer performer.\n\nAnother quick note about “Israelites.” For some reason Pete and I decided that it was our first cat’s favorite song. He was named Milo after Milo Aukerman of the Descendents. Milo would sing it, we decided, and would change the lyrics to the “Miloites.” We also decided that he loved breakfast best, out of all meals.\n\nSo there you have it. DJ on Pure Reggae and “Israelites.”\n\nI think that I’d have to turn in my District of Columbia driver’s license if I didn’t include a Dischord band on this list, so I’m not going to try to be cute. I picked Fugazi. The song isn’t completely obvious though, so give me credit for that at least.\n\nI knew of Fugazi in the mid-90s when “Waiting Room” got some delayed-response alternative radio airplay. I would also see kids wearing the iconic “This is not a Fugazi shirt” tees around town and at shows and such. Shockingly, Fugazi made it out to Hawaii in 1996. A pitfall of growing up in a tropical paradise is that touring bands can’t always come through, but Fugazi made it, playing one show in Honolulu and for some reason TWO in Maui. For whatever reason, I did not go. The Honolulu show was on October 16 (thank you, Discord’s website), which was a Wednesday. There’s always so much going on in Octobers. I remember that was the year that my friends and I went for Halloween dressed as the Seven Deadly Sins and we got as much mileage out of those costumes as we possibly could, but the 16th seems rather early to be going through all of that? I can’t explain this. I do recall that they made good on their infamous $5 admission goal, despite the considerable expense it takes to play in Hawaii.\n\nBut I didn’t have an album or really get into them until college. Here’s where I admit that then and ever since, I remain a casual fan. I respect them a lot, but they’re intentionally unflashy and I don’t like unflashy music. They’re like punk granola. So here’s the story of my transition from a person who wanted say she liked Fugazi to a person who likes Fugazi fairly well.\n\nI’ve made mention of the radio show Pete and I hosted during college. KTUH’s primary format was jazz, but they also had genre and freeform slots. We started out in the 3-6:00 AM freeform slot Friday mornings where we could play anything we wanted before graduating to a “rock” show, which ran from 9-midnight on Friday evenings. The rock format was basically freeform. I think one of the rock slots was filled by a techno/house guy at one point. Nobody was watching what we did carefully enough to notice whether we broke format, though. It was very college-radio.\n\nI’ve also mentioned before that we mostly brought our own stuff. Ugh, what shit that was, hauling all of our hard-copy compact discs up those stairs. I had one of those long pine storage crates that held like 70 or 100 discs and just used to bring them all with me every week. Pete would carefully pick old favorites and wildcard selections to mix things up. Some songs albums we’d play from every week. We would always close the show which we called Underground Babylon with the eponymous track by nobody-80s punk band Catholic Discipline, probably only known for their appearance in the Decline of Western Civilization.\n\nANYWAY. Our tenure was just before digital music was very much a thing. KTUH’s in-house collection was moderate. Moderate, I think for a radio station. They had hundreds (maybe thousands?) of CDs and LPs. There was a tape deck in the studio but I don’t think they had any cassettes. A section of one of the walls in the studio had a floor-to-ceiling rack about four feet wide* with what we referred to as “carts,” the technical term for which I learned just now is the Fidelipac. It was a cartridge that looked a bit like an 8-track cartridge but I think it was a little thicker and maybe more narrow. They were developed especially for radio play which makes total sense to me because if you’re feeling lazy they’re LIFESAVERS. There was no cueing, no rewinding, you just stuck it into the player and it played. It was awesome.\n\n*You can get a visual approximation of this in the 1996 major motion picture, Jingle All the Way. Martin Mull plays a radio DJ who teases giving away a Turbo Man action figure. Sinbad and Arnold Schwarzenegger storm the place, get in a scuffle and slam into the cart rack on the wall, jostling a dozen or so carts off of the rack and on to the floor.\n\nBecause these were so convenient, we always ended up grabbing them if we were in a pinch because we’d zoned out and didn’t cue anything else up. Unfortunately, there were just a couple of songs on these carts that fit our general format. It was a blue cart with one of those white file folder labels with the colored stripe across the top. In typewritten letters the label said Fugazi “Merchandise.”\n\nWe’d never actually heard the song before playing it and because we eventually played it so frequently, it bore its way into my consciousness. The Christmas after we discovered the song, I got Pete a copy of Repeater +3 Songs, which is still my favorite album by them. Pete took this and ran and eventually collected all of them and became my household’s big Fugazi fan.\n\nAll of this seems like a lead-up to a sentimental favorite, but it isn’t because this song stands up to the extent that I’m surprised that it’s not a standout to anyone else besides me, Pete and a couple of dozen 40somethings who lived in KTUH’s broadcast range c. 1998-2001. It has everything a Fugazi song should have. The bass* and guitar almost seem to be competing with each other for your attention which sounds like a criticism but isn’t. This all comes to a head in the bridge when the bass takes the spotlight for a sec before the guitar joins back again as if to say “yeah, that’s it.” Ian is on lead vocals in this one but Guy Picciotto steals the show with his minimal echoing which again seems to say “yeah, that’s it.”\n\n*The bass, which is played by Joe Lally, whose nephew I started work with at Westat on the same day. We are still pals.\n\nThe lyrics are what first entranced me so. As the title would suggest, “Merchandise” is an anti-materialist anthem where the lyrics are pretty simple. At the time, I saw the theme of minimalism = freedom to be fairly novel. It’s worth mentioning that before I looked the lyrics up during my pre-post prep I’d misheard the refrain\n\nWe owe you nothing\n\nYou have no control\n\nAs\n\nWe ain’t nothing\n\nYou have no control\n\nWhich makes no sense but I kind of thought maybe to the second person in the song those who have nothing aren’t anything? I like it better as written.\n\nI’m not sure how unique it is, but as a child and a teenager, I have a long history of enjoying movie soundtrack albums. In my household, that’s a quirk. Pete and I were just talking this morning about how the soundtrack to The Harder They Come is the first one he’s ever really clicked with. That is not the case for me. Here are all the soundtracks I’ve owned and enjoyed in their time, in chronological order:\n\nLa Bamba, 1987\n\nCocktail, 1988\n\nPretty Woman, 1990\n\nWayne's World, 1992\n\nSingles, 1992\n\nLast Action Hero, 1993\n\nSo I Married an Axe Murderer, 1993\n\nConeheads, 1993\n\nJudgement Night, 1994\n\nAngus, 1995\n\nClueless, 1995\n\nGrosse Pointe Blank, 1997\n\nThese are better than mere compilations. Compilations are just a pile of songs that are connected by a record label, producer, a genre, or some combination. The best movie soundtracks establish a mood, time, and place. There were several movies I may not have sat down and watched if not for the soundtrack. Angus is a good example. I think I was already older than the protagonists when it came out and it was highly questionable why I’d go out and see a movie about a younger, outcast kid and how he bonded with the popular girl over insecurities? But--alternative rock. I had to. Singles is a very fine film, but if not for the grunge-heavy soundtrack, 13-year-old Mary Alice may not have given it a second thought.\n\nAnd sometimes insanely good songs that were for whatever reason not included on albums land here. Singles has so many of these, it’s kind of baffling. “Breath” is one of the best songs by Pearl Jam, so true with “Drown” by Smashing Pumpkins, both of which appear on Singles. “JAR” by Green Day appears on the Angus soundtrack and it’s so, so good. On Grosse Pointe Blank, that Specials cover of “Pressure Drop” is outstanding. I enjoy that acoustic version of “Fake Plastic Trees” on the Clueless soundtrack possibly more than the album version. It could have made this list. I don’t think I ever would have given Luscious Jackson a second look if not for “Naked Eye,” also on Clueless.\n\nThis was never more true than it is with “Soul to Squeeze” by Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was recorded during the Blood Sugar Sex Magik sessions, but was cut and thrown on to the Coneheads soundtrack.* I think and hope this has nothing to do with the quality of the song, but can fully see why it was cut. It doesn’t fit at all with the rest of the album. It felt really distinct at the time and listening to it now, it’s hard to imagine it fitting into the album in any remotely cohesive way. Most of BSSM is funky and uptempo. With the exception of “Under the Bridge,” which I can only describe as *grand*, the down-tempo songs like “My Lovely Man” and “I Could Have Lied” are stripped-down and atmospherically glum. “Soul to Squeeze” is rich and contemplative. The bass leads in the verses and John Frusciante’s guitar stands back but is as-ever talking to you in a related sidebar in the background.\n\n*According to Wikipedia, etc., “Soul to Squeeze” was included on the “Under the Bridge” single as a B-side. I don’t know what edition they’re talking about. I had the “Under the Bridge” cassingle and the B-side was “The Righteous and the Wicked,” a fine song, but just another one on BSSM, not some fun rarity. God Bless Coneheads.**\n\n**I also would like to point out that the rest of the Coneheads soundtrack overall is not terribly strong. An inferior and unnecessary cover of “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You” as well as the aforementioned Barenaked Ladies’ “Fight the Power,” a certified abomination, appear alongside “Kodachrome” by Simon and Garfunkel. It’s filled out by a small handful of excellent, then-contemporary artists like REM and Digable Planets with no-account singles. And then there’s “Soul.” It’s such a weird assortment and pales significantly compared to So I Married an Axe Murderer’s soundtrack, which is thematically pretty similar, but much, much better. I associate the two because they were released the same summer and both had obvious SNL ties. ANYWAY -\n\nOh man, do I love “Soul to Squeeze.” I feel like I very much *get* the mood of it, even though the lyrics are typical Kiedis gobbledegook non-poetry. I honestly have no idea what it’s about. For me as a teenager, it was the perfect (late) song-of-summer in 1993. I was 14 and taking buses all over town, getting drunk for the first time, hanging with friends and boys, about to start high school. It was great times. For me, “Soul to Squeeze” told my story about being bored and active at the same time. Very leisurely being extremely busy. Kiedis was probably singing about heroin, but I associate it with missing the bus that took me and Cybil far enough to get home and waiting 45 for a bus transfer. The connecting stop was at the infamous Kahaluu Texaco station. So when Kedis sang “I might end up somewhere in Mexico,” we’d sing “We might end up somewhere near Texaco.”\n\nMy parents graduated college in 1969, got immediately married, and went into the Peace Corps. Once their tour was over, they moved to Hawaii to attend graduate school. My dad did some of his PhD field work in New Guinea, so in the mid-70s my parents dropped out of society a second time. Upon returning to the US, my mom started graduate school and concluded the 70s by becoming pregnant with her first child, me. All this is to say that these early influencers of my musical taste spent their 20s during the 70s dropping in and out of pop culture, picking up the least-challenging trends of the day, which mostly includes singer-songwriter stuff in the years where their lifelong musical tastes gelled.\n\nPete recently asked me what the most “rockin’” music my parents listened to was and the best I could come up with is Billy Joel. He questioned this, all “they didn’t like the Beatles or anything?” I explained to him that they did, but that was kid stuff. Like, I might occasionally put Dookie on, but my adult tastes aren’t exactly the same as they were when I was in high school. Similarly, my parents’ repertoire as 30- and 40-somethings looked more like those patchy years in the 70s when they were picking up stuff here and there but not following music very closely. It follows, then*, that as a young child, my primary exposure to pop music included Cat Stephens, Carly Simon, James Taylor, Paul Simon, Rod Stewart (oddly), and the Carpenters.\n\n*So yeah, it makes sense to me why they hit the Wimp Rock so hard, but they couldn’t get interested in David Bowie or Cheap Trick? Frustrating.\n\nThis early exposure to the Carpenters in particular was aided by the Sesame Street connection. I found out today that “Sing” was originally written for Sesame Street! The Carpenters performed and released it after the fact as a fairly successful pop single. I recall very clearly knowing every word to “Sing” through repetition and my mom knew it from the radio and we would sing it together, particularly the “la, la-la, la, la” parts.\n\nIn the 90s the Carpenters became briefly trendy I think due mostly to the release of If I Were a Carpenter, the tribute album featuring Shonen Knife, Sonic Youth, the Cranberries, Cracker, Dishwalla, and Matthew Sweet and wow, it’s better than I remember! That Shonen Knife version of “Top of the World” holds a permanent spot in my brain because of the awkward cadence, but the enduring hit from this collection was “Superstar” as performed by Sonic Youth and rightfully so because it’s incredible. The video is really amazing too. Kim is wearing this floor-length red dress and Thurston’s in a tuxedo and it’s a pretty Sonic Youthy backhanded tribute and I love it. I’ve mentioned before that you shouldn’t read Kim Gordon’s memoir. One reason for that is her inability to describe why she’s so fascinated by Karen Carpenter, which basically comes down to “it sucks that she experienced so much abuse from her family and society,” which I don’t even think is what she means. I get it, it’s a hard thing to explain, but I’m also not including a chapter in my memoir about it.\n\nIt was also during this period that I picked up a copy of the Carpenters’ greatest hits collection from Columbia House. As a teenager, I was struck by how easy it is to love every one of their songs. They somehow avoid being boring while at the same time being aggressively mellow. It’s not just Karen’s voice. The songwriting is great but credits are all over the place. They performed a ton of covers and worked a lot with professional songwriters. Most frequently, Burt Bacharach and Hal David (previously gushed about in the “I Say a Little Prayer” post), but so did a lot of recording artists. Richard Carpenter’s songwriting is ok, but I think the magic of the Carpenters comes from his arrangements. They’re kind of old-fashioned even for the 70s. The backup vocals feel pre-rock n’ roll and the instrumentation feels orchestral, but with only ⅓ of the effort. It’s very unique and very satisfying.\n\n“Rainy Days and Mondays” isn’t a super standout track, but it is my current favorite. Ask me again in a couple of months and I might give you another answer. This one happened to be written by my good friend PAUL WILLIAMS who is responsible for some of my favorite songs of all time, Cornball Category (see: “Rainbow Connection” and “Just an Old Fashioned Love Song”) but more importantly starred as Swan in one of the weirdest, most compelling movies I’ve only managed to see once, The Phantom of the Paradise. Gotta fix that.\n\nThematically, the song can only be described as melancholy. The mood is accomplished lyrically in a somehow novel but relatable way. A few snippets: “talking to myself and feeling old,” “walkin’ around, some kind of lonely clown,” “no need to talk it out, we know what it’s all about.” Musically, it’s enhanced by the notably atypical presence of a harmonica in Carpenters songs. It makes sense that the harmonica would show up in the Carpenters’ moodiest song. The backup vocals are old-fashioned and recording-studioey as always. Karen’s drums are soft and played with intention and great care. It all just comes together in a very precise equation of sweetness and a big fat bummer.\n\nPete does not share my love of this kind of music, but he is kind of fascinated by my insistence upon it. He was also good enough to buy me another copy of the Carpenters’ hit collection, years after I’d lost track of my old Columbia House copy (again, I likely unloaded it in a used record store when I needed cash in college or something). He’ll even cue it up for me if I’m clearly in need of cheering up.\n\nI’ve written before about the early 2000s’ post-punk revival before in my posts about “Float On” by Modest Mouse and “Hard to Explain” by the Strokes. For me, the era was ushered in by the Strokes,* whose “Last Night” was the first of the The Bands (™ Lilly) I heard, but the White Stripes’ “Fell in Love with a Girl” could not have been very far behind it. Among the The Bands, the White Stripes were by far my favorite. I almost instantly became a very, very rabid fan.\n\n*In researching for this post, I have learned that the White Stripes’ breakthrough album White Blood Cells was released on July 3, 2001 and The Strokes’ Is This It was released on July 30, 2001. Yes, that’s just as it should be.\n\nThe White Stripes got a lot of attention initially for “Fell in Love with a Girl,” to the extent that I was shocked to see that “Hotel Yorba” was actually released as a single before it. The music video for “Fell” is probably largely responsible for this. The song itself feels to me like the very definition of a “fun little ditty.” It’s much more straight garage-rock than most of the rest of White Blood Cells which is a lot bluesier. The guitar is obtuse and the lyrics are repetitive, but it’s a very strong single. The video is inspired, though. It’s a legit stop-motion work (near and dear to my heart) with legos, to even include little approximate Jack and Meg figures. Amazing and very, very cute.\n\nWith few exceptions, White Blood Cells is packed with total bangers, but “Hotel Yorba” is an easy favorite of mine. It’s a swingy, sweet, and simple love song. I associate it strongly with the summer of 2002. Pete and I moved in together the previous summer. We’d relocated together from Hawaii to Columbus and our apartment was my first time living away from my parents. By the following summer, we were humming. Pete was about to go back to school, I was getting used to being a grad student, we loved our little home together. We talked abstractly about getting married (and did the following summer), which appealed because it seemed rebellious, leaning in to that level of commitment even though we didn’t have to. We took our first vacation together (a road trip to DC!) and I remember very clearly scaling those ridiculous mountains along Interstate 68 in West Virginia, following along with my Yahoo! Maps printout, the two of us singing “Hotel Yorba” at the top of our lungs in my little Corolla. Oh those sweet, sepia-toned days. “Hotel” was the perfect soundtrack to it.\n\nThe weirdest thing about the White Stripes is that they presented themselves with every gimmick they could think of, but probably didn’t actually have to. At their peak, they were amazing talents, mesmerizing performers who wrote heady, infectious songs--they were just--really incredible artists. Initially, they’d only wear red and white inspired by those gross peppermint candies that Meg supposedly loved best.* They never took interviews separately and despite being married, lied and told everyone that they were brother and sister. Jack would talk in the hipster dude equivalent of baby talk, like a 10 year old character from some 19th century novel. Meg rarely spoke. I mean. This was firmly effective in developing a shitton of mystique and I think what elevated my interest from typical to obsessive. I feel like when they abandoned the aesthetic, I got a little bored with them.\n\n*I suspect this is another gimmick because nobody loves those peppermint candies. We all just put up with them.\n\nWhy was Jack so handsome until he wasn’t? I watched the “Hotel Yorba” video this morning (which is almost as charming as the song itself). Holy balls, what a piece of ass. It was around this period that Pete (of his own accord) started dying his hair black and the longer style he wore it in definitely seemed inspired by Jack White’s, but really wasn’t and it gave me a small thrill every time someone would comment, unprovoked that he looked like Jack White. By the time they released Elephant (also an excellent album), he was all emaciated and dating models and the thrill was gone.\n\nI think I only saw them play once, at the then-Promowest Pavilion. I remember it really well. It was the same day I’d passed my thesis defense at some point in November, 2003. We lived out in the suburbs at the time, so we didn’t go home between school and the concert. We got dinner at the Mongolian BBQ place and for some reason I changed out of my conservative brown turtleneck in the car into more appropriate concert attire. It was *so cold* that day and walking across the parking lot without my coat was hellish. The show itself was long and it was so packed inside. I think I was stuck standing next to a pole the whole time, but I didn’t care. They were my very favorite band at the time.\n\nI can’t remember the last time I put the White Stripes on before listening this morning. I’d estimate it’s been more than five years. As I mentioned, by the time Get Behind Me Satan came around, I was done. Jack seemed too far up his own ass by that time and the writing seemed more like imitations of their influences instead of a contemporary take on rock n’ blues. Jack also seemed to be dressing up like an old-timey villain. That shouldn’t be as important to me as it is. If they were still playing good music, I wouldn’t have cared. It’s like the inverse of their not needing to pile gimmick upon gimmick to get initial attention. But after whetting my appetite on a couple of tracks to refresh my memory, I’m super excited to listen to White Blood Cells in its entirety after Golden Girls is over.\n\nSometimes I really wonder about my methodology in ranking these songs. By the time I got to putting them in order, my goal was to just get it done. I think it would be a lie to say that I like “Doowutchyalike” better than “Hotel Yorba.” I guess this makes me a liar. I guess maybe I weighted the former a little more because it’s really the only song I really get off on by Digital Underground, whereas there are other songs by the White Stripes I like better?\n\nAll of this is to say that I’ve never seen Digital Underground perform, I don’t have any weighty personal stories about Digital Underground. I don’t think I even own a copy of Sex Packets (I should). This is a fine pick, but I don’t have a lot to say and I cannot defend it in any meaningful way. It’s just a great song. So, here goes.\n\nI knew of Digital Underground first from “The Humpty Dance,” a single released several months after “Doowutchyalike” It is a novelty song about founding member Shock G’s alter ego, Humpty Hump. I think given the time and context, I could very well have come up with the idea for Humpty Hump. Shock G was inspired to invent the character when they went to a party supply store *the day of the “Doowutchyalike” video shoot* and found the Groucho glasses with plastic nose, inventing Humpty on the spot. This is the exact method I use for coming up with stuff. It’s a math equation:\n\n(Structure/Functional Necessity) + Situational Inspiration = New Idea\n\nIn this case\n\n(Same-Day Video Shoot/Prop shopping) + funny glasses = an enduring feature of hip hop history\n\nSo too in my case:\n\n(Album release/COVID-19) + that paper skeleton on our living room wall = stop-motion animation project featuring handmade paper dolls\n\nSee? I get this. The other thing that’s very Mary Alice about Humpty Hump as an idea is that Shock G came up with a whole invented biography for Humpty. A fucking plus. He’s not just a funny man with novelty nose and glasses, there’s a *reason* for the nose. The story was that his nose was burned off in a grease fire, which also somehow is the reason he became a rapper. I like that Shock G also alters his voice so that it’s more nasal when he’s rapping as Humpty. Because he doesn’t have a nose. Obviously. If memory serves, we had no reason to believe that this wasn’t mostly true. That Humpty was at minimum a separate person from Shock G, even if that implausible grease fire story wasn’t true. I think some people may have suggested we tried to pull a Humpty situation with Super Steve, but that’s ridiculous. Pete and Super Steve have appeared in the same room together. We have dozens of witnesses.\n\nHere’s another completely insane thing about Digital Underground: they appeared in one of history’s absolutely worst major motion pictures. When we were in college and completely broke, Pete and I used to treat ourselves to bargain basement pay-per-view movies, which were at the time a fairly novel thing. Previously, only films that were no longer in theaters but yet to be released on VHS, but Oceanic Cable seemed to be trying something new, by putting older movies of varying quality on pay per view and charging like $3 instead of $10. We would only occasionally *treat* ourselves to a $3 pay per view movie and it would usually work out fairly well. We first saw now-beloved holiday favorite Funny Farm starring Chevy Chase this way. Never having previously heard of it, we took a chance and were richly rewarded. We took *another* chance shortly thereafter on something called Nothing But Trouble, starring yes, Chevy Chase but also Dan Aykroyd, fucking John Candy, and Demi Moore. We didn’t think we could lose with that case. We lost. We lost by a lot. I guess we should have known given the strength of the cast AND the fact that we’d never heard of it. The Digital Underground cameo is so weird, so unnecessary, and totally unrelated to the plot. Also, they were never really famous enough to make this kind of cameo? The film was released in 1991, so I’m thinking maybe a Hammer would qualify, but while Digital Underground was much beloved by America’s youth, they weren’t cultural-icon level. Nothing but Trouble wasn’t a kids’ movie and--I don’t know--the whole thing is a mysterious mess. At least *everyone* lost in this scenario. Digital Underground weren’t the only hapless victims.\n\n“Doowutchyalike” was released initially as a single, well in advance of DU’s debut album Sex Packets*. I don’t know when I heard “Doowutchyalike” the first time, but I know it was after “The Humpty Dance” and possibly even after “No Nose Job” and “Kiss You Back,” fairly successful singles released on their 1991 album, Sons of the P. In the YouTube era, however, “Doowutchyalike” has become my favorite by Digital Underground. I can’t separate it from the music video, which is just pure, distilled fun. It’s your standard party-rap video format, but 90% of notable hip-hop artists of the time make cameos in it. Combine that template with the theme of the song, which is essentially that you should do what you like, and it’s celebration of confident, unified individuality. I feel like I can again relate to this low-judgement approach to relationships, particularly in the context of relationships with other musicians. It is the way to be. I love it. It’s a gift to humanity. And with that, I have nothing more to say about this song.\n\n*I have always been completely tickled by the name of this album, not knowing what a sex packet actually is. In pre-post reading, I’ve found out that it is a concept album about--well, I’ll let Wikipedia take the wheel here: “‘G.S.R.A.’ (Genetic Suppression Relief Antidotes), a pharmaceutical substance that is produced in the form of a large glowing pill about the size of a quarter, which comes in a condom-sized package and is allegedly developed by the government to provide its intended users such as astronauts with a satisfying sexual experience in situations where the normal attainment of such experiences would be counter-productive to the mission at hand.” Holy shit, man.\n\nI want to begin this post by welcoming my friend Matt to the fold, since he’s started posting his top 100 favorite songs every day, along with these write-ups. He’ll learn that 90% of people just skim it, but that’s ok, these brain- and heart-dumps are mostly for me. Now our team is strong with myself, Matt, and Kelly, who is just a couple of weeks behind me.\n\nI wanted to bring this up because this song naturally prompts a compare-and-contrast with Kelly’s list and mine. It’s an interesting comparison because before we launched this endeavor, I think we both thought that our tastes in music were pretty similar. I think she’s realizing that her taste in music is even quirkier* than she thought as her choices are often deep cuts on albums. That wasn’t really true with her Go-Go’s pick, “This Town,” which wasn’t a single, but definitely an album standout on their first and most successful record, Beauty and the Beat. She said in her write-up that she could have gone with an “Our Lips Are Sealed”-type pick. I am learning that I REALLY DIG THE BANGERS and once again am going on brand and picking the obvious Go-Go’s. OK, but this song is incredible.\n\n*Quirky to the extent that whenever an excessively weird 80s/new wave song comes on a Spotify playlist, Pete will say “this is Kelly Stitzel music.”\n\nI was kind of too young for the Go-Go’s in their time. They broke up when I was 6 years old and by the time I had the juice to transcend passive music discovery, I was into punk, which typically strictly forbids intermingling in your record collection with pop music. Such was actually not the case with the Go-Go’s and others such as Blondie, bands that history recognizes for their pop output but for whom the lines were super blurry early on. It’s no longer a well-kept secret that the Go-Go’s were originally a legitimate LA punk band and that Belinda actually played with the Germs, a band with more of a reputation for being punk than being good. The inverse of the Go-Go’s for a long time.\n\nBeauty and the Beat is an excellent record, beginning to end. Kelly is not wrong about “This Town,” but my “This Town” pick would be “Can’t Stop the World,” which bookends the album as the last track, opposite “Our Lips Are Sealed.” A jarringly upbeat breakup song, it’s sunny and exuberant in signature Go-Go’s style. It also includes probably their best-known-song “We Got the Beat,” which feels like “Can’t Stop the World’s” more successful cousin.\n\n“Our Lips Are Sealed” is just a classic, enduring track. In the recent Go-Go’s documentary, they talked about how songwriter Jane Wiedlin is not a trained musician, so the song structure is unusual in an infectious way. I’m much less of a trained musician, so even having heard this and listening to the song a couple of times now, I’m not sure what they were talking about. I think what’s appealing about the song is the change from the verses to the hook? It’s an abrupt but harmonious change. The melody in the chorus is simple and repetitive but builds to this really really logical but sharp right turn. I think the first thing that comes to mind regarding this song is Jane’s ethereal vocals in the bridge that contrasts sharply with Belinda’s bubbly, playful lead vocals.\n\nTHEN, consider that Jane wrote it about a scandalous affair she had with Terry Hall of the Specials during their joint European tour and oh, it’s so good! According to the documentary, all the Go-Go’s took their turns with different members of the Specials and Madness, which makes me want to giggle aloud with delight as I’m typing this. As we were watching, when they mentioned that Jane snagged Terry, I said aloud to Pete, “Yeah. She definitely got the prized pig, there.” And deservedly so, Jane is obviously the best Go-Go. Then immortalized it all in the perfect Go-Go’s song on a record full of perfect Go-Go’s songs. Damn, do I love this band.\n\nI also can’t say enough about the music video for “Our Lips.” It is, once again, perfect. I learned again, from the documentary, that the only reason IRS had any money to get them to shoot it was because labelmates The Police had some money left over from a video they’d shot just ahead of the Go-Go's. So they rented a convertible and just winged it, which is amazing. The best part is near the end when they all pile into a public fountain, splashing and frolicking, completely devoid of self-consciousness. In the documentary they said that they were trying to get arrested in such a manner where you think they were a little offended they didn’t get arrested. When I was a kid, I always wanted to live in LA because it was a big deal, kinda dangerous, and so glamorous (to paraphrase “This Town”). This video captures that spirit I aspired to as a little kid.\n\nAs I mentioned, the Go-Go’s broke up in 1985 and I’ve been thinking a lot about why recently. Like any dissolution of its kind, it was a lot more complicated than this, but a lot of it had to do with money. They didn’t share songwriting credits, so a couple of members were paid significantly more than the others. While we were watching the documentary and they were talking about the disparity I was initially like--yeah. There’s no band without songs. Songs are different than performances, they’re basically eternal. But at the same time, what are those songs without Belinda? Not just her voice, which is a fine voice, but there is no Go-Go’s without Belinda’s charisma and dynamism. “We Got the Beat” is not the same enduring pop anthem without Belinda’s performance. This was an issue with the Talking Heads as well, though it’s even muckier because there are questions about whether the credits were fairly made given the band’s songwriting process. This is sad and frustrating and reinforces my theory that art should never be commodified. It fucks everything up. It can’t possibly remain pure. This is easy as hell for me to say because I don’t write and we “share” our “profits” (lolololol) totally equally, so disregard if this is just naive and not naive and correct.\n\nI have posted many, many times about how 3rd Wave Ska is a much maligned subgenre that I only sort of hate. I’m an apologist in that I think some pretty good stuff is lumped in with a lot of very terrible stuff. The shining beacon on the hill of a 3rd Wave band nobody has anything bad to say about is Operation Ivy (if we are discounting Fishbone, which I think also qualifies as universally respected, if not beloved).\n\nOperation Ivy were the first kings of the late-80s/early-90s Bay-Area Gilman St. scene, the same one which bore Green Day, Mr. T Experience, and I guess ultimately Rancid.* Whenever we’re listening to Operation Ivy, particularly if we’ve had anything to drink, Pete will very earnestly ask me “could you even *imagine* this being a local band?” Putting it into a (somewhat) contemporary context, it’s hard to imagine being all grouchy and tired on a Wednesday and having plans to check out Operation Ivy at Slash Run *again* and trying to justify just going home, get pho delivered, and watch Unsolved Mysteries, and yeah, that’s weird.\n\n*Wikipedia reminds (?) me that the Offspring was also part of the Gilman St. scene which if true, I either never knew (which seems really unlikely) or exists in a part of my brain waaaaaaaaay at the back of the ole filing system and likely have never would have thought about ever again if not for looking it up on Wikipedia. I’ve worked a little hard trying to figure out where Wikipedia got this to verify it and/or how this feels so foreign to me despite knowing a fair amount about the Gilman St./Lookout scene, to no avail. This just doesn’t feel right to me and may have already ruined my day.\n\nWhat Pete is getting at is that they were so impossibly good from the start. They formed in May of 1987, broke up in May of NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE and yet somehow found their way into legendary-punk status. The self-titled collection, released post-mortem in 1991, includes their only full-length (1989) followed by a 1988 EP. And that was it! Finito! Off the top of my head, the only other band to do so little to so much notoriety is the Sex Pistols and they toured internationally, made headlines, WAS ON A MAJOR LABEL, despite being not nearly as good as Op Ivy.\n\nFor a hot minute in ‘95-96, I think I would have called Operation Ivy my favorite band (before Sublime usurped them, haha). I believe we became aware of them because of the Rancid Connection (regrettable, and something I’ll get into later) which coupled with the popularity of 3rd Wave ska at the time, gave Operation Ivy some Radio Free airplay. We weren’t that special, a lot of people knew of Operation Ivy pre-internet in part I think because of Green Day’s cover of “Knowledge,” which showed up on an early EP release. But in Hawaii, you didn’t have to be a punk rock scholar to be aware of Operation Ivy, even this lame girl I knew in college knew them (I remember this because she’s said to me that she liked that track “Nice Song.” She meant “Bankshot”). They were just on regular radio.\n\nAll of the songs Operation Ivy recorded are the best ska/punk songs you’ve ever heard. They just are. I was curious so I Googled “what’s the best Operation Ivy song” and to my surprise “Here We Go Again” is apparently unremarkable.* I wonder whether this has anything to do with it appearing fairly late into a lengthy LP. Or maybe I’m not as much of a banger-lover as I thought I was (see also “The Card Cheat”). To me, “Here We Go Again” sounds grand. It almost literally starts with a drum roll and vocalist Jesse Michaels’ proclaim “it’s not the ending it’s the beginning…” (more on this later). The first verse launches like a typical ska-core song before they pump the breaks, slow it down to half-time and go into an almost-rap-style flow, which I suppose is something of a chorus. As I type this, I realize this sounds terrible, but it’s a lot less worse than I describe. It concludes with backup vocals repeating “here we go again” over the half-time chorus-of-sorts. It’s grand!\n\n*If you’re interested, Google approximates the following as the five Op Ivy songs with the most mentions online: “Sound System,” “Take Warning,” “Bad Town,” “Unity,” and “Freeze Up.” Again, I can’t really argue because they’re ALL SO GOOD.\n\nHow this came to be my favorite Operation Ivy song is a somewhat amusing story. One of the traditions at my high school everyone looked forward to most was selecting our senior quote to appear under our pictures in the yearbook. It was the 90s equivalent of what we used to say in the late 2000s when a friend said something stupid or profound or stupidly profound: “That’s my new MySpace quote,” but instead of course it’s “my senior quote.” When yearbooks came out junior year, this dude a year ahead of me quoted the opening of this song:\n\nIt’s not the ending, it’s the beginning\n\nThe ground is moist and it rained last night\n\nSmells like smoke and it smells so clean\n\nThe sun is shining down like a friendly white light\n\nHere we go again\n\nI was angry because if I’d thought of it, it would have been my senior quote for sure. Though I was pretty sure I never would have thought of it, WE WOULD NOW NEVER KNOW, WOULD WE? I was especially mad because I didn’t like the guy. Despite technically being *one of us*, he was a pretty big asshole and would eventually go on to steal my weed by dumping the bag in his messy car, where none of us could find it in the moment, his intention, I’m sure. My senior quote ended up being:\n\nI’m torn between the light and dark\n\nWhere others see their targets\n\nI can’t see anything\n\nWhich I attributed to Dinosaur Jr., which I later found out was sort of incorrect. I selected the line because it was from mine and Pete’s song “Quicksand” which is an approximate cover of none other than eventual very-favorite, David Bowie. J Mascis changed many of the lyrics to apply to his space in life as opposed to Bowie’s, which was aggressively British, including the line in my quote, “I can’t see anything” from Bowie’s “divine symmetry.” So I was technically correct, but I’m triply mad because I came really close to quoting classic Bowie in my 1997 senior quote which would have made me extremely advanced among my peers. What a mess.\n\nANYWAY.\n\nOperation Ivy has never and will never reform. They don’t hate each other or anything, I just think the brains behind the operation (ivy) is really uninterested. Jesse Michaels went on to do very little of particular note for a long time before founding Common Rider, an incredible band in and of itself. Last Wave Rockers is their first and best album, but almost too heart-stringy for me to listen to these days. He used to have a lovely and very relatable Facebook presence before fleeing for not being able to handle the bullshit. Understandable for sure, but I miss him a lot. Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of course went on to do Rancid, a band I once liked fairly well. They’ve devolved into self-parody in the last 20 years. It’s so painful to watch, it’s affected my ability to enjoy their earlier, more tolerable output. You could say I hate Rancid, particularly compared with Op Ivy, but I will occasionally get a perverse and mostly pleasantly nostalgic thrill out of listening to much of And Out Come the Wolves and watching their earlier video releases.\n\nThe best Le Tigre--nay--the best *Kathleen Hanna* song is “Deceptacon,” everybody knows this, nobody argues, it’s a really really incredible song. It’s really great that she was able to crank out such a hit after Bikini Kill and basically give herself a second career. Which is not to say that Le Tigre in general wasn’t a revolution, but it was certainly fueled by the power of “Deceptacon.” A diss track, it not only slaps, but also effectively draws a line in the sand between Le Tigre’s post-punk (lowercase PP) and the male-dominated (and at times arguably quite misogynistic, if intended in a “playful” manner) pop punk that enjoyed unlikely mainstream saturation in the latter half of the 90s. And it was just in time.\n\nIn my post about Radiohead’s “Idioteque,” I mentioned that at the turn of the millennium, burnt out on rock music, there were a handful musicians that pivoted towards pop/dance music from what Pete and I considered to be credible from a punk/indie perspective. This helped us understand that electronic music wasn’t all drugs and glow sticks and that pop didn’t have to be vapid. Along with Radiohead, I credit Bob Mould and Le Tigre for letting us dance again. I dare say they also made the version of Electric Grandmother you know today possible.\n\nWhen Le Tigre came along, I was familiar with Bikini Kill’s work from scant radio play, the KRS compilation (a bit of a watershed, mentioned in my Bratmobile post), and the Singles collection, but I wouldn’t have described myself as a *big* fan necessarily. Oddly, Le Tigre ended up being a gateway to Bikini Kill for me. I can’t for the life of me remember when I might have first heard them. I’m fairly certain it was in college. They played Hawaii* and we couldn’t afford to go, but I also remember being not-all-that-disappointed that we couldn’t make it either.\n\n*Friends of mine went and I remember this because my pal Mindy reported to me that she saw Kathleen Hanna and now-husband Ad Rock seemed AWFULLY FAMILIAR hanging out near the stage before they went on, but this is long before anyone knew they were a thing. I think this explains why Le Tigre made it to Hawaii because the Beastie Boys were playing a show in town in the same week, a detail which at the time seemed QUITE benign. Also I’m sorry to have mentioned this union on a post about Kathleen’s band and not on the Beastie Boys’ post which would seem to in part define a feminist icon’s worth by her marriage, but not her husband’s. The story IS related to Le Tigre and not the Beastie Boys, though. It’s the best I can do.\n\nI really got hooked on Le Tigre in grad school when they released Feminist Sweepstakes, which is NOT their best album (though not a bad album, having refreshed my memory), but since it had just been released, I got obsessed with it. And then retroactively became obsessed with the superior self-titled debut, which includes both “Decepticon” and the subject of this long, winding story, “The The Empty.”\n\nOH! I would be remiss to not mention my mom’s role in fostering my relationship with Le Tigre. One day at some point in late 2001 (I remember because I think I was newly living in Columbus), out of the blue, she asked me if I liked Le Tigre. I felt a little like Steve Martin in Parenthood when the stripper who was mistakenly sent to his son’s birthday party in place of the popular cowboy character in that I had a lot of questions that didn’t even seem relevant. I told her I did fairly well. She said she heard Kathleen Hanna on Fresh Air and struck her as something I’d enjoy. “She sounded like a valley girl, but one with ideas.” I guess that’s fair. I was tickled enough by this interaction that I leaned in a little.\n\nI didn’t want to talk about everyone’s favorite song by Le Tigre, so I instead made a personal pick. “The The Empty” is a very atypical Le Tigre song because the guitar is so front-facing. The guitar is also pretty typical three-chord (if that?), unusual for any song with a drum-machine track. The drum track, which is so fast, full, and chaotic, it’s almost irritating. What were they thinking? I think my favorite genre of music is bad-ideas-gone-good. When stuff looks bad on paper but you can pull it off anyway? That’s success.\n\nKathleen’s vocals aren’t typical for Le Tigre either. They’re usually bouncy and playful, even in angry songs like “Decepticon.” In “The The Empty,” they’re screamier, evocative of her Bikini-Kill style, but more screamy than yelly and far more kinetic. And oh! So angry! I feel like in most screamy songs, the vocalist rarely shows weakness or fatigue and the same I think the same could be said for Kathleen’s Bikini Kill songs, but by the end of the song she sounds at once exhausted but unready to stop?\n\nFor all the anger, she’s not even singing about something all that objectively bad. It’s a function of a simpler time, but also that Le Tigre was uniquely art-focused. She got all New York on us. They maintained the feminist-punk spirit from Bikini Kill that made Kathleen Hanna a household name, but in “The The Empty,” and other songs by Le Tigre through Feminist Sweepstakes, that spirit was less lyrically aggressive and more culture-focused and observational. In preparing for this post, I read an interview with Kathleen from 2000 in which she goes on at length about feeling out of step with culture after watching There’s Something About Mary. She admits to watching Adam Sandler movies (lol) to demonstrate that she’s can be quite low-brow and found some funny moments in Mary. But she couldn’t quite get past the concept that Mary effectively had three men stalking her, which rendered the whole thing unfunny and offensive. She had similar complaints about American Beauty (also lol) and Election, though I disagree with her on that. I think in 2000, she would have been chided for being too uptight, but I think mainstream cultural thought has finally caught up to Kathleen Hanna.\n\n“The The Empty” is about exactly this. The refrain throughout the song has Johanna Fateman backing Kathleen’s screams with a pleasant, calm and melodic but assertive “all that glitt\n\nrs is not gold,” which pretty much sums it up. I think the series of lines that drives the unique point of view home here is:\n\n(Oh! Baby!) Why won't you talk to me?\n\n(Oh! Baby!) You don't say anything!\n\n(Oh! Baby!) Why won't you talk to me?\n\n(Oh, baby?) You don't say anything!\n\nWhat I like about it is that she’s asking for more out of culture. “Why don’t you talk to *me*?” She doesn’t limit the scope here to other musicians. She even calls comedians out, which I find a little funny, but again, with recent progression in standup norms, demonstrated by such output by Hannah Gatsby demonstrates that we are catching up with Kathleen Hanna.\n\nFollowing Feminist Sweepstakes, Le Tigre attempted to sell out in 2004 with their major label release This Island, which is a steaming pile of shit. It was overproduced and under-performed. So it sounded really slick but amateurish at the same time. I hated it. I guess other people did too, because they failed to gain a foothold in the mainstream. I recall hearing the lead single “TKO” on CD 101 in Columbus and having to turn it off because I hated it so much. Then they went on indefinite hiatus, popping up here and there to do things like record that tragic shoot-the-moon track “I’m With Her” in 2016, along with various production projects here and there. It’s--definitely over.\n\nI’m happy for Kathleen that Bikini Kill is back together. Pete seems to think it’s where she belongs. The couple of times we saw Le Tigre were in mid-sized clubs and they had to move their own shit. They were always fun shows, but I think it’s only natural that when you reach cultural-icon status, it kind of hurts a little to carry your own amps (see also Joe Strummer passing out handbills to an Atlantic City Mescaleros show). When we saw Bikini Kill last year for their triumphant reunion, they were playing at Terminal 5 in NYC and were treated like legends they are. I guess she’s where she needs to be now.\n\nSo, yes, I took a few days off. I think my last Favorite Song post was on Thursday. I’ve been feeling like I’m doing a ton of stuff lately, none of it well. So I took this weekend to relax a tiny bit and hammer out some progress of major projects, which I did and I'm very glad for it. I’m so terrified of having not used my Pandemic Time wisely, I’m making myself a little nuts. I used Labor Day weekend to kind of stand back a little.\n\nSo that partly explains my absence and that’s mostly the reason, but I’ve also felt demotivated to work on this since starting the process the night before the projected post-date, as I do. I began the work on it, reading up on the song and artist to refresh my memory, find inspiration, and learn new stuff, as I do. One of the first things I read was that “What Difference Does It Make” is well-known to be Morrissey’s least-favorite Smiths song, because OF COURSE IT IS. I was lowkey not looking forward to having to write about this creep anyway and reading this kind of put me over the edge.\n\nThere are two camps: people who hate Morrissey and everything he ever did, and people who hate him but love everything he ever did. I fall into a non-fanatical subcategory of the latter, which I think is rare. I think the Smiths have many really incredible songs, but they aren’t my favorite band. I wouldn’t even listen to them every day even though, again, I cannot deny their greatness. The Smiths are a definite Mood that I’m often-but-not-always feeling. It’s not even your stereotypical Post-Punk Sad Bastard mood, either. I’m not frequently subject to that one. I don’t know what it is.\n\nThough the Smiths were always sort of around, I didn’t go on a semi-permanent Kick until 2013 or so when they became a staple. This was influenced by if not directly caused by becoming close friends with those who fall into the fanatical category of those who hate Morrissey and love everything he ever did. Though not technically one of them, as a recovering Screeching Weasel fan, I understand this. For years I was able to look past Ben Weasel’s atrocities because his music meant so much. Then, after a point, his music no longer meant very much because his atrocities just kept getting worse and worse. For some reason, Morrissey’s fans generally seem to have not yet hit this point, despite Morrissey’s atrocities being equal to if not worse than Ben’s to date. I don’t judge the Morrissey fanatics for this, really. I think the cult is just that intense. Respect.\n\nAnother unexplainable issue with the Smiths and Morrissey is how popular they are (though perhaps waning) among the Mexican and Mexican-American communities, particularly in Los Angeles. When I first heard about it, I thought the person relaying the Fact of Mexicans and Morrissey was making it up. But in fact, this is a well-enough documented pop cultural quirk that it trickled down to an episode of Orange is the New Black when a Mexican-American inmate described love as “getting into a bath but the water is like, warm chocolate pudding. And the Smiths are playing ‘There’s a Light That Never Goes Out.’” That was my favorite moment of the show. The popularity among such an unlikely population is such an intense, interesting, weird quirk of pop culture, learning it directly caused a friend of mine to leave the sociology grad program we attended together because he felt as if he wasn’t going to be able to ask the important questions in that context. He eventually became a lawyer.\n\nConcerning the other camp, people who hate Morrissey and everything he ever did, this existed even before his aggressively careless rhetoric crossed over from annoying but ultimately harmless to white-nationalist and actually harmful. I think this might be at least in part due to his being an animal-rights vegan before veganism at all was super mainstream. The mere act of another self-identifying vegan or even vegetarian used to be a trigger for some people, but I think we’re fairly well past that, since the internet arguments got so tedious and repetitive nobody wanted to have that discussion again. But the hatred remains, I think.\n\nOne more fun aside: many, MANY years ago, the Philadelphia Eagles played the San Francisco 49ers and as we’ve done, my friend Adam Brodsky and I placed a wager on the game. If San Francisco won, Adam would have to produce a video of himself playing “William It Was Really Nothing” on acoustic guitar shirtless for me to share on social media. I don’t remember what my end of the bet was because it didn’t matter, the 49ers won soundly. He didn’t make good on this wager until literally years later, but when he did, it was so exhilarating, I didn’t care that it was delayed for years. He even sang it into a raw chicken leg, punctuating the performance by giving the raw chicken a kiss. I invite him to share the video in the comments, if he so pleases.\n\nSpeaking of Adam, he’s been known to say “chicks love the minor key.” I agree and think that’s part of why I love “What Difference” so much. I’m not a musician, but know enough to identify it here. I’ll take it a step further and say that the key sets the perfect tone for the rambling and self-effacing lyrics, spout by Morrissey in the perfect careless rant about a broken friendship or affair (I can’t actually tell). Towards the end he stands quite firm: “no more apologies, oh I’m too tired, I’m so sick and tired and I’m feeling really sick and ill today.” He has us right where he wants us before jerking us back with “but I’m still fond of you, whoa-oh-oh.” Contradiction isn’t unique in music but it is when presented in such a nonchalant tone. I’m also a big fan of both the content and delivery of “oh the devil will find work for idle hands to do.” I do actually find Morrissey-in-his-heyday pretty hot and I also know that this is weird and probably pretty gross to a lot of people and I do not blame those people. Still, the sex or non-sex implied in that line and its delivery is also quite hot.\n\nDo I like this video? Not sure. I generally don’t like clips from TV shows that are passed off as “videos” on YouTube even if that’s probably just a function of it being the best-available and closest-thing-to an actual video and is technically better than nothing. This is an above-average version of the TV-clip video, fairly common for bands from this era and just before. It’s above average in part for the aforementioned eye candy that is Morrissey appropriately dancing very loosely and casually with a blank expression on his beautiful bespectacled face. Bonus: he’s not singing into a microphone which is both funny and allows him to swing his arms around like an idiot, which in addition to his open shirt is an enhancement.\n\nSo there you have it. Now I never have to write about Morrissey or the Smiths again.\n\nTrue confession: I’ve loved this song for the majority of my life but did not know until today that it was originally recorded by someone else. I guess I always assumed Roberta Flack wasn’t actually credited for writing it because that was the case with many R&B/soul artists at the time, but I had no idea there was an earlier version. The original recording was released by singer/songwriter Lori Lieberman the previous year. Lieberman collaborated on it with Charles Fox and Norman Gimbel, all three of whom are best known for writing “Killing Me Softly,” among others barely worth mentioning. The full story involves a sordid May-December love affair, severing of ties, lawsuits and every crazy thing you can imagine.\n\nI should have known something was up long ago, when I found out that the object of the song--the person killing the singer softly with his song--is Don McLean. I don’t think anyone would fault me to point out that being touched by a Don McLean performance to the point where you write an enduring, classic tune about it is an obtusely white thing to do. I can honestly say that this has lowkey bothered me for YEARS. I just couldn’t picture Roberta Flack swooning over Don McLean that would inspire her to write the words “I felt all flushed with fever, embarrassed by the crowd. I felt he found my letters and read each one out loud.” It just wasn’t right.\n\nEvidently the Don McLean song that inspired “Killing Me Softly” is called “Empty Chairs,” not one (I though) I’d ever heard before. It sounds to me so tonally similar to “Vincent,” a song with which I have an intensely personal relationship*, I kept wanting him to transition to “now I understand what you tried to say to me, how you suffered for your sanity” and when he inevitably didn’t, I felt disappointed and vaguely nauseated. This song doesn’t stand out to me at all and borderline sucks.\n\n*I think I’ve mentioned before that absent from my childhood is the experience of going through my parents’ old record collections and discovering old stuff that they love or once loved listening to, gaining an early musical education from those dusty old records. My parents were nomads before I was born, persistently bouncing around the pacific until they stopped in the late 1970s. They didn’t keep any of their stuff from when they were kids or in their teens or even their 20s. The closest I could get were old cassettes they kept from their Peace Corps days, which were most often dubbed mix-tapes made by close friends and family. They lacked the cohesion and colorful artwork that my peers’ parents’ old LPs would have, so I never “got into” my parent’s “record collections.” One vintage prerecorded cassette that survived moves and purges was a copy of Don McLean’s American Pie album so old that it didn’t come in the flip-style cassette case I was used to. Rather, it was like a hard-plastic cassingle-style sleeve-case. It was weird. Anyway, I listened to that album, which I now see included “Empty Chairs,” but more importantly included “Vincent,” which I’d never heard before listening to the album. I believe I was not yet taking art history yet, but was cultivating an early interest in post-impressionist art (still probably my favorite pre-modern period). I heard “Vincent” for the first time, burst intensely into tears, and listened to it like five more times. Years later, I found out that NOFX covered “Vincent,” which is one of my favorite things Fat Mike has ever done. I could not include either version on my top 100 because it is too embarrassing to even consider where it might fit, though it probably deserves a spot.\n\nEvidently, Roberta Flack was sort of on the fence about recording “Killing Me Softly with His Song,” arguably one of two or three songs she’s now best known for. At the risk of summarizing the entire Wikipedia article in this post, I must also share the detail that Roberta Flack first heard the original version on an airplane as part of the in-flight audio program. You may or may not be old enough to remember these. I used to listen to them despite having at least a portable cassette player during every flight in which I needed to be occupied. It was fun for me, whose control-freak parents didn’t allow me to switch away from the adult-contemporary or NPR stations in the car and doing so on the airplane felt fun and random, yet predictable enough since the in-flight literature lists all songs they will play. I recall very early in high school hearing “Stand” by REM over and over on one such flight. So anyway, Roberta Flack was making preparations to record it but for some reason never did. Then, when opening for Marvin Gaye for lack of any other material for an encore, played “Killing Me Softly with His Song,” the crowd went wild, and Marvin Gaye advised her not to play the song again until she recorded it.\n\nYou might guess that I became enamored with “Killing Me Softly with His Song” following the Fugees’ 1996 cover version but that is not true! I remember my mom loving this song. All along I’ve assumed that the version of “Killing” I knew from my youth was the Roberta Flack version, but evidently there’s an Anne Murray version, which may very well be the one my mom listened to. That’s disappointing. I listened to it for the first time ever/in many enough years so that it didn’t sound familiar. It sucks. It’s over-arranged and the vocal performance pales (no pun intended) in comparison. That’s right, a Canadian adult contemporary artist can’t drum up as much soul as Roberta Flack. I’m taking a stand. I do like that cover by the Fugees, though and appreciated when it came along and enjoyed a second life. Another semi-contemporary moment-in-the-sun worth mentioning if not going into is a very sweet moment in the 2002 major motion picture About a Boy, which I love in spite of myself.\n\nI don’t feel like I need to talk about why I love this song so much. I kind of feel like it’s similar to “What’s Going On?” Like, what is there to say? Everyone loves this song. I will say that the power of this song for me isn’t a play between the music and lyrics. I’m normally big on lyrics and the songwriter’s headspace, how that plays with the arrangement and the melody, but “Killing Me Softly with His Song” is just ok from that perspective. It’s thematically the same song as “Superstar” by the Carpenters. What I love best about this song is the melody of the verses as it transitions into the chorus. This song is 90% chorus, but the verses are where the meat is for me. Take verse 3 (please):\n\nHe sang as if he knew me in all my dark despair\n\nAnd then he looked right through me as if I wasn't there\n\nBut he just came to singing, singing clear and strong\n\nYou can kind of see what I mean. “In all my dark despair” sounds like an angsty teenage girl wrote it (which is basically true). The first line ends mid-range. The second one is high and strong and the third, which feeds into the chorus is a nonsense line but is delivered so forcefully, the performance takes on a life of its own and in one single shot, demonstrates the general magic of music.\n\nCopper Blue is one of my all-time favorite albums and most certainly deserves to be represented here, but it was really hard to pick a song for a list like this. This isn’t a Whitney situation, where all of the major singles are tied for first. I always have a favorite song off of Copper Blue, but it rotates between the four best: “The Act We Act,” “A Good Idea,” “Helpless” and “The Slim”\n\nIn fact, in the two-whatever months I’d been doing this list, I switched favorites from “The Act We Act” to “A Good Idea.” That’s how volatile the situation is. The longest consecutive reign belongs to “The Slim” which is probably my actual favorite, but there was a situation which I’ll get into later, shortly after I found out that it’s a reflection of the pain of losing someone close to you from AIDS and the simultaneous fear and dread that came with being gay in the early days of the epidemic. Copper Blue was released shortly after Bob formally came out and I can only imagine how much trepidation and relief were simultaneously woven into artistic output that follows. The song is raw and impossibly sad. I was completely obsessed with this, listened to the song on repeat so many times, I ate my own sadness and now listening it makes me want to barf. It’s still the strongest song on the album, but I can’t listen to it.\n\nI frequently forget about Sugar and go months and occasionally years between Copper Blue listens, but that just makes putting it on all the much sweeter. It’s a ridiculously great album. I invite anyone to speak up if it isn’t their favorite post-Huskers Bob Mould output because I think it’s fairly unanimous. I would take it a step further, and would put it up against New Day Rising and Flip Your Wig any day. It’s ahead of most Huskers albums because of the production value but the songwriting is also brighter and bouncier. It’s musically if not lyrically more optimistic. Danceable.\n\nSugar shares a guitarist, lead vocalist, and primary songwriter with Husker Du and I explored Sugar’s catalog at the same time I did Husker Du, in the late 1990s. I ended up being a bigger fan of Sugar (and Bob Mould solo-proper). Sugar presents a modernized version of Husker Du (to the extent possible between the late ‘80s when the Huskers broke up to the early ‘90s when Copper Blue was issued). Pitchfork attributes this to the advent of Grunge and the mainstreaming of bands influenced by Husker Du as well as Bob Mould’s just hearing the Loveless album by My Bloody Valentine. This is funny in the context of my Sugar bias because I don’t particularly like My Bloody V"
