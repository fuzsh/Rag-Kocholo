        "text": "Hari Sreenivasan:\n\nLike all musical styles, punk rock has its history and its traditions, and, inevitably, the torch is passed as artists emerge.\n\nFor a new generation, punk veteran Kathleen Hanna, who co-founded the band Bikini Kill, continues to be an inspiration — especially for young women moving into this male-dominated genre.\n\nNewsHour Weekend's Christopher Booker has the story.\n\nLinda Lindas :\n\nA little while before went into lockdown a boy came up to me and said his dad told him to stay away from Chinese people. So this is about him and all the other racist, sexits boys in the world!\"\n\nChristopher Booker:\n\nFor those invested in punk rock, the Linda Lindas brief bombardment of social media feeds – provided proof positive that the future was in good hands.\n\nBut there was something else, the t-shirts – a not-so-subtle nod to one of punk's most seminal bands Bikinni Kill and its singer, Kathleen Hanna.\n\nIn the early 1990's Bikini Kill, led by Kathleen Hanna, was arguably one of the most influential groups in music – an integral part of a do-it-yourself art, music and political movement called Riot Grrrl, which gained prominence as alternative music came to dominate the airwaves and pop-culture. The Riot Grrrl scene however, existed in small clubs and college campuses – well outside of the commercial mainstream.\n\nKathleen Hanna:\n\nWe booked our own tours. We had no management and we did everything ourselves, including fixing van most of the time. Any woman or girl at our show. I would get their address and I would write them a postcard and say, Here, we're going to be here this day, put a heart or a star in your hand. if you see another girl with that, you'll know she's interested in feminism and you guys could start a conversation and it started working.\n\nKathleen Hanna:\n\nIf you're if you're challenging the status quo, a bunch of jerks are going to come out of the woodwork like termites and try and attack you. Some big magazine would write something about how we were just a bunch of sexual abuse survivors who hated men. And we were ruining the punk scene and our shows weren't really musical. They were speak outs. I mean, I could tell you a million stories. But to have to endure that and then go on stage and be like, Hey!\n\nKathleen Hanna:\n\nIf I got into this to be liked, this is like the wrong business to get into it. LIke we've all got to end oppression against all people. It's not about being a white woman who climbs the corporate ladder or who makes it on to a major labelor I get to play a big festival and everything's solved. It's about everyone coming together and feminism to me really is that.\n\nChristopher Booker:\n\nIn the late 90's, Bikini Kill slowed down. Hanna would release a solo record and also formed a trio called Le Tigre. Now a seasoned music veteran, she had made her mark. Bikinni Kills advocacy of what has been called Girl Power had become an integral part of culture and their song rebel girl an unofficial anthem, appearing in movies, television and even Miley Cyrus' 2021 Super Bowl Performance.\n\nKathleen Hanna:\n\nThe weirder part of the way that things I've been involved with have seeped into popular culture is walking into Target and seeing a girl power shirt, all the crap that we went through. You know, back in the day, it makes it worth it\n\nKathleen Hanna:\n\nI feel the same exact amount of anger.I mean It's not like sexism stopped existing. You know, when we were, actually were we were going we were checking out different booking agents that we wanted to work with. And one of them, a male, was like, Well, you better strike while the iron is hot, you know, with this like Kavanaugh stuff. And you know, and it's like, don't worry, I think sexism still going on, you going to exist like next year. I don't think we need to really rush this. It's around for a long time.\n\nKathleen Hanna:\n\nI've always been put in a position where if I say something in a sort of weird way or I have an off interview or something like that, or even if I have a great interview, someone's going to take issue with it and I don't care. I mean, I can't live my life that way.\n\nChristopher Booker:\n\nFounded in 2018 and working in collaboration with an organization called the Peace Sisters – Tees-for-Togo sells designer t-shirts for $40.00 a piece – each helping to pay for a girl to go to school in Togo, West Africa for one year.\n\nTurns out the t-shirts worn by the Linda Lindas in their viral video clip werent just band shirts, but Tees-for-Togo shirts.\n\nChristopher Booker:\n\nWhen you think of a band like the Linda Lindas against your experience, what kind of advice would you give them for the world they're entering as people, as young people that have something to say and have and a want to say something in a cynical world?\n\nKathleen Hanna:\n\nI always think of it like this,,a kid threw spitballs at you in your class and you think, 'Oh this kid is hating on me' that kid just wants to get your attention and it is the same way if you are somebody that speaks out in the public eye. There is going to be people who want to have some kind of relationship with you and if they can't have a positive relationship with you, they will have a negative relationship with you and I would tell them that the spitballs mean people are paying attention and that all of the negative stuff means it's working and if you're not getting those negative comments like, are you really a punk?"
