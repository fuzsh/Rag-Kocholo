        "text": "Riot Grrrl, began as an underground USA feminist musical movement in the early 1990s, emerging in Washington DC, and the Pacific Northwest. It was often performed by all-female groups, and was lyrically focused on female empowerment and tackling controversial issues such as domestic violence, discrimination and rape. Musically, riot grrrl typically featured the customary Rock instrumentation of electric guitar, bass guitar and drums, whilst the style was rooted in Punk Rock and took cues from Grunge, Post-Hardcore and Noise Rock.\n\nTrademarks include shouted female vocals which are usually chaotic, sneering and confrontational; loose, abrasive distorted guitar; and short, concise track times and song structures. The subsequent sound produced is raw, strident, aggressive, perfunctory, and often ramshackle or disjointed. Many were often not considered part of the wider political movement and were seen as adjacent to the movement, such as Grunge acts Babes in Toyland, 7 Year Bitch, and L7. Likewise there are quite a few groups that are also part of the Queercore scene.\n\nThe term Riot Grrrl stems from Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman, members of the feminist punk band Bratmobile, who coined the phrase “girl riot.” Jen Smith then created the term “grrrl” and later “Riot Grrrl” through the expression “angry grrrl zines” devised by Tobi Vail.. Early participants deliberately used “grrrl” instead of “girl” to remove the passive association with the word “girl” as well as to display the anger behind the movement, reminiscent of a growl.\n\nOn August 20, 1991, in Olympia, Washington, members of Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, along with 15 other all-girl or female-fronted bands, took the stage at an event called \"Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now\" or simply, \"Girl Night.\" Girl Night was the kickoff show of the International Pop Underground Convention (IPU), a five-day gathering of D.I.Y. scenesters organized by K Records' Calvin Johnson and Candice Pederson. The IPU established K Records and the Kill Rock Stars label (launched by an eponymous compilation sold at the convention) as hubs of one camp in a factionalizing indie rock scene. They intended to embrace creativity over commerce — and invite everyone to the party.\n\nFashion[]\n\nRiot Grrrl is not a fashion term or usage. Kinderwhore fashion was used by both Hole's Courtney Love and Kat Bjelland from Babes in Toyland.\n\nFanzines[]\n\nAlthough Riot Grrrl emerged in Washington, D.C., it became mostly popular in Washington, specifically Olympia through the use of “zines,” which are short for “fanzines.” Zines are homemade publications with limited circulation. Zines became an important part of the punk scene in the early 1970s because it was a way to produce a publication “unhampered by corporate structure”. However, zines served as a place to discuss issues that were considered taboo in mainstream culture such as rape, incest, and eating disorders. Zines allowed women to form connections with other women that shared similar ideas and experiences and ultimately created a community. In Washington D.C., some of the band members from Bikini Kill and Bratmobile, held weekly meetings for women to attend, express their frustrations, and show support for one another. Approximately two years after the introduction of Riot Grrrl zines, a small Riot Grrrl network formed which spread to New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Richmond. These were groups of high school to college aged girl that met often to discuss ideas, plan Riot Grrrl festivals, and support each other’s music.\n\nMusic[]\n\nMusically, Riot Grrrl sometimes fit right alongside their male counterparts in the Grunge scene, taking the world by storm in the 1990s. However most were never included in the Grunge scene and were far more punk based. Hole is not considered Riot Grrrl as they never embraced the community feminist aspect of that scene. Some popular bands and artists include:\n\nBikini Kill\n\nBratmobile\n\nBabes in Toyland\n\nL7\n\nJack off Jill\n\n7 Year Bitch\n\nCalamity Jane\n\nHuggy Bear\n\nHeavens to Betsy\n\nSlant 6\n\nTeam Dresch\n\nExcuse 17\n\nSleater-Kinney\n\nTribe 8\n\nDominatrix\n\nLunachicks\n\nJulie Ruin\n\nKathleen Hanna\n\nCourtney Love\n\nDocumentary[]\n\nThe Punk Singer is a 2013 documentary film about feminist singer Kathleen Hanna who fronted the bands Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, and who was a central figure in the riot grrrl movement. Using a combination of interviews and archival footage including live band performances, the film traces the life and career of Hanna from her troubled upbringing and her start in spoken word performance poetry, through her riot grrrl zines, her prominent punk and dance-punk bands, her coining of the phrase \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" for Kurt Cobain, her solo career as Julie Ruin, her feminist activism, her marriage to Beastie Boys member Adam Horovitz, and ending with Hanna's 2010 diagnosis of late-stage Lyme disease and the severe treatments she endures to combat it.\n\nResources[]\n\nExternal links to help get a better understanding of this music aesthetic.\n\nRYM Ultimate Box Set > Riot Grrrl\n\nA Quick Guide to: Riot Grrrl\n\nRevolution girl style now: an introduction to the riot grrrl movement\n\nGrrrlzines"
