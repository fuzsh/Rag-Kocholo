        "text": "It’s been 12 years since Le Tigre released This Island, a beautiful, heartfelt, sweaty offering of electro-clash and dance punk that had every riot grrl and boy grooving in their gender-defying pants. The album performed well, but the band decided to fly low from there – until now.\n\nKathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman and JD Samson are back, just in time for tonight’s final Presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The rockin’ women throw their weight behind the first female to be nominated by a major party for the Oval Office, and they aren’t pulling any punches when it comes to their opinions on Trump.\n\n“I’m With Her” is as much about the beat as the politically driven lyrics. Check it out below."
