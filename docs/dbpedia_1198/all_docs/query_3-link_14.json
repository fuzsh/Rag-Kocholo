        "text": "Roseland Theater, Portland, OR\n\n7/7/2023\n\nTime is a flat circle but that doesn’t make it feel any less Sisyphean to find ourselves stuck in the same place we were in the last time people danced to the live music of New York/Northwestern dance-punk heroes Le Tigre. Queer rights are still not secure, the planet is still slowly killing us to save itself, the right wing still hasn’t been destroyed, Rudy Giuliani is still such a fucking jerk — even though it feels like we should have our shit together, we’re permanently stuck in the Darkest Timeline. Some bands get back together because they still have things to say, but sometimes they do it because the things they were singing about during their heydays are still relevant today (something the members of Refused reflected on when they played the same stage three years ago, complete with screaming “NOTHING HAS CHANGED! NOTHING HAS CHANGED!”). If the things you’ve got to say are important, not only do you stop caring about sounding like a broken record, but you jump at the chance to put the record on again, for those who didn’t hear it the first time.\n\nTo say that people were fucking pumped to see this band and hear these songs is an understatement. Even the breaks between songs being played over the PA got thunderous applause in the minutes before and after their 10 PM stage time (they were a few minutes late, so the crowd got faked out more than once). Le Tigre is the kind of band that inspires fervor in a certain type of listener — not everyone knows them (though they may know of Kathleen Hanna’s other band, Bikini Kill), but the people who do often have very strong feelings about them. This isn’t always evident; last August, I traveled to This Ain’t No Picnic Festival in Pasadena, CA partially because the festival had convinced the dance-punk trio to reunite for the first time in 11 years. The show was electrifying and a total blast, but the energy at the historic Rose Bowl festival grounds was that of, well, a band that wasn’t headlining a music festival. The crowd at the Roseland was… the exact opposite. When Hanna, JD Samson, and Johanna Fateman took the stage, that energy felt like… well, it felt exactly what you’d expect from a (majority, I’m sure) queer audience who knew they were all but guaranteed to see “Deceptacon,” played by the Kathleen Hanna. It was… rejuvenating.\n\nRejuvenating is one way to describe Le Tigre’s performance, but it was also bizarrely retro. Le Tigre’s self-titled debut came out in the dying days of the 20th century, and although that wasn’t that long ago, something about the general aesthetic of the group feels misplaced in time. It almost felt like that was part of the performance; in between songs, Hanna and the other members repeatedly commented on frustrating it was that these songs were still painfully relevant, meaning their reunion isn’t just for fun — it’s the same type of rebellion that they represented back in the aughts. It went deeper than that, though. For starters, their outfits felt like they were a ‘70s rockabilly band, which was only amplified when they changed into quasi-matching black-and-white striped outfits during “Get Off the Internet.” Their visuals were engaging but never overbearing, settling into being not just refreshingly lo-fi (they looked great, but they were nothing fancy) and utilitarian, with every song’s visuals including lyrics to the song, which allowed them to solve an issue finding an ASL interpreter in a way that benefitted the whole audience.\n\nThe stuck in the past-vibe worked well for banter, though — when they weren’t talking about their political frustrations, they were telling stories about living in Old Portland, like about going to Lincoln and Grant High School, and about how she and Fateman met because Hanna adored the Bikini Kill zine Fateman had given her so much, she tracked her down to her job a Halloween warehouse she’d worked in downtown just to see her again. Le Tigre might be a New York band, but their roots run deep enough in the Northwest that it’s hard to not consider them hometown heroes.\n\nThis show was a breath of fresh air in so many ways that we’ve already covered, but when it comes down to it, the one thing that matters is how they sounded — and, honestly, they sounded great. The music of Le Tigre is exciting and arguably kinda muscular, but even when their music feels like it’s punching you in the face (see: the rapid-fire delivery of “Deceptacon”), the production always kept them from really hitting hard. Here in the Roseland, though, they sounded like a riot. Every song felt like a direct hit, amplified by the raucous crowd gleefully screaming “DON’T! YOU! KNOW-OH! IT’S OUR DANCEFLOOR!” or “WHAT’S YOUR TAKE ON! CASSAVETES?!” or whatever else Hanna et al commanded them to sing out with their whole hearts. The guitars sounded huge, too — the Roseland is never great for sound, but Le Tigre’s set was mixed just right, allowing it to sound gritty but not muddy. Not every band gets this lucky, but Le Tigre certainly deserved it.\n\nAt this point, a lesser publication might joke, with all the best intentions, that if all it took for Le Tigre to reunite was the country being torn asunder by the rise of fascism, it would be worth it. But let’s be real: it’s not a fair trade-off. If you asked the majority of the audience if they’d give up listening to Hanna’s music altogether in order to avert the boring apocalypse we’ve blundered into unbidden, they’d ask you where to sign up to make it happen. That said, if we’re going to be stuck in the slow-motion destruction of the United States, being accompanied by bands like Le Tigre is a pretty excellent band to join in raging against the dying of the light. After all, they were singing “This is repetitive/ But nothing has changed” all the way back in 2001. Who better to dance with than the band who saw the writing on the wall long enough ago that they know the steps by heart already?"
