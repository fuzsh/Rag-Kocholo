        "text": "Kathleen Hanna performing with Bikini Kill in 1991, image via\n\nKathleen Hanna is, was, and always shall be a polarizing person. As the lead singer of the punk band Bikini Kill, her unapologetic views helped define the third wave of feminism in the 90s and spurred the Riot Grrrl movement. Kathleen‚Äôs brazenness courted a great deal of critics who wanted to downplay the necessity of feminism; but as was customary for her, she continued to speak out against the male-dominated society with ferocity, and in the process became a reluctant but forceful spokesperson for her cause. After the demise of Bikini Kill, Kathleen recorded a solo album under the pseudonym Julie Ruin before forming the dance-punk band Le Tigre. The latter experienced a great deal of commercial success before Kathleen abruptly quit without explanation, leaving the spotlight without a trace.\n\nSix years later, a documentary is being released about Kathleen‚Äôs life. The Punk Singer chronicles her journey from an outspoken youth in Olympia up to her new band, the Julie Ruin. In the movie, she explains that her decision to stop performing in Le Tigre was due to late-onset Lyme disease, an illness that sapped all of her energy and left her feeling unable to do what she loves most. I sat down with Kathleen to ask her a few questions about punk rock, death, and what she thinks about Miley Cyrus calling herself a feminist.\n\nVICE: Hey.\n\nKathleen Hanna: How are you doing today?\n\nTerrible.\n\nDo you want to talk about it?\n\nNo.\n\nAre you sure?\n\nYes. I could get into it, but there‚Äôs no point. I‚Äôd tell you about working on a resume all day for some job at an ice skating rink, but that would make for rather boring commentary, wouldn‚Äôt it? I‚Äôm failing to compete with 17-year-olds.\n\nBummer. I‚Äôve been thinking about writing a resume. I was looking at being a teacher at the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music where I would help students improve their performance techniques. I kept thinking about how I would do that. I mean, what would I say? ‚ÄúHave charisma. You should all wear crowns.‚Äù\n\nSpeaking of charisma, who is your favorite lead singer of Black Flag?\n\n[Extremely long pause] I can‚Äôt say. What‚Äôs that one guy‚Äôs name? See, I know Henry, but‚Ä¶ he wasn‚Äôt my favorite. He‚Äôll probably find out, but he‚Äôs a nice guy and won‚Äôt care. So I‚Äôd say that first guy whose name I can‚Äôt remember.\n\nYeah, if you‚Äôd said Henry Rollins, I was planning on getting up and walking out of the room.\n\nIf you think about it, it‚Äôs kind of unheard of for a good band to have more than one good lead singer. Actually, I almost tried out for the Misfits when they tried to reform. I think I have a total Misfits voice, and seriously, I could have done it. It was right at the tail end of Bikini Kill, and I was like, Do I keep doing Bikini Kill for the rest of the year or do I try out for the Misfits? I was convinced I was going to be picked.\n\nIt would have been badass.\n\nIt would have totally been badass! It would have changed the course of my history at least. If I showed up and it was all dudes, it would have been really funny. I would have stood out.\n\nHow do you feel about bands like the Dwarves?\n\nOh, the Dwarves‚Ä¶ you know that album cover from Blood Guts & Pussy?\n\nYes.\n\nActually, do you know Corin Tucker? She was one of the singers from Sleater-Kinney and Heavens to Betsy, total Riot Grrrl bands from Olympia in the 90s. Corin had this really beautiful voice that made us all cry. But anyways, she was a 17 or 18-year-old college student making a video and she interviewed Bikini Kill and did not like us. She saw us as selfish because we were feminists and we were doing this thing that was pro-women‚Äîat least that‚Äôs what I felt when I first met her.\n\nI watched her feelings about us change while we were doing the interview. She was actually listening to our ideas and was like, ‚ÄúWait a minute, I‚Äôm a feminist, I actually have felt these same kinds of things‚Ä¶‚Äù So she changed her movie to be about the cover of Blood Guts & Pussy. She interviewed all the female bands that were around the scene about it. She‚Äôd hold up the cover and everyone would talk about it.\n\nI was really offended by that album. We were in a scene that was so fucking male dominated and we were treated so poorly and that the album just sort of threw it in our faces. The whole thing was really anti-PC. If you read books about where that phrase came from, it was actually developed by a conservative think tank. Then it got used by people as a way to be racist or sexist or homophobic and absolve themselves from it. I do think there needs to be humor that‚Äôs uncontained, and I don‚Äôt think everyone has to agree on everything, but I think it‚Äôs important to understand the origins of the anti-PC movement.\n\nWith everything that was going on in the Northwest, I felt that Dwarves cover was simply shock for shock value. It was just to get attention, and it was at the expense of women. You know what I mean? There‚Äôs a naked woman with blood all over her body‚Ä¶ and a dwarf? Like, why? [Laughs] It is an arresting image, I‚Äôll give them that. You can‚Äôt forget it once you see it, so something was going on there, but I felt they were just doing this ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre just so fucked up and crazy and anti-PC‚Äù thing.\n\nKathleen Hanna. Photo by Pat Smear.\n\nThat certainly seemed like part of it.\n\nI knew so many men who wanted to get into arguments about feminism just because it was funny to them. They‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just being a devil‚Äôs advocate here,‚Äù and I‚Äôd say, ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt understand. I live this, and it‚Äôs not funny to me.‚Äù\n\nHow involved were you in the editing process of the movie? Were there things you wanted to get in there that didn‚Äôt and vice versa?\n\nI didn‚Äôt craft the narrative, which was very weird. I just kept reminding myself that it was Sini and Tamara‚Äôs movie, and it was gonna be whatever they decided it was gonna be. I tried to be kind of tight lipped about it. I don‚Äôt have any perspective on myself. You know, a lot of times before I go on stage I‚Äôll ask my best friend Kathy what I should wear and I‚Äôll just do it because I don‚Äôt have any perspective on what looks good on me and what doesn‚Äôt. I kind of had the same take on the movie. I didn‚Äôt have any perspective on what my story is, so I just let them go at it.\n\nThe only things I was kind of freaked out about was a) that shitty spoken word at the beginning, which makes me cringe, and b) the one part where I talk about my mom, the trusting thing.\n\n[Editor‚Äôs Note: In the movie, Kathleen talks about her and her mother‚Äôs somewhat sadistic relationship by describing a scene where the two play a trust game. Kathleen lets herself fall backwards expecting her mother to catch her, but instead her mother lets her fall to the ground. Lying there, she looked up to see her mother laughing. At this point her mother remarked, ‚ÄúLet that be a lesson to you. Don‚Äôt trust anyone, not even your own mother.‚Äù]\n\nI told my therapist that story and she was like, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so messed up, it explains why you‚Äôre fucked up.‚Äù And I was laughing. Every time I‚Äôve told that story I‚Äôve laughed because I think it‚Äôs very funny that a grown woman would do that to a child. My mom was the type of person who was always almost pointing at herself, saying, ‚ÄúWho let me be a mom?‚Äù She was cool and I always understood her sense of humor. So I made them add a voiceover of me saying something stupid like, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs actually really awesome and I love her a lot.‚Äù I had to put something in that didn‚Äôt make it look like my mom was abusive, because she wasn‚Äôt.\n\nI thought that part was kind of cute and funny.\n\nI do, too! Nobody else does.\n\nI wrote something down like, ‚ÄúI wish somebody had taught me that lesson before I met my ex-girlfriend.‚Äù\n\nDon‚Äôt trust anyone, not even your own mom.\n\nHere‚Äôs a question nobody wanted me to ask you: What do you think about death?\n\nOh, that‚Äôs a great question. I think it‚Äôs like a portal that you can go through to get out if you want, and it‚Äôs in every room‚Äîat least I see it in every room. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm suicidal, it just means there‚Äôs always an escape route. Maybe that‚Äôs totally fucked up, but I think death is an escape route if you need it. It‚Äôs like an eject button. But I‚Äôm a control freak, so I always see myself as the one who makes the decision in the end. But that‚Äôs a really weird question because I honestly do see it as a tunnel.\n\nI wonder how that‚Äôs going to read?\n\nJust draw a picture of a hole in a wall.\n\nHow often do you think about death?\n\nWell, not as much as I used to, but when I was sick I thought about it all the time. That‚Äôs when the portal ideas started going in my head. When you‚Äôre in an extreme amount of pain constantly, you become a totally different person. You start thinking to yourself, How can I make this stop? I was taking all this medication, marijuana pills, anything to make it stop, and it wasn‚Äôt working. So I‚Äôm like, there‚Äôs one way that I can make this stop. I had to believe that at some point I could make it through it, but knowing the portal was there was very helpful. I felt if it came down to it, I could make that choice.\n\nI heard you say on NPR that you‚Äôre just as angry as before, but you‚Äôve managed to direct it better. What pisses you off now?\n\nYou. [Laughs]\n\nDo you still feel like you‚Äôre being attacked?\n\nNo‚Äîand you don‚Äôt make me angry, I just thought it was a funny thing to say. Things have really come around. People have been super cool. I feel like I got a lot of shit in the 90s from all sides, from asshole feminists who resented me and the attention I was getting, from dudes who didn‚Äôt want the punk scene to include women, from asshole journalists who just talked about our butts and what we were wearing, to people who wrote fanzines and wrote that same shit. What‚Äôs the difference between the mainstream and the underground if the fanzines are writing the same exact stuff Rolling Stone is writing?\n\nI feel 20 years later, people are like, ‚ÄúWow, that mattered, that was cool,‚Äù and I‚Äôm getting the kind of positive attention that I didn‚Äôt get back then. So when people are like, ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs just nostalgia, that‚Äôs why people care about the grunge scene,‚Äù I‚Äôm like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a shit.‚Äù I just like feeling appreciated because at the time we weren‚Äôt appreciated, and people would throw shit at our heads while we were playing, and it was really, really hard. So I‚Äôm stoked.\n\nThe Julie Ruin‚Äôs song ‚ÄúGirls Like Us‚Äù reminds me of ‚ÄúTypical Girls‚Äù from the Slits‚Ä¶\n\nYes, but, I think ‚ÄúTypical Girls‚Äù is more making fun of girls who read magazines, put lipstick on, and stuff like that. I never liked that divide. I never liked the whole ‚Äúwe‚Äôre the cool girls who play music and you‚Äôre the stupid girls who go to the mall,‚Äù because I was the stupid girl who went to the mall and then later got into music. I feel like ‚ÄúGirls Like Us‚Äù is a statement that there‚Äôs no unity. And there shouldn‚Äôt be unity. There are no ‚Äúgirls like us.‚Äù All the shit in that song is totally abstract and doesn‚Äôt make any sense, and I guess in a lot of ways that is a tribute to the Slits. A lot of Ari‚Äôs lyrics were pretty fucking weird‚Ä¶ She was a fucking weird person.\n\nMiley Cyrus recently called herself one of the biggest feminists in the world. Is she?\n\nI love that. I have no idea. What do you think?\n\nI don‚Äôt know.\n\nI don‚Äôt know either. I mean, I feel like it‚Äôs cool that she‚Äôs this young girl that calls herself a feminist, but‚Ä¶ do we want her in our club? [Laughs] Have you seen the new Lily Allen video? I‚Äôd suggest you watch that."
