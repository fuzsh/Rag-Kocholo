        "text": "One of musicâs most hyped acts of 2012, Perfume Genius has been getting tons of attention over the past few months, not only because heâs got a fantastic new album out, Put Your Back N 2 It, but because he and his label have fought a very public battle with YouTube over a relatively tame music video in which the artist cuddles with a (mostly clothed) porn star. Rallying gay rights activists, music bloggers, and even Michael Stipe to his cause, he has brought queer issues to the forefront of indie rock â a rare accomplishment, despite the fact that thereâs no shortage of LGBT artists whose music falls into that ill-defined category.\n\nWhile music fans are probably already familiar with the big names â Antony Hegarty, Beth Ditto of The Gossip, Scissor Sisters, Stephin Merrit of The Magnetic Fields, Tegan and Sara, Grizzly Bearâs Ed Droste, Kele Okereke of Bloc Party, Carrie Brownstein â weâre celebrating Perfume Geniusâ new album by rounding up a few less well-known queer indie rockers who deserve your attention. Check out our picks after the jump, and add your own in the comments.\n\nPerfume Genius\n\nFans of Antony and the Johnsons need to discover Perfume Genius (aka Mike Hadreas) ASAP. His introspective ballads can be intimate and grand at once, demanding our full attention and threatening to move us to tears. While his debut, 2010âs Learning, was a deeply troubled account of a rough, isolated period in Hadreasâ life, Put Your Back N 2 It addresses many of the same dark subjects from a place of growth and even grace. But the best thing about Perfume Genius is that, two albums in, he seems to just be finding his voice and audience. We canât wait to hear what the next record brings.\n\nJD Samson\n\nA late but welcome addition to Le Tigre in the early aughts, boyish JD Samson was always the most enthusiastic dancer at the trioâs performances. So it makes sense that the charmingly mustachioed musician has gone on to front MEN, a retro-dance band and art collective thatâs all about feminism, queer rights, and class-conscious social critique. That may all sound fairly heavy, but the greatest thing about Samson is her ability to balance political lyrics with irresistible beats. MEN have just dropped a new EP, Next; you can hear the title track at Bust.\n\nPatrick Wolf\n\nOne of indie rockâs most staggeringly talented one-man bands, Patrick Wolf isnât just a multi-instrumentalist â heâs also capable of producing great music in just about any genre or mood. Since his 2003 debut, released when Wolf was only 20, heâs made Irish folk-flavored albums, flashy records full of bouncy production numbers (like âThe Magic Position,â above), and even dark, S&M-themed electronic pop. His most recent full-length, Lupercalia, is named for and takes atmospheric cues from a pagan fertility festival that is a somewhat wilder forerunner of Valentineâs Day. Thereâs no wrong place to dip into his discography â just start with whatever period interests you, and see if you donât end up downloading everything heâs ever done.\n\nKaki King\n\nAnother genre-hopping multi-instrumentalist, Kaki King is an incredibly accomplished musician. Best known for her skills on a variety of guitar types, sheâs masterful at the fret-tapping technique that has become Marnie Sternâs trademark, but can also rock out multiple tunings and flamenco flourishes. Her career has been defined by constant transformation, with King performing solo and fronting a band, drifting from acoustic instrumentals to post-rock soundscapes and back again. And if that isnât impressive enough for you, she also does film and TV scores.\n\nOwen Pallett\n\nAfter several years as Final Fantasy, Canadian musician and Polaris Music Prize winner Owen Pallett retired the moniker and began recording under his own name before the release of his most recent album, 2010âs Heartland. A singer, violinist, and keyboard player, heâs especially fond of loop pedals â but Pallettâs technical skills never overshadow the emotional, narrative feel of his intricate pop songs. His is the kind of music that sounds pleasant at first listen, but deepens and complexifies when you stop to notice the lyrics.\n\nChristopher Owens\n\nGirls frontman Christopher Owens has gotten at least as much press for growing up in a cult as for his music â which is predictable, if not entirely fair. Over the course of two fantastic albums, Girls have refined a style that combines pop and noise, mixing hints of â50s-style rock crooning with twisted-metal guitar fuzz and catchy, wistful melodies. As a result, the band hits all your retro pleasure censors without ever feeling like a throwback.\n\nHunx\n\nOf course, thereâs nothing wrong with being a throwback if what youâre doing is fun and clever. Take, for example, Hunx (real name: Seth Bogart) â who started out in the anarchic queer electro-pop act Gravy Train!!!! before striking out on his own in 2008. His new band, Hunx and His Punx, is like an even campier version of Grease, makes â60s girl group-style music about love and youth and heartbreak. Hunx also just put out a highly enjoyable solo record, Hairdresser Blues, thatâs in the same vein as his work with the Punx.\n\nTami Hart\n\nTami Hart is basically the best. Involved in the feminist DIY music scene since her teens, sheâs been a folk rocker and a punk and played in some of the greatest LA bands of the past decade (Abe Vigoda, Mika Miko) â but her most recent project, Making Friendz, just might be our favorite. A â90s-inspired combination of R&B, dance music, punk rock, and what we can only (appreciatively) call queer slow jams, the New York-based band released its debut LP, Social Life, last year. Warning: The albumâs standout single, âSituationâ (posted above), is awfully addictive.\n\nMirah\n\nPortland-based singer-songwriter Mirah Yom Tov Zeitlyn creates delicate, deeply felt songs that sound experimental and open and familiar at the same time. Weâve always thought of her albums as cold-weather music, the perfect soundtrack for days spent snowbound. In addition to her solo work, Mirah is a champion collaborator: Her 2000 breakthrough, You Think Itâs Like This But Really Itâs Like This, featured contributions from Phil Elverum of Mt. Eerie, and sheâs also released albums with artist (and MEN member) Ginger Brooks Takahashi, Black Cat Orchestra, and Spectratone International. Perhaps her greatest collaboration, last yearâs Thao + Mirah, found the musician teaming up with like-minded rocker Thao Nguyen.\n\nJamie Stewart"
