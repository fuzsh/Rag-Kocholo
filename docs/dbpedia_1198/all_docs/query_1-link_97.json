        "text": "In March, Alice Bag lead singer and co-founder of groundbreaking early punk band The Bags, released her second solo album titled Blueprint. Recently she played two shows in one day in Northern California. This photo diary is made up of images that I took at the second show at 1234 Go records in Oakland, California. This is only the 1st part of the photo diary, I’ll post part two when time permits.\n\nAlice and her band will be playing The Echo in Los Angeles this Saturday April 7th at 5:30 pm. This is an all ages show. Tickets are only $10.00 and you can find a link to purchase them at the end of the post.\n\nBelow is an excerpt from an interview Alice recently gave to the La Times.\n\nHere is another cool quote I wanted to share. She gave this one to LA Weekly in an interview published on March 8th of this year:\n\n“Punk has gone through some weird periods,” Bag says. “Truthfully, I feel like for a while certain parts of the media would just play the white boy bands, and people started to believe that punk rock is for, like, white suburban males. People started stepping forward and saying, ‘No, that’s not what it is.’ Look at your punk history. There were people of color, women of color, there were queers, and it was much more diverse. Now, when I go and see a punk show, I find that there’s a lot of diversity. They don’t have a homogeneous look or sound. It’s more about doing something original and having something different to say. I think that’s what keeps punk relevant.”\n\nPicture below is Toni Santoya. She plays drums in Alice’s band.\n\nThis gentleman is Sharif Dumani. He is not only the guitarist in Alice’s band, but he also plays for Future Shoxxx and Exploding Flowers.\n\nThese next photos are of Midnite Snaxx. They are a female fronted punk band and they were one of the opening acts.\n\nPictures above: drummer Sammy Gutierrrez and bassist Camylle Reynolds.\n\nPictured below, Chris Santamaria guitarist and Dulcinea Gonzalez lead singer/guitarist.\n\nAfter Midnite Snaxxx finished their set, one of the men in the audience approached bassist Camylle Reynolds and condescendingly advised her to smile more when she is onstage. As you can see from the photo below, Camylle made sure she promptly told him where to go and Alice even called him out onstage. Ha!\n\nDon’t think he’ll be making that mistake again…..\n\nDulcinea Gonzalez enjoying a well deserved post gig beverage.\n\nThank you for stopping by the blog everyone and stay tuned for Part 2 of the photo diary featuring Lost Balloons and all of the awesome fashion form the gig.\n\nTo buy tickets to Alice’s show on Saturday CLICK HERE\n\nClick here to connect with us on INSTAGRAM.\n\nClick here to connect with us on FACEBOOK\n\nAlice Bag IG: @alice_bag"
