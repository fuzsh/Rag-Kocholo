        "text": "So why is Le Tigre’s Le Tigre on this best 1,000 albums ever thing?\n\nI spent around nine months doing research for this best 1,000 albums project, and most of that involved listening to thousands of albums by as many artists and bands that I could get my greedy little hands and ears on. Spotify was immensely helpful in this effort, and where it occasionally didn’t have what I was looking for, YouTube usually filled in very ably*.\n\n* It’s a very different world from the one in which my musical life consisted of my cassette and CD collections, plus the radio. Wasn’t all that long ago, really!\n\nI did all of this research, all of this “work,” because it’s super fun. Heck, it didn’t even start out as a “project”; it was more something to pass the time during the early, darkest days of the pandemic. But as it did involve into a “project,” I took it seriously because if I was to develop and publish something as crazy – stupid dumb as the Beastie Boys might say – as a “best 1,000 albums” list (in order from 1,000 to number one!), I figured that I better make sure I’ve truly scoured the earth and the webs for anything that remotely has a chance to make the cut.\n\nThis is all backdrop in relaying the fact that I had never in my life heard of Le Tigre until the research phase for the best 1k albums project, and rather late into it at that.\n\n“Deceptacon,” the lead track on Le Tigre (and the entire album as a whole to an extent) absolutely melts my brain every time I listen to it. It’s silly, strange, loose, and fun on the one hand, and absolutely crushes sonically with an incredibly catchy hook that maps across new wave, punk, and power pop.\n\n“Deceptacon” is that gem you’re willing to spend all afternoon – hell, all month – digging around in the dusty crates in the back of the music store for. It’s absolutely brilliant. And so is the rest of Le Tigre.\n\nThe only reason that this album isn’t much, much higher on the best 1,000 albums list is because I simply haven’t spent enough time with it. If I can get one person turned onto Le Tigre, it’ll make the entire… bompalompalomp, for lack of a better word, worthwhile.\n\n“Phanta” dials up weirdo electronic effects into a punk mix that I think the likes of Frank Black, Pixies, and Devo heads could equally get down with.\n\n“Hot Topic” leans into a retro 1960s sensibility that reminds me much of the great Ursula 1000 (see: The Now Sound of Ursula 1000: #912 of best 1,000 albums ever).\n\nSee you later.\n\nSome stats & info about Le Tigre\n\nWhat kind of musical stylings does this album represent? Rock Music, New Wave, Post Punk Revival, Alternative Rock\n\nRolling Stone’s greatest 500 albums ranking – not ranked!\n\nAll Music’s rating – 4 out of 5 stars\n\nWhen was Le Tigre released? 1999\n\nMy ranking, the one you’re reading right now – #549 out of 1,000\n\nLe Tigre on Spotify\n\nA lyrical snippet from Le Tigre that’s evocative of the album in some way, maybe\n\nWho took the bomp from the bompalompalomp? Who took the ram from the ramalamadingdong?\n\nWhat’s the most interesting thing about Le Tigre that most people don’t know?\n\nLe Tigre, the self-titled album by the feminist electronic dance punk band Le Tigre, was notable for its unique blend of political and social commentary with danceable beats and electronic music. It’s widely regarded as an important and influential release in the feminist and queer music scenes. Also interesting is that it was recorded entirely on vintage analog equipment, giving it a distinct sound that set it apart from the more digital and polished sound of much of the electronic music at the time.\n\nWhat does the “best 1,000 albums ever” mean and why are you doing this?\n\nYeah, I know it’s audacious, a little crazy (okay, maybe a lot cray cray), bordering on criminal nerdery."
