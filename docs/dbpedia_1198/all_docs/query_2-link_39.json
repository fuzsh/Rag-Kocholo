Lyrics stop and start like musical chairs.When you piece together their little chunks of shattered words, the effect goes beyond metaphor. It's not surrealism; nor realism.

Words are arranged around the musical arrangements, and vice-versa. Friendly agreement.\"Le Tigre\" might not be that serious but it is beautiful, like a chandelier in the jungle, reflecting and refracting light in such a way that people blink, bugs run and babies sneeze.",
