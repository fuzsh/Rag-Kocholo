        "text": "Erase Errata started playing shows in San Francisco in the late â90s. The band spent the better part of the early aughts perfecting their jumpy, jagged post-punk and touring with the likes of Le Tigre and Sonic Youth. After an extended hiatus that began in 2009, three of Erase Errataâs four original membersâsinger/guitarist Jenny Hoyston, drummer Bianca Sparta, and bassist Ellie Ericksonârejoined this January to self-release Lost Weekend, their first full-length record in nine years.\n\nA lot has changed for the longtime friends, who are now spread between the Bay Area and Texas, but Jenny, Bianca, and Ellie have kept the band going through emailed demos, studio time when they can swing it, and shows (theyâll play a string of dates along the West Coast this fall).\n\nEarlier this month, I hopped on the phone with Bianca to find out more about how to keep a band alive, why sheâs looking forward to shredding well into old age, and Erase Errataâs new video for âDonât Sit/Lie,â (conceived and directed by their friend Hannah Lew of Grass Widow and Cold Beat):\n\nMAURA LYNCH: Hi! What are you up to today?\n\nBIANCA SPARTA: Weâre just getting going. I have a little baby, so we spent the morning reading books and eating breakfast.\n\nYour new video is for the song âDonât Sit/Lie,â but the song has a different title on the album, right?\n\nThe title that is on the record, [âAnother Reason to Arrest & Imprison the âFreeââ,] is different than what we actually call it. [The song] is about San Franciscoâs Sit/Lie ordinanceâbasically, you canât sit or lie down on the sidewalk [between 7 AM and 12 PM], otherwise you get a ticket. Police use it to harass homeless people, to get them to move, so that the âeyesoreâ is not on the street anymore. People voted that into law here, and we were totally offended by that.\n\nThe video stars [performance artist/musician/comedian] Dynasty Handbag. Iâd never seen her before, so I started watching all of her videos on YouTube and now Iâm obsessed. How did she get involved?\n\nDynasty Handbag, aka Jibz Cameron, used to live in San Francisco and we would perform with her project at the timeâshe used to have a band called Dynasty, which was more of a band-band with songs, which sort of morphed into Dynasty Handbag, a performance art thing. I hope more people are introduced to her because sheâs a genius. We introduced her to [the videoâs director] Hannah LewâI guess everyoneâs just connected through music.\n\nAfter you watched the video, how did you feel it fit with the song?\n\nOh my god, I loved it. Itâs like the perfect video in my mind, and Iâm completely happy with it. I like that itâs one womanâs trip through insanity and back. I think itâs really funny, too.\n\nLost Weekend is the first LP Erase Errata has put out since 2006. What have you all been up to since?\n\nEllie started business school, a masters program in Berkeley. Jenny moved back to Texas where sheâs from. And I have a baby.\n\nDid you ever feel like you were going to break up as a band or was it a decision to chill out for a little bit?\n\nIt was always a decision that we wanted to play music in whatever capacity. We all still really enjoy each otherâs company and playing music. Weâre not doing this as a career; we donât have any goals as a band except to be a band and write music.\n\nI love that. How is it different from when the band first started?\n\nWe were touring six months out of the year. We would write a record then immediately start writing the next record. Thatâs exhausting, and not how any of us wanted to live. We just do it as a hobby [now], and I think thatâs what makes us all happy. We donât get that burnout.\n\nHow different was it to put out an album now, as opposed to the last one? All the press and social media stuff seems way more intense these days.\n\nYou can play that game, but you can also not play that game, and itâs fine. We put this record out ourselves, whereas with past records weâve had labels put it out who have expectations of breaking even or promoting their bands and their label. This time around, we did it ourselves with little or no expectations. We set the bar super low. [Laughs] We have an Instagram and a Facebook and all that stuffâI donât know why because we really donât update it. There is that peer pressure to have a little bit of band existence on the internet, but we choose to not really participate in that way. I donât like spending all my time on social media.\n\nI was reading an interview with Jenny and she said that when you bandmates found each other, it was ârare and beautiful.â What was that time like for you?\n\nIt was totally rare. It was special that we just got together and had the same musical taste and the chemistry worked and we were able to write songs really fast. Iâve definitely tried to play music with people who Iâve liked their style and it just doesnât work. When it works it really works, and when it doesnât itâs pretty obvious.\n\nItâs almost like kissing someone you like and realizing, Whoa, we arenât a kiss match.\n\nYeah, totally!\n\nIt seems like thatâs something people run into a lot when theyâre first starting to play music. Like, I want to start a band but I donât know how to find my people. Whatâs your advice for someone in that position?\n\nI would say go to shows and play, donât think about it too much. Go and play drums with your friend who plays bass and then try to put together a band. Things donât have to be perfect. Even if itâs not good, itâs fun. Itâs literally the funnest thing ever.\n\nHow did you meet Jenny and Ellie?\n\nMe and Jenny actually met through a music personal ad! It was in the â90s. It was in the Guardian weekly, [a newspaper] here that doesnât exist anymore. I placed an ad like, Drummer looking for blah-blah-blah, Iâm into Huggy Bear. Jenny loves Huggy Bear, so she answered my personal ad.\n\nThat is so cool! What was it like meeting that first time?\n\nIâm sure it was awkward and weird. I remember Jenny had all of this stuff recorded, and she gave me a tape, and then we went to my practice space and hung out for a while. We ended up really liking each other and it just worked.\n\nAnd whatâs the energy like now? What does it feel like to get together and play after being a band for so long?\n\nWe click into that special energy during our first song onstage. Iâm excited that all of us can do all of the other aspects in our lives and come back to this one thing thatâs been so constant year after year. Iâm totally jazzed that we can still write songs that all of us like and that weâre not compromising or doing some watered-down version, that weâre all still friends and playing music and that it still feels fun. Weâve all known each other for a long time now. Itâs like weâre all sisters; itâs family at this point.\n\nSo will you guys still be putting out records in your seventies?\n\nI hope so! Do you know the band Flaminâ Groovies? Theyâre all like old men now. I went to their show a couple weeks ago, and I was so inspired. They were playing these old songs that totally still held up, and they were having so much fun. I was like, You know what? I canât wait to be old and still be playing music. It was rad! They were shredding. ♦"
