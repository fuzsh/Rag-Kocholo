It is based on a true story of a middle school dance team. The film was directed by Ramón Menéndez.[2]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nAt Marshall Middle School, a cohort of Latina middle schoolers embarks on their educational journey with a passion for dance. Their aspirations intersect with the arrival of a biology instructor, Ms. Bartlett, a youthful new teacher. However, amidst their fervor for dance, the students struggle to maintain focus in their academic pursuits, prompting an announcement that the school's dance team would not be formed that year.\n\nUndeterred, the girls showcase their dance talents to Ms. Bartlett, only to receive the disappointing news of the team's cancellation. Witnessing their crestfallen spirits, Ms. Bartlett undergoes a transformation, assuming the role of coach to guide and support the girls in their dance endeavors. Determined to prove their readiness for competition and revive the dance festival, the girls, under Ms. Bartlett's mentorship, embark on a journey of self-discovery.\n\nGuided by the empowering mantra \"si se puede,\" the young Latina dancers navigate societal barriers through their collective artistry. Through perseverance and dedication, they transcend obstacles, reclaiming their agency and identity while revitalizing their dance troupe. Ms. Bartlett's mentorship becomes instrumental in not only honing their dance skills but also instilling confidence and resilience, empowering the girls to overcome adversities and shine on stage.[3]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nCamille Guaty as Daisy Salinas\n\nAmerica Ferrera as Yolanda \"Yoli\" Vargas\n\nJhoanna Flores as Alyssa Cortez\n\nSuilma Rodriguez as Marisol\n\nSabrina Wiener as Esmeralda Reyna\n\nMiguel Sandoval as Principal Zavala\n\nErik Alexander Gavica as \"Chuy\"\n\nSusan Egan as Heather Bartlett\n\nElizabeth Sung as Ms. Kim\n\nGina Gallego as Mrs. Cortez\n\nGerry Del Sol as Mr. Cortez\n\nValente Rodriguez as Mr. Reyna\n\nAnita Ortega as Mrs. Reyna\n\nYvonne Farrow as Lynell Elliott\n\nUlises Cuadra as Segura\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
