        "text": "The Macmillan Dictionary (American edition) says about cheers:\n\ncheers, interjection : (British informal) thank you\n\nIn the US, thanks is the nearest informal equivalent. If you say \"cheers\" in the US, people will think you're offering a toast.\n\nIn countries that use British English, \"cheers\" is fine in the informal situations that you mention.\n\nYou can reserve \"thank you\" for more formal situations.\n\nI think it varies a lot based on geography. In the US, \"cheers\" is rarely used to mean \"thanks\". In the UK, I can only really speak for my region (Midlands / Home counties), but we almost always say \"cheers\" as a laid-back replacement for \"thanks\". I'll say it the vast majority of the time instead.\n\nNative Brit here from East Anglia. I use 'Cheers' when someone (a stranger) has done something nice. Like letting you get on a bus first, or holding a door open. I don't think there are any rules. It's just something I appropriated from other people. I tend to use thank you when buying something, or when the situation is a bit more formal, or with friends / family. I reserve cheers solely for using on strangers. I'm not very consistent though, I tend to use either whenever I feel like it. So defiantly no rules. I'd be interested to see what others say though.\n\nI am a waiter in a restaurant. When I give a drink to an English guest, he thanks me by saying \"Thank you\" and my answer is \"Cheers\". Sometimes I get a reply \"cheers for that\". I'm using \"Cheers\" like a salute.\n\n'Cheers' certainly origininates as part of the casual social intercourse of drinking. It is the equivalent of 'good health'. It must have been around the 1970's that it first started apearing in this guise, as far as my memory goes.\n\nIts route into this part of colloquial English is unclear unless it came from the earlier 'Cheerio', which was used in lieu of 'farewell', and was certainly around during and probably before World War II.\n\nSo far as I'm aware, 'Cheers' as a colloquial farewell is rather more recent than the more usual meaning of 'thank you'.\n\nAs the other UK comments have said, it's treated as a slightly more informal way of saying 'thanks' or 'thank you'.\n\nGiven the tendency for Brits to be overly polite in certain situations, it comes in useful as a synonym: if you've already said thanks when being handed your drink, and when handing over the money, you'll need cheers when you get your change back. Not that I would ever do this, of course...\n\n\"Cheers!\" is often said just before having an alcoholic drink with someone else. It can also be accompanied by the people involved touching their drinking vessels together, like this or, just raising their vessels, like this."
