        "text": "Idioms. Native English speakers love using them in conversation, and youâll often find them popping up in books, TV shows and movies too. ToÂ perfect your English, you really need to become confident in using idioms and knowing the difference between breaking a leg and pulling someoneâs leg.\n\nHere are 20 English idioms that everyone should know:\n\n1. Under the weather\n\nWhat does it mean? To feel ill\n\nHow do you use it?Â In England we love to talk about the weather and will do so often, but donât be fooled by this common phrase. If someone says theyâre feeling under the weather, your response should be âI hope you feel better!â, not âWould you like to borrow my umbrella?â.\n\n2. The ball is in your court\n\nWhat does it mean? Itâs up to you\n\nHow do you use it?Â Itâs your move now, but this idiom refers to life rather than a sport. If youâve got the âball,â the decision is yours and someone is waiting for your decision.\n\n3. Spill the beans\n\nWhat does it mean? To give away a secret\n\nHow do you use it?Â If you told someone about their own surprise party, youâd have âspilled the beansâ or even âlet the cat out of the bagâ. The secret is out.\n\n4. Break a leg\n\nWhat does it mean? To wish someone luck\n\nHow do you use it?Â This idiom is not at all threatening. Often accompanied by a thumbs up, âBreak a leg! âis an encouraging cheer of good luck. It originates from when successful theater performers would to bow so many times after a show that they would break a leg.\n\n5. Pull someoneâs leg\n\nWhat does it mean? To play a practical joke\n\nHow do you use it?Â This is the perfect phrase to learn if youâre a fan of practical jokes. âPull their legâ is similar to âwind someone upâ. Use it in context: âRelax, Iâm just pulling your leg!â or âWait, are you pulling my leg?â.\n\n6. Sat on the fence\n\nWhat does it mean? To be undecided\n\nHow do you use it?Â If youâre sat on the fence, youâve not decided which side of an argument you agree with. âIâm on the fence about hot yoga classes,â translates as âIâm not sure whether I enjoy yoga in a sauna yet.â\n\n7. Through thick and thin\n\nWhat does it mean? To be loyal no matter what\n\nHow do you use it?Â Often used to describe families or BFFs, âthrough thick and thinâ means that youâre by each otherâs side no matter what happens, through the bad times, as well as the good.\n\n8. Once in a blue moon\n\nWhat does it mean? Rarely\n\nHow do you use it?Â This charming phrase is used to describe something that doesnât happen often. Example: âI remember to call my parents from my study abroad trip once in a blue moon.â\n\n9. Itâs the best thing since sliced bread\n\nWhat does it mean?Â Itâs really, really good\n\nHow do you use it?Â Sliced bread must have revolutionised life in England because itâs since been used as the ultimate benchmark for things that are great. We love it almost as much as tea.\n\n10. Take it with a pinch of salt\n\nWhat does it mean? Donât take it too seriously\n\nHow do you use it?Â âI heard that elephants can fly now, but Sam often makes up stories so I take everything he says with a pinch of salt.â\n\n11. Come rain or shine\n\nWhat does it mean?Â No matter what\n\nHow do you use it?Â You guarantee to do something, regardless of the weather or any other situation that might arise. âIâll be at your football game, come rain or shineâ.\n\n12. Go down in flames\n\nWhat does it mean?Â To fail spectacularly\n\nHow do you use it?Â This phrase is fairly obvious. âThat exam went down in flames, I should have learned my English idioms.â\n\n13. You can say that again\n\nWhat does it mean?Â Thatâs true\n\nHow do you use it?Â Generally exclaimed in agreement. When a friend says âRyan Reynolds is gorgeous!â, you can reply âYou can say that again!â\n\n14. See eye to eye\n\nWhat does it mean?Â To agree completely\n\nHow do you use it?Â Weâre not suggesting a staring contest â to see eye to eye with someone is to agree with the point theyâre making.\n\n15. Jump on the bandwagon\n\nWhat does it mean?Â Following a trend\n\nHow do you use it?Â When a person joins in with something popular or does something just because itâs cool. See this brunch-based example: âShe doesnât even like avocado on toast. Sheâs just jumping on the bandwagon.â\n\n16. As right as rain\n\nWhat does it mean? Perfect\n\nHow do you use it?Â Another weather-based idiom, but this one is slightly trickier. We moan about the rain, but âright as rainâ is actually a positive comment. âIâm as right as rain!â may be exclaimed with glee when asked if everything is okay, and it is.\n\n17. Beat around the bush\n\nWhat does it mean? Avoid saying something\n\nHow do you use it?Â Beating around the bush is when you speak nonsense, avoiding a question because you donât want to express your opinion or answer truthfully.\n\n18. Hit the sack\n\nWhat does it mean? Go to bed\n\nHow do you use it?Â This idiom is super easy to learn to use. âIâm exhausted, itâs time for me to hit the sack!â\n\n19. Miss the boat\n\nWhat does it mean? Itâs too late\n\nHow do you use it?Â Use this when you let an opportunity or deadline pass by. âI forgot to apply for that study abroad program, now Iâve missed the boat.â\n\n20. By the skin of your teeth\n\nWhat does it mean? Just barely"
