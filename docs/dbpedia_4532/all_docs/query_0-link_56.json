        "text": "Leo Reich strode onstage to the thudding beat of “Hot in It,” by Tiësto and Charli XCX. His batwing-lined eyes gleamed, and he was dressed in a contour-molding misbhv T-shirt and a pair of black short shorts whose white piping outlined his crotch. Grabbing a microphone stand and casting a mock-bashful look at the audience, he explained, “I didn’t have any time to change. I had to, like, run here straight from my dad’s worst nightmare.” It was a mild September evening at Earth Hackney, a venue in East London, and Reich was performing his standup comedy show, “Leo Reich: Literally Who Cares?!” Shiny black zip-up boots endowed his steps with a peppy bounce. “I’d just like to introduce myself, for those of you who don’t know me,” he said. “I’m Leo. I’m queer.” There were whoops from the audience, and Reich approached several people who, perilously, had seats in the front row. “Looking around, it seems like some of you guys”—he swept an arm in an arch gesture of inclusivity—“might also have a sexuality which is iconic.”\n\nReich, who is twenty-five, first performed the show at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, in the summer of 2022. (It was unfortunate, he observed, that the covid-19 pandemic hadn’t occurred back in “the olden days, when people were used to disease and had the emotional toolbox to deal with it.”) The Fringe is a proving ground for any aspiring British comedy performer or writer. Stephen Fry, John Oliver, and Richard Ayoade all performed there as members of the Cambridge Footlights, the university’s famed sketch-comedy troupe; Reich, who graduated from Cambridge four years ago, also belonged. “Leo Reich: Literally Who Cares?!” was hailed at the festival, and last year Reich took it to venues in the U.K. and then to New York City, where Nina Rosenstein, a veteran HBO executive who oversees late-night and specials programming, saw it at the Greenwich House Theatre. “It was so exciting to discover someone at such an early point in his career who is so polished, so self-assured onstage, and such a great writer,” she told me recently. The performance at Earth was at least Reich’s hundredth time doing the show, and it would also be his last: it was being taped for an HBO comedy special, which begins airing on December 16th.\n\nA precocious self-awareness fills the gap between Leo Reich the writer and Leo Reich the onstage character, who remains arrested at twenty-three—“which Forbes magazine recently described as one of the Top 25 youngest ages,” he notes in the show. In person, Reich is thoughtful and analytical; onstage, he is extravagant and unnerving, fully weaponizing his posh voice and good looks—high cheekbones, bee-stung lips. Near the outset, he announces that he’s about to undertake “a kind of rumination on twenty-first-century cynicism, on the self-objectification encouraged by social media, on the late-capitalistic co-option of the queer aesthetic—I’m kidding, can you imagine?” He then mimes blowing his brains out with a gun. Further ramping up the tone, the show incorporates musical numbers, from frenzied dance music to cheesy pop ballads, all delivered with aplomb by Reich, who has a powerful voice and a fearless onstage investment in his own charisma. (The music is composed by Toby Marlow, a friend of Reich’s from Cambridge, and one of the co-creators of “Six,” a musical about the lives of the six wives of Henry VIII, which became a hit in the West End and on Broadway after it débuted at the Edinburgh Fringe.)\n\nReich presents himself as a deliriously self-involved, fragmentarily informed, habitually self-pitying, comprehensively cynical member of Generation Z, the demographic cohort born between 1997 and 2012. To the extent that its members are depicted in popular culture and the mainstream media, it is usually by people significantly older than they are. (“Euphoria” is not written by teen-agers.) Reich’s act offers an authentic Gen Z voice, but he emphasizes that, for people like him who grew up with social media, authenticity itself has become impossible to pin down. One of the motifs of “Literally Who Cares?!” is an escalating series of bits in which Reich tries to commodify his “lived experience”: he starts with a memoir, then switches to a novel based on his memoir, and then to a rom-com based on the novelization of his memoir. Pretending to read from the novelized memoir, he tenderly recalls the first time he told someone “I’m queer”: “ ‘And, in that moment, he felt so much shame. Little did he know that, in just a few short years, he’d actually feel lucky to be queer—branding-wise.’ ”\n\nReich parodies the fragility of his generation, deliberately garbling its idioms of identity politics and self-care: he complains about being “put under this insane pressure to do the emotional labor of knowing stuff about things.” His character cycles manically through fashionably progressive and flimsily held political postures—“Vis-à-vis world hunger, I obviously think that there are amazing arguments on both sides”—and has an attention span so limited that he can’t even finish reading a whole tweet. Reich has described the show as “a brutal character assassination of myself.”\n\nOlder generations on both sides of the Atlantic may, in 2016, have started darkly joking about a glitch in the Matrix, but Gen Z has grown up almost entirely within that glitch—experiencing a climate crisis, an economic crisis, a global-health crisis, and a mental-health crisis arising from all the other crises. Objectively, none of this is very funny, but “Literally Who Cares?!” manages to skewer both the panicked self-absorption of the young while also offering an unsparing survey of the social, political, cultural, technological, environmental, and epidemiological conditions in which they have had the misfortune to come of age. As Reich says onstage, he imagined that “being in my early twenties would involve a lot more ‘navigating the dating scene in the big city!’ and a lot less Googling the words ‘death toll.’ ”\n\nReich makes a persuasive case that he and his peers are justified in feeling aggrieved, especially given the smug prosperity enjoyed by those parents to whose homes so many Gen Z-ers have been forced to retreat, by the pandemic or by broader economic circumstances. One of the show’s musical numbers is “Song for the Old,” a plangent Céline Dion-style ode to the generation of Reich’s parents and grandparents. It begins, “Tired and alone / Nowhere to call home / Unless you count the gorgeous nine-bed Georgian town house that you outright own,” and concludes with a reference to a coming apocalypse brought about by those homeowners’ shortsightedness. Complete with an emotive key change midway, the song is a joke, an earworm, and an indictment all at once. Lara Ricote, a Mexican American comedian who has toured with Reich, and who was also born in the late nineties, told me, “He’s describing how upsetting it is to be the person that he is now, given what we’ve been handed. But he knows that the best way to get that across is to be this level of cynical—to be apathetic about it. Like, ‘I couldn’t give a shit about how awful things are—ugh, we’re all going to die.’ Because to say ‘This is fucked up’—we’ve heard it already. But to push up to the anger through the apathy—that’s the smartest way to do it.”\n\nOne evening in October, I joined Reich at the Paddock, a monthly comedy showcase held in the performance room of the Bill Murray, a pub in the North London neighborhood of Islington. The Paddock event, which is overseen by Charlie Perkins, who was recently appointed head of comedy at the U.K. television network Channel 4, is not widely promoted: its audience is drawn from Britain’s comedy cognoscenti. The event has become a place for comedians to try out material from works in progress. Reich told me that the atmosphere might be less than uproarious, warning, “Sometimes it is filled with people who are just analyzing joke structure, and silently nodding.”\n\nThe room was small, dimly lit, and crowded, with folding chairs crammed together. Reich took a seat in the middle and advised me that he might applaud loudly or even whoop occasionally, in order to cheer on friends appearing on the evening’s bill. As it turned out, the atmosphere was lively enough that Reich didn’t need to make any interventions. A comedian named Ayoade Bamgboye delivered a deadpan lecture about Black History Month, which falls in October in the U.K. “Which Black person would you choose to save in the race war?” she asked a white woman in the audience, who—presumably from the depths of her unconscious, and to general astonishment—immediately replied “Idris Elba.” Bamgboye nodded sagely, and said, “That is the right answer.”\n\nSoon it was the turn of Emmeline Downie, who has been Reich’s best friend ever since they met, as aspiring comedians at Cambridge. Downie was reprising a character she first created as a student: Gail Summerfield, a would-be life coach partially modelled on Downie’s mother. The character’s advice was ridiculous—“Have you thought about taking the sheets out of a ready-meal lasagna? ’Cause then, voilà, you’ve got a good-to-go Bolognese sauce”—and Downie, conveying a desperate eagerness to please while wearing an auburn mom-bob wig, captured with excruciating precision the humiliation of being a middle-aged woman among a crowd of cool youngsters. Reich told me later, “We’re laughing at Gail’s naïve insanity not because she’s different from us and people we know but because she’s so deeply similar. It’s all from a place of identification and affection. You come away thinking, Wow, I would die for that made-up woman.”\n\nReich test-ran nearly all of “Literally Who Cares?!” at the Paddock series. The Bill Murray pub was also one of the venues where he first encountered live comedy. He grew up in Islington, a borough that is associated with left-leaning intelligentsia, the middle child of three in what he called “a liberal, metropolitan family that a critic might describe as ‘champagne socialist.’ ” His father is a film producer who worked on “Ex Machina” and “The Last King of Scotland”; his mother works in education. Reich discovered standup comedy on YouTube in his early teens, and persuaded his mom to accompany him to the now defunct Invisible Dot, in Kings Cross, which was a haunt for young comedians such as James Acaster, who has gone on to television and podcast fame in the U.K. “James would just improv for an hour, and there would be six people there, and two of them would be me and my mum,” Reich recalled. “I have a fundamental, cringe memory of him thinking my mum and I were a couple, and that being simultaneously humiliating and funny—and exhilarating, because I was part of the show. I was the joke in the show. I was, like, ‘This is so fun, to be embarrassed in this kind of public way.’ ”\n\nComedy didn’t come naturally to Reich. “I was really shy until I was about ten,” he told me. “No one was ever, like, ‘You’re so funny.’ ” He experienced social anxiety, and felt more comfortable with people older than him than with kids his own age. Comedy seemed like a good way to make friends, especially when he left elementary school to attend the City of London School, an élite private boys’ school where it was not especially easy to be a queer teen. “I was, like, ‘Well, this is a genius move, to be funny. It’s so charming,’ ” Reich said, adding, “It was a much more robotically studied move than a natural clowning impulse.”\n\nWhen Lena Dunham’s “Girls” débuted, on HBO in the U.S., in 2012, Reich downloaded it illegally, and found it strangely resonant: “It’s really weird to think in retrospect, because I was, like, this sort of queer thirteen-year-old who had truly not been kissed, but I was watching that show and thinking, Yeah, this is how my generation have sex.” Dunham’s creative originality lay in her ability to be both authentically immersed in her generation’s experiences while also maintaining enough distance to narrate them comically. Reich told me that “Girls” offered “a kind of dual, third-person perspective on your own life, whilst living it from a first-person perspective.” Another important influence on Reich was the British comedian Simon Amstell, whose 2009 standup show, “Do Nothing,” provided a model for mining comedy from the experience of being a young, gay, cripplingly self-conscious Jewish man. (Reich told me that his family is “secular but culturally Jewish.”) Amstell, who holds his body with an awkward discomfort and whose voice frequently ascends into a nervous squeak, explored the challenges of falling in love, and—harder still—being fallen in love with. “My type is me, but better,” Amstell says in “Do Nothing,” adding, “Which, I think, is O.K. I just need to find somebody who wants himself, but much, much worse.” Reich appreciated the way Amstell was “playing both ends of the spectrum of smart and stupid—he simultaneously makes himself out to be a guru and an idiot, often in the same sentence. He is able to genuinely connect both those things, and not use one as a setup to the other, but make those two elements of his personality reliant upon each other.”\n\nReich’s show incorporates lessons from both Dunham and Amstell: in “Literally Who Cares?!,” his character is both knowing and oblivious, smart and idiotic. Connoisseurs of joke structure will find themselves silently nodding at Reich’s expert use of misdirection, in which he sets up an expectation at the beginning of a riff, then abruptly undermines it. After speaking sadly of a schoolmate who tormented him by calling him a “pathetic gay,” he suddenly acknowledges that his antagonist wasn’t wrong—he was less a bully than a “mean oracle.” Reich also makes skillful use of the callback, in which a seemingly throwaway line is revisited and built on, sometimes multiple times. An upbeat reference to the pop-science observation that a forced smile triggers the same endorphins as a real one is reprised at the show’s conclusion with nihilistic vigor, within the context of the politics of oppression. Amstell, who has taken Reich on tour with him, told me, in an e-mail, “You have to be a really smart and sensitive comedian to play someone so specifically ridiculous,” adding, “I think there’s enough of who Leo actually is . . . that you really feel the humanity of the character.”\n\nReich went to Cambridge in the fall of 2016, having chosen the university principally on the strength of its comedy legacy, rather than for its superior academics. (He did stay engaged with his studies, though, writing a dissertation on the use of recipes in modernist literature. “I had a field day doing theoretical acrobatics,” he said. “It wasn’t very good.”) In his first year, he began appearing at student-run comedy shows. Toby Marlow, who was two years ahead of Reich, first saw him performing at such an event, with material that was very queer and self-knowing. “It was, like, ‘How has this person read my mind, and is making these hilarious jokes that are making me feel so seen, and are really relatable—and is also, like, ripping the shit out of me at the same time?’ ” Marlow told me.\n\nReich had first gone to the Edinburgh Fringe as an audience member in his early teens; as a student at Cambridge, he started to go as a performer, first appearing in group shows. One year, he took advantage of the fact that his parents were in the audience to come out to them onstage. “Loads of my standup, either in passing or explicitly, references my sexuality, and it seemed like a good way of letting them know without sitting anyone down and having an earnest conversation,” he said. “I decided, ‘I’m going to say it in a way that’s triumphant, and it makes loads of other people laugh.’ ” The revelation was hardly expected to come as a surprise. “They have met me,” he noted.\n\nIn addition to working on his solo comedy material, Reich began collaborating with Emmeline Downie, whom he met while waiting in line for a comedy audition. “The jokes he was doing then were very similar to what he does now—the quarter-life-ennui kind of stuff,” Downie told me. But back then there was no manufactured persona: “It was all presented in his own voice—the voice of him having a laugh with friends.” Reich and Downie were excited by American comics a decade or so older than them, including Kate Berlant, whose standup often consists of a meta-narrative about itself, and John Early, who generates ironic oppositions between cynical observations and accomplished cover versions of rock or pop classics. Reich and Downie co-wrote and performed in a two-person sketch show, “Manhunt,” which they ended up taking to the Edinburgh Fringe.\n\n“Manhunt” was about the challenges of finding a romantic partner in the age of dating apps and social media, with both Downie and Reich lamenting the absence of a boyfriend in their lives. Reich, who then had bleached-blond hair and nerdy glasses, deployed an affect of hopelessness that was not a million miles from that developed by Simon Amstell: “I just feel like when people meet me for the first time, y’know, that their first reaction isn’t, like, ‘Oh, gosh, what an attractive man, I must go on a date with him.’ It’s more sort of like ‘Oh, gosh, what a tall nine-year-old! I wonder why he’s crying?’ ” Reich and Downie transformed into a series of different characters, including members of a book group of upper-middle-class, middle-aged women, in which Reich’s character brayed disparagement of her flamboyant gay son; and a pair of Australian critics appraising men as art works rather than as people. In that bit, Reich sat on the lap of a hapless front-row ticket holder and announced, “It’s fleshy . . . it’s very realistic . . . and I think, personally, that it was a very interesting artistic decision to have given this one an erection.”\n\n“Manhunt” became a word-of-mouth hit with the mostly young audiences at the Fringe, and after graduating from Cambridge, in the summer of 2019, Reich hoped to return to some of the same generational themes with a follow-up solo show, which, at the time, he was crafting to conform to the typical parameters of the genre. “It was straightforwardly confessional, in the classic Edinburgh Fringe way,” he told me. “Weaving some kind of story from my own life into some kind of idea about the world at large, and making one a beautiful metaphor for the other, and coming to a very clear conclusion that is both smart and emotional.” He began testing sections of the show in front of audiences crammed into small theatres or the back rooms of pubs. “The arc was about an inability to be romantically intimate, and the epiphany was ‘You’ve got to open your heart to intimacy,’ ” Reich said, with evident distaste. “It wasn’t wholly unself-aware, but it was definitely making out like I had been, in some small way, structurally oppressed in my youth, and that’s what had led to all my problems.”\n\nIn 2020, larger problems presented themselves to Reich, along with the rest of the world, with the onset of the pandemic. The entire live-entertainment industry ground to a halt, with the result that the young comedians in Reich’s cohort were forced to retreat into their homes and adapt their work for online dissemination. That summer, Reich wrote, acted in, and shot a contribution to a comedy compilation that aired on Channel 4, in which he played two warring sides of himself: Reclusive Genius, in pajamas with a five-o’clock shadow, and Gorgeous Extrovert, with lavish eye makeup and bright-red lipstick. (The former: “I’m having an existential crisis.” The latter: “The only times he actually feels sad is when he’s watching a slow-moving comedy drama, and something mildly emotionally difficult happens to a character that directly resembles him.”) Reich had a family member who was immunocompromised, and he was diligent about following social-distancing rules during lockdown, spending long days writing in his childhood bedroom, back beneath the prized “Rushmore” poster of his teens. On Twitter, Reich uploaded videos like “Telling My Kids About My Wild 20s,” in which he gazed reflectively into the middle distance and said, with a world-weary chuckle, “You would not believe the things—the kind of crazy things—that we used to bake.”\n\nThe Edinburgh Fringe Festival was cancelled that year, so Reich took part in a substitute production, made for Comedy Central and filmed at Bush Hall, a venue in West London. Onstage, Reich was confronted not by the usual crowd primed with cocktails but by an enormous flat-screen monitor, which displayed thirty-odd homebound viewers in a checkerboard of Zoom squares. It was both a career high point and a depressingly compromised venture. During his set, some members of the Zoom audience visibly answered their phones, and others never offered so much as a smile, meaning that there was no chance of replicating the fizz of a live performance. “The excitement of doing something for Comedy Central that was filmed—I think—kind of overrode the feeling of total failure,” he told me. “I’m in the middle of a pandemic. I’m at rock bottom. And then I’m put through this.”\n\nSomething else was becoming clear: the show Reich had originally conceived was evolving in unexpected ways. He explained, “I got to the point where I lost patience with myself a bit, and started to feel cynical about that thing, which was so mid-two-thousand-tens: ‘Telling your story is really important, and everyone has a story to tell, and you should tell your story, and that’s actually quite an important political act.’ ” The show had never been a manifesto. “It wasn’t ‘Nanette,’ ” Reich said, referring to Hannah Gadsby’s breakout comedy hour, which led audiences down the path of laughter only to force them to confront the cruelty inherent in their enjoyment of the jokes. Nonetheless, Reich said, at the heart of his original intention had been “some kind of core belief that there was a level of importance, and self-importance, to what I was doing.” He went on, “For obvious reasons, in 2020 and 2021 it was suddenly very hard to buy into that at quite the same level.”\n\nThe forced pause in his live-performance career turned out to be a creative boon: by the time he was able to present his show at Edinburgh, in 2022, a productive gap had emerged between Leo Reich the comedy writer and Leo Reich the distracted, pained, dazzling character whose voice rises to a screech on the words “climate—ugh,” and whose musical numbers are delivered in frantic, fractured snatches. In “Literally Who Cares?!,” Reich repeatedly withholds from his audience the satisfaction of hearing a complete number, at least in the show’s initial stages; instead, he offers fragments of songs, into which he launches and then abruptly stops, saying, “We don’t have time!” Reich explained to me, “It’s just a really clear way of showing someone who can’t really commit to anything.”\n\nGiving an appearance of quicksilver spontaneity when, in fact, the material has been performed over and over is one of the most difficult aspects of the comedian’s art. Fortunately, Reich told me, “part of the reason why this character is so useful is that you don’t really have to commit to the pretense of ‘I just thought of this,’ because it’s all a pose.” After Reich introduced himself to the audience for his last-ever performance of “Literally Who Cares?!,” he quickly segued into what appeared to be an offhand apology for being distracted. He revealed, dolefully, that backstage in his dressing room he’d just been remembering about having done a forward roll while in elementary school, which would turn out to be “the last time I would ever do one.” Reich’s performative sorrow—a self-important mourning of the loss of childhood innocence, delivered by a glittery boy-man in tight shorts—was at once so silly and so full of pathos that it was easy to buy into the feigned immediacy.\n\nAs the show progressed, the jokes that had first been tried out on Twitter or in pubs were hitting exactly as Reich wanted them to, with the young people laughing in recognition at his generational indignation and the older people shuddering in recognition of their generation’s complicity. He marched up to audience members who were seated onstage, seeming to enlist someone in a moment of empathy before brutally withdrawing into his exclusive limelight. Behind him, a curved wall of L.E.D. lights vibrated with vivid pinks and purples—a look intended by Thomas Hardiman, the show’s director, to suggest the sugary, heavily ironized aesthetic of hyperpop artists like sophie, the late Scottish producer and singer, or PC Music, the London-based collective whose work, like Reich’s, blurs the distinction between satire and sincerity. By the end of the show—after all the foundationless political stances and the arrested songs and the iterated commodification of a life story that had barely had time to begin—Reich had, of course, returned to that very last forward roll he ever executed, this time incorporating it into a frankly terrifying musical number into which all the show’s earlier themes collapsed, along with the multiple unstable identities of Leo Reich.\n\nA few weeks after the recording, Reich told me, “Part of the feeling I am trying to express in the show is an inability to line up all my atomized beliefs in a row on specific issues and to say, ‘This coalesces into one coherent perspective.’ ” What he presents onstage, he went on, “is the stuff I fear and resent most in myself mixed in with the stuff that I feel is funniest and silliest about myself. The show has a fun, stupid, silly level and a callous, cynical, sad, scared level, and those things are inexorably linked.” Two things being true at the same time is the most obvious thing in the world, Reich observed. “But a hundred things are often true at the same time—a hundred deeply contradictory things. The fact that young people are annoying and sad—I mean, obviously. That’s one of the classic things about young people. Young people are petulant and entitled, and also aggrieved and justifiably angry.”\n\nSince his final performance, Reich had been in the edit room, watching himself deliver the same joke over and over, a process that itself added another layer to his accreted self-awareness. The process had reached picture lock: the sequence of shots had been selected, and the final edit was in sight. The show would not give viewers the narrative reassurance of a tidy, redemptive resolution. Instead, Reich hoped, it would offer the confounding experience of a contradiction in which more than one thing is true at once. “You shouldn’t be able to get to the end of the show concretely saying there’s any real takeaway,” Reich told me. “Apart from ‘Oh, God—he seems like he’s having a weird . . . year.’ ” ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the air date for the HBO comedy special."
