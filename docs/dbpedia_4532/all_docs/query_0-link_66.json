        "text": "Have you ever seen a Japanese reality show called Old Enough? Smash hit for decades that became a popular late-pandemic binge on Netflix here in the US. The gist is parents send their adorable toddlers out into the grown-up world to run a series of simple errands—pick up vegetables from the store, deliver a letter to a friend—and a camera crew tracks them from an extremely safe distance so we can watch what happens. It’s the best show ever made. Better than The Sopranos. The kids get distracted so easily, they make wrong turns, they stop to tell strangers about their friend who’s a frog. On average they complete two out of three errands.\n\nAtsuko Okatsuka, the stand-up comic, identifies with those kids so much that she made a spoof of it last year for the Netflix Is a Joke comedy festival in Los Angeles. In her version, Arsenio Hall sends her out onto the streets to return a friend’s notebook—“Oh, she needs that!”—and pick up her festival swag bag, and take a selfie with a famous celebrity. “It should be easy for a grown comedian,” says the Japanese narrator. It’s not. She manages to complete the first two tasks but the last one is too hard. She winds up snapping a photo with a tourist who looks like Timothée Chalamet.\n\n“I feel confident she’s friends with leprechauns,” says Tig Notaro, Atsuko’s close friend and fellow comic, who directed her breakout 2022 HBO special, The Intruder. “But she wouldn’t even realize she was talking to a leprechaun.”\n\nAtsuko is pronounced “ahtz-ko,” by the way, and her last name is pronounced “oh-cots-ka,” which is definitely not how you were pronouncing either of them in your head—don’t worry, she says, no one ever gets them right—so for simplicity’s sake everyone just calls her Atsuko. She’s been called Costco, she says, and that’s closer than most people get. On her second date with her husband of six years (actually, they’ve only just gotten married but we’ll get to that later), he asked how well he was pronouncing her name on a scale of one to ten. She gave him a two. His name is Ryan Harper Gray, and he’s an actor and painter who put all that on the back burner so they could focus on her blossoming stand-up career. Now, before she goes onstage, he’ll often approach the MC and tell them how to pronounce Atsuko, because he’s more particular about it than she is.\n\nAtsuko describes herself as a “ditz,” but this isn’t quite fair. It’s more like she often doesn’t seem entirely aware of her surroundings but is also blissfully unconcerned. “I say this with all the love in my heart: Atsuko’s living 10 seconds behind everything that’s happening around her,” says another friend, the comic D’Lo, who used to tour the country with her and Jenny Yang as a three-member crew called Disoriented Comedy. “So by the time she catches up to what’s happening, she’s like, ‘Oh. Okay.’ ” Atsuko does not dispute this.\n\nI first meet her outside an arcade-style building in a tranquil, artsy, shop-lined neighborhood just outside of Boston. She’s in town to open a few shows for Tina Fey and Amy Poehler’s Restless Leg tour, and she’s holding an unlit cigarette, which she’d like to smoke before we start the interview. She can’t find a lighter, though, and like one of those kids on Old Enough, she’s stumped. Not to worry. Gray, who serves as her producer, tour manager, social media video director, and body man in all senses of the term, is already on the case.\n\nAtsuko is the easiest person to spot in the greater Boston area. Her precise Vantablack bowl cut has become such a trademark that fans occasionally show up for her shows in tribute wigs. One time she called them up onstage. “Oh, my God,” she cried as they surrounded her. “Look at us, looking like the Beatles!” In a profession not known for its fashion sense, Atsuko dresses like an avant-garde style visionary who does most of her shopping on Etsy. She favors bright colors—reds, yellows, electric blues—and bold patterns that have no business matching yet somehow match perfectly. She loves big, dangly food-themed earrings, often made of actual food.\n\n“I should put my daughter Oona on the phone, who’s eight and wears her jewelry and is completely obsessed with Atsuko’s fashion,” says fellow comic Mike Birbiglia, who played a key role on her HBO special as an informal dramaturge. “I’m just gonna look on her site as a point of reference, but, like”—he begins to laugh—“oh, my God, the cheese snack earrings, um, the blood orange earrings, the Froot Loop set.” Today, she’s wearing cookies, and during our next conversation a few weeks later over Zoom, she’ll be wearing Life Savers. “It comes naturally to me,” Atsuko tells me. “It’s what I’m drawn to—colorful, you know, fun shapes. The things I wanted to wear as a kid, but I was too scared to stand out too much.”\n\nShe didn’t go full bowl cut until around 2017, which not so coincidentally is when she started finding her voice as a comic. She’s sure it has something to do with a stunted adolescence from what sounds like a nightmarish childhood, but she’s also not the type to process trauma through anger and dark eyeliner. She did go through those phases, onstage and off, but they never felt like her. This—bowl cut, cookie earrings, bright orange top she bought at a Taiwanese night market—is her. “If I’m gonna be me in the way I talk,” she says, “I’m gonna be me in the way I look too.”\n\nAll of her pals use the same word to describe both her and her comedy: silly. When I relay this to Atsuko, she ups the ante. “I would say dumb.” She knows she’s worked a bit to perfection when she thinks to herself, This is so dumb. She bounds onto the stage like Robin Williams and hurls herself around like the physical comedians she grew up watching—Lucille Ball, Charlie Chaplin—because silliness is a universal language. Then she’ll go stock-still, sounding borderline terrified (“like I’m crying”) as she drops punch line after punch line about subjects—divorce, mental illness, eating disorders, some light kidnapping—that should be harrowing, not hilarious. “It’s all the different interests that make me who I am,” she says. “Looking at me, you might not know that I can, you know, make my butt do things that you’ve seen in music videos, for example”—she was a cheerleader in high school—“or that I have rhythm. Or that I listen to pretty much solely dance hall music.”\n\nAtsuko went viral, and not for the first time, during the pandemic for a social media creation she dubbed the #DropChallenge, inspired by Beyoncé’s “Partition,” in which she stops, mid-conversation, or mid-chore, or mid-walking, to very suddenly and sexily drop it low. “It” being her butt. She also enjoys twerking, and her 89-year-old Taiwanese grandmother enjoys smacking her booty on camera while she does it.\n\nAtsuko’s trip to Boston is her second visit this year. She was here a few months ago working on material for her follow-up to The Intruder, a new hour of comedy called Full Grown, and she’ll be back this fall, filling the 1,200-seat Wilbur theater. It’s just one stop on her 60-city global tour, and she keeps adding shows because they keep selling out so fast.\n\nThe cigarette lighter is proving surprisingly hard to find. Does CVS sell lighters? They do. Her husband returns from down the block, mission accomplished. After she has her smoke on the street, he takes his leave so we can settle into a tiny cocktail bar at the back of the arcade named Barlette whose co-owner, an Atsuko superfan, opened early just for us.\n\nAfter her parents split, Atsuko stayed in Tokyo with her unraveling mother and her indomitable grandmother. Now, they were three Taiwanese women living in Japan—two and a half, anyway—a country not known for its warmth toward foreigners, and none of them spoke the language. Meanwhile, Atsuko’s mom was starting to get violent. She would scream. She’d throw plates. She never hurt Atsuko, but she came close, and it was terrifying for such a little girl, so Atsuko would stay quiet and try not to show emotion, because that would set off her mom.\n\nWhen Atsuko was eight, her mother put a knife to her wrist, and that’s when her grandmother decided the three of them needed to get out of Japan. They went on what she told Atsuko, and Atsuko’s father, would be a two-month vacation to Los Angeles to visit family. Two months turned into seven years. “And that,” Atsuko has joked, “is how you become undocumented immigrants.” It was only this past spring that Atsuko learned from her father that he’d had full legal custody of her. “It was a true kidnapping,” she tells me over lunch. “We’re all conflict avoiders in the family. That’s why we lie and do things like this.”\n\nOkay, now Atsuko, her mother, and her grandmother are in West LA, living in her uncle’s two-car garage, which he’d retrofitted into an apartment with a stove and an extremely illegal bathroom with a sink that fell off the wall during one of her mother’s tantrums. “The whole thing just came off. I was like, ‘Oh, Uncle Paul’s friend didn’t really secure that,’ ” she says, laughing. “But it was, like, you know, immigrants, right? It’s like, ‘I have a friend from church, he builds things, if you pay him in cash.’ It was like that.”\n\nAmerica was where her mother’s schizophrenia was finally diagnosed, and it was a daily nightmare, especially for her mother, but Atsuko joked during The Intruder that part of the stigma is because the word schizophrenia is so scary. She wishes it had “a more approachable name. You know? Something like ‘Splash Mountain.’ ” Believe it or not, her husband’s mother also has schizophrenia—sorry, Splash Mountain—and people have asked if this is why they got together, as though they met on a dating site, she’s said onstage, called YourMomToo.com.\n\nA few years after arriving in the States, owing to the stress and strain of her home life and assimilating into Los Angeles pre-adolescence, Atsuko developed an eating disorder, which wasn’t easy to disguise living in a garage with a Taiwanese grandmother. What brought her out of her shell, and her eating disorder, was joining the cheerleading team in high school. She’d finally found a community, though—“a family outside of my family”—because she loved to dance, and rump shaking is another universal language, and her teammates were shocked to discover that someone who looked like her could move her butt like that. If you’re picturing a team of Kirsten Dunsts à la Bring It On, stop. “They were Latinas and they were like, ‘If it weren’t for cheer we would’ve joined a gang.’ That was the type of girls that I hung out with,” she says. “But in retrospect they were too advanced for me with, like, street stuff. I mean, a couple of them were getting abortions and stuff, you know? And getting into fights at Denny’s.” Atsuko’s job was to hold their purses.\n\nThis is also when she first learned she was funny. Not with wordplay—her English was still a work in progress—but with well-timed one-liners and the kind of broad theatrical comedy she grew up with. She didn’t realize she was really funny, though, until she started dating her film professor in community college. She was 19, he was 31, and (she says) the relationship was quite toxic, but he’s the one who told her she should try stand-up comedy. That jerk changed her life.\n\nAtsuko is only the second Asian American woman ever to get her own HBO special—the ultimate prize in stand-up comedy. (The first was another good friend, Margaret Cho, back in 1994, when Atsuko was six and still living in Tokyo.) The Intruder is structured around an actual intruder who menaced her and Gray’s home in Silver Lake three times in one day—that was Birbiglia’s insight: three visits, three acts—but the title also refers to herself. “As an immigrant, as someone who’s formerly undocumented, and just being, you know, I’m kind of a weirdo, you feel like maybe you’re an intruder of spaces yourself,” she says. “I used to feel that way—that I was intruding on, you know, this country. I was intruding on this society. Like: I’m sorry I’m here, but I didn’t wanna be here anyway. That’s kind of my motto. But I have to feel like I belong to be able to say that. And I do feel like I belong now.”\n\nIt took another decade of performing, plus a detour to CalArts for not one but two graduate degrees, in film and creative writing, to become the Atsuko she is now. It also took a pandemic, which means it didn’t happen entirely onstage.\n\nIt’s possible that no comic in America has gone viral more often in the last five years—for happy reasons—than Atsuko Okatsuka. The first time was in 2019, when she took the stage at a comedy club moments before a massive 7.1 earthquake hit Southern California. You can see the room shake in the clip on YouTube. She performed right through it. “You know what it feels like,” she said, ad-libbing, “to come up dancing and then everyone’s like, ‘Stop it—you’re shaking the earth! Calm. Down.’ ” Earlier this year, she went viral again with an Instagram reel called “I had to get married a 2nd Time.” It turns out that she and Gray forgot to file the official paperwork the first time around, which they only discovered six years later, when she tried to get him on her health insurance. “This is my husband, Ryan,” she says in a white dress standing outside the county clerk’s office before their second marriage. “Or so I thought.” Along with their family history of schizophrenia, she tells me, this general ineptitude with daily life is why they do not plan to have children: “Like, we didn’t even know we weren’t married.”\n\nAtsuko tells me that she loves people—another thing stand-up comics don’t often say, but it speaks to what’s so rare about her persona. “I think there’s different approaches, ways you can approach comedy. One is anger and that’s funny to people too. But that’s not why I got into it. I don’t like for my comedy to live in that space of anger.”"
