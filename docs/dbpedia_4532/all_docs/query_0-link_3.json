        "text": "I agree with the other answers. It can also be an idiom use for giving encouragement to a problematic friend. \"Stand up and Cheer\" can mean the \"Don't just stay there and weep all day, go on with your life.\"\n\nWell unless it is like saying \"give a pat on the back\" or something not always literally, but a comment made of approval. Depends on context If said to an audience it would be literal, - as part of conversation - to imply that you think something is worthy of such action someone might say \"you deserve a medal\" they don't mean that you should actually get a medal - just that they are giving praise. 'stand up and cheer' is not one i have heard before though - maybe american? Hope this helps!"
