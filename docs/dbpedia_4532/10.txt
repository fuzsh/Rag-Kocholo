Rules are everywhere. And they’re even apparent when it comes to making a toast or saying cheers. However, these rules actually vary in different corners of the world due to contrasting beliefs and traditions. Just like how “cheers” is translated differently across oceans. On a separate note, do you think aliens also have their versions of “cheers” or “bottoms up?”

When it comes to clinking glasses (or maybe not, if clinking glasses aren’t a thing in your culture), you know that there are these happy and togetherness feelings that come with it. Maybe that’s because the act of toasting and the saying of “cheers” are done with friends and loved ones at a celebratory event. Or maybe that’s because you know that raising a glass is just a precursor to something fun. So your brain pops an excited ahh instead of a dispirited blah. From there, you lift your glass high and wish people around you good wishes. Then, you take a sip because that’s just what you do after. But now, the question is: do you know how to propose a toast in different languages? Read on and learn how!
