American Prankster: Wavy Gravy's Life Story pairs the legendary entertainer and activist with our friend, podcaster Rainbow Valentine, following the incredible ride of a life that Wavy Gravy has been on through decades of American counterculture.

Joan would become Bob Fosse's second wife and a major influence in his career. Given how brief her life was - she died at just 43 - her story is an impressive array of spiderwebs into both the Trashy Divorces Cinematic Universe, and Alicia's Done & Dunne podcast.

Their romance may not have been long lasting, but it left carnage in its wake even as Diana's star rose higher and higher.

American born, Natalie's story is fascinating on many levels, not least because of her constant intersections with and contributions to the makers of the culture in which we live - artists and writers like Collette, Romaine Brooks, Renee Vivien, Djuana Barnes, Radclyffe Hall, Janet Flanner, Solita Solano, Mina Loy, Una Troubridge, and Elisabeth de Gramont, to name just a few.

Friends, we don't know where to begin with the trashiness that is Clint Eastwood, so we opted to focus mostly on his tumultuous relationship with fellow actor Sondra Locke. This one has everything - an almost pathological level of infidelity, indiscriminate fatherhood, unconventional marriages, and profound betrayals.

Kelsey Grammer, best known for playing the cerebral and neurotic Dr. Frasier Crane for two decades on NBC, is quite the contrast to his lovable character. A childhood and young adulthood marked by unimaginable tragedies may be the key to why this uber-successful actor's personal life has veered from crisis to crisis.
