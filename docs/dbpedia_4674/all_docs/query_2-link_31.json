        "text": "Harry Belafonte made a host of trailblazing achievements in the arts and society.\n\nFrom being the first Black American to win an Emmy to using his voice and his wallet to finance social justice, Belafonte dedicated himself to the improvement of his people and humanity across the globe.\n\nAffectionately known as the \"King of Calypso,\" Belafonte was born in Harlem, New York, to Caribbean parents. His mother was set on him getting an education but Belafonte found school to be difficult due to dyslexia. At 17 years old, he decided to drop out of high school and joined the Navy. When he returned home, he became a janitor’s assistant. While on the job, he was given theater tickets as a tip. This was his first introduction to theater and that night he found his true calling.\n\nHis first film role was in “Bright Road,” which debuted in 1953. He co-starred alongside Dorothy Dandridge. The two then starred in Otto Preminger's hit musical, “Carmen Jones” in 1954.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Belafonte appeared in more films, including two with Sidney Poitier - “Buck and the Preacher,” which debuted in 1972 and “Uptown Saturday Night,” which made its debut in 1974. Belafonte’s film career continued well into the 80s and 90s with “Beat Street,” “White Man's Burden,” “Kansas City,” and more.\n\nHis breakthrough album “Calypso,” in 1957, introduced American audiences to Calypso music and became the first album in history to sell over one million copies within a year of release. Belafonte was the first Black American man to receive an Emmy Award, with his first solo TV special \"Tonight with Belafonte.\"\n\nWhile primarily known for Calypso, Belafonte recorded in many different genres, including blues and jazz. He would go on to produce the Grammy-winning single “We Are the World,” which raised consciousness and money around famine relief, selling more than 20 million copies.\n\nBelafonte focused on the important issues of racism, poverty and oppression, not only among the African American community, but also around the world.\n\nBelafonte was instrumental in the Civil Rights Movement, serving as one of Martin Luther King Jr.’s most trusted confidants.\n\nHarry Belafonte, King and Abernathy\n\nJohnson Publishing Company Archive.
