        "text": "Our family memberships provide full privileges to children until they are 23, which means they feel just as at home at Griffin Club as you do. Have little ones aged 6 months to 6 years? Our Kids Korner will take good care of them while you workout, enjoy a game of pickleball, or have a date night at Palomar. Kids Fun Zone provides entertainment for kids aged 5-12, with sports, games, and more. Younger kids love our summer camps, tennis camps, and specially-designed enrichment programs, while teens can enjoy a sense of belonging and personal growth on the tennis court or in the gym\n\nGriffin Club’s fabled story begins with Elmer Griffin. In 1926, Griffin opened the Westside Tennis Club, as a club for actors and entertainers who were shunned by the elite clubs of the time. The Club became a special gathering place for some of Hollywood’s most famous actors of the time, including Humphrey Bogart, Errol Flynn, Caesar Romero and Joan Bennett. Over the last 90 years, the Club has changed names a number of times, but has never lost its inherent appeal to the residents of Los Angeles.\n\nGriffin Club Los Angeles is a private club. All guests must be accompanied by a member or participating in a scheduled event at the Club. The Club is located at 3084 Motor Avenue. During special events, valet parking is provided at the main entrance. The Club’s parking lot is located in the rear of the property along Patricia Avenue. Please respect our neighbors by never parking in front of residential homes in the surrounding neighborhood. To contact the Club with questions, please call (310) 836-4400.\n\nPalomar and Cub Event Attire:\n\nWe appreciate our members (adults and children alike) wearing tasteful attire in the clubhouse. When enjoying the Palomar and club event spaces, we ask you to wear shoes or sandals, and to avoid sleeveless tees and men’s tank tops. Some events may have specific dress codes.\n\nFitness and Racquet Attire:\n\nOur members wear appropriate tennis attire, including shirts and non-marking shoes, when on the courts. We ask that men do not wear sleeveless shirts on the court. Jeans, cut-offs, undershirts, sandals and bare feet are not permitted in fitness areas or on the court."
