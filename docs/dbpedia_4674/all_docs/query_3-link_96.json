The first being a golden-haired porcelain doll usually playing the innocent ingénue, the second as the sensuous brunette femme fatale and finally as a warmhearted wife and mother figure. Later in her career, she again came to prominence when she stared in the TV vampire soap opera “Dark Shadows.” Due to a gun shooting incident of her agent, she was virtually blacklisted, blaming her for the scandal. Humphrey Bogart, who stars in the film pleaded with the studio to keep her in the comedic film which is about three escaped prisoner who get involved in the lives of the local shop keepers of a French colonial town. The movie would turn out to be the last film she would act in.\n\nMary Grant began her career as a Broadway costumer designer, but when she went to Hollywood she met and married actor Vincent Price and remained. Unusual for a woman costume designer, she preferred dressing men in a heightened contemporary reality.\n\nCollection\n\nFilm Costumes\n\nCitation\n\n“Joan Bennett as Amelie Ducotel in 'We're No Angels' Designed by Mary Grant,” Film Costume Collection, accessed August 28, 2024, https://filmcostumecollection.omeka.net/items/show/1278.\n\nItem Relations\n\nItem: Images of Joan Bennett in 'We're No Angels' Still images from film This Item"
