        "text": "“Every problem, it seems to me, is more difficult to meet when it must be met in a glass house.”\n\nJoan Bennett, The Bennett Playbill\n\nJoan Bennett and Walter Wanger\n\nLobby Card for \"The Woman in the Window\" (1944)\n\nJoan Bennett was one of the most successful actresses of Hollywood's Golden Age. She rivaled Gloria Grahame as the queen of Film Noir, cast by Fritz Lang as his femme fatale in The Woman in the Window (1944) and Scarlet Street (1945). Unfortunately, her career was derailed by scandal in 1951. Her husband, the producer Walter Wanger, suspected she was having an affair with her agent, Jennings Lang, so he shot him. It became a notorious Hollywood scandal, and her career never recovered. His did. Even with his greater culpability, Wanger served a nominal jail sentence and returned to producing hit films.\n\nIs this an example 1950s-era chauvinism? Probably. It also mattered on which direction of the camera Mr. and Mrs. Wanger found themselves. Image was then (and now) of utmost importance to that magical elixir that transforms an actor or actress into box office gold. Yet, it does not seem fair that though Bennett and Wanger were living in the same home, only hers was made of glass.\n\nThe copy of The Bennett Playbill that Joan Bennett signed to her The Woman in the Window director, Fritz Lang, is available via James Pepper Rare Books, Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\"The Bennett Playbill\" Signed to Director Fritz Lang\n\n\"The Bennett Playbill\""
