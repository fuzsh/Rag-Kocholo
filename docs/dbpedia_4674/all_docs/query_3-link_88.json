        "text": "Newswise — Joan W. Bennett, a Distinguished Professor of plant biology and pathology at Rutgers University–New Brunswick, has been elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. She joins neurosurgeon and CNN medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta, NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center atmospheric scientist Ann Thompson and media entrepreneur and philanthropist Oprah Winfrey.\n\n“Receiving this honor would not have been possible without the support of my mentors, professional peers and, most especially, the many wonderful students who have worked in my laboratory over the years,” said Bennett, who works in the Department of Plant Biology in the School of Environmental and Biological Sciences. “Moreover, it gives me particular pride to see that this year, 55 percent of the people elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences are women.”\n\nBennett and 251 other new members were recognized for helping to solve the world’s most urgent challenges, creating meaning through art and contributing to the common good from every field, discipline and profession. The academy was established in 1780 by John Adams, John Hancock and others who believed the new republic should honor exceptionally accomplished individuals and engage them in advancing the public good. The academy’s dual mission remains essentially the same today with members from increasingly diverse fields working together to share ideas and recommendations in the arts, democracy, education, global affairs and science, according to an academy statement.\n\nBennett joined Rutgers in 2006 after serving on the faculty at Tulane University for more than 30 years. Her laboratory studies the genetics and physiology of filamentous (thread-like) fungi. In addition to mycotoxins (natural toxins produced by some fungi) and other secondary metabolites, her research focuses on the volatile organic compounds emitted by fungi."
