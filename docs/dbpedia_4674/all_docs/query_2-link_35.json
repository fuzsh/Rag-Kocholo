        "text": "I love kids, love having them around and, in fact, have two of my own. There are, however, places I do not want to see children.\n\nI don't want to see them operating heavy construction equipment. I don't want to see them bellying up to the bar in a local tavern and I don't, with few exceptions, want to see them in movies.\n\nI've always had a problem with juvenile stars. Perpetually over-emotive and usually irritatingly precocious, child actors usually don't have the emotional maturity or artistic depth to hold their own on the big screen. Sure, there's a certain appeal to seeing Shirley Temple rock out Good Ship Lollipop, but it was her dimples and curls that sold her as a performer, not talent.\n\nOf course, it's unrealistic to believe that movies can be made without the participation of children. It's one thing to have a 25-year-old playing a teen, but having the same actor step into the shoes of the tweener younger sibling is just silly.\n\nFortunately, there have been young actors who have the right stuff. Augusta's own Laurence (then Larry) Fishburne was just 14 when he signed on with Francis Ford Coppola's good ship Apocalypse Now and Anna Paquin was even younger when she accepted her demanding role in The Piano. Below are a few of my favorite child performances that don't make me cringe, cry or wonder why there are no lifeboats to be found on the Good Ship Lollipop.\n\nNATIONAL VELVET (1944): One of Elizabeth Taylor's first films, she stars as Velvet Brown, a horse-happy young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to ride in the prestigious Grand National. A family film that could have easily slipped into hard-to-digest saccharine sweetness, it remains surprisingly compelling and Ms. Taylor's performance is a major component.\n\nTHE SIXTH SENSE (1999): I just watched this movie again for the first time since its initial release and was struck by two things. The first is how tightly wound the screenplay is, and the second is how much of the movie's success sits on the small shoulders of Haley Joel Osment. He's in every scene and, being the only character in the film that can see the dead, is solely responsible for communicating the film's essential sense of dread. An impressive performance.\n\nTAXI DRIVER (1976): Although only 14, Jodie Foster, by then a seasoned show biz pro, was able to play Iris, a damaged teen prostitute who's seen too much with real authority. A portrayal full of false bravado and pent-up insecurity, it's a great performance, child or otherwise.\n\nCONFIRM OR DENY (1941): Roddy McDowall got his start playing juvenile roles in a variety of classic Hollywood films. The most famous may be How Green Was My Valley, but I've always preferred this romantic drama about an American newspaper man (Don Ameche) who breaks the biggest story of his life just as he finds true love (with Joan Bennett). McDowall plays a young man dealing with coming of age during the London Blitz.\n\nTEMPEST (1982): Molly Ringwald will be remembered for the teen comedies she made with director John Hughes, but before joining his famous Brat Pack, she starred in the art house adaptation of the Shakespeare play The Tempest. A movie that depends both on traditional narrative and a certain measure of improvisation, it also stars Susan Sarandon, John Cassavetes and Raul Julia."
