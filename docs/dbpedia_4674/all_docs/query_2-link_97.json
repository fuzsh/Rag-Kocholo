        "text": "Danielle Dobin writes:\n\nThe other day I received a panicked text from a dear friend, who was on her iPad on Metro-North.\n\nShe had rushed onto a train to New York after hearing that her son was hospitalized with a life-threatening allergic reaction. In her rush, she dropped her iPhone somewhere at the Saugatuck station.\n\nI was in Norwalk, but immediately headed back to collect the phone.\n\nI called it, in case a Good Samaritan was nearby.\n\nA man answered. His name was Ken. He asked if I’d left my phone at the station.\n\nI explained the situation. While I stayed on, Ken walked across the street and asked if someone at Harvest could hold the phone for me.\n\nJohnny, the manager at Harvest, joined the call and assured me he’d keep the phone safe. Here’s a photo of Johnny with the phone, which he indeed kept safe.\n\nMy friend was never able to properly thank Ken for his help, as I did not get his last name. I hope he reads “06880.”\n\nWe are both so appreciative of how Ken and Johnny stepped up to help, during a very stressful situation. Having her phone lost or stolen would have made a challenging day far worse.\n\n(Unsung Hero is a weekly “06880” feature. To nominate a hero, email 06880blog@gmail.com.

Thank you!)\n\nThe Citizens’ Police Academy is one of the best — and most unpublicized, and underrated — programs in town.\n\n25 Westport residents participate in classes that cover many aspects of law enforcement.\n\nThey learn about specialized units in the Westport Police Department, as well as how it operates and its role in the criminal justice system.\n\nParticipants observe demonstrations, and get hands-on experience with equipment the police use every day.\n\nInstructors include experienced officers, and attorneys from Stamford Court.\n\nIn addition to classes, students experience a ride-along with a patrol officer.\n\nThey also receive Stop the Bleed training.\n\nThe next Westport Citizens’ Police Academy begins September 19. Classes run from 7 to 9:30 p.m. for 8 weeks, on select Tuesdays and Thursdays (September 19 and 26; October 1, 10, 17, 24, and November 7 and 14).\n\nThe academy is open to Westport residents 21 and older. Applications are available at police headquarters or by email from Officer Jill Cabana (jcabana@westportct.gov), and are due by August 27.\n\nResidents can learn about this vehicle — and many other aspects of policing — at the upcoming Citizens’ Academy.

Big Y is also hiring cashiers, overnight stock clerks, and managers and assistant managers.\n\nFor more information, click here.\n\n==================================================\n\nStaples High School Class of 1971 graduate Jon Diamond writes:\n\nI was at Compo Beach the other day, and there it was: the Good Humor Truck.\n\nIt looked exactly like it did when I was 10 years old. (I think then we flagged it down at Burying Hill Beach.).\n\nI learned that the Good Humor “man” is a woman. Kathryn has been doing this for 25 years, throughout Fairfield County.\n\nThe truck is an original — circa 1968 — and still running strong.\n\nAs I stopped to talk to Kathryn, other 70-somethings did too. We were all dazzled.\n\nKathryn, the Good Humor woman. (Photo/Jon Diamond)\n\n==================================================\n\nSpeaking of Compo Beach: The extended Mickune family was there yesterday, celebrating patriarch Derm Mickune’s 90th birthday.\n\nHis sons and daughters came from as far as Arizona, for the birthday, bringing spouses and grandkids too.\n\nThe Mickune “kids” were well known during their time at Staples High School. They enjoyed their time back in their hometown.\n\nAnd their dad was — as you can see below — all smiles.\n\nDerm Mickune (Photo/Dan Woog)\n\n=================================================\n\nThe demise of WCBS 880 AM took Westporters by surprise.\n\nNew York’s all-news station will end its programming this month. It went on the air nearly 6 decades ago: August 28, 1967.\n\nIt will be renamed the very unmemorable WHSQ says its owner, the oddly named Audacy.\n\nThe Philadelphia company owns more than 230 radio stations in the US, including WFAN and WINS in New York.\n\nThe new station will launch as sports radio ESPN — joining WFAN in that space.\n\nWINS, meanwhile, becomes the only all-news station in the market.\n\nThis being Westport, we’re sure there are readers who have a connection to WCBS NewsRadio 88. If you’ve worked with or for it — or have a memorable story to tell, as a listener — click “Comments” below.\n\n==================================================\n\nIn 2023, “06880” introduced Jay Babina to the world.\n\nThe Westporter is the founder, curator and mastermind of the Westport Tech Museum — an astonishing repository for over 400 computers, video games, calculators, cameras, radios and more.\n\nMuch more.\n\nIt’s a spectacular museum.\n\nIt’s private, though: in Jay’s attic.\n\nAnd he’s only 18 years old.\n\nThis spring, we visited him again.\n\nNow WSHU has joined the Jay Babina fan club.\n\nYesterday, the NPR station aired a feature on one of Westport’s most interesting teenagers.\n\nOr most interesting residents of any age, period. Click here to listen.\n\n(PS: NPR posted it on their national Facebook page. And at least for a while, Jay’s story was on the home page of the national network’s website. Very cool — and very well deserved.)\n\nJay Babina channels Steve Jobs, with Apple’s groundbreaking Macintosh.\n\n=================================================\n\nThis summer we’ve seen — among other animals — bears and coyotes on the roads and in the woods of Westport.\n\n(Spotted lanternflies too. But let’s not go there.)\n\nNow there is at least one pig. And a bison.\n\n(Photo/Mary Lou Roels)\n\nAt least they’re confined to the Furniture on Consignment II store on Post Road East.\n\nPerhaps they eat lanternflies?\n\n==================================================\n\nTickets for the Woodside Bash — the great Earthplace fundraiser (Saturday, October 5, 7 to 10 p.m.) featuring great food, live music and a woodsy fall evening — are available now, at a special price.\n\nThey’re $100 each through Labor Day. They’re $125 from then on. Click here to purchase.\n\nThe fun continues the next day (Sunday, October 6, 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.), with the annual Fall Festival. The family fun includes food trucks, a climbing wall, corn pool, apple slingshot, donut on a string, nature exploration, animal encounters and more. Click here for tickets.\n\nOutdoor fun, at the Woodside Bash.\n\n==================================================\n\nIt’s still mid-August. But it’s already pumpkin time.\n\nAt least, pumpkin blossom time.\n\nMatt Murray spotted the flower yesterday, on Compo Road South. It’s our first fall-themed “Westport … Naturally” photo of the year.\n\nYikes!\n\n(Photo/Matt Murray)\n\n==================================================\n\nAnd finally … in honor of the first pumpkin (blossom) of the season (story above):\n\n(WCBS is signing off.

Thank you!)\n\nBack in 2017, “06880” published a story headlined “Mitch & Lisa 4Ever.”\n\nIt noted that back in the day, the Parent Child Center on Hillspoint Road was Hillspoint Elementary School.\n\nChildren’s Community Development Center director Eileen Ward had just found a decades-old love note, scrawled on an art room closet metal plate:\n\nWho, “06880” wondered, were Mitch and Lisa?\n\nAnd did their love really endure, 4ever?\n\nSeven years later, we know.\n\nThe other day, I received this email: “Earlier today, my brother Phil and I were reminiscing about our childhood in Westport. We got on the subject of the wonderful field trips we had at Hillspoint Elementary.\n\n“Somehow, someway, as I searched Hillspoint Elementary school and our names, I stumbled upon your post. I considered adding a comment to the original story, then thought it best to email you directly.\n\n“I am Mitch Freshour, co-author of the clandestine graffiti, along with Lisa Rafter.\n\n“We were childhood sweethearts, and I have fond memories of those young days. I can’t recall the exact year, but we would’ve been in 5th or 6th grade, around 1973 or ’74.\n\nHillspoint Elementary School (Photo copyright/Paul Ehrismann)\n\n“We were cast members in a play, and I remember there being a couple of large refrigerator sized cardboard boxes. During down times between rehearsing and building sets, a few of the ‘couples’ would gather backstage and take turns going into the boxes together to sneak a kiss!\n\n“I’m guessing it was probably during this period that we wrote on the cover.\n\n“I lived at 4 Turtleback Lane, and Lisa lived directly behind our house at 5 Peaceful Lane. One of several enduring memories of that time was hanging out in her basement in the afternoon with the lights out, listening to a Beach Boys LP.\n\n“My family moved to Ohio before I could finish my first year at Long Lots Junior High, so unfortunately I lost track of Lisa. However, I’m 99% sure I found her on Facebook, living in Colorado with her husband and family.”\n\nMitch is still in Ohio. He’s retired, after a 25-year career as a mechanical career with with Honda Research & Development.\n\nHe plans to reached out to Lisa. “It was sooo long ago,” he notes.\n\nHe also wonders what became of the wall plate.\n\nLet’s hope we won’t wait 7 more years for that answer.\n\n(Where else but “06880” could you read this story?

It will provide hiking opportunities, and connect with other greenway and open spaces owned by the Wilton Land Trust, Norwalk River Valley Trail, and The Nature Conservancy.\n\n================================================\n\nTwo new members have joined the Friends of the Westport Center for Senior Activities board.\n\nWestport native Prill Boyle is a summa cum laude graduate of Georgetown. She recently retired after many years of teaching English, but continues to tutor at the Mercy Learning Center. After publishing her book “Defying Gravity: A Celebration of Late-Blooming Women” in 2004, she spoke across the country including the United Nations) about finding passion and purpose at any age, Prill is a grandmother of 4, a fitness enthusiast and a fledgling painter.\n\nDublin, Ireland native Anne Banks has lived in Westport since 2001. She came to the US to lead the international marketing team of a European investment manager, but in 2006 took a leap of faith and became an independent marketing consultant to the industry. When she retired in 2022, she upped her volunteering for Homes with Hope and started volunteering twice a week at the Senior Center. She exerciser daily at the Westport Weston Family YMCA.\n\nPrill Boyle (left) and Anne Banks.\n\n================================================\n\nThis Thursday (August 15, 5:30 p.m., Paul Lane Field), the Staples High School football team will run “the Murph.” The public is invited.\n\nThe annual exercise — honoring fallen Navy SEAL Michael Murphy — culminates the Wreckers’ fundraising effort. 50% of what they raise goes to their program; the other 50% supports the Catch a Lift Fund, which helps post-9/11 wounded veterans rehabilitate physically and mentally.\n\nEvery year, a Catch a Lift veteran speaks to the team — and spectators in the stands — before the workout.\n\nThis year’s guest is Jason Smith. The retired Army sergeant lost both legs, and suffered extensive damage to his right hand, when he stepped on an IED in Afghanistan.\n\nThree months before retiring he met the woman who became his wife. They now have 2 children.\n\nSgt. Smith earned 8 gold medals at the 202 Invictus Games in Germany. The event uses sports as a tool for competitor recovery and rehabilitation.\n\nClick here for a video from the ESPY awards, honoring Sgt. Smith and other heroic veterans.\n\n==================================================\n\nSpeaking of sports: Congratulations to the CT Wolfpack 12U baseball team!\n\nThe club — based at The Batting Cage in Fairfield, with a couple of Westport stars — won the Cooperstown Dream Park Tournament of Champions this past weekend.\n\nWolfpack earned the #1 seed (out of 104 teams from around the country) by winning all their pool play games, and having the best run differential in them.\n\nThe 06880 connection come via 2 of the best players: Brooks Podolec and Jack Jaramillo.\n\nBrooks led the team with 11 home runs during the tourney (along with stellar pitching), while Jack patrolled centerfield, pitched, hit leadoff and added 3 homers of his own.\n\nMeanwhile, Weston’s Ryan Schnider won the King of Swat trophy, as homerun derby champ.\n\nAfter winning 3 games Sunday, Wolfpack qualified for the championship against a team from California. It was scheduled to start at 9:15 p.m. Sunday — yep, 4 games in one day! — but was delayed due to weather.\n\nWolfpack were down most of the game. But thanks in large part to a late 3-run, game-tying homer from Ryan, the boys won 8-7 in walk-off fashion — around midnight.\n\nIt was a great showing in Cooperstown.\n\nWho knows? Decades from now, one or two of our guys might be enshrined there.

Thank you!)\n\nThe youth-industrial sports complex roars on, sucking up everything in its path.\n\nDo any kids know how to create their own fun these days?\n\nGrant Theisinger does.\n\nGrant Theisinger\n\nIn 2 weeks, he’ll be a Staples High School freshman. He’s also a Wiffle ball fanatic. His friends love the game too.\n\nTwo summers ago Grant, and Harlan and Hayes Bauer, decided to develop a league, with organized teams.\n\nThat was fun. But they wanted more.\n\nLast year, they took it to the next level. Grant saved up money from holidays and birthdays. He bought bases, a pitching mound and home plate turf.\n\n2023 players.\n\nThey followed Major League Wiffleball regulations for length and width of the field.\n\nThe boys made foul posts out of PVC pipes. Grant’s mom Kristy painted lines. She and his dad Marc installed a chain link fence in their yard — a major upgrade from the previous plastic fence.\n\nGrant and the Bauers enlisted 5 other captains. Each drafted a team. Captains were responsible for finding subs whenever players had conflicts.\n\nNagly’s Nuggets. Their name and shirts were inspired by one boy’s grandmother.\n\nTheir 3-page document of rules includes being respectful to each other, keeping the grounds clean, and more.\n\nSome teams made jerseys. Some wore eye black. Some brought family members, dressed up as mascots.\n\nGames are played in blazing sun, chilly temperatures, and during rain.\n\nSome of the 2024 players.\n\nOver the past 2 seasons, they’ve played more than 200 games. There was a home run derby, All-American game, playoffs and World Series.\n\nGrant kept track of stats. Trophies were awarded at the World Series, in a formal ceremony.\n\n“High Heat” brings the heat. From left: Justin, Grant, Nolan, Dylan.\n\nParental involvement was minimal. Marc and Kristy welcomed all the boys each game, whether they were there to play or watch.\n\nThe yard was filled with 20 to 40 youngsters each time. They ate hot dogs and hamburgers, and snacks sent by players’ parents.\n\nSignage posted around the Cavalry Road neighborhood on game days encouraged spectators to come, grab some food and watch the action.\n\nIt’s not a game without burgers and dogs.\n\nIt was (almost) like the big leagues. Madison Furniture Barn sponsored the boys, and sent banners to hang on the fence.\n\nAnderson Septic Service provided bats and balls. Owner Brian Anderson played a few innings, and learned pitches from Grant.\n\nOfficial sign, courtesy of Anderson Septic.\n\nAt the end of the season the parents donated two 8-foot benches for the sidelines. from Westport Woodworks.\n\n“Official” benches\n\nBut make no mistake: This was the kids’ league.\n\nThere was no parent coaching. The boys learned as the league evolved. They made changes when they had to.\n\nOpening day: the national anthem.\n\nAlways, they kept their eye on the prize: Having fun.\n\nAnd of course, winning the World Series.\n\n2024 champs: Cameron, Finn (on phone), Ian, Dean and Grady.\n\nIndependence, camaraderie, decision-making, managing their own schedules — and all without any adult telling them what they “should” do: It sounds like Grant Theisinger are already champions.\n\nEXTRA INNINGS: This weekend, Grant takes his love for the game to another level. He’ll represent Westport at the MLW Long Island Wiffs Tournament at Lasorda Legacy Park in Yaphank. Best of luck in the 13-15 age division to Grant, Finn, Dean and Kyle!\n\nFUN FACT: According to Wikipedia, the ball most commonly used in Wiffle ball was invented by David Mullany at his home in Fairfield in 1953, when he designed one that curved easily for his 12-year-old son. The game was named when his son and friends called a strikeout as a “whiff.”\n\n(“06880” celebrates Westport’s youth whenever we can.

Lieutenant Joe Arnson held it, as Animal Control Officer Peter Reid climbed up to cut the line off the raptor’s talons.\n\nArnson then released the handsome bird, who flew off, once again free.\n\nAfter the rescue, the line was removed from the piling.\n\nOsprey rescue underway.

It’s 238 acres of beaches, wetlands, woods, walking paths, a Nature Center — even a model airplane runway.)\n\nMany Westporters also help keep the park shipshape, as volunteers with Friends of Sherwood Island.\n\nThey raise money in part through a great annual fundraiser. This year’s Shorefest is September 6 (6 to 9 p.m., Sherwood Island pavilion). It features dinner and a silent auction.\n\nDinner options include lobster, tenderloin, salmon or vegetarian, plus steamers, corn, salad and dessert ($100 before September 1; $120 after). A children’s menu ($15) includes hot dog or hamburger, corn, salad and dessert.\n\nClick here for tickets, or send a check to Friends of Sherwood Island State Park, PO Box 544, Westport, CT 06881.\n\n==================================================\n\nYesterday’s “Question Box” included this from David Squires: Where is the highest elevation in Westport?\n\nI had always heard it’s Tower Ridge, next to the Aspetuck Health District and Westport Astronomical Society observatory on Bayberry Lane.\n\nNope.\n\nAlert “06880” reader Chris Grimm found a website called “Peakbagger.” Its page of Connecticut Town High Points cites Westport’s “West Catamount Hill.”\n\nFor the record, it’s 284 feet (87 meters) above sea level.\n\nWest Catamount Hill (Topographical map courtesy of Peakbagger)\n\n==================================================\n\n“Remi’s Run for Parker’s Cure” is a colorful community event, for a great cause.\n\nThe morning of fun, fitness and philanthropy is set for Sunday, August 25 (10 a.m. to noon, PJ Romano Field track).\n\nThe color run is part of Remi Rutstein’s bat mitzvah project. It’s dedicated to her cousin Parker, who is battling a rare genetic brain disorder known as HIST1H1E.\n\nParticipants — grouped by age — will run or walk around the track, while being splashed with colorful, non-toxic powders. By the end of the run, everyone is a living rainbow.\n\nThe fun also includes breakfast from Lyfe Café, a candy truck, sports and games, tattoos, a DJ, and plenty of surprises.\n\nRemi says the event is a way for Westporters to come together and celebrate Parker, raise awareness, and contribute to the search for a cure.\n\nThe event is free, but donations are welcome.

Thank you!)\n\nIf you’re a competitive athlete, you’ll get injured.\n\nMitchell Gilbertie was, and did.\n\nA 4-year Staples High School baseball player, he graduated in 2010 and went on to play at Western Connecticut State University.\n\nBut he tore his labrum. Despite grueling physical therapy, Gilbertie fell in love with the process.\n\nHe changed his major from public relations to physical therapy. He went on to earn a doctorate at the University of Hartford.\n\nHis goal: to help people do whatever they can to avoid surgery.\n\nMitchell Gilbertie, at work.\n\nGilbertie spent the past 5 years with Elevate Physical Therapy, a clinician-owned group with offices in Fairfield, Darien, Stamford and Trumbull.\n\nIn March they opened in Westport at 276 Post Road West, opposite Via Sforza restaurant. Gilbertie heads up the practice.\n\nIt’s a homecoming of sorts — and his roots are deep. His great-grandfather started Gilbertie’s construction and excavation company. His grandfather still lives here.\n\nGilbertie deals with a wide array of patients — not just athletes. They range in age from 7 to 95.\n\nThey suffer from athletic injuries, back pain, Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis. Some are recovering from strokes. He’s also seen new mothers with post-partum back pain.\n\n“Every person is so different,” Gilbertie says. “I need to have a different mindset for each one.”\n\nBut Gilbertie manages to build a relationship with every patient.\n\nA 79-year-old woman with a degenerative nerve disease had a knee replacement. When the muscles did not recover, Gilbertie taught her how to walk again.\n\nLast week, she came in without a cane for the first time in 3 months. “She was so excited,” he says. “That made my day.”\n\nGilbertie also worked with a high school baseball player, whose Tommy John elbow surgery was followed by an infection. After missing an entire season, the physical therapist helped him get his confidence back — including going to the field, and throwing with him.\n\nIn both his professional and personal lives, Gilbertie knows many area orthopedists. He’s also networking with high school athletic directors, letting them know how he can help their teams.\n\n“Pre-conditioning can help prevent injuries like ACLs, especially in girls sports,” Gilbertie says.\n\nElevate’s new Westport office includes another physical therapist, Erin Redding. A third will be added soon. Westporter Ernie Grever is a familiar face, at the front desk.\n\nFrom left: Mitchell Gilbertie, Ernie Grever, Erin Redding.\n\n“The field changes every year,” Gilbertie notes. “I always try to learn and grow.”\n\nHe speaks with doctors, to learn the latest surgical innovations. He also studies functional dry needling, cupping and headache management, among others.\n\nIn other words: Mitchell Gilbertie always tries to elevate his game.\n\n(Elevate Physical Therapy takes nearly all major insurance providers.
