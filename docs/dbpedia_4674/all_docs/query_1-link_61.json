        "text": "The wives and daughters of Dubaiâs ruler live in unbelievable luxury. So why do the women in Sheikh Mohammedâs family keep trying to run away? The New Yorker staff writer Heidi Blake joins In the Darkâs Madeleine Baran to tell the story of the royal women who risked everything to flee the brutality of one of the worldâs most powerful men.

The last chapter of our story takes us from the Greenwich Village cross-dressing scene of the 1960s, to the set of Dario Argentoâs giallo classic, Suspiria (Joanâs last film), to post-reunification Berlin, where Bennettâs legacy as a key face of film noir is solidified. What are the lasting reverberations of the violent act Walter Wanger committed in 1951 -- on Joan Bennettâs family, on film culture, politics and society? What, if anything, would be different today?\n\nListen and subscribe atÂ http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrimeÂ or wherever you get your podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac\n\nApple Podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime\n\nSpotify: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-spotify\n\nStitcher: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-google\n\nFor a transcript of this episode, please follow this link.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Joan is forced to make a living largely through grueling touring theater. By the mid-1950s, Joan is essentially blacklisted from Hollywood movies, but her acting career gets a final boost, when Joan is cast in the legendary daytime supernatural soap, Dark Shadows, and acquires a whole new generation of fans.Â\n\nListen and subscribe atÂ http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrimeÂ or wherever you get your podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac\n\nApple Podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime\n\nSpotify: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-spotify\n\nStitcher: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-google\n\nFor a transcript of this episode, please follow this link.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

He sinks his newly re-acquired power into one final, major folly: Cleopatra. Working with Elizabeth Taylor as she and Richard Burton are in the midst of one of the 20th centuryâs biggest adultery scandals gives Walter a newfound understanding of what he went through with Joan.

Though itâs her husband who commits a shocking act of violence, and itâs he who is actually sent to jail, Joan finds herself painted in the press as the perpetrator. As Hollywood and America rally around the gun-toting man, the adulterous woman is thrown to the wolves to fend for herself and her family.Â Also featuring Brian Comstock as Police Chief.Â\n\nListen and subscribe atÂ http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrimeÂ or wherever you get your podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac\n\nApple Podcasts: http://listen.vanityfair.com/loveisacrime\n\nSpotify: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-spotify\n\nStitcher: http://listen.vanityfair.com/liac-google\n\nFor a transcript of this episode, please follow this link.\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.

Wangerâs personal and professional lives are thrown into chaos thanks to a conspiracy involving the FBI, the Bank of America and some of the same anti-communist organizations enforcing the Hollywood Blacklist. With Walter in crisis, Joanâs (Zooey Deschanel) career is revived thanks to her agent and lover Jennings Lang. Afraid of losing his wife, Walter contemplates desperate action.
