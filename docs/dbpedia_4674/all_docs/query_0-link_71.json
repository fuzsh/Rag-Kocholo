        "text": "Quotes:\n\n\"It's a strenuous job every day of your life to live up to the way you look on the screen.\"\n\n\"I am not an adult, that's my explanation of myself. Except when I am working on a set, I have all the inhibitions and shyness of the bashful, backward child . . . unless I have something very much in common with a person, I am lost. I am swallowed up in my own silence.\"\n\n[on Hollywood] \"I hated the place - not the work, but the lack of privacy, those terrible prying fan magazine writers and all the surrounding exploitation.\"\n\n\"First I played ingénues and western heroines; then I played western heroines and ingénues. That diet of roles became as monotonous as a diet of spinach. The studio wouldn't trust me with any other kind of role, because I had no experience in any other kind. And I didn't see how I was ever going to acquire any other experience if I couldn't get any other kind of role. It was a vicious circle.\"\n\n[on making Only Angels Have Wings (1939)] \"I loved sinking my head into Cary Grant's chest\"\n\n[on director George Stevens] \"George Stevens started out as a cameraman with Laurel and Hardy, and he learned so many wonderful tricks, like having us walk forward while looking backward and then bumping into something. George was a darling man, so great with comedy. It's too bad he got serious.\"\n\n\"I wanted to become a really accomplished actress, but I didn't know how to act, and had no chance to learn. In those days the studios didn't have coaches or drama schools and it was almost impossible to get on the sets to watch the older players. I finally decided there was only one thing to do: go back to New York and try to get into some plays there.\"\n\n- Jean Arthur\n\nTrivia:\n\nEven though Jean and James Stewart never bonded off-screen, Jimmy called Jean \"the finest actress I ever worked with. No one had her humor, her timing\".\n\nDirector George Stevens called her \"one of the greatest comediennes the screen has ever seen\", Frank Capra credited her as \"my favorite actress\" and Billy Wilder called her one performance for him (in A Foreign Affair (1948)) \"simply wonderful\".\n\nGary Cooper and Joel McCrea were her favorite leading men.\n\nShe was teaching at Vassar at the same time that Meryl Streep was studying there in her junior year. Upon seeing the young drama major rehearsing August Strindberg's play \"Miss Julie\", Arthur remarked it was \"just like watching a movie star\".\n\nArthur was cold and unfriendly to Rita Hayworth when they worked together on Only Angels Have Wings (1939), which Arthur later said she regretted.\n\nTurned down Donna Reed's role in It's a Wonderful Life (1946) because she didn't want to work with James Stewart again.\n\nShe kept her natural dark hair color through the early part of her career and began bleaching her hair blonde in around 1930 to differentiate herself from Paramount starlet Mary Brian, whom she was said to resemble.\n\nAppeared in three Frank Capra movies: Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), You Can't Take It with You (1938) and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939).\n\nOn the completion of her Columbia contract in 1944, she reportedly ran through the studio's streets, shouting \"I'm free, I'm free!\".\n\nDespite her confident on-screen persona, Arthur suffered from chronic stage fright and social anxiety. She loathed interviews, refused to do publicity and frequently vomited in the dressing room between takes. Frank Capra said, \"[when you] push that neurotic girl forcibly but gently... in front of the camera she would magically blossom into a warm, lovely, poised and confident actress\".\n\nLike other well known actresses, most notably Claudette Colbert, Arthur was most frequently photographed from the left side, cinematographers having determined that this was her most favorable angle. As evidence of this fact, just take a look at Arizona (1940) or The Lady Takes a Chance (1943). Frank Capra, already having dealt with a similar issue with Colbert while photographing It Happened One Night (1934), had the procedure down pat by the time he did Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936) with Arthur, and only rarely gave audiences a close look at her \"evil\" side, if and when the situation demanded it.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"I don't think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much.\"\n\n\"My film career faded. A man can go on playing certain roles 'til he's sixty. But not a woman.\"\n\n[on Hollywood attorney Jerry Giesler] \"Whenever trouble arose in Hollywood, the first cry for legal help was, \"Get Giesler!\"\n\n[on femme fatales] \"Let people hiss. They'll still be sore at the bad woman long after they've forgotten the nice girl who got the man.\"\n\n[on femme fatales] \"Few people remember good women. They don't forget bad girls.\"\n\n[1946] \"There are hundreds of glamor girls in Hollywood, but actresses who are willing to let down their hair, are always in demand. Getting a salty role is like finding an old friend. One feels the significance of the character.\"\n\n[on sister Constance Bennett] \"Of her fifty-five films, there were only five she considered worthy and she made no pretenses otherwise: Common Clay (1930), The Common Law (1931), What Price Hollywood? (1932), Our Betters (1933), and Topper (1937).\"\n\n\"Nineteen-thirty-nine was also a time of complete transition for my career. That was the year my hair turned prematurely brown. I was scheduled to do another film produced by Walter [Walter Wanger] and directed by Tay Garnett. Tay, who had just viewed Walter's film Algiers (1938), with Hedy Lamarr and Charles Boyer, insisted that Hedy was a brunette edition of me, and he and Walter thought it would be a great joke if they put me in a dark wig for Trade Winds (1938).\"\n\n\"For ten years, with the exception of Little Women (1933) and Private Worlds (1935), I'd played the insipid blonde ingenue, short on brains, long on bank accounts, the victim in a love triangle, and, for some reason that now escapes me, I was often English. Suddenly, I found myself filming Trade Winds (1938) in a dark wig, and with eyes at half-mast and voice lowered an octave, I positively smoldered all over the South Seas.\"\n\n\"I'm aware of the priceless privilege of having been born into the theater. Although it was a career I rejected at first, the profession has given me an incredibly varied life and more than my fair share of success, failure, love, laughter, and despair. I've not a single regret for any of it.\"\n\n[on her change of appearance from blonde to brunette] \"No one anticipated the reaction, least of all me, but the resulting publicity went wild. An avalanche of mail poured into the studio; later, one of the national magazines did a cover story on the three lookalikes: Hedy, Vivien Leigh and me. A national hairdresser's association expressed its wholehearted approval and predicted a new trend of brunette-ism would sweep the country. Always the comments noted the striking resemblance between Hedy Lamarr and me. I could never see it myself. To me I just looked like Joan Bennett with dark hair, but there must have been something to it because often after Trade Winds (1938) was released, in dimly lit restaurants I was greeted as Miss Lamarr. Personally, I liked the idea of escaping from all that bland, blonde innocence and thought the whole thing was very funny, but I don't think Hedy found the comparisons very amusing.\"\n\n- Joan Bennett\n\nTrivia:\n\nShe made five films for Fritz Lang, more than any other American actor or actress who worked with him (many actors disliked working with Lang).\n\nShe was a popular target of disdain in Hedda Hopper's gossip column. To get her point across Bennett mailed Hopper a skunk as a Valentines Day gift in 1950 with a note that read, \"You Stink!\".\n\nAt age 39, Bennett became Tinseltown's youngest and sexiest grandmother when her daughter gave birth. Marlene Dietrich, the former title holder, sent Bennett a telegram thanking her for taking the \"heat off her\".\n\nYounger sister of actresses Barbara Bennett and Constance Bennett.\n\nPlayed Amy March in Little Women (1933) with Katharine Hepburn. She played Elizabeth Taylor's mother in Father of the Bride (1950). Taylor played Amy March in the remake: Little Women (1949).\n\nCo-starred with Edward G. Robinson in The Woman in the Window (1944) and Scarlet Street (1945).\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"There's a very fine line between underacting and not acting at all. And not acting is what a lot of actors are guilty of. It amazes me how some of these little numbers with dreamy looks and a dead pan are getting away wit it. I'd hate to see them on stage with a dog act.\"\n\n[on Al Jolson] \"The screen didn't give him enough space to project in. I remember as a kid seeing him on stage and I think to this day there have been two great performers in the world: one is Jolson and the other is Judy Garland. They had some kind of magic in front of people that no one could surpass -- they were sheer, magnificent talent beyond belief.\"\n\n[on Leslie Howard] \"Leslie Howard was a darling flirt. He'd be caressing your eyes and have his hand on someone else's leg at the same time. He was adorable. He was a little devil and just wanted his hands on every woman around. He just loved ladies.\"\n\n[on Jean Harlow] \"You know, she never wore underclothes and she was walking past the guys on The Public Enemy (1931) one day and James Cagney said, \"How do you hold those things up?\" and she said, \"I ice them.\" And she was very serious.\"\n\n[on Clark Gable] \"It was the joy of your life to know Clark Gable. He was everything good you could think of. He had delicious humor, he had great compassion, he was always a fine old teddy bear. In no way was he conscious of his good looks, as were most other men in pictures at that time. Clark was very unactorly.\"\n\n[on Bette Davis] \"When Bette's good, she's real good. When she's bad, she's awful. But at least, she's not afraid to bat an eyelash.\"\n\n\"In the '20s, you were a face. And that was enough. In the '30s, you also had to be a voice. And your voice had to match your face, if you can imagine that. Jimmy Cagney and Eddie Robinson had voices that were as important as the characters they played. You knew what you were getting even before you paid for the ticket.\"\n\n- Joan Blondell\n\nTrivia:\n\nMade six movies with James Cagney at Warner Brothers - more than any other individual actress. Cagney said that the only woman he loved other than his wife was Blondell.\n\nIn 1927, while closing the library she worked at, she was raped by a police officer. He told her he would kill her if she told anyone. She kept her silence for decades, until finally telling her grown daughter. She went public with this in her memoirs.\n\nShe playfully called her friend Bette Davis's four ex-husbands \"The Four Skins\" since they were all gentiles.\n\nJoan Blondell made 29 films between 1930 and 1933 while under contract to Warners and sited her role as Sissy in A Tree Grows in Brooklyn as her best and director Eliza Kazan as her favourite director.\n\nShe appeared in eight films with Glenda Farrell: Three on a Match (1932), Havana Widows (1933), I've Got Your Number (1934), Kansas City Princess (1934), Traveling Saleslady (1935), We're in the Money (1935), Miss Pacific Fleet (1935) and Gold Diggers of 1937 (1936).\n\nQuotes:\n\n[In The Women (1939)] \"Norma Shearer made me change my costume sixteen times because every one was prettier than hers. I love to play bitches and she helped me in this part.\"\n\n\"Nobody can imitate me. You can always see impersonations of Katharine Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe. But not me. Because I've always drawn on myself only.\"\n\n\"There was a saying around MGM: \"Norma Shearer got the productions, Greta Garbo supplied the art, and Joan Crawford made the money to pay for both\".\"\n\n[speaking to director George Cukor after learning of Marilyn Monroe's death] \"You're right. She was cheap, and an exhibitionist. She was never professional, and that irritated the hell out of people. But for God's sake, she needed help. She had all these people on her payroll. Where the hell were they when she needed them? Why in the hell did she have to die alone?\"\n\n[on Judy Garland] \"Over the years I've heard and read so many stories about the way Judy Garland was so badly treated at Metro she ended up a mess. I did not know her well, but after watching her in action a few times I didn't want to know her well. I think her problems were caused by the fact that she was a spoiled, indulgent, selfish brat--plus a stage mother who had to be something of a monster, and a few husbands whose egos absolutely dominated hers. There were times when I felt sorry for Judy, but there were more times when I thought, \"For Christ's sake, get off your ass!\" . . . but when she put her mind to it, she was good. And I mean damned good. Even in her silly pictures she came off.\"\n\n[on filming Sudden Fear (1952)] \"I have been reported dating Scott Brady and feuding with Gloria Grahame while we were shooting Sudden Fear (1952). But when you're making an independent picture you haven't time for sex or feuds - and I resent it because both make for a happy life!\" - Joan Crawford\n\nTrivia:\n\nWas asked to take over Carole Lombard 's role in They All Kissed the Bride (1942) after Lombard died in an airplane crash returning from a war bond tour. Crawford then donated all of her salary to the Red Cross, which found Lombard's body, and promptly fired her agent for taking his usual 10%.\n\nShe had a cleanliness obsession. She used to wash her hands every ten minutes and follow guests around her house wiping everything they touched, especially doorknobs and pieces from her china set. She would never smoke a cigarette unless she opened the pack herself, and would never use another cigarette out of that pack if someone else had touched it.\n\nWas forced by MGM boss Louis B. Mayer to drop her real name Lucille LeSueur because it sounded too much like \"sewer\".\n\nShe always considered The Unknown (1927) a big turning point for her. She said it wasn't until working with Lon Chaney in this film that she learned the difference between standing in front of a camera and acting in front of a camera. She said that was all due to Chaney and his intense concentration, and after that experience she said she worked much harder to become a better actress.\n\nHer little tap dancing in The Hollywood Revue of 1929 (1929) was the first audible tap dance on the screen.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"Wearing the correct dress for any occasion is a matter of good manners.\"\n\n\"Our human connections are guided by God, and ultimately all of us are linked through His love. Thus, we have all already met, not as actress and fan but as His children, and we can never be lost to each other.\"\n\nOn strategy: \"The trick to life, I can say now in my advanced age, is to stop trying to make it so important.\"\n\n[when offered the role of Miriam in Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte (1964) after Joan Crawford became ill] \"I don't believe in horror stories for women and I wouldn't play a part like that if I were starving.\"\n\n\"No. They're all better than I was. We had our favorites in our period, too. Bette Davis and Ingrid Bergman were the two best actresses. They were both so honest, full of integrity, both of them. Both of them so vulnerable. I don't I think you'll ever see a better performance on film than Bette Davis in The Little Foxes (1941) or Now, Voyager (1942). Bette really really really was talented. Had the energy of a bull. And there wasn't a mean bone in her body.\"\n\n- Loretta Young\n\nTrivia:\n\nHad an illegitimate daughter by Clark Gable. For years, this was covered up in Hollywood, and was presented as an adoption. The daughter's resemblance to both parents is uncanny. The daughter Judy Lewis later dabbled in acting before becoming a psychologist. Judy Lewis wrote a book \"Uncommon Knowledge\" with the truth of her parentage.\n\nLoretta Young's third husband was Academy Award winning clothing and costume designer, Jean Louis. He was well known for designing for the stars at Columbia Studios, Universal and in his own salon in Beverly Hills. His most famous creations included the strapless gown for Rita Hayworth in the film Gilda (1946) as well as Marilyn Monroe's white sequined gown she wore to sing \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\" to John F. Kennedy. Jean Louis married Loretta after the death of his first wife, Maggy, who was a personal friend of Loretta for over 50 years.\n\nShe was the first actress to ever model makeup products for Max Factor.\n\nYoung had a low tolerance for foul language, so much in fact that whenever she went to set she brought with her a \"swear box\". Her swear box was used to hold money from cast and crew members who swore within her presence who in return would put money in the box. Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Mitchum put large sums of money in the swear box on a regular basis, telling Young: \"This should just about cover what I'm about to say to you!\".\n\nMarlene Dietrich said of her: \"Every time she 'sins,' she builds a church. That's why there are so many Catholic churches in Hollywood.\".\n\nTurned down the part of Ellie Andrews in It Happened One Night (1934). Claudette Colbert was then given the role and won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance.\n\nStarred in three Oscar Best Picture nominees: The House of Rothschild (1934), The White Parade (1934) and The Bishop's Wife (1947).\n\nLoretta and older sisters Sally Blane and Polly Ann Young worked as extras during school vacations while young.

All the others had were big boobs.\" \"My advice for those gals who think they have to take their clothes off to be a star is: baby, once you've boned, what's left to create an illusion? Let 'em wonder .I never believed in givin' 'em too much of me.\"\n\n[on her popularity within the gay community] \"They're crazy about me 'cause I give 'em a chance to play. My character is sexy and with humor and they like to imitate me, the things I say, the way I say 'em, the way I move. It's easy for'em to imitate me 'cause the gestures are exaggerated, flamboyant, sexy, and that's what they want to look like, feel like. And I've stood up for 'em. They're good kids. I don't like the police abusin' 'em, and in New York I told 'em, \"When you're hittin' one of those guys, you're hittin' a woman, 'cause a born homosexual is a female in a male body\".\"\n\n\"I was in the office at Paramount, and they gave me a large book with a lot of photographs of different leading men, and I was sitting at a table or a desk right near the window and the door, and uh, after I looked at a few I kind of glanced out the window and I saw this good-looking guy walk across the street. So, I said, \"That's about the best-looking thing in Hollywood: who is he?\" So they looked, and they said, \"Oh, that's Cary Grant. We haven't used him in a picture as yet, but we made tests of him with some of the starlets.\" I said, \"Well, if this guy can talk, I'll take him.\" So they called him in, and we met, and he said, \"How d'ya do?\" and I said, \"OK.\" And they said, \"What part?\" and I said, \"The lead, of course.\" So he got the lead.\"\n\n- Mae West\n\nTrivia:\n\nShe was one of the first women to consistently write the movies she starred in.\n\nOne of her boyfriends and life long friends was the African American Boxer William Jones, nicknamed Gorilla Jones. When management at her Ravenswood apartment building barred him from entering, she solved the problem buy purchasing the building and lifting the ban.\n\nHer films are credited with single-handedly saving failing and debt-ridden Paramount Pictures from bankruptcy in the early 1930s.\n\nAppears on sleeve of The Beatles \"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". West at first declined to be pictured on the cover (\"What would I be doing in a lonely hearts club?!\"), but reconsidered when The Beatles sent her a handwritten personal request.\n\nAccording to Tony Curtis, her famous walk originated while beginning her career as a stage actress. Special six-inch platforms were attached to her shoes to increase the height of her stage presence. Her walk literally was \"one foot at a time\".\n\nShe was with George Raft in both her first (Night After Night (1932)) and last (Sextette (1977)) film.\n\nAlthough critics thought that she and W.C. Fields worked well together on camera in My Little Chickadee (1940), off-screen they couldn't stand each other.\n\nWas banned from NBC Radio after a guest appearance in 1937 with Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy that was loaded with flirtatious dialogue and double-entendres. She returned to the network as a guest on Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall (1948) in 1949.\n\nTurned down a role in Roustabout (1964), which eventually went to Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nQuotes:\n\n[on The Blue Angel (1930), German-language version of The Blue Angel (1930)] \"I thought everything we were doing was awful. They kept a camera pointed here [at my groin]. I was so young and dumb.\"\n\n[in 1964] \"I had no desire to be a film actress, to always play somebody else, to be beautiful with somebody constantly straightening out your every eyelash.

Just like the other actors, he was chosen for his physique, which, after all, was more important than an active brain.\"\n\n[In 1972, about Liza Minnelli] \"I'm annoyed when people keep comparing her to her mother [Judy Garland]. She's nothing to do with her mother. She's a completely different woman. The film Cabaret (1972) is a great hit for her and that's all one wants.\"\n\n\"Once a woman has forgiven a man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast.\"\n\n]on Rock Hudson] \"He was one of the gentlest, kindest men in Hollywood--and all those journalists should burn in Hell for the bile they printed about him when he died.\"\n\n[when Paramount bought the rights to the book, 'Mommie Dearest'] \"I am shocked that Paramount bought that filthy book and made the frightful bitch who wrote it rich, and that rhymes. I did not know Joan Crawford but nobody deserves that kind of slaughter. Too bad she did not leave her where she found her, so she could now spit her poison in the slums of some big city. I hate her with a passion and I know the public will.\"\n\n[on her preference for trousers] \"They are so comfortable. It takes too much time to be a well-dressed woman. I have watched others. Bags, shoes, hats. They must think of them all the time. I cannot waste that time.\"\n\n\"If I dressed for myself, I wouldn't bother at all. Clothes bore me. I'd wear jeans. I dress for the image.

However, they never saw one another outside the Paramount lot.\n\nHer make-up man said she kissed so hard that she needed a new coat of lipstick after every kiss.\n\nNever worked without a mirror on the set so she could constantly check her makeup and hair.\n\nShe prided herself on the fact that she had slept with three men of the Kennedy clan - Joseph P. Kennedy, Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. and John F. Kennedy.\n\nAlmost immediately upon hearing of John Gilbert's status as an all-but-forgotten matinee idol now drinking himself to death, Dietrich devoted herself to the project of \"rehabilitating\" Gilbert. Although she failed to \"save\" Gilbert (who died in 1936) Marlene did become a lifelong \"guardian angel\" to Gilbert's young daughter, remembering the child with annual Christmas and birthday gifts until Dietrich died more than 60 years later.\n\nMarlene suffered from bacilophobia, the fear of germs.\n\nShe thought of feet to be the ugliest part of the human body, and therefore always tried to hide them in one way or another\n\nShe has appeared in four films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant: Morocco (1930), Destry Rides Again (1939), Touch of Evil (1958) and Judgment at Nuremberg (1961).\n\nDirector William Wyler cast her in four films that received Academy Award nominations: These Three (1936) and its remake The Children's Hour (1961), The Heiress (1949) and Carrie (1952).\n\nIn 1933, she was detained at a train station in Paris for violating the ban about women wearing trousers.\n\nDespite her status as one of Hollywood's most legendary sex symbols, Dietrich was known to be most comfortable indulging her fantasy of being a \"typical hausfrau,\" cleaning house, cooking chicken soup and comforting those in need of consoling. Bette Davis, who co-founded the USO's Hollywood canteen, adored Dietrich for her devotion to the project, and remembered Dietrich as being equally likely to be dancing with U.S. servicemen or be found down on her knees avidly scrubbing the canteen's kitchen floors.\n\nAccording to daughter Maria Riva, Dietrich had a long-standing dislike of actress Loretta Young.\n\nWas considered for the role of Margo Channing in All About Eve (1950) after Claudette Colbert was forced to pull out of the project due to back injury. However the part was given to Bette Davis, who went on to receive a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance.\n\nCampaigned for the role of Mama Hanson in I Remember Mama (1948) but Irene Dunne, who went on to receive a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance, was cast instead.\n\nShe turned down the role of Charlie in Station West (1948). The part went to Jane Greer.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"I was never totally involved in movies. I was just making my father's dream come true.\"\n\n[on her early Hollywood roles] \"I was as two-dimensional as the screen itself: cool, indifferent, looking lovely in close-ups. Period. Period. Period. When was I ever going to learn to act? You can't learn if you can't experiment and find out what works and doesn't work. But the hours are long, the schedule rigid, so I did what I was told and saved time and money for the front office. And got a lot of jobs that way.\"\n\n\"A person without memory is either a child or an amnesiac. A country without memory is neither a child nor an amnesiac, but neither is it a country.\"\n\n[on George S. Kaufman] \"He was the kind of man I'd go over a cliff for.\"\n\n\"There are five stages in the life of an actor: Who's Mary Astor? Get me Mary Astor. Get me a Mary Astor Type. Get me a young Mary Astor. Who's Mary Astor?\"\n\n[on her Little Women (1949) co-stars] \"The girls all giggled and chattered and made a game of every scene. Taylor [Elizabeth Taylor] was engaged, and in love, and talking on the telephone most of the time (which is fine normally, but not when the production clock is ticking away the company's money). June Allyson chewed gum constantly and irritatingly, and Maggie O'Brien [Margaret O'Brien] looked at me as though she were planning something very unpleasant.\"\n\n[on Greta Garbo] \"I don't think Garbo with her clothes off, panting in a brass bed, would have been more sexy than she was.\"\n\n- Mary Astor\n\nTrivia:\n\nAfter shooting Little Women (1949), Astor decided against renewing her contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as she had grown tired of playing humdrum mothers.\n\nThanked both Bette Davis and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in her acceptance speech for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 1941 for The Great Lie (1941).\n\nBette Davis was originally cast as Sandra Kovak, the hot-tempered but talented pianist, in The Great Lie (1941) but instead opted for the smaller role of Maggie Van Allen in a bid to let her good friend Astor save her film career. As a result, Astor won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance.\n\nWas almost fired from Dodsworth (1936) following the revelation of her affair with George S. Kaufman, but Samuel Goldwyn insisted she remain in the picture.\n\nShe has appeared in six films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant: Red Dust (1932), Dodsworth (1936), The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), Midnight (1939), The Maltese Falcon (1941) and Meet Me in St. Louis (1944).\n\nIn her book \"A Life on Film,\" Mary Astor recalled that by the time the film Young Ideas (1943) came along, she was beginning to be disturbed about the direction her career was taking, having signed a term contract with MGM. She was pushed into a long line of what she called \"Mothers for Metro\", and when informed that in this film, she would be playing Susan Peters' mother, she thought, \"Swell; what do I do as Susan Peters mother: change her diaper or console her because she wasn't asked to the prom?\".\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"I'm a bad judge of a play or film. I turned down It Happened One Night (1934). It won Claudette Colbert an Oscar. I said it was just a silly comedy.\"\n\n[on being directed in 'Virginia City' by Michael Curtiz] \"(He was) a complete madman - mad and adorable. For twelve weeks he yelled at me and I yelled back at him. We're exactly alike.\"\n\n\"TV is the toughest medium because there's more strain, but the theatre requires the most work. Movies are the easiest. You can sip coffee between takes.\"\n\n\"Me temperamental? I never was. Proof of that is that I made four pictures with Willie Wyler, who is a very demanding director. I made two with Rouben Mamoulian who is the same. Two with Ernst Lubitsch, such a dear man.\"\n\n- Miriam Hopkins\n\nTrivia:\n\nShe was Margaret Mitchell's first choice to play Scarlett O'Hara in Gone with the Wind (1939).\n\nTurned down the part of Ellie Andrews in It Happened One Night (1934). Claudette Colbert was then given the role and won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance.\n\nIn July, 1972, despite concerns about her health and a premonition that she shouldn't travel, she flew to New York to attend the special screening of \"Story of Temple Drake,\" celebrating the 60th anniversary of Paramount Pictures, followed by a gala party in her honor at the Museum of Modern Art. Just as she had feared, she suffered a major heart attack and died in her hotel suite before getting back to her California home.\n\nShe has appeared in three films that have been selected for the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically\" significant: Trouble in Paradise (1932), Becky Sharp (1935) and The Heiress (1949).\n\nIn 1934, she was chosen by Cecil B. DeMille to play Delilah opposite Henry Wilcoxon as Samson, but the film was postponed for more than a decade. When DeMille finally started production on Samson and Delilah (1949), the role went to Hedy Lamarr.\n\nHad a long-running feud with Bette Davis that started before they even entered films, because of jealousy. They were both stage actresses with the same company where Hopkins had been the bigger star who first made it to Hollywood to become a star in films. They were both nominated for Best Actress Oscar in 1935, and Davis won and became the bigger star. She won her second Oscar for Jezebel (1938), which had been a flop on Broadway for Hopkins back in 1933. Davis had an affair with director Anatole Litvak, who at one point was married to Hopkins, although there have been conflicting reports whether the affair took place while he was still married to Hopkins. They competed with each other for screen time in the two films they acted together: The Old Maid (1939) and Old Acquaintance (1943). Long after Hopkins died, the only nice thing that Davis said about her was that she was a good actress, but otherwise she was a \"real bitch\".\n\nDirector William Wyler cast her in four films that received Academy Award nominations: These Three (1936) and its remake The Children's Hour (1961), The Heiress (1949) and Carrie (1952).\n\nWas good friends with actress Kay Francis.\n\nIn 1932, at a time when single-parent adoption was illegal in most states, she adopted a baby boy while between marriages. She adored her son, Michael, and always called him the most important man in her life.\n\nQuotes:\n\n[on her work with William Powell] \"I never enjoyed my work more than when I worked with William Powell. He was a brilliant actor, a delightful companion, a great friend and, above all, a true gentleman.\"\n\n\"Life is not a having and a getting, but a being and a becoming.\"\n\n[on her \"Perfect Wife\" label, based on her work in The Best Years of Our Lives (1946)] \"It was a role no one could live up to, really. No telling where my career would have gone if they hadn't hung that title on me. Labels limit you, because they limit your possibilities. But that's how they think in Hollywood.\"\n\n[Speaking in the late 1960s] \"I admire some of the people on the screen today, but most of them look like everybody else. In our day we had individuality. Pictures were more sophisticated. All this nudity is too excessive and it is getting very boring. It will be a shame if it upsets people so much that it brings on the need for censorship. I hate censorship. In the cinema there's no mystery. No privacy. And no sex, either. Most of the sex I've seen on the screen looks like an expression of hostility towards sex.\"\n\n[Challenging MGM bosses in the 1930s] \"Why does every black person in the movies have to play a servant? How about a black person walking up the steps of a courthouse carrying a briefcase?\"\n\n[on Clark Gable]\" He happened to be an actor, a damned good one, and nobody knew it--least of all Clark. Oh, he wanted to be an actor, but he always deprecated his ability, pretended it didn't matter. He was a really shy man with a terrible inferiority in there somewhere. Something was missing that kept him from doing the things he could have done.\"\n\n\"I was glamorous because of magicians like George J. Folsey, James Wong Howe, Oliver Marsh, Ray June, and all those other great cinematographers. I trusted those men and the other experts who made us beautiful. The rest of it I didn't give a damn about. I didn't fuss about my clothes, my lighting, or anything else, but, believe me, some of them did.\"\n\n[on William Powell] \"The later ones [the \"Thin Man\" pictures] were very bad indeed, but it was always a joy to work with Bill Powell. He was and is a dear friend and, in the early Thin Man films with [director W.S. Van Dyke], we managed to achieve what for those days was an almost pioneering sense of spontaneity.\"\n\n[on Burt Reynolds] \"It's the man's tremendous wit that just keeps coming across. Listen, there is no acting style. Most people just play themselves. Spencer Tracy used to say to me after a scene, \"Did I ham that one up?\" If I said yes, he'd say, \"Okay, let's do it again\". There's that same honesty in Burt Reynolds. He's a throwback to the old school.\"\n\n[on Doris Day] \"I have nothing but the best to say about Doris Day. She was wonderful to me, really lovely. She sent flowers when I started and remained friendly and attentive. As I've said, it's difficult when you start stepping down. You fight so hard to get to the top and then you realize it's time to gracefully give in a little. Doris, who was riding high then, never played the prima dona. I appreciated her attitude enormously.\"\n\n[In 1974] \"When I was touring in \"Don Juan in Hell,\" we played a college town near New Orleans. Paul [Paul Newman] happened to be there shooting The Drowning Pool (1975), so I went to see him that afternoon. I remember walking down a country road past every kid in town waiting to glimpse Paul Newman. When he saw me he rushed over, threw his arms around me, and kissed me, eliciting a collective swoon from those kids, who were probably wondering, \"Who's that lucky old lady?\" We went off and talked until they called him back to work.\"\n\n[In 1981, on her friend Joan Crawford] \"Joan and I approached being movie stars in a different way. She liked to take limos everywhere; she was much \"grander\", for lack of a better word, and maybe I was much more down to earth, but so what? Joan certainly wasn't the only movie star who liked the champagne and limousine treatment. I can tell you that when you made a friend in Joan you had a friend for life. She never forgot your birthday, and you'd get a congratulatory note from her when good things happened in your life. She cared about people and her friends, no matter what anybody says. I liked her, and I miss her, and I think her daughter's stories are pure bunk. Even if they were true, if ever there was a girl who needed a good whack it was spoiled, horrible Christina [Christina Crawford]. Believe me, there were many times I wanted to smack her myself.\"\n\n[on Joan Crawford] \"Joan never complained about her difficult children. Christina and Christopher made me glad I didn't have children.\"\n\n[on \"The Thin Man\" series ending] \"It was the drinking. The characters drank too much, and for a while the public didn't seem to mind all the martinis and all the hangovers, but then, after a while, they did, or at least the studio maintained that was what happened.\"\n\n\"William Powell had that marvelous subtlety that was so compatible with my style of acting. He was a very witty man, a great wit, and knew how to use it.\"\n\n\"Initially in the movies, they cast me as an exotic. I had kind of slitty eyes. I didn't mind. I thought it was wonderful. The more exotic it was, the more it fit in with my background as a dancer. I certainly didn't look like Myrna Williams from Helena, Montana.\"\n\n\"You know, the truth was, I wasn't the perfect wife in the movies. I was the wife everyone wanted, but not the quintessential wife. I was someone fun to be around, not the woman in the apron. Now, don't you think that's so much better?\"\n\n- Myrna Loy\n\nTrivia:\n\nWas supposedly the favorite star of famed outlaw John Dillinger.

But, when I got a little older, a little more mature, I wanted to get out of my image of \"the victimized kid.\" I began to say, \"Wait a minute. There's a thing called comedy that takes an even rougher intelligence and more technique and knowledge of the craft.\"\n\n\"I'd be the girl of the gangster... then the sister who was bringing up the gangster... then the mother of the gangster... and they always had me ironing somebody's shirt.\"\n\n\"What did Hitchcock teach me?

Those babies couldn't care less that their parents were famous.\"\n\n\"What's the use of talking about a favorite role if you can't get it... The role you're doing ought to be your favorite. If you don't like a part it's probably because you've a feeling of inadequacy about it.\"\n\n\"Women who try to hide their age just call attention to it. Why lie about it? I don't feel any younger... I don't look any younger. Somebody finds out about your real age eventually. It's easier to be frank about it... I've enjoyed every age in my life. I've never wanted to go back.\"\n\n[on realizing she could refuse unsuitable roles] \"When I realized I didn't have to, I became a bitch on wheels.\"\n\n[on her unhappy experience working with William Wyler] \"(He) made me feel so inadequate. More than anybody else, I think, he was responsible for sending me back to the stage to try to regain my security as an actress.\"\n\n\"Spencer Tracy was very special. He was not only a great actor, but he listened as well. Tacy would say, 'Acting to me is always reacting!' Tracy and [Henry] Fonda could be in long scenes where they didn't say anything. But you knew they were listening and *hearing* the dialogue.\"\n\n[on Henry Fonda] \"With Fonda you didn't steal scenes.
