        "text": "A slum girl discovers the joys of life as a kept woman until she falls in love. Starring Constance Bennett, Adolphe Menjou, and Robert Montgomery. Adaptation by Edith Ellis. Based on the play Eugene Walter. Directed by Jack Conway.\n\n“Growing up in a poor working-class family, Laura decides not to marry the boy-next-door and instead accepts wealthy, older Will Brockton’s invitation to move in with him. After falling in love with young up-and-coming newsman Jack Madison she leaves Brockton to wait for Madison’s return from a long assignment. She runs out of money and becomes desperate, returning again to Brockton who, upon learning of Madison’s sudden arrival, tells Laura she must inform Madison of her living situation or he will.” (This summary is brought to you courtesy of IMDb.)\n\nIf you’ve never seen a Constance Bennett picture, you’re in for a treat. Most popular in the talkies before World War II, her career has sort of been overshadowed by her sister, Joan Bennett, who transitioned from film to TV, becoming known for her role in Dark Shadows (1966-1971, ABC). But Constance, who boasts a much stronger Pre-Code showing, is a performer of an entirely different sort. There is perhaps no other actress who can so effortlessly manage the balance between the image of herself as a sophisticated woman of the world with a simultaneous existence as the winsome girl next door. Playing both — often in the same film, at the same time — the oldest Bennett girl is consistently believable, and always a fascinating screen presence.\n\nThe Easiest Way gives Bennett an ideal opportunity to showcase her unique talents, as her character goes from poverty to wealth, saint to sinner, lover to leaver all within the course of an hour and 15 minutes. Furthermore, (and I think this will appeal to modern viewers), Bennett seems completely averse to chewing any scenery, so everything is underplayed in a naturalistic style that makes for an effectively understated performance and gives critics little opportunity to find fault. This skill will become more pronounced, and much more powerful, as we examine some of the later films in this blog series."
