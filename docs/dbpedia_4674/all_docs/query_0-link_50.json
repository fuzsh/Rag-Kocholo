The anonymous host of Casefile, whose Australian burr has a deep timbre that guides you into the depths of depravity, and the rich comforting tones of film historian Karina Longworth on You Must Remember This. These are two very different podcasts but both are unrivalled in their respective fields. They have weathered cheap imitators and fads due to their deceptively simplistic style — single host and straightforward, factual storytelling that belies the time and effort put into their creation.",

        "text": "Longworth’s astute dissection and reappraisal of the forgotten history of Hollywood’s golden age and beyond has been around since 2014. It has gathered a dedicated fandom due to Longworth’s in-depth, detailed research and passion for her subjects. She breathed new life into the story of the Hollywood blacklist, took a sideways glance at the gossip industry and with her series on the producer and screenwriter Polly Platt and shone a light on a woman almost written out of the film industry. You Must Remember This gave Platt’s story the respect it deserved as an influential trailblazer who disappeared in the shadow of her ex-husband, formidable director Peter Bogdanovich.\n\nThen there was the You Must Remember Manson true crime mini-series, a thorough, incisive and disturbing look at Charles Manson’s bid for fame and his entanglements with Tinseltown’s elite. Now, with her new podcast series Love is a Crime, she is blending the genres of true crime and old Hollywood glamour, creating an intriguing hybrid.\n\nA collaboration with Vanity Fair (which adds another layer of silver-screen sophistication) the 10-part series tells the story of lesser-known actress Joan Bennett, the star of a variety of films by the iconoclastic German director Fritz Lang. Bennett played Amy March in the Katharine Hepburn version of Little Women and was an integral figure in the birth of the film noir genre. Yet she is best remembered for a tawdry incident in 1951 when her agent and lover, Jennings Lang, was injured when he got shot twice by her husband, film producer Walter Wanger. The scandal ended her flourishing career and she became nothing more than a salacious anecdote.\n\nAs with the Polly Platt series, Love is a Crime acts as a reclamation of Bennett’s career. It delves into subjects familiar to any regular listener to You Must Remember This: the excessive control wielded by the studio system, the bullying, aggressive nature of auteur directors towards female stars and the pervasive presence of the patriarchy that stifled the independence of actresses.\n\nComplicated upbringing\n\nLove is a Crime is a much more elaborate affair than its sister podcast, however. Most notably, there is the inclusion of Bennett’s granddaughter Vanessa Hope, who collaborated with Longworth on the series. Her telling of her grandmother’s complicated upbringing, status as a young single mother and the effect that the scandal had on her family contains a rawness that cuts through the intoxicating glitz.\n\nThen there’s the injection of star power employed to tell the story. The podcast is a beguiling mix of archival footage, interviews, Longworth’s research and narrative plus the inclusion of a dramatic noirish radio play element. You Must Remember This has used voice actors in the past, with Longworth even trying her hand at a variety of voices (with mixed results) but Love is a Crime is stacked full of recognisable acting talent. Don Draper himself, Jon Hamm, plays Walter Wanger with a terse, jaw-clenching tightness and the ever-dreamy Zooey Deschanel turns waspish as the wry Bennett. The dramatic component acts as a welcome diversion from the sometimes heavy grind of the social history that is peppered throughout the story.\n\nUltimately, Love is a Crime is an entertaining extension of the You Must Remember This universe. Captivating and impossibly luxurious, it deserves quality listening time accompanied by a classic cocktail or two."
