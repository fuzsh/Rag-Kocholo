        "text": "Joan Bennett's career ended much as it began _ on stage, and in the East. But between the time she first stepped on a stage in New York to take a supporting role in Jarnegan, a play in which her father Richard starred, and her final retirement in suburban New York, she appeared before audiences the world over.\n\nMiss Bennett was a glittering glamour girl of the 1930 and 1940s who during her long career appeared in more than 75 films.\n\nHad she not been born into an acting family (sisters Constance and Barbara also were in films), her life might have taken a different turn. In fact, it did _ early on _ when at the age of 16 she ran away with the son of a millionaire and became a mother at 17.\n\nBut she returned to the family's Palisades, N.J., home, began divorce proceedings and took a Broadway role. That brought her to the attention of film makers, and she was signed by United Artists when she was 18 and the production of talking pictures were just getting started.\n\nHer first film, Bulldog Drummond, was made in 1929. Her co-star was Ronald Coleman.\n\nAnd over the years, she played opposite all of the big male stars _ Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, Bing Crosby, Fred MacMurray, Henry Fonda, Fredric March. Of all those Hollywood greats, she says today, \"Spencer Tracy was my favorite.\"\n\nAmong the roles for which she is remembered is Amy in Little Women. That was made in 1934. But her personal favorites are Scarlet Street, in which she played a scheming woman, and her role as a compelling artist's model in Woman in the Window.\n\nIn the 1950s, Miss Bennett began doing television, and toward the end of her career she had a long run (1966-71) in a daytime soap opera, Dark Shadows. But television is not a medium she particularly likes. \"I guess I like the stage best,\" she said.\n\nShe has, in addition to acting, spent a good part of her life being a mother. In addition to the firstborn from her teen-age marriage, she has three other daughters. When she was working, she required a stipulation in her contracts that she could be home from work in time to bathe the children and put them to bed.\n\nMiss Bennett has been married four times. After her initial runaway marriage, her husbands were Gene Markey and Walter Wanger. Both marriages ended in divorce. Today she is married to David Wilde, formerly a publisher of a weekly newspaper, and they live in Scarsdale, N.Y.\n\n\"We go into New York a couple of times a week,\" she said, and regularly attend the theater there. \"We're going to be seeing three new plays soon,\" she said, \"but I can't remember what they are. My husband has the tickets.\"\n\nMiss Bennett says she and her husband also like to travel, and usually make about one trip abroad each year, visiting London, Paris and Italy. \"We also go out to California frequently; I have a daughter out there,\" she said. The other three are nearby, two in New York City, the other in Chappaqua. And there are 13 grandchildren.\n\nShe says she still goes to movies today. As for films today compared to those made in her era, she says only, \"I guess they're all right. But I don't know many of the people any more.\" As for television, she names two programs she especially likes _ Johnny Carson's Tonight Show and Jeopardy. After her run in Dark Shadows ended, Miss Bennett acted mainly on stage, often in dinner theaters. One of those appearances was on the Suncoast, in a Showboat Dinner Theater production of Butterflies Are Free in 1972.\n\nMiss Bennett told her life story, and that of her family, in The Bennett Playbill, which she says sold very well.\n\nToday, at 80, she says there is just one role that she would like to have had but didn't get.\n\nThat was Scarlett O'Hara in Gone With the Wind.\n\n\"I tested for it,\" she said, \"and was told that it was down to two of us. If only Vivien Leigh had stayed in England.\""
