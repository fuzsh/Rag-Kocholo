The first two, Me and My Gal and She Wanted a Millionaire, were made in 1932 when Joan was still very much a natural blonde and Mr. Tracy sported a youthful, darker shade of hair color. Their next two and final films together, Father of the Bride and its sequel Father’s Little Dividend, came nearly twenty years later, i.e. 1950 and 1951, respectively, when Ms. Bennett was very much a brunette while, conversely, Mr. Tracy had acquired a mature and much lighter shock of hair. She had changed from a blonde to a brunette for her role in the 1938 movie Trade Winds and kept her hair that way throughout the remainder of her career. He had simply become gray and apparently, as with Ms. Bennett’s choice of hair color, was satisfied to remain that way."
