        "text": "On BENNETT: articles—\n\nBowers, Ron, \"Joan Bennett,\" in Films in Review (New York), June/July 1977.\n\nShipman, David, in The Great Movie Stars: The Golden Years , rev. ed., London, 1979.\n\nObituary in New York Times , 9 December 1990.\n\nObituary in Times (London), 10 December 1990.\n\nObituary in Variety (New York), 17 December 1990.\n\nThomson, David, \"Lazy Legs,\" in Film Comment (New York), March/April 1991.\n\nViviani, C., \"Joan Bennett, la 'chose enrobee de cellophane,\"' in Positif (Paris), July/August 1991.\n\nNeff, W. \"Joan Bennett,\" Architectural Digest (New York), no. 53, April 1996.\n\n* * *\n\nJoan Bennett, the youngest of the three acting daughters of prominent stage and screen star Richard Bennett, was the last of the sisters to enter films seriously, but she had the longest and, in retrospect, the most meaningful career of any of her family. Joan, like Constance and Barbara, was a gorgeous woman, slender and blond, with dramatic eyes. She acted in numerous films during the 1930s, many of which were important, such as Disraeli and Little Women , but none of them was particularly noteworthy for her participation. It was not until the late 1930s when she dyed her hair dark brown that Bennett became more than just another beautiful Hollywood blond and began to have significant impact on films. She frequently played a sultry femme fatale in her new image, outstandingly beautiful but destructive. In her two most highly regarded films, The Woman in the Window and Scarlet Street , both directed by Fritz Lang, she displayed a cool, pernicious character, the antithesis of the mild-mannered, unsophisticated common man played by Edward G. Robinson in each film.\n\nIn these two films, as well as others such as Jean Renoir's The Woman on the Beach , Bennett was able to appear beautifully innocent and vulnerable on the surface, while hiding a stony evilness on the inside. Lang, and others, have expressed great admiration for Bennett's contributions to her films of this period, and some critics have called her the epitome of the film noir heroine.\n\nYet, despite her success in dramatic roles, Bennett also acted successfully in more sympathetic comedy roles. At age 40, and still a very beautiful, young-looking woman, she was very charming in the box-office success Father of the Bride , portraying Spencer Tracy's wife and Elizabeth Taylor's mother. Unlike many other beautiful actresses, Bennett decided to begin playing \"mothers\" and older parts before she actually needed to. She also took chances in her career and varied her roles, dividing her time among costume epics, melodramas, and tearjerkers such as Max Ophüls's The Reckless Moment and Douglas Sirk's There's Always Tomorrow . In the latter film, Bennett played a boring housewife married to Fred MacMurray who feels stifled by her presence and that of their children and contemplates leaving them for a former sweetheart."
