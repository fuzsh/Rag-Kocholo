Tyson Chandler came into the NBA as the second pick of the 2001 draft. After he was selected by the Los Angeles Clippers, he was traded the same day to the Chicago Bulls in exchange for Elton Brand.

Chandler spent five seasons in Chicago, making the playoffs twice and never advancing past the first round. Even though he is now playing in Dallas, Chandler is still keeping up with his former team.

"The way they are playing right now, they're playing incredible," Chandler told the Chicago Tribune after last Sunday's win over the Phoenix Suns. "Derrick Rose has taken that team to another level. He's definitely the MVP, to me, the way he's been playing â€¦ putting pressure on teams and stepping it up, leading his team on offense and the defensive end. He has been spectacular this year."

Chandler also told the publication that he is a different player from his days in Chicago.

"When I first came into this league, I didn't necessarily understand the game," he said. "And playing in the NBA is a totally different game than any game or any level that you can play. It took me a while to adjust and to understand how to be professional and how to approach games. I feel like I'm there now."
