        "text": "The work day began for Tyson Chandler with a weight-lifting session and the Suns shoot-around.\n\nThe rest of his day: go home, take a nap and play with his kids when they’re out of school.\n\nHe’ll eat a pregame lunch and return to Talking Stick Resort Arena where he’ll go through an aerobic warmup and stretch his 7-foot-1, 36-year-old body.\n\n“Then it’s time to go,” he said.\n\nIt is a routine that has served Chandler well for much of an NBA career that is entering an 18th season. But it is far different from when he entered the league in 2001, drafted second overall out of Dominguez High School in Compton, California.\n\nHe was 18 when the Los Angeles Clippers selected him and traded him immediately to the Chicago Bulls.\n\n“It’s so different now,” Chandler said, reflecting on his first year in the league. “When I was a rookie, I just had a bunch of nervous energy. You’re young and you can move all over the place.\n\n“Now everything is precise. Everything has a time. Even energy output, you just kind of measure everything you do now in this league. I used to get so pumped up. Now it’s all mental where I analyze what’s going on.”\n\nChandler said it was probably seven years into his career before he settled into a routine. Of course, the demands of the schedule and travel can make sticking to habits difficult. He had to figure out most of it by observing more experienced players.\n\n“I just watched the vets,” he said. “I’d watch Antonio Davis, Oak (Charles Oakley) and (Scottie) Pippen. Those guys were doing what I’m doing now.”\n\nHe also listened and learned from the athletic training staffs and strength coaches wherever he has played.\n\n“The game has evolved so much and the training and the science has evolved so much,” he said. “So, I try to learn everything those guys learn and implement that to take care of my body and get the most out of it.”\n\nNow he’s the long-in-the-beard veteran setting the example for his team’s young players, including rookie center Deandre Ayton, at 20 a year older than Chandler when he made his debut.\n\nChandler is in the final year of his contract with the Suns, but hopes to get a few more years out of his body and maybe even reach 20 years in the NBA.\n\nHowever, while he has his routine, it doesn’t mean he won’t still feel that youthful energy that comes with the start of a new season.\n\n“Absolutely,” he said. “I love the competition, the competitive nature of the game. I feel like you’re always fighting for something.\n\n“When you’re young, you’re trying to prove yourself and fight your way into the league. And when you get to where I am, you’re fighting for your legacy and your pride and all of that, and showing that you’ve still got it.”\n\nChandler also is energized by a Suns roster that he said has more depth than at any time since he came to Phoenix in 2015. And he believes the Suns have two future All-Stars, Ayton and Devin Booker, and a coach, Igor Kokoskov, who will turn the franchise’s fortunes around.\n\n“I could feel it the first day,” he said. “We still have to make a lot of growth. I’m not going to sugarcoat it and say we’re ready now. That’s not even close to the case. There are so many teams so far ahead of us, and so many teams just coming together.\n\n“The West is so tough, and all of those teams that have come together have more veteran leadership. When you have vets at multiple positions, they just understand things because they’ve been around longer.\n\n“In our case, we still have a ton of young players. We have a lot of young guys at the guard positions especially. But we’ve added some veterans, and it’s our job and the coaching staff’s job to bring this thing around a little faster.\n\n“I like our unit. I like the young players. I love the what the coach is trying to do. I think it’s one of those things that’s going to take time because he’s implemented a new system, a new everything, a new culture. Everything is different. Everything is new.”\n\nEven for an 18-year vet.\n\nOne thing Chandler has definitely learned is not to think there isn’t something new to see.\n\n“You know, every time I say that, I see something new,” he said. “And I always say, ‘I’ve done seen it all now!’\n\n“Every day, I feel like, is fresh and new to be quite honest. I feel like it’s a blessing for me to be here still competing at a high level going into my 18th season.\n\n“I don’t take for granted any of that.”\n\n(Photo of Tyson Chandler by Kirby Lee / USA Today Sports)"
