        "text": "Before the next Suns training camp, there are plans for Camp Chandler.\n\nSuns center Tyson Chandler plans to host the core of the Suns roster during the summer to get a jump on the work he felt the team lacked entering this season, which is a loss away from being the franchise's worst season since the 1968-69 inaugural team.\n\n“I feel like this season got way off on the wrong foot,” Chandler said. “Even though we won some games, I didn’t like it even early. Even when we were 7-5, I didn’t like it because it’s important that you win the right way. When you’re playing at a high level, and I’ve been there, you know when you’re a good team. You can just feel it. I felt we had spurts but we were always kind of rocking. It’s important all of us are on the same page and we all truly come in with the same goal.”\n\nMORE: Download our Suns XTRA app iOS | Android\n\nChandler’s home base is in the celebrity-laden community of Hidden Hills, Calif., near Calabasas. The logistics of Camp Chandler accommodations and gym access remain to be determined but Chandler sees his plan as a necessity and part of his duty since he signed a four-year, $52 million contract last year to lead the Suns.\n\n“I’ll figure it out,” Chandler said. “If I have to pay for everybody, I don’t care. To me, it’s important that this organization builds the right way. When I signed on to it, I’m here. I want to win. I want to be part of the change. In order to do that, I know there are areas I’ve got to lead because it hasn’t been done for a while. The (Steve) Nashes and all of them, they’re gone. We’ve got to turn this thing back around to a winning culture.”\n\nThe Suns are experiencing the longest postseason drought in franchise history, going without a playoff appearance since 2010’s conference finals team. If Detroit (no playoffs since 2009) secures a postseason spot, the Suns’ drought will rank as the NBA’s third longest to Minnesota (2004) and Sacramento (2006).\n\nThe Suns had postseason expectations for this season but it has been defined by losses, injuries and personnel and coaching turmoil.\n\nRELATED: Knight done for season; surgery possible\n\n“Honestly, I feel like I came in blind this season,” Chandler said. “I expected one thing and it was another. I’ve been trying to adjust. I was expecting to play a certain type of basketball and it was different.\n\n“It’s been an adjustment throughout the year. I’m really looking forward to, ‘Look, this is what we have. This is our coach. This is the free agent we’re bringing in. This is our draft pick. These are the guys we’re bringing back. Let’s build.’ It’s been a year. It’s always been something. I’m looking forward to the boat not rocking and being steady and getting to work.”\n\nChandler’s 6.8 points per game, 8.7 rebounds per game and 57.5 percent shooting are his lowest since 2009-10 with Charlotte and his 0.6 blocks per game is a career low. The numbers are misleading because he has played only 24.3 minutes, also his lowest average since 2009-10.\n\nChandler’s rebound rate is actually the second best of his career (12.9 per 36 minutes). As one of the NBA’s all-time leaders in field-goal percentage, Chandler has converted a more customary 66.7 percent of his shots since the All-Star break.\n\n“I know I can play,” said Chandler, who is 33. “Of course, when you put up good numbers, then everybody feels like you’re doing what you’re capable of doing. I know I can play. For me, this year, it’s been a lot about trying to bring along guys and then trying to find my way with different lineups and injuries and all that kind of stuff. It’s been a year. I was never concerned whether or not I could put up those kind of numbers. For me, it’s about winning.”\n\nRELATED: Early struggles stymie Suns in loss to Jazz\n\nTele-vision\n\nWith 162 3-pointers this season off the bench, Suns power forward Mirza Teletovic could break the NBA record for 3s by a reserve. San Antonio’s Chuck Person set the mark of 164 with San Antonio in the 1994-95 season.\n\nOnly Stephen Curry has averaged more 3-point attempts per 48 minutes (15.1) than Teletovic has (13.7) among players who qualify for stat leaders by being on pace for 82 3-pointers made. Teletovic’s 164 total combined 3s (including one game as a starter) ranks 15th in the NBA and his 39.2 3-point shooting percentage ranks 29th.\n\n“I’m taking the shots that I’m getting,” Teletovic said. “If I get a 3-point shot, I shoot it. If not, I don’t shoot it.”\n\nRELATED: Suns defense makes strides but detail to come\n\nFree throws\n\nAfter averaging 20.8 turnovers over the past six games, the Suns now have passed Philadelphia for the NBA season lead in turnovers per game (17.0).\n\n*The Suns are trying for a season series sweep of Atlanta. Their only sweep victim so far this season is Orlando.\n\nReach Paul Coro at paul.coro@arizonarepublic.com or (602) 444-2470.
