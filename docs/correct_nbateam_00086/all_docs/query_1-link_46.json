        "text": "Tyson Chandler News\n\nTyson Chandler To Miss Third Straight Game Monday\n\nHouston Rockets center Tyson Chandler has been ruled out for Mondays contest versus the Sacramento Kings due to flu-like symptoms. Chandler will be sidelined for the third game in a row, which will likely force Houston to deploy their small ball lineup for an extra handful of minutes. Chandler holds extremely limited fantasy value, having attempted more than two shots in a game just once all season. His next chance at returning comes Wednesday versus Cleveland.\n\nDec 9\n\nTyson Chandler Will Rest Monday\n\nHouston Rockets center Tyson Chandler (rest) will sit the first night of a back-to-back on Monday against the Portland Trail Blazers. Clint Capela (concussion) is returning to the starting lineup after a concussion which will allow the Rockets to rest the veteran Chandler. With Capela back, Chandler loses most, if not all, of his fantasy value. Isaiah Hartenstein will get some backup center minutes on Monday.\n\nNov 18\n\nRockets Sign Tyson Chandler\n\nThe Houston Rockets have signed veteran center Tyson Chandler, who played 55 games last season for the Suns and Lakers. Chandler averaged just 3.1 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, and he'll likely be mired in the back of the Houston rotation this year, seeing 10-15 minutes per game on what could be an irregular basis. This signing doesn't matter for fantasy purposes unless Houston's starting center Clint Capela misses time, in which case Chandler may have a little value in deep leagues.\n\nJul 12\n\nTyson Chandler Upgraded to Probable on Tuesday\n\nLos Angeles Lakers center Tyson Chandler (neck) has been upgraded to probable for Tuesday's game against the Milwaukee Bucks. Chandler is expected to return to action after missing the last seven contests. JaVale McGee is averaging a little over 25 minutes per game over the last four games. He's likely going to see less minutes with Chandler back in the rotation, so expect McGee to lose some fantasy value.\n\nMar 19\n\nTyson Chandler Unable To Suit Up For Thursdayâ€™s Game\n\nLos Angeles Lakers center Tyson Chandler will miss his fifth consecutive game versus the Toronto Raptors on Thursday due to neck tightness. Chandler has seen his playing time take a sharp downturn as of late, so his absence isnt likely to sway head coach Luke Waltons rotations too drastically in any direction. His next chance to suit up comes Friday against the Detroit Pistons.\n\nMar 14\n\nTyson Chandler Questionable To Make Return Thursday\n\nLos Angeles Lakers center Tyson Chandler could suit up for Thursdays contest versus the Toronto Raptors, having missed the previous four outings due to neck stiffness. Chandler has seen his role decrease as the season has gone along with head coach Luke Walton opting for smaller lineups and prioritizing younger players down the stretch. Even if Chandler is given the thumbs up to take the floor, dont expect him to be a viable fantasy commodity.\n\nMar 13\n\nTyson Chandler Ruled Out On Tuesday\n\nLos Angeles Lakers center Tyson Chandler will be in street clothes for Tuesdays contest versus the Atlanta Hawks due to a right big toe sprain. Chandler was unable to participate in shootaround earlier in the day, so the move comes as little surprise and should pave the way for JaVale McGee to see a hefty minutes load at center, making him an appealing DFS play. Mike Muscala will also be active, but may be limited. Chandler will have the All-Star break to recover, next eligible to suit up come Feb. 21 against Houston.\n\nFeb 12\n\nMike Muscala, Tyson Chandler Questionable on Tuesday\n\nLos Angeles Lakers centers Mike Muscala (ankle) and Tyson Chandler (toe) were unable to participate in shootaround and are questionable for Tuesday's game against the Atlanta Hawks. Muscala sprained his right ankle during the fourth quarter of Sunday's game. Chandler has only played in three of the last six contests and is quickly falling out of the rotation. JaVale McGee and Moritz Wagner would see increased minutes without Muscala or Chandler in the lineup. McGee has more upside than Wagner in terms of fantasy production.\n\nFeb 12\n\nTyson Chandler To Rest Saturday\n\nLos Angeles Lakers center Tyson Chandler will join teammate LeBron James on the bench for Saturdays contest versus the Golden State Warriors due to rest purposes. Chandlers absence should pave the way for JaVale McGee to get additional run off the bench, while Ivica Zubac figures to remain the teams starting center for the time being. How much Chandler would have factored into head coach Luke Waltons rotation against the multi-dimensional Warriors lineup is unknown, but Chandlers next chance to return to the court will be Tuesday versus Indiana.\n\nFeb 2"
