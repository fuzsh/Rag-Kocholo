        "text": "The U of A Honors College has selected 91 exceptional high school students, including 80 from Arkansas, to receive Honors College Fellowships.\n\nThe fellowships, which award up to $80,000, largely cover tuition, fees, books, room and board, and other academic expenses over four years, providing these students the freedom to pursue original research, study abroad, service learning and other academic interests.\n\nThe fellowship funds can also be combined with other scholarships and grants, such as the more than $2 million in study abroad and research grants that the Honors College awards to students each year.\n\n“The Honors College continues to have an incredibly competitive pool for our fellowship program each year,” said Noah Pittman, associate dean of enrollment for the Honors College. “Our new Honors College fellows are incredibly bright and accomplished, and we look forward to helping each of them achieve their goals at the University of Arkansas and beyond.”\n\nThe new fellows boast an average grade point average of 4.25 and an average composite ACT score of 34. Also, 11 percent of the students are the first in their family to attend college.\n\nThe members of this distinguished class plan to study a diverse range of subjects, from biology and chemical engineering to history, data science and architecture.\n\nMany have achieved notable recognition. Within this group of new fellows, 29 were named National Merit Finalists. Overall, each of these new fellows has an impressive record full of accomplishments.\n\nThe fellowship application process is rigorous. Students must score at least 32 on the ACT and achieve a minimum 3.9 grade point average to apply. Each student’s application is then reviewed by Honors College administrators and faculty for evidence of intellectual curiosity, leadership potential and community involvement. The selection process also involves a timed writing test and a campus interview for finalists.\n\nIncluding the 2024 recipients, a total of 1,776 students have benefited from the Honors College Fellowship program. Recent fellows include Truman, Goldwater and Udall Scholars, Fulbright award winners and an Olympic pole vaulter.\n\nFellowship alumni are launching startups, taking leadership roles at international corporations and nonprofit organizations, and pursuing higher degrees at schools such as Harvard Law School, Johns Hopkins University, Cambridge University, University of Chicago Medical School, the California Institute of Technology, University of Virginia and Tufts University School of Medicine.\n\nThe Honors College Fellowships were made possible by a portion of the Walton Family Charitable Support Foundation’s $300 million gift to the university in 2002.\n\nHONORS COLLEGE FELLOWS, CLASS OF 2028\n\n· Chris Ablondi – Conway High School, Conway\n\n· Benyamin Adams – Don Tyson School of
