We also include a brief suggestion of who will likely benefit. Further analysis can be done with Usage Monster to see who benefits when a player is out.\n\nBasketball Monster is an absolute must-have for any serous fantasy basketball coach. I’ve been playing for 7 years and have won multiple league Championships and have never once finished lower than 3rd place… in any league, all of which are very competitive.\n\nastearns\n\nThanks BBM for another great season! Without your tools I wouldn't be close to doing the things that I'm doing. Won my super competitive league with a Punt 4 strategy. Would never be able to pull this kind of strategy off without BBM's tools to help me find the steals off the WW and draft.\n\nlordbattletank\n\nI won my 16 team league after giving BBM a try this year. It is worth every penny and then some! Thanks to the whole BBM team for making such a great tool to give all us members the competitive edge!\n\npacino1228\n\nWithout BBM I would not have been able to come back from dead last to make it to the playoffs, and then win the championship!\n\nSpurlars\n\nJust want to heap some more praise. I finished regular season in first (35 games ahead of 2nd place team) and just crushed the finals match up 9-1. The group text was DEAD over the past few weeks because I broke everyone's spirits; there's no greater feeling!\n\nTWILDMAN\n\n4 competitive leagues: 3 out of 4 finals appearance and a semi-final run in the other. I've been a subscriber for a long time, and you guys just keep making the site better and better. Thanks!\n\npackermatt\n\nI went from last place to first place in my 12 team keeper league with the help of BBM. Thanks to the entire BBM crew! Looking forward to next year already!\n\nevbanks\n\nThank you BBM! First year joined and avid podcast listener, and I won 1st place and $400 and most importantly an engraving on the league trophy! Keep up the great work!\n\ncraigfc8\n\nWon both my leagues this year! Thanks BBM Crew! Made some crucial adds using the smart tool and daily player projection tool. They both really came in handy, made the playoffs by half a game in my one league, and won the championship by just 2 assists! In my other league I won the championship by just one steal! Thanks for everything, well worth the money!\n\nroyistheboy\n\nHere here! Cheers to another successful season of fantasy basketball. I've learned so much through the years using BBM and this season proved to be the most difficult to maneuver. Fortunately, I've got some championships to cherish!\n\nnghiem\n\nBasketball Monster is the only hoops site to which I pay money for projections and in-season management tools. I only play one team a year, and I honestly don’t think I've finished lower than second in any season since I began using BBM. The tools are great, the projections are great, and the customer service is great.\n\nQuest28412\n\nThanks to bbm, I pick up players utilizing the weekly projections before anyone in my league knew they were heating up and I killed it in the playoffs.\n\nhsahardid\n\nI originally turned to BBM because our league uses a very intense auction/salary/contract/keeper format that renders most mainstream rankings and projections fairly worthless. BBM has made that so easy for me. So this year I won my league for the first time and raked in over $700 in winnings for my efforts.\n\npsu148\n\nThank you for providing a great fantasy basketball resource! The daily summary, projections, and the forums were very helpful. I won my long term roto league (25 years) with 46 of 48 possible points, a league record. The punting analyzer was helpful in the last month as I was pushing for the record.\n\ntcschell\n\nThanks Basketball Monster! I was in 4 H2H leagues this year and made the finals in all 4. The site is easy to use and has a lot of great features, especially the daily/weekly projections. I'll definitely be back next year.\n\npackermatt\n\nThis is my first year using basketballmonster. I am in the championship game in 3 out of 3 h2h leagues, and in first place in 1 out of 1 roto leagues. Completely worth the money for the data, projections, and forums. I've never had a question unanswered.\n\nRUNTMC\n\nThis is my first year here. I've always been astounded at just how few good fantasy basketball resources there are out there, but basketballmonster.com definitely stands out. The projections, H2H, weekly, and team analysis are top notch, and I don't know how I ever lived without them.\n\nPennypacker\n\nI recommend this site to anyone who plays fantasy sports. I feel that I have an advantage over anyone who doesn't use this site in regular formats and daily formats. I can't imagine not having this success without Basketball Monster. I think this is the best fantasy site bar none for fantasy stats.\n\njrwax2"
