        "text": "As we approach the end of a dark Suns season, take solace in the fact that one of the most fashionable athletes in sports was taking the court in purple and orange (and sometimes black) on a daily basis.\n\nThis special someone “understands the dimensions of his body” and “celebrates his lean, muscular frame, endless legs and broad shoulders by embracing body-conscious tailoring,” according to Sports Illustrated’s Fashionable 50.\n\nAny guesses?\n\nThe “endless legs” part should give it away.\n\nIt’s Tyson Chandler!\n\nUnfortunately SI's list doesn't rank the athletes after the top 10 and Chandler doesn't make that cut, but we'll pretend he's somewhere in the 11-20 range based on all the nice things Rachel Johnson, SI fashion expert and CEO/stylist at Thomas Faison Agency, had to say about him.\n\nJohnson wrote that Chandler “has been at the forefront of most fashion trends in the NBA,” including the resurrection of Walt Clyde Frazier’s famed hat, “The Clyde.” He was also one of the first to wear southern California designer Rick Owens, apparently.\n\nPlus, “the confidence he exudes is innate and it has allowed him to make bold fashion choices before they were in vogue,” according to Johnson.\n\nYas queen.\n\nChandler wasn’t the only Arizona sports athlete named to the list, but this one is much easier to guess.\n\nYes, the always-classy Larry Fitzgerald also made an appearance as one of the most stylist athletes.\n\nFitzgerald attributed his interest in fashion to his “fashionista” mom and TV shows like “Boardwalk Empire,” which is set in the Prohibition era.\n\nMy only problem with this list is that Victor Cruz is somehow more fashionable than a guy who wore a poncho and a wooden hat to go play basketball?\n\nRussell Westbrook deserves to be No. 1 here simply because of where he is willing to take his off-the-court outfits.\n\nI’m also kind of confused how Antonio Brown doesn’t make the list, but can you really trust the fashion judgment of a guy who owns a James Franco selfie sweater?\n\nFor more from The Heat Index, go to heatindex.azcentral.com."
