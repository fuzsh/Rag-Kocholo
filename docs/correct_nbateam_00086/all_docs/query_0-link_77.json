        "text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- Knicks center Tyson Chandler has dismissed a former teammate's claims that members of the 2002-03 Chicago Bulls smoked marijuana prior to games.\n\nIn a profile published by the New York Times on Sunday, Jay Williams said \"some guys were high\" during games. Williams played only one season in the NBA before a motorcycle accident in June 2003 ended his career.\n\n\"I think that's ridiculous that he would come out and say something like that,\" Chandler said at a Garden of Dreams Foundation event Monday night, according to the New York Daily News. \"I don't remember that, to be honest with you. And, it's just unfortunate that he would make that kind of statement about our team.\"\n\nIn the Times piece, Williams admitted he \"didn't know how to handle\" the NBA lifestyle as a young player.\n\n\"I didn't know how to be around it,\" he said. \"Guys were on the bench, trying to kick it to girls in the stands, having ball boys run over. I mean, some guys were high.\"\n\nWilliams was asked to clarify.\n\n\"There were guys smoking weed before games,\" he said. \"Guys asking in the middle of the game, 'Do you smell popcorn.'\"\n\nChandler was on the Bulls in 2002-03 with Williams, who is now a college basketball analyst on ESPN.\n\n\"Nah, I don't know why he would say something like that,\" Chandler said.\n\nWilliams said in a statement Monday: \"I gave an honest account of my struggles and observations during a specific time in my life; that was one small element. It was a long time ago and I am not looking to make it a bigger issue.\""
