        "text": "Tyson Chandler looked up before the Dallas Mavericks’ shootaround to see the 2011 championship banner that hangs at American Airlines Center. He shook his head and said that he and his teammates have one agenda – and one only – for Game 4 tonight. Nothing is more devastating for a proud player than getting swept in the playoffs. On your home court, no less. “I don’t want to go down like this,” Chandler said. “We got to take it one game at a time, but I’m not going out like this. It’s embarrassing. That makes for a long summer. And I don’t want to face that.”\n\n“We got to go out there and approach every game as an individual game and try to win,” Mavs center Tyson Chandler said after Friday night’s 130-128 loss to the Houston Rockets at the AAC. “We definitely got to try to win on our home floor. You never want to get swept. We got to come out and play hard.”"
