        "text": "They were supposed to be the NBA's next version of the \"Twin Towers.\" While one was dubbed, \"Baby Shaq\", the other drew comparisons to Kevin Garnett.\n\nMore importantly, Eddy Curry and Tyson Chandler were supposed to carry the rebuilding Chicago Bulls to another dynasty.\n\nUnfortunately, the two seven-footers didn't quite turn out to be Shaquille O'Neal and Kevin Garnett. Not even close—and no, they didn't help the Bulls regain their status as World Champions, either.\n\nCurry and Chandler came to Chi-Town via the 2001 draft as the Bulls acquired Chandler, who was the second overall pick, from the Los Angeles Clippers for star power forward Elton Brand. They drafted Curry with the fourth pick.\n\nInstantly, general manager Jerry Krause thought he had found the perfect cornerstones for the Bulls' rebuilding plan—two high school big men that possessed loads of potential.\n\nKrause also thought that by bringing in Curry and Chandler, he could one day make up for his past mistakes, such as dismantling the Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen-led dynasty too early, and failing to land any of the top free agents in the summer of 2000 like Tim Duncan and Tracy McGrady.\n\nHowever, Curry and Chandler were disappointments during their stay in Chicago, although they sometimes showed flashes of greatness.\n\nCurry turned out to be a reliable low post scorer who lacked rebounding ability, and Chandler developed into a decent shot-blocker and rebounder who couldn't score.\n\nTogether, they helped the inexperienced Bulls get into the first round of the playoffs a couple of times but nothing more than that.\n\nEventually, the infamous Curry and Chandler duo was broken up. Curry was signed-and-traded to the New York Knicks in 2005 after refusing to take a DNA test which would have determined if he had a congenital heart condition. Chandler was dealt to the New Orleans Hornets the following year."
