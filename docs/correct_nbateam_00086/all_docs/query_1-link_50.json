        "text": "If you’d rather stay home to watch a game than watch from the nosebleeds, Tyson Chandler would be the last one to understand.\n\nHe was 12 years old when his uncle took him to his first Lakers game at the Great Western Forum. It’s either a credit to Chandler’s early growth spurt or a testament to the ticket price when he remembers his outstretched fingers could scrape the ceiling from his seat, which was in the second-to-last row.\n\nHe and his uncle snuck down from the rafters as the game went on – “You can’t do that no more,” he recently observed of Staples Center, “the security’s a little tighter here,” – to get a closer look at the Lakers. During a timeout, his uncle unsuccessfully tried to coax him to run on the court and attempt a dunk, saying he was “gonna be put on the map.”\n\nIt’s been 24 years since then, and Chandler is glad he passed up the scheme – he thinks it would’ve been dug up in some ancient video archive by now if he had gone through with it. Still, he thinks about that first game often.\n\n“Every single time I put on this jersey, or every single time I get on this court, I think about that kid who might be up there playing,” he said. “And that’s who I play for, I play for the little, young 12-year-old me.”\n\nChandler has a reputation as a wizened veteran 18 seasons into his pro career – Kobe Bryant recently painted an arresting image by calling him “the black Gandalf.” But he still exudes some of the qualities of that 12-year-old fan: When he celebrated a game-saving blocked shot against the Atlanta Hawks last month, the youthful exuberance was written all over his face as he flexed and bumped chests with LeBron James.\n\nBefore he joined the Lakers, he felt something else that traces back to his past: anxiety.\n\nEver since 2001, when he was selected then traded by the Clippers on draft night, Chandler has been surprisingly wary of returning to Los Angeles. But it’s easier to appreciate when remembering the context: Since he was a 6-foot-11 eighth-grader, Chandler was thrust into the national spotlight – one of the biggest high school sensations of the prep-to-pro era, and bathed in the celebrity and sometimes scandal of the Southern California basketball scene.\n\nFor a long time, Chandler acknowledges, he was anxious about playing for a hometown team. But it feels like the right moment, he said, to finally come back now that so much time has passed.\n\nTURNING HEADS\n\nWhether he dunks during the timeouts at Lakers games or not, a 12-year-old who can dunk does not stay anonymous for long.\n\nEven though he spent a good chunk of his childhood in the Central Valley, working on his grandparents’ farm, Chandler was eventually identified as a promising young talent in San Bernardino, where he lived with his mother. Before long, he was tearing up AAU circuits, leaving high school coaches and sneaker companies to fight over who he would play for.\n\nHis high school decision, Chandler insists, was his own: He knew he wanted to go to Dominguez High in Compton after watching the team torch Crenshaw in the Martin Luther King Classic at UCLA in 1997. He can still vividly remember the details.\n\n“I just loved how live it was,” he said. “Kenny Brunner breaking the Crenshaw press, dumping it off to Jason Thomas dunking, and then Tayshaun (Prince). I knew Kenny was gonna be gone, but that I would have an opportunity to play with Jason and Tay. And Tay was honestly the reason I went to Dominguez. I wanted to play with a player at that level.”\n\nDominguez wanted him, too. This was not some unknown prospect who shuffled into the gym one day – everyone who knew SoCal basketball knew Tyson before he ever enrolled. A 60 Minutes piece on the influence of shoe companies on AAU and high school teams highlighted the eighth-grader’s game. A clip of 14-year-old Chandler dunking on a helpless boy his age can still be found on YouTube.\n\nThe 60 Minutes piece created a palpable buzz around Chandler. Prince saw his game at AAU tournaments and knew he would slide in effortlessly.\n\n“To watch him play and see some of the things he was doing, I knew he’d be a great fit for us,” Prince said. “Just the shot-blocking ability, but the ability to run the floor like a deer. Because we played fast-paced. Sometimes we’d press, sometimes we’d back off, but moreso, when we got that ball off the glass, we were gone.”\n\nOne of Chandler’s coming-out games as a freshman came in 1998 against the famed Oak Hill Academy, which had a number of classic bouts with Dominguez over the years despite the schools being on opposing coasts. In addition to being a defensive menace, Chandler forced overtime with two free throws, finishing with 14 points.\n\nBoth Chandler and Prince remember that game for the failure of a trick play, a baseline-to-baseline pass to set up a buzzer-beater that was foiled by a trigger-happy scorekeeper on the clock. But it also legitimized Chandler against a national powerhouse.\n\n“He was just so athletic, so bouncy, a competitor,” says Steve Singleton, a former coach who now leads Roosevelt High in Eastvale. “And he understood exactly what he did great. He was a great defender so he’d block a lot of shots, and he was a great athlete so he’d run and get from rim to rim all the time. So he did what he did best, and he did that great.”\n\nPrince wound up being named a McDonald’s All-American that year before heading to Kentucky. But even he admits that he had an inkling that Chandler was about to be even bigger.\n\nPREP ROCK STAR\n\nConsider the time frame: When Chandler was in high school from 1997 to 2001, Los Angeles basketball was in a platinum age.\n\nSome of the best young players in the country were coming out of L.A., such as Baron Davis and Paul Pierce. The Clippers had an exciting, high-flying team headlined by Lamar Odom, Darius Miles, Corey Maggette and Quentin Richardson. The Lakers … well, you’ve heard of Shaq and Kobe.\n\nNot only were these figures Chandler looked up to, they were people in his social orbit, who he played against during pick-up sessions at UCLA. They were his friends.\n\n“It was really the L.A. guys who really took me under their wing, like ‘You’re the next one coming,’ ” he said. “And then I started to meet more pros, like Shaq, invited me to Laker games. I was close with Darius Miles, just got drafted and went over to the Clippers. Because I was in the mix, I started to run into a lot of pro guys.”\n\nBy accounts from the time, Chandler lived large, considering he was still officially an amateur: Several stories written about him in high school point out that he drove a Cadillac Escalade, and he could hit up pros for NBA tickets. Chandler didn’t talk about the extravagance of those days for this story (he said he never saw any stories about himself in high school except the 60 Minute piece), but he acknowledged it was an exciting life.\n\nIn turn, Chandler breathed an energy into Dominguez games. At home games, long lines for entry and huge crowds of college and NBA scouts were the norm. Chandler’s favorite fans were the family of now-NFL cornerback Richard Sherman: “They were the best supporters I’ve ever seen in my life. They kept it jumpin’ with all the paraphernalia, and Dominguez colors and all of that.”\n\nEven on the road, a lot of people came to see Chandler, who by then was expected to be a prep-to-pro prospect. People wanted to see the Next Big Thing before he made his way to the league.\n\n“Having Tyson on the team, he was a rock star,” Singleton said. “Our team was very good and we had a lot of good players on there, a lot of Division I guys. But Tyson was definitely the headliner. So game days, people would be lined up to try to get autographs before and after games.”\n\nChandler delivered on the hype: As a junior, he averaged 20 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks per game for the Dons when they claimed a Division II CIF State title and were named national champions. He was a Parade All-American for the way he could reject shots on one end and flush dunks on the other.\n\nChandler said he never lost himself in the hype, however. Even with forces pulling on him – money, influencers, NBA friends – he tried to stay grounded. He insists that no one really took advantage of him when he was in high school, that he went in with both eyes open.\n\nStill, if he could give advice to his high school self, it would be this: Be patient. He rarely lost in high school, but defeat was still crushing. If he could go back, he says he would go easier on himself.\n\n“You gotta enjoy your moments through life, because it happens and it’s gone in the blink of an eye,” he said. “I would just tell myself, encourage myself to just be patient. Don’t look to the future, just enjoy right now. “\n\nCHANCE TO RECONNECT\n\nIf you know much about this era of L.A. high school basketball, you know that Dominguez’s success was not a storybook run – an unconscionable evil lurked at the very top of the program.\n\nThe man who coached the Dons through that meteoric rise was Russell Otis: He was the architect of three of the four seasons when Chandler was at Dominguez, including the national championship in 2000. But during Chandler’s senior year, he was ousted and put on trial after a former player accused him of molestation. Otis was in and out of court for the next decade, acquitted on that particular charge, but convicted on a separate charge in a similar incident in 2009.\n\nThat pall hung over the program in Chandler’s final year, as well as the years following when Otis returned to Dominguez following his initial acquittal. It’s an unspoken asterisk next to the Dons’ record during that era. Neither Prince nor Chandler delved into the case itself for this story.\n\nBut Chandler did admit it bothers him that association exists. When he thinks of those teams, he thinks of his brotherhood with his teammates, of hours of sweat that he and his peers put into their games. It hurts him that what the kids did right is eclipsed by what the adult did wrong.\n\n“It’s overshadowed by a lot of the negative things during that time and during that era,” he said. “But I don’t think you can take away a lot of the things we accomplished as a high school team. I feel like we were one of the greatest high school teams of all time, to be quite honest.”\n\nThere is a generation of Dominguez athletes who are inclined to agree: The ones who now inhabit the halls of the Compton campus. In the administrative offices, there are still news clippings of Chandler, current Dons coach Jonathan Davis said.\n\nBut the main attraction is a mural painted on the outside wall: On it are painted Prince, Sherman and Chandler, dressed for the teams for whom they won championships. It’s common knowledge at Dominguez that Chandler won a 2011 NBA title with the Dallas Mavericks, and that he won a gold medal with Team USA.\n\nFor those students, Chandler’s star is in their eyes.\n\n“For the kids here, it’s really good because they get a chance to see a hometown hero, somebody who came here, walked down the same halls that they walked down, played on the same court that they played on and see he made it out of here,” Davis said. “He was one of the ones who was able to make it from this school.”\n\nIt’s a question of when Chandler will make it back. He intends to, he said, but his personal connections to Dominguez have dwindled over the years. Still, he wants to see the mural. He wants to meet the kids.\n\nThe feeling is mutual, Davis said.\n\n“All the kids were going crazy like, ‘Tyson’s back here,’ ” he said. “They were all hoping that he could come to a game and come back and check him out and stuff. They’d love if he came back around.”\n\nTIMING FEELS RIGHT\n\nThe NBA schedule can move in mysterious ways, but on the early November night Chandler learned he was getting bought out by Phoenix, it felt like fate that Prince happened to be in town.\n\nPrince now works in the front office of the Memphis Grizzlies, who were getting ready to play the Suns the next night. After Chandler shared the news that he would soon be moving on, the two met at a True Foods Kitchen near Prince’s hotel.\n\nBy then, Chandler had a strong inkling that the Lakers would scoop him up as soon as he cleared waivers. The former teammates started to talk. They started to remember. They started to wonder what going back to L.A. would be like.\n\nPrince is like a brother to Chandler. He trusts him implicitly.\n\n“I wanted to get his opinion on what it was gonna be like coming back to L.A. at this point in my career, how he felt, his thoughts, dealing with family, friends, outside noise, everything,” Chandler said. “And I think we both came to (the conclusion) that at this point in my life, you’re able to control things a little better, and even yourself and your head, and where you can focus your energy.”\n\nOn that draft night back in 2001, Chandler was initially hurt when the Clippers selected him No. 2 overall then traded him away (for Elton Brand). He thought it would be fun to play with his friend Miles, and be a part of the rejuvenated franchise that was creating a buzz in L.A.\n\n“I thought we could really do something fun,” he said. “They already had the city on fire with that whole young crew. I was like, I can add to it, and I know I’m a winner, so I can turn this thing. Glad it didn’t happen though, after hearing all this (former owner Donald) Sterling (expletive) that was going on.”\n\nAs things turned out, Chandler wouldn’t have changed any of it. When he got to Chicago, he was mentored by the likes of Charles Oakley, who helped shape the professionalism that now is Chandler’s calling card. He doesn’t think that would’ve happened the same way back in L.A.\n\n“I think now is an appropriate time,” he said. “I honestly never really wanted to play in L.A. until this point in my career for that reason: too many distractions and I felt like it would get in the way.”\n\nIt seems almost too neat, too on-the-nose: He’s alongside James, one of the best players ever, for the team he’s rooted for since he first touched the top of the Great Western Forum. It feels charmed, but Chandler is just trying to enjoy it.\n\nPrince marvels still that although Chandler was three years behind him in school, he entered the NBA before him, and somehow is still playing now that Prince is retired. But he’s also excited to see Chandler living out a better story than the one he first put together 18 years ago.\n\n“It couldn’t have happened to a better person, Tyson is an ultimate pro in every sense of that word,” he said. “Just an awesome guy.”\n\nPrince took a second to laugh.\n\n“I taught him well.”\n\nStaff writer Adam Grosbard contributed reporting to this story."
