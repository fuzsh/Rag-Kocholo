The Great Gildersleeve was a vastly popular radio show starring Harold Peary that followed the comical exploits of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve. A spin-off character from the Fibber McGee and Molly Show, Gildersleeve was broadcast from 1941 to 1957 and was so well-received that Peary reprised the role in four motion pictures and three phonograph albums of children's stories in the 1940s. With Willard Waterman in the title role, 39 episodes were produced for NBC TV in 1955.
