Everybody goes for Velveeta's rich yet mild cheddar cheese flavor, in snacks and sandwiches and in hot dishes. And hidden in that swell cheese flavor are important nutrients from milk. That's why smart homemakers keep Velveeta on hand regularly to spread or slice, and to melt for grand economical hot dishes. Tomorrow, get VELVEETA, the cheese food of Kraft quality!\n\nMUSIC:\n\nTheme playout\n\nANNCR:\n\nIt's seldom you find the Great Gildersleeve sitting in a movie, unless there's an added attraction.

Well, then? I'll hold YOUR hand! (chuckle)\n\nADELINE:\n\nAll right?\n\nGILDY:\n\n(Sigh) Nice Title - \"Love is Love.\"\n\nADELINE: I know you'll just ADORE Anthony Dane!\n\nGILDY:\n\nAnthony Dane?

I've chewed all I had to keep awake.\n\nADELINE:\n\nCan't you get some from at Mr. Peavey's? I'd love a soda.\n\nGILDY:\n\nIt's pretty late, Adeline.

Three long years!\n\nMUSIC:\n\nTRANSITION\n\nSFX:\n\nFOOTSTEPS\n\nADELINE:\n\nYou know, Throckmorton, I really shouldn't be coming up to a man's office at this hour.\n\nGILDY:\n\nWhy not? A man has to have cigars.\n\nADELINE:\n\nWell, if the queen's tenant went to the fountain with Anthony unchaperoned, then I guess I could go to the water department with you! (GIGGLES)\n\nGILDY:\n\nYeah, you know, come to think of it, I've never really shown you around here, have I, Adeline?\n\nADELINE:\n\nNo, you haven't.\n\nSFX:\n\nKEY IN LOCK\n\nADELINE:\n\nOh, wasn't Anthony wonderful?

Like Anthony Dane's did in the dream years in the New World?\n\nGILDY:\n\nI've been in the New World quite a while, and it hasn't turned gray yet. But it will, Adeline, if you don't stop talking about Anthony, the Great Dane.\n\nADELINE:\n\nOh, I'm sorry, Throckmorton. I HAVE been neglecting you, haven't I?\n\nGILDY:\n\n(WOUNDED) That's all right - we'll get my cigars out of the drawer and we'll go home.\n\nADELINE:\n\nOh, now, Throckmorton, don't be so sensitive!

Let's go.\n\nADELINE:\n\nBessie?\n\nGILDY:\n\nMy secretary.\n\nADELINE:\n\nYou know, I think I'm a little jealous of your secretary, Throckmorton. Gettin' to spend all day with you. I think I'd like to trade places with her.\n\nGILDY:\n\nHuh? Well ? You'd probably be more efficient than Bessie. I don't think we'd get much work done, heh, heh, heh.\n\nADELINE:\n\nOh, you!

New secretary!\n\nADELINE:\n\nWell, really, I --\n\nGILDY:\n\nNow, Miss Fairchild, never interrupt the mayor.\n\nMAYOR:\n\nThat's all right.

She was grossly incompetent, and you know it.\n\nGILDY:\n\nBut-\n\nMAYOR:\n\nI know you hated to let her go, but an executive has to be hard at times, for the good of the city.\n\nGILDY:\n\nOh, yes! For the good of the city.\n\nMAYOR:\n\nWhy, I wouldn't even hesitate to fire you, Gildersleeve, for the good of the city.\n\nGILDY:\n\nOh, well! We wouldn't want that to happen.\n\nADELINE:\n\nBut Mayor Terwilliger-\n\nGILDY:\n\nErrh, Good-evening, Miss Fairchild!\n\nMAYOR:\n\nWell, I'll say goodnight now, and stop by in the morning when you're not so busy.\n\nGILDY:\n\nIn the morning?\n\nMAYOR:\n\nI always like to get acquainted with our new employees.

Kraft's nutritious cheese food Velveeta is a natural for such light bedtime suppers. It's rich yet mild cheddar cheese flavor hits the spot at any hour. And you can let the folks lice its golden goodness thick, for Velveeta is as digestible as milk itself. And it's wonderfully nutritious too. But Velveeta is more than just a snacktime treat. It's a boon for main dishes too. For instance, rich, satin-smooth Velveeta sauce adds a tantalizing glow to leftovers,, seafood, vegetables, and egg dishes. And to make that sauce is as easy as A-B-C. Simply melt one-half pound of Velveeta in the top of your double boiler. Then stir in one-fourth cup of milk and season to taste. There you have it - a lickin' good cheese sauce that makes the simplest dish extra- appetizing. Get in several extra packages of Velveeta tomorrow. Or, buy the big economical 2-pound loaf. For top flavor, for top cooking quality, for fine food value, get genuine Velveeta , the cheese food of famous Kraft quality.\n\nMUSC:\n\nTheme\n\nANNCR:\n\nWell, it's been a rough day for the water commissioner, and it's getting rougher. The great man has sent Bessie home until he figures out his secretary problems, and he's working on them right now - under a hot towel in Floyd's barbershop.\n\nGILDY:\n\n(to himself) I could have Bessie dye her hair blonde, like Adeline's.

Ummmm, how'd they get in such bad shape, Commish?\n\nGildy:\n\nHuh?\n\nFloyd:\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't stand for it, workin' day and night like you do down at the office.\n\nGildy:\n\n(SUSPICUOUS) What's this, Floyd?\n\nFloyd:\n\nWhy, I even hear it takes TWO secretaries to keep up with you!\n\nGildy:\n\nWhat?\n\nFloyd:\n\nOne for during the day, and one at night. Heh heh heh heh?\n\nGildy:\n\nI see Hooker has been here! Now get this straight, Floyd , I have only one secretary and that's Bessie.\n\nFloyd:\n\nOh yeah? Then who was that the mayor caught you with up at the water department last night -- a mermaid from your reservoir?\n\nGildy:\n\nFloyd, Miss Fairchild and I stopped by my office to get some cigars after a movie. That's the truth!\n\nFloyd:\n\nUh - huh.\n\nGildy:\n\nNow, Floyd!\n\nFloyd:\n\nCouldn't you feed the mayor a better story than that, Commish? Like - you was waitin' for a streetcar?\n\nGildy:\n\nIt's all a horrible misunderstanding, Floyd! They mayor assumed Adeline was my new secretary , and now he's coming back ?at one o'clock? to have a talk with her.\n\nFloyd: Oh yeah? What're you gonna do, Commish?\n\nGildy:\n\nWhat would YOU do, Floyd?\n\nFloyd:\n\nI'd HIRE her!\n\nGildy:\n\nWhat??\n\nFloyd:\n\nI'd LIKE to have a classy dame like Miss Fairchild around here! To sharpen scissors, and stuff.. Hehehehehe?\n\nGildy:\n\nThat's silly, Floyd! I can't let Bessie go. Besides, Adeline knows NOTHING about stenographic work.\n\nFloyd:\n\nSo what! Put her on the city payroll, what've you got to lose!\n\nGildy:\n\nOnly my JOB, that's all.\n\nFloyd:\n\nOh yeah, that's right?\n\nFX:\n\nScissors\n\nFloyd:\n\nHey! Hey, why don't you have her come down at one o'clock and save your hide and then let her go!\n\nGildy:\n\nNo, Floyd. That's ridiculous. Get me out of here.\n\nFloyd:\n\nWhy not?\n\nGildy:\n\nThat would be gross misrepresentation. Not only that it would be dishonest and unethical and I won't do it!\n\nMUSIC:\n\nTransition\n\nFX:\n\nPhone ringing\n\nGildy:\n\nHmmm. Adeline doesn't answer.\n\nFX: Hang up\n\nGildy:\n\nWell, I'm kind of glad. I'd hate to be dishonest and unethical like that Floyd.\n\nMUSIC:\n\nTransition\n\nSFX:\n\nDOOR OPENS\n\nGILDY:\n\n(SIGHS) Hello, Peavey\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nHello, Mr. Gildersleeve. How are things with you today?\n\nGILDY:\n\nI have a splitting headache. Everything's been going wrong today, Peavey, from the time I got up this morning.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nI'm sorry to hear that. I woke up quite pleasantly this morning to the scent of lilacs coming in through the window.\n\nGILDY:\n\nI didn't sleep at well. I didn't feel like eating breakfast-\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nI'm very fond of lilacs\n\nGILDY:\n\nEverything went wrong at the office -\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nSo is Mrs. Peavey.\n\nGILDY:\n\nWhat?\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nFond of lilacs.\n\nGILDY:\n\nOh, my goodness, Peavey. We're not talking about lilacs!\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nI am.\n\nGILDY:\n\nAlright. Go ahead and talk about 'em.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nI've BEEN talking about 'em.\n\nGILDY:\n\nPeavey, I came in here with a headache, and it's getting no better fast.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nWell, that's too bad Mr. Gildersleeve, why didn't you say so?\n\nGILDY:\n\nI DID! But you were too busy talking about lilacs!\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nWell, I happen to LIKE lilacs.\n\nGILDY:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nAnd so does Mrs. Peavey.\n\nGILDY: So you told me. Give me an aspirin, Peavey, and a glass of water. Make it two aspirin.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nMy! You ARE upset.\n\nGILDY:\n\nYou'd be upset, too, Peavey, if you had my troubles. You're lucky you don't have the mayor to contend with.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nYou're right there, Mr. Gildersleeve.\n\nGILDY:\n\nYou're lucky you don't have secretary trouble.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nI wouldn't say that. Sometimes I get a little envious when I hear about you fellows with your secretaries.\n\nGILDY:\n\nOh? What have you heard, Peavey?\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nDruggists don't repeat everything they hear, Mr. Gildersleeve. Code of ethics, you know.\n\nGILDY:\n\nCode of ethics. No matter what you've heard, I can explain it.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nYou don't have to explain anything to me, Mr. Gildersleeve.\n\nGILDY:\n\nThe judge has been in here telling you about the trouble I've been in, hasn't he?\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nWell, I can't say that he has.\n\nGILDY:\n\nHe has, Peavey, and you know it.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nYes I know it, but I can't say it. Code of ethics you know.\n\nGILDY:\n\nCode of ethics. I don't care what you've heard, Peavey, the only thing I'm worried about is what I'm going to tell the mayor at one o'clock.\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nYou care for another aspirin?\n\nGILDY:\n\nNo, it's too big of a problem for another aspirin. Peavey, I respect your opinions. What do you think I should do?\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nNow, that's a question. There's an old saying, \"he who dances must pay the fiddler.\"\n\nGILDY:\n\nBut Peavey, there's been no dancing and no fiddling!\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nPretty sound advice. There's another one: \"he who plays with fire?\"\n\nGILDY:\n\nOh, I give up!\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nDon't you want to hear the rest of it?\n\nGILDY:\n\nI've know the rest of it. I've read your almanac.\n\nPEAVY:\n\nWhat?\n\nSFX:\n\nSTEPS TO DOOR. DOOR OPENS\n\nGILDY:\n\n(WALKS OFF MIC AS HE SPEAKS) So long, Poor Richard! Thanks for the aspirin!\n\nSFX:\n\nDOOR CLOSES\n\nPEAVEY:\n\nHmmph. All that advice and he didn't buy a thing. I think I'll take an aspirin myself.\n\nMUSIC:\n\nTRANSITION\n\nGILDY:\n\nJudge, what do you mean by spreading this stuff all over town?\n\nHooker:\n\nNow now, Gildy, calm down! You wouldn't be in any trouble at all if you had told the mayor the truth when you should have.\n\nGildy:\n\nWell, I tried to, but he gave me such a good excuse that I couldn't pass it up.\n\nHooker:\n\nUh huh. Now then my advice to you is to go back and tell the mayor EXACTLY what happened - that you stepped up to the office for a cigar right after the show.\n\nGildy:\n\nBut you know the mayor -- he's very excitable, Judge. He's liable to fire me right on the spot!\n\nHooker:\n\nWell, you're going to have to take that chance. And if your REALLY want to make an impression, you won't wait for the mayor to come to you - you'll go to him!\n\nGildy:\n\nWhat?\n\nHooker:\n\nMarch right into his office like a little soldier and say your piece. Beard the lion in his den!\n\nGildy:\n\nWell, uhhh, I don't like the way you put it, judge, but - I'll do it.\n\nMUSIC:\n\nFunereal transition\n\nGildy:\n\nBeard the lion in his den! I wonder if the lion's been fed? Welll?\n\nFX:\n\nDoor opens\n\nGILDY:\n\n(meek) Good afterno-Is the lion --- is the mayor in?\n\nSECRETARY:\n\nMr. Gildersleeve, come in.\n\nGILDY:\n\n(A LITTLE HOARSE) Thank you.\n\nSEC:\n\nLaryngitis, Mr. Gildersleeve?\n\nGILDY:\n\nOh, no. I don't think so. Although it has been a little damp in the water department. Heh heh. Is the mayor in?\n\nSEC:\n\nI expect him back shortly. He went to lunch with a lady. The mayor was very busy this morning - cleaning house.\n\nGILDY:\n\nCleaning house?\n\nSEC:\n\nHe's been on quite a rampage. I'm afraid we're losing some of our personnel.\n\nGILDY:\n\nOh.\n\nSEC:\n\nHe's due at your office at one o'clock.\n\nGILDY:\n\nWell, yes, but I, uh-\n\nMAYOR:\n\n(OFF) Well, Gildersleeve, there you are.\n\nGILDY:\n\nOh, uh, yes, Mr. Mayor, here I am.\n\nMAYOR:\n\nWell, this saves me the trouble of going to your office to tell you what I have to say.\n\nGILDY (Well I--)\n\nMAYOR:\n\nI found out a few things since I talked to you last.\n\nGILDY:\n\nYou have? Well, if it has anything to do with my new secretary-\n\nMAYOR:\n\nIt has EVERYTHING to do with your new secretary. And Gildersleeve, this calls for a change in the water department.\n\nGILDY:\n\nEeee?\n\nMAYOR:\n\nI will not tolerate people who are undependable, frivolous, and who shirk their responsibility.\n\nGILDY:\n\n(LOW) That's me?\n\nMAYOR:\n\nNow then, about this new blonde secretary of yours, this Miss Fairchild.\n\nGILDY:\n\nYes?\n\nMAYOR:\n\nOn the way back from lunch, you know what I discovered?\n\nGILDY:\n\n(NERVOUS LAUGH)\n\nMAYOR:\n\nShe was going into a movie on city time!\n\nGILDY:\n\nTo a movie?\n\nMAYOR:\n\nSome ridiculous picture called \"Love is Love.\" Gildersleeve, you have to let her go. Fire her!\n\nGILDY:\n\nFire her? Weeeell, if you say so, Mr. Mayor. Yeeees!\n\nMAYOR:\n\nWhat are you laughing at, Gildersleeve?\n\nGILDY:\n\nNothing, nothing. Good old Anthony Dane.\n\nMUSIC:\n\nUP\n\nANNCR:\n\nWe'll hear from the Great Gildersleeve again very shortly.\n\nANNCR:\n\nDo you know how to transform a little leftover meat into a main dish with real prestige? You do it with Kraft's smooth-melting cheese food, Velveeta. Simply melt Velveeta for a wonderful cheese sauce, then pour it generously over leftover ham, chicken, or veal, and serve on toast or in patty shells. What a sparkling flavorful way to make your meat dollars go further! Velveeta's rich yet mild cheddar cheese flavor gives sandwiches an air of importance, too! Serve Velveeta plain or melted in a tempting golden-hot sandwich. Any way you serve Velveeta, it helps supply high quality complete protein and other milk nutrients. Get Velveeta in the big, economical 2 pound loaf so you'll have plenty for snacks, sandwiches, and main dishes.\n\nMUSIC:\n\nup to finish\n\nGildy:\n\nYe Gods, Bessie! I got your job back for you. Now stop daydreaming - let's get on with the work!\n\nBessie:\n\nI'm sorry, Mr. Gildersleeve. I was just thinking about my vacation at the Grand Canyon.\n\nGildy:\n\nVacations come in August, Bessie - let's buckle down. Here it is nearly five o'clock. We'll never get these reports to the mayor.\n\nBessie:\n\nMr. Gildersleeve, may I make a suggestion?\n\nGildy:\n\nWhat is it, Bessie?\n\nBessie:\n\nWhy don't we come back tonight and work?\n\nGildy:\n\nWhooaa - not THAT!\n\nMUSIC:\n\nUP\n\nANNCR:\n\nThe Great Gildersleeve is played by Harold Peary. Adeline Fairchild by Miss Una Merkel. The show was written by John Elliott and Andy White with music by Jack Eagan.

I'd just like to remind everyone that Unite States Security Bonds are a mighty good investment, both for our country's future, and for YOUR future. You get 4 dollars back for every 3 you put in. Folks, buy those bonds regularly.\n\nANNCR:\n\nThank you, Hal.
