A pompous bachelor takes domestic charge of his young niece and nephew in the fictional town of Summerfield. 30-minute episodes.\n\nAired: On NBC Red Network, Sundays at 6:30 PM, later, Wednesdays 8:30 PM. From 8/31/41 - 6/2/54\n\nProgram Sponsor: The Kraft Food Company\n\nMain Characters/Players:\n\nThrockmorton P. Gildersleeve played by Harold Peary, and later Willard Waterman\n\nMarjorie Forrester played by Lurene Tuttle, and later Louise Erickson\n\nLeroy Forrester played by Walter Tetley\n\nBirdie Lee Coggins played by Lillian Randolph (with sister Amanda Randolph filling in)\n\nJudge Horace Hooker played by Earle Ross\n\nRichard Peavey played by Richard LeGrand\n\nFloyd Munson played by Arthur Q. Bryan\n\nRadio Show History\n\nActor Harold Peary was a much appreciated talent on the old Harold Peary radio series, \"Fibber McGee and Molly\". Over the course of time, he played a number of different characters, like a butcher or a delivery man. Eventually, the writers created the character of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve for Peary to portray. Stuffy \"G\n\nildy\" was the next-door neighbor of the McGee's, so now Peary could portray the major plot point in some episodes. But even this major supporting role was not enough to contain the actor's talents. So in 1941, \"The Great Gildersleeve\" spun-off into his very own radio series. With a dedicated program, Harold Peary and his writers greatly expanded the depths of the Gildersleeve character. The show ran for 13 years (1941-1954), with over 550 shows produced. There were also four \"official\" Gildersleeve movies, and Peary appeared as Gildersleeve in a number of other films. In the fifties there was a \"Great Gildersleeve\" TV series, which ran for one season and resulted in 39 episodes. However, it was not Peary who appeared in the TV series. Back in 1950, Peary's agent saw an opportunity to better his client's deal. He moved Peary from NBC to CBS. Unfortunately, the agent didn't cover all the bases of the deal, as CBS found they could not put him on as \"The Great Gildersleeve\", NBC still owned the rights to the character. They got Peary but not \"The Great Gildersleeve\" program. So CBS created a different series for Peary to play in, titled \"Honest Harold\". Starting on September 6, 1950, Peary's old friend continued the Gildersleeve character successfully for the remaining four years of its run, then onto the year-run of the television series. Harold Peary showed up two years after that as Mayor LaTrivia on the TV version of \"Fibber McGee and Molly\".\n\nThe Sponsor\n\nIn those days, radio networks covered cost by giving exclusive commercial time in a particular program to one sponsor. The Kraft Food Company was the proud sponsor of THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE, and J.L. Kraft seemed to be a deeply religious man who believed in the strong foundation of family values. It would seem that his beliefs influenced the show in the direction of spiritual values and the rewards of \"doing the right thing\". And it worked! As amusing as the episodes are, one cannot help but notice how THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE makes a very gentle yet convincing case for the benefits of \"living right\".\n\nUnlike many other forgotten sponsors heard from old time radio, The Kraft Food Company is still going strong. In the programs you can hear ads for Kraft Velveeta Cheese and \"Kraft Dinner\" (now known as Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Dinner). These products remain highly popular going into the 21st Century. A few years back they offered \"Kraft Charlie Brown Christmas Macaroni and Cheese Dinner\". You know, if they shaped those noodles into little Gildy and Leroy heads.....\n\nGildersleeve Outside the Show\n\nIt is fortunate that THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE came at a time when RKO Pictures was on a \"radio stars on the big screen\" craze. Harold Peary portrayed the Gildersleeve character in five films by the time Gildy got his own show.\n\nWhen THE GREAT GILDERSLEEVE program became popular, RKO produced four official Gildersleeve movies: The Great Gildersleeve, Gildersleeve's Bad Day, Gildersleeve On Broadway and Gildersleeve's Ghost. These films have occasional airings on American Movie Classics and Turner Classics Network from time to time, but have never been available on home video in any format. If you click on the film titles you will see that not all the radio performers got to take their character to the big screen.\n\nGildersleeve Tales\n\nPeary also took the Gildersleeve character to other radio shows and also did some children's recordings, where he reads classic fairy tales \"as The Great Gildersleeve\". I personally acquired the 78's set where he reads \"Puss in Boots\", \"Rumpelstiltskin\" and \"Jack & the Beanstalk\".\n\nLabels\n\nWhile doing research for an article I came across an unexpected search result: \"Was Jack Benny Gay?\" There was no more than the question as previously stated from the original poster, but the replies made for interesting reading, ranging from: Jack Benny Celebrating his 39th Birthday \"Of course not, he was a well known skirt-chaser in his youth, and he was married to Mary Livingston for many years\" \"Sure he was, everyone in Hollywood with the possible exception of John Wayne was and is homosexual!\" \"Part of Benny's \"schtick\" was his limp-wristed hand-to-face gestures. He was not gay, but emphasized what his fans observed as \"acting like a girl\" for humor. While heterosexual Benny tried to gay it up, many really gay actors or comedians in those days tried to act as \"straight\" as they could muster.\" \"... the idea behind his character was to have him a little on the ambiguous side.

During the Golden Age of Radio , \"transcribed\" programs were recorded and sent to stations or networks on a disc running at 16 rps. The discs are larger than 33 1/3s. \"Transcribed\" means it was recorded on a disc. \"Recorded\" was a term that was known, of course, but not used very much in Radio's Golden Age. During the era, it was also considered very important to distinguish which shows went out live and which were recorded (transcribed), so if a show was transcribed it was announced as such. \"Transcribed\" was a colloquialism of the era. One reason they came up with it was because there was still enough skittishness about recording that \"pre-recorded\" sounded a little obscene inside the industry. CBS and NBC were live through the '30s and '40s. Yet line transcriptions were made for either the sponsor or its ad agency."
