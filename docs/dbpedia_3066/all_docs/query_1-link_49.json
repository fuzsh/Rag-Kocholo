        "text": "Like any oft-repeated contention about Star Trek breaking television precedent, we have to ask the question — is it true? Is any of it true? Did “Where No Man Has Gone Before” truly mark the first time a prospective series had a second pilot episode? Was NBC really the first television network to order a second pilot after rejecting the first one? Did the move actually cause \"quite a stir within the industry,\" as first claimed in The Making of Star Trek?\n\nContemporary accounts in newspapers and trade magazines are helpful in answering these questions. Consider the following, from the Los Angeles Times:\n\nDesilu is reshooting two pilot films. Star Trek, which reportedly cost $500,000 the first time around, is being filmed again without Jeffrey Hunter. The Good Old Days is undergoing script and premise revisions and will be shot a second time with another actor replacing Darryl Hickman.[3]\n\nThe passage above was not the lead in the newspaper's regular \"Inside TV\" column — that was dedicated to announcing the series that would become Green Acres (1965-71). The news about Star Trek's second pilot was buried in the column's fourth paragraph and, notably, was announced alongside the news that another Desilu program for NBC was also receiving a second pilot and recasting its lead.\n\nNine days later, Weekly Variety covered the same story in a little more detail:\n\nTwo Desilu pilots shot for next season, but not sold, may yet be aired.\n\nNBC-TV has okayed production of a second seg of \"Star Trek,\" hour-long sci-fi series, and William Shatner will replace Jeffrey Hunter as the lead in this projected series. Web has also okayed three more scripts, and is interested in \"Trek\" for a mid-season or 1966-67 start. Second seg rolls around July 5, with Gene Roddenberry, who produced the first one, producing it.\n\nSecond Desilu pilot involved is \"The Good Old Days,\" half-hour comedy starring Darryl Hickman. NBC-TV, for which it was made, and Desilu execs are talking of the possibility of reshooting this pilot, and there may be a change in its cast if this is done.[4]\n\nBuried on the bottom of page 167, the news about Star Trek wasn't treated as a prominent story by Weekly Variety, either. And, once again, it was covered alongside the news that another Desilu series for NBC was being slated for a second pilot. In light of this information, the claim that “Where No Man Has Gone Before“ was causing \"quite a stir within the [entertainment] industry\" seems dubious at best.\n\nHaving established these facts, however, we could find no evidence in the Hollywood trades that a second pilot was actually produced for The Good Old Days, a proposed half-hour sitcom \"about a caveman who goes searching for adventure.\" Does that mean “Where No Man Has Gone Before” really was the first time a second pilot was produced for a single series — or, at least, the first time the same network ordered a second pilot after rejecting the first one?\n\nStrike One, Pilot Two\n\nThe answer is a resounding no — not even close. What follows is a chronological list of ten pilot episodes that were rejected, but followed by a second pilot episode. Not all of these second pilots became series (such is the nature of television pilots, most don't sell), but all of them were produced before Gene Roddenberry began developing Star Trek at Desilu.\n\nThis list should not be viewed as comprehensive or exhaustive. If there are other programs with second (or even third) pilot episodes that do not appear here — especially if they were produced before 1965 — we’d love to hear about them.\n\nLum and Abner (Pilots: 1948, 1949, 1951, 1956)\n\nThe earliest program we’ve found with a second pilot is, so far, the pilot king of this list. Lum and Abner was a successful and long-running (1931-1954) radio comedy program on CBS, which had been adapted for a series of six feature films (1940-1946) before it was piloted four times in eight years…and the fourth attempt yielded three episodes!\n\nThe first Lum and Abner TV pilot was filmed for CBS in 1948 and tried to emulate the daily fifteen-minute format of the radio show...CBS president William S. Paley supposedly like it but felt that the market for fifteen-minute television programs was rapidly going to disappear. He commissioned a second pilot, which was filmed during the summer of 1949.[5]\n\nThe first Lum and Abner pilot is not available, but the second pilot can be seen online. Surprisingly, after rejecting the second, half-hour pilot late in 1949, CBS decided to try again and made a third television pilot about a year later:\n\nA third Lum and Abner pilot actually made it onto CBS' airwaves in February 1951...Although the pilot received favorable reviews after its airing, it still did not lead to a series.[6]\n\nA few years later, the fourth attempt to launch a Lum and Abner television series resulted in three half-hour episodes filmed in late 1954 and early 1955, but these trio of segments for a proposed series were never broadcast. Instead, they were hastily spliced together into the ersatz theatrical feature Lum and Abner Abroad (1956), which was released theatrically to poor reviews.\n\nFibber McGee and Molly (Pilots: 1954 and 1959)\n\nLike Lum and Abner, Fibber McGee and Molly was an attempt to bring a successful radio program to television, having been broadcast on NBC radio from 1935 until 1959. The network twice attempted to develop the property for television. Their first effort was a half-hour pilot produced in early 1954:\n\nNBC signed Frank Tashlin to produce and direct a pair of pilot telefilms for the \"Fibber McGee and Molly\" and \"Great Gildersleeve\" shows which the network owns. He reports next week and expects to finish the assignment by the end of February.[7]\n\nVariety reported that sponsors were bidding on the pilot in May of 1954, but a series failed to materialize. Two years later, Weekly Variety reported that a second pilot was in the works:\n\nJim and Marion Jordan are once again interested in a television version of \"Fibber & Molly\" and a second pilot may be coming along soon...[8]\n\nInterest, apparently, took a while to develop into action, but three years later the second pilot was finally ready to go before the cameras:\n\nAs a video entry, F & M will have Bob Sweeney and Cathy Lewis playing the lead roles. Pilot is being shot this month in Hollywood with Bill Lawrence as producer.[9]\n\nThe second attempt to bring Fibber McGee and Molly to television was only a little more successful than the first. Although it became a weekly series produced by William Asher for NBC, it only lasted twelve episodes before being canceled.\n\nTombstone Territory (Pilots: Both 1957)\n\nFrom 1948 until 1960, Ziv Televisions Program, Inc. was a major supplier of syndicated television, sold directly to local television stations to fill out their schedules. Ziv also employed Gene Roddenberry early in his career, hiring him to write scripts for series including Mr. District Attorney, I Led Three Lives, Highway Patrol, Dr. Christian, Harbor Command, and West Point.\n\nBeginning in 1956, Ziv also began selling programming directly to the networks, which was the case with Tombstone Territory, a half-hour western that began its life as a pilot called Tombstone in 1957:\n\nZiv TV today rolls pilot for a new western vidpix series, “Tombstone.” Jan Merlin co-stars with Richard Eastham and Norman Foster directs.[15]\n\nDaily Variety later reported that the series had been sold to a sponsor, re-titled Gunfire Pass, and was set to appear on ABC:\n\n“Gunfire Pass,” oater [Western] series starring Richard Eastham, has been sold by Ziv TV to Bristol-Myers, and will be seen on ABC-TV next season....Pat Conway has a featured lead in “Gunfire” series, which will be based on stories of Tombstone, Ariz., produced by Frank Pittman and Andy White. The 89 episodes go into production around the first of June.[16]\n\nAlthough the sponsor (Bristol-Myers) was satisfied with this pilot, apparently ABC had second thoughts, forcing Ziv to produce a second pilot with significant revisions:\n\nFollowing reshooting and recasting of a pilot nixed by ABC-TV, Ziv TV's second pilot, called \"Tombstone Territory,\" has been okayed by the network and will be seen on ABC next season, with Bristol-Myers sponsoring.\n\nZiv had originally lensed a pilot called \"Town at Gunfire Pass,\" which BM bought, but ABC termed \"unacceptable.\" As as result, pilot was recast, with Pat Conway, who was second lead in the first pilot, upped to top lead, and the second pilot proved acceptable both to the sponsor and the network. Pilot was directed by Eddie Davis.\n\nConway plays role of a sheriff of Tombstone, while the crusading editor of the Tombstone Epitaph - originally the lead character - is now relegated to a secondary role. Series will be on Wednesday nights following \"Disneyland.\"[17]\n\nTombstone Territory's second pilot was enough to convince ABC to go forward with the series, which premiered with its second pilot episode on October 16, 1957. ABC eventually broadcast the first pilot (with a new title, “Guilt of a Town”) on March 19, 1958. Tombstone Territory lasted for three seasons and a total of 91 episodes.\n\nCollector's Item (Pilots: Both 1957)\n\nThe earliest mention of this Vincent Price-Peter Lorre television vehicle we've found is a casting item that appeared in an early 1957 issue of Daily Variety, indicating that the pilot would begin filming on January 29, 1957:\n\nJockey Billy Pearson has been cast by producer Julian Claman in pilot of \"Collector's Item,\" new telepix series 20th-Fox rolls tomorrow for CBS. Vincent Price, who appeared with Pearson on \"$64,000 Challenge\" stars in series, as does Peter Lorre.[18]\n\nVariety followed this story a few weeks later with more detail on the prospective program:\n\nAn adventure-comedy series co-starring Vincent Price and Peter Lorre called \"Collector's Item.\" This is a wholly-owned CBS property created by west coast program exec Hunt Stromberg Jr., the idea stemming from the audience excitement generated by Price's recent participation in \"$64,000 Challenge\" with Edward G. Robinson. However, this one's not a quiz show; strictly comedy with adventure overtones in which Price portrays the owner of a N.Y. art gallery with Lorre as a phony art dealer who goes to work for Price. Web's hopes are particularly high on this one.[19]\n\nA few weeks later, according to a story in the March 16, 1957 issue of The Billboard, Collector’s Item was ready to be shown to advertising agencies in New York, in search of a potential sponsor. CBS was apparently unsuccessful. However, not ready to abandon the project, CBS hired a new writing team to script a second pilot:\n\nGwen Bagni and Irwin Gielgud have been signed by CBS-TV to teleplay pilot of a new vidpix series, \"Collector's Item,\" which will star Vincent Price and Peter Lorre.[20]\n\nBagni and Gielgud did not work out, leading CBS to go with Herb Meadow instead:\n\nCBS-TV has signed Herb Meadow to a five-year pact as producer-writer and assigned him to produce its new series, \"Collector's Item,\" starring Vincent Price and Peter Lorre. Meadow scripted pilot, which rolls soon. First pilot of series, made long ago, was junked.[21]\n\nBy the end of the year, the second pilot was completed (it can be viewed in three parts here, here, and here), and CBS again went looking for a sponsor for the show:\n\nCollector's Item—Remake of last season's pilot, starring Vincent Price as an art collector who becomes embroiled in crime and mystery.[22]\n\nOnce again, the network came up empty, and the second pilot ended up on the shelf. Interestingly enough, however, this was not the last time the series would be mentioned in the Hollywood trades. About eight months later, Weekly Variety reported that CBS still thought the core idea of Collector's Item had potential, and was considering filming new episodes:\n\nThe question of what to do with shelved pilots again was being bandied around, but this time with a new twist.\n\nIf the basic idea is good, why give up the ghost if the execution didn't come off well?...\n\nCBS along with its syndication subsid, is pruning all of the unsold pilots, discarding those which it feels don't have a good basic idea. But those such as \"The City\" and \"Collector's Item,\" dealing with fraudulent art practices and starring Vincent Price, are being revived. New episodes may be shot on the latter. Reason for the approach is that what are considered basic good ideas for a series aren't too plentiful. Advertisers and agency execs will be urged to give the second tries a fresh look. Plan will be abandoned if the new pilot is met with that \"I've seen that one before\" comment, when screened along Madison Ave.[23]\n\nThere are a few more references to the potential series in late 1958, which indicate that CBS considered producing the series for syndication with a different lead, but it appears nothing came of it. As far as we can tell, neither pilot was ever broadcast.\n\nTarzan (Pilots: 1957 and 1958)\n\nEdgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan stories have been filmed on many occasions. Relevant to Star Trek is the 1966-68 television series, which featured Nichelle Nichols in two episodes and served as Star Trek's second season lead-in on NBC (to disastrous results; Tarzan went from being a top thirty show in the 1966-67 broadcast season to a canceled flop in 1967-68).\n\nPrior to both those versions, however, producer Sol Lesser twice attempted to bring the character to the small screen with veteran Tarzan actor Gordon Scott. The first attempt was made for NBC in early 1957:\n\nDeal has been finalized for NBC to be partnered with Sol Lesser in his \"Tarzan\" theatrical films under an agreement concluded with Alan Livingston, the net's program vee-pee in Hollywood. Included in the joint control is \"Tarzan and Lost Safari,\" now being released by Metro, and the library of animal and native tribe footage shot in Africa. Lesser will produce the half-hour \"Tarzan\" telepix series for NBC, with Laslo Benedek directing the first episode. Lisa Davis has femme lead opposite Gordon Scott.[24]\n\nUltimately, NBC passed on the project, but Lesser was undeterred:\n\nWith a Tarzan theatrical film now before the cameras, Sol Lesser has reactivated his plans to shoot a vidpix series based on the character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Previously, Lesser filmed a pilot with Gordon Scott and Lisa Davis co-starred but objections and a legal hassle with Commodore Productions at that time curtailed continuation of the \"Tarzan\" telefilms. Now, however, Lesser is resuming shooting on the \"Tarzan\" telepix and has already completed filming a second pilot film at Desilu-Culver.\n\nEve Brent, femme lead of the theatrical version, co-stars with Scott in the televersion. Rickie Sorensen, also in the theatrical film, will recreate his \"boy\" role in the series. Pilot, it's understood, is entitled \"Tarzan and the Trappers.\" Latter pic is now in the editing stages and will be available for agency screening shortly.[25]\n\nUnfortunately for Lesser, Tarzan and the Trappers did not sell. Following a shake-up in leadership at Lesser's company, it was decided to forgo television exploitation of Tarzan altogether:\n\nLesser had completed a pilot film for the possible introduction of Tarzan as a telepix series. However, after analyzing the costs and market potential, it was considered \"complete insanity,\" according to Howard, to go into TV. Howard's point being that it would be suicide to destroy a property which has grossed some $ 200,000,000 in 40 years. Since 1918, there have been 32 Tarzan films and, according to Howard, there has never been a loss on a Tarzan film. He said the smallest profit has been $ 500,000.[26]\n\nTarzan and the Trappers was Sol Lesser's final producing credit. The television pilot was re-edited and sold to television as a “movie,” first airing on a Fort Myers, Florida affiliate on Saturday, December 4, 1965, and repeatedly seen on television thereafter.\n\nUltimately, what can be said about “Where No Man Has Gone Before” as a second pilot is that it was unusual in 1965 — but not unprecedented. In the early history of television, when a pilot did not sell, that was most often the end of it. Cast contracts certainly had no contingency in them for second pilot episodes. Most typically, actors were signed for a pilot episode, and the studio had a limited option to continue their services — if a weekly series materialized within a set time frame. Such was the case with Star Trek, which is why Jeffrey Hunter could walk away without repercussions when he declined to do the second pilot.\n\nIn a few cases, however, one or more of the entities involved (be they the studio, the network, or the sponsor) liked a pilot enough to produce a second or even a third version of the concept. As we’ve outlined, this happened at least ten times prior to Star Trek.\n\nMyth = Busted\n\nAppendix: The Unprecedented Pilot—The Many Different Versions\n\nAlthough it appears the above-cited example of The Making of Star Trek—The Motion Picture (1980) may be the first time that Star Trek getting a second pilot episode was characterized as \"unprecedented,\" it was hardly the last. Below are a few of many, many examples printed over the past 42 years:\n\nAfter spending approximately $630,000 on one pilot film, the network felt that there was enough quality present in the episode for the series to deserve a second chance. For the first time in television history, a second pilot was commissioned, but some changes were to be made.\n\n—Allan Asherman, The Star Trek Compendium (first edition, 1981), p.41\n\nThe pilot was submitted to NBC in February, 1965. They rejected it. But the project wasn't canned; NBC still saw promise in the series and authorized an unprecedented second pilot—including an almost entirely new cast.\n\n—Author Unknown, Uncle John's Bathroom Reader (1988), p.86\n\nHowever, instead of dumping the project, NBC did the unprecedented, giving Gene the go-ahead to film a second pilot that they hoped would be more appealing to the network’s sensibilities.\n\n—William Shatner with Chris Kreski, Star Trek Memories (1993), p.66\n\nHowever, the executives were impressed enough by Roddenberry's efforts to make an unprecedented request for a second pilot, a more adventurous story by Samuel A. Peeples called \"Where No Man Has Gone Before.\"\n\n—Jeff Bond, The Music of Star Trek: Profiles in Style (1999), p.14\n\nNBC then made the unprecedented decision of asking Roddenberry to shoot a second pilot, but with changes...\n\n—David J. Shayler and Ian Moule, Women in Space: Following Valentina (2005), p.146\n\nBut they [NBC] requested a second pilot. This was unheard of in NBC history.\n\n—D.C. Fontana, Star Trek 365 (2010), from the book's introduction\n\nBut NBC executives were impressed enough with \"The Cage,\" Star Trek's rejected original telefilm, that they took the unprecedented step of ordering a second pilot rather than abandoning the concept.\n\n—Mark Clark, Star Trek FAQ: Everything Left to Know About the First Voyages of the Starship Enterprise (2012), p.71\n\nRevision History\n\n2016-04-05 An earlier version of this story was originally published as “Second Pilot Episodes Before Star Trek?” by Michael Kmet for the Star Trek Fact Check blog (link).\n\n2023—08-06 Published this updated version of that piece with additional information and some new photos…plus Bugs Bunny for the win.\n\nSee Also\n\nOur Where Some Pilots Had Gone Before playlist can be viewed below.
