        "text": "There Is No Cure for the Common Martian\n\nUncle Martin (Ray Walston) has trouble controlling his super-powers when he contacts the common cold, an affliction unknown on Mars. Fixing up a special pill to cure his malady, Martin leaves the powerful potion within reach of Tim (Bill Bixby), who accidentally consumes the pill and falls fast asleep just before he is to review an \"outer space\" exhibit at a local department store. Taking over Tim's assignment, Martin is appalled by the exhibit's glaring inaccuracies and pens a devastating article--thereby infuriating pompous store owner Trimble (played by former \"Great Gildersleeve\" Willard Waterman), who happens to be one of the biggest advertisers in Tim's newspaper!.\n\nTrigger Point\n\nScotty and Jess are driving the stage on an alternative route when the stage is ambushed. Jess and the passengers are forced to walk through the desert without food or water.\n\nThe Saul Bevins Story\n\nA blind man, his sister and young son meet up with the wagon train on the trail. They are trying to find a train that will let them travel to California. Saul is a qualified doctor and has hopes of starting a blind school.\n\nThe Jed Polke Story\n\nA woman and her son are rescued by the wagon train - when her husband shows up later, a group of men recognize him from the Civil War and plot revenge."
