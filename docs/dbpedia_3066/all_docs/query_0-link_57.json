        "text": "The Great Gildersleeve was a vastly popular radio show starring Harold Peary that followed the comical exploits of Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve. A spin-off character from the Fibber McGee and Molly Show, Gildersleeve was broadcast from 1941 to 1957 and was so well-received that Peary reprised the role in four motion pictures and three phonograph albums of children's stories in the 1940s. With Willard Waterman in the title role, 39 episodes were produced for NBC TV in 1955.\n\nThis 2-DVD bundle pack includes the following episodes:\n\nPractice What You Preach: Throckmorton advises his nephew on how to handle his love life.\n\nGildy Goes Diving: Gildersleeve attempts a dangerous underwater dive in a foolhardy attempt to attract publicity.\n\nGildy Stews About A Cook: Gildy is wiling to go to great lengths to terminate the services of his housekeeper - even marriage.\n\nOne Too Many Secretaries: Mayhem ensues when Gildy's girlfriend replaces his secretary.\n\nGildy & The Expectant Father: Gildersleeve lends support to a nervous young father-to-be.\n\nGildy Goes Broke: Throckmorton attempts to teach his nephew not to live beyond his means.\n\nProtective Parent: Protective Uncle Gildy decides to run a background check on his niece's new boyfriend."
