        "text": "episodes of The Great Gildersleeve\n\nThe Great Gildersleeve One of radio's great spinoff success stories, The Great Gildersleeve is considered one of the classic, quintessential radio situation comedies. Originally a blustering comic foil for Fibber McGee, Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve moved out of town and onto his own show in 1941, in the process gradually softening into a lovable though still braggadocious character. As the town of Springfield's Water Commissioner he hobnobbed with various male friends and courted various girlfriends, while caring for his nephew and niece. Gildy's unforgettable vocal style, especially his so-called \"dirty laugh\", was tightly associated with the actor who portrayed him, Hal Peary (who also portrayed him in several 1940s movies.) However, when the series changed networks in 1950, Peary was replaced by Willard Waterman with hardly a aural hiccup. Gildersleeve continued on radio until 1958, although the last three years in a much diminished 15-minute format.\n\nHere's a website with several excellent pages about the show\n\nClick on a script title below to view it:"
