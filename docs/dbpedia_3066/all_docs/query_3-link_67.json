        "text": "By Joe Cornelisse\n\nOn April the 22nd, 1980 Public Image Ltd. (PiL) played a small gig at a club in the Bowery called Great Gildersleaves, the club only help approx. 300 people. Filmmaker Paul Dougherty was given permission by the band to film the show, the untitled film, simply known as the ‘PiL Tape’ was never released, here are those 5 tracks.\n\nBelow the video is a review of the show by John Hanson who was there at the show, as published on the Public Image Ltd. fansite, Fodderstompf.\n\nReview of the show\n\nI was at the Gildersleeves show. Our understanding at the time was that it was put together quickly in response to the awful show at the Palladium two days earlier. The story we heard was that Wobble was terrified of Americans and that as a result, the band cut the Palladium show very short. Within a day we heard the band would play a “secret” show at Gildersleeves in the Bowery. At the time the club booked mostly heavy metal cover bands, and the PiL show took place after the groups that had already been booked had played and left the stage.\n\nIt wasn’t until the date of the show that we found out the details. I was working at my job as assistant manager of a hobby shop and had to make the trip from Long Island into the city in my work clothes. As a result, while most of the audience were in full scenester regalia, I was wearing a light grey sportcoat and polo shirt. A friend of mine and I got to the club early while the metal bands were still playing. As soon as they were done we parked ourselves in front of Lydon’s mic. We had a look at the guest list on the way in and Mick Jones and perhaps Robert Smith were on it, but I don’t think either actually attended.\n\nThe show itself was fantastic. Wobble seemed to have gotten over whatever was bothering him. I vaguely recall we were shouting something along the lines of “Don’t be afraid” to him. In your review of the video you mention Lydon spends much of the time crouching in front of the stage. He’s actually picking things up. For some reason, people in the crowd were tossing coins, and odds and ends from their pockets up on stage and John was having fun picking it all up and putting it in his pockets. We had some catsup packets from McDonalds we tossed him. I was directly at the stage in front of Lydon. I think he was amused by the wanker in the sportcoat screaming along with all the songs.\n\nWhen the band did ‘Public Image’ a second time as an encore, he pulled me up on stage and we finished the song together. I’ve never seen the video that circulates, so I thought I’d ask if there are any audience shots showing a guy with blond hair and a grey sportcoat standing next to a taller guy with dark hair and a black coat directly in front of Lydon.\n\nJohn Hanson"
