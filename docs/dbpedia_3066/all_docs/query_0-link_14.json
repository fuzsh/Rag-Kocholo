Initially written by Leonard Lewis Levinson,it was one of broadcast history's earliest spin-off programs. The series was built around the character Throckmorton P. Gildersleeve, a regular element of the radio situation comedy Fibber McGee and Molly. The character was introduced in the October 3, 1939 episode (number 216) of that series. Actor Harold Peary had played a similarly named character, Dr. Gildersleeve, on earlier episodes. The Great Gildersleeve enjoyed its greatest popularity in the 1940s. Peary played the character during its transition from the parent show into the spin-off and later in four feature films released at the height of the show's popularity. 2GB 527 old time radio show recordings (total playtime 258 hours, 40 min).Mobile devices 50 episodes$1.99 or access to mobile plus a zip file $4.49 containing all episode, Zip sent in separate email.\n\n2: Can I listen offline?\n\nYes.
