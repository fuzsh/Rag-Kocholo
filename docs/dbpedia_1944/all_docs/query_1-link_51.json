        "text": "(Second of an eight-part series profiling this year's inductees into the Greater Flint Afro-American Hall of Fame)\n\nFLINT, Michigan -- Elusiveness is a skill Flint native Daryl Turner has always had. Whether it was as a kid running around the streets of his south Flint neighborhood, blowing past defenders on the football field at Michigan State University and later in the NFL, or being tracked down by a reporter -- Turner has remained hard to catch.\n\nThat skill, along with his impact and long-standing strong reputation in his hometown, earned Turner a place in the Great Flint Afro-American Hall of Fame. Turner will be inducted alongside seven others on March 25.\n\nNorm Bryant, director of the Greater Flint Afro-American Hall of Fame, said Turner’s induction solidifies his spot as one of the best athletes ever to come out of the city.\n\n“When we induct new members, we focus on what a person does to make himself great,” Bryant said. “I’m not sure if it’s quite fair to say Daryl was the best-ever to come out of here, but he’s without question one of the best. We had a Heisman Trophy winner in (Mark Ingram) come from here, but he went to a great team at the right time, I wouldn’t say he was the best ever. But Daryl, he’s certainly in that class.”\n\n[Also see: Former NBA player Jeff Grayer remains active in basketball and Flint community]\n\nWhile competing in multiple sports at Flint Southwestern High School in the late 1970s, Turner dominated the Saginaw Valley Conference before going on to be a star football player at Michigan State. His sophomore season at MSU, Turner caught 31 passes for 653 yards and ended up averaging 20.2 yards per reception for his career -- which remains the second-highest average in school history behind Kirk Gibson.\n\n“You see back in the day, MSU had a strong pipeline to Flint,” Bryant said. “They always came here looking for players and I think a big part of that was based off guys like Daryl. When you get a talent like him out of a city, why wouldn’t you come back looking for more? Daryl really paved a way for kids and represented what Flint is all about.”\n\nTurner was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in 1984. He went on to play in 59 games over four NFL seasons, catching 101 passes for 36 touchdowns. Turner still holds franchise records in Seattle for highest yards per reception (18.53) and the most receiving touchdowns in a single season (13) as well as most receiving touchdowns for a rookie (10).\n\nTo family friend Harry Jackson, who grew up in the same neighborhood as Turner and played basketball with Turner’s older brothers, Jerome and Cecil, at Southwestern, seeing Turner recognized as one of the city’s best athletes was a formality.\n\n“Growing up in our neighborhood, every kid played sports, and I remember Daryl as a young kid just standing out,” said Jackson, who’s also a member of the Greater Flint Afro-American Hall of Fame. “He was dunking a basketball when he was in seventh or eighth grade. When he went on to have that type of success, for our neighborhood that was a big thing. We were all so close. I’m just really happy for him and his family.”\n\nTurner, who is expected to attend the induction in March, expressed his gratitude for the recognition when the 2012 class was announced earlier this month.\n\n\"A hall of fame is a hall of fame and it's just as special because this is the African-American hall of fame here in Flint,\" Turner told The Journal. \"Regardless of what happened outside of your activities as far as sports are concerned, you can look up on these walls and see that there are a lot of people that are special.\"\n\nJackson, who remains close to Turner and his family, said one thing that always stood out to him about Turner was his restless love for competition.\n\n“Man, as a kid he was just non-stop,” Jackson said. “Whether it was basketball, football, or just running around, Daryl was always active. I remember he’d be running around our neighborhood doing whatever, me and his brothers would have to yell at him ‘get out of the street boy’ and then he’d go right on to something else.”\n\nBryant hopes that Turner’s induction will serve as a reminder to today’s youth what opportunities can be achieved.\n\n“Daryl came right out of the south side of town and walked the same streets that many kids are walking right now,” Bryant said. “What we’re trying to do is connect the present with the past. That’s good for today’s kids. We need that. If you don’t know where you come from it’s hard to know where you can go. Coming out of Flint, I want kids to look up to guys like Daryl and see that they can reach that same plateau.”\n\nTickets to the March 25 Greater Flint Afro-American Hall of Fame are $35 and will be available by calling Sylvester or Derenda Collins, (810) 732-4149."
