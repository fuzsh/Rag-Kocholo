Fun!\n\nI went out and repurchased NCAA 11 just to play with these teams and check out the effects of the re-rates. I played a full 10 minute game using the proposed sliders and settings and it was awesome. USC vs. UCLA. I lost 34-17, mostly due to a few poor decisions in the passing game.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it felt really balanced on the field. Player differentiation was really noticeable.\n\nFor me, Allen felt very different from Bush and White. You could tell Keyshawn and Mike Williams were bigger, stronger forces than Swan or Morton. On defense, Lott and Browner delivered some monster kill shots.\n\nFor them, Aikman played straight from the pocket, though he didn't take many shots downfield. McNeill did a great job finding cutback lanes, and you could tell who was who on defense, especially Eric Turner and Ken Norton.\n\nI really liked the ratings and sliders together--the relative speeds and strengths of the various positions felt pretty well balanced. These are gonna be a blast to play with till NCAA 12 gets its patches.\n\nIs there a version of your sliders for NCAA 11 that's meant for play with the regular named rosters?\n\nDJ likes this.\n\nHall Of Fame\n\nOVR: 47\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2003\n\nLocation: Florida\n\nPosts: 17,753\n\nBlog Entries: 101\n\nRe: Playmakers NCAA 11 Alumni Dynasty Rosters\n\nYeah, I'm so glad I went out and bought the 360 version of this a few weeks ago so I could use this roster set. It really is like playing a different game compared to the default rosters.\n\nI'm pretty sure Play did have a regular set of sliders for NCAA 11; they will look similar to what MKHarsh33 is using for NCAA 12, I believe.\n\n__________________\n\nCurrently Playing:\n\nEA Sports College Football 25 (PS5)\n\nEA Sports PGA Tour (PS5)\n\nPGA Tour 2K23 (PS5)\n\nHall Of Fame\n\nOVR: 40\n\nJoin Date: Sep 2004\n\nLocation: Arizona\n\nPosts: 14,506\n\nRe: Playmakers NCAA 11 Alumni Dynasty Rosters\n\nARIZONA\n\nPlaybook-Arizona\n\nOffense-Pro Style-(Run-55%/Pass-45%)\n\nDefense-3-4\n\nIMPACT/ALL AMERICAN PLAYERS\n\nTrung Canidate\n\nSet Arizona school record for career rushing with 3,824 yards in only three years.\n\nTedy Bruschi\n\nBruschi was a stud defensive end for the Wildcats, where he tied the Division I-A career sack record (52). By the time Bruschi left Arizona, he had amassed 185 total tackles (137 solo) and six forced fumbles.\n\nChris McAlister\n\nHe had an illustrious career at Arizona where he won unanimous All-America 1st-team honors and was an All-Pac 10 1st-team choice for 3 straight seasons.
