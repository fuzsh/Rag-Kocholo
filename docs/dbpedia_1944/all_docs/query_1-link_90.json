        "text": "The College Football Hall of Fame Class of 2025 ballot includes two players from Alabama – running back Mark Ingram and offensive tackle Chris Samuels.\n\nThirty-seven other Crimson Tide players could have been included.\n\nThirty-nine Alabama players were eligible for the ballot for the Class of 2025 – and that doesn’t include 60 other Crimson Tide alumni who meet the first standard for consideration for the College Football Hall of Fame but aren’t in the current eligibility window.\n\nThat’s 99 players from Alabama with the possibility of becoming Hall of Famers.\n\nTo be considered for the College Football Hall of Fame today, a player must have been a first-team All-American selection by one of the organizations that the NCAA uses to compile its annual consensus All-American team. Currently, those organizations are the American Football Coaches Association, Associated Press, Football Writers Association of American, Sporting News and Walter Camp Football Foundation. But the selectors used by the NCAA have varied over the years, ranging from a low of two to a high of 10.\n\nPlayers aren’t considered for the College Football Hall of Fame until 10 full seasons after their final college campaign. They also aren’t considered while they are active pro players. Alabama has 38 players who meet the All-American standard but aren’t eligible yet because their final season with the Tide came in 2014 or later and/or they’re still playing professionally.\n\nPlayers also aren’t considered if their college careers ended more than 50 years ago, so any player who completed his time with the Tide before 1975 isn’t eligible for the 2025 ballot. Alabama has 22 players who meet the All-American standard but are outside the 50-year window.\n\nThose players still can be considered for the College Football Hall of Fame, but their qualifications are examined by the Football Bowl Subdivision Honors Review Committee, bypassing the ballot.\n\nAlabama had 14 players who were unanimous All-Americans and three players who were two-time consensus All-Americans eligible for the 2025 ballot.\n\nA unanimous All-American is a player who was a first-team selection for all the organizations used by the NCAA to compile the consensus All-American team for that season.\n\nA consensus All-American usually is a player who was a first-team selection for at least half of the organizations used by the NCAA to compile the consensus All-American team. It’s possible to become a consensus All-American without reaching the halfway mark, and it’s also possible, though rare, not to be a consensus All-American even while making at least half of the first teams.\n\nFor consideration for the College Football Hall of Fame, players don’t have to be consensus All-Americans – just first-teamers for a qualifying selector.\n\nFormer Alabama players eligible for the College Football Hall of Fame whose careers ended more than 50 years ago include (presented alphabetically with their All-American qualifying standards):\n\nOffensive tackle Buddy Brown:

He’s also the most recent of the Tide’s Hall of Famers to appear on the field. No Alabama player who has appeared in a game in the previous 30 seasons is in the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\nTwo of College Football Hall of Fame members from Alabama do not meet the currently used All-American standard – halfback Johnny Mack Brown, who played for the Crimson Tide from 1923 through 1925, and fullback Pooley Hubert, who played from 1922 through 1925.\n\nPlayers on the College Football Hall of Fame ballot are nominated by athletic directors, head coaches and sports-information directors at National Football Foundation-member schools.\n\nThe FBS nominees are sorted geographically for eight District Screening Committees. The committee members vote on which players will represent their region on the ballot. Players who received significant support in the final voting in the previous year but did not make the College Football Hall of Fame also are held over on the ballot automatically.\n\nThe more than 12,000 members of the National Football Foundation then get the annual ballot for their consideration.\n\nAfter the vote, the NFF Honors Court considers recommendations from the veterans committee, reviews the voting and chooses the members of the Hall of Fame class.\n\nStories by Mark Inabinett\n\nVeteran defensive tackle from Auburn among Monday’s NFL cuts\n\nTennessee Titans trading quarterback Malik Willis\n\nFormer Auburn WR Anthony Schwartz: ‘Sad this is how 2024 ends’"
