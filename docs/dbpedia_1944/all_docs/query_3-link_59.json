        "text": "Choose a Staff Member:\n\nKelsey Pope\n\nTitle\n\nWide Receivers\n\nFollow @CoachKelseyPope\n\nupdated June 2024\n\nThe developer of a Biletnikoff Award winner and multiple NFL Draft picks, Kelsey Pope has quickly established himself as one of the nation’s top wide receiver coaches at Tennessee. Pope was tabbed to the role by Josh Heupel in March 2022 after serving as an offensive analyst in 2021.\n\nTHE POPE FILE\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nBirthdate: May 8, 1992\n\nHometown: Sylacauga, Alabama\n\nEducation: Samford, 2014 (bachelor’s in public administration)\n\nPlaying Experience: Samford - WR (2010-13)\n\nWife: Dacia\n\nChildren: Knight\n\nCOACHING HISTORY\n\n2017-18: Ohio Northern, Running Backs\n\n2018-19: Shorter (Ga.) University, Assistant Wide Receivers Coach\n\n2019: Tennessee Tech, Wide Receivers\n\n2020: Gardner-Webb, Pass Game Coordinator/Wide Receivers\n\n2021-22: Tennessee, Offensive Analyst\n\n2022-present: Tennessee, Wide Receivers\n\nBOWL GAME APPEARANCES AS A COACH (3)\n\n2024 Citrus Bowl – Tennessee\n\n2022 Orange Bowl - Tennessee\n\n2021 Music City Bowl – Tennessee\n\nNFL WIDE RECEIVERS COACHED\n\nRamel Keyton, Las Vegas Raiders, 2024\n\nJalin Hyatt, New York Giants, 2023\n\nCedric Tillman, Cleveland Browns, 2023\n\nVelus Jones Jr., Chicago Bears, 2022\n\nIn Pope’s three years with the program, the Volunteers have generated an SEC-best 22 individual 100-yard receiving games and multiple first-team All-SEC recipients, while sending at least one player to the NFL every season. UT has had a player crack the 60-reception single-season mark and enter the school’s top 10 four times in the past three seasons.\n\nTrue sophomore Squirrel White became the latest success story in leading the 2023 unit. White carried the torch for a group that was decimated by injuries and finished with 67 catches for 803 yards and two scores. The 67 receptions ranked fifth in the SEC and tied for seventh in Vol single-season annals. Senior Ramel Keyton ranked second on the squad with 35 receptions for 642 yards and six touchdowns, which was 10th in the SEC. Keyton signed a free agent deal with the Las Vegas Raiders following the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nFew position groups in college football made the striking impact the Tennessee wide receivers did in 2022. Whether it was through explosive plays or constant pressure on defenses, Pope’s wideout group paved the way for the program’s first 11-win season in two decades, and it did it against ranked foes the likes of Pittsburgh, Alabama, LSU, Florida, Kentucky and Clemson.\n\nTennessee broke 13 team single-season records and boasted the nation’s No. 1 scoring offense (46.1 ppg) and total offense (525.5). Pope’s unit led the nation in receiving plays of 30+ yards (40), 40+ yards (27), 50+ yards (15) and 60+ yards (9). The 27 40+ yard plays were the most by an FBS program since 2018. Jalin Hyatt, Cedric Tillman, Bru McCoy, Keyton and White proved to be difference makers, and Pope was named a finalist for the 2022 Football Scoop Wide Receivers Coach of the Year.\n\nHyatt became the most explosive playmaker in the sport and rewrote the Tennessee single-season record books. He tallied 67 catches for 1,267 yards and a school-record 15 touchdowns in the fall of 2022. He captured the SEC receiving triple crown, leading the league in touchdowns, receptions per game (5.6) and receiving yards per game (105.6).\n\nWith 11.6 million people watching around the globe and before a sold-out Neyland Stadium crowd, Hyatt delivered one of the greatest receiving performances in college football history on the Third Saturday in October 2022 vs. Alabama. He caught six passes for 207 yards and shattered the school single-game record for touchdown catches with five, a mark that tied the SEC record. His 30 points that night — also a UT record — contributed to the Vols’ epic 52-49 victory over the Tide. Hyatt became the first FBS player with five or more receiving touchdowns vs. an AP top-five team in 25 years.\n\nUnder the tutelage of Pope, Hyatt became the 13th unanimous first-team All-American in Tennessee history and the first Vol wide receiver to achieve the feat. The exclamation point on the epic individual season came when Hyatt became the first UT player to win the Biletnikoff Award as the nation’s most outstanding receiver.\n\nPope’s development of the room did not stop with Hyatt. Transfer McCoy, playing his first season in a Vol uniform, caught 52 passes for 667 yards and four scores. Tillman, who battled through an ankle injury most of the season, still hauled in 37 passes for 417 yards and three touchdowns. White, then a true freshman, logged 30 receptions for 481 yards and two scores, including a significant one to help the Vols beat ACC champion Clemson in the Orange Bowl. McCoy, Keyton and White all caught touchdown passes against a Clemson defense that was among the nation’s best.\n\nTennessee’s success carried over into the spring of 2023. Both Hyatt and Tillman were invited to the NFL Combine and then heard their names called in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft. Hyatt went No. 73 overall to the New York Giants, and Tillman was chosen with the following pick at No. 74 by the Cleveland Browns. Tennessee was the only program in the nation with multiple wide receivers chosen through the first three rounds of the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nIn 2021, Pope was instrumental in the holistic development of a wide receivers room that featured multiple players with 60+ receptions for the first time in school history. The Vols were one of only two SEC programs with multiple players with seven or more receiving touchdowns in 2021. Meanwhile, Tennessee led the SEC in 30+ yard receiving plays (30), 40+ yard receiving plays (18) and 70+ yard receiving plays (4).\n\nTillman entered the 2021 season with just eight catches for 124 yards and no touchdowns in his first three seasons combined. In his first season with Pope, he finished the year with 64 catches for 1,081 yards and 12 scores, becoming the Vols’ ninth 1,000-yard receiver all-time and first since 2011. He finished sixth in the SEC in receptions, good for eighth in single-season school history.\n\nAll-SEC senior Velus Jones Jr. caught 62 passes — 10th in school history and 10th in the SEC — for 807 yards and seven scores. Jones Jr. was tabbed the SEC Co-Special Teams Player of the Year and earned Reese’s Senior Bowl All-America honors. Jones went on to be selected in the third round of the 2022 NFL Draft by the New Orleans Saints at pick No. 71.\n\nPope possesses a firm knowledge of Heupel’s up-tempo offense, which averaged a nation-best 2.99 offensive plays per minute. The unit was the nation’s most improved scoring offense, skyrocketing from 108th in the FBS a season prior to his arrival to seventh in 2021 at 39.3 points per game. Pope was part of an offensive staff that saw Tennessee shatter eight then-single-season records, including points (511), total offensive yards (6,174), touchdowns (67), point after touchdowns made (67), total first downs (316), rushing first downs (164), fewest interceptions thrown (3) and passing efficiency (167.10).\n\nPope was the pass game coordinator and wide receivers coach at Gardner-Webb for one season prior to joining Heupel’s staff. He previously served as the wide receivers coach at Tennessee Tech in 2019, a season that saw the Golden Eagles post the second-best total offensive output in school history.\n\nPope mentored freshman wide receiver Metrius Fleming, who was an All-Ohio Valley Conference selection and a four-time OVC Newcomer of the Week recipient. Fleming hauled in 47 passes for 629 yards and three touchdowns, while rushing for two more scores and adding a 91-yard kickoff return touchdown. He averaged 26.5 yards per return and finished with more than 1,200 all-purpose yards.\n\nMeanwhile, senior Darrius Stafford added 41 catches for 515 yards and three scores as Tennessee Tech averaged over 380 yards of total offense per game and put up 29.0 points per contest.\n\nPope spent a season as an assistant receivers coach at Shorter (Georgia) University on the Division II level in 2018. He helped guide a group of receivers that accounted for more than 2,000 yards and saw three of his pass catchers post seasons of 400 yards apiece.\n\nPope got his coaching start at Ohio Northern in 2017 where he worked with the running backs. He oversaw a run game that tallied 195.5 yards per game on the ground and a stellar 435.7 offensive yards per contest. Running back Christaan Williams rushed for 1,623 yards and 11 touchdown on his way to All-OAC honors and second-team All-America accolades.\n\nA standout receiver himself, Pope starred at Samford from 2010-13, finishing as the Bulldogs’ all-time leader in career receptions (250) and single-game catches with 17 against The Citadel in 2011. He led the squad in receiving for three straight seasons and amassed 2,385 receiving yards and 13 scores during his career.\n\nA three-time All-SoCon selection, Pope spent time in the NFL as a player with the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nHe earned his degree in public administration from Samford in 2014.\n\nHe and his wife, Dacia, reside in Knoxville. They have a newborn son, Knight."
