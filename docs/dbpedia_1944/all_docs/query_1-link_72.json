        "text": "Brian Hartline\n\nCo-Offensive Coordinator / Wide Receivers\n\nThe Ohio State University\n\nBrian Hartline is in his eighth season on the Ohio State staff and is the team’s co-offensive coordinator and wide receiver’s coach.\n\n“Brian has been successful in every football capacity for which he has been engaged,” head coach Ryan Day said. “He has progressed incredibly well from college to NFL receiver, and then from quality control coach to wide receivers coach and now to his roles as a coordinator.\n\n“He has also developed his receivers at an unprecedented level and he has recruited as well or better than anyone in the country.”\n\nHartline, who is 37, has proven to be the top receivers coach in college football, being named so twice in the last two years. @on3sports named him its 2022 national wide receivers coach of the year and FootballScoop named Hartline its 2021 wide receivers coach of the year.\n\nIn 2019 he was honored by the American Football Coaches Association as one of its AFCA 35 Under 35 honorees, a prestigious program that develops “premier, future leaders” in the coaching profession.\n\nIn his seven previous seasons on staff, including one year as a quality control coach, Hartline has successfully recruited and mentored some of the best wide receivers in the nation. Consider:\n\nMarvin Harrison Jr. won the 2023 Biletnikoff Award as the outstanding receiver in collegiate football and was a Heisman Trophy finalist.\n\nHarrison Jr. became the first two-time All-American receiver in Ohio State’s long and storied history, earning unanimous honors twice (2022 and 2023).\n\nHarrison Jr. was a two-time wide receiver of the year in the Big Ten Conference and the Big Ten’s offensive player of the year, as well, in 2023.\n\nChris Olave (2021), Garrett Wilson (2021) and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (second-team in 2021) have all been named All-Americans under Hartline’s watch. Big Ten Conference in 2022.\n\nHarrison Jr., and Emeka Egbuka were each 1,000-yard receivers in 2022, one year after Smith-Njigba and Wilson were 1,000-yard receivers in 2021.\n\nSmith-Njigba set Ohio State game and single season records for receptions (15 vs. Nebraska and Utah; and 96 for the season) and receiving yards (an all-time bowl record 347 yards vs. Utah; and 1,606 for the season) in 2021.\n\nOlave set the Ohio State career record with 35 touchdown receptions.\n\nHarrison Jr. set the school record with 15 100-yard receiving games.\n\nRemarkably in 2021, Smith-Njigba, Wilson and Olave all finished in the Ohio State single season Top 10s for receptions and yards."
