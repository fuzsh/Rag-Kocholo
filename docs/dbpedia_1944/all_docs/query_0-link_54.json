A Noon (E.D.T.) kickoff is set at Neyland Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 14.\n\nUTC owns the second-toughest schedule in the FCS and follows Saturday's game with a visit from No. 2 James Madison to Chattanooga on Sept. 21.\n\nThe Mocs are 1-1 after last week's 41-20 loss at No. 17/18 Jacksonville State. Chattanooga opened the season with a 24-10 win over Eastern Illinois at home on Aug. 29 and is receiving votes in both the AFCA FCS Coaches Poll and the STATS FCS Top 25.\n\nTennessee is looking for its first win after dropping its first two games of the season. The Vols lost to Georgia State 38-30 on Aug. 31. BYU then scored a 29-26 overtime win in Knoxville last week.\n\nThis is the 41st meeting in the series that dates back to 1904. The Mocs are 2-36-2 all-time, including wins in 1905 (5-0) and 1958 (14-6). The ties came in 1909 (0-0) and 1910 (6-6). This is just the second meeting since 1969.

FBS TEAMS\n\nUTC picked up its third win in program history over an FBS opponent on Sept. 7, 2013, with a 42-14 victory at Georgia State. Prior to that, the last time the Mocs defeated an FBS team was a 9-7 win over Southwestern Louisiana (Louisiana-Lafayette) on Sept. 1, 1984, in Chattanooga. The other win since the divisional split in 1978 was also over the Ragin' Cajuns, 38-14 on Sept. 17, 1983, in Lafayette, La.\n\nBIG CROWDS\n\nTwo of the biggest crowds the Mocs have played in front of in school history have come against an SEC opponent. UTC faced No. 1 Alabama in 2016 in front of 101,821, the most ever to see the Mocs play. There were also 100,170 in attendance at the 2013 game at Alabama and 97,289 in 2017 at LSU.\n\nMOCS AGAINST BIG-TIME OPPONENTS\n\nLike most FCS teams, Chattanooga takes on at least one FBS squad each year. However, the Mocs have faced some of the best in recent years. Here is a rundown of Chattanooga's notable FBS opponentes since 2008:\n\nSouth Carolina - Lost 45-10 on Nov. 17, 2018\n\nLSU - Lost 45-10 on Sept. 9, 2017 - Led 3-0\n\nNo. 1 Alabama - Lost 31-3 on Nov. 17, 2016\n\nNo. 14 Florida State - Lost 52-13 on Nov. 21, 2015\n\nTennessee - Lost 45-10 on Oct. 11, 2014\n\nNo. 1 Alabama - Lost 49-0 on Nov. 23, 2013\n\nNo. 10 Nebraska - Lost 40-7 on Sept. 2, 2011\n\nNo. 2 Auburn - Lost 62-24 on Nov. 6, 2010 - eventual BCS Champion\n\nNo. 2 Alabama - Lost 45-0 on Nov. 21, 2009 - eventual BCS Champion\n\nFlorida State - Lost 46-7 on Sept. 13, 2008\n\nNo. 4 Oklahoma - Lost 57-2 on Aug. 30, 2008\n\nUTC has also played South Florida (L, 34-13 on 9/1/12), Georgia State (W, 42-14 on 9/14/13) and Central Michigan (L, 16-20 on 8/28/14) in recent FBS action.\n\nMOCS HELD LEAD IN THREE OF LAST FOUR FBS GAMES\n\nThe Mocs have held leads in three of the last four meetings with an FBS opponent. It would be 4-4, but Victor Ulmo's 42-yard field goal attempt on the opening drive at South Carolina last season was blocked. Ulmo hit a 22-yarder for a 3-0 lead at LSU in 2017. The Mocs led 3-0 after the first quarter at Alabam in 2016 thanks to a 47-yard field goal by Henrique Ribeiro. UTC only trailed 14-3 at halftime in that game, drawing praise/ire from head coach Nick Saban during his interview on ESPN going into the locker room. Ribeiro also had a 29-yard FG for a 3-0 lead at Florida State on Nov. 21, 2015.\n\nNUNNELLY AND TIANO PUT UP BIG NUMBERS AT SOUTH CAROLINA LAST SEASON\n\nBryce Nunnelly and Nick Tiano both put up some impressive numbers at South Carolina last season. Nunnelly finished with five catches for 141 yards, including a 45-yard pass on the first play of the game. He also had a 57-yard connection with Tiano in the fourth quarter. That was the most receiving yards by a Moc against an FBS opponent since Cos DeMatteo had 207 at Louisville on Sept. 11, 1999. It was also the most receiving yards by a Moc against an SEC opponent since Rocky Turner had 198 at Ole Miss on Nov. 13, 1971.\n\nTiano was 17-36 for 254 passing yards. It was the most passing yards by a Moc against an FBS opponent since Chris Sanders had 367 at Louisville on Sept. 11, 1999 and the most passing yards by a Moc against an SEC opponent since Steve Woods had 286 at Vanderbilt on Nov. 22, 1980.\n\nIronically, it was Nunnelly who threw UTC's only touchdown pass to Tiano, a two-yard connection in the fourth quarter.\n\nTIANO'S BIG PLAYS VS. LSU AND SOUTH CAROLINA\n\nIn addition to the 45 and 57-yard passes Nick Tiano served up to Bryce Nunnelly against South Carolina last season, he also had two other big plays against the SEC the last two years. In last year's game at USC, he hit Wil Young for a 33-yard connection. At LSU in 2017, he and Joseph Parker connected for a 67-yard pass play.\n\nDOWDELL BACK RETURNING PUNTS\n\nJunior DB Brandon Dowdell was No. 6 in the FCS with a 12.6 punt return average on 13 attempts as a freshman in 2017. He did not return any punts on 2018, but returned to the job last week at Jacksonville State. He quickly made an impact with returns of 18 and 38 yards. The second was a career-long and set up the Mocs' second field goal.\n\nTUCKER WITH BIG PLAYS\n\nFreshman Lameric Tucker has four catches for 96 yards in the first two games. His 24.0 yards per catch average is 16th in the FCS. He caught a 39-yarder against EIU and a 36-yarder last week.\n\nFORD RECOGNIZED AMONG TOP FRESHMEN\n\nTrue freshman Ailym Ford was in the Honorable Mention listings for National Freshman of the Week by STATS this week. He posted 127 rushing yards on 22 carries and a score at Jacksonville State, becoming the Mocs' first true freshman to rush for 100 yards in a game since Erroll Wynn had 131 against Jacksonville State on Nov. 4, 2006. Ford is fourth in the SoCon with 88.5 rushing yards per game. He led the Mocs with 50 rushing yards and a TD on 12 carries in the season opener against Eastern Illinois, the first true freshman to score in a debut since Chris Awuah in 2009. All of his action has come in the last six quarters.\n\nNUNNELLY ON THE WALTER PAYTON AWARD WATCH LIST\n\nJunior receiver Bryce Nunnelly is on the 2019 Walter Payton Award Preseason Watch List. He is also on the preseason All-SoCon first team and a consensus preseason All-American. He posted 100 receiving yards and a TD on six catches against Eastern Illinois and is now tied for third all-time at UTC with seven 100-yard receiving games.\n\nNUNNELLY'S 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Recipient of the Parks McCall Memorial Athletic Scholarship.\n\n• 2018 Academic All-SoCon team and the CoSIDA Google Cloud Academic All-District squad with a 3.80 GPA as a Mechanical Engineering major.\n\n• First Team All-Southern Conference selection as a sophomore in 2018 when he was second in the league and No. 6 in the FCS with 112.5 receiving yards per game.\n\n• Third in the SoCon and No. 8 in the FCS with 7.2 receptions per game.\n\n• School-record with four straight 100-yard receiving games and tied the UTC single-season mark with six 100-yard receiving games overall.\n\n• Burst on to the scene in 2018, putting up 429 receiving yards in the first two games ... UTC school-record for yards in consecutive outings.\n\n• Opened the season by earning SoCon Offensive Player of the Week honors with seven catches for 161 yards against Tennessee Tech ... 89-yard connection with quarterback Nick Tiano was the fifth-longest pass play in school history.\n\n• The next week he was named STATS FCS National Offensive Player of the Week, SoCon Student-Athlete of the Week and repeated as SoCon Offensive Player of the Week after posting 10 catches for 268 yards and two TDs at The Citadel ... those were the most receiving yards in a game since Joel Bradford's school-record 274 (15) in a 36-28 win at No. 25 Furman on Oct. 23, 2010 ... also the third-most yards in a league game in SoCon history.\n\n• Another marquee showing included five catches for 141 yards at South Carolina ... most receiving yards by a Moc against an SEC opponent since Rocky Turner had 198 at Ole Miss on Nov. 13, 1971.\n\n• Posted 11 catches of 40+ yards in 2018 ... Mocs only had five such plays as a team the year before.\n\nO-LINE GETTING BETTER\n\nThe Mocs have not allowed a sack in either of the first two games of the 2019 season. That continues the Mocs streak of improvement up front. UTC's offensive line gave up 17 sacks in 2018, which was third in the SoCon and 33rd in the FCS. That was a big improvement from 2017 when they were last in the SoCon and 109th in the FCS, allowing over three per game.\n\nCOOPER NAMED SOCON DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE WEEK\n\nSenior LB Marshall Cooper was a second team All-SoCon pick last season and is on the preseason first team heading into 2019. He was named the Southern Conference Defensive Player of the Week, presented by GEICO, after posting 10 tackles to lead the Mocs to a 24-10 season-opening win over Eastern Illinois on Aug. 29. It was the third career weekly honor from the SoCon for Cooper, a native of Hixson, Tenn. He was Defensive Player of the Week after last year's win over Samford and Special Teams Player of the Week after blocking a punt in a win over ETSU in 2017. Seven of his 10 tackles against the Panthers were solo stops. He also broke up two passes in the win. The Mocs' defense only allowed 10 points in the Thursday night home opener, the fewest given up by a SoCon team in Week 1.\n\nTIANO CLIMBING UTC'S RECORD BOOKS\n\nSenior QB Nick Tiano opened the season with 256 passing yards on 17-27 attempts. He threw one touchdown and had two interceptions. With 18 games at UTC under his belt, he is climbing the following lists in UTC's record book:\n\n• 351-591 (.594) career passing.\n\n• 3,986 career passing yards is ninth all-time at UTC ... needs 148 to pass Tim Couch (1984-86) 8th.\n\n• 10th in career attempts ... needs 12 to pass Steve Woods (1978-81) for ninth.\n\n• Eighth in career completions ... needs 35 to pass Antonio Miller (2004-07) for seventh.\n\n• Seventh in career completion percentage.\n\n• 22 career TD passes is 10th all-time at UTC ... needs seven to pass Tony Merendino (1975-78) and Brian Hampton for eighth.\n\n• 10 200-yard passing games is 7th all-time at UTC ... needs three more to pass Kenyon Earl for 6th.\n\n• 4,372 yards of total offense is ninth all-time at UTC ... needs 345 yards to pass Antonio Miller (2004-07) for eighth.\n\nTIANO HIGHLIGHTS FROM 2018\n\n• Graduated with a degree in Business Management in the spring of 2019 ... currently pursuing a Master's of Business Administration in UTC's Rollins College of Business.\n\n• 233-378 passing for 2,710 yards and 15 touchdowns against only six interceptions in 2018.\n\n• Passing yards were fifth on the Mocs single-season list, and he had the third-most completions in a season at UTC.\n\n• Fewest INTs among those who have completed over 200 passes in a season at UTC.\n\n• 61.6 completion percentage was fourth among those at UTC with 2,000 passing yards in a season.\n\n• 23rd in the FCS and third in the SoCon in total offense (268.1).\n\n• Third in the league and No. 20 in the FCS in passing yards (246.4).\n\n• Other SoCon/FCS rankings include 4th/53rd with 15 passing TDs, 3rd/16th in completions per game (21.2) and 3rd/19th in completion percentage (61.6%).\n\n• First Moc to throw back-to-back 300-yard games (TTU & The Citadel) since B.J.

The coaches selected all-conference first and second teams and were not allowed to vote for their own student-athletes or teams in the voting process.\n\nJunior receiver Bryce Nunnelly earned a spot on the first team offense. He was a first team All-SoCon pick last season after finishing second in the conference and No. 6 in the FCS with 112.5 receiving yards per game.

The coaches were not allowed to vote for their teams in their preseason poll. Wofford, Furman and ETSU were the top three picks in both the coaches and media preseason polls. Mercer, Samford and The Citadel followed the Mocs in the coaches poll, with Western Carolina and VMI filling in the last two spots in both listings.
