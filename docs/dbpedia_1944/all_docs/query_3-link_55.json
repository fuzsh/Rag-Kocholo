        "text": "The Chicago Bears joined the National Football League (then the American Professional Football Association) in 1920. The Green Bay Packers joined the NFL (then APFA) in 1921. By 1946, basically a quarter of a century later, both teams had won six NFL titles.\n\nBut looking at the big picture, da Bears had 11 players who played on those early teams who were later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Meanwhile, the Packers only had eight players from their early teams get a bust in Canton.\n\nThat makes absolutely no sense to me, especially when one takes a close look at the three players from the Packers who the Hall of Fame has at this point have omitted from the place where the best of the best resides.\n\nThe 11 players from the Bears are George Halas (who also was head coach), Red Grange, Bronco Nagurski, John “Paddy” Driscoll, Dan Fortmann, Ed Healey, Bill Hewitt, Sid Luckman, William Lyman, George McAfee and George Musso.\n\nI have absolutely no qualms about that group of 11 from the Bears being in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nHere are the eight Packers on those early teams who are in the Hall of Fame. There is Curly Lambeau (who was also head coach), Robert “Cal” Hubbard, Johnny “Blood” McNally, Mike Michalske, Clarke Hinkle, Arnie Herber, Don Hutson and Tony Canadeo.\n\nLike the 11 players on the Bears, this list of eight individuals for the Packers have rightly been given a bust in Canton.\n\nIn addition, there is a player who has a bust in Canton that played for both of these teams in the early years. I’m talking about Walt Kiesling, who played with da Bears in 1934 and with the Packers in 1935 and 1936.\n\nIn 2019, I wrote stories about the three players from the Packers who I believe deserve a bust in Canton. As a matter of fact, all three were senior finalists for the Class of 2020 for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, but none were inducted.\n\nLet’s first start with Lavvie Dilweg. The former Marquette University star, who started his NFL career with the Milwaukee Badgers, was a First-Team member of the NFL All-Decade team of the 1920s. He is the only member of that All-Decade team not in Canton. Dilweg was named First-Team All-Pro team six times and was also a Second-Team selection at All-Pro once. There was no Pro Bowl (started in 1938) when Dilweg played.\n\nDilweg set all the Green Bay receiving records until a fellow by the name of Don Huston came on the scene. Dilweg was part of the squad that won three consecutive NFL titles from 1929 through 1931. This was prior to the playoff era in the NFL. Unbelievably, Dilweg was also considered the best two-way player in the NFL when he played, as he also played defensive end, where he was a fierce tackler and also intercepted a whopping 27 passes when the NFL was a “three yards and a cloud of dust” league back then.\n\nDilweg was also the grandfather of Anthony Dilweg, who played quarterback for the Packers in 1989 and 1990.\n\nThen there is Verne Lewellen. The former Nebraska star was also part of the team which won three straight NFL titles in 1929, 1930 and 1931. Lewellen was a do-it-all type of player, as he rushed for 2,410 career yards and 37 TDs, passed for 2,076 yards and threw nine TDs and gained another 1,240 yards receiving and had 12 more scores.\n\nLewellen was also the Green Bay punter, as he averaged 39.5 yards per kick. Lewellen was named All-Pro four times and should have been named to the NFL All-Decade team of the 1920s like Dilweg was. When he retired from the NFL, Lewellen was the all-time leading scorer in the history of the league.\n\nFinally, there is Cecil Isbell. The former Purdue star had a short five-year career before he retired. But what a great career he had in those five years. Isbell was a two-time First-Team All-Pro and a three-time Second-Team All-Pro. Isbell also went to four Pro Bowls.\n\nIsbell was so prolific throwing the ball to Hutson, that he was named to the NFL All-Decade team of the 1930s. From 1920 through 2000, there have been 21 quarterbacks selected to the All-Decade teams. All but Isbell are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe two best years that Hutson ever had were in 1941 and 1942 when Isbell was throwing him the ball. In 1941, Hutson caught 58 passes from Isbell for 738 yards and 10 touchdowns. In 1942, Hutson caught 74 passes from Isbell for 1,211 yards and 17 touchdowns. In ’42, Hutson became the first-ever 1,000 yard receiver.\n\nIn his short career, Isbell threw 61 touchdown passes versus 52 interceptions for 5,945 yards (better stats than Hall of Famer Sammy Baugh). He was not a bad runner either, as he rushed for 1,522 yards and 10 scores. Isbell also found time to catch 15 passes.\n\nBottom line, Dilweg, Lewellen and Isbell all deserve to be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. That would also even up the Packers and da Bears in terms of having 11 players apiece on their early teams when each team won six NFL titles through 1946.\n\nOne of the moments I will never forget is when Jerry Kramer was nominated as a senior candidate in 2017 for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. This was after years of promoting Jerry via my articles about getting his rightful place among the best of the best. Jerry had been a finalist 10 times before 2017, nine times as a modern-era candidate and once before as a senior candidate in 1997. But Jerry was never inducted, even with his excellent history with the Green Bay Packers under Vince Lombardi.\n\nThat thankfully changed in 2018. But why was there a delay? Jerry should have gotten a bust in Canton decades before.\n\nFor instance, in 1969, Jerry was named the best player ever at the guard position in the first 50 years of the NFL, when the Pro Football Hall of Fame named their NFL 50th anniversary team.\n\nThe first team consisted of Jim Thorpe, Johnny Unitas, Jim Brown, Gale Sayers, Elroy “Crazy Legs” Hirsch, Cal Hubbard, Don Hutson, John Mackey, Chuck Bednarik, Gino Marchetti, Leo Nomellini, Ray Nitschke, Dick “Night Train” Lane, Emlen Tunnell, Lou Groza and Kramer.\n\nEvery one of the members on that legendary team were enshrined as players in the Pro Football Hall of Fame through 2017. All except one. That would be Jerry Kramer.\n\nPlus, let’s not forget that Kramer was also named to the NFL All-Decade team for the 1960s. Why was that? Well, Jerry was a six-time AP All-Pro and was also named to three Pro Bowls for the Packers. Kramer would have had even more honors if not for injuries and illness.\n\nFinally, Jerry was part of a Packers team that under head coach Lombardi won five NFL titles in seven years. That included winning the NFL title three years in a row. That has never been duplicated since the NFL went to a playoff system in 1933. The Packers also won Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II. Jerry was not only part of those great teams that won five championships, he was a big reason why the team won those titles. Especially in 1962, 1965 and 1967.\n\nIn the 1962 NFL title game at Yankee Stadium, with bitterly cold weather, along with gusting winds that hit 40 mph, Jerry kicked three field goals, which just happened to be the difference in the game, as the Packers beat the New York Giants 16-7.\n\nIn the 1965 NFL title game versus the Cleveland Browns at snowy and muddy Lambeau Field, Jerry and his teammates on the offensive line had a sensational day.\n\nFullback Jim Taylor and halfback Paul Hornung led a rushing attack that gained 204 yards, as the Pack won 23-12. The power sweep was especially effective, as Jerry and fellow guard Fuzzy Thurston kept opening big holes for the backs as the Packers gained big chunks of yardage past the line of scrimmage.\n\nIn the 1967 NFL title game (better known as the “Ice Bowl”) versus the Cowboys at frigid Lambeau Field, Jerry made the most famous block in the history of the NFL.\n\nThe playing surface that day was truly a frozen tundra, as the game-time temperature was 13 below zero. It all came down to 13 seconds to go with no timeouts at the 1-yard line of the Cowboys.\n\nQuarterback Bart Starr called a 31-wedge play in the huddle, which calls for the fullback to get the ball. However, Starr decided to keep the ball after conferring with Lombardi on the sideline about the play.\n\nStarr thought it would be better to try to get into the end zone himself due to the slippery and icy conditions near the goal line. Starr followed Kramer’s classic block on Jethro Pugh and found a hole behind No. 64 to score the winning touchdown.\n\nAll of that history was out there for the voters to see. Fortunately, thanks to Rick Gosselin, who sits on the Senior Committee, Jerry was nominated in 2017 and then was later inducted in 2018, after the entire Selection Committee heard presentations by Gosselin (Talk of Fame Network) and Pete Dougherty (Packers News).\n\nThat also led to one of the best times of my life when I was able to be in Canton with my son Andrew to see Jerry get enshrined. What a wonderful experience that was!\n\nIt was also wonderful when Gosselin was able to get his amnesty proposal passed, which allowed the Pro Football Hall of Fame to induct 10 seniors as part of the 2020 centennial class. Before that proposal was accepted, only as many as two seniors could be inducted in any given year, sometimes only one.\n\nThe 10 seniors who were inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2020 were Harold Carmichael, Jim Covert, Bobby Dillon, Cliff Harris, Winston Hill, Alex Karras, Donnie Shell, Duke Slater, Mac Speedie and Ed Sprinkle.\n\nTo me, that was one of the finest moments in the history of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which dates back to 1963. Why? There is no group that is more neglected in the selection process than the seniors. So I was ecstatic that 10 seniors got in in 2020, with one of the players being Dillon, who I also had promoted.\n\nEven so, I was disappointed that only one former Packer was inducted in the Class of 2020, as there were four former Packers who were among the 20 finalists. Dillon was indeed among the 10 who was inducted, but Lavvie Dilweg, who was a NFL All-Decade player from the 1920s and who also was considered the best two-way player of his era, was not. Nor was Verne Lewellen, who like Dilweg, played on three NFL title teams in Green Bay, plus retired as the all-time scoring leader in NFL history at that time. Nor was Cecil Isbell, who is the only NFL All-Decade quarterback who does not have a bust in Canton. Don Hutson had the best years of his phenomenal career with Isbell as his quarterback.\n\nBesides Dilweg, Lewellen and Isbell, there were seven other senior finalists who didn’t get inducted in 2020. They were Cliff Branch, Roger Craig, Ox Emerson, Randy Gradishar, Tommy Nobis, Drew Pearson and Al Wistert.\n\nAfter the great publicity of getting 10 deserving seniors into the Hall of Fame in 2020, the decision-makers in Canton made a very curious decision. They decided that over the next number of years that only one senior would be nominated and then possibly inducted. That made absolutely no sense to me.\n\nPearson was nominated and inducted in 2021. Branch was recently nominated and will hopefully be inducted in February. Both Pearson and Branch were among the 10 senior finalists who didn’t make the cut in 2020, so at first glance, it appears as though that particular group of seniors will get the first shot in terms of getting a bust in Canton. But only at a rate of one per year.\n\nThat needs to change. Again, the senior category has seen dozens and dozens of players who have fallen through the cracks and have never been given their due. Here are just some of the seniors who I believe deserve consideration and potentially induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nBoyd Dowler\n\nOtis Taylor\n\nRon Kramer\n\nChuck Howley\n\nGale Gillingham\n\nKen Anderson\n\nSterling Sharpe\n\nHarold Jackson\n\nEddie Meador\n\nKen Riley\n\nJim Marshall\n\nMaxie Baughan\n\nL.C. Greenwood\n\nBobby Boyd\n\nGary Collins\n\nMike Curtis\n\nDick Schafrath\n\nPat Harder\n\nJim Tyrer\n\nClay Matthews Jr.\n\nI just listed 20 names, but there are many more who deserve mention. Nobody knows more about the senior category than Gosselin. Which is why I made it a point to talk to Rick while I was promoting Jerry Kramer for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Gosselin has been on the senior sub-committee for 17 years. When he first became part of that committee, Gosselin compiled a very lengthy list of deserving senior candidates. Since that time, 35 players from that list have been nominated and been given busts in Canton. But guess what? There are still around 90 players on Gosselin’s list.\n\nWhich is why we need to expand the number of senior nominees in terms of getting into the Hall of Fame. I have a simple suggestion. Put in 10 individuals each year in Canton. Five modern-era players, three seniors, one coach and one contributor. While I don’t think adding three seniors per year will completely solve the problem regarding the absence of deserving players from that category, it’s a hell of a lot better than one senior per year.\n\nSo, how do we go about trying to make a change like that? Well, the best way is to go right to the top. And at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, that person is David Baker, who is the President & CEO of that prestigious organization. I have talked with and also met Baker and I was very impressed with him. It’s my feeling that Baker has a very open mind. So, here is how you can contact him.\n\nPro Football Hall of Fame\n\nAttention: David Baker, President & CEO\n\n2121 George Halas DR NW\n\nCanton, Ohio 44708\n\nPlease write Mr. Baker and tell him that the amount of senior nominees needs to be increased to three per year. Again, that won’t solve the daunting problem of getting in all of the deserving seniors who have somehow fallen through the cracks through the years, but it is certainly better than one per year.\n\nThe 2020-21 Milwaukee Bucks can achieve something on Tuesday night that has never happened before in the city of Milwaukee. That is, a team from Cream City winning a major professional sports championship at home.\n\nIn 1957, the Milwaukee Braves, behind the great hitting of Hank Aaron and Eddie Mathews and the great pitching of Warren Spahn and Lew Burdette, won the World Series versus the New York Yankees in seven games. However, Game 7 was played at Yankee Stadium.\n\nThe Braves had a chance to win the 1958 World Series at home, as the team had a 3-2 lead in the Fall Classic with Game 6 and Game 7 at County Stadium. Unfortunately, manager Fred Haney of the Braves decided to let Spahn (in Game 6) and Burdette (in Game 7) each pitch on just two days rest and the Braves lost each game to the Yankees.\n\n50 years ago, under head coach Larry Costello, the 1970-71 Bucks had a 66-16 record in the regular season. The team was led by center Lew Alcindor, who would soon afterward change his name to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Alcindor averaged 31.7 points and 16 rebounds per game and was named the NBA MVP in 1971.\n\nAlcindor, who had led UCLA to three straight national championships before he was drafted by the Bucks, also had one of the greatest players in NBA history as a teammate that year. I’m talking about guard Oscar Robertson. The Bucks had acquired Robertson before the season when Milwaukee shipped guard Flynn Robinson and forward Charlie Paulk to the Cincinnati Royals for Oscar. “The Big O” averaged 19.4 points, 5.7 rebounds and 8.2 assists per game for the Bucks during the 1970-71 season.\n\nThe other three starters for the Bucks, forward Bobby Dandridge (18.4), guard Jon McGlocklin (15.8) and forward Greg Smith (11.7), all averaged in double figures in points. The top two players off the bench for the Bucks, forward Bob Boozer (9.1) and guard Lucius Allen (7.1), were also very effective on the court.\n\nThe Bucks compiled a 12-2 record in the playoffs that season which culminated in a four-game sweep against the Baltimore Bullets in the NBA Finals, as the Bucks won the NBA title. But Game 4 was played at the Baltimore Civic Center, not at the Milwaukee Arena.\n\nThat would be the last time a professional sports team from Milwaukee won a league championship. The Milwaukee Brewers came close in 1982 behind the great play of American League MVP Robin Yount. The Brew Crew did win the ALCS in Milwaukee, but then lost the ultimate championship, the World Series, in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals. Game 7 was also played at Busch Stadium in St. Louis.\n\nNow the Green Bay Packers did win the 1939 NFL title at the Dairy Bowl at State Fair Park in West Allis, which is right outside of Milwaukee. In fact, my dad and my grandfather were there to witness the game and to see stars like Don Hutson and Cecil Isbell in person. Still, it was not a Milwaukee team which won the title in their own backyard.\n\nThat being said…the Packers, the Braves (while they were in Milwaukee), the Bucks and the Brewers have all gotten great support from residents from the entire state of Wisconsin.\n\nWhich takes us to Tuesday night at the Fiserv Forum. The Bucks hold a 3-2 lead in the NBA Finals over the Phoenix Suns. That in itself is very ironic, because both teams came into the NBA at the same time in 1968 and both had a coin flip for the right to draft Alcindor in 1969. The whole scenario and much more, including the 1970-71 championship season, is out in a great new book by Rick Schabowski called From Coin Toss to Championship/1971: The Year of the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nA win on Tuesday night will give the city of Milwaukee it’s first ever championship won at home. Just like it’s been this entire series, the Bucks need to come through with a total team effort. “The Big 3” of the Bucks, forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, forward Khris Middleton and guard Jrue Holiday, all need to play well just like they did in the Game 5 victory in Phoenix.\n\nPlus, players like center Brook Lopez, forward P.J. Tucker, guard Pat Connaughton and forward Bobby Portis have to come up big as well for head coach Mike Budenholzer.\n\nThe Suns have a terrific trio themselves, with guard Devin Booker, guard Chris Paul and center Deandre Ayton.\n\nThe bottom line is that the task will not be easy. It’s been that way for the Bucks this postseason. The team had to come back from a 2-0 deficit in the series against the Brooklyn Nets and also in this series against the Suns. But this has now all evolved to the point of just one more win brings the Bucks the NBA championship.\n\nAnd if that win comes on Tuesday night, it will be the first time a Milwaukee team in a major professional sport, has ever won the league title at home. If it happens, the Fiserv Forum will be rocking. Not to mention the Deer District will be in a state of delirious celebration.\n\nI’ve known that feeling, but in another city. In 2004, I was at Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa when the Tampa Bay Lightning won their first Stanley Cup. I was in a definite state of euphoria as I watched everyone on the team hoist Lord Stanley and skate happily around on the ice.\n\nThis year, the city of Tampa has seen that happen twice. Once with the Tampa Bay Bucs winning Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa and then the Lightning winning their second straight Stanley Cup at the Amalie Arena in Tampa.\n\nMilwaukee has never been able to do that. I have a strong feeling that will change on Tuesday night at the Fiserv Forum.\n\nFear the Deer!\n\nBack in August, it was announced that Drew Pearson of the Dallas Cowboys was selected to be a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2021. I believe it’s honor he definitely deserves.\n\nBut that same honor is true for another receiver who played a decade before Pearson. I’m talking about Boyd Dowler of the Green Bay Packers.\n\nBoth Pearson and Dowler have a lot in common.\n\nFirst, they both played with quarterbacks who were eventually inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Pearson played most of his career in Dallas with Roger Staubach throwing him the ball. Dowler had Bart Starr getting him the ball for almost his entire career in Green Bay.\n\nBoth also played under two of the greatest coaches in NFL history. Pearson played under Tom Landry, while Dowler played under Vince Lombardi.\n\nIn addition, they put up similar stats in their NFL careers during the regular season.\n\nPearson had 489 receptions for 7,822 yards and 48 touchdowns while he played with the Cowboys. Dowler had 474 receptions for 7,270 and 40 touchdowns while he played with the Packers and a short time with the Washington Redskins.\n\nBoth were honored for what they did in the decade they played in. Pearson was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame All-1970s Team. Dowler was named to the Pro Football Hall of Fame All-1960s Team.\n\nPearson was named to three Pro Bowl squads, plus was named All-Pro three times.\n\nDowler was named to two Pro Bowl squads, plus was named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in 1959. In addition to that, Dowler was also named to the second team of the 50th Anniversary Team (named in 1969) and he was joined on that squad by the likes of Sammy Baugh, Bronco Nagurski, Harold “Red” Grange, Forrest Gregg, Raymond Berry, Mike Ditka, Danny Fortman, Mel Hein, Len Ford, Ernie Stautner, Joe Schmidt, Jack Butler, Jack Christiansen and Ernie Nevers.\n\nDowler is the only player on that second team not in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nPlus there is more to really like about what both Pearson and Dowler accomplished during their NFL careers. It’s about what they did in the postseason.\n\nPearson played in 22 postseason games and caught 68 passes for 1,131 and eight touchdowns. No. 88 also played on one Super Bowl championship team.\n\nDowler only played in 10 postseason games, but he caught 30 passes for 440 yards and five scores. No. 86 played on five NFL championship teams, which include wins in Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II. Dowler caught a touchdown pass in the 1961 NFL title game, another in the 1966 NFL title game, two more in the 1967 NFL title game (the “Ice Bowl”) and another one in Super Bowl II.\n\nThe big difference between Pearson and Dowler in the postseason is that Pearson, although he played in twice as many games, never caught a touchdown pass in a championship game, while Dowler caught all five of his in NFL title games. Games that his team eventually won as well.\n\nWhen I was in Canton for a party that the Packers threw for Jerry Kramer just prior to the induction ceremony, I ran into Rick Gosselin (Talk of Fame Network), who is a voter for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Gosselin is on two very important committees for the Hall. One is the Senior Selection Committee and the Contributor Selection Committee.\n\nRick asked me what I was going to do next, as he knew I had been writing and advocating for Kramer’s rightful induction in Canton for years. I told Rick that there several more deserving seniors on the Packers who I would continue to support and write about.\n\nOne of those players was Bobby Dillon, who was inducted to be part of the Class of 2020 in Canton.\n\nRick told me to make sure that I wrote about Gale Gillingham, Ron Kramer and Dowler when I was writing about former Packers who deserve to be in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nI have done that, plus have written about three other Packers (Lavvie Dilweg, Verne Lewellen and Cecil Isbell) who played under Curly Lambeau in Green Bay. All three were finalists like Dillon in 2020, but unfortunately they didn’t get inducted.\n\nPearson was one of the finalists who didn’t get inducted in 2020 too. But he has another chance in 2021. I hope he makes it this time.\n\nI also hope that Dowler at least gets an opportunity to be a finalist. He certainly deserves to be. I mean, if you are among the top 45 players on the NFL 50th Anniversary Team, you should have been a finalist many, many years ago.\n\nBut Dowler still hasn’t gotten that opportunity, nor has Ron Kramer, who was also on that 50th Anniversary Team.\n\nThat definitely needs to change. Maybe it will now if Pearson gets inducted. I believe Drew will get a bust in 2021. Boyd deserves that same honor in the near future.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers won six NFL titles under head coach Curly Lambeau. Those NFL championship teams have been honored by having a number of the players from those teams get inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThat would include Lambeau himself, along with Cal Hubbard, Don Hutson, Johnny “Blood” McNally, Clark Hinkle, Mike Michalske and Arnie Herber.\n\nThere should be at least three other players who also played for the Packers in that era who also deserve a bust in Canton. I’m talking about Lavvie Dilweg, Verne Lewellen and Cecil Isbell.\n\nIn fact, they all came close to getting in the Hall of Fame recently, as all three were among the 20 finalists for the centennial class in 2020.\n\nI heard all about those players from my dad, as we would be eating dinner talking sports while I was growing up. The Lambeau Packers were the ones my dad grew up watching and by the time he was 18 and serving his country in the Pacific during World War II in the Navy, he had seen the Pack win six NFL titles, including one in person, as he and his dad saw the Packers defeat the New York Giants 27-0 at State Fair Park in West Allis (a Milwaukee suburb) in 1939.\n\nSo while I was enamored with the Vince Lombardi Packers in the 1960s and players like Bart Starr, Paul Horning, Jim Taylor, Jerry Kramer, Willie Davis, Ray Nitschke and Herb Adderley, dad made sure that I learned about the earlier version of the Packers under Lambeau.\n\nWhen I watched the Packers of my childhood, I was in awe of the toughness of players like Taylor and Nitschke and would gush about them to my dad. My father agreed with my assessment, but then told me about the toughest player he ever saw play for the Packers when he was a kid. The player he was talking about was Clarke Hinkle.\n\nHinkle played both fullback and linebacker during his playing days and he was ferocious, both as a runner and a tackler. In addition to that, Hinkle was a fine receiver when called upon, plus could also kick and punt.\n\nBut when it came to being just flat out mean and vicious in terms of tenacity, no one could top Hinkle. Not to mention, Hinkle was very talented as well.\n\nThe 5’11”, 202-pound Hinkle played much larger than his size. He joined the Packers in 1932 after playing his college football at Bucknell, which was right after the Packers had won three straight NFL titles (before the playoff era started in 1933).\n\nIn 10 years in the NFL, Hinkle gained 3,860 yards on the ground. When he retired after the 1941 season, that was the NFL record for rushing yards at the time. Hinkle also scored 35 touchdowns on the ground.\n\nIn his career, Hinkle also caught 49 passes for 537 yards and nine more scores. In terms of overall scoring, Hinkle scored 379 points in his career, as he scored 44 touchdowns, kicked 31 extra points and 28 field goals.\n\nPlus just like Lewellen was for the Packers in the 1920s, Hinkle was considered the best punter in the NFL when he played.\n\nOn defense, opponents of the Packers always kept a close eye on Hinkle, as he would bring the lumber on every play. Ken Strong, who is another Hall of Famer who mostly played with the Giants, said this about Hinkle, “When he hit you, you knew you were hit. Bells rang and you felt it all the way to your toes.”\n\nHinkle had a great competition with Bronco Nagurski of the Bears, who also played fullback and linebacker. In fact, both Hinkle and Nagurski were selected to the NFL All-Decade team from the 1930s at fullback. They had a number of collisions with each other when they played in the still fierce rivalry between the Packers and da Bears.\n\nHinkle talked about one of those impacts. “I was carrying the ball and Nagurski charged in to make the tackle. WHAM! We banged into each other. Nagurski had to be removed from the game with a broken nose and two closed eyes. Strangely enough, I suffered no ill effects and was able to continue playing.”\n\nNagurski certainly respected Hinkle, as he once said, “The toughest man I ever played against.”\n\nIn his ten years in the NFL, Hinkle was named first-team All-Pro four times and second-team All-Pro six times. Hinkle also was named to three Pro Bowl teams.\n\nIn 1964, which was the second year of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Hinkle joined Lambeau, Hubbard, Hutson and McNally in Canton, as they were part of the inaugural class the year before.\n\nIn 1972, Hinkle was enshrined into the Packers Hall of Fame.\n\nThere are two practice fields across the street from Lambeau Field, one on each side of the Don Hutson Center. One is Ray Nitschke Field, where the team practices in front of the fans in training camp, while the other is named Clarke Hinkle Field, which is the practice field closest to Lambeau.\n\nThe names for the practice fields are very apropos. Nitschke was as tough as they came during his era in the NFL.\n\nThe same could certainly be said about Hinkle when he played in the NFL.\n\nThe time is getting closer about finding out who will be in the Class of 2020 for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. In 2020, the class will be much larger because of the centennial year of the NFL.\n\nThere will be the five modern-era players, plus 10 seniors, three contributors and two coaches.\n\nLast week the modern-era nominee list was pared down to 25 semifinalists from a total of 122 nominees. One of those players is LeRoy Butler. This is the third straight year that Butler had made it down to the semifinals. But No. 36 has never been a finalist, which is a big step in getting a Gold Jacket, based on what I have heard from Clark Judge, who is voter for the Hall of Fame.\n\nButler, along with Steve Atwater of the Denver Broncos, were named All-Decade in the 1990s at safety. Of the 22 players on that All-Decade team of the ’90s, only Butler and Atwater don’t have a bust in Canton.\n\nThe list of 25 will be pared down to 15 in January and then that group will be taken down to the final five inductees on the day before Super Bowl LIV, which would be on Saturday February 1.\n\nAnother player who is among the 25 modern-era semifinalists has a bit of a Green Bay connection. I’m talking about Clay Matthews Jr., who is the father of Clay Matthews III, who played with the Packers from 2009 through 2018 and is the all-time leader in sacks for the Packers with 83.5 and was also named to six Pro Bowl squads.\n\nNo. 52 was a big reason why the Packers won Super Bowl XLV over the Pittsburgh Steelers when he helped to force a fumble during a key point of the game.\n\nI’ll be writing a piece on Clay Jr. in the near future about why he deserves a place among the best of the best in Canton, which just happens to include his brother Bruce.\n\nIn terms of the seniors, the group of over 200 nominees will also be trimmed to 20 at some point in the very near future.\n\nThis group will be determined by a 25-person “blue-ribbon panel”, which consists of 13 current Hall of Fame voters, as well as some well known NFL names.\n\nThe panelists are Ernie Accorsi, Bill Belichick, Jarrett Bell, Joel Bussert, John Clayton, Frank Cooney, John Czarnecki, Rick Gosselin, Elliott Harrison, Joe Horrigan, Ira Kaufman, Dick LeBeau, Jeff Legwold, John Madden, John McClain, Gary Myers, Ozzie Newsome, Sal Paolantonio, Carl Peterson, Bill Polian, Dan Pompei, Charean Williams, Chris Willis, Barry Wilner, and Ron Wolf.\n\nThe panel will eventually name the 10 seniors, the three contributors and two coaches without needing a vote from the 48-person selection committee, which used to be the process in the past.\n\nBut because 2020 is a special centennial year for the NFL, this group of 15 will be inducted into the Hall once the list if finalized by the panel.\n\nThe Packers have a number of senior nominees who deserve a place in Canton in my opinion. And I believe that one of those seniors will be part of the Class of 2020.\n\nThe list of seniors for the Packers includes Boyd Dowler, who was an All-Decade player in the 1960s, plus was on the NFL 50th anniversary team.\n\nPlus there is Ron Kramer, who was also on that 50th anniversary team.\n\nDowler and Kramer are the only two members of that 45-man team without a bust in Canton.\n\nJerry Kramer was another member of that 50th anniversary team and he finally got his rightful due and was inducted in 2018.\n\nThere are a few other All-Decade players who are senior nominees for the Packers. One is Lavvie Dilweg, who was All-Decade in the 1920s, while another is Cecil Isbell, who was All-Decade in the 1930s.\n\nDilweg is the only first-team member from that All-Decade team of the ’20s not in Canton, while Isbell is the only All-Decade quarterback not to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nAnother former Packer who was named All-Decade in the 1960s was Don Chandler. The former Florida Gator played most of his career with the New York Giants, both as a kicker and a punter, but also played three years with Green Bay from 1965 through 1967.\n\nThe Packers won the NFL title in each of those years, which also included the first two Super Bowls. Chandler was named as the punter on the All-Decade team of the ’60s.\n\nBeing named All-Decade is supposedly one of the key factors that the 25-person blue ribbon panel will use in their determination of the final group of 10 seniors.\n\nThat certainly helps players like Dowler, Dilweg and Isbell.\n\nBut there are a number of other former Packers were dominant players in their day and came very close to being named All-Decade.\n\nI’m talking about Verne Lewellen in the 1920s, Bobby Dillon in the 1950s, (Ron) Kramer in the 1960s, Gale Gillingham in the 1970s and Sterling Sharpe in the 1990s.\n\nLewellen was considered the premiere punter of his era, when punting was truly an art form in the era of “three yards and a cloud of dust” in the NFL of the ’20s. There was no punter named on the All-Decade team of the 20s.\n\nPlus, Lewellen was multi-talented, as he scored more touchdowns than anyone who played in the NFL while he was a player, plus once led the NFL in interceptions one season.\n\nDillon intercepted 52 passes in just eight seasons in the NFL. One of the people who will be on the blue ribbon panel, Ron Wolf, is a big fan of Dillon.\n\n“He was a 9.7 sprinter coming out of the University of Texas and would be a corner in today’s game,” Wolf said. “But back then the best athletes were put inside. In order to qualify for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, I believe you are talking about the best of the best. Bobby Dillon is one of those from his era. Witness the fact that (safeties) Jack Christiansen, Yale Lary and Emlen Tunnell are in the Hall. Dillon accomplished more than those particular players did in the same era. He was a rare football player, the best defensive back of his time.”\n\nKramer was considered among the best three tight ends in football when he played in the 1960s and the other two, Mike Ditka and John Mackey, are in Canton.\n\nGillingham was considered the one of the top guards in the NFL for several years and most likely would have been named All-Decade in the 1970s had not head coach Dan Devine foolishly moved No. 68 to defensive tackle for the 1972 season.\n\nNot only was that move ridiculous, but a knee injury cost Gillingham almost the entire ’72 season.\n\nWhen Sharpe played from 1988 through 1994 before a neck injury ended his career, only Jerry Rice was considered to be above No. 84 in terms of stature at the wide receiver position.\n\nAnother former Packer who deserves consideration for a place in the Hall is Fred “Fuzzy” Thurston. The first trade Vince Lombardi ever made once he became head coach and general manager of the Packers, was to acquire Thurston from the Colts.\n\nThurston, along with Kramer, made the power sweep the signature play of the Packers in the Lombardi era. The two guards would pull out and get to the second and third levels with their blocks, as Jimmy Taylor and Paul Hornung would continually and consistently gain large chunks of yardage.\n\nBased on my discussions with people like Rick Gosselin and Judge, I believe the two best possibilities in terms of being named as a senior for the Packers as part of the Class of 2020, are Dowler and Dilweg.\n\nBut I believe only one Packer will get in as a senior in 2020.\n\nWe should know something very soon.\n\nI also believe Jack Vainisi has a chance to be one of the three contributors for the Class of 2020. If not that class, he should be put in the Hall of Fame in the near future.\n\nWolf should know all about Vainisi’s prowess as a scout in the 1950s for the Packers. There are seven Packers who Vainisi drafted in the ’50s who are now in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nI’m talking about Jim Ringo, Forrest Gregg, Bart Starr, Hornung, Taylor, Ray Nitschke and (Jerry) Kramer.\n\nPlus, it was Vainisi who also drafted Dillon, (Ron) Kramer and Dowler.\n\nVainisi also played a pivotal role in bringing Lombardi to Green Bay in 1959.\n\nThese are my observations as the hourglass continues to run down regarding who from the Packers could be in the Class of 2020 for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nWe will know soon enough.\n\nWhen I was growing up in the 1960s in Milwaukee, the discussion at the dinner table at our home would almost always be about sports. My dad would give me history lessons on the teams in the state, the Milwaukee Braves, the Wisconsin Badgers and the Green Bay Packers.\n\nNow we also talked about the current teams, as I was a big fan of players like Hank Aaron, Eddie Mathews and Warren Spahn of the Braves, Pat Richter and Ron Vander Kelen of the Badgers, plus Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, Paul Hornung, Boyd Dowler, Willie Davis, Herb Adderley, Jerry Kramer and many others on the Packers.\n\nThe Packers received most of the attention at the kitchen table, as there were in the midst of dominating the 1960s like no other team in NFL history had ever done before.\n\nDad loved telling me about the Packers he grew up watching. He told me stories about Curly Lambeau and all the players who played under him like Lavvie Dilweg, Clarke Hinkle, Johnny “Blood” McNally, Cal Hubbard, Verne Lewellen, Arnie Herber, Don Hutson and Cecil Isbell.\n\nJust like I was spoiled watching the Packers win five NFL titles in seven years in the 1960s, which included the first two Super Bowls under head coach Vince Lombardi, my dad saw the Packers win six NFL championships under Lambeau by the time he was 18 years-old, while he was serving his country in the Pacific with the Navy in World War II.\n\nWhen dad talked about the Lambeau Packers, he almost always told me some Don Hutson stories and the men who threw to No. 14, Herber and Isbell.\n\nHutson and Herber are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while Isbell is not. In fact, Isbell is the only NFL All-Decade quarterback (1930s) not in Canton.\n\nTo me, the only reason is because his career was so short. Still, the NFL recognized how prolific Isbell was in throwing the football with him just playing two years in the 1930s, that he was named on that All-Decade team at quarterback along with Herber and Earl “Dutch” Clark of the Portsmouth Spartans/Detroit Lions.\n\nThe reason why Herber and Isbell got so much attention at quarterback was because of the record-breaking productivity of Hutson at wide receiver. To illustrate that, Hutson led the league in receiving eight times.\n\nSome of that production came when Herber was the quarterback, but a lot of it came from when Isbell played QB.\n\nIn fact, for five years, between 1938 and 1942, Isbell would throw half the passes, for half the yardage and half the touchdowns Hutson would have during his 11-year career.\n\nAnd to put a spotlight on it, Hutson’s two highest reception totals, two of his three highest yardage totals and three of his four highest touchdown totals all came when No. 17 was throwing him the football.\n\nOne of my dad’s biggest thrills was being at the 1939 NFL title game at State Fair Park in West Allis (suburb of Milwaukee) with his own dad, when the Packers hosted the New York Giants.\n\nBoth Herber and Isbell played quarterback for the Packers in that game and each threw a touchdown pass. Isbell had a perfect 158.3 passer rating in the game. Isbell also rushed for 27 yards.\n\nMy dad and grandpa, along with 32,277 other fans, saw the Packers defeat the G-Men 27-0.\n\nRemember that Isbell made the NFL All-Decade team of the 1930s, even though he was a rookie in 1938 and only played two years in that decade. Why was that? For one thing, he helped lead the Packers into two straight NFL title games at the beginning of his career. Also, it was his record-breaking production at quarterback, as he was throwing the ball more effectively than anyone who had ever played the position.\n\nPlus he seemed to get better each year he played. Over the five years he played in the NFL, Isbell threw 61 touchdown passes versus 52 interceptions for 5,945 yards. That added up to a passer rating of 72.6.\n\nBy today’s standards, that doesn’t look like much, but in the 1930s and ’40s in the NFL, that was outstanding.\n\nAs an example, let’s compare the numbers of Isbell to those of Hall of Famer Sammy Baugh of the Washington Redskins in his first five years in the NFL. Baugh’s rookie year was in 1937, so this lines up very well in comparison to Isbell.\n\nBaugh threw 41 touchdown passes in his first five years in the NFL (compared to Isbell’s 61), while he also threw 63 picks (compared to Isbell’s 52). That put Slingin’ Sammy’s passer rating at 57.7 his first five years in the league.\n\nIn Isbell’s last two years with the Packers, he threw 39 of his career 61 touchdown passes. 27 of those touchdown tosses went to Hutson.\n\nThe 24 touchdown passes that Isbell threw in 1942 was a Green Bay record that stood for 41 years with the Packers until Lynn Dickey threw 32 TD passes in 1983.\n\nAs Ron Borges noted in his piece on Isbell in the Talk of Fame Network, Isbell played out of this world the last two years of his NFL career.\n\nIn 1941, the average NFL quarterback accounted for 6.122 points per game. Isbell accounted for 12 (121 points in 10 games), which put his production 98.99 percent above the norm.\n\nThe following season, his last, was even more remarkable. That’s the year he threw a then-record 24 touchdown passes. That season he was 117 percent above the league norm in points accounted for by a quarterback and 62 percent better than the great Sammy Baugh, who passed for 497 fewer yards and eight fewer touchdowns than Isbell that season.\n\nAfter the 1942 season, Isbell retired at the age of 27 to become an assistant coach at his alma mater, Purdue. Isbell made more money at Purdue as a coach than he did in Green Bay as a player with the Packers.\n\nWhy was that? Isbell explained it best.\n\n“I hadn’t been up in Green Bay long when I saw Lambeau go around the locker room and tell players like Herber and (Milt) Ganterbein and (Hank) Bruder that they were all done with the Packers,” Isbell said. “I sat there and watched, and then I vowed it never would happen to me. I’d quit before they came around to tell me.’’\n\nBottom line, Isbell was as good or better than any quarterback who played in his era. As good or better than Herber, Baugh or Sid Luckman of the Chicago Bears.\n\nThe Packers certainly recognized that when Isbell was inducted into their Hall of Fame in 1972.\n\nWhen Ken Stabler was finally and rightfully inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016, that meant that Isbell is the only NFL All-Decade quarterback not in Canton.\n\nThat needs to change at some point.\n\nAlthough it has to get final approval from it’s board in early August, the Pro Football Hall of Fame is definitely considering expanding it’s Centennial Class of 2020 as part of the NFL’s 100th-anniversary celebration.\n\nPro Football Hall of Fame President and CEO David Baker made the announcement earlier this month.\n\n“It is extremely elite company, and it’s not the Hall of very, very good. It’s the Hall of Fame, and so it should be difficult to make it,” Baker said. “But there’s a lot of guys through the years (who deserve to be honored but have not). We have several guys who are on all-decade teams who aren’t in the Hall of Fame. And, so, this is an opportunity with the Centennial coming up. And what we’ve looked at potentially and has been approved, at least in concept, by our operating board, but we’re going to have to go through the full board, is that potentially we would have 20 Hall of Famers enshrined for the year 2020.\n\n“Normally, (like) this year, we have eight. So, this would be quite a few guys (added). But it would be the five normal modern-era players elected from 15 finalists, and then 10 seniors, three contributors — like Gil (Brandt) — and two (coaches). But again, I want to stress that that’s got to be something that’s passed by our board at its meeting on Friday, Aug. 2.”\n\nMost observers expect this proposal to pass.\n\nSo what does this mean from the perspective of the Green Bay Packers? To me, that means that the team has a chance to add even more members of the organization among the best of the best in Canton. Currently, the Packers have 25 individuals in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Pro Football Hall of Fame is a hallowed place. I was there in 2018 when Jerry Kramer finally received his rightful enshrinement in Canton. A number of members of Packer Nation were in Canton that weekend, including Glenn Aveni, who is filming a documentary about Jerry, while I am working on a book about No. 64.\n\nIn 2020, Kramer has a chance to be joined by others who played in the town where the Fox River runs through it.\n\nAdding 10 seniors in 2020 was spawned by the proposal of Rick Gosselin, who is on the Seniors Selection Committee for the Hall of Fame. Actually, Gosselin wanted even more seniors added, due the backlog of deserving seniors who have fallen through the cracks through the years, but 10 is certainly better than just two or one per year, which has been the process recently.\n\nGosselin carries a big voice among Hall of Fame voters and when I told him that I would be writing a series of articles about former players from the Packers who I believe belong in Canton, Gosselin made a point of making sure I wrote about three of them.\n\nThose players are Boyd Dowler, Ron Kramer and Gale Gillingham.\n\nI also know that Gosselin is high on Lavvie Dilweg and Bobby Dillon.\n\nI have also written about Packer seniors like Fuzzy Thurston and Don Chandler. Plus there are also former Packer players like Cecil Isbell and Verne Lewellen.\n\nBut with only 10 spots available among the group of seniors, I still think the Packers have an excellent chance of getting a least one player inducted, perhaps even two.\n\nAs Baker noted in his comments and as Gosselin has written about, there are a number of all-decade players not in Canton. You can also break that down even further, as there are nine first-team, all-decade players through the year 2000 that are not in the Hall of Fame.\n\nGosselin writes about seven of those players here.\n\nOne of those players is Dilweg, who was given that designation in the 1920s when he played under head coach Curly Lambeau, who incidentally also received that same honor as a player that decade.\n\nAnother is LeRoy Butler, who was First-Team, All-Decade in the 1990s, but is not considered a senior as of yet. If Butler is part of the Class of 2020, he would go in as a modern-era player.\n\nIn terms of getting some seniors in for the Packers in 2020, I believe the best bet after Dilweg is Dowler. No. 86 was also All-Decade in the 1960s (Second-Team), but in addition to that, Boyd was also one of 45 players on the NFL 50th anniversary team. Only Dowler and [Ron] Kramer have not been given busts in Canton from that 50th anniversary team.\n\nKramer would probably have been All-Decade in the 1960s had the team had more than one tight end.\n\nPlus, Gillingham almost certainly would have been All-Decade at guard in the 1970s had not head coach Dan Devine ridiculously moved No. 68 to defensive tackle in which Gillingham suffered a season-ending knee injury early in the 1972 campaign. Most experts felt that Gillingham was the best right guard in the NFL when Devine made that colossal coaching blunder.\n\nThe Packers also have a chance to add another member of their organization into the Hall via the contributor category. To me, Jack Vainisi would be an excellent choice.\n\nVainisi was the super scout of the Packers from 1950 through 1960. In those years, Vainisi helped to select seven players for the Packers who would eventually get into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThose players are Jim Ringo, Forrest Gregg, Bart Starr, Paul Hornung, Jim Taylor, Ray Nitschke and Jerry Kramer.\n\nThat number could go up to eight if Dowler is part of the Class of 2020.\n\nBottom line, it was the scouting expertise of Vainisi which laid the foundation for the Packers to win five NFL titles (including the first two Super Bowls) in seven years under head coach Vince Lombardi in the 1960s.\n\nI have always been an optimistic person. Add to that, I’m very passionate and persistent regarding my beliefs, especially when talking about former players on the Packers who deserve a bust in Canton.\n\nThat was my credo about getting Kramer into the Pro Football Hall of Fame going back almost 30 years ago. I first met Jerry in 1991 when he was at a golfing event prior to Super Bowl XXV in Tampa.\n\nI showed Jerry a letter that I had written to Packer Report about why No. 64 deserved to be in Canton. Jerry was touched. Little did I know that I would actually be writing for Packer Report myself about a decade later at the beginning of my writing career. Since then, I have penned countless articles about why Kramer deserved a bust in Canton.\n\nThen it really happened in 2018.\n\nThe biggest breakthroughs from my perspective of getting Kramer his rightful place in the Hall of Fame came from three different areas.\n\nOne was getting inside the process by developing a relationship with Gosselin. It was then when I learned how extremely difficult it was to get deserving seniors into Canton. The backlog of seniors who should already be in the Hall is a very difficult task to solve. Why? There are currently over 60 position players who were named on an all-decade team who still don’t have a bust in Canton.\n\nThat includes both Dilweg and Dowler.\n\nI was also able to have a nice conversation with Baker about a year before Kramer was enshrined. I learned some very valuable insight from the President of the Hall of Fame during our chat.\n\nFinally, I was also able to talk with Bart Starr Jr. about whether or not his father endorsed Kramer about getting a bust in Canton. I learned that there was no doubt that Bart Sr. wholeheartedly was an advocate for Kramer’s enshrinement into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAnd then that special moment came. The day of the enshrinement I went to party thrown by the Packers to honor Kramer. One of the first people I ran into was Gosselin. Rick asked me, “So, what are you going to do now?”\n\nI told Gosselin that there were more deserving Packers who belong in Canton and that I was going to get behind them as well. I told Rick to expect more calls and notes from me over the next year. Which is exactly what has happened.\n\nThe optimist part of me tells me that the Packers could get two seniors in as part of the Class of 2020. I believe that Dilweg and Dowler are those two seniors. Dilweg has the better chance if only one Packer senior is named in 2020, but Dowler is also a strong possibility in my opinion.\n\nThat means the fight for Gillingham, [Ron] Kramer and the other players to get into Canton will have to continue on past 2020.\n\nIn terms of Vainisi and Butler, I’m sort of on the fence (50/50) with them in 2020. Now don’t get me wrong, both will eventually get into the Hall, but it may not be in the centennial year of the NFL.\n\nThe bottom line is the Packers have an excellent chance of having some representation in Canton for the 2020 Class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have won 13 NFL championships, which is the most in league history. The next closest team to that total is the Chicago Bears, who have won nine NFL titles.\n\nYet, da Bears have 28 members of their team in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while the Packers have just 25. Something seems amiss to me here.\n\nHere are the Packers who have a bust in Canton:\n\nThey are Curly Lambeau (Class of 1963), Robert “Cal” Hubbard (Class of 1963), Don Hutson (Class of 1963), Johnny “Blood” McNally (Class of 1963), Clarke Hinkle (Class of 1964), Mike Michalske (Class of 1964), Arnie Herber (Class of 1966), Vince Lombardi (Class of 1971), Tony Canadeo (Class of 1974), Jim Taylor (Class of 1976), Forrest Gregg (Class of 1977), Bart Starr (Class of 1977), Ray Nitschke (Class of 1978), Herb Adderley (Classof 1980), Willie Davis (Class of 1981), Jim Ringo (Class of 1981), Paul Hornung (Class of 1986), Willie Wood (Class of 1989), Henry Jordan (Class of 1995), James Lofton (Class of 2003), Reggie White (Class of 2006), Dave Robinson (Class of 2013), Ron Wolf (Class of 2015), Brett Favre (Class of 2016) and Jerry Kramer (Class of 2018).\n\nNow here are the Bears who are in the Hall of Fame:\n\nThey are George Halas (Class of 1963), Bronco Nagurski (Class of 1963), Harold “Red” Grange (Class of 1963), Ed Healey (Class of 1964), William Lyman (Class of 1964), George Trafton (Class of 1964), Paddy Driscoll (Class of 1965), Dan Fortmann (Class of 1965), Sid Luckman (Class of 1965), George McAfee (Class of 1966), Bulldog Turner (Class of 1966), Joe Stydahar (Class of 1967), Bill Hewitt (Class of 1971), Bill George (Class of 1974, George Connor (Class of 1975), Gale Sayers (Class of 1977), Dick Butkus (Class of 1979), George Blanda (Class of 1981), George Musso (Class of 1982), Doug Atkins (Class of 1982), Mike Ditka (Class of 1988), Stan Jones (Class of 1991), Walter Payton (Class of 1993), Jim Finks (Class of 1995), Mike Singletary (Class of 1998), Dan Hampton (Class of 2002), Richard Dent (Class of 2011) and Brian Urlacher (Class of 2018).\n\nNow let’s look at the years the Packers have won the NFL title:\n\nThe years are 1929, 1930, 1931, 1936, 1939, 1944, 1961, 1962, 1965, 1966, 1967, 1996 and 2010.\n\nHere are the NFL titles won by da Bears:\n\n1921, 1932, 1933, 1940, 1941, 1943, 1946, 1963 and 1986.\n\nThe Bears were in the league right from the start in 1920 (when it was the American Professional Football Association), while the Packers joined the league in 1921.\n\nBoth the Bears and Packers each won six NFL titles through 1946. Yet, Chicago has 11 players recognized in Canton who played on some of those teams, while the Packers only have eight.\n\nThat tells you something right there.\n\nNow I’m not saying that the members of the Bears from those teams don’t deserve to have a place in Canton. They absolutely do.\n\nWhat I’m saying is that more Packers from that era deserve a place among the best of the best in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nPlayers like Lavvie Dilweg, Verne Lewellen and Cecil Isbell.\n\nDilweg was a First-Team member of the All-Decade team of the 1920s in the NFL. He is the only member of that All-Decade team not in Canton. Dilweg was named First-Team All-Pro team six times and was also a second-team selection at All-Pro once. There was no Pro Bowl (started in 1938) when Dilweg played.\n\nThe former Marquette star set all the Green Bay receiving records until a fellow by the name of Don Huston came on the scene. Dilweg was part of the squad that won three consecutive NFL titles from 1929 through 1931. This was prior to the playoff era in the NFL. Unbelievably, Dilweg has never been a finalist for the Hall of Fame.\n\nDilweg was also the grandfather of Anthony Dilweg, who played quarterback for the Packers in 1989 and 1990.\n\nLewellen was also part of the team which won three straight NFL titles in 1929, 1930 and 1931. The former Nebraska star was a do-it-all type of player. Lewellen rushed for 2,410 career yards and 37 TDs, passed for 2,076 yards and threw nine TDs and gained another 1,240 yards receiving and had 12 more scores.\n\nLewellen was also the Green Bay punter, as he averaged 39.5 yards per kick. Lewellen was named All-Pro four times and should have been named to the NFL All-Decade team of the 1920s like Dilweg was. Also like Dilweg, Lewellen has never been a Hall of Fame finalist.\n\nThen there is Isbell, who had a short five-year career before he retired. But what a great career he had in those five years. Isbell was a two-time First-Team All-Pro and a three-time Second-Team All-Pro. Isbell also went to four Pro Bowls.\n\nIsbell was so prolific throwing the ball to Don Hutson, that he was named to the NFL All-Decade team of the 1930s. From 1920 through 2000, there have been 21 quarterbacks selected to the All-Decade teams. All but Isbell are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nThe two best years that Hutson ever had were in 1941 and 1942 when Isbell was throwing him the ball. In 1941, Hutson caught 58 passes from Isbell for 738 yards and 10 touchdowns. In 1942, Hutson caught 74 passes from Isbell for 1,211 yards and 17 touchdowns. In ’42, Hutson became the first-ever 1,000 yard receiver.\n\nThe NFL was mostly a three yards and a cloud of dust league before Hutson came into the league. That all changed when No. 14 became a huge receiving threat and had Isbell throwing him the ball.\n\nIn his short career, Isbell threw 61 touchdown passes versus 52 interceptions for 5,945 yards. He was not a bad runner either, as he rushed for 1,522 yards and 10 scores. Isbell also found time to catch 15 passes.\n\nSo if you can make the case for 11 Bears to be in the Hall of Fame because of the six NFL titles won through 1946, you can also say that the Packers, who also won six championships during that time, deserve more than eight players in Canton from those teams.\n\nDilweg, Lewellen and Isbell are three more that should definitely have busts right now.\n\nPlus, there are the other Packers who deserve consideration for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. I have written about a number of them. Players like Bobby Dillon, Ron Kramer, Boyd Dowler, Fuzzy Thurston, Don Chandler, Gale Gillingham and Sterling Sharpe.\n\nPlus you have to also consider players like Bob Skoronski and LeRoy Butler.\n\nAnd we can’t forget scout Jack Vainisi either. Vainisi was just as responsible for the success of the Packers of the 1960s, as Ron Wolf was for the Packers of the 1990s.\n\nSo, will the Packers ever catch the Bears in terms of having as many or more individuals in the Pro Football Hall of Fame? Well, the Pack certainly has some excellent candidates to get a bust in Canton.\n\nPlus there is this. The Packers now have a 96-93-6 advantage (regular season) in their series against the Bears dating back to 1921. But it wasn’t until last season that the Packers were able to get ahead in the series for the first time since 1932.\n\nThe Packers and Bears are also 1-1 against each other in the postseason, which includes the 2010 NFC title game at Soldier Field, when Green Bay won 21-14.\n\nThe bottom line is that the Packers are the most successful franchise in NFL history. They have proven that with their league-leading 13 NFL championships. But some of the great players who helped win some of those championships have been ignored by the Hall of Fame.\n\nThat needs to change.\n\nPlus there are players like Dillon, who played on mostly bad teams in Green Bay in the 1950s. Or Gillingham or who played on mostly bad or mediocre teams except for his first two years in the NFL (1966 and 1967) when he played for the Super Bowl I and the Super Bowl II champion Packers.\n\nGillingham was also on the 1972 Green Bay team which won the NFC Central title, but he missed almost the entire season due to a knee injury after Dan Devine ridiculously decided to move him to defensive tackle.\n\nPlaying on mostly bad teams didn’t stop voters from putting Sayers and Butkus in the Hall of Fame. Neither No. 40 or No. 51 ever played in a NFL postseason game. But they were both among the best of the best at their position when they played in the NFL.\n\nThat is also true of all the Packers I have mentioned.\n\nAnd that’s why the Packers deserve more recognition in terms of individuals who belong in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\n***Note: This story was originally published two years ago.\n\nI was born in 1957. That year is special in the hearts of sports fans in Wisconsin. In 1957, Lambeau Field (then new City Stadium) was built to become the new home of the Green Bay Packers, while the Milwaukee Braves also won the World Series that special year.\n\nI grew up in a great sports era, as the Packers won five NFL titles in seven years (including the first two Super Bowls) under Vince Lombardi from 1961 to 1967. I saw the Packers in person on a number of occasions.\n\nPlus I was able to see great baseball players like Henry Aaron, Eddie Mathews and Warren Spahn of the Braves play many times while they were still in Milwaukee.\n\nMy dad, Norman Fox, was always there with me.\n\nMy passion for sports came from his talks with me. Dad gave me history lessons about the various sports teams, whether it was about the Packers, the Braves or the Wisconsin Badgers. I was also educated about a number of professional sports teams that no longer existed or had moved from Wisconsin.\n\nDad loved to tell me stories about the Packers back in the Curly Lambeau days when he was growing up.\n\nDad would quiz me about my knowledge at the dinner table just about every night at our home in Milwaukee. I’m happy to say that I passed with flying colors. Why? I had a great instructor.\n\nMy father and mentor passed away on Monday at age 88. I now have a big void in my life. But the lessons he taught me will always remain with me.\n\nBecause of dad, I loved all sports, but especially football.\n\nWe were both spoiled by the Packers at an early age. Dad was born in 1926, and the Packers won six NFL titles under Lambeau by his 18th birthday, with the last one coming in 1944. Dad was serving his country in the Pacific then with the Navy in World War II.\n\nWhile I was enamored with players like Bart Starr, Paul Hornung, Jimmy Taylor, Jerry Kramer, Max McGee, Boyd Dowler, Ray Nitschke, Willie Davis, Herb Adderley and so many others in the 1960s, dad made sure I also learned about the Packers of his era.\n\nI was told stories about the great Don Hutson, as well as learning about players like Clarke Hinkle, Cecil Isbell, Johnny (Blood) McNally, Cal Hubbard, Arnie Herber, Mike Michalske and Tony Canadeo.\n\nDad went to a number of games to see the Packers, both in Milwaukee and Green Bay in those days. In Milwaukee, he would see the Packers play at State Fair Park many times, including the 1939 NFL Championship Game that was played there, as the Packers beat the New York Giants 27-0.\n\nDad also parked cars at old Marquette Stadium in Milwaukee when the Packers played there for one season in 1952. After that, he saw the Packers play many times at old County Stadium, where I was often with him.\n\nDad also traveled to Green Bay to see the Packers play at both old City Stadium and also the new City Stadium, which later was named Lambeau Field in 1965 in honor of the first head coach and one of the founders of the franchise.\n\nGoing to training camp is something I really enjoy. I learned that from my dad, although I never came away with a football like he did, nor did I ever see the Chicago Bears train.\n\nThe Bears trained at St. John’s Military Academy in Delafield, Wisconsin in 1935. Dad and some buddies watched them practice one day. During practice, an errant punt went over the fence and dad scampered to get it.\n\nDad retrieved the ball and then never stopped running. He was sprinting away from the Bears just like he was a running back for the Packers like Johnny (Blood).\n\nHe told me he never ran so fast, as players and coaches for the Bears were yelling at him to come back with the football. But he never did, and he came home with the football that day.\n\nDad was an amazing athlete. One time, a few years after his football caper with the Bears, he and a couple of friends rode their bikes around Lake Michigan. It took them several days to accomplish this feat, but they did it.\n\nThroughout the years, dad and I stayed true to the Packers, even in the lean years. Dad and my mom moved to the Tampa, Florida area in 1983 when they retired, but his loyalty to the Packers continued.\n\nI ended up moving to the Sunshine State myself a while after my parents did. I soon met my future wife, Pam. We ended up living in proximity of my parent’s house. Dad and I ended up going to a number of games between the Packers and the Buccaneers at old Tampa Stadium during that time.\n\nWe always had a great time. Before, during and after the game. One time we went to a tailgate party which had Ray Nitschke in attendance. Dad really enjoyed seeing No. 66. After a while, it was time to get to the stadium for the game, and I was looking for dad.\n\nI found him near the brat table. He had a brat in each hand, as they had run out of hot dog buns. No matter, those brats were going down!\n\nThe Packers became a force again in the NFL starting in 1992, and that continues to this day. Dad really enjoyed the resurgence of the team, as the Packers won Super Bowl XXXI in that era.\n\nHe enjoyed watching the Packers when they were quarterbacked by Brett Favre, but he really liked the way the Packers played behind quarterback Aaron Rodgers. It didn’t hurt that he sort of looked like No. 12 when he was a young man.\n\nDad was a happy camper when the Packers won Super Bowl XLV behind the play of Rodgers.\n\nAfter my mom passed away in 2007, I became the primary caregiver for my dad, as he had been dealing with a number of medical issues for many years, including beating colon cancer twice.\n\nI have taken my dad to our summer home on Lake Michigan for the past seven years for three months or so each summer. The place is just an hour or so south of Green Bay, so I was able to get to check out training camp on many occasions.\n\nOver the last seven summers, my bond with my dad became even stronger. I always made sure that he would tell the stories he had told me about the early Packers to my friends when they would come out and visit.\n\nThe stories never got old as I would grill some brats and then play some sheepshead with dad and some buddies.\n\nThose memories will always stay with me, as will the reminiscing of spending quality time with my dad as a youngster.\n\nYou see, Norm Fox was not only my father and mentor, but also my friend."
