With previous Southeastern Conference experience at LSU and Missouri, Elarbee enters his fourth season on Rocky Top and his eighth working alongside head coach Josh Heupel.\n\nTHE ELARBEE FILE\n\nPERSONAL INFORMATION\n\nBorn: Feb. 27, 1980\n\nHometown: Carrollton, Georgia\n\nEducation: Middle Tennessee, 2002 (bachelor’s in math education); Middle Tennessee, 2004 (master’s in sports education)\n\nWife: Holly\n\nChildren: Griffin\n\nCOACHING HISTORY\n\n2003-04: Middle Tennessee, Graduate Assistant\n\n2005: Middle Tennessee, Tight Ends\n\n2006: East Central (Miss.)

That figure ranked ninth nationally. The run game success, bolstered by a veteran offensive line, allowed Tennessee to finish top 20 nationally in total offense with 448.1 yards per game. Elarbee’s unit was struck with a rash of injuries throughout 2023, and he worked five different starting combinations that still managed to allow the fourth-fewest sack total in the league (1.85 per game).\n\nCenter Cooper Mays, who missed the first five games of the year due to injury, stabilized the offensive line upon his return and did not allow a sack all season. He earned Associated Press All-SEC honors and was an honorable mention All-America selection by Phil Steele. Tackles John Campbell Jr. and Dayne Davis received SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week accolades during the campaign.\n\nMeanwhile, the Vols were once again recognized as Joe Moore Award semifinalists for their effort in 2023. Under Elarbee’s tutelage, Tennessee joined Oregon, Georgia and Michigan as the only programs to earn semifinalist recognition in back-to-back seasons of 2022 and 2023.\n\nElarbee’s 2022 offensive line left its mark as one of the best in school history as the Vols won 11 games, including six over ranked opponents, en route to an Orange Bowl title. It was Elarbee’s line that set the tone with physicality and relentless effort, paving the way for an offense that led the nation in scoring (46.1 ppg) and total yards (525.5 ypg). The Vols shattered 13 single-season team offensive records, including yards per play (7.2), touchdowns (79) and first downs (330).\n\nDriven by the spectacular play of veterans Darnell Wright and Jerome Carvin, Tennessee was recognized as a semifinalist for the Joe Moore Award for the first time in school history. In addition, the Vols were the only SEC program that produced four different players named SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week during the 2022 campaign. Wright earned the honor twice with dominant performances over No. 3 Alabama and No. 19 Kentucky. Carvin got the nod in a win over UT Martin, and center Cooper Mays and guard Javontez Spraggins received the award in victories against Missouri and Florida, respectively.\n\nWright shined during the best season of his career under Elarbee’s watch. A first-team All-SEC recipient and semifinalist for the Rotary Lombardi Award, he started all 13 games at right tackle and saw action on 895 snaps with no sacks allowed. Highlights included a forceful performance against Alabama edge rusher Will Anderson and a clean outing against Clemson in the Orange Bowl to cap his career.\n\nFollowing the season, Wright’s stock continued to skyrocket as he became the talk of the Senior Bowl and the NFL Combine. In April, Wright concluded an incredible two-year run under Elarbee when he became the highest drafted SEC offensive lineman, going No. 10 overall in the first round of the 2023 NFL Draft to the Chicago Bears. Wright was the second-highest selected offensive lineman of the entire draft, and he became the Vols’ 47th all-time first round pick.\n\nCarvin, who saw action in more games than any position player in UT history, reunited with former teammate Trey Smith as he inked a free agent deal with the Kansas City Chiefs following the 2023 NFL Draft. The mainstay guard allowed only one sack in two regular seasons under Elarbee.\n\nUpon his arrival, Elarbee transformed the Volunteers’ offensive line in 2021 as it anchored a unit that shattered eight then-single-season offensive records, including points (511), total offensive yards (6,174), touchdowns (67), point after touchdowns made (67), total first downs (316), rushing first downs (164), fewest interceptions thrown (3) and passing efficiency (167.10).\n\nPutting together a roster in just one season and overcoming a rash of injuries, Elarbee’s group was named to the Joe Moore Award Midseason Honor Roll. Tennessee’s line paved the way for a rushing attack that enjoyed the most significant improvement of any FBS team, jumping from 84th to 11th nationally (+73 increase) in Elarbee’s first year as the Vols put up 217.8 yards per game.\n\nOverall, Tennessee averaged 6.5 yards per offensive play, which ranked 17th nationally and the program’s best mark since 1993. The Vols also tallied a stellar 39.3 points per game – seventh in the FBS – and 474.9 total yards per game – ninth in the FBS.\n\nElarbee helped senior Cade Mays conclude his UT career with second-team All-SEC honors and a pair of SEC Offensive Lineman of the Week Awards. Mays was chosen in the sixth round (pick No. 199) of the 2022 NFL Draft by the Carolina Panthers.\n\nUnder Elarbee’s direction from 2018-20, UCF’s offensive line flourished and paved the way for a rushing attack that ranked in the top 25 nationally and top three in the American Athletic Conference all three seasons. He joined UCF as offensive line coach in December 2017 and was promoted to assistant head coach for offense in the summer of 2019, a role he served for two seasons.\n\nElarbee’s first year in Orlando in 2018 was highlighted by one of the best offensive lines in program history, as the Knights repeated their undefeated regular season, won a second straight AAC championship and reached the Fiesta Bowl. UCF set the program rushing record with 3,448 yards on the ground behind a powerful line, which was the eighth-best ground attack in the country.\n\nUCF totaled 522.7 yards of total offense per game, good for fifth nationally. The Knights also excelled in pass protection with just 19 sacks allowed all season, which ranked No. 25 in the FBS. Jordan Johnson, Cole Schneider and Jake Brown all earned AAC first-team all-conference honors, while Wyatt Miller picked up second-team honors. Schneider also received Freshman All-America accolades.\n\nFor his efforts in 2018, Elarbee was named a semifinalist for the Broyles Award, given annually to the top assistant coach in college football. It marked the second time in his career he had been nominated for the award.\n\nIn 2019, UCF again had one of the most productive offenses in the nation. The Knights averaged 540.5 total yards (No. 2 FBS) and 43.4 points per outing (No. 5 FBS). The offensive line helped protect freshman quarterback Dillon Gabriel who played a major role in UCF ranking eighth with its 316.7 passing yards per game. A diversified Knights’ rush attack (No. 19 FBS) saw the top four runners—Otis Anderson, Adrian Killins, Bentavious Thompson and Greg McCrae--combine for 2,488 yards, 27 TDs and an amazing average of 6.46 yards per carry.\n\nBrown in 2019 claimed a second consecutive first-team all-AAC honor, while Schneider won second-team recognition. They’ve paved the way for a UCF running game that in 2018 and 2019 allowed the Knights to top the 200-yard per-game mark in back-to-back seasons for the first time in program history and only the third year overall.\n\nThe 2020 COVID-19 shortened season saw Elarbee’s unit continue its success as UCF racked up 568.1 yards per game of total offense, good for second in the FBS. Redshirt freshman Matthew Lee earned first-team All-AAC honors at center and was tabbed a Freshman All-American by The Athletic.\n\nElarbee was part of a team that averaged 44.3 points per game during its 10 contests, which ranked eighth in the FBS. The Knights posted a 6-4 mark and earned a berth in the Boca Raton Bowl.\n\nElarbee and Heupel’s connection dates back to 2016. Prior to UCF, Elarbee coached the offensive line at Missouri for two seasons from 2016-17. His line at Mizzou helped the Tigers to 2017 FBS of No. 8 in total offense (502.2), No. 5 in sacks allowed (1.0), No. 14 in scoring offense (37.5), No. 14 in passing offense (308.6), No. 18 in first downs (23.4) and No. 16 in red zone offense (90.57).\n\nElarbee took over a Tiger offensive line in 2016 that had no returning starters and molded that group into one of the top lines in the nation. In 2016, Missouri was No. 13 in total offense (500.5), No. 20 in passing offense (295.4), No. 38 in rushing offense (205.1) and No. 48 in scoring offense (31.4) after the Tigers were no higher than No. 113 in those categories the year before. His 2016 unit led the nation in fewest tackles-for-loss allowed (36) and were No. 11 in fewest sacks allowed (14).\n\nFollowing the 2016 season, Elarbee was nominated for the Broyles Award for the first time. He was one of just three position coaches and the only offensive line coach nominated.\n\nElarbee coached successful offensive lines for six seasons at various programs prior to his stint at Mizzou. At Arkansas State from 2014-15, he also served as co-offensive coordinator. The Red Wolves were 8-0 in Sun Belt play in 2015, winning a conference title. Elarbee’s Arkansas State offensive line paved the way for the No. 12 scoring offense (40.0) and the No. 15 rushing offense (231.3) in the nation. He coached two first-team All-Sun Belt performers in his tenure with the Red Wolves.\n\nElarbee coached the Houston offensive line in 2013, helping the Cougars to an 8-5 record and leading one of his linemen to second-team All-AAC honors. He was at Middle Tennessee State in 2012 when the Blue Raiders’ offensive line was No. 2 nationally in sacks allowed and featured an All-Sun Belt performer. Elarbee was also at West Georgia for two seasons, coaching the offensive line in 2010 and serving as offensive coordinator in 2011. At West Georgia, he coached an All-America wide receiver and a Gulf South Conference Freshman of the Year.\n\nIn 2008 and 2009, Elarbee was a graduate assistant coach at Oklahoma State. He was also a graduate assistant with the 2007 LSU team that won the national championship. He coached the offensive line at East Central Community College in Mississippi in 2006. He was on the coaching staff for three years at his alma mater, Middle Tennessee—one year as tight ends coach and two as a graduate assistant.\n\nElarbee, a native of Carrollton, Georgia, played 35 career games for the Blue Raiders from 1998-2002, starting his final 23. He was a two-time all-conference performer and a four-year letterwinner, leading Middle Tennessee to its first Sun Belt Championship in 2001. He earned his undergraduate degree in math education in 2002.\n\nElarbee and his wife, Holly, have one son, Griffin."
