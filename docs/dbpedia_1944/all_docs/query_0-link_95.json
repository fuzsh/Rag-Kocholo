We started the show in 2016 and hoped to deliver news about high school football around South Georgia 52 weeks a year. Thanks to our great partners at Citizens Community Bank, Ray Norton Tire and Auto Center, hundreds of coaches, media figures, and others who agreed to be interviewed and, most of all, thanks to football fans who called in or just listened. We loved every Monday and I am eternally grateful for you making it a part of your Mondays. We’ll be back with Season 20 of the Chick-Fil-A Football Friday Night show in August of 2023.
