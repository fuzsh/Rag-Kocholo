        "text": "Elsa/Getty Images\n\nAlabama's draft bonanza is expected to roll on this week in the NFL's 83rd annual player selections.\n\nThe Crimson Tide should have at least one player (and, more likely, four) selected in the first round. That would set the SEC record of 10 consecutive years producing a first-round draft choice. Alabama is currently tied for the top SEC mark with Florida, which produced at least one first-round player annually from 1983 through 1991. The Tide's streak started in 2009 when the Cincinnati Bengals chose offensive tackle Andre Smith with the sixth selection.\n\nThe draft record for one school producing first-round picks is 14 consecutive years by Miami (Fla.) from 1995 through 2008. Alabama and Florida are next on the list.\n\nAlabama also has 11 players considered solid prospects to be drafted when the NFL teams make their selections in seven rounds Thursday through Saturday, with three or so more players thought to be outside possibilities.\n\nThe most Alabama players who have been picked in one draft is 10 in 1945 and 2017. The SEC record for the most players selected from one school in one draft is 11 by Mississippi State in 1944.\n\nThe Alabama players picked this week will join a lineup of 339 Crimson Tide players who have selected in the regular NFL Draft:\n\nNo. 1 pick\n\nHarry Gilmer, quarterback, Redskins, 1948.\n\nGilmer led the nation in touchdown passes, interceptions (made, not thrown) and punt-return yards and finished fifth twice in the voting for the Heisman Trophy during his career with the Crimson Tide. Alabama's only No. 1 pick went to a team that had all-time great Sammy Baugh at quarterback, and injuries limited Gilmer to one game as a rookie. The former Woodlawn High School star spent eight seasons in the NFL (six with the Redskins and two with the Lions), went to the Pro Bowl twice and was the Lions' head coach for two seasons.\n\nNo. 2 picks\n\nRiley Smith, back, Redskins, 1936; Cornelius Bennett, linebacker, Colts, 1987; Chris Samuels, tackle, Redskins, 2000.\n\nSmith was the second player picked in the first NFL Draft, and, in a way, the first drafted player to reach the pros. Jay Berwanger, the first Heisman Trophy winner (before the award was even called that) and the first player picked in the first draft, decided not to play pro football. Smith played in the Redskins' final season in Boston and two more years in Washington.\n\nStephen B. Morton\n\nNo. 3 picks\n\nMarcell Dareus, defensive tackle, Bills, 2011; Trent Richardson, running back, Browns, 2012.\n\nPicked the year before Richardson, Dareus (pictured) still is playing in the NFL while Richardson hasn't played in a regular-season game since 2014. Now with the Jaguars, Dareus has been a Pro Bowler twice and earned All-Pro recognition in 2014.\n\nAP Photo\n\nNo. 4 picks\n\nLowell Tew, fullback, Redskins, 1948; John Hannah, guard, Patriots, 1973; Jon Hand, defensive end, Colts, 1986; Derrick Thomas, linebacker, Chiefs, 1989; Keith McCants, linebacker, Buccaneers, 1990; Amari Cooper, wide receiver, Raiders, 2015.\n\nHannah and Thomas (pictured) are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, taken out of Alabama at No. 4 16 years apart. Other Hall of Famers that entered the NFL as the No. 4 pick are Chris Doleman, Otto Graham, Joe Greene, Bob Griese, Dan Hampton, Jonathan Ogden, Walter Payton, Gale Sayers and Reggie White.\n\nGetty Images\n\nNo. 5 picks\n\nVaughn \"Cisco\" Mancha, center, Yanks, 1948; E.J. Junior, linebacker, Cardinals, 1981; John Copeland, defensive end, Bengals, 1993.\n\nWhen the Boston Yanks drafted Mancha, that made three Alabama players picked in the first five selections of the 1948 draft.

Current Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Julio Jones (pictured) has five Pro Bowl and two All-Pro selections and has more NFL receiving yards than any other Alabama alumnus. Linebacker Lee Roy Jordan was a five-time Pro Bowler and one-time All-Pro who has more interceptions than any other Crimson Tide alumnus. Jordan played 14 NFL seasons, Krauss played 11, Todd played 10 and Curry played seven. Now with the Cardinals, Smith is preparing for his 10th NFL season.\n\nNo. 7 pick\n\nMark Barron, defensive back, Buccaneers, 2012.\n\nNo. 8 picks\n\nBobby Marlow, back, Giants, 1953; Rolando McClain, linebacker, Raiders, 2010.\n\nIt doesn't seem possible today that the Canadian Football League could sign players away from the NFL, but that's what happened with Marlow and others in the 1950s. The former Troy High School star skipped the NFL to sign with the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders, where he was a two-way star for eight seasons.\n\nNo. 9 picks\n\nButch Avinger, fullback, Steelers, 1951; Wilbur Jackson, running back, 49ers; 1974; Antonio Langham, defensive back, Browns, 1994; Dee Milliner, defensive back, Jets, 2013.\n\nNo. 10 pick\n\nChance Warmack, guard, Titans, 2013.\n\nNo. 11 pick\n\nD.J.

Bart Starr was the MVP in 1966 with the Packers, and Ken Stabler was the MVP in 1974 with the Raiders. Don Hutson won the Joe F. Carr Trophy, the NFL's original MVP Award, in 1941 and 1942 with the Packers.
