        "text": "This article is about the kickoff returner. For the position that handles all kick-returning duties, see Return specialist.\n\nIn American and Canadian football, a kick returner (KR) is the player on special teams who is primarily responsible to catch kickoffs and attempts to return them in the opposite direction. If the ball is kicked into his own endzone, he must assess the situation on the field while the ball is in the air and determine if it would be beneficial to his team for a return. If he decides that it is not, he can make a touchback by kneeling down in the end zone after catching the ball, which gives his team the ball at their own 20-yard line to start the drive.\n\nHe is usually one of the faster players on the team, often a backup wide receiver, defensive back, or running back.\n\nA kick returner might also double as a punt returner as well.\n\nSometimes players who make big plays at the punt or kick returner positions become well known \"return specialist\" players (e.g. Dan Trueman).\n\nKickoff return touchdown percentage[]\n\nThe following table ranks all National Football League kick returners with at least 4 touchdown returns through the 2008 season by touchdown return percentage:\n\nTop 25 career Name TD Returns Yards Average TD % Start End Gale Sayers 6 91 2,781 30.56 6.59% 1965 1971 Devin Hester 6 94 2,141 22.8 6.38% 2006 present Travis Williams 6 102 2,801 27.46 5.88% 1967 1971 Bobby Mitchell 5 102 2,690 26.37 4.90% 1958 1968 Ollie Matson 6 143 3,746 26.20 4.20% 1952 1964 Leon Washington 7 174 4,447 25.56 4.02% 2006 present Jon Vaughn 4 103 2,390 23.20 3.88% 1991 1994 Darrick Vaughn 4 103 2,620 25.44 3.88% 2000 2003 Cecil Turner 4 108 2,616 24.22 3.70% 1968 1973 Justin Miller 5 141 3,745 26.62 3.55% 2005 present Tony Horne 4 143 3,577 25.01 2.80% 1998 2000 Timmy Brown 5 186 4,781 25.70 2.69% 1959 1968 Abe Woodson 5 193 5,538 28.69 2.59% 1958 1966 Josh Cribbs 8 209 5,507 26.35 2.26% 2005 present Andre Coleman 4 193 4,446 23.04 2.07% 1994 1998 Ron Brown 4 199 4,493 22.58 2.01% 1984 1990 Terrence McGee 5 207 5,450 26.32 2.41% 2003 present Tamarick Vanover 4 226 5,422 23.99 1.77% 1995 1999 Mel Gray 6 421 10,250 24.35 1.43% 1986 1997 Dante Hall 6 426 10,136 23.79 1.41% 2000 2008 Michael Bates 5 373 9,110 24.42 1.34% 1993 2003 Allen Rossum 5 506 11,779 23.28 0.99% 1998 present Brian Mitchell 4 607 14,014 23.09 0.66% 1990 2003\n\nSources:\n\nOfficial NFL.com Kick return All-Time Leaders\n\nCurrent Player stats"
