The subcommittee met at 10:05 a.m., in Sheraton Anchorage Hotel, Anchorage, AK, Hon. Ted Stevens presiding. Present: Senator Stevens. OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TED STEVENS Senator Stevens. Thank you all very much. I noticed the bulletin board as we came in said the downhill is canceled for bad weather. Welcome to all the skiers. Today our Committee on Appropriations is convening this special field hearing of the Subcommittee on Labor and Human Services and Education to receive from the Special Olympics the report on the health status and needs of persons with mental retardation. I have here with me Bettilou Taylor, who is the chief clerk of that subcommittee. The chairman is Senator Arlen Specter, and I am conducting the hearing today for him. I understand that many of you have important information to present to us today. Before you do, I want to express my appreciation to the Special Olympics for holding the 2001 Special Olympics World Winter Games here in Anchorage. That was a marvelous beginning last night, and I want to thank my son Ben, the president and CEO of the 2001 Special Olympics, the World Winter Games Organizing Committee, Patty McGuire, who is the president and the board of the Special Olympics World Winter Games here in Anchorage. It has been a long trail to this time, and everything is coming together in a marvelous way. We are here today to receive the report and hear from some witnesses who will help us understand the special health needs of persons with mental retardation. It is worth noting the remarkable history behind this organization. The Special Olympics began in 1968, when Eunice Kennedy Shriver organized the First International Special Olympics, held at Soldiers Field in Chicago. You might say that the flame that lights the Special Olympics was sparked by Ms. Shriver at that time, in her deeply held conviction that individuals with mental retardation are far more capable in sports and physical activities than experts were willing to recognize then. We are honored to have with us today Eunice and Sargent Shriver. Thank you very much for being here. I might say, as some of you know, I was on the other end of that situation. I was raised by my aunt and uncle, who had a daughter with mental retardation, and I saw then how people with those conditions were treated in the days of the thirties and forties. It is a wonderful change that has been brought about today. All of us who have family members, Ms. Shriver, thank you very much for all you have done to bring attention to this condition. Fueled by her vision, the Special Olympics has grown into an international program of year-round sports training and athletic competition for 1 million children and adults with mental retardation. Special Olympics programs now exist in 160 nations. New programs are continuing to be developed around the world. The only thing more remarkable than the Special Olympics itself are the people who participate in it. The pride and dedication of these athletes that they show lifts our hearts, and more than that, these athletes are a source of strength for all of us, because they confirm what we all want to believe, that the human spirit can overcome any diversity and that really is what I think Special Olympics is all about. The report that we are going to receive emphasizes the urgent need to identify scientific knowledge, and develop programs to improve the quality and length of life for persons with mental retardation, most notably, Special Olympic athletes. In 1999, when the Special Olympics commissioned this report, information on the health conditions of people with mental retardation simply did not exist. The report clearly identifies the problems, and makes recommendations to address the health needs of 170 million persons with mental retardation worldwide, and I applaud again the Special Olympics for commissioning this report, but then, I am not surprised that they would have taken on such a task. The Special Olympics has never been afraid to take on great challenges. We have distinguished witnesses today and we will begin with Timothy Shriver and Cindy Bentley. Let me lay down some guidelines, if I may, for this testimony. We normally establish a 5-minute time limit for witnesses, I would hope if you would help us by confining your comments as much as possible. There is a light system here that we sort of follow. It depends on the circumstances, but it will go on when your limit has been reached, and because of the time, and what we have scheduled immediately after this hearing, we will have to end the precedings precisely at 12 noon. I hope that you will keep in mind the people that will be testifying after you. INTRODUCTION OF DR. SHRIVER AND MS. BENTLEY Let me introduce Dr. Timothy Shriver, who you all heard last evening. He is president and chief executive officer of the Special Olympics, Inc. He served as president of the 1995 Special Olympics World Games Organizing Committee. Prior to joining the Special Olympics, Dr. Shriver launched and was supervisor of the New Haven, Connecticut, Public Schools Social Development Project. Dr. Shriver earned his undergraduate degree at Yale, a master's degree from Catholic University, and holds a doctorate in education from the University of Connecticut. Cindy Bentley is a Special Olympics athlete from Wisconsin, and member of the Sargent Shriver Global Messengers Class of 2000-2001. Ms. Bentley attended her first Special Olympics International Games in 1968 in Chicago, and has competed in both the 1995 and 1999 World Summer Games. She won medals in basketball, track, speed skating, volley ball, and tennis. I would like to proceed with your testimony now. I understand we do have a scheduled list of witnesses. If anyone really feels that they should be heard, please contact Bettilou or a member of our staff. Thank you very much. Tim. Dr. Shriver. I think Cindy is going to start. Senator Stevens. Okay, Cindy.

What is Special Olympics? Special Olympics is an international program of year-round sports training and athletic competition for more than one million children and adults with mental retardation. The Special Olympics oath is: Let me win. But if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt. Our leaders are: Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Founder and Honorary Chairman; Sargent Shriver, Chairman of the Board; and Timothy P. Shriver, Ph.D., President and CEO. Our mission is to provide year-round sports training and athletic competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children and adults with mental retardation by giving them continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, demonstrate courage, experience joy, and participate in a sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, other Special Olympics athletes and the community. Our goal is for all persons with mental retardation to have the chance to become useful and productive citizens who are accepted and respected in their communities. The benefits of participation in Special Olympics for people with mental retardation include improved physical fitness and motor skills, greater self-confidence, a more positive self-image, friendships, and increased family support. Special Olympics athletes carry these benefits with them into their daily lives at home, in the classroom, on the job, and in the community. Families who participate become stronger as they learn a greater appreciation of their athlete's talents. Community volunteers find out what good friends the athletes can be. And everyone learns more about the capabilities of people with mental retardation. The Spirit of Special Olympics--skill, courage, sharing, and joy-- transcends boundaries of geography, nationality, political philosophy, gender, age, race, or religion. Special Olympics began in 1968 when Eunice Kennedy Shriver organized the First International Special Olympics Games at Soldier Field, Chicago, Illinois, USA. The concept was born in the early 1960s when Mrs. Shriver started a day camp for people with mental retardation. She saw that individuals with mental retardation were far more capable in sports and physical activities than many experts thought. Since 1968, millions of children and adults with mental retardation have participated in Special Olympics. Around the world there are accredited Special Olympics Programs in more than 160 countries. Special Olympics Programs are continually being developed around the world. In the United States Special Olympics Programs are established in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. About 25,000 communities in the United States have Special Olympics Programs. To be eligible to participate in Special Olympics, an athlete must be at least eight years old and identified by an agency or professional as having one of the following conditions: mental retardation, cognitive delays as measured by formal assessment, or significant learning or vocational problems due to cognitive delay that require, or have required, specially-designed instruction. The Special Olympics Unified Sports TM program brings together athletes with and without mental retardation of similar age and ability to train and compete on the same teams. Founded in 1987, Special Olympics Unified Sports fosters the integration of persons with mental retardation into school and community sports programs. Special Olympics provides year-round training and competition in 25 official sports. Special Olympics has developed and tested training programs that are outlined in a Sports Skills Guide for each sport. More than 140,000 qualified coaches train Special Olympics athletes. By assigning athletes to divisions determined by their ages and ability levels, Special Olympics gives every athlete a reasonable chance to win. Athletes from all divisions may advance to State, National, and World Games. For athletes with profound disabilities Special Olympics created its Motor Activities Training Program (MATP), developed by physical educators, physical therapists, and recreation therapists. MATP emphasizes training and participation rather than competition. MATP is part of the Special Olympics commitment to offer sports training to all individuals with mental retardation. Special Olympics competitions are patterned after the Olympic Games. More than 20,000 Games, meets, and tournaments in both summer and winter sports are held worldwide each year. World Games for selected representatives of all Programs are held every two years, alternating between summer and winter. More than 100,000 volunteers organize and run local Special Olympics programs, serving as coaches, Games officials, drivers, and in many other capacities. Anyone can learn how to participate through the many training programs Special Olympics offers for coaches, officials, and volunteers. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., Special Olympics guides local, area, state, and national programs around the world. A volunteer board of directors determines international policies and is comprised of business and sport leaders, professional athletes, educators, and experts in mental retardation from around the world. Giving cooperation and support to Special Olympics are the national governing bodies and/or international sports federations of each sport played in Special Olympics. Major sports organizations and a host of world leaders also support Special Olympics and its goals. Special Olympics is the only organization authorized by the International Olympic Committee to use ``Olympics'' worldwide.

Thank you very much, Cindy, and we will take that back to the committee, and it will be printed in our hearing today. Ms. Bentley. Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY SHRIVER, Ph.D., PRESIDENT AND CEO, SPECIAL OLYMPICS, INC. Dr. Shriver. Mr. Chairman, Cindy Bentley, Global Messengers, Surgeon General Satcher, members of the Board of Special Olympics, distinguished guests and athletes, Mr. Chairman, let me begin by repeating what Cindy Bentley has just said, which is, we are enormously grateful to you for convening this hearing, for your leadership of these Games, for coming all the way to Athens with your colleagues from the U.S. Senate to celebrate the lighting of the Flame of Hope. It is our understanding that this is the first hearing ever convened by a committee of the U.S. Senate exclusively devoted to health issues confronting people with mental disability, and never before in the history of the Republic has a Senate hearing been convened under any circumstances with the exclusive mission of focusing on the needs of this population, a population that is, as we all know, so deserving of an opportunity. This would not have happened, of course, without your leadership, so on this historic occasion, from all of us at Special Olympics, let me again thank you. The report you have just received, Mr. Chairman, has a long history and many stories associated with it. For me personally, it began at the 1995 Special Olympics World Games. At those Games, I was a part of the staff and volunteers who helped to create a global celebration, just as we are holding here this week. At those Games, we created this first health clinic, eye clinic, oral health clinic, and it was located in the middle of our Olympic Village. I visited the clinics in the early days to talk to the doctors and others. Everybody was having a good time. When the week ended, we received the data that had been collected as several thousand athletes from those world Games had been screened by medical volunteers, led by Dr. Steve Perlman and Dr. Paul Berman, and what we found was stunning. The data is contained in this report, Mr. Chairman, but I would like to highlight a few findings: almost 30 percent of the athletes screened in those clinics had visual problems or could not see, despite having been treated previoulsy by a doctor. Almost 20 percent were in severe pain. These are athletes that had been screened by doctors, had been prepared to come to the Games, yet notwithstanding that they were walking around with acute pain so severe that it was interfering with their daily lives. Almost 15 percent of the athletes screened on this occasion had to be referred immediately to the emergency room for care of serious health conditions either related to their oral health care or to their eyes. What we found as we started to analyze this data, Mr. Chairman, were at least three critical problems. One, the health care professionals that had been trained by medical institutions had chronic gaps in their training, with respect to treating people with mental retardation. We saw severe training issues in the way in which doctors and other health care professionals were being educated. We saw medical coverage issues. Many of these athletes had medical insurance of one form or another, but it was not covering their dental care or other specialized medical conditions. So many of our athletes, even in wealthy communities, did not have access to anywhere near resembling adequate care. But perhaps more serious than either of those two problems was the fact that we uncovered what can only be described as discrimination. We found, in summary, that the health care system in the United States and to a large extent, as well as we could understand it, the health care systems around the world, were practicing active discrimination against people with mental disabilities for no other reason than because they had a disability that made the health care professional uncomfortable. This was brought home to me as I tried to struggle with this issue not as a doctor, but as a volunteer in Special Olympics, and then as a staff member, by Dr. Paul Berman. He took me aside and said: ``you know, Tim, it is like this: Many of these athletes do see a doctor, but they get what we call a quick and dirty. ``That means, after they are brought in, we take the allotted time, we fit them with a pair of glasses or provide some other medical solution. We do not really care because they will not drive a car, they will not operate heavy machinery, they do not fill out legal challenges, and they do not complain, so the doctors are content to give them a quick and dirty. I am not proud of my profession, Tim, but that is the way it is.'' That trajectory of information, Mr. Chairman, led us to create this report that we presented to you today. Special Olympics, as you know, has spent 30 years promoting the health condition of people with mental retardation in positive ways through sports training and competition. But I have come to the conclusion that we cannot win the battle for improved health care for people with mental retardation if doctors and the medical profession are the enemy. We cannot provide sports training, we cannot provide competitive opportunities, we cannot promote social and political acceptance if the medical profession is fighting against us, and I am sorry to say, Mr. Chairman, that this report indicates that it is. What is next? Very simply, we could commit to serving over 100,000 athletes in our health care clinics annually. We could improve the health status of people with mental retardation by increasing our knowledge about their health conditions. Surgeon General Satcher is here today, and we are going to ask him formally to help us with data-collection. If there is one conclusion of this report, it is that the health data does not exist for people with mental retardation because no one has taken the time to gather it, because no one has cared. We need data. We need to change the reimbursement laws in this country so that people in this country, in the wealthiest country in the world, can at least have access to adequate care. We need to create, or be creative about new ways to improve health care for people with mental retardation. IEPs have been required for people with mental disability in this country in the education system. Why not include a health status component to the IEP so that school-aged children have at least some access to quality health care? Mr. Chairman, I know my time is limited. We are here on behalf of a population that has no high-paid lobbyists in Washington, that has no well-heeled perks to offer to the Members of Congress or the U.S. Senate, or to other senior policy leaders. We are here on behalf of the humblest people on the planet, and probably the population with the least amount of political influence of any, and yet I hope that we will all commit here today to improve their access to quality health care. PREPARED STATEMENT As we come together in celebration at these World Games, we see athletes like Laura Zimmerman who is here today with 16 members of her family, to watch her and take family pride in her downhill skiing. Why is that happening? Why is Laura getting such a warm welcome? Why is she excelling at sports? For one simple reason, Laura was given a chance. If there is one message, Mr. Chairman, it is that we need your voice, and we need the voice of your colleagues, to make it possible for people with mental disability to have a reasonable chance at a healthy life. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Timothy Shriver Mr. Chairman, distinguished guests, Special Olympics athletes and families, let me begin be saying how proud and honored all of us in Special Olympics are to be a part of this historic hearing. To my knowledge, never before has the Appropriations Committee of the United States Senate convened a hearing on issues related to people with mental retardation--in fact, I understand that this is the first hearing held by any Senate Committee completely dedicated to the needs of people with mental retardation. And for all of us in Special Olympics, this moment represents a first as well. Until today, we have never been offered the chance to speak directly to the leadership of the United States Senate about the hopes and needs and abilities of our athletes. Senator Stevens, thank you. Thank you for your presence here today, for your presence at our Torch Lighting Ceremony in Athens two weeks ago, for your Honorary Chairmanship of these Games and for your willingness to lead on behalf of our athletes. Mr. Chairman, six years ago, the Special Olympics World Summer Games were held in my home state of Connecticut. I had the honor or working as part of a statewide team of over 40,000 volunteers and staff members to host the event. At those Games, all the traditional elements of Special Olympics were present: the pomp and ceremony, the cultures of the world on display in breathtaking traditional costumes and rituals, festivities and celebrations, inspiring competition, and moments of transformative family joy. Those Games were also the first time that Special Olympics hosted a Healthy Athletes screening clinic to promote oral and vision health. Led by Drs. Steve Perlman and Paul Berman, teams of volunteer dentists and optometrists traveled from throughout the country to New Haven to provide screening services and basic health instruction to athletes. I toured the Healthy Athletes Center at the beginning of the Games, and saw athletes receiving instruction in oral hygiene. I saw sophisticated instruments measuring vision and talked with volunteers from the medical community who were having a great time. And then at the end of the week, I heard the results of what the medical professionals had seen and I was disgusted and shocked. Specifically, 85 percent of the athletes screened had refractive errors in their vision; 28 percent suffered from astigmatism, 25 percent had strabismus; 29 percent had general untreated visual problems and 23 percent of Special Olympics screened athletes failed a test for visual acuity, which is simply the ability to see clearly. Further, 27 percent of the athletes screened had not had an eye exam within three years. On the oral health front, 68.1 percent of the athletes screened exhibited gingivitis and one in three athletes had active untreated dental decay. More than 20 percent reported pain in the oral cavity. Perhaps, most frightening, almost 15 percent of the Special Olympics athletes who chanced into the Healthy Athletes clinic had to be referred to the Emergency Room due to untreated acute pain or disease. In short, World Games athletes who were otherwise thought to be fine had suffered from such high levels of neglect that when exposed to a health professional, they were found to be sick and in some cases VERY sick. I couldn't believe it. In the days that followed, I learned more as I tried to find out how these athletes could be suffering so. Where were their doctors? Why had they not received attention? Who was negligent? What was going on? And as I struggled to understand health insurance issues, medical training issues, epidemiology issues, pharmaceutical issues and more, I heard an explanation that I will always remember. Dr. Paul Berman took me aside and explained. ``Tim, in most cases doctors don't want to treat these patients. They either don't know how or they don't see the money. But even when they do, it's not real care. It's a `quick and dirty.' Give a quick look, give them some glasses and send them on their way. They're not driving or operating heavy machinery. They're not reading or doing legal work. What difference does it make whether or not they see clearly? Get them in and get them out. That's the attitude, Tim. I'm not proud of my profession, but that's the way it is.'' ``Quick and Dirty.'' I'll never forget those words. In the best case scenario, many people with mental retardation get a ``quick and dirty.'' As I struggled to comprehend this reality, I began to understand that the health care problems I was discovering were far bigger than Special Olympics but nonetheless part of the problem we were facing in promoting sports training and competition around the world. Quite simply, I realized that children and adults with mental retardation simply could not become athletes if they were sick, especially if they were sick because of neglect and indifference! Over the last few years, Mr. Chairman, Special Olympics has focused new energy on this issue because we believe that health is related integrally to sport. For years, we have known about the great benefits of participation in Special Olympics: increased skills, transformations in self-confidence and self-esteem, new family pride, changes in community attitudes and more. In general, we are convinced that Special Olympics helps athletes become healthier! But we can't win the struggle for equitable health care if the medical system is fighting against us! We can't win if the standard is ``down and dirty.'' Doctors and health care professionals are enemies we shouldn't have! In the year 2001, no American should be given a ``down and dirty,'' especially if the reason is blatant and unconscionable discrimination. That simply should not be. The report we offer to you and to your colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee, provides galling evidence in literature from around the world that what we have seen in Special Olympics is no aberration. What it says is actually, a painful reminder of what we thought was a part of the past. We thought the days of isolation and discrimination were over. We thought that all the changes in institutions, in schools, in legal protections, and in housing had changed the situation for people with mental retardation across the board. But now we come face to face with the realization that the health care system has not been part of these changes in anything resembling an acceptable way. In short, Mr. Chairman, the health care system in this country is full of negligence, indifference and blatant discrimination. And around the world, from what we can tell, the situation is not much better. For example, our report states that in Western Europe and the United States, life expectancy is 74 to 76.5 years. Yet, depending on the severity of their condition, people with mental retardation have a life expectancy of only 53.5 to 66.1 years. The report finds that 39 percent of psychiatrists would prefer not to treat patients who have mental retardation. It finds that as few 30 percent of individuals with mental retardation receive care from medical specialists despite the fact that a full 92 percent had medical needs that required specialty care. This report finds studies on the prevalence of mental retardation and other health conditions are scarce; that barriers to care are numerous and that private and public reimbursement policies are not only inadequate, but also discriminatory. The key question, Mr. Chairman, is what is next? What can be done? First, Special Olympic must and will expand our Healthy Athletes program. For many athletes, the free screening clinics they attend at Special Olympics events is the only medical attention they will receive in the course of a year. When we started our work in the health field, we had no special plan for action. In 1995, we held six oral health clinics, and just one focusing on visual health. Today, thanks to funding from a range of corporate sponsors and thanks to a strong partnership with The Lions Club Foundation, the Healthy Athletes program has taken off. This year, we will host 100 clinics; we will screen and advise 26,800 athletes; we will train nearly 5,000 health care professionals. And we will build the foundation to significantly expand all of these numbers in the years ahead. One might ask if this is a serious effort and whether or not an organization like Special Olympics can really make a difference in the health status of this population. The answer depends on what one means when one says ``health.'' If health means only the drugs and operating rooms and the emergency rooms, then Special Olympics cannot contribute. But if health means knowledge about how to take care of oneself, access to the skills and values of prevention, relationships with health professionals that can guide decision making in day-to-day life, and referrals to more significant care when and if it is needed, then Mr. Chairman, Special Olympics can and will be on the cutting edge. Our commitment is clear. We will continue to focus on sports training and competition and it will remain our greatest contribution to enhancing the health of people with mental retardation around the world. But we will also build a strong Healthy Athletes program and we will do everything we can to demand the attention of health professionals and policy makers alike so that they end the pattern of exclusion, indifference and failure. But of course, we cannot do it alone, Mr. Chairman and today, I am asking for your support. Please understand that I ask not for myself of even for the movement that I represent. I ask on behalf of roughly seven million Americans and their families who still today, have almost no voice in the public debates of our time. Mr. Chairman, people with mental retardation have no well-heeled lobbyists in Washington; they offer no perks to decision-makers in the halls of power; their economic influence is small; their political influence is almost non existent. But as you know so well, Mr. Chairman, people with mental retardation in this country have no less right to be treated fairly than anyone else! If we could find the funds, Special Olympics could screen 175,000 U.S. athletes every year for vision and oral health, hearing, dermatology and orthopedics. And even this number is less than half of the number of athletes who compete at Special Olympics events in the U.S. each year. We could teach these athletes about health promotion, nutrition and wellness. We could improve the quality of life and perhaps the life expectancy for 175,000 athletes. I think we should set a goal of doing just that and that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service should assist us in this mission. Second, all public and private programs, initiatives and reports that address the health needs of the general public should explicitly examine the unique needs of persons with mental retardation. Third, specific health objectives for persons with mental retardation should be established by the U.S. government, consistent with the overall goals of Healthy People 2010--namely, ``to increase quality life years and to reduce the gaps in health status.'' Public schools are provided with a great opportunity to improve the health of school-aged individuals with mental retardation. By law, public schools are required to provide an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for every child with mental retardation. As part of each IEP, the health needs of children with mental retardation should be assessed and appropriate services accessed. Finally, the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as the Association of State Attorneys General, should evaluate whether the provisions of publicly funded and private health programs are providing equal or equitable protection to persons with disabilities, including those with mental retardation. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the one million athletes we serve we look to you for leadership. Your voice is one of the most powerful in all the Congress. Please speak out on the health needs of people with mental retardation. Please fund all of the programs that will help ameliorate the health deficits of this population. We must demand training programs for doctors and other care providers, fund data collection initiatives so that we can better understand prevalence and needs issues, and please, please fund health prevention programs so that people with mental retardation are not dying 10-20 years earlier than the rest of the American population. I urge everyone to leave this hearing room and visit the Special Olympics Healthy Athlete Clinic at the Eagan Center. Watch an athlete smile as he sees his parents and coach for the first time because he was given a pair of glasses with the right prescription. I promise that you won't see any ``down and dirty'' treatment at our clinic. In closing, let me remind policy makers around the world who may read this report, that here in Alaska, we are celebrating the giftedness of people with mental retardation. We will see their gifts as athletes, and we will see their gifts as human beings. We will see down hill skiers, speed skaters, and floor hockey champions. We will see the Zimmerman family--all 16 members of them--who have come here to cheer for Laura Zimmerman who is their sister, daughter, niece, cousin and pride and joy. All of this celebration happens because these athletes were given a chance and when the chance came, oh how they seized the moment! The lesson here is just that simple: give them a chance. All around the world, people with mental retardation are denied the simplest chance to belong. And yet, they bring gifts as unique as those of any human being. And all they ask is if someone will give them a chance. May we not leave here without dedicating ourselves to answering, YES! Thank you. Senator Stevens. Thank you very much, Dr. Shriver. I am sorry to tell you that I must conform to the rules of the Senate being a member of the Rules Committee, too. These rules forbid applause at Senate hearings. Dr. Shriver. Now that I am done, that is okay. Senator Stevens. I have not had a chance to read the report, of course. What recommendations do you make? Do the people here know what recommendations you have made in this report, beyond what you have just summarized? Dr. Shriver. The report spells out our recommendations with some specificity. Mr. Chairman, I think there really are at least three core recommendations. One is, that data collection has to be improved. The Surgeon General's Office, the Centers for Disease Control, need to create dedicated attention to gathering information about the health status and needs of this population. It is not gathered now, and without data, as you know, it is very difficult to make a case on how important it is for change in the health care system. Second, I am not an expert on medical care and medical insurance, but the gaps in reimbursement, the gaps in insurance are unconscionable. The fact that we have adults in this population who cannot, unless they save their welfare checks or title 19 reimbursements, unless they save that money, cannot see a dentist, is to me just shocking. I have mentioned this to several people and they shrug their shoulders, senior policy leaders--it is too expensive, we cannot get to it--so people are basically making up their minds to deny this population access to care. That has just got to change. I think, third, we have to look at the training issues. Too many doctors, 79 percent--one of the pieces of data here, 79 percent of psychiatrists claim that they have no training in the care of people with mental disability. This is the mental health care profession. Medical schools around the world need to change the curriculum, and we need leadership from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Surgeon General, and other leaders in the medical field to demand that the training of medical professionals include attention to the special needs of this population. Additional recommendations are spelled out in this report, Mr. Chairman. We on our part can contribute to public health through our healthy athletes programs. We are not a health care organization, but we see other organizations providing medical services through vans in communities and cancer screenings and dermatological screenings, these kinds of things, in nontraditional ways. With support from organizations like the Lion's Club and potentially from Government sources, we could screen and offer health screening services to 100,000 or 200,000 athletes a year. Currently we are not able to do that. We now serve just over 20,000 in our most ambitious projections. We could serve significantly more through the Special Olympics Athletes Program, if we had help. Senator Stevens. Well now, you deal, or Special Olympics deals with the fittest of the fit in this population. Dr. Shriver. That is right. Senator Stevens. What about the balance of this population? Dr. Shriver. Well, that is the scandal. All the data you have here is from the fittest of the fit. We are trying to do outreach in Native communities and urban populations, and hard- to-reach rural populations, to bring more people into a fitness and sports movement, but until we focus more attention to these needs, we will continue to see obesity, we will continue to see tobacco use, we will see all the neglect issues, that come as a result of people living in settings where no one has seemed to care, and where the medical profession is not an active ally in promoting a healthy lifestyle. Senator Stevens. There have been no studies of the impact of diet or substance abuse on people with mental retardation? Dr. Shriver. We have some controlled studies of tobacco use in institutionalized settings, but no community-based or population studies that we are aware of document these issues across the board. I am sure the Surgeon General can speak to these issues much better than I can, but we were not able to find any. Senator Stevens. We will hear from Dr. Satcher on our next panel, so thank you very much. Thank you, Cindy. Ms. Bentley. You are welcome. INTRODUCTION OF DR. SATCHER AND MS. SWENSON Senator Stevens. We appreciate it very much. Dr. Satcher, the Surgeon General of the United States, accompanied by Sue Swenson, Commissioner of the Administration for Developmental Disabilities. Thank you. For the audience, Dr. David Satcher is the 16th Surgeon General of the United States. He is only the second person in history to simultaneously serve as the Surgeon General and as the Assistant Secretary for Health. Before becoming Surgeon General, Dr. Satcher was the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. He was also the president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. Dr. Satcher received his Bachelor of Science degree from Morehouse College and his M.D. and Ph.D. from Case-Western Reserve University. Also, Ms. Swenson is introduced here. I will do it right now. Sue Swenson is the Commissioner of the Administration for Developmental Disabilities at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. She served on the Senate Labor Subcommittee on Disabilities as a Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. Foundation Fellow, and holds an M.B.A. from the University of Minnesota, as well as an M.A. and a B.A. from the University of Chicago, and is the mother of three sons. We welcome you, too. Dr. Satcher, please proceed. STATEMENT OF DAVID SATCHER, M.D., U.S. SURGEON GENERAL, U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Dr. Satcher. Thank you, Senator Stevens. I am delighted to be able to join you and members of the Special Olympic Committee, Mrs. Shriver and members of the family and all these outstanding athletes. Senator Stevens. Pardon me, doctor. Can you all hear back there? Pull it right up. Dr. Satcher. I will start over. I am very pleased to be here to join you in this very important hearing, and to join all of those who have worked so hard to make the Special Olympics possible, and these outstanding athletes. As you know, Senator Stevens, I have submitted testimony, so I will just summarize briefly what I have said and respond to any questions or comments. Senator Stevens. All of the statements submitted will be printed in the record, and we are glad to have your additional comments. Dr. Satcher. I do want to say that in addition to my testimony I have had the opportunity to spend the last 3 days here in Anchorage and on Friday, of course, went out to Emmonak to really see some of our programs in the rural areas of Alaska, and that has been quite eye-opening. On Saturday I also had an opportunity to have lunch with Tim and some of the mothers of children with mental retardation, and to hear their concerns about medical care in this area, and that also has been very helpful. I had a chance along with Dr. Steve Corbin and others to visit the health screening units on Saturday afternoon, including visual and oral screening, but also for the first time, health promotion. So I have learned a lot since I have been here. I do not come as an expert in this area, but I do come as one who is very concerned about the quality of health and health care that exists in our country for people with mental retardation, and I hope that I can use my position as Surgeon General to make a difference. I must say, Mr. Chairman, as you know, as Surgeon General I have produced at least three reports that have been different in terms of their attention to areas of neglect. I released the first ever Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health in December 1999. That report dealt extensively with the problems of and made major recommendations with regard to mental health in our country. The shortcoming of it, of course, was that we did not have quality studies on mental health issues related to people with mental retardation. By the same token, we released the first- ever report on oral health, which included a major section dealing with disabilities and responding to the needs of persons with disabilities. But again, there was no examination of community-based population studies for persons with mental retardation. So even though the report dealt with disabilities, it did not target mental retardation. By the same token, for the first time, Healthy People 2010 has a full chapter dealing with disabilities, and several objectives that we hope to achieve by the year 2010. Even though we deal with disabilities, however, we did not have the studies to specifically target mental retardation. So we are looking for ways to be more inclusive over the next few years. So these are the efforts that we have made in the short time we have had. I do want to agree with Dr. Shriver, or Tim, in saying that I think there is a major problem in terms of medical care, and I think it does start with training and sensitivity to the issue of the mentally retarded. We hear a lot from parents and persons with mental retardation, themselves, about their experience in the health care system. I think we can do better than that, and I think we will do better than that. I also agree that there are major systems problems in terms of access to care. In our report on oral health, we pointed out the major problem with medicaid reimbursement for dental health care, and that especially affects persons with disabilities. Many dentists still complain that they virtually have to take money out of their pocket in order to take care of persons, and yet, as you know, the JL report pointed out the shortcomings in medicaid. So there are some major systems problems in terms of physicians and other providers being able to provide the care that is needed. We have to look at the system--we have to look at the training. I want to close with what I consider to be, I guess you would call them recommendations. They are primarily our view of the way things should be and the way things can be in this area for the future. The first area is education and awareness. We believe that there is a great need for not just the better education of health professionals, but people in general regarding public awareness about persons with mental retardation and their great potential. I think the Special Olympics has contributed significantly to that effort. But when we try to deal with health problems, if the general population is not aware, just as we said in the mental health report, then a stigma surrounds the problem and that certainly interferes with the provision of care. So we believe that public awareness and better education for professionals is an essential first step in addressing the health needs of persons with mental retardation. Second, we need population-based surveillance programs. Public health begins and ends with surveillance. Screening programs are great, and I think the screening programs here have been contributing a lot, but it is not population-based surveillance that would really answer the kind of question that you raised about people in the broad population. So hopefully, we can develop those kinds of surveillance programs. There are 10 leading health indicators in Healthy People 2010, which I hope no one will miss. Five of those are lifestyle, physical activity, overweight and obesity, reducing tobacco use, substance abuse, and responsible sexual behavior. For the next 10 years we are going to really be pushing the American people to reach the objectives in those areas. I believe that there are many people with mental retardation who would benefit tremendously from an increased focus on health promotion and disease prevention in our country. The second five leading indicators are health systems indicators, starting with access. Again, there are major access problems in this population. I believe that focusing on measurable objectives, in terms of improving access to care, will help persons with mental retardation. Other leading indicators are mental health, environmental quality, injury and violence prevention, and immunization. So for the first time in these three decades that we have been doing healthy people, we now have 10 leading health indicators that we can follow just as we follow leading economic indicators--not as often--but hopefully at least yearly. And we believe that if we target these leading health indicators to persons with mental retardation, we can get all of our systems in place with measurable outcomes in these areas. I hope to be a part of that. I certainly believe that the Office of the Surgeon General will be. PREPARED STATEMENT And I, like the Special Olympics player, pledge that we really hope to win in this endeavor. But if we cannot win, we should be very brave in our attempt. I believe that we can win, and we hope to win. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of David Satcher Senator Stevens and Members of the Committee: I am Dr. David Satcher, U.S. Surgeon General. I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the need to promote health for people with mental retardation and to go over the findings of a privately funded literature review by Special Olympics, Inc. and Yale University pertaining to the health needs of people with mental retardation. Thank you for this opportunity. I appreciate the work of the Special Olympics not only for promoting physical activity among individuals with mental retardation but also for providing opportunities for them to develop their talent and performance and for highlighting their unmet health care needs. THE DATA ON PERSONS WITH MENTAL RETARDATION AND THE LIMITATIONS OF THAT DATA In the United States, we estimate that the prevalence of mental retardation ranges from 2 to 7.5 million people. Using the 1994 National Health Interview (NHIS) Disability Supplement, Phase I, to identify people with mental retardation or developmental disabilities, researchers estimated mental retardation prevalence of 3.4 percent for the 0-5 age group, 2.5 percent for the 6-18 age group, and .5 percent for those 19 years of age and older. Worldwide, there are 170 million people with mental retardation, according to World Health Organization estimates. That's nearly 3 percent of the global population. In the last 40 years, we have witnessed dramatic change in sentiments regarding those with mental retardation. Public policy and practice with regard to the education and treatment of individuals with cognitive limitations began to change in the 1960s and 1970s. Clinical and administrative practices began to reflect empirical findings that learning and improvements in adaptive behavior were enhanced by treatment in less restrictive community-based residential, training, and work environments as opposed to large, overcrowded, and understaffed institutions. Since the late 1980's the nation's public health system has formally recognized the health needs of people with disabilities and consequently, has developed programs to address their specific health concerns, and has set goals to eliminate health disparities relative to people without disabilities. Today, mental retardation is diagnosed using three generally accepted criteria: an IQ that is below 70-75; significant limitations existing in two or more adaptive skills areas, such as communications, self-care, functional academics, and home living; and presence of the condition before age 18. Other skills criteria include community use, self-direction, health and safety, leisure and work. Our ability to fully assess the prevalence of mental retardation in the United States is limited for several reasons: --We lack a surveillance system that targets the health status and needs of people with mental retardation. Existing survey-based public health surveillance in the United States is inadequate for identifying people with mild cognitive limitations. --When we launched Healthy People 2010 last year, the nation's health goals and objectives for this decade, it marked the first time we had ever included a full chapter on disabilities. However, due to the limitations in data, we were not able to specifically address the health status, needs and access issues confronting millions of Americans with mental retardation. --We published the landmark Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health in December 1999. While it offers a comprehensive view of mental health in the United States based on the best available science and an extensive discussion of mental disorders and problems with stigma and access, it still lacks specific information on persons with mental retardation because of the shortfalls in data. --Similarly, the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health provided a sweeping discussion of the oral health needs in this country with a special focus on oral health needs of persons with disabilities; nevertheless, the discussion of the unique needs of persons with mental retardation was limited due to lack of data. --The Causes/Risk Factors for Mental Retardation Mental retardation can be caused by any condition that impairs development of the brain before birth, during birth or in the childhood years. Many causes are associated with mental retardation. It is important to accurately and consistently define mental retardation because of its impact on the prevalence. The most widely used definition comes from the American Association for Mental Retardation (AAMR), which defines mental retardation as the onset of significant limitations in both general intellectual and adaptive functioning during the developmental period, that is, 18 years and under. Although not formally a part of the definition of mental retardation, the APA includes mental retardation in the DSM-IV, classifying it as a mental disorder. Despite the importance of consistency, mental retardation is not always defined the same way across research studies or service agencies, even within the same state. Some definitions rely solely on IQ scores, others only use adaptive behaviors, while others use a combination of both. Many studies are based on broad categorizations of severity, using labels such as mild, moderate, severe and profound, assigning a corresponding IQ range to each term (mild = 50-55 to 70, moderate = 34-40 to 50-55, severe = 20-25 to 35-40 and profound <20- 25.) The most well-documented approach involves two classifications: cultural/familial and biologic/organic, based on the prevalence or absence of a known organic etiology. Cultural/familial refers to individuals with IQs of 50-70, who do not have any identifiable physiological deficit. They cognitively develop at a slower rate and do not reach the same cognitive levels as the general population. Those in the organic group have an identifiable physiological deficit and typically have IQs lower than 50, although sometimes individuals with higher IQs in the 50-70 range can be included in this group. It would also include genetic causes such as Down Syndrome. THE RANGE OF HEALTH PROBLEMS/DISEASES AND CONDITIONS AFFECTING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL RETARDATION The health issues for individuals with mental retardation are similar to the health issues for many people with disabling conditions, namely, physical activity, nutrition, access to health care, clinical preventive services, oral health, mental health, and family care giving. While population based data are unavailable, research using samples of convenience have demonstrated that people with mental retardation are at increased risk for obesity, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, seizures, mental illness and behavior disorders, hearing and vision problems, and poor conditioning and fitness. Cohort and group effects, such as those related to institutional experience and residential status, are generally poorly controlled. In 1991, heart disease was the leading cause of death for people with severe mental retardation. Overweight and obesity levels in this country have reached epidemic proportions. However, people with mental retardation have been reported to be at a much higher risk for obesity than their peers without retardation. In some studies, up to 46 percent of individuals with mild mental retardation were obese. There are genetic causes of mental retardation that are associated with obesity, such as Down Syndrome and Prader-Willi Syndrome. The type of living arrangement was strongly linked to obesity. Higher percentages of obesity were noted among people in community residential environments. Especially troubling was the finding that 55.3 percent of individuals with mild cognitive limitations residing with their natural families were found to be obese. These studies also revealed a strong link between obesity and coronary heart disease, cancer, social stigma, and discrimination. Significantly lower bone mineral density has been reported for a group of people with moderate to mild mental retardation with a mean age of 35 years when compared with age-matched controls. THE UNIQUE IMPACT OF HEALTH PROBLEMS/DISEASES AND CONDITIONS AFFECTING PEOPLE WITH MENTAL RETARDATION People with mental retardation face unique health problems resulting in lower life expectancies and lower quality of life. Life expectancy of people with mental retardation has increased to the extent that younger adults with mental retardation are expected to demonstrate little disparity in longevity; however, for older adults, disparities continue to exist. Specific subpopulations, people with Down syndrome for example, are at increased risk for premature mortality. A number of studies demonstrate that adults with mental retardation compare unfavorably with their peers without mental retardation in terms of activity, fitness levels, and obesity, resulting in increased risk for disease and poor quality of life, reduced cardiovascular fitness, higher cholesterol levels, reduced muscular strength and endurance, and cardiovascular disease. As more people with mild cognitive limitations are living in unsupervised environments or are under the occasional care of family members, service coordinators, friends, or other benefactors, there is little opportunity for organized fitness activities specifically targeted at this population. PEOPLE WITH MENTAL RETARDATION SUFFER DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM LACK OF ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE HEALTH CARE Health promotion, disease prevention, early detection and universal access to care are the cornerstones of a balanced community health system. Yet, in each of these areas, individuals with mental retardation face barriers. Research has demonstrated that many primary care providers are unprepared or otherwise are reluctant to provide routine and emergency medical and dental care to people with mental retardation. Many providers refuse to serve, or limit the number of people served under the Medicaid program, a source of coverage for many people with mental retardation. Dental care for adults is a particularly difficult matter in that, by and large, Medicaid does not cover adult dental care. For example, many health professionals have little exposure to individuals with mental retardation and, as a result, are sometimes uncomfortable treating them. That is tragic, considering that people with mental retardation have been reported to be at higher risk for behavioral and emotional difficulties than the general population, with prevalence ranging from 20-40 percent. In addition, the medical and dental care of those individuals in community-based residences is no longer obtained from a centralized institutional staff but from primary care providers in the community. Increases in the use of community-based primary health care has not been without difficulty and the decentralization of services has brought with it the need for increased personal responsibility in terms of self-advocacy, self-determination and, in many cases, increased care giving responsibilities by families, often life-long care-giving responsibilities. Care-giving responsibility by families become increasingly difficult as the parents become aged or infirmed. Special Olympics International (SOI) is to be commended for expanding its ``Special Smiles'' Program into its new Healthy Athletes Initiative. The Health Athletes Initiative works to improve the overall health of each Special Olympics athlete. Through this initiative SOI is increasing public awareness of the health needs of people with mental retardation, increasing their access to care, and training professionals to care for people with special needs. The Special Smiles program, initiated in 1993, includes a non- invasive oral exam, brushing and flossing instructions, mouthguard fabrication (at selected sites), provision of oral hygiene products, including toothbrush, toothpaste, and floss, and educational materials. Participating athletes benefit from a referral program designed to link people with special needs with dental professionals who are experienced in providing dental care to patients with mental retardation. Since 1993, over 53,000 athletes have been screened during Special Olympic State Games in 36 States and 2 international sites. Finally, we must point out that few formal connections exist between public health agencies and educational systems and other agencies that serve people with mild cognitive limitations. VISION FOR THE FUTURE The greatest barriers to the improvement in health status for people with mental retardation include stereotypes and negative attitudes among the public, governmental agencies, service providers, and, in some instances, among family members. Until the early 1970s, public policy emphasized the segregation of people with mental retardation from the rest of the population--first for therapeutic reasons and later for the ``protection of society.'' While we have overcome many of these barriers, we still have a distance to go before we reach our goal. We believe that the quality of life can be better in the future if we strategically focus our efforts in the following areas: --Developing and implementing a surveillance system that specifically targets the health status and needs of people with disabilities, including those with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. --Providing for Public Health surveillance of people with mental retardation to track prevalence, health status, risk behaviors, quality of life, and comorbid conditions. Such a surveillance program is challenging given that the nature of the condition limits the participation of the informant, people with mental retardation may not have ready access to a telephone, and people reluctant to disclose mental retardation. --When and where possible, and with measurable objectives, tracking the 10 Leading Health Indicators of Healthy People 2010 specifically for people with mental retardation. The first five indicators are lifestyle indicators: physical activity, overweight and obesity, tobacco use, substance abuse, and responsible sexual behavior. The remaining five are health systems indicators: mental health, injury and violence prevention, environmental quality, immunization, and access to health care. --Developing and implementing a balanced community-based health system for the mentally retarded. It should balance health promotion, disease prevention, early detection and universal access to care. --Exploring ways in which the federal government can be more responsive to the unique challenges and needs of people with mental retardation. --As with other areas of disparity in health, the legal implications of the plight of people with mental retardation needs to be better addressed. We should, therefore, work to protect the legal rights of people with mental retardation. --The research community should develop a research agenda targeting the problems, needs and opportunities for the mentally retarded. Completion of the human genome project will make it possible to better understand the genetic basis of human development. In addition, it will enable us to better understand the causes that underlie a variety of degenerative and metabolic disorders, including mental retardation. The theme of the Special Olympics is one that all of us can appreciate--``Let me win, but even if I don't, let me be brave in my attempt.'' We are all inspired by the sheer determination and persistence we see in the athletes who participate in the Special Olympics and it is out of that spirit that we must forge ahead toward this vision for the future. I realize these strategies represent high aims, but we owe it--not only to people with mental retardation but to all Americans--to press forward in a brave attempt to reach them. Senator Stevens. Thank you very much, Dr. Satcher. Ms. Swenson. STATEMENT OF SUE SWENSON, COMMISSIONER OF THE ADMINISTRATION FOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Ms. Swenson. Senator Stevens and representatives of Senator Specter's office, I am very grateful to have this opportunity to speak to you today. I represent a small program in the Department of Health and Human Services called the Administration on Developmental Disabilities. Five years before the first Special Olympics Games, Eunice Kennedy Shriver began the program. In partnership with her brother, President Kennedy, and with advice from Dr. Robert Cook, in 1963 she started a small program that would provide university training of professionals working with people who had mental retardation and developmental disabilities. Over the years, we have expanded. I am here today to tell you that there is much more we can do. I am, sir, a mother of three sons, one of whom has severe mental retardation and developmental disabilities. I have been a consumer of the programs that I am now in charge of. I know how effective they can be. I would like to briefly summarize the programs. First, every State has a Governor-appointed Developmental Disabilities Council. Ms. Bentley served on our council in Wisconsin. Second, every State operates a legal clinic called the Protection and Advocacy Agency that ensures that people with developmental disabilities are not abused and neglected. Finally, every State has at least one university center of excellence in developmental disabilities research training and service delivery. These centers provide community consulting services and training of professionals both before they become professionals and after they are already in practice. We help train them to understand the needs of people with mental retardation. This is a place where we can do much more than we have in the past and the reauthorization that was completed in October 2000 supports that goal. Last year's reauthorization was bipartisan in nature. There was cooperation between the administration and the Congress, and the resulting legislation positioned us to step up to the plate and do much more than we had in the past. I concur with everyone who has spoken today that access to health care, access to employment, which frequently is a way to get health care, and access to education, which is the way to get employment, are three serious problems that are affecting people with mental retardation. Part of my job is to go around the country and listen to the concerns of people who have mental retardation and developmental disabilities and their families. I hear that the medical profession is not aware of the needs of people with mental retardation and people with mental retardation have been shut out of the health care system. People with mental retardation and their families, every day in this country, ask for counseling from psychologists and are told there is no hope of feeling better because they have a disability, or their child does. There are people in this country every day who visit a doctor who does not spend the time or does not know how to explain what they need to know to manage their own health care. Every day, there are people with fetal alcohol syndrome in this country who are seeking treatment for alcohol abuse, so that they do not pass this disorder on to their own children. Every day, there are people seeking rape counseling, young women with mental retardation, who want to learn how to protect themselves and are not being encouraged or allowed to find ways to do that. Every day, there are people, who spend the whole day watching television and cannot even see the television set, because the glasses that they have are the wrong prescription, or they have no prescription, or the staff who work with them do not even understand that it is important to put the glasses on. Every day in this country we have people who are parents, and they have cognitive disabilities or mental retardation themselves, and when they take their child to the physician, they cannot get instructions to help them understand how to care for their child. Many of those children end up lost to the child welfare system, rather than being raised by parents who love them dearly. There is, in my experience, an underground market for information in this country among parents with children with mental retardation and developmental disabilities. We trade the names of physicians who will see us and who are able to understand us as if it were a secret resource. We can do better than that and programs can help do better than that. PREPARED STATEMENT We are a pipeline between, if you will, the exploration and the drilling that happens in CDC and NIH and the folks who are living with these disabilities on the street. We can do more and we will. Attention to the special needs of people with mental retardation and the developmentally disabled and to our programs will help. Thank you so much for elevating the level of attention to this area by holding this hearing today. [The statement follows:] Prepared Statement of Sue Swenson Chairman Stevens, Members of the Committee: Thank you for the opportunity to testify today in the beautiful State of Alaska about the health status of people with mental retardation. My name is Sue Swenson and I am the Commissioner of the Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) in the Administration for Children and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services. I am also the mother of three sons, one of whom has multiple disabilities, including cognitive disabilities (mental retardation). I will be speaking today from my experience as Commissioner, but as you know, no mother ever ceases being a mother. Most of what I am addressing is very close to my heart. THE ADMINISTRATION ON DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ADD is a nationwide system of State-based programs designed to help people with developmental disabilities such as mental retardation, live productive, independent, decent, ordinary lives, living in the community and integrated into our American way of life. Local programs funded by ADD are present in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United States. The programs are authorized by the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act (The DD Act). The Act was successfully reauthorized in the 106th Congress, and signed by President Clinton on October 30, 2000. The reauthorization was genuinely bi-partisan in both Houses, and reflected a strong partnership between the Administration and the Congress. The Act authorizes the following activities: --A Governor-appointed Council on Developmental Disabilities (DD Council) in every State and territory. The DD Council includes people with disabilities and their family members, with a special focus on including people who have severe developmental disabilities and their families. It also includes the chief State agencies that are responsible to serve people with developmental disabilities. The Council must track the needs of people with developmental disabilities in a State, plan for service improvements, and make grants and administer programs to test and demonstrate new ideas and service models. The Council is responsible for informing State leaders, including legislators, about the needs of people with developmental disabilities in the State. --A Protection and Advocacy Agency (P&A) in every State and territory. The P&A offers individual advocacy and legal services to Americans who have severe disabilities and would otherwise be unrepresented. The P&A is responsible for ensuring that individuals with developmental disabilities may be safe and free from harm. It seeks to improve conditions in congregate settings that are unsafe or abusive, and when improvements are not possible, it seeks to close these facilities and move residents to settings that are safer. --At least one University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Research, Training and Service is in every State and most territories. Previously known as University Affiliated Programs (UAPs), University Centers for Excellence (UCE) are housed in a university and mandated to work in and with the communities they serve. The goal of the nationwide network is to bring validated, best-practice disability initiatives into community practice in each State. UCEs translate the best of what science has to offer through interdisciplinary research, training activities and service demonstration efforts. UCEs train professionals for leadership positions and direct care workers for community services; work to ensure that systems are designed so that people with developmental disabilities have access to the services and supports they need; conduct research and validate emerging state-of-the-art practices; provide technical assistance to agencies and the community; and disseminate information to individuals with disabilities, families, public and private agencies, and policymakers. --Projects of National Significance, a program that addresses nationally significant and emergent issues that affect people with developmental disabilities and mental retardation. This program has historically identified emerging issues years before other larger grant programs fund them. Recent projects have focused on finding ways to meet the health care needs of people with mental retardation and developmental disabilities, as well as on housing, employment, and self-advocacy leadership development and self-determination initiatives. Also, Family Support projects are now operating in 40 States and territories. --With the reauthorization of the DD Act of 2000, two new titles were authorized. Title II, Family Support provides for a program of grants to develop and implement a statewide system of family support services for families of children with disabilities. Family support is a small and fast-growing part of every State's human services budget. It is a cost-effective family- centered service concept that is based on the principle that children should grow up in their own families, while recognizing that families of children with disabilities may need a little help to be able to raise their children at home, and that they are the experts on what that help should be. The other new authority, Title III, is a program for Direct Support Workers Who Assist Individuals with Developmental Disabilities. The program is to develop technology-savvy distance learning- based training programs for direct support workers, and establish in every State scholarships for people working in direct support who are earning college degrees. PROGRESS IN THE GENERAL STATUS OF AMERICANS WITH MENTAL RETARDATION People with cognitive disabilities (mental retardation) are leading the way to a time of rapid change in how they are treated by society. Only 40 years ago, most Americans who had the label grew up in very restricted circumstances. People often lived in institutions where the more able cared for the less able, with no pay, and some people lived their lives with no access to their families. To add to the indignity, when these people died, they were buried on the grounds of the institution in unmarked graves or in graves marked only by a number. Families who had children like my son often had no choice other than to institutionalize their child. Families were regularly counseled to ``put him away and forget you ever had him.'' The secrecy surrounding such a decision was often severe, and parents reported to their neighbors that their child had died. Americans who believe that there has never been a person with mental retardation in their family may not have the facts. Like the Rain Man, many people grew up isolated from their families to the extent that even their brothers and sisters didn't know they existed. It is sometimes thought that these institutions were ``hospitals'' where people received excellent health care. Many families institutionalized their sons and daughters hoping this was the case. Although some institutions may have reached this ideal, physicians who had lost their licenses to practice medicine on the ``outside'' administered many. Most people with mental retardation had life expectancies decades shorter than their peers without disabilities. It may be surmised that they received less medical care than their peers did. Now, people with mental retardation are almost always able to grow up in their families and go to school with other children. Special education and Medicaid have made it possible for people who even have more severe forms of mental retardation--such as my son--to grow up and live where they are loved. People with mental retardation are becoming more aware of each other, more connected to their regular community and to each other. They are forming ``self-advocacy'' organizations to help other people with disabilities who may not have families, move out of institutions and to help younger people with cognitive disabilities grow up to be proud of who they are. Many of the self-advocates are people who learned self-esteem and organizational skills through participation in Special Olympics. In my testimony I will use the term ``cognitive disability'' to mean what we usually mean by mental retardation--that is, a cognitive disability that occurs during a person's developmental years, before age 18. (Please note that cognitive disabilities may occur later in life as a result of head injuries or problems such as Alzheimer's disease, so not all cognitive disability is the same thing as what is now known as mental retardation). The Administration on Developmental Disabilities (ADD) is different from the major initiatives undertaken by the Federal government around disability. ADD does not do basic research into the biological causes of disability or into potential cures, though we are quite involved in understanding the social causes and behaviors that can increase a person's chances of experiencing disability. We are focused on finding ways to help people who already have disabilities live with those disabilities productively and independently, in the communities where they would otherwise live to the greatest extent possible. We are focused on listening and responding to people who have cognitive and developmental disabilities and their families in their own terms, so that improvements we seek to make are perceived as improvements by people who need them. Developmental disabilities are not the same as cognitive disabilities (or mental retardation). The legislative definition of developmental disability (DD) includes only those people whose cognitive disability or other disability is severe enough to require ongoing coordinated services and supports. There are probably 3 to 4 million Americans with a developmental disability and another 3 million who have milder forms of cognitive disabilities. It is not necessarily easier to live with milder forms of cognitive disability. For example, no one ever mistakes my son for a non-disabled person, while many people with milder cognitive disabilities must choose whether to tell others--such as doctors or employers--about their disability. In addition, many persons with milder forms of cognitive disability may not even know that their cognitive functioning would classify them as such. Thus, many of the accommodations available to Americans with visible or obvious disabilities are not readily available to persons with mild mental retardation. Even though the definitions of cognitive and developmental disabilities are different, the needs of people who have them can often be quite similar. Part of my job is to listen to the voices of people with cognitive and developmental disabilities and their parents. Let me share with you what they say about improvements they would like to see: --I have met countless mothers of children with a full range of disabilities who feel they should be offered help when they reach out for counseling in their churches or from a mental health professional. They tell me they are frequently told there is no hope of feeling better. --I have met people with cognitive disabilities who want to manage their own health care but they don't understand what a doctor says and they are too sad--or angry--to ask for a clearer explanation. --I have met people who have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and all of its attendant problems with impulsivity who tell me they wish substance abuse counselors understood their special problems. One lovely young women told me that she thought the fact that no alcoholism counselor talked to her about FAS meant that she was doomed by her mother's drinking to drink herself. She cried when she told me she still wanted children. --I have met women who have been raped who want to know how to be sure it never happens again--and women who have no hope that they will ever be able to protect themselves. --I have met people whose day consists of watching television--and they can't see the screen because they have never had a vision exam. Better health care for them would start with knowing that there is a world beyond five feet in front of their face. --I have met people with cognitive disabilities who have children, and who do not understand instructions the pediatrician or school nurse gives them. --I have met many parents of children with cognitive and developmental disabilities who trade the names and numbers of physicians and dentists who will see them--or who take Medicaid--as if they were the most important information imaginable. I have heard people say over and over again, everything changes when you find a dentist. These examples are common problems in every State. The Administration on Developmental Disabilities is making a difference. For example, ADD projects have: --Worked with Special Olympics International (SO) Healthy Athletes Program to identify and train optometrists to work with patients with cognitive disabilities--and then create a statewide database of these caring, trained professionals so that people can find someone to examine their eyes. --Funded Special Olympics to collect and analyze dental data from the Healthy Athletes Program, so that we might have a clearer picture of the need for dental care among people with have cognitive disabilities. --Developed model wellness programs to understand what it will take to engage people with cognitive and developmental disabilities in being responsible for their health and wellness. --Developed adaptations for exercise equipment to ensure that it is accessible to people with a wide range of disabilities. --Developed curricula to help people with cognitive and developmental disabilities, their families and their caregiving staff navigate managed care systems, and distributed the curriculum nationally. --Trained hundreds of medical and related health professionals to understand the needs of people with cognitive and developmental disabilities. Much more is possible. --Provided legal support to tens of thousands of people with cognitive and developmental disabilities who did not understand or receive the Medicaid and Medicare benefits that they need to survive and be healthy. --Worked with sexual violence programs to help them provide counseling to women who have cognitive disabilities--both after they are victims and before, to help them avoid becoming victims. --Worked with substance abuse programs to help them become accessible and effective so that people with cognitive and developmental disabilities can be successfully treated for drug and alcohol abuse. The above examples give some idea of the breadth of ADD's efforts. Of particular note in the health arena is the work of our University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities. For example: --The Alaska Center provides distance delivery of intensive home- based early intervention for preschoolers with autism; operates a computerized clearinghouse for mental health workers in the DD field; and shares a lead role in a major statewide Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) project. --The Arizona Center examines the incidence of autism and other developmental disabilities for CDC. Ongoing population-based review for FAS is also performed for CDC. Both projects are collaborations between the Arizona UCE at the University of Arizona (UA) and the Section of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, UA. Partners in these projects include the Arizona Department of Health Services, the State Division of DD, and many other state agencies and consumer organizations. --The New Jersey Center with funding from the New Jersey Technology Assistive Resource Program of NJ Protection & Advocacy, Inc. and The Boggs Center-UAP will train future family physicians, special child health coordinators, and others about assistive technology that supports communication and independence. --The Oregon Center has a Project Disabled and Healthy that promotes healthy lifestyle opportunities for persons with mental retardation. Through workshop training and a buddy system to support implementation, small groups of adult with developmental disabilities in urban and rural communities in Oregon are provided opportunities to learn and practice healthier lifestyles. Areas of change include nutrition, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco use, and stress management. With funding from ADD's PNS health care providers are informed about how to support healthier lifestyles in persons with disabilities who they serve. The above profiles show how different the Centers are from each other, and how their work complements work of other Centers. The Centers receive administrative care funds from ADD and then receive grants and contracts from State and other Federal funding sources. Each Center responds to the strengths of its host University as well as to the needs of people with developmental and cognitive disabilities in the home State. Each Center must focus on ensuring interdisciplinary training is available to professionals working or being trained in the State. The 2000 reauthorization of the Developmental Disabilities Act links these efforts together in a nationwide network for the first time. This model is expected to create new knowledge by helping us better manage what we already know. In my professional judgment, the new national network and knowledge management system will bring more change than we have ever seen in the lives of people with developmental and cognitive disabilities. It is our stated goal to ensure that Americans who have developmental and cognitive disabilities are as healthy as their non-disabled peers. ADD is fundamentally interested in improving the data systems to help our nation understand the health needs of these individuals. We also see that people with more involved disabilities rely on coordinated and integrated service from many different systems. Data from all of these systems should be integrated. We can then begin to understand that a person who has cognitive disabilities and is unable to drive a car may not be able to get from his or her home or job to a health care professional using public transportation. In this case, a transportation problem is expressed as a health care problem. Better integrated data systems would also allow us to explore the relationship between the needs of people who grow up with cognitive disabilities and the needs of people who develop cognitive disabilities as a natural part of their aging process or as an expression of Alzheimer's disease. There is much evidence that our society's efforts to include people with disabilities have collateral benefits for many other Americans as well. We know that curb cuts meant to make our neighborhoods and cities accessible to people who use wheelchairs are useful to people pushing baby strollers, as well as to joggers and delivery people. We should expect that improvements in the training of medical and related health professionals will allow them to treat aging Americans experiencing new cognitive limitations as well as people who grew up with cognitive disabilities. In turn, we will all benefit from a more informed health care system. Senator Stevens. Thank you very much. I am trying to figure out about our Global Messengers, whether they should continue to sit here the whole time. I think they may want to move around. Feel free to move around, and at the next break here we will move your chairs so you can sit back in the audience, okay? Dr. Satcher, what about this gap in the basic education of health care providers? How can we attack that? I am not sure Congress can do much about that. That is the medical profession, is it not? Dr. Satcher. Yes, it is. I think it is a partnership between the medical profession and the community. Dr. Lane was at the luncheon that we had Saturday and talked about a program at Case-Western Reserve where they actually bring mothers of children with mental retardation into the classroom to talk with students. I think an increase in this partnership between the community that is dealing with this problem and the medical educators is what is needed. The American Association of Medical Colleges certainly can become involved in helping to improve the curricula of medical schools. We need some models. Maybe the model at Case-Western is one that we should look at and try and get some other schools to adopt. That is not the only school. There are other schools that have made a real attempt to improve the sensitivity and awareness of medical students and residents when it comes to the mentally retarded. What we can do, perhaps, is define--here is what I am planning to do. It was not in my testimony. I did not make this decision until after my meeting Saturday. I want to have a Surgeon General's workshop on the treatment of persons with mental retardation. I want to bring experts, I want to bring parents, I want to bring persons with mental retardation, I want to bring medical educators, and I want to talk for at least 2 or 3 days about what we know and what we do not know, what research we need to do, and I want to issue a Surgeon General's report on the basis of that. Now, it is not the typical report that takes 2 years and is based on investigative science. This would be the result of a workshop, the kind of thing we did with action for suicide prevention. That had such a major effect on this country. It was a 3-day meeting that we had in Nevada, as you know, and has had tremendous impact. That is what I decided Saturday--after the luncheon with the parents--that we can do, and that is what I am going to do. It was not in my testimony. It was not vetted in the Department, but it is my commitment. Senator Stevens. That is good. I can remember in my younger days how we spent time traveling all over the country trying to find particular types of systems to deal with my cousin. What about this, from the point of view of special education techniques, is that related to medical care, or is it strictly related just to the education side of our society? Dr. Satcher. You mean, is it related to medical education? Senator Stevens. I am talking about special education for people with mental retardation, to help develop the full potential of their skills, and their ability to handle jobs, et cetera. Is that part of your side of this, or would it be just education--medical aspects, is what I am saying. Dr. Satcher. It is primarily the education side, but that can change, you know. When we did the Children's Mental Health report we worked with the Department of Education and the Department of Justice. Senator Stevens. Did you deal with people with PET scans capability, for instance, and run some of the tests for cognitive capability. Dr. Satcher. Oh, sure, the technology, definitely, most definitely. Senator Stevens. Is there more we should be doing in that area as well? Dr. Satcher. I think so. I think in general--and I did not make a point of this. It is in my testimony. I think we need a more balanced research agenda in this area, and all of the things we do not know is because we do not have the research. We have not had people writing proposals for NIH and CDC and other places in these areas, so we need a surveillance system first, and we need more emphasis on the balanced research. When I say balance, I mean, in addition to basic "
