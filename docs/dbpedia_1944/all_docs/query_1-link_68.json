        "text": "About the Book\n\nIn 2019 the NFL celebrated its 100th season. During that historic year the league selected an All-Time Team of 100 former star players. Among them were seven from before football’s free substitution rule (1920–1945), two-way players who were skilled at both offense and defense. They were: Sammy Baugh (Quarterback), Dutch Clark (Running Back), Dan Fortmann (Guard), Mel Hein (Center), Cal Hubbard (Tackle), Don Hutson (Wide Receiver) and Bill Hewitt (Defensive End).\n\nThere were more than just seven great players from those years, when men in leather helmets played multiple positions on dirt fields for modest salaries. This book ranks the NFL’s top two-way players, with detailed biographies and analysis by their contemporaries.\n\nAbout the Author(s)\n\nChris Willis has been the head archivist at NFL Films since 1996. He is the author of multiple books on professional football and was awarded the Professional Football Researchers Association’s Ralph Award for lifetime achievement in pro football research and historiography in 2012. In 2016 he won an Emmy for his work on HBO’s Hard Knocks. He lives in Audubon, New Jersey.\n\nBibliographic Details\n\nChris Willis\n\nFormat: softcover (7 x 10)\n\nPages: 312\n\nBibliographic Info: 51 photos, appendices, notes, bibliography, index\n\nCopyright Date: 2024\n\npISBN: 978-1-4766-9132-9\n\neISBN: 978-1-4766-5064-7\n\nImprint: McFarland\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPreface 1\n\nIntroduction 17\n\nNo. 1.

It is thoroughly researched and he lays out his case for each player. This is a good book for those interested in learning more about the players from the first few decades of the NFL.”—Ken Crippen, founder, lead instructor, and podcaster at the Football Learning Academy\n\n• “[Willis is] a pro football encyclopedia … To describe [this work] as comprehensive would be an understatement. … impeccable research … Best of all, the book is entertaining, with most of the chapters having photos to accompany the text. It’s an educational experience where you’re guided through an era too often forgotten, but it doesn’t read like a textbook. … recommended … if you care about NFL history, you should read [Willis’s] latest work”—Talk of Fame TWO"
