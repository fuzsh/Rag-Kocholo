I am really encouraged by how we played against UTEP. Our defense battled in the third quarter and our offense found a way to score late and put some distance between ourselves and UTEP. The challenge for us now is how do we continue to improve and handle success. We play a very good football team this weekend on the road in North Texas, they are a really well-coached team. It is going to be a challenge for us and it starts with practice this afternoon and tonight with our meetings.\"\n\nOn the run defense…\n\n\"We have made improvements. We have to take another step this week because if we cannot get them in second and long and third and long then it will be a long day for us… We have to take another step in our run defense. Our defense played 90 plays last week so they have to bounce back and have a good week in practice. I know coach Scott Power and the defense will do a good job finding answers for them and what they do in the run game.\"\n\nOn going back to his home state…\n\n\"There is a comfort level for me just because I lived in Fort Worth for seven years which is right down the road and I know a lot of guys on that staff. The comfort level is exciting. It is on us a s coaches to get our guys ready to play at a high level. There will be a lot of family and friends there but I also do not want a lot of family and friends to come and have us not lay very well.\"\n\nOn Smoke Harris…\n\n\"Giving him the ball early in the game and getting him into a rhythm gives our team a lot of energy. He brings that every single day. It is important to give him the ball and put him in a position to make everyone miss. We have a better idea of what all our guys can do well and their strengths and how to maximize them and put them in a position where they can succeed.\"\n\nCecil Singleton Jr.\n\nJoshua Mote\n\nPlayers Mentioned\n\n#6 Smoke Harris\n\nWR\n\n5' 7\"\n\nRedshirt Junior\n\n5th Year\n\n#64 Joshua Mote\n\nOL\n\n6' 3\"\n\nRedshirt Senior\n\n6th Year\n\n#2 Cecil Singleton Jr.\n\nDB\n\n6' 2\"\n\nRedshirt Junior"
