        "text": "Dave Hathcock came to Memphis as a track sprinter and turned his track career into an NFL career with the World Champion Green Bay Packers.\n\nA graduate of Kingsbury High School, Hathcock was awarded the University's first full track scholarship in 1961. He specialized in the hurdles and jumping events for the Tigers, but when his track career ended in 1965, Hathcock discussed staying another to play football for Billy J. Murphy.\n\nHe spent the 1966 season as the monster man for Murphy's defense and attracted the attention of professional scouts.\n\nHe was drafted by the Packers and was one of just three rookies to make the team in 1966. He played safety for Vince Lombardi and his Green Bay Packers for two seasons and became a member of the first Super Bowl champion squad. He was traded to the New York Giants in 1967 and played three seasons before a knee injury brought his football career to an end.\n\nHathcock earned two degrees from Memphis and has taught school and coached in the Nashville area for the past 30 years. He is presently at Hunters Lane School.\n\nHe and his wife Cheryl have three children, Jeff, Gary and Angie."
