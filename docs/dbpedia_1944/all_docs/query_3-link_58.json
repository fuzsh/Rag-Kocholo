        "text": "This was one of those African stories that seemed to have remarkably little to do with Africa and quite a lot to do with the West’s cinematic visions of it. Cecil was a black-maned lion under study by Oxford’s Wildlife Conservation Unit. He was named after a British imperialist who dreamed of a white-ruled Africa; he was killed for sport by a Minnesota dentist, and ostentatiously mourned by the American public, whose media he dominated for days. “I was like, ‘This is terrible, but thank God it wasn’t one of us, for once,’ ” Jimmy Kimmel said on live television, breathing heavily during long pauses. “Turns out, it was an American. It was one of us.” Mia Farrow was among many who tweeted the address of the dentist’s business, River Bluff Dental, where anonymous Minnesotans arranged a tableau of stuffed animals and roses before the entrance. The story was of such force that it could not dissipate into the news cycle, and instead spawned other stories that questioned the priorities driving the original story. Among the few African voices heard was that of Prisca Mupfumira, Zimbabwe’s acting information minister, who asked, “What lion?”\n\nHwange National Park is a fifty-six-hundred-square-mile game reserve in Northwest Zimbabwe. The hunting outfit that Walter Palmer hired, and to which he paid fifty-four thousand dollars, stands accused of luring the thirteen-year-old lion beyond the park’s boundaries. Palmer wounded the animal but left him alive, the kind of amateur mistake for which African professional hunters despise their Western clients. The men then tracked Cecil for forty hours, shot him, and attempted to disassemble his tracking device.\n\nThe park is not unknown to poachers, who, in 2013, killed three hundred elephants by pouring cyanide into watering holes, an incident that attracted considerably less media attention than the murder of a single elderly lion. The African protagonists of that story (“villagers,” the Telegraph called them) lacked Palmer’s villain-ready knowability, and the elephants lacked names. Cecil was a mascot who brought paying tourists into the park. He was also party to an Oxford research project, suggesting a pleasant concordance between an African ecosystem and British scientific inquiry. It was tragedy on the model of a highly touristed game reserve—just wild enough, a paradigm of productive inter-species coöperation against the backdrop of an American’s embarrassing, animal need for masculine display.\n\nCraig Packer, the director of the Lion Research Center at the University of Minnesota, where he is a professor of biology, and the author of a new book, “Lions in the Balance,” was initially drawn to the animals because they are the only social cats, given to sharing responsibilities in both hunting and the raising of cubs. His decades of research, conducted mostly in Tanzania, has revealed the evolutionary function of manes, the influence of prey density on the size of a pride’s territory, and the effects of drought on the spread of canine distemper virus in Africa. Packer does not think that lions are mystical. He does not think them morally admirable, kind, or possessed of a great wisdom inaccessible to modern man. (“Thick as a brick,” is his take.) There are no moments in which Packer feels profoundly understood by an individual lion, and there are, in fact, many individual lions in whom Packer sees no value at all. Captive animals, lifted from the landscape and, thus, from their evolutionary destiny, strike him as uninteresting. During the Iraq War, the head of a British animal-welfare organization asked Packer what to do with the lions found in Uday Hussein’s private menagerie. Should they be left in Iraq or airlifted to South Africa? Shoot them, he said.\n\nPacker likes this view of himself: the hard-nosed pragmatist, the truth-telling loner, immune to the communal emotionalism of the laptop conservationist. There is every reason to believe this self-characterization is accurate, given Packer’s tendency toward meticulously reasoned, wildly unpopular arguments that alienate those provisionally “on his side.” It is his position, as the story begins, that the lions of the Serengeti need sport hunters to survive; that Cecils must die if prides are to endure. The lions’ existential threat is not American machismo but the slow spread of traditional cattle ranchers, some of whom have been forcibly removed from their lands in order to make room for game parks, and who will poison or spear cattle-killing lions with or without government sanction. The semi-nomadic Maasai kill lions that kill their livestock, kill lions that kill their children, and kill lions to prove themselves brave. That more than a quarter of Tanzania has been given over to hunters means that it has not been given over to people trying to make a living—so there is still hope for the lions within. “Take away the incentive for hunters to grow a healthy crop of lions, and the king of beasts would be eliminated from most of its remaining range,” Packer argues, recalling the early days of his monomaniacal quest to save Tanzania’s remaining animals. “Lions needed trophy hunting as much as trophy hunting needed lions.”\n\nWhich is not to say that Packer feels comfortable among hunters, whose capitalist necessity renders them no less grotesque, in his view. Scanning kill shots on the Internet, he finds that hunters are killing lions as young as three years old. According to his research, only lions past the age of six can be removed while leaving a pride intact, the population unharmed. The dream, then—the workable, pragmatic dream of a man troubled by lived reality—is a regulated hunting industry in which operators steward the land while catering to a Western taste for blood.\n\nThis crisp vision, which has been successful in the fenced tracts of South Africa, relies upon assumptions of long-term stability. But Packer’s lions live under the jurisdiction of the Tanzanian bureaucracy, and here incentives are set less by supply and demand than by political necessity, friendships and favors and bribes. He finds hunting areas controlled by élite Tanzanians, who sublease them to operators, mostly Asian and French, who sell off the lions, then abandon the empty hunting blocks and lease new ones. Strip miners, Packer calls them, barons of an extractive industry with no investment beyond tomorrow.\n\nPacker duly sets out to change the system, a lone maverick of sober-minded regulatory reform. He takes meetings, promotes laws on lion age verification, invents many acronyms, develops a licensing system, and delivers endless PowerPoint presentations, which, for some reason, are given in full in his book, not excepting technical problems experienced during the delivery of the presentations. Looking past Packer’s stilted prose (“April did, indeed, seem to be the cruelest of months, as T. S. Eliot had said”) and his unfortunate narrative instincts, he emerges as devoted to the hard problem, the long view. “If these species are to survive,” he writes, with an air of wounded exasperation, “they will need something more imaginative than an online petition.”\n\nIn other words, they will need someone like Luke Sidewalker, a mysterious character, identical to Packer in every respect, who appears mid-book. Packer/Sidewalker begins recording secret interviews with unnamed sources in the Tanzanian bureaucracy. The director of the Wildlife Department, Packer/Sidewalker discovers, is himself involved in the ivory trade, which is to say he profits from the poaching he is charged with preventing. A member of the department who challenged the director was “hacked … to pieces” at his home. Packer develops a damning PowerPoint, at what appears to be great personal risk. He is mugged in front of his hotel but escapes with his computer, and later presents his PowerPoint to USAID, the World Bank, and other donor organizations, who then forward it to every embassy in Tanzania. That year, the director is sacked.\n\nAnd yet the outsider’s attempt to reform the deep culture of a foreign institution goes much as one would expect. The new director brings only good will, not a capacity to change the corrupt allocation of the hunting lands. Laws are passed and utterly unenforced. Stymied, Packer turns to the hunters themselves, begging them to self-police before nothing remains to hunt.\n\nPacker's willingness to engage those who shoot lions for fun—to pivot between the language of “sustainable harvest” and that of open slaughter—extends to an Indianapolis billionaire with a glass-walled museum featuring more than a thousand trophies, of three hundred and eighty-five species. “He flicks on the lights,” Packer writes, “but they are so dim it takes a while to make out the menagerie—the stuffed hyena in a frozen lope, headed toward a stuffed lion that has grabbed hold of a stuffed zebra stallion.”\n\nThis need for role play, this desire to create a simulacra of the wild behind glass in an Indianapolis mansion, is interesting, but like most everything not readily explained in a series of slides it goes unexplored by Packer. Here is a yearning to connect not with a morally uplifting “wild”—the rose-strewn stuffed animals of Cecil’s shrine—but with the morally neutral, frequently dangerous world with which Packer is familiar. Here is a dream not of gauzy paternalism but of violent participation, as if a Midwestern businessman could drop into his museum during lunch and become, for a moment, Maasai, absent the threat to one’s life, livelihood, and children. “I’m worried about the future of big game hunting,” David H. Barron, a former Reagan aide and the founder of the International Conservation Caucus Foundation, tells Packer, who has recently witnessed a man accidentally speared to death during olamayio, a Maasai ritual meant to prove male bravery. “The younger generation is missing out on an essential part of what it means to be a man. These boys will all grow up to be metrosexuals with no idea how the world works or how to behave.”\n\nThe gap between this view and that of romanticized conservation is the one Packer inhabits, and the great interest of his book is in watching him careen between the two. Conservationists ask him not to speak of the fact that lions kill a hundred Tanzanians a year, many of them children sent out to tend the cattle; it hurts donations and, presumably, online petitions. Nature films, “edited in ways to show a largely fictional narrative for the sake of dramatic impact,” antagonize Packer. On explaining the potential benefits of sport hunting to a group of conservationists in Botswana, he writes, “the feeling was somewhat the same as teaching evolution to a large class of freshman in the Midwest: knowing that no matter what you say, no matter how extensive or clear the evidence, there will always be about half the students who will refuse to accept anything that threatens their faith in Genesis.”\n\n“Lions in the Balance” is itself a story about a loss of faith, and Packer’s anti-romanticism is such that there is no ameliorative lesson to take from his exhausting, decades-long quest to reform a practice that will not be reformed. Hunters will not self-regulate; Tanzania's bureaucracy will not be tamed. Cattle ranchers will continue to kill lions and destroy habitats. “The free market economic model for conservation has failed,” he writes, after long years of struggle.\n\nIn 2014, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature asked Packer to evaluate recent surveys of the last remaining African lions. Lion populations are stable in massive, fenced reserves in Kenya, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, lions in unfenced reserves in West Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia have shown a sixty-two-per-cent decline in twenty-one years. Having given up on the dream of a regulated hunting industry, Packer has a plea for conservationists: build ten-foot walls. Policing unfenced reserves against ever-growing numbers of pastoralists is demonstrably too expensive for African states. There is no market solution, but there are, according to Packer’s research, better and worse ways to use donations.\n\nThis idea was not well-received, contradicting as it does the idea of a landscape unsullied by human hands. Packer’s support for fencing prompted the Frankfurt Zoological Society to pull funding from one of his graduate students. A conservationist e-mails to say that he would “rather see the Serengeti disappear completely than with a fence around it.” A “major conservation agency” will only promote the preservation of “virgin wilderness.”\n\nIt’s hard to measure the virginity of a wilderness, but whatever conservationists might be reaching for here Cecil was surely not it. The lion’s popularity was due in part to his comfort with human contact, his acclimation to a highly unnatural environment wherein people were not predators but active protectors. “Semi-domesticated,” the president of the Safari Operators Association of Zimbabwe called him. The lions of the Selous—an unfenced Tanzanian migratory ecosystem the size of Switzerland—are not semi-domesticated, and they are not named after British imperialists, and they are in trouble.\n\nThe lack of interest in the plight of Serengeti lions concurrent with ongoing pro-Cecil protests is hard to square, and suggests that an African animal only interests us for as long as we can focus on something or someone closer to home. “One of us,” Kimmel called Walter Palmer. That is his great crime and great interest, the crucial detail that continues to motivate what can only be called a pro-Cecil movement. Cecil was killed in July, but Cecil rallies roll right along—in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles next month, and in Vegas this winter.\n\nIt's bracing, reading the end of Packer’s text, to watch him wrestle with his own impotence. Exhausted, he sobs in front of his son, afraid for his own safety and that of his family. The Tanzanian government eventually forces him to abandon the Serengeti. In his quest to restructure incentives, in his willingness to take the long view, in his commitment to numbers over narrative, Packer deems himself “ultimately alone.”"
