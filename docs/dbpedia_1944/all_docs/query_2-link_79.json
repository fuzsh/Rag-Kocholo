        "text": "Tyler joined our founding partner, Tom Shrout, in 2000 as the second-generation leadership of Shrout Tate Wilson. His management style is logical and deliberate – qualities he developed while in law school and engineering school. He is known in the business community for being a hands-on leader who stays connected with both employees and clients. His love for people and building professional relationships has guided STW’s steady growth for almost twenty years.\n\nAs a PE and an RCDD (Registered Communications Distribution Designer), his credentials underscore his abilities to design, implement, and integrate information technology and security systems. His organized workflow, commitment to STW’s clients, and his contribution to our best projects is noteworthy.\n\nTyler also serves as Principal over our Louisville office where he leads our projects for Brown Forman, Jefferson County Public Schools, and several community-centric projects including the renovation of the Fort Nelson Building into the Michter’s Visitor Center and the Wheelhouse Project for Boys & Girls Club.\n\nTyler is a member of the Rotary Club and served on the Lexington Board of Directors from 2008-2013. He and his wife Susan have three children. As a family, they value spending time together with summer weekends on the lake and winter break on the slopes.\n\nRalph Whitley is a firm principal and mechanical engineer. Prior to joining STW in 2010, Ralph worked in the design-build arena where he led HVAC design for manufacturing clients like Toyota Boshoku, Link Belt, FedEx, and Nestle.
