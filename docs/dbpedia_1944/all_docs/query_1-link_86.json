        "text": "Middle Tennessee State football snapped a three-game losing streak and earned its first Conference USA victory with a 31-23 win over visiting Louisiana Tech on Tuesday night at Floyd Stadium.\n\nThe Blue Raiders (2-5, 1-2 CUSA) outscored the Bulldogs (3-5, 2-2) 17-9 in the first half and held on late.\n\n\"Great win ... really proud of our team,\" MTSU coach Rick Stockstill said. \"I thought we played good, complimentary football in all three phases.\"\n\nMTSU will be on the road Tuesday at Liberty in a big conference game before having 18 days off.\n\nHere's what we learned from Tuesday's win:\n\nMTSU comes up with big answer\n\nLast week, MTSU had no answers for a Jacksonville State 38-0 run that turned the game around in a 45-30 loss.\n\nThat wasn’t the case Tuesday.\n\nAfter allowing a late third-quarter touchdown on a fourth-and-1 from the 6-yard line to make it 24-16, MTSU answered with a 60-yard touchdown pass from Nick Vattiato to Holden Willis.\n\nWillis made a double move past nickel corner Roderick Roberson to get open and took the ball 35 yards after the catch to give the Blue Raiders a two-score lead again.\n\n\"Just make sure I didn't overthrow him,\" said Vattiato, on seeing Willis break open. \"He got a man-to-man look and, credit to him, he won. It made my job easy. The run after the catch was special, too.\"\n\nBulldogs miss opportunities\n\nLouisiana Tech missed two big opportunities for touchdowns, one in the second quarter and the other early in the third. False start penalties were factors in both.\n\nThe Bulldogs had a 12-play, 60-yard drive that started early in the second, moving inside the MTSU 5 before a penalty backed them up and helped to force a 23-yard field goal.\n\nOn the first possession of the second half, Louisiana Tech again drove inside the Blue Raider 5, but a false start penalty forced a pass on third-and-goal that was intercepted by MTSU’s Tra Fluellen in the end zone.\n\n\"I did my job,\" Fluellen said. \"Our whole defense stayed together. Offense and defense were together today. That's why we came out with a win.\"\n\nMTSU took advantage of the interception, driving 80 yards for a 9-yard TD run by Jaiden Credle to take a 24-9 lead.\n\nAnother big game for Vattiato\n\nVattiato followed up last week’s 408-yard passing performance with a big effort against Louisiana Tech.\n\nVattiato, who attempted 17 passes in the first quarter, finished 23-of-29 for 248 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed for a TD.\n\n\"A big part of it was being good on first and second downs,\" Vattiato said of the team going 10-of-16 on third downs. \"The offensive line played really well today. I'm so proud of them.\"\n\nVattiato had help in the running game. With Frank Peasant out because of an undisclosed injury, Credle stepped up, carrying 13 times for 65 yards and a touchdown.\n\nLouisiana Tech makes QB switch\n\nAfter playing sophomore Jack Turner for the first half and the first possession of the third quarter, Louisiana Tech changed to redshirt senior Hank Bachmeier.\n\nBachmeier, a Boise State transfer, started the team’s first four games but had missed the previous three because of a shoulder injury.\n\nTurner, who did play some after the switch, was 14-of-23 for 162 yards and a touchdown, but he also threw a costly interception in the end zone on the first possession of the third quarter.\n\nBachmeier finished 16-of-24 for 178 yards and a touchdown."
