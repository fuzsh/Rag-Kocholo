Dr. Carlson also sees patients for a wide variety of general orthopedic issues and problems and favors conservative treatment for his patients.\n\nHe is a thought leader and pioneer in the development and implementation of outpatient spinal surgery procedures and techniques, including Less-Exposure Spine Surgery (LESS), which is minimally invasive, and less traumatic for the patient.\n\nHe actively seeks new and advanced technologies as treatment options, carefully selecting those that will offer the best outcomes for his patients. Recently, Dr. Carlson added the Medacta MySpine® Lumbar Fusion Surgical Navigation System to the services he offers for his patients, which enhances surgical accuracy and reduces surgical trauma to the patient during lumbar fusions.\n\nDr. Carlson received his B.S. from the University of Maryland, and promptly began medical school at George Washington University. Upon completion of medical school, Dr. Carlson did an internship in General Surgery at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center.

One was in Orthopaedic Trauma surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital, and the other a combined Neurosurgical and Orthopaedic Fellowship in Spine Surgery at Harvard’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Dr. Carlson was also an instructor of Orthopaedic Spine Surgery at Harvard University before joining OSC. Dr. Carlson was the first fellowship-trained spine surgeon on the Virginia Peninsula.\n\nIn June 2022, Dr. Carlson was awarded his Certified Physician Executive (CPE) credential after completing 170 hours of course work and a 3 1/2 day Capstone Program and in-person summary presentation in Tampa, Florida.

He has been on some type of pain medication ever since. He had been receiving injections for pain management over the past 10 years. It reached the point where the injections were no longer effective in controlling the pain. He finally reached the point where he could no longer endure the pain and we made an appointment with Dr. Jeffrey Carlson. Dr. Carlson said he could fix the problem and we set up a… Read More\n\nEugene Gale – Multi-level Lumbar Spine Fusion Surgery\n\nMy experience regarding the evaluation and management of my neck (cervical) condition, under the care of my colleague Dr. Jeffrey R. Carlson, M.D. has been outstanding. He was highly recommended to me and I am very happy that I chose him as my cervical spine orthopedic surgeon. His practice includes a state of the art facility and is very efficient and convenient. He employs an excellent support staff and has many convenient on-site ancillary services. The staff at Mary Immaculate Hospital… Read More\n\nSamuel Tyson, MD – Four-Level Cervical Decompression & Fusion Surgery\n\nI injured my neck 30 years ago and lived with pain and numbness in my left arm, hand and neck every day. I went to multiple doctors, to include two other orthopaedic offices, and no one offered any help or relief until I visited Orthopaedic and Spine Center. My first visit with Dr. Jeffrey Carlson offered me hope, he immediately explained why I had the pain and numbness and explained what my options were. I had cervical spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease and an herniated nucleus… Read More\n\nBarbara Summers – Epidural Steroid Injections, Cervical Discectomy Surgery & PT\n\nFor several years I had been putting up with pretty severe back, pain but was reluctant to have back surgery, considering all the horror stories that had been told. These included people who had back surgery who ended up worse off and some had trouble getting around. After my pain got to the unbearable point which affected my daily life, including stopping playing handball, I decided to see Dr. Carlson of the Orthopaedic and Spine Center. He discussed all the options, which included surgery,… Read More\n\nJames Pressick – Spine Surgery\n\nWhen I told my friends that I will be undergoing a spinal fusion surgery, their first question was “where?” I responded “OSC (Orthopaedic & Spine Center) at 250 Nat Turner BLVD”. They would say, “Chris, we hope that you have Dr. Jeffrey Carlson as your surgeon. Carlson is more popular than Ferrarius – the Sicilian.” From his direct and focused gaze to his soothing voice, you can tell you are in good hands when Dr. Carlson is your physician. The team of doctors who worked on me did a… Read More\n\nChris Ozor – Cervical Spinal Fusion Surgery\n\nDear Dr. Carlson, Thank you so much for the lovely plant. Even more so, thank you for fixing my back so I want to get up and live again. On June 26, 2015, I visited a chiropractor. The next morning, I was unable to get out of bed by myself. It continued to get worse. I came to you because I was told you were great with backs. After several shots, I elected to go with the surgery. I was operated on 9-8-2015. By the middle of September, I decided you must have angel wings on… Read More\n\nGwen Allen, Spine Surgery\n\nAbout a year ago, I woke up suddenly in extreme pain, I could not walk. After many trips to the doctors, the cause was diagnosed, I had a nerve that was touching a vertebrae. I did everything but fly a kite in a thunderstorm to relieve the pain. Since I was very apprehensive about BACK SURGERY, I figured interviewing some doctors would help. So I did my research, read bios, surgery experience for my particular condition, testimonials etc. One of the surgeons I visited was Dr. Jeffrey… Read More\n\nSherry – Spinal Surgery\n\nI had lower lumbar spinal fusion for a degenerative disk issue. My surgery went well and I was happy to go home the same day, even walking out by myself with a walker. I was skeptical at first to go home, because of what I kept reading online about recovery. I was home and comfortable with my family. I prepared myself for a comfortable way to sleep and sit before the surgery and had everything ready at home. I kept up with my pain medicine as they said for the first couple of days and it didn’t… Read More\n\nTanya Taskey – Lumbar Spine Fusion\n\nThis endorsement is a long time in coming as I am one who does not give an endorsement lightly… In the spring of 2016, I started to suffer pain in my right leg, specifically the thigh and calf. It seemed to be little more than a sprain or strain, but it got worse. The pain got so bad, I could not walk, stand, or sit. I just fell to the floor in agony. My Primary Care Provider tried muscle relaxers and pain meds and recommended physical therapy. Although all helped, none solved the… Read More\n\nBruce Jensky – Spinal Cyst Removal and Lumbar Fusion Surgery\n\nWhile living in Florida, I was a patient at an orthopedic sports medicine facility where I received shots for my back pain, but had no positive results. After returning to Virginia from Florida, I knew I had to finally address my back problem and go forward with a second spinal fusion. While at a dinner, I was fortunate enough to speak to someone who had similar problems, and recommended I go see Dr. Jeffrey Carlson. Dr. Carlson was great to work with from start to finish- giving me options… Read More\n\nDoug Kieper – Lumbar Spinal Fusion\n\nIn August of 2018, I herniated a disk in my back preparing for an impending storm. The pain was excruciating. When I called OSC, I had no idea what to expect because I had been cared for through the Military system for 30 years. From the moment I spoke to the folks at OSC, I knew I was in good hands. Dr. Jeffrey Carlson and the staff there knew I was in serious pain and they all showed such great compassion for me. Dr. Carlson\\’s staff helped with pain management until there was a final… Read More\n\nBryant Clark – Microdiscectomy Surgery for Herniated Disc\n\nI was referred to OSC, Dr. Jeffrey Carlson, by my mother and father. My father had to have a full back fusion about 2 years ago and he was referred to Dr. Carlson. Let me say that at first, I did not listen to my mother, (boy, if I had a dollar for every time I should have listened to her) which was yet again the wrong thing to do. I hate when she is right! My issues started in January of 2017, with what I thought was just a pulled muscle and hip pain. I was having trouble standing or… Read More\n\nBarbara Talhelm – Lumbar Spine Fusion Surgery\n\nI had my fourth back surgery (previous one was 17 years ago) and have had a remarkable recovery.

I am a 23 year old, active female who enjoys going to the gym several times a week. I began having lower back pain in November of 2017. I had already gone through back surgery for a herniated disc at L4-L5 when I was 17 (also done by Dr. Jeffrey Carlson), so as soon as I felt the slightest twinge in my back, I made sure to rest and try to allow my back to recover. For 2 months, I refrained from any intense work outs,… Read More\n\nIleana Geary – Lumbar Spinal Fusion Surgery\n\nMY BACK, A STORY WITH A FUSION CONCLUSION It began years ago, as many stories do. I did things I probably should not have done, forcing my back to support more off center weight than it should have. Added to those missteps were years (almost 40) of climbing vertical steel ladders of cranes with a heavy shoulder tool bag. To combat the nagging pains, journeys to chiropractors helped. Within recent years, those chiropractor’s visits did not seem to help. The chiropractor noticed the lack… Read More\n\nTim Miller – Multi-level Lumbar Fusion\n\nI came to Dr. Carlson for severe lower back pain after receiving no help or treatment from another physician. My first visit was in September of 2013, just prior to our leaving for a 2 week trip to Ireland. Dr. Carlson not only listened intently to my description of the pain, but offered immediate information and means towards some relief. I was scheduled for an epidural and sent to physical therapy. It was the physical therapy that I did faithfully that literally got me through the 2 week… Read More\n\nLinda Stewart – Spine Surgery\n\nHi, my name is Jay (James) Titlow, and I am a patient of Doctor Jeffrey Carlson. I also have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s, for almost 20 years. The BEST “fix” to minimize the adverse effects of Parkinson’s to date, is to exercise. Unfortunately the torque and stiffness I often experience in my lower back, is the price I pay to keep my daily gym ritual intact. I have had 2 lumbar fusions with Dr. Carlson. Within a few months of my 1st surgery, the back pain returned… disappointing. Since… Read More\n\nJay (James) Titlow – Lumbar Fusion Surgeries\n\nMy name is Sharon. I relocated from New York and needed a chiropractic doctor and my friend recommended Orthopaedic & Spine Center to me. I was given an appointment with Dr. Jeffrey Carlson, I went to OSC because of an old neck injury that happened in 1998. I recently had experienced numbness in my pinky and ring finger in both hands and I was walking like I was intoxicated (and I don’t drink). Dr. Carlson put me into Physical Therapy, which really didn’t help much. So, I had to… Read More\n\nSharon Oliver – Multi-Level Cervical Discectomy Surgery\n\nMy name is Kenny Meekins. I am a retired high school baseball coach and athletic director from Manteo, NC. For the last 5 years, I have experienced low back pain. After retiring in Jan. 2016, I imagined my retirement being very active. The more active I tried to be, the more pain I started to experience. Riding a bike, walking, and playing golf became more difficult as the sciatica pain in my left leg became more excruciating. I started looking for a Doctor in August of 2016 to find my… Read More\n\nKenny Meekins – Multi-level Lumbar Spinal Fusion\n\nI had chronic back pain due to a herniated disk for 16 years due to an injury as a teen. Fortunately, for the longest time, I was able to manage the pain with physical therapy and chiropractic care. I live a very active lifestyle that includes distance running, golf, boxing, weightlifting and playing with my two energy-filled Australian Shepherd dogs. In early 2018, the pain that I had felt time and time again was suddenly much worse. I attempted the forms of treatment that had previously… Read More\n\nKyle Haymes – Multi-level Lumbar Spine Fusion Surgery\n\nI’ve had low back pain for 20 years. I decided enough is enough and consulted Dr. Jeffrey Carlson. After the MRI, Dr. Carlson explained In great detail what was found. S1, L3, L4, and L5 needed fixing.

I went to see Dr. Jeffrey R. Carlson on 18 May 2018, after having seen another physician, who was more interested in satisfying the needs of the insurance company rather than taking care of my needs as a patient. Dr. Carlson performed a through examination, reviewed my MRI, and assessed that the only treatment/cure for my ruptured disc was surgery. Dr. Carlson was extremely caring as was evidenced during my initial… Read More\n\nJ.A. Faulkner, Jr. – Lumbar Spine Surgery\n\nMy name is Karen Levy and I am 66 years old. I had pain in my left hip for about 2 years. Based on the description of my symptoms, my Primary Care Physician sent me to an Orthopaedic Specialist. He treated me for bursitis, gave me a cortisone injection in my hip bursa and sent me to Physical Therapy. None of that treatment worked and the pain persisted. I had seen Dr. Jeffrey Carlson at OSC before and loved him.

After going to my PCM, which happens to be the US Navy since I am retired military, I got a referral out of the USN system to see a Spine Surgeon.

On July 3, 2012, I went to see a chiropractor, Dr. Boon, in Williamsburg, who I have been seeing since 1991.

At the time, I was the sole caregiver for my 94 year old mother who had ALZ and I was becoming less and less able to care for her.
