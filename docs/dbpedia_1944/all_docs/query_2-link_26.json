He serves as the director of the PhD program at Simmons and is also a Hartford Faculty Scholar and national mentor. Maramaldi holds a faculty appointment at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine in Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology, where he mentors post-doctoral trainees and conducts research. In addition, Maramaldi retains a faculty appointment at the Harvard School of Public Health where he teaches in the department of social and behavioral sciences. He also teaches courses in patient interviewing and interdisciplinary collaboration at the Harvard Medical School where he has a long-standing affiliation. Maramaldi developed the interdisciplinary opportunity for Simmons social work students to earn an MPH degree at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nHis national service includes pro bono work as a commissioner for the Council on Social Work Education. Maramaldi practiced social work and managed non-profit organizations for more than 25 years before launching his academic research career. He is an expert in behavioral interventions that promote social justice in health care and has a consistent funding record from the National Institutes of Health and major foundations. Maramaldi’s current funded research includes a national demonstration project to address childhood dental caries through behavioral interventions with families, the development of a patient safety toolkit using electronic health records to identify and reduce the occurrence of adverse events, and the development of a whole-systems approach to implementing standardized dental diagnostic terms. His extensive consulting work in evidence-based health promotion across disciplines addresses individual needs through population interventions.\n\nI consider teaching a tremendous honor and an even greater responsibility. I continue to learn as much from my students as I hope that they learn from me. In teaching, I use experiences and training that range from my earliest learning and mistakes in Manhattan and the Bronx, N.Y., in 1972, to my current work based at Simmons. Although my work has evolved to a point where my expertise in behavioral health makes a large part of my teaching quite advanced, I’m especially invested in non-traditional MSW students, those who doubt their ability, wonder if it is too late for them to enter a profession, or think of themselves as not smart enough to do the coursework. I’m effective with that segment of our MSW student population, as I was one of them myself. As a result, I focus on students’ ability and strength, watch them build self-confidence, and then cheer them on as they go off to do good work.\n\nPhD, Columbia University\n\nMPH, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health\n\nMSSW, Columbia University School of Social Work\n\nBA, Montclair State University\n\nReturn to top\n\nPhD: Columbia University School of Social Work\n\nMSW: Columbia University School of Social Work\n\nBA: Colorado College\n\nI am a licensed clinical social worker and use my social work experience in housing, inpatient psychiatry, day treatment programs, and tele-behavioral health to inform my teaching, scholarship, and community engagement. As a researcher and practitioner my passion lies with understanding the stories and developing the potential of persons diagnosed with serious mental illnesses, especially older adults. As an educator I am committed to a pedagogy that actively promotes the self-care and wellbeing of social work students in an inclusive and holistic manner, and extending my vision of social work student and professional thriving to other professions.\n\nI am conducting my current research in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health, Office of Recovery and Empowerment. I also provide psychotherapy with Talkspace, a tele-behavioral health program.\n\nCurrently I am working on several research projects, all generally aimed at improving the mental wellbeing of those experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, mental health disorders. One project involves development of an intervention that uses evidence-informed positive psychology tools to improve the experience of aging with serious mental illnesses. I am also collaborating with Dr. Rachel Williams in the Simmons School of Library and Information Sciences on a study that seeks to understand challenges facing public librarians as they interact with library patrons in crisis, and how training and improved self-care can improve their professional experience and service provision. I am also co-principal investigator on a project funded by the Boston Children’s Hospital Community Health Initiative called the Simmons Trauma Education Project, which will recruit and train diverse trauma-specialized social workers who are committed to working with trauma-affected children and families in the Boston area post MSW graduation. Finally, I have been working on teaching and learning scholarship projects that support the mental health of social work students through integration of evidence-based self care practices into social work course material.\n\nPast projects have ranged from collecting and analyzing life histories of older adults with schizophrenia-spectrum diagnoses, to using focus groups to understand barriers and facilitators to the implementation of an evidence-based substance use intervention called “SBIRT” (Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment). From 2012-2016, as a co-principal on a SAMHSA grant to integrate SBIRT into the social work core curriculum and practice, I also helped lead the development and implementation of trainings for faculty, field instructors, and students.\n\nMy recently published articles appear in Advances in Social Work Practice, American Journal of Orthopsychiatry, Qualitative Health Research, Journal of Social Work Education, Journal of Social Service Research, Journal of Social Work in Disability and Rehabilitation, Qualitative Social Work, Social Work in Health Care, and Journal of Aging Studies.

Putnam holds a bachelor’s degree in history from the University of Michigan, a master’s degree in gerontology from Scripps Gerontology Center at Miami University in Ohio, a doctorate in Social Welfare from the School of Public Affairs at UCLA, and served as a post-doctoral fellow at the NIDRR funded Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Health and Wellness at Oregon Health and Sciences University. Her research focuses on the intersections of aging and disability, with particular emphasis on understanding how public policy meets the needs of persons aging with disability. Within this area, her work examines collaborations between aging and disability service providers and their capacity to serve the aging with disability population, long-term care and support needs of persons aging with disabilities, the role of activity portfolios in fostering well-being among older adults, and the relationship of asset accumulation and fostering activity and equity among older adults and persons aging with disability. In addition to her research, Putnam is engaged at the national and international level in building bridges across the aging and disability fields of policy and practice.\n\nI teach because class is one of the most interesting places I spend my time. In my classroom, learning is not one way, it is depending on the exchange of ideas between students and myself and among students themselves.

Thomas, PhD, MSW, is an Associate Professor and the MSW Director at Simmons University School of Social Work. Dr. Thomas has extensive practice, teaching, and research expertise in the field of anti-violence. Her work is focused on developing solutions to improve outcomes for people affected by intimate partner violence – particularly those who are economically and socially marginalized. In addition to many peer-reviewed articles, Dr. Thomas has authored online trainings, toolkits, and validated measures that are used widely by researchers and practitioners across the country. She is a recipient of the National Institute of Health’s, Health Disparities Loan Repayment Program, a highly competitive award that supports the research of health professionals.\n\nDr. Thomas teaches at the master and doctoral level in the School of Social Work, mentors Ph.D. students in their dissertation work, and provides graduate students with research opportunities on her many current projects. Additional teaching interests include program evaluation, community organizing and development, and public health frameworks. Dr. Thomas is deeply dedicated to teaching, explaining that, “I will be forever indebted to my professors at the University of Pennsylvania; their wisdom, expertise, and constant quest for excellence and innovation – within themselves and among their students – continue to inform my research and teaching. My goal is to offer the same quality of training to my own students.” Dr. Thomas is the recipient of two teaching awards: The Provost Award for Student-Centeredness in Graduate Teaching (2017), and the SAGE/American Evaluation Association Early Career Excellence in Teaching Award (2019).\n\nDr. Thomas serves the community and profession locally and nationally. In 2011, she co-founded the New England-based Domestic Violence Program Evaluation and Research Collaborative (DVPERC), which is comprised of over a dozen domestic violence programs and a handful of researchers spanning social work, psychology, and medicine. One of DVPERC’s many projects led to the development of MOVERS (the Measure of Victim Empowerment Related to Safety), a validated outcome measure that has been adopted widely for research and evaluation purposes.\n\nPrior to joining the Simmons faculty, Dr. Thomas served as assistant director of the Ortner Center on Violence & Abuse in Relationships at the University of Pennsylvania and a research consultant for the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women. She received her MSW and PhD from the University of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy & Practice.\n\nDr. Thomas conducts applied, community-based, and interdisciplinary research on the topic of intimate partner violence. She is currently completing a large-scale evaluation of a permanent housing program for IPV survivors in New York. She recently completed a research study funded by the Fatherhood Research and Practice Network that focuses on Responsible Fatherhood Groups as a vehicle for domestic violence education and prevention as well as an innovative pilot project called SASH (Survivors Achieving Stable Housing). Other recent collaborative research projects include the development of an online training for practitioners who work with people affected by intimate partner violence, and an online toolkit for emerging researchers on conducting community-based participatory research with members of the domestic violence community.\n\n2017-2020 Co-Lead Evaluator (with Jill Messing).
