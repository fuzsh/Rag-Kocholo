        "text": "A four-time Super Bowl champion and the first winner of the John Mackey Award headline this edition of Purdue football Who Wore It Best.\n\nAlso on this list are two of the best passers in Purdue history, back in the days before quarterbacks wore numbers between 1 and 19, not to mention a record-setting wide receiver and a member of the legendary NFL defensive line, \"The Fearsome Foursome.\"\n\nNo. 81\n\nThe pick: Lamar Lundy\n\nThe 6-7 Lundy became the first African-American star athlete at Purdue, not only earning team MVP honors in football but in basketball, too, as a senior. He led the Boilermakers in receiving as a senior in 1956 and was a two-time second-team All-Big Ten end.\n\nHe began his NFL career with the Los Angeles Rams as a wide receiver but soon was shifted to defensive end, where he teamed up with Deacon Jones, Merlin Olsen and Roosevelt Grier to form \"the Fearsome Foursome.\" He is a member of both the Indiana Football and Basketball halls of fame.\n\nHonorable mention: Harold Wells (1962-64) was an Associated Press All-American defensive end in 1964 before enjoying a four-year NFL career with the Philadelphia Eagles. ... End Jim Beirne (1965-67) was a first-team All-American, first-team All-Big Ten and a CoSIDA Academic All-American selection in 1967. He left Purdue with several career and single-season receiving records; his career yardage record stood for 13 years. Beirne is a member of Purdue's 100-year anniversary team and a 2004 inductee into Purdue Athletics Hall of Fame. ... Tight end Cliff Benson (1980-83) was a three-year starter who caught 117 passes for 1,546 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nDid you know?: Lundy dabbled in acting while a member of the Rams, making two appearances on \"Lost In Space\" in 1965 as \"The Giant\" and \"The Giant Cyclops.\"\n\nNo. 82\n\nThe pick: John Standeford\n\nStandeford finished his collegiate career as the all-time Big Ten Conference leader with 266 receptions and 3,788 receiving yards. As a junior, Standeford was a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award (presented to the nation's outstanding receiver), first team All-Big Ten selection and team Most Valuable Player after catching 75 passes for a school-record 1,307 yards and a school-record-tying 13 touchdowns.\n\nHe caught 77 passes for 1,150 yards and four touchdowns his senior season and was named second team All-Big Ten. Standeford was named a True Freshman All-American in 2000 as a member of Purdue's Rose Bowl team.\n\nHonorable mention: Pete Brewster (1949-51) was team MVP as a senior after making 16 catches for 208 yards and two touchdowns. He played nine years in the NFL, and was a two-time Pro Bowl end in 1955 and 1956 for the Cleveland Browns. Brewster was inducted into the Purdue Athletics Hall of Fame in 2007. ... Bob Dillingham (1966-68) led Purdue in receiving in 1968 with 35 passes for 456 yards and four touchdowns. ... Ashley Bell (1969-71) caught 11 touchdown passes as a sophomore in 1969. ... Defensive tackle David Nugent (1996-99) had 15 tackles for a loss as a senior.\n\nDid you know?: Standeford and Brian Alford are the only two players in school history with two 1,000-yard receiving seasons.\n\nNo. 83\n\nThe pick: Forest Farmer\n\nFarmer first made his name in the football world in 1960, when the sophomore end was selected United Press International's Offensive Player of the Week. He had four catches for 69 yards and a couple of sacks in Purdue's 23-14 upset of No. 1 Minnesota.\n\nFarmer was one of the standouts on a Boilermaker team that also defeated No. 3 Ohio State and No. 12 Notre Dame and fought No. 8 UCLA to a 27-27 tie en route to a 4-4-1 record.\n\nHe was a three-year starter and team co-captain in 1962.\n\nHonorable mention: Tight end Marion Griffin (1966-68) hauled in 38 passes for 439 yards and three touchdowns from Bob Griese and Mike Phipps in an era when the Boilermakers had numerous offensive options.\n\nNo. 84\n\nThe pick: Leo Sugar\n\nA consensus All-American defensive end and first-team All-Big Ten selection as a senior in 1951, Sugar went on to play nine seasons in the NFL with the Chicago/St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia and Detroit. He was a Pro Bowl selection in 1958 and 1960. Sugar was inducted into the Purdue Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nHonorable mention: Tom Franckhauser led Purdue in receiving in 1957-58. ... Tight end Marty Scott (1982-85) caught 103 passes for 1,247 yards and four touchdowns in his career. ... Randall Lane (1998-99) caught 18 of Drew Brees' record 55 completions in a 1998 loss at Wisconsin. In two seasons, Lane had 119 receptions for 1,630 yards and 12 touchdowns. ...

He was the anchor of the \"Junk Defense\" that helped Purdue compile a 19-4-1 record during his final two seasons.\n\nTurner played 11 seasons as an outside linebacker in the NFL, helping San Francisco win Super Bowls in 1981, 1984, 1988 and 1989. He was inducted into the Purdue Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nHonorable mention: Tight end Kyle Adams (2006-07, 2009-10) caught 79 passes for 660 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nDid you know?: Kenneth \"Pat\" McCaffry (1948-49) led Lafayette Jeff to an undefeated season in 1966 during a high school coaching career that earned him a place in the Indiana Football Hall of Fame.\n\nNo. 86\n\nThe pick: George Catavolos\n\nCatavolos was a three-year starting defensive back from 1964-66 who will be best remembered for his game-saving interception in the end zone that denied Southern California the go-ahead two-point conversion in the 1967 Rose Bowl.\n\nHonorable mention: Andy Gladstone (1980-83) was a three-year starter at outside linebacker/defensive end. ... John Kerr (1951-54) was a three-year starter at end, leading Purdue in receiving as a senior with 20 catches for 337 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nDid you know?: Catavolos and future Hall of Fame quarterback Bob Griese nearly drowned off the North Shore of Oahu while in Hawaii for the 1967 Hula Bowl. Locals pulled the duo from the Pacific Ocean before either were seriously injured.\n\nNo. 87\n\nThe pick: Bob DeMoss\n\nDeMoss' impact on Purdue football would cover four decades but this pick is strictly as a four-year starting quarterback from 1945-48. His numbers today don't jump off the page (2,759 yards, 23 TD passes) but college football in the 1940s wasn't known for the passing game like it is today.\n\nHe gained national fame as a freshman in 1945, guiding Purdue to a 35-13 victory at No. 4 Ohio State before 73,585 fans, the most ever to watch the Boilermakers at that time.\n\nHigh honorable mention: Bart Burrell (1977-80) was the epitome of a possession receiver for high school teammate Mark Herrmann. He caught 140 passes for 2,126 yards and 14 touchdowns). Burrell was a second-team All-Big Ten selection as a senior. ... Babe Dimancheff (1943-44) came to Purdue when Butler suspended its football program during World War II. He was part of a loaded backfield that helped the Boilermakers go 9-0 in 1943. As a senior, he led the league in scoring (54 points) and was a first-team All-Big Ten halfback. He is a member of the Indiana Football Hall of Fame and the Purdue Athletics Hall of Fame.\n\nDid you know?: Burrell was Purdue's first 1,000-yard receiver with 1,001 as a senior in 1980.\n\nNo. 88\n\nThe pick: Cecil Isbell\n\nCollege football was a different game in the 1930s, when Isbell showed off his passing ability for the Boilermakers from 1935-37. Technically a halfback, with his brother Cody as the quarterback in coach Noble Kizer's offense, Isbell drew national attention in 1938 after leading the College All-Stars to victory against the defending NFL champion Washington Redskins at Soldier Field in Chicago. Isbell was named the game's MVP.\n\nLong before Aaron Rodgers, Brett Favre and Bart Starr, Isbell was the first quarterback legend for the Green Bay Packers. A first-round draft pick, Isbell led the Packers to the 1939 NFL title and teamed up with Hall of Fame receiver Don Hutson to set NFL passing records in 1941 and 1942.\n\nAt the peak of his pro career, coming off a record 24 touchdown passes and 2,021 yards, Isbell retired to return to Purdue as an assistant coach. He took over as head coach in 1944 and went 14-14-1 before accepting the head coaching position with the Baltimore Colts.\n\nHonorable mention: Calvin Williams (1986-89) still ranks in Purdue's top 20 career list for receptions (138), yards (1,855) and receiving touchdowns (17). He then became a starter as a rookie for the Philadelphia Eagles in 1990 and set the team's rookie touchdown receptions mark with nine. Williams played seven season in the NFL, all but seven games with the Eagles.\n\nDid you know?: Isbell threw touchdown passes in his final 23 NFL games, setting a record that stood until Johnny Unitas broke it in 1957. Another famous Boilermaker, Drew Brees, eclipsed Unitas in 2012. Isbell's 23 consecutive games with a TD pass stood as a Packers record until 2003.\n\nNo. 89\n\nThe pick: Tim Stratton\n\nStratton had perfect timing in his college football career. He was a perfect fit in Joe Tiller's offense and had Drew Brees passing to him for three seasons.\n\nHe was also in the right place at the right time to win the first John Mackey Award as the nation's best tight end in 2000 after catching 58 passes for 605 yards and two touchdowns for the Big Ten champion Boilermakers.\n\nWhen he completed his eligibility in 2001, no Purdue football player had caught more passes (204). Stratton also is one of four Boilermakers to be selected first-team All-Big Ten three times.\n\nHonorable mention: Jermaine Ross (1990-93) was a two-year starter at wide receiver who parlayed his breakout senior season (31 receptions for 493 yards, 3 TDs) into a five-year NFL career, mostly with the Rams.\n\nDid you know?: Stratton arguably is one of the most colorful football players in Purdue history. He drew Tiller's ire after the upset of fifth-ranked Michigan in 2000 when he lost his helmet while celebrating with fans on the field.\n\nNo. 90\n\nThe pick: Ryan Baker\n\nThe four-star defensive tackle out of Chatard (2004-08) excelled in the classroom (a four-time Academic All-Big Ten selection) and on the field as a three-year starter.\n\nBaker played parts of four seasons with the Miami Dolphins as an undrafted free agent\n\n.Honorable mention: Bruce Gaston (2010-13) was a four-year starter at defensive tackle, recording seven tackles for loss as a senior."
