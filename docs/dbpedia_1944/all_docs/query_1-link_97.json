        "text": "BEAUMONT, Texas – Lamar University added 22 players on National Signing Day – 12 signees and 10 transfers (seven Division I transfers and three junior college) – announced head coach Pete Rossomando at a press conference Wednesday afternoon. With the 22 additions, it brings the Cardinals' 2023 signing class to 28 overall.\n\n\"I thought our staff did a great job of getting out there and 'beating the bushes' in our recruiting footprint, which we sort of created when I got here,\" said Rossomando. \"I think this class is pretty well-rounded and we hit all of our needs. Now it's just a matter of getting them here on campus and seeing if they can live up to their hype.\"\n\nThe 2023 class was weighted more on the defensive side of the ball with 14 additions, while eight are on offense. The position breakdown of the incoming class includes seven defensive linemen, five defensive backs, four offensive linemen, two quarterbacks, two linebackers, one running back and a receiver.\n\nWhen combined with the Early Signing Period additions, 19 of the Cardinals' 28 come on the defensive side of the ball with nine offensive players (including early signee Iyioluwa Adekoya who is currently listed as a tight end/defensive end).\n\n\"We had some immediate needs that we had to fill – with some guys leaving in the portal – we had to fill those positions in with some older guys via the portal to balance out the classes,\" said Rossomando. \"I think we did a great job of getting really high-quality individuals here and they're going to be really good players too. On the high school end, we took some guys we think can help us immediately. This is a balanced class.\"\n\nDespite a strong Texas flavor to the class, Rossomando and his staff stretched beyond the Lone Star State for the newest members of the roster. Of the 22, 14 call Texas home (including one from the Golden Triangle – Jah'mar Sanders), while three hail from Louisiana. The class also includes one player each from California, Florida, Iowa, Pennsylvania and Virginia.\n\nLU's coaching staff placed a focus on bulking up both sides of the ball with 11 additions coming on either the offensive or defensive front. The Cards four incoming offensive linemen average 6-3.5 and 288 pounds, while the defensive linemen come in averaging 6-3, 249 pounds.\n\n\"For starters, I'm a line guy,\" said Rossomando. \"So, we're going to build this thing from the inside out. If we say that, then we have to follow through with it in recruiting. I feel we did that in this signing class.\"\n\nThe coaching staff also added to the competition at quarterback with two additions – junior college transfer Robert Coleman and prep signee Aiden McCown. Coleman will have the obvious experience edge bringing two years of JUCO experience after passing for nearly 4,500 yards and 45 touchdowns at Mt. San Jacinto College.\n\n\"Robert is a junior college transfer who after we came in and saw him on film, we really felt like he fit what we want to do from a scheme standpoint,\" said Rossomando. \"Once we got to know him as a person, we realized this is a guy we need on our team because he's driven, hyper-competitive and will lead from the front. We've hit a mark with Robert.\"\n\nMcCown comes from a strong football bloodline being the son of former NFL signal caller, Josh McCown. Aiden is more than just the son of an NFL standout, a three-star prospect in his own right, McCown passed for 2,312 yards and 27 touchdowns during his first season of football. He also rushed for nearly 800 yards, while averaging 8.3 yards per carry.\n\n\"Aiden has only played quarterback one year at the high school level really, but we're excited about his ability,\" said Rossomando. \"He can certainly sit back in the pocket and read defenses; he's got a great understanding of schemes. We feel really good about his athleticism and the things he can do when plays break down. He played several other positions as well when he was a younger player. Aiden's best football is ahead of him.\"\n\n#WeAreLU\n\n2023 LU Football NSD Signee Bios\n\nBrenden Bradshaw – DB – 6-1 – 180 – Denton, Texas/Guyer HS\n\nHigh School: All-district safety … Guided
