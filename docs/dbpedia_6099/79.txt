Tommy Davidson is a Veteran in the Entertainment Industry, sustaining a 30 year career in film, television, and stand up comedy. He was one of the original cast members of the hit show "In Living Color," and went on to do movies such as "Booty Call" with Jamie Foxx, "Strictly Business" with Halle Berry, and "Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls" with Jim Carrey, to name a few. As a stand-up comedian, Tommy has been touring the country, as well as doing comedy overseas for American troops for decades, spreading laugher around the globe.

Tommy, along with his wife Amanda, sought a need to create fun, yet classic, men's accessories, at a price affordable to all.

Tongue in Cheek was born in 2015, after Amanda designed the logo backstage during one of Tommy's Stand-up comedy shows, with Tommy, of course, being the inspiration for the brand. Together with Tommy's decades of red carpet experience, they created a line of men's ties, pocket squares, and flower lapels, with their tagline being "Sharp with the Tongue, and Slick with the Tie."
