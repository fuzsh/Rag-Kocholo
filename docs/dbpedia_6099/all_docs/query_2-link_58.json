        "text": "I spoke with the triple threat legend himself, Tommy Davidson! Excited to hear about his new song “I Know” that is available on all platforms and his relationship with music.\n\nCox: Tommy Davidson you have many talents; comedy, acting and singing. How do you do it all and where does it come from?\n\nDavidson: I’m going to just sum it up as a gift. It’s been something that I’ve always loved. Every aspect of entertainment; movies, television, commercials, you name it! I grew up with music and somewhere in my younger adulthood I found out what to do with it. And that’s where it all comes in. You know I started out as a stand-up comedian then went into television and then movies. I actually started out as a singer as a little kid. Thirty-five years later I get to go back to singing.\n\nCox: Thirty-five years later you are now exploring your passion and career in singing. How have you been able to get others to buy into it? To work with you and take it seriously? Especially writers and producers since who knows you for acting and comedy.\n\nDavidson: It was a simple transition because I’ve been singing in my comedy for years. My versatility is a known fact. So it doesn’t really surprise my audience. If you know my comedy, you know my music. Music is a whole other industry so I thank God for some people who came along the way who tested it out for me such as Eddie Murphy and Jamie Foxx.\n\nTommy went on further to explain how he waited for the right time. Timing is about patience and precision and he wanted to make sure it was going to be a time where he could express his music in a way that was genuine and authentic.\n\n“I knew that I could do whatever type of music but I wanted to start somewhere that felt most comfortable and natural.”\n\nCox: Please elaborate on why focus in your career is equally important as timing?\n\nDavidson: I have accomplished a lot of things at the highest level. So it’s about what kind of focus I’m going to have. I will not do something if it won’t have 100% of my focus. There is the saying you can’t have your cake and eat it too. You can actually have your cake and eat it too but that’s going to be a messy ass kitchen.\n\nCox: Now that’s funny I never thought of it like that.\n\nDavidson. Yes, because you will have frosting over there, eating it as you go while the cake is coming out, so it’s going to be a messy ass kitchen.\n\nCox: Now let’s get into your music, who influences you?\n\nDavidson: Luther Vandross, Peabo Bryson, The Jackson 5, Michael Jackson, Switch, and Cameo have influenced me. The list goes on.\n\nCox: How would you describe the sounds on your latest single “I Know.”\n\nDavidson: It’s partly soul and partly smooth jazz. It’s a nice, good and even component of me.\n\nI Know is one of those songs if you, like me, are an 80s baby who will feel very reminiscent of those nights or early mornings where your parents are playing something smooth. It’s very balanced between my voice, the beats and the instrumentals. I caught myself pretending to play the saxophone just like it when I was a kid. I promise you that once you listen to it you’ll instantly get into a good mood. It’s that ‘feel good music’ you desire that puts a smile on your face while you groove your head and body.\n\nCox: So what’s next, should we expect an album or just more EPs?\n\nDavidson: This song with the first release of my first single Sweet Reunion are both part of the entire album. I wanted to do something different where you will get a couple singles out so you know which songs you like and connect with. Then when the album does drop you have your favorites and then you get two or three surprise songs you haven’t heard."
