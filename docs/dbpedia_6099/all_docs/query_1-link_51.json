Ben has always said “yes” to opportunities, and his “I’ll try anything once” attitude has ultimately lead to some hilarious stories and an irrationally high 26 different jobs since he turned 16. Ben has done everything from work a drive-thru at Chick-fil-A to drive a bus for the YMCA after school program, and now he takes the stage to tell all about everything he’s done and seen and make you laugh along the way.\n\nStanding at only 5’5 and weighing in at 125 lbs, Ben is not an intimidating presence, but don’t let his size fool you!

Tom’s is the author of the book Mean Dad’s For A Better America: The Generous Rewards Of An Old-Fashioned Childhood. He also sells-out theaters nationwide, touring alongside Greg Gutfeld.\n\nABOUT SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION:\n\nWe all tell stories about our life. But did you ever get used to telling a story a certain way, and then come across some surprising new information that changes the ending?\n\nIn his previous solo shows Impossible at the Edinburg Fringe, and Supernormal at PS 122, and in his book Mean Dads for a Better America, Tom told funny stories about his childhood growing up in Massachusetts and his disciplinarian “Mean Dad.” In his newest show Spontaneous Combustion, Tom adds depth and insight into these funny stories while solving some long-hidden family mysteries.\n\nAfter her death in the spring of 2022, Tom was at his mother’s home with his siblings going through photographs, jewelry, and heirlooms, including boxes of his mother’s artwork, and a treasure-trove of his father’s poetry and prose, untouched since his death in 2019. These finds changed the ending of some of Tom’s favorite family stories, like the puzzling “spontaneous combustion” of the Shillue family car in the 1970’s, and the secret behind his dad’s sudden transformation from “Mean Dad” to “Mellow Dad” in the fall of 1985.\n\nIn addition to the two-item minimum, there will be an 18% administrative fee in the showroom.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nAfter embarking on a sold out world tour last year, multi-platform internet sensation Lyle Forever brings his beloved Therapy Gecko live show on the road again in 2024.
