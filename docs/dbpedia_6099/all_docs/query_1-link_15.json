        "text": "Davidson’s hilarious impressions of Sammy Davis Jr., Michael Jackson and other icons have become infamous. His visibility on In Living Color led to three Showtime specials: On Strength of New York, Illin’ in Philly and Takin’ it to DC. Tommy is the host and star of Showtime’s 2013 Chocolate Sundaes special (eOne) which garnered rave reviews upon premiere and remains one of eOne Film’s best sellers.\n\nHis elasticity as a performer who delivers on both the big and small screen led to other opportunities including the host of FOX’s The NFL Show and as the star of Will Smith’s animated series, Youngin’s and Disney’s animated series, The Proud Family.\n\nHe also scored big with reviewers and audiences alike opposite Michael Jai White in the critically-lauded spoof comedy, Black Dynamite (Sony Pictures) as the character ‘Cream Corn.’ The cult hit was adapted as an animated series for Adult Swim, becoming a breakout hit and was just ordered for a second season. It continues to garner the highest ratings the Cartoon Network has ever experienced.\n\nNext up on the feature film front is the adaptation of lauded biographical novel, “Deconstructing Sammy,” the extraordinary story of an international celebrity whose outsize talent couldn’t save him from himself, in which Tommy will not only will produce but star in as the iconic Sammy Davis Jr..\n\nCurrently Tommy is touring across the country on his comedy tour and has also joined forces with Sommore, Bill Bellamy, and Tony Rock for the Standing Ovation Tour. Recently Tommy was a celebrity guest on Food Network’s successful competition cooking show Chopped for their special series Tournament of the Stars where he wore his old chef hat to win $50,000 to his charity."
