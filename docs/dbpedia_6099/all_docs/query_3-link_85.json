        "text": "Tommy Davidson has a decidedly mechanical-sounding strategy for keeping his energy up during shows.\n\n“I’m like a computer,” said the comedian, who plays the Denver Improv through Nov. 3. “I boot down and always use the couple hours before to do absolutely nothing but sleep. I expend so much energy doing these shows that I need it. It’s my ritual.”\n\nIt’s all the more impressive that Davidson has maintained that wild physicality since his early days on the 1990s sketch show “In Living Color,” where competing for attention was no easy task.\n\n“In Living Color” cast members and future stars Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx and the Wayans brothers offered cartoonish, scathingly satirical characters that exploded racial stereotypes from the inside out. Like the later “MadTV,” “In Living Color” practically reached out of the screen and smacked viewers silly with its unrelenting madness.\n\nAnd Davidson matched that intensity. The skinny, loose-limbed comic went for broke on nearly every sketch, from impressions of Michael Jackson and Sugar Ray Leonard to outlandish characters like the martial arts-loving, heavily afro’d Sweet Tooth Jones.\n\n“I’ve worked with all of (the cast) doing stand-up over the years and everybody would love to see a reunion happen, but it’s just a matter of pulling it together,” Davidson said. “If it was up to me it would already be done.”\n\nDavidson has lately channeled his energy into his touring stand-up act and a biopic of Sammy Davis, Jr. — a performer he came to relatively late but grew fascinated with over time.\n\n“I didn’t pay much attention to him at first because I was into the Jackson 5 and other music,” said the 49-year-old Davidson — who also happens to do a spot-on Davis impression.\n\n“But I started gravitating toward him more when I realized he really broke the color barrier in the entertainment business. I mean, his career spans from the later days in vaudeville through the chitlin’ circuit and the Rat Pack all the way up to the ’80s. That’s a long, long time.”\n\nThe film remains in the early stages of development, but Davidson hasn’t been waiting around. His decades-long list of movie and TV projects has recently included hosting Showtime’s “Chocolate Sundaes Comedy Show” and return to voice work on Adult Swim’s animated series “Black Dynamite” — a blaxploitation spoof based on the 2009 live-action film of the same name.\n\n“Voice acting’s a whole other skill, and I’ve gotten really good at it because I’ve been doing it for 22 years,” he said. “I become clay. I just listen to what they want from me and then I give them my interpretation of that.”\n\nIt’s tempting to project that onto all of Davidson’s projects, given his seemingly eager-to-please persona. But like a lot of comedic actors, he always returns to stand-up.\n\n“It’s the backbone. Other things get added as I go up the ladder in the business and I’m brought on to direct or whatever else. But stand-up is something a lot of people can’t do, so it makes you the different one in the room. It opens up a whole other set of possibilities.”\n\nFollow our news and updates on Twitter, our relationship status on Facebook and our search history on Google +.
