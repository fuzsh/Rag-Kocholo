        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. – Much of America was introduced to Tommy Davidson as one of the original cast members of the sketch comedy show “In Living Color.”\n\nHe has since had a wildly successful career which includes acting, writing and composing music.\n\nNow he is bringing all of that experience to the stage at Improv Orlando on I-Drive.\n\nHe said he loves being able to make people laugh in person.\n\n“You can actually come and see me and hear me without a commercial interrupting the experience, because our world now is in the palm of our hand, our phone,” Davidson said.\n\n[EXCLUSIVE: Become a News 6 Insider (it’s FREE) | PINIT! Share your photos]\n\nDavidson said he loves performing in Orlando because the city is so diverse.\n\n“I just like that it is plentiful culturally, my material falls easy on those ears. In different parts of the country, I have to think harder about how I am going to get my message across and that’s that we are all the same,” he said.\n\nWhen people experience his performance, he said he wants them to come away feeling lighter and inspired.\n\n“My purpose is to instill a sense of purpose in others, no matter what that may be,” Davidson said.\n\nYou can buy tickets to Davidson’s show by clicking here. He is performing Friday, Jan. 5, at 7:30 p.m. and 10:00 p.m., as well as on Saturday, Jan. 6, at 7:00 p.m. and 9:45 p.m.\n\nWatch our interview with him in the video player at the top of this story."
