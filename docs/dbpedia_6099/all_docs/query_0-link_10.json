        "text": "Tommy Davidson’s exceptional range – from stand-up comedy and acting to versatile music accomplishments – have earned him a reputation as an extraordinary performer. Best known as one of the stars of the hit television show In Living Color, his visibility has allowed him to become a household name known for his innovative talent.\n\nDavidson started his career as a standup comedian in Washington DC, earning an ardent following. Spotted by major concert promoters, he was first booked as the opening act for Patti LaBelle, Kenny G and Luther Vandross. It wasn’t long before he came to Hollywood and was headlining the biggest rooms and met Robert Townsend. This led to his first national tv appearance and starring role in Partners in Crime, the conduit to Keenan Ivory Wayans, who proved instrumental in Davidson’s career by offering him an opportunity to audition.\n\nTommy and Jamie Foxx, Jim Carrey, Damon Wayans and David Alan Grier — the uniquely talented cast of the most adventurous primetime variety show on television, In Living Color (1990), made TV history. The iconic sketch show was honored with the ‘Groundbreaking Award” by TV Land in a star-studded salute on its 25th anniversary and will be touted this April ’19 at Tribeca FF with another major award.\n\nTommy’s film debut started opposite Halle Berry in Strictly Business. A range of feature film roles from Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, where he received acclaim and praise for his turn as “Womack/Sleep ‘N Eats,” to Juwanna Mann (Morgan Creek) and the pivotal cameo in Jim Carrey’s Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls, followed. He starred in the 2017 landmark, award-winning documentary, I Am Comic, opposite Tim Allen, Lewis Black and in the feature doc, Dying Laughing (2018), alongside Jamie Foxx, Kevin Hart, Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman.\n\nDavidson’s hilarious impressions of Sammy Davis Jr., Michael Jackson and other icons have become infamous. His visibility on In Living Color led to three Showtime specials: On Strength of New York, Illin’ in Philly and Takin’ it to DC. Tommy hosted and starred in Showtime’s hugely popular Chocolate Sundaes special which garnered rave reviews and incredible sales. He just guest starred on season 2 of Showtime’s critically lauded hit series, Jim Carrey’s “I’m Dying Up Here.”\n\nHis elasticity as a performer is seen on the small screen with standout guests stints ranging from BET’s Real Husbands of Hollywood opposite Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon to his hosting the hit series, Vacation Creation (ABC) for three seasons. As a voice artist, America fell in love with Tommy as the star of Will Smith’s animated series, Youngin’s, Disney’s animated series, The Proud Family and alongside Michael Jai White in the critically-lauded spoof comedy, Black Dynamite (Adult Swim) as the character ‘Cream Corn.’\n\nTommy’s long awaited autobiography, Living In Color: What’s Funny About Me (Kensington Books) is due January 28, 2020 with a myriad of key events planned around its anticipated release..\n\nTommy’s stand up dates always sell out. He currently headlines “Off Color Comedy Tour” with Keenan Ivory Wayans, Shawn Wayans and David Alan Grier prompting all to ask,” Is ILC coming back?”"
