        "text": "American actor and comedian\n\nFor other people named Thomas Davidson, see Thomas Davidson (disambiguation).\n\nTommy Davidson (born November 10, 1963) is an American actor and comedian.[2] He was an original cast member on the sketch comedy TV show In Living Color, Mitchell on Between Brothers (1997–1999), Dexter on Malcolm & Eddie (1999–2000), Oscar Proud on The Proud Family (2001–2005) and its 2022 revival, Rushon in Booty Call (1997), Womack in Bamboozled (2000), and Cream Corn in Black Dynamite (2009) and its subsequent television series. In 2022, Davidson appeared on Storybound reading from his book, Living in Color: What's Funny about Me.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn Anthony Reed in Rolling Fork, Mississippi,[1][3] Davidson was abandoned in the trash at 18 months old, before being rescued by a white woman who became his adoptive mother.[4][5] His parents changed his name to Thomas Davidson when they adopted him.[1] He has two older white siblings, Michael and Beryle. He and his family had moved from Colorado to Wyoming to Oregon by the time he was five years old.[6]\n\nHis parents divorced when he was five years old, and his mother and the children moved to Washington, D.C.[1] They later moved to Wheaton, Maryland, then the neighborhood of Rosemary Hills in Silver Spring, and then Takoma Park.[1][4] He attended Rosemary Hills Elementary School, Sligo Middle School, and Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School, in Bethesda, Maryland.[1][4] After graduating in 1981,[4] he studied communications and interned at the radio station of the University of the District of Columbia for one semester.[7] He had jobs in the kitchen of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, cleaning at Roy Rogers, bussing tables at an IHOP in Wheaton, and working in the stockroom of Hechinger in Hyattsville, Maryland.[1][4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nDavidson started his career as a stand-up comedian in 1984,[8] when a childhood friend convinced him to perform stand-up at The Penthouse strip club in Park View, Washington, D.C.[4][9] He continued performing in various comedy clubs throughout the Washington Metropolitan region, Baltimore, and Philadelphia. He opened concerts for Patti LaBelle, Starpoint, and Kenny G.[10] He performed on a fundraising telethon for WHMM in 1987.[11]\n\nDavidson won an amateur stand-up competition at the Apollo Theater in 1987.[4] Soon afterwards, he moved to North Hollywood, California, where he met Martin Lawrence, who lived in his building.[4][12] He performed at the Comedy Store, where Robert Townsend heard of him and asked him to be the warm-up comic for an HBO special.[4] After performing at Luther Vandross and Anita Baker shows, he appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show.[4]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nDavidson and his wife Amanda Moore have been married since 2015, together they have two children.[13]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1991 Strictly Business Bobby 1993 CB4 Weird Warren 1995 Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls The Tiny Warrior 1997 Booty Call Rushon Plump Fiction Julius 1998 Woo Tim 1999 Pros & Cons Ron Carter 2000 Bamboozled Womack / Sleep'n Eat 2002 Juwanna Mann Puff Smokey Smoke 2004 Funky Monkey Harland 2009 Black Dynamite Cream Corn 2011 Dance Fu Addict 2012 Who Killed Soul Glow - 2018 Fury of the Fist and the Golden Fleece Homeless Comic Frat Pack Big Daddy 2021 Miracles Across 125th Street - 2023 Outlaw Johnny Black Clancy\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1989 CBS Summer Playhouse Prince Tariq Episode: \"Coming to America\" 1990-94 In Living Color Himself/Cast Member Main cast 1992 Roc Donald Episode: \"The Hand That Rocs the Cradle\" 1993 The Commish Reese Episode: \"Rising Sun\" Martin Varnel Hill Episode: \"Hollywood Swinging Parts 1 & 2\" A Cool Like That Christmas Orlando Voice, television film 1994 Just for Laughs Himself Episode: \"Episode #9.1\" Duckman Marvin Voice, episode: \"Joking the Chicken\" 1995 Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child Jester Voice, episode: \"The Frog Prince\" 1996 The Ren & Stimpy Show Sammy Mantis Voice, episode: \"Sammy and Me\" 1997 MADTv Himself/Host Episode: \"Episode #2.14\" Space Ghost Coast to Coast Himself Episode: \"Pavement\" Boston Common Darrell Episode: \"Soup to Nuts\" 1997–99 Between Brothers Mitchell Ford Main cast 1999 All That Himself Episode: \"All That Live!
