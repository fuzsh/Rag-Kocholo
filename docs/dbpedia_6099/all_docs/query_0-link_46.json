A range of feature film roles from Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, where he received acclaim and praise for his turn as “Womack/Sleep ‘N Eats,” to Juwanna Mann (Morgan Creek) and the pivotal cameo in Jim Carrey’s Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls, followed. Recently, he starred in the landmark, award-winning documentary, I Am Comic, opposite Tim Allen, Lewis Black and in the feature doc, Dying Laughing, alongside Jamie Foxx, Kevin Hart, Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman.His elasticity as a performer is seen on the small screen with standout guest stints ranging from MTV’s Wild n’ Out with Nick Cannon, BET's Real Husbands of Hollywood opposite Kevin Hart, to ABC’s Celebrity Wife Swap.
