        "text": "Corey Bonalewicz, aka COREY B, is an American radio personality, comedian, and content creator based in New York. Corey B has been working in Radio for over ten years. He got his start in New Orleans and has hosted radio shows in Chicago and New York. Prior to the pandemic, Corey performed stand up in the New York comedy club circuit and was planning on touring. Corey shifted his focus to long form content during the pandemic which showcased his comedic style on top of food hacks. He has amassed over 9M followers on TikTok and almost 6M followers on Facebook. He is releasing his own BBQ sauce and has equity in a New York restaurant and cookie company. Corey co-hosts a podcast, Cane and Corey, which is currently behind a paywall. He had a family YouTube page with his fiancé, The B Family, with a decent following but stopped posting due to restrictions on videos with children in them. Corey would like to dive back into YouTube and build upon this audience with a Corey B Reacts and Corey B Reviews page.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nFrom within the bustling heart of the Windy City, a comedian named Hannibal Buress embarked upon his journey. The year was 2002, the location, the Big Muddy Room at Southern Illinois University. Guided by the wisdom of his friend Chidi and sharpened in the fires of Tony Trimm's \"Sunday School sessions,\" young Buress was prepared to take the comedy world by storm.\n\nIn 2006, he emerged from the shadows, performing at Montreal's 'Just for Laughs' New Faces, an event that led to his first international appearance on \"Late Night with Jörgen Raymann\" in Holland. From that moment, he continued to grow, creating a series of successful stand-up specials including \"Animal Furnace,\" \"Live From Chicago,\" \"Hannibal Takes Edinburgh,\" \"Comedy Camisado,\" and \"Miami Nights\".\n\nFate intervened in 2009, when a last-minute booking on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" led to a meeting with Seth Meyers. This encounter gave him the opportunity to write for the legendary show \"Saturday Night Live.\" It was there, my young turtles, where Buress had one sketch air – a moment he credits to the creativity of his cousin Percy. He cherishes the memory of watching Rihanna uttering his lines in the \"Shy Ronnie\" sketch.

He is a regular at The Comedy Cellar, The Stand Comedy Club and Stand Up New York. A staple in the New York Comedy Podcast scene he can be heard on The Legion of Skanks, You Know What Dude, Are You Garbage? and Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast. He launched The Colum Tyrrell Podcast in 2022 which is growing to be one of the more popular shows in New York and he recently made his television debut on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nAuthor, columnist, and comedian Steve Hofstetter is often called the hardest working man in show-business. With all due respect to the late James Brown.\n\nHofstetter's national TV debut came on ESPN's Quite Frankly, where Stephen A. Smith yelled at him for three minutes. Hofstetter has also appeared on CBS' \"Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson\", Showtime's \"White Boyz in the Hood\", VH1's \"Countdown\", Sundance's \"On the Road in America\", and ABC's \"Barbara Walter's Special\", where he thankfully did not cry. He is the host and executive producer of \"Laughs\" on Fox networks, where he only cries occasionally.\n\nOne of the top booked acts on the college circuit, the original writer for collegehumor.com has also released six albums. Hofstetter has written humor columns for the New York Times, SportsIllustrated.com, and NHL.com, where he publicly admitted to being a Ranger fan.\n\nAfter hosting Four Quotas on Sirius Satellite Radio for two seasons, Hofstetter moved to broadcast radio, and his Sports Minute (Or So) was syndicated on over 170 stations and in over 30 newspapers. Hofstetter's second live comedy album (\"Cure For the Cable Guy\") reached #20 on Billboard's comedy charts. His third album (\"Dark Side of the Room\") was the first ever pay-what-you-want\" comedy album, since people were going to steal it anyway. His fourth album consisted of an hour of 100% ad-libbed material, which is, frankly, nuts. And his fifth album hit #1 on iTunes' comedy charts, which is also a bit nuts.\n\nHofstetter's brutal tour schedule consists of over 100 colleges and dozens of clubs every year, and is fueled by an immense online popularity, tons of press, and a Prius with great gas mileage. He reached 200,000 friends on Facebook (still the world record), 400,000 more on MySpace, and high shelves in grocery stores.\n\nWhile Hofstetter's live shows are routinely sold out, he is best known for his writing, first published at age 15, mainly to impress girls. At 18, he co-founded \"Sports Jerk of the Week\", an irreverent website featured by press like USA Today's Baseball Weekly, Sports Illustrated and CNN. And at 20, Hofstetter took a year off of school to head up web content for the New York Yankees. The Yankees won the World Series that year, which would have been wonderful if they hadn't beaten Hofstetter's Mets. Yes, he's also a Mets fan. Poor kid.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Columbia University, Hofstetter was a well-read columnist for the Columbia Daily Spectator and a voice of the Lions. After a summer writing for Maxim, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated for Kids, Hofstetter syndicated his column in several newspapers.\n\nWithout his glasses, Hofstetter also looks a great deal like Michael Rappaport.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons."
