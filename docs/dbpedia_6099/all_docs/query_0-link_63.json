        "text": "Tommy Davidson’s exceptional range – from stand-up comedy and acting to versatile music accomplishments – have earned him a reputation as an extraordinary performer who delivers no matter the arena. Best known as one of the stars of the hit television show In Living Color, Davidson’s visibility has allowed him to become a household name known for his innovative talent.\n\nDavidson started his career as a standup comedian in Washington DC, earning an ardent following. Spotted by major concert promoters, he was first booked as the opening act for Patti LaBelle, Kenny G and Luther Vandross. It wasn’t long before he came to Hollywood and was headlining the biggest rooms and met Robert Townsend. This led to his first national tv appearance and starring role in Partners in Crime, the conduit to Keenan Ivory Wayans, who proved instrumental in Davidson’s career by offering him an opportunity to audition.\n\nDavidson starred in Disney Channel’s beloved animated series The Proud Family (2001-05) and recently returned to topline their new hit, “The Proud Family: Louder and Prouder” (Disney +) to rave reviews. Other 2022 guest starring credits include CBS comedy series The Neighborhood; standout roles on VH1’s hit A Black Lady Sketch Show; the Nick Cannon-directed TV movie Miracles Across 125th Street, BET+’s The Ms. Pat Show and the Netflix special Sarah Cooper: Everything’s Fine.\n\nThe multihyphenate is perhaps best known for starring in the groundbreaking sketch comedy series In Living Color and becoming a standout with his impressions of Sammy Davis Jr., Michael Jackson and other entertainment icons. His performance on the series resulted in three Showtime specials: On Strength of New York, Illin’ in Philly, and Takin’ it to DC. Davidson also hosted and starred in the network’s Chocolate Sundaes Comedy Show, as well as three seasons of ABC’s Vacation Creation.\n\nDavidson voiced the series regular role of Cream Corn in the Adult Swim action-comedy spoof Black Dynamite, and has also made multiple guest appearances on shows like MTV’s Wild ‘N Out, BET’s Real Husbands of Hollywood and ABC’s Celebrity Wife Swap. He also recently headlined The Off Color Comedy Tour with Keenan Ivory Wayans, Shawn Wayans and David Alan Grier, and co-headlines with Katt Williams, Mike Epps and Martin Lawrence to sell out large venue audiences.\n\nDavidson’s feature credits include Spike Lee’s Bamboozled, Morgan Creek’s Juwanna Mann, Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls opposite Jim Carrey, and Strictly Business opposite Halle Berry among others. He also recently starred in the feature documentaries I Am Comic opposite Tim Allen and Lewis Black, and Dying Laughing alongside Jamie Foxx, Kevin Hart, Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman.\n\nHis most recent critically lauded music duets include Sweet Reunion with multi-Grammy winner Dave Koz and I Know with A-list saxophonist, Richard Elliot."
