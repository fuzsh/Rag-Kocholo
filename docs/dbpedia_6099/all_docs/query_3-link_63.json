        "text": "Comedian Tommy Davidson is bringing his signature wit and satire to the stage at Visani Italian Steakhouse Comedy Theater on Friday and Saturday, May 31 and June 1.\n\nThe stand-up comedian is known for his radical style of anecdotes and impressions. His breakout role was in the hit show “In Living Color.” The 90s television series featured humorous sketches portrayed through the cast, including celebrities like the Wayans brothers, Jim Carrey and Jennifer Lopez.\n\n“TV is an entirely different category. It was wonderful and I learned from the best. It all came out of that experience,” Davidson said about his work on “In Living Color.”\n\n“I have been to Florida and Port Charlotte before. It is a nice little area. I am excited to hang out, relax, and enjoy seafood, “ Davidson said.\n\n“Every performance I look forward to seeing the people and knowing I have a purpose with what I do. I can make a difference in how people feel. I never get bored of it, just to have all different types of people together and give my point of view on something and they laugh and accept it is mind-blowing!” said Davidson. “The past 15 years, the reactions were ‘ohh ahh,’ and I was never that kind of guy. I am more of a ‘ha-ha-ha-ha’ kind of guy, with harder laughing and more edge.”\n\nDavidson will perform at the Visani Italian Steakhouse Comedy Theater on Friday, May 31 and Saturday, June 1.\n\nHe will grab the mic for an hour-long stand-up show. The venue holds about 200 seats and offers nearly 100 food and drink choices.\n\n“The food at the club is really good. It is authentic Italian. They come in and ask, ‘Do you want a ribeye?’ And I am like, ‘Oh, yes, I do!’” said Davidson.\n\nDavidson usually sells out his shows. He’s traveled nationally and internationally, with nearly 200 shows booked annually, including performances at Jazz Festivals and Military bases. Davidson has also added jazz songs to his body of work, which includes collaborations with renowned performers. He has worked in partnership with saxophonist Richard Elliot and multi-Grammy winner Dave Koz. Davidson’s newest single, “Kid Zero,” has rocketed up the charts and was added to SiriusXM’s #1 Jazz Channel.\n\n“I just started with the jazz music; it soothes the soul, and I really can live with that. Listening to it while I cook, clean, and drive. It helps inspire me to think positively,” he said. “I am enjoying everything I do, and that is important!”\n\nDavidson was a celebrity guest on “Worst Cooks in America, Celebrity Recruit” during season nine.\n\nDavidson joked, “At one point, you got to make something original. I dreamed of this cake with peanut butter, like a Reece’s, that is hot and cold. I called it ‘Dream Cake.’ I finished it, and they were all like, ‘so you just made a cake?’”\n\nThe comedian is also known for voice acting. You can hear him on the Disney Channel’s “Proud Family” along with other hit television shows, including “Ren & Stimpy,” “Black Dynamite,” and celebrity reality shows like “Real Husbands of Hollywood.”\n\nDavidson starred in feature documentaries, including “I Am Comic” and “Dying Laughing” alongside Jamie Foxx, Kevin Hart and Amy Schumer.\n\n“I once beat Michael Jordan in poker, and he tried to come back with a game of pool. I told him, ‘he dunks basketballs, and I dunk minds!’” said Davidson. “Come out, enjoy some great food, and have some fun! Experience an hour with my mind! ¦\n\nIn the KNOW\n\nComedian Tommy Davidson\n\n· Where: Visani Italian Steakhouse Comedy Theater, 2400 Kings Highway, Port Charlotte\n\n• When: Friday, May 31 and Saturday, June 1\n\n• Times: Friday shows 7 and 10 p.m., Saturday shows are 6 and 9:30 p.m."
