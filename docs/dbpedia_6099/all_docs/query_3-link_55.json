        "text": "On Saturday, March 31,2012, the Silver Spring (MD) Alumni chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc. will host the Kappa Komedy Showcase featuring well known comedian Tommy Davidson. The other comedians are Tyler Craig, Tony Woods and Neemah Williams. This will surely be an entertaining night. Click this link To learn more information about the show and how you may purchase tickets.\n\nAbout Tommy Davidson (taken from Wikipedia)\n\nDavidson started his career as a stand-up comedian in the mid 1980s, performing in various comedy clubs throughout the Washington Metropolitan region, Baltimore and Philadelphia. His first major exposure came on the variety show In Living Color, where he played various characters, including his impersonations of Sammy Davis, Jr. and Sugar Ray Leonard, and being the victim of Homey D. Clown.\n\nIn 1991, he released Illin in Philly, a VHS tape of a stand-up performance, which was aired regularly on Comedy Central in the 1990s, and “On The Strength”, another stand-up performance, this time filmed in New York City. He has also appeared in the films Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, Strictly Business, Booty Call and Juwanna Mann. In 1998, he had a plantar wart removed from his left foot. The wart, described by Davidson as painful, was not serious.\n\nDavidson provided the voice for “Oscar Proud,” the father in the Disney animated series The Proud Family. He was also a recurring character on MADtv’s Real M*****F***ing Talk sketches. In an episode of Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham, Davidson hosted the show with amateur acts trying to make names for themselves. He was also a guest on an episode of Cartoon Network’s animated/live action talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast.\n\nMore recently, Tommy Davidson played the role of Cream Corn in Black Dynamite and has currently finished production on a full length feature with childhood friend and current roommate Steve Kuflik called Black Scabbith."
