        "text": "Though his name is not well known, Tommy Davidson is hardly obscure. The U.S. impressionist and comedic actor first gained notice on the ground-breaking variety show In Living Color, and has gone on to a build a successful following for his live shows while popping up regularly in feature films - Ace Ventura II, Booty Call, Black Dynamite, Juwanna Mann and Bamboozled. Davidson, who appears at the George Weston Recital Hall on Sunday, talks about stereotypes and his own versatility.\n\nDoes Toronto have a reputation, among comedians?\n\nI don't know. I kind of live in a vacuum. I don't have time to talk to other comedians - I do my own thing.\n\nWhat is your thing?\n\nI'd say I'm every comedian wrapped in one, probably. I do a little bit of what everybody does. I can do improv, satire, political stuff, impressions.\n\nI thought you were excellent in Spike Lee's Bamboozled. Why didn't that lead to more serious roles for you?\n\nNobody got to see it. That was the problem with that movie - it wasn't seen. But the opportunities will come. I've proven I can do a role like that when I need to.\n\nWhen you look at the recent movie Cop Out, with Bruce Willis and Tracey Morgan, it seems like a casting clich√©, with the black comedic sidekick.\n\nLike 48 Hours? Yeah, the film industry still sees the white male machismo thing as superior to the black male machismo. Every movie like that sees the black actor as the funny guy, and less tough and less smart.\n\nBamboozled addressed some of those Hollywood stereotypes.\n\nI think that's still floating around. That was the importance of Bamboozled. It was so on the money when it came to that.\n\nTommy Davidson plays the George Weston Recital Hall, at the Toronto Centre for the Arts, Sunday April 18, 8 p.m., 7 p.m. $30, 416-870-8000."
