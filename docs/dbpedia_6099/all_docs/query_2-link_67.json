        "text": "Actor-comedian Tommy Davidson’s One/Song Studios — a subsidiary of IBE/song Entertainment has acquired the scripted series “Dream Weaver” from Maureen Martin and Delaina Dixon. The writing team was selected as Distinguished writers at the 2018 New York Television Festival for their comedic pilot “All about Eve.” Davidson, who will produce and star in a pivotal role, is focused on elevating black culture through black female voices.\n\n“Dream Weaver” chronicles the life and loves of a celebrity hairstylist in the world of Los Angeles, who teases the manes of the city’s richest and most powerful players while juggling love, lust, deception … and impossible to book hair appointments. The first six episodes are set to be shot in Los Angeles.\n\n“Our writing is primarily focused on family, workplace and romance with relatable characters, living their best lives,” says Martin. “Our background in the newsroom, fashion industry, entertainment journalism, public relations and corporate America has given us years of ample material that is both hilarious and touching. We’ll be amplifying the voices of black female professionals and how they navigate the worlds they inhabit” Adds Dixon, “I am so excited about working with the multitalented Tommy Davidson who has been making us laugh since his ‘In Living Color’ days. We are truly honored to partner with such amazing talent.”\n\nProduction is set to start in Fall 2021.\n\nTommy Davidson Actor, Comedian, Writer, and Producer\n\nTommy Davidson’s exceptional range of stand-up comedy and acting to versatile music ability has earned him a reputation as an extraordinary performer. Best known as one of the original stars of the hit television show “In Living Color,” Tommy’s visibility increased rapidly and he became widely known for his innovative talent.\n\nTommy’s impressive film debut was opposite Halle Berry in “Strictly Business.” His credits include numerous feature film roles from Spike Lee’s “Bamboozled” where he received acclaim and praise for his turn as Womack/Sleep N Eats to “Juwanna Mann” (Morgan Creek Productions’) and the pivotal cameo in Jim Carrey’s “Ace Ventura II: When Nature Calls” which has become a cult favorite.\n\nDavidson’s hilarious impressions of Sammy Davis Jr. Michael Jackson and other icons have become infamous. His visibility on “In Living Color” led to three Showtime specials: “On Strength In N.Y.C,” “Illin’ in Philly” and “Takin’ it to DC.” His elasticity as a performer who delivers on both the big and small screen led to other projects like the lead in the Disney animated series “The Proud Family” and as a host on FOX’s “The NFL Show” alongside football greats Michael Irvin and Tony Siragusa. Davidson also portrays the lead in Will Smith’s up-and-coming animated series “Youngin’s.”\n\nDelaina Dixon is a respected entertainment journalist who was a featured writer and host of VH1’s entertainment news series “The Gossip Table” for five seasons. She currently serves as a co-host on “Naughty But Nice with Rob Shuter” (iHeartRadio). She has served as senior editor for TV Guide.com, line editor of MTONews.com and co-founded the lifestyle site DivaGalsDaily.com. Her comedic series “All About Eve,” based on her experiences in celebrity journalism, was featured on NY Post’s infamous “Page Six” column in summer 2020."
