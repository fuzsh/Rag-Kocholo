SmartFocus and Infor, a leading provider of business management solutions, have announced their partnership. SmartFocus will make its email platform available to the Infor Epiphany suite. This partnership will allow Infor customers to benefit from SmartFocus' experience in email marketing.

Statement from Brad Wilson, CEO of SmartFocus in the company's press release:

"Across all online channels and at all stages of the customer lifecycle, marketers need to be able to deliver personalized messages in real time. We are excited about this collaboration with Infor and the opportunity to offer our marketing cloud services to their global customer base."

This collaboration is announced two months after Infor acquired Orbis Global, a SaaS MRM solution provider. It seems that Infor wants to strengthen its position in the field of enterprise marketing management.
