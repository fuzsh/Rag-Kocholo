        "text": "It took me 6 years to have this epiphany about my career. The way we've been socialized to think a career path should look is completely wrong. When I graduated college, I thought very linearly: ‚û° I started working in accounting and decided I needed to pivot ‚û° eventually I started studying marketing in hopes that ‚û° I'd eventually get the marketing job I wanted and if I worked hard enough ‚û° I'd get promoted ‚û° which would lead me to more senior opportunities and more money... The problem with this way of linear growth is that it assumes the goals and motivations we have now will be the same at every step of that path. It offers a fallacious definition of success: when you reach the top, you will be happy. 4 career pivots and a hell of a lot of self reflection later, my growth looks a lot more circular: ‚û° I switched from accounting into recruiting because I had no idea what I wanted to do ‚û° I finally landed a dream marketing job for a recruiting software company because I connected my background as a recruiter ‚Ü™ that sparked my interest in the world of hiring and career advice üîÑ which led me to create social media content teaching others to build happier and more fulfilling careers ‚è© which eventually opened the door to quit my job, grow my creator business, and spend the summer digital nomad-ing across Southeast Asia!!! The alternative to linear growth is circular growth - making decisions based on the information you have now, reflecting on those decisions and their outcomes, and then using this newly acquired information to make subsequent decisions (and to even adjust our decision-making process). I knew early on that the linear growth path wouldn't work for me (climbing the ladder in accounting was not something I wanted to do), but I didn't realize until recently just how important that process was of stepping back, taking stock of what I actually enjoyed about my work, re-orienting my direction, and setting new goals. We all have hundreds of different commitments in life - to our bosses, our peers, our family, our next door neighbors (who's turn was it to take the trash bins to the street again?), often without the intentional reflection on which of those commitments help build the life we want, right now. And as I (quite literally) embark on my most exciting chapter yet (a chapter that would not have been possible without all the pivots) I'm aware that this corporate career break comes with the personal responsibility to check in with myself on where I've been, and where I still want to go. As I type this from the plane to Tokyo ‚úà I'd love to crowdsource any recommendations for books, podcasts, thought leaders, articles, or anything else that could assist in this period of reflection and re-orientation. A few that come to mind are Designing Your Life (I just bought the ebook last night) and the work Milly Tamati is doing at Generalist World, but I'd love to know what's made the difference for you!"
