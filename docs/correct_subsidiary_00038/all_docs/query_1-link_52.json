        "text": "That said, let us explore some of the requirements and rules for truck driving in Poland.\n\nQualifications\n\nIn Poland, driving a truck could require extra qualifications. For example, you might need the ADR certificate if you transport hazardous materials.\n\nCertificate of Professional Competence (CPC)\n\nAccording to the European Union regulation, truck drivers must have a Certificate of Professional Competence to drive lawfully in Europe. This certificate shows potential employers you have the knowledge and training to work as a professional driver.\n\nDriving License\n\nWhen it comes to a truck driving license, you must present a license that fits into one of the following categories if you want to drive freely in Poland.Â\n\nCategory C1: This category is meant for lighter-weight commercial vehicles with a total weight of 3,500 kg to a maximum of 7,500.\n\nMore information on Category C1\n\nIt must be renewed every five years.\n\nThe minimum age for driving a Category C1 vehicle is 18.\n\nYou must take a theory exam and a practical exam before you can get the license.\n\nYou must take part in further examination every five years if you wish to operate a C1 vehicle commercially.\n\nYou must present a medical and ophthalmological certificate to be eligible for the license, including C1E, C and CE.\n\nCategory C1E: The C1E driver's license is the best option for people who drive larger trucks. With the C1E license, you are permitted to drive a trailer that weighs over 750 kg.\n\nMore information on Category C1E\n\nThe minimum age for driving a C1E vehicle is 21.\n\nThe license is valid for five years.\n\nYou must undergo a practical and theory test to get the license.\n\nYou will automatically receive a BE and D1E license if you already have a D1.\n\nCategory C: This is intended for large commercial trucks and those interested in transporting in large numbers. With it, you can drive Category C1 vehicles, and are exempt from the legal requirement to operate a vehicle at a maximum weight of 7,500 kg.\n\nMore information on Category C\n\nThe minimum age for driving a C vehicle is 21.\n\nYou will automatically receive a C1 license.Â\n\nIt is more expensive than a C1 driver's license.\n\nCategory CE: This is the highest license offered, ideal for someone who wants to transport a large number of goods privately.\n\nMore information on Category CE\n\nThe minimum age for driving a CE vehicle is 21.\n\nIt is only valid for five years.\n\nYou will automatically receive a BE, C1E, T and D1E license.\n\nDrunk-Driving\n\nThe blood alcohol limit for driving in Poland is 0.02%âa driver with more than that amount in their system is considered ineligible for driving any vehicle. Driving under the influence of alcohol is a severe offence in Poland. As a result, police have the authority to conduct a random breath test, especially after an accident that has caused an injury.Â\n\nDriving Lane\n\nPolandâs driving lane is on the right-hand side. This means you have to shift to the left lane to overtake a vehicle. Failure to follow this law will attract the authorities and lead to unwanted fines. So ensure you drive in the right-hand lane and overtake on the left if traveling in Poland.\n\nAs a truck driver, you should also be aware that it is a legal requirement to carry the following in Poland:\n\nReflective jackets for all the people in the vehicle\n\nWarning triangle\n\nSpare bulb kit\n\nBreathalyzer test kit\n\nFirst aid kit\n\nSnow chains should be carried and used where indicated by the relevant road signs.\n\nRemember that you need to have your headlights dipped even during the day when driving in Poland.\n\nDriving Age\n\nThe minimum age for driving in Poland is 18 for driving light-duty vehicles. When it comes to heavy-duty vehicles, the minimum age for driving is 21. So, even if you are 18 with a valid driverâs license, you will still be fined if caught driving a commercial truck.Â\n\nToll Roads\n\nIn Poland, toll fees are determined by the overall gross weight of the truck. The rule states that vehicles weighing over 3.5t must be fitted with a toll unit on the road with the ViaToll Scheme. The toll payments can be charged directly at the toll gates and may be collected by cash or credit card. Paying for tolls can be frustrating, especially when passing through multiple tolls in different regions. However, with the help of an EETS-certified toll box from Eurowag, you can simplify toll payments and comply with regulations across Europe.Â\n\nWhat Are the Rules for Driving a Truck in Poland?\n\nThere are bans on specific days for commercial trucks in Poland, and we will go into more detail about them and other driving rules in this section.\n\nWhat Are the Driving Bans for Trucks?\n\nThere are truck driving bans throughout the national road network for goods vehicles with a Maximum Permissible Weight of over 12t during public holidays:\n\nFrom 6 pm to 10 pm on the eve of a public holiday\n\nFrom 8 am to 10 pm on all public holidays\n\nDuring the school summer holidays (June-August), truck bans apply on the weekends from the last Friday of June to the last Sunday before the start of the school year. From June to August, trucks are not allowed to move:\n\nOn Fridays from 6 pm to 10 pm\n\nOn Saturdays from 8 am to 2 pm\n\nOn Sundays from 8 am to 10 pm\n\nThere are also local restrictions for vehicles that weigh over 16t within the area of Warsaw:\n\nFrom 7 am to 10 am and 4 pm to 8 pmÂ\n\nThe official Public holidays in Poland include the following:\n\n1st JanuaryâNew Yearâs Day\n\n6th January-EpiphanyÂ\n\nThe first and second day of Easter\n\n1st MayâLabour Day\n\n3rd MayâConstitution Day\n\nWhit Sunday\n\nCorpus Christi\n\n15th AugustâAssumption of Mary\n\n1st NovemberâAll Saintsâ Day\n\n11th NovemberâIndependence Day\n\n25th DecemberâChristmas Day\n\n26th DecemberâSt Stephenâs Day\n\nRest Times for Truck Drivers\n\nAccording to the directive of the Minister of Infrastructure, the rest period for truck drivers includes the following:\n\nThe daily driving time should not exceed 11 hours.\n\nThe weekly driving time should not exceed 60 hours.\n\nThe total biweekly driving time should not exceed 96 hours.\n\nDrivers are entitled to a continuous break of at least 45 minutes after driving for over five and a half hours.\n\nDrivers can also spend their weekly rest time in the truckâs cabin as long as the vehicle has a sleeping space and is parked properly.\n\nThe Maximum Weight of the Truck\n\nPoland has restricted certain trucks from using their road network even if they comply with EU standards. Under Polish legislation, trucks with a weight per axle exceeding 8t or 10t must obtain a special permit from the authorities for using secondary roads. This is to ensure the safety of the driver and pedestrians.Â\n\nMaximum Speed on Various Roads\n\nThe table below explains the speed limit for trucks in Poland.\n\nPenalties\n\nAs a professional driver, you should know that you are not only responsible for yourself; that is why the penalties can be very severe. The table below shows the fines you can receive for breaking the law in Poland.\n\nSpeeding\n\nOther Offences\n\nObligations for the transport of excise goodsÂ\n\nIf you transport specific categories of goods in Poland, you have probably already come across the PUESC system. This is the Platform for Electronic Tax and Customs Services, which is part of the Polish legislation. This platform also allows notifications to be sent to the SENT system.\n\nSENT covers a wide range of transported goods, including dangerous materials and products subject to excise duty. Dangerous materials include chemicals, toxic substances and materials that may have a negative impact on the environment or human health. In addition, certain products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products, which are subject to additional excise duty, are also included in the SENT.\n\nIn this context, transporters of these specific categories of goods are obliged to register with the PUESC and comply with its regulations. Ignoring these requirements can lead to serious legal consequences, including fines and penalties.\n\nTo avoid the risks of breaching the regulations related to these regulations, Eurowag's Fleet Management comes to the rescue. This tool not only includes efficient management of your fleet, but also a convenient connection to the SENT system, so you can reduce the threat of fines to a minimum.\n\nâ\n\nDriving in Poland can be a fantastic experience if you abide by Polish traffic laws and regulations.
