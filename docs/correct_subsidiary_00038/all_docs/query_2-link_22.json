        "text": "Enterprise software provider Infor will purchase SaaS CRM provider Saleslogix in a move targeting Salesforce in the mid-market.\n\nSalesLogix, which has more than 1700 customers, will be marketed as Infor’s CRM cloud offering and will be made available on Amazon Web Services cloud.\n\nThe move will strain the existing relationship between Infor and Salesforce. Salesforce took a stake in Infor in 2011 and the pair co-developed Inforce, a solution that joins Infor's back-office ERP and financial applications with Salesforce.com through Infor’s proprietary service-oriented architecture ION.\n\nThe purchase adds sales and service functionality to Infor's CRM portfolio, which includes two previous acquisitions - Epiphany, acquired through its acquisition of SSA Global; and Orbis, a homegrown marketing automation tool which expanded Infor's presence in Asia-Pacific, North America and EMEA.\n\nSalesLogix is changing hands for the second time in two years - it was purchased by Switfpage in early 2013.\n\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed."
