        "text": "An eye-opening number of Napa Valley’s highest-rated Cabernet Sauvignons have one thing in common-and it’s not the winemaker or winery behind them. They all rely on grapes grown in vineyards owned by Andy Beckstoffer.\n\nThese are wines of collectors’ dreams, the likes of Schrader Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley CCS Beckstoffer To Kalon Vineyard 2007 (100 points on the Wine Spectator 100-point scale), Paul Hobbs Cabernet Sauvignon St. Helena Beckstoffer Dr. Crane Vineyard 2007 (97) and Carter Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley Beckstoffer To Kalon The Grand Daddy 2012 (96).\n\nThere are other great wines, of course. But the name Beckstof- fer seems ubiquitous in Napa’s top tier and is found on the labels of 37 different California wineries overall. Winemakers pay as much as $40,000 a ton for these Cabernet grapes, whereas the Napa average is closer to $6,500.\n\nThe steep price comes with the territory. The company controls some of the most historic and significant vineyards in Napa; over the past 20 years, more than 70 wines made from Beckstoffer fruit have earned classic scores of 95 or more points in Wine Spectator blind tastings.\n\nIn all, Beckstoffer owns nearly 900 vineyard acres in Napa, worth an estimated $350 million, as well as 2,700 additional vineyard acres in Mendocino and Lake counties. High-profile vineyards like To Kalon and Dr. Crane are only a tiny part of Beckstoffer’s pro- duction, accounting for about 500 tons of the total 14,000 he picked last year, but they represent a big chunk of his revenue.\n\n“We’re not selling an agricultural commodity,” he says of his top vineyards. “We’re selling you a branded product, and our brand-the family name and the vineyard name-is probably more impor- tant than the winery brand.”\n\nIf Beckstoffer sounds cocky, it’s because he is. He has never mel- lowed, and he looks younger than his 77 years. He remains an audacious personality with an ample ego, who has been a contro- versial figure in Napa Valley for nearly 50 years.\n\nHe has been single-minded in his pursuit of success or money, his detractors will say-even courting financial disaster only to bounce back through brass-knuckle business savvy and swagger to become one of the valley’s ultimate insiders.\n\nThe yellow farmhouse with the steep red roof and wrap- around porch seems as deeply rooted in Napa Valley as the old pines and oaks that tower over it. But looks can be deceiving, and the building, in Rutherford, isn’t the vestige of the 19th century it appears to be.\n\nStanding on the porch, Beckstoffer smiles when asked what year it was built. “1991,” he says of the house that serves as headquar- ters for Beckstoffer Vineyards. “Does it remind you of anything?” He doesn’t wait for an answer, explaining that the design is a knock- off of Inglenook’s Chiles House, built in 1856 and among the old- est homes in the valley.\n\nBeckstoffer is used to creating his own history. He arrived in Napa Valley in 1969, at age 29, as a corporate deal-maker and numbers-cruncher. Since then, his trajectory closely aligns with the stupendous rise of the modern Napa Valley wine industry.\n\nHis best-known parcel is his 83 acres of the famed To Kalon vineyard, an Oakville planting whose history dates to 1868. Georges III Vineyard, which borders the headquarters, is 251 acres of vines first planted in 1895 and was the source for memorable Beaulieu Cabernet Sauvignons in the 1960s and ’70s. His other historic vineyards include the 21-acre Dr. Crane and 22-acre Las Piedras, both in St. Helena.\n\n“To Kalon is one of the real jewels of Napa Valley,” says Tony Correia of the California Chapter of the American Society of Farm Managers and Rural Appraisers, which tracks vineyard values. Prime vineyard land on the floor of the valley is worth $300,000 to $400,000 an acre, with recent deals involving select parcels in the heart of the valley closing in on $1 million an acre. It’s a quantum leap from when Beckstoffer purchased his parcel of To Kalon in 1993 (then called Beaulieu Vineyard No. 4) for an estimated price of $44,000 an acre.\n\nFred Schrader was blown away the first time he tasted a Caber- net from Beckstoffer’s To Kalon. It was a 1999-vintage barrel sam- ple from another winery. “[It was] just rocket fuel,” Schrader says. “It was that good-it was the complete balance and purity and concentration.” Schrader released the first To Kalon under his own label with the 2001 vintage.\n\nWinemaker Paul Hobbs, who makes three vineyard-designated Cabernets from Beckstoffer, has worked with the grower for 30 years. “Andy’s a real pro,” Hobbs says. “I have amazing respect for what he’s done.”\n\nJust as Beckstoffer took a gamble buying BV No. 4 to create To Kalon, he’s rolling the dice again in Lake County. While Napa has the prestige, he says Lake County is where the action is for an en- trepreneur. In the past 20 years, he has invested significantly in Lake County, planting 1,500 acres in the remote Red Hills region.\n\nYet Beckstoffer’s attachment to Napa remains strong. “The emo- tion and passion for the land develops over a long period of time,” Beckstoffer says. “I get antsy if I’m away from here more than 10 days.”\n\nDesite Beckstoffer’s many decades in California, Virginia still lingers in his voice. Lanky and spry, he’s known for his cowboy boots and easy laugh. He loves sports and has season tickets to the San Francisco 49ers and Giants. He refuses to miss a Warriors game.\n\nBeckstoffer has been married 56 years. He and his wife, Betty, have five children. David, 55, is president and COO of the com- pany. Tuck, 50, worked with Andy before starting his own wine company; last year he bought Napa’s Dancing Hare winery to house his six labels. Kristin, 49, designs wine labels as a graphic artist. Dana, 52, raises rabbits and chickens in Petaluma. The youngest, Steven, 43, works as a Caterpillar tractor sales representative in Southern California.\n\nThough Andy is the head of a big family, Tuck says that he was not a nurturing dad. “I’m not going to tell you I had the most fun- loving childhood. He’d be the first to say that,” Tuck states.\n\nBeckstoffer himself sheepishly recalls a story about his early days in the wine industry, when he was spending more time traveling than with his family: “My son called the neighbor, ‘Daddy.”” Even once the family settled in Napa, Beckstoffer spent most his time and money on the business, even when money was tight. “It was a slog through the mud through the late ’80s,” Tuck recalls. “We did not have nice things.”\n\nDavid describes his father as an aggressive personality. “That can be good and bad,” David says. “You generally know when he’s in the room, and he’s not shy about tell- ing you what he thinks. He’s fair but he can be stubborn.” Schrader and Hobbs call Beck- stoffer a tough negotiator. “When you have a meeting with Andy, you don’t walk in unprepared or you’re going to get killed,” Hobbs says.\n\nBeckstoffer concedes that he has a reputation for being tough, even divisive. “I don’t feel like I have enemies. I like to think of it as grudging respect.”\n\nNot everyone in the valley sees it that way. “Do I know anybody who likes Andy? I don’t know, I guess there are some,” said a vint- ner who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nMuch of the animosity toward Beckstoffer comes from his stance against what he considers overdevelopment in Napa. While he says he’s not a strident environmentalist, preserving agricultural land is important to him.\n\nIn 1989, he pushed for Napa’s landmark Winery Definition Or- dinance (WDO), which among other mandates requires wineries in the valley to use at least 75 percent Napa grapes. Existing facili ties were exempted but any expansion or new facility must comply. The WDO has been updated and challenged frequently over the years, and some vintners view it as governmental overreach.\n\nControlling hillside vineyard developments is another issue for Beckstoffer. Many critics see his support for both efforts as an at- tempt to shut the door on newcomers and thereby increase the value of his own vineyards. Such initiatives are also seen as over- regulating the local business culture.\n\nBeckstoffer’s role in the valley has engendered skepticism since his earliest days there. Napa was a quiet farming community back then, and he was among the first wave of corporate executives to take the reins. At a time when a handshake was the only contract you needed in the valley, here came a cocky young guy talking about business plans angled at turning a profit.\n\nThere’s an often-told story about Beckstoffer from the mid-1970s which illustrates that he wasn’t interested in playing by the old Napa rules. In that decade, growers were largely considered second- class citizens, and a handful of long-established wineries had all the clout. As one of the founders of the Napa Valley Grapegrow- ers Association, Beckstoffer attended a large meeting with these powerful winery owners.\n\n“The vintners sat around the table and the grapegrowers were supposed to sit in chairs around the outside of the table. I thought, “Screw that, I’m sitting at the table.””\n\nBeckstoffer’s office is deco- rated with mementoes of his personal life and long career.\n\nHe has a mild M&M’s addiction; every desk seems to have a bowl. Aerial portraits of his vineyards line the stairwell and there’s a bookshelf of photos by his door. There are snapshots of him with Jimmy Carter, Mother Teresa and Walter Cronkite.\n\nThere’s also a 1970 photo of Beck- stoffer engaged in what appears to be an intense discussion with André Tchelistcheff, then winemaker at Beaulieu. Beckstoffer was panicked about rain ruining the harvest, and recalls the moment: “André was say- ing, ‘It will be fine.””\n\nBeaulieu and Inglenook, two sto- ried Napa wineries, were the reason Beckstoffer came to the valley in the first place, and his time working with them laid the groundwork for his life today.\n\nBeckstoffer’s father owned a pros- perous mill in Richmond, Va., and made fine woodwork and cabinetry. Beckstoffer attended Virginia Tech on a football scholarship and re- ceived an MBA from Dartmouth.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, he was hired by food-and-drinks giant Heublein in Connecticut to work on acquisition strategies. While Beckstoffer didn’t know much about wine, he saw op- portunity in California and played an instrumental role in convincing the company to invest in wine, and in Napa in particular.\n\nIn 1968, Heublein bought United Vintners, which owned Inglenook in Rutherford and the now-defunct Italian Swiss Colony in Sonoma County. Months later, Heublein bought Beaulieu. Beckstoffer moved his family to California, where he was tasked with creating a vineyard-managment subsidiary, Vinifera Development.\n\nBeckstoffer knew a lot about numbers, but wasn’t a wine drinker. In his 2015 book The Winemaker, Richard Peterson says that when he worked with Beckstoffer at Beaulieu, Beckstoffer wasn’t particu- larly devoted to quality. “He asked me why I was using Chenin Blanc to make [BV’s sparkling wines],” Peterson writes.\n\nWhen Peterson explained that he wanted to use Chardonnay, as was common for France’s top sparklers, he says he was interrupted by Beckstoffer: “Don’t you realize you’re paying $900 a ton for Chardonnay when you could get Thompson Seedless for $60?”\n\nPeterson scoffed at the suggestion. “With a condescending grin, Andy looked at me and said, ‘Dick, you’ll never make a million dollars.””\n\nBy 1973, Beckstoffer had worked for Heublein for seven years and the company was rethinking its move into wine. Profits weren’t what they expected and a boycott by the César Chávez-led United Farm Workers union was causing problems.\n\nThe company wanted out of grapegrowing and decided to unload its 1,200 acres of vines in Napa and Mendocino. Beckstoffer, presi- dent of Vinifera Development at the time, was told to find a buyer, but he was unsuccessful. Instead, he decided to buy it himself.\n\nWhere Heublein saw headaches, Beckstoffer saw a way to gain a foothold in the valley. It was a highly leveraged deal, with Beckstoffer paying $7,500 in cash and Heublein itself lending him $6 million to ensure its grape supply. “That $7,500 was everything he had,” Tuck recalls.\n\nBeckstoffer barely made it. Grape prices tumbled in the mid-’70s, with Napa Cab- ernet dropping from $800 to $400 a ton. Inflation was also running wild. By 1975, Heublein was dropping its farming con- tracts with Beckstoffer’s new company. “That was the backbone of the business. That was our cash flow,” he recalls.\n\nBy 1978, things seemed to be falling apart. Beckstoffer defaulted on his loans and owed about $7 million. Heublein seized about 700 acres in Napa.\n\nBut Beckstoffer managed to hold onto two vineyards still in his portfolio today: Carneros Creek and Melrose. He renamed the company Beckstoffer Vineyards and spent the next five years get- ting out of his financial hole. “I had to sign personal servitude con- tracts,” he said in a 2007 Wine Spectator story.\n\n“He’s taken a lot of risks,” David says. “Most people would’ve be- come risk-averse after that, but he didn’t back down, and started over.”\n\nAs the grapegrowing business recovered, Beckstoffer was able to slowly buy vineyards again. In 1988, he bought Georges III and followed that five years later with the 83-acre BV No. 4, a key vineyard in Beaulieu’s Georges de Latour Private Reserve. He reportedly paid Heublein $3.9 million for No. 4, considered ex- pensive at the time, especially since the site had a phylloxera in- festation and required replanting.\n\nHe renamed it Beckstoffer To Kalon, since it was once part of that historic vine- yard. That led to a 2002 lawsuit by Robert Mondavi Winery against Schrader for using the To Kalon name on his label. The parties eventually settled out of court, and Beckst- offer retained the right to use the name.\n\nBeckstoffer had become convinced that the future of Napa Valley rested in vine- yards, not just winemakers. Back in the 1980s, the winemaker was king and great wines were made in the cellar, blending different grape sources to build complexity.\n\n“Showing off a single terroir was boring,” he recalls. Beckstoffer saw potential in building his own brand through vineyard-desig- nated wines. He liked to tell people that a single vineyard was like a beautiful woman with a chipped tooth. “Her charm,” he says, “was in the way she carried her defects.”\n\nAlong the way, he raised eyebrows in Napa with a grape-pricing formula he devised in 1976. A ton of grapes from his historic vine- yards would cost 100 times the price of the finished bottle of wine, something stipulated in every contract. For example, a winemaker selling a Cabernet for $400 would pay $40,000 a ton.\n\n“We joke with Andy that we need to send a Brink’s truck to pay for the grapes,” Hobbs says.\n\nBeckstoffer is unapologetic about his pricing. Traditionally, grow- ers want to grow as much as they can for a higher revenue stream, while the wineries want to underpay. “We don’t have that conflict anymore,” Beckstoffer says. “Years ago I would have said that we couldn’t make money farming vine- yards. I don’t feel like that anymore.”\n\nBut while he may have found a way to make vineyards profitable, are his grapes worth the price? “They must be, because I keep buying them,” Hobbs says with a laugh. “The wines sell and I’m very pleased with the results I’m getting.” Winemakers generally trust Beckstoffer and his crew, and as Beck- stoffer likes to say, “We don’t tell them how to make wine and we don’t let them tell us how to grow grapes.” Beckstoffer’s price might be aggres- sive, but Schrader says you can’t argue with the quality. “There’s an amazing attention to detail in the vineyards,” Schrader adds. “Andy is a business- man, and he has an exceptional prod- uct, and he’s intent of getting the last dollar for it. Who can blame him?”\n\nAIthough much of Beckstof- fer’s energy is focused on Lake County (see “Uppingthe Ante in Lake County,” page 50), he keeps an eye to the past and the future of Napa Valley.\n\nEventually, his children will takeover the company. He recalls telling them early on, “Go away and find out what the world is like and where your name doesn’t mean anything. Find out what it’s like and be a success.”\n\nIndeed, David remembers how, as a teenager in the 1970s, he couldn’t wait to leave the sleepy valley be- hind. But in 1997, he walked away from a high-paying corporate job to return home.\n\nThese days, Beckstoffer focuses on the big picture and allows David to handle many of the details. Retire- ment is not in his plans.\n\n“He truly loves what he’s doing,” Tuck says of his father. “I want him to slow down, go to Mexico and en- joy himself, but he just won’t do it.”\n\nSchrader puts it this way, “Andy lives the game. He has a complete passion for it.”\n\nDriving west on Rutherford Road, Beckstoffer recalls it as a quiet lane in the 1970s, a place where he often rode his horse. Today, luxury vehicles zoom past. Beckstoffer believes over- development is the biggest threat to the valley. “Some people are trying to make this a fantasy land.” Napa is becoming too much about winery destinations and luxury resorts and homes, he says. It should be about the land, the vineyards. The valley’s rep- utation, he believes, is at risk. “There are all these traffic and environmen- tal problems, and then people get pissed off at the wine business.” From Highway 29, Beckstoffer turns right on Walnut Lane and into the heart of To Kalon. It’s just south of Mondavi and across the highway from Opus One. Twenty years after replanting the vineyard, he’s doing it a second time, adjusting di- rections of rows and tinkering with the latest clones and rootstock. After the 2017 harvest, the company will start with an 11-acre plot along the highway. The goal is to finish replanting by 2028.\n\nBecause winemakers work with specific blocks in the vineyard, each will eventually lose grapes for a few vintages. Beckstoffer hopes to mitigate the pain by asking winemakers to share crop with their affected colleagues. What impact this will have on your favorite To Kalon bottling is hard to predict.\n\nLooking west over the vineyards and toward the Mayacamas, Beckstoffer avows that To Kalon is a special place. “You could say OK, give me the soil type of To Kalon. Give me its longitude and latitude, where it sits, and I’m going to recreate To Kalon. You can’t do that. It doesn’t work that way,” he says.\n\nWhen he first arrived in Napa he thought vineyards were assets to be exploited, but now he sees things differently. His six historic vineyards are protected by conservation easements and have been preserved in a trust.\n\n“These will be vineyards forever. They can never be sold by my children. I keep thinking that some spouse of a great-great-grand- child of mine is going to hate me, but that’s what we want to do.”\n\nThe road from Napato Lake County winds through rugged mountains, dense forests and landscapes scarred by re- cent wildfires. It takes Andy Beckstoffer about 90 min- utes to make the drive north from his office in Rutherford to his vineyards in the Red Hills American Viticultural Area (AVA), in the south- ern part of Lake County. With new opportunities in Napa Valley growing scarce, Beckstoffer looked to this unproven region in the 1990s and was instrumental in getting the Red Hills AVA approved in 2004. “Jess Jackson told me ‘You can’t grow good Cabernet in Lake County,’ and I said ‘Thanks, Jess, stay the hell out,'” Beckstoffer says with a laugh. Jackson’s original winery was located in Lake County. “I don’t disagree with him about Lake County as a whole, but Red Hills is different.”\n\nIt’s a matter of soil and elevation, Beckstoffer says. The AVA ranges from 1,350 to 2,600 feet, giving it a generally sunny but cooler mountain climate. The distinctive red soil is a product of the nearby dormant volcano, Mount Konocti, and the land is stud- ded with black obsidian, quartz crystals and gravel. “It’s the perfect soil for Cabernet,” he points out.\n\nThe company has three vineyards in Red Hills: Amber Knolls, Amber Knolls West, and the newest, Crimson Ridge. Cabernet is the primary grape. As he tours the vineyards, Beckstoffer explains how he and son David manage the company. Operations in each of the three of counties where they have vineyards (Napa, Lake and Mendocino) function almost as distinct companies, with sepa- rate general managers and viticulturists.\n\n“We basically let people run their own businesses within the company,” David says. “Dad is very hands-on but he doesn’t micromanage.”\n\nBeckstoffer believes that’s the best way to grow grapes, saying, “I don’t want to be just another Napa guy farming in Mendocino or Lake counties.”\n\nIn all, Beckstoffer owns 20 vineyards in Napa, Mendocino and Lake, for a total of about 3,600 acres of vines.\n\n“We’re probably the third-largest land owner, behind Kendall- Jackson and Gallo,” in California’s North Coast, Beckstoffer says, “but we are by far the largest seller of grapes” in the region. Duck- horn, Franciscan, Hess, Joel Gott and Clos du Bois are among the producers that use his grapes in Napa Valley, North Coast and other regional bottlings.\n\nBeckstoffer is convinced that Red Hills shows the same poten- tial that Napa Valley did in the 1960s. But winemakers have been slow to buy into the idea. The AVA may be able to produce a good $20 bottle of North Coast Cabernet, but will its wines ever be wor- thy of an $80 or $100 price tag?\n\n“I can’t tell people, ‘These are great grapes.’ If you don’t make great wine, it’s not a great vineyard,” Beckstoffer concedes.\n\nIn 2016, he set about proving his theory, creating a contest of sorts. Ten winemakers are being given an acre each in Amber Knolls for three vintages. That’s about 3.5 tons a year for each winemaker, free of charge, and 50 winemakers applied for a chance. It’s no small undertaking for Beckstoffer: Lake County Cabernet grapes sell for nearly $3,000 a ton.\n\n“It’s not a publicity stunt,” says Beckstoffer, who declined to name the participating winemakers. “We think we have great grapes. We don’t know if we can make great wine or not. The wine- makers don’t know yet.”\n\nA 2013 Visit Napa Valley study found that, of the many reasons people from all over the world choose to visit the region, first on the list is the area’s natural beauty, closely followed by wine, food and, then, farther down, the rest of the lifestyle amenities. What the casual visitor may experience but not see is what keeps the place coherent: the love for the land and the shared dedication to maintaining a sustainable balance for the benefit of the whole. Maintaining this delicate balance, like the balance in a fine wine, is always a work in progress.\n\nAs NorthBay biz takes the measure of where Napa County stands at the start of 2014, we’ll consider some of the major issues and some of the ways the community is managing to work together to maintain the balance essential to all. We’ll start, as visitors do, with the land and end with what may (to some) come as a surprise: how Napa County is making a national name for itself not only in wine and lifestyle but in the success of its innovative educational model.\n\nFirst the land\n\nThe Napa Valley brand, literally, comes with the territory. Geographically blessed with soil and climate and topographical coherence, thanks to the embrace of the Vaca Range on the east and the Mayacamas to the west, Napa Valley, with its (usually) quiet river and picturesque vineyards, is commonly referred to by those who live here as a paradise. And like the original paradise, there are threats, some of which are generated by the very success of the valley itself.\n\nTo maintain the integrity of Napa’s biodiversity, scenic views and agricultural character, the Napa Land Trust, with its 1,700 active members, partners with landowners, business and other nonprofits, as well as with local, state and federal agencies to preserve and protect lands into perpetuity. “So far,” says Doug Parker, Napa Land Trust CEO, “we’ve protected more than 53,000 acres and completed 150 real estate conservation projects with landowners around the county. That shows the willingness and interest of landowners to do this and our ability to work successfully with a wide range of landowners.” The rewards may be taken for granted by those who view the valley from afar, but for those who do the work, the rewards are constant and personal. “There’s nothing more tangible than land,” says Parker. “It’s something you can stand on. It’s real.”\n\nAfter 37 years, Land Trust members can look back with satisfaction. At a 2013 event, Parker says, the organization honored Harold Kelly, who was on the board of the Land Trust and had helped protect a piece of land 37 years ago -“and it’s still there, just as spectacular as it was then. And because we protected the land in perpetuity, it will be there far, far into the future.” The Land trust also honored four landowners, Francis and Eleanor Coppola, David and Nancy Garden, Bruce and Martha Attwater and Ted and Laddie Hall, who protected about 1,500 acres by donating easements on their own lands.\n\nNapa Valley’s strong agricultural identity\n\nWhether focusing on the land, wine, culture or the general ambiance, the miracle of Napa Valley is held together by the vision of extraordinary, ordinary people. “We’ve been really, really fortunate to have committed, dedicated people who love the valley from an agricultural standpoint,” says Clay Gregory, CEO of Visit Napa Valley.\n\n“The first agricultural preserve in the United States was Clay Gregory is CEO of Visit Napa Valley put in place by visionary Napa Valley vintners in 1968,” he reminds us. “Robert Mondavi’s winery was only two years old at that time. And there were some really smart people who saw Napa Valley could become a developed suburb of San Francisco instead of a prime agricultural region. They put in place the Ag Preserve, which has kept the place so special in spite of the fact we’re so near a major metropolitan area.”\n\nSt. Helena grower Andy Beckstoffer, who’s been speaking out for the Ag Preserve for more than 40 years, says that, while things are generally going well in the agricultural domain, and 2013 has been a great harvest, we shouldn’t become complacent about the brand. “These days, we’re crushing too many non-Napa grapes,” he says, “and that has an effect not only on the Ag Preserve but on the Napa brand.” He explains that a visitor can purchase a wine in the valley, expect it to be a genuine Napa Valley wine, and not notice it’s made with “California Cabernet,” not “Napa Valley Cabernet.” It’s not an outright deception, he says, but it gives a deceptive impression. “What you see is not what you get-and that’s bad.”\n\nHis second concern is for the health of the Ag Preserve itself. “The hospitality functions at wineries are out of balance with their production facilities,” he says. “Wineries are supposed to be producing wine, but they want direct-to-consumer sales. I understand that. But it gets out of balance.”\n\nFor him, the city of Napa’s move into the wine business is a very good thing. It helps the Ag Preserve and, therefore, the Napa Valley brand. “There are now 30 wine tasting rooms [in city limits],” he points out. “This is important, because as they take on the hospitality function, it relieves the Ag Preserve of the hospitality functions that have developed around wineries and which have a major influence on traffic, environmental issues and our neighborhoods.”\n\nGrowth with balance\n\nLinda Reiff, president of Napa Valley Vintners (NVV), says the success of Napa Valley’s wine industry is about balance. “From our perspective representing the wine industry, the culture of the valley is one that balances land and environmental preservation with business success to ensure Napa Valley’s position as one of the premiere wine regions in the world.” If the success of the organization’s annual auction is any measure, the formula is working.\n\nSince 1981, through its Auction Napa Valley, NVV has given more than $120 million to Napa County nonprofits. In 2013, the $16.9 million raised easily topped the previous record. This is good news for the wine industry and for the community at-large. “We have this deep and beautiful philosophy of taking care of our community,” says Reiff. “I think it’s an important legacy of the Napa Valley wine industry.” Through the auction, NVV supports local organizations that enhance the community through health care, youth development and affordable housing.\n\n“The idea that a rising tide lifts all boats is a core value of the Napa Valley wine industry, and it’s the spirit with which our organization was founded nearly 70 years ago,” she says. “I think we’ve set an example of how an industry can come together and give back to help ensure the health and well-being of its community. We want this to be an incredible place for everyone,” she says, adding, “just look out the window, and you’ll remember we’re extremely fortunate. We have tremendous responsibility to help keep this place in amazing shape.”\n\nChanges in the industry\n\nBig winery sales this year have made news. The Wall Street Journal called it a “harvest” of wineries. Clos Pegase was sold to a group of investors including Dean and DeLuca owner Leslie Rudd; Mayacamas Vineyards was sold to private investor Charles Banks, former co-owner of Screaming Eagle; and Araujo Estate Wines was sold to French billionaire Francois Pinault. While three big sales may sound like a trend, Linda Reiff reminds that Napa Valley is also experiencing an increase in small brands made by wineries and winemakers who, for one reason or another, don’t own vineyards.\n\n“I think the proliferation of small brands has been quite exciting,” she says. “We now have almost 500 wineries in our association, and that represents significant growth. But,” she adds, “80 percent of our brands produce less than 10,000 cases of wine per year.”\n\nSo, for those wanting their own brand without buying in to the traditional model-purchasing a vineyard then building a winery (making a small fortune by starting with a large one)-experienced winemakers and new enthusiasts can now create their own labels with a lower capital investment.\n\nPracticing sustainability\n\nNVV’s 2011 Climate Study Task Force showed Napa Valley as unique, because it’s neither coastal nor interior but has climatic attributes of both. The study showed the valley has warmed slightly over the recent decades but not to the degree reported in broader California studies–the warming has only occurred in nighttime temperatures during winter and spring, not in daytime temperatures. “We have to remember that the wine industry is based on farming, first and foremost, and farmers will adapt to whatever change is occurring,” says Reiff.\n\nMeanwhile, she’s proud of the sustainability program promoted by NVV. The Napa Green Certified Land and Winery programs are successfully working throughout the valley. The land program was developed collaboratively by NVV, Napa Valley Grapegrowers and nearly 30 community organizations and government entities and certifies participating vineyards that work with the California Land Stewardship Institute (CLSI) to adopt “best practices” for land use (the winery program is separately certified by the county). Upon enrollment in the land program, participating landowners receive technical assistance and a field review, then work up a Farm Plan to consider all aspects of responsible watershed management. To be certified, the grower’s plan must be approved by a team made up of representatives from NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Fisheries, Regional Water Quality Control Board and the Napa Agricultural Commissioner’s Office. “I think proactive efforts, like our Napa Green Certified Land and Winery programs, are good examples of how we’re leading the way to protect the valley for future generations,” says Reiff. “It’s only been 10 years, and we have more land in the Napa Green Certified Land program than is planted with winegrapes. Isn’t that cool?” Napa Agricultural Commissioner Dave Whitmer, who retires at the end of 2013 after 33 years (the last 20 as commissioner and sealer of weights and measures) fighting pests that threaten the grape crop, leaves office on a note of satisfaction. After 13 years of vigilance, the glassy-winged sharpshooter was never really allowed a foothold in the county. Whitmer credits the success of remaining free of the pest to the county’s cooperation with measures the Ag Commissioner has put in place, including regulation of ornamental nursery stock. But that’s only part of the good news. “Controlling the movement of the insect vector was really the sprint,” says Whitmer. “The marathon was finding a cure for Pierce’s disease, which is caused by the spread of bacteria carried by the glassy-winged sharpshooter, blue-green sharpshooter and other [related insects].” Pierce’s disease is devastating to vineyards and, so far, incurable, but there’s progress on that front, says Whitmer. “We’re probably only several years away from the nurseries being able to reproduce and sell commercially some grapevine plant material that will hold some resistance to Pierce’s disease-and that’s amazing. If we could find a cure for Pierce’s disease, we wouldn’t care as much about the glassy-winged sharpshooter or other vectors.” The most recent problem, following the protests over the proposed 2009 light brown apple moth program (citizens across the state decried the lack of environmental studies in advance of widespread aerial spraying), was the European grapevine moth, which fed not on leaves, but on the flower and fruit itself, often leaving behind deadly fungi and bacteria on the clusters. (It’s the infamous insect seen throughout the county on “Kick the Moth Out!” billboards.) The Ag Commission trapped more than 100,000 European grapevine moths in 2009, in virtually every part of Napa County. By 2013, after containment measures had been put in place, it trapped only 40 moths in several remote areas. Clearly, the program worked. What was the magic? “I tried to learn lessons from the light brown apple moth days,” Whitmer says, referring to the passionate protests against and distrust of the proposed containment measures, “to reach out to the community, lay out what I thought the options were and gain some understanding from them as to what direction the whole community thought was the right way to go. And then we incorporated those recommendations as best we could into our program. I think it worked out well to include everybody, and it’s helped us implement a program without opposition.”\n\nVisit Napa Valley\n\nThe economic slump of 2009 took its toll on the tourist industry, with lodging revenue down by 20 percent. But every year since then, according to Visit Napa Valley’s CEO Gregory, the industry has rebounded in double digits. “August is always a big month for us,” he says, “and this year was just phenomenal.” According to Gregory, the total revenue was up by 14.9 percent over last year, and the overall year-to-date tally was up by 13.2 percent. “It’s amazing how well things are going.”\n\nHe credits this increase not to additional rooms or new hotels but rather to existing hotels that have been able to raise their rates and still build occupancy, “which is the best of all worlds!” One of his organization’s key ongoing promotion efforts is to encourage corporations and appropriate associations to come to Napa Valley for retreats and conferences, and enjoy the amenities-golf, hiking, biking, balloon rides, wineries and restaurants- while they’re here. He says that, as overnight weekday visitors, groups are good business. Plus, they’re easier on the local traffic and great for local restaurants.\n\nHe’s also quick to point out that not many people realize the entire West Coast has only two three-star Michelin-rated restaurants and both are in Napa Valley: The French Laundry (Yountville) and the Restaurant at Meadowood (St. Helena). “In our tiny little valley! It’s incredible,” he says. There are no two-star restaurants here, but the 2014 Michelin Guide lists five one-star restaurants in Napa Valley\n\nThe entire West Coast has only two three-star Michelin- rated restaurants- and both are in Napa Valley.\n\nAuberge du Soleil (Rutherford), Bouchon (Yountville), La Toque (Napa), Solbar (Calistoga) and Terra (St Helena), and there are five Bib Gourmand restaurants, defined as “inspectors’ favorites for good value”: Bistro Jeanty (Yountville), C Casa (Napa), Oenotri (Napa), Cook (St. Helena) and Redd Wood (Yountville). “This is the most stars per capita of any wine region in the world,” says Gregory, laughing. “And 20 years ago, Michelin didn’t even know the United States had restaurants!”\n\nThe Visit Napa Valley’s public relations effort, which includes all Napa County areas under the Napa Valley brand name- including Lake Berryessa (the tourist identity of which, he says, is “a work in progress”)- includes a firm based in New York as well as a local PR agency, and the brand seems to have settled down. What was once the “Conference and Visitors Bureau (CVB)” and then the “Destination Council” as of last year, is now officially “Visit Napa Valley,” which gets right down to business. “Both Alice Marshall Public Relations [New York] and Fuller & Sander [Napa] have just been rocking it,” says Gregory. This year, Napa Valley enjoyed the excitement of being the official wine region of the 34th America’s Cup. So everyone coming to watch the race from the vantage point of America’s Cup Park in San Francisco could stop in the Napa Valley Wine Lounge (where only Napa Valley wine was served). The America’s Cup website gives all partners a separate page, and the Napa Valley page is dazzling, with video and links to Visit Napa Valley and NVV.\n\nDestination marketing is a fast-moving science, with ever-increasing flexibility provided by smartphone apps. Gregory has been has been working to make it absolutely easy to do things like book a hotel or restaurant. “We did our first app three years ago and, at the time, it was kind of pioneering,” he says. But a new app should come out by the time this article goes to press. “It will still be called Visit Napa Valley, and it will be aesthetically better and more easy to use than the app we had before,” he says. He sees mobile apps as the way of the future for easy access to information and making connections.\n\nCity of Napa\n\nGregory isn’t alone in looking forward to the activity and excitement that several approved developments will bring to the city of Napa. Todd Zapolski’s Shops at Napa Town Center will bring attractive retail, dining and lodging to downtown, which will enhance the daytime experience of visitors and locals alike. The development of several new hotels, including the St. Regis in Napa and a couple in St. Helena and Calistoga, will attract the desirable overnight visitors. And he says he has hopes the former Copia will be developed in a way that will add to the livability and draw of downtown. “There are at least two different efforts moving along to turn Copia into something sustainable, with an eye toward the original Robert and Margrit Mondavi vision of it being a center for wine, food and the arts.”\n\nJust up river from the former Copia, the Oxbow Public Market has become a thriving, year-round marketplace for wine, food, browsing and gathering, dining and occasional music or film viewing. Specialty artisan purveyors offer meats, seafood, teas, oils, wine, cheese, organic produce, baked goods, coffee and more,\n\nand founder and CEO Steve Carlin credits its success to a harmonious partnership between the proprietor, tenants and community. “We know why people come here,” he says. “You can’t find a more beautiful place to live or visit, and I think the Oxbow is a\n\nmicrocosm of all the good things Napa Valley is and wants to be.”\n\nDon’t forget the arts\n\n“The best thing to have come along in the last 12 to 18 months,” says Olivia Everett, CEO of Arts Council Napa Valley. “is the support we’re experiencing as the result of wineries and the hospitality industry incorporating art into their business strategies.” She says some of the more cutting-edge vintners understand that now,\n\nwith more than 500 wineries and hundreds of tasting rooms, the idea of diversifying the visitor experience with specialized tours and vacations plays nicely into what the culture of Napa Valley is about. “The shared strategy between Visit Napa Valley and the Arts Council is to promote wine, food and the arts as a single concept. We’re really excited about that.”\n\nAn example of how this works is the partnership between City Winery, a live music, culinary and wine-oriented experience with venues in New York and Chicago and Napa, which is creating a partnership with Napa Valley Opera House. The new, combined venue is due to open in 2014. City Winery will be given a long- term lease, which will let the Opera House nonprofit scale back its administration but still keep 75 performances per year for community programming.\n\nCity Winery will maintain the historic building, devoting the downstairs to a full restaurant and restoring the performance floor of the auditorium back to its original, cabaret-style seating, so people can see shows while dining. Everett says this partnership can be a model for the future regarding how to combine community programming and sustainable revenue for profit. “We have a tremendous amount of talent, creativity and ideas here in the valley,” she says, “I’m excited to see more sustainable growth in the arts, and I hope people watch out for it.”\n\nAs the city of Napa’s image as a sleepy, small town gradually dissolved into the awakening hipness of the current downtown scene, the idea of a headline-grabbing, ear-drum blasting rock festival in the summer of 2013 created a combination of anticipation and dread, usually circling around the question: “Can Napa handle all this excitement?”\n\nThe answer seemed to be even with the inevitable, “first- festival” kinks (crowd management problems, traffic problems, scheduling, pricing and occasional sanitation problems)-a reserved Yes. But, after the boom of the amps died down, BottleRock producers delivered a shock: $2.5 million in unpaid bills. Will the organizers ever pay the city, unions, numerous vendors and workers who made the festival rock? Will the many worthy Napa nonprofits, promised $1 million in donations, ever see checks?\n\nAt this writing, no payments are on the horizon. Yet ticket sales for 2014 were announced on the BottleRock website shortly after the first one ended.\n\nGetting from here to there\n\n“A lot of things are going well in Napa County right now,” says Supervisor Bill Dodd. “Our economy has come back and our agritourism business is up. With that comes transportation challenges. We have 29,000 people in our workforce who are commuting from the south every day to work in Napa. Those drivers merge with tourists and others, and the congestion down in South County is very evident. Our transportation corridors are pretty well stacked up right now. We need to be working with Metropolitan Transportation Commission [MTC] and the state to determine solutions.”\n\nIn an effort to get a handle on the valley’s traffic patterns, the Napa County Transportation and Planning Agency (NCTPA) is conducting a travel behavior study that tracks car movements via cell phone GPS data. “We’re looking at cell phone data to see where the traffic is coming in and where it’s going out,” says NCTPA Executive Director Kate Miller. “We’re sending license surveys out The Napa Valley Vine Trail Coalition, with 40 board members and more than 80 volunteers, has worked for the last five years to create a safe trail for bikers and walkers from Napa all the way”Our economy has come back and our agritourism business is up.” To both the people who live here and who’ve visited here, so we understand why they came, when they arrived, how long they stayed and what they did when they were here, so we get a better feeling for how we might design our transportation system around that.”\n\nThis kind of tracking has drawn fire from people concerned about privacy, but Miller says measures have been put into effect to safeguard confidentiality. “We understand privacy is a critical right,” she says, “and we don’t want to violate that. At the same time, we need this information to really understand how we’re going to deploy transportation resources.\n\nNCTPA is also looking for ways to encourage system users to change travel behavior, and reduce the congestion by reducing the number of cars. “We’re looking into things like car and bike sharing. We have several routes that connect people to BART, Amtrak and the Vallejo ferry on weekdays; that infrastructure already exists. We’re going to want to give some thought to what we can do on the weekends to accommodate visitors. That’s another thing we’ll look at as part of the countywide plan.”\n\n-Napa County Supervisor Bill Dodd north to Calistoga. Supported by NVV, NVGG and Napa Land Trust and led by the tech-visionary-turned-vintner Chuck McMinn, the Vine Trail plans to create 14 continuous miles of trails for walking and biking from Napa to Yountville in 2014.\n\nGroundwater issues\n\nPeople in Napa Valley are never far from discussions about water. “In the area just east of Napa, we’re taking more water out of the ground for vineyards, golf courses and other uses than we’re making up with rain water, and the area is experiencing groundwater depletion,” says Supervisor Dodd.\n\nIn an innovative solution to a difficult problem, the Milliken- Sarco-Tulocay Recycled Water Project will bring reclaimed water from the Napa Sanitation District out to that area to serve primarily large vineyard operations and Napa Valley Country Club. The project was hotly contested, but after several years of discussion, in 2012, community members finally agreed to form the Community Facilities District (CFD) to finance the pipeline. “We’ll start seeing construction sometime in 2014,” says Dodd, with satisfaction. “It’s always very easy to kill projects because of naysayers. But Supervisor Keith Caldwell has been a driving force behind this. He’s done a great job building consensus and getting us where we are today. He’s done an incredible amount of work.”\n\nCaldwell says the county hopes to be laying that pipe in the summer of 2014. “We’ve received all our federal share for\n\nthat project, and we’re going forward.” The project will use recycled water in place of the 200 acre-feet of groundwater that Napa Valley Country Club pumps annually for irrigation. The entire recycled water project will provide up to 700 acre feet of recycled water annually. “This will take the largest ‘straws’ out and will allow for an eventual, natural recharge.”\n\nOver and over, when Napans talk about achieving something by reaching consensus, they refer to the work that was done to bring the community together on the Napa River flood plan in 1997. That model of consensus is alive today. “Three supervisors are still serving today who were on the board when community, business and political leaders got together to create our flood control project,” says Caldwell. “They not only left a lasting gift of a great flood plan but also gave us a great example of how to create consensus. You don’t just go in, throw something down on the table and say, ‘This is what we’re going to do.” You have to get buy-in from all sectors of the community.”\n\nLike the flood project, the Milliken-Sarco-Tulocay Recycled Water Project is a model of innovation and collaboration. “We banded together with our two adjoining counties, Marin and Sonoma, to get this done,” says Caldwell. “I’ve been to Washington, D.C., at least six times advocating for this project, and it’s being used as a model for how Washington, D.C., and the Bureau of Reclamation, our sponsor in this program, want to see business done.”\n\nThe project shows the county’s ability to come together as a community to address a problem of a depleted water table by creating a supply that conserve! “I’m from American Canyon,” says Caldwell, referring to the area in Napa County with the greatest population growth since the late 1980s, “and I think people should know how fragile the balance is that we have in this county between agriculture and urban sprawl. That balance is under attack almost on a daily basis. I think the current board- and previous boards-have resisted the temptation to just approve development or change zoning. Instead, we’ve fought the hard fight, and I think it’s really paid off.”\n\nDevelopment changes\n\nLarry Florin, director of housing and intergovernmental affairs for Napa County, says the long-disputed Napa Pipe development is on its way to resolution to provide affordable, multi-family housing to satisfy the requirements of the state. “We’ve turned the corner in terms of working cooperatively among the county’s separate jurisdictions and with the developer to approve and, hopefully, get a project built that all of us can be happy with and proud of,” says Florin. “We hope the days of adversarial confrontations about this project are over.”\n\nIn November, the board of supervisors signed an approval for a term sheet between the county and Napa Redevelopment Partners, which advances the project a step closer. They’re working on a development agreement and design plans, and hope to get the project approved in early 2014.\n\nSupervisor Diane Dillon notes the county’s proposed plan to move the jail, now in downtown Napa, to an area on the outskirts of town as a positive development. “The current jail was built before we realized the extent to which substance abuse issues would contribute to criminal activity and, of course, well before the state implemented “Realignment” to keep more offenders in local jails rather than in state prisons.\n\n“We believe we can run [the new jail] in a more progressive and cost-effective way,” she says. “We’ve implemented a very\n\nprogressive, evidence-based system for managing prisoners and trying to give them opportunities to better themselves, so we can get a grasp on the recidivism rate.”\n\nThe board is currently looking for the land and the funds to make the change happen.\n\nDillon also is watching for a potentially devastating blow to the Ag Preserve and the character of Napa Valley. Her concern is that, under the current federal, legal and regulatory scheme, it’s possible that a Native American group could get Bureau of Indian recognition as a tribe and have land taken into trust, which would then become a sovereign “nation” (and therefore not subject to the local land use requirements by which every other property owner in Napa County abides). According to Dillon, this is a stated desire of at least one group of Native Americans that’s currently litigating with the federal government.\n\n“We have a very delicate watershed here,” she says. “We’ve been blessed, because of our soil and climate, to be able to produce high- quality agriculture, and we’ve been able to preserve our land for that purpose. Everybody in Napa County has to comply with Measure P which requires [until 2048] a citizen vote to make zoning changes on agricultural and watershed lands-and that’s really all we’re asking here,” says Dillon, “and that’s really all we’re asking here.”\n\nHealth for all\n\nThe county of Napa completed a health needs assessment in 2013 and is now developing a community health improvement plan based on its findings. “We tried to not just look at numbers of diseases,” says Dr. Karen Smith, Napa County health officer and public health division director, “but really to look at the community as a whole, from the perspective of assets and also challenges.” One major asset in Napa County, which may not be expected on an assessment about health, is the ability of the community to develop partnerships and foster collaboration among diverse stakeholders. “This is a big strength in Napa,” Smith says. Another is people’s sense of living in clean, safe neighborhoods.\n\nThe challenges, she says, cluster around the divide between high and low income, and between the Hispanic and non-Hispanic population. “So, for example, 15 percent of Napa County residents rate their health as fair or poor, as opposed to excellent or good,” she says. “But if you look at Hispanic and low-income residents, the percentage rating their health as less than excellent or good will be much higher.” Educational and economic challenges, limited mental health services and alcohol and drug abuse, particularly among the youth, all contribute to the disparities in health outcomes. “Some numbers in there are staggering,” she says. Finally, overweight and obesity is another major challenge. Education can be a plus, along with income and culture. “We know that people who graduate from high school have overall better health status as adults.”\n\nThe four priority areas of the Health Improvement Plan are to\n\nUIVIDIUIT UN BULAR\n\nimprove wellness and healthy lifestyles; create and sustain partnerships for collective impact; ensure access to high quality health care and social supports across the life course; and to address the social determinates of health, such as income, poverty, housing and educational attainment. To achieve these goals, the Live Healthy Napa County collaborative will continue to find new ways to strengthen existing and create new\n\npartnerships, including with the community, for even greater “collective impact.” Smith says, so far, about 30 organizations have formed “a pretty robust collaborative” that encompasses all aspects of the county and includes health providers from hospitals, governmental agencies, mental health providers as well as the nonprofit sector.\n\nBecause health is an integral factor in all aspects of the county’s functioning, the core group includes the Napa County Transportation and Planning Agency, the Office of Education, law enforcement, the business community and even the Farm Bureau. It includes the county, all six city governments, Napa Valley College, representatives of the faith community, a number of nonprofits that work on educational attainment and health, and Emergency Women’s Services, among many others. The core support team includes Queen of the Valley Community Outreach, St. Helena Hospital Community Outreach, Kaiser Community Outreach, the Health and Human Services Agency and the Napa Coalition of Nonprofits, which has been part of the core support team from the start. The huge task going forward is assuring access to high- quality health services and social support across the life course for everyone in Napa County.\n\n“We’re lucky,” Smith says, “because Napa County has a strong culture of philanthropy, and we have some very prominent philanthropic organizations that have donated early on in this process.”\n\nAmong key supporters are groups working to further the educational interests of all children in Napa County, so all students in Napa County schools can be prepared for college, careers and lives that are, by the health assessment’s standards, conducive not only to economic success, but to health.\n\nIn Napa County, leaders in the public education system are grappling with the same challenges facing schools all over the country-and particularly in the Napa Valley Unified School District and are tackling the issue head-on in an innovative, transformative way.\n\nNew school model\n\n“It’s a renaissance in education,” says Napa Valley Unified School District Superintendent Patrick Sweeney of the new model being practiced in classrooms throughout the county. “It’s amazing: Teachers are excited; they’re seeing the excitement in their students; and they’re all learning new things.”\n\nAnyone walking into one of the transformed classrooms in the Napa Valley School District will see a new configuration-no teacher in front, no kids dozing in rows and they’ll feel the energy, whether in kindergarten, where children are helping each other learn language and math on iPads, or in middle school or high school where groups of students, armed with their laptops and devices, are learning from experience and working together to find answers, create solutions or present the results of their “real-world” research projects to an audience of teachers, peers and guests. The energy the visitor experiences is the buzz of Project Based Learning.\n\n“We’re trying to make sure all students can master the new Common Core State Standards by being proficient in the four\n\n‘C’s-critical thinking, communication, creativity and collaboration,” says Sweeney. Yes, one might wonder, but does it work? Last year, he points out, the College Work Readiness Assessment showed that students at Napa New Technology High School improved 207 percent more than comparison students in measures of deeper learning between freshman and senior years, a high predictor of college and career success.\n\nThe model for technology-enhanced, project-based learning was pioneered\n\nand perfected over the last 16 years at Napa New Tech High and is now being successfully adopted all over the country. Lydia Dobyns, president of New Tech Network, which has carried the model to 134 New Tech schools in 23 states and Australia, says of its success, “I think it’s because we start with the very simple premise that, if you can engage the learner because what he or she is learning is relevant, connects to the world he or she lives in now and can be viewed as an authentic way to imagine a future, then anything is possible!”\n\nChuck McMinn, president of Napalearns, a nonprofit educational foundation made up of key business leaders, educators, ex-CEOs and high-tech entrepreneurs who come together to help local school districts transform to the New Tech model by providing funding, supplying technical expertise and subsidizing professional development for teachers, says that, while it’s possible to spend a great amount of money to provide fine education for a small number of students, what’s needed now, in Napa and across the country, is for all students to be prepared “for a future we can’t even identify!” He says there are jobs being created, but they require skills, education and the ability to collaborate, think creatively and solve problems. Why? Because the pace of change is increasing to the point where,”[the next generation] will be required to solve problems no one has ever solved before-and that requires more education.”\n\nIt also requires a whole transformation of the way learning takes place, and McMinn believes Napa County has the talent, resources and the will to make it happen. Not only does Napa County boast three higher-education institutions: the four-year Pacific Union College in Angwin, Napa Community College and Touro University in nearby Vallejo, but the Napa community has, as an established as part of its culture, the ability to work together to achieve creative solutions to challenges and a recognition that what’s worthwhile\n\nrequires investment. The latter is a sentiment McMinn repeats loudly and often when he talks about education: It needs to be seen as an investment, not a cost. He’s optimistic for the future and says Napa has what it takes to make this transformation happen: “Our unique ability to achieve this change is because we have a strong sense of community, and we’re small enough that we can focus on this and work together to help create the solution.”\n\nNapa: A place and an idea\n\nMany aspects of the Napa story are missing from this survey. The dedicated work of so many nonprofits, such as The Pathway Home, which helps veterans recognize and recover from PTSD, the many sustainability groups working to keep Napa healthy and green, not to mention the all stories of people who make a difference on a daily basis to make Napa County what it is. But all would probably echo the same sentiments: That it’s community, collaboration and everyone bearing their share that makes and keeps this a great county. As community leader Dorothy Salmon, who has, since the Flood Plan days, succeeded in bringing people together over seemingly impossible issues, says, “Napa typifies possibility thinking in spades. We ask, ‘Why not?’ instead of ‘Why?'”\n\nAndy Beckstoffer is Napa’s pioneering grape grower. He has been managing vineyards in Napa Valley since the 1970s and has been one of the significant figures to who have overseen Napa’s rise from a sleepy farming community to a world class winemaking region. A leader in promoting sustainable winemaking through innovations such as drip irrigation, vine spacing, bench graft production, vineyard technology and fanning management that have significantly improved wine grape quality, he has also been a mediator in working through labor issues with farm workers, maintaining the community’s cohesiveness in the face of growth and development. Today, Beckstoffer Vineyards owns and farms over 3,600 acres in three Northern California winegrowing regions – the Napa Valley, Mendocino County and the Red Hills of Lake County and his holdings include two of the Napa’s most famous vineyards: To Kalon and George III. In 2010, Andy became the first grape grower to be elected to the Culinary Institute of America’s Vintners Hall of Fame. Grape Collective recently caught up with the forward-thinking farmer to talk Cesar Chavez, picking out the best locations and land, and why Beckstoffer never felt compelled to make any wine himself.\n\nChristopher Barnes: How did you get involved in the wine business and how you ended up in Napa Valley?\n\nAndy Beckstoffer: When I got out of graduate school, I went to work for a corporation in the east, and I got the job in 1968 of analyzing the premium California table wine business, and in those days, the only two premium wines were Almaden and Paul Masson. We did a big study, one of the things we looked at was how do you be successful here? And one of the things you had to do to be successful was you had to get the right grapes, and so I never forgot that. That was really important. Then, the company we bought was Italian Swiss Colony which was owned by the farmers of San Joaquin, mainly San Joaquin, and so I spent a lot with the farmers. I began to like the farmers, and I began to like the people. One of the things I noticed about everybody here was everybody had a passion for the grape. They had a passion for the business and I liked that. I liked the land. I certainly liked the business, but I liked the people most of all.\n\nThe corporation decided to invest and so I got the job of going around the country trying to entice people to invest in vineyards and a lot of people said “Yes, but who’s going to farm it?” and so we tried to set up a farming company, and we could find people who would farm 30 acres the old way, but nobody would farm a hundred acres the new way, and we wanted to introduce technology. Secondly, about right that time we were hit, or the corporation was hit by the boycott of their liquor products by Cesar Chavez and United Farm Workers. So I was asked to set up a farming company, and I did. That’s how I came to Napa.\n\nYou were involved with settling that dispute with Cesar Chavez?\n\nYes I was. It was a very difficult thing to do, but… I had a situation with Cesar that we trusted each other. He never lied to me. I never lied to him. It was a situation here where most people thought that the workers were union people, and I always thought that they were our people who are represented by a union. They chose that. They wanted us to force all the people who had sold us the winery, all the growers in the San Joaquin into the union, and we had a contract with the growers who said we couldn ‘t do that. There was a meeting at my house where I said unbeknownst to Hueblein, or anybody else that 1 was going to show them the contract. The general counsel, Jerry Cohen showed up and surprise to me, Dolores Huerta showed up at my house, and I remember in those days she was really persona non grata, but we got it settled and we just took it in hand to settle it. It settled two weeks later when they finally found out that we simply could not do what I had been telling them they couldn’t do.\n\nYou have a tremendous amount of acreage in Napa Valley right now. Tell us a little bit about how you built it up over time.\n\nWe were a farming company. We started out farming for other people, and in the early 1970s we were farming 10 to 12 percent of the Napa Valley, but as a farming company. We knew the land from all over the valley, and every time we got a couple nickels, we bought another piece of land and people would lend us the money. Then, as the values grew, we would borrow more money on that property. I worked with Andre Tchelistcheff, and so we were very interested in Cabernet Sauvignon, so we went looking for the best Cabernet Sauvignon properties and when we found one, we bought it. Then by 1989 we had critical mass, enough that we could have our own farming company without having to farm for other people, so we stopped farming for other people at that point.\n\nHow did you pick your spots? How did you find the parcels that you ended up putting together?\n\nWe’ve been farming around everything and plus I had Andre who had been here forever and knew Cabernet Sauvignon and we wanted to grow Cabernet Sauvignon. The whole deal with Hueblein was that …We were trying to convince other people, other farmers to plant Cabernet. They said, “We just paid off the Bank of America, and you want me to stop growing something that I can get 8 tons per acre, to grow 3 tons per acre of Cabernet, and we get the same price, so we’re not going to do that, ” but we knew where the property was through our work farming and through what Andre had been buying forever. The thing about vineyards whether it’s To Kalon or George HI or whatever, the total equals more than the sum of the parts, so you have to see empirically what’s it done over a period of time, and they are the vineyards that have been the best wines… For example To-Kolan was planted in 1858, and in 1890 or whatever that was the best red grapes in the world, I mean, certainly in California, in Napa Valley. Well, it’s always been the best grapes. The 1940s grapes aren’t as good the 2010 grapes, but it’s always been the best. I could tell you about the soils and the climate and everything, but it’s the whole sum of that and that’s true I think of all grape vineyards, the total is more than the sum of the parts, so you want to find vineyards that have been planted and had been successful over a large period of time. We have six what we call Heritage Vineyards, all planted in the 19th century.\n\nHow many different wine makers do you work with right now?\n\nWe may work with 60 to 100.\n\nThat’s a lot of relationships to manage.\n\nIt is. It is. What we did early on, we developed something that’s called the “Bottle price formula”. In agriculture, the grower wants to overproduce and the buyer wants to underpay, and so we developed a system that rather than being paid on crop size …In agriculture, the big crops-low price, low crops-big price …We developed a system where we get paid based on the value of the retail bottle, a percentage of the final price to the consumer. What we are trying to do is that we’re trying to make better wine, and I think that has made better wine for us, but it put the grower and the vintner on the same page. Anything we can do to make that wine better, we’re willing to do. We cooperate with them greatly. We farm. We don’t tell them how to make wine. They don’t tell us how to farm, but we talk to each other all the time, but all that same basic interest that I’m doing what they want because of my interest, and they’re doing what I want because of their interest, so we get along very well.\n\nYou also have vineyards in Mendocino and Lake County. I mean tell us about the differences there.\n\nWhen we bought the company, they had vineyards in Mendocino that I was forced to buy, and we grow Chardonnay there because that ground is very heavy. It’s not drained and so can’t really grow Cabernet there, but it makes an excellent, excellent Chardonnay. Let me just tell you as a farmer, when the wineries test out grapes, we taste block A, B, and C of Cabernet, but in Chardonnay, we taste oak treatment number 1, oak treatment number 2, and oak treatment number 3. As a farmer, all the value added is in the great wine. We went to Lake County and here farm at 100 feet above sea level. There we start farming at 2000 feet above sea level. Totally different, but the red hills has the perfect soil and it looks like a really unique climate for growing Cabernet Sauvignon. We’re super pleased with that. We’ve been therefor almost 15 years now, and we’re beginning to prove to the wineries and to the public that the quality of that fruit. I’m very, very excited about it. Cabernet Sauvignon from Lake County, is in my view, the most promising wine product in the new world of wine. That means the Australian wines and the New Zealand wines and everything else, Cabernet from Lake County is the most exciting thing.\n\nWhy you don’t make wine yourself?\n\nThe reason I don’t make wine myself is because I enjoy making grapes myself. I enjoy the land. I enjoy the people. I enjoy just being outside and doing. It’s a totally different business. Just because you can grow potatoes, doesn’t mean you can sell potato chips. I don’t do consumer marketing. I don’t travel. I don’t want to say it’s not something bad with winemaking. It’s something good about farming, and if I was in winemaking, I could never have accumulated the grapes that I have. You simply can’t, starting with nothing and doing it yourself, you simply can’t do that. Understand the business in Napa, that over 50 percent of the grapes that are grown in Napa are grown by people who don’t make wine. Both businesses, grape growing and winemaking are so capital intensive, most people couldn’t do both, so some of us decided to go one way, and some of us decided to go other way, but it’s all about your attitude and the kind of life you want to live.\n\nThe dominant culture in the Golden State is one of “growers on the one hand and wineries on the other,” and many wineries buy in their grapes from third-party growers. Stephen Brook explores the complex relationships involved, and the implications in terms of terroir and value\n\nThe notion of an estate winery is not well entrenched in california. many wineries may own some vineyards, but they will also buy grapes, either from contracted growers or from the spot market. companies such as mondavi and Beringer have substantial vineyards statewide, but even they will supplement their own crop. napa Valley’s Heitz is a good example of a commonly encountered model. The family owns a cabernet vineyard called Trailside, but it also contracts to buy grapes from two celebrated sources: Bella oaks and martha’s Vineyard. Heitz as a whole farms 375 acres (150ha) in napa Valley, but it sells much of what it grows to other wineries. Thus, estate vineyards and outsourced grapes are juggled so that the winery ends up with the mix that suits its requirements.\n\nThere are, however, a few estate wineries in california, many of them small. Screaming eagle, Harlan, and dominus are all self-sufficient. one of the few large-scale estate wineries in napa Valley is Trefethen, with 500 acres (200ha) of vineyards. it is very much the exception. one reason for this mix-and-match approach is that many wineries sell hundreds of cases out of their tasting rooms, and they therefore need a wide range of wines to offer customers. To a european it may seem odd that a napa winery will include on its list a mendocino Sauvignon Blanc or a Santa Barbara Pinot noir, but that is often the case. wineries do not always attract a knowledgeable clientele. i have often stood in a tasting room in dry creek Valley offering nothing but robust red wines and overheard visitors ask if they have any white wines. if the answer is no, a sale has been squandered.\n\nThere are other reasons for the dearth of estate wineries. first, a winery may be more interested in winemaking than in farming. The two professions are very different, and they call for different skills. many winemakers would rather leave the business of growing grapes to specialists. Quite a few california wineries—Testarossa, Siduri, arcadian—are simply négociant businesses, owning no land but buying grapes from prestigious vineyards. another reason is that most top vineyards are not for sale; even if you only want to buy their grapes, you must go down on bended knee with your money at the ready. The majority of the fine old Zinfandel vineyards in napa and Sonoma are owned by families that have farmed them for generations. They have no intention, all things being equal, of selling their precious heritage to anyone else. estates such as Trefethen were acquired when land was relatively cheap. only billionaires could contemplate buying a few hundred acres of prime vineyard land today.\n\nThe rise and rise of the estate winery\n\nas a consequence of this structure, there is a constant tension between wineries and growers. Put simply, the grower wishes to obtain both the highest possible prices for his grapes and the largest yield compatible with good quality. The winery, on the other hand, wants to acquire fruit at the most competitive price. depending on the economic situation, it may be the grower who is on the phone to offer winemakers as much fruit as they want, or it may be the winery that is making the rounds, on the lookout for affordable fruit of acceptable quality.\n\nJim Young, of the robert Young Vineyard in alexander Valley, recalls: “Until 1999 or 2000, there was no need for us to knock on doors. Then there was a change, because there was an oversupply of grapes, and wineries started canceling contracts. So the market fluctuates. Sometimes the wineries have the upper hand, sometimes the growers do, but there is always a demand for good grapes. it’s rare for contracts to exceed three years, though we have a long-term contract with chateau St Jean that has never been canceled. fads can also affect demand. merlot is out of fashion, so a grower will have to accept a fairly low price, since wineries can easily find cheap merlot grapes.”\n\nAlthough there are plenty of small-scale growers tending a few acres that have been either inherited or purchased as part of a “lifestyle” investment, the professional growers often farm thousands of acres. The kendall- Jackson company cultivates 12,500 acres (5,060ha), the kautz family tends thousands of acres in lodi, and in the north coast the Beckstoffer family farms more than 3,000 acres (1,200ha). Growing grapes can be big business.\n\nAndy Beckstoffer did not begin life as a farmer. a Southerner, he has an mBa from dartmouth college and went to work for the drinks company Heublein as a production analyst. Heublein was keen to make inroads into the wine business and had its eye on the famous Beaulieu winery. Beckstoffer helped clinch that deal in 1969. He then formed a subsidiary called Vinifera development company, which took care of keeping Heublein supplied with grapes as its wine production expanded. He also planted hundreds of acres of cabernet Sauvignon off his own bat, anticipating the demand for the variety. By 1973, Heublein was losing interest in Vinifera development. Beckstoffer made a successful offer for the company and, in his early 30s, found himself the owner of 1,200 acres (485ha) in napa and mendocino. Today, the Beckstoffer family owns vineyards in napa, mendocino, and lake county.\n\nSome of those plantings are new (such as those in lake county), others are historic vineyards. whenever there was a downturn in the wine industry, Beckstoffer was ready to pounce, snapping up vineyards that shortsighted farmers or wineries were finally willing to relinquish. indeed, nine out of the ten vineyards that Beckstoffer owns in napa were purchased from wineries. in 1988, Beckstoffer bought one of the historic Beaulieu vineyards, and in 1993 he acquired 90 acres (36ha) in the legendary To kalon vineyard in oakville. The Beckstoffers are more than collectors. if theirs has become a name to be reckoned with, it is because they are expert farmers who have thought long and hard about such matters as vine density, drip irrigation, and integrated pest management.\n\nA few years ago, andy Beckstoffer showed me one of his rutherford vineyards. He explained how they had chosen the precise row orientation to encourage even ripening of the bunches; he talked about how different clones had been selected to match each soil type; he spoke of density and spacing and how yield was calculated; and of information technology and the difficulty of analyzing the stacks of data now at their disposal.\n\nas technically astute growers, andy Beckstoffer and his son david, who joined the company in 1997, are by no means alone. equally revered are growers such as larry Hyde and lee Hudson in carneros, the Pisonis in monterey, and the dutton family in russian river Valley. Their names on a “vineyard-designated” bottle of wine are good indications of quality, because these growers tend to be choosy about who they sell their grapes to.\n\nThe bottle formula\n\nThe system of “growers on the one hand and wineries on the other,” is now well established. andy Beckstoffer explains: “The california system came about because wine production is a capital-intensive business. few could afford to run both vineyards and wineries. This led to a situation in the 1980s when wineries simply didn’t value vineyards. They thought they could cook up wines from whatever was delivered to them, and they often sold off their own vineyards, which allowed people like us to accumulate significant holdings. winemakers are now taking more of an interest in what happens in the vineyards. in the past, we would never see winemakers until just before harvest time. now they are checking the vines year-round. But there is still a basic conflict, in that traditional growers want to overproduce and old-style wineries want to underpay.”\n\nThe traditional way to pay a grower was according to sugar levels. By the 1970s, contracts had become more sophisticated as both growers and winemakers devised parameters that would trigger payments and/or penalties. Beckstoffer, however, threw all that out of the window when he came up with “the bottle formula,” which stipulates that the price of the grapes should be directly related to the price of the wine made from them. “it’s very simple,” says Beckstoffer. “The bottle formula ensures that the grower gets proper reward for the quality of the wine made from his grapes. That puts the grower and winery on the same page. whatever the bottle price, the price per ton is 100 times higher. Therefore, a $100 bottle would require our grape price to be $10,000 per ton. many other growers now use the same formula. However, we also have a minimum price per acre, which allows a winery to reduce its crop below our usual level if it wishes to do so, while we continue to control the actual farming. we can’t have a hundred different winemakers as our bosses.\n\n“Growers need to run vineyards profitably, but they also see them as a treasure to be preserved, especially in napa. That means revenue has to go to the land as well as the wineries, or you won’t preserve the vineyards. it means that grapes aren’t treated simply as a commodity to be traded. it’s our way of giving the client access to some of the best vineyards of the valley. Just as important, it returns profitability to the land, which is the only way napa will survive as an agricultural area. The moment that ceases, vineyards will be turned into shopping malls, as happened in Sonoma. That is the ultimate justification for the bottle formula.”\n\nThis sounds high-minded, but many wineries regard Beckstoffer, rightly or wrongly, as a hard-headed businessman, as well as an expert farmer.\n\nPotential for conflict\n\nThere are many issues on which both sides need to agree when drawing up a contract. These include crop and ripeness levels, the harvesting date, and the extent to which the client can dictate how the vineyard is farmed. The fundamental decision is whether the grower is paid by the ton or by the acre (0.47ha). The former is a simple calculation, and if the grower greedily overcrops, he may well face the eventual termination of the contract. if payment is by the acre, then crop levels no longer matter. if the grower’s instinct is to crop at 5 tons per acre but the client insists on only 3 tons, the grower may as well oblige the client, since the payment will be the same.\n\nBeckstoffer, for one, is not keen on winemakers telling him how to do his job. “if the winery wants to dictate farming practices to an excessive extent, then it’s likely the relationship won’t work out. a long-term contract requires trust on both sides and an understanding that sometimes conditions favor one side, sometimes the other. Some winemakers still believe that the lower the yields, the better the wine will be, which is debatable. They feel pressured by their owners or by wine critics to aim for very low yields. But it’s very hard to estimate the weight of the bunches. we growers can do a bunch count, but we won’t have an exact idea of the weight per bunch—and thus the tonnage—until September, and sometimes our best estimates are wrong. it almost impossible to contract for an exact tonnage, so what we do is contract to deliver certain rows. if we are being paid a minimum price per acre, then we can accept that the client has the right to ask for the crop to be reduced, and we can go into harvest knowing that we won’t be left with excess grapes if harvest exceeds estimates.”\n\nJim Young feels the potential conflict is overstated. “i know some producers claim to do their own farming, but what they do is rarely something that wouldn’t be done by us anyway,” he says. “a good grower will pull leaves to get better aeration and make sure clusters aren’t touching. it’s expensive work, but it’s also a kind of crop insurance, since there will be less chance of rot if the weather deteriorates.\n\n“With a per-acre contract, clients feel free to instruct us to reduce the crop severely. But often they don’t understand that an exceedingly low crop can give vegetal tones just as much as an excessively large crop. That’s because the balance of the vines is being disturbed, so they’re not expressing their fruit as well as they could and should.\n\n“wineries also decide the picking date and cite minimum Brix in the contract, as well as a maximum figure. we would normally aim to pick at 25.5° Brix, by which time the ripening should be homogenous. of course, weather patterns can intervene, which is why there has to be some latitude, some understanding between both parties.”\n\nVirginia lambrix, formerly viticulturist for deloach and now winemaker for Truett-Hurst, both in Sonoma, is also skeptical about the mania for ultra-low yields. “Some winemakers believe they can produce a 95-point wine from some vineyards simply by reducing yields. Such demands can annoy even the best growers, because those winemakers are using conventional wisdom to assert that low yields necessarily result in better wines. even with a per-acre contract, there can be tension. Growers hate seeing their vines being punished, however much they’re being paid. also, every time a winery demands some shoot removal or additional bunch-thinning, it costs growers money to meet these demands.”\n\nReaching a compromise\n\nwhen a grower begins working with a new client, it is standard practice to negotiate a one-year contract. if all goes well, then a more long-term deal can be concluded. david ramey, who buys from some of the north coast’s top vineyards, dryly observes that “the most trouble-free relations with growers are those concluded with a handshake. when i have to sign a 14-page contract, i know there could be problems ahead.”\n\ncertain decisions are always left up to the client. The harvesting date is crucial, so winemakers will keep checking the vineyards they buy from in the weeks before harvest. Their decision may be based on how the grapes are tasting and their anticipated maturation, on weather forecasts, or on more banal issues such as the availability of tank space at the winery. The grower will supply the crew to harvest, but if a large number of client wineries all want their rows or blocks picked on the same day, the grower and the winemaker will just have to argue it out and reach a decision satisfactory to both parties.\n\nThe most conscientious growers prepare carefully before harvesting. lee Hudson in carneros explains: “we’ll give an estimated harvest date to wineries to help them get prepared, but sometimes we have to keep calling them before they will actually make a decision. we try to deleaf the vines the night before picking a block. it means the winery gets fruit with fewer leaves, and it also allows our crew to pick more quickly. we ask wineries to give us three days’ notice before picking their blocks, but it doesn’t often work out that way. But we have to have a dance card, and it gets filled up fast. i’ll only allow winery crews into the vineyard if we’re really maxed out with picking too many blocks.”\n\nSince the 1990s, with the mantra of “phenolic ripeness above all else,” it has become common for winemakers to demand ever longer hang-times, with, as a consequence, ever higher sugar levels. Growers such as Beckstoffer are by no means happy with this trend, which often seems driven by the wish to make wines in a style that appeals to critics and, thus, wins those priceless high scores from the press. “The trend toward very late harvesting of overripe fruit is unwelcome to most growers,” says Beckstoffer. “Sugar accumulation over 24° Brix comes not from photosynthesis but from dehydration, which means lower tonnage. we give our clients precise data on the numbers and chemistry of their blocks to help them reach the right decision on when to pick. and there are other reasons for late harvesting, such as a larger-than- anticipated crop that leads to full tanks. That means wineries have to complete fermentation of a tank before it can receive a new batch of fruit. But as growers, we can’t delay indefinitely. The winery must make an effort to find the capacity for our fruit, and we will do our best to help them. That’s where a good relationship is important, so that we can deal with such problems.\n\n“we have our own idea of optimal ripeness. we feel flavor development is best at 25–26° Brix, and i’m not convinced we can get that ripeness at 24° Brix. what we, and many good winemakers, want is ripeness without exceeding 15% alcohol. in my view, napa’s claim to greatness has to be based on the wine’s compatibility with food, and an ability to age in an interesting way.”\n\nYoung also finds demands for excessive hang-time irritating, concurring with Beckstoffer that dehydration leads to loss of weight and thus lower revenues per ton. “what’s more, during harvest, overripe berries can simply drop off the bunch, leaving you with a substantial part of the crop on the ground. You can lose as much as half a ton per acre that way.”\n\ni ask lee Hudson whether he minds his beautifully cultivated grapes being deliberately picked overripe and then watered during fermentation to produce a drinkable wine. “no, not really. in france they have the opposite problem, so they chaptalize. Here, they water! anyway, ripeness and quality are subjective notions.”\n\nSome growers welcome active participation in the farming by interested winemakers. at Pisoni in monterey, mark Pisoni says, “we sell by the row and by the acre, so we’re happy to have our clients specifying yields and the number of clusters per shoot. we have also done an experiment jointly with winemaker adam lee of Siduri. we harvested some vines at different crop levels, and he fermented them separately; then we got together to assess how they had turned out. we found that cropping at 2.5 tons per acre gave better wine than the same vines at 1 ton per acre.”\n\nif they can’t be resolved by discussion, major disagreements between growers and wineries will result in the eventual termination of the contract. Hudson notes that many wineries, in these difficult economic times, are keen to wriggle out of some of their existing contracts. “if a winery wants out and i can find another buyer, it’s no problem. if i can’t, then they have to stick with me and honor the contract. in the present economic conditions, my costs are rising, while many clients’ sales are slipping. So, at some point, we may have to agree to go our separate ways. Grape farming is a business, but it’s based on relationships that in some cases have endured for decades. Some of my clients were my classmates at davis.”\n\nwhere there is considerable trust on both sides, vineyard development can become almost a joint venture. over in Sonoma, the dutton family has been farming apples for generations, and grapes since 1967, when warren dutton first put chardonnay vines into the ground, even though his neighbors said he was crazy, insisting that chardonnay would never ripen. Since dutton’s death in 2001, the vineyards have been run by his sons, who farm more than 1,000 acres (400ha) in 60 sites. Unlike the Beckstoffers, who like to call the shots, the duttons are willing to be more accommodating, especially when planting or replanting a block. often clients will come to them and outline their needs. Sometimes the duttons will agree to custom-plant for them, with joint decisions on clones, trellising, and other matters. But that will be entertained only if the client will agree to a long-term contract, because it takes five years to recoup the costs of putting in a new vineyard. much the same happens at other prestigious vineyards. Thus, at Bien nacido in Santa maria Valley, Syrah was planted at the request of au Bon climat and Qupé.\n\nContracts and agreements\n\nlee Hudson is a good-humored man with a mop of curly graying hair, but behind the joviality there is clearly a sharp mind for business. He recalls that in the late 1980s he started receiving requests to green-harvest. “To growers, that seemed like dropping money on the ground. what these clients wanted was, in effect, to lease a block of vines from me, rather than just buying whatever came off that block. That required a different arrangement. we could assume that the yield a grower could reasonably accept from this land is 5 tons per acre—though here at Hudson it’s often half as much. if the going rate was $2,000 per ton, then i would expect to earn $10,000 per acre. So i could agree to give the winery control over the crop for that sum. That way my interest was protected. The winery could risk reducing the crop without having to go to the expense of purchasing land and planting vines. That sum of $10,000 is an average. Growers make money from generous years when there is a huge crop, given by nature. But that happens only every few years, and a high-yield year is almost always followed by a low-yield year. So we estimate an average, but this can only work with long-term contracts. This per-acre system was a response to a burgeoning market and higher wine prices.”\n\nSurprisingly, Hudson still sells half his crop by the ton, not by the acre. “it’s my crew that takes care of all the processes from pruning to harvest. i’m happy to let wineries have a say or even send their viticulturists here to watch procedures such as leaf-pulling take place. Unfortunately, the only person we see from some wineries is the winemaker coming here on the day of harvest to complain about something. But good wineries take pride in their blocks and take a close interest in them, which i welcome. The only thing i won’t do is let their crews into the vineyard to pick the grapes. That’s our job. all that is fine with a tonnage contract. But if the winery wants to dictate the crop level, then they have to negotiate a per-acre contract. i see myself essentially as a custom farmer, and i am happy to cooperate as best i can with what wineries want— but i also have the right to charge appropriately.” (Bruce cakebread of the eponymous napa winery also favors per- ton contracts. “if you pay per acre, the grower may still neglect frost protection or make other errors, which then become problems to be borne by the client.”)\n\nfurther fine points in the Hudson contract require the joint skills of lawyer and mathematician. “contracts can get complicated at harvest. our tonnage contracts have a rain\n\nclause and a sugar clause. at over 24° Brix, dehydration occurs, which lowers our tonnage. Twenty years ago, wineries wanted grapes picked at 23.5° Brix, but today it’s considerably higher. our clause states that if the Brix is over 25.5, then the seller (me) will be paid the target yield times the price per ton and the number of acres. This protects us from losing financially if the sugar is higher than it should be. The rain clause states that if the client delays harvest after the fruit has reached 25.5° Brix and it starts to rain, the grapes are theirs whatever the quality. The wineries sign this kicking and screaming, but they have to accept responsibility for their decisions and not saddle the grower with the consequences.”\n\nlike the Beckstoffers, Hudson operates a bottle formula. “with my costs and with the naturally low crop in carneros, there’s no way i can sell fruit to end up in a $25 bottle. Some 75 percent of my costs are labor costs, and we give our vineyard workers good pay and benefits. Years ago, it took 40 man-hours to farm an acre; today, with all the operations demanded of us, it’s close to 250. The pricing of my grapes reflects not just the bottle cost but the added value of the Hudson name—i don’t just apply a formula. as for vineyard designates or per-acre contracts, i won’t even consider them until some years have gone by and both parties have got to know each other. i have a license on my name, which gives me the right to sample three bottles of wine made from my grapes before they are labeled. So if a wine that is going to carry my name is of poor quality, i can stop it. But almost all wineries self-regulate, so that [need] hardly ever arises. if i were to withdraw permission to vineyard-designate, it would in effect be the end of my relationship with that winery.”\n\nThe view from the other side\n\nand what of the winery’s point of view? Tom mackey, the veteran winemaker at St francis in the Sonoma Valley, is probably typical of most. “we have more control over our 45 contracted vineyards than in the past, and we employ a viticulture consultant who takes suggestions directly to the growers. we have some input into the farming at a few vineyards, but in general i prefer growers to do their own farming. contracts are three to five years, and in the rare cases when growers won’t respond to suggestions and improve quality, they’re not renewed. But my team is continually in the vineyards, because we don’t want any surprises at harvest. Some wineries have become too hard- nosed in their relations with growers, and that’s only earned them animosity. we prefer a consensual approach and invite our growers to two-day meetings, complete with barbecues, so they can all taste the wines from their grapes. we pay by the ton, but contracts specify yields and clusters per shoot; and of course, we decide the picking date.”\n\nFor Joel Peterson at ravenswood, “the input we have at each vineyard will vary. Some need little or none. others welcome it. Sometimes it’s no more than a conversation. working with a top grower is as close as you can get to owning your own vineyard without actually doing so.”\n\nAlthough some wineries claim to make a substantial contribution to the farming at contracted vineyards, it seems that this is often exaggerated. david ramey in Sonoma notes, “at Hyde and Hudson i can control anything i want, but i don’t need to. The vineyards are self-limiting in terms of yield. i do a little leaf-pulling and canopy management, but this is just fine-tuning.” Pax mahle, a Syrah specialist in Sonoma, adds, “if you want to farm a parcel yourself, you have to deal with the pride of the grower, and that often means compensating them financially for perceived losses.”\n\nThree is a crowd\n\ndr Phillip freese observes how the role of the viticulturist has changed over the years: “as a viticulturist working for mondavi, i was certainly able to pass on to our growers new skills and techniques that would increase quality. now, as a consultant, i can act as an intermediary, a kind of guidance counselor, since i speak a common language. many winemakers talk to growers in a kind of ‘wine-speak’ that many growers just don’t understand. Growers vary greatly in their knowledge. in napa they tend to be very well educated; in Sonoma, less so. But the links between vineyards and wineries are growing closer all the time, which is positive.”\n\nViticulturist Virginia lambrix likes to form a relationship with the grower, so that both benefit—but it doesn’t always work. Some\n\ngrowers are hobby farmers who may have acquired an excellent site but don’t know the best way to farm it. She can help them to do so. “However, we need to be know. every grower is real nice when the contract has been signed—but a year on, they can grow a second head and relations can plummet.”\n\nnot every grower is a professional like Beckstoffer or Hudson. many have retired from their careers and fancy living in their own vineyard. Such proprietors usually employ vineyard-management companies. These may do a very good job, but they complicate the communications between the grower and would-be clients. lambrix notes, “it’s not ideal if the winery calls the [vineyard-management] company directly, because if the latter follows the winery’s instructions, it’s still the grower that gets sent the bill [for extra costs incurred]. But if you talk directly to the owner, he doesn’t always understand what’s required or transmit the request correctly to the management company. i find it important to get all parties into the vineyard at the same time, so you can sort out issues in advance.\n\n“my job at deloach included forming links between the winery and the vineyards. for most wineries, that’s a luxury. But an experienced viticulturist can contribute to the quality of the farming. i can walk through a vineyard and spot problems that the grower may not recognize, simply because i have walked through hundreds of vineyards, while many growers only see their own. But you need to be diplomatic. if the relationship becomes adversarial, both sides suffer. lifestyle growers are not really farming grapes as a business, so they are often less committed than a professional grower.”\n\nPros and cons\n\ndoes the california model work? i think it does, even though there is no substitute for the estate that grows its own grapes and can control the innumerable variables. a good grower is not necessarily a good winemaker, however, and vice versa. at small properties, expert consultants can be used to bridge that gap. at large wineries, highly trained professionals can monitor the work of their regular growers. But there will always be a measure of uncertainty when the grower and the winery are separate entities. many growers complain of interference by arrogant winemakers, and no doubt some growers can get up the noses of winemakers by refusing to take their requests and goals seriously enough. The harvest period is fraught with difficulties, too. Grapes may not always be picked at the optimal moment, sorting"
