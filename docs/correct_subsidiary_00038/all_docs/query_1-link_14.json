Whether from appearing weekly on some of the hottest party flyers throughout the Midwest or because you had a copy of his now infamous mix tape, “Love Nation” sold out of all the local record stores, the name Julio Bishop is synonymous with jacking dance floors since 1987.\n\nGetting his start as a dancer and DJ in Chicago’s nightclubs and warehouses, but soon expanding his influence; from NYC to LA, to the beaches of Miami, Puerto Rico and Mexico, Germany and Sicily, Julio has been bringing his deep, mystifying grooves to the world for over 3 decades. His intimate knowledge of classic Afro-Latin and Jazz, , as well as his acquired proficiency of Disco, Electronica, Club & Deep House takes his sets far outside the realm of what is attainable by a greener selection of DJ’s.\n\nFunneling his talents into the studio in the early 2000’s, Julio helped launch RealDEEP Recordings, along side label partner Brian Cullen (aka Bjak) where, together they paved the way to further coproductions and solo projects on labels such as Deep Explorer Music (Madrid) and Eargasmic Recordings (Chicago).\n\nWith more releases on the way and a selection of upcoming gigs scheduled between Chicago. Puerto Rico, LA & Hawaii, you’ll want to keep your eyes peeled for what’s to come next from this proved House Music veteran.\n\nThe evening offers a last look at this retrospective that spans Csicsko’s 35+ year career, highlighting work from his recent series of books, LGBTQ+ ICONS, FASHION ICONS, and new works of iconic artists. Also included are Csicsko's posters for the City of Chicago, and his Gay Games logo designs, selections from his famed Saints in the Garden series and designs for Chicago's LQBTQ+ service organizations. Csicsko’s playful, distinctive style and use of bold colors reflect his passion for being a visual participant in the cultural world that we live in.Make sure to RSVP for this amazing event!\n\nGolden Hour at Epiphany:\n\nStop by Epiphany for Golden Hour beforehand for free live music, drinks and lite bites in the Café Bar!

Keenly interested in how such disparate worlds can be brought together, RWW’s performances often feature the reedy, earthy idiosyncrasies found in the typical wind quintet instrumentation coupled with the unexpected tonal qualities and rhythm that are more prevalent coming from an electric guitar, bass, or drums.\n\nFormed in 2015, RWW has performed at numerous locations around Chicago, including Evanston SPACE, the Lurie Garden at the Art Institute of Chicago, Art Makers Outpost, Fulton Street Collective, and in partnership with Classical Revolution Chicago. RWW frequently combines performance with education as they weave songs together to create a narrative for the listener. Concise and intricate pieces performed for the court versus rousing sea shanties for the common worker to illustrate the similarities and differences between class systems. Or “Ventis in Horto,” wind quintet music inspired by the work of Jean-Luc Mylayne.\n\nIn 2017 RWW shifted from the common literature written for wind quintet to focuson the concept of a show exploring the works of rock and indie artists like Alanis Morissette, Radiohead, and others. This departure from the typical quintet aesthetic explores the works of these individualsvia original arrangements, digital tape looping, and effects processing, asking the question “what does it mean to play 21st century literature with 18th century instrumentation?” Their fan favorite ongoing series entitled “Ravenswood Winds Play Radiohead” continuesto be showcased in the Chicagoland area.\n\nPersonnel:\n\nLily Floeter, Flute\n\nLaura Perkett, Oboe\n\nColleen Corning Griggs, Clarinet\n\nAnna Jacobson, Horn\n\nAiran Wright, Bassoon\n\nJoin us in the Cafe Bar Wednesday through Saturday for free live music, starting at 5PM until 8PM.

We’ll celebrate the 40th anniversary of his landmark album Structures From Silence, a timeless masterpiece of emotional depth and texture, paired with an architecturally-mapped light show.\n\n⟴\n\nSTEVE ROACH draws on the beauty and power of the Earth's landscapes to create lush, meditative soundscapes. Inspired by Klaus Schulze, Popul Vuh, and Tangerine Dream, Roach’s visionary sound design has captivated listeners for decades.\n\nFirst emerging with the Berlin School-styled album Now in 1982, he came into his own with the 1984 minimalist epic Structures From Silence. Efforts such as 1988's equally heralded Dreamtime Return were directly inspired by desert life, incorporating field recordings and rhythms inspired by indigenous music traditions. Dark ambient works such as 1996's The Magnificent Void and 2000's Midnight Moon reflected the vast expanse of space.\n\nDuring the 2010s, he began building an extensive modular synthesizer/sequencer system, revisiting his Berlin School roots with albums such as 2020's album Tomorrow. Roach has maintained an impossibly prolific work rate throughout his career without sacrificing quality or craftsmanship, resulting in countless hours of truly sublime, otherworldly music.\n\nGolden Hour at Epiphany:\n\nStop by Epiphany for our live music series concerts, and be sure to hit Golden Hour before-hand for drinks and lite-bites!

CWHC supports the documentation and dissemination of Chicago women’s history through research, writing, teaching, publication, preservation, interpretation, and public education. CWHC serves as dynamic network of academic scholars, teachers, archivists, librarians, media professionals, community leaders, activists and members of the general public, all interested in the power of Chicago women’s history to inform the present and inspire the future.\n\nThe Chicago Women's History Center was founded in 1971 as the Chicago Area Women’s History Conference to support research, writing, teaching, preservation, and dissemination of women's history in Chicago. The oldest continuing non-profit women’s history organization in the nation, CWHC has carried out its mission through public programs, academic seminars, and workshops, curriculum development, support of elementary, secondary, college and university\n\neducators, walking and bus tours, and publications, documentaries, and public performances. In 1990 CWHC embarked on a major research and writing project that resulted in publication of the award-winning Women Building Chicago, A Biographical Dictionary 1790-1990 edited by Rima Schultz and Adele Hast, published by Indiana University Press in 2001.\n\nCWHC houses resources that can be used by future scholars, teachers, students, filmmakers, new media professionals and those interested in researching Chicago and women’s history. The process of doing this project, and the products it produces, will help restore Chicago women’s rightful place in the history of social activism. In addition, the project will empower future generations of people as they use it to trace their activist roots and learn from and be inspired by the vital work of Chicago women.\n\nGolden Hour at Epiphany:\n\nStop by Epiphany for Golden Hour beforehand for free live music, drinks and lite bites in the Café Bar!

Voice Box features the wildly entertaining Mistress of Ceremonies, Maureen Muldoon, who curates a raucous evening of storytelling with a musical twist. Cathy Richardson, lead singer of Jefferson Starship launches the program with her song and theme “It’s About Time,” which inspires a story that in turn, inspires a spontaneous music response by Richardson. Described as a “story, a slam, a song, a serenade, a surrender,” Voice Box in Epiphany’s intimate Sanctuary performance space is a place to be heard and hear about the human condition.\n\nVOICE BOX STORYTELLING is being presented as part of Epiphany’s inaugural FEST of US! festival on August 10: A multifaceted art, music and entertainment experience that transcends ‘otherness’ and celebrates the community in US!\n\nAbout Maureen Muldoon\n\nMaureen is an international speaker, writer, storyteller, and songbird who believes in the miraculous power of storytelling. She helps people tell their truth to expand their reach, leave their mark, and honor their lives. Her career began working in TV & film as an actress, writer, and producer, co-starred and guest-starred on shows like Dexter, CSI, and ER. She has been murdered by Brian Dennehy, seduced by Pierce Bronson, and turned into a monkey, a junkie, a jewel thief, and a thousand jilted lovers. But that’s just show biz. Maureen is an award-winning writer who has authored four books. Currently, she hosts writing retreats and spiritual adventures, taking creatives and spiritual seekers to sacred locations domestically, internationally, and, of course, internally.\n\nAbout Cathy Richardson\n\nIt’s hard to think of any musician who’s had a more varied career than Chicago-based singer Cathy Richardson; from scrappy indie rock singer selling albums out of her car to commercial jingles, off-Broadway stage productions to fronting Jefferson Starship and a variety of side projects, she also picked up a Grammy nomination along the way. The twists and turns of her career feel impossible to follow, and incredibly unlikely, but are owed to the vast range of Richardson’s dynamite-packed vocal cords and her dogged perseverance to achieve goals she set as a teenager.\n\nGolden Hour at Epiphany:\n\nStop by Epiphany for our live music series concerts, and be sure to hit Golden Hour before-hand for drinks and lite-bites!

Whether from appearing weekly on some of the hottest party flyers throughout the Midwest or because you had a copy of his now infamous mix tape, “Love Nation” sold out of all the local record stores, the name Julio Bishop is synonymous with jacking dance floors since 1987.\n\nGetting his start as a dancer and DJ in Chicago’s nightclubs and warehouses, but soon expanding his influence; from NYC to LA, to the beaches of Miami, Puerto Rico and Mexico, Germany and Sicily, Julio has been bringing his deep, mystifying grooves to the world for over 3 decades. His intimate knowledge of classic Afro-Latin and Jazz, , as well as his acquired proficiency of Disco, Electronica, Club & Deep House takes his sets far outside the realm of what is attainable by a greener selection of DJ’s.\n\nFunneling his talents into the studio in the early 2000’s, Julio helped launch RealDEEP Recordings, along side label partner Brian Cullen (aka Bjak) where, together they paved the way to further coproductions and solo projects on labels such as Deep Explorer Music (Madrid) and Eargasmic Recordings (Chicago).\n\nWith more releases on the way and a selection of upcoming gigs scheduled between Chicago. Puerto Rico, LA & Hawaii, you’ll want to keep your eyes peeled for what’s to come next from this proved House Music veteran.\n\n44: The Obama Musical\n\nDate: Saturday, August 17, 2024\n\nDoors: 5PM for Golden Hour\n\nShowtime: 7:30PM\n\nTickets: VIP Table for 2 or VIP table for 4 (First two rows) - $129 per person\n\nVIP table for 2 or VIP table for 4 (Rows 3 & 4) - $99 per person\n\n*VIP tables are sold as tables of 2 and 4.
