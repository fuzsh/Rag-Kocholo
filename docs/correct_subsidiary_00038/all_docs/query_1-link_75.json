        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n“Entrepreneurship is a process of learning” (Minniti and Bygrave, 2001). Entrepreneurs can profit from particularly rich learning in the aftermath of critical events (Cope, 2011). One of the most critical events an entrepreneur can face is failure (Espinoza-Benavides and Díaz, 2019)—the closure of a business that does not meet a minimum threshold for economic viability (Cope, 2011; Ucbasaran et al., 2013). Given the considerable degree of uncertainty and ambiguity associated with entrepreneurship, failure is a common phenomenon (Politis, 2008; Sarasvathy, 2001). Entrepreneurial learning from failure is therefore important for practitioners and a topic that has recently gained traction in research.\n\nIn practice, entrepreneurial learning is important, as it improves the individual’s stock of knowledge. The knowledge acquired through failure can, under certain conditions, facilitate successful entrepreneurial re-emergence. Moreover, failed entrepreneurs may profit from learning outcomes in other occupational contexts and when coping with subsequent critical events. From a research perspective, entrepreneurial learning from failure is interesting for at least three reasons. First, failure, despite having gained considerable research interest recently, still constitutes an emerging field with a number of questions to be answered (McGrath, 1999; Ucbasaran et al., 2013). Second, the application of learning theories to the context of failure may not only improve our understanding of failure but also yield opportunities to further advance learning theory. Third, research into how entrepreneurs learn from failure responds to the call for more research that facilitates a dynamic view of entrepreneurship (Cope, 2005).\n\nResearch on entrepreneurial learning from failure emerged more than fifteen years ago (Shepherd, 2003), gaining momentum in the last few years (more than half of all studies on the topic have appeared in 2015 or later). As initially noted by Shepherd (2003), research provides rich evidence that failure yields opportunities for learning but at the same time represents a difficult context in which to learn. While some interesting insights about the learning mechanism can be found in qualitative overview studies (Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2018; Cope, 2011; Frota Vasconcellos Dias and Martens, 2019), most research is situated in highly specialized sub-fields and discusses the influence of particular single factors on learning from failure. These factors include the individual’s initial stock of knowledge (Huovinen and Tihula, 2008; Politis, 2005; Politis and Gabrielsson, 2009), personality traits such as narcissism (Liu et al., 2019), the attribution of the failure to particular causes (Eggers and Song, 2015; Walsh and Cunningham, 2017; Yamakawa et al., 2015) and emotions (Dias and Teixeira, 2017; Shepherd, 2003; Shepherd et al., 2009). As learning is not complete until the resulting knowledge is applied to a new (entrepreneurial) context (Yamakawa and Cardon, 2015), scholars also address factors influencing knowledge transfer. Findings suggest that mindfulness of knowledge transfer (Rerup, 2005) as well as the proximity between the two ventures in time and industry (Eggers and Song, 2015) influence learning effectiveness.\n\nExisting research thus provides deep insights into many of the elements that shape the process of entrepreneurial learning from failure. However, the high degree of specialization of many of these research endeavors leads to a fragmentation of the field (Nogueira, 2019). This, in turn, limits the progress of research, as scholars struggle to build appropriately on the work of others and to identify clear directions for future endeavors. We acknowledge the valuable review works that have been conducted by Ucbasaran et al. (2013) and Wang and Chugh (2014). However, these studies address entrepreneurial learning from failure as merely one facet of a broader research context (Ucbasaran et al., 2013: entrepreneurial failure; Wang and Chugh, 2014: entrepreneurial learning). Further, at the time of their publication, less than half of the current literature in the field existed. As a consequence, the fragmentation of the literature on entrepreneurial learning from failure requires fresh consideration, and additional review work is necessary for the further development of the field.\n\nThe present paper is aimed at addressing these issues. Systematic review methodology is applied to collect and critically evaluate existing literature (Short, 2009; Tranfield et al., 2003) using the databases EBSCO and Web of Science. The final sample of 40 articles is organized and discussed from a processual perspective that is informed by Kolb’s (1984) theory of experiential learning. Kolb (1984) identifies four stages that an individual must go through in order to learn effectively from an experience: concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization and active experimentation. In this review, literature findings are classified according to these stages to generate a theory-guided, processual overview of the field. Through a comparison of what should be covered in each stage according to experiential learning theory (Kolb, 1984) and what is actually discussed in the existing literature, avenues for future research are derived. Our results reveal that the existing research – while in different intensities and a dispersed manner – thematizes all stages of the experiential learning process (Kolb, 1984). Particularly well elaborated are the nature of failure and its triggering effect for reflection, specific factors influencing reflection (emotion and attribution), the contents of the resulting learning (e.g. person-, venture- or relationship-oriented) and their application in entrepreneurial re-emergence. Under-researched are alternative recovery modes (e.g. epiphanies), personal characteristics (e.g. resilience and narcissism) and their impact upon reflection. Further, the cognitive processes underlying reflection itself and especially the transformation of failure-based observations into logically sound concepts have not adequately been covered so far. Likewise, little attention has been paid to the application of learning in non-entrepreneurial contexts. With these insights, the present review contributes to research on entrepreneurial learning from failure in at least two ways. First, it provides what is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive overview of the process of entrepreneurial learning from failure—one that, moreover, results from a systematic literature search and is informed by a clear theoretical background. Second, it identifies promising avenues for further research to build a foundation for future research endeavors.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. First, the theoretical background and conceptual understanding of entrepreneurial learning and failure are given. Second, the methodology, in particular the systematic review approach, is presented. Third, the findings from the literature, which are processual in their focus and guided by theory, are provided. Fourth, the status quo of the research field is critically discussed. Based on this discussion, fruitful areas for future research are proposed and the practical implications of the study, as well as its limitations, are considered.\n\n5. Discussion and future research\n\nThis review aims to take stock of research on entrepreneurial learning from failure and to identify promising avenues for future research. Existing knowledge, which appears to be fragmented, is mapped in the light of experiential learning theory. Utilizing Kolb’s (1984) experiential learning model, we assign and structure the literature according to four stages of learning (see Table 2) that range from the initial experience of business failure to the eventual application of lessons learned in, for example, a new entrepreneurial episode. This theory-guided approach allows scholars to systematically detect overlooked questions and contradictions within existing research.\n\nAccording to Kolb (1984), the first learning stage starts with the “concrete experience.” In the context of this study, this stage comprises the business failure and the entrepreneur’s immediate reaction to this event. Regarding failure itself, existing knowledge is rather comprehensive and concerns conceptual issues (Jenkins and McKelvie, 2016) as well as the criticality of such events and the potential they create for learning (Cope, 2011). Previous research shows substantial individual differences in perceptions of failure (Dias and Teixeira, 2017; Frota Vasconcellos Dias and Martens, 2019). Nevertheless, there is broad agreement that it is not the event itself that determines how critical a business failure is but rather how it is perceived subjectively and the individual attitude taken to the failure (Cope, 2011; Ucbasaran et al., 2013). Mainly drawing on its criticality, research appears convinced of the learning potential that failure bears (e.g. Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2018; Cope, 2011; Eggers and Song, 2015; He et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2007). Regarding the entrepreneur’s immediate reaction to failure, however, knowledge is limited.\n\nBased on these findings, two important avenues for future research emerge. First, investigating the entrepreneur’s immediate reaction (cognitive, emotional, activity-oriented) to business failure appears relevant, as different reactions can lead to different coping strategies and processes of emotional recovery (Byrne and Shepherd, 2015). Contrasting the immediate reaction and the later process of reflection may enable researchers to detect trajectories that have an explanatory character for subsequent learning outcomes. A study of these trajectories should preferably apply a longitudinal research design. Second, research is needed to better understand the determinants that shape the perception of the criticality of business failure. As a starting point, the papers by Lindh and Thorgren (2016) and Morris et al. (2012) may elucidate critical event recognition in the entrepreneurial context. Morris et al. (2012, p. 19), for instance, suggest that the significance of an event is “a function of an event’s novelty, expectedness, and consistency with the individual’s assumptions and knowledge base.” Further research linking the entrepreneur’s identity and biography with the recognition of business failure could prove illuminating in this regard.\n\nThe second stage in Kolb’s learning process, “reflective observation,” features the deliberate and detailed sensemaking of the experience. With 25 studies in our sample exploring aspects of this stage, the stage of reflective observation is the one that has attracted the most scholarly attention so far. Studies frequently utilize “reflection” as an umbrella term that covers reflective observation and abstract conceptualization. In most studies, knowledge of reflection has emerged as a side product, as research endeavors are mainly concerned with particular factors (such as emotions or attribution) influencing reflective observation (Eggers and Song, 2015; Huovinen and Tihula, 2008; Liu et al., 2019; Shepherd, 2003). A prominent part of such studies is dedicated to the role of emotions in the process of recovery from failure. Mostly, they are concerned with the recovery from grief (Cope, 2011; Shepherd, 2003). Singh et al. (2015) offer an alternative path to emotional recovery that builds on the abolition of stigma. In addition, a number of scholars provide evidence for alternative reactions such as emotional resilience or immediate re-engagement in a new entrepreneurship episode (Corner et al., 2017; Pretorius and Le Roux, 2011). To a limited extent, these studies also provide links to other influencing factors and later learning outcomes (e.g. Walsh and Cunningham, 2017).\n\nOur analysis reveals at least four avenues for future research on reflective observation. The first one concerns alternative trajectories of the influence of emotional factors. Corner et al. (2017) found patterns of resilience that lead to a different emotional impact and development pattern. An explanatory, longitudinal study that examines the individual’s emotional status and its impact on willingness and ability to reflect could unveil the existence of a variety of different trajectories for how emotions and reflection interact over time. Another related phenomenon to be analyzed is the pattern of immediate entrepreneurial re-emergence without reflective observation (as shown by Pretorius and Le Roux, 2011). Specifically, it appears interesting that a lack of emotional impact or a deliberate decision to overcome negative emotional feelings might drive the immediate entrepreneurial re-emergence. Second, the concept of a process of critical reflection that requires oscillation between managing negative emotions and reflecting on the failure (Cope, 2011) appears to conflict with the concept of epiphanies (Singh et al., 2015). A qualitative study could compare these mechanisms, considering the spheres of emotion, reflection and learning. Third, we encourage future researchers to heed the call issued in several studies (e.g. Cope, 2011; Jenkins and McKelvie, 2016; Liu et al., 2019) to examine the role of the social environment (e.g. the family) on reflective observation. This should include the influence on the perception of failure and the emotional response of the entrepreneur. Fourth, the field would benefit from a better understanding of the cognitive process that constitutes reflective observation in a narrower sense. Apart from certain influencing mechanisms (e.g. emotions), reflection still remains a “black box,” which limits our understanding of entrepreneurial learning. The research design of such a study could be geared to those of comparable prior endeavors (Cope, 2003, 2011; Shepherd, 2003; Shepherd et al., 2009).\n\n“Abstract conceptualization”, the third stage in the entrepreneurial learning process, entails the transformation of insights on the specific experience into sound abstract learning outcomes. In the context of entrepreneurial learning from failure, this stage is clearly under-researched. In particular, the question of how failed entrepreneurs transform their observation of an experience into abstract learning is largely unanswered. Existing research on reflection (Cope, 2011; Pittaway and Thorpe, 2012) and sensemaking (Ucbasaran et al., 2013) from failure may provide some insights. However, this research fails to elaborate on the differences between the more reflective process of building a perception of an experience and the creative process of transforming this perception into abstract knowledge (Kolb, 1984). Pertaining to the resulting abstract knowledge—that is, the specific content of the learning—a number of qualitative studies found evidence for learning within the personal, social, venture and entrepreneurial spheres (Cope, 2011; Frota Vasconcellos Dias and Martens, 2019; Mueller and Shepherd, 2016; Singh et al., 2007). However, these findings consider perceived learning outcomes. As we know from the literature of learning in educational contexts, perceived and actual learning can vary dramatically (Bacon, 2016). This difficulty likely also applies in the context of entrepreneurial failure, given the potential for biases stemming from failure attribution, stigmatization, emotional coping and optimism. As Nielsen and Sarasvathy (2016) argue, failure can lead to overconfidence, with the founder erroneously believing the failure was a valuable learning experience. Consequently, the entrepreneur may encounter repeated failures due to inaccurate perceptions of his or her own learning (Pretorius and Le Roux, 2011). Other factors that have to be kept in mind when interpreting reported learning outcomes are the elapsed time between failure and data collection as well as any eventual entrepreneurial re-emergence. Existing research builds on rather heterogeneous cases: for example, in the study by Heinze (2013), interviews were conducted between six months and nine years after the failure event; in the study by Cope (2011), one of eight studied entrepreneurs had re-emerged at the time of the interview.\n\nTo advance our knowledge on this learning stage, we especially encourage future researchers to shed light on the creative process of transforming experience-based insights into logical, sound concepts. So far, little is known about how abstract learning outcomes emerge, which is an important cornerstone for fully understanding entrepreneurial learning (Kolb, 1984). As far as the influencing factors are concerned, some aspects that play an influential role in the second stage (e.g. stock of knowledge, narcissism) may also be relevant for abstract conceptualization. Given the creative dimension of this process (Kolb, 1984), additional influencing factors (e.g. capacity for abstract thinking, creativity) may play key roles. Furthermore, research might follow the example of Walsh and Cunningham (2017) and try to identify links between particular influencing factors and subsequent learning outcome dimensions. With respect to the potential deviations between perceived and actual learning, we do not see a clear direction toward a reliable and valid method of capturing of actual learning outcomes. However, we encourage future researchers to pay closer attention to the credibility of learning outcomes by not only presenting learning contents but also investigating whether the reasoning leading to these contents appears credible. One example of this procedure can be found in Nielsen and Sarasvathy (2016, p. 262), who critically evaluate a statement by a failed entrepreneur and question whether he had “learned the right lesson.”\n\nThe fourth stage of Kolb’s learning process is “active experimentation”—that is, the application of learning outcomes in practice. Research on entrepreneurial learning from failure (e.g. Cope, 2011) recognizes that there are several possible work settings apart from entrepreneurship in which to apply and test abstract learning. However, empirical studies exclusively target the case of entrepreneurial re-emergence (i.e. starting a new entrepreneurial episode). This stream of research flows into four directions. First, scholars are concerned with the question of whether and under what conditions “failed” entrepreneurs decide to re-emerge. Presumed learning effects (Stam et al., 2008), overconfidence (Nielsen and Sarasvathy, 2016; Ucbasaran et al., 2010, 2013), family support (Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2018) and failure ascription (Eggers and Song, 2015; Yamakawa et al., 2015) are identified as factors that influence this decision. Second, the process of transferring abstract knowledge to practical settings is of interest—in particular, the degree of mindfulness in knowledge transfer (Rerup, 2005) and the choice of industry and time for re-emergence (Eggers and Song, 2015; Parker, 2013). Third is a very recent research stream focusing on specific behavioral changes upon re-emergence, such as an increased tendency toward internationalization (Lafuente et al., 2019), proactive strategic actions (Lin et al., 2019) and improved negotiating with venture capitalists (Nahata, 2019). While studies within this stream focus predominantly on the outcome (behavioral changes) and less on the learning process leading to this outcome, they reveal the potential of seeking a more detailed view of how learning influences future behavior. Fourth, scholars attempt to evaluate whether and under what circumstances the application of learning is successful. Findings predominantly support the view that failure can lead to learning and successful entrepreneurial re-emergence. However, there are at least two limitations to be highlighted. One is that studies unanimously stress that this learning mechanism is subject to a number of conditional factors. Another is that learning success is measured via either self-reporting or venture performance indicators (e.g. growth, profit, survival). Hence, as discussed above, self-reported learning builds on learning perceptions that may deviate from actual learning. Taking venture performance indicators as proxies for learning risks neglecting explanatory factors for venture success (e.g. social networks).\n\nFuture research is required to broaden the field of inquiry to encompass alternative processes of active experimentation. These could include employment as opposed to entrepreneurship as well as mentoring and consulting activities. With regard to concrete research aims, existing work on entrepreneurial re-emergence may act as a map offering orientation (i.e. reasons for re-emergence, transfer process, evaluation of learning). In addition, we advocate a fine-grained analysis on the level of learning categories. Not every learning category (e.g. person-related, entrepreneurship-related) or concrete outcome (e.g. awareness of susceptibility to stress; knowledge of the start-up process) may be relevant in every experimentation setting. Recognizing the links between specific learning categories and success in active experimentation may improve our understanding of the kinds of learning that are important for different kinds of re-emergence. Finally, we encourage scholars to follow the example of Lafuente et al. (2019), Lin et al. (2019) and Nahata (2019) and provide more fine-grained research on concrete learning-induced behavioral changes. To further increase the contribution made by such studies, it might be valuable to qualitatively explore the entire (learning) process leading to the modified behavior.\n\nThe identified areas for future research contain a number of interesting questions, which are summarized in Table 3. This overview of research questions also includes references to studies that support a certain research inquiry and/or give detailed methodological suggestions.\n\nOur discussion has revealed a number of fruitful areas for further research. They constitute large, under-explored fields (e.g. the process of abstract conceptualization; alternative ways of applying learning outcomes to new practical settings) and rather intensively studied aspects (e.g. emotional recovery, stigmatization). As a consequence, qualitative, exploratory research designs as well as quantitative ones will be necessary in order to advance our knowledge. In this regard, we advocate for a better adaption of methodological approaches to the longitudinal character of learning from failure. This issue has frequently been raised in existing research (Cope, 2011; He et al., 2018; Ucbasaran et al., 2010; Yamakawa and Cardon, 2015). It is particularly pertinent to qualitative studies, which are prone to recall biases due to single interviews targeting an entire venturing, failing and learning process (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). Future research should—at a minimum—utilize quasi-narrative interview designs to take advantage of narration-based recall advances (Flick, 2018). However, for studies covering longer periods (e.g. the whole process of learning from failure), a design with two or three data collection points is preferable (Holland et al., 2006; McLeod, 2003).\n\nTo sum up, research in its present state offers considerable knowledge of how entrepreneurs learn from failure. However, our analysis has also unveiled a number of blind spots in the research, measurement problems and partly contradictory findings. In general, one may conclude that the earlier stages of the learning process (the failing and the reflective observation on what has happened) have received more attention and study than the later stages (abstract conceptualization and subsequent application of learning outcomes). As a consequence, future research on the earlier stages will build pre-knowledge but will still need to target blind spots and inconsistencies. A fuller understanding of the later stages of the learning process demands broad, exploratory endeavors that particularly target the process of abstract conceptualization and application of knowledge. In sum, one may conclude that learning from failure provides a range of areas for future research. We therefore encourage future researchers to maintain the recent interest in this field, as it yields open questions that are both interesting for research and relevant for practice."
