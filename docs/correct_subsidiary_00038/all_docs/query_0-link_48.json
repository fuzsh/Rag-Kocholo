Daly.commerce[20] was acquired by Agilisys in early 2004. In September 2004, Agilisys changed its name to Infor Global Solutions. On October 20, 2004, Infor announced the acquisition of Lilly Software Associates and its VISUAL Enterprise (now referred to as VISUAL ERP[21]) suite of products.\n\nIn February 2005, Infor acquired MAPICS for around US D$347 million,[10] and subsequently acquired GEAC ERP[10] in 2006[22] for US$1 billion.[10] After a lawsuit filed in May 2006 attempted to halt SSA Global's merger with Infor unless certain shareholder demands were met,[23] Infor later completed the purchase and integrated the company.[24] Golden Gate's early push for acquisitions resulted in Infor having 17,500 customers by the summer of 2006.[10] Also that year, Infor began rewriting industry-specific applications into up-to-date .Net and Java-based application providers.[25] In June 2009, Infor acquired SoftBrands (hotel, spa and entertainment business, because on August 14, 2006, The Softbrands Inc. acquired MAI Systems Corporation[26] together with The LodgingTouch Property Management System[27] of his Hotel Information Systems department[28]) for US$80 Million.[29]\n\nNew management and move (2010â2013)\n\nAfter several acquisitions,[30][31] in October 2010, Infor's board of directors hired a new management team composed of four senior executives from Oracle Corporation, all four of whom joined Infor on the same day.
