        "text": "The first comprehensive survey of the history of divine epiphany as presented in the literary and epigraphic narratives of the Greek-speaking world Presents an interdisciplinary engagement between classical studies, history of religion, anthropology, and sociology References an extensive range of primary sources In ancient Greece, epiphanies were embedded in cultural production, and employed by the socio-political elite in both perpetuating pre-existing power-structures and constructing new ones. This volume is the first comprehensive survey of the history of divine epiphany as presented in the literary and epigraphic narratives of the Greek-speaking world. It demonstrates that divine epiphanies not only reveal what the Greeks thought about their gods; they tell us just as much about the preoccupations, the preconceptions, and the assumptions of ancient Greek religion and culture. In doing so, it explores the deities who were prone to epiphany and the contexts in which they manifested themselves, as well as the functions (narratives and situational) they served, addressing the cultural specificity of divine morphology and mortal-immortal interaction. Divine Epiphany in Greek Literature and Culture re-establishes epiphany as a crucial mode in Greek religious thought and practice, underlines its centrality in Greek cultural production, and foregrounds its impact on both the political and the societal organization of the ancient Greeks. Readership: Scholars and students interested in ancient Greek religion and culture, and also classi\n\nThis paper examines the Greek novel’s engagement with a central aspect of Greek religious experience, namely epiphany. It focuses on “epiphanic situations,” in which epiphanic language and protocols are used to describe the appearance not of a god or goddess, but of an exceptional mortal. Through an examination of the novels’ strategies for narrating the marvelous, it shows that the novels’ use of the epiphanic metaphor is deeply engaged with ancient religious experience, as refracted through the Greek literary tradition. It advances three broad claims: first, that the novelists draw on, engage with, and transform well-established Greek epiphanic conventions; second, that epiphanic situations are so common as to be a convention of the novel that can be remolded and reshaped by different authors to suit their individual narrative strategies; and, third, that epiphany’s emphasis on sight and recognition is implicated with other concerns that have been recognized as central to the nove...\n\nThe Dioscuri—Castor and Pollux—are among the most epiphanic of gods, frequently appearing in battle or to sailors struggling at sea. On Chios, a festival called the Theophania was founded in the third century BC to commemorate an ep-iphany of the twin gods. Indeed, their appearance at the Sicilian battle of the River Sagra c. 540 BC was so well known in Greek—and Roman—culture that it was invoked as a proverbial example of epiphanic manifestation in Cicero's De natura deo-rum (2.1.13); as such, it was the model for several Graeco-Roman battle epiphanies featuring the Dioscuri and their horses, from Postumius' victory at Lake Regillus in 496 BC to Constantine's at the Milvian Bridge in AD 312. The numerous battle ep-iphanies of antiquity have been gathered and assessed by previous scholars (Pfister 1924 and Pritchett 1979). This article posits a new approach to the material, arguing that, because of their fame and ubiquity, epiphanies of the Dioscuri provided a model through which to explore both the validity and visual authority of divine manifestation. The conjuring of divine presence through the physical semeia of the gods is also an important element of the portrayal of the Dioscuri in image form. Representations of these epiphanic gods cover a spectrum of iconicity, ranging from highly anthropomorphized 're-enactments' of their epiphanies (such as the sculptures set up in the Roman forum to commemorate the Lake Regillus victory) to metonymic de-notations of their presence in the form of their polos hats, and sub-iconic depictions of twin stars. This combination of corporeal and cosmic semeia provides a sophisticated commentary upon the cognitive dilemmas raised by epiphany: what kind of bodies do the gods have, how do they reveal these forms to mortals, and how are we to recognize and identify them? As deities defined by dualism—mortals and immortals , gods and heroes, men and stars—the Dioscuri provide a particularly potent model for exploring such issues, for both ancient thinkers and modern scholars of epiphany. This paper explores the epiphanic landscape inhabited by the brother gods Castor and Pollux across a broad range of Greco-Roman cultural artifacts, from theological"
