Please check the Site regularly to see any updates or changes to this Privacy Policy. By continuing to use the Site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.\n\nCollecting Personal Identification Data\n\nIn general, you are not required to provide any Personal Data in order to consult the Site. However, you may elect to contact us by completing the forms provided on the Site or by signing up for resources or our newsletter, in which case we collect your Personal Data. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail address for registration to receive our free newsletters and name, postal address, and credit card information when purchasing our services or products. All of this information is provided to us by you. If you do not provide us with the Personal Data indicated as required in our collection form, we may be unable to process your request.\n\nCollecting Automatically Generated Information (IP Addresses and Cookies)\n\nWe collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Site. For example, we may collect information about the time and date and length of visits to the Site, the web pages viewed during a visit, the links followed, the order of pages viewed, the type of web browser used, the website that referred you to the Site, and the IP address associated with your device, which is the number assigned to the visitor’s device to identify its location on the Internet. We use this data to ensure successful navigation on the Site, and to compile statistical data on the use of the Site.\n\nWe also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a “cookie” to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are small data files that your web browser places on your device for record-keeping purposes when you visit a website that recognize a user’s device and preferences, and can be used to enhance your online experience.

If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you can send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be shared with third parties.\n\nThe Site may include links to other websites and provide access to products and services offered by our third-party partners, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the third party.

You may update your preferences at any time by clicking on the link provided in every email we send you.\n\nInformation Sharing\n\nYour Personal Data will only be processed by our personnel on a need to know basis, including the Communications team.

If you are located outside of the United States, be aware that the information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States to us and/or to one of our Service Providers. Where the processing of your Personal Data falls under the scope of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and it is contemplated that your Personal Data will be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) that do not provide an adequate level of protection, the appropriate safeguards will be implemented to protect your Personal Data in accordance with articles 44 et seq. of the GDPR.\n\nWe will retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed in compliance with this Privacy Policy. To determine the retention period for Personal Data, we will take into consideration the purposes for which it was collected, the amount, the nature, the sensitivity and the applicable legal requirements.\n\nDuring the retention of Personal Data, we take reasonable technical and organizational security measures against accidental or intentional manipulation, partial or complete loss, destruction or unauthorized access by third parties. However, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed as fully secure; so you provide your Personal Information at your own risk.\n\nIf you no longer wish to receive communications from us, you can remove yourself at any time from our newsletters or mailing list by clicking on the unsubscribe link that can be found in every communication that we send you.

Where we have relied on your consent as the legal grounds for processing, you may withdraw your consent at any time. Withdrawal does not invalidate the consent-based processing that occurred prior to withdrawal.\n\nWhen contacting us in connection with any of your rights, you will have to provide sufficient identifying information (e.g., name, address, birth date) before your request can be processed. We may limit or deny access to Personal Data where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by law.
