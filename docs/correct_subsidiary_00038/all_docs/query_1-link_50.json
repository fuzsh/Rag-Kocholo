        "text": "No matter if you’re already advertising or haven’t started yet, begin your preparations well in advance. Analyze the previous year’s insights (if applicable) to identify trends and adjust your inventory levels accordingly. Ensure you have sufficient stock to meet the increased demand during the peak shopping season.\n\nDesign a dedicated landing page for your Store with a seasonal theme. Embrace the holiday spirit, and infuse your creatives with a seasonal atmosphere that resonates with your customers – use relevant colours, themes and imagery. Showcase your top products, discounts and special offers on this page to attract visitors.\n\nHighlight benefits and solutions. Clearly showcase how your product or service can make the experience better for your customers this season. Emphasize the value your brand provides – whether it’s saving time, money or reducing stress.\n\nVideo content can be highly engaging. Amazon’s Video Builder is a tool that allows you to create short videos for your Sponsored Brands ads. Create seasonal or event-themed videos that showcase your products’ features, benefits and how they solve customers’ problems this season.\n\nThe Amazon Ads partner directory can connect you with various service providers who specialize in different creative areas, such as graphic design, content writing, advertising and more. Explore this directory to find partners that align with your project’s needs.\n\nAdd seasonal or event-specific creatives to your ad campaigns and Stores. For Sponsored Products ads, you can change your main product image for the shopping season. For Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Display, use custom creative that’s specific to the season to engage with shoppers and direct them to your Store.\n\nThis season, you may have shoppers who are looking for gifts and some who are looking for products for themselves. Do a new round of keyword research for seasonal keywords, then set up new campaigns with them, highlighting your in-season Amazon standard identification numbers (ASINs).\n\nIf it’s working, leave it be. Continue advertising your best sellers, and keep your campaigns that perform well. Raise the budget of successful campaigns that have been working all year.\n\nIf your main sales driver is Sponsored Products campaigns, focus the majority of your budget on them, and spend the remainder on Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Display. For your bids, tweaking placement stats for entire campaigns can help make a bigger impact than changing bids often.\n\nIf you have deals running this season, remember to promote them in your Store with a product deals tab. If you don’t have deals, remember to use coupons to increase visibility of your products. Coupons help shoppers engage with your ads when they’re looking for savings.\n\nNot every brand or company will see momentum at the same time. You might see stronger sales early in the new year than the year end due to the seasonality of your products. Check your performance from previous years to know when you’re likely to peak.\n\nTake note of what seasonal shopping queries and products are performing differently throughout the season to prepare for next year. If this is your first peak season, track the dates when you saw strong performance. Note the difference in performance attributed to advertising for ASINs with deals vs. without, so you can plan for next year.\n\nPrior to the peak shopping season, make sure your author page has been updated using new Amazon features like Book Recommendations. In Author Central, you can choose your best-selling series starter or stand-alone as the book you recommend new readers consider first. Click on “Reports + Marketing” and then “Book Recommendations” to choose your title.\n\nDuring the peak shopping season, it makes sense to run ads to your most profitable book or series. This is especially true if the book has done well during the same month in previous years.\n\nIf you have a book that is unprofitable during the rest of the year, it will likely remain that way during the peak shopping period. Consider looking into that book’s metadata and the book’s sales page. An improved cover, book description, or “Look Inside” could help to improve future profitability.\n\nSponsored Products automatic keyword/product targeted ads can help relevant readers discover your books. If you’re not receiving impressions and clicks, then you’ll want to ensure your metadata – like your book’s seven KDP keyword phrases and three KDP categories – is relevant to your book and sub-genre. With more shoppers during peak periods, optimizing your metadata could help you avoid getting irrelevant clicks and spending your campaign budget on targets that won’t lead to new readers.\n\nYou can also create Sponsored Products ads to show your ads against the books in your sub-genre during and beyond the season. Start by creating no more than five of these with one target per campaign to ensure that the category targets are only the most relevant to your book. This may help seasonal shoppers looking for a gift in your genre to discover your book.\n\nSponsored Products keyword-targeted ads can help you broaden your reach to readers seeking specific genres or books. You can use book titles, author names, and the terms that readers type in to find certain tropes or sub-genres as the keyword targets for your ads. For example, if shoppers are looking to gift a title to a friend and knows this person likes books with the “enemies to lovers” trope, then your book may be more discoverable during a gifting event if you use relevant keywords.\n\nResearch how your book’s genre will serve you from year-end into the new year. One of the best ways to research which book titles and author names are relevant to yours is to read the reviews of those books. In those reviews, you’ll want to look for mentions of certain character types and other tropes that come up in your book as well. For a deeper dive into those titles, and a better understanding of their relevancy, you can even read the books in their entirety.\n\nIf the majority of your budget isn’t being spent each day in your Sponsored Products category or keyword-targeted ads during the peak season, you’ll want to ensure that you’re targeting the most relevant sub-genres and books. More relevant targeting can help you to spend your budget more effectively.\n\nIf you’re trying to run a Sponsored Products ad for a book and receive a rejection for the book cover, title or book description, consider revising it prior to peak events. Changing the cover or removing flagged words from the title or description could allow future seasonal campaigns to be accepted under the book advertising guidelines. These small tweaks could make a difference in book sales for many peak seasons to come.\n\nIn the U.S., after Black Friday and Christmas could also be one of the best times of the year for KDP authors, because readers have received new Kindle devices or Kindle Unlimited subscriptions as gifts. Remember to get your ads set up before the holiday and keep them running afterwards."
