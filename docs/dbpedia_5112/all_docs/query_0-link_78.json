        "text": "NEW YORK October 25, 2023 – Amidst the shimmering skyline of New York City, the Javits Center played host to an evening that celebrated radio’s illustrious past and its promising future. The occasion was the NAB Marconi Radio Awards, held on October 25, 2023. An event that, for many in the industry, is much more than just an awards ceremony.\n\nNamed in homage to Guglielmo Marconi, the Nobel laureate and pioneer of wireless communication, the Marconi Awards have been a cornerstone of radio broadcasting recognition since their inception in 1989. These awards serve as a chronicle, tracing the evolution of a medium that has been a steadfast companion to its listeners, from the golden age of radio to today’s digital era.\n\nThis year’s Marconi Awards, seamlessly woven into the fabric of the NAB Show New York from October 24-26, was not merely a showcase of talent. It was a poignant reflection on radio’s unparalleled ability to inform, entertain, and inspire, transcending boundaries and generations. With Emmy-nominated broadcaster Rich Eisen as the esteemed host of the 2023 NAB Marconi Radio Awards, this illustrious event, sponsored by Xperi, was a highlight of the NAB Show New York.\n\nAdding to the evening’s electric atmosphere, renowned record producer and radio host DJ Scratch, whose performance at the previous year’s event captivated a sold-out audience, returned as the house DJ, delivering an unforgettable auditory experience for attendees.\n\nThe 2023 Marconi Awards was a star-studded affair. ABC Audio’s Déjà Vu and Steven Portnoy joined the evening’s presenter lineup, bringing their unique flair and expertise to the event. They were joined by Dana Cortez, the charismatic host of “The Dana Cortez Show.” Sheri Lynch, the beloved voice behind “Bob and Sheri,” guiding attendees through an evening dedicated to celebrating the pinnacle of radio excellence.\n\nSpecial Awards Spotlight: Broadcasting Legends James Brown and Diane Sutter Honored\n\nThe NAB was proud to bestow its highest honor, the 2023 Distinguished Service Award, upon Hall of Fame CBS sportscaster James Brown. Brown’s illustrious career and unparalleled contributions to sports broadcasting made him a fitting recipient of this prestigious accolade.\n\nIn a highlight of the evening, Diane Sutter, the visionary president and CEO of ShootingStar Broadcasting, was honored with the 2023 National Radio Award. This recognition was a testament to Sutter’s indomitable spirit and her significant contributions to the radio broadcasting industry.\n\nThe 2023 NAB Marconi Radio Awards, sponsored by Xperi, was an evening of grandeur, celebrating the best and brightest in radio broadcasting. As the industry converged on New York, the awards served as a beacon of excellence, shining a light on those who have elevated the world of radio, and a testament to radio’s indomitable spirit.

It was evident that the significance of the Marconi Awards lies not just in the accolades but in the stories they tell. Stories of radio stations that have become community pillars, of groups of people so committed to their local communities, of on-air personalities who have resonated deeply with their audiences, and of a medium that has consistently adapted to the changing tides of time. For the recipients, the award is both an acknowledgment of their contributions and a reminder of their commitment to a legacy that spans over a century.\n\nAs we stand on the cusp of a new era in broadcasting, with technological advancements reshaping the media landscape, the Marconi Awards stand as a beacon, illuminating the path forward. They serve as a reminder of radio’s enduring relevance and its unwavering commitment to its listeners.\n\nIn the grand tapestry of media, each Marconi Award represents not just a thread; but a vibrant hue, adding depth and texture to the story of radio. A story that, much like the city that hosted this year’s awards, is ever-evolving, dynamic, and timeless.\n\nAbout NAB Show New York\n\nNAB Show New York is the most efficient and diverse event experience on the East Coast for the broadcast, media and entertainment industry, held October 24-26 (Exhibits October 25-26) at the Javits Center.
