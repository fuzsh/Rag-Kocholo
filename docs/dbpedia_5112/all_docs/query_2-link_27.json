        "text": "NPR'S JARL MOHN: Broadcast Radio Is The Cockroach Of Media. You Can't Kill It\n\nTHE MOUTH, FEBRUARY 10TH, 2015 –– NPR CEO Jarl Mohn, longtime broadcast radio's Lee Masters, must be exuding a lot of panache these days. On the heels of monster successes such as 'Serial' and the recent blockbuster 'Invisibilia,' he has a lot to be happy about. In a lengthy interview with current.org's Ben Mook, when responding to a prediction that Vivian Schiller had made when she was NPR’s CEO, Mook quoted her as saying the Internet radio would be replacing terrestrial radio within ten years. 'We’re now five years into that decade. What’s your prediction about the future of terrestrial vs. Internet radio? Mohn: Broadcast radio is the cockroach of media. You can’t kill it. You can’t make it go away, it just gets stronger and more resilient. That doesn’t mean that I see digital radio as a passing fad. It’s for real. I’m a huge Spotify user. I think it’s a great service, but I use broadcast too.\" With regard to commercial radio, Mohn said, \"It’s suffering right now, in part because of the incredible consolidation and cost-cutting that has occurred in the business. There’s less room for creativity, innovation and local relevance. Most often, it’s not live .. Over-the-air commercial radio is not as good as it can be.\" Mohn added, 'We are in the golden age of the spoken word, whether it’s about news, culture or science. Some of it’s going to be on broadcast, and some will be digital. It’s not an either-or. The radio listeners and digital users aren’t making either-or choices. Mohn’s background includes managing and owning radio stations, working as a program director, managing VH1 and MTV, and holding the chief executive job at E! Entertainment. Consultant Walter Sabo, a friend of Mohn, told Jockline, “Jarl Mohn is an amazing man. He grew from progressive rock DJ and programmer at WLRS in the 1970’s to a formidable media visionary. I would pay close attention to what he says about NPR and its appeal.\" READ COMPLETE ARTICLE HERE\n\nFirst-Ever On-Stage Focus Group Of Talk Listeners Reveals Key Insights\n\nWhile there was an overall feeling that talk radio could do some things better, there was a clear love of the product\n\nTHE MOUTH, FEBRUARY 10TH, 2015 –– NuVoodoo Media Services has released the findings of a live focus group of talk radio listeners conducted on stage at the Talk Radio Boot Camp on Saturday, February 7, at the W Hotel in Buckhead/Atlanta. Carolyn Gilbert, President of NuVoodoo Media Services and Leigh Jacobs, Executive Vic e President, Research Analysis for NuVoodoo Media Services, conducted a live focus group of talk radio listeners in front of a room of talk radio managers, consultants, programmers and hosts. Panelists were men and women, aged 40-54, who were active talk radio listeners from Atlanta who were comfortable speaking in front of a room full of people. There was no mirror or video camera between respondents and viewers. Gilbert and Jacobs moderated the panel that later took live questions from the industry heavyweights in attendance. The eight panelists represented a balance of Conservatives and Liberals, but even the Liberals admitted to spending time with the more Conservative-leaning talk hosts. Conversely, the Conservatives in attendance were aware of offerings on NPR and several referenced shows they listen to regularly on the local NPR station. While those in the room reaped the full benefit of experiencing the comments and insights shared by the respondents, several themes lit up the session: Among the findings, there was dissatisfaction with the existing state of conservative-oriented talk and the feeling that if you hear any of the shows on a particular day, you have heard them all. Many complained about too much political talk and praised host such as Clark Howard for bringing up topics and information they found interesting and useful. Several others mentioned the boredom of a string of callers who do nothing more than agree with the host. While there was an overall feeling that talk radio could do some things better, there was a clear love of the product and a passion for myriad variations of the talk format. For more information about these findings, contact Carolyn Gilbert at NuVoodoo Media Services at 888.9VOODOO (888.986.6366) and at cg@nuvoodoo.com.\n\n[WATCH] Domestic Violence Advocates Up In Arms Over Radio Host Being Served Divorce Papers On-Air\n\nTHE MOUTH, FEBRUARY 10TH, 2015 –– Domestic violence advocates are up in arms following Real Radio 104.1/Orlando's Russ Rollins being served divorce papers on-air.

She's now demanding transcripts of the radio show in her legal battle. Channel 9's Steve Barrett contacted the station to ask if it was taking domestic violence issues seriously. Carol Wick, CEO of domestic violence shelter Harbor House, said the station may need a better domestic violence policy. \"I think this is the kind of thing that happens when companies don't have those kinds of policies in place.\" In recorded video, there's a look of shock on his face, Barrett said. Rollins' estranged wife said she, too, has received threats from those who believed the videotaped stunt. According to WFTV, Rollins has not commented on the incident other than on his radio show. He has not been charged with domestic violence.\n\nABC News Radio To Offer Special 2015 Tax Tips Programming\n\nTHE MOUTH, FEBRUARY 10TH, 2015 –– ABC News Radio Offers Special 2015 Tax Tips Programming Hosted by ABC News Correspondent Richard Davies & ABC News Chief Business and Economics Correspondent Rebecca Jarvis 30-Part Feature Series Available Now ABC News Radio has launched its annual Tax Tips series, tackling all the tough tax topics to provide listeners with a wide range of helpful information when filing for returns this year.
