        "text": "Due in large part to changing river patterns, a portion of Mound A of the Shiloh Mound complex and Shiloh National Military Park is eroding into the Tennessee River. Mound A is one of the largest Mississippian period Indian mounds in the Tennessee River Valley, and one of the largest mounds on National Park Service land. The mound and village complex were built in the centuries immediately following A.D. 1000, when the site was the political and ceremonial center of a society dominating this part of the region. Engineering studies demonstrated that Mound A was seriously threatened by erosion, and that, regardless of whatever stabilization and mitigation efforts were employed, at least 25 or more feet of the mound and adjoining bluff line in the site area would be lost to erosion. The archeological project reported herein was undertaken to mitigate, in part, the damage brought about by the ongoing erosion in the vicinity of Mound A, and focused on the area of direct impact, or near-certain loss. The excavations conducted from 1999–2004 recovered information from the top to the bottom of the mound on the east side, a vertical span nearly 7 meters in height on the south end and 9 meters on the north side. Seven major construction stages and over 600 features were found in the portion of Mound A examined.The archeological investigations were multidisciplinary in nature and took place over five field seasons (1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004). Intensive remote sensing and archeological testing programs were conducted in the vicinity of Mound A and to a lesser extent elsewhere over the mound complex in 1999 and 2001. These followed by planning workshops held in mid-2000 and early 2002 involving a number of scholars and land managers to decide how to proceed. A large scale archeological mitigation program was started and partially completed from 2002–2004, with the vast majority of the fieldwork occurring in 2002 and 2003. evidence for the construction and use of Mound A found during the 1999–2004 excavations is recounted stage by stage, including occupation surfaces, structures, individual features, and major construction episodes. Geoarcheologically-based interpretations of how the mound was built and used are presented, together with analyses of the material remains found associated with each stage. These include the results of radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dating, analyses of the soil chemistry of occupation surfaces and summary discussions of the lithic, ceramic, and paleosubsistence remains (i.e., carbonized plant remains, bone, phytoliths, and shell) found in the deposits. Additional analyses document the carbonized textiles found in the deposits.\n\nCrystal River (8CI1) is one of Florida's most famous archaeological sites. Yet, after over a century of investigations, its place in the history of Florida and the southeastern United States is not well understood. Crystal River is an important example, in terms of world archaeology, of a monumental landscape constructed by complex hunter-gatherer-fishers along the coast of the southeastern United States. Here, we present the results of our remote sensing program at the site. This research includes topographic mapping, a resistance survey, and ground-penetrating radar transects over various architectural components at the site. These data lend insight into the scale and rapidity of landscape modification at the site, as well as information on the location of previous archaeological excavations and modern disturbances. Further, the data illustrate the potential of shallow geophysical survey to the investigations of shell architecture."
