        "text": "D\n\nD, Gary: KDAY, 1986-90. Gary Lynn Dillard started as an intern at KDAY and worked his way up to dj. He passed away in 1994.\n\nD, Johnnie: KBBT, 1995-99. During the daily cacophony that surrounds us as we drive throughout the Southland, no matter the radio station we listen to, we hear a constant hum of traffic reports, traffic jams and the occasional freeway closures. We hear about traffic accidents and Sigalerts and always think these wrecks involve strangers. On May 10, 1999, at 4 a.m. a drunk driver got on the 91 freeway going the wrong way and ran head-on into Johnnie (Nichols), KKBTs Street Team Supervisor, and killed him. Stacy Cunningham, \"the Beats\" promotion field manager said, \"Johnnie was the very best person you could ever meet ever! He was the best worker all around. He had integrity. He was honest, optimistic and everyone loved being around him.\" Johnnies dream was to be an actor and he was juggling two jobs to pursue his dream. In addition to the KKBT job he worked at UPS during the all-night hours and still managed to pick up his daughter every afternoon after school. He grew up in Carson. \"Johnnie and I started at the radio station on the same day in 1995. He was just the best,\" said Stacy. He was 31.\n\nD, Kenny: KACE, 1979-80; KABC, 1995-96; KRLA, 1997-99. Kenny became the night jock for an Internet radio station, SoulRadioCoast2Coast.com that has since folded.\n\nOne of the KKDJ djs (T. Michael Jordan) remembers, \"Rick asked Steve to do weekends at KKDJ and did for a very short time. He froze and sounded like crap. Rick wanted to axe him, but we all got the ax first and Steve went off to do big and wonderful things.\" He went to Detroit and made headlines when he faked a suicide attempt, which prompted the arrival in the studio of several fire rescue units. In early 1981, Rick Carroll brought him to KROQ from WLUP-Chicago, and the Pasadena outlet was to be the flagship for a nationwide network. “I was fired from WLUP and never started on KROQ.” He also worked for WDAI (the call letters stand for Detroit Auto Industry) and in Milwaukee. The roly-poly morning jock/performer also worked at WLS-Chicago and has been a major force in the Windy City radio wars. In the mid-1980s he commanded as much as $20,000 per appearance for his satirical live concerts. He played a dj in Grandview USA, starring Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nIn 1989, he was given the Father of the Year Award following an on-air vasectomy.Sometimes Steve's routines flirted with bad taste. In his nightclub act, he would sing an Elvis parody, Heart Attack Hotel, ending the number by collapsing on stage.He has worked for a number of Chicago stations and today works afternoons at WLS (AM). He was elected to the Radio Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nDallas, Paul: KPFK, 1966-68; KABC. The former manager of KPFK and host of \"Thinking Allowed,\" died in 1984. He was also an assistant program director under Bruce Marr at KABC in the late 70's & early 80's. He wrote a book about his experience as general manager at KPFK called Dallas in Wonderland. \"He was truly one of the good guys in radio,\" said colleage Michael Benner.\n\n(Kenny D, DJ Syphe and DLux, Frankie DiVita, and Mike Dowler)\n\nIn 1992 he lost his voice and an operation on his nodules was required. In preparation for the operation, it was discovered that he had diabetes, a heart problem and cirrhosis of the liver. \"The doctor told me that if I had one more drink or one more cigarette, I would die.\" For much of the last half of the 1990s, he went on to work with youngsters at a pre-school in San Rafael. \"He was singular,\" said Ben Fong-Torres, author of The Hits Just Keep On Coming.\n\n\"Bobby had a jazz soul; a love of music ranging from pop to blues, folk & jazz. He loved breaking away from Top 40 and into the freedom he found at KSFO on the all-night shift and at the FM stations KSAN and KOFY. But even at Top 40, he was always his own guy, totally improv and off-the-wall, doing WC Fields/Lord Buckley-inspired riffs, goofing with live spots, and being so unpredictable that Chuck Blore once called him the worst dj he'd ever heard, and then, months later, hearing him again, declaring him one of the best.\" Ben talked with Bobby two weeks ago. \"All in all, I've had a pretty good ride,\" Bobby told Ben. When Ben asked how he was feeling, facing death and all, Bobby said, \"I'm feeling fine, cracking jokes, you know. I don't know what else to do.\"\n\n(Captain Dale Dye, and Jeff Dean)\n\nDALE, Sharon: KFOX, 1979-81; KMGG, 1981-83; KOST/KFI, 1983-2000; KABC, 2001-10. For many year Sharon hosted the \"Hill & Dale Show\" on LA Talk Radio.\n\nBorn on February 21, 1951, in Lawrence, Kansas, she grew up in Brunswick, Maine. While attending the University of Maine in 1970, Sharon first fell in love with radio while visiting the campus station. She started her professional career in Bangor as a Top 40 dj, and is recognized as one of Maine’s first female broadcasters.\n\nIn the Southland, she made her mark as a traffic reporter. Sharon was the news/public affairs director at KFOX and joined \"Magic 106\" as part of the morning team of London & Engelman. Sharon spent 17 and a half years at KOST, where she was part of the morning team with Mark & Kim. She also hosted weekend public affairs shows at KOST.\n\nOnce Clear Channel bought the stations, Sharon became a casualty of consolidation and lost her job in the fall of 2000. Sharon went on to work at Metro/Shadow news and traffic. She has collected three Golden Mikes and spends her spare time helping her husband Bill at is percussion shop called “Noisy Toys” near LAX.\n\nDALTON, Don: KFI/KOST, 1982-84. Don, the former general manager at KFI/KOST, suffered a brain aneurysm the same day that the stations airborne traffic reporter Bruce Wayne's plane went down on June 4, 1986.\n\nDALTON, Rich: KWST, 1976-81. St. Louis Radio Hall of Famer \"Radio Rich\" is so popular he has his own Facebook page encouraging him to return to radio. \"I've found out that if you do what you love, what your heart tells you to, it will lead you to the right place.\"\n\nBorn on February 7, 1950, when Dalton was a young boy, his family moved to the Riverview area of St. Louis County. \"I attended St. Catherine of Alexandria Catholic Grade School. I was an altar boy and an Eagle Scout. In a way, it was just like the Cleavers on Leave it to Beaver - except my mom never wore pearls around the house,\" said Dalton.\n\nWith Radio Rich, it seems to be about the music.\" In the late 1970s, when fm radio became an established money-maker, things began to change. \"It became corporate, and we had playlists and formats,\" Dalton said. \"And quite honestly, that crushed the spirit of FM rock radio. It almost killed it. \"I still remember the day when I was told I couldn't play anything from 'Bitches Brew,' a great Miles Davis album. I knew at that point that old FM rock radio would never be the same.\"\n\nDalton left St. Louis and KADI in 1976 to work at KWST (K-WEST). He returned to St. Louis in 1981 and worked for two years at KWK before joining KSHE in 1983. He stayed there for eight years, and then spent three years at KSD. Dalton went off the air in 1995 and did not return until 2002.\n\n\"Around 1995, there was a huge change in the radio business that allowed chains to own stations, and there was this orgy of buying and selling stations. It became even more corporate,\" he said. For seven years, Dalton worked out of a home studio and made a living doing narration work. He also had an Internet radio show.\n\nDALY, Carson: KROQ, 1996-97; KAMP, 2010-17. Carson hosts a late-night network tv show and in early 2010 started doing mornings at AMP Radio until the summer of 2017. He also hosts the enormously popular The Voice (over a decade hosting) and reports every morning on The Today Show. During his time with AMP, Carson appeard on the yearly listing of Best LARP of the year. In 2010, Carson reteamed with pd Kevin Weatherly, his boss at KROQ in the 1990s before Carson went on to a successful tv career. Carson has served as host of MTV’s Total Request Live, Last Call with Carson Daly, the annual New Year’s Eve Times Square broadcast on NBC, and the host of the surprise NBC blockbuster, The Voice.\n\nCarson joined evenings at KROQ in the summer of 1996 from afternoons at KOME-San Jose. He left “K-Roq” in the fall of 1997 for MTV Live, the precursor to TRL. Growing up the youngest of two children in Santa Monica, Carson loved music, but he had thoughts about becoming a professional golfer. In 2017, Carson won the Pebble Beach Pro-Am. He also flirted with the idea of becoming a priest.\n\nIn 1992, he received a partial golf scholarship to Loyola Marymount University and studied theology for a semester. His mother hosted a tv talk show in Palm Springs, and Carson landed a local morning internship at KCMJ. When he got to MTV, he told Teen People, “When I got on the air they were like, ‘We can clean you up a little bit. You take off the baggy pants, take off that stupid T-shirt, take the nose ring out, dye your hair from blue back to black. We can find an all-American boy in you.’ They asked me what designers I liked, and I didn’t even know any. I don’t shop. I’ve never bought a pair of pants, ever.”\n\nCarson has been parodied on Saturday Night Live. Jimmy Fallon, playing Carson, has introduced himself with the line, “I’m Carson Daly, and I’m average in every way.”\n\nDaly, Larry: XERB, 1967. Unknown.\n\nDamage DJ: KRRL, 2015-19. Abdul Mohammend, The REVOLT personality, joined Real 92.3 in the spring of 2015.\n\nDame, Dave: KIKF, 1989-90. Dave is the West Coast Regional Promotion Manager for BNA Records, a Country Music division of RCA. He lives in Orange County.\n\nDAMESHEK, Dave: KSPN, 2007-08. Dave started in afternoon drive at KSPN in late 2007, fresh from the Jimmy Kimmel/Adam Carolla stable of young comedians and talent. Dave was the head monologue writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live since the inception of the late-night ABC talk show in early 2003.\n\nDave grew up in Pittsburgh and has been a lifetime sports fan. “Now to get a chance to do it on ESPN, and this may sound hokey, but I’m over the moon about the idea of talking sports on ESPN Radio in Los Angeles,” he told me by phone. “And that’s what we are going to focus on. Nationally people perceive L.A. not to be the greatest sports town but as a matter of fact I think it is really underrated.\"\n\nDameshek was not shy on addressing the issue of sports talk radio and why the format has failed to garner the kind of ratings that it does in other markets. “As far as I’m concerned, I’m not going to try and reinvent the wheel. I don’t have the hubris to say that we’re going to blaze a whole new trail, but I am going to do things more retro compared to what sports talk radio has largely become. It seems very serious to me more than anything. When I listen to sports radio it seems people take themselves very seriously in their opinions. This is not life or death unless you’re hanging out with Pac Man Jones at a strip club. The show should be fun and whimsical and that’s the way we will approach it.”\n\nIn the summer of 2008, he left his on-air shift and began exclusive podcasts for ESPN. He is currently a football analyst and writer for NFL.com, appearing on NFL Fantasy Live and hosting the Dave Dameshek Football Podcast.\n\nDAMIAN, Patrick: KJLH, 1976-78; KIIS, 1979; KDAY, 1981-82. Patrick Damian Evans was a singer and produced shows in Las Vegas. He passed away on November 26, 2013, while living retired in Rosarito, Mexico, according to his son, Matthew Evans. (Photo from his days at KIIS/fm)\n\n\"Damian started his tenure in radio at KJLH just before Stevie Wonder bought the station.

He was an actor in the 70's in lower budget films such as Cruisin' High also known as Cat Murkill and the Silks. He was a pianist, drummer, and vocalist as well. However, he was a private man who rarely expanded on his history with me. Life was always about moving forward with him and he rarely looked back or shared many stories. After he passed it has been hard to find out about him as records werent as tight as they are now. Seeing him on your site, even in a small pictureless blurb was very fulfilling.\"\n\nDanehe, Dick: KFI, 1970-72.

In fact it was Jim who gave me the name ‘Jack Daniels.’ He was driving me around town on my first night, giving me a quick tour of the city. As we drove along the freeway, we'’ pass a Jack Daniels whiskey billboard about every quarter of a mile it seemed. I remember him asking if I was a teetotaler. After telling him ‘no,’ he asked what I thought about using Jack Daniels as an air name. He reminded me that since the Kentucky bourbon was owned by Early Times, which was headquartered in Louisville, the name would be easily and quickly recognizable for ratings purposes.

On September 20, 2020 he killed himself in the driveway of his home in Auburn, according to his former radio partner Mark Taylor. He was 65.\n\n“He left me his last message on Thursday,” said Taylor. “I called back, but had to leave a message. His cancer was now stage 4 and he was in pain and told his wife he didn't see any way out. We had texted quite a bit and left messages, but I hadn't had a conversation with him in several weeks. His message to me Thursday was fairly upbeat, however he sounded extremely weak.”\n\nGuy grew up in the San Luis Obispo area and worked central California, including a station in Bakersfield, KCUB-Tucson, KISS-San Antonio, KBST-San Diego before arriving in Los Angeles.\n\nGuy was active in voiceover work and he developed a syndicated cigar talk show.

The team broke up in 2000.\n\nIn May 2019, Guy was diagnosed with rectal cancer. His wife, Kris, shared his story in her plea for help.\n\n“Medical bills and co-pays have been overwhelming. Unfortunately we signed up for short-term medical insurance while waiting for Medicare to kick in. We got a letter from our medical insurance stating that Guy’s cancer was preexisting and short-term insurance does not cover his cancer treatment. We are in debt $90,000. The colonoscopy and biopsy caused damage to the tumor which caused severe bleeding. He lost so much blood and was so weak he barely made it. He has had two blood transfusions. He just finished radiation, which did stop the bleeding and gave us hope. He went to Arizona to a natural health clinic to build up his immune and strength, which was all out of pocket cost. Next is hernia surgery than colostomy surgery and chemo.” Kris said it’s been overwhelming and stressful but they were “staying positive!” She concluded: “Guy has said he’s had a wonderful life and radio career. He’s very grateful for the amazing friendships he made along the way. We appreciate your consideration to help!”\n\nDavis, Jay: KEZY, 1961-71; KNX, 1965-67; KGER, 1971-92.

He recounted an experience of being fired. “I've only been fired twice and each time I had a gig before my two weeks notice ran out. Being very unhappy at KNX/fm [just before KODJ and before ARROW 93.1] I accepted a job at K-EARTH. I was escorted out of the building by a CBS' guard! I thought it was very funny at the time - seems even funnier now. Besides, KODJ and KNX/fm have long been gone, along with the geniuses who ran the place, but I'm still here in L.A.” Jeff continued: “I don't mean that to sound bitter because leaving there was the genesis for the great career I've had since. Prior to that time I had a great career at WLS in Chicago. I sort of think of KNX/fm as the small gap in my career. By the way, I know this sounds implausible, but I've never been out of work. When I was let go at KRTH for budgetary reasons, the late Pat Norman, gm at KRTH and a damned fine man, gave me a much bigger severance than is customary. I used that money to launch Jeff Davis Productions, Inc., which today does work for some of America's most recognized stations as well as stations in Canada and 26 stations in the UK. They say you've not really ‘arrived’ in radio until you've been fired. I think that's true.”\n\nDavis, Jeff: KRTH, 1986-88; KPWR, 1988-89; KQLZ, 1991-93; KMPC, 1993-94; KCBS, 1993-94; KFWB, 1994; KNX, 1999-2003; KFRG, 2002-10.

Wilson FM Broadcasters, died on October 9, 2017, as a result of complications of pneumonia coupled with a virulent lung infection. A nicer guy you will never meet.\n\nJohn was my first hire after I had been hired to run 100.3/fm in the early seventies. Investors had purchased KFOX/fm, which was housed in the “Tootsie Roll” building in Long Beach, even though the city of license was Los Angeles. Once the FCC approved the sale, we had to build studios from scratch and move the 100.3 antennae to achieve line-of-sight with a tower in Coldwater Canyon. John orchestrated that move and the building of our studios on the 11th floor at 6430 Sunset Blvd.\n\nWithin a few months, we launched KIQQ (K-100/fm).\n\nSaul engaged the services of John in 1970 to handle the engineering of KKGO/fm, 105.1 and later to concentrate on the station’s transmitter site. John also acted as engineer for launching KRTR/fm-Honolulu and CH 26 UHF TV-Honolulu on the air for Levine’s Mount Wilson FM Broadcasters. “John and I pioneered FM and UHF TV in Hawaii,” said Saul. John continued his services for Saul Levine to the present time.\n\nJohn and his wife, Deanne, made Sierra Madre their home for 50 years. John was born in Los Angeles on June 16, 1933.

He attended USC where he received his Bachelor of Engineering degree in 1955 and his Masters in Engineering in 1959.\n\nDAVIS, Ken: KPPC, 1974-75. Ken is a writer/producer for television.

Some of my fondest memories as a 13-year-old kid hanging out at the old KRLA studios at The Huntington-Sheraton in Pasadena. It was great to later work with Casey Kasem, Charlie O'Donnell and Bob Eubanks after first watching them through the glass at KRLA.\"\n\nDavis, Ken: KUTE, 1986; KOST, 1994. Ken works in a Los Angeles law firm and he's out of radio.\n\nDAVIS, Krickett: KYSR, 1992-93; KMGX, 1993; KCBS, 1993-2000. Krickett left \"Arrow 93\" in January 2000. She is an active VO artist.\n\nKrick's autobiography suggests a budding writer: \"Krickett Davis' circuitous radio career has taken her from the cornfields of Iowa (Council Bluffs) to the star-filled boulevards of Los Angeles. The journey began in 1982, playing heavy metal on the Iowa State University campus radio station KPGY (‘K-Piggy’ to the locals).\" After a few jobs in Des Moines radio, she packed up an air-conditioned U-Haul and headed to Los Angeles. She worked peripheral markets such as Ventura and Lancaster before joining Metro Traffic and Shadow News. While at Shadow, Krickett worked weekends and fill-in on KYSR. Following that, she did weekends at KMGX. Krickett worked at \"Arrow 93\" for two years as a fill-in. During this time she did evenings on WW1's syndicated '70s Channel. For many years Krickett worked early evenings at \"Arrow 93\" and hosted a weekly Led Zeppelin show called \"The Zepp-Zone.\" She has an active voiceover career and worked for the Warner Bros.

Larry is a voiceover artist doing spots and promos for Six Flags, VISA, My Network TV, ABC, Fox Sports, McDonalds, NHL, Gillette, NFL Network and many more. His website is: LarryDavisVoice.com. He also works weekends at K-EARTH.\n\nLarry has an uncanny similarity to Morgan Freeman. Some hear his coal-cellar baritone muttering ‘get busy living, or get busy dying’ in Shawshank Redemption. Or his rumination in The Bucket List that ‘you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you.’\n\nDAVIS, Laura: KNAC, 1976; KLOS, 1976-80. Laura produces electronic press kits for the motion picture business. During her nine years in radio, Laura experienced four AOR-formatted stations during the seventies.\n\nBorn and raised in Pittsburgh, she graduated from Cornell University. It was during her senior year that radio attracted her interest. \"Cornell's student-run station, WVBR, was one of the best anywhere. It was advertiser-supported and treated like a real station. We probably had the lowest grade point average on campus from working regular shifts.\" After college she joined WCMF-Rochester, stopping briefly in Detroit at WABX, before heading to L.A. During her four years with KLOS she worked for four program directors. In 1980 she joined NBC's Source Network where she hosted \"Screen Scenes.\" This experience led in 1983 to an opportunity to produce electronic press kits for Universal Pictures and to start a new career that now encompasses film production. \"I loved radio for the music, concerts, parties and to think you could get paid for it all. At 28 I reached the point when I realized I had nothing left to say about Stairway to Heaven, and I got out.\"\n\nDAVIS, Mac: KZLA, 1999-2000. Mac was a country music singer, songwriter, and actor, originally from Lubbock, Texas. For a few years he hosted a syndicated show that was heard on Country KZLA. Mac died September 29, 2020, at the age of 78, from complications from recent heart surgery.\n\nAt his commercial peak in the mid-'70s, Mac was one of America's most popular entertainers, a countrypolitan-styled singer and actor who found considerable success in both fields. Born Scott Davis on January 21, 1942, in Buddy Holly's hometown of Lubbock, Texas, he began performing in local rock groups while still in his teens.\n\nAfter moving to Georgia, Davis first broke into the music business in 1962. After joining the Liberty label three years later, in 1967 he moved to Los Angeles to head the company's publishing arm, Metric Music Mac began composing his own songs, with Glen Campbell, Bobby Goldsboro Lou Rawls and Kenny Rogers among the artists recording his work. In 1968, Elvis recorded Davis' A Little Less Conversation, and soon after the King was requesting more of his work, which included In the Ghetto.\n\nDavis also arranged the music for Presley's first television special before signing his own recording contract in 1970. In that year, he released his first chart single, Whoever Finds This, I Love You. In 1972, Davis scored a number one pop hit with Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me, which also reached the Country Top 20. In 1979, he also starred in the film North Dallas Forty with Nick Nolte. Davis' success continued in the early '80s. In 1980, he also starred in a TV movie, Cheaper to Keep Her. However, a co-starring role opposite Jackie Gleason and Karl Malden in 1983's disastrous The Sting II effectively ended Davis' career in Hollywood, and by 1985, he had recorded his last Top Ten hit, I Never Made Love (Till I Made Love With You).

In fact, longevity is his middle name, working four radio gigs that cover 37 years. “I've been very fortunate,” said Michael, who spent time at KNAC-Long Beach in the late 1980s as Jack the Ripper. “I owe it all to my parents, grandparents and my family.”\n\nMichael grew up in Minnesota water skiing on the Mississippi River and playing basketball. “We lost the Minnesota State Championship game in double OT in my senior year at Winona Cotter High 1981.” Brown College in Minneapolis was where he went to school and Rocker KAWY-Casper, Wyoming was his first radio job. He was music director and morning drive. In 1984, he joined KFMG-Albuquerque. “It was a ratings monster, consistently in the Top 3 overall out of 40+ stations in the market,” remembered Davis. “I was working evenings and I was music director. It was big time fun with Rock stars coming to our studio, endless concerts and numerous record company junkets out of town.” In early 1989, KNAC was Hard Rock station. “KNAC had a talented staff. On the air and on the Sunset Strip we had a great time. A year later Michael was diagnosed with Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). “My appreciation to Johns Hopkins and the University of Minnesota for their research into this difficult disease.” Michael left KNAC for a three-station group in South Monterey Country and North San Luis Obispo County. “On air fun is the key,” said Michael.\n\nDAVIS, Nawana: KMET, 1975; KPFK, 1973-76.

After completion, Nawana headed to New York City where she did some plays at The American Place Theatre.\n\n\"I started collecting music in those days. It was the great 78's along with working@ the Village Vanguard as coat checker being in company of all the greats,\" she said. Nawana also worked as a waitress at a place called MAX'S where she met Andy Warhol. He brought her to California in 1968 to do a film loved Cali and she stayed.\n\nWhile still collecting music, Nawana started experimenting with old blues music and bluegrass playing Albert King back to back with Bill Monroe, and Memphis Minnie back to back with Lorretta Lynn. \"It sounded great - poor people's music from different sides of the track. I decided to see if I could share this on the airwaves and contacted KPFK and pitched the show to Ruth Hershman. She give me a shot and the show took off. The response was overwhelming. The show ran from 1973 -76 along with KMET. It was some of the best times of my life.\"\n\nNawana is now retired and loves yoga. She is teaching her senior friends and still sharing the music with her friends.\n\nDavis, Pat: KNX. Pat was a well-known broadcast journalist who covered nearly every major story in Northern California since the 1960s. At 6-foot-4, Mr. Davis was an imposing figure in the Sacramento press corps, partly because of his physical size but also because of his tenacity in going after stories. He was described as an aggressive, physically imposing reporter with a skeptical demeanor and a biting sense of humor, often covering stories hundreds of miles apart in a single day. In three decades of stringing for various stations, he covered earthquakes, floods, elections, scandals, and tales of triumph and tragedy. He was a familiar voice on KFBK-Sacramento, his home radio station, as well as KNX, KGO-San Francisco and CBS radio in New York City. Friends and relatives say he was a classic old-school reporter. Born in Milwaukee, Pat worked his way up in the industry. He started as a radio reporter in Fresno, then anchored at a television station in Bakersfield. He also worked as a free-lance reporter for the Los Angeles Times in the 1960s and early 1970s. Pat would regularly take 20-mile bike rides out into the country. On the day of his death, he was returning from one of those rides when he suffered a heart attack and died at the Kaiser Permanente hospital in Roseville. The aggressive newsman who filed news reports from Sacramento died October 1, 1999. Pat was 58.\n\nDavis, Philip: KOCM; KWIZ, 1965-88.

He earned a degree from the business school at the University of Chicago and bought a Schlitz Distributorship in South Central Los Angeles. On the football field he won six NFL championships, two Super Bowls and numerous awards and trophies. He bought KAGB in late 1976 and turned it into KACE and he wanted the radio station to support Inglewood and the community.\n\nMr. Davis played 10 years for the Packers, joining the team in 1960 and becoming a stalwart defensive performer at left end. He was one of the leading disciples of Lombardi, an intense taskmaster and perfectionist who is considered one of football’s greatest coaches. “Perfection is not attainable,” Lombardi said, in one of many maxims attributed to him. “But if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence.”\n\nHe left in February 2009 following ownership change and he now lives in New York where he is a licensed real estate agent buying, selling and renting properties for Bellmarc Realty in New York City. \"I now have three grandchildren, two boys in London and a girl in New York City. Life is good.\"\n\nDawson, Ted: KLOS, 1985. Ted joined KBZK and KXLF-Bozeman, Montana, as sports director in January 2011.\n\nDay, Gene: KGFJ, 1974.

Steve retired once but the pull of radio took him back to WHLC-Highlands, North Carolina where he now does mornings and is operations director for husband/wife owners who just celebrated 27 years of local ownership.\n\nBorn in Washington, DC and raised in Rockville, Maryland, Steve discovered his passion for radio while in his second year at Ashland College in Ohio. From a chance encounter with a programming executive from a station 30 miles from campus, Steve began his daily commute to WGLX-Galion, Ohio. He dropped out of college and during the 1970s worked at WSIR-Winterhaven, Florida, WDAE-Tampa, WDAT-Daytona and WKZL and WTOP-Winston-Salem. While in Winston-Salem he began broadcasting play-by-play sports and reporting sports for a local tv station.\n\n\"We were doing okay but my wife wanted us to be more secure so I got out of radio and joined her father’s insurance business in Rochester.\" The insurance job and the marriage ended, so Steve returned to radio in Rochester at WBBF and WWWG.\n\n\"In 1979 I got the West Coast urge and packed up for San Diego.\" Steve worked weekends on KFMB-San Diego and broadcast sports on KGTV/tv. In the early 1980s, Steve joined the sports department at KTTV/tv Channel 11. In 1983 he partnered with Betty White for the tv game show Just Men. In 1993 Steve was the announcer for ABC’s Caesars Challenge starring Ahmad Rashad. In 1994 he was part of Sony's Game Show Network and hosted several shows.\n\n\"In 1999, Mark Elliott hired me from LA/Westwood One to work in Ventura and Santa Barbara. Steve went to KMGQ (Smooth Jazz), followed by three years at News Radio 1250 Santa Barbara as pd and afternoon drive. “We built a tv studio and simulcast our Talk Show with local sister TV station KEYT-3.”\n\nWhen the owner died, Steve's nomadic journey took him to Washington, DC, and in 2006 in the Western Carolina Mountains at WHLC. \"I love North Carolina. This is a wondrous spot if you love the mountains, lakes, and fishing.\"\n\nDayglo: KNAC, 1983-84. David Daegling is in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Florida.\n\nThe Deacon had to break up the band in 1942 because of World War II. Travel restrictions put a dent in any kind of touring. He was also just over the age of military service, so he and his wife Marge decided to settle down in Cincinnati to try out other opportunities. He began a morning program on WLW. Margie recalled for Mr. Bennett, \"...that the Deacon would appear for the daily show, deliver a brief monologue, act as master of ceremonies to introduce an act or two, and come home.\" One of the regulars on that show was a young singer by the name of Doris Day, who would go on to her own fame, too.\n\nIn 1947, he and Margie moved to Los Angeles. He heard that a radio station in Pasadena was auditioning for a disc jockey opening. He went and applied, that is he and 300 others. A set of radio logs showed that Carl was indeed a hit in Los Angeles. He was doing two shows a week over two different stations. He did a show at lunch time on KGER and then later at night, an hour's show over KXLA.\n\nBut Carl's talents won out over the field for the job at KXLA, now KRLA. He was a natural as a master-of-ceremonies after his many years as a band leader and radio work elsewhere. He also seemed to be a natural as a country and western disc jockey, with an easy style, Arkansas accent and 'homespun humor' helped entrench him in the role.\n\nDuring his dj days, the name \"Deacon\" acquired a new twist as Mr. Bennett related in his article. \"Some of the youngsters, including his own grandchildren, began calling him the \"Squeakin' Deacon.\" The adjective became a permanent adjunct and Carl adopted the new sobriquet for his radio image. The greeting became 'This is the Squeakin' Deacon speakin,' used continuously in his climb to the top ranks of country-western disc jockeys He was one of the pioneer djs to achieve success on the west coast.\"\n\nIn the 1960's, the Squeakin' Deacon had taken his talents to radio station KFOX out of Long Beach. He would do a remote hookup on his daily program and would host many of the great country music stars on his show over the years, such as Cliffie Stone, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Merle Travis and Barbara Mandrell were among the many guests.\n\nThe old Deacon became a familiar figure at high-profile country-western events, often in the role of master of ceremonies. He was also one of the early performers on television, with a daily show on KNBC/Channel 4 in the early 1950s. A 1950 edition of a Billboard Magazine annual poll had him chosen as the \"Favorite Folk Disc Jockey.\"\n\nDuring that time, Deacon owed his success to the popularity of his KXLA \"Home Hour for Western Folks,\" a prime-time hourly broadcast five days each week sponsored by Seaboard Finance Company. The Deacon ranked sixth in the national popularity poll, several positions higher than Tennessee Ernie Ford. In fact, only three djs from the west coast ranked in the top 20. Then, he had two programs, five days a week.\n\nSqueakin' Deacon was a bit of a country philosopher with a bit of a humorous touch. An article we found in an old Cowboy Songs magazine had a few examples of that.\n\nSpeaking of success, he mentioned there is no end to success. He said the toughest part of a career is to just hold on to the success you attained. Success wasn't on merit alone - you need breaks too. He was quoted as saying \"...many a rose has blossomed and never been smelt.\"\n\nAnd what did the Squeakin' Deacon attribute his success? He said, \"The good Lord had been good to me. Without faithful friends, fans and admirers, YOU might as well go back to Arkansas. You don't eat without'em, that's for sure. ... There's good in everybody if you only look far enough.\" Carl continued to maintain his popularity in the country-western field until his retirement in 1969. But he never changed his format, which was essentially the same as that which made him a successful big band leader. Carl \"Deacon\" Moore continued to be the quintessential image of an Arkansas preacher, and his fans loved him in the role. In his article, he notes that Margie recalls the mountain of gifts that would flood their home in observation of birthdays, anniversaries, and important events in their lives. She said that she and Carl remembered those country-western fans as the most generous and loyal they had ever known.\n\nIn 1983, the Deacon was diagnosed with prostate cancer and gradually lost ground to the disease. The Squeakin’ Deacon died February 12, 1985. The complete story of his life can be found at: http://www.hillbilly-music.com/dj/story/index.php?id=1640\n\nDEACON, Tom: KUSC, 1989-92. Tom is retired and he is living in the \"splendours of the Ontario countryside.\"\n\nIn 1992, the Classical music station was embroiled in a lawsuit that centered around the marriage of station president Wallace A. Smith and on-air morning personality Bonnie Grice. According to the LA Times, the former KUSC programming vpice president charged in his suit against USC and Grice that he was fired by Smith without warning, a day after they argued over the quality of Grice's on-air performance. Deacon alleges that he was fired without \"good or sufficient cause\" and that Grice \"interfered with the business and contractual relationship\" he had with Smith. USC, which owns the KUSC license, filed a legal response denying Deacon's charges and citing \"economic factors requiring a reduction in force\" as the reason for his dismissal.\n\nDean, Jeff: KEZY, 1977-79; KLSX, 1985-86; KGGI, 1987-93.

In the summer of 2011, he left for a broadcasting post with the New York Knicks. He left the Knicks after the 2013-14 season. He is currently employed by CBS Sports, calling the NFL, NBA, and college basketball.\n\nThe axiom about never replacing a legend may have been the burden placed on Laker play-by-play guy Paul Sunderland when he joined the Laker booth following the death of Chick Hearn. He joined former Lakers player Mychal Thompson who served as color analyst on radio broadcasts, which were carried on XTRA Sports 570. \"This is one of the great jobs in all of sports and at a tremendous franchise,\" said Spero at the time of his hiring.\n\nSpero was most recently the host of NBA TV's Hardwood Classics, and the NBA ‘Insiders’ - a nightly, live, 60-minute interview program dealing with everything NBA.

Nautica has a weekly show at the Stevie Wonder station, KJLH.\n\n\"While I was in college at San Jose State University, I had a Hip Hop and r&b show on a college radio station 103.3FM KSCU and an internship at a Spanish radio station called 1430AM K-BUENA. Working at KSCU was dope because I got to play the kind of Hip Hop music I loved listening to growing up in New York. Working at K-BUENA was another story because it was a Spanish music format, different from the Salsa I grew up on. So, it was tough not only because of that but because in addition to working on the air, I had to work in promotions, marketing, and programming. Back then, I was like, 'Man! This is a lot of work!' But now, I can look back and be grateful for all I learned because it prepared me for a career in radio that has lasted over 23 years and has taken me from the Bay to LA, where I landed my 1st major market job at the illustrious Power 106. After a few years there, I went across the street to the late 100.3FM The Beat, where I did mornings with Hip Hop greats Ed Lover & Dr. Dre and then with comedian/tv host Steve Harvey. And now, I work for Stevie Wonder at 102.3 KJLH!

After high school, I went on to attend a broadcasting school where there, I was able to hone in on my skills as a future radio talent. Immediately upon graduating, my journey in radio began. I was blessed with a street team gig at a Latin station that happened to be on the same floor level as Power 106. I was able to snag an audition for one of the open street team positions they were looking to fill, and after a year of silence, I finally received that fate-filled phone call and secured a position on the street team of my dreams! Years past, and through the incredible mentorship of Dj Carisma, and hosting her mix shows and podcasts (before the hype of mix shows and podcasts began) I found myself learning and working with of some of radios elite and getting the opportunity to interview all of hip hops greatest artists and moguls all while building a reputation of being in the “know” by interviewing new and emerging talent before they hit the mainstream on my artist series “The Rose Delivery.”\n\nAbby hosts a weekend Hip Hop program on SiriusXM.\n\nDELILAH: KBIG, 1998; KMLT, 2003; KBIG, 2007; KJLL, 2010; KFSH, 2012-19.

Last year, Delilah Rene was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.\n\nI met Delilah around 2007 when KBIG picked up the show. She is remarkably upbeat about her life. On her weeknight show, she takes calls from listeners in her home studio, providing encouragement, support, and receiving musical dedication requests, offering a song that best matches the caller’s situation. It is tough to ignore her sincerity once you learn the road she has traveled. Married for the fourth time, she doesn’t skirt the issue when giving marital advice. She has adopted 10 children and integrated them into her household with three children of her own.\n\nA drinking problem led her to a 12-Step recovery program. Delilah has already endured the loss of a child. Her son Sammy, adopted from a West Africa refugee camp, died in 2013 of sickle-cell anemia. The Rene family is now mourning the loss of another child. This week, her 18-year-old son Zachariah committed suicide. Delilah told her listeners that Zack “took his life” after being “treated, counseled and embraced fiercely by family and friends, while battling depression for some time now.”\n\nDelilah says “my heart is broken beyond repair…but I have to believe he is at peace with the Lord and that God will get us through.” Zack was diagnosed as autistic.

Jess gave me an hour of his time and wisdom on how to become a journalist. He stressed that a broad life experience is the best source of information you can develop. I progressively worked at KLA/83 [UCLA], KPFK, KPCC. A summer stint at KGIL brought skills learned from Dick Spangler, Howard Culver and Bob Scott, while KLAC's Dean Sander, Dave Godwin, Charles Arlington, John North, Art Blaske and Phil Jenrich helped me polish both my field and anchoring ability.
