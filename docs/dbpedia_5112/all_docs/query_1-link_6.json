        "text": "Russ Albums has plenty of stories after nearly 30 years in radio, but none sweeter than the memory of his late-'60s stint at KQRS-FM in Minneapolis, one of the first FM rock 'n' roll stations.\n\n\"That was back when the DJ was an artist,\" said Albums, who's now the drive-time disc jockey at Tampa Bay's WHPT-FM 102.5. \"You could paint pictures for your audience. I could play a Prokofiev fugue, then segue to an ELO piece that opened with a cello, and by the end I'd be playing Johnny Winter. I could go all the way from classical to hard-rocking guitar. It was a ride.\"\n\nToday Albums, 47, works strictly from his program director's play list of hits, aimed at the 25- to 54-year-old audience that advertisers love. By his own count, Albums has eight minutes of ad-lib talk time on each four-hour show.\n\n\"Today, radio is a big business,\" said Albums, who sports a silver-gray mohawk haircut and rides a Harley. \"I have as much artistic freedom here as anywhere, but no DJ's had much freedom for the past 10 years. And I have no reason to be a musical renegade. I need to make a living.\"\n\nWelcome to the world of radio. It's a business that may seem quaintly outdated in the era of the Internet and 200-channel cable TV, but it's one that has thrived because of its simplicity. It's free to the listener, it's portable and it has the magical ability to turn air into advertising dollars: $11.5-billion nationwide and $78.5-million in Tampa Bay last year.\n\nThe scramble for those ad dollars shifted into hyperdrive in February with the signing of the federal Telecommunications Act. Radio operators who were previously limited to owning two stations in the same market were given clearance to own up to eight _ five FM and three AM. The result has been a rush of consolidations and acquisitions valued at more than $11-billion in the first six months of this year, compared with $4.5-billion in all of 1995.\n\nThe latest _ and biggest _ deal was Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s $3.9-billion offer for Infinity Broadcasting, announced June 20. The merger creates a radio powerhouse with 83 stations, a stable of high-profile personalities such as Howard Stern and Don Imus, and an estimated 30 percent share of national radio ad revenues.\n\nThe Westinghouse/Infinity merger also affects Tampa Bay: Infinity has owned highly ranked WQYK-FM and its AM talk affiliate since 1986.\n\nTampa Bay's radio market includes 22 AM and 23 FM stations, ranging from mom-and-pop operations beaming low-frequency signals from converted homes to slick corporate conglomerations with the latest in digital equipment.\n\nBut the big guys already outnumber the small radio operators locally: More than 60 percent of the area's adult listening audience listens to stations controlled by five companies _ Jacor Communications, Clear Channel Communications, Paxson Communications, Cox Broadcasting and Infinity/Westinghouse.\n\nMore consolidations are in the works both nationally and locally. The result, analysts say, will be more profitable operations, as stations share overhead and some staffing. Infinity, the nation's largest radio company before joining Westinghouse, has already proved the benefits of aggressive acquisition: It boasts a 50 percent profit margin.\n\nBut is bigger better for the listener? In the ad-driven world of radio, many experts say the answer is yes.\n\n\"The last thing an owner with six or eight stations wants is for all of them to appeal to the same people,\" said Katy Bachman, editor in chief of Radio Business Report, a weekly trade paper. \"Consolidation means you're going to see more experimentation and more creativity.\"\n\nNot everyone buys that argument, though.\n\nGene Dansey is president and owner of Rolyn Communications, which operates WRXB-AM 1590 in St. Petersburg, a black contemporary station. \"These conglomerates may offer different formats, but how much of the programing will be locally controlled?\" Dansey asked.\n\n\"Right now you can get any format you want by satellite,\" he said. \"When you have absentee ownership, you take away direct involvement by the owners in the community. And if three people own all the stations in the market, then three CEOs will be making the decisions on what goes out on radio.\"\n\nBut critics' concerns seem to be falling on deaf ears at the Federal Communications Commission, which is expected to approve the Westinghouse-Infinity deal. And analysts say continued consolidation of the nation's 10,000 radio stations is inevitable. When the dust clears, it's easy to imagine all of Tampa Bay's leading radio stations in the hands of just three or four owners, industry experts say.\n\n\"In Orlando, the top 18 stations are already owned by three companies,\" said Tim Menowsky, a media broker based in Tampa and a former general manager of WRBQ-FM. \"So I think having four major owners in Tampa is not that far off. Right now, everything's in play. It's like a game of Monopoly.\"\n\nBig deals, little budgets\n\nIt's a game where the stakes are rising fast. In the most recent deal, Infinity's WQYK-AM/FM, two stations that have a combined 7.4 percent audience share, were valued at $99-million, or 19 times cash flow. That compares with $5-million paid by Clear Channel Communications six years ago for WRBQ-FM, which has since knocked WQYK-FM out of the lead in the local country-western war.\n\n\"WQYK is probably only worth about $1-million in hard assets,\" said Menowsky, the Tampa broker. \"But the public market is buying radio today based on projected growth and the ability to improve the revenue stream.\"\n\nIndeed, except for capital investments in equipment _ which can run as high as $1.5-million per station _ even the largest radio companies are notoriously low-budget affairs.\n\nPaxson Communications' four local stations, which attract nearly 14 percent of adult listeners, share leased office space on Fourth Street N in St. Petersburg. The company, which had an estimated $8-million in ad revenues in 1995, has 78 full-time employees and 28 part-timers. And though big-name morning drive-time DJs may pull in six-figure incomes, high pay is the exception.\n\n\"People like Mason Dixon (at WUSA-FM) and Bubba (at WFLZ-FM) earn the big money,\" said WHPT's Albums, who will only put his own salary at \"five figures.\" \"All of the rest of us are scratching around at the bottom.\"\n\nFor years, radio ad reps have felt they've been scratching around at the bottom, as well, getting a chicken-feed 7 percent of all ad dollars nationally.\n\nIn Tampa Bay, radio has fared quite a bit better, getting more than 16 percent of the area's estimated $481.5-million in 1995 ad revenues. But that's still less than half the amount pulled in by local TV (39.9 percent) and newspapers (38 percent).\n\nThrough consolidation, radio operators hope to change that equation. \"The big operators definitely see themselves taking ad revenues from other media, with newspapers and big VHF TV stations as particular targets,\" said John Reidy, a media analyst for Smith Barney in New York.\n\nAnd, Reidy said, radio operators will be more effective only if they have more formats to sell.\n\nTwo examples of diversification have hit local airwaves in the past year: Jacor's WDUV-FM and Paxson's WSJT-FM. And though it generally takes two years for a new station to build up a significant audience, both new entries had strong showings in the winter ratings, with WJST drawing 5.1 percent of the adult audience and WDUV attracting 2.1 percent.\n\nJacor transformed WDUV from a family-owned station in Sarasota to a high-powered Tampa station offering an \"easy standards\" format targeting adults ages 35 to 64.\n\nPaxson, which jettisoned a jazz format when it bought WHPT-FM in 1991, revived the specialty niche in July 1995 when it introduced WSJT, which was previously based in Lakeland.\n\nThe narrowing play list\n\nAl Santana was a disc jockey on WHPT-FM before its acquisition by Paxson, and he now handles the 10 a.m.-to-3 p.m. show at WSJT. So he's once again playing jazz, but with a difference.\n\n\"When I did the jazz show at the Wave (WHPT's old nickname), I was given pretty much free rein and the music got fairly eclectic,\" Santana said.\n\n\"At WSJT, we're taking a more basic approach, trying to attract the average listener rather than the jazz aficionado. Music research is a big part of the programing, and consistency is a must. We're trying to build an audience and form a sound for the station. And that takes money and research and marketing.\"\n\nHighly paid consultants routinely conduct focus groups for commercial radio stations, trying to determine what makes listeners tune in or turn off.\n\nWHPT's Albums believes the consultants were responsible for changing radio from an art form to a business, beginning in the mid-'70s. \"They came in with their demos (demographics) and started telling us what we could play,\" Albums said. \"Before that, we had massive musical libraries.\"\n\nToday, Albums is allowed some creativity, pulling together an eclectic blend of music for his Sunday show, The Wax Museum. \"That's my link to my former life of progressive radio,\" he said. \"The rest of the time, I go with consultants' recommendations. They have systems that have been proven to work.\"\n\nIt's this kind of conservatism that makes Rob Lorei, news director at WMNF-FM, a non-commercial station in Tampa, question the degree to which consolidation will mean real diversity. \"The more often stations turn over, the more debt the new owners incur,\" Lorei said. \"And I don't think they're going to take risks on formats or songs that audiences might tune out.\"\n\nThough the area has black, Greek and Spanish- language stations on the AM dial, Lorei said the absence of such programing on the more expensive _ and higher fidelity _ FM bands shows how demographics shape radio. \"There's a perception on local commercial radio that those groups don't have enough spendable income,\" he said.\n\nGeoff Humphreys, who hosts a world music show on WMNF but sells advertising for Clear Channel's WMTX-FM, believes Lorei is only partly correct.\n\n\"I think the jury is still out on whether consolidation will produce better radio,\" Humphreys said.\"And while I love WMNF, which is for hard-core music lovers, you can't ignore the fact that 10 times more people listen to commercial radio.\"\n\nAnd listeners, said Katy Bachman of Radio Business Report, are still the key to the business of radio.\n\n\"Basically, the listener doesn't care who owns the radio stations,\" she said. \"When you get right down to it, the listener asks, \"Is the program relevant to me? Is it telling me what I need to know, and is it entertaining me?' Do you listen to it or not?\"\n\nOwnership of bay area's top stations\n\n(Percentages are market share of 25-54 age group as of winter 1996)\n\nClear Channel Communications, San Antonio, Texas\n\nWMTX-FM 95.7 _ 8.4%\n\nWRBQ-FM 104.7 _ 7.3%\n\nWRBQ-AM 1380 _ 1.7%\n\nTotal market share: 17.4%\n\nPaxson Communications, West Palm Beach\n\nWHPT-FM 102.5 _ 7.3%\n\nWSJT-FM 94.1 _ 5.1%\n\nWZTM-AM 820 _ .8%\n\nWHNZ-AM 570 _ .5%\n\nTotal market share: 13.7%\n\nJacor Communications, Cincinnati\n\nWFLZ-FM 93.3 _ 6.8%\n\nWFLA-FM 970 _ 4.5%\n\nWDUV-FM 103.5 _ 2.1%\n\nTotal market share: 13.4%\n\nInfinity/Westinghouse, New York\n\nWQYK-FM 99.5 _ 6.4%\n\nWQYK-AM 1010 _ 1.0%\n\nTotal market share: 7.4%\n\nCox Broadcasting, Atlanta\n\nWWRM-FM 94.9 _ 5.9%\n\nWCOF-FM 107.3 _ 5.5%\n\nWSUN-AM 620 _ 1.5%\n\nTotal market share: 12.9%\n\nGannett Co., Arlington, Va.\n\nWUSA-FM 100.7 _ 5.6%\n\nWDAE-AM 1250 _ simulcast with WUSA FM\n\nTotal market share: 5.6%\n\nCiticasters, Cincinnati\n\n(Sale of these stations to Jacor pending)\n\nWXTB-FM 97.9 _ 5.4%\n\nWTBT-FM 105.5 _ 3.1%\n\nTotal market share: 8.5%\n\nEntercom Communications, Philadelphia\n\nWYUU-FM 92.5 _ 5.1%\n\nSource: Duncan's American Radio"
