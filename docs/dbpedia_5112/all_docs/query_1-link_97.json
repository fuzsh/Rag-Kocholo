Radio is still an excellent medium for reaching Black women, with 92% penetration versus the next highest medium, TV, which has 90% reach. Black women listen to radio at slightly higher rates than other women with an average listening time of 14 hours and 7 minutes, versus other women, with an average weekly listening time of 12 hours and 52 minutes. Black women 35 and older have a higher weekly listening time of 15 hours and 17 minutes, compared to Black women ages 18 to 34, who have an average weekly listening time of 11 hours and 47 minutes.\n\nLooking at the top 20 radio stations among Black women nationwide, 11 are an Urban Adult Contemporary format, seven are Urban Contemporary, one is Adult Contemporary, and one is Rhythmic Contemporary Hit. Stations with Urban Contemporary formats are more popular among millennial Black women, while stations with Urban Adult Contemporary are more popular among those age 35 and older. * These trends hold up when polled by Scarborough, with 51% agreeing that they listen to Urban Adult contemporary and 39% agreeing they listen to Urban Contemporary. *Source: Nielsen Radio.\n\nThe report summarizes that black women spend more time weekly than do total U.S. females on TV, radio, multimedia devices, and internet and video on both PCs and smartphones. Although all age groups spend the most time on TV, radio has the highest reach at 92%. And with Black women over-indexing against non-Hispanic White women for finding value in radio advertising, that medium still offers good opportunities for advertisers.

And now he wants the FCC to get involved, reports NBC 2 Ft. Myers. With the recent hurricanes, many are now reconsidering the significance of a radio. Jeremy Azinger who runs a smartphone store in downtown Fort Myers claims activating the feature would be an easy task. âI can easily imagine there being a setting on your phone that you turn on and off at your leisure to have access ability to your radio.\" Many people were surprised to hear their phone had this feature. âThat shocks me. If it's in there already, why aren't [cell phone manufacturers] doing it?â asked Barbara Bartnikowski of North Fort Myers.\n\nSenator Nelson wants that same question answered.

Two years later, the company has turned the corner thanks to a relentless focus on improving the culture and motivating employees. \"When I took on the challenge of turning around Cumulus Media in October 2015, it was a company in free fall: four straight years of declines in radio listenership, four straight years of revenue declines, three straight years of EBITDA declines, and underperforming acquisitions which had saddled the company with an untenable debt load. We also had lousy systems, crumbling infrastructure and unhappy employees who told us in surveys that the âdysfunctional,â âtoxicâ and âlousyâ culture was the primary reason for the companyâs poor performance. It was clear from the start that Cumulus would not be saved by any of the traditional turnaround quick fixes.\n\nThe company had already made meaningful cost reductions. With our heavy debt, any transformational M&A was also off the table. The market was not going to helpâwe started the turnaround just as headwinds in the radio industry started to pick up speed. Fixing Cumulus meant significantly improving basic business performance. The big unknown was whether our demoralized employees would step up to the plate. With almost 6,000 employees spread across radio stations in 90 markets, there had been almost no investment in rank-and-file employees, and turnover hovered around 50%. The company hadnât given raises in over 10 years and some working conditions were almost unbelievable. I got a call a few days into my tenure complaining about the snakes that had fallen through the rotting ceiling in one of our offices.
