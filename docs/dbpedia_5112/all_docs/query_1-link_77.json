        "text": "Television Broadcasters Raise $45 Million for Hurricane Relief\n\nTelevision broadcasters have raised at least $45 million through on-air campaigns and direct donations for relief efforts supporting victims of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. This amount is based on publicly available fundraising totals, social media and information provided to NAB. In addition to fundraisers, broadcasters have collected food, bottles of water, clothing, hygiene products and other supplies. The estimate does not include fundraising totals for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, as many efforts are ongoing.\n\nThe September 2017 issue of Licensed to Serve features examples of the outstanding life-line reporting and disaster relief efforts that broadcasters performed. Several fundraisers have since concluded, bringing the total raised by Nexstar to $4.4 million and $2.2 million from Cox-owned radio stations.\n\n\"Local broadcasters served as 'first informers' and saved countless lives as Harvey and Irma tore through Texas, Louisiana, Florida, and the Southeast,\" said NAB President and CEO Gordon Smith. \"Now, our attention turns to the long recovery ahead. I'm so proud of the generosity and compassion shown by broadcasters who are helping rebuild and restore hurricane-ravaged communities.\"\n\nBeasley Supports Victims of Las Vegas Shooting and Hurricane Maria\n\nBeasley Media Group set up a GoFundMe page to provide financial support to the victims and families of the shooting at the Route 91Harvest Festival on October 1 in Las Vegas. During the shooting, 59 were killed and more than 500 injured. Beasley's \"Community of Caring\" donated $5,000 and set the goal for the page at $1 million. KCYE-FM Las Vegas Morning Personality Mike West took this video at the event.\n\nBeasley Media Group's WYUU-FM Tampa partnered with Walmart for a Hurricane Relief Drive, held September 24 â 25 to support Hurricane Maria relief efforts. CaringForPuertoRico.org provided cargo planes to deliver supplies directly to Puerto Rico.\n\nWKAQ-AM Provides Lifeline Coverage During Hurricane Maria\n\nNAB recently received a Facebook message applauding Univision's WKAQ-AM San Juan, P.R., for its lifesaving reporting and service to its community during Hurricane Maria. Jose M. Moret wrote, \"Dear NAB, the island of Puerto Rico, my homeland, is currently surviving the horrific impact of hurricane Maria. As a Puertorrican residing in NJ, I feel powerless not knowing about my parents, siblings and extended family members. Through this difficult time, the live Facebook news streams from Jay Fonseca (@jayfonsecapr) and the WKAQ580 AM team are providing a truly significant contribution to the relief and coordination efforts in the island, as well as distributing the latest news from the island to its population in and out of Puerto Rico. Please allow me via this note to send my public appreciation to the NAB and Jay Fonseca, an extraordinary broadcaster and humanitarian.\"\n\nGraham Media Group Launches \"Opioid Nation: An American Epidemic\"\n\nGraham Media Group (GMG) launched on August 23 \"Opioid Nation: An American Epidemic,\" a multi-platform program addressing the prescription drug abuse epidemic. During the week of September 5, all seven GMG stations aired and streamed locally-produced specials and staffed phone banks and Facebook Live sessions with substance abuse counselors. The initiative highlights people who are impacted and explores government policies with monthly investigative reports, original programming, town halls, social media, PSAs and community partnerships.\n\n\"Opioid addiction is ravaging our communities big and small and local broadcasters are uniquely positioned to tell these stories,\" said GMG President and CEO Emily Barr. \"It is our responsibility to inform viewers and we hope that 'Opioid Nation: An American Epidemic' will not only educate the communities we serve, but help those who are affected find a path forward through this unprecedented crisis.\"\n\nHearst Hosts Live Special on Opioid Crisis\n\nHearst Television stations aired and streamed a live primetime one-hour special, \"Matter of Fact: State of Addiction,\" on September 13 to address America's opioid epidemic as part of Hearst's year-long multi-platform news and investigative series that launched in January 2017. Award-winning journalist Soledad O'Brien hosted the program, which featured live inserts from local stations addressing the crisis in their markets and field reports from around the country. Viewers used the hashtag #stateofaddiction to post pictures, videos and stories, creating a virtual \"wall of remembrance\" for victims of the epidemic. The special included segments with physicians, Drug Enforcement Administration Director Chuck Rosenberg, Sens. Ron Johnson and Rob Portman and Rep. Greg Walden.\n\nBeasley Media Group Launches \"Community of Caring\" Initiative\n\nBeasley Media Group launched on August 15 a \"Community of Caring\" initiative across its 63 radio stations. A rotating public service announcement (PSA) series and social media campaigns address opioid abuse, bullyin g, racism and mental health. Beasley will also host \"Day of Caring\" events, allowing employees to volunteer at non-profits during work hours. \"As a company, we take all of these issues very seriously,\" said CEO Caroline Beasley. \"The rotating PSA and social media campaigns, combined with our Day of Caring events across all of our markets, underscores our company's strong commitment to making a difference in the communities we serve.\"\n\nWZSR-FM Provides Accessible Van\n\nAlpha Media's WZSR-FM Chicago presented a wheelchair accessible van to 23-year-old listener Melissa Mayber, who has a spinal cord injury, on August 25 at a \"Sock Hop\" dance event hosted by the station. The van was the top item on her wish list, followed by her desire to attend a sock hop. Her family couldn't afford the van on top of medical expenses, but the wheelchair accessible van became a priority after Melissa's mom suffered a heart attack trying to lift Melissa into a vehicle for her doctor's visit. WZSR-FM on-air personalities regularly promoted their fundraising efforts for the van in the months leading up to the sock hop. Seeing the joy on Melissa's face, News Director Stew Cohen said, \"I realized in that very moment why WZSR cherishes its public service work in the community.\""
