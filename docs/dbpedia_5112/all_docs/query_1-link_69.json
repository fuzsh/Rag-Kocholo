Anna Maria Gaines is born in what would become Elfers. Hers was probably one of the earliest births in this area. She died about 1875 and was interred in a private burial plot in what would become Elfers\n\nJan. 8, 1876. Rev. John W. Wells begins serving as pastor of the newly organized Union Church, according to a local church register. This church is believed to be the first Baptist church in western Pasco county. The six charter members were W. F. Baillie and his wife, Allen Hill and his wife, Rosanne Baillie and Mr. Cobb. It was built where the West Elfers Cemetery is now located. (More on this church is in the article at the bottom of this page.)\n\nMarch 1877. Peter Karr Baillie dies. His burial was the first in what would become West Elfers Cemetery.\n\n1877-78. A list of Hernando County schools includes the Baillie School. A history of the Elfers schools is here.\n\nSept. 1887. Precinct 10 is called Bailey.\n\nJuly, 7, 1892. School board minutes refer to the area as “the Baillie settlement.”\n\nDec. 14, 1909. The Elfers post office is established. The first postmaster was Levi D. Eiland, whose wife ran the post office and chose the name for it. Her mother’s maiden name was Elfers. A list of postmasters is here.\n\n1913. Railroad service to Elfers is established by the Tampa and Gulf Coast Railroad to accommodate the shipment of citrus. The depot at Elfers was closed in November 1972, after the Elfers packing house had burned down.\n\nMay 9, 1913. The Tarpon Springs Leader reports:\n\nElfers is a village about midway between Tarpon Springs and Port Richey. The building of the railroad put new life into that section, and the way the little place has grown in the past year is astonishing. A good depot, church, store and several dwellings have been built around the railroad station, and there is every evidence of prosperity and a promise of continued rapid growth. The store is operated by Mr. J. M. Mitchell, and is well stocked with goods. The famous “Seven Springs” are near here.\n\nJune 29, 1913. The Tampa Morning Tribune, in an article by Joe M. Knight, reports, “John Gribbel, the owner of the Saturday Evening Post, Ladies’ Home Journal, Country Gentleman, and the Philadelphia Ledger, and one of the finest men that ever lived, has bought the Baillie place and two or three other tracts of land here and is preparing to clear his land, cultivate it, and set it out in grove besides what he already has here. D. J. Collins, Mr. Gribbel’s partner, has also purchased numerous tracts of land, some groves, including the Hay place, and is also preparing to set out more trees.”\n\nJan. 21, 1917. The Tampa Morning Tribune reports, “Elfers now has her telephone system, and J. M. Mitchell, one of Elfers’ leading citizens, is preparing to put in an electric lighting plant, lighting up Elfers, having lights for the main street, as well as the residents. And now the Tampa & Gulf Coast Railroad Company is running daily trains to and from Elfers, ably handling the fruit crop as well as the passengers.”\n\n1918-19. The Elfers Methodist Episcopal Church is built at the corner of Pine and Orange Streets, during the pastorate of Rev. Henry E. Partridge. [This church closed in 1940, merging with the Episcopal church in New Port Richey.]\n\nApril 10, 1920. The Elfers Citrus Growers Association is chartered at Tallahassee. The first officers were President, C. Johnson; Vice President, C. M. Brown; Secretary, N. M. Swartsel; Directors, H. S. Rothera and G. S. Barker. A packing house was built later in 1920, equipped with modern machinery for washing, sizing, coloring, waxing, and preparing fruit for shipment.\n\nNov. 25, 1920. The New Port Richey Press reports, “On Saturday last the fine and commodious new packing house of the Elfers Fruit Growers, in connection with the Florida Citrus Exchange, was opened for business. ... It is upwards of 12 months since the grove owners of Elfers and New Port Richey decided to join up with the Florida Citrus Exchange, and through that channel market their own fruit packed in their own packing house. ... The new packing-house has an 80 by 120 feet floor space, and in height is 10 ft to the wall plate and 27 feet to the peek. ... The machinery forming the packing plant is all new and entirely up-to-date. It has been made and installed by the Skinner Manufacturing Company, of Dunedin, Florida, and is capable of meeting any demands which may be made upon it within the next few years.”\n\nAug. 24, 1921. The Tarpon Springs Leader reports, “It is estimated that within three miles of the village of Elfers there are twenty-five hundred acres of young orange grove, most of it just getting into the full bearing stage. There are a half dozen large groves, consisting of from one hundred acres to two hundred acres each, and in addition to these big acreages there are dozens and dozens of smaller groves ranging from five to forty acres.”\n\nJan. 26, 1922. The New Port Richey Press reports, “Rev. C. W. Cotton has been appointed pastor of the Elfers Methodist Church for the ensuing year. He and his wife arrived last night.”\n\nFeb. 2, 1922. The Elfers West Pasco Record begins publication. The publisher was Arthur Ray Nason. According to a Tampa Tribune article, after 45 issues the newspaper folded and Nason moved back to Tampa. According to a newspaper column by John W. Parkes, the maximum circulation was 150. An article in the New Port Richey Press on Dec. 22, 1922, reported that Nason had sold the newspaper to the Dade City Banner, which would discontinue the paper but would instead include a section in the Banner devoted to western Pasco County.\n\nFeb. 9, 1922. The Elfers West Pasco Record reports, “E. S. McDuffy, who has been conducting a barber shop in the rear of the Edenfield & Wiggin store [in Elfers], is now occupying a building removed from the rear of the old place, and located at the cross roads.”\n\nMar. 30, 1922. In an advertisement in the Elfers West Pasco Record the Gulf Utilities Co. of New Port Richey offered to extend its lines to give service to the residents of Elfers if the citizens of Elfers would subscribe for and purchase fifteen $100 eight percent first mortgage bonds, part of a larger bond issue.\n\nJune 9, 1925. The Tarpon Springs Leader reports, “An act incorporating Elfers as city passed both houses of the legislature last week, and today only awaits the signature of Governor Martin to become law. City officials have already been selected to fill the offices temporarily until an election can be called, and will assume their duties as soon as the bill is signed. The last census gave Elfers a population of 300.” According to Florida Cracker Days, it was State Sen. Jesse M. Mitchell who introduced the bill to incorporate Elfers.\n\nDec. 11, 1925. The New Port Richey Press reports that Sen. Jesse M. Mitchell was elected to a one-year term as the Mayor of Elfers and that the city council would consist of E. P. Campbell, R. E. Bailey, J. W. Saunders, P. L. Pierce, and T. J. Hill. Information on Rev. Mitchell, the only mayor of Elfers and its leading citizen in this period, is here.\n\nJan. 1, 1926. The New Port Richey Press reports: “Plans for a state bank in Elfers became actuality the past week when a group of influential citizens of New Port Richey and Elfers applied to the capital for a charter. The new institution is to be capitalized for $15,000 and Warren E. Burns is to be president. Work will be started at once under the direction of Mayor J. M. Mitchell of Elfers on a building for the new financial home. The building will be erected on a site opposite the packing house on the Dixie Boulevard and will be of stucco and modern construction under plans which call for an expenditure of $25,000.” It is believed that the bank never opened.\n\nJan. 29, 1926. The New Port Richey Press reports the city councils of Elfers and New Port Richey appointed committees to study a possible merger of the two cities. The newspaper reported that “some months ago” an earlier plan to unite the two cities was rejected at a public meeting of New Port Richey residents.\n\nDec. 31, 1926. The New Port Richey Press reports election results. For mayor: J. M. Mitchell, 29; C. W. Weddle, 22. For council: Tom Hill, 24; John L. Williams, 23; Lawrence Anderson, 22; A. R. Twitchell, 19; and J. W. Saunders, 3.\n\nMar. 6, 1927. The Kissimmee Inn opens in Elfers, with L. E. Rousseau as manager [West Pasco’s Heritage].\n\nApr. 8, 1927. The Dade City Banner reports that the incorporated city of Elfers covered seven square miles, with 2.5 miles of Gulf frontage, and that it had a population of 400.\n\nMay 9, 1927. A census completed on this date shows 303 persons living within the corporate limits of Elfers, all of whom were white. The Elfers voting precinct had a population of 554, of whom 21 were black.\n\nDec. 16, 1932. The Tarpon Springs Leader reports:\n\nJ. M. Mitchell was chosen for his fourth two-year term as mayor of Elfers without opposition in Tuesday’s municipal election. He has held the office since Elfers was incorporated as a city in 1925. Tom Hill and J. L. Waddy were re-elected to the city council, also for two-year terms. Hill is president of the council. Hold-over members whose terms expire in January, 1934, are Arthur Chamberlin, R. L. Moore and P. L. Pierce. The council will meet and organize January 9. A record vote of 88 was cast in the election. C. A. Walters and L. B. Edenfield were defeated candidates for the council.\n\nApril 28, 1933. The Tarpon Springs Leader reports that the bill introduced by Sen. Samuel W. Getzen to abolish the City of Elfers had been passed by the Senate and that passage by the House was expected before adjournment later today. According to the article, the bill would become effective on July 1.\n\nMay 1, 1940. The Evening Independent reports, “A meeting was held last Sunday at the Elfers Methodist church by the members of both the local and Elfers churches to discuss the merger of the two. It is expected the Elfers church will join forces with the New Port Richey church and the church and the church building at Elfers torn down to be rebuilt as a Sunday school room on the local church site.”\n\nJan. 26, 1947. The Anclote Baptist Church of Elfers holds its dedication services, with an attendance of about 400 people. Twelve visiting pastors were in attendance.\n\nMarch 1, 1965. The new Elfers post office opens.\n\nMarch 6, 1966. the Elfers Citrus Growers Association packing house is destroyed by fire, causing an estimated $250,000 loss. A newspaper article quoted Harvey Snell, manager of the plant since 1948, as saying that about 25 to 30 per cent of the loss was covered by insurance. He said that 75 local persons were employed at the plant and about 100 were employed as pickers in the field. No one was injured but a nearby home and restaurant were also destroyed.\n\nDINING OUT AROUND ELFERS\n\nAlligators Florida Grill and Bar\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\n3523 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Grill\n\nBeef O Bradys Family Sports Pub\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 376-5550\n\n3216 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Family\n\nBrick Oven Pizzeria\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 372-1302\n\n9945 Trinity Blvd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Pizza\n\nChick Fil A\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 834-8880\n\n3242 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Fast Food\n\nChilis Grill and Bar\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 376-1123\n\n3240 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Family\n\nChina King\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 834-8869\n\n2928 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Chinese\n\nChristos\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 376-4082\n\n3136 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nOutback Steakhouse\n\nTrinity Florida Steakhouse Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 376-5100\n\n10860 State Road 54, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Steak\n\nPanera Bread\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 375-2131\n\n3234 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Family\n\nSteak n Shake Restaurant\n\nTrinity Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 372-8777\n\n3046 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Burger\n\nWestshore Pizza\n\nTrinity Florida Pizza Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 375-2525 Z\n\n2926 Little Rd, Trinity, FL 34655-4420\n\nRestaurants Pizza\n\nBeef O Bradys\n\nOdessa Restaurant\n\nPhone: (813) 920-6525\n\n8568 Gunn Hwy, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nChilis Grill and Bar\n\nOdessa Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (813) 792-5010\n\n16420 State Road 54, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nRestaurants Family\n\nG Peppers\n\nOdessa Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (813) 920-3439\n\n8745 Gunn Hwy, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nGodfathers Pizza\n\nOdessa Florida Pizza\n\nPhone: (813) 920-0868\n\n13508 State Road 54, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nRestaurants Pizza\n\nLuckys Barbeque and Deli\n\nOdessa Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (813) 926-0874\n\n19143 Gunn Hwy, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nRestaurants Barbecue\n\nMcDonalds Restaurant\n\nOdessa Florida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (813) 920-5422\n\n8506 Gunn Hwy, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nRestaurants Fast Food\n\nNew China\n\nOdessaFlorida Restaurant\n\nPhone: (813) 926-9885\n\n17625 Gunn Hwy, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nRestaurants Chinese\n\nOdessa Family Restaurant\n\nPhone: (813) 920-2851\n\n8741 Gunn Hwy, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nRestaurants Family\n\nRois Bbq\n\nOdessa Barbecue Restaurant\n\nPhone: (727) 375-5309\n\n2210 Destiny Way, Odessa, FL 33556-3289\n\nRestaurants Barbecue"
