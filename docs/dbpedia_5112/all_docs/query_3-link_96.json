        "text": "A Florida man who was caught with illegal drugs came up with an unusual plan to weasel out of getting charged: he pretended to have a heart attack, authorities say.\n\nThe incident happened Sunday after Palm Coast resident Brent Christopher Heath, 40, was pulled over for a minor traffic offense, according to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office. When a deputy smelled marijuana coming from Heath’s car, he decided to search it – and found a bunch of fentanyl and a vial of liquid THC, sheriff’s officials say. That’s when Heath clutched his chest and told the deputy he was having a heart attack.\n\n“He was checked on scene by a medical unit but could not be adequately evaluated … so he was transported to AdventHealth South,” reads a statement released by the sheriff’s office. After doctors determined there was nothing wrong with Heath, he was booked into jail, sheriff’s officials say.\n\nThis is not Heath’s first time dealing with law enforcement. He has been previously arrested for child abuse, domestic violence and grand theft. He has also faced other charges relating to burglary, resisting an officer with violence and dealing in stolen property.\n\n[Source: NY Post.com]\n\nThe 5 Most Dangerous Cities In Florida\n\nWe know how ominous “The most dangerous cities in Florida” sounds, but we think it’s important to know. The good news is out of a list of 100 dangerous cities in the U.S., only 5 in Florida made the list. Of those 5 cities, none of them cracked the top 50 in this updated study. A lot of people probably assume big metros like Miami, Tampa and Orlando made the list, but nope!\n\nWe got this information from Neighborhood Scout. Their analysis includes crimes reported by all agencies. They studied cities with 25,000 or more people, based on the number of violent crimes per 1,000 residents. Data used for this research are:\n\nThe number of violent crimes reported to the FBI to have occurred in each city.\n\nProjections of violent crime rates based on prior years’ data.\n\nThe population of each city.\n\nFlorida is known for some of the country’s most bizarre crimes. And while all of them may be dangerous, they may not qualify as “violent.” Driving a golf cart naked down I75, assault with food, and similar “Florida Man” crimes don’t fall into the FBI category.\n\nIf you want to see how other cities rank, click here for the full study.\n\nHere are the most dangerous cities in Florida\n\nJeff Zito or just \"Zito\" as he is known to his friends, was born in Summit, NJ.
