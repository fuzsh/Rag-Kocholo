        "text": "It's 12 minutes after the 9 o'clock hour on a hot and hazy Tuesday morning _ welcome to seat-of-the-pants radio. In the cramped, slightly tattered studios of WHBO-AM (1040), deejay \"Marvelous\" Marvin Boone is making like an octopus. His arms are a whirl. He grabs for a taped commercial, slams the cartridge into a machine; his other hand reaches for the console, makes an adjustment. He punches a button, kicking in an ad spot. He gropes for a compact disc, the next song after break. What's it going to be? The Coasters? Kinks? Jackie Wilson?\n\nAll the while, a woman on the speaker phone is complaining that the deejay from the previous afternoon didn't play her 67-year-old mother's request. Boone politely tells her to take it up with that guy. As the last commercial comes to an abrupt end, Boone takes to the microphone for some fast patter and punches up the next song: Do You Want to Dance _ not the Beach Boys hit, but the 1958 original by Bobby Freeman.\n\nBeads of perspiration form around his brow and mouth, but Marvelous Marvin isn't sweatin' it. He's having a ball as the morning man and program director of Tampa Bay's oldest oldies station. \"It's a pretty pressurized situation,\" he says, rapidly as always. \"You've got these two-minute songs. They go by pretty fast, and I often don't know what's coming next. But I love it.\"\n\nThe scene is out of a time capsule. Radio isn't done this way anymore. These days, jocks walk into sparkling studios armed with a computer printout that specifies the exact order of songs they are to play during their shift. These playlists have been meticulously researched and chosen by the program department to fit snugly into the station's format, appealing to its intended audience.\n\nWith a few exceptions, modern deejays don't ramble much on the microphone, and they rarely provide information about the music. You get a title and artist if you're lucky. Boone, who would be a tenured professor were there a college of rock 'n' roll knowledge, likes to pass trivia tidbits on to his listeners. With oldies, the info matters.\n\nOn Fridays he plays \"Stump the Dee-Jay\" _ a simple enough game during which listeners call in and ask Boone a trivia question about a hit oldie. If Boone gets it wrong, the caller wins a small prize; if he gets it right, the caller loses. The caller usually loses. (On this morning's unscheduled \"Stump\" game, Boone correctly identifies the three main members of the '60s pop group Three Dog Night, throwing in the keyboardist's name for good measure.)\n\nBoone's shift goes by in hyper-drive. He lays out a steady dose of dry quips on the air, kibbitzes with listeners over the phone, plays several requests, cues up some discs seemingly at the last possible second. He bombards his visitor with a stream-of-consciousness flow of rock trivia (Jimmy Page played guitar on Tom Jones' It's Not Unusual), opinions on a plethora of topics and insights into the radio business.\n\nBoone spins such obscure R&B nuggets as Young Jesse's Mary Lou, Smiley Lewis' One Night (of Sin), Wynonie Harris' Keep on Churnin' 'Til the Butter Comes and Louis Jordan's Let the Good Times Roll. He concludes at 9:56 a.m. with Rock This Joint, a 1947 track by Wild Johnny Moore.\n\nAlong the way, Boone plays some familiar songs as well _ by the Beach Boys, Stevie Wonder, the Kinks and others. It's a heady, schizophrenic mix of music, sure to delight hard-core oldies enthusiasts and students of pop's past.\n\n\"I am a die-hard pop music fan,\" Boone, 34, says, stating the obvious. \"And I try to make my show something that I would like to listen to. But it's easy to get carried away. You've got to have the talent to do the show right, you've got to keep on your toes all the time to do it right. And what's right changes from second to second.\"\n\nWhen Boone leaves the air at WHBO, the \"Kool Gold\" satellite feed takes over. It's produced out of Phoenix by the Satellite Music Network. The syndicated show, with which Boone says he shares a programing philosophy, fills the rest of WHBO's 24-hour day, except local wild man Howard Hewes' 3-6 p.m. slot.\n\nOn the Lite side\n\nMinutes after his shift, Marvelous Marvin is no longer sweating. He has walked across the hall, toting headphones and clipboard, to the studios of sister station WNLT-FM (95.7), where he will work the 10 a.m.-1 p.m. shift playing \"lite rock\" favorites by the likes of Elton John, Janet Jackson and Don Henley.\n\nHe has his printout. Three neat, 6-inch stacks of CDs sit on a shelf, his next three hours of music. Commercial cartridges are similarly arranged in a tidy pile. He turns on the mike.\n\n\"Light rock, 95.7 FM, here's kicking off another 51-minute music hour,\" he says, his rich voice slower, softer. He flicks on a song.\n\n\"When I switch shifts, I take a couple of deep breaths, and the music does the rest,\" Boone says, wearing a black T-shirt with the colorful logo of punkers, the Cramps. \"Over here it's like decompressing. It's like the difference between driving and riding. Here I can sit back and ride. It's like the difference between playing lead guitar and being in the back playing the triangle. Plus I'm warmed up when I get over here. I used to get up about 9 and mumble through the early part of my mid-day show. Now, I'm ready to read the Bible.\"\n\nIn today's radio world, it's virtually unheard of for an announcer to work back-to-back shifts on different stations. Boone also does a lot of three- and four-hour personal appearances at nightclubs. \"Maybe I have this reputation as the hardest-working man in Tampa Bay radio, but it never seems that bad,\" the deejay says.\n\nBoone's WHBO show is a labor of love. \"I make a little extra money, but not enough to warrant getting up at 5 in the morning,\" he says. \"The early shift forces me into a good mood.\"\n\nBoone does not seem concerned that during any given 15-minute period, about 1,800 people are listening to him on WHBO, according to Arbitron ratings. By comparison, the Q-Morning Zoo over at Top 40 station WRBQ-FM (105) attracts close to 50,000.\n\nThe oldies business\n\nOldies radio has become big business just like the rest of the industry. Once ghetto-ized on the AM dial, the format is now heard on at least one FM outlet in most major markets. In Tampa Bay, it's WYUU-FM (92.5), which converted to oldies from classical music last September.\n\nAlthough large nostalgia stations allow for some leeway on the part of announcers, mostly for requests, their music is researched and formatted just like Top 40 or adult contemporary or album-rock. Jocks are handed their printouts.\n\nMainstream oldies programers pull from a pool of songs that were, by and large, Top 10 hits in their day. Such stations tread lightly on '50s material. Sixties is the big ticket; early to mid '70s is now okay, too. (By contrast, WHBO is '50s-intensive and won't play anything released after 1970.)\n\nScott Robbins was program director at WHBO before departing to take over at WYUU. His programing philosophy at WHBO was looser than at WYUU, but never from the hip.\n\n\"I didn't program what I considered to be obscure oldies,\" Robbins says, adding that he respects the unique talents of Boone and Hewes. \"The reason oldies radio is successful is because it provokes memories in people. It brings back good times. How can a good memory be brought back if someone never heard the record? Just 'cause it's old doesn't mean it has to be played.\"\n\n\"What I'm doing definitely flies in the face of traditional programing theory,\" Boone says. \"But you cannot compare 1959 to 1990 as as to how stations are programed. I'm trying to re-create that ('59) atmosphere, where guys would just walk in with a box of records.\"\n\nWHBO's overall ratings have dipped from single digits to percentage points in recent months. During the winter 1990 Arbitron ratings period (Jan. 4-March 28), the station pulled an overall share of 0.6 (down from 1.1 the previous book), one of the lowest in the Tampa Bay market. (A ratings share is the percentage of people listening to radio who tune into a particular station.) In the important age group of 25-54, WHBO scored a 0.9 in the winter.\n\nBut the question remains: With ratings as low as WHBO's, does half a point really matter when it comes to selling ads for the station? \"I've worked at a lot of big radio properties,\" says William \"Tex\" Bohman, WHBO's only full-time salesman. \"And I used to be a real good Arbitron schmoozer. But I don't do that anymore. My clients don't care about the numbers. I go out and talk results, get as creative as I can, and come up with a package that I would be attracted to if I owned a business.\"\n\nWith spots costing less than $35 per 60 seconds (compared to solid three figures for ratings leaders), Bohman says he is able to bring in a lot of smaller accounts that ordinarily would not consider radio advertising. \"They can put a couple hundred a week toward advertising and get good results,\" he says. \"I defy anyone to show me an audience that's more dedicated or loyal than HBO.\"\n\nAnother question remains: How long will a large media conglomerate like Cleveland-based Metroplex Communications, which owns WNLT as well as WHBO, stick with a format that clearly represents a small return on investment? Boone admits that his labor of love could disappear in the flick of a dial.\n\nThere are rumors. \"Norman Wain, chairman of Metroplex, is involved in a new children's radio network format,\" says WYUU's Robbins. \"It's like a Sesame Street of the airwaves. It's pilot station is in Orlando, and it's designed to be satellite-delivered to struggling AMs. Rumor says that when the children's network hits the satellite, WHBO will go switch to it.\"\n\nJohn Pinch, president/general manager for both WHBO and WNLT, does not foresee a program change in the near future. \"Several things would have to happen,\" he says. \"HBO would have to lose a large share of its audience. The children's network, which is still being tested, would have to do wonderful things. WHBO is the most successful AM in the Metroplex chain. As of now, we're going to keep it the way it is. I wouldn't expect things to change in six months or even a year from now.\"\n\nPinch supports the spontaneity of Boone and Hewes. \"So many stations are programed by computer, without any kind of jock input, including our own FM,\" Pinch says. \"There's a lot of talk that maybe radio is over-researched. By letting guys like Marvin and Howard do their thing without research, they can do a better job for a specialty, boutique station like WHBO than any research director across the country.\""
