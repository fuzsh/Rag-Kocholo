        "text": "Signals from the Deep South region of the United States were heard in Northern Virginia during the first sporadic E opening of the 2023 season on May 31.\n\nSporadic E was first observed upon turning on my SDR radio at 11:17 AM, with signals mostly from the Florida panhandle and the state’s west coast were heard. At the same time, some brief signals from the Midwest, in what I assume to be a separate Es cloud, were also heard.\n\nWhile most stations were weak, some signals boomed in like locals, such as 92.1 WCTQ and 97.9 WXTB and there were plenty of RDS decodes from other stations. The opening lasted a little over an hour and had a MUF, or highest frequency skip was observed, of 105.7 FM. Most signals heard were below 103.1 FM.\n\nMy DX Logs and RDS/HD Radio Screenshots pages have been updated with the new logs below.\n\n= new station logged\n\n90.5 WBVM Tampa, FL, 801 miles over local WPER\n\n91.3 WSEB Englewood, FL, 866 miles, RDS\n\n92.1 WCTQ Venice, FL, 850 miles\n\n93.1 KHMY Pratt, KS, 1139 miles\n\n93.1 KQID Alexandria, LA, 972 miles\n\n93.5 WFDZ Perry, FL, 690 miles\n\n94.3 WTIX Galliano, LA, 953 miles\n\n94.5 WFLF Parker, FL, 762 miles\n\n94.5 KSMB Lafayette, LA, 1024 miles\n\n95.1 KICT Wichita, KS, 1099 miles\n\n97.5 WABD Mobile, AL, 814 miles\n\n97.7 WYYX Bonifay, FL, 732 miles\n\n97.9 WXTB Clearwater, FL, 790 miles\n\n97.9 WTSM Woodville, FL, 692 miles\n\n99.7 KZPT Kansas City, MO, 927 miles\n\n99.7 WOOF Dothan, AL, 683 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wdbg-997-woof-05312023.mp3\n\n99.7 WJMI Jackson, MS, 854 miles\n\n99.9 KTDY Lafayette, LA, 1011 miles\n\n100.9 WJXN Utica, MS, 865 miles\n\n101.3 KFDI Wichita, KS, 1099 miles\n\n101.9 WLMG New Orleans, LA, 945 miles\n\n102.1 KZSN Hutchinson, KS, 1098 miles\n\n102.1 KYBG Basile, LA, 1044 miles\n\n102.1 WQUA Citronelle, AL, 819 miles\n\n103.1 WOSM Ocean Springs, MS, 851 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/wdbg-1031-wosm-05312023.mp3\n\nFM radio signals from the Deep South were heard in Northern Virginia via Sporadic E on June 18, 2022. The opening began at about 7:53 PM with signals from Louisiana and Texas. About an hour later, a separate Sporadic E cloud brought in signals from Florida, while the first cloud slightly shifted to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n\nMy Airspy SDR was recording all signals from 93.3-102.3 FM, and while I was actively monitoring the entire DX band on other radios, it seemed that most of the action was within the span my SDR was recording. I didn’t hear too many signals below 93.3 FM, nor did I hear many above 102.3 FM. In fact, 101.7, 101.9, and 102.1 were the most active during the entire opening, with 102.1 KDGE from the Dallas area in for most of the two hour opening.\n\nThe opening, while having a duration of about 2 hours from start to finish, had about 45 cumulative minutes of signals heard. The MUF, or maximum usable frequency (the highest frequency skip was heard) was 106.1 FM, although the majority of signals I heard were below 102.5 FM.

I first noticed weak signals fading in briefly from both areas at 7:30 PM. At the same time, other DXers were reporting very strong skip from the Northeast into the Midwest and Deep South, among other areas, so I wasn’t alone. 92.9 KGRC, a previously-logged signal from Missouri, popped in with RDS at 7:55 PM.\n\nBy 8PM, the opening got slightly stronger, with some signals coming in over adjacent-to-local station IBOC signals. The opening ended at about 9PM.\n\nI experienced most of the opening in my car about a mile away from my home. My Airspy SDR was recording all FM frequencies from 89.1-98.1 FM. I noticed, while going over its unattended recordings, that the SDR did not pick up anywhere near as many signals as my car did. The Airspy did, however, receive a very strong signal for about 2 minutes on 92.1 FM. The station mentioned Lexington in the liner as its RDS decoded. I found this to be a positive ID for WBVX Carlisle, KY. But what surprised me was how close the station was: 385 miles, a new distance record for the shortest station received via Sporadic E. Typically, FM Es signals come in 700-1400 miles away, with ranges of 500-1500 miles generally possible via a single hop. 385 miles is very close and rare for FM Es, especially when the opening was otherwise fairly weak locally. However, since the opening was strong elsewhere, I guess I got lucky with my reception of WBVX.\n\nThe opening, while having a duration of 1.5 hours from start to finish, only had about 10 minutes cumulative of signals heard. The MUF, or maximum usable frequency (the highest frequency skip was heard) was 101.7 FM, although the majority of signals I heard were below 96.9 FM.

The skip returned at 7:10PM with two separate, simultaneous openings that shot up to the top of the FM band almost instantaneously without warning: one to the Upper Midwest, and a much more potent opening to the Deep South. The skip ended at 10:10PM, resulting in 5.5 hours of cumulative Sporadic E reception. The majority of signals from the evening opening were from Southern Georgia, an area that is extremely rare to get here in Virginia due to distance and a usual deluge of signals from Louisiana and Tkexas that usually dominate the dial when skip is coming from that region–something that was largely absent this opening.\n\nWhat set this e-skip opening apart from others in recent memory was its sheer force. Most frequencies on the FM dial were full with at least four to five stations coming in at once, making identification of any of them very difficult. Many of my local Washington, DC and Fredericksburg, VA local stations (89.7, 90.1, 92.7 97.1, 98.7, 99.1, 99.5, 100.3, 101.1, 101.5, 102.3, 107.3, and 107.9) were clobbered by Sporadic E-reflected signals, some completely gone without a trace at times. In fact, I feel the only reason why I was able to get so many new logs was that I had my Airspy R2 SDR recording all frequencies between 88.7 and 98.3 FM. Many of the new signals logged below were only received by a split-second RDS decode that I would’ve never received if I was manually dial scanning. The amount of new logs from this opening, 39, is also something I have not achieved since an Es opening on 6/12/2009. The July 13 opening also netted me my 2000th FM station logged, something I’ve been working toward since 1999.\n\nThe record breaking didn’t end there. The July 13 opening brought in the closest FM station I have ever received in 21 years via Sporadic E: 89.9 WJWJ at 453 miles. WJWJ’s state of South Carolina, with this opening, is the first new state received via Es in years, the closest state I’ve received skip from, and the only U.S. state I have received signals from both via tropospheric ducting and Sporadic E. The day’s opening also added a new estado from rarely-received Mexico to my logbook, Yucatán.\n\nMy DX Logs and RDS/HD Radio Screenshots have been updated with the new logs below.\n\n= new station logged\n\n88.9 WYFE Tarpon Springs, FL, 776 miles\n\n88.9 WWIO-FM Brunswick, GA, 568 miles\n\n89.1 WSMR Sarasota, FL, 852 miles\n\n89.1 WUFT-FM Gainesville, FL, 683 miles\n\n89.5 KYFL Monroe, LA, 934 miles\n\n89.5 WAYJ Naples, FL, 904 miles\n\n89.5 WGSG Mayo, FL, 682 miles\n\n89.7 WUSF Tampa, FL, 801 miles over local W209BY\n\n89.9 WJWJ-FM Beaufort, SC, 453 miles\n\n89.9 WMAB-FM Mississippi State, MS, 758 miles\n\n89.9 WWNO New Orleans, LA, 945 miles\n\n90.1 WXVS Waycross, GA, 594 miles over local WCSP-FM\n\n90.1 WFRU Quincy, FL, 689 miles over local WCSP-FM\n\n90.3 WJLH Flagler Beach, FL, 679 miles\n\n90.3 WHCJ Savannah, GA, 505 miles\n\n90.3 WEJF Palm Bay, FL, 758 miles\n\n91.3 WLRN-FM Miami, FL, 893 miles\n\n91.7 WMVV Griffin, GA, 529 miles\n\n92.1 WCTQ Venice, FL, 850 miles\n\n92.1 WNFK Perry, FL, 690 miles\n\n92.1 WBTR-FM Carrollton, GA, 557 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-921-wbtr-07132021.mp3\n\n92.1 WKXY Merigold, MS, 816 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-921-wkxy-07132021.mp3\n\n92.1 WZEW Fairhope, AL, 834 miles\n\n92.3 WWKA Orlando, FL, 731 miles\n\n92.3 WCMQ-FM Hialeah, FL, 906 miles\n\n92.3 WZRH Laplace, LA, 974 miles\n\n92.5 KVPI-FM Ville Platte, LA, 1014 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-925-kvpi-07132021.mp3\n\n92.5 WYUU Safety Harbor, FL, 807 miles\n\n92.5 WPAP Panama City, FL, 730 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-925-wpap-07132021.mp3\n\n92.5 WEKS Zebulon, GA, 556 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-925-weks-07132021.mp3\n\n92.9 WMFQ Ocala, FL, 717 miles\n\n92.9 WIKX Charlotte Harbor, FL, 862 miles\n\n92.9 WBLX-FM Mobile, AL, 810 miles\n\n93.1 WKRO-FM Port Orange, FL, 690 miles\n\n93.1 WFEZ Miami, FL, 894 miles\n\n93.1 WBBK-FM Blakely, GA, 672 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-931-wbbk-07132021.mp3\n\n93.5 XHPTLM-FM Tulum, YUC, 1408 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-935-xhptlm-07132021.mp3\n\n93.5 WFDZ Perry, FL, 690 miles\n\n93.5 WZFL Islamorada, FL, 965 miles\n\n93.5 WMRG Morgan, GA, 628 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-935-wmrg-07132021.mp3\n\n93.5 WKWX Savannah, GA, 645 miles\n\n93.5 KKOT Columbus, NE, 1094 miles\n\n93.7 WGYL Vero Beach, FL, 785 miles\n\n94.3 WNFB Lake City, FL, 670 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-943-wnfb-07132021.mp3\n\n94.5 WARO Naples, FL, 890 miles\n\n94.5 WFLF Parker, FL, 762 miles (received detuned on 94.467 MHz due to local 94.7 WIAD’s IBOC sideband)\n\n94.9 WWRM Tampa, FL, 803 miles\n\n94.9 WZTU Miami Beach, FL, 894 miles\n\n95.7 WBTP Clearwater, FL, 807 miles\n\n96.1 WEJZ Jacksonville, FL, 627 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/wdbg-961-wejz-07132021.mp3\n\n96.1 WHBX Tallahassee, FL, 705 miles\n\n96.1 KMRX El Dorado, AR, 936 miles\n\n96.1 WXFL Florence, AL, 617 miles\n\n96.5 WZNS Ft.

At about 9:39 AM, stations from Mississippi and the panhandle of Florida slowly came in with RDS strength. Soon afterward, a few Miami-area low band FM stations were seen, also with RDS. The paths shifted slightly to Texas and Louisiana, bringing in signals from Houston and New Orleans, respectively, before flipping back to the southeastern Florida and back to Lousiana by 11:40AM. The skip dissipated by noon, but was quickly back at about 3:12PM, this time bringing in signals from northern Minnesota and Manitoba very briefly before ending for good. All in all, about 95 minutes of cumulative skip with a MUF, or highest frequency skip was observed on, of 105.7 FM.\n\nThe opening has been the best so far in the 2021 season. Signals, although with deep fades, were strong enough to decode RDS and be “seen” under local radio station IBOC sidebands on the Airspy R2 radio. The stations received were not strong enough to decode HD Radio, nor did anything overpower a local radio station, although a few semi-local signals disappeared to skip signals.\n\nMy FM DX Log and FM HD Radio/RDS Screenshots pages have been updated with the new content below.\n\n= new station logged\n\nunID = unidentified signal\n\nStations received on June 15, first opening into the southeastern USA:\n\n88.1 unID religious talk\n\n88.1 unID ccm\n\n88.9 unID public radio\n\n88.9 unID religious talk\n\n89.1 WPAS Pascagoula, MS, 847 miles\n\n89.1 WUFT-FM Gainesville, FL, 683 miles\n\n89.1 WSMR Sarasota, FL, 852 miles\n\n89.9 unID religious talk\n\n90.7 unID jazz, suspect WWOZ New Orleans, LA, 945 miles\n\n91.7 unID religious talk\n\n92.1 KROI Seabrook, TX, 1212 miles\n\n92.1 KTSR De Quincy, LA, 1082 miles\n\n92.3 WZRH Laplace, LA, 974 miles\n\n92.3 WCMQ-FM Hialeah, FL, 906 miles\n\n92.9 WMFQ Ocala, FL, 717 miles\n\n92.9 WIKX Charlotte Harbor, FL, 862 miles\n\n93.1 WFEZ Miami, FL, 894 miles\n\n93.1 KQID-FM Alexandria, LA, 972 miles\n\n93.5 either WZFL Islamorada, FL, WBGF Belle Glade, FL, or W228BY Miami, FL (simulcasts)\n\n93.7 unID ads\n\n94.3 WTIX Galliano, LA, 953 miles over local 94.3 WLZV\n\n94.5 WJZD Long Beach, MS, 877 miles\n\n96.5 unID CHR, suspect WPOW\n\n97.7 WAVK Marathon, FL, 984 miles\n\n99.9 WKIS Boca Raton, FL, 891 miles\n\n100.7 unID ads, suspect miami\n\n101.3 unID ads\n\n101.7 unID local ads, either WCZR Vero Beach, FL, 777 miles, or W269DS North Palm Beach, FL, 819 miles\n\n102.1 unID country\n\n102.5 unID talk, suspect tampa\n\n102.9 WJGO Tice, FL, 884 miles\n\n103.1 WIRK Indiantown, FL, 821 miles\n\n103.9 unID CHR\n\n104.3 WSFS Miramar, FL, 891 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wdbg-1043-wsfs-06152021.mp3\n\n105.7 WGAY Sugarloaf Key, FL, 997 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wdbg-1057-wgay-06152021.mp3\n\nStations received on June 15, second opening into the Upper Midwest:\n\n92.5 KKWQ Warroad, MN, 1140 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/wdbg-921-kkqw-06152021.mp3\n\n92.9 unID hot AC\n\n93.5 unID french talk\n\n93.5 CJEL-FM Winkler, MB, 1255 miles\n\n93.7 unID CHR\n\n96.1 KQHT Crookston, MN, 1166 miles\n\n103.3 unID classic rock\n\n103.7 KKBJ-FM Bemidji, MN, 1072 miles\n\n103.9 unID country\n\nA few days prior, on June 11, a much briefer and weaker opening into South Florida and Bermuda brought in two previously logged signals, as listed below. Even with about 10 minutes of skip and a MUF of 92.9 FM, this opening did net my first RDS decode from Bermuda, a country rarely logged here in Virginia.\n\nStations received on June 11:\n\n89.1 ZBM-FM Hamilton, Bermuda, 829 miles\n\n89.5 unID ccm\n\n92.1 unID hot AC\n\n92.9 WIKX Charlotte Harbor, FL, 862 miles\n\nRadio signals from Nova Scotia were heard over 800 miles away in Northern Virginia during a massive tropospheric ducting event in the overnight hours of September 9, 2020.\n\nThe duct, which began shortly before midnight Sept. 8, also brought in sustained signals from Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New York with distances over 400 miles away continuously until about 11 AM. Other DXers in New England reported receiving signals from near my home in Virginia at comparable distances, and a reader in Nova Scotia told me that she also received stations from Massachusetts during the event.\n\nI turned on my radios at 11:44 PM Sept. 8 and immediately found 98.1 WCTK, a never before-received signal from New Bedford, MA at 393 miles away, booming in with decoded HD Radio. Soon after, I found more signals from throughout New England coming in.\n\nThe golden prize of the opening didn’t occur until 1:36 AM, when I discovered a weak signal from 103.5 CKHZ-FM Halifax, NS in Canada coming in right over local 103.5 WTOP. CKHZ-FM, at 813 miles away, is now the furthest radio station I have received via tropospheric ducting, unseating my previous record set in 2005 by 99.9 WQRC Barnstable, MA at 420 miles away. It also marked the first time that I received a different country on the radio dial at my home via tropo. WTOP is a very strong local signal at 21 miles away from me, so the fact that CKHZ-FM was able to come in over it is simply amazing. Two other Canadian stations from the Halifax area of Nova Scotia, previously-logged 95.7 CJNI-FM and 100.1 CIOO-FM, were also heard. All in all, I received 30 new radio stations during the opening. A list of these new stations can be found further below in this post.\n\nThe opening also gave me my first “three prong” signal–a signal that was heard separately, at different times, via the three major radio signal propagation methods: Sporadic E-Skip, meteor scatter, and tropospheric ducting. That station is Halifax’s 100.1 CIOO-FM. I first heard CIOO-FM via meteor scatter propagation on Sept. 20, 2006 and a few times since then via skip. Given limitations related to propagation and distance, having a three prong signal is very rare and it took me 21 years to get one.\n\nTropo enhancement with signals coming in over 400 miles away as observed in this tropo duct is common in the southeastern USA and Gulf Coast, but it is unheard of in the Mid-Atlantic region of the country where I live. DXers in New England will, occasionally, receive stations from Virginia and the Carolinas, but the reception is usually one way and I don’t benefit from it as the endpoints of the duct are usually out of range for me. My distant receptions to north and northeast often bottom out at New York City, which is 225 miles away. These stations are usually in for less than an hour before the duct falls apart and they disappear. To have an all-night opening bringing signals 400-820 miles away is something that just doesn’t happen in my area.\n\nThroughout the opening, many of my local Washington, DC and Fredericksburg, VA radio stations were fighting with New England stations for control of the frequency. Some local signals were simply gone off the dial without a trace, with multiple distant signals coming in all at once in place of them. The pile-up of so many signals coming in at once reminded me of the once-in-a-lifetime colossal July 6, 2004 sporadic E opening, where almost every local radio station of mine disappeared to far-away signals coming in from the Midwest.\n\nBelow is a list of the stations I received from the tropo opening, including HD Radio and RDS screenshots, which have been added to my RDS/HD Radio Screenshots Gallery page. For brevity, I have only included previously-logged stations beyond 150 miles away that I don’t usually receive at my home during DX events. My FM DX Log has also been updated with the new content.

“WeBe 108” – hot AC, 276 miles over local WLZL\n\nThe past month or so has been fairly quiet at my home in Northern Virginia in terms of FM DXing. Constant storms and unfavorable weather conditions paved the way for non-existent DX outside of regular, garden-variety enhancement of signals within 100 miles.\n\nI realized that I never posted about a few new FM logs received two months ago. Exceptional tropospheric enhancement brought in signals up over 300 miles away to the south–a rare event nowadays–during the late morning hours on July 16. 103.1 FM at my home during most tropo events is WRNR Grasonville, MD, at 61 miles away. Instead of WRNR’s AAA format, I heard oldies music while tuning by. I then caught a legal ID from 103.1 WLQC Sharpsburg, NC, a new log at 189 miles. .\n\nClick on the link below to hear audio from 103.1 WLQC Sharpsburg, NC, 189 miles away\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wlqc.mp3\n\nShortly afterward, I tuned past 91.3 FM and saw an immediate RDS decode from new log WHQR from Wilmington, NC, 317 miles away.\n\nWHQR and WLQC were added to my FM DX Log. WHQR’s screenshot was added to my RDS/HD Radio Screenshots gallery.\n\nA few days later, on July 19, I took a day trip to nearby Fredericksburg, VA. While there, I heard two new signals: 91.5 W218CV and 106.3 W292EF, both from Fredericksburg. Both stations aired a religious format and were new since my last visit to the area several years ago. Since Fredericksburg is less than 30 miles away from my home, I am adding these new logs to my FM DX Log.\n\nI was in South Riding, VA on September 7. I found translator 104.5 W283DG Sterling, VA, a recent sign-on and new signal that I had hoped to log at some point, relaying nearby 1500 WFED’s Federal News Radio programming. Since South Riding is only 21 miles NW of my home, I added W283DG to my FM DX Log and its screenshot to my RDS/HD Radio Screenshots gallery.\n\nRDS from 104.5 W283DG Sterling, VA, 7 miles from car radio in Sterling, VA\n\nIn the early morning hours of September 8, a very brief, but strong, tropo duct brought in New York, NY’s 92.3 WNYL, 97.9 WSKQ-FM, 101.1 WCBS-FM (under local WWDC), and 102.7 WNEW-FM at around 225 miles away. Trenton, NJ’s 101.5 WKXW also briefly came in over local WBQB with HD Radio at 177 miles away. The furthest signal received during the opening was previously-logged 99.9 WEZN Bridgeport, CT, at 281 miles.\n\nDuring this opening, RDS from 97.9 WSKQ-FM and 102.7 WNEW-FM decoded for the first time on my radios.\n\nI also added a new HD Radio screenshot from 101.5 WKXW.\n\nSporadic E hit Northern Virginia again on June 21, with a short, but somewhat strong, opening bringing in stations from Arkansas, Mississippi, and Tennessee. Skip was first observed on 88.9 FM at 4:26 PM when RDS from WMSB from northern Mississippi decoded. I tuned up one frequency and heard Nashville’s 89.1 WECV in local advertisements. By that time, I noticed the skip dissipating. While I was DXing WMSB and WECV, my Airspy R2 software-defined radio (SDR) was recording every FM frequency from 88.1 to 97.1. Upon later review of the recordings, I found that several other signals from the region came in around the same time that WMSB and WECV did. One station, which I did not positively identify but am almost certain it is 94.5 KJIW-FM after hearing the station in 2019 during a trip to Memphis, came in off and on until 4:37 PM. At that point, the opening ended, resulting in about 3 minutes of cumulative skip.\n\nEven with minimal skip on June 21, I still managed to get three new FM logs–something that is unheard of. The 2020 FM Es season to date, much like the 2018 season, has definitely been quantity over quality. In years’ past, I have had strong, sustained FM signals coming in from other parts of the country for hours on end, with the stations coming in right over my local radio stations. For example, look at this opening from June 25, 2018, when I received dozens of signals in a car in Connecticut while on vacation, or this opening from July 16, 2016, where I received 13 new FM logs, many with HD Radio decodes, from the upper Midwest. That is how Sporadic E should be every year. Huge openings with countless signals coming in faster than you can handle. 2020, however, has been the complete opposite–weak bursts of signals here and there for a few minutes before it is gone. Without an SDR, I would not have logged several of the new stations I have heard this summer, as the signals were coming in all at the same time.\n\nI have updated my FM DX Log and HD Radio/RDS Screenshots page with the new content listed below. Here is what I heard on June 21:\n\n= new station logged\n\n88.1 religious\n\n88.9 WMSB Byhalia, MS, “AFR” – religious, 737 miles\n\n89.1 WECV Nashville, TN, “Bott Radio Network” – religious, 548 miles\n\nhttps://fmradiodx.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wecv.mp3\n\n89.5 christian contemporary music\n\n90.3 public radio\n\n93.5 KBFC Forrest City, AR, “93.5 KBFC” – country, 799 miles\n\n93.7 KXKS-FM Shreveport, LA, “Kiss Country 93-7” – country, 1020 miles\n\n94.1 country\n\n94.5 KJIW-FM Helena, AR, religious, area Es, 777 miles"
