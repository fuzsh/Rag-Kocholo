The actual results presented reflect the Companyâs legacy Beasley Broadcast Group broadcasting and digital operations and the results from the acquired Greater Media stations. On January 6, 2017 the Company completed the sale of WFNZ-AM and three Greater Media stations in Charlotte. On May 1, 2017 the Company completed the sale of six stations in Greenville-New Bern- Jacksonville. The pro-forma results presented excluded the Charlotte and Greenville-New Bern-Jacksonville stations, as if the transaction had been completed on January 1, 2016.\n\nStation Operating Income (SOI, a non-GAAP financial measure) rose 100% year-over-year in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in SOI reflects the operations of the Greater Media stations and comparable quarterly net revenues at Beasleyâs existing stations versus the 2016 period, which does not include the Greater Media stations. Operating income of $13.2 million in the third quarter of 2017, an increase of approximately $9.4 million, or 246.9%, over the comparable 2016 period, is primarily attributable to the increase in station operating income, partially offset by the $2.5 million change in the fair value of contingent consideration on the acquisition of the Greater Media due to fluctuations in the Companyâs stock price which increased the fair value of certain preliminary purchase price accounting items. READ FULL REPORT HERE\n\nCommenting on the financial results, Caroline Beasley, Chief Executive Officer, said, âI'm pleased to report that we had another solid quarter of pro forma SOI growth. Overall, pro forma revenue was flat in third quarter and this is primarily due to softness in local and national spot revenue and the non-recurrence of last year's political revenue, which amounted to about $620,000. Excluding the impact from political, revenue increased 1%. Pro forma expenses for the quarter declined 5.2%, resulting in a 16.9% increase in SOI. In addition, our pro forma margins rose 16.7% year over year and we reduced our debt by $6 million during the quarter.

At its open meeting in November, the FCC plans to vote on an order eliminating the ban on owning a print newspaper and any radio or TV station in the same market; removing the restrictions on owning radio stations along with a TV station in the same market; revising the rule that very strictly limits the ownership of TV stations in local markets; and reversing its previous decision effectively banning the joint sale of even modest amounts of advertising time by two same-market TV stations.\n\nClearly, not every long-standing FCC rule should be eliminated or modified just because of its age. But the broadcast ownership rules fail to reflect todayâs digital media marketplace, and the FCCâs past failures to update its rules flew in the face of Congressâ directive that the Commission must every four years determine whether its rules remain ânecessary in the public interest as the result of competitionâ and ârepeal or modifyâ those that are not. Most importantly, these rules for years have caused real harm to daily newspapers and their readers, the publicâs free, over-the-air broadcast services and local TV stationsâ ability to compete against consolidated pay-TV and broadband providers and huge social media and technology companies. - PHOTO / B Christopher / Alamy READ ENTIRE BLOG HERE\n\nNETWORKS: CBS News Radio Unveils New Shows During Upfront Event\n\nTHE MOUTH, OCTOBER 30TH, 2017 ââ CBS News Radio is getting a new slate of programming for its more than 600 affiliates nationwide reports Adweek.

The Washington Post says the move is aimed at supporting economically struggling media outlets in an age of digital consumption. But critics argue it will lead to greater media consolidation and the loss of independent voices.\n\nâThe marketplace is nothing like it was in 1975,â Pai told lawmakers on Wednesday, arguing that the restriction on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership was outdated. Pointing to the massive online media industry â and the enormous advertising revenue of companies such as Facebook and Google â Pai described the FCC's media ownership rules as a form of government intervention into a major civic institution.\n\nFCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn (TL) responded saying, âThe already consolidated broadcast media market will become even more so, offering little to no discernible benefits to consumers,â Pai's announcement came a day after the FCC voted to eliminate a 77-year-old rule requiring that TV and radio stations operate a physical studio in the areas where they're licensed. Republicans at the agency said the deregulation would save the stations money, while Democrats said it would allow large media titans to better control the airwaves.

The Order retains the requirement that stations maintain a local or toll-free telephone number to ensure consumers have ready access to their local stations. The main studio rule, adopted nearly 80 years ago, currently requires each AM radio, FM radio, and television broadcast stations to have a main studio located in or near its local community. The rule was implemented to facilitate input from community members and the stationâs participation in community activities. The Commission recognizes that today the public can access information via broadcastersâ online public file, and stations and community members can interact directly through alterative means such as email, social media, and the telephone. Given this, the Commission found that requiring broadcasters to maintain a main studio is outdated and unnecessarily burdensome. The vote resulted in Chairman Pai, Commissioners OâRielly and Carr (TL) approving. Commissioners Clyburn and Rosenworcel (TR) dissenting.\n\nFollowing the move, NAB Executive Vice President of Communications Dennis Wharton commented: âNAB supports elimination of the main studio rule, which has outlived its usefulness in an era of mobile news gathering and multiple content delivery platforms. We're confident that cost savings realized from ending the main studio rule will be reinvested by broadcasters in better programming and modernized equipment to better serve our local communities. We applaud the FCC for continuing to remove unnecessary and outdated broadcast regulations.â\n\nShelli Sonstein Inks Multi-Year Extension With Q104.3 As Morning Show Co-Host\n\nTHE MOUTH, OCTOBER 25TH, 2017 ââ Shelli Sonstein celebrates an amazing 40th Anniversary on the New York radio airwaves as co-host on the âJim Kerr Rock and Roll Morning Showâ by inking a four-year contract extension with top-rated Q104.3 Radio.
