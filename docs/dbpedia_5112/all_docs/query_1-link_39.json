        "text": "There's been a lot of speculation over the last few months about the fate of American Radio Systems' Boston stations -- even an article in another radio column just a few weeks ago that authoritatively claimed Jacor would be the next owner of WRKO, WEEI, WAAF, WEGQ, and WWTM.\n\nAs of this afternoon, the rumors are over. David Field's Entercom is paying $65 million to buy the stations from CBS, which was required to sell the stations as part of the antitrust settlement of its purchase of ARS. CBS also gets two Entercom stations in Tampa, WYUU (92.5 Safety Harbor FL) and WLLD (98.7 Holmes Beach FL).\n\nAlthough it's based in Philadelphia, Entercom's first entry into the Northeast radio market came just last year with its purchase of the former Heritage Media group in Rochester. The Boston (and Worcester) stations are the company's first entries in New England.\n\nWhat happens now? Let's put NERW in analysis mode here and take a look at Entercom's new prizes:\n\nWRKO (680) tops the list in both ratings and prestige. With nearly two decades under its belt as a talker (after those 14 glorious years as a top-40 rocker), the 50 kilowatt giant remains a solid ratings performer, despite some recent turbulence in morning drive. Entercom's background is more on the FM side than AM, but recent acquisitions of AM giants like Seattle's KIRO and Kansas City's KMBZ and KCMO suggest that the company is getting more comfortable on the other side of the dial. With solid performers like Dr. Laura, Rush Limbaugh, and locally, Howie Carr in the afternoons, changes at WRKO seem unlikely.\n\nWEEI (850) and mostly-simulcast WWTM (1440 Worcester) have carved out a solid niche in the sports arena, fending off competition from the now-defunct sports weekend at WBZ (1030), as well as the mostly-syndicated fare on WNRB (1510). Along with WAAF, they'll give Entercom a solid footing among younger male listeners. On the other side of the equation, neither of WEEI's major sports franchises (the Red Sox and Celtics) has been performing well of late, and despite WEEI's 1994 move from 590 to the former WHDH at 850, it's still saddled with a directional signal that misses many western suburbs at night. WWTM helps by day, but is no more effective at reaching Framingham or Natick after dark. Entercom's only other sports outlet is KFXX in Portland, Oregon.\n\nOn the FM side, Entercom gets two rimshotters. The better of the two signals, at least in greater Boston, is WEGQ (93.7 Lawrence). The erstwhile WCGY moved its transmitter to Middleton a few years back, improving reception around Boston, but it's still hampered by second-adjacent stations in Taunton and Providence to the south. As for format, classic rock is one thing Entercom knows how to handle. Will the company's solid grasp of the format help the \"Eagle\" differentiate itself from CBS' WZLX (100.7)? It had better, if only to pull WEGQ out of the 17th place spot where it landed in the Spring book...\n\nLast on the list, but perhaps the most interesting, is WAAF (107.3 Worcester). For years, WAAF has tried to pretend it's actually located 40 miles east, even though its signal within the city of Boston can most kindly be described as \"variable.\" But with the help of plenty of advertising dollars, along with publicity that can't be bought (like last spring's \"Mayor Menino is Dead\" April Fools' stunt), WAAF continues to do fairly well in the ratings. What's more, its active rock format is Entercom's specialty. So what happens next? Well, another Entercom specialty is frequency and call shifts. This is the company that traded KCMO's 810 dial spot for WHB's 710 in Kansas City, flip-flopped its sports (KFXX) and nostalgia (KKSN) outlets in Portland, and moved the legendary WBBF calls from AM to FM in Rochester. Could WAAF finally become a legitimate Boston signal on 93.7, with Eagle getting regional reach on 107.3 (a signal which regularly draws ratings as far away as Springfield)? Wouldn't surprise us.\n\nOne more note before we move on to the rest of the week's news: Besides keeping hot AC WBMX (98.5), CBS is hanging on to one other ARS station. WNFT (1150) was not included in the Entercom sale, which leads NERW to wonder what CBS has in mind with this often-ignored station that's currently pulling R&B oldies off the satellite. Could WBZ finally get the overflow outlet that it's wanted for years? With the Justice Department satisfied, could 1150 now be flipped to sports? And what of CBS's stated committment to find minority buyers? Is WNFT's current format a clue? We don't know...but we'll keep you posted.\n\nWe'll start the rest of this week's news in NEW YORK with the sale of Albany's second public TV outlet. Sinclair has agreed to pay $23 million for WMHQ (Channel 45), with the station returning to commercial operation once the sale closes (it began its life in the 80s as commercial independent WUSV before being sold to WMHT), either as a UPN or WB affiliate. Sinclair gets an upstate New York sweep with this one -- they now own or are purchasing WUTV (Fox) in Buffalo, WUHF (Fox) in Rochester, and WSYT (Fox, with an LMA on UPN affiliate WNYS) in Syracuse, as well as a large radio group in Buffalo. There were some interesting noises in the trades this week about Sinclair being interested in buying radio stations from noncommercial operators as well -- with Sinclair honchos quoted as saying that at least one public broadcaster upstate is losing money on its commercial-licensed AM. NERW knows of only two public-radio AMs upstate -- and Buffalo's WNED (970) seems to fit the bill better than Rochester's WXXI (1370). This could get interesting...\n\nSpeaking of unfounded rumors, a followup to last month's observation that a Jacor press release listed Rochester's WVOR (100.5) as \"WHMX\": We thought Jacor wouldn't tamper with heritage calls, but then we noted that KLYF (100.3) in Des Moines, which became \"Mix\" the same week WVOR did, is taking the KMXD calls that were last seen in the market on the 106.3 in Ankeny that's now KYSY, \"Sunny 106.\" (Hey, don't we have one of those in Rochester, too?)\n\nA NERW reader passing through the Binghamton market last weekend noted modern rocker WEBO (1330 Owego) off the air. If the \"Web\" is truly gone, we're gonna miss this unusual AM radio outpost of a traditionally FM-only format.\n\nMoving further downstate on Route 17 (soon to be I-86), we'll make a turnoff to I-84 for a rare mention of the Port Jervis stations, WDLC (1490) and WTSX (96.7), which are being LMA'd by Nassau Broadcasting, the group owner that's been buying everything in sight in New Jersey and adjacent parts of New York and Pennsylvania. Nassau picks up an option to buy the stations from the Port Jervis Broadcasting Company.\n\nKingston's WBPM (94.3) has reportedly moved from CHR to adult standards. \"B94\" was notable, at least the last time NERW heard it, for running music with virtually no interruptions of any sort.\n\nNewburgh's WGNY still wants to move off 1220 again. You'll recall that WGNY moved from daytime-only status on 1220 to full-time on 1200 in the late 1980s under special temporary authority, only to be forced back to 1220 when the STA expired last year. In the meantime, WGNY had applied for expanded-band operation at 1620, and despite having its request for a waiver denied and a subsequent petition for reconsideration thrown out, the station is back at it with an application for review of the decision.\n\nAnd WVIP (1310) is back on the air in Mount Kisco. It returned last Thursday under its new owner, WGCH (1490) from nearby Greenwich, Connecticut. While WVIP is mostly simulcasting WGCH, it's already doing its own local news, with more local programming promised in the future.\n\nIn TV news, the big headline concerns non-compete agreements. Albany health reporter Sue Nigra got hers thrown out by a local judge, who ruled that after WTEN allowed her contract to expire in June, the station could not enforce a one-year non-compete to keep her from moving to WRGB (Channel 6). Across the state line, acting Massachusetts governor Paul Cellucci has signed a bill sponsored by AFTRA that outlaws non-compete clauses.\n\nThe week's other big stories in MASSACHUSETTS are also TV-related, including one of the most heated media stories of the year. The Boston Globe gave columnist Mike Barnicle a two-month unpaid suspension for allegedly cribbing some jokes from George Carlin, claiming he hadn't read Carlin's book. The Globe tried to fire Barnicle after seeing a tape of an appearance on WCVB (Channel 5)'s \"Chronicle\" in which the columnist recommended that same book. But Barnicle staged a media circus outside his Lincoln home, telling any outlet that cared to visit that he had no intention of resigning -- and after a long, loud weekend of internal and external debate, the Globe relented. Part of the deal requires Barnicle to give up at least some of his outside work, which includes commentary for \"Chronicle,\" MSNBC, and the News Hour on PBS.\n\nMeantime at Boston's NBC affiliate, WHDH-TV (Channel 7), the anchor desk did some serious spinning this week, with husband-and-wife anchor team John Marler and Cathy Marshall out the door at the end of their contracts. In to replace Marler on the 5, 6, and 11 PM newscasts is veteran Boston anchor Randy Price, whose WBZ-TV (Channel 4) career ended after a second drunk-driving incident a few years back. It's been quite a comeback for Price, who also makes no bones about being gay (which, NERW believes, would make him the first openly gay evening anchor in a top-ten TV market). As for the news philosophy WHDH owner Sunbeam espoused back when it bought the station -- you remember, the one that said anchor longevity and familiarity with the market really didn't matter? Well, in a Boston Herald interview, Price noted that the WHDH newsroom isn't just \"open-minded,\" it's also young, and it needs a \"graybeard\" like himself to balance the news newcomers who, so help us, \"don't necessarily know where Worcester is.\"\n\nWell, we know where Worcester is, and we know who's the latest victim of the Capstar cuts at WTAG (580). Upton Bell's talk show there was cancelled at the beginning of August, following by several months the firings of much of the station's news staff. NERW supposes this is a good thing for Capstar shareholders, but we'd be surprised to find many folks in Worcester who agree.\n\nAnd as long as we're in Central Massachusetts, we'll note that Marlborough's WHSH (Channel 66) has been granted a DTV CP on channel 23. Also in Marlborough, WSRO (1470) is now running Doug Stephan's \"Good Day USA\" in morning drive, with former station manager Dave O'Gara doing local news inserts.\n\nOne belated Boston note: Congratulations to WXRV (92.5 Haverhill) for the release of their Live from the River Music Hall, Vol. I CD. The \"Music Hall\" where performers like Ani DiFranco and Barenaked Ladies played for the River's audience was the original performance studio for WHAV (1490) -- and we can't imagine a better use for it!\n\nAnd up the North Shore, WNSH (1570 Beverly) remains silent, while owner Keating Willcox awaits a new (custom-built) Nautel transmitter from Canada to replace the one that was fried by a lightning bolt."
