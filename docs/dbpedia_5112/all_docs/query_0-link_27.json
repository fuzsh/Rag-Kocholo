A subscribing station may not appear if it recently changed its call letters or band, or if it was off the air during the recent reporting period. In Continuous Diary Measurement markets, Topline Ratings displays estimates in each monthly report for all stations who subscribe to the June, September, December and March survey periods. For those who subscribe only to the June and December survey periods, Topline Ratings displays estimates for six monthly reports (June, July, August and December, January and February).\n\nCopyright © 2005-2024 The Nielsen Company.
