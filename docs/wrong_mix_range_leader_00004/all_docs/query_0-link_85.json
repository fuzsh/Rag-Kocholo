        "text": "My primary field of interest is stable isotope applications to vertebrate paleontology and archaeology. I utilize stable isotopes in well preserved bones and teeth as proxies for ecological influences, diet, climate, demographics, and physiologic mechanisms. To this end I also study the preservation of vertebrate fossil material with an emphasis on the potential diagenetic alteration of original isotopic values.\n\nIn addition to my personal research I manage the Smithsonian MCI Stable Isotope Mass Spectrometry Laboratory which performs stable isotope analyses (C, N, O, H, S) for all Smithsonian units. I oversee all users of the facility, provide technical support, and consult on a variety of projects.\n\nMy current research focuses on reconstructing diet, mobility, and demographics in archeological populations through stable isotope data. I have been working with several North American 18th and 19th century sites to determine the best isotope markers for dietary preferences, region of origin, and social class. Additionally I have been collaborating on several other archaeological sites throughout the world investigating similar questions. My isotope lab also participates in numerous Smithsonian research projects examining climate, ecology, and provenance from a variety of materials.\n\nAnother main area of my research analyzes the preservation of isotope signals in museum collections. I am currently collaborating on new methods for determining quality of bone preservation, including Raman spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, and proteomics.\n\nI am also examining the effect of different chemical preservation treatments on isotope values in bones and teeth. I am attempting to determine which treatments result in isotopic exchange between applied chemicals and the original bones/teeth.\n\nMy primary field of interest is stable isotope applications to vertebrate paleontology and archaeology.
