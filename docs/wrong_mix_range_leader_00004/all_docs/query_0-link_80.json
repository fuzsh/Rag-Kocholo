Working through a memorandum of agreement, these county Farm Bureaus form the Idaho Farm Bureau Federation. The organization's influence and structure protect the interest of Idaho agriculture.\n\nWith a grassroots power of over 76,000 Idaho member families, policy generated at the county level serves as the roadmap for the organization. County Farm Bureaus maintain a relationship with locally elected officials, consumers, educators, and other local decision-making entities to ensure that growing food and fiber in Idaho remains viable."
