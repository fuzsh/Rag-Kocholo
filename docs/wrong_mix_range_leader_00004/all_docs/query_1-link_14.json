        "text": "A choose-your-own-adventure board game set in World War II occupied France, capturing the stakes and tension of espionage and resistance warfare.\n\nDarkness covers your approach as you alight on the riverbank. Swiftly, you hide the boat and shoulder your gear. The mission is clear: capture or kill your target; rendezvous at the extraction point; get out. You have two days. Nodding to your team, you set off toward the glowing lights of Vaillant.\n\nWar Story: Occupied France is a cooperative narrative game for one to six players. Your team of covert operatives is all that stands between the infamous German officer Heidenreich and the systematic destruction of French Resistance forces in Morette. Through three replayable story missions, you must exploit the specialties of your chosen agents to uncover information, enlist allies, and obtain weaponry. Engage occupying forces on tactical encounter maps, where careless positioning could cost your agents' lives. Remember, no plan survives contact with the enemy. And time is running out.\n\nNumber of Players: 1-6\n\nAges: 14+\n\nTime: 60-90 minutes\n\nComponents: 1 rulebook, 3 mission books, 80+ cards, 90+ tokens"
