        "text": "This summer, we’re partnering with Habitat for Humanity of Metro Louisville to help build a home in the community. Paired with donation dollars from Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance's Clays for a Cause event, we’ve also had the unique opportunity to help build the home alongside Habitat for Humanity’s amazing volunteer team and the soon-to-be homeowners. It’s been such a blessing to be a part of this project. We’re making great progress at the build site, and we can't wait to see this house become a home for this very deserving family.\n\nWhat a treat it was to spend an afternoon with the past generations of KFB employees at our annual retiree luncheon last week. 119 retirees returned to the State Office to enjoy lunch and catch up with old Farm Bureau friends. We are thankful for all of the hard work they put into this organization during their time at KFB, and we will continue to invest in them just as they have in us. #BigonCommitment\n\nLast week, I had the privilege of attending the Heroes for the Home breakfast alongside several of my Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance colleagues. This fundraiser benefits the Home of the Innocents, a Louisville-based nonprofit that provides support for young adults experiencing homelessness and long-term care for children with complex medical needs, among many other services. For years, KFB has enjoyed partnering with them to sponsor children through their Holiday Magic program. We’re proud to support them and the great work they do in our community.\n\nWe welcomed a motivated crew of summer interns to Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance this week. These college students will be getting hands-on experience in departments across our organization, from claims and communications to HR and legal. We are so fortunate to have these bright minds with us for the summer, and I genuinely hope this internship helps launch them into a career they’re passionate about—whether that’s here or with another company. Welcome to KFB, summer interns!\n\nRecently, I was able to virtually visit with Suzanne Alexander at RFD-TV to chat about the success of Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance's Clays for a Cause event. We had the privilege of being broadcast live on the air during their morning news segment using our company’s innovative studio space. Thanks for having me, RFD-TV! Check out the interview here > https://lnkd.in/gJP4nC5t\n\nToday, we had the honor of presenting the more than $350k raised at our fifth annual Clays for a Cause event. This year, all proceeds were designated to assist the affordable housing program run by Habitat for Humanity of Metro Louisville, and to continue the event’s ongoing support of local hunger relief efforts organized through Feeding Kentucky, GleanKY, and KENTUCKY HUNTERS FOR THE HUNGRY INC. We are so proud to partner with these organizations who place Kentuckians at the heart of everything they do. Photographed alongside me, from left to right, are: Shane Wiseman, First Vice President of Kentucky Farm Bureau; Lesley Kinney, Chief Development Officer of Habitat for Humanity of Metro Louisville; Roger LaPointe, Executive Director of Kentucky Hunters for the Hungry; Tom Hebert, Chairman of Kentucky Hunters for the Hungry; Melissa McDonald, Executive Director of Feeding Kentucky; Ben Southworth, Executive Director of Glean Kentucky; Eddie Melton, President of Kentucky Farm Bureau; and Larry Clark, Second Vice President of Kentucky Farm Bureau.\n\nIt was an honor for Kentucky Farm Bureau Insurance to host our sixth annual Clays for a Cause fundraising event, but it was even more exciting when we ended the day with a new record amount contributed. This year, we brought in more than $350,000 in charitable donations in a single day, all raised to support the fight against food and housing insecurity in Kentucky. I want to offer my sincere thanks to our event supporters for their tremendous generosity and how they’ve helped us make a significant impact on hunger and housing challenges in our state. To date, Clays for a Cause has raised more than $1.7 million in charitable donations since its inaugural shoot in 2019!\n\nAs we continue to receive updated information from the areas affected by the severe weather that swept through the state on April 2, our thoughts and prayers go out to those who have suffered damage and property losses. I say without hesitation that Kentucky Farm Bureau is prepared for situations like this, and we will do all we can to help our members recover, especially during these times when they need us the most.\n\nI’ve often said that Kentucky Farm Bureau is like one big family and that’s one of the reasons that contributes to our success. As our long-time KFB President Mark Haney transitions away from that role, I just wanted to say how fortunate I have been to work with him for so many years. He has meant so much to me, and it has been his contributions to this organization that has helped us grow and remain successful. He’s not just a co-worker, not just a friend. He is family. I wish him well in this next chapter of his career and his life.\n\nAs many times as I’ve had the opportunity to visit our nation’s capital as part of the KFB Congressional Tour, I never get tired of seeing this sight. With nearly 320 in attendance, this trip is so important to our entire organization as we meet with Congressional leaders and get updates on national issues that affect our members. To me the Capitol building is a symbol of our freedom which allows us to make our voices heard, and no organization does that better than Kentucky Farm Bureau."
