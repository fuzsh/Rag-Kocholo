        "text": "The doctor accused of sexually assaulting two patients is no longer working for Sparrow Health System.\n\nA spokesperson from Sparrow confirmed to News 10 on Tuesday, that Doctor John Laurain is no longer an employee.\n\nTwo Sparrow Health System patients, James St. Clair and Dustin Morrell are accusing him of sexually assaulting them on more than one occasion.\n\n\"Going through it has been rough. I have lost my job at Michigan State University because of it, both of us had to withdraw from school,\" said Dustin Morrell and James St. Clair, both are claiming sexual assault by Laurin.\n\nMorrell and St. Clair told News 10's Alani Letang that the assaults started in 2017.\n\nAnd, now they have decided to go public to overcome the pain they've suffered.\n\n\"And that's not the care I got, the care I got was manipulation,\" said Morrell.\n\n\"And it's quite embarrassing to come out there as a male, being molested or touched, or however you want to put it, by your physician,\" said St. Clair.\n\nSt. Clair and Morrell both saw Dr. John Laurain at Sparrow Hospital.\n\nSt. Clair started seeing him in February of 2017 for primary care.\n\n\"And I know it sounds ridiculous, like why would you continue that, and I thought I found a doctor that was gay, and was cool and, he understood me. All those things you would imagine a good doctor being,\" said St. Clair.\n\nSt. Clair said over the course of two years, Dr. Laurain would groom him and touch him inappropriately.\n\nHe claims the doctor purposely misdiagnosed a rash for more than two years so he would keep coming back for \"treatments.\"\n\n\"I think it's quite ridiculous that he would use his platform as a physician to prey on victims. Additionally, he ruins the name for physicians and he's just continuing in these footsteps that Nassar has created,\" said St. Clair.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in Ingham County, it stated that Dr. Laurain would perform several prostate exams on St. Clair without gloves.\n\nThe suit stated the exams were for the sexual gratification of the doctor.\n\nSt. Clair's fiance, Morrell saw Dr. Laurain for treatment for his Crohn's disease.\n\n\"I went and saw Dr. Laurain , I was in dire need. I was going to the ER on a weekly basis, and the ER would only allow me to have 'X' amount of medications for Crohn's,\" said Morrell.\n\nHe said his second appointment was his last one, claiming the doctor was aroused.\n\n\"He had an erect penis through his pants,\" said Morrell.\n\n\"That you could see?\" asked Letang.\n\nDustin answered yes, and added that the doctor \"made a remark about my basketball shorts and he then looked down to his genitalia, and I glanced and it was there.\"\n\nWe've asked Sparrow Health System for a comment on this story.\n\nThey released a statement saying: \"At Sparrow, the safety and well-being of our Caregivers, Patients and Visitors is our top priority. We take patient confidentiality, along with any concerns and allegations raised by any patient, family member or caregiver, very seriously. Sparrow is unable to discuss the matter in any greater detail.\"\n\nA sexual assault report has been filed with the Lansing Police Department.\n\nLARA also has an investigation open on him.\n\nYou can read the full complaint attached to this story."
