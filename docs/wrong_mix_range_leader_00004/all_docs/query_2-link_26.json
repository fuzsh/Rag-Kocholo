        "text": "John was an academic bioscientist. He always enjoyed reading art history books and visiting exhibitions, but until retirement in 2011, he had no time to do art himself; it is now a major preoccupation. He has developed art skills through local art classes run by inspirational tutors (Tim Morrison, Karen Winship, Phil Reynolds) and is fascinated by producing semi-abstracted work, often related to landscape. He has exhibited regularly in York in recent years.\n\nVenue 42\n\nEntry to studio is from the garden via the back lane in Richardson St. Follow signs and arrows on Bishopthorpe Rd.\n\nPamela Knight"
