        "text": "A few years back, in the early days we welcomed a new franchise owner into the fold. This gentleman was a textbook example of perfection during the onboarding saga—aced the training, smiled through the meetings, the whole nine yards. So, when it came time to deliver his vans, we where told it was gonna take 4 to 8 week to ship both service vans from Manitoba to a mere 30-minute drive from Toronto, Franchise stressed how Go Oil had to find a way to get the service vans to him sooner. I didn't think twice. Myself and another staff member hopped in them and drove them though North Ontario, embodying the \"go the extra mile\" spirit. Upon arrival, after a 24-hour marathon drive, I was met with gratitude but also a surprising request denial. I had assumed and hoped for a lift to the airport, considering the lengths we'd gone to accommodate his urgent start. Instead, I was offered a ride to the nearest Tim Hortons with little to no care toward myself and my coworker. I want truly stunned and at a loss of words. This was the first hint that maybe, just maybe, our definitions of going \"above and beyond\" and what Go Oil is all about weren't quite aligned. My gut started whispering doubts, but had to worry about getting a uber to the Toronto airport? Fast forward a few months, and it turned out my gut was 100% bang on. We found ourselves in the unenviable position of having to shut down his franchise due to a consistent pattern of cancellations and an apparent allergy to effort and hiring teams and just resistance to our system and how we built it. A few year later we took a page from the playbook of Brian Scudamore & Patrick Wyness, CFE, thats used at 1-800-GOT-JUNK? it's crucial to conduct the \"Beer Test.\" No, it's not about your drink of choice but rather spending time with potential franchisees in a casual setting to truly gauge their character. Had we applied the \"Beer Test\" with this particular franchisee, we might have saved ourselves a headache and a half. It's a lesson in the importance of gut instinct and the value of a beer (or coffee) in a personal setting to get to know the other side before making business decisions. Fast forward to today, standing with over 400 franchises units behind us, the attached photo captures a moment in time of our past that's both humbling and empowering. It's me, in the thick of action, repossessing two of our service vans from this Franchise who would have failed the \"beer test\". This isn't just a snapshot; it's a testament to our commitment to quality and our willingness to take the hard steps necessary to maintain the integrity of Go Oil."
