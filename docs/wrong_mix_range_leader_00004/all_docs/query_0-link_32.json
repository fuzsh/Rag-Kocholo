        "text": "With the influx of so many workers (up to 4,000) into the Chignecto area to work on the Ship Railway, the towns of Sackville and Amherst underwent a commercial boom. Immigrant workers from Quebec, Italy and Ireland, as well as engineers, site management, businessmen and visitors, had to be housed.\n\nMany new buildings were erected in Amherst and on the Fort Lawrence Marsh:\n\n◆\n\nHenry George Clopper Ketchum set up his business office at Amherst. Later the Ketchums constructed a home at Tidnish, which is now used as a summer rental accommodation.\n\n◆\n\nThe engineers employed on the Chignecto Railway also set up their headquarters in Amherst. Their residence was known as “BallyHooly House” due to the large amount of entertaining carried out there.\n\n◆\n\nA home was built by Rhodes, Curry Ltd. of Amherst for Fletcher F.S. Kelsey, Resident Manager and Engineer of the Chignecto Ship Railway. The house was purchased in 1910 by C.E. Trenholm who moved it to Upper Fort Lawrence.\n\n◆\n\nThe CMTR (Chignecto Marine Transport Railway) Cottage was constructed for the use of workers on the Chignecto Ship Railway. It has been suggested that the building was used as a cookhouse, but this cannot be confirmed.\n\n◆\n\nLabourers’ Barracks were built in various locations around the Ship Railway works. The sites of all the barracks are not known but there were two built near the Fort Lawrence terminal. One of the residences consisted of two long narrow buildings, which, in the 1940s were being used by Mr. Harley Smith to house pigs.\n\n◆\n\nThe Italians had their own barracks in a large hollow beside the railroad. The smoke from their morning breakfast fires gave rise to this location being known as “Smokey Hollow”.\n\n◆\n\nThe inhabitants of Fort Lawrence had been unable to buy goods in their town since the closing of the one local store owned by Thomas Roach. With the Ship Railway came the opening of at least two stores, one managed by C.R. Church, that sold a large range of dry goods, fabrics and groceries."
