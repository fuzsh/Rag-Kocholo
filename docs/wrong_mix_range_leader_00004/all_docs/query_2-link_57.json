        "text": "Introduction\n\nI HAVE WRITTEN THIS BOOK for my daughter Gillian and my two granddaughters Evangelie Sinfield (short name Evie) and Celestine Sinfield (short name Lettie) so that especially for Evie and Lettie they will learn much about their grandad’s life.\n\nI wish I knew more about my father’s life, especially in the years 1940–1945 when he was with the British Army fighting in North Africa. Although I have his full army records there are no details of what he did other than training and time in the army hospital. When you are young you rarely ask the questions to the elders in your family that you wish you had asked when you are much older. By then it is usually too late because when they are gone the answers to your questions have almost certainly gone with them.\n\nI think it is unusual for a person to want to write a book about himself or herself, but also, and more importantly, to have the desire, commitment and time to do it. I knew I wanted to write a book for the younger members of my family because if I didn’t almost all of my memories and experiences would disappear with me when I have gone. My daughter Gillian said to me, ‘Write it.’ So I have.\n\nThis book is not a comprehensive life story but more a compilation of things that happened to me, things I remember and things I did or experienced. I wanted to document some specific memories, experiences and events of my time and career of fifty years in the car industry. I was fortunate to join British Leyland direct from university and to have progressed through management positions to some senior Executive and Director roles in Land Rover, Rover Group, BMW Group and Honda Motor Europe. I don’t think many people alive today have worked at these senior levels for wholly owned British, German and Japanese motor car manufacturers.\n\nWhile most of this book is based on my personal memories, I have been helped in describing details and dates on some subjects and specific events by various documents and the many pocket diaries that I have kept over the years. I suppose I thought they could be useful one day and they have definitely helped me write about specific events. If anyone is thinking of writing a book about their life then I strongly suggest keeping a daily diary as it will prove to be very valuable.\n\nThe content of the book is broadly in chronological order but with the passage of time I cannot guarantee total accuracy on some dates, events or names. Where possible, and for the record, I have included the names of the many colleagues and car dealers with whom I worked in my long car industry career.\n\nI decided to stop writing in September 2019 to coincide with my reaching fifty years in the car industry. This seemed a logical point to finish my book. I was lucky in many ways, not least because I was inwardly and automatically driven to have a successful career in the industry, something I achieved and enjoyed in doing so.\n\nI hope everyone who reads this book will find some of it interesting and in places maybe a little educational.\n\nJOHN SPARROW\n\nChapter 1\n\nCar-related Life Up to 1966\n\nI WAS BORN ON 14TH SEPTEMBER 1947 at the Osterhills Hospital in St Albans, Hertfordshire, England. On my birth certificate I was named John Alexander Sparrow. At the time of my birth my father and mother were living at the home of my father’s parents at 93 Necton Road, Wheathampstead, a village a few miles north of St Albans.\n\nUntil I went to the infants’ school in Wheathampstead at the age of five, I am fairly sure there was little for me to do or to occupy myself with each day. However, I do not think I was ever bored so I must have found things to do. You have to remember in the early 1950s we had no television entertainment and I don’t remember having any books to read so I played most of the time with some small metal dinky cars and motor racing cars. I am sure my lifelong interest in motor cars started then.\n\nAround the age of four I received a small metal pedal car as a Christmas present. I remember we went on the train from Wheathampstead to Luton to buy it. The train station at Wheathampstead and the railway line from Luton to Wheathampstead to Welwyn Garden City closed in 1965 under a major closure of mainly rural railway lines in the country. However in the 1950s it was an important means of transport as very few people owned cars.\n\nAs a very young boy cars had become my main interest. My father used to come home for lunch, or dinner as it was called then, and he would have to push me round the garden in my pedal car because I wanted to go faster than I could by pedalling myself. I asked him to create two doors in the metal panelling, and a number plate with my initials on the front and back of the car, which he did. I also asked him to fit some lights on the car, which, although it was a rather extravagant request, he did as well.\n\nI suppose you could regard these requests to upgrade the specification of my pedal car as my first attempts at vehicle product development, a subject which I would become involved in during my career in the car industry.\n\nThere were around eighty houses in the U-shaped Necton Road. However, down the eastern side of the road I only remember one person with a car. Almost opposite our home at 54 Necton Road was number 69 and I could look out of our front-room window and there often on the drive was a rare and expensive Alvis sportscar owned by a Mr Jack Fegan. I don’t know what he did for a living but he must have been fairly wealthy because his Alvis was a very rare and expensive car at that time. I was very envious, because to me, even at that young age, it was an exceptionally elegant and desirable motor car.\n\nI suppose that’s the sort of thing you remember as a four-year-old. It made a great impression on me and I wanted our family to have a motor car. We were not alone as very few people in the UK had a car at that time. At first those that could afford it had to make do with pre-war used cars, as rationing and the drive for exports by the government after the war ended in 1945 restricted the availability of new cars on the UK home market.\n\nMost cars on the road at the time were made in Britain and mainly comprised Austin and Riley cars made at Longbridge, Birmingham, Morris and Wolseley cars made at Cowley, Oxford, Fords made at Dagenham, Essex and Vauxhalls made at Luton, Bedfordshire. There were relatively very few imported cars, these mainly coming from France (such as Renault), Italy (mainly Fiats) and Germany (mainly Volkswagen and Mercedes).\n\nOne of the most popular cars at the time was the Morris Minor. The Morris Minor was built at Cowley in Oxford from 1948 until 1972 and was Britain’s first car to sell over a million. A twelve-year-old 1956 Morris Minor would become my first car. More on that later. Once rationing was finally over there was a relative boom in car ownership. The car and the booming British car industry were symbols of the improving prosperity in the country.\n\nAround 1955 my father got his first motor car, a Vauxhall Wyvern saloon, with the registration number OUR342. That number plate alone would be worth several thousand pounds if we still owned it today. Up until then he travelled to and from his work as a builder, and to his local council meetings, on a relatively small motor bike, called a New Hudson. New Hudson motorbikes were a subsidiary of BSA but they stopped making them in 1957.\n\nThe arrival of my father’s Vauxhall motor car made a great difference to our life as I recall we often went out on a Sunday afternoon for a drive around the villages of north Hertfordshire. We take travel by car for granted today, but having a car then was life-changing for my family, and very exciting for me, not yet eight years old.\n\nI can’t remember anything about the eleven-plus examination. However, I must have done well in the exam because I passed and won a place at the St Albans County Grammar School for Boys.\n\nEveryone in the family was very proud of what I had achieved as I was the first person from the Sparrow family to go to a grammar school. Although I didn’t know it at the time passing my eleven-plus exam and going to the St Albans Grammar School was one of the most important events in my life as it set me on course for going to university and eventually a successful career in the motor industry.\n\nIn 1960 my father changed his Vauxhall Wyvern for a new Morris Oxford Estate. The car was bright green and had the registration number 9005 AR. I was aware that this was a vehicle purchased as a company car through Smith Brothers, where my father was a Director. This Morris was a step up from the Vauxhall.\n\nIn 1962, at the start of the fourth year at St Albans Grammar School, some important decisions had to be made about which subjects to take. These decisions would determine whether you followed a ‘science’ route or what the school called a ‘modern’ route. I had already decided I wanted to go into business in the motor industry, a dream at that point – I didn’t know what that meant in practice. Accordingly, I chose to take the ‘modern’ subjects of languages and geography which I was quite good at and enjoyed, rather than physics, chemistry and biology which I did not enjoy and which maybe not surprisingly were my weakest subjects.\n\nI had already decided that providing I passed the O-levels, I would take Geography and History at GCE A-Level as these were only a few of the subjects I could now study with Economics and Public Affairs. This was a fairly new A-Level on the syllabus and I would be taught by an excellent Welsh Schoolmaster called Gavin Thomas, who would prove to be very influential not only in the next part of my education at St Albans Grammar School but also on my decision on which university I would apply to go to.\n\nIn addition to what I would call normal school homework over the Christmas holiday at the end of 1964 I was required to research and then write a study on a local industry. I had the possibility of doing Helmets or Murphy Chemicals, both relatively small companies operating in Wheathampstead at that time, but neither of these appealed. In St Albans the most well-known company was L Rose & Co Ltd, which made lime juice cordial and lime marmalade, but that company definitely did not appeal to me.\n\nIn the end I received approval to study a local industry that did appeal to me, namely Vauxhall Motors Ltd, based at Luton, Bedfordshire. I needed to get approval because I wasn’t sure whether it could be regarded as local, even though it was only just over 7 miles from where I lived in Wheathampstead.\n\nWhile doing the research and getting to know about Vauxhall as a manufacturer of motor cars I became even more interested in the possibility of working in the car industry, hopefully after going to university. There is no doubt in my mind that being required to do research on Vauxhall Motors and then write a fairly detailed report within a few weeks greatly helped me obtain an appreciation of the motor industry business for the first time.\n\nIn March 1965 a group of us went on an Economics–Geography field course for a week to South Wales. The group comprised those of us studying Economics and Geography GCE A-Levels and we were led by Mr G. Thomas, Economics Master, and Mr E. Alexander, Geography Master.\n\nI can vividly remember being in a small group that went down the coal mine at Bargoed, an eye-opening experience into the very hard and dirty working life of the coal miners there. At the end of the week’s field course, Mr Thomas had arranged that, while we were in the Swansea area, our coach would make a short visit to University College Swansea, a part of the University of Wales at that time.\n\nThe main message Mr Thomas gave to us was this is the best university in the country if we wanted to study for a degree in Industrial Economics. He told us that he had studied there and suggested those of us who were planning to study for an Economics degree should seriously consider doing the same. The university had a great location on the Mumbles Road overlooking Swansea Bay and with my Economics Master’s recommendation, this would be seriously taken into account a year or so later when I had to decide to which university to apply.\n\nSometime into early 1966 we were asked to start thinking about which universities we wished to apply to. I wanted to study Economics at university, and so with the recommendation of Mr Thomas, I decided Swansea would be my first choice.\n\nShortly after submitting my application, I received a written communication confirming an offer of a place for me at the University of Wales, University College Swansea from September 1966, on condition I obtained three GCE A-Levels at grade C or better or two GCE A-Levels at grade B or better. At the time, GCE A-Level grades were awarded on a normal distribution curve basis so only a few people received A grades, more received B grades, even more C grades, then reducing numbers of D and E grades.\n\nWhen I received my exam results, I was delighted and relieved to find I had obtained grades more than good enough to go to the University of Wales at Swansea. I could now start to think about preparing for a life away from home.\n\nI was pleased to find out that John Bromley and Brian Wilkinson from my school in St Albans would be going also to Swansea to study for a similar BSc Econ degree, and that Stephen Jones and Richard Jones (no relations) would also be going to Swansea to study other subjects. Mr Gavin Thomas had definitely had some positive effect and influence on the five of us.\n\nChapter 2\n\nCar-related Life at University 1966–1969\n\nTHERE WAS A POINT DURING MY SECOND YEAR at university when I decided I wanted a car and so it was time to have some driving lessons and hopefully take and pass the driving test. It was clear that having a car at university would make travel easier and more convenient in Swansea, as well as giving me much more freedom and the opportunity to go where and when I wanted. In addition, it would make life much better for the long 200-mile journeys to university from home at the start of each term and the return journey at the end of each term. It should be borne in mind that relatively few students owned a car at that time.\n\nSome time during the summer of 1967 I had received a provisional driving licence and soon after my dad suggested taking me out for a lesson. I put some L-plates on my dad’s Austin 1800 and one afternoon went out with him on a so-called driving lesson. He didn’t give me much instruction or advice before we set off from home in Wheathampstead, so it was more a question of ‘see how it goes’!\n\nFor some reason he told me to go down Dyke Lane towards St Albans. Dyke Lane was a road just wide enough for one vehicle and with very few places in its mile length for two to pass. Inevitably a car was coming the other way. Rather than gesturing for the other driver to reverse, my father told me to reverse, which was not easy to do in this narrow winding road, barely five minutes into my first time of driving a car, which was also quite wide. Somehow he expected me to reverse perfectly the first time and was not happy and far from helpful when I was not doing it right. On this occasion, sympathetic and supportive as a teacher my dad was not. Based on this limited experience, I didn’t think he was a good driving instructor, so I decided that would be the last time I would go out with him.\n\nA few months later back in Swansea I booked some lessons with a driving school and was pleased to have a good instructor. I told him I had not driven before. I also decided I wasn’t going to tell my dad or the rest of the family that I was taking driving lessons. The one-hour lesson was spent driving an Austin 1100 in and around Swansea. I particularly remember we were driving for most of the time in the Townhill and Uplands areas, which meant – as the names imply – a fair amount of uphill and downhill driving content. I remember one of the hardest parts of the driving lessons was staying within the 30-mile-an-hour speed limit on some of the long downhill stretches.\n\nBefore long, my instructor was taking me on a route that I was told would probably cover most of the driving test route, and the lessons now included reversing around corners, three-point turns, hill starts and emergency stops. After five or six lessons I was told I was progressing very well and a date for my test was booked.\n\nOn the day of the driving test in March 1968 I had what I hoped would be my final lesson. I think it was my tenth, and it greatly helped that it was a fine dry day. My instructor told me that the driving test inspector I would be getting that day had the habit of saying something like, ‘When I hit the dashboard with my newspaper I want you to do an emergency stop.’ I would remember that!\n\nI felt the test was going well and I didn’t think I had made any mistakes. We were broadly following the route I knew quite well so that helped my confidence. Then near the end of the test we travelled along the road where I was told the emergency stop could take place. Shortly after I could see out of the corner of my eye that the inspector was lifting his newspaper, and at the very moment he hit the dashboard with it I jammed my two feet on to the clutch and brake so hard that his body lurched forward. For an instant I thought I was going to send him through the windscreen. As far as I was concerned, I had performed a perfectly controlled emergency stop. His face had no expression and he said nothing so at that moment I didn’t know if he agreed with me. However, I was very pleased the test inspector was wearing a seatbelt!\n\nAt the end of the driving test the test inspector again had no expression on his face and I couldn’t tell what the outcome would be. After a moment or two he just said, without looking at me, a few words I shall always remember, ‘I think I will give you a pass.’ I think I just said, ‘Thank you.’ I then received a few comments from him about the procedure I had to follow to obtain my full driving licence, which I did without much delay. I was absolutely delighted to have passed at my first attempt and thanked my driving instructor for not only teaching me how to drive properly and safely but also in preparing me for the test itself.\n\nI would be going home shortly after for the Easter holiday and I would have great pleasure telling my dad in particular and the rest of the family I had passed my driving test. In addition, I could now consider buying my first car during the few weeks on holiday and returning to Swansea for the summer term with it.\n\nI was pleased to tell everyone in the family I had passed my driving test. In view of our single unsuccessful driving lesson together I think my dad was both surprised and pleased. I told him I would hope to buy a cheap second-hand car for around £100 (about £1,700 in 2020 money) during the holiday so I could go back to Swansea with it. He said he would be pleased to help me financially with the purchase and I was very grateful to him for that help.\n\nI started looking through the motoring section of the Herts Advertiser where cars were advertised for sale. This was the local weekly newspaper and from what I remember there were not too many used cars for sale at the price I had in mind. The used cars that were advertised by franchised car dealers were too expensive for me and in the end there were just a couple of cars being advertised privately by local owners that I could afford and consider.\n\nThe car I eventually bought for £100 was a Morris Minor, registration number MAP204, first registered in 1956, so it was twelve years old. It was the model first introduced with a one-piece front windscreen, and the car I bought was bright green, with four doors and leather seats. It also had retractable red semaphores or ‘trafficators’, rather than flashing lights, mounted high up behind the front doors and which swung out horizontally, if you were lucky. These were still common on vehicles built in the 1950s.\n\nCars registered after the end of 1958 required flashing direction lights, which didn’t include my Morris. However, with the help of my friend Mike Good and the garage he worked at I had flashing direction indicators fitted to the front and rear of the Morris. For safety reasons it seemed the right thing to do. My father very generously paid for the Private Car Third Party Fire and Theft car insurance annual premium of £29.\n\nIn 1965 a requirement for seatbelt anchorage points was introduced in the UK, followed in 1968 by the requirement to have three-point belts fitted in the front outboard positions on all new cars and all existing cars back to 1965. For safety reasons again, even though there was no requirement to have them on my 1956 Morris Minor, I had front seatbelts fitted.\n\nIn due course I set out on the trip to Swansea. Six hours and around 200 miles later I arrived. I had not driven my Morris Minor or any car very far before, so this journey was a long one in every sense. But I was happy the car and I got there safely.\n\nI had some bad luck on my journey from home to Swansea in the winter/spring term of 1969. My Morris Minor suffered a breakdown on the A4 as I was entering the town of Marlborough in Wiltshire. I remember coasting down a slight decline into the town and fortunately had enough momentum to reach a small vehicle service garage. The water pump had broken so there was no way I could continue. The garage said they could fix it but not that day as they did not have the parts. So, I thought, how do I get to Swansea? I had an idea.\n\nI was aware that my flatmates John and Brian were also travelling the same route that day. I didn’t know where they were and there were no mobile phones then to call them. I asked the garage if they would let me phone the police to see if they could stop either John in his Ford Thames van or Brian in his Minivan and ask one of them to come and pick me up from the garage in Marlborough.\n\nJohn must have had a real shock when he was stopped by a police car further along the A4 and was told he had a friend who needed his help back in Marlborough. I was of course very grateful to John for coming to pick me up, but also to the police for their help in resolving what for me was an emergency. However, I am fairly sure the police in Wiltshire today would not be willing to help a broken-down motorist as they did for me.\n\nA week later I made a train journey from Swansea to Swindon, the latter being the nearest railway station to Marlborough. From there I was fortunate to hitch a lift quite quickly direct to Marlborough. I think the bad luck of breaking down was compensated by the good luck I received in getting immediate help from the local police and the good fortune to have my flatmate not far away and willing to come and get me.\n\nNot long afterwards some more bad luck. My Morris Minor was stolen from where I usually parked it in a side road near our flat in Glanmor Road. Fortunately I had some good luck when the police soon found it not far away, and I got it back undamaged.\n\nDuring our last year at university we were informed about the annual ‘milk round’ – the term commonly used in the UK to describe the procedure whereby companies visit universities each year, in order to advertise their career opportunities and recruit students.\n\nAt the time I was really only interested in joining a motor vehicle manufacturer. I had done a study of Vauxhall Motors at school and the motor industry was part of my Special Industries subject in my Economics degree. I was very clear in my own mind about the companies I wished to see when they came to Swansea. It was a shortlist of four. The motor industry companies I applied to see were British Leyland (BL), Ford, Vauxhall and Rootes. The latter made Hillmans in Coventry.\n\nWhen the companies came to Swansea it was clear the short meetings were first interviews. I recall the one with BL started with the question, ‘Why do you want to join British Leyland?’ We were in open-topped booths in a big room and I could hear other students struggling to give a positive answer. The BL management made it clear they were looking to recruit university graduates who could contribute to the success of the recently formed company, and who in time would become the future leaders of the company. That was a positive message that greatly appealed to me. I was pleased to be offered a second interview by BL and Ford but not Vauxhall or Rootes. I was told later that Vauxhall was only recruiting two university graduates that year so not getting a second interview with them was understandable. Rootes was also recruiting only a very few graduates.\n\nThe second interview with BL was held at High Hall, one of the students’ residential buildings at the University of Birmingham in Edgbaston, and I drove there in my Morris Minor. I say interview, but it turned out to be a very comprehensive two-day assessment. This included an individual interview as well as some intelligence tests and group exercises. On the first evening we had dinner and afterwards we were told to relax. We were bought a few drinks and some of us played bar billiards. However, I was conscious we were being ‘observed’ as Richard Wright, a university graduate recently recruited by BL, was there with us. I was sure he would be making his own assessment of us during the two days and would certainly be asked to convey his opinion of each of us.\n\nThe second interview with Ford was not quite what I expected. I was interviewed by a group of four managers, but what I remember most was that I was continually interrupted before I had chance to fully answer the questions they asked. I was aware this was probably deliberate to see how I reacted but I didn’t feel any rapport with the interviewers, which I had done with the BL management. In addition, there was no positive message about the benefits of joining the company and the career opportunities there.\n\nIt was not too long before I received a letter from BL offering me a position as a graduate trainee in their Austin-Morris Division at Longbridge, Birmingham, in September 1969 on condition I achieved a second-class university degree. I was more than happy to have the chance to start my career where I wanted! Soon the final degree examinations came round. I can’t say I was as confident as I should have been. In addition, there was the extra anxiety of knowing my planned career in the motor industry depended on getting a second-class degree. All eight of the exams were of three hours’ duration and were held in a short period of ten days. When I walked out of the final exam which finished on 12th June 1969, I said to myself I never want to do another academic examination again! Before long the results were confirmed and I had achieved the second-class honours degree I needed and I was happy with that. It meant I could put BSc Econ (Hons) after my name, and take the job at BL.\n\nMy time at university in Swansea had been a great experience. Living away from home had made a big impact on me because my lifestyle changed totally. I lived in a small hotel in my first year and then in a flat for two years with three good friends. I became actively involved in the Students’ Union. I played a number of sports. I enjoyed a good social life. I know I didn’t work as hard as I should have. However, having reflected on my time at university I think I achieved a reasonable balance of all these things. The next big step for me was to start my working life and career in the Austin-Morris Division"
