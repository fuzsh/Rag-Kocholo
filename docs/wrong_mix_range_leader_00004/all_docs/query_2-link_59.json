        "text": "This volume brings together for the first time some of the world’s leading authorities on the German mystic Jacob Boehme, to illuminate his thought and its reception over four centuries for the benefit of students and advanced scholars alike. Boehme’s theosophical works have influenced Western culture in profound ways since their dissemination in the early 17th Century, and these interdisciplinary essays trace the social and cultural networks as well as the intellectual pathways involved in Boehme’s enduring impact. The chapters range from situating Boehme in the 16th Century Radical Reformation, to discussions of his significance in modern theology. They explore the major contexts for Boehme’s reception including the Pietist movement, Russian religious thought and Western esotericism, as well as focusing more closely on important readers: the religious radicals of the English Civil Wars and the later English Behmenists; literary figures such as Goethe and Blake, and great philosophers of the modern age, among them Schelling and Hegel. Together, the chapters illustrate the depth and variety of Boehme’s influence and a concluding chapter addresses directly an underlying theme of the volume – asking why Boehme matters today, and how readers in the present might be enriched by a fresh engagement with his apparently opaque and complex writings.\n\nAbraham van Berkel (1639-1686), who was probably the closest friend and companion of the much more famous Koerbagh brothers, is still a lesser known figure in the history of the Dutch Radical Enlightenment. One indication of this is that, although Van Berkel did make it into the pages of Jonathan Israel’s authoritative survey, his 2001 Radical Enlightenment, he is only mentioned in passing on account of his involvement with the aborted publication of Adriaan Koerbagh’s A Light Shining in Dark Places (1668) and as the translator of Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan into Dutch. Though aptly described as a ‘precocious youth and a forceful personality with a quick wit’, Van Berkel’s own efforts as a translator are left unexamined. This is to be regretted, since the two translations that Van Berkel published in 1665 and 1667, the first of Religio Medici by Thomas Browne, the second of Leviathan, can certainly enrich our understanding of the early phase of the Dutch Enlightenment, the decade or so before Spinoza’s work would become the dominant factor. To his Browne translation, Van Berkel added a large number of explanatory and digressive footnotes, expressing his personal opinions on many controversial subjects and showing the wide range of his reading in classical and modern authors, some of whom definitely belonged to the libertine tradition (Vanini, La Peyrère). For his Hobbes translation he wrote an important preface explicitly stating the political aims of publishing his Dutch Leviathan at that particular moment in Dutch history. A close reading of the Dutch text, moreover, brings to light a number of telling deviations from the English version, one of which may well be a deliberate distortion of Hobbes’s meaning, presumably intended to better adapt Hobbesian ideas to a Dutch context. Neither the footnotes to Browne nor the translation of Leviathan have so far been thoroughly examined.\n\nLike many German idealists, Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762-1814) and his philosophical works have had a problematic reception in the Anglophone world. This paper aims to examine one of the earliest moments of the reception of Fichte's works in the Anglophone world: the first fully translated texts during the mid-19th century. It can often be difficult for the historian of philosophy to demonstrate substantial influences of one individual on another, let alone one individual's impact on a national context. This problem is exasperated when that individual is one of the German idealists, due to the fact that these philosophers were mired in controversies during their lifetime. This paper attempts to circumvent these problems by taking recourse to an intentionally limited approach. It will reconstruct the circumstances and reception of the first Anglophone translations of Fichte's texts. While historically limited, this approach has several advantages. For one, in the case of translators we can be sure that at least one person read and, at least to a certain degree, understood one or more of Fichte's texts. This obviates the main problem in most accounts of reception, which is that they are generally forced to take into account second- or third-hand transmissions of ideas, which, while having the advantage of showing larger historical developments, are of lesser interest to those seeking to demonstrate a substantial transmission of philosophical ideas. The translator of philosophical texts, while traditionally not acting as a philosopher, oftentimes betrays the context in which he became interested in the text, allowing for a characterization of both the context of discovery (i.e. \" How did the translator come to know Fichte and his texts? \") and a context of justification (i.e. \" Why did the translator think the translation of Fichte's texts would be of use to the Anglophone world? \"). Whereas the first context allows us to show the material the translator was exposed to, the second context discloses his motivation for deciding to make the texts available to his own linguistic context, which, as we'll see, reveals significant features of the native social concerns for which Fichte's philosophical texts are considered to be a part of \" the solution \". Secondly, the fact that these texts were not just published in England, but also in the United States, makes it possible to speak about an Anglophone reception, due to there being a degree of standardization, both in the presentation of the texts and in the text itself. With this rather lean methodological approach I aim to show that it was social rather than academic concerns that initially made Fichte an attractive candidate for publication. This article will also, in a small way, contribute to the understanding of the rise of the reading of Fichte’s work as “split” around 1800, as would later be famously argued by Martial Gueroult (see section 7)."
