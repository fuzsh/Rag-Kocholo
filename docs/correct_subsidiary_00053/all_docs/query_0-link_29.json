        "text": "Service models aligned with your priorities for efficient operations, reduced costs and enhanced quality.\n\nThe medical equipment service model selected has a direct correlation to the quality, efficiency and cost to maintain your imaging and biomedical assets. GEâ€™s goal is to help you to determine and implement an optimized model, based on your size, scale and needs.\n\nWe start by helping evaluate and benchmark your actual cost. We review warranties and service agreements to help you pinpoint exactly what you are spending. We help identify opportunities to improve and standardize your service model from a cost and quality perspective and look at alternatives ranging from a fully outsourced program to in-house enablement models, supporting your team on-site, remotely and as needed.\n\nOptimize asset utilization and the return on your capital investments, reduce budget variability, improve access to equipment, and enhance quality of care.\n\nAnother significant driver for increased costs stems from the growing medical asset inventory. Most healthcare organizations own more imaging and clinical assets than ever, which results in higher operational and capital costs.\n\nOur specialists work closely with you, using your system data to measure staff and equipment performance. Medical equipment data are combined with benchmark analytics, to make decisions regarding asset utilization and technology planning. At the same time, we work to identify potential training gaps and changes that could improve workflow and increase patient capacity.\n\nEvolve and adapt to changing needs and cost pressures while also meeting regulatory requirements.\n\nGE strives to develop new innovations and ideas that go well beyond medical equipment service and maintenance. Our goal is to ensure that your service program grows and adjusts to changing needs and challenges to enable sustainable improvements and success."
