        "text": "We had a strong first year as a standalone company. Our execution throughout the year allowed us to raise guidance twice. We have continued to increase our R&D investment, launching over 40 new innovations tied to our care pathway and digital strategy. As a result of our investments, we estimate that we gained global market share in equipment in 2023. Once again, we topped the FDA's list of AI-enabled device authorizations, with 58, more than any other medtech company.\n\nBacklog remains robust, led by an improved capital equipment landscape. We significantly strengthened our balance sheet as we paid down $1 billion in debt since the beginning of the fourth quarter. Our financial flexibility enables us to drive both organic and inorganic investment, such as the Caption Health and IMACTIS acquisitions completed in 2023. Recently, we announced our plans to acquire MIM Software, which I'll explore in greater detail later.\n\nWe continue to build our position as a trusted partner. Here are a few highlights from throughout the year.\n\nOn the commercial side, we secured multi-year enterprise deals globally with contract values totaling approximately $2.5 billion in 2023, fueling our growth. We also expanded our 40-year relationship with University Wisconsin - Madison by entering a 10-year strategic collaboration that goes beyond medical imaging to new frontiers in digital technologies and disease-focused solutions.\n\nSeparately, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and BARDA – a division within the US Department of Health and Services, are funding programs totaling over $80 million dollars that will allow us to develop new AI applications for ultrasound to benefit patients in low and middle income countries and patients with lung pathologies and traumatic injuries. We also announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk to advance the clinical and product development of peripheral focused Ultrasound.\n\nWe have assembled a strong, world-class leadership team. Jay Saccaro joined us last year and has had an immediate impact. He's had the opportunity to assess our organizational needs, forecasting models, financial systems, and processes, and is adding significant strategic and operational value. Similarly, Taha Kass-Hout, MD, MS joined us as Chief Technology Officer more than a year ago. He's been charting our digital future and strategy, while building a high-performing team of top healthcare technology experts.\n\nIn 2023, GE HealthCare published its inaugural sustainability report, highlighting our progress and commitment to corporate responsibility and risk management.\n\nWe introduced 2024 guidance today. Our outlook reflects an improved capital equipment landscape. It also reflects continued strength on top of two consecutive years of high-single-digit Organic* sales growth. Similar to last quarter, we conducted a survey of a broad set of U.S. customers, which supports our forecast for 2024. Our latest survey showed improved financial performance optimism and capital budget outlook versus the last survey in October. Global procedures remain strong. All of this points to a constructive set-up for the year.\n\nThrough an emphasis on R&D, we continue to innovate across our four segments. Our New Product Vitality index, which measures new products contributing to orders in the year, was healthy at 26%.\n\nWe launched more than 40 new innovations in 2023 as I noted before, many of which are AI and digitally enabled - bringing more opportunity to increase gross margin with these enhanced capabilities.\n\nI also noted our plans to acquire MIM Software, a leader in AI-enabled image analysis and workflow tools across multiple care areas. Once integrated post close, MIM is expected to drive accretive topline growth. We expect the transaction to be neutral to Adjusted EBIT* in year one and accretive thereafter.\n\nOne of the dilemmas our customers face is integrating the variety of multi-vendor AI applications into their workflows. Our new App Orchestrator is a solution that simplifies the AI selection, integration and workflow process for healthcare professionals. By providing easy access to pre-validated apps, we're helping reduce the pressure that often comes with the overhead of evaluating, acquiring, and implementing solutions from many companies. We’re in the process of developing this subscription-based application for the cloud.\n\nOur high-growth, high-margin AI solutions are designed to increase productivity, efficiency, and diagnostic confidence. Customers have the option to purchase new AI-equipped devices or as an upgrade to existing equipment. We are actively pursuing AI across our product portfolios, with a focused effort to expedite product development in 2024.\n\nDelivering precision care\n\nOur unique portfolio of PET-MR, PET-CT, and multi-head SPECT-CT, radiotracers, and digital solutions offers providers a comprehensive solution to deliver on this growing field of diagnostics and therapeutics.\n\nAs novel therapies become more widely available, our tracers play an increasingly important role, putting us at the center of this transformation of care that will help enable better patient outcomes across many care pathways as functional imaging expands.\n\nThis chart illustrates the diversity of our pharmaceutical portfolio – both existing and in the pipeline – and the diseases that each one uniquely targets.\n\nWe see growth opportunities for our existing products like Vizamyl for patients with suspected Alzheimer's disease as new therapies ramp up and Cerianna for metastatic breast cancer, which are both used in conjunction with PET systems for diagnosis.\n\nFlurpiridaz, a pipeline product for diagnosing and assessing coronary artery disease, is expected to significantly advance PET CT imaging. Cardiologists say it shows promise for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, it has the potential to offer more sensitivity and specificity than SPECT and technetium, which is the standard of care. Its longer half-life may allow doses to be ordered and transported longer distances, unlike the other products on the market which require on-site production, which can be a limiting factor for smaller hospitals and cardiac imaging centers.\n\nOne of the most exciting advancements in molecular and functional imaging is Theranostics. There’s a motto for this rapidly growing field that it allows you to see what you treat and treat what you see.\n\nTheranostics combines diagnostic imaging equipment, radiopharmaceuticals, both diagnostic and therapeutic, with a goal of eliminating cancer cells without affecting healthy tissue, and this has fewer side effects for patients. This approach can bring significant improvements for many cancer types, and one of the reasons why Molecular Imaging has a very promising future.\n\nTo give some perspective, currently, the overall Theranostics market, which includes equipment, tracers, and therapies is approximately 9 billion dollars and is expected to grow to 40 billion dollars by 2032.\n\nToday, Theranostics is primarily used in thyroid, neuroendocrine and prostate cancer. However, a growing pipeline of drugs across the industry for future applications including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancers show even more promise to potentially extend the length and quality of life for more patients. We expect to play an important role in the delivery of these new therapies.\n\nIn the next three years, we plan to significantly increase our current Theranostics franchise through a combination of organic and inorganic expansions. We're excited about the opportunity to be a trusted partner, helping our customers navigate this important and growing field of medical imaging.\n\nThis mission to improve outcomes across care pathways will be enabled by our announced intention to acquire MIM. After close, we plan to integrate these new capabilities into GE HealthCare’s devices to enhance imaging fusion, multimodal inputs for diagnostics, therapy planning, and monitoring. By leveraging these new tools across various care areas, we can differentiate our solutions for the benefit of patients and healthcare systems worldwide, particularly around Theranostics.\n\nIn closing, we are excited about the growth potential of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics as well as our pipeline pharmaceuticals, and the collective opportunity for these innovations to enable precision care.\n\nTo summarize, I’m extremely proud of our team's execution in 2023 and our focus on patients and customers, as well as the progress that we've made as a standalone company. We achieved or exceeded the financial and operational objectives we laid out at the beginning of the year. We are making significant progress on the innovation front, including digital and AI launches. We have a strong balance sheet that allows us to invest in new capabilities organically and inorganically. We are excited about our momentum as we enter 2024, and we remain on track to deliver on our medium-term targets.\n\n*Non-GAAP financial measure.
