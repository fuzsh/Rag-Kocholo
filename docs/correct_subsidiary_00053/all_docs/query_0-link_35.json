Dr. Fong’s research examines the mechanisms that underlie clinical response and resistance to immunotherapies. This work includes tracking antigen-specific T cell responses in treated cancer patients and developing biomarkers that are associated with clinical outcomes. The Cancer Immunotherapy Program that he directs performs early phase and high risk clinical trials across different disease indications. This program also includes a translational laboratory that performs mechanistic studies on samples derived from patients undergoing treatment. Throughout his career, Dr. Fong has received multiple awards including the NIH Outstanding Investigator Award.\n\nDr. Fong obtained his BA from Columbia and MD from Stanford. He completed internal medicine training at University of Washington, and oncology fellowship and post-doctoral training at Stanford in 2002. He then moved to UCSF as an assistant professor where he is now a distinguished professor. He is an elected member of Alpha Omega Alpha and the American Society for Clinical Investigation.
