        "text": "We review our previous work on the dynamic structure factor S(k,ω) of liquid Ge (&quot;-Ge) at temperature T = 1250 K, and of amorphous Ge (a-Ge) at T = 300 K, using ab initio molecular dynamics [Phys. Rev. B67, 104205 (2003)]. The electronic energy is computed using densityfunctional theory, primarily in the generalized gradient approximation, together with a plane wave representation of the wave functions and ultra-soft pseudopotentials. We use a 64-atom cell with periodic boundary conditions, and calculate averages over runs of up to about 16 ps. The calculated liquid S(k,ω) agrees qualitatively with that obtained by Hosokawa et al, using inelastic X-ray scattering. In a-Ge, we find that the calculated S(k,ω) is in qualitative agreement with that obtained experimentally by Maley et al. Our results suggest that the ab initio approach is sufficient to allow approximate calculations of S(k,ω) in both liquid and amorphous materials. ∗ Electronic address: jdchai@wam.umd.edu † Electron...\n\nThe structure of glassy GeSe9 was investigated by combining neutron diffraction with density-functional-theory-based first-principles molecular dynamics. In the simulations, three different models of N = 260 atoms were prepared by sampling three independent temporal trajectories, and the glass structures were found to be substantially different from those obtained for models in which smaller numbers of atoms or more rapid quench rates were employed. In particular, the overall network structure is based on Sen chains that are cross-linked by Ge(Se4)1/2 tetrahedra, where the latter are predominantly corner as opposed to edge sharing. The occurrence of a substantial proportion of Ge-Se-Se connections does not support a model in which the material is phase separated into Se-rich and GeSe2-rich domains. The appearance of a first-sharp diffraction peak in the Bhatia-Thornton concentration-concentration partial structure factor does, however, indicate a non-uniform distribution of the Ge-c..."
