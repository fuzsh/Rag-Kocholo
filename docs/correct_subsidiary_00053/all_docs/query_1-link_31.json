Young people of all ages grow to idolize athletes and organizations, propelling attachments that last a lifetime. This interest has spawned multibillion dollar industries ranging from advertising, clothing, lifestyle brands, media, and entertainment. In turn, millions of young Americans aspire to build their professional careers around sports in various forms.\n\nThe Analytics and Business of Sports Minor aims to equip students with the perspectives, knowledge, and lessons about leadership, ethics and analytics that transcend beyond any one industry.

These risks all have financial consequences. The management of risk is increasingly important in the USA and worldwide. For-profit and not-for-profit enterprises (from charities to government) find themselves confronting risks and the resulting financial consequences daily. Business managers from all areas of expertise need to be prepared to prevent and address risks in order to survive—the ultimate goal of most enterprises.\n\nThe Risk Management Minor provides a student with a tool kit for contemplating, identifying, prioritizing, and formulating approaches to manage varying types of risks inevitably faced. The Risk Management Minor allows for six hours of free electives (inside or outside of McCombs) as there are many types of risk a particular student might be faced with (e.g., financial crisis risk, natural disasters (from hurricanes, tsunami to volcanoes and fires), cyber risk (from identify theft, fraud, mobile commerce risks to phishing and hacking, etc.), risk of political and other crises disrupting supply chains, terrorism and the reality that all enterprises operate in an increasingly vulnerable and connected infrastructure). For example, over 90% of the Fortune 500 companies have created an insurance company subsidiary designed to help them manage their risks internally (a captive insurer). This allows for some degree of managerial control and risk transfer to protect the firm. Companies need increasingly active risk management expertise to survive.\n\nWho Should Consider The Risk Management Minor?\n\nThe Risk Management Minor is designed for both business and non-business majors who expect to someday work in a management position, including entrepreneurs. Examples include all Business majors who plan to pursue an entry-level job in supply chain, finance, manufacturing, insurance, management information systems, marketing or other business functions. Non-business majors can be students in liberal arts, economics, actuarial science, petroleum engineering, retailing, communications, health care, or students from any other discipline who want to understand the impact of risk and the management of risk for their future employer.\n\nRisk Management Minor Application and Coursework Requirements\n\nThe Risk Management Minor is both structured and flexible to allow the student to pursue interests in discipline-specific risks as well as general risks that any enterprise might face.\n\nAdmission to the minor requires upper-division standing and is based on a student's overall academic record, including but not limited to, number of hours completed, rigor of courses taken in residence, and the overall University grade point average.\n\nTo fulfill the Risk Management Minor, students must complete 18 semester hours of coursework as described below; 12 hours are business coursework: six hours of risk management, three hours of accounting and three hours of finance. An additional six elective hours relevant to risk management are selected by the student, with a maximum of three hours allowed from the McCombs School of Business. Students admitted to the Risk Management Minor must contact their home college to have the approved minor added to their degree profile, otherwise they cannot receive transcript recognition upon completion of the requirements.\n\nAt least half of the coursework (nine hours) must be completed in residence at The University of Texas at Austin. All coursework must be taken on the letter-grade basis and completed in conjunction with the student's major requirements at the time of graduation.
