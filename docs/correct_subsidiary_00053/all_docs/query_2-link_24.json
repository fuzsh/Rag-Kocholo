        "text": "GE HealthCare has unveiled new precision care tools to enhance the accessibility of technologies and solutions for the global practice of personalised medicine.\n\nThe company has developed new MINItrace Magni device, designed to be a small-footprint, cost-effective cyclotron for in-house production of commercial PET tracers and radiometals.\n\nWhen produced together with GE HealthCare’s TRACERcenter, the radiopharmaceuticals help physicians identify and diagnose clinical signs across oncology, cardiology, and neurology.\n\nThe technology will help clinicians offer several tracers to their patients and encourage the practice of precision care locally, helping fuel in-house Theranostics capabilities.\n\nTheranostics is a treatment modality that combines diagnostics and therapy and is being increasingly used by clinicians seeking more personalised medicine.\n\nThis approach leverages imaging techniques for accurate diagnoses and measuring molecular responses to therapy.\n\nGE HealthCare molecular imaging & computed tomography president and CEO Jean-Luc Procaccini said: “It’s not enough to develop cutting-edge solutions if they aren’t also made more accessible to clinicians and patients around the world.\n\n“While there is still much work to be done, we are proud to offer a variety of technologies that can evolve with healthcare system needs and help support a patient’s entire care journey.\n\n“In the hands of clinicians, these tools help make the practice of precision care more accessible and aim to help improve patient outcomes globally.”\n\nGE HealthCare has widened its Omni platform with Omni Legend 21cm, a performance-focused PET/CT designed to help healthcare systems meet growing needs across care areas.\n\nThe system features an advanced 21cm digital detector for augmented NEMA sensitivity, along with deep learning reconstruction capabilities, and advanced digital solutions, and is scalable.\n\nGE HealthCare also unveiled Clarify DL, a new deep-learning reconstruction technology trained on bone SPECT images, to reduce noise while maintaining contrast.\n\nIt is designed to deliver clear, accurate, and effortless imaging, unlike other noise reduction techniques, which typically lower contrast and resolution and may impact accuracy.\n\nThe AI-powered solution is intended for GE HealthCare’s advanced StarGuide digital SPECT/CT that scans patients in 3D to provide more information to clinicians.\n\nStarGuide’s 12 CZT detector design is optimised for certain theragnostic procedures, which may allow clinicians to pinpoint the size, shape, and position of lesions with superior accuracy.\n\nIt also offers flexibility in patient scanning, and workflow efficiencies to reduce complexities and time in Theranostics, along with scanning protocols, such as Dynamic SPECT imaging."
