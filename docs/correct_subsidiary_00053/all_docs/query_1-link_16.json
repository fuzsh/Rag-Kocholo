        "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ: JUNO), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, today announced it has appointed Jay Flatley to its Board of Directors. Mr. Flatley is Executive Chairman of Illumina, Inc.\n\nA successful entrepreneur, Mr. Flatley brings to Juno’s board his considerable experience building a highly successful and innovative healthcare company. He served as CEO of Illumina from 1999 to 2016, and during his tenure grew the company’s annual revenue from just over $1 million to more than $2 billion, and he oversaw the growth of the company from 20 employees to over 5,000.\n\n“Jay is one of the great leaders in healthcare of the last two decades,” said Hans Bishop, Juno’s President and CEO. “We are eager to draw on his experience as an executive who knows how to build a company with leading edge technology and science into a commercial success. We are thrilled to have him help guide Juno into our next phase.”\n\n“Juno has great science, a talented team, and a compelling mission,” said Mr. Flatley. “I am looking forward to bringing my experience to the Juno Board and working with management to help the company meet its goals of bringing transformative medicine to patients.”\n\nUnder Mr. Flatley’s leadership, Illumina was named multiple times to the Deloitte & Touche Fast 50 and Fast 500 lists, as well as to the Forbes 25 Fastest-Growing Tech Companies, the Fortune 100 Fastest-Growing Companies (2010 and 2011) lists, and recognition by MIT Technology Review as the World’s Smartest Company in 2014.\n\nMr. Flatley chairs the Board of Directors for an Illumina subsidiary, Helix. He is also an Advisory Board member for UC San Diego’s Moore Cancer Center, serves on the Boards of Directors at Coherent and Denali, and is on the Board of Trustees of the Salk Institute. He previously served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Molecular Dynamics, later acquired by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and now a part of GE Healthcare. Mr. Flatley received a B.A. in economics from Claremont McKenna College and a B.S. and M.S. (summa cum laude) in industrial engineering from Stanford University.\n\nABOUT JUNO\n\nJuno Therapeutics is building a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. Founded on the vision that the use of human cells as therapeutic entities will drive one of the next important phases in medicine, Juno is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill cancer. Juno is developing multiple cell-based product candidates to treat a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors. Several product candidates have shown compelling clinical responses in clinical trials in refractory leukemia and lymphoma conducted to date. Juno’s long-term aim is to leverage its cell-based platform to develop new product candidates that address a broader range of cancers and human diseases. Juno brings together innovative technologies from some of the world’s leading research institutions, including the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Seattle Children’s Research Institute (SCRI), the University of California, San Francisco, and The National Cancer Institute. Juno Therapeutics has an exclusive license to the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital patented technology for CD19-directed product candidates that use 4-1BB, which was developed by Dario Campana, Chihaya Imai, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. Juno’s product candidate JCAR017 was developed in collaboration with SCRI and others.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements regarding Juno’s mission, progress, and business plans.
