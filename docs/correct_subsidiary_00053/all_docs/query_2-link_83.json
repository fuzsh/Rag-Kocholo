        "text": "GE Healthcare has launched its new all-digital PET/CT platform, Omni Legend, which has been designed to enhance operational efficiency.\n\nThe system includes a new digital BGO (dBGO) detector material with a tiny crystal size for providing more than twice the sensitivity compared to previous digital scanners.\n\nIt also enables more small lesion detectability and quick overall scan times.\n\nOmni Legend is intended to improve patient experience and expand diagnostic power to improve patient outcomes.\n\nIt has theranostics capabilities, the capacity to image short-lived tracers, as well as dynamic protocols.\n\nThis allows the platform to provide more clinical information across more cardiology, oncology, and neurology treatment types.\n\nThe company stated that Omni Legend has been developed to help healthcare systems overcome problems with a collection of intuitive workflow solutions improved by artificial intelligence (AI), including its new Precision DLi solution for deep learning image processing in PET/CT and AI-based Auto Positioning Camera.\n\nGE Healthcare Molecular Imaging & Computed Tomography president and CEO Jean-Luc Procaccini said: “We built our scalable Omni platform from the ground up to meet the needs of our customers and their patients today and in the future.\n\n“With the patient in mind, we leaned on our longstanding technological leadership and strong clinical collaborations to enhance the scan experience with entirely new components designed to help improve clinical outcomes.\n\n“The result is an all-digital detector, a cutting-edge deep learning solution, and workflow enhancements to help enable more personalised care.”\n\nOmni Legend includes the company’s PET image reconstruction technology, Q.Clear, and its deviceless respiratory motion correction technology, MotionFree.\n\nAccording to GE Healthcare, the operational efficiency solutions of Omni Legend help in improving the PET/CT imaging experience for the technologist and the patient.\n\nThe company claimed that the system has a fast data quality assurance process which helps in saving time with streamlined calibration.\n\nIt also has a gantry touchscreen for simplified protocol selection, and a new user interface for an easy PET/CT process from start to finish."
