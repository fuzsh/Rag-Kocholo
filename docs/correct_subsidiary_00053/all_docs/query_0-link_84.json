        "text": "Our Mission is to conduct world-class research in biochemistry and molecular medicine. To excel in undergraduate, graduate and medical education, and to serve the university through leadership in forums committed to graduate and professional school admissions and curriculum.\n\nThe research interests of the departmental faculty are focused in the fundamental molecular aspects of cell biology, gene expression, cancer biology, membrane biology, glycobiology, neurobiology, muscle physiology, human genetics, chemical and structural biology, molecular imaging and drug development. In addition to innovative research activities, faculty are involved in the teaching and training of medical and doctoral students.\n\nAt the Davis Campus, the department maintains laboratories at Tupper Hall, the Genome Building and in the Department of Chemistry. At the Sacramento Campus, the department maintains laboratories at the Oak Park Research Building, Research I and III Buildings, and the MIND Institute.\n\nThe department’s primary research funding comes from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, and a wide variety of Private agencies.\n\nThe department’s teaching focus includes Lower Division courses, Graduate courses, and Professional courses for medical students.\n\nEach of us has an obligation to the community and the UC Davis Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine strives to build and maintain a culture and climate based on mutual respect and caring. We recognize and cherish the richness contributed to our lives by our diversity. We further recognize the right of every individual to think, speak, express and debate any idea. We support and uphold the UC Davis Principles of Community.\n\n2024 Joan Oettinger Memorial Award Recipient\n\nProfessor Yuanpei Li has been selected as 2024 Joan Oettinger Memorial Award recipient. In recognition of this achievement, Dr. Li will be acknowledged at the UC Davis School of Medicine Spring General Faculty Meeting on May 22, 2024.\n\nThe Joan Oettinger Memorial Award for outstanding lung or cancer research is given annually. This notable award is named in honor of Ms. Oettinger, a UC Davis graduate student who died of lung cancer in 1970.\n\nCongratulations on this well-deserved award!\n\nSchool of Medicine celebrates implementation of modernized curriculum\n\nDr. Colleen Sweeney, is among the five UC Davis School of Medicine faculty members that were honored this week for their key roles in the implementation of a revamped curriculum that modernizes medical education.\n\nThe curriculum, known as I-EXPLORE, has transformed what students learn and how they learn during their four-years of medical school. It was developed by faculty, residents, staff and students – with input from hundreds of others – quickly and during trying circumstances, including the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nRead more about the news article »\n\nLuis Carvajal-Carmona appointed as the Associate Vice Chancellor for the Office of Academic Diversity (DEI/OAD)\n\nProfessor Luis Carvajal-Carmona, has been appointed as the Associate Vice Chancellor for the Office of Academic Diversity (DEI/OAD). Congratulations!\n\nRead more about the news article »\n\nDavid Olson appointed as the founding director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics\n\nAssociate Professor, David Olson has been appointed as the founding director of the Institute for Psychedelics and Neurotherapeutics. Congratulations!\n\nRead the entire news article from here »\n\nFor more news, see Department News »\n\nLuis Fernando Santana, Ph.D.\n\nProfessor and Interim Department Chair\n\nDr. Santana has had a long-standing interest in cardiac and vascular biology with an emphasis on ion channels, Ca2+signaling, and Ca2+-dependent transcription factors. He joined the Institute of Neurobiology of the University of Puerto Rico as an assistant professor in 1999. Two years later, he accepted an offer to join the Department of Physiology and Biophysics of the University of Washington (UW). Dr. Santana worked at the UW for 14 years. In July 2015, Dr. Santana left the UW to become the Chair of the Department of Physiology and Membrane Biology of the University of California, Davis (UC Davis).\n\nDr. Santana has discovered multiple kinds of Ca2+ signaling modalities and now focused on how they control excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac and arterial smooth muscle. He has a passion for mentoring and teaching. Indeed, he is the co-director of the Academic Research Careers for Medical Doctors (ARC-MD) and M.D./Ph.D. programs."
