Introduction\n\nThe purpose of a computer simulation is to gain insight into the behavior of an actual physical system or process. To achieve that specific objective, a model system is developed that represents or emulates the given physical system. A suitable algorithm subsequently generates a time series or an ensemble of states (“observations”) for the model system. Finally, an analysis is conducted by calculating various system properties from these states (certain properties may also be monitored during a simulation). In the present context, the word “simulation” usually refers to the process of generating states by numerically solving a set of differential equations for the selected degrees of freedom (state variables) of the given model system. Many computed system properties are measured by experiment as well so that an explanation of the observed experimental data is immediately available based on the model system and the simulation results. More importantly, one can also observe behavior that is inaccessible to experiment and test “what-if” scenarios (e.g., mutation studies). As a result, simulation techniques have become invaluable tools for modern research as they complement experimental approaches. With the continuing advance of computing power, such tools will only further increase in importance.\n\n1.1. Classical Molecular Dynamics Simulations\n\nMolecular dynamics (MD) is one such simulation technique [1,2]. It aims at deriving statements about the structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties of a molecular system. The latter is typically a biomolecule (solute) such as a protein, an enzyme, or a collection of lipids forming a membrane, immersed in an aqueous solvent (water or electrolyte). In the case of proteins and enzymes, the experimental protein structure as deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [3] serves as a starting point for MD simulations. If no structure is available, one must resort to modeling (predicting) the structure for which several techniques are available, such as homology or comparative modeling [4]. In atomistic “all-atom” MD (AAMD), the model system consists of a collection of interacting particles represented as atoms, describing both solute and solvent, placed inside a sufficiently large simulation box, where their movements are described by Newton’s laws of motions. An algorithm such as velocity-Verlet or leap-frog [2] is employed to advance over the course of many time steps the state of the model system as a function of time (see Figure 1 for a schematic view of a basic MD algorithm). A single state consists of the combined values of the atoms’ positions and velocities (or momenta). To advance the state, forces acting on particles are computed from a model or empirical potential energy (“force field”), a function of particle positions, which includes all types of “non-bonded” interactions, such as electrostatic and Lennard-Jones forces, but also various types of “bonded” potentials for preserving the structural integrity of the given biomolecular system. The latter include harmonic potentials for maintaining bonds, bond angles, and “improper” dihedrals as well as terms for dihedrals. Some force fields include the Morse potential for a more realistic representation of bonds, while others may account for explicit electronic polarization effects. An extensive discussion of force fields is given by Monticelli and Tieleman [5]. Of note, various force fields have been developed for different types of molecules. In the context of our review, force fields for proteins [5], biological lipids [6], and small molecules [7] are of particular relevance (see Table 1 for examples of current commonly used force fields). Force fields are also employed to compute energies in molecular mechanics (MM) applications [8]. Such simulations are usually conducted under conditions of constant temperature and pressure to mimic laboratory conditions for which special algorithms are available. In addition, to emulate a very large molecular system, several techniques for artificially extending the size of the model system have been developed. The most common one is the periodic boundary condition (PBC). Here, an infinite number of replicas of the central simulation box surrounds the central box. Due to the long-range character of electrostatic interactions, special techniques such as Ewald-based methods are required to include the interactions between the particles in the central box and their replicas. In the course of a simulation, successive states at regular time intervals are stored in a trajectory for later analysis. Typically, in AAMD, the time step is 1–2 fs (1 fs = 10–15 s) and the system size is in the order of tens of thousands of atoms (including solvent). A larger number of software packages for MD of biomolecules are available, for example, GROMACS [9], AMBER [10], NAMD [11], and CHARMM [12].\n\nEarly applications of AAMD were concerned with rather simple systems such as liquid argon consisting of just 864 atoms [36] and covered the ps (10−12 s) time scale. The first MD simulation of a biomolecule was achieved by McCammon et al. in 1977; bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (58 residues) was simulated for 9.2 ps [37]. Nowadays, µs (10−6 s) timescale is easily achieved with relatively small proteins [38], wherewith larger systems, this is reachable if state-of-the-art computational power is available [39]. More typically, MD of larger biomolecular systems attain hundreds to thousands of ns (10−9 s). MD excels in focusing on the dynamical aspects of a given protein or enzyme in relation to its function. Applications include, for instance, estimation of affinities ∆bG⊖ (the standard Gibbs free energy of binding) of ligands for proteins using the so-called free energy perturbation (FEP) methods [40], the inclusion of charge fluctuations in constant pH AAMD [41], folding of small proteins [42], and the simulation of ion channels [43]. Additional examples are also listed in the recent reviews by Cavalli and collaborators [44] and Hollingsworth and Dror [45]. Recently, one of the largest atomistic simulations was reported by Rommie Amaro’s group where they simulated an explicitly solvated influenza A viral envelope in a phospholipid bilayer [46], a system of ca. 160 million atoms, for approximately 121 ns. Another study by Jung et al. reported the first atom-scale simulation of an entire gene with a billion atoms [47].\n\nIt is worthwhile to stress that MD is meant to explore the configuration space (the set of all values of positions and momenta). In the widely used ligand-protein docking one also needs to sample the configuration space using a similar force field as in MD in order to optimize the location and binding mode (a “pose”) of the ligand on the surface of a given protein (receptor) [48]. However, the sampled configuration space is frequently restricted to a specific region of the protein, while also only specific portions of the protein and/or ligand are allowed to fluctuate (e.g., only the protein’s side chain are displaceable, while the main chain is kept rigid). The outcome of such docking studies is a small set of possible complexes, typically ranked according to the force field employed. Dynamical information is not obtained from ligand-protein docking studies, but some measure for the affinity of the ligand for the protein may be obtained. In fact, the lack of a proper description of systems’ true dynamics is one of the biggest caveats of docking [49]. Therefore, frequently after selecting one of the complexes (usually the highest-ranked complex), an MD simulation is conducted to explore the complex in much greater detail [50].\n\n1.2. Faster and Longer without Atomistic Details: Coarse-Grained Simulations\n\nWhile the advancements of the “traditional” AAMD have been very impressive, the limited length (nm) and time scales (ns to µs) attainable in AAMD still poses a severe limitation when studying molecular processes that occur on much longer time scales (e.g., protein (un)folding, protein–membrane association) and/or require much larger length scales (e.g., very large protein tertiary structure or protein–membrane systems). In standard AAMD, atoms serve as particles. In coarse-grained MD (CGMD), 4 to 6 atoms (or more) are grouped together to form “beads” that serve as the particles of the model system. A similar procedure may be applied to the solvent as well [51]. For instance, in the Martini force field [52], initially designed for studying biological membranes modeled as lipid bilayers at the coarse-grained level, four water molecules form a single water bead. As a result of such coarse-graining techniques, the number of particles is significantly reduced in comparison to AAMD of the same system, while the interaction potential energy surface is also much smoother so that a much longer time and larger length scales are attainable by CGMD, but at the expense of atomistic details. It otherwise relies on similar algorithms and associated techniques such as PBC in AAMD, with time steps ranging between 20 to 60 fs. The Martini force field, one of the first force fields for CGMD, has seen important applications and developments since its first installment and is now also employed for the analysis of lipid membrane properties, protein–lipid interactions, oligomerization of membrane proteins, the self-assembly of soluble peptides and proteins, the prediction of protein conformational changes, binding and pore-formation in membranes [53,54]. A recent and far more elaborate overview of applications according to the Martini model is also given by Marrink and Tieleman [55]. There exist also more extreme versions of coarse-graining. It is quite possible and even desirable in some applications to completely remove the atomistic details of the solvent and replace it with a structureless polarizable continuum. This approach is commonly employed for the prediction of acid dissociation constants of titrating sites in proteins as well as for the calculation of affinities of ligands for proteins [56].\n\n1.3. Zooming into the Details of Chemical Reactions: Quantum Mechanics Simulations\n\nWhile MD is extremely useful for the investigation of molecular properties at a longer time and larger length scales, it cannot be used to study the details of chemical reactions in the active site of enzymes, simply because current MD techniques cannot properly handle bond-breaking events. The MM force fields commonly in use for MD enforce links between specific particles to ensure that they remain together to prevent a complete destabilization of the molecular structure. Consequently, changes in the electronic structure are not included in MD simulations. That, however, can be accounted for with quantum mechanics (QM). A typical QM calculation solves the (time-independent) wave equation to estimate single point energies, bond distances and angles, partial charges, spectroscopic properties, various thermodynamic properties, interaction parameters (for instance for use in classical force fields employed in MD), and so forth, thus providing a very detailed description of the given chemical system. This can be completed for any given atom configuration. Because QM is computationally rather demanding, it is not possible and actually not even necessary to treat the full molecular system (i.e., protein and solvent) at the quantum level [57]. Commonly, the enzyme system is divided into a quantum motif (QM part) or region that includes the active site of a given enzyme plus a relevant portion of the substrate or ligand, while the rest of the system including the solvent is considered as part of a classical environment (MM part) adhering to a force field like those in AAMD. The QM part should include all relevant residues and chemical groups that are expected to play a role in the (proposed) reaction mechanism. Failing to do so may result in erroneous statements regarding the reaction mechanism and the binding mode of the substrate. It is also useful to repeat the calculations with different sizes of the QM motif, excluding a particular residue to discover the role of that residue in the mechanism. Numerous applications can be found in the literature on the use of QM/MM for studying the details of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions [58]. Relevant to such studies is the identification of the correct protonation states of titrating sites, especially of those residues or chemical groups directly involved in the reaction [59,60,61].\n\nIn this review article, we aim to give a broad overview of the current and emerging applications of MD in drug discovery and design-related processes as well as in pharmaceutical formulation/product development. The review introduces the basic concepts of MD, describes the principles of various commonly used methods and approaches in relevant contexts, as well as illustrates many practical aspects and limitations of MD with respect to the particular tasks at hand. However, detailed theoretical accounts of various methodologies are beyond the scope of the review. We hope that this piece of work could serve as an introductory synopsis to many scientists that have no (or little) experience in MD and wish to combine their experimental research with appropriate computations (either in collaboration with computational scientists or if attracted to the method, by themselves). In the following paragraphs, we will discuss how MD can help explore the dynamics and function of different drug targets or evaluate drug-target interactions. We will also look at the intricacies of simulating different biological systems, such as membrane proteins or intrinsically disordered proteins. Moreover, the growing role of MD in the field of computational pharmaceutics is analyzed in light of several examples. Many focused reviews have been recently published on the application of MD in drug discovery [44,45,62,63,64,65,66]. Some recent reviews can also be found on drug formulation and drug delivery aspects, e.g., [67,68,69,70].\n\n2. Molecular Dynamics in Drug Discovery\n\n2.1. Exploring the Dynamics and Function of Drug Targets\n\nContemporary drug discovery processes start commonly with identifying and validating a biologically relevant target that can be modulated with drug molecules to prevent or cure a disease or alleviate symptoms of sickness (Figure 2). Drug targets are often different proteins, such as receptors or enzymes, but may also be DNA or RNA molecules. Protein conformation is one of the biggest approximations in ligand design because proteins are dynamic and can undergo various conformational changes. Even minor conformational changes that involve movements of residue side chains can affect the complementarity between the ligand and the binding site of a protein. Since protein flexibility crucially affects the range of possible target conformational states for ligand binding, MD simulations can provide important information on the dynamic character of the target with regard to drug design.\n\nThe following paragraphs present studies of selected target proteins or protein groups that highlight the flexible nature of proteins. MD simulations have been necessary for studying these proteins’ dynamics and function and understanding how they bind with small molecules or other proteins. Specifically, sirtuins have several ligand-binding sites, and understanding their dynamics may give insights into the development of selective inhibitors or activators. Additionally, one of the ‘Holy Grails’ of cancer drug discovery is direct inhibition of oncogenic RAS proteins [71]. RAS proteins are small, dynamic, and difficult to drug. Therefore, a proper understanding of their dynamics may provide the necessary key for drugging them. The other two examples include a group of highly flexible, intrinsically disordered proteins, and a group of immunological proteins that are currently being actively investigated and developed as biological drugs, i.e., antibodies. Both protein groups play an important role in many therapeutically significant protein-protein interactions. Especially MD simulations of proteins belonging to the former group need improved methodologies to obtain meaningful results.\n\n2.1.1. Ligand-Binding Dynamics of Sirtuins—In Search of Therapeutic Regulators\n\nSirtuins are a family of proteins that function as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases. In mammals, there exist seven sirtuin proteins (SIRT1–7) that have histone and non-histone targets. Sirtuins have diverged tissue distribution and subcellular localization; nuclear (SIRT1/6/7), mitochondrial (SIRT3/4/5), and cytosolic (SIRT2) [72]. Sirtuins have an important role in gene silencing and expression, in cell metabolism, and tumorigenesis [73]. The function of sirtuins depends on the physiological conditions and tissues, and they can either stimulate or prevent signaling pathways [74].\n\nThe structure of sirtuins contains a conserved catalytic core of about 275 amino acids. The catalytic core is formed by a typical Rossmann fold domain that binds NAD+ and a zinc-binding domain (Figure 3). There are four flexible loops connecting these two domains. These loops form a tunnel in which the substrate interacts with NAD+ in a deacetylation reaction. The binding site of NAD+ is divided into three pockets A–C: The ADP ribose moiety binds in the A and B pocket (residues Asn286, Glu288, Arg97, Ala85, Gln167, His187 in SIRT2) and nicotinamide moiety in the C pocket (residues Ala33, Gly34, Thr37, Phe44, and Asp43 in SIRT2). Inhibitors often bind into the C-pocket. In addition, sirtuins have N- and C-terminal extensions of variable length that can affect the enzymes’ function as these terminals are targets to posttranslational modifications. Over two decades, several compounds have been developed to bind into the pockets A-C and to regulate the function of sirtuins (reviewed in e.g., [75]). However, there is still no approved sirtuin regulator/inhibitor in the clinic. One of the challenges has been the flexible nature of the substrate and cofactor-binding sites.\n\nFor many years, there was no crystal structure of human sirtuins with any co-crystallized regulator available. The binding site of putative regulators in sirtuins is mostly formed by flexible loops and, thus, the conformational state of these enzymes crucially affects the prediction of binding modes of small-molecule ligands. Therefore, MD simulations have been applied to generate different sirtuin conformers to explore the possible ligand-binding conformations. MD was first used for SIRT2 in the year 2008 to generate multiple conformations for an ensemble docking approach [76]. In another study, a set of short (from 400 ps to 10 ns) MD runs were performed for SIRT2 with GROMACS 3.3.1 employing the GROMOS96 force field [77]. The compounds under investigation were then docked using Gold 3.2 [78] to each SIRT2 snapshot structure in the ensemble. Several binding modes were observed for the SIRT2 inhibitors with an N-(3-phenylpropenoyl)-glycine tryptamide backbone. Interestingly, the MD simulations suggested an extended binding area of C pocket for the SIRT2 inhibitors, which later was experimentally observed for a highly selective SIRT2 inhibitor, SirReal2 [79].\n\nThereafter, several MD studies of SIRT2 have been carried out by Sakkiah and coworkers [80,81,82,83] using GROMACS with either GROMOS96 or AMBER03 force field [84]. In one study, they performed 5-ns MD simulations for the SIRT2-sirtinol complex and the apo structure of SIRT2 to identify alternative binding pocket conformations for the enzyme [80]. The SIRT2 conformations from the MD runs were clustered and three representative structures were selected for receptor-based pharmacophore modeling in order to screen for novel SIRT2 inhibitors. Their other study on the conformational changes of the SIRT2 substrate and inhibitor binding sites revealed the dynamic role of Phe96 in binding the inhibitor in SIRT2 [81]. They further investigated the role of the inhibitor-binding residues by simulating the docked complexes of five known inhibitors with SIRT2 for 20 ns [82]. The stability of the complexes was evaluated by monitoring the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the protein Cα atoms and the root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) of the protein residues as well as the inhibitor-protein hydrogen bonding interactions along the simulation trajectory. All compounds had established favorable binding interactions and stable binding poses after about 10-ns simulation. The detailed analysis of the interactions revealed that hydrogen bonds formed between the inhibitors and especially Arg97 and Gln167 are important for the inhibition of SIRT2 activity. Further MD simulations by the same research group suggested crucial conformational differences between the wild-type SIRT2 and two mutants, thus providing insight into the design of more potent SIRT2 inhibitors [83].\n\nIn an attempt to understand more about the role of C- and N-terminals of sirtuins, MD simulations were carried out to explore the terminal regions’ effect on the enzymatic activity of SIRT2 [85]. The results of the simulations performed with GROMACS 4.5.5 and the all-atom AMBER ff99SB-ILDN force field [86] suggest that the C-terminal region of SIRT2 can partially occlude the NAD+ binding pocket or stabilize the NAD+ in a non-productive state, thus functioning as an autoinhibitory region.\n\nMD studies have also been applied to study the dynamics of other sirtuins than SIRT2. For example, SIRT1 simulations have been utilized to screen for novel inhibitors and to study the interactions between ligands and the protein [87,88]. In another study, the binding modes of 2-anilinobenzamide derivatives in SIRT1/2/3 were investigated by 30-ns MD simulations with the AMBER 11.0 simulation package using the ff03.r1 [84] and ff99SB [14] force fields to explain the isoform selectivity of the compounds [89]. According to the RMSD of the ligand-bound structures, the dynamic stability was achieved at 20 ns. Furthermore, Sinha and coworkers [90] studied the stability of sirtuin-inhibitor complexes with the high-speed simulation software Desmond [91] employing the OPLS2005 [17] force field. After carrying out a virtual screening of plant-derived compounds against SIRT1-7 by docking and scoring, they identified sulforaphane, kaempferol, and apigenin as hits. Multiple 20-ns MD simulations were performed for the top-scored poses of these compounds in the respective sirtuin structures. The results suggested that sulforaphane bound stably in SIRT1 and SIRT5, kaempferol in SIRT3 and apigenin in SIRT6, and the critical ligand-protein interactions remained throughout the simulations. In another recent study [92], natural compounds were identified as potential SIRT1 activators. Stable binding of mulberrin, quinine, quinidine, gartanin, and nicotinamide in an allosteric SIRT1 site (i.e., other than the catalytic site) was demonstrated in 50-ns MD simulations with AMBER. These ligands did not disrupt the functionally important hydrogen bonds between Arg234 (allosteric site) and Asp475, His473, or Val459 (catalytic site) of SIRT1, which was concluded to be consistent with their experimentally shown ability to activate the enzyme.\n\nThere is only little experimental information on the structure of SIRT7. A recently published study reported a homology model of SIRT7 [93]. Three 1-μs long MD simulations with GROMACS (AMBER03 force field) were used to investigate the stability and dynamics of the model structure. The simulations showed that the model of SIRT7 in complex with NAD+ and acetyl-lysine was stable, suggesting that the model was built properly. In addition, the simulations suggest that the N-terminus of SIRT7 may play an important role in assisting to hold the substrate in the active site during the catalytic reaction.\n\nAdditionally, the co-factor binding to sirtuins has been studied with MD simulations. Desmond together with the OPLS3 force field [25] was employed to simulate SIRT1 and SIRT3 in complex with either NAD+ or NADH and an acetyl-lysine substrate for 250–500 ns [94]. The simulations suggested an opening of the enzyme structure and an alternative binding site for the dihydropyridyl moiety of NADH instead of the C pocket. Furthermore, two persistent hydrogen bonds were observed between NAD+ and Ile347/230 and Asp-348/231 in SIRT1/3 whereas the corresponding bonds were missing if NADH was bound.\n\nOur case of sirtuins exemplifies that protein flexibility is important to take into consideration in designing ligands that target dynamic binding sites such as that in sirtuins. Although current flexible docking approaches can take into consideration some features of the target protein flexibility, MD is clearly a useful method for studying not only protein flexibility affecting ligand-binding but also larger structural arrangements in dynamic drug targets. Our next case further highlights how understanding protein dynamics can be a key to facilitate the design of potent therapeutic compounds against highly dynamic drug targets such as RAS proteins.\n\n2.1.2. RAS—Uncovering the Conformational Dynamics of a Challenging Anticancer Drug Target\n\nMore than 150 members belong to the Ras superfamily of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) [95]. The subgroup of the Ras family comprises 36 proteins, including the oncogenes HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS. As KRAS may undergo alternative splicing, these three RAS genes encode four proteins: HRAS, KRAS4A, KRAS4B, and NRAS (referred to as RAS from now on). RAS proteins share high sequence similarity and mainly differ in their membrane anchoring hypervariable region (HVR) [96]. GTPases, including RAS proteins, have a built-in switch mechanism that allows the protein to adopt an active conformation, capable of binding effector proteins when GTP is bound [97]. Thus, RAS activity is controlled by the bound nucleotide, GDP, or GTP. The nucleotide exchange from GDP to GTP, i.e., RAS activation is facilitated by guanine exchange factors (GEFs) [98,99]. Inactivation of RAS occurs upon GTP hydrolysis to GDP. RAS bears low intrinsic hydrolytic activity, which is greatly enhanced by GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) [98,99]. For a more comprehensive picture of RAS biology, the reader is referred to review [100].\n\nHyperactivation in RAS signaling is related to diseases, especially to cancer [100]. Altogether, RAS mutations appear in around 17% of all human cancers, whereas KRAS mutations contribute to the majority (69%) [101]. KRAS mutations are frequently observed in solid tumors of the pancreas, colon, and lung; NRAS in melanomas; HRAS in head and neck as well as in bladder carcinomas. RAS isoforms display different mutation preferences; for instance, KRAS mutations appear most often in Gly12 (81%) whereas NRAS in Gln61 (62%). Not only are RAS isoforms different [102,103], but also oncogenic mutants of the same isoform even at the same position are dissimilar (e.g., KRAS G12D vs. KRAS G12R) [104,105,106,107,108]. Due to their major role in cancer, RAS proteins are highly attractable drug targets and, thus, the focus of major drug discovery efforts [71].\n\nRAS related research has been intense already for several decades since the discovery of these oncogenes in the early 1980s [109]. However, these small GTPases are difficult-to-drug and previously, were considered as undruggable targets [71]. The reason for this is that, first, there is no obvious druggable small-molecule binding pocket in RAS. A pocket beneath the switch-II was revealed only after G12C-targeting covalent compounds were disclosed [110]. Of note, the existence of this pocket (as druggable) was not evident from the available crystal structures at the time. Since then, potential pockets on the effector protein binding interface have been described [111,112,113,114]. Second, RAS proteins are active at the membrane, which plays a significant role in their function [115]. Third, a major obstacle in drugging RAS is its highly dynamic character (Figure 4). These difficulties related to targeting RAS, together with the discrepancy among the oncogenic mutants, clearly highlight the need for a better understanding of these oncoproteins. To this end, mastering RAS conformational dynamics comes into play.\n\nIn order to adopt all potential binding conformations with various effector proteins and with its regulators, RAS needs to be highly dynamic, especially on the switch regions (Figure 4). Even though recent crystal structures have demonstrated multiple conformational states of RAS, in all crystal structures of KRAS, the switch regions, when not disordered, are stabilized by crystal contacts [122]. Therefore, the structural data is unable to fully describe the dynamics of the switches. To capture the dynamics of these cryptic switches, which is beyond the currently available experimental methods, MD simulations can be utilized [123].\n\nRecently, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of KRAS G domain (excluding the HVR) dynamics by classical all-atom MD simulations, including wild-type KRAS and all G12 missense mutants (G12A, G12C, G12D, G12R, G12S, G12V) bound to both nucleotides GDP and GTP [124]. Perhaps unsurprisingly, with an aggregate of 170 μs simulation data, we observed highly dynamic behavior in the switch regions. Interestingly, principal component analysis (PCA) not only highlighted differences among GDP and GTP bound systems but also revealed unique profiles for each mutant. Finally, by utilizing Markov state modeling (MSM), as reviewed in [125], we were able to capture discrepancy among GTP-bound G12D, G12R, G12V, and wild-type KRAS in their long-timescale dynamics. Each system populated MSM derived metastable states differently. We anticipated that the shift in protein dynamics, occurring especially in switch regions, may lead to modulated KRAS mediated signal transduction among the mutants, as was demonstrated before between wild-type HRAS and G12V [126]. Indeed, it was later confirmed that G12R mutant, for which MSM revealed a unique profile, exhibits different effector protein binding compared to G12D; it is defective for interaction with PI3Kα [108]. Our results demonstrated that a G12 mutation located in the P-loop (Figure 4F) is capable of shifting KRAS’ dynamics in distant regions of the protein that are responsible for effector protein binding [124]. How is this possible as no evident direct interactions from this position to switches were observed in the simulations? A putative explanation is that the shift in the dynamics will occur via a hydrophobic interaction network. Through this network, mutant KRAS may alter the protein dynamics in an allosteric manner, inflicting changes in distant sites of the protein. In this interaction network, hydrophobic hubs (displaying more than three hydrophobic interactions) include the residues V14 and A146, which when mutated are associated with altered RAS dynamics [106,127]. In another study, MD simulations revealed highly dynamic characteristics for the switches even when there exists a covalent inhibitor beneath the switch-II [128]. Importantly, the inhibitor AMG 510 appeared extremely stable regardless of the switch movements. These open conformations and high flexibility of the switches that were revealed by the simulations are not observed in the crystal structure (most likely due to the crystal packing effects) [129].\n\nOn top of the convoluted switch dynamics, another layer of complexity in KRAS dynamics exists: RAS rotational dynamics on the membrane (Figure 4G). On artificial lipid nanodiscs, monomeric KRAS was shown to exist in different configurations, named occluded and exposed, where the effector protein interaction-surface-forming switch regions are occluded or exposed to RAS effectors [121]. The rotational dynamics of KRAS were captured in single 20 μs MD simulations of KRAS mutants G12D, G12V, and Q61H, where three distinct major orientations of RAS were observed [130,131]. Recently, impressive 1.45 ms MD simulations (290 individual simulations of 5 μs) were conducted to further study dynamic orientations of wild-type KRAS4B at the membrane with different lipid compositions [39]. Still an unclear issue, however, is the relevant oligomerization state of KRAS at the membrane. It may exist in monomeric, dimeric, trimeric, or a higher oligomeric state [132,133,134,135,136]. Overall, small GTPase proteins’ rotational and translational dynamics on the membrane, which has a substantial influence on RAS oligomerization, is not well understood [137]. Importantly, this should not be neglected as RAS dimerization may have an important role in oncogenicity and drug therapy efficacy [138]. Approaches to obtain a better understanding of RAS signaling on the membrane are ongoing, and for instance, a structural model of RAS–RAF signalosome was recently reported by Shaw et al. [139]. For further information on RAS-related MD simulations and dynamics, the reader is referred to reviews [122,140,141].\n\nTaken together, MD simulations have uncovered RAS conformational dynamics at the atomic level and provided further insights into RAS biology. Conformational states derived from MD simulations, which are not captured by experimental methods, could be utilized in RAS targeted drug discovery. Finally, understanding RAS dynamics may be a guide in deciphering mutant RAS functionality and point out potential vulnerabilities of these oncoproteins at the atomic level, which could be targeted directly or indirectly.\n\nIn the next section, we will be introducing drug targets of the future, a group of extremely flexible proteins whose dynamics may be investigated with MD simulations to complement the data derived with various experimental approaches.\n\n2.1.3. Extremely Challenging Targets—Intrinsically Disordered Proteins\n\nIntrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are the type of proteins that in physiological conditions lack a stable tertiary structural arrangement and instead exist as conformational ensembles. Apart from fully disordered proteins, many folded proteins contain intrinsically disordered regions (IDPRs). IDPs are associated with multifunctional roles as they can undergo conformational arrangements to different folds, depending on the particular binding partner [142]. The formation of ‘fuzzy’ complexes, where the disorder is maintained upon binding to the partner, has also been shown to be important in many biological processes [143]. The structural characteristics and the individual state of conformation in such proteins are dependent upon the type of amino acids forming the disordered segments [142,144,145]. There are many web-servers and computational tools available for accurate prediction of IDPs and their molecular functions (comprehensively reviewed in [146]). In addition, there are databases that store experimentally determined IDPs and IDPRs, e.g., DisProt [147].\n\nThe abundance of IDPs in the human genome, their importance in biological functions such as cellular signaling, and their involvement in various pathological conditions make them an attractive target for drug design [148]. Although the lack of a defined tertiary structure poses a challenge for rational structure-based drug design strategies, there is evidence that small molecules and peptides can be designed to target the protein-protein interactions of IDPs with their ordered binding partners (reviewed in [148,149]). Experimental techniques such as NMR spectroscopy or small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can be used to characterize the conformational ensembles of IDPs although the quantitative data on the dynamic processes can be difficult to interpret regarding the unambiguously identified motions [150]. On the other hand, MD simulations suit perfectly for describing atomic motions and, thus, MD-based approaches can be valuable in studying the conformational dynamics of IDPs and their binding mechanisms to the partner proteins. However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed [149].\n\nFirst, the extremely large number of degrees of freedom present in IDPs poses a challenge for proper sampling of the conformational space of the protein. Therefore, MD algorithms with enhanced sampling techniques such as replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) [151] (see Figure 5) are often used to efficiently overcome energy barriers in the IDP conformational landscape.\n\nSecond, when simulating IDPs, it is crucial is to pay attention to the selection of the applied force field since most of the available protein force fields have been developed for proteins that have stable folded structures. Thus, general protein force fields tend to overpopulate certain secondary structures or compact, collapsed structures over the extended ones [154]. Experimental structural data have been used to guide the development of novel or updated force fields for both all-atom and coarse-grained simulations, such as FF14IDPSFF [155], FF14IDP [156], FF99IDP [157], A99SB-ILDN [158], CHARMM36 IDPSFF [159], and AWSEM-IDP [160]. Third, the applied solvent model needs to be carefully selected as in IDPs, the solvation effect plays a greater role. Novel solvent models such as TIP4P-D [161] facilitate the protein-water interactions and disfavor collapsed protein structures. However, depending on the studied IDP, such models may underestimate the transient tendency of an IDP/IDPR for folded structures, in which case a traditional water model could give better results [162]. Table 2 lists some examples of MD simulation studies of biologically relevant IDPs employing different force fields and solvent models.\n\nFrom the studies listed in Table 2, it is worth discussing in more detail how Jin et al. [163] mapped the conformational ensemble of the unbound disordered dimerization domain of the transcription factor c-Myc using REMD. Subsequent (conventional) MD simulations of the inhibitor-bound c-Myc domain gave the authors valuable insight into the constantly changing binding interactions and binding sites of the inhibitor at c-Myc (the conformational ensembles looked as if there were ‘ligand clouds’ around ‘protein clouds’). The obtained information was later utilized when Yu et al. [172] selected representative conformations of these different c-Myc binding sites to carry out a successful structure-based virtual screening study, which produced four active compounds that block c-Myc function in the cell.\n\nThe above example supports the suggested in silico protocol of Bhattacharya and Lin [149] for designing small molecule drugs for IDPs:\n\nGenerate the conformational ensemble for the unbound target protein using enhanced-sampling MD.\n\nIdentify highly populated conformations in the ensemble and extract the representative ones by clustering.\n\nDetect possible ligand-binding pockets in all the representative conformations of the IDP.\n\nSelect the most druggable pockets using criteria such as hydrophobicity, plasticity, and allosteric coupling to functional sites.\n\nCarry out conventional virtual screening in each selected pocket and protein conformation exhibiting that pocket.\n\nSelect the virtual hits that show good predicted binding affinity in many IDP conformations.\n\nThis general protocol could also work well with other types of targets with flexible binding sites.\n\nOf note, MD generated IDP ensembles are frequently compared with experimental data and vice versa [173,174]. Naturally, since MD and the experimental techniques have their own limitations but produce complementary information, they can be used synergistically to characterize the conformational ensembles of IDPs [150,175,176,177,178]. For example, Shrestha et al. [170] recently reported how their enhanced simulation protocol was able to produce a structural ensemble of the disordered N terminal of c-Src kinase that agreed with the NMR and SAXS data, without reweighting or biasing the simulations.\n\nIn the next section, we will briefly look at a fast-growing branch of drug discovery that can also benefit from MD simulations: the design of monoclonal antibodies and antibody fragments.\n\n2.1.4. Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Antibody Design\n\nAntibodies have become an attractive class of biotherapeutics because of their low toxicity and innate ability to recognize and selectively bind to a wide variety of targets [179]. Experimental methods for the discovery of high-affinity antibodies, such as phage display, have proven to be extremely effective in antibody development, but also time-consuming and laborious [180]. Therefore, computational methods, such as MD simulations, have emerged to complement and expand the knowledge obtained from experimental antibody research.\n\nIn contrast to many other computational methods that ignore the structural plasticity of molecules, MD simulations can describe the dynamic details of molecular interactions. In antibody design, this can be utilized to identify the so-called “hot-spot” regions at the antibody-antigen interface [181]. As an example of this, Sinha et al. [181] in their work based on anti-lysozyme antibody structures could demonstrate that MD was able to reveal salt-bridges and other functionally important electrostatic forces even though these interactions were left undetected in the static crystal structure of the studied antigen-antibody complex. Naturally, the discovery of functionally important residues is the key to designing mutations in antibodies with improved affinities and selectivity to their targets.\n\nBecause MD simulations can reproduce molecular fluctuations at atomic resolution, they are also being employed to improve the scoring of antibody-antigen complex prediction methods. In this regard, MD simulations were used to refine the interactions in docked antigen-antibody complexes to obtain average values for the Generalized Born/Surface Area (GBSA) score that was used for re-ranking the docking results. The averaged GBSA scores derived from the simulations further improved the accuracy of predicting the antigen-antibody complexes [182]. Similarly, conformational ensembles generated with MD simulations can be used in rigid docking calculations, also called ensemble docking [183,184]. Even minor changes in protein conformation can affect docking results. Therefore, the advantage of this approach is that it incorporates backbone flexibility in the docking procedure and can be considered to mimick the conformational selection in antigen-antibody binding [183].\n\nMD simulations can also provide a solution for designing antibodies with enhanced stability [184]. In a recent study, Bekker et al. [185] applied MD simulations to predict the thermal stability of single-domain antibodies and comparing them with experimental data. This allowed them to pinpoint the key residues contributing to the instability and to successfully design a mutated antibody with improved thermal stability [185,186]. Additionally, a major issue encountered in antibody-based therapeutics is that antibodies are prone to aggregate in the high concentration formulations needed for treatment [187]. Spatial aggregation propensity (SAP) is a measure directed to solve this issue. SAP quantifies the hydrophobic patches exposed on the antibody surface, averaged over the snapshot structures obtained from MD simulations with explicit solvent. Identification of regions prone to aggregation can be used to predict targeted mutations to design antibodies with better stability.\n\nOverall, MD simulations can reveal details on antigen-antibody interactions that are not (easily) obtainable with any other methods. MD provides a useful tool to complement both experimental and other computational methods for designing novel antibodies with improved affinity, specificity, and stability.\n\n2.2. Simulating Drug-Target Interactions\n\nIn the drug development process, lead compound discovery and subsequent optimization of the identified compounds to candidate drugs follow the target validation (Figure 2). During this phase, the aim is to discover and design compounds that have a good binding affinity and selectivity to the target. Docking and scoring are common tools for fast estimation of favorable ligand binding poses and binding energies. However, the scoring functions of current docking tools have many limitations that result in inaccurate binding affinity predictions [49,188]. With MD, we can tackle these limitations and facilitate a more accurate evaluation of the compound binding affinity as the simulations take into account the effect of water and the dynamics of the binding partners [49]. In this section, we will go through some principal methods that utilize MD in the estimation of ligand binding energies and binding kinetics. In the end, we also discuss how the challenge of docking extremely flexible peptides has been tackled with hybrid approaches combining molecular docking and MD simulations.\n\n2.2.1. Binding Energy Estimation\n\nMolecular recognition is critical to many fundamental biological processes [189]. Binding between two interacting molecules in the cell initiates several biological processes, and the significance of these specific interactions can be judged through the free energy of binding (ΔGbind). In general, the change in free energy (∆G) describes the thermodynamics and the kinetic properties of a system (for our purpose, a ligand binding to a protein in a solvent). ∆G can be described as an amount of energy released or required during a chemical process. The final ∆G value at the state of equilibrium is negative if the chemical process (for our purpose, ligand binding to its target) is spontaneous, while ∆G is positive if the chemical process is non-spontaneous. Conventionally, ΔG is given by the change in Gibbs function:\n\nΔG = ΔH − TΔS,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ΔH represents the change in enthalpy of the system, T represents the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔS represents the change in the entropy of the system.\n\nMoreover, ∆G of a system can be used as an overall measure to determine the stability of a given system (for our purpose, the stability of a ligand-receptor complex, or ligand binding affinity) [190]. In case of a ligand-binding event, the standard binding free energy ΔG°bind is related to the binding constant Kb by the relationship:\n\nΔG°bind = −RTlnKb,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere R is the universal gas constant (unit: cal·K−1·mol−1), T is the temperature in Kelvin, and ΔG° has been measured at standard conditions: 1 atm pressure, room temperature (298.15 K), and 1 M protein and ligand concentrations. On the other hand, Kb is a ratio of the kinetic rate constants for association and dissociation (kon and koff, respectively) and the inverse of the dissociation constant, Kd.\n\nSince the free energy is a state function, binding affinity (or Kd) of a ligand can be obtained from the difference between the two thermodynamic equilibrium states, i.e., the unbound (initial) and the bound (final), without knowing the exact pathway connecting the two states [190]. Computationally, the estimation of ΔGbind requires extensive MD simulations to generate the unbound and the bound equilibrium states. These equilibrium states can also be defined as macrostates, while the macrostates can be further sub-divided into an ensemble of discrete microstates, comprising various intermediate stages of the ligand-receptor probing process (Figure 6).\n\nAssessment of ΔGbind for a series of ligands against a specific target protein can help identify the most promising compounds with higher binding affinities than the rest of the compounds. Therefore, drug design and docking-based virtual screening processes are often followed up by ΔGbind calculations [191] for which several computational methods have been developed. Such methods include rigorous thermodynamic pathway approaches to obtain relative (and recently also absolute) binding free energies of a series ligands [192], as well as less rigorous and computationally faster end-point methods that only sample the macrostates. The accuracy of these methods varies and is inversely correlated with the computational requirements. The most rigorous (alchemical i.e., non-physical) pathway approaches such as free energy perturbation (FEP) methods [192,193], Bennet’s Acceptance Ratio (BAR) [194], and thermodynamic integration (TI) [195] can usually be applied only to a few compounds due to the high computational cost. Somewhat faster approximations include methods that sample the possible physical microstates of the thermodynamic pathway, e.g., the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) [196] applied to predict the potential of mean force (PMF) using enhanced MD techniques such as steered molecular dynamics (SMD) [197,198,199] (Figure 7) and umbrella sampling [200], as well as the multistate BAR estimator (MBAR) [201] and Jarzynski’s non-equilibrium method [202]. For ligand-protein systems, the change in the PMF upon (un)binding is often assumed to be equivalent with the binding free energy profile along the chosen reaction coordinate [203]; there are, however, different theoretical approaches to obtain the free energy from the PMF [203,204,205]. Computationally less expensive end-point methods include the linear interaction energy (LIE) method [206] and the well-established Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) and Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) [207,208] approaches. In the next paragraphs, we focus on the application and limitations of the MM-PB(GB)SA methods that are commonly used for the evaluation of binding free energies of hit compounds from virtual screening experiments (post-docking analysis), e.g., to re-rank the docked poses of the top ligands [209].\n\nThe binding free energy estimation based on MM-PB(GB)SA method employs only the unbound and bound states (i.e., end-points) of the system. The binding free energy of a ligand to a protein is obtained as:\n\nΔGbind = Gcomplex − Gprotein − Gligand.\n\n(3)\n\nThe free energy (G) of each individual system (ligand/protein/complex) is calculated from the total molecular mechanics’ energy (EMM) of the system in the gas phase (includes internal bonded and non-bonded electrostatic and van der Waals energies), the solvation free energy (Gsolv) with both polar (computed using implicit solvation models, either Poisson-Boltzmann or generalized Born continuum solvent models), and non-polar contributions (assumed to be proportional to the solvent-accessible surface area, SASA), as well as the entropy (S; includes translational, rotational and vibrational contributions) at a specified temperature T:\n\nG = EMM + Gsolv − TS.\n\n(4)\n\nThe entropy is estimated from a normal-mode analysis of harmonic frequencies calculated at the molecular mechanics level, which is computationally costly (please, see e.g., [211] for a more detailed description of the theoretical aspects of the methodology).\n\nMM-PB(GB)SA calculations include two conventional approaches: (i) the three-trajectory scheme, and (ii) the single trajectory scheme [212,213,214,215]. The former relies on the snapshots from three MD trajectories, including apoprotein, free ligand, and the ligand-protein complex, which makes it comparatively accurate but computationally expensive [214,216]. Single trajectory strategy, however, includes only one MD simulation for the ligand-protein complex, reducing the computational time significantly [214,215,216,217]. The latter approach, however, neglects any explicit structural relaxation of the protein and ligand upon binding. Besides the strategy chosen, other factors also contribute towards MM-PB(GB)SA calculations, which include: (i) simulation time, (ii) choice of the force field, (iii) solvent model, (iv) solute dielectric constant, and (v) the net charge of the system. It has been reported that several short MD simulations run independently provide better ΔGbind predictions than a single long MD trajectory [213,214,218,219]. On the other hand, charged ligands can hinder the process of making accurate predictions [216,220,221]. Additionally, for obtaining absolute ΔGbind with the MM-PB(GB)SA calculations, the inclusion of conformational entropy (TΔS) remains a challenge. Incorporation of TΔS in the calculation does not guarantee a better accuracy in the final energies due to insufficient conformational sampling [212,213,218,220]. A sufficient number of MD snapshots may lead to a reliable estimate of absolute ΔGbind, however, it is computationally expensive [214,216]. Therefore, relative ΔGbind is generally sufficient to rank compounds against the target protein in structure-based drug design [214] and has a better prediction accuracy than the absolute ΔGbind calculations with this method.\n\nThe MM-PB(GB)SA approach has been applied in a number of studies, including the development of anticancer compounds [222,223,224], antibacterial [225,226,227], antiviral [228,229,230,231,232] and antiparasitic drugs [233,234,235], as well as antipsychotics [236,237]. These methods are also often applied to understand and analyze the binding mode and key interactions of small molecules [238,239] as well as peptide [240,241] and protein ligands [242] at their targets. Several comparative studies differentiating between the prediction accuracy of ΔGbind energies of protein-ligand complexes by MM-GBSA and MM-PBSA have been reported [243,244,245,246]. One such study indicated hot-spots in Ras–Raf and Ras–RalGDS protein-protein complexes involved in allosteric activation [244]. In another such study, the prediction of binding affinities of HIV-1 protease inhibitors helped rationalize drug resistance as a result of binding site mutations [245]. MM-PB(GB)SA calculations do not rely only on the parameters employed but also the receptor structures used [216,218,233,247,248]. Specifically, these approaches are believed to be dependent on the system. Hou et al. [214] reported accurate relative ΔGbind for 59 ligands against six different protein targets using the MM-GBSA approach when compared with the MM-PBSA method. Oehme et al. [220] reported that MM-GBSA has better accuracy than MM-PBSA for calculating ΔGbind energies of ligand–HIV protease systems. Hence, to date, no study concludes on which approach is better; instead, the literature suggests that the applied method should be selected on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIn conclusion, MD-based binding free energy calculations have a significant impact on the hit identification stage as they can improve the accuracy of the ranking of the hit compounds. As we learned from Equation (2), binding free energy is also related to binding kinetics, i.e., association and dissociation of a ligand to/from its target. We will now look at how MD is used in analyzing the drug binding and unbinding events to facilitate the design of compounds with favorable binding kinetics.\n\n2.2.2. Drug-Protein Binding Kinetics Estimation\n\nThere is increasing evidence of the importance of drug-protein binding kinetics to develop improved drugs [249,250,251,252]. The binding kinetics of drug-protein complexes is characterized by the association rate constant (kon; unit: M−1·s−1) and by the dissociation rate constant (koff; unit: s−1) [253]. It is also common to refer to the inverse of koff, the residence time (τ). Recent works have shown that residence times can often be better correlated with the in vivo efficacy of drugs than binding affinities [250,251,254,255]. Drugs with increased residence time interact longer with the target protein, displaying longer physiological effects. Drugs with increased on-rates may bind faster to the target protein than endogenous ligands, being effective competitors. Such drugs would also be less available in the free form, leading to less non-specific binding and fewer side effects. Therefore, modulation of kon and koff values may help in the design of effective and safe drugs.\n\nComputational methods are useful to reveal molecular details about drug-protein binding, providing information on how to modulate binding kinetics. However, obtaining binding and unbinding events from conventional MD simulations is challenging, because they are often infrequent events. One of the ways of sampling such infrequent events is combining MD simulations with enhanced sampling methods [253,255,256,257,258].\n\nThis section provides information on how enhanced sampling methods can be used to help in the design of drugs with modified kon or koff values. This is not a comprehensive list of all available enhanced sampling methods. The reader is referred to up-to-date information in the toolbox KBbox [259], which provides a compilation of tutorials and publications of computational methods to predict binding kinetics.\n\nMost computational work done so far is retrospective, aiming at reproducing data for binding kinetics available in the literature. One exception is a recent study that used elABMD, a method to predict relative residence times that combines adiabatic bias MD with an electrostatics-like collective variable [260]. A Spearman coefficient of 0.94 was achieved for a set of 6 glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibitors. Another exception is the study of koff values of inhibitors of the human flavoprotein D-amino acid oxidase using scaled MD [261]. The koff values of 5 compounds were determined by scaled MD and, afterward, experimentally. The correct ranking was obtained for 4 out of 5 compounds.\n\nMethods with low computational cost allow the estimation of relative kinetic rates for a set of drugs. One of these methods is smoothed potential or scaled MD [262], which aims at estimating relative residence times. Scaled MD enhances the sampling of unbinding events by smoothing the potential energy of the system. The method was used to predict relative residence times for 4 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein binders (correlation coefficient, R, of 0.85) [262], 4 adenosine A2A receptor binders (R of 0.95) [262], 7 glucokinase activators (R of 0.92 after removal of one outlier) [263], and 7 HSP90 inhibitors (coefficient of determination, R2, of 0.89 after removal of one outlier) [264]. Scaled MD was also used to understand why the residence time of the drug etoposide is longer for the human type II topoisomerase (TopoII) α, compared to TopoIIβ [265].\n\nτRAMD [266] is another method that aims at computing relative residence times for a set of drugs. τRAMD is based on random acceleration molecular dynamics (RAMD) [267,268], a method where an additional force of constant magnitude and random orientation is applied to the drug to facilitate dissociation. τRAMD was used to predict relative residence times for 70 HSP90 inhibitors (R2 of 0.86 after removal of outliers) [266]. Analysis of inhibitor-protein contacts in the trajectories using machine learning improved residence time estimates and detected that interactions between a halogen or a methyl group in the loop-binder compounds with Phe138 lead to a longer residence time [269]. τRAMD was also recently applied to estimate relative residence times of ligands dissociating from different mutants of T4 lysozyme [270].\n\nNonequilibrium targeted MD (TMD) [271,272,273] is another method that can be used to compute relative residence times for a set of drugs. In this method, an additional force is applied to the drug to facilitate dissociation, as in τRAMD, but in this case, the magnitude of the force is changed to obtain constant velocity of unbinding. The mean work calculated from TMD simulations was compared to koff values for a set of 26 HSP90 inhibitors [274], resulting in R2 from 0.45 to 0.80 for inhibitors grouped according to binding mode and scaffold. Moreover, the net charge of inhibitors was identified as a factor that could lead to longer residence times.\n\nBrownian dynamics (BD) simulations [275] are suitable for studying drug-protein binding. In this method, the drug and protein are treated as rigid bodies, with no internal motions, and the solvent is represented implicitly, leading to low computational cost. A combination of BD with MD simulations was used to study the binding pathways of two inhibitors to H1N1 neuraminidase [276]. The computed association rates were ranked correctly, and the formation of a salt bridge between the inhibitors’ carboxyl group and Arg368 was revealed as a key step for binding.\n\nMany enhanced sampling methods have moderate to high computational costs, preventing fast computation of residence times for a large set of drugs. However, such methods can reveal molecular details that may help in the design of drugs with modified binding kinetic rates. Methods that depend on the definition of one or more progress coordinates to describe the infrequent event and enhance the sampling, such as metadynamics [277] and weighted ensemble MD (WEMD) [278,279], have been used to reveal mechanistic details of drug-protein association and dissociation. Metadynamics was used to distinguish cyclin-dependent kinase 8 inhibitors with short or long residence times [280] and to study association or dissociation events for relevant pharmacological targets such as HIV reverse transcriptase [281], Src kinase [282,283], p38 MAP kinase [284], the M3 muscarinic receptor [285], the adenosine A2A receptor [285,286] and the β2-adrenergic receptor [287]. WEMD was used to study ligand dissociation from epoxide hydrolase [288] and from proteins used as model systems to study binding kinetics [289,290].\n\nSMD has also been used to uncover molecular mechanisms of ligand association and dissociation. SMD suits for analyzing fast and slow (un)binding events of various ligands (see for example refs [291,292,293]). While applying biasing force restraints on explicit-solvent models allows for faster approximate calculations in SMD simulations, this leads to a non-equilibrium trajectory and could change the underlying physical processes too drastically [294]. A recent work [295] used interaction-energy fingerprints obtained from SMD to predict koff values for 37 HIV protease inhibitors (R2 of 0.75), showing that interactions with residues Asp25, Ile47, and Ile50, located in the active site or in the flap region, are important to modulate koff values. SMD was also used in combination with RAMD to study dissociation from B-RAF kinase [296].\n\nAnother enhanced sampling method used for binding kinetics studies is REMD, although with a usually high computational cost. A modification of REMD which employed replica exchange in two dimensions was used to study the binding of an inhibitor to Src kinase [297]. Many binding and unbinding events were sampled. Transient encounter complexes, which are not visible in experimental data but may reveal information to help in the design of drugs with improved kinetic rates, were characterized.\n\nOther methods to obtain (un)binding events include Markov state models [298,299], adaptive sampling [300], fluctuation amplification of specific traits (FAST) approach [301], and the milestoning approach [302].\n\nIn summary, there are many examples of works showcasing how computational methods can be used to help in the design of drugs with improved binding kinetics (Figure 8). On one hand, methods with low computational cost, such as τRAMD and scaled MD, can be used to rank tens to hundreds of ligands by residence time. This information can help in the prospective selection of candidate drugs with short or long residence times. On the other hand, methods with high computational cost, such as WEMD, metadynamics, and REMD, can reveal information about transient states and ligand-protein interactions that can be modified to modulate kon or koff values. Therefore, computational methods can be applied to provide mechanistic insights in drug-protein association and dissociation events, helping in the design of drugs with improved kinetic rate constants.\n\nIn the next section, we will look at ways to tackle the flexibility of peptides in peptide-protein docking to get more accurate binding poses.\n\n2.2.3. Peptide-Protein Docking: Tackling the Flexibility Challenge with Molecular Dynamics Simulations\n\nPeptides represent a unique class of compounds that differ in their biochemical and therapeutic characteristics from small molecules, proteins, and antibodies [304]. Peptide-protein interactions are essential e.g., for cellular signaling, localization, immune system, and apoptotic pathways. Consequently, these molecules have been attracting attention from pharmaceutical and biological communities, with nearly 20 new peptide-based clinical trials annually [305]. In the computational field, much progress has been achieved in small-molecule docking, but these methods are often not suited for peptides given their size and flexibility [306]. The inherent flexibility of peptides poses a great obstacle toward determining the 3D structure of the complexes they form. In this section, we briefly review the use of MD simulations to tackle the peptide flexibility challenge, its applications, advantages, and fallbacks in the context of peptide-protein interactions.\n\nComputational methods that aim to study protein-peptide interactions can be classified into three categories: (1) template-based docking that uses known structures to build an initial model of the target complex; (2) local docking that performs a search around a user-defined region, and; (3) global docking that concomitantly searches for the binding site and a binding pose. Each approach has its own strategies to deal with the main challenges in protein-peptide docking, namely the modeling of conformational changes, in particular on the peptide side, the integration of experimental or theoretical data into the modeling process, and the selection of the best models out of the plethora of generated models (scoring). The application of flexible refinement in combination with molecular docking software to address the flexibility challenge has been investigated among others by using an enhanced sampling MD method with models obtained from ClusPro Peptidock [307], by combining the default pepATTRACT [308] method with an additional round of MD refinement, and by using MD to generate an ensemble of peptide conformations as input for HADDOCK [309]. A detailed description of several protein-peptide docking software is available elsewhere [310].\n\nThe use of MD simulations can provide an improved sampling of protein-peptide conformations; however, it has been observed that for large-scale predictions, heavy computational resources would be needed. A possible approach to circumvent this is to apply enhanced sampling MD methods such as SMD [311], Hamiltonian replica exchange [312], and Gaussian accelerated MD (GaMD) [313] to study protein-peptide binding. GaMD has been successfully used, in combination with the global peptide docking software ClusPro Peptidock, to refine docking poses and explore the binding mechanism of three systems. Initial models of the complexes were obtained by using the standard ClusPro Peptidock webserver protocol from the unbound forms of the peptides and proteins, excluding the PDB entries that contained the bound form of the target systems from the fragment search. For each system, the top-scoring protein-peptide complex was selected and refined using GaMD (described in detail in Supplementary Material of Wang, Alekseenko, Kozakov, and Miao [313]). The selected initial docking models had backbone RMSD of 3.3, 3.5, and 4.8 Å, for peptides 1, 2, and 3 respectively, with no significant conformational changes compared to the starting model observed for peptides 1 and 3. After GaMD refinement, the minimal backbone RMSD from the bound form observed throughout the MD simulations for peptides 1 and 2 was lower than 1 Å, whereas peptide 3 showed high fluctuations, temporarily sampling the near-native conformation (1 Å ≤ i-RMSD ≤ 2 Å). Cluster analysis of the conformations with the lowest free energies yielded backbone RMSDs of 0.94 Å, 0.61 Å, and 2.72 Å for peptides 1, 2, and 3, respectively, adequately capturing conformational changes and noticeably refining the initial docking poses. Despite these promising results, the number of systems tested remains very limited.\n\nHADDOCK, the High Ambiguity-Driven biomolecular DOCKing software has been optimized for protein-peptide docking, taking full advantage of its capacity to handle molecular ensembles and allow for flexible refinement. The protocol starts from three peptide conformations: extended, alpha-helical, and polyproline-II, which, together, cover about 80% of the observed protein-bound peptide conformations in the experimentally determined structures in the PDB [314]. The default HADDOCK protein-protein protocol consists of three stages: (1) From randomized ligand orientations around the protein receptor, rigid-body energy minimization is performed, (2) the top-ranking models are subsequently refined using semi-flexible simulated annealing [315] in torsion angle space, and finally, (3) the resulting docking models are refined with a short restrained MD in explicit solvent. In the case of protein-peptide docking, to allow for more flexibility and potential conformational changes, the length of the semi-flexible refinement is doubled, and the peptides are treated as fully flexible, which increases the conformational sampling. This protocol was tested on peptiDB [316], with 103 non-redundant peptide-protein complexes, including 47 unbound cases. Since HADDOCK is an information-driven method, the binding region was defined in a broad manner, consisting of a binding interface on the protein receptor which was ~3 times larger than the true interface. By doing this, the focus is on the challenge of identifying the correct binding conformation of the peptide. The protocol generated 79.4% high quality (interface-RMSD ≤ 1 Å) models for bound-unbound (i.e., experimental peptide-bound protein/unbound peptide) and 69.4% for unbound-unbound (unbound protein/unbound peptide) docking, the latter representing the most realistic scenario [317]. This ensemble docking approach that includes flexible MD refinement steps is shown to be a valuable strategy to tackle the flexibility challenge in protein-peptide docking. The HADDOCK developers have also provided guides on how to generate peptide ensembles using MD simulations instead of the three common conformation approaches and how these can be used in HADDOCK, both through its webserver and a local installation [304,309].\n\nThe flexible peptide-protein docking protocol pepATTRACT combines fast coarse-grained ab initio docking with an atomistic refinement of the most favorable docked models. Combination of the ATTRACT docking protocol with an MD refinement using AMBER 14 [318] led to a 50% increase in the top-10 success rate when compared to a no-refinement scenario [308]. An ensemble of 80 peptide-protein complexes from the peptiDB benchmark was selected for testing. This ensemble includes experimental data and has been used in other docking protocols [317]. The same strategy as previously published for HADDOCK was followed by, using the three main peptide conformations for the docking with some knowledge of the binding site. For each complex, the 1000 best initial rigid-body docking solutions, ranked by the ATTRACT score, were selected for flexible interface refinement [319] and subsequent MD with AMBER 14 using a generalized Born implicit solvent model. The final complexes were clustered by the fraction of common contacts [320] and ranked by the top-four members of each cluster [317] as done in HADDOCK. Interestingly, the authors also considered a “worst-case” scenario in which no knowledge of the binding site is assumed, and a global docking is performed. This is often the case faced by most researchers. After clustering, 97% of the successful cases (56 out of the 80 complexes considered) had at least one cluster with an average top-four interface-RMSD ≤ 2 Å. The AMBER MD refinement step was shown to yield an average improvement of 0.44 Å of the interface-RMSD. There was a striking increase in comparison to the use of only the default interface refinement, which only improved the model’s interface-RMSD by 0.10 Å.\n\nIn conclusion, several peptide-protein docking software are continuously being developed and optimized further. While addressing the innate flexibility of peptide-protein complexes remains challenging, researchers are taking advantage of MD simulations for enhanced sampling and refinement. This combination of docking and MD can greatly improve the prediction of peptide-protein complexes and is a powerful asset in the field of peptide therapeutics and drug design.\n\nIn our biological context, the cellular environment is of course more complex than just water, ions, and proteins. In the next section, we specifically look at target proteins that are associated with biological membranes. We will discuss how MD is utilized to study their structure, function, and ligand binding properties as well as what the benefits are if we can include the membrane structure explicitly in the simulations.\n\n2.3. Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Membrane Proteins\n\nMost current drug targets are membrane-associated, either integral or peripheral proteins [321,322]. Integral membrane proteins are either polytopic proteins (spanning through the membrane several times) or bitopic proteins (single-pass proteins, spanning through the membrane only once), whereas peripheral proteins are associated with only one side of the membrane. Unfortunately, the structure determination of membrane proteins has been particularly challenging [321]. This has hampered reliable computational studies of several important drug targets. However, recent advances in crystallography and especially in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have resulted in a significant increase of atomistic resolution structures of large membrane-bound macromolecules, thus providing valuable information on these targets for computer-aided drug design.\n\nMD simulations of membrane proteins have often been carried out without the membrane as it is computationally more costly to include a membrane model in the simulation system, especially if the lipid bilayer is represented in atomic detail [323]. However, biological membranes can play significant roles in modulating drug action (e.g., by affecting the substrate selection or receptor function), not only at polytopic integral membrane protein targets but also at bitopic and peripheral membrane protein targets [324]. There are also drugs whose mode of action is to directly target (disrupt) biological membranes [325], and thus, the inclusion of membranes in MD simulations may be crucial for gaining realistic insights. In this section, we focus on MD simulations of particularly important drug targets that are polytopic integral membrane proteins, i.e., G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels. We also look at what MD simulations can tell about the function of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes that are bitopic membrane proteins playing a significant role in drug metabolism.\n\n2.3.1. Molecular Dynamics Simulations of GPCRs and Ion Channels\n\nWith membrane proteins representing around 25% of the total proteome and their experimentally proven importance in various pathophysiological processes, they are highly regarded as targets in small molecule drug discovery. Indeed, approximately one-third of all currently marketed small molecule drugs target membrane proteins to alter downstream cellular signaling pathways. Rhodopsin-like GPCRs, nuclear receptors, ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels are ranked as the top four of all druggable targets by FDA-approved drugs [326,327].\n\nThe most targeted class of transmembrane (TM) proteins are the GPCRs. These consist of seven transmembrane-spanning α-helical domains with a characteristic dynamic network connecting the ligand-binding site to the cytosolic Gα signaling subunit. Despite the significant functional importance of GPCRs, spectroscopic techniques remain challenging for these membrane proteins because of their distinct hydrophobic surfaces, high flexibility, and relatively low expression. However, recent advances in the structural biology of GPCRs, with X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have resulted in novel overall structural insights and understanding of the structural basis for the induced receptor response upon ligand binding and unbinding [328,329,330]. Because of the highly dynamic nature of GPCRs with multiple, functionally distinct conformational states [331,332], combined spectroscopic and computational studies allow for a detailed atomic analysis of the TM domain dynamics mediating downstream signals [333]. The most recent example is the in-depth characterized structure of GPR52 coupled to its downstream heterotrimeric Gs protein in a previously unknown self-activation state [334]. Additionally, a potential allosteric ligand-bound state was suggested as a potential drug target for Huntington’s disease.\n\nInterestingly, class A GPCRs contain a ‘placeholder’ formed by the N-terminus and the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) [335,336,337]. While adopting an open conformation in the absence of the ligand, the extracellular loop plays a critical role in lipophilic ligand recognition, access, and selectivity for the orthosteric site [338,339]. In the same class, a consensus amino acid network was described through a comprehensive analysis of X-ray structures by Venkatakrishnan et al. [340]. While the GPCR family allows binding ligands of diverse chemical properties, most ligand-contacting residues are preserved in the TM helices TM3, TM6, and TM7 that form a scaffold for the ligand-binding pocket. This observation explains drug cross-reactivity and allows drug repurposing with tailored ligand specificity based on topologically equivalent positions in the TM helices from structural homologs [341,342,343]. In contrast, class B GPCRs are frequently targeted by highly flexible peptide ligands at a solvent-accessible orthosteric binding pocket [344]. While consensus scaffolds generally guide GPCR ligand recognition, different ligands induce various conformational states of the receptor with a specific downstream signal [345,346].\n\nThese observed characteristic dynamics have spurred the use and advanced development of atomic level MD simulation approaches to supplement the increasing amount of static structural information from spectroscopic techniques. The increase in computational resources has enabled the analysis of conformational dynamics up to the microseconds range [347,348]. To date, because of the high structural homology between various TM protein classes even with distant homologs [349], the rational design of novel therapeutic candidates has been facilitated by comparative modeling combined with docking approaches and machine learning algorithms [350,351,352,353]. While currently repurposed ligands generally target primary orthosteric sites [343,354], long unbiased MD simulations have also facilitated the identification of allosteric regions of membrane proteins that may potentiate or inhibit downstream signal transduction [355,356].\n\nEarly simulations of membrane proteins were performed without membrane embedding, but today accurate membrane modeling has allowed for the simulation of realistic cellular membrane environments [357,358]. In vitro data on membrane thickness, curvature, fluidity [359], and surface tension [360] has enabled accurate modeling of ligand binding and the corresponding downstream activation of the signaling proteins [361,362]. Furthermore, multiscale MD simulations combining atomistic and coarse-grained MD can also give structural and functional insights into important protein–lipid interactions, protein oligomerization, clustering, and crowding [363]. For example, cholesterol-GPCR interactions and cholesterol’s general influence on membranes can modulate GPCR structure and dimerization, thus affecting e.g., receptor-crosstalk and drug efficacy [364].\n\nMultiple dedicated web servers have been developed to facilitate the highly complex set-up of membrane protein simulations. For example, CG dynamics can benefit from the user-friendly CHARM-GUI [365], the VMD Membrane plugin [366], and the recently developed MERMAID (employing the Martini forcefield) [367]. Alternatively, parameterized phospholipids for coarse-grained simulation of membrane-protein dynamics are available in the SIRAH2.0 forcefield [368] recently implemented in the GROMACS and AMBER simulation packages. Besides these, LipidWrapper and BUMPy allow for geometric transformations towards different curved shapes of lipid bilayers [369,370]. The development of PACKMOL-Memgen for building membrane protein–lipid bilayer systems has enabled accurate atomistic MD simulations with complex lipid mixtures at desired ratios, allowing asymmetric leaflet compositions [371]. While parameters for phosphoinositides and lysophospholipids have recently been added to the AmberTools19 PACKMOL-Memgen release, the range of lipids in the new Lipid17 force field, which is the update of the AMBER Lipid14 forcefield [35], can be further extended. Moreover, various enhanced sampling and biasing simulation methods such as REMD [372], metadynamics [373], milestoning [374], and umbrella sampling [359,375] have been explored successfully for membrane-associated simulations. Another useful resource is the MemProtMD database, which, as of now, contains 3500 resolved membrane protein structures that have been inserted into simulated lipid bilayers using coarse-grained self-assembly MD simulations [376].\n\nBesides gaining general insights into ligand binding modes [377] or quantifying ligand binding energies [378] at membrane-embedded TM receptors, ligand migration from the membrane bilayer to the central GPCR channel has been recently successfully simulated [379]. For example, it has become evident that membrane partitioning characteristics of drug molecules such as quantitative bilayer distribution, permeation depth, and their overall conformational features in the lipid bilayer are crucial for understanding their target GPCR binding kinetics [380,381]. Simulations of membrane permeability of small molecular compounds are useful for predicting drug absorption through cellular membranes, although challenging [382]. Recently, the physics-based PerMM tool and database were developed to facilitate the analysis of passive membrane permeability coefficients and translocation pathways of bioactive molecules [383]. The availability of such advanced computational tools may offer an alternative to the common in vitro membrane diffusion models that include Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA), phospholipid vesicle-based permeation assay (PVPA), Permeapad®, and the artificial membrane insert system (AMI-system) [384]. From the available data in reported studies, it can be inferred that membrane-embedding significantly affects TM receptor structure and dynamics, ligand diffusion and binding as well as downstream signaling.\n\nMD simulations of ion channels have been used, for example, to explore the mechanism of ion permeation by external stimulants or to investigate the structural and functional effects of disease-causing mutations in the context of genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis [385,386]. Such studies can give important insights to aid in the drug discovery process. For example, the key conformational changes in the channel pore could be targeted with small molecular compounds [385]. For ion channels (or any other target proteins) that lack a known experimental structure, MD can help select and validate the best homology models for further structural investigations [387,388]. In addition to evaluating the stability of ligand-binding at ion channels (e.g., [387,389]), simulations of agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists in the ligand-binding sites of the ion channel may give an understanding of the structural details crucial for the channel opening (activation) or closing (inhibition). For example, Feng et al. found that an agonist had larger conformational effects on the channel pore profile of human TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1) than an antagonist [387]. On the other hand, simulations of an ionotropic glutamate receptor GluR2 (iGluR2) suggest that since partial agonists show more flexibility at the binding pocket, they cannot open the channel pore as efficiently as full agonists [390]. Interestingly, water exchange within the iGluR2 binding pocket was shown to be more pronounced when a partial agonist was bound than when a full agonist was present. Simulations of the serotonin 3A receptor (5-HT3AR) with granisetron showed how the binding of this antagonist causes conformational changes in the receptor, thus leading to constricting the channel pore [391]. Similar to Feng et al.’s TRPV1 simulations with agonists and antagonists [387], MD simulation of the cryo-EM structure of rabbit TRPV5 with econazole showed different flexibilities of the inhibitor in the four binding sites of the homotetrameric channel structure [392]. The varying dynamic behavior of the inhibitor in each monomer was shown to be correlated with the direct lipid contacts of econazole at the binding site. The simulation data also suggests how econazole affects the pore profile to inhibit Ca2+ flow through the channel. Wang et al., in their study on allosteric regulation of P2X receptors (ATP-gated cation channels), used metadynamics to determine favorable binding modes of an allosteric regulator AF-353 at human P2X3 receptor (hP2X3) [393]. Moreover, after a short MD refinement of the crystal structure of hP2X3 complexed with another allosteric modulator AF-219, they were able to observe new, stable ligand-receptor hydrogen bonds that were not seen in the original crystal complex.\n\nAs in the case of GPCRs, the phospholipid bilayer plays an important role in ligand-ion channel interactions. MD simulations can give insight into the access pathways of ligands to their site of action; e.g., MD was used to elucidate how capsaicin accesses its intracellular TRPV1 binding site by first flipping from the extracellular to the intracellular leaflet of the bilayer [394]. Moreover, MD simulations can efficiently facilitate the identification of structurally and functionally important lipid interaction sites on ion channels and other integral membrane proteins [395]. For example, the crucial role of cholesterol on the structural integrity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) was demonstrated by MD simulations; in the absence of cholesterol the receptor structure collapses, while the cholesterol molecules present both in the surface sites and buried pockets maintain the original receptor conformation and support the contacts between the pore and the agonist-binding domain [396]. Likewise, MD simulations of the GABA type A receptor (GABAAR) with cholesterol suggest that cholesterol may promote pore opening by binding in the intersubunit sites of the receptor in a wedge-like manner [397]. Insight into such sites may aid in the design of (lipid-like) drug molecules that can modulate the function of therapeutic integral membrane proteins such as ion channels and GPCRs.\n\nWe will now look at the key enzymes responsible for drug metabolism and how their membrane interactions significantly affect their ligand-binding and functional properties.\n\n2.3.2. Drug Metabolizing Cytochrome P450 Enzymes\n\nCytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) play an important role in drug metabolism, steroid biosynthesis, and xenobiotic degradation. Human CYPs are bitopic integral membrane proteins with a single TM α-helix that is connected to the globular catalytic domain via a linker region varying in length from 25 to 28 residues. The knowledge of orientation and interactions of CYPs in the membrane and therefore mechanism of substrate entrance and exit after metabolism is scarce due to experimental limitations. The most X-ray structures of CYPs have been resolved after truncating the TM helix residues, or even by mutating residues in the globular domain region that interacts with the membrane. Therefore, significant information on protein-membrane interactions and function has been lost. To date, full-length structures of only fungal (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata) lanosterol 14-alpha demethylases (CYP51) have been reported [398,399,400]. However, there are a number of experiments performed (employing e.g., epitope analysis, mutagenesis, tryptophan fluorescence scanning, and atomic force microscopy) to find the important globular domain and membrane interactions and distance of the globular domain above the membrane [401,402,403,404]. The TM-helix orientation can be measured experimentally using solid-state NMR spectroscopy [405,406]. Furthermore, the orientation of CYPs’ globular domain has been determined by measuring the heme-tilt angle by rotational diffusion and nanodisc experiments [407].\n\nAs these experiments have been performed for only certain CYPs and there is a very low sequence identity between different CYP subfamilies, there is little understanding of how sequence differences between CYP isoforms will influence the membrane orientation, interactions of the globular domain with the membrane, and subsequent selection of substrates for metabolism by individual CYPs. As most of the substrates are hydrophobic in nature, it is assumed that the ligand tunnel opening in the membrane would be the favorable route of entry into the catalytic site of CYPs [408,409]. To understand such fine differences, computational modeling, and simulations at various time and length scales have played a significant role in understanding the mechanistic behavior and dynamics of CYPs in their native environment.\n\nComputational methods such as the Orientation of Protein in Membranes (OPM) database (http://opm.phar.umich.edu/) [410] and the Protein Data Bank of Transmembrane Proteins (http://pdbtm.enzim.hu/) [411] can be used to predict the position, insertion, and orientation of membrane proteins in the biological membranes. Some research groups have taken the OPM predicted orientation of the globular domain above the membrane as the starting point and further optimized it using all-atom molecular dynamics (AAMD) simulations in the physiological conditions [412,413]. However, large domain motions or orientational changes of the globular domain are unattainable by AAMD and require coarse-grained (CG) simulations. The CG simulations help us explore large conformational spaces by decreasing the number of degrees of freedom and allowing the extension of simulations beyond the microsecond scale. Different approaches utilizing multiscale simulations, CGMD, and AAMD have been used to study the orientations of several CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and human CYP51) in a lipid bilayer [414,415,416]\n\nWe have optimized a multiscale simulation protocol to study CYP–membrane interactions [417]. For this, CYP3A4 was used as the test case for the insertion and orientation of a CYP enzyme in a POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) bilayer. We then extended the same approach to other major drug-metabolizing CYPs such as CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A1, CYP1A2, as well as to the human steroidogenic enzymes CYP17 and CYP19 that are [417,418,419]. From the results of our simulations, we have been able to identify differences in the orientations or the distance of the globular domain with respect to the membrane, and important residues at the membrane–protein interface that result in such differences.\n\nThrough our optimized multiscale simulation protocol, we identified that the two highly similar CYPs: CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 that share 94% sequence identity, can have not only distinct substrate specificities but also different membrane protein orientations and interactions [419]. Such differences were due to the primary sequence variation in the linker, beta-strand1, the B-C loop, helices F, F’-G’, G regions and their turns. These regions are the flexible substrate recognition sites (SRS1, 2, and 3), located at the entrance to the active site [420]. Furthermore, using our multiscale simulation approach, we identified the effect of mutations in the TM-helix of CYP17 on the interactions and orientation [418]. The original TM-helix sequence was modified to increase the expression of CYP17 in E. coli. The difference in the heme-tilt angles in wildtype and mutant (mt) TM-helix corresponded to the experimental heme-tilt angle measured by Ivan Lenov for mtCYP17 (64 ± 4°) [421], Ohta et al. [404] (47° to 63°), and simulation results by Cui et al. [422]. Furthermore, mutations in the TM-helix of CYP 17A1, especially W2A and E3L, led to a gradual drifting of the TM-helix out of the hydrophobic core of the membrane. This instability of the TM-helix could affect the interactions with the allosteric redox partner, cytochrome b5, required for CYP 17A1’s lyase activity. Truncation of the TM-helix residues in CYP17 has been shown to decrease its catalytic activity 2.4-fold, which could be due to the loss of hydrophobic interactions between CYP17 and its redox partner [423]. Such hydrophobic interactions between TM helices of CYP2B4 and cytochrome b5 have been reported by dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) NMR spectroscopy under magic angle spinning (MAS) [424]. Therefore, the unstable TM-helix lying parallel to the membrane plane in mtCYP17 could result in the loss of inter-TM helix interactions between mtCYP17 and its redox partner, leading to decreased catalytic activity, or affect membrane anchoring and thereby lead to reduced activity.\n\nBesides understanding the CYP–membrane interactions and orientations, it remains unexplained how the CYPs select different substrates and what route substrates take for entry into the catalytic site, and how the corresponding soluble products exit the site. The study of ligand entrance and exit is beyond the scope of classical MD due to the limited time and length scale one can reach in such simulations. Therefore, enhanced sampling techniques such as RAMD [268,425] and SMD [408,426,427,428] are used. In RAMD simulations, an artificial force with random direction is applied to the center of mass of the ligand while in SMD, a force is applied to the ligand in a specified direction (Figure 7).\n\nDifferent ligand access/exit tunnels have been observed opening in soluble vs membrane-bound CYPs [425,429]. In mammalian CYPs, the 2a tunnel that opens into the membrane can be used by hydrophobic substrates, whereas tunnel 2c that opens in the solvent may be preferred by hydrophilic products to egress [430]. RAMD simulations of CYP2C9 in complex with flurbiprofen and warfarin and their products by Cojocaru et al. [425] suggest that depending on the physicochemical properties of the ligands, different tunnels were preferred. RAMD simulation of CYP51 by Yu et al. showed, on the other hand, that tunnel 2f is the predominant ligand egress tunnel that leads to the membrane [431].\n\nTo conclude, computational prediction, modeling, and simulation have enabled us to a great extent to understand the structure, dynamics, and function of CYPs in general and in particular mammalian CYPs in their native membrane-like environment. However, there is still a need for improving computational algorithms, developing compatible force fields, and facilitating the inclusion of complex membrane systems in MD simulations to help understand fully complex biological questions relating to drug metabolism by CYP enzymes. In the future, elucidating the intricacies of the membrane and ligand interactions of CYPs may, for example, aid in predicting the metabolism of novel drug candidates or understanding the adverse effects of drugs"
