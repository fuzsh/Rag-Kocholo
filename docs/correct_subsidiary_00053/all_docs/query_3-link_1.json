The detectors are always as close as possible to the patient, which really improves spatial resolution and sensitivity…The most improved performance is the energy resolution. This is very impressive and it can help us to do dual isotope acquisition very easily.³\n\nGilles Le Rouzic\n\nMedical physicist, Hospital of Orleans, France (2+ years working with StarGuide)"
