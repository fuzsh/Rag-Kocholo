        "text": "Confocal Microscopy\n\nAndor - Andor Technology offers a range of confocal and live cell imaging systems through their Microscopy Systems Division. The company also offers a unique suite of live cell imaging software (Andor iQ) that can easily handle multi-channel, time-series, Z-series and multi-field data. In addition to product information, the Andor site includes in its library a section on confocal imaging that provides an excellent concise introduction to basic confocal concepts and equipment.\n\nBD Carv - A product of BD Biosciences, the BD Carv is now available in its second major form, known as the BD Carv II. The confocal imager utilizes a Nipkow spinning disk and allows users to quickly switch from confocal to wide-field viewing or recording. The system, which is designed to be utilized in conjunction with an existing microscope, provides automation of internal multi-position excitation and is equipped with dichroic and emission filter wheels that permit fast multi-dimensional imaging of up to five or more fluorescent probes in a single sample.\n\nCarl Zeiss - The LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope offered by Zeiss can collect data in up to four channels simultaneously utilizing a quad-photomultiplier 12-bit A/D detection system. The microscopes employ krypton-argon, argon, and helium-neon lasers and a Windows-based host computer running the NT operating system. The advertised scanning speed is 2.6 frames per second at 512 x 512 pixels. The Zeiss confocal website offers technical and application information, as well as a gallery of digital images acquired with these microscopes.\n\nConfocal Imaging - Developed by the Laboratory for Optical and Computational Instrumentation at the University of Wisconsin, this website provides an introduction to confocal imaging and a variety of related topics.\n\nConfocal Microscopy - Sponsored by the Experimental Pathology Core at the University of Arizona Center for Toxicology, this website offers links to general and historical aspects of confocal microscopy. Additional avenues to sources of information on confocal principles, theory, and optics are also provided.\n\nFrom Bones to Atoms: Imaging Nature Across Dimensions - Written by scientists from the M.E. Müller Institute for Microscopy at the University of Basel (Switzerland), this website offers introductory information about optical sectioning using confocal microscopy techniques. Also presented in a nicely-executed format is information about video-enhanced light microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, electron microscopy, electron diffraction, and digital imaging.\n\nIllumina: Confocal Microscopy - Molecular Dynamics, a subsidiary of GE Healthcare (formerly Amersham Bioscience), is a manufacturer of confocal microscope systems, image analysis software, volume rendering and three-dimensional modeling tools. The confocal microscopy hardware and software were licensed to Illumina in February 2002.\n\nLeica Microsystems Confocal Microscopy - Leica's confocal microscopy website provides introductory material about confocal microscopy, tutorials and manuals about Leica microscopes, FAQ's, application notes, a publications listing, and an image gallery. In addition, the website contains press releases and new events about Leica products and provides links to Leica customer websites.\n\nNikon Confocal Microscopy - Nikon's PCM 2000 biosciences confocal microscope employs twin photomultiplier tubes with options for single or triple configurations. The microscopes utilize up to three lasers, including air-cooled argon and 543 or 635 nanometer helium-neon. Software consists of the Windows NT operating system operating on a mid-level Pentium computer with Matrox digitizing and processing software. Image analysis is conducted with C-Imaging high-performance quantitative measuring software capable of recording a 1024 x 1024 frame in two seconds.\n\nOlympus America - The Olympus FluoView is a point-scanning, point-detection, confocal laser scanning microscope for biology research applications. Excellent resolution, efficiency of excitation, intuitive user interface and affordability are key characteristics of the Olympus FluoView. The system is available with the IX70 inverted research microscope and the AX70, BX50, BX60 and BX50WI upright research microscopes.\n\nOptiscan - The Optiscan Personal Confocal microscope offers a twin detection system utilizing both argon-ion and krypton-argon lasers for simultaneous fluorescence imaging. The microscope is controlled by the Optiscan Confocal Control software and images can be analyzed with Optiscan Analyze, a Windows-based program.\n\nPerkinElmer UltraVIEW - Perkin Elmer is a company that specializes in optoelectronics and the life and analytical sciences. The UltraVIEW is the company's multi-point confocal laser microscope system, which is available in two major models dubbed the LCI and RS. Both models come equipped with a confocal scanner, laser illumination sources, wavelength control, a CCD detector, image acquisition software, a computer, and monitors. Analysis software can be added as an option.\n\nYokogawa - Yokogawa, which is a broad-based technology company, includes confocal laser microscope scanners among the many products it designs. The Yokogawa CSU10 scanner unit debuted in 1996 and quickly became popular in biotechnological and medical research laboratories. The CSU22 followed, further expanding the means available of observing live cells in real time."
