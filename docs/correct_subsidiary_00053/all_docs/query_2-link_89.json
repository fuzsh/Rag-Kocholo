        "meta_description": "Phase-change memory materials are semiconductors with a fast and re-\nversible transition between a resistive amorphous phase and a conductive\ncrystalline phase. A sufficiently large contrast in electrical resistivity can\nbe used to read and write bits of information, as encoded in the struc-\nture of the material. Modeling the structure of these materials is therefore\ncrucial for the design and optimization of devices that exploit these proper-\nties. The relevant atomic interactions required to run computer simulations\nand to obtain structural models are governed by the laws of quantum me-\nchanics. These interactions can be calculated from first-principles using\napproaches such as density-functional theory. However, the estimation of\nmacroscopic properties of materials requires extensive simulations that are\nnot yet tractable for these methods. This is all the more important for\ndisordered phases, such as liquids or glasses, where these properties have\nbroad statistical distributions that require significant sampling of configu-\nration space. Second-principles methods such as force-fields derived from\nquantum mechanical data, can offer a powerful method for extending the\nscope of atomistic simulations and can improve, through better scaling,\nthe estimates of macroscopic properties, without losing the accuracy of the\nquantum-mechanical potential-energy surface. This thesis presents the de-\nvelopment, validation and applications of a machine-learned interatomic\npotential, trained on data obtained from density-functional theory calcu-\nlations of Ge−Sb−Te materials, which are widely used in phase-change\nmemory and data-storage electronic devices.",
