        "text": "As a leading member of Wisconsin's BioForward, Inc., we are honored that the Wisconsin Biohealth Tech Hub is one of 12 Tech Hubs across America to receive a federal grant from the U.S. Economic Development Association. This significant achievement will enable the Wisconsin Biohealth Tech Hub to invest in the state, further advancing critical work to unlock the potential of personalized medicine for patients and providers globally. GE HealthCare has been a part of the Wisconsin community for more than 50 years, and we look forward to innovating alongside our BioForward Wisconsin consortium partners to strengthen our biohealth industry and deliver the future of healthcare. Learn more about this work: https://lnkd.in/eGsbKuPt. #Innovation #Biotech Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation\n\nI recently had the pleasure of joining Elie Chaillot and Masaki Wakabayashi in Japan to connect with our GE HealthCare colleagues and customers and see firsthand the longstanding legacy of manufacturing innovations at our Hino site. For more than 40 years, GE HealthCare has addressed the country’s most pressing health challenges, while remaining focused on our long-term commitments to deliver greater value to patients and people in need. Hino is a global center of excellence that leads our Lean culture to drive improvements in our delivery of quality care globally. Something I’ll take with me from this trip and implement with my team is the deeper knowledge of Lean thanks to two experts, Katahira Sensei, a legendary Lean master, and Masahiro Kawahata-san, our Hino Lean leader. Both shared valuable insights on how to solve complex problems with speed and agility. I was inspired by our next generation of leaders who are helping drive our business, culture, and future innovations forward. Listening and learning from some of Japan’s leading medical experts and our customers, I feel an even greater sense of urgency to accelerate innovation to address their unique challenges and desire to improve outcomes. It’s encouraging to hear that we’re making an impact and delivering on their local needs, and I’m looking forward to continuing our work together to solve their challenges. #leanmindset #healthcare #medtech\n\nWe are making significant progress across all key areas of GE HealthCare's sustainability strategy and have strengthened our commitment to transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement of our sustainability initiatives, while establishing clear goals. I am particularly proud of our greenhouse gas reduction goals, recently validated by the Science Based Targets initiative; the launch of the GE HealthCare Foundation, aimed at advancing equitable access to care; and our long-standing Gold Seal program to advance circularity efforts. Sustainability is not just a part of our business − it’s integral to how we operate as a company and central to our purpose of creating a world where healthcare has no limits. #Sustainability #FutureofHealthCare #GEHealthCare\n\nThis week, I sat down with, listened to, and learned from award-winning journalist and best-selling author, Michelle Miller, who joined Abigail Epane-Osuala, and GE HealthCare colleagues locally in Waukesha and virtually around the globe, for our inaugural Colleague Resource Group event to enhance our culture of belonging and winning together. Michelle talked about what it took for her to find herself, and her personal experience with belonging. She is a resilient, curious and passionate leader who is authentic and true to herself. I respect her courage and candor in sharing the monumental moments that helped her discover a state of belonging. At GE HealthCare, we aspire to create a culture of belonging – one where everyone feels safe and encouraged to show up as their true selves. When we feel safe, and seen, we’re comfortable bringing our unique and diverse perspectives to work, fostering a culture of trust, and resulting in innovation. Thank you, Michelle, for sharing your story. And thank you to Abby, and the entire DEI team at GE HealthCare, for bringing us together for continuous learning. #growthmindset #culture #InOurHands\n\nToday, I’m eager to share the news that we named Roland Rott the new President & CEO of our Imaging business, taking over for Jan Makela who announced his departure in April, and Philip Rackliffe as the President & CEO of our Ultrasound and Image Guided Therapies (IGT) business. These two great leaders have deep industry knowledge, a global mindset, experience working at public companies and are well-positioned to lead our two largest businesses. We also announced that we are aligning our IGT and Ultrasound businesses to better match the current clinical usage of these technologies and realize stronger business and customer impact by providing the right image guidance in the right care setting. Our customers value and have become increasingly reliant on the combination of these technologies to serve patients as minimally invasive and surgical procedures are rapidly growing due to an increase in cardiovascular disease, an aging population, advancements in imaging, and other factors. Please join me in congratulating Roland and Phil in their new roles. Please read our press release for more information: https://lnkd.in/eSeHsHZ4. GE HealthCare\n\nThis week I had the privilege to engage with the AdvaMed Board and meet with elected officials, CMS and members of the Administration to discuss how the Medtech industry is shaping a future where advanced technologies are transforming healthcare and improving patient care. It is important that we continue to have open dialogue about how we can work together to build trust in AI, ensure patient access to new technology and support a favorable environment around investing in R&D. As the AdvaMed Board Chair, I recently wrote about why this is crucial to delivering the future of healthcare: https://lnkd.in/e6pXwdw5. GE HealthCare #medtech #healthcare"
