The devices in this list have met the FDA’s applicable premarket requirements, including a focused review of the devices’ overall safety and effectiveness, which includes an evaluation of appropriate study diversity based on the device’s intended use and technological characteristics.\n\nContents of this list: This list contains publicly available information on AI/ML-enabled devices. The FDA compiled this list from the FDA’s publicly-facing information, including public-facing summaries and AI/ML specific product codes, as well as information in the publicly available resources cited below (*) and in other publicly available materials published by the specific manufacturers.\n\nThis list is not meant to be an exhaustive or comprehensive resource of medical devices that incorporate AI/ML. Rather, it is a list of medical devices that incorporate AI/ML across medical disciplines, primarily based on information provided in the summary descriptions of their marketing authorization document.\n\nUpdates to this list: The FDA plans to update this list on a periodic basis based on publicly available information. Send questions or feedback on this list to digitalhealth@fda.hhs.gov.\n\nAI/ML-Enabled Medical Devices\n\nThis list contains publicly available information on AI/ML-enabled devices.\n\nDevices are listed in reverse chronological order by Date of Final Decision. To change the sort order, click the arrows in the column headings.\n\nUse the Submission Number link to display the approval, authorization, or clearance information for the device in the appropriate FDA database. The database page will include a link to the FDA's publicly available information.\n\nDownload a CSV File Download an Excel File Save as XML File*\n\n*To save the XML file, right click and save the file to your computer and open in the appropriate program.\n\n*Non-FDA publicly available resources:\n\nMedical AI Evaluation Database (from “How medical AI devices are evaluated: limitations and recommendations from an analysis of FDA approvals,” Wu, E., et al, Nature Medicine, 27, 582-584 (2021))\n\nA.I.-based algorithms (The Medical Futurist)\n\nAI Tools database (STAT) (Excel-22KB)\n\nSupplementary Appendix to “Approval of artificial intelligence and machine learning-based medical devices in the USA and Europe (2015-20),” Muehlematter UJ, et al., Lancet Digital Health 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(20)30292-2.
