        "text": "August 30, 2017 — ARTMS Products Inc. signed a strategic partnership with GE Healthcare around ARTMS’ proprietary QUANTM99 Irradiation System (QIS) for radioisotope production. The goal of the partnership is to supply equipment, technologies and research that supports the production and processing of radioisotopes on GE’s PETtrace 800 platform of medical cyclotrons. The QIS integrates on to the GE PETtrace 800 series cyclotron to enable an alternative, non-reactor supply of valuable medical isotopes including technetium-99m, copper-64, gallium-68 and zirconium-89.\n\nThe strategic partnership includes an agreement for ARTMS to supply and install Europe’s first QUANTM system and research into expanding the number of available isotopes produced on GE’s PETtrace 800 series medical cyclotrons. ARTMS will work with GE to optimize the production and processing of isotopes such as copper-64 and gallium-68.\n\nEvery year Tc-99m is used in over 80 percent of all nuclear medicine imaging procedures in areas such as cardiology, oncology and neurology. Recently, Tc-99m produced with the QUANTM system was used to complete a Canadian multi-centre registration trial in bone imaging and thyroid function.\n\nIn the future, it is the intent of ARTMS and GE to continue to offer the QUANTM system to new and existing PETtrace cyclotron customers on a global basis.\n\nThe QUANTM technology includes all the required products and procedures for the production of Tc-99m using GE’s PETtrace cyclotrons and enables the production of other valuable isotopes through the bombardment of a high-energy proton beam against specific chemical ‘targets’.\n\nThe ARTMS process provides a cost-effective alternative to reactor-based technology. The technology produces no long-lived radioactive waste and advances efforts to eliminate the use of weapons-grade highly enriched uranium (HEU) in radioisotope production around the world.\n\nFor more information: www.gehealthcare.com, www.artmsproducts.com"
