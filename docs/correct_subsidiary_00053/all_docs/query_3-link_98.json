        "text": "IDEAs in Action General Education Curriculum\n\nThe IDEAs in Action general education curriculum empowers students to design their own educational journey, while providing them with a foundation that prepares them for the intellectual growth associated with a Carolina education and in their future roles as leaders, creative problem-solvers, lifelong learners, and engaged citizens. Additional information can be found on the IDEAs in Action website.\n\nThe IDEAs in Action General Education curriculum applies to all first-year students and transfer students who matriculate as degree-seeking undergraduate students in fall 2022 or later.\n\nStudents who matriculated to the University prior to fall 2022 should follow the Making Connections General Education curriculum. Information and approved courses can be found in archived editions of the Catalog.\n\nThe IDEAs Approach:\n\nIdentify pressing questions, problems, and issues\n\nDiscover ideas, evidence, and methods that inform these questions\n\nEvaluate these ideas, evidence, and methods\n\nAct on the basis of these evaluations\n\nFirst-Year Foundations\n\nStart strong! This is a set of special courses and experiences in the first year designed to help students navigate their transition to the college environment, get them ready to take ownership of their education, and make the most of the opportunities at Carolina.\n\nStudents must complete the First-Year Foundation requirements during the first academic year on campus (two semesters), with the exception of Global Language. Students are strongly encouraged to begin Global Language during their first year.\n\nCourse List Code Title Hours IDST 101 College Thriving H, 11 13 14 ENGL 105 English Composition and Rhetoric3 or ENGL 105I English Composition and Rhetoric (Interdisciplinary) 2varies Total Hours11\n\nTransfer students who completed at least 24 hours of post-high school transfer credit are required to complete ENGL 105 (or ENGL 105I) and Global Language, but not the other First-Year Foundation requirements.

More information for transfer students, early college Students, and transfer credit from a North Carolina community college can be found in this catalog.\n\nAdditional First-Year Foundation Policies\n\nCourses used to satisfy First-Year Foundation requirements may not be declared Pass/Low Pass/Fail. This includes level 1, level 2, and level 3 language courses being used to fulfill the Global Language (through level 3) requirement. Note that IDST 101 is only offered as Pass/Low Pass/Fail.\n\nStudents may take and receive credit for only one course in each of the following requirement categories: 1) College Thriving (IDST 101), 2) First-Year Seminar or First-Year Launch, 3) Triple-I + Data Literacy, 4) ENGL 105 or ENGL 105I.\n\nAll First-Year Foundation requirements must be satisfied by taking courses at UNC–Chapel Hill, with three exceptions:\n\nUNC faculty-led First-Year Seminars awarding UNC graded credit in study abroad programs may be used to satisfy the First-Year Seminar requirement.\n\nENGL 105 may be satisfied with transfer credit, but not with by-examination (BE) credit.\n\nGlobal Language may be satisfied with college transfer credit, UNC language placement test credit (PL), by-examination (BE) credit, or from prior educational experience. Additional information can be found in this catalog and on the Language Placement website.\n\nStudents must maintain continuous enrollment in Global Language courses until they have completed the requirement. See \"Continuous Course Enrollment\" section in this catalog.\n\nStudents are not permitted to drop ENGL 100, ENGL 105, ENGL 105I, or Global Language levels 1 through 3 being used to fulfill the Gen Ed requirement after the second week of the semester, unless approved by a dean in the Academic Advising Program. See \"Continuous Course Enrollment\" section in this catalog.\n\nStudents are not permitted to drop only Triple-I and not the data literacy lab (or vice versa).

Students take one course for each of the nine Focus Capacity courses (3 credits each) plus a one-credit Empirical Investigation Lab. Focus Capacity courses introduce and reinforce a broad set of capacities for identifying, discovering, evaluating, and taking action upon ideas, knowledge, evidence, and argument.\n\nCourse List Code Title Hours 1, 2, 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 Total Hours28\n\nDisciplinary Distribution\n\nAll students must take at least one general education course (Focus Capacity, FY-Seminar/FY-Launch, High-Impact Experience, Research and Discovery, or Communication Beyond Carolina) in each of the three major divisions of the College of Arts and Sciences:\n\nHumanities and fine arts\n\nMathematics and natural sciences\n\nSocial and behavioral sciences\n\nAdditional Focus Capacity Policies\n\nCourses used to satisfy Focus Capacity requirements may not be declared Pass/Low Pass/Fail.\n\nA Focus Capacity course may overlap with one or more of the following Gen Ed requirements: FY-Seminar/FY-Launch, Research and Discovery, High-Impact Experience, Communication Beyond Carolina.\n\nA Focus Capacity course may not double count with a Supplemental General Education course.\n\nThe degree programs in Clinical Laboratory Science, Dental Hygiene, Nursing, and Radiologic Science require at least six of the nine Focus Capacities (plus lab). If a student pursues a different second major, then all nine Focus Capacities (plus Lab) are required.\n\nReflection and Integration\n\nPut your learning into action! As students move through the curriculum, IDEAs in Action calls for them to put their capacities into practice through concrete experiences. These opportunities help students reflect upon, deepen, and connect knowledge and capacities.\n\nCourse List Code Title Hours 11-3 11-3 23 31\n\nAdditional Policies\n\nCourses used to satisfy Reflection and Integration requirements may not be declared Pass/Low Pass/Fail.
