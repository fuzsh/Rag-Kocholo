        "text": "We have investigated the initial stage of oxidation of Si (001) surface by water (H 2 O) molecules using reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at 300 K and 1200 K without any external constraint on the water molecules. Previously, reported water reaction behaviors on silicon surface by ab initio calculations or experimental observations were reproduced by the present MD simulation. The present simulation further revealed that the hydrogen atom in H 2 O is more attractive than oxygen atom in O 2 to bond with Si, such that it accelerates the dissociation process of H 2 O. It was also observed that the oxidation reaction was enhanced with increased number of the supplied water molecules. It was suggested that the repulsion between water molecules and their fragments facilitates the dissociation of both water molecules and hydroxyl decomposition on the Si surface. Therefore, the wet oxidation behavior appeared to have more temperature dependence even in the early stage of oxidation. V C 2013 AIP Publishing LLC. [http://dx.\n\nAb initio calculations have been carried out to investigate the pathways of H-atom migration and H2 desorption on a mixed SiGe(100)-2×1 surface using the cluster model. The H2 recombinative desorption is the rate-determining step in hydrogen migration and desorption on SiGe(100) surfaces, since the energy barrier to H-atom migration is generally lower than that of H2 desorption. The energy barriers for H2 desorption from the interdimer, the Si–Ge pair, (52.8 kcal/mol), and the Ge–Ge pair, (45.1 kcal/mol), are lower than that for the Si–Si pair by 7.5 and 15.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, the SiGe(100)-2×1 surface in chemical vapor deposition provides more dangling bonds than the Si(100)-2×1 surface because of Ge inclusion. In contrast, the chemisorbed H tends to stay on the Si-site, since the barrier for H-migration from the Ge-site to the Si-site is lower that in the opposite direction by 5.6 kcal/mol. Hence, a considerably higher percentage of Ge sites are dangling bonds, compare..."
