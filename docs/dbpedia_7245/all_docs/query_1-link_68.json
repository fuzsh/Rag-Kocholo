        "text": "The irony of the location to the occasion was not lost on Amanda Gardier. During her return performance for the Origins Jazz Series on Thursday evening, the Baltimore-by-way-of-Indianapolis saxophonist devoted the bulk of her quartet’s 85-minute set to subtle yet highly animated compositions inspired by the films – and, quite often, the characters inhabiting them – of Wes Anderson. So unleashing the resulting music live at the Kentucky Theatre? Well, that was a stroke of divine madness. I can think of at least three Anderson movies – Moonrise Kingdom, The Grand Budapest Hotel and Asteroid City – that I was introduced to there over the last 15 years. So why not make the venue a showcase for jazz shadings of those works?\n\nIn doing so, Gardier designed compositions from her recent Auteur: Music Inspired by the Films of Wes Anderson album as kinds of impressionistic echoes of images and inhabitants from those movies. Among such instances: the cyclical themes representing the embattled brethren from 2007’s The Darjeeling Limited that mingled and eventually coalesced under the finale drumming of Paul Wells in “Order for Yourself” or the arpeggiated guitar chimes of Charlie Ballantine (the saxophonist’s husband) that formed the near-reggae groove simmering under Gardier’s alto sax lead in The Cycling Reporter (inspired by Anderson’s 2021 film anthology The French Dispatch).\n\nGranted, it sometimes took Gardier’s between-song explanations to fully detail the extent to which her compositions drew from the films. But in the performance’s finest moments, none of that mattered. The show-opening “The Blue of Winter” was an effective soundscape all by itself. Though inspired by The Grand Budapest Hotel, the work introduced a sense of soft-focus reserve that Garnier regularly drew from during the concert. As was the case with her initial Origins concert from October 2019, Gardier was not a showboater. Her soloing, which dominated the piece, possessed a tone of neatly reserved luster and overall patience in terms of tone and temperament. It created an almost Bergman-esque seasonal glow that was easy to sense, even to those who have never visited Budapest.\n\nNot everything in the performance owed to Anderson’s askew imagery and character studies. Gardier used light, spacious unaccompanied statements on alto sax to open and close a lovely reading of the 1944 Julie Styne/Sammy Cahn standard “I Fall in Love Too Easily.” Later, to close the concert, she reached back to her 2018 debut album Empathy for “Fjord,” a tune fortified by a sleek groove that playfully bounced somewhere between bop and bossa nova.\n\nStill there was no question that Anderson’s films were the collective muses that sat securely in the driver’s seat. That was especially true of the stuttering grooves that formed a sort of swirling pit under Gardier’s restless alto lead during “Electroshock Therapy” (inspired by Moonrise Kingdom). They both tensed up into single-note upper cuts by the full ensemble before relaxing, albeit briefly, into a sunnier repose.\n\n“There are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughterhouse that was once known as humanity,” ruminated Ralph Fiennes as the concierge Monsieur Gustave H. in The Grand Budapest Hotel. Luckily for us, Gardier forged every glimmer she could summon from these inspirations into exquisite musings of her own.\n\nJohn Mayall, tireless ambassador of British blues and mentor to a generation of roots music stylists, died on July 22 at the age of 90. A touring artist until early 2022 with a legacy that saw the release of nearly 100 albums over seven decades, Mayall’s last regional concert was an August 2019 date at the Grand Theatre in Frankfort. Prior to that performance, I had the opportunity to speak with him about his remarkable career.\n\nAll you need to understand the musical legacy forged by John Mayall is a fresh listen to three of his earliest albums, all of which were cut over a half-century ago.\n\nIn the fall of 1967, the long-revered “Father of British Blues” issued a recording titled “Crusade” featuring a teenaged Mick Taylor on the guitar. Less than two years later, Taylor would defect to the Rolling Stones and remain a member through what many consider the band’s most creative recording era.\n\nEarlier that year, Mayall released “A Hard Road,” which introduced guitarist Peter Green to the world. Before 1967 was done, Green, Mayall drummer Mick Fleetwood and, eventually, band bassist John McVie would form the core of a new group called Fleetwood Mac.\n\nBack up to 1966 and you have the album that forever changed the blues world, “Blues Breakers.” Handling principle guitar duties was a young Eric Clapton. Just after the record’s release, Clapton left Mayall to rock civilization with the power trio Cream.\n\nThose are the familiar, yet still-ridiculously impressive first chapters in a career that has never looked back. Today, at age 85, Mayall continues to perform over 100 concerts a year while maintaining a remarkably prolific recording run that has seen the release of over 70 albums (excluding numerous anthologies). Through it all, his brand of the blues has been revolutionary, from the choice of instrumentation (highlighted by Mayall’s distinctive drummer-less bands of the late ‘60s and early ‘70s) to a sensibility that has attracted world class instrumentalists, especially in the guitar category.\n\nSo what does the artist whose initial albums launched the careers of three of England’s most celebrated guitar heroes look for when forming a band?\n\n“I just enjoy people’s originality, regardless of what instrument they’re playing,” said Mayall, who makes a rare regional appearance this week for a sold-out performance at the Grand Theatre in Frankfort. “That’s always something I’m looking for. I’m thrilled to play with different people that I admire. The main thing musicians should aim for, especially the new musicians on the scene, is something of your own, something original, rather than maybe copying somebody else.”\n\nCuriously, Mayall took a fresh approach to that philosophy on his newest album, “Nobody Told Me.” Rather than seek out an underdog guitarist to join his long-running trio featuring bassist Greg Rzab and drummer Jay Davenport, Mayall sought more familiar names. But instead of enlisting specific players, he sent out a casting call-like invitation to artists that might be interested in working with him.\n\nAccepting the offer – and, subsequently, appearing on “Nobody Told Me” – was a varied company of all-star players, several of which were not readily associated with blues music. They included pop/prog maestro Todd Rundgren, E Street lieutenant Steve Van Zandt and Rush mainstay Alex Lifeson. Augmenting the crew were contemporary blues stylists Joe Bonamassa, Larry McCray and the Texas guitarist currently touring with the Mayall trio, Carolyn Wonderland.\n\n“That was the theme,” Mayall said. “So I put the word out that I wanted to try different guitar players as guests. That they aren’t all known as blues players was one of the nice things about not actually sending out for specific people. Those are the ones who came through, so I was delighted. I was very interested to see what they were doing.”\n\nThe casting call approach is the latest chapter for an artist who capitalized on an early ’60s blues scene in England that history has regularly overlooked in favor of a well-documented British fascination with American R&B.\n\n“There was a change in what people were listening to at the time,” Mayall recalled. “Prior to the blues invasion, if you want to call it that, the roost had been ruled by trad jazz bands led by people like Chris Barber and Humphrey Lyttelton. It was time for a change. (Blues artists/bandleaders) Alexis Corner and Cyril Davies put the whole thing together and gave people a taste of what electric blues was all about. It happened very quickly at a time when people were ready for something new.”\n\n“The music has always been at a good place for me since then because we have the total freedom to play what we want. People have always accepted that with me, too, which is a very good indication of the awareness to what we’re doing. The records, they are all personal expressions about what I was thinking about at a particular time. They serve as documentation of my life.”\n\nAfter four-plus decades of living almost every degree of intensity and mischievousness rock ‘n’ roll could offer – from the reckless heyday of The Replacements to the stadium-sized pageantry of Guns N’ Roses – Tommy Stinson is more interested in exploring life and music at his own pace and by his own rules\n\n“I’ve been so lucky, dude. I’ve been able to do so many things. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen things most people don’t get a chance to see a quarter of, if they’re lucky. And I appreciate that. I’ve gotten to a place in my life where I just feel pretty grateful. I’m sitting here going, ‘Wow. I can still go out and play shows and pay my bills and do it on my own terms and have fun.\n\n“There are all the trappings of adulthood in there, too, but for the most part, I still get to seek and discover new music, whether it comes from me or others. It’s a cool lifestyle that way. It’s just gratifying.”\n\nWhat brings Stinson to Lexington this week is something altogether more intimate than the groundbreaking, punk-abandon he forged with The Replacements during the 1980s and early ‘90s or the anthemic arena rock he later commanded during a 16-year run as bass guitarist for Guns N’ Roses that concluded in 2014. He will be playing a solo acoustic performance at The Green Lantern as part of the Harry Dean Stanton Fest, the annual weekend salute to the film career of the late West Irvine-born, Lexington-educated actor.\n\n“What I got from Harry was that he was just really a cool, one-of-us kind of dude,” Stinson said. “There was no star thing about him. He would just start talking about stuff and asking stuff. Strangely enough, it wasn’t any different for me than talking to Bob Dylan or David Bowie. I’ve talked to both of them and they just go ‘What’s going on out there, man? How’re doing?’ They were very engaging and great gentlemen.\n\n“You got that from Harry, as well. He just wanted to know how things were going for you. He had an interest in that stuff. He was a cool guy.”\n\nStanton would cross paths with Stanton after moving to Los Angeles from his native Minneapolis in 1993. There, Stanton held court with makeshift jam and music outings at various clubs including the Pico Boulevard haunt known as Jack’s Sugar Shack.\n\n“A friend of a friend owned that place. Harry Dean would have a band he would play with on Wednesday nights. It just became like Harry Dean Stanton Night or whatever. He played a lot of harmonica and sang. It was kind of a boozy throwdown, if you will. It got very festive quick, but it was always fun and well revered for the longest time while he was in town and able to do such things. I ran into him a few times down there and had a few drinks.”\n\nWhile Stinson was never part of Stanton’s film career, a high-profile collaboration from several years earlier helped earn him an invite to this weekend’s festival. The date was Jan. 16, 1986. The Replacements were touring behind one of their most celebrated albums, the brawling but stylistically broad-minded “Tim,” which had been released the previous September. The band’s mounting popularity earned a guest spot on Saturday Night Live, which, on that evening, Stanton hosted.\n\nThen things went off the tracks as both Stanton and the band had a passion for, shall we say, distilled spirits.\n\n“Well, we got in trouble for him getting drunk,” Stinson said. “That was the problem with that show. We didn’t know that he wasn’t supposed to be drinking. We weren’t supposed to have booze in the dressing room, but we did. And Harry Dean found his way to our dressing room where the booze was. We ended up getting taken in for that. Unbeknownst to us, they tried to make it look like we swore, that Paul (Westerberg, the Replacements’ chief songwriter and vocalist) swore in the tunes we played (“Bastards of Young” and “Kiss Me on the Bus”). But it really came down more to the fact we snuck booze in and got Harry drunk.\n\n“But again, we didn’t know. We didn’t know the deal with him. We never would have done that if we had known. But we did it and hence, The Replacements getting into all kinds of trouble because of our booze. It happens.”\n\nThe Replacements grew out of a rough and restless Minneapolis upbringing that placed Stinson onstage at an early age. He was 14 when the band’s debut album, “Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash” was released in August 1981.\n\n“It was not for the faint of heart, at that,” Stinson said. “I had to grow up quick. A young kid thrown into the adult world, and that adult world was even more haphazard than the adult world my family was going through, my mom and siblings. On the one hand, I sort of grew up too quick and on the other, maybe I didn’t enough grow up quick enough.\n\n“All the tales of woe of the Replacements days really come from the fact we were all pretty broken kids. We had relatively standard upbringings in some ways compared to the national average, I guess. But family dysfunction ran through every one of us. Some of us more so than others, and that stuff comes out in the music. You can hear it. You can feel it in every aspect.\n\n“Mind you, Minneapolis had, and still does to this day, probably the most vibrant music scene I’ve witnessed, and I’ve been everywhere. You had all these punk rock, modern pop and hardcore scenes, all these different musical scenes converging, all at the same time Prince was lighting everything up. There was a real camaraderie, but also a kind of a war, if you will, of everyone challenging each other to a dual in their songs. It was a cool thing. There was a lot of camaraderie, but also a lot of little battles.”\n\nToday, life is considerably quieter. Stinson tours in a folk-Americana rooted unit called Cowboys in the Campfire, but also devotes considerable time to solo concerts. He will perform on his own at The Green Lantern for the Stanton fest, although the bill also includes the longstanding punk-infused Texas band Mydolls (which performed in one of Stanton’s most celebrated movies, the 1984 Wim Wenders-directed “Paris, Texas”). Does this mean one of the country’s prime punk veterans might mix it up with some of his electric contemporaries?\n\n“You never know. It depends on how I feel about stuff. I’ve got to call the Mydolls up. It could be that I roust them to do a couple of songs just for fun. I’m uniquely in a position in life now where I just do it as I want to in a whatever-floats-my-boat kind-of-way. That sounds kind of selfish, I know, but I’m lucky like that.”\n\nTommy Stinson with Mydolls performs at 8 p.m July 13 at The Green Lantern, 497 W. Third. The performance is part of the Harry Dean Stanton Fest. Tickets: $18 in advance, $25 at the door at harrydeanstantonfest.org.\n\nKinky Friedman was as wild and original as any songsmith to rocket out of Texas in the early 1970s. An outlaw before the genre term was ever coined, he was also a novelist, columnist and, in 2006, Lone Star gubernatorial candidate. Mostly, Friedman was a character. He left us Wednesday at the age of 79. For those unfamiliar with what a colorful soul Friedman was, here is an interview piece I wrote ahead of his November 2015 appearance in Lexington for the WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour.\n\n“Start talking.”\n\nThat’s how Kinky Friedman answers the telephone as we begin our interview. You discover quickly, though, that the veteran Texas songsmith, author, one-time gubernatorial candidate and all-around raconteur isn’t being rude or abrupt. He’s just anxious for a conversation — any conversation — to begin.\n\nFor the moment, talking is a good pastime. Friedman is on the road — specifically, “Pennsylvania somewhere on the way to Ohio.” It’s Sunday morning as well as his 71st birthday. So what better way to pass a few minutes and miles than talking music, politics and writing, and then wrapping it all up with a Texas-size dose of wry humor.\n\n“It’s just the curse of being multi-talented, that’s all,” Friedman says. “I’ve written about 34 books. Then, of course, the politics takes up all kinds of time and sucks most of the energy out of your life and turns you into a bad person if you stay with it too long. I mean, it’s the only field where the more experience you have, the worse you get.”\n\nFor the singer who introduced numerous off-center musical philosophies in 1973 with his debut album Sold American, life in the Americas today is a quizzical, troubled journey. Yet he still finds audiences outside of Lone Star country taken with his vintage songs as well as music from his newest album, The Loneliest Man I Ever Met.\n\n“I think Raymond Chandler, the mystery writer, said, ‘Scarcely anything in literature is worth a damn except what is written between the lines,’” Friedman says. “So what we have here is really a record stripped down to the soul to where you can bring your own imagination into the songs, which you can’t really do with all this overproduced crap today where everything sounds like Beyonce or Taylor Swift.”\n\nWhile Loneliest Man boasts a few Friedman originals, the bulk of its leanly arranged repertoire is devoted to what he calls “interpretive renderings” of songs by Bob Dylan, Warren Zevon, Tom Waits and other fellow renegades.\n\n“We put some tracks down at our ranch in Texas, tracks that sounded so damn good that we said, ‘Why the hell do we have to make this like something coming out of Nashville, some overproduced background music for a frat party? Let’s just pick songs we love and keep it sparse, just like Willie (Nelson)’s Red Headed Stranger. That seems to have worked.”\n\nA Chicago native, Friedman was part of a wave of country-inspired songwriters headquartered in Austin during the early ’70s. The satirical elements of his music were often severe (his long running band was called The Texas Jewboys), but Friedman’s inspiration was vast. He landed a recording contract with the help of Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen in 1973 and became part of Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue two years later.\n\n“It’s a heady experience being around great, original talent,” Friedman says. “Nashville now is like a corporate publishing house. You’ve got a songwriter meeting with three guys working on a song that should sound a little like this guy and a little like that guy and since it’s going to be for Toby Keith, it has to sound a little bit like Toby’s last record. I’ve never met Toby. I’ve got nothing against the guy. But this just shows you how the business part took over.\n\n“Look, I’m 71, but I read at the 73-year-old level. Young people today … their bands may be good, bad or indifferent, but what you’re hearing coming out of the radio is not something that’s going to inspire anybody. I’ll tell you, just going to see a concert by Levon Helm used to inspire me, or by Merle (Haggard) or Bob or Willie or Billy Joe Shaver. They all inspired me. There are just a handful of people doing their thing and that group is diminishing all the time. I mean, these guys will make you think with a song that may stay with you for a lifetime.”\n\nFriedman’s career has regularly veered outside of music. He mounted an independent campaign for Texas governor in 2006, finishing fourth in a six-candidate race won by Rick Perry. But he has been especially visible since the 1980s as a writer of crime novels (curiously, most of them were set in New York). He has subsequently written a column for Texas Monthly and several non-fiction works.\n\n“A question was posed to me by a child once,” Friedman says. “He knew I was a songwriter and he knew I wrote books. He asked when I’m typing the books if I was hearing music in my head. I guess the answer is yes. For songwriting or writing a novel, I think the best bet is you’ve got to find a way to be miserable. If you’re a happy, well-adjusted person, you can pretty well forget it.\n\n“My definition of an artist is someone who is ahead of his time and behind on his rent.”\n\nOne-third of the way through a rock show Thursday evening full of heart, intelligence and a wonderfully scrappy sense of soul, Mike Campbell led the audience at the Lexington Opera House through a sing-a-long that emphasized the title to a tune from Wreckless Abandon, his 2020 debut album with The Dirty Knobs. Being a family blog, we will sidestep the title as it contains an expletive. Okay, okay – it boasted a F-bomb, which Campbell happily let rip. But the tune, the title and this sly bit of audience engagement were so honestly good natured that the guitarist couldn’t help but offer a semi-apology after all the joviality settled.\n\n“If there are youngsters here, I’m sorry,” he said. “But you’re going to hear all this sooner or later, so you might as well hear it from The Dirty Knobs.”\n\nSuch an episode encapsulated the essence of this hearty two-and-a-quarter hour feast of very sincere rock ‘n’ roll, the kind Campbell comes by naturally, having served as first lieutenant (meaning lead guitarist and frequent co-songwriter) for the entire history of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. That translated into a fervent devotion to 1960s rock and pop that was tight and efficient in its rhythmic attack (thank longtime Heartbreakers-turned-Dirty Knob drummer Steve Ferrone for that) but loose and raggedly soulful in every other regard, from the expert songwriting to the band’s resourceful combo design.\n\nYou were reminded at the program’s onset of what a key role Campbell played in the sound forged by Petty, who died in 2017. The performance opened with “Rockin’ Around (With You”), the first tune from the first Heartbreakers album – specifically, the band’s self-titled 1976 debut record. With Campbell, co-guitarist Chris Holt and bassist Lance Morrison providing a solid front line that traded the chant-like vocals from the song’s chorus, the band asserted its leader’s heritage. But then it went deeper, tacking a cover of Cream’s “I’m So Glad” and a brief, mischievous jam onto the song to reveal the source material that informed not only Petty’s best work, but the music Campbell later uncorked from the three albums released thus far by The Dirty Knobs.\n\nWhat you sensed throughout the concert was that Campbell loves a good hook. Sure, he’s a masterful instrumentalist and improviser, as a lengthy solo that oozed out of “In This Lifetime” (from his band’s 2022 sophomore album External Combustion) showcased with slow, deliberate but still very lyrical soulfulness. But what was more arresting during the performance, especially the eight tunes pulled from the third and newest Dirty Knobs album, Vagabonds, Virgins and Misfits, were huge, beefy guitar hooks, the kind that supported the band’s melodic appeal and electric fervor. Such hooks detonated “Dare to Dream” with its strong ‘70s radio rock accessibility, gave “So Alive” a steamrolling charge that would not have sounded out of step on a Led Zeppelin record and made “Shake These Blues” peel back the years to the golden age of The Yardbirds.\n\nThis was hardly a new practice for Campbell. When he encored the Thursday show with the 1995 Petty hit “You Wreck Me,” the same formula was in place – a glorious pop exercise that marched to the meaty tune of Campbell’s massive guitar hooks.\n\nCampbell and The Dirty Knobs also enlisted a little help at times. Show opener Shannon McNally took over duet duties that Lucinda Williams originated on the studio version of the Vagabonds tune “Hell or High Water” while a cameo by Hollye Bynum of the indie Brooklyn trio Razor Braids bolstered an update of the overlooked Petty/Campbell relic “Ways to be Wicked” that nicely mirrored the gale force gusto Maria McKee summoned when Lone Justice cut the song in 1985.\n\nCuriously, Campbell closed this scholarly rock seminar by largely stepping outside of the Petty shadow. With only Holt remaining as an onstage foil, he offered a hopeful but weary postcard depicting life on the road titled “Stories We Could Tell.” While Campbell performed the song with Petty on the Heartbreakers’ 1985 live album “Pack Up the Plantation,” it was penned over a decade earlier by John Sebastian. At the Opera House, the work served as both a nightcap to a performance that honored a rock ‘n’ spirit in all its raw splendor and an affirmation of a life in service to that muse.\n\nMcNally’s opening solo acoustic set was a delight as well. A New Yorker-turned-Nashvillian, she possessed a rich, expressive voice that regularly stretched to yodel-friendly heights. While her own tunes (“Hello,” “Ceremony”) possessed a stark musicality akin to Harvest-era Neil Young, McNally’s brief 30-minute set also respectfully honored other elders. She opened with the early ‘70s Waylon Jennings-by-way-of Steve Young gem “Lonesome, On’ry and Mean” that possessed the same cautionary glow of her own compositions.\n\nMcNally was also astute enough to honor the Wednesday passing of Texas renegade Kinky Friedman, although she did so by way of a tender take on Billy Joe Shaver’s “Because You Asked Me To.” The song was a gentle alternative to the often-coarse nature of Friedman’s own music.\n\n“Kinky’s songs were kind of like Dr. Seuss,” McNally told the crowd. “But Dr. Seuss Triple X.”\n\nIn the video for his newest single, “Dare to Dream,” Mike Campbell sings confidently about a life of promise. His location: the historic Church Studio in Tulsa, a locale roughly half-way between his longtime home of Los Angeles and the Northern Florida haunts of his youth that gave rise to a remarkable rock ‘n’ roll career. The video balances a studio performance by Campbell and his side project-turned-full time band The Dirty Knobs and home movie footage from decades earlier of the guitarist at play on his own and with the band he is most readily associated with: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nIt’s an unassuming but affirmative tune, one in step with much of the positive leaning music on Campbell’s just-released third album with The Dirty Knobs, Vagabonds, Virgins & Misfits. But the hopeful stance of “Dare to Dream” holds considerable weight. It’s a celebration of the days ahead from an artist who, at age 74, has lived a truly charmed artistic existence.\n\n“The song goes, ‘These are the best of times, this is the good life,’” Campbell said by phone last week. “That’s kind of how I feel. Maybe it’s cheeky to write a song like that with all the crap going on in the world right now with politics and war. I thought, ‘You know, I’m just going to put out a positive statement about how I feel.’ I think most people can relate to that, to staying positive and thinking that things are going to be okay. That’s the message I’m trying to send.”\n\nA nearly half-century alliance with Petty ended in 2017 with the rock titan’s sudden passing. Campbell was lead guitarist for the Heartbreakers’ entire history. He was also co-writer with Petty on some of the band’s biggest hits, including “Refugee,” “A Woman in Love (It’s Not Me),” “You Got Lucky,” “Runnin’ Down a Dream,” “Into the Great Wide Open” and “You Wreck Me.” That alone would qualify Campbell for legendary status, a title made real when he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 as a member of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. But Campbell has also amassed a ridiculous dossier of other collaborations through the decades that have included recordings with Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Roy Orbison, Stevie Nicks, John Prine, Joe Cocker, Linda Ronstadt, Don Henley and Neil Diamond.\n\n“Everyone you work with becomes an influence and an inspiration for you,” Campbell said. “I pay attention and try to learn from them. They all leave a lasting impression on your musicality, so I have that experience to draw from as I go ahead. I treasure that.”\n\nThat experience runs both ways. Along with The Dirty Knobs, Campbell has bonded with a legion of newer generation artists. Several are showcased on a newly released Petty tribute album boasting a team of young country music stars aptly titled Petty Country. One of the record’s highlights has Campbell playing with Margo Price on “Ways to Be Wicked,” a ‘70s-era tune he penned with Petty. The song wasn’t a Heartbreakers tune, but rather a stellar part of the 1985 debut album by the short-lived country-rock upstart troupe Lone Justice.\n\nBut perhaps Campbell’s most high-profile country comrade has been Kentucky celeb Chris Stapleton. Aside from contributing to “Petty Country,” Stapleton adds to the crunchy charge of “Don’t Wait Up” on the Vagabonds album with further honky tonk fervor provided by Heartbreakers keyboardist Benmont Tench.\n\nThe Stapleton connection isn’t new. In 2000, both artists contributed to each other’s records. Campbell co-wrote two tunes with Stapleton for the latter’s Starting Over album, adding guitar work to both. Stapleton co-penned another pair of songs and sang on a third for Campbell’s first Dirty Knobs record, Wreckless Abandon. Both albums were released with a week of each other that November.\n\n“Chris Stapleton is the king of the crop right now,” Campbell said. “He is so talented and so natural. He reached out to me to write some songs and we immediately became friends. I was just in New York playing with him at Giants Stadium. He is so good. He is just gifted with one of those voices that is undeniably great. I’m very honored to have him as a friend.”\n\nPerhaps the most curious chapter in Campbell’s far-reaching came in 2018, roughly a year after Petty’s death, when he was asked to take over guitar duties for Lindsey Buckingham in what will likely serve as the final global tour by Fleetwood Mac. Campbell’s ties to the band were already strong, having played on eight solo albums by Mac empress Stevie Nicks dating back to 1981.\n\n“That’s an example of my charmed life. I’ve had so many things fall into my lap along the way by luck or whatever. But I was digging in back then. Tom had passed away. I was deep in grief. I’m still grieving. I’ll probably be grieving for the rest of my life because he was a big part of my life. Then on my birthday, I got a phone call out of the blue from Mick Fleetwood offering me me the gig. It came at a really good time for me because it gave me something to do that was really high quality. And maybe it was also something to get my mind off just feeling sorry for myself. It was a challenge for me, but I had a great time. They took me around the world, treated me like royalty. That was pretty much a blessing.”\n\nOf course, any conversation on Campbell’s wondrous career eventually comes down to one person: Tom Petty. The two were more than mere bandmates. They essentially grew up together, meeting up in the pre-Heartbreakers band Mudcrutch and playing side-by-side until the former group’s final tour concluded on Sept. 25, 2017 at the Hollywood Bowl. Petty died a week later.\n\n“I always feel his spirit, and his shadow, on my shoulder, guiding me along, reminding me of what my dream is,” Campbell said. “We both just had the same dream, the same instincts, the same musicality and desire and style. From the day we met, we were fast, deep friends and, eventually, songwriting partners.\n\n“We ran down a dream, to borrow a phrase. We had a dream to make music that we loved, so we just went after it. We complimented each other. We gave each other a partner to ride the river with.”\n\nWith Vagabonds now opening a new career chapter for Campbell and a revamped Dirty Knobs lineup that reteams him with longtime Heartbreakers drummer Steve Ferrone, retirement from rock ‘n’ roll isn’t on any table anywhere.\n\n“Retirement, to me, is a non-concept. I don’t understand it. If I physically couldn’t do what I do for some reason, I would still play music at home. Otherwise, I have no idea what retirement is. I would never quit playing music. As long as I can play live, I’ll keep going. It’s the most spiritually rewarding thing in the world for me.”\n\nFusion. Depending on where your jazz alliances stem from, the word might represent music that borrowed from inspirations outside the genre from the late ‘60s onward. To many, though, that constitutes heresy – a selling out to the commercial whims of rock driven groove, flash and electricity. But if jazz came knocking on your door in the 1970s, as it did for me, fusion became generational gateway music. If executed effectively, it would be inspirational enough to lead you back to the more traditional inspirations that paved the way to its electric rebirth.\n\nThat kind of ying and yang fueled debate for much of the ‘70s, ‘80s and early ’90s before fusion’s purpose became increasingly out of step with nearly all audiences. But in theory, the practice lives in on outfits like the trio that violinist and Lexington native Zach Brock brought back to his hometown by way of a Thursday evening performance at the Kentucky Theatre.\n\nWith guitarist Bob Lanzetti and percussionist Keita Ogawa as co-conspirators, Brock reveled in a 90-minute instrumental performance that was very much the product of fusion, just not the kind drenched in rockish overtures. Instead, the fusion came from an assimilation of myriad ethnic backgrounds.\n\nIt’s a good thing Brock and Lanzetti took time to identify several of them for the audience because the points of origin would have likely been foreign to even practiced ears. Peruvian? Melanesian? Really? What mattered was the way such sounds unfolded in the interplay between the three artists. Yes, it was fusion, but the tone and temperament remained light. It was electric, but only in certain instances. And it moved with a subtlety perhaps unique to a bass-free lineup of violin, guitar and percussion. I say “perhaps” because no other trio with that instrumentation comes to mind.\n\nThe fact the group juggled such styles so readily without any of it descending into an academic exhibition shouldn’t seem surprising. Brock, Lanzetti and Ogawa are all members of Snarky Puppy, an often jazz-referenced ensemble that has won five Grammy Awards – none of which have been in jazz categories.\n\nMuch of the performance was based around a six-song album the three released last fall titled Drawing Songs. It was issued more recently in Japan, so the Kentucky outing was something of an overseas record release show. But opening the evening was an even newer Lanzetti work that post-dates the record titled “Vase But No Flowers.” Beginning with three complimentary melodies that regularly criss-crossed, the tune percolated with very discreet levels of electricity. Brock’s playing briefly brought to mind famed jazz violinist Jean Luc Ponty. That’s a perhaps obvious and overused reference, but the animated dots of echo and effects made it an appropriate one.\n\nOgawa’s “Mora Morocco” was more indicative of the tunes that called for a passport. A sunny groove based around sparse but spacious percussion, light guitar chatter and agile, animated violin runs were all spread over rhythms that accelerated with the gentleness of an afternoon breeze.\n\nA medley near the end of the performance sandwiched a Brock solo rich with a compositional/classical richness between two Lanzetti pieces – a snippet of soundtrack music composed for the classic silent horror film Nosferatu (“Orlok’s Arrival”) and the Drawing Songs finale piece “Snow Claw.” The latter grew out of a murky ambience the way a Bill Frisell tune might unfold. It bloomed into a soundscape of broken groove, chamber-like atmospherics and a playfully meditative bit of guitar/drum banter.\n\nThe trio nodded to Snarky Puppy’s most recent Grammy win (it came in February for the Empire Central album) by way of an encore take of “Honiara.” With the original version’s snappy, neo-brassy blueprint trimmed to fit a leaner group setting, the song’s inherent percussive joy played out amid light layers of guitar fuzz and the kind of global string colors that reflected a pronounced but unidentifiable ethnicity.\n\nTurns out, this was a tune Brock built around inspirations from the Solomon Islands. One wouldn’t have guessed that unless had he not told us during the introduction. But in a way, such information didn’t matter. Brock, Lanzetti and Ogawa made accents from another side of the world seem natural, relatable and most welcoming.\n\nFrank Zappa acknowledges early into Whisky a Go Go, 1968 that using the concert setting at hand as a recording session was something new and unknown for the Mothers of Invention. He then quickly reminds himself of a failed attempt at making a live album from a show two months earlier at the Miami Pop Festival.\n\n“That didn’t turn out too swift,” Zappa remarks. “I knew I was blocking that for a reason. We hope that this turns out a little bit better. It’s pretty hard to record what we do because it gets so loud and ugly.”\n\nThe nearly three hours that follow offers us yet another revelatory peak into Zappa’s unmatchable senses of performance and recording and how those worlds converge. Over 50 archival releases have fortified a vast artistic profile since Zappa’s death in 1993, the majority devoted to his ‘70s and ‘80s work. The most intriguing entries focused on an ambitious late ‘60s/early ‘70s run where the instrumental dynamics Zappa created in and out of the Mothers broadened immeasurably. That holds especially true for the Hot Rats/Waka Jawaka/The Grand Wazoo eras, which have been masterfully explored already through other boxed set excavations.\n\nSo far, though, Zappa’s music with the Mothers during the last half of the ‘60s, which mainstream eyes and ears once viewed as unapproachable and sometimes frightening rumblings from the West Coast underground, have been in short supply. But Whisky a Go Go, 1968 changes everything. It’s a raucous, daring carnival of a concert recording that represents the Mothers in action at the famed Sunset Blvd. club where Zappa and company set up shop on a Tuesday night – July 23 of 1968, to be exact – for a mammoth five-hour, three-set performance designed as a recording session.\n\nThe audiences turned out en masse, so much so that patrons lined up around the block were ushered in and out through the evening to make as many as possible part of the project. The band responded with a typically wild meshing of genre-jumping music bolstered by a performance feel that shifted from circus-like hysteria to jazz-savvy solemnity.\n\nIt all sat largely unused for 55 years until this latest release from the seemingly bottomless vault of Zappa recordings turned 2024 into 1968 again.\n\nAnd it begins with a drum rampage. A five-hour performance/recording session and you start with Jimmy Carl Black and Art Tripp assaulting the skins? Horns are gradually peppered in like bicycle horns as the percussive frenzy soon yields to the introductory “Whisky Improvisation: Episode I.” The whole merry romp is something of a roll call, a gathering of Zappa’s troupes covering free improvisation, ensemble drive, spoken social parody and the sense the whole combustible mix will explode at any point. And it does. Again and again.\n\nPlayfulness is rampant when the music is and isn’t rolling, but the Mothers are no jokers. Few bands teetered between chaotic horse play and wildly focused compositional and improvisational daring as this early Mothers lineup did. Sure, bassist Ray Estrada’s falsetto shrill on the doo-wop drenched “Oh, in the Sky” might seem like a joke. But he, Zappa and the rest of the band reveal a total reverence for the genre despite the rough immediacy that dominates much of the album (the next Mothers’ studio record, the doo-wop concept piece Cruising with Ruben and the Jets, would surface just five months after the Whisky performance).\n\nHow out of bounds does this soiree get? Let’s start with “Whisky Improvisation: Episode II,” another drum interlude that leads into a wordless vocal onslaught that approximates vocal hurling (the kind usually experienced after a bad meal) prior to the two-minute jazz atonality of “Meow.” All of that leaps into a mockingly jingoistic sendup of “God Bless America” and, eventually, a revised reading of another Zappa social standing anthem “Plastic People” sung to the tune of “Louie, Louie.”\n\nA similar juxtaposition erupts when an additional Mothers snapshot of the Great Society, “Hungry Freaks, Daddy,” plays out as a tambourine/keyboard-dominate party piece before a switch is slipped and the band launches alertly into “King Kong.” The then-new jazz fusion workout remains a definitive Zappa instrumental work to this day. It’s a masterful display of how disarming the onstage hijinks can seem before Zappa tightens the music into a driving and thoroughly arresting jam. The same feel ensues when the aforementioned “Plastic People”/“Louie Louie” mash-up leads into two takes of “The Duke.” Both showcase solos for various Mothers members – particularly Estrada and sax men Ian Underwood, Bunk Gardner and Motorhead Sherman – that lead into the ensemble merriment of “Khaki Shack.”\n\nFans accustomed to the extended guitar exploits that grew more dominate throughout Zappa’s music in ensuing years might be slightly dismayed by the comparative modesty in spotlight time the bandleader takes here as an instrumentalist. Oh, you still experience a wealth of his playing, but it’s more integrated into the ensemble music. As such, guitar solos that wind their way through “Khaki Sack,” “The Whip” and “Whisky Chouflee” – a collective 30-plus minute instrumental joyride near Whisky a Go Go, 1968’s conclusion – serve more as colors and, at times, catalysts for the Mothers’ overall blend of jazz, jams, and boogie.\n\n“Gee, boys and girls, it sure has been fun having you over to our teenage recording session,” Zappa announces after a loose-fitting jam bursting out of the impossible changes of tempo and temperament that fuel “Brown Shoes Don’t Make It” bring Whisky a Go Go, 1968 to the finish line.\n\nOver a half-century later, with the party’s sense of abandon and adventure now revealed in full, all of the “loud and ugly” fun is truly ours.\n\nIf there was a visual takeaway from Lucinda Williams’ performance Thursday evening at the Kentucky Theatre, it was the sight of the acclaimed Americana songstress being assisted from the stage after an often volcanic 100-minute set, but staying a moment to blow kisses to her audience. Sweets from a survivor.\n\nNow, let’s back up to the start of the show when Williams, still very much wearing the effects of a 2020 stroke, was led to a centerstage microphone she gripped like a lifeline for the duration of the concert. Appearing hesitant and reserved, she and her four-member band launched into a song from her recent Stories from a Rock n Roll Heart album titled “Let’s Get the Band Back Together.” It hinted at the kind ragged electricity she has been known for onstage, but the feel was, well, a little tentative, as if Williams was feeling her way into territory she so often mastered quickly and effortlessly.\n\nThen came the song that needed no introduction, but got one anyway. “This is called ‘Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.’”\n\nThat’s kind of like going into the Louvre and hearing, “This painting is called ‘Mona Lisa.’”\n\n“Car Wheels on a Gravel Road” was the title tune to what was arguably the finest and most influential Americana album of the ‘90s. It solidified Williams’ already-hearty reputation as a songwriter who balanced keen literary insight with a bloodlust of sorts for untidy, Southern soul-saturated rock ‘n’ roll.\n\nThe song’s importance on Wednesday wasn’t lost on anyone. Not the band, which fortified it with a jangly electric charm worthy of The Byrds. Not the audience, which leapt to life with a feverish vigor only hinted at only moments earlier. And, quite possibly, not Williams herself. Through her still motionless stage profile crept a brief, knowing grin.\n\nPiece by piece, song by song, the performance found its footing. While her stroke may have robbed Williams of her guitar playing abilities, something wholly unexpected and quite positive distinguished the performance – specifically, her vocals.\n\nWilliams’ singing onstage and on record has long born the humidity and weight of a rearing that was proudly Southern. It was bluesy, boozy and sounded as drawn as the longest of summer days. On Wednesday (curiously, the night of the summer solstice), her vocals reflected a clarity and efficiency that went completely against her meekish stage appearance. The topicality of “West Memphis” was heightened, “Blue” breezed along with a crispness that reflected and then illuminated its title and “Lake Charles” rose with even greater narrative detail because, son of a gun, you could understand the lyrics.\n\nBut this was no more a safe and cozy showcase than it was a strictly rehabilitative vehicle for Williams. The performance was, in its frequently fine moments, a true sonic rock out. For that, credit her powerhouse band of bassist David Sutton, former Black Crowes guitarist Marc Ford, drummer Brady Blade (last seen on the Kentucky stage in 1996 giving an electric makeover to Emmylou Harris on her “Wrecking Ball” tour) and guitarist Doug Pettibone.\n\nThe latter two were key architects behind the show’s more furious excursions. Blade continually revealed a performance drive that was exact yet powerfully intuitive, as shown during Williams’ authoritative cover of Memphis Minnie’s “You Can’t Rule Me.” Pettibone, especially in the show’s latter half, dropped one piledriving solo after another, leading the band into the atomic encore finale of “Joy.”\n\nIt was also heartening to see Williams, at age 71, not steering clear of the lyrical tenacity of her early ‘00s music. Songs like “Essence” and “Righteously” possessed a narrative forwardness that would make singers half her age (or younger) blush. But Williams’ delivered them with the same casual clarity and purpose she invested in seemingly safer pop-folk fare like 2023’s “Where the Song Will Find Me.”\n\nNothing – not age, not a stroke – will make Williams shy away from a line like “Shoot your love into my vein.” As Memphis Minnie warned us, you can’t rule her. And at the Kentucky, even as she blew kisses of thanks to the crowd she seemed initially skittish with, Williams was as incomparable as she was unconquerable.\n\nWhen the first guitar strains of his solo acoustic performance sounded Wednesday evening at the Lexington Opera House, John Hiatt broke into a grin. It was an immediate reaction to another reaction – specifically, the audience verbally and enthusiastically recognizing the intro to “Drive South.” Who knows what was actually darting through Hiatt’s head at the moment, but a likely guess might be a touch of joy over a fanbase immediately cheering on a 36-year old song as if it were greeting an old friend.\n\nGranted, that’s the raison d’etre of any live performance, to discover a kinship between artist and audience. As such, the 19 songs pulled from over four decades of Hiatt recordings to make up the 95-minute concert thoroughly sealed such a bond. Some were whimsical, other starkly vulnerable and a few treacherously dark. But in this solo setting, all of them have aged well, from the summery “All the Lilacs in Ohio” to the decidedly autumnal “What Do We Do Now.”\n\nMuch of that had to do with the songs’ narrative flow. That, along with a considerable amount of audience familiarity, sparked such well-established Hiatt works as the domestically euphoric “Slow Turning” and its simple but arresting accessibility (“I always thought our house was haunted ‘cause nobody said ‘boo’ to me”). But Hiatt’s own sense of place in a slow turning world also contributed to how appealing such music sounded at the Opera House.\n\nWith his 72nd birthday approaching in August, age played into both the sentiments and physicality of his performance. His vocal tone sounded thinner and more whispery, but not necessarily less frail than in past Lexington concert visits. As with Emmylou Harris’ wonderful outing at the Kentucky Theatre in May, Hiatt used the creases of his voice to accentuate a sagely demeanor for some of his finest songs.\n\nAn exquisite example: “Take It Down,” a deep cut from Hiatt’s 2000 album “Crossing Muddy Waters.” It’s a breakup song with stark, devastating imagery (“Take everything that we have, take it and burn it to the ground; some things were never meant to last; take it down, down, down”). On Wednesday, Hiatt’s weathered singing and the song’s deliberate, mournful pace became a startling piece of performance art.\n\nThere was also the fact that the Opera House show completed Hiatt’s first concert run after a hiking accident last fall left him with lacerations and a skull fracture. He used an onstage prompter on Wednesday to assist with lyrics, but appeared fully focused throughout the show. The very few instances when lyrics got jumbled, Hiatt let loose with another grin and confidently moved on.\n\nWhile the bulk of the performance wasn’t that sobering, its most impactful moments came when Hiatt veered off familiar footpaths onto darker side roads, as in “Like a Freight Train,” a fine, forgotten work from a fine, forgotten album (2010’s “The Open Road”). Here, the hurt went far deeper than a busted romance. It portrayed a life of regret expressed in frighteningly dismissive terms. “Was top dead center, baby. Now my motor’s gone soft,” Hiatt sang with world-weary detachment. “I used to roll through here like a freight train. Now my wheel’s come off.”\n\nIf all this sounds like a downer evening, be assured it wasn’t. Hiatt’s more affirmative tunes are also his most popular. Still, the sun shone through on these songs from different angles, whether it was the playfully mournful rockers’ lament “Perfectly Good Guitar,” the aptly warm and humid comfort piece “Feels Like Rain” or the two tunes from 1987’s “Bring the Family” that jump started Hiatt’s career – “Thing Called Love” and “Have a Little Faith Me.” Both were served as encores.\n\nIn fact, two of the most openly emotive moments in the performance came not from the music, but from between-song stories Hiatt shared about visits with his granddaughter. The first was his impersonation of her discovering how to play harmonica. His reproduced sounds that mimicked an accordion on endless repeat. The second was touching and whimsical, just as so many of Hiatt’s songs are. He recounted how his granddaughter burst into tears when having to leave following a visit to his home. All’s well that ended well, however. “Her folks got her back to the car. She was over it in a heartbeat.”"
