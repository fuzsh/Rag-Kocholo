It’s about finding our own unique inner voice and following it.\n\nI designed the characters and wrote the script based on one of my published poems by the same name:\n\nLife is like a music box, we all dance to the same song\n\nWhen everything sounds the same, we can’t tell something is wrong\n\nEveryone wants to fit in , be approved or to fade and die\n\nWe forget we have a voice, it can be heard when we cry\n\nJust say something authentic, be yourself for the first time\n\nThe universe is in you , be different it’s not a crime\n\nSing louder than a music box, dance to the beat of your voice\n\nYou’re not meant to be boxed in, every song must be your choice\n\nAbout Mostafa Keshvari\n\nMostafa Keshvari is an award-winning Canadian/Iranian writer, director and producer based in Vancouver, Canada.\n\nMostafa is a top graduate of the Vancouver Film School. His films have screened at prestigious festivals, including Cannes. His films are mainly about social issues and often portray strong female lead characters.\n\nMostafa is also a published poet and painter with a degree in financing. Mostafa’s directorial debut feature film, Unmasked, is starting the festival circuit and follows story of a Muslim woman after the recent travel ban."
