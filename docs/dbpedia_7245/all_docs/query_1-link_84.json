        "text": "Talking Screens, A Week In Chicago Film, August 2-8, 2024\n\nOpening this week: “Trap“; “Kneecap“; “Sing Sing“; “Didi“; “Sisi & I” and at the Music Box and on Blu-ray, the director’s cut of “The Linguini Incident,” with an extended conversation with writer-director Richard Shepard on the thirty-plus-year odyssey to completion.\n\nIn Repertory & Revival, “The Warriors,” Nick Ray’s “Rebel Without A Cause,” “The Verdict,” “F For Fake,” “Citizen Kane” and more. Plus, the Music Box begins its Summer of 70mm with a version derived from the original VistaVision of John Ford’s “The Searchers.” Music Box, Thursday, August 8, 7pm.\n\nWriter-director M. Night Shyamalan’s newest single-syllable release, “Trap,” with Josh Hartnett as a father who takes his daughter to a concert by Shyamalan’s daughter, Saleka Night Shyamalan, where a killer is soon on the loose, alongside Ariel Donoghue, Hayley Mills and Alison Pill. The director of photography is the great Sayombhu Mukdeeprom (“Call Me by Your Name,” “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives”). Shyamalan père: “‘Trap’ was created by me and my daughter Saleka from our conversations together about music and movies. It basically started us thinking about doing a music movie together that would also function as a thriller. I started to wonder, ‘Could we do a thriller about music?'” Not previewed for reviewers. Opens Thursday, August 1.\n\nBawdy, wildly self-assured, proudly profane and righteously political Belfast sex-drugs-and-hip-hop comedy biopic “Kneecap” was one of my favorite surprises from Sundance 2024: an English teacher meets a pair of promising louts (who identify as “low-life scum”) and together make music that militates for the preservation of their language. “Irish is like a last dodo,” he says. “What’s a fucking dodo?” one answers. The precision of the writing and direction by Rich Peppiatt and the performances was even more impressive when I discovered afterward that the leads—Mo Chara, Moglai Bap and DJ Provai—are indeed the group, Kneecap. Why isn’t one of their songs about their post-Troubles civil rights movement to preserve Irish? “Because it’s the chorus of a fucking song, not the 1916 proclamation!” or, as Provai says, “Listen youse c—s, the Irish language and hip-hop go hand in hand. I don’t give a fuck what anyone says. It gave a voice to the Black people of America. And now, it’s giving a voice to fucking Irish speakers!” With verbals unrelenting, inspired sight gags and unabashed politics, I laughed until I cried. Then there’s the whole matter of the preservation of native cultures… “Kneecap” is a knockout. Opens Thursday, August 1 at River East, Newcity 14 and outlying theaters.\n\nI had no notion of what was in “Sing Sing” before its Sundance 2024 premiere: a musical with Colman Domingo in a prison setting? Co-writer-director Greg Kwedar based the film on Sing Sing maximum security prison’s real-life Rehabilitation Through the Arts program, portraying a group of the incarcerated who rehearse and perform theatrical stage shows. “Sing Sing” works in an elevated documentary style, largely in medium-close shots and close-ups, and beginning with the elemental performance by the great Domingo, not one moment of patient observation is amiss. This is splendid, heartfelt work. The film is brisk yet also unhurried: standard moments are elevated by pause and breath. Its end credits offer a grand coup de theatre that elevates all that came before; cannily, the last scenes take their time to reveal the secret. Opens Thursday, August 1 at River East and Landmark Century with expansion in coming weeks.\n\nHello, Dali! Richard Shepard’s late twentieth-century screwball satire-heist-romance, “The Linguini Incident” (1991) wasn’t just a lost film for decades, it was an unfinished one. Set in the New York City dining scene of the early 1990s, the then-twenty-five-year-old writer-director’s second feature sets a cast including Rosanna Arquette, David Bowie, Eszter Balint, Buck Henry, Marlee Matlin and Andre Gregory loose in a restaurant called Dali and lets the complications ensue. We talked to Shepard about the resuscitation of his odd sweetheart of a picture; see below. Music Box, Saturday-Sunday, 11:30am.\n\nSean Wang’s 2008-set discomfiting, sometimes hilarious American teen coming-of-age “Didi” is another Sundance 2024 standout coming up for air: in his last summer before high school, a thirteen-year-old Taiwanese American boy learns how to skate and hopes to attract girls while also maintaining a life in a three-generation family (which includes the great Joan Chen). As with “Kneecap,” the dictum of the specific evoking the universal is soundly proven. Opens Thursday at River East and Friday at the Music Box.\n\nNot the passion-project version from Spike Jonze, “Harold and the Purple Crayon,” an adaptation of the 1955 children’s picture book written and illustrated by Crockett Johnson, is “Ice Age” director Carlos Saldanha’s live-action feature debut. With Zachary Levi as Harold, Zooey Deschanel, Tanya Reynolds, Lil Rel Howery, Jemaine Clement and Alfred Molina. Not previewed. Opens wide Thursday, August 1 in theaters.\n\n“Sisi & I” is a lush fantasy of royalty, beauty and power, set on the isle Corfu and poised between Countess Irma and Empress Sisi, far from the constraints of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With Sandra Hüller, Susanne Wolff and an anachronistic soundtrack buoyed by Nico, Portishead and Le Tigre. Opens Friday, August 2 at the Film Center.\n\nREPERTORY & REVIVAL\n\nA brief bit on creating the great opening credits of Walter Hill’s “The Warriors” (35mm). from title designer Dan Perri, is here. Music Box, midnight, Friday-Saturday, August 2-3.\n\nThe once-lost “We The Living,” a 1942 adaptation of a 1936 Ayn Rand novel, described as “the ‘Casablanca’ of wartime Italy” gets a long-delayed Chicago release. Two hours and fifty minutes in two parts. Reception and feature at Facets, Saturday, August 3, 5:30pm.\n\nAt Doc Films, an essential by Nicholas Ray, “Rebel Without A Cause” (35mm) (Thursday-Saturday).\n\nThe Film Center continues its inspired “Entrances and Exits” series with the double feature of Orson Welles’ debut, “Citizen Kane” (35mm, Sunday, 2pm), and swan song, “F For Fake (35mm, Sunday, 4:30pm). Also at Siskel in its Sidney Lumet centennial, his exacting “The Verdict,” written by David Mamet and with one of Paul Newman’s greatest roles. Sunday, August 3, 3pm, Wednesday, August 7, 6pm.\n\nSTREAM LIFE\n\nDavid Krumholtz excels in Austin auteur Bob Byington’s “Lousy Carter,” streaming on Hulu, which had hardly a feather of Chicago theatrical release, but it’s a termite treasure that still tickles plenty with another stellar Byington male worm, ideally embodied by the underrated Krumholtz. Annie Baker’s bittersweet, slow-simmering coming-of-age “Janet Planet” is available from Apple here.\n\nSHELF REGARD\n\nWe talked to veteran filmmaker Richard Shepard via email this week about his newly constituted 1991 debut, “The Linguini Incident.”\n\nWhen the film, oh so many years ago, went through the stages of being smacked around and wrecked, I assume you went through your Kübler-Ross then. How long did it take to let loose of the disappointment and/or rage. I mean, we have the evidence right here that you never let go…\n\nWhether it was my movies “The Matador” to “Dom Hemingway” to “The Hunting Party” to “The Perfection,” I’ve always had final cut, even when I didn’t contractually have it. The movies that were released were mine. Even with Harvey Weinstein! This might have been because I told him that if he recut “The Matador” after he bought it at Sundance, I would have him killed. I told him that I had met a hitman in Mexico who would kill him for less money than an economy ticket from Mexico City to New York and I wasn’t joking. Supposedly it was the only movie he hadn’t tinkered with in ten years! Also, sidebar—fuck Harvey Weinstein. Anyway…\n\nSo my first movie “The Linguini Incident” always stayed with me in this sour way because it was not my cut. I dreamed about recutting it for decades. Small things, but the things that make you proud or not proud. With this 4K transfer and director’s cut I’m finally proud. Flaws and all. And now people will get to discover this amazingly fresh David Bowie performance as if it were new.\n\nWhat were the stages then? You had been trying to get the deliverables, the negative etcetera for years, how did you wind up getting them? Is that a long process?\n\nVery long! During the film’s very strange life, there were several versions of the film that were made and distributed. An overlong and joyless editorial assembly of the movie was released in Europe and Asia. The producer’s cut was distributed in the United States and Canada. Shorter versions ended up on late-night TV for a while. The film was released not only as “The Linguini Incident” but also as “Houdini & Company,” “The Robbery,” “The Restaurant,” “The Incident” and yes, “Shag-O-Rama.”\n\nThe European distributor, Rank, had gone bankrupt. The U.S. distributor—bankrupt. The lab that had processed the film had also gone bankrupt. I checked with every lab in the United States and Canada! None of them had even heard of the film, much less had the negative secretly stored in a “Raiders Of The Lost Ark” warehouse somewhere. I scoured eBay hoping someone would be selling a battered old print. I spoke to a weird cabal of obscure film collectors hoping for a lead. I spoke to folks in Tokyo, Buenos Aires and Paris. Nothing but dead ends.\n\nUndaunted, I started searching where the movie might had screened around the world in the last thirty years! Maybe there was a copy out there, somewhere, just waiting to be rediscovered. I knew the movie had been shown once about seven years before in New York at a museum doing a Bowie show, but they admitted that they had no access to a print, so they showed the crappy VHS version. I was hoping another theater somewhere might have projected a real 35mm film print. One day, in one of my many “Linguini” dark web searches—who knew there was a kinky strangulation fetish group obsessed with the scene where Rosanna Arquette’s escape artist character Lucy nearly chokes to death in a noose?—I found an art theater in Zurich that had shown the film, and on their website, it said they screened a 35mm print. Holy shit—could that be true? Where did they get that print? I emailed them cold, hoping they would remember, and I immediately got a response. Yes, indeed they remembered, and yes, there was a print, and here’s who had it… So, the director’s cut is garnered from the longer European cut.\n\nDid you have the backing to re-edit or was this done by hand? Did you get all the materials you need transferred to digital, and then one day, you have a cut that approximates what you had hoped for decades ago?\n\nThis whole process was done by hand. We had no money. David Dean, who had edited several pilots for me, along with my movie “The Perfection,” offered his services in exchange for a good—sorry, make that very good—bottle of Scotch. We had no access to the dailies, no split tracks (which meant where there was originally music, there would still be music), we only had this one hour-forty-five-minute European version to work with, but that was fine, as we had a pristine interpositive to make the transfer with. The movie I wanted was going to be jaunty ninety minutes or so, with shots reframed, zooms added, sequences reordered, dialogue tightened, and cool moments added that had never been seen in the United States. My editor was working on another, paying job, so we cut on weekends and evenings. We added a few stock shots, digitally fixed a few technical mistakes, and one or two creative ones as well. There were scenes that only had three angles in them, but by reframing, it suddenly felt like there were six or seven! This added pace and helped the humor. Of course, there were things I couldn’t fix. Missed comic moments, uninteresting angles and blocking, a bit player whose performance couldn’t be saved thirty years ago, or even today. Rookie mistakes that are forever cemented in celluloid. Would I have loved access to the original dailies so I could look for varied takes, different coverage, more magic? Sure. But I only had what I had. Still, we changed and tightened and noodled and breathed life back into “The Linguini Incident.” It suddenly felt fresh, funny and unique to me. I knew that there were serious fans of the original film. My goal was to not destroy the movie they liked; it was to just make it a film that I liked, too.\n\nHow did casting work? Even beyond Bowie in the lead that’s a mad cast.\n\nThe cast is incredible. And that’s not even the whole story! Shelley Winters was originally cast in the Viveca Lindfors role of the Houdini shop owner. Ms. Winters showed up with lots of opinions and when we disagreed with those opinions, she asked how many Oscars I’d won, or how many times I was on Johnny Carson. But despite that, I was excited to work with her, obviously. She was a legend. But she showed up to set under the influence of something and couldn’t do her lines, and we lost half a day just trying to get her coverage and finally that night I had to fire her. And when I say I had to fire her I mean that, as our producer was MIA for much of the shoot, I actually fired her. I called her up and fired her, and she was not happy. The next day she called back begging for her job back. The whole thing was so awful and sad. I mean, the worst. But Viveca came in and nailed it, and I got to say I fired Shelley Winters. Which I have to say was funnier when I was younger. Now it just sucks.\n\nDid older Richard find young Richard had done a better job than you had hoped? What did all the seasoning of time and experience bring both to the film audiences are about to see and to your own peace of mind?\n\nOlder Richard is amazed that younger Richard had this crazy opportunity to work with Bowie and Rosanna Arquette and Andre Gregory and Marlee Matlin and Eszter Balint. I mean it’s surreal that the movie happened. Obviously, I’m a different person now, and certainly I hope a better filmmaker, so I wasn’t too hard on myself during this process and just tried to make the best version of the film that I could at this moment. It’s certainly not a lost masterpiece but at least it’s now my not-lost masterpiece. I hope people check it out. The Blu-ray is stacked with extras, including the original version, and it’s on iTunes to rent."
