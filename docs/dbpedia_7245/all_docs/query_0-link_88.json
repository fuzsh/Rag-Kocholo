Almost overflowing at points, the result begins to feel pleasurably claustrophobic. Multiple cameras capture the perspective of multiple realities. What is caught through the lens' apertures shows what’s directly in front but not the surrounding truths. People watching TV or strolling through Central Park view the madness from their own perspectives. The snake continues to eat its own tail."
