        "text": "This article reveals the source for two major themes in Madama Butterfly – one associated with Butterfly herself, the other with her patrimony. The assumption has been that Puccini based these themes on Japanese melodies, but his source was actually a Swiss music box playing Chinese tunes. Specific moments in the opera indicate that Puccini was aware of the titles of these tunes. The sound of music boxes in Butterfly and Turandot suggests previously unnoticed connections between these operas. The music-box melodies may be traced to Fritz Bovet's transcriptions. Puccini encountered ‘Jasmine Flower’ on these boxes, and in Turandot reaffirmed its status as the token of Chinese music.\n\n3 I have traced these themes in the 1904 Italian edition of the vocal score (Ricordi 110000), the 1904 piano reduction score (Ricordi 110001), the 1905/6 English/Italian editions of the vocal score (Ricordi 111200), the 1907 French edition of the vocal score (Ricordi 111360) and the 1907 full score (reprinted by Dover in 1990). (In this article, I will refer to rehearsal figures and bar numbers in the 1907 full score, unless otherwise noted.) On Puccini's revisions to the Madama Butterfly score, see Julian Smith, ‘A Metamorphic Tragedy’, Proceedings of the Royal Musical Association, 106 (1979–80), 105–14; idem, ‘Tribulations of a Score’, Madam Butterfly/Madama Butterfly, ed. Nicholas John (London, 1984), 15–23; William Ashbrook, ‘Reflections on the Revisions of Madama Butterfly’, Giacomo Puccini: L'uomo, il musicista, il panorama europeo, ed. Gabriella Biagi Ravenni and Carolyn Gianturco (Lucca, 1997), 159–68; Dieter Schickling, ‘Puccini's “Work in Progress”: The So-called Versions of “Madama Butterfly”’, Music and Letters, 79 (1998), 527–37; and Philip Gossett, ‘Some Thoughts on the Use of Autograph Manuscripts in Editing the Works of Verdi and Puccini’, Journal of the American Musicological Society, 66 (2013), 103–28.\n\n7 Ord-Hume reports that the term ‘harmoniphone’ was used by Louis Ducommun for his vox celeste cylinder boxes, to which a reed organ had been added, and that this manufacturing practice began around 1850. See Ord-Hume, Musical Box, 134–5. The dimensions of the Guinness box with lid closed are: 12⅞ inches high by 20¼ inches wide by inches deep. The serial number that appears in multiple locations on the Guinness box is 2098. This number, as well as the construction of the cylinder mechanism, helps to identify this instrument as having been manufactured by C. Paillard et Cie in Ste Croix, Switzerland, just prior to 1880. (I am grateful to Jere Ryder, conservator of the Guinness Collection, for assistance in dating this music box.) Markings on the box made by a restorer based in Rhode Island indicate that Guinness acquired the box by 1964. For recordings of all six tunes on the Guinness box, see <http://www.morrismuseum.org/mechanical-musical-instruments-automata> (accessed 18 September 2014). On the Guinness Collection, see Ellen M. Snyder-Grenier, Musical Machines and Living Dolls: The Murtogh D. Guinness Collection of Mechanical Musical Instruments and Automata (Morristown, NJ, 2011). On my discovery of this music box, also see my ‘Music Box as Muse to Puccini's “Butterfly”’, New York Times (17 June 2012), Arts and Leisure section, pp. 1 and 9, and ‘The Sound of Scholarly Serendipity’, The Institute Letter, Institute for Advanced Study (Fall 2012), 10. A colour version of Figure 1 may be accessed at <http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02690403.2015.1008863>.\n\n13 Such publications include Karl Gustav Fellerer, Giacomo Puccini (Potsdam, 1937), 65–75, 98–108; Duiti Miyasawa, ‘Madama Butterfly's Original Melodies’, Opera News, 16 (28 January 1952), 7–9, republished in a slightly revised version as Juichi [sic] Miyazawa, ‘Some Original Japanese Melodies in Madama Butterfly’, Giacomo Puccini: Nel centenario della nascita (Lucca, 1958), 157–61; Norbert Christen, Giacomo Puccini: Analytische Untersuchungen der Melodik, Harmonik und Instrumentation (Hamburg, 1978), Chapter 5, pp. 207–92; and Mary Renner Heath, ‘Exoticism in Puccini: The Japanese Melodies in Madama Butterfly’, Opera Journal, 13 (1980), 21–8. In reference to the composition of Turandot, William Ashbrook and Harold Powers stated that Puccini ‘felt he needed to find authentic melodies, as he had for Madama Butterfly twenty years earlier’, and they refer to Puccini's use of ‘authentic Chinese tunes’ in that opera, although they place ‘authentic’ in scare quotes in some cases. See Ashbrook and Powers, Puccini's Turandot: The End of the Great Tradition (Princeton, NJ, 1991), 61 and 94. On Puccini's use of Chinese melodies in Turandot, also see Peter Korfmacher, Exotismus in Giacomo Puccinis ‘Turandot’ (Cologne, 1993), 80–95, and Kii-Ming Lo, ‘Turandot’ auf der Opernbühne (Frankfurt am Main, 1996), 318–36.\n\n37 The multiple differences between the Swiss music-box realizations of ‘Shiba mo’ and folk performance versions of the melody in China are striking. Puccini's setting, of course, further obscures identification of the Chinese melody by a listener familiar only with Chinese folk performance styles. This is one reason why hearing the music-box version of the tune is crucial in attempting to notice and identify the tune as employed in Puccini's opera. The transcriptions from the Guinness music box are my own, and are based primarily on the reed-organ realizations of each melody.

Schimmelpenninck states that in Jiangsu ‘many different versions circulate’ of this song (p. 167). Also see Frank Kouwenhoven and Antoinet Schimmelpenninck, ‘Zhao Yongming: Portrait of a Mountain Song Cicada’, Lives in Chinese Music, ed. Helen Rees (Urbana, IL, 2009), 23–44 (p. 30). On this genre and its appearance in nineteenth-century Chinese songbooks, see Stefan Kuzay, ‘Life in the Green Lofts of the Lower Yangzi Region’, Lifestyle and Entertainment in Yangzhou, ed. Lucie B. Olivová and Vibeke Børdahl (Copenhagen, 2009), 286–314. A 1920s recording of ‘Shiba mo’ as performed in a Cantonese opera is available at <http://www.civilization.ca/cantoneseopera/opera132-1-e.shtml> (accessed 18 September 2014). A field recording made by Schimmelpenninck in the 1980s is available on a CD accompanying Chinese Folk Songs and Folk Singers and at <http://www.iias.nl/oideion/journal/issue01/zanten/5-audio4.html> (accessed 18 September 2014).\n\n51 In an unpublished paper delivered at the 2002 CHIME conference in Sheffield and entitled ‘On “Eighteen Touches”’, Liu Yong referred to ‘Shiba mo’ as ‘the most popular erotic folksong in China’, and stated that ‘when a writer needs an example of an erotic song, “Eighteen Touches” is always the first one mentioned’. (I am grateful to the author for providing me with a transcript of that paper.) I have identified fictional works that employ reference to ‘Shiba mo’ in this way. See, for example, Han Z. Li, The Water Lily Pond: A Village Girl's Journey in Maoist China (Waterloo, ON, 2004), in which a sexually charged village woman is said to hum an ‘underground song, “Eighteen Touches”, by which a man engaged a woman prior to the act’ (p. 6).\n\n53 In discussing the huaguxi play Shi ba mo, Chen reports that in ‘the music and movement, through solos and duets, the feel of the woman's body from head to toe is graphically explored’. According to Chen's informant, this traditional play – ‘about a sophisticated playboy who goes to a prostitute’ – apparently drove young audience members wild, and they ‘would rush home to make love as soon as the play finished’ (ibid., 132). I should note here that the Japanese term ‘shiba-shiba mo’ (meaning ‘often’ or ‘many times’) occurs in the classic Manyoshu poetry collection in a telling of the famous Tanabata love story in which two celestial lovers do not often have the opportunity to meet, given their separate positions in the night sky. I believe that this linguistic echo is entirely coincidental to Puccini's use of the ‘Shiba mo’ melody.\n\n63 After the Bonze and the rest of Butterfly's family exit we hear a gentle, extended version of the Patrimony theme (including the rocking quaver gesture) as Pinkerton comforts the weeping Butterfly and she declares that she will not allow her family's repudiation to bother her. In the 1904 version of the opera, at a moment leading up to the love duet when Butterfly suddenly breaks free of Pinkerton's embrace and considers her past (immediately prior to rehearsal figure 131; also see figure 126 in the 1907 full score), the opening D–C–E gesture of the Patrimony theme is asserted in the basses. A sound clip for Example 6 may be accessed at <http://music.williams.edu/profile/wsheppar/>.\n\n72 The journalist Luigi Gualtiero Paolini published the news of Puccini at work on Turandot in Bagni di Lucca in the Giornale d'Italia on 19 August 1920. Quoted in Gabriella Biagi Ravenni and Daniela Buonomini, ‘“Caro Ferruccio …”: Trenta lettere di Giacomo Puccini a Ferruccio Giorgi (1906–1924)’, Giacomo Puccini, ed. Ravenni and Gianturco, 169–209 (p. 190, note 3). Paolini reported that the music box had been manufactured in Germany and imported to China. Although it was actually probably made in Switzerland, it is striking that the earliest report was correct on the European origins of the music box, a fact missed by most other commentators on the role of the Fassini music box in the composition of Turandot. For example, Carner repeatedly referred to Puccini's use of an ‘ancient musical-box’ or an ‘ancient Chinese musical-box’. See, for example, Carner, Puccini, 247, 522.\n\n76 On Fassini's career, see, for example, Gaetano Bazzani, Soldati italiani nella Russia in fiamme 1915–1920 (Trent, 1933), 228–9, and Dionigi Roggero, ‘Il barone Fassini Camossi’, Il Monferrato (December 2004), available at <http://www.comune.penango.at.it/files/Monferrato/monf2.pdf> (accessed 18 September 2014). Fassini's career was accurately referenced in Ravenni and Buonomini, ‘“Caro Ferruccio …”’, 198. These authors also cite a letter from Puccini of 19 January 1921 in the form of a poem that suggests the composer had borrowed money from Fassini (ibid., 196). I am grateful to Bibiana Gattozzi for contacting the Italian Embassy in Beijing and reporting that there was no record of any diplomatic post for Edoardo Fassini in the first decades of the twentieth century.\n\n82 Hammelmann and Rose were able to locate the Baroness Fassini in Rome thanks to a tip from a gas-station attendant in Lucca. I am very grateful to Michael Rose for reconstructing the history of this episode for me and for providing copies of the original tapes that were made in Rome. My account here is based on our extensive correspondence, particularly on Rose's detailed account sent to me by email on 23 February 2012. Rose has recently published a book based on the ‘Birth of an Opera’ series: Michael Rose, The Birth of an Opera: Fifteen Masterpieces from Poppea to Wozzeck (New York, 2013).\n\n84 The account of the rediscovery of the Fassini music box offered by Mary Jane Phillips-Matz in her biography of the composer is inaccurate and was based on a 2001 interview with Weaver, who was ailing at the time and was being asked to recall details of an event that occurred nearly four decades earlier. For example, Weaver is quoted as saying that ‘there were five tunes [on the music box], and three of those were quite obviously in Turandot. It was an eerie experience with this tinkly music and the idea that Puccini had had this box. He kept it forever.’ The music box contains four melodies and Puccini did not have the box in his possession. See Phillips-Matz, Puccini: A Biography (Boston, MA, 2002), 266.\n\n86 The Fassini music box is currently held by Lionello Ghiotti, son-in-law of the late Gigi Capra. I am very grateful to Dr Ghiotti for providing me with a video recording and photographs of the music box. The existing tune sheet on this box appears to have been cut from a larger original, as none of the typical printed decoration remains and part of the border is clearly missing. Dr Ghiotti has explained how he acquired the music box in ‘Gigi Capra e il carillon di Turandot’, Graf Boccassi, 2 (2009), 11–13. On the basis of the available evidence, including the Italian television broadcasts noted above, I am able to reconstruct the migrations of the Fassini music box. The box appears to have been manufactured in Switzerland and exported to China in the late nineteenth century. Baron Fassini returned with the box to Italy either after the Boxer War or in 1920 and brought the instrument to Bagni di Lucca, where Puccini encountered it in August 1920. The music box then travelled with Fassini's widow to Rome, but appears to have been given to one of her children and was lent back to her for the BBC recording in 1965. The box was then owned by Pietro Fassini, who gave it to Gigi Capra in Alessandria. Ghiotti's wife, the daughter of Gigi Capra, inherited the music box from her father. (Note that on p. 12 of Ghiotti's article Baron Pietro Fassini-Camossi is said to have given the box to Gigi Capra in 1950. Dr Ghiotti has clarified to me that this date was a mistake on his part and that the correct year was probably 1970, in time for Capra to present the box in the 1971 Italian television broadcast. Dr Ghiotti's box is quite clearly the same one that was featured in the Italian television broadcasts mentioned above.) A colour version of Figure 3 may be accessed at <http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02690403.2015.1008863>.\n\n87 Powers notes that a transcription of ‘Mo Li Hua’ had appeared in John Barrow's 1805 Travels in China in a slightly different version, but he assumes that Puccini was unaware of that source and thus would not have known the Chinese title of this melody. However, Puccini would have seen the tune card on the Fassini box and might have been told that ‘Sinfa’ can be translated as ‘Fresh Flowers’. See Ashbrook and Powers, Puccini's Turandot, 95; 176, note 5. Powers notes that a ‘different form of this tune, having nothing whatever to do with Turandot’ was published in J. A. van Aalst's Chinese Music (Shanghai, 1884) under the title ‘Hsien Hua’ (p. 176, note 9). However, the title ‘Sinfa’ appears on both the Guinness and Fassini music boxes as well as on numerous other music boxes from the period, and van Aalst's publication represents a somewhat divergent transcription of a variant of this melody. Following Barrow, Puccini scholars have consistently referred to the melody as ‘Mo Li Hua’, or ‘Moo-Lee-Wha’ (see, for example, Carner, Puccini, 523).\n\n92 The fact that ‘She pah moh’ on the tune sheet does not line up correctly with the ‘Shiba mo’ tune played on the box and used by Puccini might at first seem to make it less likely that Puccini encountered the Guinness box. (The Guinness box tune sheet's ‘Poutzi’ rather than ‘Pantsé’ spelling of the ‘Bangzi’ tune presents a somewhat similar problem.) However, under any scenario, Puccini's understanding of this title or of the song's basic subject matter would have required either the intervention of an informant who knew how to read the Chinese characters or, more likely, an informant who simply remembered being told that the final tune on the box was an erotic folksong about a woman's body. The tune sheet's decoration style might have suggested to Puccini that the box was of European manufacture or, conversely (given the long history of the Chinese export market), that this was a Chinese imitation of European design.\n\n107 I am indebted to Giuseppe Tasca, nephew of the late opera director Alberto Fassini, who was a grandson of Puccini's friend Baron Alberto Fassini, for providing me with these letters and for offering crucial information on his family's history in Palermo. This correspondence appears to be all from 1916 and concerns Puccini having been filmed by Alberto Fassini's company and, perhaps, the sale of a car by Puccini to Alberto. I am also grateful to Joseph Franconi Lee for putting me in contact with Giuseppe Tasca, and to Dieter Schickling for alerting me to the existence of another letter, dated 21 February 1916, from Puccini to Alberto Fassini.\n\n110 Puccini could have met up with Alberto Fassini at any one of a number of the baron's homes during the period in which he composed Madama Butterfly. Puccini was in Palermo in 1901 and Alberto had a famous villa designed by Ernesto Basile built there in 1903, but it is not clear whether Alberto was in Palermo at the time of Puccini's visit. Puccini was in Rome in 1902 and the Fassinis owned property there. We know that Puccini finished a draft of Act 1 of the opera on 7 September 1902, and so his encounter with a music box must have taken place well before that date, and most likely before May of that year. For detailed chronologies of Puccini's travels, see Dieter Schickling, Giacomo Puccini: Catalogue of the Works, trans. Michael Kaye (Kassel, 2003); and Schickling, Giacomo Puccini: Biografie (Stuttgart, 2007).\n\n111 On this general topic, see in particular Ysia Tchen, La musique chinoise en France au XVIIIe siècle (Paris, 1974). On Amiot, see Lam Ching Wah, ‘A Highlight of French Jesuit Scholarship in China: Jean-Joseph-Marie Amiot's Writings on Chinese Music’, CHIME Journal, 16–17 (2005), 127–47; and François Picard, ‘Joseph-Marie Amiot, jésuite française à Pékin, et le cabinet de curiosités de Bertin’, Musique, images, instruments: Revue française d'organologie et d'iconographie musicale, 8 (2006), 68–85. Also see Kii-Ming Lo, ‘In Search for a Chinese Melody: Tracing the Sources of Weber's Musik zu Turandot, op. 37’, Tradition and its Future in Music: Report of SIMS 1990 Osaka (Tokyo, 1991), 511–21, and eadem, ‘New Documents on the Encounter between European and Chinese Music’, Revista de musicología, 16 (1993), 16–31. For extracts from and discussion of European writings on Chinese music from this period, see Frank Harrison, Time, Place and Music: An Anthology of Ethnomusicological Observation c.1550 to c.1800 (Amsterdam, 1973), 161–94 and 207–18, and idem, ‘Observation, Elucidation, Utilization: Western Attitudes to Eastern Musics, ca.1600-ca.1830’, Slavonic and Western Music: Essays for Gerald Abraham, ed. Malcolm Hamrick Brown and Roland John Wiley (Ann Arbor, MI, 1985), 5–30. On English reception of Chinese music in this period, see David Clarke, ‘An Encounter with Chinese Music in Mid-18th-Century London’, Early Music, 38 (2010), 543–57.\n\n116 I should note that a genealogical website created by a distant descendant gives Bovet's dates as 1825–1913 and states that he was born and died in London. See <http://hibbertfamily.org/html/connections/frederick%20bovet%201.htm> (accessed 22 November 2014). I am grateful to Rosemary Haden for offering information on the Bovet family and to Barbara Galimberti, Martin Wyss and Karla Vanraepenbusch, who offered assistance in tracking down information on Fritz Bovet. Although Puccini was in London in 1900, which is where he saw David Belasco's production of Madame Butterfly in June, I have found no evidence suggesting that he encountered Fritz Bovet.\n\n119 On Fritz Bovet's role in the creation of Swiss music boxes playing Chinese melodies, see Chapuis, La montre ‘chinoise’, 135–6. Chapuis based his discussion on Bovet family correspondence (now apparently lost) and on his interviews with Swiss watch-making families. Chapuis reports that a large number of music boxes were exported to China (pp. 221–2) and that E. Paillard et Cie of Sainte-Croix was particularly active in this trade (p. 223). Chapuis lists several of the tune titles that appear on these music boxes, mistakenly splitting the title ‘Loc-tee Kuntzin’ into two separate titles (p. 224). Also see Chapuis, History of the Musical Box and of Mechanical Music, trans. Roesch, 269, or the original French edition, Histoire de la boîte à musique et de la musique mécanique (Lausanne, 1955), 282. In this landmark volume, Chapuis reproduces the notation employed for pinning ‘Sinfa’ which was given to him by MM. Gueissaz (p. 265; p. 277 in the French edition). For brief references to Fritz Bovet, also see Lindsay and May Ride, An East India Company Cemetery: Protestant Burials in Macao (Hong Kong, 1996), 13, 187. For information on Bovet's time in China during the Opium Wars, see Auguste Jeanneret-Oehl, Souvenirs du séjour d'un horloger neuchâtelois en Chine (Neuchâtel, 1866). For references to Bovet's service as vice-consul for France in Canton in 1856, also see Henri Cordier, L'expédition de Chine de 1857–58 (Paris, 1905), 55–6, and Papers Relating to the Proceedings of Her Majesty's Naval Forces at Canton (London, 1857), 75–8. I would like to thank Suzanne Aspden for providing me with a copy of Bovet's published string quartet held at the Bodleian Library, Oxford.\n\n121 I thank Nicholas Simons of the Music Box Society of Great Britain and Rosanna Harris of the Musical Box Society International for their assistance. Steve Ryder offered his wealth of knowledge on music-box history and technology as well as crucial guidance. Timothy Reed has brought to my attention the existence of several music boxes and sources and I am indebted to him. I am particularly grateful to the late Philippe Rouillé, who sent me copies of tune sheets and recordings of several music boxes that he owned. I am also grateful to Donald Day and Beatrice Farmer for sending recordings of their music boxes and to the staff at the Musical Wonder House in Wiscasset, Maine. For reports on specific surviving boxes that play Chinese melodies, see John Turner, ‘L'Epée: The Chinese Musical Box’, The Music Box, 20/3 (autumn 2001), 87, and Alec Reid, ‘A Pre-Telly Vision Box’, Mechanical Music (May/June 2012), 56. I am grateful to Mr Reid for providing me with a recording of this ten-tune cylinder box, which includes ‘Sinfa’, ‘Bangzi’, ‘Shiba mo’ and ‘Loc Tee Kun Tzin’, as well as dancing dolls. The Mira & Stella Company continued to manufacture boxes featuring these tunes, as is evident in lists available at <http://antiquemusicbox.us/mirastella.pdf> (accessed 18 September 2014) and in The Music Box, 9/5 (spring 1980), 235. The appearance of Bovet's set of Chinese melodies on later Thorens disc music boxes is evident in several surviving examples and in published lists, such as that provided at <http://www.aerialphotolab.com/Thorens_Discs.htm> (accessed 18 September 2014)."
