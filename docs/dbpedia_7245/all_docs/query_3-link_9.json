        "text": "The Showtime documentary following the rise of the legendary show Video Music Box is a breath of fresh air.\n\nDJ Ralph McDaniels story is told and as you watch, you realize that you can’t accurately tell the story of Hip-Hop without him, or the show. Video Music Box was created when Hip-Hop was still in its infancy and the genre was getting zero media coverage. DJ Ralph and Lionel C. Martin (better know as the Vid Kid) gave our music a home and laid the blueprint for shows that followed like ‘Yo! MTV Raps’.\n\nVideo Music Box first aired in 1983 at a time when the only Black artist getting air time on MTV was the King of Pop Michael Jackson. The creation of this platform gave greater reach to the music and also served as a launching ground for many careers.\n\nThe most notable careers affected by Ralph McDaniel, Wu Tang, Nas and Jay-Z are still affecting music to this day. We find out that Ralph directed the famous ‘C.R.E.A.M’ video (depicted in the Hulu series Wu Tang: An American Saga), ‘It Ain’t Hard to Tell’ (Nas), and the press kit for the legendary album ‘Illmatic’.\n\nWhile the impact on music was undeniable, Video Music Box represented so much more for the Black community. As the show grew in popularity Ralph began adding in segments to address social issues like drugs and violence within the community. A true visionary and ally for all things Hip-Hop, Ralph even had a hand in the success of FUBU.\n\nAll in all, the documentary is a refreshing watch for some and a history lesson for others showing how far Hip-Hop has come, and sadly how many icons we have lost over the years.\n\nHaving Nas lead the charge on this documentary makes it that much more special. Getting to see the legend repay Ralph for the role he played in the launch of one the most legendary careers in all of rap feels great as Nas gives Ralph his flowers in the ultimate way. This documentary earns a 10/10 and is a must watch for fans of rap and Black culture."
