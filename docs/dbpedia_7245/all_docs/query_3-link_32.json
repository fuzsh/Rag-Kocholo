The initiative was started by Nas and Mass Appeal Chief Creative Officer and Emmy-nominated partner Sacha Jenkins.\n\nFor the next 3 years, a series of features, podcasts, unscripted shows, and digital shorts featuring many of the important names in Hip Hop will be released, culminating with the 50th anniversary of the genre in 2023. For the month of December, 3 documentaries celebrating the storied history of Hip Hop. These include the Josh Swade directed \"Ricky Powell: The Individualist\" and the Roger Gastman directed \"Rolling Like Thunder\", but things will kick off with the release of \"You're Watching Video Music Box\".\n\n\"You're Watching Video Music Box\" chronicles the longest-running music video show in the world, Video Music Box, launched and hosted in New York City by visionary DJ and MC Ralph McDaniels. The documentary was directed by Nas, and it takes us back to its debut in 1983, to the show becoming a Hip Hop mainstay, and highlighting the role of \"Uncle Ralph\" McDaniels as an influencer, tastemaker, and documentarian as the platform helped to launch the careers of Nas, Jay-Z, Fat Joe, LL Cool J, and Nicki Minaj among many others. The documentary will feature four decades of never-before-seen footage from McDaniel’s packed vault, and will spotlight the series’ global influence on Hip Hop, along with Daniels' professional and personal triumphs."
