You can mix and match tickets as you please. 2 tickets to 5 different films, 10 tickets to one film, etc. This applies to in-person screenings; for virtual options, patrons will need only one virtual access ticket and code to enjoy a film at home.\n\nYou can! When you add an item to your cart, it will stay in your cart until you remove it. This way, you can visit both membership and pass pages without losing your progress. Log into (or register for) your Festival ticketing account (via Elevent) using the Sign In button the menu at the top of the page.

Please note that this applies to individual ticket purchases, not ticket redemptions for multi-film passes.\n\nWhen you add a ticket to your cart, it will give you a message that says “Purchase Maximum Reached” for that specific film; this simply means that you have successfully added that film to your cart and would not need any additional virtual admissions for the same film. If you navigate to other film selections, you will have the option to add a ticket to your cart, until the ticket maximum is reached.\n\nYou should have received an email with the subject line: “Order Confirmation # – Chicago International Film Festival.” If you do not see this in your inbox, please check your spam folder. If you still can’t locate this email, check your bank statement or your Festival ticketing (Elevent) account.

Shorts Passholders will use the Badge Holder Sign-in. There will be no need to “redeem” tickets for Shorts Programs; all shorts programs will be accessible via the video player.\n\nNo! You do not need to redeem all tickets at once; redeem and complete the fulfillment transaction for as many as you’d like, up to the maximum, at any time. Note: You cannot exchange tickets once you have confirmed them.\n\nEach in-person pass can be used by one person at a given time. It is up to the discretion of the pass purchaser as to who uses the pass. Each virtual admission is for one stream on one device. Each passholder can choose who or what device accesses the virtual admission.\n\nYou may follow the normal process to purchase an individual ticket (please see our How-To Guide for more information), but when you reach the billing information page, you will apply your voucher code in the “Extra Code” section, instead of filling out a payment method.\n\nQuestions About Streaming Films & Virtual Access\n\nStreaming simply refers to watching a film over your internet connection (instead of downloading a file to your computer). It’s immediate and available on demand with any device that is connected to the internet.

In addition to the link, you will also receive a VOUCHER CODE, which can be used to access the film via our dedicated apps on Apple TV or Roku devices, if that is your preferred viewing method. Alternatively, you can access the link from your Elevent virtual history page. Log in, and you will see a VIEW NOW displayed with your order details.\n\nNo. Only a select program of films for streaming.
