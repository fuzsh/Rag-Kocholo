It will take around 6 weeks to manufacture.\n\nA custom metal drum will be manufactured for you.\n\n🎶🎵🎶 How to order 🎶🎵🎶\n\nPlease send us a name and a link to a song on Youtube together with the time interval you are interested in.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjhCEhWiKXk,\n\nBruno Mars - Just The Way You Are,\n\n0:25 - 0:45\"\n\nIMPORTANT: make sure the length of the fragment is 14 – 24 seconds (music box limitation).\n\nDue to music box limitations, not all songs can be converted into a nice sounding music box melody. Rap/hip hop, jazz and songs with a lot of repeating notes would not work out well.\n\nUsually, the best part would be a chorus. Please send the song original and not a piano/music box version.\n\n⚠️ If your song cannot be converted into 18-Note music box melody, we can try a different song or opt for a refund.\n\n⚠️ If we have already converted your song into 18-Note melody, there will be a $30 non-refundable Conversion fee.\n\n⚠️ About melody revisions - Please note that we can't guarantee your requested changes are doable due to physical limitations of the music box.\n\n⚠️ Due to the natural difference between the audio demo (digital) and the actual music box (mechanical), there might be a slight difference on how they sound.\n\n🛑 The order will not move forward until we get your approval for the melody. Your timely responses will definitely help us process your order in a timely manner too. Please add our email to your address book and check your Spam and Promotion tabs if you are not getting emails!\n\n❗❗ Custom melody orders that are in the \"Manufacturing Mechanism\" stage and onwards can no longer be changed or canceled.
