North American audiences will soon get a taste of sophisticated (racy) French culture, as Music Box Films has now acquired all U.S. and Canadian rights to the full two seasons of Jacques Ouaniche’s acclaimed French television drama “Maison Close,” produced by Noe Productions International.

“Maison Close,” starring Jemima West (“The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones”), follows the intriguing goings-on of an infamous brothel in 19th century Paris. Beyond receiving international distribution, the series has been getting rave reviews that praise its political astuteness and bold eroticism that the Times assures “would make even a veteran of the ’50 Shades of Grey’ series blush.” The deal was negotiated by Tamara Misert of France TV Distribution, the worldwide distributor of the series, and William Schopf, President of Music Box Films.

Music Box Films, the leading distributor of international, American independent and documentary content in North America, has been delving into international TV lately, having acquired Sweden’s “Wallander,” Germany’s “Generation War,” Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s “Penance” and France’s “The Returned,” which premiered on Sundance Channel in October 2013 and will be released on DVD and Netflix in February 2014.
