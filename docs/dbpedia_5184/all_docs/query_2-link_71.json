This site is intended to give the public access to Crash reports that are produced by the Iowa State Patrol for the entire state. The purpose of this website is to provide members of the public with information related to accidents that occur in their area. If further information is needed, the online reports will advise which Iowa State Patrol District Office to contact, during normal business hours. The site is a work in progress and for the time being will only contain Crash Report information. Once some technical issues are rectified incident report information will be added.\n\nThere is no charge to view any report that is posted on this site. Currently, reports will only be available on this site for 15 days. Any reports older than 15 days will be available at the Iowa State Patrol District Office, during normal business hours, while the department researches an archive feature.\n\nPlease click on FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) for more information on this site.\n\nSearch\n\nCrash and incident reports may be searched by date, type, county or any combination.
