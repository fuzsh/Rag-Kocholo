For voters aged 70 and older, photo ID can be expired for any length of time if otherwise valid.\n\n†The Texas Election ID Certificate is a free photo ID issued by DPS for voting purposes. The number on this ID is NOT your Voter Unique Identifier (VUID) on the voter registration card you receive in the mail. Your VUID is NOT required information on either your ABBM or mail ballot carrier envelope.\n\nVoting by mail in Texas has been available to elderly voters and voters with physical disabilities for decades. Remember, however, that many of the legal safeguards designed to protect voters and their ballots are impossible to enforce in the privacy of the voter’s home. Here are a few tips that may prove helpful:\n\nTo vote by mail, you must provide ONE of the following numbers on your ballot by mail (ABBM) and your mail ballot carrier envelope:\n\nTexas Driver’s License, Texas Personal Identification Number or Election Identification Certificate Number issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (NOT your voter registration VUID number); OR the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number.\n\nIf you have not been issued a Texas Driver’s License, Texas Personal Identification Number, Texas Election Identification Certificate Number or a Social Security Number, you must indicate so by checking the appropriate box on the ABBM or carrier envelope.\n\n*For voters aged 18–69 years, photo ID can be expired for up to four years. For voters aged 70 and older, photo ID can be expired for any length of time if otherwise valid.\n\n†The Texas Election ID Certificate is a free photo ID issued by DPS for voting purposes. The number on this ID is NOT your Voter Unique Identifier (VUID) on the voter registration card you receive in the mail. Your VUID is NOT required information on either your ABBM or mail ballot carrier envelope.\n\nCall your local or county office holding the election and request that an application to vote by mail be sent to you, or download the application here (PDF).\n\nTo vote by mail, you must provide ONE of the following numbers on your ABBM: (1) Texas Driver’s License, Texas Personal Identification Number or Election Identification Certificate Number issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (NOT your voter registration VUID number); OR (2) If you have not been issued one of the numbers above, the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number. If you have not been issued a Texas Driver’s License, Texas Personal Identification Number or Texas Election Identification Certificate Number or a Social Security Number, you must indicate so by checking the appropriate box on the ABBM.\n\nIf you need help filling out the form or mailing it, ask someone you trust to help you. Your helper’s name and address must be written next to your signature and they must sign the application.\n\nAddress your application to the Early Voting Clerk. Applications mailed to an address other than the Early Voting Clerk may be rejected.\n\nSend your application for a ballot by mail as early as January 1 of the year of the election that you wish to vote in. This will give you plenty of time to receive your ballot, mark it, and mail it back to the Early Voting Clerk. All applications to vote by mail must be received by the early voting clerk not later than the 11th day before election day by the close of regular business or 12 noon, whichever is later. Applications to vote by mail must be submitted in person or by mail, email, common or contract carrier, or fax (if a fax machine is available in the office of the early voting clerk).\n\nIf you are voting by mail because you are disabled or are 65 years of age or older, you may use a single application to request ballots by mail for all county elections in the calendar year. While you can submit this “annual” application anytime during the calendar year, it must be received at least 11 days before the first election in which you seek to request a ballot by mail.\n\nGenerally, a ballot must be mailed to the address where you are registered to vote. However, if you are 65 or older or have a physical disability, you may have your ballot sent to a hospital, nursing home or long-term care facility, retirement center, or relative, but you must check the blank on the form indicating which address you are providing. If your reason for voting by mail is absence from the county, the ballot must be mailed to an address outside the county.\n\nIf you need help reading, marking, or mailing the actual ballot, ask a trusted relative or friend for help. It’s not uncommon for someone from a political organization to offer to help with your ballot soon after you’ve received it. We recommend you decline this kind of help for several reasons. If you allow your ballot to be mailed by someone you don’t know, it might not be mailed at all. If it’s delivered to the elections office by a common or contract carrier from the address of a candidate or a campaign’s headquarters, your ballot will be rejected.\n\nFinally, if someone helps you with your mail ballot, you must put your helper’s name and address on the carrier envelope, which is the one used to return your ballot to the early voting clerk. Your helper must also sign the carrier envelope.\n\nYou can get a formal application for a ballot by mail (ABBM) from:\n\nDownload an application for a ballot by mail here (PDF);\n\nThe Secretary of State’s office; or\n\nThe Early Voting Clerk in your county\n\nIf you are voting early because of an expected absence, you may apply in person for a ballot by mail before the early “voting in person” period begins (usually the 17th day before the election). If you are voting by mail because you are disabled or are 65 years of age or older, you may use a single application to request ballots by mail for all county elections in the calendar year. To do so, simply mark “Annual Application” on your application for a ballot by mail when selecting the election for which you are applying.\n\nIf you are voting in a political party’s primary election, you MUST check which party’s primary you are voting in to receive the correct primary ballot.\n\nTo vote by mail, you must provide ONE of the following numbers on your ABBM:\n\nTexas Driver’s License, Texas Personal Identification Number or Election Identification Certificate Number issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (NOT your voter registration VUID number); OR\n\nIf you have not been issued one of the numbers above, the last 4 digits of your Social Security Number\n\nIf you have not been issued a Texas Driver’s License, Texas Personal Identification Number or Texas Election Identification Certificate Number or a Social Security Number, you must indicate so by checking the appropriate box on the ABBM.\n\nIf you are voting by mail because you are disabled or are 65 years of age or older, you may use a single application to request ballots by mail for all county elections in the calendar year. You will see this option under Section 4 of the ABBM, “Send me a Ballot for the Following Elections:” in which you can select each election for which you wish to receive a ballot by mail. While you can submit this “annual” application anytime during the calendar year, it must be received at least 11 days before the first election in which you seek to request a ballot by mail.\n\nYou can write your own application for a ballot by mail, as long as it is in writing and includes:\n\nThe applicant’s name;\n\nThe applicant’s address;\n\nThe number of the applicant’s driver’s license or personal identification card issued by DPS, or if applicant has not been issued one of those numbers, the last four digits of the applicant’s social security number, or a statement that the application has not been issued either of those numbers;\n\nThe address at which the applicant is registered;\n\nThe address to which ballot is to be mailed, if different and if authorized by law (see below);\n\nA valid ground for voting by mail;\n\nIf you are voting by mail on the ground of disability, the following statement: “I affirm that I have a sickness or physical condition that prevents me from appearing at the polling place on Election Day without a likelihood of needing personal assistance or of injuring my health.”\n\nAn indication of the election for which the applicant is applying to vote by mail; AND\n\nThe signature of the applicant or witness, if applicable.\n\nYour ballot by mail application must be sent to the Early Voting Clerk in the county where you are registered to vote. Applications must be received (not postmarked) by last day of the application period. All applications to vote by mail must be received by the early voting clerk before the close of regular business or 12 noon, whichever is later.\n\nFor the May 28, 2024 Election, the last day your ABBM can be received by your Early Voting Clerk is Friday, May 17, 2024.\n\nApplications to vote by mail must be submitted in person or by mail, common or contract carrier, email or fax. If you fax or e-mail your application to the Early Voting Clerk, you must also mail the application so that the Clerk receives it no later than the fourth business day after the day the Clerk received your faxed or emailed application. If you fax or e-mail your application by the deadline noted below, your application will be considered complete and timely as long as the original is received by the early voting clerk by the fourth business day after it was submitted by fax or e-mail.\n\nYou may send in your application for a ballot by mail to the Early Voting Clerk by:\n\nIn-person delivery;\n\nRegular mail;\n\nCommon or contract carrier; or\n\nFax (if a fax machine is available to the Early Voting Clerk)\n\nEmail (send a signed, scanned application as an attachment to an email to the early voting clerk)"
