It departs 3:40pm - central time.\n\nHowever, I will be in the Eastern time zone at the 24 hr check in point.\n\n3:40 pm Central time = 4:40 pm Eastern time\n\nCan someone please confirm that I should do my 24 hr check in at 4:40 pm Eastern time?\n\nI am traveling with 3 others and don't want to give them the wrong info!!\n\nThank you!\n\nCorrect, I am the original poster and not an A list-er. I fly SW about 4 times per year, so I am familiar enough with the check-in process but this is the 1st time I will be encountering T-24 check-in while in a different time zone, therefore I just needed to confirm the timing.\n\n@SWDigits I realized that some of the responses above are incongruous & I do really appreciate your stepping in to verify this!"
