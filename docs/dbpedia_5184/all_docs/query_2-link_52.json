        "text": "An Ozone Action Day is in effect today for the El Paso area. Light winds, hot temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels may be enough for ozone to reach the lower end of the \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" range on the south and east side of the El Paso area, the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston areas, and the upper end of the \"Good\" range in parts of the Amarillo, Lubbock, Midland-Odessa, and Tyler-Longview areas, with the highest concentrations expected in the afternoon and evening.\n\nThe light density smoke lingering from the wildfires in Canada, the Pacific Northwest, and Southeast U.S. continues to have modest effects primarily in the Central, North Central, and East regions as well as portions of the northern Gulf coast. Light surface winds in the eastern half of Texas could also provide urban fine particulate matter with impacts being mostly limited to the more populated areas. Occasional spikes into the \"Moderate\" range will be possible across most of the affected areas with sustained elevated PM2.5 concentrations in North Central, Northeast, and Southeast Texas. Additionally, light winds and a mostly stable atmosphere resulting in limited vertical mixing in far West Texas could keep urban fine particulate matter elevated as well. The daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to net out in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-McAllen, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, and Waco-Killeen areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range in most of the Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Laredo, and Victoria areas. The daily PM10 AQI could reach the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area as well.\n\nLight winds, hot temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels may be enough for ozone to reach the upper end of the \"Moderate\" range (or possibly higher) on the north side of the El Paso area, the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, and Midland-Odessa areas, and the upper end of the \"Good\" range in parts of the Amarillo and Lubbock areas, with the highest concentrations expected in the afternoon and evening.\n\nLight density smoke could have some mild effects on portions of the northern regions with elevated fine particulate matter being more due to light surface winds as high pressure sits in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, southerly winds as a result to that high pressure could keep relative humidity high, especially in the south, east, and coastal portions of Texas. The daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to net out in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-McAllen, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, and Waco-Killeen areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range in most of the Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Laredo, and Victoria areas.\n\nCalm morning winds will only modestly increase during the afternoon and evening hours, and when combined with pollutant carryover from the previous day in far West Texas, the daily PM2.5/PM10 AQIs could remain in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area.\n\nLight winds, hot temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels may be enough for ozone to reach the upper end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth and El Paso areas, and the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Amarillo, Houston, Lubbock, and Midland-Odessa areas, with the highest concentrations expected in the afternoon and evening.\n\nHigh pressure in the Gulf of Mexico and low pressure in the Central Plains will keep surface winds out of the south/southeast, raising relative humidity values throughout the eastern two thirds of the state as well as the Permian Basin. Light to moderate wind speeds could also increase fine particulate matter due to the juxtaposition of limited pollutant dispersion and increased surface moisture. Additionally, light amounts of residual smoke could begin to advect northward out of Mexico into the southernmost regions as well as east Texas depending on the ongoing burnings in Canada and the southeast U.S. The daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to net out in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso, Houston, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range in a majority of the Brownsville-McAllen, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, Laredo, and Midland-Odessa areas. The daily PM10 AQI could reach the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area as well.\n\nLight winds, hot temperatures, abundant afternoon sunshine, and/or elevated incoming background levels may be enough for ozone to reach the lower end of the \"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups\" range in parts of the Dallas-Fort Worth area, the middle to upper end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area, the middle of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Houston area, and the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Amarillo, Lubbock, and Midland-Odessa areas, with the highest concentrations expected in the afternoon and evening.\n\nHigh pressure is expected to remain stagnant in the Gulf on Saturday and should keep south/southeasterly winds prevalent across most of the state. Light winds combined with elevated relative humidity in the eastern two thirds of Texas appears to be the primary driver of fine particulate formation, with smoke not expected to play a major role. The daily PM2.5 AQI is forecast to net out in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the Austin, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, San Antonio, Tyler-Longview, Victoria, and Waco-Killeen areas and the upper end of the \"Good\" range in a majority of the Brownsville-McAllen, Bryan-College Station, Corpus Christi, and Laredo areas.\n\nLight morning winds and lingering urban fine particulate in far West Texas could keep the PM2.5/PM10 AQI in the lower end of the \"Moderate\" range in parts of the El Paso area."
