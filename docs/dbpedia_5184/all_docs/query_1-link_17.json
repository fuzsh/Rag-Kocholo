You can also view the time difference between your location and that of another city.\n\nThe home page displays the clock with the exact time in your region, as well as a pre-installed list of clocks for major cities. You can modify this list as you wish. For any city in the list, you can open a separate page with a clock by clicking on the title with the name of the city.\n\nYou can configure the clock appearance (text color, type, and size), and these settings will be saved; they will be used when you open your web browser next time."
