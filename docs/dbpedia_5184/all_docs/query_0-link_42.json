        "text": "As the days slowly become longer, North Texans are reminded that we’ll soon be changing our clocks again.\n\nEarly Sunday morning, March 10, clocks will “spring forward” an hour marking the beginning of this year’s Daylight Saving Time.\n\nThen we won’t touch our clocks again until November 3.\n\nRelated:Daylight Saving Time 2024: When does it start in the Dallas-Fort Worth area?\n\nThe hour change explained\n\nDaylight Saving Time is a stretch of 34 weeks every year that starts in the spring and ends in the fall.\n\nBut when, exactly, does that happen? The date the clocks change is different every year.\n\nEach year we set our clocks forward an hour the second Sunday in March and turn them back an hour the first Sunday of November. The time changes occur at 2 a.m.\n\nLuckily, many clocks automatically spring forward or fall back as we sleep through the early-morning change — unlike when the United States adopted the Standard Time Act in March 1918. This law also established the different time zones across the county, putting most of Texas in the Central Time Zone.\n\nRelated:Watch: Old Red Courthouse clock tower springs forward for daylight saving time\n\nAlthough many people recognize the time change only as something that causes them to lose or gain an hour of sleep, the initial goal of Daylight Saving Time was to provide an extra hour of sunlight during the day and save energy.\n\nThe 1918 law has been implemented and repealed various times, but the Uniform Time Act of 1966 set in place the current practice of switching between standard time and Daylight Saving Time.\n\nSome states, like Arizona and Hawaii, opt out of Daylight Saving Time and keep their clocks untouched year-round."
