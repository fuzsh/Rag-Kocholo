        "text": "Woodlands, Texas\n\nDallas is located in North Texas, in the Southern United States. It is the administrative center of Dallas County, and parts of the city also border the counties of Collin, Denton, Kaufman, and Rockwall. Three neighborhoods—Cockrell Hill, Highland Park, and University Park—are located inside the city limits of Dallas and are surrounded by other suburbs. The city of Dallas has a total area of 385.8 square miles (999.3 km2), of which 340.5 square miles (881.9 km2) is land and 45.3 square miles (117.4 km2) (11.75%) is water, according to the United States Census Bureau. One-fifth of the considerably larger urbanized region known as the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, where one quarter of all Texans reside, is made up of Dallas. The Demography of Dallas, Texas paints a picture of a city that’s not only growing fast, but also changing rapidly.\n\nTwenty structures in Dallas’ skyline are categorized as skyscrapers since they are over 490 feet tall. Dallas does have a characteristic structure in the Bank of America Plaza, which is lit up in neon but does not rank among the top 200 tallest structures in the world, despite the city’s tallest skyscraper barely topping 980 feet. The majority of Dallas’ famous buildings originate from the modernist and postmodernist periods, while some of it is from the late 19th and early 20th century. Reunion Tower, the JFK Memorial, I. M. Pei’s Dallas City Hall, and the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center are all iconic examples of modernist architecture. Fountain Place, Bank of America Plaza, Renaissance Tower, JPMorgan Chase Tower, and Comerica Bank Tower are exemplary postmodernist buildings. Both the neoclassical design of the Davis and Wilson Buildings and the Gothic Revival design of the Kirby Building are used in a number of smaller buildings. A section of old homes along Swiss Avenue in the city is considered an architectural “hotbed” because it features buildings in every style—from Victorian to neoclassical—and color. A variety of Dallas’ commercial architecture from the 1880s through the 1940s is preserved by the Dallas Downtown Historic District.\n\nSponsored By Ranger Guard of Dallas, Texas\n\nGet the Best Security Company in Dallas, Texas that approaches contract security in a special way.
