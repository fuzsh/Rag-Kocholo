        "text": "The origin of Texas county government can be found in \"municipality,\" the local unit of government under Spanish and Mexican rule. The municipalities were large areas embracing one or more\n\nsettlements and the surrounding rural territory. In 1821, there were four major Spanish settlements in Texas-San Antonio, BahÃ­a (Goliad), Nacogdoches, and the Rio Grande Valleyâand three areas of light settlement and ranching and four major roads. Before the revolution of Texas against Mexico, the political subdivision did not exist. In 1835, Texas was divided into departments and municipalities. Three departments were establishedâBexar, Brazos, and Nacogdochesâalong with 23 municipalities (Texas Association of Counties, website). Under the new Republic in 1836, the 23 municipalities became counties. When Texas became a state in 1845, there were 36 counties. Under the state constitution of 1845, county government varied little from that under the Republic. The only significant change was one that made all county offices elective positions.\n\nWhen Texas entered the Confederacy in 1861 and adopted a new state constitution, there were 122 counties. Adoption of the Constitution of 1876 occurred, ten years after Reconstruction from the Civil War. It is the present state constitution and contains much detail concerning the governmental organization of the county. The number of counties increased steadily until there were 254 counties in 1931. Today, the 254 counties provide services to more than 28 million Texans (Texas Association, 2018). The County populations range from just under 100 residents (Love County) to 4.6 million (Harris County).\n\nThe County is located in north central Texas, and is strategically central to the economic region of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, as well as centrally located within the United States. The County region was opened for settlement by the Mexican colonization laws and was included in an impresario grant before 1836, but actual settlement was delayed until 1841. The first Texas legislature created the County from parts of Robertson and Nacogdoches counties on March 30, 1846, and designated the town of Dallas (a post office since 1844) as a temporary âSeat of Justice.â The act does not state whom the Countyâs name honors; it probably was George M. Dallas, then vice president of the United States. Two elections were held in 1850 to fix the city of Dallas as the permanent county seat. The County encompasses an area of 900 square miles. Dallas County is the ninth largest county in the U.S. The 2010 census reported population for the County at 2,368,139. The Census Bureau has estimated the population has increased approximately 11.4%. The County is a public corporation and political subdivision of the State of Texas. The general governing body of the County is the elected five-member Commissioners Court in accordance with Article 5, Paragraph 18 of the Texas Constitution. Commissioners\n\nserve four-year staggered terms, two members elected every two years. The County Judge is elected at large to serve a four-year term.\n\nDallas County is the second-most populous county in Texas and the ninth-most populous county in the United States. Its county seat is the City of Dallas, which is also the third-largest city in Texas and the ninth-largest city in the United States. The county was founded in 1846 and was named for George Mifflin Dallas, the 11th Vice President of the United States under U.S. President James K. Polk.\n\nThe County provides a full range of services across 2,730 square miles. The major services include law enforcement, criminal justice, human services, record keeping, emergency services, and property tax collections. Maintenance of the county jails is a very significant responsibility of Dallas County. Dallas County has the seventh largest jail in the United States. The jail population drives 60% of the Dallas County budget due to jail standards, mental and health concerns, staffing, facilities, etc.\n\nDallas County shares organizational features with the state other 254 counties: its governing body (the Commissioners Court) consists of one member elected at large (the County Judge) and four members (County Commissioners) elected from districts. In Dallas County, the County Judge is the presiding officer of the Commissioners Court. The Dallas County Judge has no judicial responsibilities, unlike those in smaller Texas counties. As stated previously, every county in Texas is broken into four districts.\n\nThe Commissioners Court sets the County tax rate, adopts the budget, appoints boards and commissions, approves grants and personnel actions, and oversees the administration of county government. The Commissioners Court also approves the budget and sets the tax rate for the hospital district, which is charged with the responsibility for providing acute medical care for citizens who otherwise would not receive adequate medical services. The County Judge and County Commissioners serve four-year terms. Each commissioner supervises a Road and Bridge District. Other elected officials in Dallas County are the County and District Clerks, Tax Assessor-Collector, Sheriff, District Attorney, Treasurer, and five Constables. All trial court judges (District Judges, County Court Judges, and Justices of the Peace) are also elected. The State District Judges in each county select the County Auditor, who serves as the chief accountant for\n\nthe county.\n\nDallasâ County Tax Rate continues to be one of the lowest urban counties in Texas. Dallas County conducts its financial affairs pursuant to AA policy established by Commissioners Court. The maintenance of a reserve balance in excess of 10.5% of budgeted expenditures is the cornerstone of retaining the AAA/AAA ratings from the major bond rating companies. The Countyâs AAA/AAA bond rating remained intact and unchallenged.\n\nThe County Auditor is appointed according to Texas State Statutes for two-year terms by the District Judges. The County Auditor has responsibilities for prescribing systems and procedures for handling finances of the County, certifying available funds for County budgets, and âexamining, auditing, and approvingâ all disbursements from County funds prior to their submission to Commissioners Court for approval. It is the Auditorâs duty under statutory mandates to determine if claims are in conformance to laws governing county finance and to audit records of precinct offices that collect funds. The Auditor presents status of audit risk assessments to the Finance Committee and publishes final audit reports on the web. The Commissioners Court has vested accounts payable and payroll processing functions with the County Auditor. Additionally, the County Auditor serves as Chief Financial Officer for federal and Texas financial award programs; Juvenile Programs and Adult Probation Departments.\n\nFinancial management controls regarding banking and investments are managed by the County Treasurer, an elected position. The Treasurer chairs the County Finance Committee and submits for annual recertification an official investment policy. In accordance to Texas statutes, the Countyâs investment policy was reviewed with recommended updates. Budget authority, control over purchasing transactions, and human resource management are assigned to directors appointed by Commissioners Court. Policy and procedures are developed according to sound business practices and in strict conformance to federal, State and local financial statutes.\n\nThe County provides many services not ordinarily provided by any other entity of government and provides additional services in cooperation with other local governmental units. A primary service is the administration of justice, which includes the civil and criminal county and district courts, justices of the peace, constables, district attorney, investigators, clerks of the courts, sheriff, jail, security and emergency management, medical examiner, crime laboratory and grand jury bailiffs. Other functions performed by the County include the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges, either independently or in cooperation with other entities; administration of public health services; assistance to indigents; and the provision of juvenile, health, education and welfare services involving the care and correction of dependent or delinquent children, as well as property tax collections for multiple agencies.\n\nThe annual budget serves as the foundation for the Countyâs planning and control. Budget workshops are hosted periodically by the Office of Budget and Evaluation with the final budget approved by the Commissioners Court in accordance with statutory guidelines. Potential loss of State and federal funds is considered in developing the budget. The final budget includes contingency and emergency reserves line items. Encumbrances are carried forward to the subsequent year for all funds. Unencumbered appropriations for the general fund lapse at fiscal year-end. The General fund unassigned reserves are addressed in budget policies, targeted at 10.5% of budgeted current expenditures expected to be paid currently. The Commissioners Court has committed funds for major technology projects and major capital development. Any available budget for these committed funds is carried forward annually for those specific purposes. Most appropriated budgets are prepared by fund, function, department, and category.\n\nCapital expenditures for general operations are approved on a line item basis but a multi-year capital improvement plan is utilized to track major capital projects. All budget transfers between departments and/or projects must follow statutory approval processes. Budget to actual comparisons are provided in this report for each individual government fund for which an appropriated annual budget has been adopted. Budgets funded by federal and State financial assistance are authorized individually on application and acceptance of awards by order of the Commissioners Court.\n\nAnother governmental unit is included in the Countyâs reporting entity because the Countyâs governing body appoints the board, approves tax rate and operational and financial relationship with the County is significant.\n\nDiscretely Presented Component Unit - The Dallas County Hospital District (District) is under the direction of a seven-member Board of Managers who are appointed by the Commissioners Court. Although the Commissioners Court approves the Districtâs budget, sets its tax rate, and approves major contracts, the District is an organization separate from the County. These factors dictate inclusion of the District in the Countyâs financial statements. According to the Texas Constitution, the District, not the County, is responsible for the Districtâs ongoing debt payments regardless of any future financial/economic events. The Districtâs financial data is presented separately to emphasize that it is legally separate from the County. The District operates under different statutory and constitutional authority. The District also has a separate constitutional tax limitation, independent power of eminent domain and individual right of ownership of property. The District maintains a medical facility, which provides service to indigents residing within the District and serves as the major teaching hospital for the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. The hospital is a Level I Trauma Center, a Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and a regional burn center.\n\nBecause of the important benefits of having outdoor spaces, Dallas County and many of its cities have been actively working to create a comprehensive trail system in the Dallas area. It is our goal to have a system that connects work places, neighborhoods, retail areas and other major destinations, and that enables people to safely walk, run, bike, or skate from one end of the County to another--a distance of at least thirty miles--without the need of a car.\n\nThere are currently over 150 miles of major hard surface trails (i.e., trails with a width of at least eight feet and a length of at least 1.5 miles) and 17 miles of dedicated bike lanes in Dallas County. These trails and bike lanes are located in the cities of Dallas, Richardson, Irving, Grand Prairie, Carrollton, DeSoto, Lancaster, Mesquite, Addison, Farmers Branch, and Garland, and they make it possible to reach major employment centers like Las Colinas and the Telecom Corridor, to connect with DART light rail stations, to enjoy views of White Rock Lake, Bachman Lake, and the Trinity River, to see concerts and sporting events at the American Airlines Center, to reach SMU or the University of Texas at Dallas, and to travel from beyond the County's border to downtown Dallas.\n\nThe County and its cities are also presently in the process of designing and constructing another twenty-five miles of trail which should be completed within the next two-to-three years. These projects, among others, will involve extending the already popular Katy Trail, building the first major trail in West Dallas (Chalk Hill), and extending what will become the Dallas area's most significant east-west trail (Northaven).\n\nThere are currently over 150 miles of major hard surface trails (i.e., trails with a width of at least eight feet and a length of at least 1.5 miles) and 17 miles of dedicated bike lanes in Dallas County.

The CDBG program was created by Congress in 1974 to assist neighborhoods. Its funding can be used for a wide variety of purposes as long as the projects either eradicate blight, principally benefit low/moderate income people, or eliminate a community-threatening condition. About 65% of the County's funding is allocated to its participating cities using a formula that takes into account a city's population and the percentage of it that is low/moderate income. The cities typically use this funding for code enforcement and to reconstruct streets, renovate parks, and install new water/sewer lines. 20% of the County's CDBG funding is used to operate the program and to manage its various projects (at any time, the program is usually funding about twenty different projects or activities). The remaining 15% of the County's CDBG funding is used to operate a Home Loan Counseling Center which assists low/moderate income people who are interested in buying a home."
