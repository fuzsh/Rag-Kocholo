        "text": "Answer: Yes, Texas has two time zones, they are: Central Time Zone for most of the state and Mountain Time Zone for a smaller western portion. This is due to its large geographical size and location.\n\nTexas and Its Time Zones\n\nMajority of Texas: Most of Texas is in the Central Time Zone. This includes big cities like Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio.\n\nWestern Part of Texas: A small part of West Texas, including cities like El Paso and Hudspeth County, is in the Mountain Time Zone.\n\nWhy Two Time Zones?\n\nSize of Texas: Texas is a really big state, one of the largest in the United States. Because of its size, it spans a wide area where two different time zones apply.\n\nGeographical Location: The western edge of Texas is aligned more with states to the west that follow Mountain Time.\n\nTraveling in Texas\n\nWhen you travel across Texas, especially from east to west or vice versa, you’ll experience a change in time zones. Most of Texas is in the Central Time Zone, which includes big cities like Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio. However, as you move towards the western part of the state, such as when you approach cities like El Paso, you enter the Mountain Time Zone.\n\nThis shift in time zones happens because Texas is a very large state that stretches across two different time zones. The Central Time Zone is used in the eastern and central parts of Texas, while the Mountain Time Zone is observed in the far western areas.\n\nAs you travel and cross from one time zone into another, there’s a change in the official time"
