This home for the pan-Asian, Asian American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) community will return to the private, invite-only venue at Riverhorse on Main Street for three days of interactive panels, firesides, and celebration during the festivalâs opening weekend, January 19 to 21, 2024.Â\n\nThe Sunrise Collective will convene notable and emerging AANHPI and multicultural talent, filmmakers, and executives in conversation around the power of creatives to bring authentic AANHPI stories to life, the importance of celebrating AANHPI perspectives to overcome stereotypes and misconceptions, and the state of AANHPI representation in front of and behind the camera. Notable programming includes a conversation between Daniel Dae Kim and Lucy Liu, a fireside chat with Steven Yeun; a one-on-one with 2024 Sundance jurors Mira Nair and Shaunak Sen; a sneak preview of Chrissy & Dave Dine Out and intimate dinner with Chrissy Teigen, David Chang, and Joel Kim Booster, and the second annual Multicultural Dinner co-hosted with Illuminative, Latinx House, and MACRO.Â\n\nOn Friday morning, guests of the Sunrise Collective are invited to a Tribute to Michael Latt, CEO of Lead With Love and social justice advocate. On Friday evening, Sunrise Collective and Pop Culture Collaborative will present the second annual Multicultural Dinner alongside partner Onyx Collective and co-hosts Illuminative, Latinx House, and MACRO, to bring the creative community and multicultural organizations together over a shared meal. The dinner presentation will feature a reimagination of Indian fare prepared by Maneesh Goyalâs award-winning restaurant, SONA.\n\nOn Saturday evening, Freeform brings Chrissy & Dave Dine Out to Sunrise Collective with a sneak preview, conversation with hosts Chrissy Teigen, David Chang, and Joel Kim Booster, and intimate dinner. Following the dinner, Sunrise Collective will host its inaugural âSnowed In at Sunriseâ party, presented by Starz.\n\nThe Sunrise Collective is made possible with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and United Airlines, and programming partners Define American, Google TV, The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, and Procter & Gamble.\n\nA few words from the three partners:\n\nâMy partners and I are truly excited to build on the success of last yearâs Sunrise Collective and spotlight even more of Sundanceâs AANHPI participants,â said Daniel Dae Kim, CEO of 3AD. âOur programming has been carefully curated to introduce innovative ideas and encourage thoughtful discussion, as well as celebrate the increasingly multicultural community convening for this yearâs festival. Iâm grateful to Gold House, TAAF and 3AD for once again joining forces to honor our past, applaud our present, and invest in our future.â\n\nâThe Asian American Foundation is thrilled to welcome the Sundance community back to the Sunrise Collective,â said Norman Chen, CEO of The Asian American Foundation. âBy creating spaces that cultivate AANHPI artists, we are building strong conduits for our stories to not only be told, but celebrated. This year we are grateful to work with our special advisors, award-winning filmmakers and Sundance alumni Tanya Selvaratnam and Shruti Ganguly, to develop programming that elevates our collective and diverse voices. Additionally, we are proud to continue our commitment to the Sundance | TAAF Fellowship & Collab Scholarship, through a grant provided by our AAPI Giving Challenge partner Panda Express, as well as The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. By supporting a new cohort of 12 AANHPI artists to bring their stories to life, we ensure that more incredible narratives like that of our inaugural fellow Sean Wang (Didi, Dramatic Competition) will be featured at the festival for years to come.â\n\nâSunrise House was created to provide a safe haven for Asian Pacific artists to take space at Sundance, connect and grow with one another, and--vitally--link with other communities. Now, more than ever, shared stories are a gateway to shared opportunities,â says Bing Chen, CEO & Co-founder of Gold House. âIn addition to funding and supporting Sean Wangâs Didi and Arun Bhattarai and Dorottya ZurbÃ³âs Agent of Happiness, weâre honored to further cross-cultural bonds through Sundanceâs first multicultural film fund, the Sundance | One House Filmmakers Fund with East West Bank Foundation and so many of our peer organizations like the NAACP, GLAAD, RespectAbility, and Latinx House.â\n\nProgramming at Sunrise Collective includes:Â\n\nConversation with Lucy Liu: Join actor and producer Daniel Dae Kim in a fireside chat with trailblazer Lucy Liu on her new film Presence and her prolific career.Â\n\nFireside with Steven Yeun: A one-on-one conversation between Daniel Dae Kim (Lost; Executive Producer of The Good Doctor) and Steven Yeun (Golden Globe winner, Beef; Love Me) on finding the balance between the demands of building a successful career and honoring the personal priorities of family and relationships.\n\nFireside Chat with Mira Nair & Shaunak Sen: Award-winning filmmakers and Sundance 2024 jurors, Mira Nair (Mississippi Masala; Monsoon Wedding) and Shaunak Sen (All That Breathes) discuss the pursuit of humanity and humaneness in their creative process and the ways in which films can change the world.\n\nBadass Women Truth Tellers: Join Jose Antonio Vargas (Founder, Define American) as he explores the ins and outs of truth telling with veteran director, writer and producer Ramona Diaz (And So It Begins), Maria Ressa (Nobel Peace Prize Winning Journalist) and Leni Robredo (former Vice President of the Philippines).\n\nEntertainers as Activists: Join Bridgit Antoinette Evans (CEO, Pop Culture Collaborative) in conversation with Richa Chadha (actress, producer and activist), Nik Dodani (actor), Kobi Libii (actor, writer and director), and Bao Nguyen (award-winning filmmaker & Director, The Greatest Night in Pop) about roles entertainers and artists play in raising awareness and rallying support for social and political issues.\n\nDirecting Asian, Asian American and Arab Narratives Presented by MacArthur Foundation: Kathy Im (Director of Journalism and Media, MacArthur Foundation) explores the finer points of filmmaking and evolution of Asian, Asian American and Arab narratives with Sundance debut directors Amrou Al-Kadhi (Layla), Arun Bhattarai (Agent of Happiness), Greg Jardin (Itâs Whatâs Inside), Shuchi Talati (Girls will be Girls) and Sean Wang (Didi).\n\nGuts & Glory: Voices from Behind the Lens: Dig into the inner workings of cinema in this discussion with some of the key creative forces working their magic to bring stories to the screen.
