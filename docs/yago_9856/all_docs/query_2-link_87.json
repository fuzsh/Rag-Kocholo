        "text": "While just devoured at the 81st Annual Golden Globeses by taking home five awards, including best comedy, fans have quite the appetite.\n\nLast season of the culinary dramedy left viewers in a cacophony of yelling, uneasy stomachs and a \"chaos menu\" indicative of the cooks firing up the dishes. Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) sabotages his relationship with Claire (Molly Gordon), seemingly resigned to the belief that he needs to be unhappy to be successful. Despite everything, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri) finds affirmation in her pursuit to win The Bear a Michelin star, as Carmy warns her of the cost: \"You're going to have to care about everything more than anything.\"\n\nFor those hungry for more, here's everything we know about whether The Bear will re-open for season 3.\n\nWill there be a season 3 of The Bear?\n\nYes, chef! FX renewed The Bear for season 3 as of last November. Considering its marked critical acclaim, it's not the biggest surprise. In fact, Deadline reported that the latest installment was the most-watched premiere of any FX series on Hulu.\n\nWhile we await more sizzling details, hit the \"save\" button at the top of this article to bookmark the page and return for more The Bear updates.\n\nDo we know The Bear season 3 release date yet?\n\nOfficial dates have yet to be confirmed, but no need to call mom just yet. When promoting his film The Iron Claw, Jeremy Allen White stopped by the Today show and gave a better timeline for season 3.\n\n\"I think we're going to get started up in like February, March,\" he says. \"I'm going to get together with some chefs in January and start prepping in the kitchen again, sharpening up the skills,\" he said.\n\nFor reference, season 2's filming began last February in Chicago, Illinois, per Collider. All 10 episodes of the last season premiered in summer 2023. So, here's hoping that season 3 is similarly just around the corner.\n\nDo we know who will be in The Bear season 3 cast?\n\nShould The Bear return, the usual list of characters from previous seasons includes:\n\nJeremy Allen White as Carmy\n\nAyo Edebiri as Sydney\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach as Richie\n\nAbby Elliott as Natalie\n\nLionel Boyce as Marcus\n\nLiza Colón-Zayas as Tina\n\nMatty Matheson as Neil Fak\n\nEdwin Lee Gibson as Ebra\n\nOliver Platt as Uncle Jimmy\n\nChris Witaske as Pete\n\nThe epic \"Fishes\" episode alone stirred up a number of surprise guest appearances, including the likes of Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Will Poulter, Olivia Colman and John Mulaney. Whether or not those actors return depends on where the story goes.\n\nAppearing in flashbacks for both seasons, Carmy and Natalie's late brother Michael (Jon Bernthal) is likely to make a comeback. What's more, season 2 newcomer Molly Gordon may continue her role if Carmy mends his relationship with Claire. Who knows, Jamie Lee Curtis could also return to play the siblings' mother Donna.\n\nWhile he admitted he'd love to see Olivia and Jamie Lee reprise their roles, Jeremy admitted to Deadline that his dream guest stars include Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri's Sam Rockwell and The Big Lebowski's John Turturro.\n\nDo we know what The Bear season 3 will be about?\n\nSeason 2 ended on Friends and Family Night but not without a hitch. The next chapter will likely follow Carmy and company as they open for business, with a mere few months to turn a profit and pay off Uncle Jimmy's loan. Otherwise, the Bear closes up shop for good.\n\nWith Carmy accidentally locked in the walk-in fridge and sabotaging his relationship with Claire, we're bound to explore where they stand in the aftermath. That consequentially led to a tense standoff with Richie, too. Sydney and Carmy might also be on a slow burn that could ignite in the episodes to come.\n\nIt also unpacked Carmy's family trauma. In the season's longest episode, viewers witnessed a flashback set at the Berzatto family's Feast of the Seven Fishes. Insults were hurled, as were forks ... shortly followed by a car driven into a house. In the present, Pete, unknowingly, is the one to tell Donna of Natalie's pregnancy. We wouldn't be surprised if the season continues to dive further into their family history.\n\nAs for Carmy's relationship with Sydney, fans continuously voice how they want the friends to possibly pursue a romance with one another. While anything is possible with The Bear, Ayo Edibiri weighed in on the speculation during an interview with The Hollywood Reporter ahead of the SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\n\"It's really not our thought process when we're making the show, and I understand it can be part of a show's culture,\" she explained to the outlet. \"But I don’t think they’re going to get what they want.\"\n\nFor those wondering what happens between Carmy and Claire once he leaves the fridge? Jeremy recently responded to those heated inquiries while at the 2024 Golden Globes.\n\n\"I truly have no idea,\" he said, \"As Jeremy, reader of scripts and watcher of show, I think Claire is so lovely and kind to Carmy. I think she deserves an apology at the very least. So, I hope there's some version of that when I read the scripts.\"\n\nWhere can I watch and stream The Bear?"
