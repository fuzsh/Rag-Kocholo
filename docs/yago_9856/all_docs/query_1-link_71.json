        "text": "Sundance a la carte\n\nThese are Post movie critic Steven Rosen's pick of the 10 best movies at this year's Sundance Film Festival: - \"American Hollow'' - \"The Blair Witch Project''\n\n- \"Guinevere''\n\n- \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels''\n\n- \"The Lovers of the Arctic Circle''\n\n- \"Run Lola Run''\n\n- \"SLC Punk!'' - \"Sugar Town''\n\n- \"Three Seasons''\n\n- \"Tumbleweeds''\n\nBy Steven Rosen\n\nDenver Post Movie Critic\n\nFeb. 7 - Subtitles are cool again.\n\nThat was the symbolic message of this year's Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, where \"Three Seasons'' won both the Grand Jury Prize and the Audience Award as the best American dramatic film in competition.\n\nSundance, which once was called the United States Film Festival, is the premier annual event for independent American movies - those not produced or distributed by Hollywood studios. (Actually, many are distributed by the art-house-oriented, separately run \"classics'' divisions of studios.) Beginning with \"sex, lies and videotape,'' which won the Audience Award in 1989 and went on to gross $25 million, Sundance has made American-indie films hip - the artistic alternative to Hollywood gloss. And that ascendant hipness came at the expense of the older alternative, foreign-language movies.\n\nThus, the importance of the \"Three Seasons'' victory cannot be overstressed as a harbinger of change. In essence, this is a foreign film. Young director Tony Bui, born in Saigon but a U.S. resident since age 2, returned to Saigon to make the movie, the first U.S. feature shot there since the war's conclusion. Except for Harvey Keitel, the patron saint of young filmmakers, all the actors are Vietnamese and virtually all the dialogue is in Vietnamese. Beyond that, the film's mood is foreign. Exquisitely photographed, it is both solemn and dreamy. The story, which is focused if flat dramatically, revolves around the efforts of several characters to find peace and solace in a culture harsh on individual happiness. It has echoes of Italian neorealism - \"The Bicycle Thief,'' particularly. Bui, who also wrote the film, means it as a tale of hope and reconciliation - for himself, for the residents of his hometown whose lives have been so changed by losing the war, for Americans who think of Vietnam only in connection with the war. But if the movie, which is being released by October Films, is as popular with the American public as it was at Sundance, \"Three Seasons'' will offer another dimension of reconciliation. It will bring American-indie and foreign-language films together. Among those in Park City who tried to attend as many movies as possible, the talk was that the foreign-language films overall were superior to the American offerings. There also was praise for another foreign-language American film, \"La Ciudad.'' The single best movie I saw, \"The Lovers of the Arctic Circle,'' was from Spain. Too many of the American movies were predictable, even when good. They were either too beholden to alternative-rock for their energy or too earnest in their depiction of struggling families. Sundance, which this year presented approximately 120 features during its 11 days, is divided into several sections. The two most important, the Dramatic and Documentary Competition films, are limited to American movies almost always by new or unestablished directors. But there also is a very showy Premieres section that presents new higher-profile films such as Robert Altman's lightweight \"Cookie's Fortune,'' the disappointing opening-night choice. And there's a World Cinema section for foreign films.\n\n\"The Lovers of the Arctic Circle,'' from director-writer Julio Medem, was in the lively World section. While it contains the eroticism of a Pedro Almodo√övar film, it eschews his passionate heat for a cooler and almost-mystical fatalistic tone that at times recalls \"Breaking the Waves'' - about as far from a Spanish film as one can get. The characters Otto and Ana have more in common than the fact that their names are palindromes. Throughout their lives, their paths cross - both in bed and in the skies while flying in planes. Medem's innovative direction and the music contribute to the mysteriousness of his tale, which was unlike any other Sundance film. Also unlike any other Sundance film was \"Run Lola Run,'' from German director Tom Tykwer. Owing something to \"Groundhog Day,'' it offers several scenarios in which Lola must race from her home to a street corner in 20 minutes with money her boyfriend owes mobsters. Effective score Wildly imaginative visually, it uses live action, still photos, film, video, animation and a poundingly effective electronica score to keep up the tense excitement. But most of all it benefits from star Franka Potente, a punk Mona Lisa with a mess of flame-red hair, a mysteriously alluring face, fast legs, and a blood-curdling scream.\n\nCuriously, the only American movie to match these in technical daring was squirreled away in the festival's obscure Park City at Midnight cult-film section. That didn't stop the creepy \"The Blair Witch Project'' from being chased and acquired by distributors - it was one of the festival's big buzz generators.\n\n\"Blair Witch's'' premise is that, several years after three young people disappear in a Maryland forest while making a documentary about a witch legend, their raw footage has been discovered and is being shown for the first time. This immediately fills us with fear and loathing, as if we're watching a snuff film. We don't know what horrible things we'll be forced to see and when. Normal movie rules don't apply. The film's writer-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez play with this concept wonderfully. The intentional rugged amateurishness of the footage is exactly what makes the film so real. At some points, there are no images - we hear the noises the three victims make while we watch a dark screen. It is terrifying.\n\nAmerican documentaries are an important part of Sundance, which previously launched such hits as \"Hoop Dreams'' and \"Crumb.'' This year, the documentaries were far more American than usual - three of those in competition used the word \"American'' in their titles. \"American Pimp,'' from Allen and Albert Hughes ( \"Menace II Society'') attempts to look at the role of the pimp in both real life and American pop culture. The film has entertainment value - pimps are great talkers and gaudily awful dressers - but never probes as deeply or fearlessly into the lives of its subject as it should. It seems superficial and excessively gregarious. Still, it deserves some recognition for listing an entire \"cast'' of 16 pimps, four prostitutes and one rapper (Too Short). \"American Hollow,'' directed by Rory Kennedy (Robert Kennedy's daughter), was the best competition documentary that I saw. In classic cinema verite style, it observes the dynamics of life among several generations of an impoverished Appalachian clan. As the elderly, dignified matriarch recalls the terrible beatings her father gave her mother, a troubled 17year-old boy is alternately violent and childish while pursuing a reluctant girlfriend. HBO will broadcast it this year.\n\nThe \"Crumb''-like \"American Movie,'' which took the Grand Jury Prize for best documentary, had everyone talking. (Or talking about surviving it - at one screening, debris fell from the ceiling onto several patrons.) Milwaukee filmmaker Chris Smith spent two years chronicling the sometimes-pathetic, sometimes-hilarious obsessiveness with which another Wisconsin director, Mark Borchardt, went about trying to make ultra-lowbudget horror films.\n\nThis is not light-spirited, let'smake-a-movie fun. Borchardt has a serious drinking problem and a ruinous family life, and his friends aren't doing much better. And the scenes in which he prods his decrepit, elderly Uncle Bill into being a cash-cow producer are not pretty.\n\nBut \"American Movie'' is valuable in capturing the downside of the indie-film explosion - filmmaking as a last resort for those with utterly stalled lives. It's too bad Smith avoids confronting whether Borchardt actually has talent or vision. It isn't enough that he makes movies. Does he make good ones or bad ones? It matters.\n\nThere was another important \"American'' documentary at Sundance, although not in competition. Nine hours of \"An American Love Story,'' Jennifer Fox's upcoming PBS documentary about an interracial couple and their two daughters, were shown. I saw the first two episodes and found \"Love Story'' extraordinarily touching and insightful. This could be one of PBS's most important undertakings to date.\n\nIn case you're wondering what kind of woman would want to have sex with 251 men in 10 hours, the answer provided in \"Sex: The Annabel Chong Story'' is a very confused and unhappy one. Sometimes this sexually explicit documentary is quite moving, such as when pornactress Chong tries to console her devastated mother about her lifestyle. Other times it simply doesn't adequately address the issues it raises about Chong's sordid occupation. The film does make clear that \"Boogie Nights'' was right-on in its depressing view of the porn star's life. This is a good career to avoid.\n\nAs there is \"Sex,'' so there was death at Sundance - the world premiere of master documentarian Errol Morris' ( \"The Thin Blue Line,'' \"A Brief History of Time'') latest, \"Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchter, Jr.'' Nobody is better than Morris at using technique - differing film stocks, subjective camera angles, dramatic recreations of events, archival footage, wry humor, voice-over narration, powerful score - to make his documentaries emotional. And in \"Mr. Death,'' which Morris cautioned was not a final print, he seemingly has a perfect subject for his emotional style. Leuchter is a self-styled engineer of \"humane'' electric chairs and other capitalpunishment devices who became a spokesman for the Holocaust-denial movement. Besides \"Three Seasons,'' the best films I saw in the dramatic competition were \"Guinevere,'' \"Joe the King,'' \"Tumbleweeds'' and the comedy \"Happy, Texas.'' The worst was \"The Autumn Heart,'' a maudlin and completely unbelievable cryfest about the adult children of a divorced couple that made \"Stepmom'' look as sophisticated as \"All About Eve.''\n\n\"Guinevere'' and \"Joe the King'' shared the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award; \"Tumbleweeds'' earned actor-director Gavin O'Connor the Filmmakers Trophy. All three are coming-of-age films. \"Joe'' and \"Tumbleweeds'' are both fairly earnest, yet redeemed by generally astute, spare screenwriting and terrific acting, by young Noah Fleiss in \"Joe'' and by Janet McTeer and Kimberly Brown as the divorced on-the-run mother and troubled daughter in \"Tumbleweeds.''\n\nBut \"Guinevere,'' the directing debut from \"The Truth About Cats and Dogs'' screenwriter Audrey Wells, is several cuts above. It mixes extremely wise observations about the dynamics of a relationship between an older man and young woman with goodwill toward its characters. And it has a sense of humor that is at times as outrageously funny as anything in \"There's Something About Mary.'' In particular, the scene where Sarah Polley shocks her mean-spirited mother during a fortune cookie-reading showdown is absolutely outrageous. As the mom, Jean Smart gets to deliver one of the more bitingly revelatory movie speeches of the decade while criticizing Stephen Rea, who plays her daughter's older lover. As good as Rea is, one wonders if Wells considered first offering the role to Woody Allen.\n\n\"Happy, Texas,'' the object of the festival's most furious bidding war, is about two escaped convicts who are mistaken as gay producers of a children's talent show. When it sticks to its premise it is very funny, especially every moment that Steve Zahn is on screen as one of the convicts. But the movie keeps wandering into unproductive subplots, including a bank robbery, gun battle and vehicle chase.\n\nThe British also were well-represented at Sundance. One of the biggest British films of 1998 had its North American premieres at the festival, and it was well worth the wait. \"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels,'' billed in advance as the Brit \"Pulp Fiction'' because of its mix of extreme violence and rude humor, turns out to have an element missing from most American \"Pulp Fiction'' wannabes. It has a caper-film plot that, while terribly convoluted, ultimately is clever. Drug dealers, crime lords, gamblers and petty thieves all double-cross each other with gleeful abandon.\n\nBeyond that, writer-director Guy Ritchie gives us a kind of ska-noir film - dazzlingly edited to a rocksteady sound track with surreally intense full-frontal lighting and a palette of the most brilliant-looking bland urban colors ever seen. At times, the film has a burnished, sepia look. It also has the best slangy Brit gang-speak since \"A Clockwork Orange,'' even if Ritchie sometimes resorts to subtitles to explain it. Mike Figgis, of \"Leaving Las Vegas'' fame, brought his new \"The Loss of Sexual Innocence'' to Sundance and, fittingly, it left many at a loss. A somewhat free-floating, imagistic meditation on how little the world has changed since Adam and Eve, it is often beautifully poetic and erotic. Plus it features actors and actresses capable of nohands urination on demand. Some scenes are unforgettable, especially when a blind woman must defend her dog against mongrels and a tribe of blue-painted nomads encircles a crew of filmmakers. Sometimes, I was swept away by the grandeur of it all. But other times, it is like an extended fashion shoot with too many beautiful people. It can seem more chic than thoughtful.\n\nSome of the worst movies at the festival were British. Antonia Bird's \"Ravenous,'' a horror-comedy with allegedly serious overtones about cannibalism in the American West, is a dumb mess. Robert Carlyle as a madmancannibal sort of looks like Charles Manson, and the sound track cocomposed by Blur's Damon Albarn, is shrill and blaring. (Too bad the Fine Young Cannibals weren't available.)\n\nBut \"Ravenous'' at least had sobad-it's-good camp value. Far more loathsome was \"The War Zone,'' the directorial debut from British actor Tim Roth. This is a despairing story of incest that telegraphs its dreary bleakness from the get-go with its ominous lighting, darker-than-hell-at-night locations, and glum and repressed acting. And it was too explicit.\n\nOne ho-hum year doesn't mean Sundance has lost its potency. Things can change quickly, after all. Just last year there were such groundbreaking dramatic-competition films as \"Pi,'' \"High Art,'' \"Smoke Signals'' and \"Slam.'' So maybe next year will be just as excellent. And maybe it will bring more foreign-language American films."
