        "text": "Carmen ‘Carmy’ Berzatto (Jeremy Allen White) — Jeremy Allen White returns as our head chef Carmy Berzatto, and he’s just as stressed out as ever (if not even more). He’s perhaps best known prior to “The Bear” for starring at Lip Gallagher in “Shameless,” also set in Chicago.\n\nSydney (Ayo Edebiri) — Ayo Edebiri will once again play Sydney, Carmy’s sous chef at The Bear. She had a busy year between seasons, starring in “Bottoms” and lending her voice to Envy in “Inside Out 2.”\n\nRichie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) — Ebon Moss-Bachrach earned his first Emmy for his role on “The Bear,” and he returns in season 3 as Richie. Alongside his work on the show, he also starred in episodes of “Andor” and “Thr Dropout,” and last year landed a movie role in Jennifer Lawrence’s “No Hard Feelings.”\n\nTina (Liza Colón-Zayas) — Tina is the veteran of the kitchen, and she’s given more authority this year. Liza Colón-Zayas plays the character once again, after just starring in John Krasinski’s family film “IF.”\n\nMarcus (Lionel Boyce) — After a beloved solo episode in season two that took him to Copenhagen, Lionel Boyce returns as pastry chef Marcus in season three, fresh off losing his mother on the show. His biggest role prior to “The Bear” was the TV series “Loiter Squad.”\n\nNatalie ‘Sugar’ Berzatto (Abby Elliott) — Now that she’s part owner of The Bear, it seems we’ll be seeing even more of Carmy’s sister Nat this season. “SNL” alum Abby Elliott returns as the character.\n\nUncle Jimmy “Cicero” Kalinowski (Oliver Platt) — Oliver Platt also returns as Carmy’s Uncle, after giving him and his team the money to get The Bear off the ground. He’s played by “Chicago Med” stalwart Oliver Platt.\n\nClaire (Molly Gordon) — Fans first met Claire, Carmy’s longtime love interest, last season and almost instantly fell in love with her. She’ll return this season in a recurring capacity, played once again by “Theater Camp” star Molly Gordon.\n\nNeil Fak (Matty Matheson) — Matty Matheson was well-known in the culinary scene before “The Bear” came along, so it only makes sense that he both executive produces the show and stars in it. He plays Neil Fak.\n\nEbraheim (Edwin Lee Gibson) — Rounding out the returners is Edwin Lee Gibson as Ebraheim. Alongside Tina, he’s the other longtime vet of the kitchen. He’s appeared in several other recent series, including “Winning Time” and “Unprisoned,” among others.\n\nSammy Fak (John Cena) — The Fak family is indeed very large — so large that it apparently includes John Cena. He plays Sammy Fak, after starring in films like “Ricky Stanicky” and “Argylle” released earlier this year.\n\nFrank (Josh Hartnett) — Richie and Tiffany are well and truly done, and she’s engaged to Frank now. Frank is played by none other that beloved heartthrob Josh Hartnett, who most recently starred in “Oppenheimer” ahead of “The Bear.”\n\nDonna Berzatto (Jamie Lee Curtis) — Donna Berzatto may not be a great mom, but she does return for the birth of her grandchild. She’s once again played by “Halloween” and “Freaky Friday” star Jamie Lee Curtis.\n\nMikey Berzatto (Jon Bernthal) — Mikey is arguably the lynchpin for all of “The Bear,” so it only makes sense that he would return in more flashbacks. He’s played once more by “The Punisher” star Jon Bernthal.\n\nLuca (Will Poulter) — It appears it might be hard to stay away from “The Bear” for very long if you can help it, as Will Poulter’s Luca also returns for an episode (plus a few flashbacks) in season three. He starred as Adam Warlock in “Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3” last year, but you might also recognize him from his earlier years in “We’re the Millers.”\n\nChef Terry (Olivia Colman) — Olivia Colman also returns this season, as Chef Terry, but sadly, she brings unfortunate news about her restaurant. Still, you’ll recognize her from “Wonka,” “Heartstopper” and “Secret Invasion,” among other projects.\n\nDavid Fields (Joel McHale) — Turns out, the man who’s haunted Carmy for three seasons has a name: David Fields. He traumatized Carmy and has no regrets when they come face-to-face in real life this season. He’s once again terrifyingly played by “Community” star Joel McHale.\n\nTiffany (Gillian Jacobs) — In addition to meeting her fiancé, we also see Richie’s ex-wife Tiffany herself again, played by “Community” and “Invicible” star Gillian Jacobs.\n\nAdam Shapiro (Adam Shapiro) — Bearing his own name, Adam Shapiro plays the man who might take Sydney away from The Bear, prompting a panic attack for her as she’s faced with a choice. You’ll recognize him from “Never Have I Ever” or maybe “The Continental.”\n\nJessica (Sarah Ramos) — After bonding a bit last season, Jessica returns to have a moment with Richie in season three, signaling some potential sparks. She’s played by “Parenthood” actress Sarah Ramos.\n\nNicholas Marshall/The Computer (Brian Koppelman) — Uncle Jimmy may not want to see “The Bear” fail, but according to his financial adviser “The Computer,” it’s destined to do just that, unless costs are cut. That man is played by Brian Koppelman, who co-created Showtime’s “Billions” and wrote “Ocean’s Thirteen” and “Rounders.”"
