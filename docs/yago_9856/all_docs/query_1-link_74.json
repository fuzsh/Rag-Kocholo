        "text": "Los Angeles, CA-Sundance Institute has selected twelve projects for the annual January Screenwriters Lab, to be held January 14-19, 2011 at the Sundance Resort in Utah. This year’s group includes filmmakers from regions throughout the world, including the United States, Mexico, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. A hallmark of this year’s Lab is its diversity, with filmmakers from a variety of ethnicities and backgrounds, an almost even split of men and women, and a wide spectrum of genres that includes comedy, period, horror-tinged thriller, and classic indie drama.\n\nThe Screenwriters Lab is a five-day writers’ workshop that gives independent screenwriters the opportunity to work intensely on their feature film scripts with the support of established writers in an environment that encourages innovation and creative risk-taking. Through one-on-one story sessions, fellows engage in an artistically rigorous process that offers them indispensable lessons in craft, as well as the means to do the deep exploration needed to fully realize their material.\n\nThe projects selected for the 2011 January Screenwriters Lab are:\n\nAdelaide / Liliana Greenfield-Sanders (writer/director), U.S.A.\n\nAdelyne / Holden Abigail Osborne (writer/director), U.S.A.\n\nconfederacy / Jody Lee Lipes (co-writer/director) and Jeffrey Peixoto (co-writer), U.S.A.\n\nEyes of a Thief / Najwa Najjar (writer/director), Palestinian territories\n\nImperial Dreams / Malik Vitthal (co-writer/director) and Ismet Prcic (co-writer), U.S.A.\n\nIn What City Does It Live? / Seng Tat Liew (writer/director), Malaysia\n\nLa Raya / Yolanda Cruz (writer/director), Mexico, U.S.A.\n\nLittle Accidents / Sara Colangelo (writer/director), U.S.A.\n\nOn Evil / Carlo Mirabella-Davis (writer/director), U.S.A.\n\nProvidence / Yaelle Kayam (writer/director), Israel\n\nStem / Diane Bell (writer/director), Scotland, U.S.A.\n\nThe Western Habit / Ian Olds (co-writer/director) and Paul Felten (co-writer), U.S.A.\n\n“Our Feature Film Program’s screenwriters labs are foundations of Sundance Institute and in many ways illustrate the scope of our year-round work around the world,” said Executive Director Keri Putnam. “Many of the artists we have been privileged to work with have gone on to make brilliant films, and some of those films will make their world premieres at this year’s Sundance Film Festival.”\n\n“I’m thrilled we are supporting such a diverse group of filmmakers who are bringing audiences into worlds they know intimately and exploring contemporary issues in unexpected and challenging ways,” said Michelle Satter, Director of the Sundance Institute Feature Film Program. “These artists are pushing the envelope, delving into the personal and the political, and showcasing their robust individual voices and singular visions with work that is incredibly exciting in a wide spectrum of genres.”\n\nThe fellows will work with a distinguished group of creative advisors, including Lab Artistic Director Scott Frank, Tony Drazan, Naomi Foner, Susannah Grant, John Lee Hancock, Kasi Lemmons, Fernando Leon de Aranoa, Malia Scotch Marmo, Jessie Nelson, Scott Neustadter, Howard Rodman, Ira Sachs, Jennifer Salt, Susan Shilliday, Zach Sklar, Elena Soarez, and Tyger Williams.\n\nSix films supported by the Feature Film Program will screen as part of the Dramatic Competition at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival.
