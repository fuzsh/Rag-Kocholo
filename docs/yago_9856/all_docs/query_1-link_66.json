The history of ―Third Cinema (Solanas and Gettino 1969) is examined as a prelude to a postcolonial position on a cinema of exile. The notion of ―third space‖ in Homi Bhabha's critique of Third Cinema, ―haptic visualities‖ in Laura Marks and the ―crossroads‖ in Gloria Anzaldúa are evoked to examine ―spaces in-between‖, where the border is deterritorialized.\n\nAbstract: In traditional Vietnamese movie (before 2000), rural and urban areas are often depicted by cinematic stereotypes as absolutely separated and differentiated territories. Also, people living in these two spaces are often represented by contrasted traits, for example, rural people are naïve, while urban people are sophisticated or sometimes, disrupted. But in contemporary Vietnamese cinema, rural and urban areas have been \"de-territorialized\". The distinctions between the two spaces have been blurred, especially in the films made by young directors. Vietnamese films which are made in recent years show clearly that the personality of people are not sharply characterized according to their origin, rural or urban area, but are often in a very complex state. Often the characters have a mixed personality of rural and urban type. This paper approaches Phan Dang Di's films as typical examples to present the ideas of rural-urban boundaries in urbanization process and the de-territorialization trend in contemporary Vietnamese movie.\n\nIn this class, we will take a critical look at the treatment of societal issues in art as well as art education. Topics will include art as an anti-bias tool, the inclusive potential of art, and art as a political statement. In particular, we will critically look at some media artifacts (namely films) to see how the places people call home and their social relations and identities in those spaces are being re-presented. We will develop critical literacy tools to understand the role that the politics of space plays in these media artifacts, and how relationships of power are distributed in relation to places. We will reveal the spatial representations of people and places, the definitions of identity provided through symbolic spatial references, and the relational nature of dynamic social practices that are at times fixed by false representations. In other words, we will try to tease out how places and people are re-presented in films, in terms of their national, ethnic and gendered identities. In turn, we will provide our own written cultural critiques and testimonies of how we would like to see our own spaces re-presented by the media.\n\nThis article considers state-funded films in contemporary Vietnam and the legacy of the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam), which fell to communist forces in 1975. From a close reading of films produced and funded by the communist government on the thirtieth anniversary of the end of the war, the article deciphers complicated meanings about national identity, history, and gender. In this new political economic context, the possibilities for remembering the southern regime—including its people and veterans—remains open and closed. Through the framework of heteroglossia of history, the co-presence of competing viewpoints within cinematic texts points to the complexity of an ever-changing Vietnam.\n\nSpatial fixing was an integral part of maintaining imperial power structures throughout the colonial period, and like other discourses, it later found itself reproduced in cinema. As such, the physical and mental use of space has become key to the dissemination of ideological messages in many films. Confronting this tendency, this study applies theories of postcolonialism to selected examples of contemporary Hollywood film to examine how far it reconstructs traditional binaries of space. This investigation finds that despite attempts to disseminate more culturally sensitive and globally-minded portrayals of the Other, space remains particularly problematic. It also remains vital to storytelling narratives of race, gender, class and society in consideration of the film cases analysed in this study. While Fanonian notions of space continue to permeate cinema—with Total Recall and Avatar in particular drawing upon stereotypical motifs, it is possible to observe developments upon these ...\n\nHow can film become a tool of ‘conservation of remembrance’ and be a part of rescuing and rebuilding of cultural and communal memories? Taking a cue from recent ecologically oriented debate on modernity, this paper will focus on memories through films on rural localities that intently counter the trauma of urban migration and dislocation in and around local ‘dwellings.’ By looking at recent Chinese films like Dai Sijie’s Little Chinese Seamstress and Huo Jianqi’s Postmen in the Mountains, I discuss the directors’ emotive re-imaging of local and folk architecture and landmarks so as to dispel feelings of displacement resulted from frenzied urban booming, and posit an emotive ‘embedding’ linking urban migrants to their nostalgic home dwellings. These visual narratives consciously negotiate over the emotive terrains between memoirs of local landscape and nagging issues of poverty and backwardness, between tourist exoticism and ‘emotion pictures,’ between progress and preservation, and between the lure of global consumer culture and the beckoning of local and nascent ‘dwellings.’\n\nThe concept of nomadism - which stems from Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari and evolves into feminist and postcolonial critiques - provides an analytical framework to address the undetermined, multifaceted portrayal of tribal and diasporic women in the cinema of Trinh T.
