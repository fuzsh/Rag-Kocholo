So I am asking the list for recommendations of movies related to Vietnamese history that have proven pedagogically effective. I am hoping to find movies for these three (broadly defined) categories:\n\n1) movies for the colonial period and earlier\n\n2) movies for the Vietnam War period\n\n3) movies for post-war and contemporary Vietnam\n\nI know there are quite a number of movies for the Vietnam War period and contemporary Vietnam, but I haven't been able to identify a single film for the colonial period or earlier (as you can easily do for, say, Chinese history). Also, I am hoping for more Vietnam-centered movies on the war period. I am teaching in South Asia, and I sometimes find that teaching materials that might make sense to an American audience is just baffling to them because they have not had significant cultural exposure to American narratives about history.\n\nAny suggestions would be much appreciated!\n\nCheers,\n\nNu-Anh Tran\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nAsian University for Women\n\n----------\n\nFrom: John Whitmore\n\nDate: Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 9:26 AM\n\nTo: Nu-Anh Tran <tran_n_a@yahoo.com>, Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nI think that you will find 'Sad Song for Yellow Skin' (from the Trinh Cong Son song, should be Golden Skin Da Vang) interesting.

Looks at the past with focus on the present, and on those who acted to rescue people from the massacre. Students find it gives lots to think about, for history, and for their own lives. Tran Van Thuy, director; 31 min.\n\n\"Story from the Corner of a Park\" -- also Tran Van Thuy. A meditative look at a family dealing with the consequences of war, especially Agent Orange. 45 min\n\n\"Where War Has Passed\" -- Vu Le My and Luong Duc -- A more snapshot view of many families, north and south, dealing with these consequences. 21 min.\n\n\"Deadly Debris\" -- Vu Le My and Luong Duc -- a spin off of the previous film -- the consequences of UXO's in one particular village. 27 min.\n\nI also use Dang Nhat Minh's \"Nostalgia for the Countryside\" to open up discussion of many different themes, and, again, the students (who are often just a year or two older than the main character) find it gives them lots to think about.\n\nI hope someone can help us with something from the French colonial period.\n\nDiane\n\n----------\n\nFrom: John Whitmore\n\nDate: Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 10:49 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nDiane - I'm not sure.

It generally startles them, raising many good questions about the past and the present and collaborations and representations. I always tell them about Dang Nhat Minh's expression of disgust when I asked him what he thought about the Rebel -- meaningful to them, because often they fall in love with \"Nostalgia...\"\n\nThe Lover? -- I'd love to hear thoughts on how you would compare it's use to \"Indochine\" or \"Quiet American\" (again, contrasting the ends of the 1958 version, the book, and the 2002 version makes for interesting discussion) -- and, again, that's why I'm hoping someone out there has a better idea.\n\ndf\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Quang Van\n\nDate: Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 11:00 AM\n\nTo: Nu-Anh Tran <tran_n_a@yahoo.com>, Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nDear Nu-Anh,\n\nOne of my favorite movies is Canh Dong Hoang/The Abandoned Field (Nguyen Hong Sen, 1979).

Other movies include the Wharf of Widows, \"Land of Sorrows\"/\"Dat Kho\" (Starring Trinh Cong Son), Chung Toi Muon Song/We Want to Live (RSVN). Heaven and Earth (Oliver Stone) is also a great one.

This film was shot with a Vietnamese crew and cast, but filmed in Hong Kong. It was produced in 1937 and the story concerned a psychoanalyst and a serial killer named Hung. Using hypnosis the analyst induces Hung to describe a series of murders that he has committed: Hung has killed a moneylender, a bar owner, a quack doctor, and a vagabond. Having discovered that her boyfriend was among Hung's victims, the psychoanalyst's daughter stabs him with a knife at the conclusion of the film.\n\nHope this helps for at least a bit of background. Prior to this French companies had filmed in VN for scenic backdrops, and had apparently shot a version of the Tale of Kieu, but this was the first film that could probably be called \"Vietnamese.\"\n\nGeorge\n\n_______________________________\n\nGeorge Dutton\n\nVice Chair and Associate Professor\n\nUCLA Department of Asian Languages and Cultures\n\n290 Royce Hall\n\nBox 951540\n\nLos Angeles, CA 90095-1540\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Cari Coe\n\nDate: Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 11:18 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nI \"think\" I just found the full-version online:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22jZYveuA0g\n\n--\n\nCari An Coe, Ph.D.\n\nAssistant Professor\n\nDepartment of International Affairs, MSC 36\n\nLewis & Clark College\n\n0615 SW Palatine Hill Road\n\nPortland, OR 97219\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Nhu Miller\n\nDate: Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 11:23 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nhttp://www.nfb.ca/film/sad-song-of-yellow-skin\n\nStill one of the great VN documentaries....\n\nT.T.

The film also addresses religion in an interesting, if incidental, manner. Tran Van Thuy directed. I have used this film in my classes, for sessions that deal with war legacy issues, and students never fail to be informed and moved by it. Susan Hammond would be a good source of information on how to obtain a DVD, and may even have extra copies (I got mine from her).\n\nBest,\n\nCatharin\n\nCatharin Dalpino\n\nWarburg Professor of International Relations, Simmons College\n\nVisiting Scholar in Southeast Asian Studies\n\nJohns Hopkins-SAIS\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Minh Tran\n\nDate: Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 8:08 PM\n\nTo: catharindalpino@earthlink.net, Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nA period piece is both rare and essential. There are only a few films that actually contain subtitle for the American students as mentioned above. More modern or post-war films are plentiful yet differentiate by the theme of the movie. Here are some:\n\nThe Scent of Green Papayas, with minimum dialogues and almost entirely shot on a soundstage in Paris, gave life to the period. Buffalo Boy is set in the 1940s Ca Mau about a coming-of-age teenage and his journey through life. It shows light into the life under colonial poverty. My favorite is, of course, Ð?t Phuong Nam. I am unsure if there is a subtitle version. All three of these have something in common.\n\nMinh Huynh Tran\n\nPhD Student\n\nUniversity of the West\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Tai, Hue-Tam\n\nDate: Fri, Dec 2, 2011 at 8:50 PM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nI would not suggest using The Scent of Green Papayas. It gives a quite erroneous picture of Vietnamese culture. ditto La Verticale de l'Ete. I also have reservations about Indochine.\n\nFor the colonial period, Judith Henchy's suggestion of the Gaumont Pathe collection is excellent.\n\nBuffalo Boy is a much better representation of Vietnamese life in the early or mid 20th century and could be very usefully paired with the more recent Canh Dong Vo Tan which deals with a duck farming family in the midst of the Avian Flu crisis.\n\nMy students have liked both Nostalgia for the Countryside and When the Tenth Month Comes.\n\nThe Sound of Violins in My Lai similarly could be paired with the PBS documentary on My Lai.\n\nKaren Turner's Hidden Warriors provides a very interesting look at the women who volunteered to work on the Ho Chi Minh Trail.\n\nHue Tam Ho Tai\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Carl Robinson\n\nDate: Sat, Dec 3, 2011 at 1:15 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nI certainly would not rpt not recommend Indochine unless you're trying to generate tourism to Vietnam with its wide shots over Ha Long Bay. I'm convinced the film not only kicked off tourism, now a real glut of same, to the Bay and also made adopting a cute little Vietnamese orphan a very trendy thing in France in the late 90's. But more than that, the story just doesn't ring true.\n\nDo you seriously think the daughter of a Hue mandarin would be turned over to a single French woman, and who also runs a rubber plantation, and when she grows up falls head-over-heels with a French Navy officer with whom she runs away and their story becomes the stuff of \"shadow plays\" all over Vietnam's then-revolutionary zones? She certainly wouldn't be regarded a heroine to them, not only for her sell-out background but joining up in an affair with a foreigner. I know the French weren't the coolest colonialists but the portrayal of them was certainly a bit over the top. No stars from me!\n\nON the other hand, the 2001-remake of The Quiet American, on which I'll modestly admit to playing the 'production advisor,' isn't too bad although the Australian film director Philip Noyce makes a critical change to Graham Greene's original story when he blames that massacre at Phat Diem on the \"third force\" rather than the Viet Minh who were using it as a form of terror against the northern Catholics, both in the novel and in real life. (The opium smoking scenes are all mine though and I also played Michael Caine's \"hand double\".) Not perfect but regarded as a much closer rendering of the novel than the first one.\n\nWhatever film(s) you do show to your wide-eyed students will need a caveat or two to explain the \"slant\" and point of view being taken, especially by the current regime. Every film or television production needs government approval, of course, and I'm still waiting for a truly genuine film out of Vietnam. The novel Sorrow of War would come up best -- whoever ends up making that into a movie.\n\nBest,\n\nCarl Robinson\n\nFormer AP Correspondent, Saigon 1968-75.\n\n----------\n\nFrom: IVCE\n\nDate: Sat, Dec 3, 2011 at 4:29 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nDear List,\n\nWe have been showing the contemporary Vietnamese films at the colleges in U.S since 2003.

The setting is the Mekong Delta in the 1940s. During the flooding season, Kim is charged with taking his family's prized pair of buffaloes to higher ground to find grass. Along the way, Kim is transformed into adulthood as he experiences human nature at its best and its worst. The epic landscapes and the elemental sounds of the movie are, in itself, a work of beauty that can be appreciated by all!\n\nThe Story of Pao: The story centers on a young girl, Pao, living in a mountainous area on a journey to discover her family's past and her own future. Recalling memories of marriage and the emotional life of her parents, the story deftly develops the concept of love from different points of view, both traditional and modern. The interaction between the people in the movie is told in a very moving and vivid manner. Secret desires, pent up feelings, and internal emotions come to light in different situations that make the already romantic story even more attractive. The movie's storyline is further accentuated by its setting: the magnificent mountain ranges of Northwest Vietnam that are engulfed year-round by an immense veil of fog. This movie is not only an honest and moving picture of a family's emotional life but it also provides an intimate look at what Vietnam is all about.\n\nLiving in Fear: Set in 1975 just after the South-North unification, Bui Thac Chuyen's debut film portrays the exceptional life force of Vietnamese people who survive in their devastated land. The new land allotted to Tai, a former soldier of the defeated side, is covered with unexploded bombs and landmines. Tai has to support two families, for he has committed bigamy during the war. And to earn a living, he has no choice but to clear landmines and sell them to the black market...From this dangerous work, Tai draws a truth for his life: A mine is dangerous only when it is stepped on. When being unearthed, it is no different from a stone.\n\nThe White Silk Dress: This film depicts the life story of a very poor family in Hoi An and the struggle they endure because of their circumstances. It is an unforgettable story filled with an emotional romance embedded in traditional cultural. It deals with foreboding crises and tremendous emotional growth spanning twelve years in the lives of four characters in the sixties. They have nothing but dreams. These are simple dreams, but in the world of violence and madness, we find dreams often destroyed. But above all, the story of The White Silk Dress is a symbol of love, hope, sacrifice, and fate all tied together. It is a story of the inspiring triumph of sacrifice and the healing power of love.\n\nThe Little Heart: Somewhere far away in the heart of Central Vietnam, there stands a remote village dusting itself against the surrounding hundreds of sand dunes and the feelings of seclusion and hopelessness. Many of its teens find themselves dreaming of leaving this sad village, thirsting for an exciting city life with colors and opportunities. Only a few of these dreamers actually make it to the city of Saigon. 17-year-old Mai considers herself \"lucky\", leaving behind all her struggles, all her memories, all her loved ones, including her dear teenage boyfriend, Den, who is a year older. She thought she had found a very promising career in embroidery work with some special arrangements from a broker. Unfortunately, life is not as simple as that. She soon realizes that she had fallen into a very subtle web of brothel operations. And in this chaotic, strange city with no one to turn to, she surrenders to prostitution and eventually the awful disease that comes with that life.\n\nThe Moon at the bottom of the Well: Hanh, a high school teacher in Hue, Vietnam, and her husband, Phuong, the school's principal, share a seemingly peaceful and happy life. Though she loves her husband deeply, there is one thing she is unable to give him - a child. Hanh thus facilitates an arrangement for her husband to have a child with another woman. The surrogate pregnancy must be concealed or they will be subject to public scorn. Unfortunately, the secret gets disclosed and jeopardizes Phuong's career. To protect her husband, Hanh sacrifices their marriage, only to find out later he is not worthy of her love. Despairing, Hanh never expects to find happiness again, but nevertheless stumbles on it in the most unexpected place: the underworld.\n\nDon’t Burn It: The film \"Don’t Burn it\" is the story of a female doctor, Dang Thuy Tram, from Hanoi. During the war, she headed an infirmary in a war-ravaged area where, according to her diary, \"death can be easier than having a meal.\" Her diary documents her love for people, her burning longings for her family and relatives, and her dreams about peace, which have touched the heart of an American soldier on the opposing side. This war diary has the strength to bring people of different colors and political viewpoints closer. It is a rarity. If one can call this film propaganda, it must be propaganda about the love among human beings. I think on this earth wherever there is hatred and killing, such propaganda is still necessary.\n\nFloating Lives: Set in the exquisitely beautiful Mekong Delta of Vietnam, the film tells the story of Mr. Vo and his daughter Nuong and his son Dien. Vo, a man wounded by his wife’s infidelity, has burned down his house and all his memories of the past. He has restarted his life with his two children, living a nomadic existence on a boat among the labyrinthine canals of the Mekong. He is an exile not because of the war- now only a distant memory in Vietnam-but from the modern life and materialism that he sees as the cause of his wife’s giving in to the temptations of self-indulgence. Twisted and made bitter by her betrayal, Vo takes revenge by using his attractive looks to cruelly abuse all women who fall in love with him, and at times even the daughter who looks more and more like her mother as she grows up. Vo becomes a man who cannot see love, while his son and daughter become emotionally twisted, inheriting their father’s hatred, distrust and coldness. It is only when the children rescue Suong, a prostitute, from being beaten by a mob of outraged women and, in spite of their father, take her into their life and form a surrogate family around her, that Suong’s physical and spiritual healing allows the children-and perhaps their father-to have their own healing, and their own reconciliation with love.\n\nThe Mother’s Heart: Lan and her daughter Thu live in a lowland area in the middle of the Red river delta. Their typical day's work includes going to the Long Bien Market very early in the morning to buy wholesale groceries and resell them back in a local market later during the day. Thu’s mother falls in love with a driver, a relation that has no future. However, she loves him so much that she does not make wise decisions and thus her business is operating at a loss. Thu tries to help her mother to make both ends meet. She longs for her mother’s affection and in order to make up for such a loss of love from her mother, she devotes her affection to a close classmate, who she wants to be her son. Like Thu, Dang lacks mother’s love as he is an orphan. With a strong personality, sense of responsibility, and love, Thu successfully convinces Dang to consider her as his mother with the best heart.\n\nJourney From The Fall: Ham Tran’s impressive feature debut is a potent addition to the body of Vietnam War movies, but from a distinctively Vietnamese-American viewpoint. Both stomach churning and hypnotically enthralling, the film skillfully jumps back and forth in time, as it follows the struggles of Long Nguyen and his family after the fall of Saigon. Long is captured and imprisoned in a series of re-education camps, while his family tries to flee to the US. After the family arrives in the US, they still have to cope with racism and the struggle for survival. Yet the film never descends into desolate bleakness. Rather it will reinforce your faith in the potential of human beings to survive and thrive against the worst odds.\n\nLetter From Dong Van, Dong Van is a district 150 kilometers from Ha Giang, towering 1,200 meters above the sea level, making the dome of the entire country. The largest ethnic group here is the H’mong. Their hamlets scatter on high mountain slopes. When I first came here, I sometimes asked myself why the H’mong people had chosen to build their lives on such brutal lands. Their choice is still a mystery to me.\n\nWe Apologize To You. A poor bricklayer, Tong Phuoc Phuc, from Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa Province, joins a group of “Volunteers” to collect dead fetuses and bodies of children, unclaimed, to bury them in a cemetery on top of a small hill, called Hon Thom, in the village of Xuan Ngoc, Vinh Ngoc District, Khanh Hoa Province. The bricklayer has found a few surviving children, abandoned by their parents, brought them home and cares for them, hoping that their parents would come look for them one day and send them to schools.\n\nWhat we see and what can’t see: (1) The Bridge: the Hien Luong bridge represents a part of the recent history of Vietnam, a symbol of separation and happiness, a twisting and turning of two individuals, and signifies on its body more than just one semantic connotation. Still a permanent anxiety of a human life, and of the creativity of artists: there underlies thoughts and pains of a past full of sufferings, and the blood and tears of the younger generations with a country of theirs full of hardship which they have never experienced, or just a fortune to hear, read or to be told about, (2) Sinh Village: Sinh, the Mud Village, leaning its shadow on the Perfume River, was founded sometimes in the XVth Century. It was not only a bunting merchant river port neighboring the City of Hue, but also a cultural center of the old kingdom. Nobody knows when the handicraft of religious painting became the famous center for the people living far and near. Today, however, the Mud Village paintings are on the verge of losing its traditional characters. (3) Kieu Thai Vuong's Tomb. Kieu Thai Vuong is the reign name of Emperor Nguyen Phuc Hong Cai (1845-1876), who fathered three successive Emperors: Emperor Reign of Kien Phuc (1883-1884), Emperor Reign of Ham Nghi (1884-1885) and Emperor Reign of Dong Khanh (1886-1888). Emperor Dong Khanh reigned for three year and passed away when he was just 25. Right after his coronation, Emperor Dong Khanh ordered the building of the mausoleum called Truy Tu, next to the tomb of his father. The Truy Tumausoleum broke the ground in February 1888, and was basically completed by October that year. Emperor Dong Khanh led the ceremony of moving the altar of Kieu Thai Vuong to the mausoleum.\n\nMourners of Hire. Nobody knows when it came to life. >From the time immemorial in the northern part of Vietnam, particularly in the country side there appeared an odd profession, in the context of a growing social movement of lavish funerals and festivities. The professional mourners for hire were infamously named “vultures feasting on rotten carcasses.” Today, after so many centuries of refinement it becomes more sophisticated as our society becomes more civilized. Mourners for hire in Vietnam seemed nowhere to be found for a long while, but now reemerge and appear everywhere under a multidimensional moralistic social character in front of the cameras of the film director.\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Lan Duong\n\nDate: Sat, Dec 3, 2011 at 8:01 AM\n\nTo: Nu-Anh Tran <tran_n_a@yahoo.com>, Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nhi Nu-Anh,\n\nI teach a course on Vietnamese and Overseas Vietnamese Cinema and the films I use broadly cover the periods and themes you list below.\n\nI begin with Abandoned Fields, and continue with When the Tenth Month Comes, Nostalgia for the Countryside, The Deserted Valley, Long-Legged Girls, Cyclo, Three Seasons, Journey from the Fall, and The Rebel.\n\nThe films are taught roughly in chronological order (as this may be easier for students to follow) and touch upon many different issues -- war, postwar, Doi Moi, ethnic minority representation, modernity, tradition, gender, sexuality, immigration, and the diaspora. With the Rebel, we return to questions of colonialism and collaboration (not just political but also in terms of the contemporary production of film).\n\nAs to your questions on colonialism, there are some feature-length films that deal with this as a fictional historical setting: Me Thao...Thoi Vang Bong, Ao Lua Ha Dong, Chung Mot Dong Song, and The Rebel.\n\nAnd as Thu-Huong Nguyen-Vo mentioned, there are some colonial 1-minute shorts that can be found on the web and via the Lumiere Brothers First Films DVD compilation (which includes Gabriel Veyre's great camerawork).\n\nFor VN war films, there are Em Be Ha Noi, Warrior: Who Are You?, Chung Toi Muon Song, Chim Vang Khuyen, Me Khi Vang Nha, and Dung Dot (though this film has just come out and I'm not sure if there are any copies to purchase).\n\nMany of these films I bought in VNS American DVD Shops (like Long-Legged Girls) and some through IVC (like Nostalgia). I have also bought films in VNS DVD shops, where films like Em Be Ha Noi has been refurbished and is now being bought and sold on the streets. In Sai Gon, I have also found films like Ao Lua Ha Dong and Deserted Valley.\n\nHope this helps and good luck with the course.\n\nLan\n\nLan Duong, Assistant Professor\n\nDepartment of Media and Cultural Studies\n\nCHASS Interdisciplinary Building, Rm 3141\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Lan Duong\n\nDate: Sat, Dec 3, 2011 at 8:02 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nhi George,\n\nDo you know where I can screen or get a copy of \"Canh Dong Ma\"?

The head-scratcher for me was how the film could suggest that General Th? (aka “The Third Force”) could have been responsible for the massacre in Phát Diêm. General Th?’s “force” was strictly regional, based in Tây Ninh, worlds away from the Red River delta.\n\nHowever, the movie is faithful to Greene in not blaming the massacre on the Viet Minh. In the novel, the narrator says that the bodies in the canal were civilians “caught in the cross-fire.” (Earlier, a priest had told him that the “parachutists caught them in a cross-fire.”) This was a scene based on Greene’s reportage—I recall reading in one of his other writings that he was not at all sure who the victims were or how they had been killed.\n\nIn defense of Indochine, which is frequently criticized on historical grounds, it had a direct, powerful emotional impact on me, for reasons too deep for me to fully understand. Certainly it is not meant to be historically accurate or even plausible. When we enter the endless stretch of emerald karsts, it becomes clear that it is morphing into a fairy-tale that recalls T? Th?c’s sojourn in the Bích Ðào grotto. For me, the movie captured perfectly the sorrow of alienation— of partition—in recent Vietnamese history. But maybe it’s just me.\n\n:: Mike High\n\n????\n\nGreat Falls, VA\n\nUSA\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Tai, Hue-Tam\n\nDate: Sat, Dec 3, 2011 at 8:46 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nI well remember Mark Bradley telling me that he'd gotten into an argument with a historian of Great Britain with no pretension to familiarity with Asia or Asian history but who nonetheless insisted quite heatedly that Indochine was an authentic rendition of Vietnamese colonial history. it was not a pleasant experience.\n\nYes, the scenery was enchanting. In fact, when I escorted a group of Harvard alumni in 1993' the French woman who'd been hired by the travel agency kept on pointing out various sites among the Nguyen imperial tombs and saying \"this is where a particular scene\" in Indochine was shot; I wanted to talk about the history of the site and of the emperors buried there and the rebellion that took place in 1866. Back in Hanoi, she was more interested in showing the group where Catherine Deneuve bought her morning croissants than in the history of the city.\n\nI am glad that Indochine has stopped being such a reference point!\n\nI do like the new Quiet American despite the liberties mentioned by others ( I found that many of my students miss the connection between the massacre in Phat Diem and General The). I wonder whether this was to counterbalance the earlier, heavily anti-communist version. I usually assign the novel both to stimulate discussion of US war aims and to provide a good sense of what Saigon was like in 1955.\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Nhu Miller\n\nDate: Sat, Dec 3, 2011 at 10:07 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nA message from Gerry Herman in response to what films are available\n\nfrom the Ha noi Cinematheque:\n\n//We do not have DVD of STORY FROM A CORNER OF THE PARK.\n\n(Nhu: This is an exceptionally haunting movie.

One reason would simply be to please the current government of Vietnam (which issued a permit for shooting in Vietnam) which would not want documentation of Viet Minh atrocities.\n\nAnother reason goes back to the filming of the earlier John Manchiewitz 1958 version, which was filmed on location in Tay Ninh.\n\nOn February 25, 1957, in an article tellingly titled “The Disquieted Americans” Time reported that when Machiewitz tried to film “The Quiet American” (with a re-written ending that completely justified the then escalating American military presence in Vietnam) in Tay Ninh, he was initially well received and able to film the huge ceremony dedicated to the Mother Goddess. But then the filming was disrupted by demonstrations asking for the return of the exiled Ho Phap. The Ho Phap here was a reference to the Caodai leader Pham Cong Tac (whose title actually means \"Head Spirit Medium\", a position which was never identified as the “Pope”, in spite of many English mis-translations along those lines). Ngo Dinh Diem's forces were sent to arrest Pham Cong Tac in 1955, but he fled to Cambodia. If you look at the scenes shot in Tay Ninh (now available in the DVD of the 1958 film, and excerpted in my documentary \"The Left Eye of God\") you can see the ceremony turning into a political demonstration, and the filmmakers did not bother to edit out scenes of people carrying banners protesting the exile of their leader.\n\nThe official website for the 2001 \"Quiet American\" says that the scenes that were set in Tay Ninh were filmed in northern Vietnam because the area was more \"scenic\", but it seems more likely that the government did not want the scenes to be filmed in Tay Ninh for political reasons, perhaps fearing another demonstration.\n\nIn Greene's 1952 article in Paris Match \"Indochina: France's Crown of Thorns\", he clearly describes the massacre at Phat Diem as a conflict between the French and the Viet Minh. He also acknowledges that the story of his almost ambush (repeated in \"The Quiet American\") concerned Hoa Hoa forces, not Caodaists. Amazingly, in this Paris Match article, Graham Greene argues that only Catholicism could beat Communism in Vietnam.\n\nJanet Hoskins\n\nProfessor of Anthropology, University of Southern California\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Nhu Miller\n\nDate: Mon, Dec 5, 2011 at 8:57 AM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz is the correct spelling.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\n//In 1958, Mankiewicz directedThe Quiet American, an adaptation ofGraham Greene's 1955novel about the seed of American military involvement in what would become theVietnam War. Mankiewicz, under career pressure from the climate ofanti-Communism and theHollywood blacklist, distorted the message of Greene's book, changing major parts of the story to appeal to anationalistic audience. A cautionary tale about America's blind support for \"anti-Communists\" was turned into, according to Greene, a \"propaganda film for America\".[8]//\n\nThis sounds right. Greene was no fan of U.S. role in Viet Nam and elsewhere.\n\nT.T.

A point left out of the review (due to word limits) is that the film shows a Catholic priest in the cemetery, a Buddhist monk performing a ritual, and also a young couple (unmarried?—not sure) visiting the cemetery.\n\nI was emotionally very moved by this film, and hope that if other list members view it they’ll post to the list about it. I’d also like to second Lan Duong’s comments about the lack of voice of the women in the film—still, maybe they chose to appear silent.

Thanks also to Thang for posting the very useful list of films that IVCE has handled.\n\nI am fascinated by what I take to be a main point of the film, i.e. that abortions are the consequences of pre-marital sex, and that this phenomenon is associated with neo-liberalism.\n\nMy understanding, from reading Tinne Gammeltoft's work, is that abortions are/have been widely used as a method of birth control.\n\nI am also struck by the references to catholicism in many of the films, Tran van Thuy Cau Chuyen Tu Te and A Story from the Corner of the Park and this film.\n\nFinally, rituals for miscarried/aborted fetuses have become more common in the last decade or so. This may be due to growing awareness about debates over the meaning of life and personhood.\n\nHue-Tam Ho Tai\n\n----------\n\nFrom: <sdenney@library.berkeley.edu>\n\nDate: Mon, Dec 5, 2011 at 1:07 PM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nI have not followed all of this thread so maybe these films have already\n\nbeen mentioned. I am not saying they necessarily belong on a recommended\n\nlist but might be worthy of discussion:\n\nJourney from the Fall. Produced a few years ago by a Vietnamese American\n\nfilmmaker. The focus begins with life for some prisoners in a post-75\n\nreeducation camp and then to difficulties of a Vietnamese family in\n\nsouthern California in the late 70s.\n\nBoat People. This film was produced by a Hong Kong director, about a group\n\nof people escaping Vietnam.\n\nSad Song of Yellow Skin. I remember seeing this film in the early 70s at\n\nmy college. It was a documentary focusing on South Vietnam from an\n\nanti-war perspective.\n\nSteve Denney\n\nlibrary assistant\n\nUC Berkeley\n\n----------\n\nFrom: Margaret B. Bodemer\n\nDate: Mon, Dec 5, 2011 at 7:48 PM\n\nTo: vsg@u.washington.edu\n\nSteve, and others watching this great thread on films -\n\nThanks for the notice that The Story of Kindness / Cau chuyen tu te, is on Youtube - amazing. I always remember it as \"How to Behave\" but whatever we call it, this is one of those films that really drew me in as a student. Watching it as an undergraduate in Christoph Giebel's seminar on Vietnamese memoirs had a huge impact on me and directed my future studies. I will never forget that film! I do remember that it took a while to really figure out what the filmmakers were saying, and what the context was - definitely one that needs discussion for anyone showing it to students without much background. It is a very interesting \"insider's view\" but has to be worked at (at least in my experience).\n\nCheers,\n\nMaggie Bodemer\n\n----------\n\nFrom: peter hansen\n\nDate: Mon, Dec 5, 2011 at 8:41 PM\n\nTo: Vietnam Studies Group <vsg@u.washington.edu>\n\nThanks,\n\nIt had a profound influence on me too (it was called 'Chuyen Tu Te - A Story of Kindness' here in Australia. I remember showing it to a class of seminarians, in Vietnamese but with subtitles, on a Sunday morning. I think they had had a rough night, because they all fell asleep, to my great annoyance.\n\nI have also had the great fortune to meet the Franciscans sisters at the leprosarium at Quy Hoa, near Quy Nhon, who were one of the subjects of the film. They, too, had a profound influence on me.\n\nPeter Hansen\n\nex-Catholic Theological College,\n\nMelbourne\n\nAustralia"
