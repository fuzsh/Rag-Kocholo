        "text": "Sharan Sklar has been named the head of Blow Up Pictures, the new division of Gotham-based Open City Films that produces digital films for theatrical release.\n\nFor the last four years, Sklar has been director of the Independent Feature Project’s Independent Feature Film Market.\n\nIn addition to the IFFM, Sklar ran the IFP’s “No Borders” co-production market as well as the nonprofit org’s sidebar of American indie film at the European Film Market in Berlin.\n\n“Sharan’s work as director of the IFFM has put her at the center of new independent film and made her our immediate first choice,” said Jason Kliot, who runs Open City with Joana Vicente.\n\nOpen City produced Tony Bui’s debut feature film “Three Seasons,” which became the first film in the history of the Sundance Film Festival to win both the grand jury prize and the audience award in the dramatic competition.\n\n“Seasons,” which is being distributed by October Films, is screening in competition at the Berlin Film Festival, which began Feb. 10 and runs through Feb. 21.\n\nOpen City is currently producing Kris Isacsson’s “Down to You” starring Freddie Prinze Jr. for Miramax."
