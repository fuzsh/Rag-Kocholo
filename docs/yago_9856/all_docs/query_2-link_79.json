        "text": "South Park is one of the longest-running adult cartoons on TV, but co-creator Trey Parker wishes he could delete these three “embarrassing” seasons.\n\nBack in August 1997, the first ever episode of Trey Parker and Matt Stone’s South Park aired on Comedy Central. Initially a low-budget, crudely animated series, it gained attention for its irreverent humor and willingness to tackle controversial topics.\n\nAs its audience matured, so too did South Park, evolving its animation quality and storytelling techniques. While the early seasons focused more on shock humor and explicit content, the show gradually incorporated more sophisticated satire and social commentary.\n\nNever one to shy away from controversial topics, South Park has maintained a dedicated and diverse fanbase – but there are three seasons Parker wishes he could wipe from existence.\n\nSouth Park creator wishes he could delete three “embarrassing” seasons\n\nThe creators previously revealed that their priorities have changed over the years, and so too have their comedic tastes. In fact, Parker wishes he could delete the first three seasons of South Park, describing them as “embarrassing.”\n\nAccording to an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Parker said: “If I had to permanently erase anything from the library, it would basically be anything before season 4. It’s just embarrassing to watch. OK, we were, like, 26, 27. But it’s like, ‘Really?’ We thought that was funny? We thought that was well-written? Oh my God, this is terrible.”\n\nThere is a definite tonal shift in South Park, having gone from toilet humor and vulgar jokes to a more sophisticated (albeit ridiculous) social commentary. The latest special – ‘South Park (Not Suitable for Children)’ – takes aim at OnlyFans and influencers (including the Prime craze).\n\nBut you could argue that South Park needed those first few seasons to get where it is today. And, as Parker himself previously said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, their priorities have changed.\n\n“We care about different things today,” he told the outlet. “First, we were friends f*cking around, trying to get laid, breaking into Hollywood, sleeping on couches. Now Matt is married, and I’ve got a little family.”"
