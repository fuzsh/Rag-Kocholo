The series stars Elle Fanning as Catherine and Nicholas Hoult as Emperor Peter III and Peter's body double Yemelyan Pugachev.\n\nThe Great was created, and is mostly written, by Australian playwright and screenwriter Tony McNamara, based on his 2008 play of the same name.[1] The series does not aim for historical accuracy, and was described by Hulu as \"anti-historical\".[2]\n\nAll ten episodes of the first season were released on Hulu on May 15, 2020. In July 2020, it was renewed for a second season which premiered on November 19, 2021.[4][5] In January 2022, the series was renewed for a third season which premiered on May 12, 2023.[6][7] The first season received mostly positive reviews, while the second and third seasons received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its directing, writing, humor, costumes, and cast performances (particularly those of Fanning and Hoult). It has received numerous accolades, including seven Primetime Emmy Awards nominations, with both Fanning and Hoult being nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress and Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, respectively, in 2022. In August 2023, Hulu announced the series' third season had been its last.[8]\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Great is a historical and satirical black comedy-drama about the rise of Catherine the Great from outsider to the longest-reigning female ruler in Russia's history. The series is highly fictionalized and portrays Catherine in her youth and marriage to Emperor Peter III of Russia, focusing on the plot to kill her depraved and dangerous husband.\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\n= Main cast (credited)\n\n= Recurring cast (3+)\n\n= Guest cast (1–2)\n\nActor Character Seasons 1 2 3 Main cast Elle Fanning Catherine the Great Main Nicholas Hoult Peter III of Russia Main Yemelyan Pugachev Does not appear Recurring Phoebe Fox Marial Brezhnev Main Sacha Dhawan Count Orlo Main Main[a] Charity Wakefield Georgina Dymov Main Gwilym Lee Grigor Dymov Main Adam Godley Archbishop \"Archie\" Samsa Main Douglas Hodge General Velementov Main Belinda Bromilow Elizabeth Main Bayo Gbadamosi Arkady Main Sebastian de Souza Leo Voronsky Main Does not appear Florence Keith-Roach Tatyana Recurring Main Danusia Samal Lady Antonia Svenska Recurring Main Does not appear Freddie Fox King Hugo of Sweden Guest Recurring Main Grace Molony Queen Agnes of Sweden Guest Recurring Main Recurring cast Louis Hynes Vlad Recurring Does not appear Jamie Demetriou Doctor Chekov Recurring Does not appear Christophe Tek Tartar Nick Recurring Does not appear Charlie Price Ivan Recurring Does not appear Alistair Green Count Smolny Recurring Abraham Popoola Alexei Rostov Recurring Does not appear Stewart Scudamore Tolsten Recurring Does not appear Christianne Oliveira Countess Belanova Recurring Blake Harrison Colonel Svenska Recurring Does not appear Kemi-Bo Jacobs Marina Recurring Does not appear Dustin Demri-Burns Voltaire Guest Recurring Tristan Beint Lieutenant Bukharin Guest Does not appear Soldier Alexi Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Ashwin Bolar Doctor Smirnov Guest Recurring Guest Keon Martial-Phillip Russian POW Guest Does not appear Soldier Vasily Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Guard Does not appear Guest Julian Barratt Dr. Vinodel Does not appear Recurring Jane Mahady Katya Velcra Does not appear Recurring Anthony Welsh Father Basil Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Ali Ariaie Raskolvy Does not appear Recurring Ramon Tikaram Uncle Varnya Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Timothy Walker Soldier Emile Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Eloise Webb Sylvana Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Kiki May Nadia Does not appear Recurring Guest Gethin Alderman Jean Pierre Does not appear Recurring Guest Sam Coulson Pugachev / Peter double Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Danielle Galligan Yula Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Minnie Gale Fedora Does not appear Recurring Does not appear Richard Pyros Count Raskolnikov Guest Does not appear Recurring Henry Meredith Maxim Does not appear Guest Recurring Emily Coates Petra Does not appear Recurring Jacob Fortune-Lloyd Grigory Petrov Does not appear Recurring Special guests[b] Gillian Anderson Joanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp Does not appear Guest Does not appear Jason Isaacs Peter the Great Does not appear Guest\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nSeries overview\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1 (2020)\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitleDirected byWritten byOriginal release date11\"The Great\"Matt ShakmanWritten for Television by : Tony McNamaraMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nIn the eighteenth century, young, educated and highly optimistic German noblewoman Catherine marries Emperor Peter of Russia. Her ambitions and optimism shatter as she discovers Peter's frivolous, cruel, and spiteful nature, and realizes that in Russia citizens are mistreated, women are not educated and religion influences most government decisions. Catherine finds an unexpected friend in her maid, Marial, a former noblewoman demoted to serfdom. She also discovers that Peter's longtime mistress, Georgina, is also the wife of his best friend, Grigor, who admits to Catherine that the arrangement is painful but he loves Peter and his wife. Catherine obtains Peter's permission to establish a school, but he burns it down after learning that it is intended for girls. When Peter shoots the bear he gave to Catherine during a party, she slaps him in front of everyone and he responds by punching and threatening her later in private. Catherine, now little more than a prisoner, decides to escape with the help of Marial, but Peter finds out and nearly drowns her as punishment. Disheartened, Catherine is about to slit her wrists when Marial informs her about a law in Russia: if an emperor dies without an heir, the throne will pass to the empress. Catherine begins to plot to overthrow her husband.\n\n22\"A Fake Beard\"Colin BuckseyTony McNamaraMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nAs Catherine and Marial seek to arrange Peter's death, Marial suggests seducing Orlo, a member of Peter's inner circle. Catherine fails to seduce Orlo and tells her plan to him. Peter apologizes to Catherine for his prior behavior and suggests providing her with a lover, but Catherine reacts negatively. Orlo tries to help Count Rostov, who has been commanded to shave off his beard in accordance with law. An enraged Peter decides to kill Catherine in a carriage accident. Archie (the archbishop) warns her and she feigns affection and submissiveness, causing Peter to reconsider. She learns about Peter's mother, who is kept mummified in a glass case since he refuses to bury her, and her harshness towards him. Catherine fails to persuade Orlo to cooperate, but he keeps her secret. When Peter forces Orlo to shave Rostov's beard, Orlo switches allegiances and agrees to support Catherine's plans.\n\n33\"And You Sir, Are No Peter the Great\"Bert & BertieTony McNamaraMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nCatherine and Orlo prepare for their new era, whilst Peter offers a lover to Catherine, Leo Voronsky, the sterile son of a legendary charming and promiscuous man. Orlo suspects Leo is spying for Peter. Catherine asks Leo to pretend he has slept with her. The next day, she assures Peter that she and Leo had a great night and asks him to let Leo go. Unconvinced, Peter beats Leo for not convincing her to keep him, leading Catherine to insist she wants Leo to stay. Orlo and Marial suggest using Ivan, Peter's half-brother, against him. Catherine locates Ivan, who is hidden in a secret room in the castle with the help of Aunt Elizabeth. Catherine embarrasses Lady Svenska at ladies' tea in retaliation for beating Marial, causing the ladies to turn on her. When Peter gives a speech about the greatness of his father, he gets emotional and an officer mocks him. Encouraged by Catherine to show his real emotions, he stabs the officer. Peter encourages Catherine to take a lover of her own choice, but Catherine accepts Leo and begins a passionate relationship with him.\n\n44\"Moscow Mule\"Bert & BertieTess MorrisMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nCatherine and Leo pursue their love affair. News arrives that the patriarch, the Russian Orthodox church leader, has passed and Peter must choose a new one by the following day. Catherine, Marial, and Orlo continue to plan for their new era, aiming to appoint the liberal Bishop Tarcinkus as the new church leader, believing he will support Catherine. Catherine learns that Lady Svenska is spreading false rumours about her having had sex with a horse, and tries to make amends for political reasons, but is rejected. One bishop renounces Peter and commits self-immolation during the selection of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus'. Catherine tries to gain the other ladies' admiration by gifting Fabergé eggs, but Georgina advises her not to come begging this way. Lady Svenska invites Catherine to a tea, at which the ladies push, kick, and belittle her. Peter instructs Archie to receive a vision from God to decide on the new bishop. He consumes psychedelic mushrooms in the forest and Catherine stumbles upon him as he hallucinates. He believes her to be an angel and she tells him that he is the rightful bishop. At the celebration for Archie becoming the new patriarch, Catherine gossips with the court ladies about Leo, as they had previously requested, and pretends to harshly discipline Marial for mentioning the horse rumor.\n\n55\"War and Vomit\"Ben ChessellJames WoodMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nCatherine and Elizabeth visit the Russian front amid the war with Sweden. Appalled by the horrors she witnesses, Catherine becomes determined to gain the throne in a nonviolent manner. She fails to convince Peter to withdraw the military. Grigor, who has long sublimated his jealousy and anger toward Peter for having sex with his wife, impulsively poisons Peter's borscht with arsenic. Peter falls gravely ill, leaving Catherine next in line for the throne, but her claim is threatened by the existence of Ivan and the sudden prospect of becoming Empress causes Catherine to appear incompetent and unprepared for power. Elizabeth murders Ivan to prevent a civil war should Peter die. Catherine's newfound pacifism causes tension between her, Marial, and Orlo, who try to convince her that she must engage in bloodshed as Empress. As Catherine and Marial squabble over whether or not to kill Peter, he awakens, having recovered.\n\n66\"Parachute\"Ben ChessellTony McNamaraMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nPeter feels inspired to better himself after his brush with death. Elizabeth encourages Peter to sire an heir, leading him to seek out Catherine. As Peter has become more tender and open to change, they become more intimate, putting a strain on her relationship with Leo. Catherine uses Peter's newfound interest in her to encourage him to bring arts and sciences to Russia. She becomes convinced she can change Russia for the better by influencing Peter. Archie discourages Peter's pursuit of learning and threatens Catherine, who threatens him in return. Orlo becomes lost in the woods and encounters Russian and Swedish soldiers. Archie puts a raven in Peter's room to scare him, angering Peter. Catherine asks Peter to reinstate Marial as a lady of the court. Peter refuses, revealing the reason for her demotion: as part of an ill-advised joke, her father committed necrophilia with Peter's mother's corpse. Instead, Catherine gives her back her dog, Bilini, and Peter promptly uses it for a test of a parachute. Catherine celebrates this demonstration of science with hope for the future.\n\n77\"A Pox on Hope\"Colin BuckseyTony McNamara and Gretel VellaMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nThanks to Catherine, the Russian court is excitedly absorbing culture. Catherine believes she can change Russia by influencing Peter instead of killing him, and gives him a printing press. Despite Archie's opposition, Peter likes the press's ability to print cartoons and allows it to stay. To thank Catherine, he performs cunnilingus on her and she reaches orgasm, which troubles her as she is in love with Leo. Peter brags to Leo about the encounter, and a jealous Leo gets drunk and distributes cartoons depicting Catherine having sex with a horse. Georgina feels that she is losing Peter's favor. Marial is about to have sex with the servant Vlad when she discovers evidence of smallpox on his back. She and Catherine attempt to help him, but Dr. Chekov is indifferent and plans to burn Vlad and other serfs who have been affected by an outbreak. Catherine pushes for inoculation, but the court and Peter are against her. Peter is furious when she inoculates herself before the entire court to convince them of its efficacy. He bans the practice and locks her away until it is certain that she has not been infected. Catherine emerges from her apartments and witnesses, from a distance, the serfs being burned.\n\n88\"Meatballs at the Dacha\"Colin BuckseyTeleplay by : Tony McNamara\n\nStory by : Amelia Roper and Tony McNamaraMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nCatherine and Peter travel to meet the King and Queen of Sweden for peace talks. Peter tries to make amends with Catherine by giving her a large diamond, but she remains angry with him over the deaths of the serfs, including Vlad. En route to Sweden, Catherine tries to get Velementov to join the coup, but he is only interested in seducing her. Peter and Catherine share a moment of closeness before the peace talks begin. Peter initially gets on well with the Swedish king, Hugo, finding him a kindred spirit, but becomes enraged when Hugo demands the return of St. Petersburg. Catherine steps in, claiming to have heard the Emperor talking in his sleep, and presents an acceptable compromise. Troubled by the distance between himself and Catherine, Leo prepares to return home, but is stopped by Marial who reveals Catherine's plans to him. Catherine and Peter return to Moscow in triumph. Peter thanks Catherine for helping him, revealing he knows he doesn't talk in his sleep. Catherine and Leo are reunited and he enthusiastically joins the coup.\n\n99\"Love Hurts\"Geeta PatelTony McNamaraMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nOrlo, Marial, Velementov, and Leo set out to bring more aristocrats to Catherine's side, with mixed results. Velementov and Leo are forced to kill Count Gorky after he refuses to join the coup. Elizabeth's suspicions are aroused, as Gorky had been Peter the Great's best friend. Peter becomes convinced there is a threat to his life and surrounds Catherine and himself with guards everywhere they go. The entire court, apart from Elizabeth, Georgina, and Grigor, are subjected to torture. Catherine, determined to show the court that she is not in league with Peter, undergoes torture herself. She and the other conspirators succeed in keeping the coup a secret. Grigor confronts Peter and admits he resents Peter's affair with Georgina. Peter agrees to end the relationship and reveals he's fallen in love with Catherine. Rostov, who was forced to shave his beard and lost the love of his wife as a result, returns only to face ridicule from Peter and Grigor. After a tryst with Marial, who is desperate to become a noble again, Rostov breaks into the room where Peter is hiding with Catherine, intending to kill him. Peter, Grigor, and Georgina fight Rostov off and kill him. At a dinner with the Russian court, who are all recovering from a day of torture, Catherine gives a passionate speech that unites them in devotion to her. Afterwards, Peter tells Catherine he loves her. She returns to her apartments and discovers she is pregnant.\n\n1010\"The Beaver's Nose\"Geeta PatelTony McNamaraMay 15, 2020 ( )\n\nShocked at the revelation that she is pregnant by Peter, Catherine wakes on her 21st birthday determined to enact the coup. Peter prepares a special cake and other gifts for her, then plans to kill Leo, believing this will cause her to transfer her affection to him. Catherine sends Velementov to gather the military leaders to support her and sends Orlo to kill Archie, while promising Marial that Archie will not be harmed. Leo goes hunting with Grigor and Peter and they attempt to kill him, but are unsuccessful. Catherine prepares to kill her husband during a birthday lunch, but is halted when he reveals her gift: the philosopher Voltaire, whom Catherine idolizes. She finds herself unable to kill Peter in front of Voltaire. Peter claims that Leo has abandoned her, but Catherine realizes her lover is either dead or in danger and attacks Peter, who believes her assault to have arisen out of passion for him and locks her in the room. Orlo fails to kill Archie and is injured. Marial, frustrated that Catherine has not killed Peter, becomes convinced the coup will fail and discovers Orlo attacking Archie. Furious that she's been betrayed, she is persuaded by Archie to reveal Catherine's betrayal to Peter. In exchange for becoming a lady again, Marial shows Peter Catherine's plans for overthrowing him and reveals that she's pregnant. Heartbroken, Peter confronts Catherine, who suggests he abdicate. He shows her that Leo is his prisoner and threatens to kill him unless she calls off the coup. Catherine goes to Velementov to stop the uprising, determined to save Leo, but he tells her she has filled Russia with hope for a new future, which is more important. Catherine goes to see Leo and explains what has happened. He expresses regret but understands her choice. Catherine kisses him goodbye, then signals Velementov, who fires his pistol to restart the coup.\n\nSeason 2 (2021)\n\n[edit]\n\nNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitle [9]Directed byWritten byOriginal release date [10]111\"Heads, It's Me\"Colin BuckseyTony McNamaraNovember 19, 2021 ( )\n\nIt has been four months since the coup began.

She launches her long-awaited girls' school, met with resistance from Lady Svenska and the court ladies. Prior to her coronation, Catherine she meets the nobles of her empire, many of whom disrespect her and repeat the rumour that she had sex with a horse. One, Tarzinsky, threatens Catherine with violence but is cowed by Archie's presence. The only visitor who positively interacts with Catherine is Father Basil, a country priest and Leo's cousin, who gives her Leo's letters. Catherine is crowned and begins her rule. Her first decree proclaims religious freedom in Russia, provoking Archie's ire, and she begins to groom Father Basil as Archie's replacement. Peter plans to wait for Catherine to fail and make her fall in love with him. Grigor and Arkady plot against Catherine. On Aunt Elizabeth's advice, Peter asks Catherine what she would change about him and agrees to curb his propensity for violence. He subsequently becomes enraged at Tarzinsky for calling him a \"dickhead\" and stabs him to death in the palace courtyard.\n\n133\"Alone at Last\"Zetna FuentesTony McNamaraNovember 19, 2021 ( )\n\nCatherine awakes from a nightmare about Leo. She punishes Peter for killing Tarzinsky by locking him in his rooms, despite his pleas to go truffle hunting with his new dog, an activity he remembers bonding with his father over in childhood. Desperate to leave Russia, Georgina convinces Catherine to exile her and Grigor to France. Trying to avoid dreaming about Leo, Catherine takes drugs to stay awake and, in a manic state, appoints Father Basil Archbishop of Russia. Pressured by his intimidating uncle Vanya, Orlo takes advantage of Catherine's intoxication to convince her to build a road in his impoverished home state. To further punish Peter, Catherine has the mummified body of his dead mother brought into his room, keeping him locked inside. Recalling her harsh treatment of him as a child, he breaks her glass coffin and accidentally destroys her corpse. After a confrontation with Catherine where he angers her by casually mentioning Leo's death, Peter escapes to the woods to go truffle hunting. He is caught by Velementov, who reminds Peter that he, not Peter's father, took him truffle hunting as a child. Peter begins to come to terms with his parents' neglect and abuse. Catherine takes Peter's dog into the woods, determined to find and destroy the first truffle of the season to spite him, and accidentally comes across the clearing where she said goodbye to Leo. Consoled by Marial and Elizabeth, she allows herself to admit that she could not have saved him. Grigor, feeling that Peter needs him, stops the carriage en route to Paris and returns to the palace without Georgina.\n\n144\"The Devil's Lunch\"Zetna FuentesTami SagherNovember 19, 2021 ( )\n\nVelementov insists that Russia should go to war with the Ottoman empire, but Catherine is reluctant to start a war over nothing. Sundak, an Ottoman ambassador and an old friend of Peter's, comes to meet Catherine, who has a dim view of the Ottomans' misogynistic culture. She arranges the room to imply she has an all-female council of close advisors, but he is unruffled by the implied insult. Velementov begins an affair with Lady Svenska, who is secretly spying for Peter, and lets slip that war with the Ottomans is a possibility. Catherine and Peter each try to win Sundak to their respective causes, which is complicated by Peter's jealousy of Catherine's interest in the handsome Sundak. Meanwhile, Archie attempts unsuccessfully to ingratiate himself with Catherine on Marial's advice, and Marial begins an affair with a depressed Grigor. Peter attempts to undermine Catherine and Sundak's relationship by throwing a raucous party, but Catherine outwits him by taking over the party and impressing Sundak on a hunting trip the next day. Sundak leaves after a peace agreement has been reached, but Arkady and Tatyana, on orders from Peter, intercept Sundak's carriage and assassinate him. Catherine cuts short a tryst with a guard when she discovers lice in his beard, and relents when Elizabeth suggests taking advantage of Peter's skills in cunnilingus.\n\n155\"Animal Instincts\"Matthew MooreTony McNamaraNovember 19, 2021 ( )\n\nCatherine regrets her sexual encounter with Peter, but he is thrilled that she shows signs of returning his affection, to Elizabeth's delight and Grigor's frustration. Elizabeth counsels him to make himself a mystery to Catherine, and he successfully intrigues her by playing hard to get. The court is thrown into alarm when a crocodile mysteriously begins roaming the palace and attacks Elizabeth, wounding her leg and eating her pet mouse. Catherine dismisses the superstitious nobles who believe it to be a demon or a supernatural omen, but becomes frustrated when Father Basil tells the court that the creature may indeed be a sign from God. Archie announces that as Patriarch, only he can discover the meaning of the \"omen\", and Catherine realizes that he has planted the creature himself. He threatens to proclaim that the crocodile is a sign that God condemns her reign unless she agrees to revoke religious freedom and remove Father Basil from power. Catherine asks Peter, an excellent hunter, to search the Palace for the animal with her, but he ignores an opportunity to kill it, in order to spend more time with her. Catherine agrees to Archie's demand, and he takes her to \"meet God\" through the use of psychedelic mushrooms. Although the two see different visions, they recognize their mutual hope for a better Russia. Meanwhile, Marial encounters an elderly serf, \"Shakey\", who she shared rooms with during her time as a servant. Learning that Shakey has been declared too old to work, Marial takes her on as a maid. Catherine captures the crocodile using opium-laced mice, but when she presents the captured animal to the court, the nobles panic when it starts to wake up and stab it to death. That evening, she agrees to dance with Peter, sharing a romantic moment with him that she abruptly stops, uncomfortable with her growing interest in him.\n\n166\"A Simple Jape\"Matthew MooreTony McNamara & Gretel VellaNovember 19, 2021 ( )\n\nIn the middle of a tryst, Peter and Catherine argue when he accuses her of using him for sex and she refuses to say that she loves him. After being confronted by pupils at her girls' school who think she is not changing the system quickly enough, Catherine resolves to free all serfs. Orlo cautions patience, but the impatient Catherine decides to play a \"jape\" on the court to prove her point. She disguises Shakey as a member of the aristocracy at a party, and introduces her as \"Lady Anastasia\". Lady Svenska is fooled and charmed by the old woman, but horrified when Catherine announces Shakey's true identity. Father Basil takes his leave of Archie, condemning his political gamesmanship in a passionate speech. Archie suddenly kisses Basil, an act that leaves him shaken and confused. Grigor forces Orlo to give him Catherine's plans for liberating serfs, and uses them to turn the nobles against Catherine. This goads Catherine into proclaiming immediate freedom for the serfs, and Peter takes advantage of the situation to urge the nobles to call for Catherine's abdication. He plans to escape his rooms with the help of a body double, Pugachev, and take Catherine hostage. The palace serfs rebel against the nobles, and in the resulting chaos, Marial discovers that Lady Svenska has murdered Shakey. Catherine's advisors call on her to put an end to the violence, but she cannot bring herself to fire on her own people and orders them out of the room. Peter bursts into Catherine's office with a gun, but when he finds her weeping alone at her failure, he comforts her and willingly returns to his captivity. Catherine reluctantly orders Velementov to subdue the rebellion. After the violence is over, Marial shoots Svenska in the head, in revenge for Shakey's murder.\n\n177\"Stapler\"Ally PankiwTony McNamaraNovember 19, 2021 ( )\n\nCatherine hosts a science contest for new inventions.

Archie struggles over his recent kiss with Basil and confesses these feelings to Marial. Grigor conspires to force Catherine to abdicate to Peter. Catherine's mother, Princess Joanna, arrives to visit. While excited, Catherine feels belittled by the updates on her siblings' successful marriages and faces disapproval from her mother for her coup and keeping Peter alive. Joanna continues to disapprove and accurately read and dress down the members of court for attempting to take advantage of Catherine's naive optimism. Orlo steals money from the treasury to support his family in their home region. Aunt Elizabeth warns Peter that he must gain Joanna's approval, but he dismisses her concerns. Catherine immediately susses out that Peter has kidnapped the scientist from Norway but goes along with the plan to win the science contest. Joanna is fascinated and horrified by Peter when they meet but then lightly seduces him and informs Catherine she is aware the cold box/fridge is missing. A serf approaches Catherine with a new idea for an invention for the science contest, a rollercoaster, which Joanna disapproves of.\n\n188\"Seven Days\"Ally PankiwTony McNamaraNovember 19, 2021 ( )\n\nJoanna has an allergic reaction to peanuts brought from the Americas, causing Catherine to feel immense guilt.

I wanted to tell it as a story that goes for years and years.\"[15][16] The series was initially pitched as having six seasons, having planned to introduce key historical figures in Catherine's life as the series continued.[17]\n\nOn August 24, 2018, it was announced that Hulu was close to giving a pilot order to a miniseries about Catherine the Great. The series was written by Tony McNamara who also served as an executive producer alongside Elle Fanning and Marian Macgowan. Production companies involved with the pilot consist of Media Rights Capital, Echo Lake Entertainment, and Thruline Entertainment.[18] On November 20, 2018, it was reported that Matt Shakman was directing the pilot.[19] On February 11, 2019, it was announced during the Television Critics Association's annual winter press tour that Hulu had given the production a series order.[20] On July 2, 2020, Hulu renewed the series for a second season.[4] On January 11, 2022, Hulu renewed the series for a 10-episode third and final season.[6]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nAlongside the initial pilot announcement, it was confirmed that Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult had been cast in the pilot's lead roles as Catherine the Great and her husband Peter III of Russia, respectively. In November 2018, it was announced that Phoebe Fox, Sacha Dhawan, Charity Wakefield, and Gwilym Lee had joined the cast of the pilot.[19][21][22] In January 2020, Sebastian De Souza, Adam Godley, and Douglas Hodge were added to the cast.[23] On May 14, 2021, Gillian Anderson was cast in a guest starring role as Johanna, Catherine's mother.[24]\n\nFilming\n\n[edit]\n\nPrincipal photography for the pilot episode had commenced by November 2018 in York, England with other filming locations expected to include Leicestershire, Lincolnshire and Hever in Kent. The main filming locations were Hatfield House in Hertfordshire, Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire and the Royal Palace of Caserta in southern Italy.[21][25][26][27][28][29] The loggia on the lake at Hever Castle doubled as the location for a Russo-Swedish peace conference. St Clere Estate near Sevenoaks in Kent was used to stage battle scenes, palace gardens, hunting scenes, carriage routes, the Swedish border, the war-torn Russian village and the frozen lake among other scenes.[30] Filming for season two began on November 4, 2020[31] and ended on July 17, 2021; another location used was Hampton Court Palace.[32] Filming for season three began on July 12, 2022[33] and ended on December 6, 2022.[34]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series premiered in the United States on May 15, 2020. In Australia, all episodes were released on Stan on May 16. The series airs on Channel 4 and StarzPlay in the UK. It was released on StarzPlay 18 June 2020 [35] and on Channel 4 on 3 January 2021.[36]\n\nStarzPlay also distribute the series in Ireland, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Benelux, Latin America and Brazil. More.tv broadcasts the show in Russia, Sky in New Zealand, and Amazon Prime Video in Canada.[37]\n\nSeason 2\n\n[edit]\n\nThe second season premiered on November 19, 2021 in the US,[5] and on the same day in Canada, for Amazon Prime Video.[38]\n\nIn the UK Starzplay premiered the second season on 5 December 2021[39] and on Channel 4 on 27 July 2022.[40]\n\nSeason 3\n\n[edit]\n\nThe third season premiered on May 12, 2023, with all 10 episodes on Hulu.[7]\n\nHistorical accuracy\n\n[edit]\n\nHulu has described The Great as \"anti-historical,\" and each episode's title sequence subtitled the series as an \"occasionally true story\"[2] until the second season finale, when it changed to \"an almost entirely untrue story.\"[41] According to Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd, \"McNamara had jotted down some names, relationships and a few historical bullet points, torn up the paper, and started writing. And so must the viewer abandon himself to what's on the plate without a care to learning anything useful or even true about Russia or any of the real people represented here.\"[42]\n\nPeter III is inaccurately referred to as being the son of Peter the Great on numerous occasions; he was actually his grandson.[43] \"Aunt\" Elizabeth is modeled on Peter the Great's actual daughter, Empress Elizabeth, but this version is Peter's sister-in-law and lover, and has never ruled Russia. While Elizabeth did negotiate the marriage of her nephew Charles Peter Ulrich (later Peter III) to the future Catherine the Great,[44] as portrayed in the series, historically this was done while Elizabeth was ruling as sovereign Empress, and Peter only became Emperor after Elizabeth's death.[43] Unlike in the series, Elizabeth was not close or loving to Peter III[45] or to Catherine,[46] although she was desperate for Catherine to produce an heir. The young prince and possible claimant to the throne Ivan was secretly kept prisoner as a child during Peter III's reign, as portrayed on the series, having been imprisoned since infancy by Empress Elizabeth, who had taken the throne from him and his regent mother Anna Leopoldovna. Ivan was not killed by Elizabeth and did not die during Peter's reign, as portrayed in the series, but was killed during the second year of Catherine's reign by his guards to prevent an attempt to free him (per Catherine's orders in case of such an attempt) when Ivan was twenty years old.[47] In addition, Ivan VI was not Peter III's half brother, but was his second cousin once removed, being a great-grandson of Peter the Great's half-brother Ivan V.\n\nCatherine's negative reception upon her arrival in Russia more closely resembles that given to Marie Antoinette upon arriving in France. In reality, Catherine was something of a Russian nationalist before even arriving in Russia and rapidly became more popular than her husband.[48] In the series, Peter III is portrayed as a native-born Russian who is deeply connected to his country and its traditions, and opposition to Catherine's rule often centres around her being a German foreigner. In reality Peter III was German-born like Catherine, always identified himself as German and not Russian, and refused to adopt the Russian language or culture even while living in Russia and serving as its emperor.[45] His overthrow was heavily due to the military and local nobility's support for Catherine's Russian patriotism as opposed to the pro-Prussian policy and attitude of Peter III.[49] Moreover, \"Catherine\" is portrayed as being her original name, when in fact it was her baptismal name after converting to Russian Orthodoxy; her original German Protestant name was Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg.\n\nMost historically based events are greatly compressed or transposed in the series' timeline, while others are greatly lengthened. In the series, Catherine meets and marries Peter when he is already Emperor and both are adults. Catherine begins the series around the age of 19 and does not overthrow Peter or give birth to her son Paul until she is 21. In reality, Catherine and Peter met as children and were married at the ages of 16 and 17 respectively, when Peter was heir apparent to the Russian throne.[50] Peter and Catherine lived as Grand Duke and Duchess of Russia for seven years before Peter became Emperor, and he was overthrown by Catherine after six months, while in the series Catherine does not commence her coup until roughly two years into the marriage. Catherine's son Paul was already eight years old when Peter became Emperor, and Peter was not caring or protective of the child, of whom he suspected he was not the father. As opposed to months of violent battle between loyalists and rebels as portrayed in the series, Catherine's coup against Peter took only about one day, had almost no armed opposition, and secured Peter's abdication mostly bloodlessly. As in the series, Peter was not sentenced to execution and was placed under house arrest, although not in the same residence as Catherine but at his estate in Ropsha. Instead of the long time Peter remains alive following the coup in the series, the historical Peter died only six days after his overthrow. The circumstances of Peter III's death remain shrouded in mystery, with different accounts and theories alleging disease, accident, drunken brawl or deliberate assassination as the cause. This ambiguity and suspicion is alluded to in the third-season finale \"Once Upon a Time\", when Catherine orders differing and contradictory explanations of Peter's death to be circulated.\n\nMany events from later in the real Catherine's 34-year reign are retrofitted into her first year or two in power in the series, such as the Russian-Ottoman War of 1768 to 1774 and Russia's response to the American Revolution. As shown in the season three episode \"Choose Your Weapon\", Great Britain did attempt to bribe Catherine with the island of Menorca in exchange for Russian support against the American rebels, and Catherine was appealed to by a representative of the then-unrecognized United States (in the series called Mr. Glover, historically Francis Dana); Catherine did also express admiration for the principles of the United States Declaration of Independence. Russia and Sweden did fight numerous wars in the 17th and 18th centuries, including one during Catherine's reign from 1788 to 1790, and one under Empress Elizabeth's rule when Peter was heir to the throne from 1741 to 1743, but none during Peter III's brief reign. King Hugo and Queen Agnes of Sweden are fictional, but there were several real Swedish monarchs who experienced similar defeats and overthrows by democratizing movements in the 18th century, a period known as Sweden's Age of Liberty.\n\nOther events in the series are deliberately anachronistic or combine elements liberally from the 17th to 19th centuries. Catherine claims at one point to have met René Descartes, who in reality died in 1650, almost 80 years before Catherine the Great was born; in another episode Catherine and her mother express disdain at Beethoven, who did not achieve fame until the 1790s, shortly before the real Catherine's death.\n\nMost members of Peter and Catherine's court in the series have no direct historical counterparts.[51] Count Orlo's name suggests the historical Prince Grigory Orlov, who as in the series played a key role in Catherine's coup, had a love of culture and Enlightenment ideals, and promoted smallpox vaccination.[52] In reality, Orlov was a military officer and lover of Catherine's, and his death was due to prolonged illness and not shooting. Grigor Dymov also has no direct historical basis, though his first name and prominence in Peter and Catherine's court recall both Prince Orlov and Prince Grigory Potemkin. As portrayed, Catherine the Great was an ardent reader of Enlightenment-era philosophers such as Denis Diderot, Montesquieu, Rousseau and Voltaire; she did not have Voltaire live in her court, although the two corresponded for years,[53] and she did summon Diderot and Lemercier de La Rivière for brief visits,[54] as well as Rousseau, who declined.[47] As portrayed, Catherine was the first person in Russia to be inoculated for smallpox via variolation, although this was during her rule, not in defiance of any laws.[55] There was a ban on beards and on private use of the printing press in Russia before Catherine's reign, as portrayed. The Nakaz portrayed in season three is inspired by history, although it was not the name of the consultative body convened by Catherine (which was actually called the All-Russian Legislative Commission), but rather of the proclamations that resulted from it (\"Nakaz\" being Russian for \"Instruction\").\n\nThe Cossack Pugachev, who led a revolt against Catherine's rule while claiming to be her deceased husband Peter III, is here portrayed as a royal lookalike in Peter's court. In reality Pugachev was the son of a Cossack landowner and a deserter from the Russian army before assuming Peter's identity, and his rebellion began eleven years after the real Peter III's death, not while Peter was still alive as in the series. The real Pugachev had no known connection to the imperial court or royal family, and he was only one of several people who claimed they were the deceased Peter III after his downfall, although Pugachev was certainly the most successful. His rebellion recruited tens of thousands of peasants and caused great distress for Catherine's reign, as portrayed; it did not succeed in capturing Moscow, as portrayed in the series, but did manage to briefly occupy the major city of Kazan.\n\nThe series repeatedly alludes to a longstanding legend that Catherine the Great died while engaging in bestiality with a horse. In the series this is transformed to a claim made repeatedly, though groundlessly, by Catherine's contemporaries that she had sexual intercourse with a horse before coming to Russia.\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nCritical response of The GreatSeasonRotten TomatoesMetacritic189% (87 reviews)[56]74 (33 reviews)[57]2100% (34 reviews)[58]85 (9 reviews)[59]3100% (16 reviews)[60]88 (8 reviews)[61]\n\nSeason 1\n\n[edit]\n\nThe first season received mostly positive reviews from critics.
