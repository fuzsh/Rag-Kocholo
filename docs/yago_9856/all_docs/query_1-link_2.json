        "text": "Last month drew film-goers far and wide to Utah in the United States, hoping to catch the latest independent works at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nFor some filmmakers, the festival is an opportunity to break into the scene.\n\nBut for Vietnamese-American filmmaker Tony Bui, it was an opportunity to light up the Sundance screen for the second time.\n\nHis film Three Seasons premiered 25 years ago in 1999 in the US Dramatic Competition and won multiple awards.\n\nThis year, viewers were able to watch a remastered version of the original piece, digitally restored in 4K from the original 35mm camera negative.\n\nBui said although the film was made over two decades ago, viewers still connected with the piece.\n\nVietnam after the war\n\nSet and filmed in Vietnam, Bui had a clear vision of what he wanted the film to convey.\n\n\"We still have wars, we still have people trying to deal with that transition, deal with the trauma of war … the leftover sort of pain that's carried on for generations.\"\n\nReturning to his cultural roots, Bui decided to shoot the film on Vietnamese soil.\n\n\"There weren't a lot of films at that time, made from a Vietnamese perspective,\" he said.\n\n\"When that showed a Sundance, it was like this kind of really fresh, really different thing.\"\n\nHe said in the 90s, every American film about the Vietnam War had been shot in either Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines, or other south-east Asian countries.\n\n\"It's been described as, as sort of [the] first Vietnam peace film,\" Bui said.\n\n\"Because every other film about Vietnam, at least up to that point, you know, at least coming out of America was about war.\n\n\"At that time, it felt like we were doing something really important, unique.\"\n\nBui wanted to capture the experience of locals as America and Vietnam renewed their diplomatic and economic ties.\n\nThe majority of the characters are Vietnamese, except for one American.\n\n\"The film was about this sort of the transition as Vietnam is sort of going through this period where they were getting back into sort of a relationship with America,\" he said.\n\n\"It's about how the people sort of dealt with all that.\"\n\nReturning to Sundance\n\nBui has been to Sundance multiple times for other films he has produced, but this year, it was special.\n\nSeeing his work light up the festival screen again 25 years later brought back memories of his first Sundance festival.\n\nHe was in his mid-20s and anxious about how the audience would react to his work.\n\nHowever, there was no reason for nerves, as the film received three awards that year.\n\n\"That was already such an emotional, incredible experience, and you never think you're going to play the film again, at the same festival,\" Bui said.\n\n\"When it just circled back 25 years later, and we were asked, it was super exciting.\"\n\nThis time he was able to bring many members of his crew and share the experience with the team that originally brought the film to life."
