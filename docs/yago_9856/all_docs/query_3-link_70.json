The young Kien An, who is a living memory of the old ways, living a life seemingly unchanged by the passage of time, is hired to be a personal assistant to a reclusive spiritual master. In the center of the city, Hai, a cyclo driver falls for a proud, young prostitute, Lan, with lofty ambitions, who frequents the new marble hotels. Lan as reinvented herself as someone who can survive in the cold-hearted capitalist world. Hai bridges the two worlds on his cyclo. Meanwhile, Woody, a young boy who hustles trinkets on the streets, meets G.I. James Hager, who is searching for the daughter he left behind in the war. James Hager is a reminder of the country's ravaged past while young Woody is a symbol of its future. These stories merge to paint a portrait of a country in transition, the last moments of a culture which, through a second invasion by its former enemy, will never be the same again.\n\nActress Zoe Bui(second from left) and Film Festival attenders.\n\nThree Seasons is Director Tony Bui's first feature film and it was chosen for both the Sundance Writers and Directors Lab in 1996. It is the first American film to be shot in Vietnam, and one of the only foreign language films ever fully financed by an American Distributor.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nPulitzer Prize Winner, LOVE SONGS Producer and Screenwriter Charles Fuller (right)\n\nLOVE SONGS\n\nINTERVIEW WITH PULITZER PRIZE WINNER CHARLES FULLER\n\nDirectors: Louis Gossett Jr., Robert Townsend, Andre Braugher\n\nProducer: Charles Fuller\n\nScreenwriter: Charles Fuller\n\nEditor: Bill Goddard\n\nDirector of Photography: James Bagdonas\n\nMusic: Ronnie Laws, Pete Anthony\n\nCast: Louis Gossett, Jr., Robert Townsend, Andre Braugher, Rachel Crawford, Michael Anthony Rawlins, Lynn Whitfield\n\nPrint Source: Showtime Networks Inc.

For three desperate days, Fred Derf painfully tries to rationalize his twisted desires only to confront his greatest fear: Love. Through the marriage of shockingly beautiful visuals and intense sound design, Aaron Downing's darkly comic debut feature dares the audience to find truth in a world without answers. You have no choice but to react.\n\n(L-R) Producer Scott Downing, Screenwriter and Director Aaron Downing, and Producer Lane Soelberg.\n\nScreenwriter / Director Aaron Downing moved to Chicago and graduated from the Columbia College Film School in 1992. After graduation, he decided to move to California and got a job as a runner on the Beverly Hillbillies movie. In 1995, Aaron wrote the screenplay for Pure Killjoy while working in post-production at Fox, and raised enough money to begin production on what would become his directorial debut. He spend the next three years running up credit cards, calling in favors and neglecting his girlfriend, to the point that she left the country, to get his film completed. Pure Killjoy made its debut at the 1998 South Beach Film Festival.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nROSE'S\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nINTERVIEW WITH PRODUCER KARCHI PERLMANN\n\nDirector: Frank Patterson\n\nProducer: Karchi Perlmann\n\nScreenwriter: Frank Patterson\n\nEditors: Frank Patterson, Dan Leonard\n\nDirector of Photography: Tom Callaway\n\nMusic: Bill Peterson\n\nCast: Leslie France, Wayne DeHart, Sylvia Miles, Glenn Shadix\n\nPrint Source: Envisage Media Production, (Tallahassee, FL)\n\nProducer Karchi Perlmann\n\nSecrets abound in a small southern town, and most of them seem to revolve around Rose, a timid florist.
