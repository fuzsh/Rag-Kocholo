        "text": "You may not like The Acolyte, but don’t look me in the eye and tell me it’s not being review bombed to hell and back.\n\nThe Disney era of Star Wars has been full of debates about quality, canon, oversaturation and contained a mix of good and bad projects. But I have not seen this kind of backlash to a project since The Last Jedi, and things have gotten just absolutely ridiculous at this point.\n\nThere is this idea that The Acolyte is not being “review bombed,” it’s just really that bad. But the data here is absurd, showing a clear tidal wave of users racing to make it the lowest user-scored product in 50 years of Star Wars history, and it’s amassed quadruple the reviews of the longest-running Star Wars series, The Clone Wars. The only thing even close is three seasons across five years of the massively-watched Mandalorian, and even then, that falls well short. Here’s the list of total user scores by TV project, across all of their seasons.\n\nThe Acolyte – 25,000\n\nThe Mandalorian – 17,500\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi – 10,000\n\nThe Clone Wars – 6,000\n\nAndor – 5,000\n\nAhsoka – 5,000\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett – 2,500\n\nRebels – 2,000\n\nAgain, we are on week three of The Acolyte, just halfway through the series, and we’ve reached these numbers. And of course the intent is to drive down the user score as low as possible. It’s down to 13%, miles below everything else, even The Last Jedi, even the Star Wars Holiday Special when its biggest controversies have been an as-of-yet-unresolved mention of the force-sensitive twins not having a father, and Ki-Adi-Mundi’s birthdate which was altered from the non-canon EU.\n\nYou can also head over to IMDB where the show’s 3.3/10 reveals similar data. A full 58% of its 66,000 reviews have given it one star.\n\nI’ve been called a defender of the show for covering this movement against the series, though honestly, I think it’s “just okay.” So far, I’d put it above Boba Fett and Obi-Wan, but probably not the others. But I also think it’s important to point out what’s going on here and not let this enormously exhausting and loud toxic part of the fanbase gaslight everyone into thinking this is just truly the worst thing Star Wars has ever produced and it’s not being review bombed. I have never in my life seen a more textbook definition of review bombing, and the way this has escalated into a protest metric, driven by forums and rage-farming YouTubers has gotten absolutely insane. Rotten Tomatoes changed their user-score policies when this happened to a much lesser extent to Captain Marvel, requiring verified viewing before scoring. But they have been unable to come up with a similar system for TV, so here we are.\n\nThis hate is not just about low numbers, it’s about racism, misogyny and overall harassment of the cast which has poisoned every conversation about this show and exemplifies every horrible impulse of these so-called fans over this entire Disney era. You can like or not like things, sure. This is a different level, and is getting more and more inexcusable as time goes on.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, Threads, YouTube, and Instagram."
