She received praise for her standout cinematography on director Todd Haynes’ Poison and Velvet Goldmine (for which she earned her first Indie Spirit Best Cinematography Award) and the hard-hitting drama Happiness for indie provocateur Todd Solondz.\n\nAdditionally, she has lensed several acclaimed documentaries with her long-time collaborator Alex Gibney: We Steal Secrets, about Wikileaks founder Julian Assange; The Armstrong Lie, an official selection for the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival; and Casino Jack and the United States of Money.
