        "text": "New York, NY (June 18, 2024) – The New York Asian Film Foundation and Film at Lincoln Center (FLC) have announced the second round of programming and award honorees for the 23rd edition of the New York Asian Film Festival (NYAFF), taking place July 12–22 at FLC, and from July 22–28 at the SVA Theatre, with special weekend screenings and one-night-only programming from July 13–15, 18–21, and 23–25 at LOOK Cinemas W57, as well as a special collaborative presentation of hit films at the Korean Cultural Center New York on July 13– 27.\n\nThis year’s NYAFF features more than 90 new and classic titles from China, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Mongolia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and beyond, with nine world premieres, 12 international premieres, and 38 North American premieres.\n\nNYAFF is thrilled to unveil the eight titles nominated for this year’s Uncaged Award for Best Feature Film Competition, which shines a spotlight on filmmakers whose singular visions deserve to be internationally heralded. This section is a celebration of passion, imagination, and the willingness to take risks: These are the filmmakers to watch, the ones who are bending and rewriting the rules and creating something new and exciting.\n\nThe nominated directors will join us in New York for the announcement of the Uncaged winners, selected by a jury composed of young, prominent, and up-and-coming figures from the film industry bridging Asia and the United States: Tony Bui (director, Three Seasons), Shao-yi Chen (producer, Screenworks Asia), Shaina Magdayao (Filipino actress, Essential Truths of the Lake), Felix Tsang (Sales & Acquisitions Manager, Golden Scene), Nonkul Chanon Santinatornkul (Thai actor, Bad Genius), and Aliza Ma (Head of Programming, the Criterion Channel).\n\nThe Uncaged Award nominees, made by talented first- and second-time directors and other unsung auteurs who have flown under the radar of the international awards and festival circuit, are: The Escaping Man (Wang Yichun, China), a satire of class, ambition, and moral turpitude that tells the story of a lovelorn ex-con, a kidnapping gone wrong, and an unusual boy caught in a storm of happenstance; Frankenstein Father (Choi Jea-young, South Korea), a morality play about identity and survival that explores the ramifications of perfectionism and the age-old conundrum of nature vs. nurture; How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies (Pat Boonnitipat, Thailand), a pan-Asian box-office smash starring superstar Billkin as a slacker who quits his job to become his grandma’s caregiver—whether she likes it or not; Ichiko (Akihiro Toda, Japan), an enigmatic, Rashomon-like puzzle box that gradually unravels the shocking reality of its central character; Snow in Midsummer (Chong Keat Aun, Malaysia/Taiwan/Singapore), a meditation on a tragedy that still scars the soul of a nation; Suffocating Love (Liao Ming-yi, Taiwan), a dizzying, disorienting plunge into the rabbit hole of modern romance shot entirely on an iPhone; Trouble Girl (Chin Chia-Hua, Taiwan), a tumultuous drama exploring the complex bonds between a mother and her neurodiverse daughter (Audrey Lin in an award-winning role); and Women from Rote Island (Jeremias Nyangoen, Indonesia), a genre-defying piece that is part ethnographic doc, part sexual-violence drama, and part stinging indictment of the patriarchal structures that make life a horror story for many women.\n\nAs previously announced, the festival will honor a handful of Asia’s brightest luminaries with this year’s NYAFF awards. These stars will bring glitz and glamor to our stage with in-person Q&A sessions.\n\nHonorees include Hong Kong’s own renaissance man, Nicholas Tse, a triple threat and then some—actor, singer, songwriter, entrepreneur, and even a TV chef—who has been dazzling audiences with his acting chops and his action moves for two decades. He’ll receive the festival’s top honor, the Screen International Star Asia Award, co-presented with the generous support of Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in New York (HKETONY). In Herman Yau’s explosive new thriller, Customs Frontline, Tse is a powder-keg customs officer caught in a deadly web of arms smuggling. Tse will present the North American premiere of the film, which also marks his debut as action choreographer.\n\nScreen International Rising Star Asia Award winner Lee Hye-ri will take the stage to receive her award and present the NYAFF opening film, Victory. She first burst onto the scene as a member of the K-pop group Girl’s Day, but she has been making waves in the acting world since her debut in 2012. Her first leading film role was in the period action horror Monstrum, which won the audience award at the Sitges Film Festival in 2018.\n\nBest from the East Award honoree Kento Yamazaki headlines the thunderous newest chapter of Shinsuke Sato’s globally acclaimed Kingdom franchise, Kingdom: Return of the Great General, a maelstrom of clashing swords, deafening cavalry charges, and Machiavellian court intrigue. Yamazaki is magnetic as the ascendant warrior Shin, cementing the young actor’s status as a bona fide superstar. ​​Yamazaki made his acting debut in 2010 and quickly worked his way to the top of the box office, proving his staggering versatility in a range of roles, including Arisu in the Netflix series Alice in Borderland, whose third season is shooting soon.\n\nLegendary Hong Kong actor Tai Bo, this year’s Star Asia Lifetime Achievement Award honoree, has turned in luminous performances in many of the biggest recent Hong Kong hits: The Brink (NYAFF 2017), Hand Rolled Cigarette (NYAFF 2020), The Silent Forest (NYAFF 2020), and Coffin Homes (NYAFF 2021). Beginning his career in Hong Kong at the age of 18, Tai Bo initially worked behind the scenes in various capacities before transitioning into an award-winning acting career. Tai Bo will join us for Ray Yeung’s Berlin Teddy Award-winning All Shall Be Well and his landmark 2015 film Twilight’s Kiss (Suk Suk), as well as for the world premiere of Chow Kam Wing’s For Alice.\n\nThe recipient of the 2024 Daniel A. Craft Award for Excellence in Action Cinema is Japan’s own enfant terrible of the hit man–comedy genre, Yugo Sakamoto. This action wunderkind, winner of numerous awards for his ultra-high-octane flicks, will be joining executive producer Yusuke Suzuki to present the world premiere of the adrenaline-fueled extravaganza, Baby Assassins: Nice Days. Sakamoto, along with action maestro Kensuke Sonomura, has cranked the dial up to 11 for the latest chapter in this killer series.\n\nAdditional titles in NYAFF’s Hong Kong lineup include the action-packed, heart-tugging drama from Ip Man screenwriter Chan Tai-Lee, Fight for Tomorrow, about a reformed gangster and repentant father (Patrick Tam) on a go-for-broke journey to reclaim a brighter tomorrow; and The Lyricist Wannabe, the new film from Norris Wong (My Prince Edward, NYAFF 2019), a dynamic ode to chasing one’s dream in the cutthroat music industry.\n\nA series of dazzling debuts from China have been added to the lineup, including Gao Peng’s A Long Shot, a scandalous take on the human toll of ’90s economic reform; Lin Jianjie’s Brief History of a Family, a stunning psycho-thriller that slices open the façade of post-one-child-policy China; Liang Ming’s Carefree Days, a poignant exploration of resilience in the face of despair; Li Kuo and Shan Dandan’s Galaxy Writer, a hilarious, postmodernist deconstruction of screenwriting; and Marc Ma’s Wolf Hiding, an action extravaganza pitting an evil conglomerate against a lone-wolf assassin. Plus, the late, great Pema Tseden’s (Jinpa, NYAFF 2019) fantastical final masterwork, Snow Leopard, brings a metaphorical/metaphysical clash on the Tibetan steppe.\n\nTreasures from Southeast Asia show this region is redefining genres. First-time feature filmmaker Nelicia Low will debut her thriller Pierce, inspired by a true story on the Taipei subway and her relationship with her autistic brother, starring Golden Horse Award winner Ding Ning, Taipei Film Festival honoree Tsao Yu-Ning, and breakout talent Liu Hsiu-Fu.\n\nGems from the Philippines include: Granny Prostitutes, a rousing ensemble piece following aging courtesans who swear like sailors but maintain their dignity against all odds; The Missing, an animated masterpiece that explores harrowing themes as a young man attempts to overcome his trauma or completely lose himself; and When This Is All Over, a kaleidoscopic stoner comedy set during the COVID lockdown that’s equal parts hilarious and poignant, with director Kevin Mayuga in New York to present the North American premiere of this mind-bending masterpiece.\n\nFrom Indonesia, Respati is an organically creepy tale of vengeful witches, folk magic curses, supernatural serial killings, and adolescent dream warriors. From Malaysia, Adrian Teh’s Reversi is a tender love story slash cautionary tale that explores just how far a man would go if given the opportunity to rewrite the past. And from Mongolia comes the remarkable directorial debut City of Wind, which follows a 17-year-old shaman living near Ulaanbaatar, who is smitten by a young client and sets off on a bittersweet journey of emotional, cultural, and spiritual discoveries.\n\nFrom Korea, an addition to the Prime Picks – South Korea section is Lee Jong-Pil’s action thriller Escape, following the struggles of a North Korean sergeant attempting to defect while being chased by a ruthless major.\n\nOscar-nominated Taiwanese American director Sean Wang brings his Sundance hit Dìdi (弟弟) to New York. This captivating dramedy about a young teen who spends his California summer chasing a girl (sort of), ruining friendships, fighting with his mom (Joan Chen), and discovering his calling is a testament to the power of diverse voices and authentic storytelling, one that proves that Asian American stories are American stories, and deserve to be told on the big screen.\n\nNYAFF’s classics section includes two standout restorations of transcendent works: Vietnamese American director Tony Bui’s Three Seasons sets three transcendent stories in postwar Ho Chi Minh City, in a 4K restoration never before screened in New York; and straight from this year’s Cannes, the 40th anniversary 4K restoration of Tsui Hark’s romantic comedy Shanghai Blues follows the fated-to-be-together Shu (Sylvia Chang) and Tung (Kenny Bee) as they meet in wartime and then fail to recognize one another when their paths cross again 10 years later.\n\nAlong with the many major names already mentioned, NYAFF is delighted to welcome many creative forces from across Asia and the diaspora to meet the audience in New York, including actors Jake Choi and James Chen, who are reuniting to present their 2015 film Front Cover, Filmmaker in Focus Ray Yeung’s evocative tale of love, identity, and cultural collision. Japanese director Nobuhiro Yamashita (Linda, Linda, Linda; La La La at Rock Bottom) will make an all-too-rare appearance to present his spirited new musical, Let’s Go Karaoke!; NYAFF stalwart Kazuya Shiraishi (Twisted Justice, The Blood of Wolves) will return for the first time since 2016 with his first-ever jidaigeki, Bushido; and producer and special effects director Daisuke Sato will share tales of making the “first and last film” by 88-year-old Keizo Murase, the legendary kaiju suit maker, stuntman, and tokusatsu wizard.\n\nA jury composed of filmmaker Patrick Chen, actor Perry Yung, and academic Zhang Zhen will be in attendance to select the award winners from among NYAFF’s greatly expanded Shorts Showcase selections, which now comprise four thematically organized programs. Shorts Program 1: The Animals That Therefore We Are highlights seven superlative shorts exploring and reconfiguring the relationship between humankind and animals, with a lineup that includes The Horse, starring Taiwanese singer-songwriter-actress Mavis Fan (The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate); Bottle George, from Oscar-nominated director Daisuke ‘Dice’ Tsutsumi (The Dam Keeper) and cowriter Akihiro Nishino (Poupelle of Chimney Town); and The Boys and the Donkey, executive produced by Tibetan auteur Pema Tseden (Snow Leopard).\n\nShorts Program 2: Echoes of Her Longing features six dynamic works that expand the boundaries of Asian female representation on the silver screen, including the international premiere of On a Boat, starring Kiyohiko Shibukawa (Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy) and Ryo Matsuura (December). Shorts Program 3: Ode to Youth boasts seven formally innovative shorts that offer unique perspectives on different facets of youth culture in China, with a lineup that includes the Berlin award winner A Summer’s End Poem and Fire of Last Night in Yimi’s Woods, with original music by Hualun (An Elephant Sitting Still). Shorts Program 4: Defiance Redefined, highlights six Korean and Korean diasporic short films featuring unorthodox characters taking bold moves to rewrite their destinies. The lineup includes Seoul Switch, starring Korean American singer-songwriter Kevin Woo, and Layover, starring Young Mazino (Beef).\n\nNYAFF will celebrate Opening Night on July 12 with its iconic Opening Night Market, featuring live music and Asian food stalls serving scrumptious delights. The popular Matsuri Night event takes place July 23, with screenings of Japanese films, Japanese music, and Japanese delicacies.\n\nThere will also be essential panel discussions on filmmaking in Thailand, the status of U.S. distribution of Asian films, and crafting short films, with leading filmmakers and industry members on hand to share their experiences in the film industry and offer insights into their creative processes (participants to be announced).\n\nClosing Night will conclude this year’s festival with celebrities walking the red carpet before an awards ceremony and the North American premiere of Twilight of the Warriors: Walled In, Soi Cheang’s adrenaline-fueled paeon to the glory days of Hong Kong action cinema. As previously announced, producer John Chong and actor Philip Ng will be in attendance for a rousing closing to NYAFF 2024.\n\nThe New York Asian Film Festival is co-presented by the New York Asian Film Foundation and Film at Lincoln Center.\n\nNYAFF is curated by executive director Samuel Jamier, associate director Claire Marty, programmers David Wilentz, Karen Severns, Koichi Mori, Thailand expert Donsaron Kovitvanitcha and China Region Consultant Dana Fukazawa; the short film program is curated by Elliot Gong.\n\nFULL LINEUP BY SECTION (94 films)*\n\n(*Please note the program is still subject to change.)\n\nOPENING FILM\n\nVictory | dir.

Launched in 2002, the festival showcases a wildly diverse lineup of singular titles each year, ranging from mainstream blockbusters and art-house eccentricities to genre and cult classics. It was the first North American film festival to champion the works of Johnnie To, Bong Joon Ho, Park Chan-wook, Takashi Miike, and other auteurs of contemporary Asian cinema. Notable festival guests have included Lee Byung-hun, Ryoo Seung-wan, Masami Nagasawa, Sammo Hung, Lee Jung-jae, and Jackie Chan.
