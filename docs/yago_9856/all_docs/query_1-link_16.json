Besides his own BLUE IN THE FACE, the only other film Keitel has ever produced was RESERVOIR DOGS... The guy does know powerful material when he sees it. The director Tony Bui won some awards a whiles back for a short film called YELLOW LOTUS which I saw on the festival circuit around 3 or so years ago. This guy is someone to watch, very powerful filmmaking abilities. Let's hope we hear more on this film.\n\nHarry, Been with you for a couple of years now on a daily basis. Wanted to let you know about a glorious film I saw at the Sundance Film Festival Saturday called Three Seasons. Feel free to post my review on your site.\n\nBefore the film started, a very young and nervous director named Tony Bui announced that this would be the first real screening of the picture, after a few gracious thank you's, the lights went down. The movie takes place in Vietnam and weaves together the lives of four characters: a young boy of around 10 who hocks trinkets on the streets, a girl who harvests lotus flowers from the ponds around a temple, a cyclo driver in love with a prostitute, and a former GI trying to resolve a relationship he had while in the service. >From the opening scene and throughout the entire film, this was one of the most beautifully shot films I have seen. Each shot is filled with incredible colors and stunning backdrops. The characters of the film take you through realistic scenarios from the lives of the poor working class, letting you into their private conversations and thoughts in an honest manner. (I was in the Philippines for two years and it took me back to Southeast Asia like nothing else ever has) The film is subtitled, but after a minute, you never think about it again because the characters and their stories are so engaging. With the exception of Harvey Keitel, all of the actors are unknowns and each of them deliver very powerful performances. The story deals with the desperation of poverty, quelling personal demons, and redemption, and does so in a manner that forces some introspection. The last 15 minutes of the film were some of the most stirring pieces of cinema I have ever seen. Many tears were flowing from people sitting around my wife and I, and after the closing scene, while the credits rolled, the audience applauded for five minutes. This will definitely win some awards, and I would love see it reach into American mainstream, though I know as a nation, we don't love subtitled films here. This is one I am recommending to everyone , it is a true masterpiece of independent film.\n\nOne of the Texas Playboys\n\nP.S. Saw David Carradine, Harry Belafonte, Aidan Quinn, John Huston, among others."
