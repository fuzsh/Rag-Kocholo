        "text": "Fret not after that tumultuous Bridgerton season 2 finale: Lady Whistledown will write again. Netflix announced way back on April 13, 2021, that it had already renewed the dazzling period romance for both a third and fourth season, just as the highly anticipated second season began filming in the U.K.\n\nBridgerton, based on a series of eight novels (and multiple “epilogues”) written by Julia Quinn and adapted for Netflix by Shonda Rhimes’ Shondaland productions, follows the Bridgerton family, comprised of widowed matriarch Violet (Ruth Gemmell) and her eight children, as they seek marriage matches in Regency England’s high society. The first season, which premiered Dec. 25, 2020, broke Netflix viewing records as it followed eldest daughter Daphne’s (Phoebe Dynevor) search for a husband, and her unexpected connection with the dashing Simon Basset, Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page). Season 2 then tackled the second book in the series, honing in on eldest brother Anthony (Jonathan Bailey)’s enemies-to-lovers romance with the foolhardy Kate Sharma (Simone Ashley).\n\n“Bridgerton swept us off our feet,” Netflix VP of Global TV Bela Bajaria said in a statement when seasons 3 and 4 were first announced. “The creative team, led by Shonda, knew the material and delivered a beautiful, emotional, romantic drama for our members. They have some exciting plans for the future, and we think audiences will continue to swoon for this show. We’re planning to be in the Bridgerton business for a long time to come.”\n\nAfter a finale that ended in marital bliss for Anthony and Kate but stinging deception for Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and her best friend, Eloise Bridgerton (Claudia Jessie), here’s what we know about what could come next.\n\nWhen will Bridgerton season 3 come out?\n\nSeason 3 will finally land in 2024. Netflix announced in December 2023 that the eight-episode third chapter will drop in two parts, with the first four episodes premiering on May 16, 2024, and the next four on June 13. You can watch the official trailer below.\n\nWho will the season focus on?\n\nBridgerton season 3 will focus on Penelope, aka Lady Whistledown (Nicola Coughlan), and Colin Bridgerton’s (Luke Newton) romance, Coughlan first confirmed during the FYSEE panel on May 2022, per Variety.\n\nIn an official synopsis released later, Netflix revealed that:\n\n“Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) has finally given up on her long-held crush on Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton) after hearing his disparaging words about her last season. She has, however, decided it’s time to take a husband, preferably one who will provide her with enough independence to continue her double life as Lady Whistledown, far away from her mother and sisters. But lacking in confidence, Penelope’s attempts on the marriage mart fail spectacularly. Meanwhile, Colin has returned from his summer travels with a new look and a serious sense of swagger. But he’s disheartened to realize that Penelope, the one person who always appreciated him as he was, is giving him the cold shoulder. Eager to win back her friendship, Colin offers to mentor Penelope in the ways of confidence to help her find a husband this season. But when his lessons start working a little too well, Colin must grapple with whether his feelings for Penelope are truly just friendly. Complicating matters for Penelope is her rift with Eloise (Claudia Jessie), who has found a new friend in a very unlikely place, while Penelope’s growing presence in the ton makes it all the more difficult to keep her Lady Whistledown alter ego a secret.”\n\nThis direction marks a departure from the order of Quinn's books; in the written series, the next Bridgerton to get the lead treatment is Benedict (Luke Thompson), who takes center stage in . The story pulls heavily from Cinderella lore: Benedict falls for one Sophie Beckett, an earl’s daughter forced into servitude by her hateful stepmother. The Colin-focused book, Romancing Mr. Bridgerton, is fourth in the line-up.\n\nWhy will Colin and Penelope be the center of season 3?\n\nJess Brownell, who will succeed Chris Van Dusen as showrunner for season 3, explained the change in chronology to Variety in 2022. “I really feel like it’s Colin and Penelope’s time. Because we’ve been watching both of these actors on our screens since season 1, we’ve already invested in them a little bit. We know who they are as people,” she said. “I feel like, especially in the last season, there are these moments of tension between them where it’s like, Colin walks up to the line of almost realizing that Penelope has feelings for him but doesn’t quite get there. Instead of treading water on that dynamic, we wanted to push it into their season. It really felt like the perfect moment to tee it up.”\n\nCoughlan already knew about the season 3 plans since “two weeks into filming season 2,” she told E! News, “so I had a lot of time to adjust to it.”\n\nAs for why it’s taken as long as it has for the two friends to share their feelings, Newton said in an official Netflix clip that he thinks “there’s a lot going on where they can’t really see what’s right in front of them.”\n\nWhat else will season 3 be about?\n\nApart from the romance at its focal point, season 3 will delve deeper into its juicy subplots as well. At the end of season 2, Eloise had finally learned her best friend’s identity as Lady Whistledown; Jessie promises the fallout is unlikely to dissipate any time soon. She told ELLE.com, “I think Eloise won’t tell anyone [Penelope’s secret]. I think Eloise will continue to be a good mate and not tell anyone, because what does Eloise gain, really? I do think they’ll make up, but I don’t think it’s going to happen quickly.”\n\nAt the New York premiere of Bridgerton season 3, Coughlin shared a little more about her character’s friendship with Eloise, calling it a “real journey.”\n\n“Julia Quinn says that one of her favorite love stories in the show is Penelope and Eloise, and it’s mine too,” she told Deadline. “She has two great loves in her life. And certainly in my life, my female friends have been some of my biggest love stories. They’re the people that mean so much to me, and they are so much the reason you are who you are.”\n\nCoughlin also explained that although Eloise may not be ready to forgive, Penelope wants to take that step.\n\n“Penelope is ready to say sorry, but Eloise is not there,” she said. “So you really go through it with them.”\n\nJessie also chimed in at the premiere, explaining how the two friends are still “at odds” due to Penelope’s secret and the hurt that Eloise feels.\n\nCoughlin also touched on the “steamy scenes” that take place between Penelope and Colin.\n\n“I was intimidated at first, then super happy to read them, super thrilled when we filmed them, and even more thrilled when I watched them,” she said. “They were even better than I expected ’cause they’re beautiful. They’re funny, they’re smart, they’re sexy, they’re suspenseful…they’re everything, I’m super proud.”\n\nShowrunner Jess Brownell told Entertainment Tonight, “If we’re asking about steamy scenes, it’s off the chart. Because these two have been friends for so long, there is that connection already, there’s a lot of depth, and it allowed us to really take things a little more quickly with the intimacy.”\n\n“Worth the wait,” Harriet Cains (Philippa Featherington) added. “It’s the sexiest thing, yeah. There’s so much sex—I'm just gonna say it like that.”\n\n“It’s so beautiful, it’s really romantic, it’s really funny, it’s very suspenseful,” Coughlin told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nNewton also spoke about his character’s relationship with Penelope with Deadline. He compared them to Rachel and Ross from Friends, saying, “They’re perfect for each other but it never quite works out. There’s always some sort of obstacle, and that’s what we really explore this season. It’s not only Colin that doesn’t see what’s right in front of him, there’s an obstacle for both of [the characters] at all times. So it’s really complicated.”\n\n“Colin and Penelope are underdogs in many ways,” Brownell said during a Bridgerton fan event on Feb. 14, 2024. She added, “We get to see these characters step into their powers this year.” She teased that the season will include “classic rom-com tropes” and “a lot of awkward banter.”\n\nShonda Rhimes, meanwhile, teased, “We do have some very interesting new characters.” That includes a new suitor for Penelope, Lord Debling (played by Sam Phillips), who creates some tension between her and Colin.\n\nThings are also changing outside the leading pair. Will Mondrich (Martins Imhangbe) and his family, for example, are facing some new challenges. “Will and Alice are literally drawn out of the shadows and they inherit a new title,” Imhangbe said. We’re bound to see how these changes affect the family dynamic.\n\nLady Danbury goes on a personal journey of her own: Actress Adjoa Andoh teased, “With the arrival that happens, are they going to knock me off my game, are they going to put cracks into my carefully constructed facade?” She added, “You see Lady Danbury on the back foot slightly… slightly not in control of her emotions.”\n\nThe Featheringtons as a whole will also be tested. Every family has set roles, and “when people step out of those roles, it can throw people into chaos,” Brownell hinted. Penelope’s stepping out of her role, and stepping away from the family’s citrus color palette, will cause “absolute drama” with her mother and sisters, Brownell added.\n\n“Season 3 is for all us wallflowers,” Andoh said. Rhimes echoed those feelings. “This season really leans into the idea of telling those untold stories. You get to see what’s going on emotionally with the adult ladies in the show. And it brings people into this world even more,” she said.\n\nWho is in the cast?\n\nAfter Page famously departed Bridgerton following his season 1 run, citing his completed arc and one-season commitment to the series, many fans might be wondering if Bailey, Ashley, and other new favorites will return for the third season. Thankfully, Ashley confirmed to Deadline that both she and Bailey plan to participate. “We’re going to be back! Kate and Anthony are just getting started,” she told the outlet, adding, “I’d like to see Kate just let go a bit more and play more in season 3 and kind of swim in that circle of love together. I think they both deserve it.”\n\nIn an interview with BAFTA on March 2, 2024, Bailey admitted that he won’t be going anywhere anytime soon. “I look forward to supporting the rest of the family and the stories that go forward because if there’s one thing I know about beloved worlds, it’s that you want to see them through, and people invest their love and their time, and it means so much to so many people,” Bailey said.\n\n“So, yeah. Me and Tony will be together for a while,” Bailey added, referencing his character, Anthony Bridgerton.\n\nBut expect plenty of newcomers as well. Hannah Dodd (Anatomy of a Scandal) has been cast as Francesca Bridgerton for season 3, replacing actress Ruby Stokes, who exited to work on Netflix’s upcoming Lockwood & Co. series. Variety reported the news on May 12, following the character’s noticeable absence in the second season. “I love Francesca, but we lost her midway through season 2,” Chris Van Dusen previously told TVLine. “After exhausting all other options, she unfortunately had to come out due to reasons beyond our control.”\n\nNetflix also announced multiple other new additions to the season 3 cast, including: Daniel Francis (Stay Close), who will play Marcus Anderson; Sam Phillips (The Crown), who will play Lord Debling; James Phoon (Wreck), who will play Harry Dankworth; and Hannah New (Black Sails), who will play Lady Tilley Arnold, “a firebrand widow,” per Deadline.\n\nIs Regé-Jean Page coming back as Simon?\n\nSadly, no. Shortly after rumors bubbled up saying Page would return to reprise his role as the Duke of Hastings, the actor himself put speculation to rest with an Instagram post on June 21, 2022. In it, he posed with his former co-star Bailey and wrote in the caption: “The boys are back in town. ❤️ (No, I’m not going back to the show btw - the papers made that one up.) But we had the best, and most stylish, catch up I’ve had in a while over some truly excellent Italian coffee and sunshine ☕️.”\n\nPage later added that he'd be okay with Netflix recasting his former role: “They’re free to do as they like,” he said.\n\nCan I see more photos of season 3?\n\nThe cast first treated fans to a behind-the-scenes sneak peek on July 20, 2022, confirming that production was officially underway in London. “Bridgerton season 3 filming has officially begun,” Coughlan says in the quick montage, as Newton joins her in a carriage on set.\n\nSoon after, Ashley and Bailey shared a set photo of their hands interlocked. Both of them wrote “reunited” over their posts, with Bailey hashtagging the photo #kanthony.\n\nFinally, during Netflix’s annual TUDUM event in 2023, the cast of season 3 shared that the first episode, written by Brownell and directed by Tricia Brock, would be titled “Out of the Shadows.” Coughlan then read the first few lines of what appears to be season 3’s opening monologue: “Dearest Gentle Reader, we’ve been apart for far too long. At last, London’s smart set has made its return, and so, too, has This Author. As the season begins, the question on everyone’s minds is, of course: Which newly minted debutante will shine the brightest? The crop this year appears to be rather dazzling indeed. Unfortunately, not every young lady can attract the light.”\n\nCoughlan and Newton later shared more BTS shots on Instagram, too.\n\nDuring the Tudum event in Brazil, Netflix shared the first photos of Penelope and Colin in Bridgerton season 3. Coughlan explained that the images show Penelope's “new look” and that this will be “quite the scandalous season.” Check out the photos below.\n\nIn December, Entertainment Weekly shared a photo showing Penelope and Eloise are at least talking again in the new season, even if their friendship isn't completely repaired.\n\n“I'm rooting for them,” showrunner Jess Brownell said of the development. “Bridgerton is about love in its many forms, and that includes friendship. The breakup between two friends can be just as earth shattering as a romantic relationship. For Penn, it is extremely difficult. But it's also a chance for the two of them to grow and learn about themselves without that safety net of always having their best friend around.”\n\nDuring a Bridgerton fan event on February 14 (Valentine’s Day), Netflix shared even mrore new photos from the upcoming season.\n\nHow many episodes will comprise season 3?\n\nThere will be eight episodes in season 3. Netflix shared the titles below:"
