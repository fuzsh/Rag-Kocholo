        "text": "Ted Lasso was one of my favorite series of all time. It was so sweet and funny, and after three seasons, it just ended way too soon.\n\nFans hoped for the show to continue, but star and co-creator Jason Sudeikis made it clear that he had set out to make a three season story.\n\nThere was talk of possible spinoffs, and the series finale left open many possibilities, but we haven’t heard anything else, until now.\n\nCo-creator Bill Lawrence has opened up about a potential season 4 of the sports comedy-drama, and he told Collider that it’s all up to Jason Sudeikis:\n\n“Whatever Jason feels like doing and whatever his decision is, we’re all down with it. Not only is he the star, he’s the head writer, and he’s also the dude whose life just has to be completely overhauled and moved to a foreign country with young children. It’s a big deal. So, as a fan, if someone’s like, ‘Oh, it’s gonna happen again,’ I’ll go nuts. As a partner, I’m down for whatever he wants to do.”\n\nTed Lasso, which ran for three seasons on Apple TV+, concluded its run in 2023. In June of this year, Warner Bros. TV boss Channing Dungey discussed the possibility of a fourth season of the series or a spinoff set in the Ted Lasso universe.\n\n“I think Jason Sudeikis is open to the idea, but I think he wants to have the right idea, which I appreciate it. We at Warner Bros appreciate, Apple appreciates, because it’s the sort of thing where you don’t want to go do more, just for the sake of more, you want to go do more, because you actually have something to say, you have a story that you want to tell. We’ll see what happens.”\n\nI would love to see Ted Lasso continue! But only with everyone on board having a clear vision for the future of the series. Do you think we will see more of the series in the future?"
