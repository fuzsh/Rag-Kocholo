        "text": "Nobody can accuse Zoe Bui of being lazy. The twentysomething Vietnamese- American is three weeks away from getting her master’s degree in film at the University of Southern California, she’s just landed a job directing, writing and producing for a California cable-TV station, she’s working on a screenplay, she’s directed two documentaries, she sings in ethnic-music videos and she’s doing a bit of songwriting.\n\nBut, most of all, Zoe Bui has visions of an acting career.\n\n‘I’ve wanted to act ever since I was young,” she breathlessly tells us over the phone. ‘If everything works out for acting, I’d be on cloud nine.”\n\nJudging by Bui’s first major screen role, as a beautiful hooker in ‘Three Seasons,” she shouldn’t have trouble fulfilling her dream. (Her only other movie appearance, a bit part in Kathryn Bigelow’s ‘Strange Days,’ didn’t make the final cut.)\n\n‘Three Seasons,” a U.S. indie shot in Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon), traces the intertwined lives of five people in the steamy metropolis.\n\nThe film is in Vietnamese, and all but one of the lead actors is a native of that country. The exception is Harvey Keitel, who plays an American looking for his grown daughter.\n\nShooting the film – written and directed by another Vietnamese-American, Tony Bui (no relation) – marked the first time Zoe had been to her homeland since she left it as a child in 1975, near the end of the war.\n\nShe grew up in Bristol, Pa., living with her mother, her grandmother and five of her 16 brothers and sisters. She studied at Yale, then moved to California to pursue a medical degree.\n\n‘But I took one documentary-filmmaking class at USC, fell in love with movies and switched to film school.” She’s never regretted her decision.\n\nn ‘Three Seasons,” which opens Friday, depicts a Saigon in the throes of Westernization. Giant signs for Mobil and Coca Cola tower over busy streets, tourists flock to luxury hotels, modern cabs compete with traditional cyclos (bicycle rickshaws) and plastic flowers are replacing the live ones that women sell on the street.\n\n‘But things aren’t as Americanized as you might think,” Zoe reports. ‘Saigon is in a state of transition. There’s the Coke sign, but a lot of people there can’t even afford a Coke. People are still listening to their Vietnamese operas and eating their Vietnamese food. I still see a lot of Vietnamese culture all over the place.”\n\nn As for the war that devastated her homeland, Zoe has only faint recollections.\n\n‘I have flashes of memories of running in the street, and pressing against a wall with my grandmother, and gunfire, and a burning building, and a helicopter.”\n\nWould she want to live in Vietnam again?\n\n‘I’ve grown up in America, and I think your home is where you grew up. I could go back and forth, but I wouldn’t stay in Vietnam forever. I feel more comfortable here.”\n\nV.A. Musetto is film editor of The Post. He can be e-mailed at vam@nypost.com"
