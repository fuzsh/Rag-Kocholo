        "text": "The Throwaways have been sent into action.\n\nDirector Tony Bui‘s thriller, which began streaming on Crackle Friday, tells the story of a hacker (Sam Huntington) who is forced to work for the CIA and forms a team of renegades to help capture some of the agency’s most dangerous targets.\n\nThe hacker thriller, executive produced by Jeremy Renner, was delayed by more than a month in light of the cyberattack on Crackle’s parent company, Sony Pictures Entertainment. (You can watch the full movie for free at Crackle.)\n\nRenner says he never had a problem with the delay. The movie also stars James Caan, Kevin Dillon and Katie McGrath.\n\nWatch more It’s Hulk vs. Iron Man in New ‘Avengers: Age of Ultron’ Teaser Trailer\n\n“It’s not like this had a huge movie premiere,” Renner tells The Hollywood Reporter. “I didn’t have a problem with the delay. The travesty of all that is what happened with Sony.”\n\nRenner and his producing partner at The Combine, Don Handfield, conceived of the project as a TV series and says it potentially could continue on Crackle in that form.\n\n“There’s nothing traditional about technology because it changes so fast. It grows faster than we can really understand, so it’s nice to get onboard a platform like this,” says Renner. “For me personally, the Netflixes and the Crackles of the world are how I watch stuff because I don’t have a regular schedule. ”\n\nSee more Sundance: Exclusive Photos of Kristen Wiig, Jack Black, Ethan Hawke and More\n\nRenner has two tentpoles out this summer, with Avengers: Age of Ultron bowing May 1 and Mission Impossible 5 hitting theaters July 31.\n\n“I was punched in the face, kicked in stomach,” says Renner of his recent days of shooting Mission: Impossible 5 in London.\n\nHis other big film, Age of Ultron, is arguably the summer’s most anticipated. Among the biggest revelations Avengers fans are clamoring for is a glimpse of The Vision (Paul Bettany), who has not appeared in the trailers. Renner is in the dark too.\n\n“I haven’t seen him,” admits Renner. “I kind of keep my head turned away from all of that so I can be surprised when I see the movie. Obviously I saw Paul Bettany in person as the character, but then they do the visual effects and all that sort of stuff. It will be a surprise to everybody in the movie — Ultron as well as Vision, because those characters were so much generated stuff.”"
