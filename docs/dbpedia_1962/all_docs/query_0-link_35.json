        "text": "Fluorescent marker-based and marker-free discrimination between healthy and cancerous human tissues using hyper-spectral imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nArnold, Thomas; De Biasio, Martin; Leitner, Raimund\n\n2015-06-01\n\nTwo problems are addressed in this paper (i) the fluorescent marker-based and the (ii) marker-free discrimination between healthy and cancerous human tissues. For both applications the performance of hyper-spectral methods are quantified. Fluorescent marker-based tissue classification uses a number of fluorescent markers to dye specific parts of a human cell. The challenge is that the emission spectra of the fluorescent dyes overlap considerably. They are, furthermore disturbed by the inherent auto-fluorescence of human tissue. This results in ambiguities and decreased image contrast causing difficulties for the treatment decision. The higher spectral resolution introduced by tunable-filter-based spectral imaging in combination with spectral unmixing techniques results in an improvement of the image contrast and therefore more reliable information for the physician to choose the treatment decision. Marker-free tissue classification is based solely on the subtle spectral features of human tissue without the use of artificial markers. The challenge in this case is that the spectral differences between healthy and cancerous tissues are subtle and embedded in intra- and inter-patient variations of these features. The contributions of this paper are (i) the evaluation of hyper-spectral imaging in combination with spectral unmixing techniques for fluorescence marker-based tissue classification, (ii) the evaluation of spectral imaging for marker-free intra surgery tissue classification. Within this paper, we consider real hyper-spectral fluorescence and endoscopy data sets to emphasize the practical capability of the proposed methods. It is shown that the combination of spectral imaging with multivariate statistical methods can improve the sensitivity and specificity of the detection and the staging of cancerous tissues compared to standard procedures.\n\nTumor Endothelial Marker Imaging in Melanomas Using Dual-Tracer Fluorescence Molecular Imaging\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTichauer, Kenneth M.; Deharvengt, Sophie J.; Samkoe, Kimberley S.; Gunn, Jason R.; Bosenberg, Marcus W.; Turk, Mary-Jo; Hasan, Tayyaba; Stan, Radu V.; Pogue, Brian W.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nPurpose Cancer-specific endothelial markers available for intravascular binding are promising targets for new molecular therapies. In this study, a molecular imaging approach of quantifying endothelial marker concentrations (EMCI) is developed and tested in highly light-absorbing melanomas. The approach involves injection of targeted imaging tracer in conjunction with an untargeted tracer, which is used to account for nonspecific uptake and tissue optical property effects on measured targeted tracer concentrations. Procedures Theoretical simulations and a mouse melanoma model experiment were used to test out the EMCI approach. The tracers used in the melanoma experiments were fluorescently labeled anti-Plvap/PV1 antibody (plasmalemma vesicle associated protein Plvap/PV1 is a transmembrane protein marker exposed on the luminal surface of endothelial cells in tumor vasculature) and a fluorescent isotype control antibody, the uptakes of which were measured on a planar fluorescence imaging system. Results The EMCI model was found to be robust to experimental noise under reversible and irreversible binding conditions and was capable of predicting expected overexpression of PV1 in melanomas compared to healthy skin despite a 5-time higher measured fluorescence in healthy skin compared to melanoma: attributable to substantial light attenuation from melanin in the tumors. Conclusions This study demonstrates the potential of EMCI to quantify endothelial marker concentrations in vivo, an accomplishment that is currently unavailable through any other methods, either in vivo or ex vivo.

Near-Infrared (NIR) dyes are increasingly used in the biological and medical field. The binding characteristics of NIR dyes to biomolecules are possibly controlled by several factors, including hydrophobicity, size and charge just to mention a few parameters. Binding characteristics of symmetric carbocyanines and found that the hydrophobic nature of the NIR dye is only partially responsible for the binding strength. Upon binding to biomolecules significant fluorescence enhancement can be observed for symmetrical carbocyanines. This fluorescence amplification facilitates the detection of the NIR dye and enhances its utility as NIR reporter. This manuscript discusses some probe and marker applications of such NIR fluorescent dyes. One application discussed here is the use of NIR dyes as markers. For labeling applications the fluorescence intensity of the NIR fluorescent label can significantly be increased by enclosing several dye molecules in nanoparticles. To decrease self quenching dyes that have relatively large Stokes' shift needs to be used. This is achieved by substituting meso position halogens with amino moiety. This substitution can also serve as a linker to covalently attach the dye molecule to the nanoparticle backbone. We report here on the preparation of NIR fluorescent silica nanoparticles. Silica nanoparticles that are modified with aminoreactive moieties can be used as bright fluorescent labels in bioanalytical applications. A new bioanalytical technique to detect and monitor the catalytic activity of the sulfur assimilating enzyme using NIR dyes is reported as well. In this spectroscopic bioanalytical assay a family of Fischer based n-butyl sulfonate substituted dyes that exhibit distinct variation in absorbance and fluorescence properties and strong binding to serum albumin as its\n\nMethod for accurate quantitation of background tissue optical properties in the presence of emission from a strong fluorescence marker\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBravo, Jaime; Davis, Scott C.; Roberts, David W.; Paulsen, Keith D.; Kanick, Stephen C.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nQuantification of targeted fluorescence markers during neurosurgery has the potential to improve and standardize surgical distinction between normal and cancerous tissues. However, quantitative analysis of marker fluorescence is complicated by tissue background absorption and scattering properties. Correction algorithms that transform raw fluorescence intensity into quantitative units, independent of absorption and scattering, require a paired measurement of localized white light reflectance to provide estimates of the optical properties. This study focuses on the unique problem of developing a spectral analysis algorithm to extract tissue absorption and scattering properties from white light spectra that contain contributions from both elastically scattered photons and fluorescence emission from a strong fluorophore (i.e. fluorescein). A fiber-optic reflectance device was used to perform measurements in a small set of optical phantoms, constructed with Intralipid (1% lipid), whole blood (1% volume fraction) and fluorescein (0.16-10 Î¼g/mL). Results show that the novel spectral analysis algorithm yields accurate estimates of tissue parameters independent of fluorescein concentration, with relative errors of blood volume fraction, blood oxygenation fraction (BOF), and the reduced scattering coefficient (at 521 nm) of <7%, <1%, and <22%, respectively. These data represent a first step towards quantification of fluorescein in tissue in vivo.\n\nA 21 000-year record of fluorescent organic matter markers in the WAIS Divide ice core\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nD'Andrilli, Juliana; Foreman, Christine M.; Sigl, Michael; Priscu, John C.; McConnell, Joseph R.\n\n2017-05-01\n\nEnglacial ice contains a significant reservoir of organic material (OM), preserving a chronological record of materials from Earth's past. Here, we investigate if OM composition surveys in ice core research can provide paleoecological information on the dynamic nature of our Earth through time. Temporal trends in OM composition from the early Holocene extending back to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide (WD) ice core were measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. Multivariate parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis is widely used to isolate the chemical components that best describe the observed variation across three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (excitation-emission matrices; EEMs) assays. Fluorescent OM markers identified by PARAFAC modeling of the EEMs from the LGM (27.0-18.0 kyr BP; before present 1950) through the last deglaciation (LD; 18.0-11.5 kyr BP), to the mid-Holocene (11.5-6.0 kyr BP) provided evidence of different types of fluorescent OM composition and origin in the WD ice core over 21.0 kyr. Low excitation-emission wavelength fluorescent PARAFAC component one (C1), associated with chemical species similar to simple lignin phenols was the greatest contributor throughout the ice core, suggesting a strong signature of terrestrial OM in all climate periods. The component two (C2) OM marker, encompassed distinct variability in the ice core describing chemical species similar to tannin- and phenylalanine-like material. Component three (C3), associated with humic-like terrestrial material further resistant to biodegradation, was only characteristic of the Holocene, suggesting that more complex organic polymers such as lignins or tannins may be an ecological marker of warmer climates. We suggest that fluorescent OM markers observed during the LGM were the result of greater continental dust loading of lignin precursor (monolignol) material in a drier climate, with lower marine influences when sea ice extent was higher and\n\nFluorescent marker for the detection of crop and upper gastrointestinal leakage in poultry processing plants.\n\nPubMed\n\nByrd, J A; Hargis, B M; Corrier, D E; Brewer, R L; Caldwell, D J; Bailey, R H; McReynolds, J L; Herron, K L; Stanker, L H\n\n2002-01-01\n\nPrevious published research has identified the crop as a source of Salmonella and Campylobacter contamination for broiler carcasses and reported that broiler crops are 86 times more likely to rupture than ceca during commercial processing. Presently, we evaluated leakage of crop and upper gastrointestinal contents from broilers using a fluorescent marker at commercial processing plants. Broilers were orally gavaged with a fluorescent marker paste (corn meal-fluorescein dye-agar) within 30 min of live hang. Carcasses were collected at several points during processing and were examined for upper gastrointestinal leakage using long-wavelength black light. This survey indicated that 67% of the total broiler carcasses were positive for the marker at the rehang station following head and shank removal. Crops were mechanically removed from 61% of the carcasses prior to the cropper, and visual online examination indicated leakage of crop contents following crop removal by the pack puller. Examination of the carcasses prior to the cropper detected the marker in the following regions: neck (50.5% positive), thoracic inlet (69.7% positive), thoracic cavity (35.4% positive), and abdominal cavity (34.3% positive). Immediately prior to chill immersion, 53.2% of the carcasses contained some degree of visually identifiable marker contamination, as follows: neck (41.5% positive), thoracic inlet (45.2% positive), thoracic cavity (26.2% positive), and abdominal cavity (30.2% positive). These results suggest that this fluorescent marker technique may serve as a useful tool for rapid identification of potential changes, which could reduce the incidence of crop rupture and contamination of carcasses at processing.\n\nFluorescent tag is not a reliable marker for small RNA transfection in the presence of serum.\n\nPubMed\n\nHan, Jing; Wang, Qi-Wei; Wang, Shi-Qiang\n\n2013-09-01\n\nChemically synthetic siRNA and miRNA have become powerful tools to study gene function in the past decade. Fluorescent dyes covalently attached to the 5' or 3' ends of synthetic small RNAs are widely used for fluorescently imaging and detection of these RNAs. However, the reliability of fluorescent tags as small RNA markers in different conditions has not attracted enough attention. We used Cy3-labelled small RNAs to explore the reliability of fluorescent tags as small RNA markers in cell cultures involving serum. A strong Cy3-fluorescence signal was observed in the cytoplasm of the cells transfected with Cy3-miR24 in the culture medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS), but qRT-PCR results showed that little miR24 were detected in these cells. Further study demonstrated that small RNAs were degraded in the presence of FBS, suggesting that it was Cy3-RNA fragments, rather than the original Cy3-miR24, diffused into cells. These phenomena disappeared when FBS was replaced by boiled-FBS, further supporting that the Cy3-fluorescence we observed in cells in the presence of FBS could not represent the presence of intact small RNAs. These findings addressed that fluorescent tags are not reliable for small RNA transfection in the presence of serum in culture.\n\nSynthesis and properties of SiN coatings as stable fluorescent markers on vertically aligned carbon nanofibers\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPearce, Ryan; Klein, Kate L; Ivanov, Ilia N\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe growth of vertically aligned carbon nanofibers (VACNFs) in a catalytic dc ammonia/acetylene plasma process on silicon substrates is often accompanied by sidewall deposition of material that contains mostly Si and N. In fluorescent microscopy experiments, imaging VACNF interfacing to live cell cultures it turned out that this material is broadly fluorescent, which made VACNFs useful as spatial markers, or created nuisance when DNA-labeling got masked. In this paper we provide insight into nature of this silicon/nitrogen in situ coatings. Here we have proposed a potential mechanism for deposition of SiNx coating on the sidewalls of VACNFs during PECVD synthesismoreÂ Â» in addition to exploring the origin of the coatings fluorescence. It seems most likely that the substrate reacts with the process gases through both processes similar to reactive sputtering and CVD to form silane and other silicon bearing compounds before being deposited isotropically as a SiNx coating onto the VACNFs. The case for the presence of Si-NCs is made strong through a combination of the strong fluorescence and elemental analysis of the samples. These broadly luminescent fibers can prove useful as registry markers in fluorescent cellular studies.Â«Â less\n\nMultiplexed detection of tumor markers with multicolor quantum dots based on fluorescence polarization immunoassay.\n\nPubMed\n\nTian, Jianniao; Zhou, Liujin; Zhao, Yanchun; Wang, Yuan; Peng, Yan; Zhao, Shulin\n\n2012-04-15\n\nA multicolor quantum dot (QD)-based nanosensor for multiplex detection of two tumor markers in a homogeneous format based on fluorescence polarization immunoassay was proposed. QDs520 and QDs620 were labeled alpha-fetoprotein(Î±-AFP) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), respectively. After separated and purified by ultrafiltration, they were used in fluorescence polarization immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of human serum alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen. Under the optimal conditions, the multi-analyte immunosensor had a wide linear range (from 0.5 ng mL(-1) to 500 ng mL(-1)) for both two tumor markers and good correlation (0.996 for Î±-AFP and 0.993 for CEA). The detection limits (LOD) were 0.36 ng mL(-1) for CEA and 0.28 ng mL(-1) for Î±-AFP (S/N=3). The carcinoembryonic antigen and fetoprotein in clinical serum samples were simultaneously detected. The results from 28 serum samples had a good agreement with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The relative standard deviation and the recovery suggested that the precision and the accuracy of this analytical method were satisfactory. This strategy with high sensitivity, good specificity, easy procedures and short analysis time shows great promise for clinical diagnoses and basic discovery. The application of QDs with longer fluorescence lifetime and small fluorescence polarization can be used for the determination of high molecular-weight substances which cannot be analyzed using dye fluorescence polarization immunoassay.

In this study, we improved the selection strategy and validated that the maize (Zea mays) Activator/Dissociation (Ds) transposable element can be routinely used to generate marker-free transgenic plants. A Ds-based gene of interest was linked to green fluorescent protein in transfer DNA (T-DNA), and a green fluorescent protein-aided counterselection against T-DNA was used together with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based positive selection for the gene of interest to screen marker-free progeny. To test the efficacy of this strategy, we cloned the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Î´-endotoxin gene into the Ds elements and transformed transposon vectors into rice (Oryza sativa) cultivars via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. PCR assays of the transposon empty donor site exhibited transposition in somatic cells in 60.5% to 100% of the rice transformants. Marker-free (T-DNA-free) transgenic rice plants derived from unlinked germinal transposition were obtained from the T1 generation of 26.1% of the primary transformants. Individual marker-free transgenic rice lines were subjected to thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR to determine Ds(Bt) reintegration positions, reverse transcription-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect Bt expression levels, and bioassays to confirm resistance against the striped stem borer Chilo suppressalis. Overall, we efficiently generated marker-free transgenic plants with optimized transgene insertion and expression. The transposon-mediated marker-free platform established in this study can be used in rice and possibly in other important crops. Â© 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists.

In some cases, detection of very low molecular concentrations and precise localization of biomarkers are limited by the weakness of the fluorescence signal. We present a new method based on sample substrates that improve fluorescence detection sensitivity. These active substrates consist in glass slides covered with metal (gold or silver) and dielectric (alumina) films and can directly be used with common microscope set-up. Fluorescence enhancement affects both excitation and decay rates and is strongly dependant on the distance to the metal surface. Furthermore, fluorescence collection is improved since fluorophore emission lobes are advantageously modified close to a reflective surface. Finally, additional improvements are achieved by structuring the metallic layer. Substrates morphology was mapped by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Substrates optical properties were studied using mono- and bi-photonic fluorescence microscopy with time resolution. An original set-up was implemented for spatial radiation pattern's measurement. Detection improvement was then tested on commercial devices. Several biomedical applications are presented. Enhancement by two orders of magnitude are achieved for DNA chips and signal-to-noise ratio is greatly increased for cells imaging.\n\nEfficient Generation of Marker-Free Transgenic Rice Plants Using an Improved Transposon-Mediated Transgene Reintegration Strategy1\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGao, Xiaoqing; Zhou, Jie; Li, Jun; Zou, Xiaowei; Zhao, Jianhua; Li, Qingliang; Xia, Ran; Yang, Ruifang; Wang, Dekai; Zuo, Zhaoxue; Tu, Jumin; Tao, Yuezhi; Chen, Xiaoyun; Xie, Qi; Zhu, Zengrong\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMarker-free transgenic plants can be developed through transposon-mediated transgene reintegration, which allows intact transgene insertion with defined boundaries and requires only a few primary transformants.

Colour was measured by a calibrated computer vision system. Surface fluorescence was measured on compressed samples. Aqueous extracted Maillard reaction markers (hydroxymethylfurfural, carboxymethyl-lysine, absorbance at 420nm and total fluorescence) were measured on protease hydrolyzed samples. Sample microstructure was observed by scanning electron microscopy. During cooking the colour coordinates L(â) and b(â) decreased and a(â) increased. After flaking, the samples appeared lighter, while the pigment concentration, fluorescence and hydroxymethylfurfural did not change. Toasting generated bubbles in the matrix and L(â) apparently increased, although brown pigment concentration increased. Pigment concentration did not correlate with surface colour due to the destruction or generation of interfaces. Surface and microstructure effects can be avoided by milling and compressing the samples. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report on further improvements to the CRISPR/Cas9 transfection constructs and selection protocol to more rapidly modify the P. falciparum genome and to introduce transgenes into the parasite genome without the inclusion of drug-selectable marker genes. This method was used to stably integrate the gene encoding GFP into the P. falciparum genome under the control of promoters of three different Plasmodium genes (calmodulin, gapdh and hsp70). These genes were selected as they are highly transcribed in blood stages. We show that the three reporter parasite lines generated in this study (GFP@cam, GFP@gapdh and GFP@hsp70) have in vitro blood stage growth kinetics and drug-sensitivity profiles comparable to the parental P. falciparum (NF54) wild-type line. Both asexual and sexual blood stages of the three reporter lines expressed GFP-fluorescence with GFP@hsp70 having the highest fluorescent intensity in schizont stages as shown by flow cytometry analysis of GFP-fluorescence intensity. The improved CRISPR/Cas9 constructs/protocol will aid in the rapid generation of transgenic and modified P. falciparum parasites, including those expressing different reporters proteins under different (stage specific) promoters.\n\nRapid Generation of Marker-Free P. falciparum Fluorescent Reporter Lines Using Modified CRISPR/Cas9 Constructs and Selection Protocol\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMogollon, Catherin Marin; van Pul, Fiona J.

Methods which deliver composite data reflecting the mean values of biomarkers from cell populations risk losing subpopulation dynamics that reflect the heterogeneity of the studied biological system. In keeping with this, traditional approaches are being replaced by, or supported with, more sophisticated forms of cellular assay developed to allow assessment by high-content microscopy. These assays potentially generate large numbers of images of fluorescent biomarkers, which enabled by accompanying proprietary software packages, allows for multi-parametric measurements per cell. However, the relatively high capital costs and overspecialization of many of these devices have prevented their accessibility to many investigators. Described here is a universally applicable workflow for the quantification of multiple fluorescent marker intensities from specific subcellular regions of individual cells suitable for use with images from most fluorescent microscopes. Key to this workflow is the implementation of the freely available Cell Profiler software(1) to distinguish individual cells in these images, segment them into defined subcellular regions and deliver fluorescence marker intensity values specific to these regions. The extraction of individual cell intensity values from image data is the central purpose of this workflow and will be illustrated with the analysis of control data from a siRNA screen for G1 checkpoint regulators in adherent human cells. However, the workflow presented here can be applied to analysis of data from other means of cell perturbation (e.g., compound screens) and other forms of fluorescence based cellular markers and thus should be useful for a wide range of laboratories.\n\nSmall supernumerary marker chromosome derived from proximal p-arm of chromosome 2: identification by fluorescent in situ hybridization.\n\nPubMed\n\nLasan TrciÄ, Ruzica; Hitrec, Vlasta; Letica, Ljiljana; Cuk, Mario; BegoviÄ, Davor\n\n2003-08-01\n\nConventional cytogenetics detected an interstitial deletion of proximal region of p-arm of chromosome 2 in a 6-month-old boy with a phenotype slightly resembling Down's syndrome. The deletion was inherited from the father, whose karyotype revealed a small ring-shaped marker chromosome, in addition to interstitial deletion. Fluorescence in situ hybridization identified the marker, which consisted of the proximal region of the p-arm of chromosome 2, including a part of its centromere. This case shows that molecular cytogenetic analysis can reveal the mechanism of the formation of the marker chromosome.\n\nFunctional molecular markers for crop improvement.\n\nPubMed\n\nKage, Udaykumar; Kumar, Arun; Dhokane, Dhananjay; Karre, Shailesh; Kushalappa, Ajjamada C\n\n2016-10-01\n\nA tremendous decline in cultivable land and resources and a huge increase in food demand calls for immediate attention to crop improvement. Though molecular plant breeding serves as a viable solution and is considered as \"foundation for twenty-first century crop improvement\", a major stumbling block for crop improvement is the availability of a limited functional gene pool for cereal crops. Advancement in the next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies integrated with tools like metabolomics, proteomics and association mapping studies have facilitated the identification of candidate genes, their allelic variants and opened new avenues to accelerate crop improvement through development and use of functional molecular markers (FMMs). The FMMs are developed from the sequence polymorphisms present within functional gene(s) which are associated with phenotypic trait variations. Since FMMs obviate the problems associated with random DNA markers, these are considered as \"the holy grail\" of plant breeders who employ targeted marker assisted selections (MAS) for crop improvement. This review article attempts to consider the current resources and novel methods such as metabolomics, proteomics and association studies for the identification of candidate genes and their validation through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) for the development of FMMs. A number of examples where the FMMs have been developed and used for the improvement of cereal crops for agronomic, food quality, disease resistance and abiotic stress tolerance traits have been considered.\n\nUse of DNA markers in forest tree improvement research\n\nTreesearch\n\nD.B.

Most commonly, the enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) is used as the donor fluorophore, coupled with one of several yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) variants as the acceptor. ECFP is used despite several spectroscopic disadvantages, namely a low quantum yield, a low extinction coefficient and a fluorescence lifetime that is best fit by a double exponential. To improve the characteristics of ECFP for FRET measurements, we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to overcome these disadvantages. The resulting variant, which we named Cerulean (ECFP/S72A/Y145A/H148D), has a greatly improved quantum yield, a higher extinction coefficient and a fluorescence lifetime that is best fit by a single exponential. Cerulean is 2.5-fold brighter than ECFP and replacement of ECFP with Cerulean substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio of a FRET-based sensor for glucokinase activation.\n\nImproved Charge-Transfer Fluorescent Dyes\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMeador, Michael\n\n2005-01-01\n\nImproved charge-transfer fluorescent dyes have been developed for use as molecular probes.

Optionally, these dyes could be incorporated as parts of polymer backbones or as pendant groups or attached to certain surfaces via self-assembly-based methods. These dyes exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields -- ranging from 0.2 to 0.98, depending upon solvents and chemical structures. The wavelengths, quantum yields, intensities, and lifetimes of the fluorescence emitted by these dyes vary with (and, hence, can be used as indicators of) the polarities of solvents in which they are dissolved: In solvents of increasing polarity, fluorescence spectra shift to longer wavelengths, fluorescence quantum yields decrease, and fluorescence lifetimes increase. The wavelengths, quantum yields, intensities, and lifetimes are also expected to be sensitive to viscosities and/or glass-transition temperatures. Some chemical species -- especially amines, amino acids, and metal ions -- quench the fluorescence of these dyes, with consequent reductions in intensities, quantum yields, and lifetimes. As a result, the dyes can be used to detect these species. Another useful characteristic of these dyes is a capability for both two-photon and one-photon absorption. Typically, these dyes absorb single photons in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum (wavelengths < 400 nm) and emit photons in the long-wavelength ultraviolet, visible, and, when dissolved in some solvents, near-infrared regions. In addition, these dyes can be excited by two-photon absorption at near-infrared wavelengths (600 to 800 nm) to produce fluorescence spectra identical to those obtained in response to excitation by single photons at half the corresponding wavelengths (300 to 400 nm). While many prior fluorescent dyes exhibit high quantum yields\n\nTriazole-based ZnÂ²âº-specific molecular marker for fluorescence bioimaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nSinha, Sougata; Mukherjee, Trinetra; Mathew, Jomon; Mukhopadhyay, Subhra K; Ghosh, Subrata\n\n2014-04-25\n\nFluorescence bioimaging potential, both in vitro and in vivo, of a yellow emissive triazole-based molecular marker has been investigated and demonstrated. Three different kinds of cells, viz Bacillus thuringiensis, Candida albicans, and Techoma stans pollen grains were used to investigate the intracellular zinc imaging potential of 1 (in vitro studies). Fluorescence imaging of translocation of zinc through the stem of small herb, Peperomia pellucida, having transparent stem proved in vivo bioimaging capability of 1. This approach will enable in screening cell permeability and biostability of a newly developed probe. Similarly, the current method for detection and localization of zinc in Gram seed sprouts could be an easy and potential alternative of the existing analytical methods to investigate the efficiency of various strategies applied for increasing zinc-content in cereal crops. The probe-zinc ensemble has efficiently been applied for detecting phosphate-based biomolecules. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

According to the research, violet laser or ultraviolet laser is always used as excitation light source. While, There is no atmospheric window for violet laser and ultraviolet laser, causing laser attenuation along its propagation path. What's worse, as the laser reaching sample, part of the light is reflected. That is, excitation laser really react on sample to produce fluorescence is very poor, leading to weak fluorescence mingled with the background light collected by LIFS' processing unit, when it used outdoor. In order to spread LIFS to remote probing under the complex background, study of improving signal-noise ratio for fluorescence channel is a meaningful work. Enhancing the fluorescence intensity and inhibiting background light both can improve fluorescence' signal-noise ratio. In this article, three different approaches of inhibiting background light are discussed to improve the signal-noise ratio of LIFS. The first method is increasing fluorescence excitation area in the proportion of LIFS' collecting field by expanding laser beam, if the collecting filed is fixed. The second one is changing field angle base to accommodate laser divergence angle. The third one is setting a very narrow gating circuit to control acquisition circuit, which is shortly open only when fluorescence arriving. At some level, these methods all can reduce the background light. But after discussion, the third one is best with adding gating acquisition circuit to acquisition circuit instead of changing light path, which is effective and economic.\n\nOptimized Time-Gated Fluorescence Spectroscopy for the Classification and Recycling of Fluorescently Labeled Plastics.\n\nPubMed\n\nFomin, Petr; Zhelondz, Dmitry; Kargel, Christian\n\n2017-05-01\n\nFor the production of high-quality parts from recycled plastics, a very high purity of the plastic waste to be recycled is mandatory. The incorporation of fluorescent tracers (\"markers\") into plastics during the manufacturing process helps overcome typical problems of non-tracer based optical classification methods. Despite the unique emission spectra of fluorescent markers, the classification becomes difficult when the host plastics exhibit (strong) autofluorescence that spectrally overlaps the marker fluorescence. Increasing the marker concentration is not an option from an economic perspective and might also adversely affect the properties of the plastics. A measurement approach that suppresses the autofluorescence in the acquired signal is time-gated fluorescence spectroscopy (TGFS). Unfortunately, TGFS is associated with a lower signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, which results in larger classification errors. In order to optimize the S/N ratio we investigate and validate the best TGFS parameters-derived from a model for the fluorescence signal-for plastics labeled with four specifically designed fluorescent markers. In this study we also demonstrate the implementation of TGFS on a measurement and classification prototype system and determine its performance. Mean values for a sensitivity of [Formula: see text]â=â99.93% and precision [Formula: see text]â=â99.80% were achieved, proving that a highly reliable classification of plastics can be achieved in practice.\n\nImproved tumor identification using dual tracer molecular imaging in fluorescence guided brain surgery\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Xiaochun; Torres, Veronica; Straus, David; Brey, Eric M.; Byrne, Richard W.; Tichauer, Kenneth M.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nBrain tumors represent a leading cause of cancer death for people under the age of 40 and the probability complete surgical resection of brain tumors remains low owing to the invasive nature of these tumors and the consequences of damaging healthy brain tissue. Molecular imaging is an emerging approach that has the potential to improve the ability for surgeons to correctly discriminate between healthy and cancerous tissue; however, conventional molecular imaging approaches in brain suffer from significant background signal in healthy tissue or an inability target more invasive sections of the tumor. This work presents initial studies investigating the ability of novel dual-tracer molecular imaging strategies to be used to overcome the major limitations of conventional \"single-tracer\" molecular imaging. The approach is evaluated in simulations and in an in vivo mice study with animals inoculated orthotopically using fluorescent human glioma cells. An epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeted Affibody-fluorescent marker was employed as a targeted imaging agent, and the suitability of various FDA approved untargeted fluorescent tracers (e.g. fluorescein & indocyanine green) were evaluated in terms of their ability to account for nonspecific uptake and retention of the targeted imaging agent. Signal-to-background ratio was used to measure and compare the amount of reporter in the tissue between targeted and untargeted tracer. The initial findings suggest that FDA-approved fluorescent imaging agents are ill-suited to act as untargeted imaging agents for dual-tracer fluorescent guided brain surgery as they suffer from poor delivery to the healthy brain tissue and therefore cannot be used to identify nonspecific vs. specific uptake of the targeted imaging agent where current surgery is most limited.\n\nApplication of fluorescently labeled tracer technique for detection of natural active macromolecules in Chinese medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\nZeng, Qiao-Hui; Zhang, Xue-Wu; Xu, Kai-Peng; Jiang, Jian-Guo\n\n2014-02-01\n\nActive substances in traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) contain not only a variety of small molecules, but also many other macromolecules (TCMMs), such as proteins, peptides and polysaccharides. Active TCMM can achieve good therapeutic effects by regulating the body's overall function with lower side effects. This review summarized the literatures published in recent years on the application of fluorescently labeled tracer technique for detection of natural active macromolecules in TCM. Classified by fluorescent markers, applications of fluorescein, rhodamine, and quantum dots (QDs) in TCMM active tracer are reviewed, and the methods and principles of TCMM fluorescent marker are illustrated. Studies on active TCMMs and their action mechanism are quite difficult due to a multitarget, multicomponent, and multipath system of TCM. However, the development of fluorescently labeled active tracer technique (FLATT) provides this research with new tools. Traditional fluorescent markers have many deficiencies, such as easily quenched, short luminous cycle, and intrinsic toxicity. Relatively, FLATT has many obvious advantages, and its application in TCMM is still at the early stage. In order to improve the overall level of fluorescence labeling in TCMM active tracer, the improvement on FLATT's detection sensitivity and biological affinity is urgent and critical to allow study of these interesting molecules.\n\nCombining risk markers improves cardiovascular risk prediction in women.\n\nPubMed\n\nHolewijn, Suzanne; den Heijer, Martin; Kiemeney, Lambertus A; Stalenhoef, Anton F H; de Graaf, Jacqueline\n\n2014-01-01\n\nCardiovascular risk stratification could be improved by adding measures of atherosclerosis to current risk scores, especially in intermediate-risk individuals. We prospectively evaluated the additive value of different non-invasive risk markers (both individual and combined) for gender-specific cardiovascular risk stratification on top of traditional risk factors in a middle-aged population-based cohort. Carotid-plaques, IMT (intima-media thickness), ABI (ankle-brachial index), PWV (pulse-wave velocity), AIx (augmentation index), CAP (central augmented pressure) and CSP (central-systolic pressure) were measured in 1367 CVD (cardiovascular disease)-free participants aged 50-70 years old. Cardiovascular events were validated after a mean follow-up of 3.8 years. AUC (area-under-the-curve) and NRI (net reclassification improvement) analyses (total-NRI for all and clinical-NRI for intermediate-risk groups) were used to determine the additive value of individual and combined risk markers. Cardiovascular events occurred in 32 women and 39 men. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors explained 6.2% and 12.5% of the variance in CVD in women and men respectively. AUCs did not substantially increase by adding individual or combined non-invasive risk markers. Individual risk markers only improved reclassification in intermediate-risk women and more than in men; clinical-NRIs ranged between 48.0 and 173.1% in women and 8.9 and 20% in men. Combined non-invasive-risk markers improved reclassification in all women and even more in those at intermediate risk; 'IMT-presence-thickness-of-plaques' showed largest reclassification [total-NRI=33.8%, P=0.012; IDI (integrated-discrimination-improvement)=0.048, P=0.066; clinical-NRI=168.0%]. In men, combined non-invasive risk markers improved reclassification only in those at intermediate risk; 'PWV-AIx-CSP-CAP-IMT' showed the largest reclassification (total-NRI=14.5%, P=0.087; IDI=0.016, P=0.148; clinical-NRI=46.0%).

One of the main methods for evaluating cell morphology is by using intracellular fluorescent markers, including various commercially available dyes and genetically encoded fluorescent proteins. These markers can be used as free radical sources in photooxidation reactions, which in the presence of diaminobenzidine (DAB) forms an opaque and electron-dense precipitate that remains localized within the cellular and organelle membranes. This method confers many methodological advantages for the investigator, including absence of photo-bleaching, high visual contrast and the possibility of correlating optical imaging with electron microscopy. However, current photooxidation techniques require the continuous use of fluorescent or confocal microscopes, which wastes valuable mercury lamp lifetime and limits the conversion process to a few cells at a time. We developed a low cost optical apparatus for performing photooxidation reactions and propose a new procedure that solves these methodological restrictions. Our âphotooxidizerâ consists of a high power light emitting diode (LED) associated with a custom aluminum and acrylic case and a microchip-controlled current source. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by converting intracellular DiI in samples of developing rat neocortex and post-mortem human retina. DiI crystals were inserted in the tissue and allowed to diffuse for 20 days. The samples were then processed with the new photooxidation technique and analyzed under optical microscopy. The results show that our protocols can unveil the fine morphology of neurons in detail. Cellular structures such as axons, dendrites and spine-like appendages were well defined. In addition to its low cost, simplicity and reliability, our method precludes the use of microscope lamps for photooxidation and allows the processing of many labeled cells simultaneously in relatively large tissue\n\n[Study on transformation of P-dissolving Penicillium oxalicum P8 with double-marker vector expressing green fluorescent protein and hygromycin B resistance].\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Lei; Fan, Bing-Quan; Huang, Wei-Yi\n\n2005-12-01\n\nP-dissolving Penicillium oxalicum P8 was isolated previously in this lab which has a considerable ability to dissolve many kinds of inorganic phosphorus and improve crop growth. In order to study rhizosphere colonization of plants by Penicillium oxalicum P8, protoplasts were transformed with a double-marker expression vector of green fluorescent protein and hygromycin B resistance. Some transformants were selected which expressed both the GFP and hygromycin B phosphotransferase and did not show significant morphological or physiological differences as compared to wild-type strain. Southern blot analysis confirmed the heterogeneous genomic integration of the vector DNA into the transformants.\n\nIntegrating fluorescence and interactance measurements to improve apple maturity assessment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNoh, Hyun Kwon; Lu, Renfu\n\n2006-10-01\n\nFluorescence and reflectance (or interactance) are promising techniques for measuring fruit quality and condition. Our previous research showed that a hyperspectral imaging technique integrating fluorescence and reflectance could improve predictions of selected quality parameters compared to single sensing techniques. The objective of this research was to use a low cost spectrometer for rapid acquisition of fluorescence and interactance spectra from apples and develop an algorithm integrating the two types of data for predicting skin and flesh color, fruit firmness, starch index, soluble solids content, and titratable acid. Experiments were performed to measure UV light induced transient fluorescence and interactance spectra from 'Golden Delicious' apples that were harvested over a period of four weeks during the 2005 harvest season. Standard destructive tests were performed to measure maturity parameters from the apples. Principal component (PC) analysis was applied to the interactance and fluorescence data. A back-propagation feedforward neural network with the inputs of PC data was used to predict individual maturity parameters. Interactance mode was consistently better than fluorescence mode in predicting the maturity parameters. Integrating interactance and fluorescence improved predictions of all parameters except flesh chroma; values of the correlation coefficient for firmness, soluble solids content, starch index, and skin and flesh hue were 0.77, 0.77, 0.89, 0.99, and 0.96 respectively, with the corresponding standard errors of 6.93 N, 0.90%, 0.97 g/L, 0.013 rad, and 0.013 rad. These results represented 4.1% to 23.5% improvements in terms of standard error, in comparison with the better results from the two single sensing methods. Integrating interactance and fluorescence can better assess apple maturity and quality.\n\nTechniques to Improve Ultrasound-Switchable Fluorescence Imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKandukuri, Jayanth\n\nNovel approaches to the improvement of ultrasound-switchable fluorescence (USF) imaging--a relatively new imaging modality that combines ultrasound and optical imaging techniques--have been proposed for early cancer detection. In USF, a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) beam is used to induce temperature rise within its acoustic focal region due to which a thermo-sensitive USF contrast agent undergoes a switch in its state by increasing the output of fluorescence photons. By using an increase in fluorescence, one can isolate and quantify the fluorescence properties within the ultrasonic focal area. Therefore, USF is able to provide fluorescence contrast while maintaining ultrasound resolution in tissue. The major challenge of the conventional USF technique is its low axial resolution and its sensitivity (i.e. its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)). This work focuses on investigating and developing a novel USF system design that can improve the resolution and SNR of USF imaging for biological applications. This work can be divided into two major parts: characterizing the performance of a high-intensity focused ultrasound transducer; and improving the axial resolution and sensitivity of the USF technique. Preliminary investigation was conducted by using an IR camera setup to detect temperature variation and thereby study the performance of the high-intensity focused ultrasound transducer to quantify different parameters of ultrasound-induced temperature focal size (UTFS). Investigations are conducted for the purpose of high-resolution imaging with an emphasis on HIFU-induced thermal focus size, short duration of HIFU-induced temperature increase (to avoid thermal diffusion or conduction), and control of HIFU-induced temperature increase within a few degrees Celsius. Next, the focus was shifted to improving the sensitivity of the ultrasound-switchable fluorescence-imaging technique. In this study, the USF signal is encoded with the modulation frequency of the\n\nFluorescence diffuse tomography of small animals with DsRed2 fluorescent protein\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTurchin, I.

P.\n\n2006-05-01\n\nFluorescent compounds are used as markers to diagnose oncological diseases, to study molecular processes typical for carcinogenesis, and to investigate metastasis formation and tumor regress under the influence of therapeutics. Different types of tomography, such as continuous wave (CW), frequency-domain (FD), and time-domain (TD) tomography, allow fluorescence imaging of tumors located deep in human or animal tissue. In this work, preliminary results of the frequency domain fluorescent diffuse tomography (FDT) method in application to DsRed2 protein as a fluorescent agent are presented. For the first step of our experiments, we utilized low-frequency amplitude modulation (1 kHz) of second harmonic of Nd: YAG (532 nm). The transilluminative configuration was used in the setup. The results of post mortem experiments with capsules containing DsRed2 inserted inside the esophagus of a 3-day-old hairless rat to simulate tumor are shown. An algorithm of processing fluorescent images based on calculating the zero of maximum curvature has been applied to detect fluorescent inclusion boundaries in the image. This work demonstrates the potential capability of the FDT method for imaging deep fluorescent tumors in human tissue or animal models of human cancer. Improvement of the setup can be accomplished by using high-frequency modulation (using a 110-MHz acoustooptical modulator).\n\nImproved sensitivity to fluorescence for cancer detection in wide-field image-guided neurosurgery\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJermyn, Michael; Gosselin, Yoann; Valdes, Pablo A.; Sibai, Mira; Kolste, Kolbein; Mercier, Jeanne; Angulo, Leticia; Roberts, David W.; Paulsen, Keith D.; Petrecca, Kevin; Daigle, Olivier; Wilson, Brian C.; Leblond, Frederic\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn glioma surgery, Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence may identify residual tumor that could be resected while minimizing damage to normal brain. We demonstrate that improved sensitivity for wide-field spectroscopic fluorescence imaging is achieved with minimal disruption to the neurosurgical workflow using an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) relative to a state-of-the-art CMOS system. In phantom experiments the EMCCD system can detect at least two orders-of-magnitude lower PpIX. Ex vivo tissue imaging on a rat glioma model demonstrates improved fluorescence contrast compared with neurosurgical fluorescence microscope technology, and the fluorescence detection is confirmed with measurements from a clinically-validated spectroscopic probe. Greater PpIX sensitivity in wide-field fluorescence imaging may improve the residual tumor detection during surgery with consequent impact on survival.

While pairs of cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (FPs) are most commonly used as FRET partner fluorophores, respectively, green and red FPs offer distinct advantages for FRET, such as greater spectral separation, less phototoxicity, and lower autofluorescence. We previously developed the green-red FRET pair Clover and mRuby2, which improves responsiveness in intramolecular FRET reporters with different designs. Here we report the engineering of brighter and more photostable variants, mClover3 and mRuby3. mClover3 improves photostability by 60% and mRuby3 by 200% over the previous generation of fluorophores. Notably, mRuby3 is also 35% brighter than mRuby2, making it both the brightest and most photostable monomeric red FP yet characterized. Furthermore, we developed a standardized methodology for assessing FP performance in mammalian cells as stand-alone markers and as FRET partners. We found that mClover3 or mRuby3 expression in mammalian cells provides the highest fluorescence signals of all jellyfish GFP or coral RFP derivatives, respectively. Finally, using mClover3 and mRuby3, we engineered an improved version of the CaMKIIÎ± reporter CamuiÎ± with a larger response amplitude.

In this study we present a new method to separate periportal and perivenous cells: after selectively loading zone 1 or zone 3 with the fluorescent label acridine orange in an antegrade or retrograde perfusion, respectively, we separated the isolated hepatocytes on a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. The common way to check on proper separation is to estimate activities of enzymes known to exhibit a heterogeneous acinar distribution. Using enzyme histochemistry, however, we found that already on short collagenase perfusion, some enzymes displayed a more shallow gradient than in vivo, making enzyme activities less suitable as zonal markers. We therefore used colloidal gold granules (17 nm) injected intravenously (2.5 mg) into the rat 2 to 3 hr before cell isolation. The gold is taken up predominantly by perivenous hepatocytes, probably because of the efficient removal of gold granules in zone 1 by competing Kupffer cells. We compared acridine orange fluorescence, presence of gold particles and activities of six marker enzymes, three biochemically and three histochemically determined. Acridine orange and gold both pointed to a high enrichment of the fractions, whereas most enzyme activities were more randomly distributed among the cells as a result of the isolation procedure. Our separation procedure yielded fractions highly enriched in either viable periportal or perivenous cells, both from one liver. The use of colloidal gold as a marker to monitor separation is a valuable alternative to the more risky estimation of enzyme activities.\n\nExpression of red-shifted green fluorescent protein by Escherichia coli O157:H7 as a marker for the detection of cells on fresh produce.\n\nPubMed\n\nTakeuchi, K; Frank, J F\n\n2001-03-01\n\nEscherichia coli O157:H7 was transformed with a plasmid vector red-shifted green fluorescence protein (pEGFP) to express red-shifted green fluorescence protein (EGFP) from Aequorea victoria. The EGFP expression among total cells and nonviable cells was determined at the cellular level by microscopic observation of immunostained and membrane-impermeable, dye-stained cultures, respectively. E. coli O157:H7 retained pEGFP during frozen storage at -80 degrees C. The percentage of EGFP expression was improved by repeated subculturing, reaching 83.4 +/- 0.1%, although the fluorescence intensity varied among cells. A low percentage of EGFP-expressing cells was nonviable. The percentage of EGFP decreased when the culture plate was kept at 4 degrees C, suggesting that some cells lost pEGFP during refrigeration. The storage of the culture suspension in sterile deionized water at 4 degrees C for 24 h reduced the percentage of EGFP expression, indicating that some EGFP was denatured. The application of EGFP as a marker for E. coli O157:H7 on green leaf lettuce, cauliflower, and tomato was evaluated using confocal scanning laser microscopy. EGFP-transformed cells were readily visible under confocal scanning laser microscopy on all produce types. The numbers of E. coli O157:H7 cells detected with EGFP were equivalent to those detected with immunostaining for green leaf lettuce and cauliflower but less for tomato. E. coli O157:H7 attached preferentially to damaged tissues of green leaf lettuce and tomato over intact tissue surfaces and to flowerets of cauliflower than to stem surfaces. EGFP can serve as a marker to characterize E. coli O157:H7 attachment on green leaf lettuce and cauliflower but may not be suitable on tomato.\n\nA Green Fluorescent Protein with Photoswitchable Emission from the Deep Sea\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVogt, Alexander; D'Angelo, Cecilia; Oswald, Franz; Denzel, Andrea; Mazel, Charles H.; Matz, Mikhail V.; Ivanchenko, Sergey; Nienhaus, G. Ulrich; Wiedenmann, JÃ¶rg\n\n2008-01-01\n\nA colorful variety of fluorescent proteins (FPs) from marine invertebrates are utilized as genetically encoded markers for live cell imaging. The increased demand for advanced imaging techniques drives a continuous search for FPs with new and improved properties. Many useful FPs have been isolated from species adapted to sun-flooded habitats such as tropical coral reefs. It has yet remained unknown if species expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like proteins also exist in the darkness of the deep sea. Using a submarine-based and -operated fluorescence detection system in the Gulf of Mexico, we discovered ceriantharians emitting bright green fluorescence in depths between 500 and 600 m and identified a GFP, named cerFP505, with bright fluorescence emission peaking at 505 nm. Spectroscopic studies showed that â¼15% of the protein bulk feature reversible ON/OFF photoswitching that can be induced by alternating irradiation with blue und near-UV light. Despite being derived from an animal adapted to essentially complete darkness and low temperatures, cerFP505 maturation in living mammalian cells at 37Â°C, its brightness and photostability are comparable to those of EGFP and cmFP512 from shallow water species. Therefore, our findings disclose the deep sea as a potential source of GFP-like molecular marker proteins.

We focus on the interpretation of reflectance spectra containing contributions from elastically scattered (reflected) photons as well as fluorescence emissions from a strong fluorophore (i.e., FS). A model-based approach to extract Î¼a and Î¼sâ§ in the presence of FS emission is validated in optical phantoms constructed with Intralipid (1% to 2% lipid) and whole blood (1% to 3% volume fraction), over a wide range of FS concentrations (0 to 1000 Î¼g/ml). The results show that modeling reflectance as a combination of elastically scattered light and attenuation-corrected FS-based emission yielded more accurate tissue parameter estimates when compared with a nonmodified reflectance model, with reduced maximum errors for blood volume (22% versus 90%), microvascular saturation (21% versus 100%), and Î¼sâ§ (13% versus 207%). Additionally, quantitative PpIX fluorescence sampled in the same phantom as FS showed significant differences depending on the reflectance model used to estimate optical properties (i.e., maximum error 29% versus 86%). These data represent a first step toward using quantitative optical spectroscopy to guide surgeries through simultaneous assessment of FS and PpIX.\n\nAnle138b and related compounds are aggregation specific fluorescence markers and reveal high affinity binding to Î±-synuclein aggregates.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeeg, Andreas A; Reiner, Anne M; Schmidt, Felix; Schueder, Florian; Ryazanov, Sergey; Ruf, Viktoria C; Giller, Karin; Becker, Stefan; Leonov, Andrei; Griesinger, Christian; Giese, Armin; Zinth, Wolfgang\n\n2015-09-01\n\nSpecial diphenyl-pyrazole compounds and in particular anle138b were found to reduce the progression of prion and Parkinson's disease in animal models. The therapeutic impact of these compounds was attributed to the modulation of Î±-synuclein and prion-protein aggregation related to these diseases. Photophysical and photochemical properties of the diphenyl-pyrazole compounds anle138b, anle186b and sery313b and their interaction with monomeric and aggregated Î±-synuclein were studied by fluorescence techniques. The fluorescence emission of diphenyl-pyrazole is strongly increased upon incubation with Î±-synuclein fibrils, while no change in fluorescence emission is found when brought in contact with monomeric Î±-synuclein. This points to a distinct interaction between diphenyl-pyrazole and the fibrillar structure with a high binding affinity (Kd=190Â±120nM) for anle138b. Several Î±-synuclein proteins form a hydrophobic binding pocket for the diphenyl-pyrazole compound. A UV-induced dehalogenation reaction was observed for anle138b which is modulated by the hydrophobic environment of the fibrils. Fluorescence of the investigated diphenyl-pyrazole compounds strongly increases upon binding to fibrillar Î±-synuclein structures. Binding at high affinity occurs to hydrophobic pockets in the fibrils. The observed particular fluorescence properties of the diphenyl-pyrazole molecules open new possibilities for the investigation of the mode of action of these compounds in neurodegenerative diseases. The high binding affinity to aggregates and the strong increase in fluorescence upon binding make the compounds promising fluorescence markers for the analysis of aggregation-dependent epitopes.

The fluorogenic substrates, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate, 4-methylutbel-liveryl acetate, and fluorecein diacetate, are acted upon by the enzymes Erythrocyte Acid Phospha, tase, Esterase-D, and Carbonic Anhydrase-III, respectively, to produce compounds visible to the analyst when viewed with transmitted UV light at 365 nm. Additionally, the choice of fluorogenic corn, pounds may help detect a specific enzyme from a related enzyme. One of the responsibilities of a forensic science laboratory may be the analysis of blood for genetically controlled polymorphic enzymes and protein markers. The genetic markers are said to be polymorphic because each exhibits types which can be differentiated and allows for the inclusion or exclusion of possible-donors of the blood. Each genetic marker can be separated into these recognizable types by electrophoresis, a technique which separates compounds based on electrical charges. Electrophoresis is conducted by placing a portion or extract of each bloodstain into a support medium which will conduct electricity. This is known as a plate or membrane. By controlling the pH of the buffer and the potential that is applied to the plate, the analyst can achieve separation of the types within an enzyme marker. The types appear as differing patterns of bands. Once the bloodstain has been subjected to electrophoresis, the enzymes must be visualized. This is generally best accomplished by using the specific activity of the enzyme. For the enzymes described in the present work, the visualization is performed by over-layering the plate with a piece of filter paper that 'has been saturated with the appropriate non-fluorescent substrate and buffer. The bands of enzyme, which is now in discrete patterns, will act upon the non-fluorescent substrate to create a fluorescent compound. The plate is then viewed with transmitted UV\n\nImproved Dye Stability in Single-Molecule Fluorescence Experiments\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEcheverrÃa Aitken, Colin; Marshall, R. Andrew; Pugi, Joseph D.\n\nComplex biological systems challenge existing single-molecule methods. In particular, dye stability limits observation time in singlemolecule fluorescence applications. Current approaches to improving dye performance involve the addition of enzymatic oxygen scavenging systems and small molecule additives. We present an enzymatic oxygen scavenging system that improves dye stability in single-molecule experiments. Compared to the currently-employed glucose-oxidase/catalase system, the protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase system achieves lower dissolved oxygen concentration and stabilizes single Cy3, Cy5, and Alexa488 fluorophores. Moreover, this system possesses none of the limitations associated with the glucose oxidase/catalase system. We also tested the effects of small molecule additives in this system. Biological reducing agents significantly destabilize the Cy5 fluorophore as a function of reducing potential. In contrast, anti-oxidants stabilize the Cy3 and Alexa488 fluorophores. We recommend use of the protocatechuate-3,4,-dioxygenase system with antioxidant additives, and in the absence of biological reducing agents. This system should have wide application to single-molecule fluorescence experiments.\n\nMagnetic-activated cell sorting for sperm preparation reduces spermatozoa with apoptotic markers and improves the acrosome reaction in couples with unexplained infertility.\n\nPubMed\n\nLee, Tsung-Hsien; Liu, Chung-Hsien; Shih, Yang-Tse; Tsao, Hui-Mei; Huang, Chun-Chia; Chen, Hsiu-Hui; Lee, Maw-Sheng\n\n2010-04-01\n\nCouples with unexplained infertility (UI) tend to have low fertilization rates with current IVF procedures. Here, we attempted to identify spermatozoa with apoptotic markers in couples with UI and unsuccessful intrauterine insemination (IUI) and we investigated the efficiency and benefit of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) for sperm preparation in such patients. Sixty couples with UI and two IUI failures were recruited. The sperm were prepared by conventional density gradient centrifugation (DGC) and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used as a control and the other was further processed by MACS (D + M). Apoptotic markers were identified using fluorescence-labeled dye and flow cytometry, including externalization of phosphatidylserine (EPS), disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and DNA fragmentation. The fertilization potential of prepared spermatozoa was analyzed by basic semen analysis, computer-aided sperm analysis and the induced acrosome reaction test (IART). After DGC, spermatozoa showed 18.6% EPS, 28.3% disrupted MMP and 13.5% DNA fragmentation. Numbers of spermatozoa with apoptotic markers were significantly reduced by D + M, versus DGC alone (P < 0.001). Although the motility of spermatozoa was slightly decreased after MACS, most sperm motion characteristics were not impaired. Interestingly, the IART significantly improved after D + M, versus DGC alone, especially for the couples with a normal hemizona assay (P < 0.001). The spermatozoa prepared by D + M showed a reduced level of apoptotic markers. Improvement in the IART suggests a high fertilization potential of the processed spermatozoa. The identification of apoptotic markers and use of MACS may be helpful in directing the management plan for patients with UI and multiple IUI failures.\n\nRatiometric fluorescence-imaging assays of plant membrane traffic using polyproteins.\n\nPubMed\n\nSamalova, Marketa; Fricker, Mark; Moore, Ian\n\n2006-12-01\n\nFluorescent protein markers are widely used to report plant membrane traffic; however, effective protocols to quantify fluorescence or marker expression are lacking. Here the 20 residue self-cleaving 2A peptide from Foot and Mouth Disease Virus was used to construct polyproteins that expressed a trafficked marker in fixed stoichiometry with a reference protein in a different cellular compartment. Various pairs of compartments were simultaneously targeted. Together with a bespoke image analysis tool, these constructs allowed biosynthetic membrane traffic to be assayed with markedly improved sensitivity, dynamic range and statistical significance using protocols compatible with the common plant transfection and transgenic systems. As marker and effector expression could be monitored in populations or individual cells, saturation phenomena could be avoided and stochastic or epigenetic influences could be controlled. Surprisingly, mutational analysis of the ratiometric assay constructs revealed that the 2A peptide was dispensable for efficient cleavage of polyproteins carrying a single internal signal peptide, whereas the signal peptide was essential. In contrast, a construct bearing two signal peptide/anchors required 2A for efficient separation and stability, but 2A caused the amino-terminal moiety of such fusions to be mis-sorted to the vacuole. A model to account for the behaviour of 2A in these and other studies in plants is proposed.\n\nSynthesis, quantitative structure-property relationship study of novel fluorescence active 2-pyrazolines and application.\n\nPubMed\n\nGirgis, Adel S; Basta, Altaf H; El-Saied, Houssni; Mohamed, Mohamed A; Bedair, Ahmad H; Salim, Ahmad S\n\n2018-03-01\n\nA variety of fluorescence-active fluorinated pyrazolines 13-33 was synthesized in good yields through cyclocondensation reaction of propenones 1-9 with aryl hydrazines 10-12 .

Quantitative structure-property relationship studies were undertaken supporting the exhibited fluorescence properties and estimating the parameters governing properties. Five synthesized fluorescence-active pyrazolines ( 13 , 15 , 18 , 19 and 23 ) with variable Î¦ were selected for treating two types of paper sheets (Fabriano and Bible paper). These investigated fluorescence compounds, especially compounds 19 and 23 , provide improvements in strength properties of paper sheets.

B.\n\n2012-05-01\n\nHybrid tracers that are both radioactive and fluorescent help extend the use of fluorescence-guided surgery to deeper structures. Such hybrid tracers facilitate preoperative surgical planning using (3D) scintigraphic images and enable synchronous intraoperative radio- and fluorescence guidance. Nevertheless, we previously found that improved orientation during laparoscopic surgery remains desirable. Here we illustrate how intraoperative navigation based on optical tracking of a fluorescence endoscope may help further improve the accuracy of hybrid surgical guidance. After feeding SPECT/CT images with an optical fiducial as a reference target to the navigation system, optical tracking could be used to position the tip of the fluorescence endoscope relative to the preoperative 3D imaging data. This hybrid navigation approach allowed us to accurately identify marker seeds in a phantom setup. The multispectral nature of the fluorescence endoscope enabled stepwise visualization of the two clinically approved fluorescent dyes, fluorescein and indocyanine green. In addition, the approach was used to navigate toward the prostate in a patient undergoing robot-assisted prostatectomy. Navigation of the tracked fluorescence endoscope toward the target identified on SPECT/CT resulted in real-time gradual visualization of the fluorescent signal in the prostate, thus providing an intraoperative confirmation of the navigation accuracy.\n\nImproving the Flight Path Marker Symbol on Rotorcraft Synthetic Vision Displays\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSzoboszlay, Zoltan P.; Hardy, Gordon H.; Welsh, Terence M.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nTwo potential improvements to the flight path marker symbol were evaluated on a panel-mounted, synthetic vision, primary flight display in a rotorcraft simulation. One concept took advantage of the fact that synthetic vision systems have terrain height information available ahead of the aircraft. For this first concept, predicted altitude and ground track information was added to the flight path marker. In the second concept, multiple copies of the flight path marker were displayed at 3, 4, and 5 second prediction times as compared to a single prediction time of 3 seconds. Objective and subjective data were collected for eight rotorcraft pilots. The first concept produced significant improvements in pilot attitude control, ground track control, workload ratings, and preference ratings. The second concept did not produce significant differences in the objective or subjective measures.\n\n5-Aminolevulinic Acid Induced Fluorescence Is a Powerful Intraoperative Marker for Precise Histopathological Grading of Gliomas with Non-Significant Contrast-Enhancement\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWidhalm, Georg; Kiesel, Barbara; Woehrer, Adelheid; Traub-Weidinger, Tatjana; Preusser, Matthias; Marosi, Christine; Prayer, Daniela; Hainfellner, Johannes A.; Knosp, Engelbert; Wolfsberger, Stefan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Intraoperative identification of anaplastic foci in diffusely infiltrating gliomas (DIG) with non-significant contrast-enhancement on MRI is indispensible to avoid histopathological undergrading and subsequent treatment failure. Recently, we found that 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) induced protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence can visualize areas with increased proliferative and metabolic activity in such gliomas intraoperatively. As treatment of DIG is predominantely based on histopathological World Health Organisation (WHO) parameters, we analyzed whether PpIX fluorescence can detect anaplastic foci according to these criteria. Methods We prospectively included DIG patients with non-significant contrast-enhancement that received 5-ALA prior to resection. Intraoperatively, multiple samples from PpIX positive and negative intratumoral areas were collected using a modified neurosurgical microscope. In all samples, histopathological WHO criteria and proliferation rate were assessed and correlated to the PpIX fluorescence status. Results A total of 215 tumor specimens were collected in 59 patients. Of 26 WHO grade III gliomas, 23 cases (85%) showed focal PpIX fluorescence, whereas 29 (91%) of 33 WHO grade II gliomas were PpIX negative. In intratumoral areas with focal PpIX fluorescence, mitotic rate, cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, and proliferation rate were significantly higher than in non-fluorescing areas. The positive predictive value of focal PpIX fluorescence for WHO grade III histology was 85%. Conclusions Our study indicates that 5-ALA induced PpIX fluorescence is a powerful marker for intraoperative identification of anaplastic foci according to the histopathological WHO criteria in DIG with non-significant contrast-enhancement. Therefore, application of 5-ALA optimizes tissue sampling for precise histopathological diagnosis independent of brain-shift.

P.; Rafii, Mohd Y.; Ismail, Mohd R.; Puteh, Adam; Latif, Mohammad A.; Ramli, Asfaliza\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAfter yield, quality is one of the most important aspects of rice breeding. Preference for rice quality varies among cultures and regions; therefore, rice breeders have to tailor the quality according to the preferences of local consumers. Rice quality assessment requires routine chemical analysis procedures. The advancement of molecular marker technology has revolutionized the strategy in breeding programs. The availability of rice genome sequences and the use of forward and reverse genetics approaches facilitate gene discovery and the deciphering of gene functions. A well-characterized gene is the basis for the development of functional markers, which play an important role in plant genotyping and, in particular, marker-assisted breeding. In addition, functional markers offer advantages that counteract the limitations of random DNA markers. Some functional markers have been applied in marker-assisted breeding programs and have successfully improved rice quality to meet local consumersâ preferences. Although functional markers offer a plethora of advantages over random genetic markers, the development and application of functional markers should be conducted with care. The decreasing cost of sequencing will enable more functional markers for rice quality improvement to be developed, and application of these markers in rice quality breeding programs is highly anticipated.

This article focuses on the design of fluorescence detection module that uses a photomultiplier tube(PMT) to detect weak fluorescence, and utilizes the single photon counting method to measure the fluorescence intensity, and then according to the relationship between the fluorescent marker and fluorescence intensity, the concentration of the analyte can be derived. Using fluorescein isothiocyanate(FITC, the most widely used fluorescein currently)to mark antibodies in the experiment, therefore, according to the maximum absorption wavelength and the maximum emission wavelength of the fluorescein isothiocyanate, to select the appropriate filters to set up the optical path. In addition, the fluorescence detection apparatus proposed in this paper uses an aspherical lens with large numerical aperture, in order to improve the capacity of signal acquisition more effectively, and the selective adoption of flexible optical fiber can realize a compact opto-mechanical structure, which is also conducive to the miniaturization of the device. The experimental results show that this apparatus has a high sensitivity, can be used for the detection and analysis of human nutrition.\n\nEvaluation of potential emission spectra for the reliable classification of fluorescently coded materials\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrunner, Siegfried; Kargel, Christian\n\n2011-06-01\n\nThe conservation and efficient use of natural and especially strategic resources like oil and water have become global issues, which increasingly initiate environmental and political activities for comprehensive recycling programs. To effectively reutilize oil-based materials necessary in many industrial fields (e.g. chemical and pharmaceutical industry, automotive, packaging), appropriate methods for a fast and highly reliable automated material identification are required. One non-contacting, color- and shape-independent new technique that eliminates the shortcomings of existing methods is to label materials like plastics with certain combinations of fluorescent markers (\"optical codes\", \"optical fingerprints\") incorporated during manufacture. Since time-resolved measurements are complex (and expensive), fluorescent markers must be designed that possess unique spectral signatures. The number of identifiable materials increases with the number of fluorescent markers that can be reliably distinguished within the limited wavelength band available. In this article we shall investigate the reliable detection and classification of fluorescent markers with specific fluorescence emission spectra. These simulated spectra are modeled based on realistic fluorescence spectra acquired from material samples using a modern VNIR spectral imaging system. In order to maximize the number of materials that can be reliably identified, we evaluate the performance of 8 classification algorithms based on different spectral similarity measures. The results help guide the design of appropriate fluorescent markers, optical sensors and the overall measurement system.\n\nImproved axial point spread function in a two-frequency laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWu, Jheng-Syong; Chung, Yung-Chin; Chien, Jun-Jei; Chou, Chien\n\n2018-01-01\n\nA two-frequency laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (TF-LSCFM) based on intensity modulated fluorescence signal detection was proposed.

This paper reports an improved UCNPs-based fluorescence probe for dual-sensing of Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and Deoxynivalenol (DON) using a magnetism-induced separation and the specific formation of antibody-targets complex. Herein, the improved UCNPs, which were namely NaYF4:Yb/Ho/Gd and NaYF4:Yb/Tm/Gd, were systematically studied based on the optimization of reaction time, temperature and the concentration of dopant ions with simultaneous phase and size controlled NaYF4 nanoparticles; and the targets were detected using the pattern of competitive combination assay. Under an optimized condition, the advanced fluorescent probes revealed stronger fluorescent properties, broader biological applications and better storage stabilities compared to traditional UCNPs-based ones; and ultrasensitive determinations of AFB1 and DON were achieved under a wide sensing range of 0.001-0.1Â ngÂ ml(-1) with the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.001Â ngÂ ml(-1). Additionally, the applicability of the improved nanosensor for the detection of mycotoxins was also confirmed in adulterated oil samples. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In order to estimate the level of oxidative damage, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine was determined directly in cells of tissue microscope slides using OxyDNA Assay Kit, Fluorometric. Cells were investigated under confocal microscope. Images of individual cells were captured by computer-interfaced digital photography and analyzed for fluorescence intensities (continuous inverted 8-bit gray-scale = 0 [black]-255 [white]). Fluorescence scores were calculated for each of 13 normal endometrial samples and 31 uterine adenocarcinoma specimens. Finally the level of the oxidative stress marker was also analyzed according to histological and clinical features of the neoplasms. The obtained data revealed that: 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine levels were higher in uterine adenocarcinomas than in normal endometrial samples (48,32 vs. 38,64; p<0,001); in contrast to normal endometrium there was no correlation between age and DNA oxidative modification content in uterine cancer; highest mean fluorescence intensity was recognized in G2 endometrial adenocarcinomas; level of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine does not depend on Body Mass Index (BMI) and cancer uterine wall infiltration or tumor FIGO stage. Our study indicates that accumulation of the oxidized DNA base may contribute to the development of endometrial neoplasia, however oxidative DNA damage does not seem to increase with tumor progression.\n\nNew molecular markers and cytogenetic probes enable chromosome identification of wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium introgression lines for improving protein and gluten contents.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Guangrong; Wang, Hongjin; Lang, Tao; Li, Jianbo; La, Shixiao; Yang, Ennian; Yang, Zujun\n\n2016-10-01\n\nNew m"
