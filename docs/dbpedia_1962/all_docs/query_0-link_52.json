        "text": "Diana Gurtskaya was born in Sukhumi in 1978 and was brought up in a friendly large family: her sister and two brothers grew up with her. Very quickly, the parents discovered a sad ailment in their daughter: she was born almost blind. Doctors argued that vision could not be restored. And yet, the parents did not despair, deciding, at least, to raise from Diana a worthy and useful person for society.\n\nDiana grew up as a cheerful and active child, practically not thinking that she was somehow different from other children. She had a fine ear and a pleasant voice, so the girl was assigned to a music class at a Tbilisi boarding school for children with disabilities. There she not only learned to sing, but also began to play the piano beautifully. From the age of 10, Diana often performed at music competitions and in 1995 won the Yalta-Moscow-Transit event.\n\nAfter winning a prestigious competition, the composer Igor Nikolaev became interested in the girl. It was he who wrote the first and main hit for the aspiring singer called \"You Are Here\". Diana Gurtskaya moved to Moscow and entered the famous \"Gnesinka\", graduating from pop education in 1999. In 2000, she recorded her first album with the already known to the public the title \"You Are Here\". Soon, another disc, \"You Know, Mom\" ​​followed.\n\nGurtskaya became one of the main artists at all-Russian concert evenings, and in 2008 she represented her native Georgia at the international Eurovision Song Contest. She also took part in the television show \"Dancing with the Stars\" and served as the ambassador of the Winter Olympics in Sochi. The singer released two more albums, entitled \"Tender\" and \"Nine Months\". Finally, Diana is a renowned philanthropist who is actively involved in solving many social issues.\n\nPersonal life\n\nDiana Gurtskaya met her only husband in 2002. The well-known lawyer Pyotr Kucherenko became him. The man very beautifully looked after his beloved and even managed to make it so that one of the recently discovered stars in the sky was named after her. As a result, the couple played a magnificent wedding. In a happy marriage, a son, Constantine, was born. Close people do not leave Diana a single step, trying to provide her with all possible support.\n\nToday Diana holds one of the important posts in the Public Chamber of Russia. She often travels to boarding schools, giving children “Lessons of Kindness” and helping them to adapt to the social environment. In addition, Gurtskaya hosts an author's program on Radio Russia, where she conducts conversations with famous people. She is currently working on recording new songs and the next album.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya knows firsthand how to live in a world without colors. But with her creativity, she enriched the musical world with millions of shades. And thanks to the activities of the singer's charitable foundation, many blind children were able to feel truly happy.\n\nChildhood\n\nDiana was born on July 2, 1978 in sunny Sukhumi. She was the youngest daughter of the Mingrelian family of Guda and Zaira Gurtskaya. Parents were already at a respectable age; my father used to work in a mine, and my mother taught at school. The baby was surrounded with love and care not only by parents, but also by older children - brothers Dzhambul and Robert and sister Eliso.\n\nFor the first months, Zaire did not notice her daughter's illness, but when the girl fell off the couch, breaking her face to blood, her mother rushed to the hospital. The doctors' verdict was disappointing - congenital blindness. Ophthalmologists did not give a single chance that the child would be able to see. It was a big blow for the whole family, but the parents decided not to focus on their daughter's illness, and raised Diana in the same way as the older children. “I grew up as an ordinary child - I just ran, fell, played pranks. They never felt sorry for me, although everyone took care of me, ”the singer recalled.\n\nAt the age of 7, Diana was sent to study at the Tbilisi boarding school for blind and visually impaired children, located five hundred kilometers from her home. The girl took a long time to get used to the new unfamiliar environment and was very homesick. After class, she came into the room and opened the suitcase with her things in order to smell her mother for a moment. Diana missed her the most. But when the schoolgirl came home and asked for an extra day to extend the vacation, the parents were adamant: “You must get an education. Go through life with your head held high! \"\n\nDiana Gurtskaya in the studio \"Let them talk\"\n\nWhen the girl was overcome with melancholy, she began to sing. This was her favorite pastime from early childhood - not yet having learned to speak well, Diana already memorized the melodies and sounds of the world around her, and then tried to reproduce them. Mom noticed her daughter's creative abilities, so she supported her in her striving to get a musical education as well. At the age of 8, Diana began to study with a vocal teacher, and after a couple of months she wanted to learn how to play the piano. But if in the boarding school the whole situation was adjusted to the characteristics of blind children, then in the music school it was much more difficult - the girl had to study on an equal basis with everyone else, relying only on her own memory and fine ear: “I almost forgot everything when I came home, and I had to start from scratch several times. But I couldn't live without music. And the harder it is, the more interesting it is! \"\n\nThe efforts of the stubborn schoolgirl bore fruit: already at the age of 10 she stood on the stage of the Tbilisi Philharmonic and sang a duet with Irma Sokhadze herself. This was the first deafening success of the young talent.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1995, 17-year-old Diana Gurtskaya applied to participate in the international pop song festival \"Yalta - Moscow - Transit\". For the competition, the singer chose the composition \"Tbiliso\". The soulful performance of the young Georgian woman did not leave indifferent even the masters of the Russian stage, among whom were Laima Vaikule, Mikhail Tanich, Igor Nikolaev, Alexander Malinin, Lolita and Igor Krutoy.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya - \"If the night is gone\", 1995\n\nAnd although Gurtskaya did not take first place, the jury awarded the singer with an extraordinary voice with a special prize. It was presented by the singer and composer Igor Nikolaev. This moment became the point of Diana's takeoff to the musical Olympus: Nikolaev offered cooperation to the talented performer, and she simply could not refuse.\n\nImmediately after this competition, the entire Gurtskaya family moved to Moscow. Here the youngest daughter of Guda and Zaira decided to continue her musical education - she entered the pop department at the Gnessin School. 18-year-old Diana, inspired by success, decided that she would be able to conquer another peak, and began to simultaneously master the stage skills at GITIS. But even this was not enough for Diana - in 2003 she received a master's degree from the Faculty of Arts of Moscow State University. Lomonosov.\n\nIn 1999, Gurtskaya sang for the first time Igor Nikolaev's song \"You Are Here\". The composition became an absolute hit, but the audience did not even suspect that for the singer herself it was a requiem song: “When this song was being created, my mother was still alive. But even then she was diagnosed with cancer. She managed to see a little that my dream came true. I'm a singer\". The composition instantly took off to the top of the charts, and Diana was invited to perform it on \"Song of the Year\". When Gurtskaya sang on the main stage of the country, Zaira was buried in Tbilisi: “I had the feeling that at the moment I was addressing my mother with this song. I had the impression that the whole audience knew then my history, my tragedy. \"\n\nIn 2000, the singer's debut album \"You Are Here\" was released, it included songs written for her by Igor Nikolaev and Sergey Chelobanov. Gurtskaya continued her collaboration with these composers, and two years later the second album with their songs, \"You Know, Mom\", was released. Tours began, duets with world famous singers, including Joseph Kobzon, Toto Cutugno, Al Bano, Demis Roussos.\n\nThe first performance of Diana Gurtskaya and Toto Cutugno\n\nA year later, another blow of fate awaited Diana - the singer's brother Dzhambul was severely beaten on the streets of Moscow. The guy was hospitalized, but the capital's doctors were unable to save his life. The family drama affected the singer's creativity, but Diana had many more achievements and victories ahead of her. In December 2006, Gurtskaya was awarded the title \"Honored Artist of Russia\". In 2008, she presented Georgia to the international Eurovision Song Contest, and a year later she became the Sochi 2014 Ambassador, as a person who popularizes the ideas of the Olympic and Paralympic Movement in Russia and the world.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya at Eurovision 2008\n\nIn 2011, the famous singer took part in the show \"Dancing with the Stars\", Sergei Balashov became her partner on the floor.\n\nIn 2010, the singer made another dream come true - she held the White Cane: Tolerance, Equality, Integration Festival. At the same time, a charitable foundation “At the Call of the Heart”, which provides assistance to children with absent or low vision, began its work. And in 2013, Gurtskaya became a member of the Commission on the Affairs of Persons with Disabilities under the President of the Russian Federation.\n\nPersonal life of Diana Gurtskaya\n\nDiana never devoted the press to her personal life until Pyotr Kucherenko appeared in her life. Irina Khakamada introduced the young people back in 2002. At first it was a business collaboration between a successful lawyer and an aspiring singer, but a year later they were published as a couple in love.\n\nWhen Peter decided to take a serious step and offered his beloved his hand and heart, Diana dodged the answer, wishing \"a star from the sky.\" Kucherenko promised to fulfill this desire too - and in 2004 a new star, discovered by astronomers, was named \"Diana Gurtskaya\".\n\nIn the video \"I'm losing you\" Diana Gurtskaya showed her face without glasses\n\nThe charitable foundation At the Call of the Heart is still functioning - Gurtskaya and Kucherenko continue to help children with vision problems.\n\nDiana Gudaevna Gurtskaya - Honored Artist of the Russian Federation, a Georgian woman who blew up the vastness of the pop industry of the Russian Federation at the beginning of the 21st century.
