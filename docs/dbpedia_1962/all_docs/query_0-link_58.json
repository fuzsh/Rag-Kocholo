        "text": "In keeping with the theme “Imaginative Education: Provoking Excellence Across the Curriculum” this paper proposes a “project of possibility”. In particular, this paper explores ways in which we can (re)imagine the concept of pre-service teacher, exploring pre-existing notions and diverse ways of knowing. Immigrant pre-service teachers, those with international experience disrupt the notion that pre-service teachers are white and middle class. The proposed project explores why diverse forms of knowledge and ways of knowing are important to Canada and Faculties of Education. When diversity is viewed as an asset, there is potential to broaden and enrich Canadian perspectives, attitudes, knowledge and worldviews and augment all education stakeholders’ understanding of “teacher” and “learner”.\n\nReturning seven years later to their original pieces from this landmark book, over 20 leading scholars and activists revisit and reframe their rich contributions to a burgeoning scholarship on Whiteness. With new refl ective writings for each chapter, and valuable sections on relevant readings and resources, this volume refreshes and enhances the fi rst text to pay critical and sustained attention to Whiteness in education, with implications far beyond national borders. Contributors include George Sefa Dei, Tracey Lindberg, Carl James, Cynthia Levine-Rasky, and the late Patrick Solomon. Courageously examining diverse perspectives, contexts, and institutional practices, contributors to this volume dismantle the underpinnings of inequitable power relations, privilege, and marginalization. The book's relevance extends to those in a range of settings, with abundant and poignant lessons for enhancing and understanding transformative social justice work in education. have given the contributors to their original 2007 text the opportunity to revisit, rethink, re-conceptualize, and reframe their earlier work. The result is an interesting, invigorating, and unsettling group of chapters that challenge readers to also revisit and rethink their own ideas about Whiteness, privilege, and power …. Teachers, administrators, policymakers, and researchers will all benefi t from this critical work. Sonia Nieto, Professor Emerita, Language, Literacy, and Culture College of Education, University of Massachusetts, Amherst Lund and Carr bring together a superb collection of authors who collectively challenge readers to go beyond liberal platitudes about race … until educators confront the political, social and economic consequences of inequitably distributed privilege, the path towards equality and freedom will remain elusive.\n\nThis article analyses the political and policy discourses of Quebec’s integration toolkit for immigrants. With a focus on value codes for immigrants, I argue first, that recent debate on accommodation of immigrants and religious minorities resuscitates the dominant historical narrative of Quebec’s fragility as a conquered settler colonial nation but where the major threat is defined as the cultural otherness of racialized immigrants and religious minorities. Second, such value codes instantiate a form of governmental strategy that combines neo-liberal and communitarian rationalities and insist on cultural assimilation as the price of entry into Quebec citizenship. Finally, the paper examines how Quebec’s current national imaginary of the ‘worrier nation’ maps spatially onto the urban-rural divide.\n\nThis thesis develops two normative standards for the evaluation of secondary-level Canadian civic education curricula, and evaluates British Columbia (B.C.)’s Civic Studies 11 and Ontario’s Civics (Politics) curricula accordingly. Both standards are concerned with the models of democracy that inform each curriculum and, more specifically, how these models open or close curricular spaces to prepare students to dissent in civic and political life. These standards are also sensitive to policymakers’ desire to increase Canadian youths’ civic engagement. Chapter One outlines the author’s agonist and semi- archic theoretical framework, positionality, research questions, and literature review. Chapter Two employs qualitative thematic analysis and determines that deliberative models of democracy inform both curricula. Chapters Three and Four use philosophical inquiry to develop normative evaluative standards based on critiques of deliberative democracy. Chapter Three makes the case that civics curricula should teach dissent as a positive right. Chapter Four argues that curricula should give critical attention to the passionate demands of civic life, especially as civic and political passions prepare students to exercise dissent. Chapter Five applies these standards to B.C.’s and Ontario’s civics curricula, and offers concluding thoughts."
