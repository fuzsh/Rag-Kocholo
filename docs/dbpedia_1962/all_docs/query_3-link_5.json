Together with Diana, parents raised 2 more brothers and a sister.\n\nWhen Diana was born, her parents did not know that their daughter was suffering from blindness.\n\nThey suspected something was wrong only after Diana lost her bearings and fell off the couch. Then, my mother turned to the doctors for help, and they made a disappointing diagnosis - blindness.\n\nAccording to experienced doctors, the girl did not have a single chance to see.\n\nIt was a big shock for mom and dad. Diana's parents were very wise, so they made the decision that their daughter would grow up and enjoy her childhood like the rest of the children.\n\nGurtskaya's fortitude manifested itself from an early age.

The debut disc was accepted with a bang by music lovers. As a result, Diana more than once turned to Chelobanov and Nikolaev for help.\n\nThe Russian singer releases three albums in a short period of time. We are talking about \"You know, mom\", \"Gentle\" and \"9 months\". Video clips were filmed for 8 songs.\n\nDiana does not stop at recording her albums. Gurtskaya begins to actively tour.\n\nThe singer became the representative of Georgia at the Eurovision 2008 international music contest, in 2011, together with Sergey Balashov, the star appeared on the Dancing with the Stars project, and in 2014 she became the ambassador of the Sochi Winter Olympics.\n\nInterestingly, at each of her performances or filming a video clip, Diana Gurtskaya appears in black glasses.\n\nMany were surprised that in 2014 the singer starred in her own video “They Lose You” without her obligatory accessory.\n\nA black veil, combined with evening make-up on her eyes, gave Gurtskaya the necessary charm and charm.\n\nIn the spring of 2017, the Russian singer in the Alla Dovlatova show will present a new musical composition \"Tales\".\n\nIn the same 2017, Diana presented her fifth studio album, called \"Panic\", which included such top songs as \"Star\", \"Bitch\", \"Snuffbox\" and others.\n\nWhen creating songs, the performer uses the national motives of various countries.\n\nSocial activity\n\nDiana Gurtskaya is not just a famous Russian singer, but also an active public figure.\n\nIt is known that the pop star manages to work in the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation.
