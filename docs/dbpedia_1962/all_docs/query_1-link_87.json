Leto Svet is performed maily in the Serbo-Croatian language with parts of the song in the German and Finnish languages.\n\nFinland\n\nSemi-Final (1)\n\nPerformer: Teräsbetoni\n\nSong title: Missä Miehet Ratsastaa\n\nSong writer(s): J. Ahola\n\nSong composer(s): J. Ahola\n\nAfter a string of Semi-Finals, Finnish tv viewers were asked to choose their performers and song for the upcoming 2008 Eurovision Song Contest.After winning with Lordi in 2006, Finland showed once again that it's a country that loves unusual and innovative music: the highest amount of votes went to the rockers of Teräsbetoni who will perform Missä Miehet Ratsastaa in the first Semi-Final of the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nFrance\n\nFinal\n\nPerformer: Sébastien Tellier\n\nSong title: Divine\n\nSong writer(s): Sebastien Tellier / Amandine de La Richardière\n\nSong composer(s): Sebastien Tellier\n\nAfter weeks of suspense and rumours, France made up its mind for Belgrade Sébastien Tellier will represent the country with a song titled Divine.\n\nSebastien Tellier is one of these few rare bred artists, combining virtuosity, humour and overall talent reminding us of entertainers à la Robert Wyatt, Syd Barret or Serge Gainsbourg. His live performances are considered as being intense, emotional experiences hypnotising the audience.\n\nF.Y.R. Macedonia\n\nSemi-Final (2)\n\nPerformer: Tamara, Vrčak & Adrijan\n\nSong title: Let Me Love You\n\nSong writer(s): Rade Vrchakovski-Vrcak\n\nSong composer(s): Rade Vrchakovski-Vrcak\n\nTamara, Vrčak & Adrian won the ticket for FYR Macedonia to the Eurovision Song Contest during the 2008 Skopje Festival. They will perform in English in Belgrade with the song Let Me Love You.\n\nTamara, Vrcak, and Adrijan are young, talented, and very popular performers in Macedonia.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSemi-Final (2)\n\nPerformer: Diana Gurtskaya\n\nSong title: Peace Will Come\n\nSong writer(s): Karen Kavaleryan\n\nSong composer(s): Kim Breitburg\n\nIn what was largely a two horse race in the Georgian national selection, Diana Gurtskaya won with the song Peace Will Come and will be only the second ever representative at the Eurovision Song Contest from Georgia.\n\nDiana Gurtskaya was born on July, 2nd, 1979 in Abkhazia in Georgia. She is blind from birth. During the armed conflict in Abkhazia, her family was forced to remove from their native town and she stayed in a camp for refugees and later moved to Russia.\n\nGermany\n\nFinal\n\nPerformer: No Angels\n\nSong title: Disappear\n\nSong writer(s): Remee, Hanne Sorvaag & Thomas Troelsen\n\nSong composer(s): Remee, Hanne Sorvaag & Thomas Troelsen\n\nGermany will be represented by the group No Angels. \"We welcome new challenges time and again - this is what defines us as a band and as girlfriends, we don't just try and do things the easy way, but we set ourselves goals that give us the possibility to develop as women and as artists,\" the group says.Their success story to date remains unique in the world of music and impressively illustrates that no one should underestimate girl power... No Angels took off in 2001 when the band won the first Popstars contest. Their debut single Daylight In Your Eyes and their album Elle'ments went straight to #1 of the Media Control Charts - and then they really kicked off with sold-out tours, countless music and media awards (Echo, Bambi) and gold as well as platinum awards. The albums Now... Us and Pure (top position #1) as well as the swing album When The Angels Swing silenced all critics because, by that time, the No Angels had long shaken off with a smile the clichés and prejudices associated with being a manufactured band."
