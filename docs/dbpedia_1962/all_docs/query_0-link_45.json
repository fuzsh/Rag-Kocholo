A.; Boyd, P. T.; Smale, A. P.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nThe low-mass X-ray binary 4U1705-44 exhibits dramatic long-term X-ray time variability with a timescale of several hundred days. The All-Sky Monitor (ASM) aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and the Japanese Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) aboard the International Space Station together have continuously observed the source from December 1995 through May 2014. The combined ASM-MAXI data provide a continuous time series over fifty times the length of the timescale of interest. Topological analysis can help us identify 'fingerprints' in the phase-space of a system unique to its equations of motion. The Birman-Williams theorem postulates that if such fingerprints are the same between two systems, then their equations of motion must be closely related. The phase-space embedding of the source light curve shows a strong resemblance to the double-welled nonlinear Duffing oscillator. We explore a range of parameters for which the Duffing oscillator closely mirrors the time evolution of 4U1705-44. We extract low period, unstable periodic orbits from the 4U1705-44 and Duffing time series and compare their topological information. The Duffing and 4U1705-44 topological properties are identical, providing strong evidence that they share the same underlying template. This suggests that we can look to the Duffing equation to help guide the development of a physical model to describe the long-term X-ray variability of this and other similarly behaved X-ray binary systems.\n\nExosat observations of 4U 1705-44 - Type I bursts and persistent emission\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLangmeier, A.; Sztajno, M.; Hasinger, G.; Truemper, J.; Gottwald, M.; EXOSAT Observatory, Noordwijk, Netherlands)\n\n1987-01-01\n\nDuring four Exosat observations, the bright galactic X-ray source 4U 1705-44 exhibited persistent emission variations from 1.3 to 10.7 x 10 to the -9th ergs/sq cm per sec in the 1-20 keV band. Type I X-ray bursts have been detected from this source whose properties correlate with source intensity. The burst shape changed with increasing intensity from a slow burst profile with a decay time of 100 sec to a feast profile with a decay time of 25 sec. The spectrum during maximum was best-fitted by a two-component model involving a blackbody together with a Boltzmann-Wien law, and an additional iron K emission line. 28 references\n\nPhotochemistry of U(BH4)4 and U(BD4)4\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPaine, R.T.; Schonberg, P.R.; Light, R.W.; Danen, W.C.; Freund, S.M.\n\n1979-01-01\n\nU(BH 4 ) 4 and U(BD 4 ) 4 are observed to undergo complex degradation reactions promoted by broadband UV radiation. The primary products of these reactions appear to be U(BH 4 ) 3 , B 2 H 6 , H 2 , U(BD 4 ) 3 , B 2 D 6 and D 2 . Further, U(BD 4 ) 4 undergoes a related decomposition reaction under the influence of CO 2 laser irradiation at 924.97 cm -1 .

For tidal captures of main-sequence stars into orbits too wide to begin mass transfer immediately, the subsequent evolution of the secondary can lead to a common envelope binary similar to what the 9 hr X-ray binary 4U 2127+12 in M15 is suspected to be. If the common envelope is thick enough, it may cause the neutron star and the white dwarf core of the secondary to spiral in, producing a detached white dwarf-neutron star system. Subsequently, gravitational radiation losses may evolve this into the configuration seen in the 11 minute X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 in NGC 6624. This model appears more likely on statistical grounds than formation by collision of a neutron star and a red giant. In some circumstances, the latter process may result in unstable mass transfer, which would result in coalescence rather than a binary system like 4U 1820-30. 34 references\n\n45 CFR 1705.10 - Fees.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 45 Public Welfare 4 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Fees. 1705.10 Section 1705.10 Public Welfare...

The hard X-ray view of those outbursts, which is quite different from that of the soft X-ray band, suggests that there are several types of outbursts which result in different hard X-ray outburst profile - the outburst profiles are energy dependent. One type is the low/hard state outbursts, the other type is the outburst showing transitions from the low/hard state to the high/soft state, or to the intermediate or to the very high state. The later has an initial low/hard state, introducing the phenomena that the hard X-ray precedes the soft X-ray in the outburst rise. Such outbursts in XTE J1550-564, Aql X-1 and 4U 1705-44 support a two-accretion-flow model which involves one Keplerian disk flow and one sub-Keplerian flow for the initial outburst rise\n\n12 CFR 1705.24 - Settlement.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-01-01\n\n... 12 Banks and Banking 7 2010-01-01 2010-01-01 false Settlement. 1705.24 Section 1705.24 Banks and...

The observations were made with the 48-inch Cassegrain reflector at the Kryonerion Station of the National Observatory of Athens, Greece. The individual observations of 44i Bootis are presented for years 1980 and 1988 and are also discussed.

H. D.; Sokoloski, J. L.; Mukai, K.; Markwardt, C. B.; Tueller, J.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe present an analysis of the X-ray variability of three symbiotic X-ray binaries, GX 1+4, 4U 1700+24, and 4U 1954+31, using observations made with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) and the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All-Sky Monitor (ASM). Observations of 4U 1954+31 with the Swift BAT show modulation at a period near 5 hours. Models to explain this modulation are discussed including the presence of an exceptionally slow X-ray pulsar in the system and accretion instabilities. We conclude that the most likely interpretation is that 4U 1954+31 contains one of the slowest known X-ray pulsars. Unlike 4U 1954+31, neither GX 1+4 nor 4U 1700+24 show any evidence for modulation on a timescale of hours. An analysis of the RXTE ASM light curves of GX l+4, 4U 1700+24, and 4U 1954+31 does not show the presence of periodic modulation in any source, although there is considerable variability on long timescales for all three sources. There is no modulation in GX 1+4 on either the optical 1161 day orbital period or a previously reported 304 day X-ray period. For 4U 1700+24 we do not confirm the 404 day period previously proposed for this source from a shorter duration ASM light curve.\n\nThe disc-jet coupling in the neutron star X-ray binary 4U 1728-34\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nTudose, Valeriu; Tzioumis, Anastasios; Belloni, Tomaso; Altamirano, Diego; Linares, Manuel; Mendez, Mariano; Hiemstra, Beike\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe present radio proposal is part of a multi-wavelength campaign focused on the study of the accretion/ejection process in the neutron star X-ray binary system 4U 1728-34.

We show that the generic off-shell sigma model action is the general action of constrained analytic superfields q (1,1) representing twisted N=4 multiplets in (4,4) harmonic superspace. The massive term of q (1,1) is shown to be unique; it generates a scalar potential the form of which is determined by the metric on the target bosonic manifold. We discuss in detail (4,4) supersymmetric group manifold SU(2)xU(1) WZNW sigma model and its Liouville deformation. A deep analogy of the relevant superconformally invariant analytic superfield action to that of the improved tensor N=2 4D multiplet is found. We define (4,4) duality transformation and find new off-shell dual representations of the previously constructed actions via unconstrained analytic (4,4) superfields. The main peculiarities of the (4,4) duality transformation are: (i) It preserves manifest (4,4) supersymmetry; (ii) dual actions reveal a gauge invariance needed for the onshell equivalence to the original description; (iii) in the actions dual to the massive ones 2D supersymmetry is modified off shell by SU(2) tensor central charges. The dual representation suggests some hints of how to describe (4,4) models with non-commuting complex structures in the harmonic superspace.

S.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe 0.1-2.4 keV bandpass of the ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC) offers an opportunity to study the very soft X-ray continuum of bright low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In 46 pointed observations, 23 LMXBs were observed with count rates between 0.4 and 165.4 counts s-1. The survey identified a total of 29 different luminosity levels, which are compared with observations and identified spectral states from other missions. The atoll source 4U 1705-44 was observed near Eddington luminosities in an unusually high intensity state. Spectral analysis provided a measure of the interstellar column density for all 49 observations. The sensitivity of spectral fits depends strongly on column density. Fits to highly absorbed spectra are merely insensitive toward any particular spectral model. Sources with column densities well below 1022 cm-2 are best fitted by power laws, while the blackbody model gives clearly worse fits to the data. Most single-component fits from sources with low column densities, however, are not acceptable at all. The inclusion of a blackbody component in eight sources can improve the fits significantly. The obtained emission radii of less than 5 km suggest emission from the neutron star surface. In 10 sources acceptable fits can only be achieved by including soft-line components. With a spectral resolution of the PSPC of 320-450 eV, between 0.6 and 1.2 keV unresolved broad-line features were detected around 0.65, 0.85, and 1.0 keV. The line fluxes range within 10-11 and 10-12 ergs cm-2 s-1, with equivalent widths between 24 and 210 eV. In LMC X-2, 2S 0918-549, and 4U 1254-690, line emission is indicated for the first time. The soft emission observed in 4U 0614+091 compares with recent ASCA results, with a new feature indicated at 1.31 keV. The deduced line fluxes in 4U 1820-30 and Cyg X-2 showed variability of a factor of 2 within timescales of 1-2 days. Average fluxes of line components in 4U 1820-30 varied by the same factor over a\n\nX1908+075: An X-Ray Binary with a 4.4 Day Period\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWen, Linqing; Remillard, Ronald A.; Bradt, Hale V.\n\n2000-04-01\n\nX1908+075 is an optically unidentified and highly absorbed X-ray source that appeared in early surveys such as Uhuru, OSO 7, Ariel 5, HEAO-1, and the EXOSAT Galactic Plane Survey. These surveys measured a source intensity in the range 2-12 mcrab at 2-10 keV, and the position was localized to ~0.5d. We use the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All-Sky Monitor (ASM) to confirm our expectation that a particular Einstein/IPC detection (1E 1908.4+0730) provides the correct position for X1908+075. The analysis of the coded mask shadows from the ASM for the position of 1E 1908.4+0730 yields a persistent intensity ~8 mcrab (1.5-12 keV) over a 3 yr interval beginning in 1996 February. Furthermore, we detect a period of 4.400+/-0.001 days with a false-alarm probability less than 10-7. The folded light curve is roughly sinusoidal, with an amplitude that is 26% of the mean flux. The X-ray period may be attributed to the scattering and absorption of X-rays through a stellar wind combined with the orbital motion in a binary system. We suggest that X1908+075 is an X-ray binary with a high-mass companion star.\n\nEPAs SPECIATE 4.4 Database: Development and Uses\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSPECIATE is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencyâs (EPA) repository of source category-specific particulate matter (PM), volatile organic gas, and other gas speciation profiles of air pollutant emissions.

Our timing measurements for 4U 1538-522 find the pulse period to have exhibited a spin-up trend until approximately 2009, after which there is evidence for a torque reversal, with the source beginning to spin down to the most recently measured period of 525.407 plus or minus 0.001 seconds. The most recent INTEGRAL observations of 4U 1907+09 are not found to yield statistically significant pulse periods due to the significantly lower flux from the source compared with 4U 1538-522. A spectral model consisting of a power-law continuum with an exponential cutoff and modified by two cyclotron resonance scattering features is found to fit both sources well, with the cyclotron scattering features detected at approximately 22 and approximately 49 kiloelectronvolts for 4U 1538-522 and at approximately 18 and approximately 36 kiloelectronvolts for 4U 1907+09. The spectral parameters of 4U 1538-522 are generally not found to vary significantly with flux and there is little to no variation across the torque reversal. Examining our results in conjunction with previous work, we find no evidence for a correlation between cyclotron line energy and luminosity for 4U 1538-522. 4U 1907+09 shows evidence for a positive correlation between cyclotron line energy and luminosity, which would make it the fourth, and lowest luminosity, cyclotron line source to exhibit this relationship.\n\nWind accretion in the massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54: abnormally slow wind and a moderately eccentric orbit\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRibÃ³, M.; Negueruela, I.; Blay, P.; TorrejÃ³n, J. M.; Reig, P.\n\n2006-04-01\n\nMassive X-ray binaries are usually classified by the properties of the donor star in classical, supergiant and Be X-ray binaries, the main difference being the mass transfer mechanism between the two components. The massive X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 does not fit in any of these groups, and deserves a detailed study to understand how the transfer of matter and the accretion on to the compact object take place. To this end we study an IUE spectrum of the donor and obtain a wind terminal velocity (v_â) of ~350 km s-1, which is abnormally slow for its spectral type. We also analyse here more than 9 years of available RXTE/ASM data. We study the long-term X-ray variability of the source and find it to be similar to that observed in the wind-fed supergiant system Vela X-1, reinforcing the idea that 4U 2206+54 is also a wind-fed system. We find a quasi-period decreasing from ~270 to ~130 d, noticed in previous works but never studied in detail. We discuss possible scenarios for its origin and conclude that long-term quasi-periodic variations in the mass-loss rate of the primary are probably driving such variability in the measured X-ray flux. We obtain an improved orbital period of P_orb=9.5591Â±0.0007 d with maximum X-ray flux at MJD 51856.6Â±0.1. Our study of the orbital X-ray variability in the context of wind accretion suggests a moderate eccentricity around 0.15 for this binary system. Moreover, the low value of v_â solves the long-standing problem of the relatively high X-ray luminosity for the unevolved nature of the donor, BD +53Â°2790, which is probably an O9.5 V star. We note that changes in v_â and/or the mass-loss rate of the primary alone cannot explain the different patterns displayed by the orbital X-ray variability. We finally emphasize that 4U 2206+54, together with LS 5039, could be part of a new population of wind-fed HMXBs with main sequence donors, the natural progenitors of supergiant X-ray binaries.\n\n37 CFR 1.705 - Patent term adjustment determination.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-07-01\n\n... 37 Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights 1 2010-07-01 2010-07-01 false Patent term adjustment determination. 1.705 Section 1.705 Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE GENERAL RULES OF PRACTICE IN PATENT CASES Adjustment and Extension of Patent Term...\n\nIsometries and binary images of linear block codes over â¤4 + uâ¤4 and â¤8 + uâ¤8\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSison, Virgilio; Remillion, Monica\n\n2017-10-01\n\nLet {{{F}}}2 be the binary field and â¤2 r the residue class ring of integers modulo 2 r , where r is a positive integer. For the finite 16-element commutative local Frobenius non-chain ring â¤4 + uâ¤4, where u is nilpotent of index 2, two weight functions are considered, namely the Lee weight and the homogeneous weight. With the appropriate application of these weights, isometric maps from â¤4 + uâ¤4 to the binary spaces {{{F}}}24 and {{{F}}}28, respectively, are established via the composition of other weight-based isometries. The classical Hamming weight is used on the binary space. The resulting isometries are then applied to linear block codes over â¤4+ uâ¤4 whose images are binary codes of predicted length, which may or may not be linear. Certain lower and upper bounds on the minimum distances of the binary images are also derived in terms of the parameters of the â¤4 + uâ¤4 codes. Several new codes and their images are constructed as illustrative examples. An analogous procedure is performed successfully on the ring â¤8 + uâ¤8, where u 2 = 0, which is a commutative local Frobenius non-chain ring of order 64. It turns out that the method is possible in general for the class of rings â¤2 r + uâ¤2 r , where u 2 = 0, for any positive integer r, using the generalized Gray map from â¤2 r to {{{F}}}2{2r-1}.\n\nThe urokinase receptor and its structural homologue C4.4A in human cancer\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJacobsen, B; Ploug, M\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and its structural homologue C4.4A are multidomain members of the Ly6/uPAR/alpha-neurotoxin protein domain family.

D.; Fuerst, Felix; Wilms, Jorn\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe symbiotic X-ray binary (SyXB) 4U 1954+319 is a rare system hosting a peculiar neutron star (NS) and an M-type optical companion. Its approx. 5.4 hr NS spin period is the longest among all known accretion-powered pulsars and exhibited large (is approx. 7%) fluctuations over 8 yr. A spin trend transition was detected with Swift/BAT around an X-ray brightening in 2012. The source was in quiescent and bright states before and after this outburst based on 60 ks Suzaku observations in 2011 and 2012. The observed continuum is well described by a Comptonized model with the addition of a narrow 6.4 keV Fe-K alpha line during the outburst. Spectral similarities to slowly rotating pulsars in high-mass X-ray binaries, its high pulsed fraction (approx. 60%-80%), and the location in the Corbet diagram favor high B-field (approx. greater than 10(exp12) G) over a weak field as in low-mass X-ray binaries. The observed low X-ray luminosity (10(exp33)-10(exp35) erg s(exp-1)), probable wide orbit, and a slow stellar wind of this SyXB make quasi-spherical accretion in the subsonic settling regime a plausible model. Assuming a approx. 10(exp13) G NS, this scheme can explain the approx. 5.4 hr equilibrium rotation without employing the magnetar-like field (approx. 10(exp16) G) required in the disk accretion case. The timescales of multiple irregular flares (approx. 50 s) can also be attributed to the free-fall time from the AlfvÂ´en shell for a approx. 10(exp13) G field. A physical interpretation of SyXBs beyond the canonical binary classifications is discussed.\n\nQuantitative dissolution of (U, Pu)O2 MOX (0.4% to 44% PuO2) using microwave heating technique\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMalav, R.K.; Fulzele, Ajit K.; Prakash, Amrit; Afzal, Md.; Panakkal, J.P.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nAFFF has fabricated the (U, Pu)O 2 mixed oxide fuels for PHWRs, BWRs, PFBRs and FBTRs.

We found anti-correlations in three outbursts occurred in 1998, 2002, and 2010, and we found significant time lags of several hundreds of seconds in the latter two outbursts. Our results show no correlation between the soft and hard X-rays in the extreme island state and a dominated positive correlation in the lower banana state. Anti-correlations are presented at the upper banana state for the outburst of 2010 and at the island and the lower left banana states for the other two outbursts. So far for atoll sources, the cross-correlation has been studied statistically only for 4U 1735-44, where anti-correlations showed up in the upper banana state. Here our investigation on 4U 1608-52 provides a similar result in its 2010 outburst. In addition, we notice that the luminosities in the upper banana of the 1998 and 2002 outbursts are about 1.5 times that of the 2010 outburst whose luminosity in the upper banana is close to that of 4U 1735-44. The results suggest that the states in the color-color diagram of a source could be correlated with the luminosity of the source. A further spectral analysis during the 2010 outburst is also shown, which suggests that the disk can be a little truncated in the upper banana. The feature on the upper banana is similar to the previous results of the flaring branch in Z sources.\n\nEquilibrium electrode U(4)-U and redox U(4)-U(3) potentials in molten alkali metal chlorides medium\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSmirnov, M V; Kudyakov, V Ya; Komarov, V E; Salyulev, A B [AN SSSR, Sverdlovsk.

The underlying untwisted (4,4) non linear Ï-models are studied. A method of deriving chiral (4,0) and (0,4) models is presented. The Lagrange superparameter leading to the constraint specifying the hyperkahler manifold structure is predicted and its relation to the matter superfield is stated in a covariant way. A known construction is recovered. We show also that (4,4) model is not a direct sum of the chiral ones. Finally a twisted (4,4-bar) model is obtained.

The response of 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl receptors is dominated by two successive one-electron reduction processes at -0.9 and -1.6 V versus AgCl/Ag. 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)biphenyl-containing receptors display two one-electron oxidations above +0.8 and +1.0 V. In both cases, a dihedral/planar interconversion precedes the second electron transfer step. Upon application of moderate (0.05-0.2 T) static magnetic fields to the electrochemical cell, the rate of such dihedral/planar interconversion is lowered for both the reduction of 4,4'-dinitrobiphenyl receptors and the oxidation of 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)biphenyl lactams. The electrochemical response of N-methylated receptors, for which different cisoid-cisoid, cisoid-transoid, and transoid-transoid forms exist, exhibits a significant peak splitting that can be associated to the presence of such conformational isomers. Application of magnetic fields produces a relative enhancement of some peaks that can be interpreted in terms of differential magnetoconvection involving such conformational isomers.

In the island state, the observations do not show any obvious correlations, and most observations of the banana branch show a positive correlation. However, anti-correlations are detected in the upper banana branch. These results are different from those of Z-sources (Cyg X-2, GX 5-1), where anti-correlations are detected in the horizontal branch and upper normal branch. In this case, the lag timescales of both this atoll and Z-sources are found to be similar, at a magnitude of several tens to hundreds of seconds. As a comparison, it is noted that anti-correlated lags lasting thousands of seconds have been reported from several black hole candidates in their intermediate states. In addition, for an observation containing four segments that show positive or anti-correlation, we analyze the spectral evolution with the hybrid model. In the observation, the anti-correlation is detected at the highest flux. The fitting results show that the Comptonized component is not the lowest at the highest flux, which suggests that the anti-correlation corresponds to the transition between the soft and hard states.

In the present study, we chose three linkers 4,4'-bpy, 4,4'-bpe and bix (see , respectively, for their structural drawings), that differ in terms of their molecular dimensions. The crystal structures of compounds 1-3 are described here in terms of their supramolecular diversities that include Ï-Ï interactions, not only among aromatic stacking (compounds 1 and 3), but also between an aromatic ring and an ethylenic double bond (compound 2).

Chloroanhydride was obtained by treatment of this acid with thionyl chloride. 2,2â-[Biphenyl-4,4â-diylbis(oxy] Â bis-[N-(2-aminoalkylacetamides] were synthesized in the biphasic media (dichloromethane/ aqueous sodium carbonate.

The absence of hemolytic properties for obtained compounds was shown, unlike similar 4,4â-aminoalkoxybiphenyls for which a significant hemolysis was shown. Thus, replacement of the ethylene group with amide group in the side chain of 4,4â-bissubstituted biphenyls significantly reduces hemolytic properties.\n\nN = (4,4 Supersymmetry and T-Duality\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMalin GÃ¶teman\n\n2012-10-01\n\nFull Text Available A sigma model with four-dimensional target space parametrized by chiral and twisted chiral N =(2,2 superfields can be extended to N =(4,4 supersymmetry off-shell, but this is not true for a model of semichiral fields, where the N = (4,4 supersymmetry can only be realized on-shell. The two models can be related to each other by T-duality. In this paper we perform a duality transformation from a chiral and twisted chiral model with off-shell N = (4,4 supersymmetry to a semichiral model. We find that additional non-linear terms must be added to the original transformations to obtain a semichiral model with N =(4,4 supersymmetry, and that the algebra closes on-shell as a direct consequence of the T-duality.\n\n27 CFR 4.4 - Delegations of the Administrator.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2010-04-01\n\n... 27 Alcohol, Tobacco Products and Firearms 1 2010-04-01 2010-04-01 false Delegations of the Administrator. 4.4 Section 4.4 Alcohol, Tobacco Products and Firearms ALCOHOL AND TOBACCO TAX AND TRADE BUREAU, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY LIQUORS LABELING AND ADVERTISING OF WINE Scope Â§ 4.4 Delegations of the...\n\nPhase lags of quasi-periodic oscillations across source states in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nde Avellar, Marcio G. B.\n\n2017-06-01\n\nThe majority of attempts to explain the origin and phenomenology of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) detected in low-mass X-ray binaries invoke dynamical models, and it was just in recent years that renewed attention has been given on how radiative processes occurring in these extreme environments gives rise to the variability features observed in the X-ray light curves of these systems. The study of the dependence of the phase lags upon the energy and frequency of the QPOs is a step towards this end. The methodology we developed here allowed us to study for the first time these dependencies for all QPOs detected in the range of 1 to 1300 Hz in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636-53 as the source changes its state during its cycle in the colour-colour diagram. Our results suggest that within the context of models of up-scattering Comptonization, the phase lags dependencies upon frequency and energy can be used to extract size scales and physical conditions of the medium that produces the lags.\n\nProbing the Mysteries of the X-Ray Binary 4U 1210-64 with ASM, MAXI and Suzaku\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nColey, Joel B.; Corbet, R.; Mukai, K.; Pottschmidt, K.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nOptical and X-ray observations of 4U 1210-64 (1ES 1210-646) suggest that the source is a High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) probably powered by the Be mechanism. Data acquired by the RXTE All Sky Monitor (ASM), the ISS Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) and Suzaku provide a detailed temporal and spectral description of this poorly understood source. Long-term data produced by ASM and MAXI indicate that the source shows two distinct high and low states. A 6.7-day orbital period of the system was found in folded light curves produced by both ASM and MAXI. A two day Suzaku observation in Dec. 2010 took place during a transition from the minimum to the maximum of the folded light curve. The two day Suzaku observation reveals large variations in flux indicative of strong orbit to orbit variability. Flares in the Suzaku light curve can reach nearly 1.4 times the mean count rate. From a spectral analysis of the Suzaku data, emission lines in the Fe K alpha region were detected at 6.4 keV, 6.7 keV and 6.97 keV interpreted as FeI, FeXXV and FeXXVI. In addition, emission lines were observed at approximately 1.0 and 2.6 keV, corresponding to NeX and SXVI respectively. Thermal bremsstrahlung or power law models both modified by interstellar and partially covering absorption provide a good fit to the continuum data. This source is intriguing for these reasons: i) No pulse period was observed; ii) 6.7 day orbital period is much less than typical orbital periods seen in Be/X-ray Binaries; iii) The optical companion is a B5V--an unusual spectral class for an HMXB; iv) There are extended high and low X-ray states.\n\nOptimization of binary breeder reactor V - Binary breeder reactors with two and four zones and a conventional LMFBR - (Pu/U) of two zones\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDias, A.F.; Ishiguro, Y.\n\n1986-04-01\n\nComparative analyses of a commercial-size Pu/U-fueled liquid metal fast breeder reactor and two binary breeder reactors with different numbers of enrichment zones have been done. Principal parameters of comparison are safety and breeding characteristics and reactivity losses during an operational cycle. The comparison shows that in a binary breeder reactor, good breeding characteristics in both cycles, Pu/U and U/Th, in addition to a possibility of an efficient utilization of thorium, and superior inherent safety than current LMFBRs can be achieved.

The study of the dependence of the phase lags upon the energy and frequency of the QPOs is a step towards this end. The methodology we developed here allowed us to study for the first time these dependencies for all QPOs detected in the range of 1 to 1300 Hz in the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1636â53 as the source changes its state during its cycle in the colour-colour diagram. Our results suggest that within the context of models of up-scattering Comptonization, the phase lags dependencies upon frequency and energy can be used to extract size scales and physical conditions of the medium that produces the lags.

Minor additions of carbon and boron in U-Si samples revealed that the formation of U 5 Si 4 would be correlated to the presence of these light elements, questioning its existence in the U-Si system. To evaluate the boron potential as a stimulant for non-metallic light elements of the second period (C, N, O), the isothermal section of the ternary phase diagram U-Si-B has been drawn at 927 C, disclosing solid equilibrium mainly between the UB and U-Si binary axes and the existence of the novel compound U 20 Si 16 B 3 , isostructural to the carbon equivalent one. These results suggest a specific behavior for a given light element on the U-Si phase relations. The isothermal section at 900 C of the U-Pt-Si ternary system was experimentally determined, leading to the discovery of 14 new phases, among which U 3 Pt 4 Si 6 , U 3 Pt 6 Si 4 and U 3 Pt 7 Si crystallized in their own structural type. As a prerequisite for this study, the phase relations in the U-Pt binary phase diagram were re-examined for the composition range 30 at.% and 70 at.% Pt, leading to a new assessment of the phase diagram which comprises the new U 3 Pt 4 compound. The temperature of the transformations has been measured by DTA. By coupling our experimental results to the literature data, a modeling of the phase diagram by the Calphad method was performed. Physical characterizations of the new U 3 Pt 4 compound revealed a moderate heavy fermion behavior, with ferromagnetic ordering below Tc = 7(1) K. As a side project, a study of the U 3 TGe 5 family with the anti-Hf 5 CuSn 3 structural type lead to the discovery of nine new compounds for T = V, Cr, Mn, Zr, Nb, Mo, Hf, Ta and W in addition to the previously reported U 3 TiGe 5 .

We identified and removed four Type I X-ray bursts during the observation in order to study the persistent emission. The continuum spectrum is hard and described well by a blackbody with kT=1.5 keV and a cutoff power law with Lambda = 1.5, and a cutoff temperature of 25 keV. Residuals between 6 and 8 keV provide strong evidence of a broad Fe K(alpha) line. By modeling the spectrum with a relativistically blurred reflection model, we find an upper limit for the inner disk radius of R(sub in) < or = 2R(sub ISCO). Consequently, we find that R(sub NS) < or = 23 km, assuming M = 1.4 Stellar Mass and a = 0.15. We also find an upper limit on the magnetic field of B < or =2 x 10(exp 8) G.\n\nExpression of C4.4A, a structural uPAR homolog, reflects squamous epithelial differentiation in the adult mouse and during embryogenesis\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nKriegbaum, Mette Camilla; Jacobsen, Benedikte; Hald, Andreas\n\n2011-01-01\n\nby a comprehensive immunohistochemical mapping.

We focus here on a comparative analysis of the reflection component from a series of spectroscopic studies on selected sources: 4U 1705-44, observed both in the soft and hard state, the pulsating ms pulsars SAX J1808.4-3658 and IGR J17511-3057, and the intermittent pulsar HETE J1900-2455. Although the sources can present very similar accretion rates and continuum shapes, the reflection parameters do not generally result the same, moreover the effect of a magnetosphere on the formation of the reflection component appears elusive.\n\n4,4â-Bis(4-octylphenoxy)-2,2â-bipyridine\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nZhen-Ting Du; Jun-Ru Wang; Ru Liu; Yan Xu\n\n2009-01-01\n\n4,4â-Bis(4-octylphenoxy)-2,2â-bipyridine which can be used in complexes of ruthenium was synthesized.

H. D.; Markwardt, C.; Tueller, J.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nObservations of the high-mass X-ray binary 4U 2206+54 with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) do not show modulation at the previously reported period of 9.6 days found from observations made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) All-Sky Monitor (ASM). Instead, the strongest peak in the power spectrum of the BAT light curve occurs at a period of 19.25+/-0.08 days, twice the period found with the RXTE ASM. The maximum of the folded BAT light curve is also delayed compared to the maximum of the folded ASM light curve. The most recent ASM data folded on twice the 9.6 day period show 'similar morphology to the folded BAT light curve. This suggests that the apparent period doubling is a recent secular change rather than an energy-dependent effect. The 9.6 day period is thus not a permanent strong feature of the light curve. We suggest that the orbital period of 4U 2206+54 may be twice the previously proposed value.\n\n4,4â-Bis(4-octylphenoxy-2,2â-bipyridine\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZhen-Ting Du\n\n2009-12-01\n\nFull Text Available 4,4â-Bis(4-octylphenoxy-2,2â-bipyridine which can be used in complexes of ruthenium was synthesized.

In the conventional N=(4,4), 2D superspace they are described by the superfields q ia , q Ia , q IA , subjected to proper differential constraints, (i, I, a, A) being the doublet indices of four groups SU(2) which form the full R-symmetry group SO(4) L xSO(4) R of N=(4,4) supersymmetry. We construct the torsionful off-shell sigma-model actions for each type of these multiplets, as well as the corresponding invariant mass terms, in an analytic subspace of the SU(2)xSU(2) harmonic superspace. As an instructive example, N=(4,4) superconformal extension of the SU(2)xU(1) WZNW sigma-model action and its massive deformation are presented for the multiplet q iA . We prove that N=(4,4) supersymmetry requires the general sigma-model action of pair of different multiplets to split into a sum of sigma-model actions of each multiplet. This phenomenon also persists if a larger number of non-equivalent multiplets are simultaneously included. We show that different multiplets may interact with each other only through mixed mass terms which can be set up for multiplets belonging to 'self-dual' pairs (q ia , q IA ) and (q Ia , q iA ). The multiplets from different pairs cannot interact at all. For a 'self-dual' pair of the twisted multiplets we give the most general form of the on-shell scalar potential\n\n4,4â²-Bipyridinium bis(perchlorateâ4-aminobenzoic acidâ4,4â²-bipyridineâwater (1/4/2/2\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nQun-Hui Meng\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull Text Available In the structure of the title compound, C10H10N22+Â·2ClO4âÂ·4C7H7NO2Â·2C10H8N2Â·2H2O, the 4,4â²-bipyridinium cation has a crystallographically imposed centre of symmetry.

The Doppler effect is small as expected in a metal fueled fast reactor. The sodium void reactivity is, in general, smaller than in metal fueled homogeneous fast reactors of 1 m core height. The estimates of the required and available control rod worths show a large shutdown margin throughout the operational cycle.

The role of n-BuLi in the deprotolithiation process of 1 was elucidated on the basis of isolated secondary derivatives. After deprotolithiation, the lithiated species could be trapped by different electrophiles such as MeI, TMSCl, MeSSMe, R3SnCl (R = Me or n-Bu), and PPh2Cl. Moreover, 4,4'-bipyridine 2 was submitted to cross-coupling reactions (Suzuki and Sonogashira) which occurred selectively at the carbon-iodine bond. All compounds of this new family of atropisomeric 4,4'-bipyridines were separated by chiral HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography), and the absolute configurations of obtained enantiomers were mainly assigned by XRD (X-ray diffraction) using anomalous dispersion.\n\nIsotopic yield in cold binary fission of even-even 230-244U isotopes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCyriac, Annu; Krishnan, Sreejith; Santhosh, K.P.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe binary fission of even-even 230-244 U isotopes has been studied using the concept of cold reaction valley which was introduced in relation to the structure of minima in the so called driving potential\n\n4.4 V lithium-ion polymer batteries with a chemical stable gel electrolyte\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nYamamoto, Takeru; Hara, Tomitaro; Akashi, Hiroyuki [Sony Corporation, Energy Business Group, R and D Division, 1-1 Aza, Shimosugishita, Takakura, Hiwada-machi, Koriyama-shi, Fukushima 963-0531 (Japan); Segawa, Ken; Honda, Kazuo [Sony Energy Device Corporation, PB Technology Center, 1-1 Aza, Shimosugishita, Takakura, Hiwada-machi, Koriyama-shi, Fukushima 963-0531 (Japan)\n\n2007-12-06\n\nWe tested 4.2 V Li-ion polymer batteries (LIPB) with physical gel electrolyte, poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), 4.4 V LIPB and 4.4 V Li-ion batteries (LIB) with a liquid electrolyte. The discharge capacity of the 4.4 V LIPB reached 520 Wh l{sup -1} which was 9% higher than that of the 4.2 V LIPB. The 4.4 V LIPB had a high capacity retention ratio of 91.4% at 3 C because of the excellent ion conductivity of the PVDF gel. The capacity retention ratio of the 4.4 V LIPB was 82% after 500 cycles, which is comparable to those of some commercial LIBs. The 4.4 V LIPB retained its original thickness even after many cycles and after being stored at 90 C, whereas the 4.4 V LIB swelled by over 20%. Peaks in the FT-IR spectrum of the discolored separator in the 4.4 V LIB after storage were assigned to C=C double bonds, suggesting that the separator in direct contact with the 4.4 V cathode had been oxidized. The PVDF gel electrolyte not only had a high ionic conductivity but also completely suppressed oxidation. The 4.4 V LIPB with PVDF gel electrolyte has properties suitable for practical cells, namely, high energy density, high permanence and it is safe to use.

However, owing to its extremely high lipophilic characteristics, DDT and its metabolite 4,4'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) are ubiquitous in the environment and in many types of food. The positive correlation between exposure to insecticides, including DDT and DDE, and weight gain, resulting in impaired energy metabolism in offspring following perinatal DDT and DDE exposure, was previously reported. Therefore the influence of DDT and DDE on myogenesis using C2C12 myoblasts was investigated in this study. DDT and DDE decreased myotube formation dose- and time-dependently. Among myogenic regulatory factors, DDT and DDE mainly decreased MyoD1 and Myf5 expression. DDT and DDE treatment also altered Myostatin expression, phosphorylation of protein kinase B, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase, forkhead box O protein 3 and mammalian target of rapamycin, resulting in attenuation of myotube formation. These results may have significant implications for understanding the effects of developmental exposure of DDT and DDE on myogenesis and development of obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life.

It is found that the profile of the pulse and the phase-dependence of the cyclotron line can be explained qualitatively by a pulsar model based on recent theoretical results on the properties of pencil beams emitted by accretion-heated slabs of magnetized plasma at the magnetic poles of a neutron star. The indicated field at the surface of the neutron star is 1.7 (1 + z) x 10 to the 12th G, where z is the gravitational redshift.\n\n4U 1907+09: an HMXB running away from the Galactic plane\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGvaramadze, V. V.; RÃ¶ser, S.; Scholz, R.-D.; Schilbach, E.\n\n2011-05-01\n\nWe report the discovery of a bow shock around the high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB) 4U 1907+09 using the Spitzer Space Telescope 24 Î¼m data (after Vela X-1 the second example of bow shocks associated with HMXBs). The detection of the bow shock implies that 4U 1907+09 is moving through space with a high (supersonic) peculiar velocity. To confirm the runaway nature of 4U 1907+09, we measured its proper motion, which for an adopted distance to the system of 4 kpc corresponds to a peculiar transverse velocity of â 160 Â± 115 km s-1, meaning that 4U 1907+09 is indeed a runaway system. This also supports the general belief that most HMXBs possess high space velocities. The direction of motion of 4U 1907+09 inferred from the proper motion measurement is consistent with the orientation of the symmetry axis of the bow shock, and shows that the HMXB is running away from the Galactic plane. We also present the Spitzer images of the bow shock around Vela X-1 (a system similar to 4U 1907+09) and compare it with the bow shock generated by 4U 1907+09.\n\n4U 1909+07: a Hidden Pearl\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nI. Kreykenbohm\n\n2011-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We present a detailed spectral and timing analysis of the High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB 4U 1909+07 with INTEGRAL and RXTE. 4U1909+07 is a persistent accreting X-ray pulsar with a period of approximately 605 s. The period changes erratically consistent with a random walk expected for a wind accreting system. INTEGRAL detects the source with an average of 2.4 cps (corresponding to 15mCrab, but sometimes exhibits flaring activity up to 50 cps (i.e. 300mCrab. The strongly energy dependent pulse profile shows a double peaked structure at low energies and only a single narrow peak at energies above 20 keV. The phase averaged spectrum is well described by a powerlaw modified at higher energies by an exponential cutoff and photoelectric absorption at low energies. In addition at 6.4 keV a strong iron fluorescence line and at lower energies a blackbody component are present. We performed phase resolved spectroscopy to study the pulse phase dependence of the spectral parameters: while most spectral parameters are constant within uncertainties, the blackbody normalization and the cutoff folding energy vary strongly with phase.\n\nSearch for an elusive 4.4-MeV Î± emitter in uranium minerals\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDougan, R.J.; Illige, J.D.; Hulet, E.K.\n\n1979-12-01\n\nA search for an unidentified 4.4-MeV Î±-emitter in Belgian Congo pitchblende and uranium raffinates is described, and a history of observations of 4.4-MeV activity over the last 55 years in radiogenic haloes, zinc ores, monazite, thorite, huttonite, ultrabasic and other abyssal rocks, osmiridium, uranium ores, and raffinates of uranium is given.

The orbital period (3.1sup(h)) is apparent from X-ray to IR frequencies and in linear and circular polarization. Since the time of the identification of the X-ray source the system has been extensively studied. The observations (which range from 1 MeV to 20 Î¼m) are reviewed and compared with the present theory of X-ray emitting white dwarfs.

I.\n\n2018-04-01\n\nA detailed study of the orbital-period variations of the Algol-type eclipsing binaries with earlyspectral- type primary components U CrB and RW Tau has been performed. The period variations in both systems can be described as a superposition of secular and cyclic variations of the period. A secular period increase at a rate of 2.58d Ã 10-7/year is observed for U CrB, which can be explained if there is a uniform flow of matter from the lower-mass to the higher-mass component, with the total angular momentum conserved. RW Tau features a secular period decrease at a rate of -8.6d Ã 10-7/year; this could be due to a loss of angular momentum by the binary due to magnetic braking. The cyclic orbital-period variations of U CrB and RWTau can be explained by the motion of the eclipsing binary systems along their long-period orbits. In U CrB, this implies that the eclipsing binary moves with a period of 91.3 years around a third body with mass M 3 > 1.13 M â; in RW Tau, the period of the motion around the third body is 66.6 years, and the mass of the third body is M 3 > 1.24 M â. It also cannot be ruled out that the variations are due to the magnetic cycles of the late-type secondaries. The residual period variations could be a superposition of variations due to non-stationary ejection of matter and effects due to magnetic cycles.\n\nPhotochemistry of U(BH/sub 4/)/sub 4/ and U(BD/sub 4/)/sub 4/\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nPaine, R T; Schonberg, P R; Light, R W [New Mexico Univ., Albuquerque (USA).

Status as of October 1996: U5Si4: A new phase in the U/Si diagram\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDurand, J.P.; Olagnon, G.; Colomb, P.; Lavastre, Y.; Grasse, M.; Noel, H.; Queneau, V.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nA fundamental study has been carried out by CERCA and the French CNRS (National Scientific Research Center) as a partner in order to get a better understanding of the U 3 Si 2 casting process. On the occasion of this study, a new binary phase, U 5 Si 4 , has been discovered in the USi phase equilibrium diagram. Synthesis conditions of U 5 Si 4 have been determined and the impact of such a discovery is evaluated regarding the production process of U 3 Si 2 ingots. It can be concluded that keeping the CERCA's casting tools and within the allowed limits of production parameters, the U 3 Si 2 ingots are homogenous without any detectable trace of U 5 Si 4 even if a long term heat treatment at the hot rolling temperature is carried out. On the production point of view, perfect knowledge of both metallurgical phase synthesis and the casting process guarantee the quality of U 3 Si 2 ingots and powder produced by CERCA.

Recent History of NGC 1705, NGC 4449, and Holmberg II\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCignoni, M.; Sacchi, E.; Aloisi, A.; Tosi, M.; Calzetti, D.; Lee, J. C.; Sabbi, E.; Adamo, A.; Cook, D. O.; Dale, D. A.; Elmegreen, B. G.; Gallagher, J. S., III; Gouliermis, D. A.; Grasha, K.; Grebel, E. K.; Hunter, D. A.; Johnson, K. E.; Messa, M.; Smith, L. J.; Thilker, D. A.; Ubeda, L.; Whitmore, B. C.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nWe use Hubble Space Telescope observations from the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey to reconstruct the recent star formation histories (SFHs) of three actively star-forming dwarf galaxies, NGC 4449, Holmberg II, and NGC 1705, from their UV colorâmagnitude diagrams (CMDs). We apply a CMD fitting technique using two independent sets of stellar isochrones, PARSEC-COLIBRI and MIST, to assess the uncertainties related to stellar evolution modeling. Irrespective of the adopted stellar models, all three dwarfs are found to have had almost constant star formation rates (SFRs) in the last 100â200 Myr, with modest enhancements (a factor of â¼2) above the 100 Myr averaged SFR. Significant differences among the three dwarfs are found in terms of the overall SFR, the timing of the most recent peak, and the SFR/area. The initial mass function of NGC 1705 and Holmberg II is consistent with a Salpeter slope down to â5 M â, whereas it is slightly flatter, s = â2.0, in NGC 4449. The SFHs derived with the two different sets of stellar models are consistent with each other, except for some quantitative details, attributable to their input assumptions. They also share the drawback that all synthetic diagrams predict a clear separation in color between the upper main-sequence and helium-burning stars, which is not apparent in the data. Since neither differential reddening, which is significant in NGC 4449, nor unresolved binaries appear to be sufficient to fill the gap, we suggest this calls for a revision of both sets of stellar evolutionary tracks.

Growth of crystals of solvated monohydrated uranium (IV) oxalate, U(C 2 O 4 ) 2 .H 2 O.(dma) (3), dma=dimethylamine, was achieved by slow diffusion of U(IV) into a gel containing oxalate ions. The three structures are built on a bi-dimensional complex polymer of U(IV) atoms connected through bis-bidentate oxalate ions forming [U(C 2 O 4 )] 4 pseudo-squares. The flexibility of this supramolecular arrangement allows modifications of the coordination number of the U(IV) atom which, starting from 8 in 1 increases to 9 in 3 and, finally increases, to 10 in 2. The coordination polyhedron changes from a distorted cube, formed by eight oxygen atoms of four oxalate ions, in 1, to a mono-capped square anti-prism in 3 and, finally, to a di-capped square anti-prism in 2, resulting from rotation of the oxalate ions and addition of one and two water oxygen atoms in the coordination of U(IV). In 1, the space between the â 2 [U(C 2 O 4 ) 2 ] planar layers is occupied by non-coordinated water molecules; in 2, the space between the staggered â 2 [U(C 2 O 4 ) 2 .2H 2 O] layers is empty, finally in 3, the solvate molecules occupy the interlayer space between corrugated â 2 [U(C 2 O 4 ) 2 .H 2 O] sheets. The thermal decomposition of U(C 2 O 4 ) 2 .6H 2 O under air and argon atmospheres gives U 3 O 8 and UO 2 , respectively. - Graphical abstract: The adaptable environment of U(IV) in U(IV) oxalates: from eight cubic coordination in U(C 2 O 4 ) 2 .6H 2 O (a) completed by water oxygens to nine in [U(C 2 O 4 ) 2 .H 2 O](C 2 NH 5 ) (b) and ten coordination in U(C 2 O 4 ) 2 .2H 2 O (c)\n\nExpression of C4.4A in an in Vitro Human Tissue-Engineered Skin Model\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nJacobsen, Benedikte; Larouche, Danielle; Rochette-Drouin, Olivier\n\n2017-01-01\n\n, the biological function of C4.4A remains unknown. To enable further studies, we evaluated the expression of C4.4A in monolayer cultures of normal human keratinocytes and in tissue-engineered skin substitutes (TESs) produced by the self-assembly approach, which allow the formation of a fully differentiated...... epidermis tissue. Results showed that, in monolayer, C4.4A was highly expressed in the centre of keratinocyte colonies at cell-cell contacts areas, while some cells located at the periphery presented little C4.4A expression.

Separate binding/translocation (B) components bind to a protein receptor on the cell surface, assemble with enzymatic (A) component(s), and mediate endocytosis of the toxin complex. Ultimately there is translocation of A component(s) from acidified endosomes into the cytosol, leading to destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. Our results revealed that CD44, a multifunctional surface protein of mammalian cells, facilitates intoxication by the iota family of clostridial binary toxins. Specific antibody against CD44 inhibited cytotoxicity of the prototypical Clostridium perfringens iota toxin. Versus CD44(+) melanoma cells, those lacking CD44 bound less toxin and were dose-dependently resistant to C. perfringens iota, as well as Clostridium difficile and Clostridium spiroforme iota-like, toxins. Purified CD44 specifically interacted in vitro with iota and iota-like, but not related Clostridium botulinum C2, toxins. Furthermore, CD44 knockout mice were resistant to iota toxin lethality. Collective data reveal an important role for CD44 during intoxication by a family of clostridial binary toxins.\n\nIMPLICATIONS OF X-RAY LINE VARIATIONS FOR 4U1822-371\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJi, L.; Schulz, N. S.; Nowak, M. A.; Canizares, C. R.\n\n2011-01-01\n\n4U 1822-371 is one of the prototype accretion disk coronal sources with an orbital period of about 5.6 hr. The binary is viewed almost edge-on at a high inclination angle of 83 deg., which makes it a unique candidate to study binary orbital and accretion disk dynamics in high powered X-ray sources. We observed the X-ray source in 4U 1822-371 with the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer for almost nine binary orbits. X-ray eclipse times provide an update of the orbital ephemeris. We find that our result follows the quadratic function implied by previous observations; however, it suggests a flatter trend. From the orbital line dynamics, we confirm the previous suggestion that recombination emission is located at the impact bulge of the accretion stream. Our observations show that the recombining plasma is confined to this region, and prove that it has to be a very thin layer on top of the accretion disk. Fe XXVI emission is detected at all phases and likely originates from the hot central corona which has optical depth <<1. The implied ionization parameters from both regions strongly suggest that the illuminating source is obscured with respect to the observer and is orders of magnitude brighter than what is actually observed. This is independently confirmed by the best fit of a flat power law with a high-energy cutoff and partial covering absorption with a covering fraction of about 50%. We discuss the implications of our findings with respect to the photoionized line emission and the spectral continuum on basic properties of the X-ray source.\n\nCorrelated Radial Velocity and X-Ray Variations in HD 154791/4U 1700+24\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGalloway, Duncan K.; Sokoloski, J. L.; Kenyon, Scott J.\n\n2002-12-01\n\nWe present evidence for approximately 400 day variations in the radial velocity of HD 154791 (V934 Her), the suggested optical counterpart of 4U 1700+24. The variations are correlated with the previously reported ~400 day variations in the X-ray flux of 4U 1700+24, which supports the association of these two objects, as well as the identification of this system as the second known X-ray binary in which a neutron star accretes from the wind of a red giant. The HD 154791 radial velocity variations can be fitted with an eccentric orbit with period 404+/-3 days, amplitude K=0.75+/-0.12kms-1, and eccentricity e=0.26+/-0.15. There are also indications of variations on longer timescales >~2000 days. We have reexamined all available All-Sky Monitor (ASM) data following an unusually large X-ray outburst in 1997-1998 and confirm that the 1 day averaged 2-10 keV X-ray flux from 4U 1700+24 is modulated with a period of 400+/-20 days. The mean profile of the persistent X-ray variations was approximately sinusoidal, with an amplitude of 0.108+/-0.012 ASM counts s-1 (corresponding to 31% rms). The epoch of X-ray maximum was approximately 40 days after the time of periastron, according to the eccentric orbital fit. If the 400 day oscillations from HD 154791/4U 1700+24 are due to orbital motion, then the system parameters are probably close to those of the only other neutron star symbiotic-like binary, GX 1+4. We discuss the similarities and differences between these two systems.\n\nSolid-Liquid Equilibria for the Binary Mixtures 1,4-Xylene + Ethylbenzene and 1,4-Xylene + Toluene\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHuyghe, RaphaÃ«l; Rasmussen, Peter; Thomsen, Kaj\n\n2004-01-01\n\nSolid-liquid equilibrium (SLE) data for the binary mixtures 1,4-xylene + ethylbenzene, and 1,4-xylene + toluene have been measu"
