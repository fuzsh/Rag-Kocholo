        "text": "The first semifinal may have three of the dreckiest entries in this year’s contest, but it also has 14 very strong, highly regarded entries battling for the ten finalist spots. There’ll be wailing and gnashing of teeth for the four unfortunate ones who would miss the cut, as if they theoretically switch places with the second group, they might advance. There is also this possibility that one or two regular final shoo-ins may have their finals streak broken and one country that has thus far failed to advance would finally earn its breakthrough. Let’s take a look at them starting with…\n\nFINLAND: “Sing It Away” – Sandhja. This lady’s haircut reminds me of Robyn, but musically she is very different from Robyn’s style as she peddles in dated 1990s dance pop with this entry*1. I know of a significant group of people who adore this throwback to Stardust’s 1998 pan-European smash “Music Sounds Better with You”, but I fear buzz is fading for this entry and indications point that it’s the first of the 14 quality entries to fall by the wayside and miss the cut.\n\n*1 Sure Robyn began her career in the 1990s, but hits like “Do You Know What It Takes” and most especially “Show Me Love” have a timeless quality to them and will never sound dated.\n\nGREECE: “Utopian Land” – Argo. This group is normally known as Europond, but due to EBU’s regulations, they had to change their name. Also, to make way for a dancer, this seven-member group would have to have two of its members sit out of the performance. This perennial finalist had previously gotten away with advancing to the finals with drecky entries as they either had lager-lout appeal (2010’s “Opa” and 2013’s “Alcohol Is Free“) butressed by flashy presentation, or the main singer is a good-looking hunk (2011’s Loukas Giorkas’s “Watch My Dance”) or the singer sings like Celine Dion (2015’s “One Last Breath“). This song is weak and drecky with none of the aforementioned “redeeming” factors, even if they are jazzing up the presentation with a visually appealing Pontic ethno-pop presentation–the English lyrics on the chorus are awkward and banal (“With the rise of the rising sun,” oh please!) and the melody of the chorus sounds like a trainwreck mash-up of Stevie Wonder’s “Pastime Paradise” (made more popular as it was interpolated into Coolio’s 1995 mega-smash “Gangsta’s Paradise“) and the ending portion of the chorus of Georgia’s 2008 entry, Diana Gurtskaya’s “Peace Will Come”. Sure the video featured a running swarthy hunk, and the message seems relevant in light of the current refugee crisis, but the video also forgot to show the singers of the song, so the viewer doesn’t feel a connection with the group–they recently released a new edit with the bandmembers’ faces, but I think it’s too late. If justice is to prevail, Greece will suffer its first finals shut-out since the semifinal system was implemented. Otherwise, many fans upset with the shut-out of perceived worthier entries in this group would hurl invectives towards this entry.\n\nMOLDOVA: “Falling Stars” – Lidia Isac. It’s a pleasant dance-pop entry, but it pales compared to the 14 heavier hitters in this semifinal as it comes off as rather generic. Having an astronaut gimmick to spice things up would not help matters.\n\nHUNGARY: “Pioneer” – Freddie. Imagine someone blessed with the looks that is a cross between ex-One Direction member Zayn Malik*2 and actor Colin Farrell, then possessing a singing voice that is a cross between the late Joe Cocker and American Idol Season 7 champion David Cook, and you get this guy. Then give him a song that channels Imagine Dragons’ 2012 megahit “Radioactive”, and you get this contender. In my opinion it is Hungary’s best entry since Andras Kallay-Saunders’s “Running“*3 two years ago, but prospects fo this entry equaling or exceeding that successful 5th place finish seems to be dimming a bit. A casual listener might quibble based on the “A million hearts for a million people” line in the chorus that it seems a groan-worthy world-peace-type follow-up to last year’s entry from Boggie, “Wars for Nothing”, but if you read the lyrics, the song is actually addressed to an individual and it is more of an empowerment anthem as it is a pep talk to someone to be true to him- or herself, and “become a pioneer”. It’s a message that should resonate with everyone (and the LGBT community is free to appropriate it as well). My quibble is that besides the aforementioned “A million hearts for a million people” and “A million lies in a million temples”, the catchy chorus sounds rather muddled and incomprehensible–Freddie’s enunciation is not that clear, which diminishes the impact of the beautiful message it is actually conveying. Otherwise, from the thumping beats to the relatable melody to Freddie’s distinctive vocal and off-the-charts sex appeal, it’s a front-running contender in my book, and I would be especially upset if this would become a shock boot.\n\n*2 I know most One Direction fangirls would gravitate towards Harry Styles as he was the one getting the most press, but I never found him appealing at all and am baffled by all the hype about him. For me the best looking member of that boyband was Zayn.\n\n*3 Interestingly, Andras Kallay-Saunders competed in the Hungarian national final A Dal this year under a band entity, the Kallay-Saunders Band, with a new Lenny Kravitz-inspired sound. Unfortunately, they ranked 3rd behind Freddie and their song was not that compelling–and it was marred with glitches that they had to redo their performance during the finals.\n\nCROATIA: “Lighthouse” – Nina Kraljić. She channels Robyn with her bleached blonde hairdo too, and her vocal range seems similar to Robyn, though Nina has this beautiful lilt in her voice that makes this equally lilting song such a lovely listen. But the avant-garde fashions for the stage presentation in the contest? Unfortunately it seems to be a misfire and she could be a primary candidate for the dreaded Barbara Dex award–it might be a showdown between her and Germany’s Jamie-Lee Kriewitz for that dubious honor, and let’s see if the dress would affect this entry’s prospects.\n\nNETHERLANDS: “Slow Down” – Douwe Bob. This is channeling the most successful entry fielded by this country in over a decade, the Common Linnets’ “Calm After the Storm”. It’s a well-crafted and well-performed entry with a highly appealing singer*4 and is well regarded among the fans and pundits, but it’s a brutal battle to garner a slot. If it does, wonder it will be under whose expense? Anyway, I find this a nice song, but the reason I’m not totally behind this number is that the chorus reminds me so much of Jimmy Fallon’s “Tight Pants” skits at the Tonight Show–check one of those below with Jennifer Lopez.\n\n*4 He exudes a James-Dean-meets-country-folk appeal. He may seem clean-cut in a fully-covered suit, but he has some rather rad tattoos all over his body–watch if you see his shirt slightly open to see what I mean.\n\nARMENIA: “Love Wave” – Iveta Mukuchyan. To my eyes, it’s a tossup between this lady and Malta’s Ira Losco in Wiwibloggs’ competition for Eurovision’s Next Top Model. Based on the music video, I was expecting a stage presentation similar to Latvia’s Aminata’s “Love Injected” last year, perhaps with swirling technicolor. Instead, we got her in a leotard serving Beyonce-style fierceness with multiple holographic images of her and fireworks in the end. It’s garnered raves and major buzz in rehearsals that she seems to be a contender to make the Top Ten in the finals. Another thing that I dig is when I listen to the gritty register she uses in the chorus, it reminds me of the gritty voice Michael Jackson uses in many of his songs from Bad onwards (I tried to look for a compilation, but I have to settle with his 1988 smash “The Way You Make Me Feel” instead)\n\nSAN MARINO: “I Didn’t Know” – Serhat. Imagine one-hit-wonder “Mambo No. 5” singer Lou Bega 30 years older with his voice ravaged but with an inflated ego and you get this guy. His monotone baritone is obviously an acquired taste and most Eurovision fans pooh-poohed him when he compared himself to Leonard Cohen. But then again he actually does have a musical career that has been ongoing for 20 years, so you can’t accuse him of being delusional about his claims and checking his previous output he is indeed following in the traditions of Leonard Cohen, Serge Gainsbourg, and latter-day Marianne Faithfull. The song was originally released in a ballad format that was negatively received by Eurovision fans. However when he later released a disco remix, the fans buzzed that it improved on the song and and Serhat listened to the buzz and obtained EBU approval to change his performance to use the disco remix instead. Buzz on his jazzed up presentation from rehearsals was pretty positive, so he may just avoid the cellar. It may get some points from France, at least.\n\nI have to make a note for the fact he’s actually from Turkey–as long as Valentina Monetta and songwriter/producer Ralph Siegel are on hiatus, perhaps it could be an opportunity for other Turkish artists to enter Eurovision by this route as long as the Turkish broadcaster maintains its protest stance against participating in this contest. Can you imagine those splashy ethno-pop entries coming from San Marino?\n\nRUSSIA: “You Are the Only One” – Sergey Lazarev. Ever since I have been following this contest in 2005, I have never liked a song from Russia until now. Okay, songs from Dima Bilan, Dina Garipova, and Polina Gagarina I respect and I would predict they would make Top Five but I would never regard them as my favorites. But Sergey’s entry is different–sure it has a schlager feel with the traditional Eurovision martial beats, but it also has a sleek, modern pop sheen, terrific singing and catchy hooks. Heck, even his Russian accent on lines like “thunder and lightning is very exciting” won me over and are embedded like earworms in my head. As the days go by I can’t help sing along to the refrain of this song and enjoying it. His hunky appeal is a delicious cherry on this very delectable sundae. Then, there is the fact that the presentation from rehearsals look impressive, and vocally he’s always on-point. And i’m glad he’s very gay-friendly, unlike the stance being held by his country’s president. Its status as the favorite to win it all and be Russia’s second Eurovision win is well deserved.\n\nPiquant note: listening to the soaring high notes he hits at the song’s climax makes me recall another passionate singer: Salsa King Marc Anthony. I can easily imagine Sergey covering Marc Anthony’s 1999 English-language crossover hit “I Need to Know”, and he can easily slay it, Russian accent and all. Just picture Sergey’s voice when you play the video below…\n\nCOMING UP: THE SECOND HALF OF THE FIRST SEMIFINAL\n\nWhen Sweden won Eurovision last year, fans rejoiced and expectations are rife for a spectacular production for this year’s contest. So far indications are pointing toward that direction, especially as many entries are planning to exploit the state-of-the-art LED technology set up on the stage of the Globen Arena in Stockholm. It promises to be a visual smorgasbord. On top of that, having Petra Mede hosting again promises to be loads of fun. Having last year’s champion Måns Zelmerlöw to co-host is an added bonus treat since Måns has extensive TV presenting experience besides being a recording artist.\n\nBut the more exciting part of the contest is the major new rule change implemented by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) starting with this year’s contest: instead of calculating jury votes and televotes into a single score, both would be tallied separately and the results from each would generate its own set of points. So from each country, instead of the usual douze (12) points (say it the French way, pwah[n]), each entry would actually be aspiring to get vingt-quatre (24) points. This doubles the amount of points to compete for–the perfect score (for the winning entry) based on 42 participating countries is 984 (before it would’ve been 492). Many observed this system is very similar to the system employed in Sweden’s legendary annual national finals, Melodifestivalen, but I totally welcome and embrace this development.\n\nSpeaking of participants, this year would’ve tied the record set in 2008 and 2011, but unfortunately three weeks before the final, one entry was disqualified due to issues with the broadcaster. I’ll discuss more on this when I go to the second half of the second semifinal. With the loss of one, we have to settle with the next best participation record set in three prior editions: 2007, 2009, and 2012. Anyway, it’s nice to see Bosnia & Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia and Ukraine back in the fold, and be a bit sad that Portugal decided to skip the proceedings this year.\n\nBesides the reliance on LED effects on the presentations for several entries, which seemed to follow after Måns Zelmerlöw’s winning presentation last year, another Måns-inspired trend is the bevy of hunky male eye-candy among this year’s entries. Fangirls and gay fanboys are swooning at the plethora and variety of these treats, from the he-man appeal of Hungary’s Freddie and Russia’s Sergey Lazarev, to the dreamy boy appeal of the Baltic Boys (Estonia’s Juri Pootsmann, Latvia’s Justs, and Lithuania’s Donny Montell), to the wholesome boyband appeal of Denmark’s Lighthouse X and United Kingdom’s Joe & Jake, to the James Dean-meets-country-folk appeal of the Netherlands’ Douwe Bob, to the original flavor from Ireland’s Nicky Byrne (from the mega-popular Westlife),to the rocker edge of Cyprus’s lead singer from Minus One, Francois Micheletto, to the boyband-meets-rocker appeal of Montenegro’s Highway, to the sweet puppy-dog charm of France’s Amir, and so much more.\n\nOn the female side, two very disparate non-Eurovision Nordic music icons seem to be very prominent in terms of influence: Sweden’s Robyn and Iceland’s Björk. Their presences are felt either in the looks and/or personas, or (especially in the case of Björk) in terms of vocal delivery. I’ll discuss more on the acts that exhibit these traits when I discuss those entries in-depth.\n\nThere are also a couple of entries from Eastern Europe that deal with very serious yet timely topics. They are most likely going to deliver the most emotional moments in this year’s contest. Who are they, I’ll also discuss when I get to those entries.\n\nThe Big Five stepped up their game this year in terms of the quality of their entries, as Eurovision fans are salivating that three of them could be potential winners–something that has rarely been said in recent years. Will their quality be rewarded this year?\n\nIt promises to be an exciting and delightful Eurovision contest ahead. Read on as I review this year’s entries and assess their chances of advancing and winning…\n\nCOMING UP: THE FIRST HALF of the FIRST SEMIFINAL\n\nTwo Thursdays ago, the world was rocked again by the loss of another musical legend–Prince was found dead and unconscious in the elevator of the Paisley Park complex, his home and workplace for almost three decades. When I learned of the news while I was working from home, I was a bit heartbroken as this artist was an integral part of my memories growing up.\n\nI first learned of Prince during my second year of high school, as I started following the US Billboard charts and religiously followed the Top 10 songs as published on the tabloid Tempo in those days. When I saw the song “When Doves Cry” and the name “Prince”, I was perplexed as I had no clue about him then. A couple of weeks later, the music video clip shows on TV got to air the video for “When Doves Cry”, and I was first repulsed by his features then (as, well, I was still conditioned by my mother’s notions of beauty, which are of the milquetoast 1950s kind), but his music was very different and intriguing. As “Let’s Go Crazy” and “Purple Rain” started rising up the charts, I decided to purchase the Purple Rain cassette. I was hooked, but I also blushed when I got to the track “Darling Nikki“–clearly I should never play this tape when my mom was around…\n\nAs the rest of my high school years wore on, there was of course more Prince output. I got the follow-up to Purple Rain, the psychedelic Around the World in a Day, especially because I so adored his launching single, “Raspberry Beret”–it’s one of the songs I think I could confidently sing if I go out on a videoke with friends and colleagues (two other songs I can sing decently: Green Day’s “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” and Oasis’ “Wonderwall”). There wasn’t an upfront raunchy track like “Darling Nikki” (though “Tambourine” came close) and here I learned about the dichotomy Prince has been exploring about the spiritual and the carnal (like the closing tracks to that album, “The Ladder” and “Temptation“).\n\nThe video clip shows at the time got to show two Prince hits prior to his Purple Rain breakthrough, like “1999” and “Little Red Corvette“, and I got to learn more about him while reading issues of Jingle chordbook magazine. Then he intrigued me further when he came out with the spare funky number “Kiss”. The falsetto and the sparse arrangement was nothing like I heard anywhere, and I found it odd at first, but I became hooked at the oddness and the quirkiness. Even to this day, that record remains utterly unique and fresh.\n\nHigh school graduation featured Prince in a somber and socially conscious mood with “Sign O’ The Times” from his soon-to-be classic album of the same name. In some ways the turmoil reflected of my times, as my school was hit with a teachers’ strike just weeks prior to our graduation (though all got settled very shortly and we got to graduate without any incident on schedule). As I begin my college days in Ateneo, I met a classmate who had a major passion for Prince. Me, being a Billboard chart enthusiast, I shared how well Prince’s next Top 10 single out of “Sign ‘O’ The Times”, the Sheena Easton duet “U Got the Look” was faring, and a friendship was born. We talked a lot about music and he shared me tapes of other musical acts, like for instance, two of Peter Gabriel’s eponymously titled solo albums (one with the classic “Solsbury Hill”, the other with “Games Without Frontiers” and “Biko”). We teamed together on group projects (sometimes being a two-man group), and I hung around his dorm room from time to time, which was helpful when storms came and I couldn’t be picked up by my father in school immediately.*1\n\n*1 During those days, it was still viable to commute or drive from my home in Sta. Cruz, Manila to Ateneo de Manila–it was normally an average 45-minute drive in those days; these days the same trip would take about two to three hours each way, though an LRT-2 ride from Recto to Katipunan would help keep that trip within the timeframe of those halcyon days.\n\nAdmittedly I did develop a crush on the guy, but as it was then and would ring true now, as far as I know I never acted inappropriately towards him, and I wouldn’t give in to my impulses as I’m aware I won’t have his consent, and I value his friendship and company and wouldn’t want to ruin any relationship. Still, during the summer interim before 3rd year in college (the course I took had summer classes so it can be a 4-year program instead of a 5-year one), he started becoming distant and giving me a brusque cold shoulder. He never said why in front of my face, but I wished we had a conversation about it–but in hindsight, I think neither of us would have the maturity then to sort things out and be open and frank about if I was crossing any boundaries, as I’m often unaware of them. I was devastated and heartbroken when I realized what was going on. About a year later, Sinead O’Connor released her famous cover of the song Prince wrote for one of his protege bands, The Family, “Nothing Compares 2 U”. Though this guy was NOT the love of my life, the emotions and sentiments conveyed in this song just fit my mood, and it was for years my all-time favorite song.\n\nSince Sign ‘O’ The Times, Prince never made an album that was universally acclaimed, and though each would feature brilliant moments, it was often inconsistent. I haven’t followed his career that intensely since he released 1992’s unpronounceable-titled album (often referred to as the “Love Symbol”) but he still generates headlines from time to time especially with his lengthy battle with his then-record label, Warner Brothers. It was perplexing at the time, for instance, when Prince changed his name to the aforementioned symbol in 1993. But when he reverted back to his original name seven years later, the rationale and creativity of his move was made clear–under the name “Prince” he was under contract with Warner Brothers, and was bound under this contract until the year 2000. But since Prince was dissatisfied with his deal with the record company, and knowing how Prince cannot be shackled musically, he used the name change to be able to record music under his own independently established label (NPG Records) while his old label can still release his older music (since he has so much of it) under his then-former name.\n\nThe key highlight for most people under his “symbol” years would most probably be “The Most Beautiful Girl in the World”. It’s a sweet, lovely pop ballad that I would forever associate with the hosting of the 1994 Miss Universe pageant in our shores. In fact, after Sushmita Sen’s win, some TV specials about the pageant would play this song in intermission.\n\nSince he reclaimed his name, he has not made an impact on radio. And with his very protective stance about copyright, listening to his newer material is hard to come by. Despite a bit of an album renaissance with Musicology (thanks to his innovative tactic of bundling his album with still-much-in-demand concert tickets–which led Billboard magazine to set a rule change that albums-bundled-with-concert-tickets would only count if there is an opt-out option not to buy the album with the ticket) and 3121 but the singles from them are not as impactful and minor hits at best. He would sometimes upload videos of new singles on YouTube, but he would then pull them out after a limited period. I suppose Tidal is the only acceptable streaming alternative for him since it’s the one that is most “artist-friendly” (especially since it’s co-owned by rapper Jay-Z) with royalty payments that he deemed acceptable. Still, most of the public would tend to prefer the streaming services with free access options like Spotify, YouTube, and Apple Music, and I’m not really in the position to exactly is a “fair” compensation for artists from streaming services, though there are a lot of people who figured out how to thrive and make a living out of free streaming, right? But I do respect Prince’s stance in protecting his copyright, even to my detriment in enjoying his music. Despite not figuring in the hit parades, Prince still generates profile buzz from various post-awards-show-party gigs, concerts, TV specials, and awards show appearances. But one big post 2000s highlight was his appearance in the 2007 Super Bowl, where he played a set of his greatest hits along with some choice covers like the Foo Fighters’ “Best of You”, Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Proud Mary” and Jimi Hendrix’s “All Along the Watchtower”. See that epic performance below:\n\nHis music of course permeates still and he remains influential. You can hear his sound in the likes of D’Angelo, Justin Timberlake, Nick Jonas, and so many others. But one unlikely hit song that I saw a Prince influnce was one of One Direction’s latest songs, “Drag Me Down”. Many might see homages to the Police and Men at Work, but when I listen to the chorus, I always hear the chorus to Prince’s 1990 hit from his flop movie Graffiti Bridge, “Thieves in the Temple”. Check out the choruses of both songs to compare.\n\nAbout seven years ago, we lost a legend with Michael Jackson, and now we lost Prince. I’m wondering about another legend who had her biggest successes in the 1980s and is also born in 1958 in middle America*2 like those two–Madonna. It makes me wonder if seven years from now, when Madonna’s 64 to 65, if she’ll join them in the afterlife. I’ll probably keep an eye out seven years from now if Madonna fits in the cycle, as these three legends seemed too uncannily intertwined from what I’m seeing… Reminds me of a meme that I saw featuring Whoopi Goldberg’s Oda Mae character from the 1990 movie Ghost and her famous warning to Demi Moore’s character, (though it was also addressed to other artists popular in that era like George Michael, Elton John, Cher, Tina Turner, Sheena Easton, and Cyndi Lauper).\n\n*2 Prince was born on 07 June 1958 in Minneapolis, MN; Madonna on 16 August 1958 in Bay City, MI; and Michael Jackson on 29 August 1958 in Gary, IN. MN (Minnesota), MI (Michigan), and IN (Indiana) are considered part of the Midwestern United States.\n\nDespite the circumstances surrounding his death becoming evident as bieng related to an addiction to prescription painkillers (just like Michael Jackson), it’s clear that Prince is an undeniable good influence in this world. I may disagree with some of his views and his temperament, but he has laid an undeniable imprint in my psyche. With the “afterlife” and “elevator” imagery of “Let’s Go Crazy”, and the beauty of the latter-day prescient ballad, “Sometimes It Snows in April” (check D’Angelo and Maya Rudolph’s Prince cover act Princess at the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon) I’ll never be able to listen to those songs the same way again. Rest in Peace, sweet Prince.\n\nJUST ME!\n\nJOSEPH\n\nP.S. I’ll do another part where I’ll count down my favorite Prince songs, then complete my long-in-the-works sections on my tribute to David Bowie, along with other major legends we had lost this year thus far. But I’ll have to hold them back until the end of Eurovision season, as it’s currently underway…"
