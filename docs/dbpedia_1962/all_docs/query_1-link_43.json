        "text": "The Eurovision 2021 season is hotting up. Over the course of the next few months, we will all fall in and out of love with scores of new national final and Eurovision entries. But that doesn’t mean we forget about the artists from past contests.\n\nContrary to the commonly perpetuated myth about the song contest killing careers, we’re always thrilled to report that singers and performers associated with both Eurovision itself and the various national selections are thriving.\n\nHere is a selection of just some of the songs and music videos released in the last week or so.\n\nNew music from Eurovision artists: 2021 | Week 4\n\nHelena Paparizou – Αpohrosis\n\nThe release of an artist’s tenth studio album is a significant moment, and it’s one that Helena Paparizou has reached this week. The Greek superstar dropped Αpohrosis (Shades) on Friday. It contains thirteen tracks, including previous singles “Kati Skoteino”, “Etsi Ine I Fasi”, “Mila Mou”, “Se Xeno Soma” and “Deja Vu”. There’s a nice mixture of songs on the LP, including powerful ballads and more up-tempo tracks – the Eurovision 2005 champion even hops on board the retro 80s trend for the title track. Ten albums in and Helena still consistently finds herself at the top of the Greek and Cypriot charts, so we have a feeling she won’t be stopping yet.\n\nRuth Lorenzo – “Crisálida”\n\n“You have to touch the bottom in order to breathe again”, sings Ruth Lorenzo in her new single “Crisálida” (“Chrysalis”). It’s a story of rebirth and rising like a phoenix even when you’ve fallen down: “Death to my ego / I am born again / From the ashes bloom”. Sonically, Spain’s Eurovision 2014 star serves up a dramatic ballad. Ruth has the opportunity showcase her power vocals, but there’s also an element of grit in the production that gives the song some nice dynamism.\n\nRoxen and DJ Project – “Parte Din Tine”\n\nAhead of Eurovision 2021, Roxen has teamed up with DJ Project for the new single “Parte Din Tine” (“Part Of You”). The Romanian singer lends her vocals to the contemporary song that mixes pop-style verses with a more EDM-focused chorus. Roxen sings about the connection she has with her loved one: “I didn’t say how I felt so many times / How can you mean everything to me? / You, paint your shadow on my skin / And then make me part of you”.\n\nKállay Saunders – “Your Love”\n\nKállay Saunders continues his regular new music releases with “Your Love”. This latest track is a slow R&B offering. While the first half sees the Hungarian star predominantly accompanied by acoustic guitar, the second half adds in more string instrumentation that adds to the atmosphere of the song. In the lyrics, the Eurovision 2014 alum reminisces about the love he used to share with a certain individual: “Cause all I just wanted was your love / Them birds in the sky sing our old songs / You never really know what you got till its all gone / Cause all I just wanted was your love”.\n\nSamira Said – “Baheb Maak”\n\nMorocco’s first and so far only Eurovision contestant continues her well established career with the new song “Baheb Maak” (“I love you”). Samira Said delivers a steady Arabic ballad all about the love the Eurovision 1980 alum has for her partner: “I love you / You feel my worth a lot / And that there is a great love between us”. This new song is the first track from Samira’s upcoming new album, set to be released sometime soon.\n\nUlrikke and Morgan Sulele – “Hver gang jeg ser deg”\n\nUlrikke would have served an emotional ballad at Eurovision 2020, but for her latest single she’s keeping things more light and bouncy. The Norwegian star has collaborated with Morgan Sulele on “Hver gang jeg ser deg” (“Every time I see you”). Ulrikke predominantly lends her vocals to the chorus of the song, where she sings about the warm and fuzzy feeling she still gets when she sees her former lover: “I go from a hundred to zero / Every time I see you / Feeling really good / But then I remember / We were then, when it was you and me”.\n\nSamra – “Biri Yox, Biri Var”\n\nSamra started off the new year with a new look and new song. “Biri Yox, Biri Var” is a mid-tempo R&B-pop track that progresses steadily and aims to get the listener vibing for its duration. In the accompanying music video Samra showcases her new braided hairstyle. The Eurovision 2016 star uses various slow motion and reversed shots to highlight their motion as she poses.\n\nRambo Amadeus (feat. Charlie Cinelli) – “Corona Party\n\nRambo Amadeus has always been a man of the times. At Eurovision 2012, he sang about Europe’s financial woes and bureaucracy. Now, the Montenegrin singer has tackled the current topic on everyone’s mind – the coronavirus pandemic. Collaborating with Italian singer Charlie Cinelli, Amadeus adds his eccentric style to the topic and discusses the ignorance of those who feel the need to continue partying at this time: “Corona party, all ahead / Girls, boys, all ignorant / Stop the party, stop the party … Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine / You must help us as soon as possible”. In the audio video’s description, the Eurovision alum details more about his inspiration for the song:\n\n“The song originated in a time of isolation, as a preventive measure to combat a pandemic. The contradictions of information and administrative measures as well as the already quite traditional irrational behaviour of a good deed of citizens were the inspiration for this song.”\n\nEvelina Sašenko – “Įkvėpk Drąsos”\n\nIt’s been ten years since Evelina Sašenko stepped onto the Eurovision stage in 2011. Not ready to give up on music just yet, the Lithuanian star recently released the new single “Įkvėpk Drąsos” (“Breathe courage”). While it starts off as a piano-driven ballad, the chorus quickly adds in a touch of rock thanks to some guitars and drums. Lyrically, Evelina prays that the people of Earth will have the courage to persevere: “We desire to be pure in heart / Preserving being is the art of being yourself / On earth, hear this prayer / On earth, help spread it / On earth, please breathe courage”.\n\nMolly Hammar – “DOUCHEBAG”\n\nThose that only remember Molly Hammar from her soul-pop entries to Melodifestivalen may be surprised to hear her more recent R&B discography. But that’s exactly what the Swedish star serves in her new single “DOUCHEBAG”. The title is relatively self-explanatory, with Molly taking aim at her former partner: “Baby I got 2020 vision / Now I’m seeing clearly what ur missing / Got a nice face, no ambition / What a douche, what a douche, what a douche”. The accompanying music video naturally sees this character acting poorly towards a couple of women, and you might just recognise whose playing said “douche”.\n\nEmmy Liyana – “Tristesse”\n\nIn 2018, Emmy Liyana broke onto the scene with her Destination Eurovision entry “OK ou KO”, which went on to be voted Team Wiwi’s favourite national final song of the year. The French singer has remained quiet since then, but we’re thankful to report that she’s finally back with her sophomore single. “Tristesse” is a contemporary pop song, but with a title that translates to “Sadness” there’s also an emotional touch to Emmy’s delivery, as she sings: “One day you will go away / Yes but you will come back / Ah, sadness my / Only mistress at the bottom”.\n\nPaul Rey – Note To Her\n\nPaul Rey is hoping to improve on his sixth place finish at Melfest 2020 when he returns to the competition this year. Ahead of that, the Swedish singer has released a new EP. Titled Note To Her, there are five songs including Paul’s Melodifestivalen 2020 entry “Talking In My Sleep”. The other tracks follow in a similar fashion – a series of slow to mid-tempo indie-pop songs.\n\nClick on the links below to read our individual articles on other new songs released by Eurovision stars in the last week:\n\nVasil – “SudBina”\n\nWhich of these new songs is your favourite?
