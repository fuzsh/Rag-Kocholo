        "text": "On 15 June, the famous Greek pop singer Demis Roussos celebrated his 65th birthday. Roussos, who was born in Egypt and now lives in Paris, absorbed the traditions, culture, and music from many countries and peoples, which, coupled with his unique voice, secured him enthusiastic and loyal fans all over the world {and I’m one of ‘em… who woulda thunk it: editor}.\n\n******\n\nQuand je t’aime (When I Love You)\n\n******\n\nAmis Pour La Vie (Friends For Life)\n\n******\n\nBorn in Alexandria, Egypt into a Greek expat family, music surrounded him since his earliest childhood. The mother of the future musician was a singer, whilst his father was a classical guitarist.\n\n******\n\nGoodbye, My Love, Goodbye\n\n******\n\nDemis sings an Italian opera aria, Una Furtiva Lagrima\n\n******\n\nDemis Roussos (whose full name is Artemios Venturis Rousos) attended music school, where he learned to play guitar, trumpet, and contrabass.\n\n******\n\nDemis sings From Souvenirs to Souvenirs with Diana Gurtskaya in a Moscow performance\n\n******\n\nOn Écrit sur les Murs (it’s Written on the Walls)\n\n******\n\nAfter the Suez crisis wiped out his family’s holdings in Egypt, Demis and his family returned to Greece, and, in 1968, he joined the progressive rock band Aphrodite’s Child, which also included the now-famous composer Vangelis and Sideras Lucas. In the photo: Demis Roussos (1946- ) with Charles Aznavour (1924- ), in the late 1960s (right).\n\n******\n\nThe Four Horsemen from the Aphrodite’s Child album 666… it’s late ’60s acid-tinged to the core…\n\n******\n\nDemis sings Triki, Triki in Spanish\n\n******\n\nIn 1968, after the rightwing “colonel’s junta” seized power in Greece, Roussos moved to Paris, and, in 1971, he left Aphrodite’s Child, and he began a solo career.\n\n******\n\nVangelis and Demis collaborated on Tales of the Future for the Blade Runner soundtrack… it’s kinda spooky and futuristic, if you catch my drift, not typical Demis stuff at all…\n\n******\n\nDemis and Sergei Penkin sing in Russian…\n\n******\n\nSuccess came to Demis with the album Forever and Ever. A single from this album, Happy to Be on an Island in the Sun, rose to fifth place in the British charts and the song When Forever Has Gone achieved second place.\n\n******\n\nWhen Forever Has Gone\n\n******\n\nDemis sings an old French Christmas hymn from Languedoc, Les Anges Dans Nos Campagnes (Angels We Have Heard on High; literally, The Angels On Our Fields)\n\n******\n\nRoussos adroitly exploited the decline in the popularity of recordings as compared to live performances, where he skilfully uses his unusual tenor. He allows himself creative freedom in designing his shows, and Demis warms up the audience personally before beginning to sing.\n\n******\n\nNana Mouskouri and Demis team up to sing an old Greek song, To Gelakaki\n\n******\n\nWe Shall Dance\n\n******\n\nTo date, Roussos has released more than 25 albums, he keeps up an extensive concert schedule, and he’s happy to come to Russia, where he has frequent performances.\n\n******\n\nEditor:\n\nDemis Roussos is one of the most popular and well-loved singers on the continent (including Russia)… sadly, navel-gazing Americans haven’t heard much of him. He’s a big-time, serious, and committed Greek Orthodox Christian… he gives concerts in Greek Orthodox parishes throughout the world. He’s one of my fave singers in French… as if you haven’t noticed by now. Only Daniel Lavoie and Garou beat him out for concert présence (and it’s a tight finish, kids… they’re all damned close to one another)… a girl can dream, can’t she?\n\nBMD\n\nVoice of Russia World Service"
