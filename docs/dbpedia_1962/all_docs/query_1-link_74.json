Langtree - Content Writer/Editor for Disabled World\n\nPublished: 2017/11/10 - Updated: 2023/05/14\n\nContents: Summary - Introduction - Main - Related\n\nSynopsis: A list of famous and well known sight impaired people who are or were blind or blind in one eye. Blindness is the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological or neurological factors. Total blindness is the complete lack of form and light perception. Access technology such as screen reading software enable the blind to use mainstream computer applications including the Internet.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlindness is the condition of lacking visual perception due to physiological or neurological factors. Total blindness is the complete lack of form and light perception and is clinically recorded as \"NLP,\" an abbreviation for \"no light perception. In order to determine which people may need special assistance because of their visual disabilities, various governmental jurisdictions have formulated more complex definitions referred to as legal blindness.\n\nMain Digest\n\nEye injuries, most often occurring in people under 30, are the leading cause of monocular blindness (vision loss in one eye). Visually impaired and blind people have devised a number of techniques that allow them to complete daily activities using their remaining senses. Recent access technology such as screen reading software enable the blind to use mainstream computer applications including the Internet.\n\nPerhaps the most well known blind person was Helen Adams Keller (fig. 1), (June 27, 1880 - June 1, 1968), an American author, political activist, and lecturer. Helen Keller was the first deaf-blind person to earn a bachelor of arts degree. A prolific author, Keller was well-traveled and outspoken in her convictions.\n\nA member of the Socialist Party of America and the Industrial Workers of the World, she campaigned for women's suffrage, labor rights, socialism, antimilitarism, and other similar causes. Helen Keller went on to become a world-famous speaker and author.\n\nShe was an advocate for people with disabilities, and numerous other causes. The Deaf community was widely impacted by her. She traveled to twenty-five different countries giving motivational speeches about Deaf people's conditions. She was a suffragette, pacifist, radical socialist, and birth control supporter.\n\nListed below are other well known people who had or have a vision impairment including total blindness, sight conditions, and blindness in one eye.\n\nFamous Blind and Sight Impaired People\n\nNOTE: If you notice any inaccuracies in this list, please reach out to us so we can correct it.
