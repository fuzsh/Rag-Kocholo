When the girl was a freshman at the Pskov Free Institute, her mother recognized that the local television was looking for a set of girls for one of the channels from the running line on the TV screen. She insisted on having her daughter to take part in the casting, as a result Elena passed. The girl first received the work of a correspondent, and then became a host on the Pskovsk GTRK (State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company). For a short while, Elena switched to \"Telecom Channel 7\", but soon returned to her former place of work.\n\nIn 2000, Elena goes to Moscow and after a while gets into the studio of the popular NTV Channel.

Quite quickly, Andrew and Elena got married, and soon the first-born daughter, Catherine appeared in their family.
