Moreover, in 2019 she took part in the Blue Light, which was broadcast on one of the major Russian TV channels.\n\nChildhood and youth\n\nSo, Monetochka is a creative pseudonym under which the name of Elizabeth Gardymova is hidden. The girl was born in Yekaterinburg in 1998. Birthday, Monetochka celebrates June 1st.\n\nThe singer's parents are far from creativity. Dad works as a builder, and mom is a manager in a travel agency. Elizabeth admits that her parents always supported her desire to make music. In an interview with The Flow, Lisa said that she even watched the meeting of rappers Oxxxymiron and Purulent with her parents.\n\nThe girl composed her first poems at a very young age. Parents have a video in which the girl is only 4 years old and she says, “Brook, brook, give us water for tea.”\n\nIn adolescence, the girl has already come to grips with poetry.
