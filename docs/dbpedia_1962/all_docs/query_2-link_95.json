She manages to secure a consultation with an eye specialist for little Semyon thanks to blind singer, Diana Gurtskaya’s Foundation. Efrosinia is overjoyed after Semyon meets the artist in person, and she offer encouragement to the boy and his family. Nikolay Kopylov’s pain is worsening, and he’s returned to Hospice #3, but his spirits are much higher after his prayers in the chapel are answered with a visit from his daughter after 25 years of separation."
