        "text": "Land and Climate\n\nPoland extends about 400 miles (640 kilometers) from north to south and some 430 miles (690 kilometers) from west to east. It is located in the east-central portion of Europe. The country is bordered on the east by Russia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine. On the west lies Germany, and on the south are the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Poland is bordered on the north by the Baltic Sea. Poland lacks strongly defined natural boundaries in the west and east, and its borders have changed many times in the past.\n\nThe most extensive physical feature is the great plain that covers the northern two-thirds of the country. It is part of the North European Plain, which extends from the Netherlands, through Germany and Poland, eastward toward Russia.\n\nThe North European Plain is mainly flat, but in places there are chains of small hills formed by glacial deposits. The highest of these hills are the Baltic Heights, which are more than 400 feet (120 meters) high and stretch across the country in the north. North of the heights a plain extends along the coast of the Baltic Sea. In the east the smooth coastline is broken by two lagoons. In the west another lagoon forms part of the border with Germany. To the south of the heights, the central plain contains some wide, shallow valleys through which rivers flowed in ancient times.\n\nThe southern third of the country consists of hills and mountains. In the southwest the Sudeten Mountains form part of the border with the Czech Republic. They are the broken remnants of an ancient mountain mass. In places they reach more than 3,300 feet (1,000 meters) in height. Farther east several ranges of the western Carpathian Mountains continue along the border. The major range is the Beskids. Farther south part of the Tatra Mountain range is located on Polish territory. This range contains Rysy, the highest mountain in Poland at 8,199 feet (2,499 meters). Zakopane, the largest tourist and resort center in Poland, lies at the foot of the Tatras. To the north of the Carpathians there are areas of hills. The most notable of them are the Swietokrzyskie (“Holy Cross”) Mountains, which reach more than 2,000 feet (610 meters).\n\nThe longest river in Poland is the Vistula. It rises in the Beskids and flows for more than 650 miles (1,050 kilometers). It runs in a wide, S-shaped curve across Poland until it reaches the Baltic Sea. The Vistula’s major tributary is the Bug River. The Oder River has its source in the Czech Republic and flows for 461 miles (742 kilometers) through Polish territory. It forms part of the border with Germany. Its major tributaries are the Noteć and Warta rivers.\n\nThere are no large lakes in Poland. In the north there are many small lakes of glacial origin in the area of the Baltic Heights. The largest lakes are found in the Masurian Lakeland district in northeastern Poland.\n\nThe quality of soils varies considerably from one region to another. Many areas in northern and central Poland have sandy soils mixed in places with clay. These soils are not very fertile. Areas of former marshland and along rivers are more fertile. The best soils are found in the south, where dust created by retreating glaciers was blown southward, creating thick deposits of fertile loess soils.\n\nPoland has warm summers and cold, snowy winters. In January all parts of the country average temperatures below the freezing point, but the western border areas are somewhat warmer in the winter than those of the east. Summer temperatures are more uniform over the whole country and are generally moderate. Precipitation levels are not very high except in mountain regions. The capital city, Warsaw, has an average January temperature of 26 °F (–3 °C) and an average July temperature of 66 °F (19 °C). The city receives about 21 inches (53 centimeters) of precipitation each year, on average.\n\nEconomy\n\nIn the early 20th century, Poland had a free-market economy, in which businesses were privately owned and run. After the beginning of communist rule in the 1940s, however, the government took over the country’s industries and large farms.\n\nSteadily worsening economic conditions were a major factor in the collapse of the communist government in Poland in the late 20th century. Inflation approached 200 percent during the late 1980s. To end the massive labor strikes of 1988, the government agreed to hold talks with Solidarity, a trade union that had been declared illegal. The talks led to the relegalization of Solidarity in 1989. In May of that year, the communist government fell, and Solidarity candidates triumphed in parliamentary elections in June. The new government began restructuring industries and privatizing state enterprises. By the early 1990s more than half the Polish economy was in private ownership. Inflation eventually eased, falling to 10 percent in 2000 as Poland emerged as one of the leading economies of the former Soviet bloc.\n\nAs the transition to a market economy and privatization of industries continued in Poland, the country became increasingly involved with international economic and political organizations. In 1995 it became a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). In 1996 it joined the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Poland was an associate member of the European Union (EU) for 10 years before it ascended to full membership in 2004. Buoyed by strong industry and service sectors, Poland’s economy showed impressive resilience in the early 21st century. It continued to expand even during the 2008–09 global financial crisis, when Poland was the only European country whose economy did not slip into recession.\n\nAgriculture, Fishing, and Forestry\n\nBefore World War II Poland was predominantly an agricultural country. Much land was held by large landowners, but there were also many small uneconomical peasant farms. After the war and the establishment of communist control, attempts were made to turn peasant farms into socialist-style cooperative farms. Strong resistance from the peasants, however, resulted in the disbanding of most cooperative farms after 1956.\n\nToday about one-tenth of the country’s labor force works in agriculture. Roughly one-third of the land area is cultivated, and another one-tenth is pastureland. Sugar beets, wheat, potatoes, corn (maize), rapeseed (which yields canola oil), barley, apples, and rye are the main crops. Poland is one of the world’s leading producers of potatoes and rye.\n\nBeef cattle, dairy cows, and sheep are raised throughout the country, but the most numerous farm animals are pigs. Polish ham is a major export product. Horses are still common as draft animals. Poultry are valuable as a source of eggs, which are also exported. Small farms and the lack of modern technology have hampered agricultural production. Supplies of certain foodstuffs, such as meat, are often insufficient.\n\nSince World War II Poland has built a fishing industry—not only in the Baltic Sea but also on the Atlantic Ocean. Its fishing industry remains small, however.\n\nMost of the country’s wooded land is occupied by coniferous (cone-bearing) trees. Pine, larch, and spruce are Poland’s most economically important trees.\n\nIndustry\n\nIn industry, priority is given to the production of iron and steel, chemicals, and electricity. Katowice is the center of the iron-and-steel industry. The largest plant, however, is at Nowa Huta, near Kraków. The iron-and-steel and the electric-power industries depend on supplies of coal. Poland has some of the richest coal reserves in Europe and is one of the world’s major coal producers. Most of its coal is found in Upper Silesia in the southwest of the country, and there are smaller deposits in the east. Other fuel resources include small amounts of petroleum and moderately large deposits of natural gas.\n\nSulfur is Poland’s second most important mineral, and the country ranks among the world leaders in both reserves and production. Other important nonmetallic minerals include barite, salt, kaolin, limestone, chalk, gypsum, and marble. The historic salt mine in Wieliczka, near Kraków, has been in continuous use since the 13th century. In 1978 the mine was among the first places to be named a UNESCO World Heritage site. Poland also has important deposits of metallic minerals such as zinc. The country is a major world producer of copper and silver.\n\nThe chemical industry is significant. Chemical products, including fertilizers, are among the country’s main manufactures. Plastics and artificial fibers are also produced. Other important manufacturing products in Poland include food products, beverages, and textiles and clothing. In the 2010s manufacturing supplied between one-fifth and one-tenth of the country’s gross domestic product (GDP; the total market value of goods and services during the year).\n\nServices\n\nPoland’s service sector greatly expanded in the final decade of the 20th century. In the early 21st century the sector accounted for about three-fifths of the country’s GDP and employed about one-half of the Polish workforce. Services include a great variety of activities, including retail and foreign trade, financial services, real estate, tourism, health care, and government administration. The growth of tourism has been especially strong in Poland. Most foreign tourists arrive from Germany and the Czech Republic.\n\nTrade is also an important part of the Polish economy. The country’s principal exports include machinery, metals, textiles and clothing, coal, and food products. Machinery, chemicals, and fuels are among the major imports. Germany is the largest market for almost all categories of exports. Russia remains the most important source of energy imports, and Germany and Italy serve as the chief sources of foreign machinery and chemicals. Poland’s other major trade partners include the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, France, China, and the Netherlands.\n\nTransportation and Communications\n\nPoland has an extensive railroad network. The railways, administered by the Polish State Railways, began the process of privatization in the early 21st century. Light rail is available to commuters in more than a dozen cities. The country’s highway system is less developed. Modern multilane highways designed for high traffic volumes have been built in Warsaw, and projects have been undertaken to link Warsaw to provincial centers. However, the road system in general is of low quality. Only about two-thirds of Poland’s roads are paved.\n\nThe major internal waterways are the Oder and Vistula rivers and connecting canals. The Oder River reaches the Baltic Sea at the port of Szczecin. The major ports of Gdańsk and Gdynia are at the mouth of the Vistula River. The Bydgoszcz Canal connects the Vistula River with the Oder River, via the Noteć River. The Gliwice Canal connects the Oder River with the Upper Silesian industrial region. Poland’s national airline is LOT, which is based in Warsaw. There are numerous international routes centered on the airport at Warsaw. Other airports are located in Kraków, Gdańsk, Wrocław, Katowice, Poznań, and Szczecin.\n\nAs in many other countries, the use of cellular telephones has rapidly expanded in Poland, and they now greatly outnumber landline phones. Internet use has also grown steadily. The number of Internet users today includes more than two-thirds of the Polish population. There are both public and commercial television and radio stations in Poland. The print media include national and regional newspapers and magazines, and many communities publish local newsletters and bulletins.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first Polish state was established in the 10th century by Mieszko I. Under him the Poles became Christians. Mieszko’s descendants, known as the Piast Dynasty, expanded Polish power. Major enemies at this time were the German Teutonic Knights and the Tatars. After a period of political unrest Władysław I reunited the kingdom in 1320. His son Casimir III the Great protected it from its enemies and developed its economy and society.\n\nIn 1386 Queen Jadwiga of Poland married Władysław II Jagiełło, the grand duke of Lithuania, uniting two powerful states. This marked the founding of Poland’s Jagiellon dynasty. In 1410 the Jagiellon armies defeated the German Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Tannenberg.\n\nIn the 16th century, Poland and Lithuania expanded eastward to annex much of the Ukraine and some Russian territory. From this time the Russians also became one of Poland’s major opponents. The greatest Polish king of this period was Sigismund II Augustus.\n\nIn 1572 Sigismund II died without an heir. He was thus the last Jagiellon king. Under the following Vasa dynasty, Poland became involved in wars with Sweden, Russia, and Turkey. In 1610 the Poles succeeded in occupying Moscow, Russia, but this success was short-lived. Russian advances on Polish territory and a Swedish invasion in 1655 created a major crisis. The Poles fought back, however, and the Swedish invasion was checked while a truce with Russia was obtained. The Polish king John III Sobieski defended Vienna against the Turks in 1683 and saved western Europe from a Turkish invasion.\n\nPrussia, Russia, and Austria all annexed parts of Poland in 1772. A small Polish state was left at the mercy of its enemies. In 1793 Poland was further partitioned among the three powers. The patriot Tadeusz Kosciuszko led a peasant army in a national insurrection against the Russians.\n\nIn 1795 Poland’s last remaining territory was occupied by the three partitioning powers. Many Poles fled the country. In 1807 Napoleon I, the emperor of France, supported the formation of a small and weak Polish state. After Napoleon’s defeat by Russia, however, the Russians returned.\n\nAlexander I, the emperor of Russia, permitted the existence of a Russian-controlled Polish kingdom. The Poles staged an uprising in 1830. The Russians put down the uprising, however, and began suppressing Polish culture and institutions. In 1863 another insurrection resulted in the total extinction of Poland as a separate political unit.\n\nDuring World War I Russia fought Austria and Germany, often on Polish territory, and during this time the population suffered greatly. The Polish leaders, however, gained the support of the Allies, especially France. In 1918 an independent Poland again appeared with Józef Piłsudski as head of state. The pianist Ignacy Paderewski became prime minister.\n\nIn 1921 the Soviets and the Poles signed a peace treaty. It gave Poland substantial territories in the east that were mainly populated by Ukrainians and Belarusians. The internal political situation in Poland was not very stable, and in 1926 Piłsudski took control as president of the republic and head of the government. He was thus a virtual dictator. After his death in 1935 political unrest again developed, but this period ended with the outbreak of World War II.\n\nDuring the 1930s Nazi Germany put forward demands for the annexation of the free city of Gdańsk (Danzig) and began to organize incidents on the Polish-German border. On September 1, 1939, Germany invaded Poland, forcing Britain and France (who both supported Poland) to declare war.\n\nThe German campaign in Poland was short. The Polish position was made impossible when Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland on September 17, 1939. The invasion was the result of a secret agreement made between the Soviets and Nazi Germany. Germany and the Soviet Union annexed parts of Polish territories. Much of the Jewish population was forced into ghettos and later removed to such death camps as Auschwitz (Oświęcim), Majdanek, and Treblinka. In 1943 an unsuccessful uprising in the Warsaw ghetto was brutally suppressed by the Germans. Many Christian Poles also died in the camps, while others were taken to Germany as laborers.\n\nIn April 1943 mass graves of 4,300 Polish officers were discovered in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk in the Soviet Union. The Soviets claimed the German army had executed the officers in July 1941. Later investigations revealed that it was actually the Soviet security authorities who had executed the Poles in the spring of 1940. The Soviet Union acknowledged responsibility for the killings in 1990.\n\nThe Polish government in exile in London, England, formed a Polish army, navy, and air force composed of refugee Poles. A Polish home army of underground fighters was in radio contact with the London government. When the Soviet Army entered Poland in 1944 and was approaching Warsaw, the home army received orders to liberate the capital city from the Germans before the Soviets arrived. After two months of fighting, however, the home army surrendered to the Germans, and Warsaw was virtually destroyed. The Soviets made no attempt to help the Polish fighters.\n\nThe Soviet Union (a communist country) set up a communist government in Poland. When the Soviet Army first reached Polish territory, it established a committee of national liberation in Lublin. This committee later became a communist provisional government based in Warsaw.\n\nPolish frontiers underwent a major shift after the Allied conference in Potsdam, Germany, in 1945. The Soviet Union retained control of the territories that it had obtained in 1939. Poland gained large areas of former German territory in the west, including the industrial region of Upper Silesia, the ports of Gdańsk and Szczecin, and a long Baltic coastline. Poles from the Soviet-occupied areas were resettled on lands in the west that had expelled Germans.\n\nCommunist control of Poland was intensified with the removal of more liberal political leaders such as Władysław Gomułka in 1949. In 1956, however, a major political upheaval led to the return of Gomułka as first secretary of Poland’s communist party with the support of Nikita Khrushchev, the new Soviet leader.\n\nDuring Poland’s communist period, secret police arrested, jailed, and sometimes killed people who disagreed with the government. The communist government also took over most businesses.\n\nIn 1970 the authoritarian Gomułka government fell after the eruption of bloody riots and strikes in several cities because of rises in food prices. Edward Gierek was appointed party leader. Further price increases in 1976 and 1980 created more unrest. In Gdańsk a committee led by Lech Wałęsa, an electrical worker, demanded the right to form independent trade unions. A national confederation of trade unions called Solidarity was formed. Gierek resigned, and Stanisław Kania succeeded him as first secretary of the party. Kania resigned in 1981 and was replaced by General Wojciech Jaruzelski, who banned Solidarity. Only unions pledging allegiance to the communist party were permitted. In 1985 Jaruzelski resigned as prime minister and was replaced by Zbigniew Messner.\n\nIn September 1988 Messner and his cabinet resigned amid growing furor over the economy. Mieczysław Rakowski became prime minister. On April 5, 1989, Solidarity was legally restored. In June parliamentary elections, Solidarity won the majority of seats in the new Senate and all of the seats allocated to opposition parties in the Sejm, or lower house. Jaruzelski became president. Rakowski resigned in August. Communist attempts to form a government failed. Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Solidarity then became Poland’s first noncommunist prime minister in more than 40 years.\n\nThe second half of 1989 was dominated by a growing economic crisis. It was brought on by the government’s introduction of market pricing for agricultural products and by skyrocketing inflation. In 1990 the communist party disbanded and reorganized as the Social Democratic Party, an opposition party to Solidarity. The country’s first fully democratic elections since World War II were held on May 27, when the local councils were chosen. On December 9 Wałęsa won the presidential election.\n\nIn 1993 Polish voters restored former communists to power. The vote marked a backlash against the harsh economic repercussions of privatization reforms begun under the Solidarity government. The Solidarity coalition lost control of the Sejm to the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), a coalition built on the remnants of the fallen communist party. Waldemar Pawlak became prime minister. In 1995 the Alliance won the presidency as well when Aleksandr Kwasniewski defeated Wałęsa.\n\nPoland’s economy began to radically improve as inflation slowed and unemployment began to subside. So substantial were Poland’s economic strides that it emerged as the front-runner among the formerly communist countries of eastern Europe to be admitted into the expanded NATO, which cited Poland as a model for economic and political reform. Nevertheless, by appealing to strong Roman Catholic sentiments and still-prevalent anticommunist beliefs in Poland, the Solidarity coalition was able to regain control of the Sejm in a national vote held in September 1997. Kwasniewski was reelected president in 2000, while Wałęsa, capturing only 1 percent of the vote, announced his retirement from politics.\n\nIn July 1997 NATO officially invited Poland, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, to join the trans-Atlantic security alliance. Poland’s membership in NATO became official on March 12, 1999. In a nationwide referendum in 2003 the Polish electorate approved EU membership for their country. Accession to the EU took place on May 1, 2004.\n\nIn September 2005 the Law and Justice Party (PiS) won a plurality in the Sejm and formed a ruling coalition. The cofounders of the PiS, identical twins Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczyński, attained the posts of president (2005) and prime minister (2006), respectively. In early parliamentary elections held in 2007, the PiS was defeated by the center-right Civic Platform Party, whose leader, Donald Tusk, replaced Jaroslaw Kaczyński as prime minister.\n\nOn April 10, 2010, President Lech Kaczyński died in a plane crash on his way to commemorate the Katyn Massacre. The crash, which occurred not far from the Katyn site, also killed Kaczyński’s wife and some 90 others, including a number of top Polish government officials. Bronislaw Komorowski, the speaker of the Sejm, was named acting president. He was elected president in July.\n\nPoland weathered the global economic downturn that began in 2008 better than most of its EU partners. In the 2011 national parliamentary elections, Polish voters returned the Civic Platform Party to power. Tusk became the first Polish prime minister since the collapse of communism to serve a second consecutive term. In 2014 EU leaders voted unanimously to select Tusk to succeed Herman Van Rompuy as president of the European Council, one of the EU’s governing bodies. Tusk resigned as prime minister in September 2014 before his term as head of the European Council began. He was replaced by Ewa Kopacz, the speaker of the Sejm. Kopacz was only the second woman to serve as Poland’s prime minister. (The first was Hanna Suchocka, who served in 1992–93.)\n\nThe PiS rebounded strongly in 2015. The PiS candidate Andrzej Duda was elected president. The party won an absolute majority in the Sejm, and Beata Szydło of the PiS became prime minister. The new PiS government soon clashed with the EU over the government’s moves to limit the powers of Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal, which provided judicial review of legislation passed by the Sejm. In June 2016 EU leaders issued the first of several warnings to Poland on the matter, accusing the PiS government of endangering the rule of law. Responding to the threat of sanctions from the EU, President Duda in July 2017 vetoed two of the government’s judicial reform bills. The PiS government also came in for criticism from domestic and foreign observers for having expanded its control of the media and for allegedly silencing voices of opposition."
