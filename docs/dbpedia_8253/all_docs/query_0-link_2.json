        "text": "What are the main political parties in Poland offering ahead of the October 15th elections? The parties have, finally, published their manifestos just over a month before voting begins.\n\nBelow is a summary of the manifestos of the two largest parties running in the parliamentary elections.\n\nCivic Platform (PO) / Civic Coalition (KO)\n\nThe leading opposition party has moved its political centre of gravity from \"centre-right\" to \"centre-left\". The party perceives the need to be populist in offering social benefits - \"pork-barrel politics\" - in response to the same from the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) - to imitate the ruling alliance in this area.\n\nIn terms of personal ethics, the party and its alliance - Civic Coalition (KO) - have taken the opposite road, clearly opposing Law and Justice's hard line on abortion.\n\nTheir main policy has been viewed hitherto by critics as \"remove Law and Justice\", suggesting a lack of policy initiative. So their manifesto was keenly awaited.\n\nTheir manifesto offers:\n\nsocial support to mothers returning to work after maternity leave\n\nliberalisation of abortion law\n\nhigher salaries, in particular for school teachers (a group notably dissatisfied with the ruling party)\n\na return to \"rule of law\" in Poland, following recent crises in judiciary\n\npunishment of Law and Justice leaders found guilty of violating the constitution\n\n\"European\" level of healthcare\n\nLaw and Justice (PiS) / United Right (ZP)\n\nIn Poland described as \"right-wing\", their policies are economically very left-wing in international terms. The ruling party has introduced several extremely large benefits packages. Their claim to be right-wing is based partly on their pro-Church stance, but this has been perceived as political expedience rather than conviction, at times. Their main international \"win\" has been their firm support of Ukraine, but this policy is not popular or at least not of much interest to their grassroots support. Before the elections they have softened expressions of support for Ukraine to appeal to the nationalist sentiments in their electorate.\n\nTheir manifesto offers:\n\nincreasing child support - from their flagship \"500+\" to \"800+\"\n\nadding a month's extra pension for pensioners\n\nfree medicine for the elderly and for children\n\nincreasing efficiency of tax system\n\nfurther modernisation of the Polish Army\n\nSources: Newsweek, Super Express, pis.org.pl, Program KO\n\npt"
