        "text": "The president of Poland is directly elected for up to two five-year terms. The president’s appointment of a prime minister must be confirmed by the Sejm, the lower house of the parliament. While the prime minister holds most executive power, the president also has some influence, particularly over defense and foreign policy matters.\n\nAndrzej Duda, the candidate of the national-conservative PiS party, was reelected in July 2020 in the second round of Poland’s presidential election with 51 percent of the vote. Voter turnout was 68.1 percent, the second highest since 1989.\n\nThe election was originally scheduled for May 2020. In April, amid political conflict over whether to hold voting during the COVID-19 pandemic, the government drafted plans to hold the vote as scheduled in May, but with mail-in ballots, transferring the election’s administration to the post office instead of the constitutionally legitimate National Electoral Commission (PKW). Ultimately, the government backtracked on these plans, and a new election was called in June, with a runoff a month later.\n\nObservers noted that the government had failed to meet its constitutional obligations by abandoning the May vote without any formal procedure, and in September 2020, an administrative court ruled that the prime minister had broken the law in attempting to transfer the election administration to the post office. In May 2021, the country’s Supreme Audit Office (NIK) blamed high-ranking officials for seeking to organize the mail-in vote without a legal basis and at a cost of almost $20 million to taxpayers. The government has repeatedly defended the legality of its actions.\n\nElection observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) concluded that the 2020 election was competitive and well-organized, but tarnished by “hostility” and “biased coverage by the public broadcaster,” which PiS had effectively transformed into a government mouthpiece. The OSCE mission noted the insufficiency of regulations governing public officials’ campaign activities, with the incumbent receiving an “undue advantage” from campaigning by high-ranking officials, including the prime minister. Further, the OSCE observers raised concerns over the persistent use of homophobic rhetoric by President Duda, his team, and PiS media allies.\n\nThe current prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, was appointed in 2017 with the approval of the PiS majority in the parliament. His mandate was bolstered by PiS’s victory in the 2019 legislative elections.\n\nMembers of the bicameral parliament are elected for four-year terms. The 460-seat Sejm, the lower house, is elected by proportional representation and holds most legislative authority. The 100 members of the Senate, the upper house, are elected in single-member constituencies. The Senate can delay and amend legislation, but has few other powers.\n\nIn the October 2019 parliamentary elections, PiS won a second term with 43.6 percent of the vote, retaining its 235 seats in the Sejm. This majority initially allowed PiS to continue governing without formal coalition partners, though two smaller parties, United Poland and Agreement, were included within its electoral lists and parliamentary caucus. In August 2021, Jarosław Gowin, the leader of Agreement, left the ruling camp with a number of lawmakers. The coalition continued to pass legislation throughout 2021 by making deals with smaller parties and individual members of parliament.\n\nThe Civic Platform (PO) party finished second in 2019, with 134 seats. Four other parties or coalitions passed the threshold to enter parliament, including left-wing and far-right parties that had been absent during the previous term. PiS, however, narrowly lost control of the Senate in 2019, where an opposition coalition took 51 of 100 seats; PiS took 48.\n\nAn OSCE mission concluded that the 2019 elections were generally conducted in a “professional and transparent” manner. However, they expressed concern that recent judicial reforms had left a “lack of trust in prosecutors and courts to handle election-related complaints independently.” They also noted that “nationalist and homophobic rhetoric gave rise to a sense of threat,” which they echoed in their report on the 2020 presidential election.\n\nIn December 2021, a research team at the University of Toronto reported that a mobile phone belonging to a Polish opposition politician had been hacked with Pegasus spyware in the period leading up to the 2019 parliamentary elections. At the time, the MP was the head of the election campaign team for PO. Text messages stolen from his phone were used in negative reports about him on PiS-controlled public TV news during the campaign. Phones of an opposition-linked lawyer and a prosecutor critical of the government’s judicial reforms were also hacked. Though opposition figures blamed the PiS for the incident, the government denied using surveillance for political purposes.\n\nPoland’s electoral framework and its implementation have generally ensured free and fair elections, though legal changes introduced in 2017–18 have increased the potential for political influence over the PKW, which manages elections and oversees party finances, including the power to withhold state subsidies. Previously, all nine members of the PKW were nominated by courts. From the beginning of the new parliamentary term in December 2019, seven members are now chosen by the parliament. As the largest parliamentary grouping, PiS was allowed to nominate a maximum of three members but could also exert influence over the member picked by the Constitutional Tribunal (TK), which is currently led by PiS-installed judges. The new commission was formally approved by President Duda in January 2020.\n\nOne of the judicial reforms that came into force in 2018 gave the newly created chamber of the Supreme Court—the Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs, whose members are appointed by the now-politicized National Council of the Judiciary (KRS)—the authority to validate or reject election and referendum results. The chamber’s substantial power, along with its vulnerability to politicization, further threaten the integrity of electoral oversight.\n\nIn 2020, PiS undermined the authority of the PKW by ordering the postal service to administer a mail-in vote without passing proper legislation. The head of the PKW and international democracy watchdogs said such a vote—which was ultimately abandoned—would have been neither fully free nor fair.\n\nPiS came to power promising to clean up corruption, cronyism, and nepotism. Cronyism, a problem under all previous Polish governments, is widespread under PiS, as it has altered, lowered, or removed many criteria for staffing of public institutions, allowing for appointments based on party loyalty and personal connections. In July 2021, PiS adopted a resolution prohibiting family members of politicians from taking jobs in state-owned companies. The resolution, however, does not apply retroactively and includes major exemptions.\n\nIn past years, the NIK, a state watchdog, has raised concerns about the misuse of public funds by PiS and its coalition partners. However, since the PiS-appointed chair of NIK took office in 2019, he has been investigated for possible irregularities in his property declarations and links to a criminal group. He has called the allegations a “smear campaign” and rejected the prime minister’s call for his resignation.\n\nIn July 2021, the NIK called for an investigation into the justice ministry for allegedly improperly dispensing hundreds of millions of złoty meant for victims of crime, including to political allies. In response, the justice minister is seeking to strip the NIK head of immunity from prosecution.\n\nThe constitution guarantees freedom of expression and forbids censorship, though libel laws have been used to harass journalists. Since 2015, nearly 200 lawsuits against independent media outlets and journalists have been filed by politicians and government-affiliated entities.\n\nPublic media and their governing bodies have been purged of independent or dissenting voices since PiS came to power in 2015. TVP, the state broadcaster, promotes government messages and often seeks to discredit the opposition, in flagrant breach of statutory obligations to present news in a “reliable and pluralistic manner.” In June 2021, an international study found that TVP is the least trusted of Poland’s most prominent news sources. TVP also depicts voices critical of the government, including NGOs and judges, as agents of the opposition or foreign forces. The broadcaster’s electoral coverage in 2020 was marked by “xenophobic, homophobic and antisemitic” rhetoric, according to the OSCE’s observers.\n\nSince 2015, the government has regularly used state-run companies to exert control over local media. In December 2020, oil giant PKN Orlen bought the previously German-owned Polska Press, a media organization that publishes 20 regional daily newspapers, 120 regional weekly newspapers, and 500 online portals. While the company has pledged to safeguard editorial independence, more than a dozen editors-in-chief had quit or been dismissed by July 2021.\n\nPiS leadership also promised to pass a law “deconcentrating” and “repolonizing” private media by reducing foreign ownership, a move that would disproportionately affect the outlets that most vigorously hold the current government to account. In August 2021, the Sejm passed a bill preventing companies registered outside the European Economic Area (EEA) from majority ownership of Polish media companies. While officials say tightening ownership rules would prevent states like China and Russia from influencing media, opposition figures have accused the government of seeking to silence the US-owned TVN, a prominent critic of PiS and the country’s largest private broadcaster. The bill was rejected by the Senate in September, but passed again by the Sejm in December, before being vetoed by Duda later that month.\n\nSince 2015, state-controlled companies have also shifted their advertising to private media outlets that support the PiS government. More critical outlets have suffered a corresponding drop in advertising revenue, as well as a sharp decline in subscriptions from government ministries. In February 2021, the government proposed a new tax on media advertising revenue, which independent media organizations claimed would threaten media freedom; following widespread protests, including an unprecedented 24-hour media blackout, the government agreed to rewrite its proposal.\n\nIn September 2021, the government declared a state of emergency barring journalists from visiting two provinces on the border with Belarus amid a surge of illegal migrant crossings. Critics say the measure is designed to limit media scrutiny of official conduct in the area.\n\nSince taking power in 2015, the PiS government has moved aggressively to assert control over the judiciary, passing legislation designed to curb the powers of the TK and to install progovernment judges on its benches. In a May 2021 ruling, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) found that the TK is not a “tribunal established by law,” because at least one of its judges was illegitimately appointed.\n\nIn 2017, three significant judicial reforms were adopted. The first gave the justice minister the power to appoint and dismiss presidents and deputy presidents of courts. The second, which came into force in 2018, mandated that 15 of the 25 members of the KRS, which is responsible for nominating judges, be appointed by the parliament instead of elected by the judiciary. In July 2018, new, lower retirement ages for the Supreme Court came into force, effectively meaning that 27 out of 73 judges had to step down unless they were given the president’s approval to remain. These judges were reinstated later that year after an infringement procedure from the European Commission and an interim ruling of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), which later confirmed that the measures had breached European law. The Supreme Court law also created powerful new chambers—the Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs (responsible for declaring the validity of elections), and the Disciplinary Chamber.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020, the European Commission launched infringement procedures alleging that the Disciplinary Chamber undermined the independence of judges. In July 2021, the ECJ ordered that the activities of the Disciplinary Chamber be suspended, expanding the scope of an earlier judgment, which, according to critics, the Polish government had ignored. The ECJ’s July 2021 ruling stated that the Chamber lacked independence from the legislature and executive, and that measures needed to be taken immediately to rectify the situation. The same day, the TK ruled that the interim measures imposed by the ECJ conflict with Poland’s constitution, potentially opening the way for the government to ignore the ECJ’s rulings on the Disciplinary Chamber. In October 2021, the ECJ imposed a daily penalty of one million euros on Poland until the measures required by the Court’s order are fully implemented.\n\nThe same month, in response to a motion from Poland’s prime minister, the TK ruled that some parts of EU law are incompatible with Poland’s Constitution, which would have primacy in such cases. The European Commission responded by launching another infringement procedure, arguing that the TK’s July and October rulings had violated EU law. The Commission also expressed “serious doubts on the independence and impartiality” of the TK itself.\n\nSince 2018, several European courts have rejected Polish arrest warrants and extradition requests, citing concerns about the independence of Polish courts. In September 2020, a Dutch court ruled that the Netherlands would suspend all extraditions to Poland until the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) responds to its concerns about the ability of the Polish judiciary to ensure fair trials for all defendants.\n\nWomen and ethnic minority groups generally enjoy equality before the law. LGBT+ people continue to face discrimination. Public support for LGBT+ rights, including same-sex civil partnerships, has risen in recent years. However, 2019 and 2020 saw major setbacks, as an intense anti-LGBT+ campaign led by PiS and parts of the church stoked fears of an “imported LGBT ideology.” By the end of 2020, more than 100 local governments had declared themselves “LGBT-ideology-free” zones or established “family charters,” in resolutions without specific legal implications that were described by domestic and international rights groups as “manifestations of hate” toward LGBT+ people. However, in 2021, the Polish government asked local authorities to repeal their anti-LGBT+ resolutions after the EU threatened to withdraw millions of euros in funding from towns that had adopted such declarations.\n\nBecause Poland’s law against inciting hatred does not cover crimes motivated by sexuality or gender identity, public figures have been free to make slurs that would be prosecuted if targeted at other marginalized groups.\n\nIn October 2021, the parliament authorized border guards to forcibly expel migrants who had crossed into the country illegally. This law was passed in response to the political and humanitarian crisis taking place along the Polish-Belarusian border, where Belarusian security forces were stranding migrants who then illegally crossed the border into Poland. The situation, apparently engineered by Belarusian President Alyaksandr Lukashenka, has trapped thousands of migrants between the two countries; approximately 20 migrants are believed to have died in the border zone in 2021. Human rights organizations, including the UN, have been denied access to the border zone, and have accused Polish authorities of putting migrants’ wellbeing and lives at risk with this policy of “illegal pushbacks.” In December, the European Commission proposed measures to allow for temporary extended asylum claim processes and expedited deportations.\n\nScore Change: The score declined from 3 to 2 due to unlawful, violent pushbacks of migrants at the Belarusian border, and other mistreatment of migrants by border guards.\n\nUnder Polish law, abortion is permissible through the 12th week of pregnancy if a woman’s health or life is in danger or if the pregnancy is a result of a criminal act such as rape. In October 2020, the TK ruled that abortion in cases where the fetus has a congenital disorder is unconstitutional, effectively restricting legal abortion to cases involving rape, incest, or danger to the life or health of the mother. In response to the ruling, mass protests with hundreds of thousands of participants took place in Warsaw and other Polish cities. Despite delays in late 2020, the ruling went into effect in January 2021. UN human rights experts said the ruling violates Poland’s human rights obligations, and has “effectively slammed the door shut” on legal and safe abortions in the country.\n\nSince 2017, contraceptive pills have been available by prescription only, making Poland one of only two EU countries in which such a restriction is in place. A report by the NIK found that in many, especially rural, parts of Poland, gynecologists are rare. Many women must travel to obtain care, and reliable and timely access to contraception and other sexual-health services is limited.\n\nSame-sex civil partnerships and marriages are not permitted, and same-sex couples are not legally allowed to adopt. The constitution places “marriage, as a union of a man and a woman,” under the “care and protection” of the state. In August 2021, the leader of PO, Donald Tusk, pledged to introduce same-sex unions as one of his first acts if his party wins elections.\n\nSince 2020, Poland’s ministers have debated withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention, a treaty to combat domestic violence and violence against women, on grounds of its alleged promotion of “LGBT and gender ideology.” In a September 2021 report, the Council of Europe praised several initiatives introduced by the Polish government to combat domestic violence, including a law passed in March 2020 mandating the immediate separation of perpetrators of domestic violence from their victims. The report further states that more progress must be made, specifically on changing the definition of rape to include all non-consensual sexual acts."
