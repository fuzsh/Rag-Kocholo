        "text": "In 1990, 70 hard coal mines were operating in Poland, most of them in Upper Silesia (Silesia Province). They employed nearly 390,000 workers and extracted 147 million tons of hard coal (Karbownik 1997). Large and inefficient, the coal sector struggled to compete in Poland’s new market economy and since 1990 has undergone a series of restructuring reforms aimed at scaling down employment, reducing debt, improving management, and adjusting production to improve the mines’ economic performance and competitiveness. As a result of the reforms, by 2020 employment in hard coal mining had shrunk to roughly 80,000, and annual coal production had decreased to 54 million tons. (Polish Industrial Development Agency 2022).\n\nAlthough the reform programs had some temporary successes, none achieved the objective of making hard coal mining a competitive sector with good prospects for the future. The sector’s decline continued, even though successive governments all assumed that coal would remain the foundation of Poland’s energy security for the foreseeable future and therefore implemented energy policies favoring coal (Kamola-Cieślik 2017). Between 1990 and 2016, hard coal and the lignite mining sector received an estimated $25 billion in direct subsidies, in addition to $0.9billion to $1.4 billion annually in subsidies for miners’ pensions. For easier comparability, all the values in the report which were originally expressed in Polish currency were converted to 2021 US dollars using Polish GDP deflator and average exchange rate from 2021. The coal and lignite sectors also benefited indirectly from a steady flow of subsidies for coal-based power production, which helped sustain demand for coal (WiseEuropa 2017). Despite these efforts, by 2020 the major Polish coal mining companies were running at a loss again (Ministry of State Assets 2020), even before the impacts of the pandemic. The government and the unions negotiated a new plan, this time envisaging a final—albeit protracted—phaseout. This part of the report discusses the primary hard coal mining restructuring programs implemented since 1990.\n\n2.1. Early retirement and welfare allowance benefits, 1990–1998\n\nIn the first years of the transformation, only limited measures were available to help the coal sector and coal workers. Among the first policies to assist workers, emerging in 1993, were a preretirement benefit (“miners’ leave”) and a welfare allowance.\n\nMiners’ leave was offered to underground miners facing job loss at closing mines. Eligible beneficiaries who were old enough or had sufficient seniority on the job were paid 50 percent of their salary for a maximum of three years. The money could be taken in one upfront payment or in monthly installments. Miners eligible for this benefit were also allowed to keep the standard privileges of active miners: (1) the right to a yearly bonus (so-called 13th monthly payment), which was generally offered to public sector employees; (2) another yearly bonus (so-called 14th monthly payment), paid exclusively to miners; and (3) the coal allowance, provided either in kind (coal for use in domestic heating) or in monetary form (a sum of money equivalent to the market value of the in-kind coal).\n\nThe welfare allowance was a payment in return for voluntary termination of the employment contract. It was offered to miners who had more than three years left until their retirement age, and it could be paid for a maximum of two years, in monthly installments. Both benefits were cut in half if the former miner found another job during the benefit period.\n\n2.2. Mining Social Package, 1998–2002\n\nIn June 1998, the government adopted a plan called Reform of Hard Coal Mining in Poland, 1998–2002, Polish: Reforma górnictwa węgla kamiennego w Polsce w latach 1998–2002. which sought to address two problems identified as underlying causes of the sector’s rapidly deteriorating economic performance and accumulating liabilities: overproduction of coal and an oversized workforce. The reform aimed to restructure the sector and restore its viability by reducing state support in order to close unprofitable mines and downsize the workforce.\n\nThe workforce would be reduced by more than 100,000 (of the 243,300 mineworkers employed in 1997) by encouraging workers to leave voluntarily (without group layoffs) through measures outlined in the Mining Social Package (MSP), Polish: Górniczy Pakiet Socjalny 1998–2002. which was a complement to the natural retirement process.\n\nThe MSP measures were developed in agreement with the mining unions and therefore did not spark significant protests. The package was enshrined in an Act of 26 November 1998 on the Adaptation of Hard Coal Mining to Functioning in Market Economy Conditions and Special Rights and Tasks of Mining Communities, Polish: Ustawa z dnia 26 listopada 1998 r. o dostosowaniu górnictwa węgla kamiennego do funkcjonowania w warunkach gospodarki rynkowej oraz szczególnych uprawnieniach i zadaniach gmin górniczych. which gave it a higher profile than previous restructuring programs enacted as internal government documents. The act specified the program’s objectives, social mitigation instruments, sources and conditions of financing, and supervision of its implementation (Szpor and Ziółkowska 2018).\n\nThe MSP benefits, available to all underground miners who had been employed for at least five years, included early retirement and welfare allowances (see previous section). To provide incentives for the former miners to return to the labor market, the welfare allowances were complemented with an additional one-time bonus for those who found new jobs, as well as requirements to consider job offers and retraining opportunities offered by the public employment service offices. The alternative to welfare allowances was a one-time unconditional severance payment: miners could choose to receive a single payment with no further requirements or bonuses.\n\nInitial funding for MSP came from a loan provided by the World Bank to the Polish government to support the implementation of 1998–2002 mining reform. Overall expenditures on MSP from state funds equaled reached $1.9 billion in 1998-2002, with an additional $445 million provided by the mining companies (Turek and Karbownik 2005).\n\nThe reform led to the closing of 13 mines (leaving 41 in operation) and a reduction of the workforce by 102,600, with 67,000 workers benefiting from the package and the remainder going into regular retirement. The number of miners who took the voluntary leave offer was higher than expected: almost 37,000 workers opted for the early retirement, with nearly 30,000 choosing the one-time unconditional severance payment. Only 419 miners opted for the welfare allowance with the optional bonus on taking up new employment. The program authors had expected the welfare allowance to be the more attractive option, but miners overwhelmingly chose the more flexible alternative, which gave them a short-term financial cushion with no additional commitments (Szpor and Ziółkowska 2018).\n\nIn hindsight, accordingly, the MSP succeeded in reducing the size of the workforce and improving the mining sector’s economic performance, but it did not provide the support necessary to generate satisfactory outcomes for the workers who left the sector. The welfare allowance, which was expected to motivate workers to find new jobs, was perceived as too risky: obtaining its full benefits required beneficiaries to find new employment in a difficult labor market within two years of leaving the mine, and hence very few workers decided to use it. The assumption that a significant proportion of former miners would invest their one-time severance payments in starting their own businesses failed to materialize, and those who did start businesses in many cases failed because they lacked entrepreneurial experience and effective support mechanisms. The retraining opportunities offered by the public employment services were insufficient, and in some cases the new skills offered did not match the needs of the labor market. As a result, Silesia reported a considerable increase in unemployment during MSP implementation and in the years that followed: the percentage of jobless people in the region increased from 9.9 percent in 1999 to 16.5 percent in 2002 and a record 17.4 percent in 2003.\n\n2.2.1. Special privileges for mining municipalities\n\nThe MSP also addressed other priorities, such as environmental protection, cooperation with mining municipalities and regions, and implementation of EU standards in light of Poland’s upcoming EU accession.\n\nMining municipalities, legally defined in the 1998 act as those that had a functioning hard coal mine in 1999 or later, obtained special privileges. Silesia had 60 such municipalities. To support local job creation, a municipality could start new enterprises with the mining company, take over real estate from closed or scaled-down mines, and receive preferential loans from the government to stimulate economic activity (Szpor and Ziółkowska 2018).\n\nPensioners were entitled to a lifetime supply of 2.5 or 3 tons of free coal per year. The amount of the cash equivalent depended on the value of coal, based on market prices, and determined each year by the ministry responsible for the mining sector. Collective bargaining agreements in the mining industry included clauses concerning the coal allowance.\n\nIn 2012–2015, mining companies terminated the collective bargaining agreements that had included the coal allowances for pensioners and retired staff. The obligations were taken over by the State Treasury, which started paying out the cash equivalents to all entitled beneficiaries via Zakład Ubezpieczeń Społecznych (ZUS, the Polish social security institution). The financing of the coal allowance from the state budget constituted state aid to the companies, but it was considered consistent with the Council of the EU Decision of 10 December 2010 on State Aid to Facilitate the Closure of Uncompetitive Coal Mines (2010/787/EU) because it did not serve to extend the life of currently operating mines.\n\nIn 2017, a law on compensation for the lost coal allowance came into force and definitively resolved the coal allowance liabilities. Polish: Ustawa z dnia 12 października 2017 r. o świadczeniu rekompensacyjnym z tytułu utraty prawa do bezpłatnego węgla, Dz.U. 2017 poz. 1971. According to this law, every pensioner receiving the coal allowance would be paid a one-time benefit, as compensation for losing the right to free coal, in the amount of $3000 (net). These payments were again financed by the state budget. The cost of implementing the law was more than $700 million, with 235 thousand eligible beneficiaries). https://www.cire.pl/item,152295,1,0,0,0,0,0,opublikowano-projekt-ustawy-o-rekompensacie-za-utracony-deputat-weglowy.html.\n\nSubsidies to pensions and social security benefits for miners could be considered as an indirect form of aid to the mining industry, in the sense that the government accepted the liabilities after collective bargaining agreements were broken in 2012-2015, rather than forcing the companies to continue to bear the costs. Government expenditures on such subsidies have amounted to around $0.9billion to $1.4 billion per year for the past 10 years. Since 1990, this type of support has absorbed more funds than direct coal subsidies and grants, and it currently is the single item that receives the most total public funding going to the sector.\n\n2.5. The Ministry of State Assets (2018) is the primary source for this section of the report. The Ministry of State Assets (2018) is the primary source for this section of the report.\n\nThe Program for the Hard Coal Mining Sector in Poland for 2018–2030 was adopted by the Council of Ministers in January 2018 as yet another attempt at restoring the sector’s competitiveness and improving its economic performance. In 2019, the feasibility of the program was assessed, resulting in corrections and updates to the program. Implementation of the program was expected to continue until 2030.\n\nThe program consists of two parts. The first, an analysis of the current state of the hard coal sector, shows that Poland has approximately 32 billion tons of undeveloped hard coal deposits, which the government deems a sufficient reserve to ensure availability of a domestic coal supply capacity (for comparison, in 2019 Polish coal mines extracted 62 million tons of coal). It should be noted, however, that the program does not address the economic viability of developing new deposits, omitting both supply-side (increasing extraction costs due to rising wages) and demand-side (energy transition and European long-term decarbonization targets) issues.\n\nThe second part of the program outlines program objectives and the methods to achieve them. The main goals are to maintain sufficient coal production capability in Poland to safeguard electricity supply availability, and to support the domestic coal industry. Of the 10 specific objectives to be achieved, the most important is to stabilize the profitability and financial liquidity of the mining industry by adapting production to market needs. Further objectives involve integrating the mining industry with the power sector, ensuring that the mining industry can meet domestic demand for coal, developing new coal deposits and improving mining efficiency, developing employee competencies, supporting and developing clean coal technologies, improving safety in mines, diversifying the industrial use of hard coal, unifying and simplifying the remuneration system in the mining industry, and completing restructuring measures (including the incorporation of Kompania Węglowa Kompania, a Polish joint-stock company based in Katowice, was the largest mining company in Europe in 2003–2016. All mining sites and mining infrastructure were taken over by PGG in 2016. into the Mine Restructuring Company). The program does not provide any new safeguards for people leaving the mining industry. Accordingly, it does not add to programs already in place to address the challenge of a just transition in the sector.\n\nConsolidation plans for vertical integration of mining companies and energy utilities call for the establishment of two groups: the Upper Silesian Group of energy coal producers, with Polska Grupa Górnicza (PGG, Polish Mining Group) as an entity taking over smaller producers, PGG S.A. is the largest mining company in Europe and the largest hard coal producer in the European Union. The special-purpose company was established to take over the assets and liabilities of the Kompania Węglowa. https://www.pgg.pl/.and the Eastern Group, which includes LW Bogdanka. LW Bogdanka is a hard coal mine in the Lubelskie coal basin, near the city of Lublin in eastern Poland. https://www.lw.com.pl/. The program also envisaged the development of a sector stabilization fund to mitigate the effects of economic fluctuations and a dynamic resource base as a tool for ensuring modern management of coal resources.\n\nAs of the end of 2021, the program has not been successful: there was no consolidation in the sector, and mining productivity has remained low while labor costs have risen, further diminishing the profitability of companies, and triggering another crisis in the sector. This is reflected in indicators collected by the government to monitor the program: in 2019 (before the pandemic hit), coal production was 14 percent below target levels, and the sector generated a $370 million loss instead of the target $285 million profit (Ministry of State Assets 2020). Overall, the failure to ensure self-sufficiency of the sector was a result of too little focus on cutting costs and improving productivity, which would require further mine closures and job losses. Given the opposition from the trade unions, the state-controlled mining companies were not able to execute the necessary restructuring actions and moderate increases in labor costs.\n\n2.6. Social Contract for mining industry transformation, 2021\n\nThe failure of the 2018 restructuring program resulted in quick deterioration of the mining sector. Covid-19 further accelerated the crisis and forced the Polish government to consider a new wave of restructuring, including further mine closures in mid-2020. Facing strong opposition from the mining trade unions, in September 2020 the government abandoned its previous plans and focused on lengthy negotiations on the so-called Social Contract with trade unions, which aimed to develop a mechanism to avoid sudden market-driven closure of coal mines and to prolong the coal phaseout.\n\nThe contract was signed in May 2021 by the Polish government, representatives of trade unions, representatives of the Stowarzyszenie Gmin Górniczych w Polsce (Association of Mining Communities in Poland) and the Stowarzyszenia Gmin Górniczych i Powiatów (Association of Mining Communities and Districts Authorities), as well as by representatives of coal companies covered by its provisions.\n\nThe contract specifies a schedule of closures for mines belonging to the PGG, Tauron, and Weglokoks companies. According to the schedule, the first mines would be closed in 2021, and the last mines would cease operation in 2049; the majority of mines would be closed after 2030. According to work carried out in the analytical phase of the program, to continue operating as per the schedule, most mines would need subsidies. The contract envisages a state aid mechanism to this end, but it will become effective only after it is checked by the European Commission for compliance with EU member-state aid rules. The notification process started in May 2021, but there is controversy as to whether the subsidy scheme will be approved as submitted (see for example ClientEarth 2021). It should also be noted that the contract does not cover other steam coal mining companies (e.g., Bogdanka mine in eastern Poland, several small, privately owned mines in Silesian coal basin), as well as coking coal mines. Thus, the document does not specify the end of hard coal mining in Poland. Instead, it extends the operational timeline of unprofitable coal mines in Silesia via the proposed state aid scheme.\n\nThe Social Contract does address just transition by stipulating a package of safeguards for employees of mines planned for closure. All workers employed in the mines as of September 25, 2020, have the right either to keep their jobs until they retire, or should that not be possible, to find employment in another operating mining unit; or to benefit from a special preretirement mining leave, during which they will receive 80 percent of their salary (for those who will retire within the next couple of years) or a one-time severance payment of $31,000 and a one-time retraining opportunity.\n\nThe Social Contract also envisages an investment of more than $4.1 billion in clean coal technologies, such as coal gasification, carbon capture and sequestration, or smokeless fuel production installations. However, the Contract is unclear on who would make the investments, and whether they are economically feasible even with public support.\n\nFinally, the Social Contract calls for establishing the Fund for the Transformation of Silesia ($130 million in initial capital and guarantees for another $260 million), with the objective of coordinating the transformation of former mine sites (as well as industrial and postindustrial sites) with broader economic development efforts in the province. The official term for provinces in Poland is voivodeship (“województwo”). Funding for this element will come from the EU Just Transition Fund. The Just Transition Fund (JTF), part of the EU Cohesion Policy 2021-2027, offers support to regions that face serious social and economic challenges resulting from transformations focused on climate neutrality. JTF was designed to facilitate the implementation of European Green Deal, including the transition to climate neutrality by 2050. JTF will support investments in economic diversification and regeneration of carbon-intensive areas. https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/find-funding/eu-funding-programmes/just-transition-fund_en.\n\n2.7. Power Sector Transformation and a National Energy Security Agency\n\nLike coal mines, Poland’s coal-fired power plants have been struggling financially because of rising carbon prices in the European Union, which exceeded 50 euros per ton of CO2 at the end of 2021. They have been kept afloat by a capacity payment mechanism, but that will be phased out as of 2025.\n\nThe solution for restructuring the Polish power sector proposed by the Polish Ministry of State Assets (2021) involves the creation of a state-run entity, the National Energy Security Agency (Narodowa Agencja Bezpieczeństwa Energetycznego, NABE). This agency would take over coal-fired power plants from utilities and continue running them, with the stated aim of maintaining the dispatchable generation resources required to ensure the reliability of the electric grid in Poland. To that end, NABE is expected to benefit from a not-yet-defined state aid scheme that also will be subject to the European Commission’s approval (Ministry of State Assets 2021).\n\nAccording to the government’s concept, NABE will purchase 70 coal-fired electricity generation units from three state-owned companies: PGE, Enea, and Tauron. The companies have been urging the government to unencumber them of the increasingly unprofitable coal-fired generation assets so that they can get financing to proceed with greener investments. Once established, NABE would be 100 percent owned by the State Treasury and function under the Commercial Companies Code. It would employ about 30,000 workers from PGE, Enea, and Tauron. It would hold installations with a total capacity of 23 GW, which in 2020 generated more than 80 TWh of electricity, around 55 percent of total power generation in Poland (Kowalczyk and Burny 2021). However, at this stage it is unclear how long the coal units would continue operating and when they would be moved into early decommissioning. It is therefore impossible to say how long NABE would keep buying coal and in what quantities, and to what extent that would enable coal mines to continue operating. It is also worth noting that NABE lacks any link to new investments in clean energy technologies that could deliver new jobs and support the transition of coal sector workers.\n\nEfforts to stimulate wider regional development in Silesia have run parallel to the mining sector’s restructuring and gradual decline. European funds—which started flowing into Poland even before EU accession in 2004—have assisted the region’s transformation and mitigated the social and economic effects of coal’s continuing decline. Since joining the European Union, Poland’s ability to subsidize the coal sector has become limited. However, with EU membership came the EU Cohesion Policy funds, which included investments in infrastructure, human capital, environmental protection, and public services. To access these funds and implement programs effectively, Silesia has had to build a new institutional structure, which has been instrumental in drafting and implementing regional development strategies and allocating the available funds. This chapter describes the province’s major regional development programs, the institutions set up to support their implementation, and other initiatives that have contributed to building economic alternatives to coal mining since the early 2000s.\n\n3.1. PHARE: European support before EU accession, 1999–2002\n\nCreated in 1989, PHARE was one of the main EU instruments supporting Central and Eastern European countries before their accession to the European Union in 2000s. Originally launched as Poland and Hungary: Assistance for Restructuring Economies (PHARE), the program expanded to cover 10 countries in the region. Funds were used to support reforms required to join the European Union, as well as to fund investments in economic and social cohesion.\n\nPHARE supported transition in Silesia after the major restructuring of the coal industry that followed the 1998–2002 reforms (when more than 100,000 people left the sector, see above). Former mine workers could enroll in two retraining programs funded by PHARE: INICJATYWA and INICJATYWA II (“Inicjatywa” is Polish for “initiative”). For Poland, these were the first programs providing broad support for economic development and job creation in sectors affected by economic restructuring, and they were offered in addition to the social packages discussed in the first part of this report. The following section derives findings from (i) Marshal’s Office of the Silesia Voivodeship (2004b) and ii) PARP (2004).\n\nThe budget of PHARE INICJATYWA was set at $52 million, of which $35 million was dedicated to supporting the mining sector’s restructuring and the remainder supported the restructuring of the steel industry. The funds were allocated for the following purposes:\n\nJob search assistance for workers leaving the mining and steel industries, retraining and skill development (so-called “activating measures”), and one-time severance payments ($26 million).\n\nJob creation through support and development of small- and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) ($24 million). The development of SMEs was stimulated by\n\na new system to cover social security contributions, which otherwise would need to be paid by former miners and steelworkers, decreasing SMEs’ cost of hiring them;\n\na loan fund (Fundusz Pożyczkowy) to support former miners and steelworkers in setting up their own businesses and creating new jobs;\n\na system of interest rate subsidies for loans granted to SMEs planning to employ former miners and steelworkers; and\n\na subsidized advisory services system for those who decided to use the above tools.\n\nA system to facilitate networking among practitioners working in this field and the sharing of best practices with a twin program implemented in Spain ($2 million).\n\nUnder the follow-up PHARE INICJATYWA II, $55 million was earmarked for continuation of INICJATYWA I activities (cofinancing severance payments, retraining, support for SMEs, technology transfer, further operations of the loan fund). Furthermore, the Local Subsidy Fund (Fundusz Dotacji Lokalnych) was established to support small-scale investments implemented by local governments. In total, $21.5 million was allocated to support the mining restructuring process, $16.8 million supported steel industry restructuring, and EUR 16.4 million was spent via the Local Subsidy Fund.\n\nThe Local Subsidy Fund was available to municipalities in areas with restructured and liquidated mines and steelworks. Grants for mining municipalities were earmarked for investment in projects consistent with the province’s development plans. A total of 33 investment projects were carried out, including the construction and modernization of roads, buildings, and sewage systems; creation of education centers; the development of designated areas for SME business activity and economic activity zones; and the expansion of transport infrastructure and services.\n\nOnly about 6,000 miners benefited from PHARE training programs. According to a 2007 study of the subject, among the graduates of both PHARE initiatives, 51 percent were employed, and 49 percent were without jobs (with 15 percent having worked but ultimately lost their jobs), and 9 percent of those who were working were running their own business. Reemployment had mainly been secured by workers under 30 years of age. In the group between ages 30 and 40, every second person found employment outside the mine. The chances of finding a job decreased above age 40. And, it was much more difficult for female former mine workers to find work than for males—the percentage of women in employment was 30 percent, versus 61 percent for men (Bara and Dobrowolska 2007). Workers leaving the mining and steel sectors most often found employment in the construction sector as heavy equipment operators (excavators, loaders, cranes, saws, crushers), in security and property agencies, as welders, and as freight truck operators (Mining Chamber of Industry and Commerce 2000).\n\n3.2. Program for Alleviating Effects of Employment Restructuring, 2003–2006\n\nThe implementation of PHARE programs demonstrated the importance and feasibility of complementing the restructuring measures in the mining sector with policies for job creation and broader economic development at the local level. This led the regional authorities in Silesia to create, in 2003, the Program for Alleviating the Effects of Employment Restructuring in the Coal Mining Sector in the Silesia Region. The program represented another step forward, as the regional government focused on integrating various sources of financing (including Polish government and EU funds) and established development priorities. This section of the report draws source material from Marshal’s Office of the Silesia Voivodeship (2003).\n\nIn the first stage (2004), $45 million was provided by the Polish government, which took a loan from Council of Europe Development Bank for this purpose. These funds were distributed via two policy instruments managed by Silesia’s regional authorities:\n\nFund for the Development of Local Infrastructure for Entrepreneurship, which supported development of local infrastructure and entrepreneurship ($37 million); and\n\nSmall and Medium Enterprises Loan Facility, which supported SME development ($8 million).\n\nFunding was allocated to 98 projects proposed by Silesian municipalities and counties. Most of the funds supported projects aimed at improving infrastructure, especially roads and building renovations, for potential SMEs. According to estimates by the Silesian regional authorities, the projects financed via the Fund for the Development of Local Infrastructure for Entrepreneurship led to the creation of 6,000 jobs(Marshal’s Office of the Silesia Voivodeship 2004a).\n\nThe SME Loan Facility provided support to businesses established by former mining employees, similar to the PHARE programs. Preferential loans were granted to manufacturing and market services. The loans granted to companies for 190 projects had a total value of $9 million. Most of the projects were implemented in the municipalities of Bielsko-Biała, Bytom, Gliwice, Katowice, Rybnik, and Jastrzębie Zdrój. According to the regional authorities, more than 1,100 new jobs were created as a result (Marshal’s Office of the Silesia Voivodeship 2005a).\n\nIn the second stage, the Silesia Province received $30 million from the same source (a Polish government loan from the Council of Europe Development Bank). As in the first stage, the funds were also used for local infrastructure investments, entrepreneurship programs, and SME development. Funds were allocated as follows: $21 million for infrastructure and entrepreneurship programs from the Fund for the Development of Local Infrastructure for Entrepreneurship, and $9 million for SMEs from the Small and Medium Enterprises Loan Facility. According to estimates by regional authorities, the funds helped SMEs in Silesia carry out investments worth a total of around $37 million and create about 1,200 new, permanent jobs in the region (Marshal’s Office of the Silesia Voivodeship 2005b).\n\n3.3. EU-funded Regional Operational Programs, since 2007\n\nSince 2007, European funds supporting regional economic development have been channeled via comprehensive programs covering broad socioeconomic challenges and managed by regional (sub-national) governments. This marked a shift toward more integrated management of EU funds on the regional level, compared with the previous years, when targeted programs were created to address specific topics (e.g., PHARE INICJATYWA) or when EU funds were used to finance selected elements of broader packages of measures (e.g., the Program for Alleviating the Effects of Employment Restructuring in the Coal Mining Sector). At the same time, the national government limited its involvement in financing regional development schemes, instead utilizing the increased availability of EU funds.\n\nThe Regional Operational Programs are examples of EU-funded plans drafted by regional authorities to reflect specific regional needs and development strategies, while contributing to the wider European objectives established in EU legislation. Within this system, two seven-year programs (implemented in 2007–2013 and 2014–2020) helped facilitate the transition of the Silesian economy.\n\nThe focus of Silesia’s regional programs has been to create conditions for economic development, with emphasis on economic diversification away from coal production. Program activities included investing in energy and transportation infrastructure, replacing old coal-based heating systems in buildings, reclaiming and revitalizing postmining areas, modernizing municipal infrastructure (e.g., renovated public buildings, efficient street lighting, improved sewage systems), and building human capital. The region was allocated $2.2 billion in 2007–2013 (the second-largest regional allocation in Poland during this period) and $4.4 billion in 2014–2020 (the largest regional allocation in Poland during this period).\n\nBy the end of the 2007–2013 program, funds had directly supported a broad range of initiatives, including (approximate estimates):\n\n3,000 SME projects,\n\n220 initiatives related to the digital economy,\n\n200 projects related to sustainable urban development,\n\nConnecting 48,000 households to wastewater systems,\n\nRevitalizing 220 hectares (around 540 acres) of degraded areas,\n\nPurchase of 200 public transport vehicles, and\n\nRenovation of 120 health care facilities, with more than 80 receiving new medical equipment.\n\nDevelopment of transport infrastructure (roads, rail, and urban public transport) was the largest spending category, accounting for more than a quarter of the total allocation, followed by sustainable urban development (mostly revitalization projects), which accounted for close to 18 percent. R&D, innovation, industrial clustering, and enterprise support projects (focused on SMEs) accounted for 17 percent of total funding, and environmental management (waste management infrastructure, sewage system development, investment in renewables) accounted for 11 percent. Most cities in Silesia also implemented projects to reemploy jobless persons over the age of 30, offering training and labor market assistance (Marshal’s Office of the Silesia Voivodeship 2017).\n\nA 2014 evaluation of the program (Rudolf et al. 2014) used macro-econometric modeling, case studies, and other methods to analyze the impacts of the 2007-2013 program. The report noted that evidence on the impacts of investments inherently was limited, given how soon after the program the evaluation was carried out. Notwithstanding these limitations, the authors estimated that the program expenditures contributed an additional 1.5 percent to regional GDP and generated nearly 20,000 new jobs, including indirect effects via increased overall economic activity. However, the record of accomplishments for specific objectives was quite mixed.\n\nThe 2014–2020 program included many of the same priorities as the 2007-2013 program, with a growing focus on clean energy and the low-carbon economy. For more details, see the webpage of the program: https://rpo.slaskie.pl/.Once again, the funds supported a broad range of activities directed at the transition away from traditional industries (e.g., revitalizing old industrial sites, inventorying postmining sites), infrastructure investments (e.g., constructing and modernizing educational and health care facilities, retrofitting public buildings, building new roads and public transport projects, building wastewater treatment plants), and social and environmental improvements (e.g., professional programs, building renovations to replace coal boilers and improve air quality). One example is the flagship program “Silesia Under the Blue Sky”, which supported air quality innovations (Marshal’s Office of the Silesia Voivodeship 2018).\n\nAs mentioned above, the Regional Operational Programs marked an evolution in the EU approach to funding regional development policy, including by disbursing funds through an arrangement known as “shared management,” where the regional government works with the European Commission to jointly plan, implement, and evaluate the programs. Spending plans must be based on and contribute to regularly updated regional development strategies while achieving EU policy objectives. Social partners, such as trade unions, business associations, civil society organizations, and local governments, must be involved in the planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of spending, in line with the EU partnership principle.\n\nThis governance arrangement contributes to regional development beyond financial support, by bolstering regional and local institutional capacity. The Regional Centre for Analysis and Strategic Planning within the Marshal’s Office (regional executive) of Silesia is one example of this—it provides the capacity needed to manage the EU funds, while also providing capacity for evidence-based regional development planning. For more details, see the webpage of the RCAS: https://rcas.slaskie.pl/.\n\nThe EU Multilateral Financial Framework for 2021–2027 See European Commission (2022c). takes the Cohesion Policy approach even further, with the Just Transition Fund as a prominent example. In addition to $600 million in regular funds for regional development, Silesia may benefit from $540 million under the Just Transition Fund. To tap into the funds, Silesia must prepare a Territorial Just Transition Plan that is embedded in the region’s development strategy, and that harmonizes with national energy policies and EU energy and climate policy objectives. Specifically, the assumptions of the plan (e.g., timeline of the phaseout of coal mining) must be consistent with Europe’s objective of reaching climate neutrality by 2050. Funds must be spent to alleviate the social and economic effects of the transition away from coal by supporting job creation (especially in the SME sector), assisting former coal workers, improving the quality of the environment, financing the reclamation and repurposing of postindustrial sites, and promoting innovation.\n\nThe governance framework for the development policy in Silesia is not limited to the Marshal’s Office working in cooperation with the European Commission. Other institutions play an important role in this context, in connection to both the EU and national policy frameworks, including:\n\nThe Katowice Special Economic Zone;\n\nRegional Agencies for Enterprise Development; and\n\nThe Network of Regional Specialist Observatories.\n\nThese institutions are discussed in more detail below.\n\n3.4. The Katowice Special Economic Zone\n\nSpecial economic zones (SEZs) are areas where businesses enjoy preferential conditions. Investors operating in these zones receive public aid in the form of tax relief, based on the investment made or the number of jobs created. The tax relief granted in a SEZ is consistent with the EU public aid rules applicable to similar zones in other countries of the European Union, so SEZ costs (i.e., forgone tax revenue) occur on the national level. Originally, the main purpose of the SEZ program was to attract foreign investment to areas facing restructuring challenges and job losses during the transition to the market economy in the 1990s. SEZs were established across the country, each managed by dedicated entities. Over time, the SEZ framework became a broader development policy instrument, with new provisions introduced in 2018 extending the tax incentives for new investors nationwide (Polish Investment and Trade Agency 2022). The entities responsible for managing the original zones are still delivering services to companies operating in their area, and clusters of economic activity established in the 1990s (in the existing SEZs) remain in place.\n\nThe Katowice Special Economic Zone (KSEZ, managed by a joint stock company of the same name, KSEZ S.A.) was established in 1996 to advance regional restructuring in the City of Katowice and to stimulate employment in the region. Since its launch, it has expanded to cover a broader area affected by industrial transition in Silesia. It is now the largest SEZ in Poland, covering an area of 2,750 hectares across 48 municipalities in Silesia and the neighboring Opole Province. KSZE S.A. provides investors with dedicated services, including real estate brokerage, connections with education institutions, consulting, and training. It maintains a database of potential contractors and offers support for investors looking for leases of office and storage space.\n\nAccording to KSEZ S.A., the 450 companies operating in the zone have so far invested more than $10 billion, and created more than 80,000 jobs, with more than 60 percent of investments coming from the automotive sector (Katowice Special Economic Zone 2022a). Given the importance of the automotive sector for the zone, it also launched its own Silesia Automotive & Advanced Manufacturing cluster.\n\nParticipation in the SEZ and the related public aid are available to companies in traditional industry sectors (excluding alcohol, tobacco, steel, electricity, and gas), plus service sector businesses, including IT, research and development, accounting and bookkeeping, technical testing and analysis, call centers, architecture, and engineering. Accordingly, the focus is much broader than just clean technologies in the energy sector. To be eligible, companies must meet qualitative and quantitative criteria for the amount of planned investment, size of company, sector, innovativeness, orientation toward exports, environmental sustainability, and quality of employment (Katowice Special Economic Zone 2022b).\n\n3.5. Regional Agencies for Enterprise Development\n\nSilesia has several regional development agencies tasked with supporting business development—in particular, supporting the development of SMEs and assisting their growth and competitiveness.\n\nGAPR Ltd., the Upper Silesian Agency for Entrepreneurship and Development, supports development of the region’s economy and stimulates entrepreneurship (SMEs in particular) by providing training services, business consulting and auditing services, energy audits and group energy purchases, investment and financing services, plus support for organizing conferences, promotional trips, and study visits. It provides financial support through preferential loans for microbusinesses and SMEs and assists businesses in finding foreign business and research partners (Enterprise Europe Network). It also operates in Gliwice, Jaworzno, Żory, and Bytom.\n\nUpper Silesian Fund S.A. focuses on financial support for microbusinesses and SMEs, using both its own resources and EU funding. It deals with nonbanking financial services, asset management, purchase and sale of securities and other financial instruments, and external capital to finance investments in Silesia Province, including financing for restructuring or new firms. It also offers loan programs: investment loans, revolving loans to provide working capital, and start-up loans. Finally, it distributes training subsidies and grants to unemployed persons intending to start a business.\n\nRegional Development Agency in Bielsko-Biala provides consulting, training, and educational services, including in the area of innovation and technology. The agency also helps companies apply for support from EU-funded programs and provides loans, loan guarantees, and financial intermediation via the Capital Projects Fund (Fundusz Projektów Kapitałowych Sp. z o.o.).\n\n3.6. Network of Regional Specialist Observatories\n\nThe Network of Regional Specialist Observatories in the Entrepreneurial Discovery Process is an EU-funded initiative whereby leading academic and research institutions and technology parks in Silesia work together to analyze the region’s economic sectors and identify “smart specializations” that have the potential to drive development (and should therefore have priority access to EU funds).\n\nSmart specialization is defined as “a place-based approach devised within the framework of the EU Cohesion Policy which seeks to identify strategic areas for intervention based both an analysis of the strengths and potential of the economy and on an entrepreneurial discovery process with wide stakeholder involvement. It is outward-looking and embraces a broad view of innovation including but certainly not limited to technology-driven approaches, supported by effective monitoring mechanisms” (European Commission 2022a). It is a way to maximize the innovation and development benefits of EU funds by identifying and tapping into the strengths of individual regions.\n\nFormally, the Network is a series of consecutive projects funded by the European Union via the regional operational program of Silesia. The mission of the observatories is enshrined in the Regional Innovation Strategy of the Silesian Province (the development of this innovation strategy is a continual process, with updates based on the contributions made by the observatories).\n\nIn the first edition of the project, four partners operated five observatories dealing with environmental technologies, energy, ICT, medicine, and nanotechnologies. In the current edition, 11 partner institutions operate eight observatories: the original five domains, plus transport, machine building, and materials.\n\nEach observatory publishes annual reports on market and development trends, areas of technological innovation, and R&D pathways. The reports analyze technological and innovation needs, examine the application of business models and instruments in the field of technology transfer and commercialization, define business and international cooperation opportunities for companies, and identify emerging smart specializations."
