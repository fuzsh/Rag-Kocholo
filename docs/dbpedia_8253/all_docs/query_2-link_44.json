The first survey was conducted in 1999, with subsequent waves in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2019. The number of countries increased from 14 Western European countries in 1999 to 24 current or prospective EU members in 2006 to 31 countries in 2019. In this time, the number of national parties grew from 143 to 277. The 2019 survey includes all EU member states, plus parties in Norway, Switzerland, and Turkey. Separate surveys were conducted in the Balkan candidate countries. Questions on parties' general position on European integration, several EU policies, general left/right, economic left/right, and social left/right are common to all surveys. More recent surveys also contain questions on non-EU policy issues, such as anti-elite rhetoric, immigration, redistribution, decentralization, and environmental policy.\n\ndatasets\n\nDataset (in STATA) (in csv)\n\nCodebook\n\nhow to cite\n\nWhen using the 1999-2019 trend file, cite the following:\n\nJolly, Seth, Ryan Bakker, Liesbet Hooghe, Gary Marks, Jonathan Polk, Jan Rovny, Marco Steenbergen, and Milada Anna Vachudova. 2022. “Chapel Hill Expert Survey Trend File, 1999-2019.” Electoral Studies 75 (February). https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2021.102420\n\nArchived: 1999-2014 Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES) trend file\n\ndescription\n\nThe Chapel Hill expert surveys estimate party positioning on European integration, ideology and policy issues for national parties in a variety of European countries.
