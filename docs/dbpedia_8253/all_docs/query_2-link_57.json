        "text": "Weekly Briefing, Vol. 69. No. 4 (PL) January 2024\n\nCulmination of tensions and political polarisation – election marathon in Poland\n\nKonrad Rajca\n\nSummary\n\nThe year 2024 will be marked in Poland by massive polarisation and political conflict between the new government and the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has been in power in Poland for the past eight years. After the new coalition took power, the process of the new government actually taking over power in the country, which is extremely sharp and conflictual, began. It involves the public media, the judiciary, the services, the army, the police, State Treasury companies and other institutions subordinate to the government. This process is causing and will continue to cause enormous tensions, as it implies a fundamental overhaul of institutions in which the influence of the previous government was and is strongly entrenched. The beginning of the year shows that the opposition Law and Justice party now intends to play the role of a total opposition (similar to the opposition during the Law and Justice government) torpedoing all actions of Donald Tusk’s government, in which it will be supported by President Andrzej Duda and persons and institutions linked to the Law and Justice party in the public media, the courts, the Constitutional Tribunal and the National Bank of Poland. The first months in power of the new government have also shown that it will not shy away from very decisive action to gain full influence over its subordinate institutions. Even by sympathisers of the current government, these are regarded as actions on the edge of the law. Huge social polarisation and sharpening of public discourse will be fostered by this year’s local elections (April) and European Parliament elections (June).\n\nThe huge political tensions are accompanied by positive information on economic development and other economic indicators of Poland. Experts predict that GDP growth in 2024 will be at a significantly higher level than last year; inflation forecasts are also significantly lower, compared to 2023.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe seizure of power in Poland in December by a new coalition led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk triggered a political earthquake of sorts in Poland. It marked the turning upside down of the political system that had been in place for eight years under the United Right, which was accused by its opponents of hijacking the state and subordinate institutions and of limiting the power of independent democratic institutions such as the media and the judiciary. The new government promised to hold its predecessors to account. Back in December, the new government began the process of removing the influence of the previous government in the media, as well as in the courts and other subordinate institutions. This is generating huge resistance from the current right-wing opposition , which intends to act as a total opposition and defend the changes it has introduced over the past eight years. This is creating a kind of bicameral power, mainly in the media and the judiciary, and polarising society, which is causing and will continue to cause enormous socio-political tensions. These culminated in January with the arrest at the presidential palace of prominent politicians from the previous government camp Mariusz Kaminski, former minister of internal affairs and administration and former head of the Central Anti-Corruption Bureau, and his deputy Maciej Wąsik, accused of abusing their powers.\n\nThe future of the new coalition\n\nThe new coalition government, during the campaign and after taking office, promised to hold its predecessors’ powers to account and to restore the independence from politicians of the public institutions it accuses its predecessors of appropriating. However, this process will certainly take a longer period of time and cause instability in governance. Especially with the opposition, President Andrzej Duda and institutions where the previous government has influence, playing the role of ‘total opposition’. In Poland, the President has the right of veto (objection) to laws passed by the parliament, thanks to which he can block the government’s legislative plans. (The president’s veto can be overruled by a 3/5 majority of the lower chamber of parliament – the Sejm – which, however, the government does not have). It will also be a challenge for the new government to maintain its unity, as it is made up of various groupings with often differing agendas, particularly on social and moral issues.\n\nThe new government has announced the continuation of previous social programmes implemented by its predecessors, such as the 500 plus programme, which it has turned into the 800 plus programme (this was also announced by the previous government). The programme is support for parents with children, starting in January at around 190 euros per month for each child up to the age of 18. The government also plans to introduce, as promised in the campaign, 30 per cent raises for teachers and 20 per cent for the entire budget sphere. It also wants to pay mothers of children under three a special monthly allowance of around 350 euros if they decide to return to work. All these promises mean increasing budget expenditure and the budget deficit. The challenge for the government, therefore, will be to maintain budgetary stability and implement the financial promises of the election (some of which, such as the reduction of the tax-free amount, have been postponed).\n\nThe second half of the year could see a worsening of the economic situation, which will be linked to the new government’s announcement to move away from the costly budget support introduced by the previous government – zero VAT tax on food and energy price subsidies. These supports have so far limited the level of inflation. The implementation of the new government’s election promises and their effects will certainly be watched by voters and the ‘total opposition; Law and Justice, which will also block the government’s actions. By the end of January, the government must adopt the draft budget for 2024. If it fails to do so, under Polish law the president can call new elections. However, this scenario seems unlikely and the president does not have a veto right in the area of the budget bill. The effectiveness of the inflow of billions of euros of funds from the EU Reconstruction Fund, which the new government has promised to obtain, may also be of great importance in assessing the credibility of the government. In this respect, one should be optimistic, in view of the government’s announcements regarding changes to the judiciary and the current government’s trust and good relations with Brussels.\n\nThe government has also announced that it will take a look at the major projects implemented so far by its predecessors, such as the Central Communication Port, but also at arms expenditure. Some modifications on these issues can be expected once the audits are completed.\n\nMunicipal and European Parliament elections\n\nThe year 2024 marks the continuation of the election marathon in Poland. There will be local government elections in April and elections to the European Parliament in June. These will be tests for the current government and for the strength of the opposition PiS. Traditionally, PiS has fared less well in local government elections, while the main opposition party Civic Coalition, which is currently the largest party in the current government, has fared better. Currently, PiS rules in a minority of local governments in Poland. It can be predicted that, with the current mood and trends, the local elections will see a stronger consolidation of the parties forming the government and a widening of this difference of influence in local government in favour of the current ruling parties. In the European Parliament elections, too, the formation of a common bloc of parties forming the current government should be anticipated, which may help to win against PiS. However, naming a winner for these elections is much more difficult, due to their specifics (e.g. much lower turnout) and subject matter. In the 2019 European Parliament elections, PiS defeated the united opposition parties that make up the current government, running on a single list. However, a different socio-political atmosphere prevailed then. The local and European elections will certainly be a test of the strength of the opposition PiS and Jarosław Kaczyński’s party leadership.\n\nThe candidates of the main parties in the presidential election will be important. PiS does not currently have a clear-cut candidate. The government camp, on the other hand, has at least two of them. One is Rafał Trzaskowski – mayor of Warsaw, deputy head of the Civic Coalition and candidate for the 2020 presidential election, when he narrowly lost to President Andrzej Duda. The second potential candidate (although has not officially confirmed this yet, but it is being talked about) is Szymon Holownia, Speaker of the Sejm, leader of Szymon Holownia’s Poland2050 grouping and former TV presenter. His prestigious and prominent position as Speaker of the Sejm, his more centrist views on moral issues than the centre-left Trzaskowski, and his growing popularity and public trust may be, as many commentators point out, his trump card.\n\nThe role of the President and the future of Law & Justice (PiS)\n\nOnce the new government is in power, there is a so-called cohabitation in Poland, i.e. a situation in which the prime minister and the president come from different political formations. In the current set-up in Poland, this is bound to generate enormous tensions and constrain government action. It seems that President Andrzej Duda will play the role of representing the interests of the opposition Law and Justice (PiS) and block legislative initiatives of the government. In foreign policy, however, a fundamental consensus is possible. The Office of the President may also be the place where a new centre will be formed as the key centre of the anti-government opposition and the formation of a new political form of Law and Justice. After Donald Tusk’s government took power, the newly appointed head of President Andrzej Duda’s Cabinet, Marcin Mastalerek, stated that the current leader of Law and Justice, Jarosław Kaczyński, should resign. This was an opinion unique in the party’s circles.\n\nOptimistic GDP growth and inflation forecasts\n\nIn contrast to the political forecasts, which point to enormous tensions, polarisation and political conflict, Poland’s economic forecasts for 2024 appear optimistic. The World Bank maintained its forecast for Poland’s GDP growth in 2024 at 2.6 per cent (in 2023 it was 0.3 per cent, which is close to the average for the 27 EU countries ), and for 2025 raised its estimate of GDP growth to 3.4 per cent from 3.2 per cent.[i] The projected GDP growth in Poland will therefore be higher than in Western European countries. In turn, according to the Polish Economic Institute (PIE), Poland’s economic growth in 2024 should oscillate around 2.3 per cent of GDP. [ii] Head of PIE’s macroeconomics team Jakub Rybacki points out that “the main driver of growth will be household consumption, while the new year will bring minor perturbations in investment”.\n\nPoland’s GDP growth forecasts were also presented by the European Commission. According to the EC, Poland’s GDP growth rate will accelerate to 2.7 per cent in 2024, with private consumption expected to remain the main driver of growth, supported by rising real wages, social transfers and declining inflation. Economic activity is also supported by buoyant investment, with continued high corporate profitability and the culmination of the inflow of EU funds in the final year of the perspective,” – they write. Among the risks to the forecasts, the EC cites stubborn inflation in an environment of monetary easing, a slower start of EU investment from the new perspective and delays in the implementation of NIP (National Investment Plan) projects.[iii] “\n\nInflation is expected to fall next year. “Its average value in Poland in 2023 will be 11.6 per cent (in the EU as a whole, it is projected to be around 6.5 per cent. [iv].) In 2024, the rate of price growth will fall to 5.1 per cent. In parallel, the double-digit rate of wage growth will be maintained, reaching 10.3 per cent in 2024.” – calculates the institute PIE. The level of inflation in Poland in 2023 was, after Hungary and the Czech Republic, the highest in the European Union. In 2024, Poland may have the highest inflation level in the European Union, despite a much lower inflation level forecast than in 2023. [v] The Polish Economic Institute indicates that in 2023, inflation fell from 18.6 per cent in February to 6.5 per cent in November. This trend – according to the Institute – will continue in 2024, although no longer at such a steep pace. “We forecast that inflation will average 5.1 per cent in 2024, which is little change from current performance. The problem will be the stickiness of core inflation (the kind that sticks to citizens) and the increases in energy prices in the second half of the year. Against this backdrop, food prices will rise slightly, while fuel prices will fall,” it was pointed out. Increased levels of inflation in the 2nd half of the year may be influenced by the government’s announced move away from zero-rated VAT on food and a possible move away from energy price subsidies.\n\nThe European Commission forecasts that inflation in Poland in 2023 is expected to be 11.1 per cent year-on-year, in 2024. 6.2 per cent, and in 2025. 3.8 per cent. – Inflation is expected to decline from 2023 onwards, but the withdrawal of anti-inflationary measures and strong wage growth are expected to make this a gradual process. Public spending is projected to remain high due to planned investments in defence and social spending, which will slow down the rebalancing of the general government budget, the EC predicts. [vi] The forecast for Poland is worse than, for example, Hungary, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Lithuania or Croatia.\n\nPurchasing power will increase\n\nAs for the purchasing power of Polish consumers – according to PIE – it will grow. Wages are also rising – in the fourth quarter of 2023 they were around 11 per cent higher than a year earlier, while inflation fell to 6.5 per cent. “Such a difference has so far tended to appear only in periods of consumer boom – today it represents a catch-up from last year. Nevertheless, the rate of wage growth will slow down. The results of economic surveys signal lower wage pressure. Fewer and fewer companies surveyed by the National Bank of Poland are announcing wage increases – the percentage fell from 43.1 per cent to 37.6 per cent in Q4 2023.” – added.[vii] The high rate of wage growth will also be linked to administrative decisions. In January this year, the minimum wage increased by 22 per cent compared to 2023 . There will also be significant increases announced in education and the budgetary sphere.\n\nBudget for 2024 with a higher deficyt\n\nDonald Tusk’s government presented a new draft state budget for 2024 in January. This is not a fully ‘authored’ budget by the new Finance Minister Andrzej Domański, but is based on the draft presented in September by the government of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. According to the updated provisions, the state budget deficit is to amount to around euro 42.7 billion against the previously assumed euro 38 billion, an increase of more than euro 4.4 billion. Expenditure is to amount to around euro 201 billion (previously assumed to be nearly euro 4 billion less), and revenue to be around euro 159 billion (originally expected to be around euro 700 million higher).[viii]\n\nAccording to the new draft budget bill, the deficit of the public finance sector (general government, the broader term used by the EU, which also takes into account, among other things, the aforementioned covidium fund) is expected to reach 5.1 per cent of GDP in 2024, compared to the previously assumed 4.5 per cent of GDP. This would represent a slight decrease from around 5.6 per cent in 2023 and a large increase on 2022 and 2021, when it was 3.7 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise to 54.2 per cent, slightly higher than the originally estimated 53.9 per cent. Although this is still one of the lower levels in the EU and quite a lot lower than the average in the Community countries, the annual increase is substantial: almost 5 percentage points.\n\nEuropean Commission analysts forecast the general government deficit (gg). in 2023 at -5.8 per cent of GDP, at -4.6 per cent in 2024 and at -3.9 per cent in 2025. – stated in the latest EC forecasts. Poland’s public debt, according to the EC, is expected to rise to 56.2 per cent of GDP from 50.9 per cent in 2023. – In 2024, the gg deficit, according to the forecast, is expected to fall to 4.6 per cent of GDP (from 5.8 per cent – ed.), supported by an increase in budget revenues with economic recovery. The phasing out of most energy market shelter measures (to 0.4 per cent of GDP) will reduce spending. At the same time, other spending will remain at a high level, as in previous years, especially in view of rising pensions and salaries, the analysis reads.[ix]\n\nThe new government will therefore face a major challenge. For inflation will remain at a stubborn level for the next year. The obstacles to combating it will mainly be wage growth and the potential reduction of some anti-inflationary targets. Public spending, on the other hand, will have to remain high. Simultaneous implementation of election promises may therefore be difficult. This is indicated by the scale of the deficit.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe year 2024 in Polish public life will be a year of confrontation, political tensions and deepening of the extreme polarisation of the Polish political scene into a camp supporting the new government and the media and institutions that support it, and an alternative camp supporting the United Right and the media and institutions that support it. The government coalition will work towards seizing total and real power in the state and over its institutions, as well as reversing the changes introduced by its predecessors, primarily in the area of the media and the judiciary. The opposition, on the other hand, in the direction of weakening and blocking the government’s actions, maintaining its influence in state institutions and building a mass social protest movement against the government. This situation will be reinforced by this year’s presidential and local elections.\n\nPoland’s economic forecasts look optimistic. According to them, Poland will grow noticeably faster than other EU economies in 2024, it will also have almost twice as low inflation as in 2023, but in terms of its level it may remain the infamous leader in Europe.\n\n[i] The economic portal Bankier.pl https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Bank-Swiatowy-podtrzymuje-prognoze-wzrostu-PKB-Polski-w-2024-na-poziomie-2-6-proc-8675877.html\n\n[ii] The economic portal Forsal.pl https://forsal.pl/gospodarka/pkb/artykuly/9386422,o-ile-urosnie-polska-gospodarka-nowa-prognoza-na-2024-rok.html\n\n[iii] The economic portal Money.pl https://www.money.pl/gospodarka/nowe-prognozy-komisji-europejskiej-dla-polski-nastepny-rzad-stanie-przed-wielkim-wyzwaniem-6963380749150912a.html\n\n[iv] The Deutsche Welle television portal https://www.dw.com/pl/ue-polska-z-najwy%C5%BCsz%C4%85-inflacj%C4%85-w-2024-roku/a-67409123\n\n[v] Ibidem\n\n[vi] The economic portal Money.pl https://www.money.pl/gospodarka/nowe-prognozy-komisji-europejskiej-dla-polski-nastepny-rzad-stanie-przed-wielkim-wyzwaniem-6963380749150912a.html\n\n[vii] The economic portal Forsal.pl https://forsal.pl/gospodarka/pkb/artykuly/9386422,o-ile-urosnie-polska-gospodarka-nowa-prognoza-na-2024-rok.html\n\n[viii] The economic portal BusinessInsider.pl https://businessinsider.com.pl/gospodarka/budzet-na-2024-r-tusk-balansuje-miedzy-obietnicami-wyborczymi-a-realiami-rynkowymi/5pmr44m"
