The party's potential coalition partner the far-right Confederation, was given only 12 seats by the Ipsos exit poll.\n\nThat is too few for a governing majority.\n\n\"I have never been so happy about second place.

The exit poll put the turnout at 72.9%.\n\nThe head of the national election commission, Sylwester Marciniak, told reporters at a news conference that the \"turnout is probably the highest in the history of the third Republic.\"\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4XYzY\n\nSkip next section Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also declares victory, as did Tusk\n\n10/15/2023October 15, 2023\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also declares victory, as did Tusk\n\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said his ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS) won the parliamentary election.\n\n\"We won. Law and Justice (PiS) is the winner of the 2023 parliamentary election,\" he said on social media.\n\nHowever, Morawiecki did not specify that he thought his party could form a government. He might have been referring only to PiS clearly being the largest party.\n\nPiS' leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, told supporters at party HQ that while almost 37% of the vote was a great success, it might not suffice to hold power.\n\n\"The question before us is whether this success will be able to be turned into another term of office of our government, and we don't know that yet,\" Kaczynski said.\n\n\"But we must have hope and we must also know that regardless of whether we are in power or in the opposition, we will implement this project in different ways,\" he said.\n\nAt roughly the same time, at the Civic Coalition headquarters, opposition leader Donald Tusk said three opposition parties had enough votes to win the general election.\n\n\"Democracy has won... This is the end of the PiS government,\" he said.\n\nThree opposition parties, Civic Coalition, Third Way and the New Left, ran on separate tickets but with comparable promises of seeking to oust Law and Justice and restore good ties with the EU.\n\nIt's not clear all three parties are willing to ally. Exit polls do suggest it's likely they would have a small majority if they did — but even those figures are still subject to change.\n\nVotes were still being counted and the state electoral commission says it expects to have final results by Tuesday morning.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4XYxu\n\nSkip next section Polls close, opposition claims victory amid tight race\n\n10/15/2023October 15, 2023\n\nPolls close, opposition claims victory amid tight race\n\nIt's 9 p.m. in Poland, meaning polls are closing and exit polls are out.\n\nThe picture is not yet clear, to put it mildly.\n\nThe ruling PiS party is set to emerge as the largest, unsurprisingly, but its projected 36.8% of the vote and roughly 200 seats is far short of what's needed to form a government by itself.\n\nPiS' leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, said on seeing the exit polls that it was not yet clear if his party could claim a third term or not.\n\nThe leader of the largest opposition group, Donald Tusk, said he believed his party and its allies had enough votes to form a government in PiS's place.\n\n\"I am the happiest man on earth,\" Tusk said. \"Democracy has won. Poland has won.\"\n\nTusk's Civic Coalition (KO in Polish initials in the graphic above) is a fairly distant second on 31.6% support, but it might have an easier time striking alliances with the centrist Third Way alliance, projected to win around 13%. The socialist New Left group was polling at 8.6%.\n\nCombining these three groups, which all campaigned on a platform of ousting PiS and fostering closer EU ties, would as it stands give them a parliamentary majority. Exit polls put all three combined on a projected 248 seats, with 231 needed for a majority.\n\nBut even small changes as the votes are counted could potentially alter what's looking like a complex calculus at present.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4XYx0\n\nSkip next section Bomb threats reported at three polling stations, police say\n\n10/15/2023October 15, 2023\n\nBomb threats reported at three polling stations, police say\n\nA number of people were evacuated from at least three polling stations over bomb threats on Sunday, Reuters news agency reported quoting a police spokesperson.\n\n\"About 200 people were evacuated from three polling stations, bomb disposal experts were called and the incident is ongoing,\" police spokesperson Sylwester Marczak said.\n\nThe press office of Poland's electoral commission said it did not have any information regarding whether the incident would have an impact on the voting processes, for instance with some polling booths potentially staying open later.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4XYv3\n\nSkip next section What to watch for as polls close\n\n10/15/2023October 15, 2023\n\nWhat to watch for as polls close\n\nIf all's on schedule, voting should wrap up in all or most of the country about an hour from now, with first exit polls coming soon after that.\n\nBased on polling before the vote, here are the main trends you should be watching for.\n\nPiS is likely to remain the largest party, but unless it outperforms expectations, it's also likely to lose its outright majority in parliament.\n\nThe magic number is 231 seats, of the 460 in total, and PiS only just cleared the hurdle in 2019 with 235. Unless they can secure 231 this evening, some kind of change in Poland's leadership — most likely PiS having to seek a coalition partner or partners — will follow.\n\nThe main opposition alliance, the Civic Coalition, is not necessarily in line to make gains on its 2019 performance and doesn't appear able to mount a serious challenge to PiS, unless voters have a change of heart on polling day.\n\nThen the smaller party to keep a close eye on is called Confederation. It is to the right of the already conservative and Catholic PiS, and in terms of domestic politics, it's probably PiS' most natural coalition ally candidate.\n\nHowever, Confederation has run on a platform highly skeptical and critical of the government in Warsaw's support for Ukraine since Russia's invasion, which could make an alliance complex, also for Kyiv. Confederation is expected to win only around 1 vote in 10, but just a small number of seats might suffice to help PiS past the decisive 231 marker.\n\nSocialist party The Left and another coalition, called Third Way, are also both likely to score support more or less comparable to that of Confederation.\n\nIt is however worth noting that different polls' results varied quite markedly in the run-up to voting. Two of the latest, published on the same day, disagreed by more than 5% of the vote when it came to PiS' likely share of support, just to take one example.\n\nSo the exit polls will probably be a more reliable indicator later on.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4XYky\n\nSkip next section Voter opinion: 'We are already better off than before'\n\n10/15/2023October 15, 2023\n\nVoter opinion: 'We are already better off than before'\n\nBarbara Goden, a pensioner who's supporting the ruling Law and Justice Party, told DW she was happy with that they have done for elderly Poles.\n\n\"I hope our situation will improve because we are already better off than before. As pensioners, we receive two extra payments a year. Some medicine is free. This is a big plus for us.\"\n\nTherefore, she would like to see the current government re-elected.\n\n\"I hope it will continue the way it has been. So pensioners don't need to choose between spending their pennies either on bread or on medicine. Just so we can age with dignity.\"\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4XYee\n\nSkip next section Voter opinion: 'Eight years of negative experiences'\n\n10/15/2023October 15, 2023\n\nVoter opinion: 'Eight years of negative experiences'\n\nDr. Iwona Hawrukiewicz, who spoke to DW at a polling station in Warsaw, was critical of the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS).\n\n\"We have had eight years of negative experiences,\" she said. \"The current government is trying to take Poland out of the EU, it is unable to adapt to the rest of Europe.\"\n\nShe adds she fears for the future of young people in Poland, saying:\n\n\"Young people will have a hard life. The government has ruined the economy. From the beginning to the end, this government has shown they are unable to manage economic challenges.\"\n\nPiS is seeking a third term in power, and is considered likely to emerge as the largest party. But it is also likely to lose ground compared to its performance in 2019, when it claimed an outright, if narrow, majority in parliament.\n\nhttps://p.dw.com/p/4XYeV\n\nSkip next section Bump in turnout over last election after 5 hours of voting\n\n10/15/2023October 15, 2023\n\nBump in turnout over last election after 5 hours of voting\n\nFive hours into the election, at midday local time, Poland's National Electoral Commission said that voter turnout was almost 23%.\n\nThis is higher than the turnout at the same stage in the last parliamentary election in 2019, which was 18%.\n\nMonika, a young mother who only wants to be identified by her first name, told DW: \"I hope this time more Poles will cast their vote than in the past.
