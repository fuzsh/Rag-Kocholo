        "meta_description": "This chapter examines Law and Justice’s popularity with the Polish people. Despite failing to fulfil many of its political objectives, the government has been able to maintain a reasonably consistent level of popular support. Why is this? One reason is that Jarosław Kaczyński has proved to be a flexible and pragmatic leader, ready to change tactics and retreat from policies that prove unpopular. Nonetheless, he would not have been able to sustain public approval if not for the “shield” provided by government-controlled mass media. Also crucial has been Law and Justice’s social spending plan, which they point to as proof of their distance from their predecessors, who promised much but supposedly did not deliver. It helps, too that until the COVID-19 recession, the Polish economy remained strong, disproving predictions that Law and Justice would ruin the country’s finances. Lastly, Law and Justice has waged a cultural war around dignity politics, telling Poles that they should be proud of their past. The Holocaust is a major topic of discussion, with Law and Justice insisting that the Polish people bear no responsibility for what happened in their lands.",
