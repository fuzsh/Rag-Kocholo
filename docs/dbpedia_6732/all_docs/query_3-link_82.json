        "text": "Admission criteria are established by both the Graduate College and by the graduate program.\n\nIowa State requires a bachelor’s or higher degree from a regionally-accredited college or university prior to beginning graduate studies. Because holding a degree from a regionally accredited institution is a fundamental requirement for graduate study at Iowa State University, no appeals to waive this requirement are considered.\n\nInternational degrees must be comparable to a US bachelor’s degree or higher from a college or university regionally accredited/recognized by the Ministry of Education in that country.\n\n3-year degrees from India, Bangladesh, Canada (excluding Quebec), Nepal, and Pakistan are not accepted. 3-year degrees from other countries are reviewed on an individual basis.\n\nA minimum cumulative grade point average equivalent to at least a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale (B grade) is required for admission.\n\nThe English proficiency requirements of the Graduate College and the graduate program to which you have applied must both be met prior to enrollment.\n\nThere is no university-wide requirement that graduate applicants submit results from the Graduate Records Examination (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT); however, most programs do require one or the other.\n\nIowa State University’s Graduate College has made the use of a pre-application available to graduate departments. Some departments have chosen to require or optionally use this pre-application. The pre-application is free, does not require letters of recommendation or most other documents, and consists of only a subset of the primary application questions, enough information for departments to make a recommendation on the applicant based on academics.\n\nStarting an application or pre-application is the same no matter which method the department(s) use. Applicants who apply using the pre-application, should hear something from their department within a few weeks. If approved to move on to phase 2, applicants will then be asked to provide the remaining application requirements, documentation, letters of recommendation, and pay the application fee.\n\nDeadlines are set by and vary by graduate programs. Deadlines represent the endpoint in the application process (i.e., the final completion of your file) rather than the beginning of that process. All materials with the exception of examination results should be received by the program deadline for timely consideration. Graduate programs vary in their willingness to consider late applications.\n\nThe US Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) gives enrolled students the right to view the contents of their application files. It is common practice to ask applicants for admission to sign a voluntary waiver of the right to see their letters of recommendation.\n\nIt is not uncommon for recommenders to refuse to write a letter of recommendation unless they have assurance that their letter will be kept confidential. So if you indicate you do not waive your right, we encourage you to contact your recommenders and see if they will still write a letter of recommendation, because once you make your selection and submit your application, you may not change your response to that question.\n\nEmail Requests for Letters of Recommendation\n\nOccasionally, a recommender will indicate they have not received our email notification with the link to the LOR form. In that event, please check that you entered their email address accurately on the application. If not, you may edit the information on the application and send a reminder to the new address. If it was entered correctly, the email may have been intercepted by the recommender’s SPAM filter. Please ask them to check their SPAM folder for the message. As a last resort, they could provide you with an alternative email address, or submit the PDF LOR provided on our website (instructions below).\n\nManaging Your Online LORs\n\nIowa State’s online application system allows you to track when your online LORs are submitted, as well as change recommenders, edit email addresses, and send reminders to your recommenders.\n\nTo do so, go to Graduate Apply, and click on “Apply” (as if you are going to fill in another application). The Log In page will appear where you can reenter your User Name and Password to sign in. Click “Manage Documents” and you will be able to see and track the status of any online LOR. The following options are offered:\n\nCancel: If a recommender has not completed the letter, you may cancel the letter request. You will be returned to the Manage Documents page and allowed to add a new recommender name and email.\n\nResend: If you would like to send a reminder, select Resend Email, and a new request will be sent to the recommender.\n\nEdit: If you made an error in the email address of a recommender, or if the recommender has now chosen to send a paper letter of recommendation, you may edit that information.\n\nAdd New Recommender: This will allow you to send a letter of recommendation request to a new individual not listed on the original application for admission.\n\nPDF Letters of Recommendation\n\nIf a recommender does not wish to submit a LOR online, or has difficulty doing so, please follow these instructions:\n\nDownload the PDF copy of the Letter of Recommendation form, complete Sections 1 and 3, and save the completed form.\n\nSend the form to your recommender. You must include the postal address and/or email address of the program to which you have applied so your recommender will know where to send the form once completed. (You will find contact information on the Program Requirementswebpage.)\n\nPlease be aware that only online recommendation letters are tracked on the Online Application System. You will not be able to track LORs that are submitted by email or sent by post. Those should be sent directly to the graduate program to which you apply. LORs should not be sent to the Office of Admissions.\n\nIt is always our pleasure to assist students in their application process; however, we do ask that students read all instructions carefully before contacting us, as answers to your questions may have already been addressed. You can also check out our Graduate FAQ.\n\nIn order to better serve you, please also note below which office should be contacted regarding application issues:\n\nOffice of Admissions Graduate Program Application fees Application deadline Online application form Letters of recommendation Uploading documents GRE/GMAT examinations English proficiency exams Admissions/denial decisions Academic records/degrees Assistantship decisions Visa forms\n\nExpress mail requests\n\nContact the Office of Admissions\n\nMailing address:\n\nOffice of Admissions\n\n100 Enrollment Services Center\n\n2433 Union Drive\n\nIowa State University\n\nAmes, IA 50011-2042\n\nUSA\n\nTel: 1 515 294-5836\n\nFax: 1 515 294-2592\n\nEmail: admissions@iastate.edu\n\nAdmission criteria are established by both the Graduate College and by the graduate program.\n\nIowa State requires a bachelor’s or higher degree from a regionally-accredited college or university prior to beginning graduate studies. Because holding a degree from a regionally accredited institution is a fundamental requirement for graduate study at Iowa State University, no appeals to waive this requirement are considered.\n\nInternational degrees must be comparable to a US bachelor’s degree or higher from a college or university regionally accredited/recognized by the Ministry of Education in that country.\n\n3-year degrees from India, Bangladesh, Canada (excluding Quebec), Nepal, and Pakistan are not accepted. 3-year degrees from other countries are reviewed on an individual basis.\n\nA minimum cumulative grade point average equivalent to at least a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale (B grade) is required for admission.\n\nThe English proficiency requirements of the Graduate College and the graduate program to which you have applied must both be met prior to enrollment.\n\nThere is no university-wide requirement that graduate applicants submit results from the Graduate Records Examination (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT); however, most programs do require one or the other.\n\nThe nonrefundable application fee for domestic students (US citizens, US permanent residents, refugees, asylees, DACA or undocumented) is $60.\n\nMultiple programs\n\nIf you wish to apply to multiple programs, you will incur multiple nonrefundable application fee charges (e.g., $120 for two domestic applications, $180 for three domestic applications). You will not need to submit multiple copies of your supporting application materials, as those will be made available to all programs to which you apply. Please note, however, that the programs will be informed that you are applying to multiple programs.\n\nFee waivers\n\nThe only fee waivers offered are to McNair Scholars. U.S. military veterans and those currently serving will have their application fee deferred until they enroll.\n\nName\n\nIf variations of your name will appear on examination score reports or academic records, please provide those variations in the space provided. If you have only one name, please enter it in the last name or surname field\n\nUniversities attended\n\nPlease list your most recent university first, including the one you are currently attending.\n\nGrade Point Average (GPA\n\nOn the application, you are asked to provide your cumulative GPA at the undergraduate level (and graduate if appropriate). You should use the grading system used at your institution, and provide the maximum attainable score as well. For example, for U.S. schools, one would write “3.0/4.0.” Students graded on percentage systems might write 80/100%. Examples of other systems include: 2nd Class Upper/1st Division; 7/10; 13/20, etc.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe Statement of Purpose is part of the actual application form. There is a strict limit of 500 words, so we encourage you to be succinct. Once submitted, no changes can be made, so please proofread your statement (as well as all other entries) carefully before submitting your application. You can either add your statement of purpose in the field provided on the application form, or upload it as a PDF. Please choose one option, not both.\n\nOnline recommendations\n\nIowa State University prefers that you use the online letter of recommendation process. By including your recommenders’ names and email addresses on the application form, they will be sent an email with a link to our online Letter of Recommendation form after you submit your application. Emails to your recommenders will not be sent until you pay the application fee and submit your application. More details are provided in the Letter of Recommendation section of these instructions.\n\nPrevious Iowa State graduate students\n\nIf you were previously enrolled at Iowa State as a degree-seeking graduate in the last five years, you do not need to apply again. Contact your major professor to select courses and obtain registration information. If you were last enrolled as a degree-seeking graduate longer than five years ago, you should submit the Reinstatement to Active Status form and gain the written approval of a graduate program and the Graduate College.\n\nFor the purpose of applying to Iowa State, English may be considered your primary language if you have been raised in an environment where English is the only official language of your locality and nation, and English is the language used in your home. If your primary language is not English, you must meet the university’s English proficiency requirement in one of the following ways:\n\nEarn a bachelor’s or higher degree from a country where English is the only official language.\n\nSubmit official results from one of the following exams. The minimum requirements of both the Graduate College and the graduate program to which you are applying must be met. The minimum scores accepted by the Graduate College are:\n\nInternet Based TOEFL (iBT) 79\n\nOfficial TOEFL exam results must be sent directly from the Educational Testing Service to Iowa State electronically. Our School Code is 6306.\n\nIELTS 6.5\n\nThe IELTS testing agency should send electronically, or mail official results to the Office of Admissions, Iowa State University, 100 Enrollment Services Center, 2433 Union Drive, Ames, IA 50011-2011.\n\nPearson Test of English (PTE) 53\n\nDuoLingo English Test 105 (approved through spring 2025 semester)\n\nHave results sent electronically directly to Iowa State University-All Graduate programs.\n\nAll examinations should be taken at least six weeks prior to the graduate program’s application deadline to ensure timely receipt and processing of results. Test results must be sent directly from the testing agency to our institution to be considered official.\n\nPlease upload copies of any examination results you have at the time you apply as they may help the university locate your official test scores when your application is processed.\n\nGraduate Records Examination (GRE)\n\nMost programs do not enforce strict cut-off scores. Rather, they review an applicant’s complete application package and credentials before making a decision. Official GRE results are sent electronically by the Educational Testing Service. Our School Code is 6306. No Department Codes are required.\n\nGraduate Management Aptitude Test (GMAT)\n\nThe GMAT is accepted or required of applicants to business-related programs. Please check the Program Requirements page to determine if your program of choice requires it.\n\nWe allow students to upload official copies of academic records for the purposes of application review. Only if you are offered admission to Iowa State will you be required to submit official academic records. See more information about this in the Uploading Documents section.\n\nAcademic records are called different names in different countries. In the US, we call them official “transcripts.” Records bearing the original stamp or seal of the school official responsible for issuing such records (the registrar, principal, controller of exams, etc.) are considered “official.” Records certified by lecturers, professors, or any other school officials who do not hold primary responsibility for maintaining the academic records of the institution are not official. Academic records printed from a school’s website are also not accepted.\n\nTranslations\n\nAcademic records should be in the official language of the country in which they were earned. If that is not English, an English language translation should be uploaded in addition to the official foreign language academic record. We will accept literal (not interpretative) English translations from any qualified translator.\n\nPrevious Iowa State students\n\nIf you were previously enrolled at Iowa State, you do not need to request your Iowa State transcripts; the Office of Admissions will obtain them directly.\n\nIn order to save you the time, effort, and expense of mailing supplemental application materials such as academic records, departmental forms, and resumes, we allow you to upload your supplemental materials at the time that you apply. Uploaded materials will be used to make the admissions decision. Only if you are offered admission to Iowa State will you be required to submit official academic records.\n\nDocuments may be uploaded at the same time that you submit your online application, or at a later date if necessary. The following are required:\n\nScanned copies of official academic records and degree statements issued by any institution where you earned (or will earn) a bachelor’s, and any institution attended after that (e.g., graduate work, etc.) Do not scan web-based transcripts or grade reports.\n\nStudent copies of your examination results (GRE, GMAT, etc.)\n\nAny supplemental forms or materials required by the graduate program as indicated in the Program Requirements.\n\nPlease do not upload the following:\n\nUndergraduate records of only one semester enrollment or 15 credits or less\n\nSecondary and/or pre-university records\n\nMerit certificates or certificates of participation\n\nWeb-based advising reports or online transcripts\n\nTranscripts labeled “unofficial” or “grade report”\n\nCredential evaluations (ie, WES, ECE, etc.)\n\nTheses or dissertations\n\nScanning tips\n\nSave your documents as a PDF files. We will not accept TIFF, JPEG, or Word files.\n\nIf you have received an electronic transcript from your school, be aware that it is encrypted, and cannot be uploaded directly to our site. You must first must download it, print it, and then scan it before uploading to our application.\n\nIf scanning transcripts from multiple schools, scan them as individual files.\n\nIf your academic record includes a legend or key which provides information on the university grading scale, please include ONE copy of that page.\n\nScan the document at the lowest resolution possible to produce a legible document (maximum 300 dpi). The file size cannot exceed 3MB (3,000 KB).\n\nIf the scanned file is still too large, make a photocopy of the document and then scan the photocopy.\n\nPlease review the image after scanning to ensure it is legible. If it is not, delete it, and experiment with different scanner settings until you find one that results in a legible document.\n\nManaging your documents\n\nA list of the unofficial documents attached to your application can be found in this section of the Online Application System. You can also upload new documents that you did not have available when you submitted your application. Just remember that documents must be in PDF format and each document must not exceed 3 MB.\n\nDifficulty in uploading/scanning\n\nWe understand that not all applicants have the ability to prepare scanned legible documents for upload to the online application system. Your application will receive full consideration as long as your official transcripts are in the Office of Admissions by the appropriate deadline.\n\nImportant Note: Iowa State reserves the right to rescind any offer of admission if any discrepancies are found between your uploaded and official academic records and test scores, if altered or forged records are submitted, and if any essay, personal statement, or other supplemental materials include plagiarized information. If this information is discovered after matriculation at the institution, disciplinary action may be taken up to and including dismissal from the university.\n\nUpon receipt of the online application, all required academic records (transcripts), and satisfactory examination results, the Office of Admissions reviews your file for completeness, and makes it available to the graduate program(s) to which you have applied. During our peak review season, this can take up to 3 weeks. If you have not uploaded the required academic records, your file will be marked “Incomplete” and an email will be sent to you informing you that a required academic record is missing.\n\nIf your academic records have been received, the graduate program will then review the rest of your file to determine if all the additional materials they require have been uploaded. Each graduate program has its own processes for file review. Some may notify you when an item is missing; others will not contact you as they consider it the applicant’s responsibility to meet their published requirements.\n\nIf the file is complete, it is made available to the program’s admissions committee for review. Some graduate programs do their review on a rolling basis, and others wait until February or March and review all applicants at the same time. Please contact the graduate program directly for information on when their decisions are usually made.\n\nThe graduate program makes its admission recommendation to the Graduate College for the Dean’s approval and then a final review in the Office of Admissions. Until the Graduate Dean has approved the admission recommendation, and the Office of Admissions has conducted their final review, the program’s decision is unofficial. Once approved by the Dean, the Office of Admissions receives the electronic file for their final review. After the Office of Admissions conducts the final review, formal action is taken.\n\nNotification of admission\n\nSome departments notify the applicant of their recommendation to the Graduate College; others prefer to wait until the Graduate College has approved the decision and formal notification can be sent by the Office of Admissions.\n\nStudents in the United States will receive their admission documents by U.S. mail.\n\nAccepting your offer\n\nYou should contact the admitting department by email, your intent to enroll. The contact information for the department is in the Program Requirements.\n\nIf you are approved by the Graduate Dean for admission to the university, you will be instructed to send hard copies of your official final academic records and degree statements. Documents you uploaded at time of application are not considered official.\n\nPaper copies mail to:\n\nOffice of Admissions\n\n100 Enrollment Services Center\n\n2433 Union Drive\n\nIowa State University\n\nAmes, IA 50011-2011\n\nElectronic transcripts\n\nIn some cases, Graduate Admissions is able to accept official electronic transcripts sent directly by your institution. If you wish to provide electronic transcripts, have your institution’s Registrar send transcripts/credentials directly to etranscript@iastate.edu through a secure, approved, document-transfer service. Not all institutions offer secure document transfer.\n\nElectronic documents sent as PDF attachments will not be accepted as official.\n\nAll materials submitted in support of your application of admission become the property of Iowa State University and will not be returned in original or copy.\n\nAdmission criteria are established by both the Graduate College and by the graduate program.\n\nIowa State requires a bachelor’s or higher degree from a regionally-accredited college or university prior to beginning graduate studies. Because holding a degree from a regionally accredited institution is a fundamental requirement for graduate study at Iowa State University, no appeals to waive this requirement are considered.\n\nInternational degrees must be comparable to a US bachelor’s degree or higher from a college or university regionally accredited/recognized by the Ministry of Education in that country.\n\n3-year degrees from India, Bangladesh, Canada (excluding Quebec), Nepal, and Pakistan are not accepted. 3-year degrees from other countries are reviewed on an individual basis.\n\nA minimum cumulative grade point average equivalent to at least a 3.0 on a 4.0 scale (B grade) is required for admission.\n\nThe English proficiency requirements of the Graduate College and the graduate program to which you have applied must both be met prior to enrollment.\n\nThere is no university-wide requirement that graduate applicants submit results from the Graduate Records Examination (GRE) or the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT); however, most programs do require one or the other.\n\nOur graduate application form is only available online. The $100 application fee for international students is nonrefundable. If you prefer not to pay the application fee by credit card, you may complete and print the online application, and attach your personal check. All checks should be in US dollars and made payable to Iowa State University.\n\nMultiple programs\n\nIf you wish to apply to multiple programs, you will incur multiple nonrefundable application fee charges (e.g., $200 for two programs; $300 for three programs). You will not need to submit multiple copies of your supporting application materials, as those will be made available to all programs to which you apply.\n\nFee waivers\n\nThe only fee waivers offered are to Vietnam Educational Foundation (VEF) finalists(not semi-finalists). This is accomplished by checking “yes” to the question on the international graduate application asking if you are a VEF Finalist.\n\nName\n\nYour family name (last name or surname) should be entered first. It is important that you use the same spelling and order of your name that appears on your passport. If variations of your name (i.e., maiden name, etc.) will appear on examination score reports or academic records, please provide those variations in the space provided. If you have only one name, please enter it in the last name or surname field.\n\nAddress\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) require that international students requesting a student visa provide a residential address outside the United States. We recommend you avoid using PO Box addresses whenever possible as express mail carriers will not deliver to PO boxes.\n\nUniversities attended\n\nPlease list your most recent university first, including the one you are currently attending. Note for Indian applicants: Please list the university that will award your degree, NOT the affiliated or constituent college in which you are enrolled.\n\nGrade Point Average (GPA)\n\nOn the application, you are asked to provide your cumulative GPA at the undergraduate level (and graduate if appropriate). You should use the grading system used at your institution, and provide the maximum attainable score as well. For example, for U.S. schools, one would write “3.0/4.0.” Students graded on percentage systems might write 80/100%. Examples of other systems include: 2nd Class Upper/1st Division; 7/10; 13/20, etc.\n\nStatement of Purpose\n\nThe Statement of Purpose is part of the actual application form. There is a strict limit of 500 words, so we encourage you to be succinct. You can either add your statement of purpose in the field provided on the application form, or upload it as a PDF. Please choose one option, not both. Once submitted, no changes can be made, so please proofread your statement (as well as all other entries) carefully before submitting your application.\n\nOnline recommendations\n\nIowa State University prefers that you use the online letter of recommendation process. By including your recommenders’ names and email addresses on the application form, they will be sent an email with a link to our online Letter of Recommendation form after you submit your application. Emails to your recommenders will not be sent until you pay the application fee and submit your application. More details are provided in the Letter of Recommendation section of these instructions.\n\nAll examinations should be taken at least six weeks prior to the graduate program’s application deadline to ensure timely receipt and processing of results. Test results must be sent directly from the testing agency to our institution to be considered official.\n\nPlease upload copies of any examination results you have as they may help the university locate your official test scores when your application is processed.\n\nEnglish proficiency\n\nNonnative English speakers must meet the university’s English proficiency requirement in one of the following ways:\n\nSubmit official results from one of the following exams. The minimum requirements of both the Graduate College and the graduate program to which you are applying must be met. The minimum scores accepted by the Graduate College are:\n\nInternet Based TOEFL (iBT) 79\n\nPaper-Based TOEFL (PBT) 550\n\nIELTS 6.5\n\nPearson Test of English (PTE) 53\n\nDuoLingo English Test 105 (approved through spring 2025 semester)\n\nOfficial TOEFL exam results must be sent directly from the Educational Testing Service to Iowa State electronically. Our school code is 6306. Official IELTS and PTE results should be sent directly by the testing agencies to the Office of Admissions, Iowa State University, 100 Enrollment Services Center, 2433 Union Drive, Ames, IA 50011-2011.\n\nEarn a bachelor’s or higher degree from a country where English is the only official language, such as the following. (Complete list available from Admissions.)\n\nAustralia\n\nBahamas\n\nBarbados\n\nBelize\n\nBermuda\n\nCanada (exc. Québec)\n\nDominica\n\nGhana\n\nGrenada\n\nGuyana\n\nIreland\n\nJamaica\n\nLiberia\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNigeria\n\nUganda\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States (exc. PR)\n\nZambia\n\nZimbabwe\n\nGraduate Records Examination (GRE)\n\nMost programs do not enforce strict cut-off scores. Rather, they review an applicant’s complete application package and credentials before making a decision. Official GRE results are sent electronically by the Educational Testing Service. Our school code is 6306. No Department Codes are required, but if you have selected one, it will not impact the delivery of your results.\n\nGraduate Management Aptitude Test (GMAT)\n\nThe GMAT is accepted or required of applicants to business-related programs. Please check the Program Requirements page to determine if your program of choice requires it.\n\nAcademic records are called different names in different countries. In the US, we call them official “transcripts.” In India, the acceptable documents are referred to as “annual marksheets;” in Spanish-language countries, they may be called certificado de studios; in France, relevé de notes. Records bearing the original stamp or seal of the school official responsible for issuing such records (the registrar, principal, controller of exams, etc.) are considered “official.” Records certified by lecturers, professors, or any other school officials who do not hold primary responsibility for maintaining the academic records of the institution are not official. Academic records printed from a school’s website are also not accepted.\n\nApplicants from India\n\nWe require semester or annual marksheets. College-issued transcripts will only be accepted from autonomous colleges. Consolidated mark sheets are not accepted unless all attempts, retakes, and failures are included. When uploading marksheets to your application account, select “Transcripts” not “Exams.”\n\nTranslations\n\nAcademic records should be in the official language of the country in which they were earned. If that is not English, an English language translation should be uploaded in addition to the official foreign language academic record. We will accept literal (not interpretative) English translations from any qualified translator.\n\nPrevious Iowa State students\n\nIf you were previously enrolled at Iowa State, you do not need to request your Iowa State transcripts; the Office of Admissions will obtain them directly.\n\nThis form is required for the purpose of issuing the visa eligibility form (Form I-20). No Form I-20 will be issued until we receive documentation that you have sufficient financial resources to cover your annual expenses.\n\nThe Financial Statement should be uploaded to your application account, not sent by email. While your application will be reviewed without this form, the lack of financial documentation will cause a delay in the issuance of your documents. If you choose to wait until you receive our admission decision before submitting financial information, you will be sent an email detailing what documents are required prior to the issuance of your official admission documents, including your letter and I-20.\n\nConsult the Estimated Annual Expenses for the amount of money a typical student spends in the current academic year at Iowa State. U.S. consular officers typically require that an amount equal to one full year of support be readily available, such as in a bank, and that you have a documented source of support for the following years. For confidentiality purposes, we strongly urge you to cross out the bank account number on any bank documents prior to uploading. If your government or another agency is sponsoring you, the letter of award should include the dollar amount of the scholarship, the number of years it will be provided, and the degree for which the support is given.\n\nGraduate assistantships\n\nGraduate assistantships are awarded on the basis of academic and/or professional excellence. Recipients receive tuition reduction and a stipend (salary) to work approximately 10 or 20 hours per week on assigned professional responsibilities, such as teaching or research. Assistantships do not always cover the full cost of attendance; in those cases, the applicant must cover the remaining costs. We ask that you indicate the maximum amount of funds you can provide for your own support annually on the Financial Statement.\n\nIn order to save you the time, effort, and expense of mailing supplemental application materials such as academic records, departmental forms, and financial documentation, Iowa State encourages you to upload your supplemental materials at the time that you complete your online application for admission.\n\nUploaded materials will be used to make the admissions decision. Only if you are offered admission to Iowa State will you be required to submit official academic records and financial documents. Do not send any hard copy academic records until you have been offered admission and have decided to matriculate.\n\nDocuments may be uploaded at the same time that you submit your online application, or at a later time. The following are required:\n\nScanned copies of official academic records and degree statements issued by any institution where you earned (or will earn) a bachelor’s or comparable undergraduate degree, and any institution attended after that (e.g., graduate work, postgraduate diplomas, etc.)\n\nStudent copies of your examination results (GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS, etc.)\n\nAny supplemental forms or materials required by the graduate program as indicated in the Program Requirements\n\nThe Graduate Financial Statement and supporting bank document.\n\nPlease do not upload the following:\n\nSecondary and/or pre-university records\n\nMerit certificates or certificates of participation\n\nUndergraduate records of only one semester enrollment or 15 credits or less unless taken after your degree\n\nWeb-based advising reports or online transcripts\n\nTranscripts labeled “unofficial”or “grade report”\n\nCredential evaluations (i.e., WES, ECE, etc.)\n\nTheses or dissertations\n\nScanning tips\n\nSave your documents as a PDF files. We will not accept TIFF, JPEG, or Word files.\n\nIf scanning transcripts from multiple schools, scan them as individual files.\n\nWhen scanning an English translation of a foreign language document, scan the English translation first.\n\nEnsure that the institution name and other identifying marks are not missed during the scanning process.\n\nIf your academic record includes a legend or key which provides information on the university grading scale, please include one copy of that page.\n\nScan the document at the lowest resolution possible to produce a legible document (maximum 300 dpi). The file size cannot exceed 3MB (3,000 KB).\n\nIf the scanned file is still too large, make a photocopy of the document and then scan the photocopy.\n\nPlease review the image after scanning to ensure it is legible. If it is not, delete it, and experiment with different scanner settings until you find one that results in a legible document.\n\nManaging your documents\n\nOnce you have submitted your application, a list of the unofficial documents attached to your application can be found in this section of the Online Application System. You can also upload new documents at any time. A link is provided to the Program Requirements page of the program(s) to which you are applying so that you can ensure you submit all required supplemental documents.\n\nDifficulty in uploading/scanning\n\nWe understand that not all applicants have the ability to prepare scanned legible documents for upload to the online application system. Your application will receive full consideration as long as your official transcripts are in the Office of Admissions by the appropriate deadline.\n\nImportant note\n\nIowa State reserves the right to rescind any offer of admission if any discrepancies are found between your uploaded and official academic records and test scores, if altered or forged records are submitted, and if any essay, personal statement, or other supplemental materials include plagiarized information. If this information is discovered after matriculation at the institution, disciplinary action may be taken up to and including dismissal from the university.\n\nUpon receipt of the online application, all required academic records (transcripts), and satisfactory examination results, the Office of Admissions logs in your materials and make them available to the graduate program(s) to which you have applied. If you have not uploaded the required academic records, your file will be marked “Incomplete” and an automated email will be sent to you informing you that a required academic record is missing.\n\nEach graduate program has its own processes for file review. Some may notify you when an item is missing; others consider it the applicant’s responsibility to meet their published requirements, and will not contact you.\n\nSome graduate programs do their review on a rolling basis, and others wait until February or March to begin their review. Please contact the graduate program directly for information on when their decisions are usually made.\n\nThe graduate program makes its admission recommendation to the Graduate College for the Dean’s approval and then a final review in the Office of Admissions. Until the Graduate Dean has approved the admission recommendation, and the Office of Admissions has conducted their final review, the program’s decision is unofficial. Once approved by the Dean, the Office of Admissions receives the electronic file for their final review. After the Office of Admissions conducts the final review, formal action is taken.\n\nSome departments notify the applicant of their recommendation to the Graduate College; others prefer to wait until the Graduate College has approved the decision and formal notification can be sent by the Office of Admissions.\n\nNotification of admission\n\nIf you are approved by the Graduate Dean for admission to the university, the Office of Admissions reviews the following:\n\nIf you will be on an F-1 or J-1 visa, Admissions reviews your financial documents to ensure you have made satisfactory arrangements to cover your educational and living expenses (and those of any family members) for the duration of your program. If not, you will be notified what is missing. If you have sufficient private funds, a full scholarship, or have been given full funding by the graduate program, your file will be released for issuance of the visa eligibility form (I-20 or DS-2019).\n\nYour academic records will be reviewed, and you will be instructed to send hard copies of your official final academic records and degree statements. You should send them to the Office of Admissions at the address at the end of this document.\n\nImportant note:\n\nIf all records are not received by the deadline you are given, your admission maybe cancelled and your I-20 or DS-2019 terminated in the US Student and Exchange Visa Information System (SEVIS).\n\nThe official admission letter (and I-20 Form) will be emailed to international students living abroad. International students living in the U.S. will receive the official admission letter by U.S. Mail.\n\nAll materials submitted in support of your application of admission become the property of Iowa State University and will not be returned in original or copy.\n\nThe official admission letter (and I-20 Form) will be emailed to international students living abroad. International students living in the U.S. will receive the official admission letter by U.S. Mail."
