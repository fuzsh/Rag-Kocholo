        "text": "Dr. Julie Contino is a Senior Specialist in Science and Teacher Education for the American Museum of Natural History Earth Science Residency Program (AMNH ESRP) housed in AMNH’s Richard Gilder Graduate School. She has been a faculty member and participated in the design, development, and implementation of the AMNH ESRP since 2011. This program addresses the shortage of Earth Science teachers in high-need schools by accepting 15-24 residents/pre-service teachers annually to complete a 15-month residency in the Museum and NYS public schools along with 36 credits in science and pedagogy in order to receive NYS Initial Teacher Certification and a Master of Arts in Teaching degree. Dr. Contino advises residents, co-teaches two graduate-level courses, supervises residents in their school placements, and designs and implements professional learning experiences for mentor teachers. Prior to joining AMNH ESRP, she taught high school Earth Science and Living Environment in upstate New York and in New York City, developed and instructed in-person and online science courses for teachers, and supervised secondary and elementary science teachers."
