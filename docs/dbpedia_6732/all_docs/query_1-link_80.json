We carry lab supplies for your physics classroom and chemistry lab, as well as supplies for biology, life science, engineering, and environmental science. Request a catalog!\n\nFor the educational physics lab we invented carts and tracks, which are now standard teaching tools used worldwide. Our technology leadership continues with the award-winning Smart Cart, which removes the wires while providing new ways to study kinematics on and off the track. We also carry just about all laboratory supplies, from rods, clamps, and Ohaus balances to mass and hanger sets and laboratory glassware. See our full offering of lab supplies.\n\nFor the chemistry lab we have the equipment you need: test tubes, ring stands, pH meters, digital microscopes, and much more. We also have test kits for environmental sciences and science kits for electricity, waves, machines, and more."
