        "text": "Prior's motorised linear XY stages, or translation stages, ensure high-precision positioning. Prior offer a choice of robust and reliable stepper motors and high-speed linear motors with different travel ranges and load capacities. Travel ranges are available from 50 to 300 mm with maximum loads from 6 to 100 kg.\n\nCompatible with most microscopes on the market, Prior motorised stages are suitable for a wide range of microscopy and materials science applications, including live cell imaging, physiology, neuroscience and surface testing, profiling and hardness testing. Our linear and stepper motor stages are suitable for all optical microscopy techniques including bright field, fluorescence (widefield and confocal), and electrophysiology.\n\nOrder with confidence: Prior offer a 5-year warranty for all their stages.\n\nStage Details Datasheet H101A\n\n114 mm x 75 mm\n\n+/- 0.7 μm or better repeatability\n\nQuiet and reliable H101A H105F\n\nLarge format flat top motorised stage\n\n154 mm x 154 mm\n\n+/-0.7 μm or better repeatability\n\n<1 μm resolution possible H105F H105\n\nSemiconductor wafer inspection\n\n154 mm x 154 mm\n\n+/-0.7 μm or better repeatability\n\nQuiet and reliable H105 H112\n\nSemiconductor wafer inspection\n\n302 mm x 302 mm\n\n+/-0.7 μm or better repeatability\n\nQuiet and reliable H112 H116\n\nSemicondutor wafer inspection\n\n255 mm x 215 mm\n\n+/-0.7 μm or better repeatability\n\nQuiet and reliable H116 H116SPN\n\nWafer shuttle stage\n\n250 mm x 210 mm\n\nOptical and pressure sensors H116SPN\n\nH138A\n\nExtended X travel to\n\naccommodate 8 slides\n\n240 mm x 71 mm\n\n+/-0.7 μm or better repeatability\n\nQuiet and reliable\n\nH138A HT1111LC\n\nHardness testing stage\n\n108 mm x 108 mm\n\n+/-1.5 μm or better repeatability\n\nEconomic and robust HT1111LC ES111\n\n125 mm x 75 mm\n\n+/-5 μm or better repeatability\n\nEconomic and robust ES111"
