        "text": "Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) is preparing to sell its global headquarters in Natick, Mass., and move 13 miles west to Marlborough, where the company already owns a facility, the medical device giant said Thursday.\n\nThe 500,000 square foot campus in Natick, once home to Carling Brewery and Prime Computers, will be bought by MathWorks, a local software company.\n\nBoston Scientific didnâ€™t disclose the amount of the sale, but the company is listed as the owner of 7 parcels of land valued at about $80.5 million, according to the Town of Natick Assessors office. The company has been at the Natick location since 1995.\n\nSign up to get our free newsletters delivered straight to your inbox\n\nBSX spokesman Steve Campanini told MassDevice that the company will build a new global headquarters in Marlborough, which can accommodate all of the 800 employees currently on the Natick campus. Construction of a new global headquarters is expected to be completed by 2014, but the company will begin transitioning operations next year.\n\nThe company already owns a facility in Marlborough, which will accommodate the new headquarters. That space, which was bought by the company in 2004 for $43.5 million, is located near the intersection of I-290 and I-495, according to a prepared release."
