        "text": "Knowing that the next University of Texas campus would be in San Antonio, university leadership looked for spacious sites that provided plenty of room for future growth. Sites across San Antonio were considered, from the city's south side to the heart of downtown. Eventually leaders chose a 600-acre site at what is now the intersection of Interstate 10 and Highway 1604. Initially surrounded by farmland and fields, UTSA's Main Campus spurred the city's northward economic development progress, and set the stage for other major developments to locate in the area including USAA's headquarters, the medical center and UT Health San Antonio.\n\nIn 1970, campus began to take shape. Lead architect O'Neil Ford created a campus design based on an old European city, with a central plaza and courtyard connected by ‘paseos’ – plazas and walkways for strolling. To help campus architecture blend in with the existing landscape, ‘Texas concrete’ was used, a variation of the building material with a soft beige color. Carefully planned landscaping included live oak trees to shade students in the summer and leaf-shedding red oaks. By 1976, construction of UTSA's Main Campus was complete and Roadrunners had an official home.\n\n1994-2009 Expanding the Nest\n\nBy the 1990's, UTSA had been serving students and the larger San Antonio community for 25 years. With an eye on the next quarter century, UTSA turned its sights on expanding the resources that would accommodate its growing student population and research efforts.\n\nBefore and After\n\nExpanding Downtown\n\nIn 1995, bulldozers started to roll across what would be one of UTSA's largest developments since its founding, a new 18-acre Downtown Campus. The Downtown Campus began as a need to provide an advanced four-year public education institution situated in the heart of San Antonio for the multi-cultural communities of South Texas. The city wanted to offer its urban population an opportunity to fulfill their educational dreams without having to travel outside of Loop 410. To address this absence, Bill Miller Bar-B-Q Enterprises, Inc. bought and gifted property between West Durango Boulevard and Buena Vista Street for the construction of the downtown campus. By 1997, the Downtown Campus officially opened with four academic buildings.\n\nExplore UTSA's downtown presence\n\nRapid Growth Continues\n\nOther facility developments soon emerged, as did Roadrunners' innovative research and educational successes. In 1996, the university's first two PhDs were awarded in biology with a specialty in neurobiology. That same year, the Student Union completed a major expansion, which included a bookstore, student activities complex, and the Retama auditorium.\n\n2009-Present Emerging Leadership\n\nMajor Leaps Forward\n\nThe 2000's â leading up to present day â have been marked by UTSA leadership in research, athletics, and plans for the future. In 2009, the Texas Legislature passed Proposition 4, designating UTSA as an emerging research university and paving the path toward attaining the prestigious Carnegie R1 classification in 2022. Outside the classrooms and labs, UTSA's campus life continued to develop, offering new opportunities for Roadrunners to lead the way. In 2011, UTSA Athletics took a major leap forward when the first Roadrunner football team took to the field, cheered on by a sea of fans wearing orange, blue, and white.\n\nOne of the most recent series of leadership steps taken have revolved around plans for the Downtown Campus. In 2017, the campus celebrated its 20th anniversary in a ceremony overseen by the then newly appointed UTSA President Eighmy. At the event, Eighmy announced a new vision for the future of the Downtown Campus, imagining it as a model urban-serving university and discussing plans to broaden the UTSA Downtown Campus' footprint. In support of this initiative, Graham Weston provided a $15 million gift for construction of a new School of Data Science and National Security Collaboration Center. These facilities now serve as a major connector between the university and the local community."
