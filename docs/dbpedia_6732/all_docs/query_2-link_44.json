        "text": "2024 Science Expo: Physical Science\n\nThe 2024 North Lake Tahoe Science Expo will be held at Incline High School the week of May 20, 2024. The Science Expo is in partnership with local schools to increase science communication and literacy with local high school students and STEM education for local elementary students. The theme for the 2024 Science Expo is Physical Sciences that will include following the themes: Properties of Matter, Energy, and Forces and Motion.\n\nWe are always looking for volunteers to help us teach short science activities to local 3rd-5th grade students, you do not need any prior science experience to volunteer. All materials, training, and supplies will be provided. You can attend an advance training session or simply come a half-hour before the start of your shift to prepare to facilitate your science activity station.\n\nThe annual Science Expo event is designed to increase student excitement and interest in science through interactive, hands-on activities, games and demonstrations. Every Science Expo includes hands-on science activities for upper elementary school students from the greater Lake Tahoe and Truckee Region.\n\nStudent groups come for a two-hour session and interact with 30-40 hands-on science activities within the theme of Physical Science (2024), Earth and Space Science (2025), and Life and Health Science (2026). Themes are on a three-year rotation to ensure that local 3rd–5th grade students who come every year will experience different activities each year. The cost is $5 per student.\n\nUC Davis staff, AmeriCorps members, and volunteers share experiments, activities, and science demonstrations with the students in the community. Other regional partners including local Rotary clubs, Incline Education Fund, and Washoe County School District. Also offer activities, experiments, or demonstrations.\n\nStudents from local school districts will attend during scheduled school visits.\n\nComments from visiting students and teachers:\n\n“The students left with so many discoveries, insights, and questions which has left them on further explorations. Your team is amazing!\" (Jessica, Creekside Charter)\n\n“We're so lucky to have this great resource in our community!” (Patricia Mills, Tahoe Lake Elementary)\n\n\"All excellent! I want to compliment the quality of the stations and presenters!\" (Kathee Hansen, Tahoe Lake Elementary)\n\n\"I had so much fun being a scientist!\" (Julie Otis, Kings Beach Elementary)\n\n\"We debriefed almost a week later and many [students] retained information they learned and/or were able to recall significant facts when reviewing their passports.\" (Susan Earnest, Bijou Community School)\n\n\"I enjoyed learning about our brains, how they work, and how the cells all play a different part in your body.\" (Kings Beach Elementary 3rd grader)\n\n\"My favorite part was the lungs, reptiles, and germs.\" (Creekside Charter 3rd grader)\n\n\"My favorite part was the brain and getting to see and feel them. You Rock. I loved it a lot!\" (Creekside Charter 3rd grader)\n\n“I learned a lot about science, so much that my brain is sore. Just kidding, but really, if my brain could not grow it would be full.” (Summer)\n\n“I learned in ice that when matter changes from a solid directly into a gas it is called sublimation.”\n\n“I enjoyed the experience and the magic of science. It was really awesome!” (Jessica)\n\n“I really felt like a scientist and a nerd at the same time... I had a lot of fun.” (Damen)\n\n“That night I dreamed about being a scientist and being the engineer of the fastest car. That reminds me... I'm a scientist can't you see, the cosmos is my lab for discovery, growing plants, checking out the stars, and I'm the engineer of the fastest cars... Yeah!” (Mckenna)\n\n“I can’t wait until next year. Thanks again for making last Wednesday so much fun.”\n\n“I really appreciate you letting us come. I enjoyed all of the fun science. I learned how science is fun and exciting. I hope I can come back next year.” (Mckayla)\n\n2021 Virtual Science Expo: Earth and Space Science\n\nThank you to all the classes who joined us for the 2021 Virtual Science Expo this year. It was a great success! If you missed it, we have a recorded session available on our YouTube Channel (https://youtu.be/KuX3eMMN0X8).\n\nTeacher Materials (2019/2024 - Physical Science)\n\nPhysical Science Expo Passport\n\nPhysical Science Expo Passport Answer Key\n\nPhysical Science Expo Brief Activity Descriptions\n\nPhysical Science Expo Detailed Activity Descriptions\n\nNGSS alignment for the 2019 Science Expo Activities\n\nTeacher Materials (2023 - Health & Life Science)\n\nHealth & Life Science Expo Passport (blank)\n\nHealth & Life Science Expo Passport Answer Key\n\nHealth & Life Science Expo Brief Activity Descriptions\n\nHealth & Life Science Expo Detailed Activity Descriptions\n\nNGSS alignment for the 2018 Science Expo Activities\n\nTeacher Materials (2022 - Earth & Space Science)\n\n2022 Earth & Space Science Expo Passport\n\n2022 Earth & Space Science Expo Passport Answer Key\n\n2022 Earth & Space Science Expo Brief Activity Descriptions\n\n2022 Earth & Space Science Expo Detailed Activity Descriptions (complete)\n\nGeology Activities (with links to YouTube TERC videos)\n\nSpace Activities (with links to YouTube TERC videos)\n\nWeather and Climate Activities (with links to YouTube TERC videos)\n\nNGSS for the Science Expo Activities\n\nTeacher Materials (2021 - Best of Science Expo)\n\n2021 Science Expo Passport\n\n2021 Science Expo Passport Answer Key"
