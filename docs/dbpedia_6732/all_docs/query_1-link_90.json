        "text": "Unlock the potential of your microscope system with motorized microscope stages from Prior Scientific\n\nHighly repeatable sample movement & increased throughput\n\nUpgrading a microscope with a motorized stage enhances a microscope’s capability by allowing for rapid, smooth, and highly repeatable sample movement. This can be difficult to achieve or impractical, using a manual stage, especially when the experiment requires the operator to perform repeated, precise, and accurate movements over a long time period. Motorized stages allow the user to pre-program movements, set and save location points for return inspection, and integrate the stage’s positioning within the imaging process. Ultimately, these stages allow for more complex, longer, and more efficient imaging. Upgrading a manual microscope to a fully motorized system with XY and Z automation increases operator efficiency and sample throughput.\n\nAvoid repetitive strain injuries\n\nMany of the tasks performed in laboratories place workers at risk for the development of repetitive strain injuries or musculoskeletal disorders. Motorized stages greatly reduce these types of injuries that are associated with manual stages by automating many of the focus and movement procedures.\n\nCustomizable for a variety of microscopes & applications\n\nPrior offers an extensive product portfolio of stages including stepper, piezo, and linear motor options. These stages are tailored to a variety of applications, from high precision multi-position time-lapse applications to routine scanning. Prior works with microscope manufacturers to ensure all stages will work seamlessly with their microscopes.\n\nIdeal applications for motorized stages:\n\nRoutine and ultra-high precision scanning and processing\n\nPositioning for multiple samples\n\nLive cell imaging\n\nHigh point pressure testing\n\nWafer loading and unloading\n\nExtended depth of field imaging\n\n3D confocal microscopy\n\nContact Prior to learn more about how we can supply a motorized microscope stage for your specific microscope!\n\nLearn more | View Range"
