        "text": "The NYSAA is part of the New York State testing program that measures the attainment of the Stateâ€™s learning standards in the areas of English language arts (ELA), mathematics, and science for students with the most severe cognitive disabilities. Students are assessed annually in ELA and mathematics in grades 3-8 and one time at the secondary level prior to exiting school. Science is assessed annually in grades 5, 8, and once at the secondary level prior to exiting school. NYSAA eligible students are assessed using the Dynamic Learning Maps (DLM) alternate assessment system.\n\nThe DLM alternate assessment system is a computer-delivered adaptive assessment that measures student achievement of the ELA, mathematics, and science standards at a reduced level of depth, breadth, and complexity. This computerized assessment allows for greater student accessibility and provides useful information to help inform instruction."
