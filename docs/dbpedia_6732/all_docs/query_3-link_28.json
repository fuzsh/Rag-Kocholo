Depending on the data, this can include standardizing country names and world region definitions, converting units, calculating derived indicators such as per capita measures, as well as adding or adapting metadata such as the name or the description given to an indicator.\n\nAt the link below you can find a detailed description of the structure of our data pipeline, including links to all the code used to prepare data across Our World in Data."
