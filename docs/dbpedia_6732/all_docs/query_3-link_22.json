        "text": "If eight or more years have passed following the expiration date of your license and you do not presently hold a current and active registered nurse license in another state or U.S. territory, you are required to take and pass the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN) before your license can be reinstated. The NCLEX-RN is required to determine current clinical knowledge and fitness to resume the practice of registered nursing. For information on retaking the NCLEX-RN examination, please visit our 8-Year Retake page.\n\nIf eight or more years have passed following the expiration date of your license and you presently hold a current and active registered nurse license in another state or U.S. territory, you do not have to re-take the NCLEX-RN. For information on how to renew your license, please refer to the 8-Year Renewal section of our website.\n\nTo ensure receipt of important notices, you must notify the Board within 30 days of a change in address of record. Also, please notify the Board immediately of any change in name or email address. Please note that your name must match exactly in all of the following areas:\n\nDocuments on file at the Board\n\nRegistration at Pearson VUE\n\nPersonal official identification\n\nAuthorization to Test (ATT)\n\nPlease refer to our Name/Change in Address of Record page for instructions on submitting your changes to the Board.\n\nEndorsement is the licensure method for registered nurses who hold a current and active license in another state, U.S. territory, or Canada. The endorsement applicant must have passed the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-RN), the State Board Test Pool Examination (SBTPE), or the five-part Canadian examination (prior to 1980). The Canadian Comprehensive Examination is not acceptable. For additional endorsement information, please visit our Licensure by Endorsement page.\n\nIf you have not taken one of these three examinations, you are not eligible for endorsement and must apply for Licensure by Examination.\n\nYou may apply for a temporary license at the same time that you apply for licensure by endorsement or at any time prior to the issuance of a permanent registered nursing license. A temporary license is valid for a period of six months, allowing an applicant to work pending issuance of a permanent RN license. Please visit our Licensure by Endorsement page for application instructions.\n\nThe Board must receive and process fingerprint results from the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) before a temporary license is issued. There may be a delay if the application or fingerprint results indicate a prior conviction(s) or other basis for denial. Please refer to our Processing Times page for current timeframes.\n\nAs of July 1, 2020, applicants will no longer be asked about prior criminal conviction history. Criminal history will be discovered upon receipt of fingerprint results. All applicants with a history of criminal conviction will have their applications referred for an additional Enforcement Division review.\n\nConvictions within seven years from the date of application will receive a full enforcement review. The Board will not take action on any convictions that have been expunged under Penal Code section 1203.4 or dismissed; including expunged convictions within the seven years.\n\nThe Board will not take action on convictions older than seven years, with exceptions. If the applicant was convicted of a serious felony as defined in section 1192.7 of the Penal Code or a crime for which registration is required pursuant to paragraph (2) or (3) of subdivision (d) of section 290 of the Penal Code, the BRN will consider the conviction even if it is more than seven years ago.\n\nThe BRN cannot require an applicant to submit any documentation related to a criminal conviction. However, the BRN will conduct a thorough investigation of criminal convictions prior to making a determination on the application. For this investigation, the BRN will obtain:\n\nCertified copies of Arrest or Investigation Records from the arresting agency (Police, Sheriff, CHP, Campus Police Dept., etc.) For DUIâs, this includes evidence of the blood alcohol content, toxicology report, and Collision Report, if applicable.\n\nCertified copy of court disposition record; usually titled âFinal Minute Orderâ. This court record will show the final conviction charges, the sentencing information, and information showing completion of sentence.\n\nThe Enforcement Division review and decision is dependent on the receipt of records. Depending on the agency, it may take several weeks for the arresting agencies and courts to respond.\n\nIf the conviction has been dismissed or expunged, and the dismissal does not show on the fingerprint results, the applicant shall supply a certified copy of the final court order verifying the dismissal or expungement.\n\nThe Board is responsible for obtaining certified court documents and arrest reports related to your prior conviction sustained within the past seven years from the date of your application. The Board does not require applicants to submit these documents. You may voluntarily provide these documents and upload them to your application.\n\nApplications received with certified arrest and certified court records may have significantly shorter wait times.\n\nThe BRN cannot require the applicant to submit any documentation related to their criminal conviction. However, the applicant may voluntarily submit information in support of their application. The types of information the applicant may voluntarily submit includes:\n\nA detailed description of the circumstances surrounding your conviction(s) or disciplinary action and a thorough description of the rehabilitative changes in your lifestyle since the time of your conviction(s) or disciplinary action which would enable you to avoid future occurrences. It would be helpful to include factors in your life which you feel may have contributed to your conviction(s) or disciplinary action, what you have learned about yourself since that time, and the changes you have made that support your rehabilitation.\n\nEvidence of rehabilitation. Examples of rehabilitation evidence include, but are not limited to:\n\nRecent work performance evaluations\n\nRecent Letters from professionals in the community; for example, AA/NA sponsor, counselor, probation officer, employer, instructor, etc. who can address an awareness of your past misconduct and current rehabilitation; for example, use/non-use of alcohol/drugs. The letters must be signed by the author of the letter and dated within the last year.\n\nIf applicable to your conviction(s) or license discipline, documented evidence of professional treatment and counseling you may have completed. Please provide discharge summary, if available.\n\nLetters of reference on official letterhead from employers, nursing instructors, health professionals, professional counselors, parole or probation officers, or other individuals in positions of authority who are knowledgeable about your rehabilitation efforts.\n\nProof of community work, schooling, and/or self-improvement efforts.\n\nScan your original documents and upload them as attachments to your online application. The scan should be in PDF format, in color, and the certification seal must be fully legible. Scanning and uploading the documents ensures the documents are included with your application, and ensures the documents are ready for review when the Enforcement Division reviews your application. Keep your original certified documents for your records.\n\nThe Board is responsible for obtaining certified court documents and arrest reports related to your prior conviction. The Board does not require applicants to submit these documents. You may voluntarily provide these documents and upload them to your application.\n\nApplications received with certified arrest and certified court records may have significantly shorter wait times.\n\nThe BRN will formally request the certified documents promptly once your application is referred to the Enforcement Division. Processing times for these records vary greatly from one court or arresting agency to another and we are unable to guarantee a timeframe for receipt of these records. The BRN will attempt to obtain these documents in a timely manner. Some applicants may experience significant delays.\n\nApplications received with certified arrest and certified court records may have significantly shorter wait times.\n\nPlease allow additional processing time for documents which must be requested by the Enforcement Division. You can reduce your Enforcement Division processing time by voluntarily providing your certified court and arrest documents, however; you are not required to provide them. The Board will make every attempt at obtaining these documents on your behalf.\n\nApplications received with certified arrest and certified court records may have significantly shorter wait times.\n\nIf you choose not to appeal the application denial, you will be allowed to reapply for licensure one year from the date of the service of the denial letter. Application denials are a permanent action on your licensure record and are reported to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing and the National Practitioner Databank."
