Academy Award winner Barbra Streisand directs, produces and stars in The Mirror Has Two Faces, a touching romantic comedy that explores the modern myths of beauty and sex and how they complicate relationships. Rose Morgan (Streisand) and Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges) are professors at Columbia University who enter into a novel marital arrangement in which friendship and intellectual passion supplant sexual heat. It's when he realizes he is attracted to her that things get confusing. The most sophisticated human constructs are no match for nature's unrelenting hand in this funny, bittersweet story. Lauren Bacall was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Rose's well-put-together mother; Pierce Brosnan, Brenda Vaccaro, George Segal, Mimi Rogers and Elle Macpherson round out a remarkable cast.
