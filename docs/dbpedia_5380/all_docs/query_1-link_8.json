        "text": "Currently the star of the TV series “The Goldbergs”, George Segal (b. 1934) has been one of America’s most productive and most talented leading men for more than fifty years now. If you take a look at his entire body of work, Mr. Segal, an Academy Award-nominee and two-time Golden Globe-winner, has shown time and time again how versatile and prolific he has been as a most reliable actor ever since his first feature, “The Young Doctors” (1961).\n\nOriginally a stage actor and a musician, Mr. Segal is a very accomplished leading screen actor with several interesting and in-depth dramatic and comedic roles to his credit, especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Some of the numerous highlights in his early years include Mike Nichols’ screen version of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (1966); Sidney Lumet’s comedy/drama “Bye Bye Braverman” (1968); Carl Reiner’s dark comedy “Where’s Poppa?” (1970) with Ruth Gordon; Peter Yates’s heist 1972 comedy “The Hot Rock” co-starring Robert Redford; three Melvin Frank comedies including “A Touch of Class” (1973) with undeniable on-screen chemistry of Mr. Segal with Glenda Jackson, and two delightful Ted Kotcheff comedies “Fun With Dick and Jane” (1977, remade in 2005 with Jim Carrey and Téa Leoni) and “Who’s Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?” (1978), respectively with Jane Fonda and Jacqueline Bisset as his co-stars. But, as we pointed out, this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Segal had and still has much more to offer. Playing supporting and character roles in movies up until now, with “2012” (2009), “Love & Other Drugs” (2010, with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway), and “Elsa & Fred” (2014, opposite Shirley MacLaine and Christopher Plummer) as some his more recent feature films, he also appeared regularly in TV movies and series over the years, including the sitcom “Just Shoot Me!” (1997-2003)—always playing prominent parts. Now, Mr. Segal is one of the leading characters in the successful ABC series “The Goldbergs,” co-produced by Seth Gordon, who also directed the pilot episode (September 2013). The show was recently renewed for its fourth season.\n\nTime to take a look at the wonderful career of this actor’s actor.\n\nMr. Segal, when and how did you first get passionate about acting?\n\nI was the third youngest boy in my family, and I guess I was looking for a bit of attention when, as a kid, I had a magic act which I would do at kids’ parties. I was also in all the drama clubs at school that I could be in, and I felt free when I was on the stage. Otherwise, I was an extremely shy little boy, but when I got on the stage, I just felt free.\n\nLosing yourself in a character, is that crucial to you?\n\nYes, because then I am not me anymore, and I enjoy myself in this new role.\n\nWhat standards do you use to accept or turn down a part?\n\nIf I feel that I can do it and bring something to it, then I have the enthusiasm for it that I need.\n\nWhat about direction? When you’re on the set, do you need a lot of direction?\n\nNot so much at this age. I used to need a lot of direction, and I was very fortunate with the directors that I had, such as Mike Nichols, Sidney Lumet, Robert Altman… I had excellent directors and mentors to guide me in the beginning of my career.\n\nRecently I saw Stanley Kramer’s “Ship of Fools” [1965] again on television. You appeared opposite several screen veterans like Vivien Leigh, Simone Signoret, and Jose Ferrer, but that didn’t impress you, I guess, because you played your character [a painter] so beautifully, so powerfully. You are a joy to watch!\n\nWell, I was pretty intimidated by Vivien Leigh and Simone—actually Simone took a liking to me, and I would meet her afterwards in Paris, or if our paths crossed. That was very nice.\n\nAnd Stanley Kramer was the one who cast you for the role?\n\nYes, he did. He had seen me in another film, I forget which one it was, but he was always very kind and good to me. He was just great.\n\nMany young actors need a lot of time and a lot of parts before they get starring roles and top-billing, but in your case, it all happened pretty fast, didn’t it? You already received an Academy Award nomination for “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” [1966] when you were only working in pictures for about five years.\n\nThat was very fast indeed. Mike Nichols had cast me in a play called “The Knack” so he knew my work, and Robert Redford, who was his first choice for “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” thought that the part was too unpleasant, it wasn’t really what he preferred to do. So I got the part, and that was very lucky for me.\n\n“Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” was nominated for a stunning thirteen Academy Awards [winning five], with all four main actors nominated in their respective acting categories. Yet it had a lot of competition from Fred Zinnemann’s “A Man For All Seasons,” nominated for nine Oscars [winning six, including Best Picture and Best Director].\n\nYes, that was a very good film too, written by Robert Bolt. A very good film, “A Man for All Seasons.”\n\nIs it correct to say that “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” put you on the map? On top of that, the film was like a stage play. What was that like for you as an actor?\n\nWell, with Mike Nichols, who came from the stage, we rehearsed for about a month. So we could have opened that on a stage. By the time we were shooting, we were all very comfortable in our roles, and Richard Burton was kind of a mentor for all of us actors. He is probably the best actor I have ever worked with.\n\nIn the following years, you became a very accomplished actor in various genres, often appearing in comedies, and then Paul Mazursky cast you in a powerful role in “Blume in Love” [1973]. Wasn’t that quite a change?\n\nYou know, I think comedy is a very good grounding for everything. I always try to find the humor and the irony in whatever character I am playing because I think of myself as a comedic actor. So that makes drama a lot more fun for me by not taking it so seriously, you know.\n\nEarlier, you mentioned Robert Altman, who directed you in “California Split” [1974], with you playing the character of a gambling addict. What made him such a wonderful filmmaker?\n\nIt’s like rolling the dice: he gave us complete freedom, he enjoyed that, and he shot fast. He would shoot a scene maybe two or three times, and then he would move on. So there’s a rawness; it was like guerilla filmmaking. We’d go to locations, and he would shoot fast; the actors were always on their toes. If you look at “M*A*S*H” [1970], you’ll see how he was able to do that, no one else could do that at the time.\n\nYou made three comedies with Melvin Frank, to me always an underestimated screenwriter-director: “A Touch of Class” [‘1973] with Glenda Jackson, who won an Academy Award for her performance in this film while both of you won Golden Globes. You also collaborated with Melvin Frank on “The Duchess and Dirtwater Fox” [1976] with Goldie Hawn, and “Lost and Found” [1979], another comedy with Glenda Jackson. What kind of a director was Mr. Frank?\n\nWell, he was a director, not unlike Nichols, who got in my head. It was like a telepathic experience; he knew how to motivate me, or how to do the best that I could, with saying very little. There was a definite chemistry between us.\n\n“A Touch of Class” (1974, trailer)\n\nYou also have the distinction of introducing Glenda Jackson to the comedy genre: she was an amazing actress, up until then praised for her serious acting work, who turned out to be a wonderful comedienne as well.\n\nNo question about that. I don’t know if it’s true, but the other day I heard that she is going back into acting. You know, when we made “A Touch of Class”, we were really having fun, and we were enjoying ourselves, and when that happens, it comes through on the screen. We were really having a good time, and that’s why I think the film is so good. And that’s a Melvin Frank picture, as you said. When we did “Lost and Found” [1979], it didn’t have the same magic. We had a great time, but in “A Touch of Class,” we were discovering each other, and by the time we made “Lost and Found,” we were like an old married couple, you know. It didn’t have that same spark.\n\nWhen you made “The Owl and the Pussycat” [1970], Barbra Streisand was your co-star, and more than two decades later, she directed you in “The Mirror Has Two Faces” [1994]. I presume in the second film she was the boss and you were working for her?\n\nThat’s exactly right [laughs]. In “The Owl and the Pussycat” we were two actors and in “The Mirror Has Two Faces” I was working for her. She had worked a long time to achieve that position because that’s what she always wanted to do, and so she got to do it. And she was a very good director.\n\nWhat does it take in your opinion to be a good actor? Besides talent, also flexibility, for example, and are there any other specifics that are required?\n\nWell, the same thing that goes on the stage, you have to enjoy being on le plateau, you know, being on the set, know your lines, and as Woody Allen says, ninety percent is just showing up because there’s no way that you can do this at home. You have to be there, and under the influence of the sixty people who are standing around you on the set—the director, the set designer…—all the elements that go into a film, they affect you, and that’s why you can come in from the street, get your make-up and then suddenly when you arrive on the set, you’re in a new character. That, to me, is magical. What’s also magical is the printed take. Of all the takes that you do, there’s only one that’s the magical one, and it’s up to the director to know which one that is when he cuts the film together. That’s a part that nobody can explain—the printed take—because the cameraman, the camera operator, the director, all the actors, even the crew, they know that’s the one. It’s something different from everything else. It’s when everything comes together, and the total is more than the sum of its parts. That is enough to keep you coming back because it’s almost an out-of-body experience; it’s when the actor takes over and you’re just a witness to what’s happening. That’s called in the zone, and when you’re in the zone, it’s addictive; you keep wanting to get back in the zone. So that’s why actors keep coming back year after year. There’s no feeling like that, and so you seek it out.\n\nIsabella Rossellini once said she is usually at her best with her third take. What about you?\n\nI understand that. Sometimes the first take is the magical one, that’s particularly with Robert Altman. But I understand what Isabella is saying: after the first take, you can make little corrections, then there’s the second take to grow on, and in the third take, it all comes together. So what she says makes a lot of sense. You know, Clint Eastwood says, ‘If it takes more than three takes for a shot, then something’s wrong. Change the camera angle.’ That’s his theory, and it’s a pretty good one too.\n\nYes, and maybe very good advice for any young filmmaker as well. Have you ever considered directing a feature?\n\nNo, too much responsibility.\n\nHow about casting? Do you feel you have ever been typecast, and is it still easy to find the parts that you’d like to play?\n\nYes, sure; there are fewer and far between, but they’re out there. I’m always surprised when I get cast in something because it’s very hard to have a view of yourself or how people see you. So it’s always interesting for me when I do get cast in something. Oh, they see me in that? Okay, let’s try that; I never thought of myself doing that, but let’s see. So it’s nice to play a variety of parts, that’s one of the things I’m proud of in this so-called career: I’ve been to a lot of different stations, a lot of different places.\n\nYou are a very modest man, aren’t you?\n\nWell, it’s tough to be so full of yourself if you know that it’s ultimately a magical moment that you’re present for that’s in the film, and that’s not really you: it’s the actor that’s in you. And it’s very hard to control that actor, he does what he wants, and I follow along. So it’s hard to be boastful in that regard when you know it’s not you, it’s this actor in you who’s been doing this a long time, and the best I can do is step out of the way. Then I’m most relaxed and the actor takes over. That’s the best circumstance for me.\n\nDespite all of the success you’ve had up until now as a major, leading actor on the screen and on television, do you maybe have any regrets career-wise?\n\nNo, I can’t afford to have any regrets. I’ve been too lucky.\n\nPeople have always recognized you for so many years. When you go out, does that have any effect on your privacy or your personal life?\n\nNot so much. We don’t go out that much, I’m not a party person, and I lead a rather quiet life. So that never had any effect on me.\n\nWhat would you consider the most gratifying response you ever got in your career?\n\nWhen I see in people’s eyes that I really affected them—either in comedy or drama—it moves me.\n\nYou made a few films, like “King Rat” [1965] and “The Quiller Memorandum” [1966], when you almost the only American in the cast. Did you notice any difference in acting styles between European actors and yourself?\n\nYes, it brought my game up enormously to work with those actors, like Max von Sydow and Alec Guinness, all those British actors they brought over for “King Rat.” It raises your game, and the acting was on a much higher level than I was used to in both films, and so you have to rise on the occasion.\n\nWhat advice would you give to young actors?\n\nHang in there, it’s full of disappointments, and you just got to keep plugging a way. You can’t stop an actor. If he’s going to be an actor, that’s it. I don’t know what that is, but it’s a need. If you don’t have what they call ‘the fire in the belly’ to do this, you shouldn’t be doing it. It’s not for dilettantes.\n\nHow do you reflect on yourself as a veteran screen actor?\n\nI’m not much for reflection, but it’s just where I am. I got to live this long, and I’m still acting, so I consider myself enormously lucky, blessed, and thankful that I am still here and am still doing it. It amazes me. You knew, one of the great perks of this business, not so much anymore as it was years ago, but when shooting in Europe, for example, when making a film like “Who’s Killing the Great Chefs of Europe?” [1978] with Jacqueline Bisset, that was a gift. We had a very good dialogue from [screenwriter] Peter Stone, and Ted Kotcheff was another wonderful director that I worked with.\n\nI once met Ted Kotcheff in the early eighties, and he spoke very highly of you, remembering the time when you made “Fun With Dick and Jane” [1977] with Jane Fonda.\n\nOh yes, that was a very good script by David Giler. You see, I also had very good writers, and if you’d ask me what I look for, I would have to say not only the director but also the quality of the writing, and I have been very fortunate in that regard. When I read a script for the first time, I go to a quiet place, and I lose myself in it. You can usually tell in the first or second page whether this script is going to be for you in it because you get the style of the writing, how they open the film, and if it grabs you, you keep going. If not, you start to skim through… It’s very hard to find a good script.\n\nIs it more difficult now than thirty, forty years ago?\n\nNo, it’s always been the same: there are a few good ones every year, and you try to get one of them.\n\nYou are known to be a very accomplished banjo player. Do you still play the instrument?\n\nPractically every day. I just strum away. It’s more than just a distraction; it’s more like a passion. In the 1980s, I was in a jazz band for a while; that kept me very busy. And it’s funny to think of a banjo as a passion, but there you are!\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nFebruary 4, 2016\n\n“Blume in Love” (1973, trailer)\n\nFILMS\n\nTHE YOUNG DOCTORS (1961) DIR Phil Karlson PROD Stuart Muller, Lawrence Turman SCR Joseph Hayes (novel ‘The Final Diagnosis’ [1959] by Arthur Hailey) CAM Arthur J Ornitz MUS Elmer Bernstein ED Robert Swink CAST Fredric March, Ben Gazarra, Dick Clark, Ina Balin, Eddie Albert, Phyllis Alexander, Edward Andrews, Aline MacMahon, Arthur Hill, George Segal (Doctor Howard), Ronald Reagan (Narrator [voice only])\n\nTHE LONGEST DAY (1962) DIR Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, Gerd Oswald PROD Darryl F.
