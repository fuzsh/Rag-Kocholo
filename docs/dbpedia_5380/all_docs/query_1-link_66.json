        "text": "I have created my own list of hotties. (Warning: Some are SUPER-HOT!) Some are rising stars, while others have been making their mark in TV/film/etc., for years. Not only are these gents good-looking, they’re good actors!\n\nAaron Eckhart\n\nHe’s not just Two Face, but an actor of MANY faces and facets. Aaron grew up in Cali, was raised Mormon, and attended BYU (where he met director and close pal, Neil LaBute.) They both come from a similar background, and have collaborated often. LaBute operates outside the mainstream, working on topics he likes. Aaron is unafraid to take on unusual projects; he’s gained lbs. and changed his hair/looks for many roles.\n\nThis is a screen shot from Possession (one of my fave films of ALL time!) In it Aaron plays an underappreciated American researcher (post-PhD) in London who happens upon a JUICY secret (at least in the field of Romantic poetry). He joins up w/ an icy Brit Womens Studies prof (Paltrow) to get more info… Too bad no REAL poetry experts look like him- LOL!!!\n\nI smile a lot in public because I tend to look too serious.\n\nAdrian Lester\n\nWow, check out those EYES!!! Like many performers of the “old days”, Adrian Lester can sing, dance, AND act onstage and onscreen. He’s a BIG talent (physically, too- he’s around 6’4″) who has a rather soft voice.\n\nAfter I saw him in Primary Colors, I wondered why he wasn’t in more (big) films. Fans of the bard can check him out in Branagh’s musical film Love’s Labour Lost and As You Like It. His smile is VERY sweet!\n\nChiwetel Ejiofor\n\nWith a (Nigerian) name like that- you’re gonna have a nickname (Chewy)! This young actor (under 35) can pretty much play ANY part, as the song goes. He’s done Shakespeare (screen/satge), played a transvestite (Kinky Boots), and acted opposite Denzel (Inside Man / American Ganster)!\n\nHe made a HUGE impression w/ Dirty Pretty Things, a smart, sensitive view of immigrant, working-class London. He played a Nigerian immigrant (and former doc) who worked days driving a cab and nights at a hotel. Chewy based this character partly on his OWN immigrant father (who was a real-life doc). Unfortunately, he lost his father in a car accident when he was 11 y.o. The scars on his forehead are a reminder of that.\n\nHe disappears into roles like few other actors can, which makes him valuable to any film, but it also makes it difficult for him to become a star.\n\nI enjoy every role that I’ve seen him perform. His acting seems effortless and his interaction with colleagues is a beautifully timed dance.\n\nA superb artist and I believe he will win that Oscar one day. A magnificent actor!\n\n-Fan comments from IMDB\n\nChristian Bale\n\nWelsh-born Bale has appeared in Shakespeare, dramas and comedies demonstrating a versatility, depth and range that has made him one of the best reviewed actors today and one of the most popular actors on the Internet.\n\n-IMDB\n\nThough born in Wales, he calls himself British (as he didn’t grow up in Wales). Christian grew up onscreen; his 1st movie role was at age 14 in Spielberg’s Empire of the Sun. He trained for 10 weeks in dancing and martial arts for the dance sequences in Newsies (1992) and Swing Kids (1993).\n\nSince it’s holiday season, check out Little Women w/ Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, and Kristen Dunst.\n\nAn actor should never be larger than the film he’s in.\n\n–Spin magazine, March 1996\n\nI only sound intelligent when there’s a good scriptwriter around.\n\nIn American Psycho, Christian tackles a very, very EVIL businessman consumed w/ his own desires.\n\nIt’s the actors who are prepared to make fools of themselves who are usually the ones who come to mean something to the audience.\n\nI don’t think I was particularly in need of superheroes. I never had any fascination with Superman or Spider-Man or a Batman kind of character. If it happened at all, it was imagined characters that I had invented. My dad was a role model for me. He was a fascinating man. There was intrigue and entertainment growing up with him. He gave me an edict that I still pursue: Life should never be boring.\n\nDenzel Washington\n\nMan gives you the award, but God gives you the reward.\n\nTo keep him out of trouble, Denzel’s parents sent him to The Boys and Girls Club; he’s now one of their spokespeople. A couple of weeks ago, I saw Denzel’s first film, a comedy called Carbon Copy (opposite George Segal). Not only did he look in FAB shape, he was confident and easy with the lines, actions, etc. When Denzel is attached to a film, people all over the world take notice. Some guys just have the “it” factor!\n\nDid you know one of Denzel’s twins, Katia, is now at Yale university?\n\nOn Oprah, Julia Roberts commented that “working with Denzel (on The Pelican Brief) was like working with The Beatles.” Dir. Ed Zwick uses a lot of close-ups on him, because “even when he’s not saying anything, the audience is looking at him.” His wife in Crimson Tide, Vanessa Bell-Calloway, told People that “Denzel has wit, style, and intelligence.” But the coolest thing about this big Hollywood success is that he’s willing to help young actors!\n\nDylan McDermott\n\nMy theory about actors is we’re all walking milk cartons. Expirations dates everywhere.\n\nAfter a very troubled childhood/family life, Dylan and his lil sis were adopted by his step-mom (actress/writer/feminist icon Eve Ensler). She encouraged him to go to acting school and Fordham. She also turned his life around. He had become a hard drinker and was constantly in fights. At age 23, he quit drinking. He also changed his name from Mark to Dylan in tribute to Eve.\n\nThis is a shot from The Mistress of Spices– a terrible film I suffered through just to see Dylan. In order to NOT alienate her Bollywood fans, Aishwarya Rai DID NOT kiss Dylan on the lips in Gurinder Chadha’s rom com film. Boy, talk about missed opportunity!\n\nHugh Dancy\n\nIn Elizabeth I, a great UK miniseries I previously wrote about, Hugh goes toe-to-toe w/ Jeremy Irons and Helen Mirren. Not bad for a guy just who’s just 33!\n\nWho better to rescue a damsel in distress? LOL… Daniel Deronda is about a young man- sensitive, caring, and highly intelligent, but haunted by doubts about his identity. Is he a British gentleman like his adopted father? And why is he drawn to the Jewish faith?\n\nHugh is not just a pretty face; he graduated from Oxford University with a degree in English Literature & Language and speaks French fluently.\n\nMy dad is an academic but there was never any question of me following on that route. I’m thick.\n\nIoan Gruffudd\n\nIsn’t he looking sophisticated in this pic? Ioan starred in Amazing Grace, and had a bit part (as Tony Blair) in Oliver Stone’s W. He’s done TV, historical stuff, action- you name it! An interesting fact about Ioan is that his first language was Welsh; he’s a bilingual, multicultural guy.\n\nYou don’t need blue eyes to be a hottie- warm brown ones can work, too. Did you know Ioan starred on a TV show (Horatio Hornblower) a few years back? It’s now sold in the US. You may have seen him in Wilde opposite Stephen Fry; he had gorgeous long hair then!\n\nI’m looking forward to seeing one of his (older) films- Solomon and Gaenor. It’s a youthful love story between a Jewish boy and a Catholic girl in Ireland.\n\nJimmy Smits\n\nWhere else can you find cheekbones like that!? His height and striking looks (his heritage is Puerto Rican) make him a major presence onscreen. Jimmy Smits has been making his mark since the late 1980s, when he was cast on LA Law. Too bad he didn’t take the offer to star in CSI: Miami. (I’d rather watch him than David Caruso ANY day!) He grew up in one of the toughest neighborhoods of Brooklyn (Bushwick), and can be seen in ads for the charity NY Cares.\n\nHere is a pic from The West Wing, where Jimmy played Matt Santos, a serious, sympathetic democratic presidential candidate w/ a young fam. Hmmm… sounds familiar.\n\nSometimes art imitates life! Like our future prez, Jimmy is someone who transcends race. He’s played Latino characters (from many backgrounds), but also characters that weren’t race-specific.\n\nToby Stephens\n\nI like this longer hair A LOT! Toby is possibly the hottest Bond villain (aside from fellow Brit Sean Bean.) Speaking of Sean Bean… He and Sean acted in Sharpe’s Challenge (shot in Rajasthan, India). Speaking of India… He’s acted in English AND Hindi (alongside Aamir Khan in The Rising).\n\nLike mom, Dame Maggie Smith (above w/ bro), Toby has an unmistakeable (posh) accent, confidant gait, large expressive eyes, and a wide smile.\n\nIn The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Toby plays a kind country farmer who falls for his new neighbor, and becomes a father figure to her little son. This character is VERY sweet and gentlemanly!\n\nToby took on the challenge of Mr. Rochester- a very “changeable” romantic hero who’s “larger than life.” Now he has MANY more fans!\n\nThe Cosby Show\n\nLong before “The Cos” became a controversial international figure, he played Dr. Cliff Huxtable- a cheery father, loyal hubby, and successful OB/GYN (who just happened to be black). He was also a wacky dresser! Remember those baggy, patterned, and colorful sweaters? Some folks didn’t like the fact that race wasn’t a BIG ‘ole deal in the (very affluent and assimilated) Cosby household. But that’s how it is for MANY people I know- they don’t go around discussing race, culture, etc. ALL the livelong day!\n\nIsn’t this kitchen a BIT large for NYC? LOL…\n\nDid you know that the Cosby family house (the outside) was a brownstone in Brooklyn Heights? This is one of the priciest, prettiest, and family-oriented ‘hoods in NYC.\n\nI liked the fact that Claire (a corporate lawyer) knew what Cliff was up to, what he was thinking, and was NEVER a pushover. She was also (naturally) cool, elegant, and pretty!\n\nWasn’t Rudy adorable? The most positive aspect of the show- Cliff was a VERY involved father. He listened to his kids, teased them (sometimes a bit TOO much), and worked at problem-solving.\n\nFamily Ties\n\nWhat other teen (besides Alex P. Keaton) had a poster of Reagan on his bedroom wall!? Alex was NEVER afraid to show his smarts (rare for sitcom kids these days). He knew what he wanted and went for it, BUT he was a likeable fellow! Michael J. Fox brought a kind of physicality to his role that was VERY humorous, especially when contrasted with the slow, deliberate movements of his (much taller) father, played by Michael Gross. The fact that Steven and Elise were ex-hippies made Alex’s Republicanism funny, too.\n\nRemember how Alex used to leap up onto the kitchen counter to answer the phone? LOL…\n\nMichael met his wife of many years, Tracy Pollan, while working on this comedy! In recent years, BOTH Tracy and Michael Gross made (very memorable) guest appearances on the Law & Order shows.\n\nMacGyver\n\nWow, can you believe Richard Dean Anderson (RDA) is over 50 now!? With his blonde hair (making the mullet look COOL), blue eyes, and youthful face/form, RDA was a big audience draw for the ladies in the TV audience. Who says girls don’t like science (even far-fetched stuff)?\n\nOkay, the big question- why didn’t Mac ever have a gf? After all, who doesn’t like a hottie who’s unassuming (he’s from Minnesota after all), lives on a houseboat (in SoCal), and never drinks? Because many female fans would NOT have it; they wrote letters against such a relationship. LOL!\n\nDid you know that MacGyver was a big international hit? Some friends (who grew up in Bangladesh) said they watched this show regularly. Back then the main baddies were Russians, unlike today. Hmmm… what would Mac think of religious fundies?\n\nThis was the kind of action show ALL ages could watch. Mac was against guns, so he never used them- a good msg for young’uns!\n\nMy HS Economics teacher, Mr. Reff, once played against Richard Dean Anderson in a charity hockey tournament in Tucson. This was back when RDA had a role on General Hospital. Mr. Reff commented that RDA wasn’t as good a player as he was!\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation\n\nThis is one of my MOST fave TV shows of all time!!! This show had a GREAT cast, intelligent writing, subtle humor, and said a LOT about our time (though it was set in a fictional future). My dad said he didn’t understand it upon first glance- he called it “weird.” We kids insisted that he watch it more closely. You had to pay attention to discover the important issues ST:TNG explored. Remember the #1 rule of Star Fleet? “The Prime Directive” said that there can be no interference with the internal affairs of other civilizations. I guess W. and his crew weren’t watching- LOL!\n\nIt’s VERY tough to decide, but my fave characters were Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart) and Data (Brent Spiner). Because Patrick was mature, confidant, and theatrically trained, the role of authority suited him to a tee. And who doesn’t LOVE his voice?\n\nI kind of liked that fact that Picard and Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) didn’t hook up, even though they had GREAT respect for each other and FAB chemistry together! That’s how REAL life goes sometimes…\n\nData, under his odd contacts and golden make-up, sought to be more like the humans. He was an android (the first of his kind), so he was always an outsider. As a teen, it was EASY to relate to him! I liked the easy friendship between Data and Geordi. And remember when a pretty blonde engineer fell in love with Data? Fun stuff!\n\nRemember when Data wanted to learn to dance so he’d be prepared for O’Brien’s wedding? He didn’t explain to Dr. Crusher that he wanted to learn social dancing, hence the tap dancing!\n\nFrom Wikipedia: In response to a fan’s question at the 2008 Fan Expo in Toronto, Brent said when he was first auditioning for the role of Data on Star Trek The Next Generation, he was told he might have to read for the role of Riker. Brent’s response was he only wanted to read for the character of Lt. Cmdr. Data. He said he would not have been interested in doing the show if he had been cast as Riker.\n\nAnother cool thing about TNG– talented guest stars and recurring characters (like Q, played by John de Lancie). Q was one of the FEW guys who could unsettle, annoy, and (often) totally piss off the cool, professional Capt. Picard. Q even went on to other ST shows, b/c the fans LOVED him so much! He gave Data the gift of laughter in one memorable ep."
