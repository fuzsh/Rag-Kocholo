        "text": "George Segal, the engaging actor who during his 1970s prime generated great chemistry with his co-stars in such lighthearted classics as Where’s Poppa?, The Owl and the Pussycat, A Touch of Class, California Split and Fun With Dick and Jane, died Tuesday. He was 87.\n\nSegal died of complications from bypass surgery, his wife, Sonia, announced. He died in Santa Rosa, California.\n\nAlthough he was most associated with comedy and playing brainy, neurotic characters, Segal’s acting range was considerable.\n\nHis performance as a pusillanimous young professor in Mike Nichols‘ best picture nominee Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966) opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton landed him a supporting actor Oscar nomination. And in the war drama King Rat (1965), an adaptation of a James Clavell novel, he portrayed a conniving wheeler-dealer in a Japanese POW camp during World War II.\n\nSegal, however, did comedy best. He starred for seven seasons (1997-2003) on the NBC workplace sitcom Just Shoot Me! as Jack Gallo, the roguish, many-times-married publisher who employs his journalist daughter (Laura San Giacomo) at his fashion magazine, Blush.\n\nAnd starting in 2013, he was still going strong as Pops Solomon, a grandfather always on the lookout for the ladies, on ABC’s 1980s-set The Goldbergs.\n\n“On behalf of everyone at The Goldbergs, we are devastated at the loss of our dear friend George,” a statement from the show said. “He was kind, sweet, beyond talented and funny. George was the true epitome of class, and he touched all of our lives so deeply. It was an honor and a privilege to have him as a colleague and friend all of these years. It is no surprise to any of us that knew him so well that he is a true national treasure.”\n\nFans got to appreciate just how delightful Segal could be from the many appearances he made on The Tonight Show, where he played the banjo and cracked up host Johnny Carson with his infectious high spirits. (He recorded a 1967 ragtime album titled The Yama Yama Man — Carson provided the liner notes — and performed for years with fellow actor Conrad Janis in the Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band.)\n\nSegal’s single most hilarious moment in the movies could have come in the Carl Reiner dark comedy Where’s Poppa? (1970), when his character’s senile mother (Ruth Gordon) kisses his tush. “It was just another day at the office for me,” he told the Jewish Journal.\n\n“I am saddened by the fact that my close friend and client of many years has passed away,” his longtime manager Abe Hoch said in a statement. “I will miss his warmth, humor, camaraderie and friendship. He was a wonderful human.”\n\nDuring his remarkable 1970-80 run, Segal teamed up with leading ladies Eva Marie Saint in Loving (1970), Barbra Streisand in The Owl and the Pussycat (1970), Susan Anspach in Paul Mazursky’s Blume in Love (1973), Glenda Jackson in A Touch of Class (1973), Goldie Hawn in The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox (1976), Jane Fonda in Fun With Dick and Jane (1977), Jacqueline Bisset in Who Is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe? (1978) and Natalie Wood in The Last Married Couple in America (1980).\n\nHe also starred during the decade in the caper flick The Hot Rock (1972), in the sci-fi thriller The Terminal Man (1974), in Robert Altman‘s gambling film California Split (1974) and as Sam Spade Jr. in The Black Bird (1975).\n\nThe youngest of four children, George Segal Jr. was born Feb. 13, 1934, in Great Neck, New York. His father was a malt-and-hops agent and his mother, Fanny, a housewife. The family was Jewish but not religious, and he never received a bar mitzvah.\n\nWhen he was 9, he saw Alan Ladd in This Gun for Hire at the local movie house and decided to become an actor. “He was this guy with a trench coat and a gun, and Veronica Lake was nuts about him,” he recalled. “Something clicked in me that this was a job, and I wanted it.”\n\nHe attended the George School, a private Quaker boarding school, in Newtown, Pennsylvania, and then headed to Philadelphia-area Haverford College, where he was the banjo-playing leader of Bruno Lynch and His Imperial Jazz Band.\n\nAfter he was drafted into the U.S. Army and stationed on Staten Island, he got his bachelor’s degree in drama from Columbia University in 1955. His first job in the theater was janitor at the Circle in the Square.\n\nHe made his stage debut off-Broadway in 1956 in Moliere’s Don Juan, which featured Peter Falk, then appeared with Jason Robards in The Iceman Cometh and in 1959 in Leave It to Jane. For a brief spell, he was a member of the New York Shakespeare Festival Company.\n\nIn the early ’60s, with the solemnity of the Actors Studio tradition in vogue, Segal sidestepped The Method: “Everybody was so hung up there,” he said, “they were afraid to just act.” Instead, he co-founded a comedy improv revue, The Premise.\n\n“I learned more about real motivation and how to improvise than I could have anywhere else,” he told Newsweek in 1970. While with The Premise, he was spotted by producer Larry Turman and signed for a small role in The Young Doctors (1961), then played a U.S. Army Ranger in The Longest Day (1962).\n\nSegal ventured to Los Angeles in the summer of 1963 to do a TV series that never got off the ground. He ended up on episodes of such shows as The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Channing and The Doctors and the Nurses.\n\nHis movie career took off in 1965 when he starred as that profiteering POW in King Rat. Nichols, with whom he had worked in The Knack off-Broadway, then offered him the role of Sandy Dennis’ husband, Nick, in Virginia Woolf after Robert Redford turned down the part. (Segal lost out on the Oscar to Walter Matthau in The Fortune Cookie.)\n\nSegal then portrayed an unsavory personality who cloaks himself in the sympathetic guise of a Nazi hunter in Michael Anderson’s The Quiller Memorandum (1966).\n\nHe got an early chance to be funny when he played a New York detective with mommy issues in No Way to Treat a Lady (1968). The wife of director Jack Smight had spotted him cracking jokes on a talk show and thought he would be great for the part.\n\nIn 1979, Segal pulled out of the male lead in 10 (Dudley Moore took over) and was sued by producer-director Blake Edwards, who received a reported $270,000 in the settlement. That would foreshadow a career dry spell for the actor.\n\n“Most of us get about 10 years at best [at the top],” Segal told the Los Angeles Times in 2011. “As you get into playing father roles, the parts dry up because — I don’t mean to say it’s a sex thing — but you have that testosterone vitality. Then slowly you move into another category, and there ain’t as many jobs there.”\n\nIn 1988, Segal got the lead on ABC’s Murphy’s Law, playing an insurance fraud investigator, but the show lasted just 13 episodes. He played a married businessman who impregnates an accountant (Kirstie Alley) and then dumps her in Look Who’s Talking (1989).\n\nHe began a comeback of sorts as Jeff Bridges’ best friend in Streisand’s The Mirror Has Two Faces and as Mary Tyler Moore’s husband in David O. Russell’s Flirting With Disaster, both released in 1996. He began his long run on Steve Levitan’s Just Shoot Me! a year later.\n\nAfter a guest-starring stint as talent manager Murray Berenson on HBO’s Entourage and two seasons on TV Land’s Retired at 35, Segal joined Adam Goldberg’s The Goldbergs.\n\n“This was on the table, they sent it to me, and I laughed out loud, which is very rare. I really haven’t done that since I read the pilot of Just Shoot Me!,” he told The A.V. Club in 2013. “It’s very rare that an actor laughs out loud. So that caught my attention right away, and then an interview led from this to that and … ah, it’s mystical to me.\n\n“I don’t ever know how it happens. Sometimes it’s being in the right place at the right time, sometimes you’re just the guy they want. It’s impossible to explain. This is a real gambler’s business, acting. It’s a crapshoot, and you keep stepping up to the table and hope that your number comes up. Or it’s like being a used car in a used car lot. You’re just waiting for somebody to come over and kick your tires. You’ve got to be crazy to do this.”\n\nSegal was married three times: to film editor Marion Sobel from 1956 until their 1983 divorce; to music manager Linda Rogoff (they met at Carnegie Hall when his band was opening for Steve Lawrence & Eydie Gorme) from 1983 until her death from aplastic anemia in 1996; and to Sonia Schultz Greenbaum, his high school sweetheart, since 1996.\n\nSurvivors also include his daughters, Polly and Elizabeth; stepchildren David, Matthew and Samantha; and grandchildren Lucas, Jacob and Max. Donations in his memory may be made to Planned Parenthood.\n\n[Warning: This story contains spoilers from Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil.]\n\n“I’ve had so much to say over the past two years of wanting to set the record straight about what it was that happened,” Demi Lovato says at the start of her new YouTube Originals docuseries, Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil.\n\nIn the four-part series, which premieres Tuesday — it also served as South by Southwest’s opening night headliner during its first-ever virtual fest — the singer breaks her silence on the events that led to her near-fatal 2018 overdose.\n\nPrior to the overdose, Lovato had been in the middle of her Tell Me You Love Me tour and filming a documentary that has since been shelved. However, Lovato notes, in that documentary she was only allowing the cameras to see “the tip of the iceberg. … I wasn’t showing them what I was doing behind closed doors.” (Though that project was never finished, Dancing With the Devil repurposes footage from it to further provide context to Lovato’s story.)\n\nThe 2018 tragedy led Lovato to suffer a heart attack and three strokes and embark on a fight for her life: “My doctors said that I had five to 10 more minutes [to live].”\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Dancing With the Devil helmer Michael D. Ratner, whose OBB Media produced the project, teased that whatever audiences think happened the night of her overdose and prior “is probably pretty far from what really did.” Added Ratner: “What hasn’t been documented is the details of her life that led to that night. … We provide that opportunity for you to have a whole picture here.”\n\nAnd now all will be revealed in the first two episodes of the docuseries as Lovato breaks down the moment she relapsed, what led to that night and the frightening aftermath in the hospital.\n\nBelow, THR takes a look at the takeaways from the first two episodes of Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil.\n\n“Estranged Relationship” With Her Father\n\nRatner tells THR that it’s worth noting of Lovato’s story that her “decision-making of that night” started “many years” prior. To offer a complete picture of her life and the events that shaped her, Lovato speaks in-depth about the struggles she witnessed both her father and mother face.\n\nThough Lovato has been open in the past about losing her father to addiction, in the series she speaks about him at length, explaining, “Growing up my whole life, I longed for that relationship with him, and then I resented him because he was an addict and an alcoholic and was abusive to my mom.” Lovato eventually cut her father out of her life because “it was causing more harm than good.” Though she lost her father years ago, Lovato admits his death is “complicated” because, to this day, the family doesn’t know the exact day that he died. “By the time he was found, his body was too decomposed to have an open casket. He had been laying there, I think, for about a week and a half before anybody found him — and during that was Father’s Day,” she says. “Every summer now that rolls around, I spend it thinking, ‘Was today the day that my dad died?'” Lovato also expresses how his death led to her feeling guilt for being a mental health advocate: “Yet, here was my father, who had bipolar [disorder] and schizophrenia and then, on top of that, the disease of addiction, and I hadn’t helped him the way that I would’ve helped other people or the way that I have been preaching about.”\n\nIn regards to her mother’s history, Lovato shares that her mother dealt with substance abuse and an eating disorder. “So I didn’t know any different. Then I was put in beauty pageants where it’s extremely competitive and it’s all about your looks and your talent. My self-esteem was just completely damaged,” Lovato says, recalling a pact she would make with herself that if she didn’t win a pageant then she would “never eat again.”\n\nEnduring Overwhelming Control From Her Team\n\nDuring a recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Lovato explained that she wanted to “set the record straight” in the series as a way of proving that many can learn from “role models” who “have overcome their deepest, darkest struggles.” However, in the series, Lovato speaks in great detail about the pressures she originally faced from her team to be a role model for her fans, which eventually took a toll on her mentally and physically. Lovato explains that she previously had a team that consisted of assistants, a wellness coach, dietician, nutritionist and therapist, all of whom would help monitor her and ensure she wouldn’t relapse. It’s also revealed that anyone around Lovato had to be drug tested, and she wasn’t allowed to hang around anyone who wasn’t sober. Her former assistant Jordan Jackson admitted that there was one night she had to spend the night with Lovato because the singer simply ate a cookie. With so much monitoring and restriction, Lovato says she started relapsing in her eating disorder, as she consistently overexercised and was extreme dieting: “I feel like decisions have been made for me more so than I have made decisions for myself.” In an interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Lovato further divulged that she also was not in control of her finances, and every time she was in a hotel room, the phone was removed so she couldn’t order room service.\n\nIn unreleased footage from her shelved documentary, Lovato can be seen having an emotional conversation regarding sketches of her tour costumes. “There’s just so much pressure as a female in the industry to look a certain way and to dress a certain way and that shit is the stuff that I used to look up to. That shit’s, like, really triggering,” she says on the verge of tears.\n\nLovato’s friends and family also speak about the restrictions she faced. Lovato’s former choreographer and creative director Dani Vitale says, “I feel like I was always walking on eggshells no matter what. What I was eating around who, what we had in our dressing room, what kind of food.” Meanwhile, Lovato’s sister Dallas Lovato explains, “It was hammered into her head: ‘You have to be sober. You have to be this icon, this role model’ that my sister never claimed to want to be in the first place.” In footage from her former documentary, Lovato’s friend and former sober companion Sirah added that the singer almost became like “a martyr in a way that is so isolating. … I think that to be the poster child of perfection and mental health and all these kind of things is such a dangerous slippery slope.”\n\n“I’ve spent more time trying to please other people the past several years of my life than I have really trying to make it what I want,” Lovato says. “I was miserable and I, like, snapped.” She later points out that “six years is a long time to be told that if you slip up you’re going to die. And at some point, enough just becomes enough.”\n\nRelapsing\n\nGrowing miserable while under restrictions and pressures, Lovato recalls being at a photoshoot and having the thought, “I don’t even know why I’m sober anymore.” That same night, Lovato admits, she drank a bottle of red wine then contacted someone who had drugs on them. “I’m surprised I didn’t OD that night,” Lovato says, sharing that while attending a party, she reunited with her former drug dealer from six years prior. “I just went to town. I went on a shopping spree,” she says. That night she experimented with drugs she had never tried before including meth, which she admits she mixed with ecstasy/molly, cocaine, marijuana, alcohol and oxycodone. “That alone should’ve killed me,” she says. Weeks later, Lovato says she was introduced to heroin when her drug dealer only had that instead of her usual “cocktail” of “coke and Xanax” (she explains that she “loved the combination” of it being “an upper and downer”). “I started using recreationally, and obviously, you can’t do that with heroin before you become addicted to it,” she says.\n\nHer friends Matthew Scott Montgomery and Sirah explain that they, along with her family, were not aware of the drug use, but there were “red flags.” Montgomery recalls driving over to Lovato’s house after she told him she decided to drink again. Expecting her to be in a bad condition, Montgomery says he surprisingly found her drinking and fine. Meanwhile, Sirah recalls that during a friend’s game night she found Lovato upstairs in the bathroom with tin foil and smoking. “She didn’t even notice I was there and I was horrified and devastated,” she says. She stayed there to make sure Lovato was OK then told Lovato the next day that she needed to seek help.\n\nLovato says it was during a trip to Bali that she realized she had become “physically dependent” on heroin. She would then write her 2018 song “Sober” in which she admits to her relapse and sings lyrics such as, “I’m sorry to myself” and “To the ones who never left me / We’ve been down this road before / I’m so sorry, I’m not sober anymore.”\n\nShe eventually went on her Tell Me You Love Me tour where she says she was drinking alcohol excessively. In footage from her shelved documentary, Lovato can be seen partying in a bar and demanding the bartender give her more alcohol. After returning to L.A., she says she began using heavily again: “None of my friends knew what I was using so I kept it very hidden from everyone. That is one thing that I was very good at, was hiding the fact that I was addicted to crack and heroin.”\n\n“She can hide stuff really, really well,” Montgomery agrees, whereas her sister Madison says, “Demi is very good at hiding what she needs to hide.” “Demi’s good at making you believe that she’s OK,” Lovato’s stepfather Eddie De La Garza adds. Lovato notes that it was “unfair” to those around her at the time given how much she was “manipulating” everyone and “making sure they never found out” about her secret drug use.\n\nThe 2018 Overdose\n\nAfter admitting to being dependent on heroin and secretly using hard drugs, Lovato chronicles the night of her near-fatal overdose. Lovato narrates that she was out celebrating a birthday with friends, all of whom were unaware of her recent relapse. In photographs from the night, Lovato can be seen posing at the bar past midnight. The group would eventually return to Lovato’s house for an afterparty, with Vitale saying she felt “comfortable” after Lovato offered everyone La Croix and they just danced on the roof and had fun.\n\n“When I was leaving the house, I just felt a little odd,” Vitale says, recalling thinking that she felt she needed to stay for some reason but couldn’t explain why. Lovato says at 5:30 a.m. she told everyone she was going to bed, but instead, she called one of her dealers over.\n\nJackson, who found Lovato that morning, shared that she arrived at the singer’s house early because Lovato had wanted a doctor’s appointment. Jackson said she kept knocking on the door to Lovato’s room to no answer, which eventually led her to go inside. “It was really dark and cold in her room and I kind of got chills. Honestly, I thought that she was just drunk or hungover so I started to nudge her a little. … She wasn’t really moving. She was, like, drooling,” Jackson says, saying she immediately called Lovato’s head of security and chief of staff Max Lea.\n\n“She was propped up, vomit everywhere, but she was on her back, which isn’t good,” Lea reveals, adding that he instructed security to put Lovato on her side and clear her throat. Jackson also recalls the frightening scene of watching paramedics use Narcan in an attempt to bring Lovato back to life: “There was one point where she turned blue. Her whole body completely turned blue.” Lovato’s parents, sisters and friends also emotionally recall receiving texts and phone calls about the news, unsure what had happened, followed by panic at the thought of Lovato not making it.\n\nRecovering in the Hospital\n\nThe scene at the hospital grew more terrifying given Lovato’s condition. Lovato’s neurologist, Dr. Shouri Lahiri, says that Lovato’s oxygen levels were “dangerously low” at 70 percent. “It was like a horror movie,” Lovato’s mother, Dianna De La Garza, says. “They put her in ICU. She had a tube in her neck that was taking her blood into a machine, cleaning it and then putting it back into her neck.” After asking the doctor what would happen if the tube was accidentally pulled out, Lovato’s mother said she learned the tube was “sewn into her neck.”\n\n“I don’t think people realize how bad it actually was. I had three strokes. I had a heart attack. I suffered brain damage from the strokes. I can’t drive anymore and I have blind spots in my vision,” Lovato says. “I also had pneumonia and multiple organ failure.”\n\nLovato recalls being surprised when she woke up because she hadn’t injected any drugs into her system that night, but rather smoked them. “I’m really lucky to be alive. My doctors said that I had five to 10 more minutes and had my assistant not come in, I wouldn’t be here today.”\n\nThings grew more emotional when Lovato’s younger sister sat next to her in her hospital room, only to have her ask, “Who is that?” Lovato was “legally blind” when she woke up — Lahiri says that the areas of Lovato’s brain that were initially affected were her vision centers at the back of her brain.\n\nLovato has opened up in a previous interview that she sought treatment because her parents threatened that she couldn’t see her younger sister anymore until she got sober. With tears streaming down her face, Lovato admits it’s “ironic” and “in a weird way, poetic” that she literally could not see her sister when she woke up: “I think that God has a twisted sense of humor sometimes.”\n\nMore From the Night of the Overdose\n\n“What people don’t realize about that night for me is I didn’t just overdose. I also was taken advantage of, ” Lovato says. The singer reveals that she learned that on that July morning, she was found naked and blue. “I was literally left for dead after he took advantage of me,” she says. “When I woke up in the hospital, they asked if I had had consensual sex.”\n\nThough everything was a blur, Lovato admits she had a flash of memory of being with her dealer and told the doctors it was consensual. But a month after her overdose, Lovato had a moment of clarity. “I realized, ‘Hey, you weren’t in any state of mind to make a consensual decision.’ That kind of trauma doesn’t go away overnight and it doesn’t go away in the first few months of rehab either,” she recalls thinking. The docuseries also briefly aired haunting footage of her dealer leaving her house in the morning, a few hours before Lovato’s assistant found her. “All of the daddy issues I had growing up, now I was literally discarded and abandoned. That amplified all of my Dad stuff,” Lovato says, adding that it became clear all of her “past traumas came to a head that night.”\n\nLooking back on the frightening night and surviving, Lovato says, “It was a nice reminder that it wasn’t my time.” Montgomery also shared that when the singer turned 28, they celebrated her surviving “the 27 club.” “She was where her father was, but she got through it.”\n\nThe first two episodes of Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil are available to stream now, with a new episode airing every Tuesday.\n\nIf you or anyone you know is struggling with mental health and substance abuse disorders, contact Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) by calling 1-800-622-HELP (4357).
