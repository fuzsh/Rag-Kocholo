        "text": "Abomination\n\nA male in his 20's is found murdered, in a pile of sheets. It's tough to get the identification of the victim. All Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni) have is an address in the West Village, traces of plaster on the body, as well as nylon in the sheets which is most likely the result of a faulty clothes dryer. The detectives show the victim's photo around gay bars in the Village, based on sexual evidence that he was with another man, and he's recognized because he was seen on posters for ReGenesis, a special interest group that tries to convert people from being gay to being straight. The victim is James Reed, and the people at ReGenesis are very saddened by his death. He was a member of the group but quit. Meanwhile, James had been getting horrible hate mail from Nebraska and at his funeral there is a protest led by Reverend Shaw (James Otis), who is based in Nebraska and thinks homosexuality is a sin."
