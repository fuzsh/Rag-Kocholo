        "text": "Barbra Streisand as Woody Allen?!\n\nBefore you laugh, remember that she pulled off a very passable Vincent Minnelli impression for her directing debut, 1984's \"Yentl,\" and that her follow-up, 1991's \"The Prince of Tides,\" had moments that were almost Hitchcockian.\n\nWith \"The Mirror Has Two Faces,\" director Streisand attempts that most hoary of cliches, the romantic comedy, and succeeds quite nicely, thank you.\n\nInstead of settling for sappy sentimentality (though the film is sentimental) or weepy melodrama (although it's melodramatic as well), she takes the high road - aiming for neurotically intelligent humor that is at least a little reminiscent of Allen's \"Manhattan\" and \"Annie Hall.\"\n\nAlso, Streisand - who's not exactly considered a \"classic beauty\" by Hollywood standards - tries to examine society's obsession with appearance, and not just on a superficial level.\n\nShe stars as Rose Morgan, an \"ugly duckling\" literature professor at Columbia University who's been living in the shadow of both her trampish, thrice-married sister Claire (Mimi Rogers) and her cosmetologist mother Hannah (Lauren Bacall, in an inspired bit of casting).\n\nEven though Rose believes in true romance - i.e., romance not based on sex but on genuine love - those beliefs are sorely tested when her handsome but insubstantial ex-boyfriend, Alex (Pierce Brosnan), marries Claire, who seems indifferent to the whole thing.\n\nBut Rose thinks her fortunes may have finally changed for the better when she meets Gregory Larkin (Jeff Bridges), a fellow professor who's been burned by his purely sexual flings. Gregory now wants to try a relationship for companionship reasons and suggests that he and Rose try a strictly platonic marriage.\n\nThings are swell at first, as the two share their intellectual pursuits, but not a bed. Complications arise, though, when Rose actually begins to fall in love with Gregory, but her feelings aren't returned (he says he's not attracted to her).\n\nConsequently, when Gregory leaves for Europe for a three-month speaking tour, Rose begins a gradual evolution - aided by a makeover from her mother and aerobic workouts - that show her the real consequences of being beautiful.\n\nScreenwriter Richard La-Gravanese (\"The Bridges of Madison County,\" \"A Little Princess\"), adapting the French film \"Le Miroir a Deux Faces,\" avoids cliched dialogue, even if some of the discussions of romance sound preachy at times. He's helped by Streisand the director, who plays things out on a small rather than overblown scale.\n\nActing-wise, Streisand is fine, bringing considerable charm and warmth to Rose. But Bridges really stands out as an academician who can't bring himself to share his emotions with another human being.\n\nAnd Bacall is marvelous, stealing scenes as the vainglorious mother who tries to take the spotlight from her daughters. Brosnan, Rogers and George Segal are all fine in supporting roles, although Brenda Vaccaro isn't given nearly enough to do as Rose's best friend.\n\n\"The Mirror Has Two Faces\" is rated PG-13 for profanity, including two obligatory utterances of that one word, some vulgar double-entendres and other humor and some outfits that reveal parts of Streisand and Bacall's anatomy that we'd probably prefer not to see."
