        "text": "20. CUTTER’S WAY (1981)\n\nDirector: Ivan Passer. Writer: Jeffrey Alan Fiskin. Starring John Heard, Lisa Eichorn, Ann Dusenberry.\n\n“Cutter’s Way” is a dark film that finds Bridges teamed with John Heard as friends trying to unravel a murder mystery. They become increasingly involved in the crime leading to tragedy for both characters. Sometimes called “Cutter and Bone” the film was barely released due to studio politics and even after it was released a bad review in the New York Times almost caused the film to be pulled from theaters. Strong reviews in other publications saved the film and let it play out its modest theatrical run.\n\n19. KING KONG (1976)\n\nDirector: John Guillermin. Writer: Lorenzo Semple Jr. Starring Jessica Lange, Charles Grodin, John Randolph.\n\nThis first remake of the original 1933 film classic though a box office smash was highly dumped on by critics and has developed a reputation as a bit of a disaster. Jessica Lange made her film debut in the film but doesn’t like to talk about the project and actually left the acting business for three years after the film’s release due to her embarrassment over it. The film does have its merits though on second viewing. The visuals feature lush scenes of Hawaii’s Na Pali coast and other scenery that helped earn the film an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography. Brigdes brings a lot of energy and romantic chemistry with Lange to his role as a paleontologist trying to save Kong and his scenes dismissing Lange’s character’s desire for fame are an interesting comment on our increasingly fame obsessed society. The final scenes which take place on the World Trade Center are poignant reminders of what used to be a part of the New York skyline.\n\n18. AGAINST ALL ODDS (1984)\n\nDirector: Taylor Hackford. Writers: Eric Hughes, Daniel Mainwaring. Starring Rachel Ward, James Woods, Alex Karras.\n\nBridges had one of his prime roles as a romantic leading man in this remake of the Robert Mitchum film “Out of the Past” a highly regarded filmnoir from 1947. Bridges plays an ex-football player hired to track down a gangster’s wife. The film’s title theme song sung by Phil Collins became a popular hit single an earned an Oscar nomination as Best Original Song. Unfortunately Collins wasn’t allowed to sing the song on the Oscar telecast. Instead the song was performed by dancer and actress Ann Reinking in one of those campy Oscar production numbers that drew jeers from television critics the next day.\n\n17. TRON (1981)\n\nDirector and writer: Steven Lisberger. Starring Bruce Boxleitner, David Warner, Barnard Hughes.\n\n“TRON” was a bit ahead of its time and was a box office disappointment on its initial release. The story of a computer programmer and game developer who gets stuck inside one of his own games gained interest as computers and gaming grew in popularity in recent years. Bridges would go on to reprise his original screen roll in the 2010 remake of the film.\n\n16. SEABISCUIT (2003)\n\nDirector and writer: Gary Ross. Starring Tobey Maguire, William H. Macy, Chris Cooper.\n\nSeven Oscar nominations including Best Picture went to this film about a racehorse that brought hope to people during the difficulties of the depression. Bridges leads the ensemble cast as the owner of the horse. While Bridges doesn’t really get to do anything in the film that we haven’t seen him do before it still is a solid performance on his resume.\n\n15. THE MIRROR HAS TWO FACES (1996)\n\nDirector: Barbra Streisand. Writer: Richard LaGravenese. Starring Barbra Streisand, Lauren Bacall, George Segal.\n\n“The Mirror Has Two Faces” was a bit of a flawed film and even well known perfectionist Barbra Streisand has admitted she is not totally happy with the way the film turned out. Streisand’s third time out as a director tells the story of a college professor sick of being hurt by the women in his life who decides to enter into a platonic relationship with an unattractive colleague of his. Streisand plays the unattractive woman who blossoms over the course of the film into an attractive looking woman who Bridges does fall in love with. The movie’s themes and points get a bit muddled but Bridges does well in a comic mode playing a highly intellectual professor who is also a bit of a doofus in parts of the film.\n\n14. THE MORNING AFTER (1986)\n\nDirector: Sidney Lumet. Writer:James Cresson. Starring Jane Fonda, Raul Julia, Diane Salinger.\n\nIf there is an under rated film on Bridges’ resume it is this one. The seemingly standard thriller is elevated by ace director Sidney Lumet’s strong hand and especially by the crackerjack performances from Jane Fonda and Bridges. Fonda plays a fading alcoholic actress who wakes up one morning in bed with a dead body. Bridges plays a former police officer whom Fonda encounters as she tries to flee the city. It is slowly revealed that Bridges too is an alcoholic who let his addiction screw up his career and family life. While Fonda has the flashier role and received a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance Bridges subtle low energy, depressed character is equally interesting and the two performances make what could have been a standard thriller into a highly touching depiction of two lost souls finding strength by coming together.\n\n13. JAGGED EDGE (1985)\n\nDirector: Richard Marquand. Writer: Joe Eszterhas. Starring Glenn Close, Robert Loggia, Peter Coyote.\n\nThis taut intricate thriller features Bridges as a man accused of murdering his wife. Glenn Close plays a lawyer who reluctantly agrees to defend him. She then proceeds to fall in lover with Bridges despite the fact that she is never completely sure of his innocence. Bridges gives a complex performance as a man we are never sure whether or not to believe. The film earned a Best Supporting Actor nomination for Robert Loggia as a detective and friend of the Close character.\n\n12. FEARLESS (1993)\n\nDirector: Peter Weir. Writer: Rafael Yglesias. Starring Rosie Perez, Isabella Rossellini, Tom Hulce.\n\n“Fearless” is a psychologically complex film about the trauma two people experience after surviving the crash of a major airliner. Rosie Perez earned an Oscar nomination as a woman whose baby died on the plane. Bridges character also survived the crash but has trouble coping with his feelings afterwards and resorts to daredevil and reckless behavior to ease his anxiety. Through his connection with Perez’ character the two find healing.\n\n11. TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS DREAM (1988)\n\nDirector: Francis Ford Coppola. Writers: Arnold Schulman, David Seidler. Starring Martin Landau, Joan Allen, Frederic Forrest.\n\nBridges plays Preston Tucker in this biopic. Tucker was a visionary car designer who tried desperately to create his own line of cars to compete with the big three automakers of the time. The film features a strong ensemble cast including Martin Landau. Landau was heavily favored to win the 1988 Best Supporting Actor award but ended up losing the award to surprise winner Kevin Kline for “A Fish Called Wanda.”\n\n10. THE LAST PICTURE SHOW (1971)\n\nDirector: Peter Bogdanovich. Writers: Larry McMurtry, Peter Bogdanovich. Starring Timothy Bottoms, Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn.\n\nBridges second film was this landmark 1971 film from director Peter Bogdanovitch. The film deals with a dying Texas town and its inhabitants most of whom are struggling with the hopelessness of life in rural Texas. The film received eight Oscar nominations including ones for Best Picture and Director. Its ensemble cast also received four nominations in the supporting categories for Ellen Burstyn, Cloris Leachman, Ben Johnson and 22 year old Bridges. Leachman and Johnson would go on to win the awards.\n\n9. HELL OR HIGH WATER (2016)\n\nDirector:David Mackenzie. Writer: Taylor Sheridan. Starring Ben Foster, Chris Pine, Dale Dickey.\n\nBridges received his seventh and most recent Oscar nomination this time as Best Supporting Actor. The film is a western in which Bridges plays a Texas Marshall close to retirement who is tracking two suspected bank robbers played by Chris Pine and Ben Foster. Surprisingly Foster won the Independent Spirit award for Best Supporting Actor but when Oscar nominations were announced he was excluded in favor of Bridges.\n\n8. TRUE GRIT (2010)\n\nDirectors and writers: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen. Starring Hailee Stenfeld, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin.\n\nIt seemed like a risky proposition to remake the beloved original version of “True Grit” which won an Oscar for John Wayne in 1969. While remakes abound nowadays it is rare that one rises to the level of the original. The Coen brothers managed to pull it off though and this version of the story went on to receive 10 Oscar nominations in all the major categories (Picture, Writing, Directing) as well as a Best Actor nomination for Bridges (who had just won the Best Actor award the previous year.)\n\n7. THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974)\n\nDirector and writer: Michael Cimino. Starring Clint Eastwood, Geoffrey Lewis, Gary Busey.\n\nBridges scored his second Best Supporting Actor nomination at the age of 25 for this story of two bank robbers. Eastwood plays the grizzled veteran robber while Bridges plays a quirky young partner Eastwood begins to work with. The nomination was a bit of a surprise for Bridges considering the genre of the film but his combination of youthful energy and offbeat comedic charm clearly made an impression on voters.\n\n6. THE CONTENDER (2000)\n\nDirector and writer: Rod Lurie. Starring Joan Allen, Gary Oldman, Sam Elliott.\n\nReleased shortly after the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal that led to President Clinton’s impeachment, this film reverses the roles and has a female politician accused of having an affair while in office. Played by Best Actress nominee Joan Allen, the woman is a US senator being considered for a Vice Presidential spot on the ticket when the allegations are made. Bridges plays the incumbent President who is looking for a new Vice President after the death of his previous one. Bridges also earned an Oscar nomination for this film this time as Best Supporting Actor.\n\n5. THE FISHER KING (1991)\n\nDirector: Terry Gilliam. Writer: Richard LaGravenese. Starring Robin Williams, Mercedes Ruehl, Amanda Plummer.\n\n“The Fisher King” is an elaborate film from director Terry Gilliam. As is usual with Gilliam’s films the movie features elaborate fantasy sequences although it is in actuality telling a very realistic story. Bridges plays a radio shock jock whose rants are blamed for causing a mass murder. Robin Williams earned a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his role as a homeless person who befriends the suicidal Bridges. Mercedes Ruehl won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role as Bridges long suffering girlfriend.\n\n4. THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS (1989)\n\nDirector and writer: Steve Kloves. Starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Beau Bridges, Jennifer Tilly.\n\nBridges teamed with his brother Beau Bridges for this story of two struggling lounge musicians and the singer they hire to front their act. Michelle Pfeiffer gave a highly acclaimed performance as the singer and pretty much swept all the precursor awards that year including the Golden Globe and all the major critics awards. She would end up losing the Oscar though to Jessica Tandy for “Driving Miss Daisy.” Bridges gives a solid performance also as the brother who falls in love with the singer.\n\n3. STARMAN (1984)\n\nDirector: John Carpenter. Writers: Bruce A. Evans, Raynold Gideon. Starring Karen Allen, Charles Martin Smith.\n\nDirector John Carpenter was mostly known for horror films such as “Halloween” when he directed this film so it was regarded as quite a change of pace for him. Bridges plays an alien life form that comes to earth in response to an invitation in the Voyager spacecraft which the US launched in 1977 inviting alien visitors to come to earth in peace. The alien appears in the home of a young widow and clones himself into the appearance of her late husband. The film provides Bridges with an incredible amount of acting opportunity as the alien learns to use his new body and communicate with the widow played by Karen Allen.\n\n2. CRAZY HEART (2009)\n\nDirector and writer: Scott Cooper. Starring Maggie Gyllenhaal, Colin Farrell.\n\nAfter five nominations spanning nearly forty years Bridges finally made it to the Oscar podium with this film about a faded country music star whose life has fallen apart due to alcohol abuse. He finds a brief moment of happiness with a romance with a young journalist (Oscar nominee Maggie Gyllenhaal) who is divorced with a young son. Robert Duvall plays a friend of Bridges who helps him get sober. It is interesting casting having Duvall in the film since Duvall won an Oscar as Best Actor for a similar role in 1983’s “Tender Mercies.”\n\n1. THE BIG LEBOWSKI (1998)\n\nDirector: Joel Coen. Writers Joel Coen, Ethan Coen. Starring John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi.\n\nA moderate hit upon its first release “The Big Lebowski” has evolved into a cult phenomenon with people holding screenings where the audience quotes the dialogue back to the screen. The cult group fans of the film call themselves “achievers” in response to the main character being somewhat of an underachiever. The New York Times praised Bridges performance saying “Mr. Bridges finds a role so right for him that he seems never to have been anywhere else. Watch this performance to see shambling executed with nonchalant grace and a seemingly out-to-lunch character played with fine comic flair.”"
