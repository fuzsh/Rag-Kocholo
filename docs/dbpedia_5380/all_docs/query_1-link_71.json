Streisand landed her first job as a nightclub singer in 1961 and just four years later was headlining on Broadway in the award-winning musical Funny Girl. Since then she has cut numerous albums, starred in motion pictures, and even directed and produced her own films. Harper’s Bazaar contributor J. Curtis Sanburn claims that Streisand has that special “star quality” that eludes all but the best entertainers. In her case, writes Sanburn, “star quality makes for a driven, creative dynamo; the biggest, most powerful performer in Hollywood. She’s big because she keeps building on her talent, and we respond with surprise and recognition each time she gives us something new, yet distinctly Barbra.”\n\nStreisand has admitted that she never wanted to be a singer—she preferred serious roles in straight drama. It was as a singer that she first attracted attention, however, and she remains one of the best-selling recording artists on the Columbia label. Her untrained but spectacular voice is instantly recognizable in a wide variety of musical styles, from old Broadway standards to pop and disco, to plaintive ballads like “Evergreen.” According to Burt Korall in the Saturday Review, it is Streisand’s manner—not her vocal prowess—that has distinguished her from other female singers. Korall claims that Streisand is not “musically motivated” or “inspired by the melodic line,” but rather an artist who “shapes songs by heeding the guidelines established in the lyrics. She works as an actress would.” Korall continues: “If anything, Miss Streisand brings to material an overabundance of emotion, a tendency to overstatement…. Fortunately, however, Miss Streisand often allows songs and experiences to speak to her. In turn she responds naturally to the emotions and thoughts elicited. Moving inward, alone with her feelings, she unfolds them in a touching, well-shaded, progressive way, as if savoring close contact with them. The show business flashiness recedes and the sensitive, warm person emerges.”\n\nBarbara Joan Streisand was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1942. By any standards, her childhood was unhappy—her father, a high-school literature teacher, died of an epileptic seizure when she was less than two, leaving the family without any income. Streisand grew up in her grandparents’ home, a lonely, resentful child, whose only doll was a hot-water bottle with a sweater wrapped around it. At fourteen she determined that she wanted to be an actress, and she began to cultivate a bohemian appearance and eccentric mannerisms to enhance her individuality. Streisand’s mother begged her to take typing classes, “just in case” acting would not support her, but the youngster refused to consider\n\nFor the Record…\n\nGiven name, Barbara Joan Streisand; born April 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, N. Y. ; daughter of Emanuel (a literature teacher) and Diana (Rosen) Streisand; married Elliott Gould (an actor), March, 1963 (divorced); children: Jason. Education: Graduated from Erasmus Hall High School (with honors), 1959; attended Yeshiva of Brooklyn.\n\nWorked as nightclub singer at the Bon Soir, New York, N.Y., 1960–61; had professional theatrical debut in An Evening with Henry Stoones, off-Broadway, 1961; made Broadway debut in musical I Can Get It for You Wholesale, 1962; recording artist with Columbia Records, 1962—; star of numerous television specials, including “My Name Is Barbra,” 1964. Film actress, producer, and director, 1968—, movies include Funny Girl, 1968, Hello, Dolly, 1969, The Owl and the Pussycat, 1970, What’s Up, Doc? 1972, Up the Sandbox, 1972, The Way We Were, 1973, For Pete’s Sake, 1974, Funny Lady, 1975, A Star Is Born (also producer), 1976, The Main Event, 1979, All Night Long, 1981, Y enti (also director and producer), 1983, Nuts, 1987.\n\nAwards: Academy Award for best actress, 1969, for Funny Girl, Academy Award for best song of the year (with Paul Williams), 1976, for “Evergreen” ; Grammy Awards for best female pop vocalist, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967, 1977, and 1986; recipient of special Tony Award, 1970.\n\nAddresses: 5775 Ramirez Canyon Rd., Malibu, CA 90265.\n\nthe possibility of failure in her chosen profession. After graduating with honors from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, Streisand moved to Manhattan, where she bunked with friends and literally sang for her supper in nightclubs and bistros. When someone suggested that her last name sounded “too Jewish,” she changed the spelling of her first name instead.\n\nIn 1961 Streisand won a talent contest at a Greenwich Village bar. That exposure led to her first regular engagement—at the Bon Soir, another Village club. There her innovative performances of “Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?” and “Happy Days Are Here Again” gained the attention of discriminating New York audiences. Soon she was appearing on local television shows and within a year she had a substantial part in a Broadway musical, “I Can Get It for You Wholesale.” The show ran nine months with Streisand as an unattractive secretary named Miss Marmelstein, and when it closed, the twenty-one-year-old singer found herself in great demand. She signed a recording contract with Columbia Records, and her first release, The Barbra Streisand Album, became 1963’s top-selling album by a female performer. She followed that success with The Second Barbra Streisand Album and The Third Barbra Streisand Album, both of which sold very well.\n\nThe lead role in the musical comedy Funny Girl assured Streisand’s ascent to superstardom. The Broadway show, produced in 1964, profiled the life of vaudeville comedienne Fanny Brice. In many respects it was the perfect vehicle for Streisand, combining comedy, drama, and several melodic songs. Streisand also appeared in the film version of Funny Girl, earning her first Academy Award for her work. A Newsweek reviewer calls Streisand’s portrayal of Brice “the most accomplished, original and enjoyable musical comedy performance ever put on film.” Capitol Records released the Funny Girl album in 1964; it was one of the few Broadway albums to be recorded live rather than in a studio.\n\nAs the 1970s progressed, Streisand moved more and more into film work and recording. Eventually, the encroachments on her privacy and a growing stage fright caused her to quit performing live shows. She managed to retain her superstar status, however, because many of her films did well at the box office, and her records continued to make the charts. In 1971 she had her first pop hit, “Stoney End,” a rousing song that marked a departure from her classic Broadway and torch-song repertory. Two years later she had her first hit-movie-hit-song combination with “The Way We Were,” a wistful ballad about parted lovers. The dual success was repeated in 1976 when she earned an Academy Award for the song “Evergreen,” (which she co-wrote with lyricist Paul Williams) from the film A Star Is Born, in which she played the lead. Both “Evergreen” and “The Way We Were” revealed a softer and more winsome Streisand sound, with an appeal that crossed generational lines.\n\nStreisand was one of the few mainstream stars to have a hit disco song, “The Main Event,” released in 1979. In that case, the song fared better than the film of the same title, starring Streisand and Ryan O’Neal. By the late 1970s, when “The Main Event” made the charts, Streisand was a near-recluse, protected by attack dogs and bodyguards from the many prying fans who annoyed her. She was beginning her research for Yentl, a film project that consumed her for a number of years. Before she began work on Yentl in earnest, she recorded an album with artist Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees. That record, Guilty, was one of her biggest sellers, and the title song reached number one on the Top 40 charts.\n\nYentl (1983) tells the story of a young Jewish girl who disguises herself as a boy in order to study the Talmud in a school. Not only did Streisand play the lead in the musical film, she also produced and directed the work. After spending so much time on the project—and after being rewarded with a good box-office draw—Streisand was greatly disappointed to be passed over for Academy Award nominations. In People magazine, Jeff Jarvis contends that a reputation for temperamental behavior on Streisand’s part has alienated the Hollywood establishment, while her accomplishments spark jealousy. Streisand answered her critics in a Ladies’ Home Journal profile. “I used to apologize for being a perfectionist,” she said. “Now I don’t. I do care about every detail. That’s the way I operate…. People who like working for me want to be pushed, want to be stretched. And people who don’t like working for me, I guess, don’t.”\n\nAs Streisand continues her dual acting and singing careers, she still refuses to perform live. She hardly needs to—Nuts, her 1987 film with Richard Dreyfuss, was a critical and commercial success, and her 1986 Columbia release, The Broadway Album, brought a poignant West Side Story song to the charts. Now in her forties, Streisand is reported to be one of the highest-paid women performers in history, with lifetime earnings in excess of $100 million. The entertainer prides herself on her artistic integrity, her perfectionism, and her constant quest for innovation. “As you get older, you realize your mortality,” she told Ladies’ Home Journal. “So I’d like to do everything I can to avoid being an old person who says, Why didn’t I do that? Why didn’t I take that chance?”\n\nSelected discography\n\nThe Barbra Streisand Album, Columbia, 1963.\n\nThe Second Barbra Streisand Album, Columbia, 1963.\n\nThe Third Barbra Streisand Album, Columbia, 1964.\n\nFunny Girl, Capitol, 1964.\n\nPeople, Columbia, 1965.\n\nMy Name Is Barbra, Columbia, 1965.\n\nJe m’appelle Barbra, Columbia, 1966.\n\nColor Me Barbra, Columbia, 1966.\n\nSimply Streisand, Columbia, 1967.\n\nStoney End, Columbia, 1971.\n\nBarbra Joan Streisand, Columbia, 1972.\n\nLive Concert at the Forum, Columbia, 1972.\n\nThe Way We Were, Columbia, 1974.\n\nA Star Is Born, Columbia, 1976.\n\nStreisand Superman, Columbia, 1977.\n\nWet, Columbia, 1979.\n\n(With Barry Gibb) Guilty, Columbia, 1980.\n\nYentl, Columbia, 1983.\n\nEmotion, Columbia, 1984.\n\nThe Broadway Album, Columbia, 1986.\n\nAlso recorded Butterfly, A Christmas Album, Classical Barbra, Happening in Central Park, Lazy Afternoon, Memories, Songbird, and What about Today?\n\nSources\n\nBooks\n\nStambler, Irwin, Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock and Soul, St. Martin’s, 1974.\n\nPeriodicals\n\nEsquire, October, 1982; April, 1985.\n\nHarper’s Bazaar, November, 1983.\n\nLadies’ Home Journal, August, 1979; January, 1988; June, 1988.\n\nNewsweek, January 5, 1970.\n\nPeople, January 3, 1983; December 12, 1983; March 12, 1984; March 10, 1986.\n\nSaturday Review, January 11, 1969.\n\nWorking Woman, March, 1986.\n\n—Anne Janette Johnson\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nSinger, songwriter\n\nDebuted on Broadway\n\nYentl Producer, Director, and Star\n\nMillennium Farewell Concert\n\nSelected discography\n\nSources\n\nThe multitalented Barbra Streisand has made her mark as an actress, a singer, and a comedienne in a career spanning four decades.

At the turn of the millennium, she appeared to a sold-out crowd of 12, 477 spectators at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. With tickets priced over $1,000, it was the highest single concert box-office take ever, grossing $14,694,750. A follow-up concert video, Timeless: Live in Concert, was televised in 2001. This event, billed officially as a farewell concert, earned an Emmy Award for the singer, although she made subsequent appearances and sang in an unscheduled performance at the Emmy Awards in November of 2001.

Her career has been long, unusual, and incredibly successful, despite the fact that for such a major star, she has a relatively short list of film credits. During the late seventies and eighties when men overwhelmingly dominated the American box office, Streisand was, for the most part, the only woman consistently considered bankable, that is, a performer who could make a project happen. And having directed only three films, she has become one of the most powerful directors in Hollywood as well. In short, Streisand is an industry to herself: a director, a producer, a concert performer, a recording star, and an actress who could secure virtually any part she chooses. She is one of the few performers who has won all four major American entertainment awards: the Emmy for television work, the Grammy for music recording, the Tony for the Broadway stage, and the Academy award for film work. Incredibly, she has even won several awards for composing music. Despite her achievements, criticism of Streisand has always been centered on two fronts: first, charges of egotism and self-centeredness which her defenders reject as actually representing her perfectionism; and second, her choice of projects, many of which have been rather safe vehicles that have not especially stretched her abilities as performer.\n\nStreisand's first screen appearance was in the role she originated on Broadway, Fanny Brice in the film Funny Girl. In Funny Girl Streisand established the persona which she was to express, with only slight variation, in a series of vehicles over the next several years: an unattractive woman, generally with Jewish vocal inflections, intelligence, ego, and humor, who disarms all about her and is able to transform herself into the successful and morally superior creature who is the romantic object of a Gentile man's affections. In Funny Girl, Streisand's energy was overwhelming, indeed threatening. Her slightly crossed eyes and long, crooked nose proved no impediment to her triumphant announcement, in her first film, that \"I'm the greatest star. . . .\" Along with Dustin Hoffman, Streisand was one of the new generation of Hollywood stars who refused to change their names, get plastic surgery, or conform to the conventional Hollywood stereo-types of attractiveness. That Streisand became a star at all, looking as she did, is itself a sign of her enormous talent: the strong singing voice, the comic timing, the photogenic face, the considerable onscreen charisma. To say that Streisand forced the Hollywood community and American moviegoers to reevaluate their concepts of beauty would not really be an overstatement. For her first film, Hollywood awarded Streisand an Academy Award, though in a tie with Katharine Hepburn—a symbol, as it were, of Streisand's uneasy alliance with Hollywood, a community that fears and respects her, but does not, apparently, love her with the kind of fervor they reserve for her more conventional male counterparts.\n\nFunny Girl was followed by two musicals, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, and the highly underrated Hello, Dolly! Her performance as Dolly Levi was controversial at the time for its tongue-in-cheek synthesis of Vivien Leigh and Mae West mannerisms. The film's climax is in a restaurant filled with patrons contemplating Streisand's beauty (rather than her talent), a concept that would have been unthinkable only several years earlier. A series of comedies harkening back to the screwball era followed, including What's Up, Doc?, in which Streisand wooed the blond WASP Ryan O'Neal, For Pete's Sake, in which Streisand starred opposite the pretty Michael Sarrazin, and The Owl and the Pussycat, in which Streisand plays opposite George Segal, and gives what many feel is her most energetic and inspired comic performance. At least two films in this period indicated untapped wells of dramatic abilities: the commercially unsuccessful feminist comedy Up the Sandbox, in which Streisand quietly and naturalistically plays a mother contemplating another pregnancy, and The Way We Were. The latter, which starred Streisand opposite blonde WASP superstar Robert Redford, was an incredibly successful and romantic film. The pairing evoked the kind of chemistry generally associated with the greatest stars of the past, such as Gable and Crawford. Streisand's persona was fundamentally the same: the awkward, ugly duckling who becomes the romantic object of a handsome man's affections. When Redford and Streisand divorce at the end of the film, it is Streisand who is morally righteous. In the three decades since the release of The Way We Were, the film looks increasingly like a great Hollywood classic, valorized and remembered, its images and sounds srongly reverberating in our national consciousness, a love story that one can put alongside Casablanca as an immortal icon of American identity.\n\nStreisand followed The Way We Were with a series of films attacked by many for being lazy, self-indulgent, or redundant: another comedy called The Main Event; a sequel to Funny Girl, entitled Funny Lady, in which Streisand gets to reject Omar Sharif, reversing the pattern of the original; and an almost universally reviled but commercially successful remake of A Star Is Born. The latter, like Funny Girl and Funny Lady, chronicles the rise to fame of Streisand in a narrative that also chronicles the decline and moral inferiority of the handsome man with whom she becomes involved.\n\nYentl definitely ushered in a new era for Streisand and her career. The story of a young Jewish woman who masquerades as a man in order to study the Talmud, this quasi-musical (in an era when the film musical had been long considered as extinct as the dinosaur) was directed and produced by Streisand. Although most critics were prepared to accuse Streisand of total self-centeredness, Yentl's genuine and ostensible quality, for the most part, disarmed them. Certainly Streisand the director is by no means self-indulgent with Streisand the star: close-ups of Streisand do not automatically reveal the actress's \"good\" (left) side; occasionally, the star will even be photographed out of focus so the director can emphasize something else within the frame. The film's cinematography is extraordinary. In Yentl, director Streisand reveals a fetching sensitivity, an interest in androgyny (which would foreshadow her interest in gay and lesbian issues in the nineties), and a profoundly lyrical sensuality. Unlike A Star Is Born, Yentl seems organically unified, with all facets of production working in harmony toward one artistic end. For the first time, Streisand's love interest is as Jewish as she and not morally inferior. Much sympathy (as well as screen time) is extended to the secondary female lead in the film as well—another break with the patterns of Streisand's past films.\n\nIn 1991, Streisand both directed and acted in Prince of Tides, a deviously entertaining love story-cum-melodrama in the style of the classic women's films of the forties and fifties, updated with subtlety and intelligence to deal head-on with a variety of current issues, most notably childhood sexual abuse and the socially prescribed gender roles for men and women. To the surprise of many, including Streisand, the film turned into a huge event, winning the enthusiastic approbation of an emotionally moved public and significant critical raves. Streisand garnered sensitive performances from her son, Jason Gould, who played her on-screen son, and particularly from macho Nick Nolte, whose key scene required him to break down emotionally to childlike vulnerability as he admits to having been raped as a young boy. The negative backlash to the film was, unfortunately, muddled in sexism: criticism of Streisand's having photographed herself in a glamorous way (with no criticism of director Streisand having photographed Nolte similarly), accusations against the genre of melodrama as inherently unworthy (except to the extent that its focus is on male characters), and so forth. That the film received seven Academy award nominations, but again not one for Streisand, its director and star, became a matter for such public comment that Streisand became the de facto, acclaimed director of the year.\n\nFrom 1992, Streisand worked on a variety of projects: particularly her long-awaited return to live performance—her first in over twenty-five years—via a triumphantly successful concert tour. Notably, the tour was itself marked by Streisand's expanded political consciousness: notably absent were many of the \"lonely-woman-as-victim\" songs that had made Streisand famous. Streisand also became increasingly involved in feminist issues, AIDS research and education, and children's rights. Although always politically active and socially conscious in the past (particularly through her philanthropic Streisand Foundation), Streisand transformed herself into Hollywood's leading liberal spokesperson, notably giving a very public and controversial speech against Colorado legislation designed to prevent civil rights protection to gays and lesbians, in the process cementing a tourism boycott against the entire state. Similarly, Streisand has been vocal in her support for the beleaguered President Clinton.\n\nAfter co-producing, with Glenn Close, a successful Emmy award-winning TV movie on homophobia in the military, Serving in Silence: The Margarethe Cammermeyer Story, Streisand finally abandoned her long-cherished project of directing Larry Kramer's angry exposé of government inaction during the first wave of the AIDS epidemic, The Normal Heart. This abandonment, after having kept the optioned property away from other potential producers for so many years, angered Kramer and garnered negative publicity for Streisand, which perhaps contributed to the markedly tepid reaction to her \"replacement\" project (on a less overtly important subject), The Mirror Has Two Faces.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, although a Hollywood entertainment, The Mirror Has Two Faces is amazingly ambitious, synthesizing the genres of traditional romantic comedy with the mother/daughter melodrama. Streisand's hybrid, which works as a kind of ideological re-invention, miraculously avoiding all the sexist claptrap endemic to both genres, managed to attract a large, popular audience in an era in which \"feminism\" had been turned into a dirty word. Streisand's exploration of romantic vs. courtly love is a testament to the political resolve of its director's obsessive work with screenwriter Richard Lagravanese. Streisand also takes the role of Rose, and the cinematography glows with an appropriate pink burnish, its art direction witty and inspired. That The Mirror Has Two Faces was under-esteemed by both Hollywood and the critical community suggests that the film's very real intellectual achievements were, like the proverbial purloined letter, not particularly noticed, if nevertheless in plain sight. A witty, deft comedy filled with compassion (based, oddly enough, on a French film by André Cayatte), The Mirror Has Two Faces offers warm performances by Streisand and her co-star Jeff Bridges, as well as generous opportunities for a supporting cast headed by Lauren Bacall.\n\nIncluding references to It Happened One Night, Brief Encounter, and particularly, Now Voyager (with its tortured mother/daughter relationship, theme of female transformation, and iconography of cigarette smoking as the epitome of romantic chic), The Mirror Has Two Faces at times is rather reflexive. The truth about lasting love, contends Bridges, is that unlike lovers in the movies, \"we don't hear music when we kiss.\" Later, when the stars kiss for the first time, romantic soundtrack music is notably absent. Amazingly for a Hollywood film, Bridges falls in love with Streisand not because of her looks or sexual allure, but because of \"your mind, your humor, your passion for ideas.\" Streisand's eventual physical transformation—which takes place after she and Bridges have already married—turns out to be laudably irrelevant: wittily, Bridges prefers her appearance pre-transformation. \"I don't care if you are pretty,\" offers Bridges, \"I love you anyway.\" The final fade-out kiss on the streets of New York suggests a feminist correction of the final scene of The Way We Were. Although this kiss is accompanied by Puccini (Streisand's metaphor for how it feels to be in love), Turandot is presented as source music from an apartment above, rather than as extra-diegetic comment.\n\nEnergized by her feminism and political activism, and now the most visible role model for Hollywood women interested in social change through art or grassroots political action, Streisand has effectively shut down her career as an actress-for-hire. Whereas once one might have looked forward to Streisand in a Bergman film (who once had wanted to cast her), or in a Scorsese film, or even in a Woody Allen film, it is clear that Streisand's future projects will continue to be carefully chosen and painstakingly produced in the service of her own artistic vision. Perhaps one emotional climax to her career is the Lifetime Achievement Award given her by the Foreign Press Association (Golden Globes), whose ceremony in 2000 was marked by a Streisand testament and climaxed by her unusually intelligent and inspiring speech, which strongly emphasized the integrity of the \"work\" itself as the supreme value for all artists, even those working in Hollywood.\n\n—Charles Derry\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nFor over 30 years, award-winning American performer Barbra Streisand (born 1942) has been performing and singing on the stage, television and in motion pictures, as well as recording popular music.\n\nBarbara Joan Streisand was born on April 24, 1942 in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York to Emanuel and Diana (Rosen) Streisand. Her father, a high school English teacher, died when Streisand was only 15 months old leaving her mother to raise both her and her older brother, Sheldon. Her mother soon found work as a secretary in the New York public school system and re-married in the late 1940s. Streisand felt rebuffed by her mother and step-father, Lou Kind, a used-car salesman, and attributes many of her personality characteristics to those early experiences. She graduated at age 16 from Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn and moved to Manhattan where she shared an apartment with friends working various jobs hoping to perform on Broadway.\n\nBroadway Debut\n\nOn October 21, 1961, Streisand, who had changed the spelling of her first name upon moving to Manhattan, made her off-Broadway debut in Another Evening with Harry Stoones, which opened and closed the same night. She then went on to other short-lived off-Broadway productions and became friends with Barry Dennen. Both shared an admiration for the Ziegfield Follies star Fannie Brice, and Streisand, with Dennen's help, crafted a nightclub show around many of Brice's musical numbers. She began performing her act in small nightclubs in Manhattan like the Bon Soir, shaping her act and her voice.\n\nIt was while she was performing at the Blue Angel, a showcase for young talent, that she was spotted by a Broadway producer who signed Streisand for the part of Miss Marmelstein in a production of I Can Get It For You Whole-sale. The production opened in March of 1962 and ran for nine months and produced a very well-received cast album. Streisand appeared on both I Can Get It For You Whole-sale-Original Broadway Cast Recording as well as Pins and Needles-25th Anniversary Edition of the Hit Musical Revue in 1962 and, with the popularity of her stage role, was an almost overnight success.\n\nBuoyed by the popularity of her stage role, Streisand was signed by Columbia records and recorded The BarbraStreisand Album and The Barbra Streisand Second Album in 1963. Both albums were very successful, and The Barbra Streisand Album won Streisand a Grammy for both album of the year and best female vocal. She followed up with The Barbra Streisand Third Album and took the role of Fanny Brice in a production of Funny Girl in 1964, winning the role over more experienced stage actors like Anne Bancroft and Mary Martin. This production became one of the most successful stage productions in the history of Broadway and her performance in it would win her first of many Golden Globe Awards. The album Funny Girl-Original Broadway Cast Recording, was followed by People. People would become one of Streisand's highest-selling albums, and earn her a third Grammy Award.\n\nTelevision Success\n\nNot content to be successful in only two mediums, Streisand next took aim at television. My Name Is Barbra aired in 1965 and its follow-up Color Me Barbra followed in 1966. Her third of these one woman television shows, The Belle of 14th Street, aired in 1967 and was shown in Europe in addition to North America. In 1968, she performed live to an adoring audience. The performance, A Happening in Central Park, was shown on television and was as successful as the three specials that had gone before. She would win a Grammy Award for her performance in My Name Is Barbra and two Antoinette Perry Awards.\n\nAll of these specials would be re-released as albums and would establish her at the young age of 26 as the largest selling diva of popular standards since Judy Garland. Throughout this period she released Harold Sings Arlen and Je M'appelle Barbra in 1966. Simply Streisand and A Christmas Album were released in 1967 and in 1969, she released What About Today?\n\nStreisand would appear in eight television specials between 1969 and 1986. Barbra Streisand … and Other Musical Instruments (1973), Funny Girl to Funny Lady (1975), Barbra Streisand: With One More Look At You (1977), Getting in Shape for The Main Event (1979), A Film Is Born: The Making of Yentl (1983), Putting It Together: The Making of The Broadway Album (1986), and One Voice (1986) were all very popular and endeared Streisand to fans around the world. Barbra: The Concert aired in 1994 and 1995 and earned her two more Emmy Awards for Best Individual Performance and Best Variety or Music Special.\n\nMotion Picture Success\n\nThis seemingly overnight success continued throughout 1968 as she continued to release albums and perform her concerts. She reprised her role as Fanny Brice for the 1968 film version of Funny Girl and in 1969 appeared as Dolly Levi in the motion picture Hello, Dolly! These performances would earn her another Golden Globe Award and her performance in Funny Girl earned her an Academy Award as the best actress of 1968. On A Clear Day You Can See Forever and The Owl and the Pussycat were released in 1970 and she would win a Golden Globe Award for these performances as she was voted Best Female World Film Favorite.\n\nDirector and Producer\n\nAfter the success of Funny Girl, Streisand began to concentrate more on motion pictures than on live performances. She would appear in What's Up, Doc? and Up the Sandbox in 1972 before garnering critical acclaim for her work in The Way We Were opposite Robert Redford in 1973. She won another Golden Globe Award for this role. Her portrayal could have been a case of art imitating life as she was divorced from her husband Elliot Gould in 1971 after eight years of marriage and one son, Jason. She starred in For Pete's Sake and Funny Lady before her 1976 movie A Star Is Born. The movie and her rendition of the theme song, \"Evergreen, \" earned her a second Academy Award, two Grammy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. The film was one of the highest grossing of that year despite being panned by critics who believed Streisand was executing too much control as she was listed in the credits as not only the star, executive producer and co-songwriter, but also as the wardrobe consultant and the designer of 'musical concepts.'\n\nStreisand would take yet another leap in her creative life when she decided to direct, produce, and star in Yentl in 1983. After The Main Event (1979) and All Night Long (1981) Streisand was eager to make the story that she had read in 1968 into a movie. Filmed in Eastern Europe, Yentl was the story of a female masquerading as a male to overcome traditional orthodox Jewish privileges. The film earned more than $35 million but it would be four years before she appeared in another film.\n\nStreisand's role in Nuts (1987), opposite Richard Dreyfuss, is the story of a high-class prostitute who must go through a competency hearing to determine if she is sane enough to stand trial for manslaughter. Most critics disliked the film which Streisand produced, but some called it her best work ever. The more dramatic role prepared her for the tension and emotion that she displayed in her next role. In The Prince of Tides (1991) Streisand, opposite Nick Nolte, not only starred, but directed and co-produced the film. The film was nominated for several Academy Awards including the award for best picture. The New York Times commented that \"Nothing about Barbra Streisand's previous acting or directing is preparation for her expert handling of The Prince of Tides.\" Streisand was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for directing, but not for an Academy Award, which angered many. She was seemingly unaffected, as she went on to star in The Mirror Has Two Faces, opposite Jeff Bridges in 1996. She earned Golden Globe Award nominations for \"Best Original Song\" and \"Best Actress-Comedy or Musical\" for this film.\n\nTop of the Charts\n\nDespite performing in motion pictures and on television throughout the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Streisand never ceased releasing albums. After Funny Girl-Original Broadway Cast Recording, there would be almost 40 Streisand albums released. In 1981, she won a Grammy Award for best pop duo for \"Guilty, \" a duet with Barry Gibb, that became her sixth all-time highest selling single. Over the years she has recorded other duets with performers as diverse as Bryan Adams, Don Johnson, Neil Diamond, Kim Carnes, Johnny Mathis and Michael Crawford.\n\nAfter receiving a death threat in 1967, Streisand developed stage fright and stopped doing public concerts. She commented to Susan Price of Ladies Home Journal, \"You don't get over stage fright-you just don't perform.\" However, new friendships seemed to have a positive impact. In the early 1990s, she began to grow closer to her mother and became friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton. According to Kim Hubbard of People, \"She forged a warm friendship with Virginia Kelley, President Clinton's mother, and conquered performance fear by taking the stage in Vegas on New Year's Eve '93.\" Hubbard added that \"Kelley's death from breast cancer just days after attending the show forced Streisand to take stock.\" Streisand did a world tour in 1994, starting in London and ending in New York City. Her shows were some of the highest-grossing concerts of the year.\n\nStreisand became engaged to actor James Brolin in early 1997. They divide their time between homes in Malibu and Beverly Hills, California. She has given concerts to help benefit political candidates and charities that benefit social causes such as AIDS research. Her \"Streisand Foundation, \" was established in 1992 to help advocate women's rights, civil liberties and environmental protection.\n\nShe released Higher Ground in November of 1997 and it immediately became number one on the Billboard chart. It set a record for the greatest span of time between a performer's first and most recent number one albums at 33 years. The first single released from the album, \"Tell Him, \" a duet with Celine Dion, was immediately a Top 40 hit and was nominated for a Grammy Award. Streisand has recorded 54 albums and has collected an overwhelming collection of 39 gold LP's, 25 platinum LP's and 12 multi-platinum LP's. She was the first person to win an Academy Award, an Emmy Award, a Grammy Award, and an Antoinette Perry Award. She is also the only person to have won an Academy Award for both acting and songwriting.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nAmerican Film, January-February 1992.\n\nChicago Tribune, December 5, 1982.\n\nLadies Home Journal, February 1992; July 1994.\n\nMcCall's, September 1997.\n\nNational Review, March 20, 1995.\n\nNew Yorker, January 27, 1992.\n\nNew York Times, December 22, 1991; December 25, 1991.\n\nPeople, November 17, 1997; November 24, 1997; December 8, 1997; March 9, 1998.\n\nWashington Post, December 22, 1991.\n\n\"Barbra Streisand, \" Internet Movie Databank,http://us.imdb.com (May 11, 1998).\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nBorn: April 24, 1942\n\nBrooklyn, New York\n\nAmerican actress, singer, songwriter, director, and producer\n\nBarbra Streisand is an award-winning performer on stage, television, and in motion pictures, as well as a recording artist of popular music.\n\nYounger years\n\nBarbara Joan Streisand was born on April 24, 1942, in Brooklyn, New York, to Emanuel and Diana (Rosen) Streisand.
