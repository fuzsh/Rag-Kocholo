        "text": "With Golden Globe nominations for Unorthodox, created and written by Anna Winger '93CC, and Nomadland, based on the book by Jessica Bruder '04JRN, hopes are high that two more alumni-affiliated productions will join our list of Columbia winners.\n\nGreen Book (2018)\n\nBest Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy, Best Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor\n\nAfter a career defined by farcical comedies like Dumb and Dumber and There’s Something About Mary, director and screenwriter Peter Farrelly ’86SOA channeled his more serious side with this dramedy about an African-American concert pianist and his white chauffeur navigating Jim Crow laws in the 1960s. In addition to winning best picture and best screenplay, the film also landed Mahershala Ali a Globe for best supporting actor.\n\nThe Disaster Artist (2017)\n\nBest Actor\n\nJames Franco ’11SOA won best actor for this comedy based on the life of eccentric filmmaker Tommy Wiseau, whose 2003 cult classic, The Room, is generally considered one of the worst movies ever made. Franco, who stars as Wiseau, also directed and produced The Disaster Artist.\n\nMoonlight (2016)\n\nBest Motion Picture — Drama\n\nThis art-house feature about Black identity, which was executive produced by Dede Gardner ’90CC and co-produced by Veronica Nickel ’10SOA, became an unexpected awards-season hit when it won both a Golden Globe and Oscar for best picture.\n\nZootopia (2016)\n\nBest Animated Feature Film\n\nThis anthropomorphic comedy adventure, with a screenplay written by Phil Johnston ’04SOA and a story developed by Jennifer Lee ’05SOA, took home the coveted Globe for best animated feature film. (Johnston and fellow Columbia alum Jenny Slate ’04CC voice the roles of a fox and sheep, respectively.)\n\nThe Honourable Woman (2014)\n\nBest Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film\n\nThough she’s better known for her film work, actress Maggie Gyllenhaal ’99CC won a Golden Globe television award for this BBC drama, in which she plays a British humanitarian worker who happens to run an arms business in the Middle East.\n\n12 Years a Slave (2013)\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\nAs the president of Plan B Entertainment, Dede Gardner ’90CC has produced a number of provocative Hollywood prestige films such as Moonlight, The Big Short and Selma. It was 12 Years a Slave, a historical drama directed by Steve McQueen, that won her producing team their first Golden Globe (and Oscar) for best picture.\n\nFrozen (2013)\n\nBest Animated Feature Film\n\nThis mega Disney hit, which was written and co-directed by Jennifer Lee ’05SOA, won the Golden Globe for best animated feature and spawned a sequel, several hit songs, a Broadway musical, and a very lucrative licensing business.\n\nThe Kids are All Right (2010)\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress\n\nFrom writer-director Lisa Cholodenko ’97SOA, this comedy about a lesbian couple, their teenage children, and their former sperm donor was one of the first mainstream movies to deal with same-sex parents. It won a Golden Globe for best picture and landed Annette Bening an award for best actress.\n\nWalk the Line (2005)\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress, Best Actor\n\nA biopic of legendary singer-songwriters Johnny Cash and June Carter, this drama directed by James Mangold ’99SOA won a Golden Globe for best picture. Stars Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon were also named best actor and best actress.\n\nDeath of a Salesman (2000)\n\nBest Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture for TV\n\nThis televised performance of the 1949 play by Arthur Miller starred Brian Dennehy ’60CC as the title salesman and led to a Golden Globe for his performance.\n\nBreaking Away (1979)\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nThis coming-of-age sports film about four Indiana teenagers who get involved in bicycle racing, written by Steve Tesich ’67GSAS, was lauded by critics at the time of its release and won a Golden Globe for best picture.\n\nA Touch of Class (1973)\n\nBest Actor, Best Actress\n\nIn a highlight of his sixty-year screen career, George Segal ’55CC, now a star of the ABC sitcom The Goldbergs, received a best-actor award for his performance in this 1973 rom-com. Glenda Jackson, the film’s other romantic lead, won best actress.\n\nFiddler on the Roof (1971)\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actor\n\nBronx native Joseph Stein ’39SW, a graduate of Columbia’s School of Social Work, worked as a psychiatric social worker for several years before he pivoted to a career in comedy and playwriting. His book for Fiddler on the Roof won him two Tonys, and the film adaptation — for which he wrote the screenplay — went on to earn a Golden Globe for best picture. Chaim Topol also won best actor for playing Tevye.\n\nThe Apartment (1960)\n\nBest Motion Picture — Comedy, Best Actor, Best Actress\n\nViewed from the work-from-home era, The Apartment, written by Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond ’41CC, is a bittersweet throwback to the world of bustling offices, cubicle farms, and crowded elevators. The film won the Golden Globe for best picture, and stars Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine were both recognized for their performances.\n\nSome Like It Hot (1959)\n\nBest Motion Picture — Comedy, Best Actor, Best Actress\n\nAlso co-written by I. A. L. Diamond ’41CC and also starring Jack Lemmon, this Billy Wilder classic set in the roaring twenties is about two male jazz musicians who disguise themselves in drag and join an all-women band. Lemmon won his first of four Golden Globes for acting, and Marilyn Monroe, who plays a sizzling vocalist, earned an award for best actress.\n\nGuys and Dolls (1955)\n\nBest Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy, Best Actress\n\nAdapted from the 1950 Broadway show of the same name, this musical film from Joseph L. Mankiewicz ’28CC, which stars Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra as underground gamblers, won a Golden Globe for best picture. Jean Simmons swept the award for best actress for playing Brando’s love interest, a Christian missionary.\n\nAll About Eve (1950)\n\nBest Screenplay – Motion Picture"
