        "text": "Notice the elegance of the proof.\n\nIt's beautiful!\n\nIt reminds me\n\nof a quote from Socrates:\n\n\"If measure and symmetry are absent\n\nfrom any composition, -\n\n- the ruin awaits both the\n\ningredients and the composition.\"\n\n\"Measure and symmetry are beauty\n\nand virtue the world over.\"\n\n- Do you think he's straight?\n\n- Yeah, he's too boring to be gay.\n\n- Is it 5:\n\n15?\n\n- Yes, it is.\n\nThank you ...\n\nI'm releasing you a half hour early\n\ntoday. I have ... an appointment.\n\nI'm giving a lecture on my new book\n\ntonight. You are all welcome.\n\nThank you.\n\nRose, get that mask off your face.\n\nIt'll clog your pores.\n\nYou're going to be late.\n\nIt's almost seven o'clock.\n\nYou bum! Three million dollars\n\na year! For what?\n\nCome on.\n\nJust one more out.\n\n- Barry Neufeld.\n\n- Hi, it's Rose.\n\nHi ... Not again.\n\nI think it's an allergic reaction\n\nto something I ate.\n\n- My throat's starting to close up.\n\n- It sounds like you're dying.\n\n- Sure you're not allergic to me?\n\n- That's a terrible thing to think!\n\nEvery Manhattan restaurant hates me\n\nfor not keeping reservations.\n\nWhy don't you call me next week?\n\nIf you still want to.\n\n- Feel better.\n\n- Thank you. Bye.\n\n- Should I start with a joke?\n\n- No, there's not enough time.\n\n- For what?\n\n- To develop a sense of humour.\n\nAnd now, ladies and gentlemen,\n\nthe author of \"Absolute Truth\", -\n\n- Columbia's very own\n\nProfessor Gregory Larkin.\n\nYou're going to be fine.\n\nThank you. I'm honoured by this\n\nwarm and gracious welcome.\n\nBeing here, at the end of a journey,\n\nI'm reminded of Descartes' words:\n\n\"Whether I am awake or asleep, two\n\nand three will always make five.\"\n\n\"It does not seem possible that\n\nsuch a truth can be questioned.\"\n\nThis book has taken me\n\nover 14 years to write.\n\nIt is with sadness I say goodbye\n\nto it consuming my days and nights.\n\nAnd nights ...\n\nAnd as I stand here ...\n\nIn coming up ...\n\nsumming up ...\n\nExcuse me,\n\nI'm feeling a little dizzy.\n\nI thought it would feel differently.\n\nI thought I'd know more. I don't.\n\nI don't know anything, really.\n\nThank you all for coming.\n\nWhat did I say?\n\nIt was fine, though you shouldn't\n\nwork for a suicide hotline.\n\n- You did fine until Candice came.\n\n- Don't start. I just forgot to eat.\n\nIt's natural. She left you what,\n\na year ago?\n\nThank God Candy left when she did,\n\nor I'd never have finished the book.\n\nYou're a guy who can't have sex\n\nand chew gum at the same time.\n\nWhen I'm with someone, I tend\n\nto get a little sidetracked.\n\n- 14 years? Is that sidetracked?\n\n- I bet she's still out there.\n\nIf I know Candice, she's out there.\n\nShe's out there.\n\nFace her like a grown-up.\n\n- Don't let me go home with her.\n\n- It would be odd not to invite ...\n\nJust don't let me go home with her.\n\nAre you all right?\n\n- It was the stupid wine. Hello.\n\n- You look great.\n\nI hope you don't mind me showing up\n\nlike this on your big night.\n\nIt's just that I've been\n\nthinking so much about you lately.\n\n- Do you want to go get a drink?\n\n- I'd better not.\n\n- A bite to eat?\n\n- No, I'm not hungry.\n\n- Do you want me to take you home?\n\n- Okay.\n\n- Good to see you, Henry.\n\n- But Greg ...\n\n- Don't leave. Aren't you staying?\n\n- Well, we're done.\n\n- I still have feelings for you.\n\n- But I dumped you for another man.\n\n- And I'm still sort of with Paul.\n\n- I thought that was over.\n\nHe cheated. I wanted to feel better\n\nabout myself before I see him.\n\n- That's why you're here?\n\n- Well, yeah.\n\nYou were always a nice guy.\n\nBut let's face it, -\n\n- we've nothing in common except\n\nsex, and the fact you idolize me.\n\nI really do care for you.\n\n- I just can't wind up with you.\n\n- Can I call you sometime?\n\nWhat for?\n\n- Are you going?\n\n- No, I cancelled.\n\nWhat do you want to do for dinner?\n\nMake that pasta with artichokes.\n\nLater we can figure out what to do\n\nwith your hair for Claire's wedding.\n\nWhat is this?\n\nLook at that.\n\nThe mating ritual\n\nis both speedy and violent.\n\nThe lesser male often covers\n\nthe larger female.\n\nIf unsuccessful in mounting, the\n\nmale is often eaten by the female.\n\nWe're the girls of 1-400 Hot Talk.\n\nBriana, Tina, Marla\n\nand me:\n\nFelicia.\n\nAnything you want to talk about,\n\ncall me...\n\n- I don't know where to begin.\n\n- Are you lonely tonight, darling?\n\n- So am I. What are you wearing?\n\n- Nothing special.\n\n- Can I ask you a question?\n\n- I'm just wearing a towel.\n\nI was drying myself off,\n\nafter a hot shower ...\n\nWhy do women leave?\n\nWhy do they leave? Especially\n\npretty ones. I can't do it any more.\n\nLife is very complex.\n\nThere are no guarantees.\n\nThe mathematical world\n\nis completely rational.\n\nYou think too much. Don't you want\n\nto know how big my tits are?\n\nNo! I just want to share my life\n\nwith someone.\n\nSomeone\n\nI'm not sexually attracted to.\n\nHow can two people come together\n\nin lasting respect and affection?\n\n- The world's run by sex ads.\n\n- Take out your own ad, I guess.\n\nAn ad?\n\nLook at me. I'm a grown woman\n\nwearing a prom dress.\n\nI look like an over-the-hill\n\nBarbie doll. And it's too tight.\n\n- I want something in my colour.\n\n- Maids of honour don't wear black.\n\n- Why aren't you wearing make-up?\n\n- I am wearing make-up.\n\n- You'd look good with a perm.\n\n- Like Shirley Temple on crack.\n\nWhere is she? She can't stand that\n\nI'm getting all the attention.\n\n- We should've had her committed.\n\n- For excessive vanity?\n\nHow wonderful! Two compassionate\n\ndaughters. No make-up today?\n\nI am wearing make-up.\n\n- What the hell are you wearing?\n\n- It's an imitation Scassi.\n\n- You're my mother, not the singer.\n\n- I'll go home and change.\n\nStop it. We're late.\n\nThe priest is sweating.\n\nAll celibates sweat, dear.\n\nIf they didn't, they'd explode.\n\nI bought a snack. If I sit through\n\nthis without eating, I'll pass out.\n\nIt'll only take 45 minutes.\n\nMarrying outside your faith,\n\nand on the sabbath ...\n\nAll I know about the sabbath is that\n\nBergdorff's isn't too crowded.\n\nI want you to remember,\n\ntoday is my day.\n\nBehave, or I'll blow up your birth\n\ncertificate into a Christmas card.\n\nI should have never\n\nencouraged you to speak.\n\nMaybe she'll look back\n\nand turn into a pillar of salt.\n\nAlex looks nervous.\n\n- I hope I'm doing the right thing.\n\n- I think you are.\n\nThe party is about to get started.\n\nThe dance floor is all yours!\n\nOkay girls, lick your lips.\n\nTell Claire I'm looking for her.\n\nYour husband's a lucky guy.\n\n- Waiter! Can we have more dressing?\n\n- We were separated at birth.\n\n- Two more drinks, when you can.\n\n- This looks delicious.\n\n- I can't believe he's married.\n\n- And that he chose Claire over you.\n\n- I told you not to introduce them.\n\n- She was married, I didn't think.\n\n- How are you handling all this?\n\n- No more fantasies of handsome men.\n\n- There's a guy out there somewhere.\n\n- Who? Barry Neufeldt?\n\nWhat's wrong with him, other than\n\nthat he looks like Gumpy?\n\nGumby, not Gumpy.\n\n- I'm no great prize, either.\n\n- You're a great person and teacher.\n\nI think I've reached the point where\n\nyou know you'll never get married.\n\nMarried? What's marriage? A ring,\n\na contract. Fighting, compromising.\n\nIt can be more than that. You know"
