        "text": "This Barbra Streisand (1942-) movie page comes from an e-mail request from KellyE1967 that we do more actress pages. We can now say that Myrna Loy, Bette Davis, Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn have been completed per similar requests. Before Lady Gaga, Madonna and Oprah, Streisand had to be the most influential woman in the world (even if they did not have such titles back then). As a singer, Streisand has sold over 140 million albums and won 8 Grammy® awards. This page will look at her equally successfully movie career.\n\nStreisand’s movie career started off with a bang. Her feature debut was in 1968’s Funny Girl. Funny Girl would be her second biggest box office hit of her career and win her the Oscar® for Best Actress. The peak of her movie career was from 1968 to 1979. She would appear in the blockbusters What’s Up Doc?, A Star Is Born, Funny Girl and The Way We Were. In 1983 she started to direct her own movies and had great success with Yentl and The Prince of Tides. After nearly a ten year break from movies, she appeared as Ben Stiller’s mom in 2004’s Meet the Fockers and 2010’s Little Fockers and most recently as Seth Rogen’s mom in The Guilt Trip (2012)\n\nHer IMDb page shows only 20 acting credits from 1968-2012. This page will rank 19 Barbra Streisand movies from Best to Worst in six different sortable columns of information. Her Sunday Night Live television appearance was not included in the rankings.\n\nBarbra Streisand Movies Ranked In Chronological Order With Ultimate Movie Rankings Score (1 to 5 UMR Tickets) *Best combo of box office, reviews and awards."
