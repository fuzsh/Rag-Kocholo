        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click the links on the capsules for the complete reviews and essays.\n\nFunny Face (1957) Fred Astaire’s last major musical, with vintage Gershwin songs, a typically charming performance by Audrey Hepburn and a brilliant supporting turn by the treasurable Kay Thompson.\n\nThe Shakiest Gun in the West (1966) A generally amusing remake of the 1948 Bob Hope vehicle The Paleface reimagined for Don Knotts with bits of The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance thrown in. It’s better, certainly, than the anemic The Reluctant Astronaut although nowhere near as good as The Ghost and Mr. Chicken. (All three were written by James Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum.) The picture virtually defines the word “inconsequential,” but it’s got some good laughs — the sight of Knotts in drag not the least among them, although the question of why some big, virile Indian brave goes mad with lust every time he lays eyes on him remains unanswered — excellent set direction (Alexander Golitzen and Henry Larrecq), good costumes (Grady Hunt), enjoyable music (by Vic Mizzy, of course) and a lot of wonderful character actors in supporting roles. These include Jackie Coogan, Ruth McDevitt, Dub Taylor, Hope Summers. Burt Mustin, a young William Christopher, Carl Ballantine as a fast-talking wagon salesman and and Pat Morita as his general factotum.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors – The Director’s Cut (1986) Why some people feel the need to tamper with success is a question perhaps best left to psychoanalysis, but some things really are better left alone. Frank Oz and Howard Ashman, trying to preserve the satirical content of Ashman and Alan Mencken’s stage musical, filmed the show’s original ending, in which both leading characters die, then seemed shocked when preview audiences hated what they’d done. They somehow didn’t get that film transforms the human figure, gives it a realism, ironically, that an actual person performing in front of you on a stage often doesn’t have. The pair also designed and filmed a long sequence in which the alien plants lay waste to a city. Both scenes were subsequently cut and a new ending devised in which the nebbish Seymour (Rick Moranis) and his sweetly ditzy inamorata Audrey (Ellen Greene) escape to their suburban dream, with a sly wink at the audience at the climax. Having badly miscalculated once, and corrected the error, Oz replicated it in this “Director’s Cut,” which preserves the nasty preview edit. (Ashman died years ago, before the premiere of Beauty and the Beast.)\n\nWhat’s always been delightful about Little Shop remains so, even in this overstuffed edition: The witty doo-wop score, Ashman’s darkly funny script taking off from the two-day-wonder 1960 Roger Corman movie, Oz’s creative direction, the performances by the leads (Moranis, Greene, Vincent Gardenia, Steve Martin and Levi Stubbs as the voice of the plant), the wonderful black girl-group Greek chorus (Tichina Arnold, Michelle Weeks, Tisha Campbell), the superb “Skid Row” production design by Roy Walker, the felicitously-named Robert Paynter’s rich cinematography and Lyle Conway’s miraculous puppetry for the “Audrey II” alien. Bill Murray gives an inspired performance as a dental masochist; his scene with Martin is almost a cinematic transliteration of the old joke about what happens when a sadist and a masochist meet. But Oz’s original finale, with its obvious nod to the original King Kong, goes on and on, pointlessly and annoyingly, for what feels like hours. The Blu-ray on which I watched his preferred cut fortunately contains the original theatrical edit. I sincerely hope the “Director’s Cut” never supersedes it. That would be a horror.\n\nNext Stop, Greenwich Village (1976) The writer-director Paul Mazursky’s funny, heartfelt cinematic reminiscence of his youth as an aspiring actor. Mazursky’s previous picture, the splendid Harry & Tonto, had been a “road movie,” and Next Stop is a bit like a road movie without the road: Mazursky’s alter ego, Larry Lapisnky (the wonderful Lenny Baker) leaves home at the beginning for the Village, and exits New York at the end.\n\nMazursky’s openheartedness informs every moment of Next Stop, Greenwich Village. I don’t think there’s ever been a movie portrait of the Village to match it, and I doubt there’s another American picture that comes close to capturing the headiness, the ardor, the go-for-broke optimism (and the sadness) of a group of talented young people on the cusp of launching their theatrical careers. Mazursky even makes a kind of peace with his own maddening mother who in Shelley Winters’ marvelous performance becomes in a way the ultimate screen embodiment of Jewish Motherhood. Larry’s world, which his creator observes with non-judgmental amusement, includes his girlfriend Sarah (the superb Ellen Greene), his gentle peacemaking father (Mike Kellin), a womanizing dramatic poet (Chris Walken) based on Mazursky’s one-time friend and romantic rival Howard Sackler, the periodically suicidal Anita (Lois Smith, in an astonishing performance), the amiable Connie (Dori Brenner), the gay black hustler Bernstein (Antonio Fargas) forever announcing he’s fallen in love with some trick or other, Larry’s health-food purveying employer (the great Lou Jacobi) and his acting coach (Michael Egan, essentially playing Herbert Berghof). Joe Spinnell also has a good bit as a cop who interrupts Larry’s drunken actor fantasies and Jeff Goldblum has another as an obnoxious actor. Arthur J. Ornitz, who also shot An Unmarried Woman for Mazursky, brought a beautiful, warm, muted palette to the picture, a form that perfectly complements the movie’s content.\n\nThe Player (1992) Robert Altman and Michael Tolken’s satirical fantasia on Hollywood, based on the latter’s novel, was the brightest release of its summer and one of that year’s most accomplished and entertaining pictures. I’ve never been sure that Altman’s Brechtian approach, treating the entirety of the action as a film-within-a-film, succeeds — those B- movie, film noir posters on the walls of a modern movie studio which could more reasonably be expected to sport framed examples of its own product only exist, after all, as self-conscious symbols — yet the movie is so light on its feet, and contains so many artfully rendered digs at the naked crassness pervading the movie industry it’s seldom less than both amusing and instructive. The dozens of stars playing themselves, some in what Mike Todd once called cameo roles, others in what amounts to walk-on appearances, lend a strange verisimilitude to the picture… “strange” in that the movie has no particular reality, so personalities such as Harry Belafonte, Cher and Jack Lemmon are like figures in the carpet of a dream. Or perhaps a nightmare; although The Player is often very funny, and its central actor rightly called “a shit-bag producer,” one moreover who murders a screenwriter and gets away with it, the journey of Griffin Mill (Tim Robbins) is one Kafka would appreciate.\n\nSnoopy, Come Home (1972) The second Peanuts feature, which I loved at 11, made the mistake of putting Snoopy in the forefront and relegating the kids to supporting actors, a tendency it shared with the strip itself in those days. The modestly talented Bill Melendez directed and although the songs are by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman they’re more about mood than character, and character was the Sherman’s forte. Among the artists involved were the Disney veteran Don Lusk, Phil Roman and Bob Clampett’s great (and certifiably insane) animator Rod Scribner.\n\nThe Frighteners — Director’s Cut (1996) As with Tim Burton, it’s become increasingly difficult to remember the time when Peter Jackson was an interesting filmmaker. The Frighteners is like its Danny Elfman score: Too busy, too frenetic and, ultimately, not exhilarating but exhausting. The best thing about the picture is Michael J. Fox’s performance as Frank Bannister, a phony spiritualist whose business is kept (barely) afloat through his association with several actual ghosts (Chi McBride, Jim Fyfe, John Astin). The death of his wife in an automobile accident years before has left Frank nearly devoid of feeling and although Fox is engaging he carries a weight of depression. The movie’s larger plot involves the ghost of a young mass-murderer (Jake Busey) who is still killing, and the approach of Jackson and his co-scenarist Fran Walsh to matters of spiritualism are utterly illogical: Shades such as Astin’s Judge are somehow still moldering, losing parts of their bodies as they rot, and the spirits can themselves be destroyed by other ghosts. The crowning horrors of the picture are not the ghostly goings-on but the incredibly overripe performances by Peter Dobson as a recent murder victim and, especially, the appalling Jeffrey Combs as the unhinged government investigator Dammers. However low one’s opinion of the FBI, surely it’s an impossible stretch to imagine that even so corrupt an entity would sanction an agent as obviously deranged as this one.\n\nWhere’s Poppa? (1970) One of the sickest comedies ever made and, if you’re open to it, one of the funniest. In this adaptation by Robert Klane of his acid-tinged comic novel, George Segal plays a hag-ridden lawyer coping with his senescent mother (Ruth Gordon) whom he would like to get rid of by fair means or foul. (When he dresses in a gorilla suit in hopes of giving her a fatal coronary she knees him in the balls; as he lies there in pain she gurgles, “Oh, Gordon — you almost scared me to death!” to which he rasps, “Almost doesn’t count.”) It’s a surreal black comedy where nearly everyone is either insane or behaves that way. Carl Reiner directed the picture as if it made perfect sense, and that squareness makes the dialogue even funnier; at a crucial juncture Segal snarls out a hilarious threat to Gordon whose obscene ferocity absolutely fractured me.\n\nAmong the other inmates are Ron Leibman as Gordon’s idiot brother, Trish Van Devere as the home nurse Gordon falls in love with, Barnard Hughes and Vincent Gardenia as pathological court plaintiffs, Rob Reiner as one of Gordon’s typically loopy clients, Rae Allen as Leibman’s wife, Paul Sorvino as the barking curator of a nightmare old-folks’ home, Garrett Morris as a cheerful Central Park mugger, William Le Massena as a judge and Alice Drummond, who has a great scene as a woman stuck in an elevator with a naked Leibman.\n\nMastermind (1969/1976) A silly, enjoyable spoof of Charlie Chan movies starring Zero Mostel that sat on the shelf for seven years before being given a perfunctory release. When you think of the number of truly wretched, slavering “comedies” that routinely infested American screens during that period and were infinitely more successful at the box office it’s hard to imagine why the producers of this one were so ashamed of it, or why they couldn’t find a distributor. Written by William Peter Blatty (billed as “Terence Clyne”) and Ian McLellan Hunter, Mastermind is frequently hilarious and never less than amusing, although you may wonder why, when every other Japanese character speaks perfect English only Mostel’s Inspector Hoku Ichihara expresses himself in Charlie Chanese. (It’s not exactly Pidgin, but if you’ve read the Earl Derr Biggers Chan novels you’ll recognize its contours immediately.) The direction by Alex March is like so much television of the period, as is the cinematography by Gerald Hirschfeld. But there’s a funny chase sequence, and the likable performers range from Bradford Dillman as an iffy American government agent to Sorrell Booke as a suspect scientist, Herbert Berghof as a mad German and Felix Silla as his creation, a mean little robot called Schatzi. Jules Munshin and Phil Leeds also show up, as a pair of Israeli agents who may or may not be lovers. Fred Karlin contributed a pleasant score, and Mostel is more restrained than usual; there’s a slightly Zen quality to the character of Inspector Ichihara, and it affects the entire tone of the picture in a positive way.\n\nPeter Pan (1953) The inevitable Disney version of J.M. Barrie’s play and, later, novel. I saw the picture initially on one of its theatrical reissues (ask your parents) around 1970 and it was one of the few animated Disneys I had no overwhelming desire to see again. Watching it now I can understand that lack of enthusiasm. It’s a typically good-looking, well animated exercise that feels utterly empty of content or emotion and, although set in the early part of the 20th century, is wedded to Jud Conlon’s resolutely 1950s vocal arrangements. That it took no fewer than seven composers and lyricists to come up with the anemic song score is telling, and Sammy Fain’s “What Made the Red Man Red?” is, to a modern sensibility, appalling. (And why does the asexual Peter whoop it up like a sex-crazed wolf in some Tex Avery cartoon because Tiger Lily has rubbed noses with him?)\n\nSpeaking of Avery, the best thing about this Peter Pan are the realizations of Captain Hook (Frank Thomas), Mr. Smee (Ollie Johnston) and the Crocodile (Wolfgang Reitherman), all of whom seem to have wandered in from another, broader animated dimension and whose vocal characterizations (Hans Conried as Hook, Bill Thompson as Smee) are unalloyed delights. Bobby Driscoll was the model for Peter and gives a nice vocal performance which emphasizes Peter’s unthinking pubescent selfishness.\n\nCarnal Knowledge (1971) Jules Feiffer’s wonderfully titled look at incompatible sexual relationships, icily directed by Mike Nichols in long, long takes and exquisitely photographed by Giuseppe Rotunno. Feiffer initially planned it as a play, and the scenes have a theatrical shape to them. Actually, they feel like elongated versions of Feiffer’s Village Voice strips and the ironies he expresses have a ruthless inevitability. The script grew out of its author’s observation of men who desire women’s bodies yet despise the women themselves and the embodiment of that attitude is Jack Nicholson’s Jonathan. As a college boy he’s the kind of young hypocrite who complains of a girl that she “let” him feel her up on the first date and it turned him off and who is constantly alert for “ball-breakers” yet is brutal to the women who are fool enough to love him. Jonathan’s counterpart, his college roommate Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and less crude (Jonathan has an adolescent fixation on “big tits”) but he’s every bit as hard to please: He goes from the blank Susan (Candice Bergen) to the steely Cindy (Cynthia O’Neal) to the flower-child Jennifer (Carol Kane) and never seems satisfied with any of them. And Jonathan is such a rat, and so sexually suspect, he isn’t happy unless he can seduce Susan while she’s dating Sandy — actually, because she’s seeing his best friend.\n\nThe acting is highly variable. Why anyone ever thought Bergen was an actress is one of those eternal mysteries, while Garfunkel’s character barely exists and poor Rita Moreno is given an impossible scene in which as a call-girl she has to excessively praise Jonathan’s virility in order for him to achieve an erection. Nicholson completely gives in to Jonathan’s psycho-sexual contradictions and obsessions, but the revelation is Ann-Margret as the hapless Bobbie, who under Jonathan’s tender ministrations goes from a happy young woman to an emotional and psychological wreck. Nichols was a master at directing actors, and of developing character through behavior. Where, in this picture, he was less assured was in his showier gambits: The restaurant set seeming to revolve as Jonathan and Bobbie talk, for example, or the way the background behind Moreno appears to be rising as she performs her degrading monologue. The worst moment, naturally, involves Bergen: A tight closeup of her face as the unseen Jonathan and Sandy compete to make her laugh and she does so, endlessly. Earlier Susan has told Sandy that everyone acts, and it’s clear that this scene is supposed to show how she acts as much as everyone else, yet instead of illustrating the thesis the shot becomes increasingly annoying, with Bergen’s incompetence its chief feature. Far better is Feiffer’s often trenchant dialogue, such as when Jonathan complains that Bobbie never gets out of bed:\n\nBobbie: The reason I sleep all day is, I can’t stand my life.\n\nJonathan: What life?\n\nBobbie: Sleeping all day!\n\nIf you’ve ever been a depressive, or loved one, you know how true that statement is.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nToo many movies, not enough time: A theme of my life, and I suspect of many others’. However, I can usually pound out a set of capsule reviews within the full phases of the moon. In my defense, four titles that demanded more extensive essays than I had planned to write (excerpted hereon) had a lot to do with the delay.\n\n“And who put a gun to his head?” I hear you ask. “Does he think the world will come to a fiery end if he doesn’t complete his full compliment of movie reviews per annum?”\n\nYou cad.\n\nYoung Mr. Lincoln (1939) One of John Ford’s loveliest movies, and one which even when it sentimentalizes its characters or falls into the trap of symbolic foreshadowing is engaging on such a high level that it can only be described as genuine popular art.\n\nAll Night Long (1981) Despite the stupid tagline above, and the wink-wink/sex-farce advertising artwork, this is an absolutely charming romantic comedy from the screenwriter W.D. Richter and the director Jean-Claude Tramont starring Gene Hackman and Barbra Streisand.\n\nThe Quiller Memorandum (1966) A diminution by Harold Pinter of the exceptionally intelligent and beautifully written thriller by Elleston Trevor, writing as “Adam Hall,” that while not entirely successful is nevertheless fascinating to watch, if only for its glimpses of 1960s Berlin. (The sheer number of shiny Volkswagon Beetles on the streets is a whole movie in itself.) The picture is almost fatally flawed by its central casting, which makes absolutely no sense; I’m more or less a lifelong admirer of George Segal, but Quiller is British or he’s nothing. Although I have no quarrels with Segal’s performance, instead of concentrating on Quiller’s actions we’re distracted wondering why MI6 is assigning top secret investigations to an American. Much of the dialogue in the Pinter screenplay is Trevor’s but what’s missing is Quiller’s narration, crucial in the novel, where he takes the reader through his attempts to smoke out a resurgent Nazi organization. We share his confusion and suspicions, as well as his plans and strategies, in a way we do not in the movie and cannot as it was written and filmed. As with The Ipcress File, the producers of The Quiller Memorandum bought a complex, witty novel and boiled it down to an essence; the flavor is there, faintly, but the dish itself has been so adulterated it scarcely resembles the original. What, exactly, was the point?\n\nI am well aware that of course the point was to cash in on the ’60s mania for spies. So why not cast an English actor? After all, the period in which The Quiller Memorandum was made was also a period of mania for everything British. Nearly every element of Trevor’s book was simplified or, conversely, made needlessly complex, although I appreciate Pinter’s ironic use of the Olympiastadion in the opening scene. The climax is also good, as are the torture sequences between Segal and the silky, seductive SS mastermind wonderfully embodied by Max von Sydow and the long nocturnal pursuit of Segal through the Berlin streets. These sequences are effective primarily because they follow the action of the novel; they were too good not to use. (Trevor may or may not have known it, but his book is based on a fallacy: That the British government would be concerned with foiling renascent National Socialists when, like its American and Soviet counterparts, the Empire after the fall of Berlin jockeyed to grab as many Nazi scientists as it could.) Michael Anderson, the director, whose best movie was the Michael Todd Around the World in 80 Days, kept the picture trim and the action humming, abetted by Erwin Hillier’s beautiful widescreen cinematography, which reaches its apotheosis in an exhilarating driving sequence clearly filmed without recourse to rear-screen projection. Alec Guinness contributes one of his small, quiet gems as a superficially friendly yet oddly sinister MI6 section head, Senta Berger is lovely as a woman who knows more than she’s telling, and George Sanders and Robert Helpmann are amusing in roles that are all too brief. Trevor, by the way, wrote 78 novels (including The Flight of the Phoenix and 19 additional Quillers), 33 children’s books, 6 stage plays and 15 radio plays between 1943 and 1996. Not a patch on Barbara Cartland (723) or Isaac Asimov (500+) but impressive nonetheless.\n\nA Life at Stake (1955) A cheaply made B-movie thriller from Angela Lansbury’s lean years, seemingly lost and recently rediscovered. It’s a variation on Double Indemnity, with Lansbury in the Stanwyck role and Keith Andes as the man she and her disreputable creep of a husband (Douglass Dumbrille) hope to lure into a business arrangement and then murder for his insurance. Lansbury plays it far more ambivalently than Stanwyck was allowed to, although one’s first instincts about her character support the notion that she’s not quite what she seems. The direction by Paul Guilfoyle is serviceable but the script by Russ Bender, from a story by Hank McCune, is a cut above the norm, intelligent and often lively, especially the lines for Andes’ busybody of a landlady, marvelously played by Jane Darwell. Andes gets to show off his physique on a regular basis, which seems to be the reason he was hired, but Claudia Barrett is fascinatingly off-center as Lansbury’s younger sister; we’re never quite sure if she’s delightfully daffy, smarter than she seems or a genuine dingbat.\n\nA Life at Stake is not a classic by any means but it’s a reasonably diverting use of 76 minutes, and more than that if you like Lansbury. She was seldom given the screen roles she deserved, but she’s been a favorite with me since I first saw her in Bedknobs and Broomsticks at the theaters when I was 11 and The Manchurian Candidate on television two years later. Her distinctive voice is one I always enjoy hearing, even in movies that aren’t entirely worthy of her.\n\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s (1961) The famous adaptation by George Axelrod (screenplay) and Blake Edwards (direction) has become genuinely iconic — a word I seldom use since everyone else over-uses it — for Audrey Hepburn’s look, especially during her early morning embodiment of the title.\n\nTrue Grit (1969) The spirited adaptation of Charles Portis’ superb novel, with a canny central performance by John Wayne.\n\nThe President’s Analyst (1967) The writer-director Theodore Flicker’s great, hilarious satire on spies, liberal pieties, reactionary politics, psychoanalysis and government secrecy seems ever more relevant, and prescient.\n\nThe Shootist (1976) John Wayne’s final movie is a good picture irredeemably flawed by its star’s interference in the creative process. Since Wayne expressed strong interest in the project early on, he ought to have had enough faith in the material, and sufficient personal integrity, to see it through as written. Glendon Swarthout’s novel, about a notorious gunfighter facing his imminent death from rectal cancer, is a remarkable little book, clear-eyed and entirely unsentimental. As long as the picture sticks to Swarthout’s narrative, it’s restrained, taut and elegiac. Unfortunately, Wayne had script approval, and that meant dulling the novel’s hard edge to the movie’s detriment.\n\nOne of the book’s most extraordinary qualities is one that could not be transmogrified to film without a great deal of creativity: The way Swarthout anatomizes (if you’ll forgive a wholly appropriate pun) the effects of gun violence on the human body. Each time a character is shot, the author describes in clinical detail what the bullet does to his flesh, and his internal organs. It’s almost the literary equivalent of Sam Peckinpah’s balletic violence; it reminds the reader how transient life is, and how easily extinguished. I doubt there was a way, in 1976, to depict this in a motion picture the way in our own era the various “CSI” series showed it in nearly every episode. In any case, the loss of this is less egregious than the way two primary elements were altered: The ending, and the character of the teenage boy played by Ron Howard. In the Swarthout novel Gillom Rogers is a thoroughgoing delinquent, so viciously selfish he steals the guns from a dead man’s hands and the money left for his poor, widowed mother by the gunfighter. The movie paints Gillom as a nice lad angry about his father’s death who might go bad without guidance. And need I add that he does the right thing at the end? It’s all as phony as Wayne’s spurious claim, when he saw footage filmed during his absence that indicated the gunfighter shot one of his assailants in the back, that he’d never done such a thing before in any movie. (He had; he still demanded re-takes.)\n\nAlthough he is altogether too hale and bulky to be believable as a man who is wasting away from disease, and there is in the picture no cinematic equivalent of the harrowing moment when the gunfighter, John Books, sees the mirror reflection of his final terminal state — much less his deliberately shooting a would-be thief in the gut and a failed assassin up the ass, as if in revenge for the site of his own cancer — Wayne gives a good account of the man. (A further criticism: He’s much too old for his role, as Lauren Bacall is for hers.) Although Ron Howard’s performance as Gillom is quite good, the part is so compromised it feels like something out of a TV movie of the week instead of emerging from one of the toughest Western novels ever written. (Despite his immature voice, I think Howard underrated as an actor. It’s only as a director that he drives me onto the shoals of despair.)\n\nWhat’s best about the movie, aside from Howard and Wayne, Bruce Surtees’ autumnal cinematography and Elmer Bernstein’s threnodic score, is what’s also best about the book: The way, sniffing his death, everyone except his doctor (James Stewart) and the Bacall character flocks around to pick what it can off John Books’ still-living corpse: The bantam-weight town marshal (played with malicious glee by Harry Morgan), who is delighted to lose a source of violence; the reporter for a local paper (Rick Lenz) who sees Books as his ticket to better things; the undertaker (John Carradine, another living cadaver) who will charge the gawkers to view the body; Books’ old girlfriend (Sheree North) who hopes to parlay marriage into a tell-all memoir; the blacksmith (Scatman Crothers) who gets Books’ horse and saddle for a song; the fast-shooting faro dealer (Hugh O’Brian) hoping to make a name for himself; an old foe (Richard Boone) out for vengeance; and even the little barber (Alfred Dennis) who surreptitiously sweeps up Books’ fallen locks to sell as souvenirs. These various ghouls and carrion birds confirm Books’ cynicism, and inadvertently provide him an idea for how to die without agony. All these actors are fine, but Stewart is better than good. I don’t know whether he read Swarthout’s novel, if the screenwriters (Miles Hood Swarthout and Scott Hale) noted the doctor’s attitude in their script, or if the director, Don Siegel, instructed Stewart to do so, but the actor reads his lines with real anger, as if the doctor is so disgusted with death, and the process of dying, he almost seems to be taking it out on the patient.\n\nStagecoach (1939) John Ford’s influential Western, his first since 3 Bad Men in 1926 and the single title that redefined the contours of the genre. Adapted by Dudley Nichols from Ernest Haycox’s well-written magazine story “The Stage to Lordsburg” (with perhaps a trace of de Maupassant’s “Boule de Suif” thrown in) Stagecoach tossed out most of the childish Western clichés and enhanced its story with flesh-and-blood characters rather than mere traditional archetypes. Many have deemed the result “Grand Hotel on Wheels” but this is inapt. In Grand Hotel, most of the characters never meet the others. Here the people are thrust together, mostly in the confined space of a carriage racing across the desert. They could scarcely be more intimate with each other if they were sharing a bed. Although the conniving banker is an all too hissable villain, especially as overplayed by Berton Churchill and I think it’s asking a bit much of any audience to expect it to believe a woman about to give birth could successfully hide her advanced state of pregnancy in such close quarters, the rest of the people, and their behavior, seem perfectly true to life: The physician whose confidence has been destroyed by drink (Thomas Mitchell), the prostitute frozen out by the other passengers (Claire Trevor), the phony Southern gentleman-gambler (John Carradine), the stalwart Belle of the Old South (Louise Platt), the jovial coward of a driver (Andy Devine) and the timid milquetoast of a whiskey drummer (the all-too appropriately named Donald Meek). Only George Bancroft as the marshal riding shotgun is out of his depth but you forgive him for his general likeability.\n\nAfter toiling for nearly a decade in six-day Western quickies in part as expiation for the sin of appearing in another director’s movie, John Wayne was finally resurrected by Ford as the escaped prisoner the Ringo Kid, and no filmmaker could have more boldly announced his intention to introduce a new star than when Ford dollies in for a rare (for him) close-up of Wayne as he hails the stagecoach. Although Wayne’s face had matured from the time of The Big Trail in 1930 and he’d gained in technique through all those B- and C-grade Westerns for Columbia, Monogram and Republic, he’s still a bit callow here. Yet you hardly mind, particularly as he’s so innocently solicitous of Claire Trevor, not seeming to know why the other passengers shun her, or not caring. The other men pretend to be gentlemen but treat this woman as less than human; Wayne’s rough gunslinger and Mitchell’s bibulous outcast physician are the only real gentlemen in the bunch.\n\nShot by the great Bert Glennon against the heart-stopping vistas of Monument Valley, the backdrops in Stagecoach occasionally dwarf the human participants in a way I don’t think had ever been seen in a movie before this one. Glennon’s exterior shots are like Ansel Adams portraits come to vivid life, and on the screen in 1939 those magnificent huge skies and towering mesas must have knocked Depression audiences out. Certainly they reflect the eye of a visual poet, which for all his self-conscious bluster is what John Ford was. He made barrenness sing.\n\nHorse Feathers (1932) The Marx Brothers’ funniest comedy. The laughter is sustained throughout, and if the climactic football game is a bit of a let-down (why hire the Marx Brothers to do what the Three Stooges can?)* the rest of the picture, from Groucho’s Gilbertian introduction (“I’m Against It!”) to the surprise finale with Thelma Todd, is roaringly funny, and in a way only those American movies that just skirted enforcement of the Production Code can be. The hilarious screenplay is by S. J. Perelman, Bert Kalmar & Harry Ruby and Will B. Johnstone, with an un-credited assist from Arthur Sheekman, one of Groucho’s favorite writers. Kalmar & Ruby also wrote the songs, and one of the picture’s highlights is the different versions of “Everyone Says I Love You” they wrote for Zeppo’s Crosbyesque crooning, Chico’s fractured English, and Groucho’s cynicism (“Everyone says I love you/But just what they say it for I never knew/It’s just inviting trouble for the poor sucker who/Says I love you…”) Indeed, the rowboat scene in which he sings it to Todd, to his own charming guitar accompaniment, is the movie’s highest spot. He serenades while she (of course) does the rowing, and what makes Todd’s attempts to wrangle secret football plays from Groucho so memorable is their ingenious by-play: When she engages in baby-talk, he threatens to kick her teeth down her throat. This is the second of two pictures in which Todd appeared as Groucho’s comic/romantic foil, and you wish there had been more. They’re so evenly matched that by contrast his sniping at poor Margaret Dumont almost seems like a come-down. Almost.\n\nIf you care about such things, Norman Z. McLeod directed.\n\n*And yes, I know the Stooges weren’t in pictures then. If I had said Wheeler and Woolsey would you have known who I meant?\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nKing Rat (1965) An evocative, thoughtful yet curiously uninspired adaptation by Bryan Forbes of James Clavell’s debut novel, the first in his so-called Asian Saga. (The book, and the movie, are fictionalized memoirs of Clavell’s experience as a British prisoner of war in the Japanese camp at Changi.) This is one of those movies which while it honors its source and is by no means bad is difficult to work up much enthusiasm for. It’s a quality I’ve noticed before in Forbes’ work, notably Scéance on a Wet Afternoon (1964); considering the excellence of the Mark McShane novel on which it was based, the picture should have been a classic but lacks some almost indefinable element — the je nais se quoi of art — that might have lifted it into the Pantheon. The same is true of King Rat. It’s decently enough done, and it’s certainly well cast (George Segal, James Fox, Tom Courtenay, John Mills, Leonard Rossiter, Denholm Elliott, Alan Webb) but it’s a bore to write about. Forbes is workman-like, and earnest, but the divine spark was never lit in him. He lacks, say, both the crazy inspiration of a John Huston and the image-mad power of a David Lean. The result is work that holds your interest and is thoroughly respectable, but who wants respectability from a movie? Segal, Fox and Courtney embody their roles perfectly, although the latter’s is noticeably truncated, and the black and white photography is by Burnett Guffey, who two years on from this would light Bonnie and Clyde. The John Barry score, with its odd use of the cimbalom for a story taking place in Singapore is nonetheless splendid, anchored to one of his indelible main themes, which captures the essential melancholy and aloneness beneath King’s gregarious façade. But Clavell’s book, once you’ve finished it, haunts you. At the end of the movie all you’re liable to be thinking about is what you want for dinner.\n\nBreakheart Pass (1975) A dandy mystery thriller in the guise of a conventional Western which despite the then extremely popular Charles Bronson in the lead somehow failed to find its audience. Based by Alistair MacLean on his 1974 novel, which itself reads like an extended treatment for a screenplay, the picture has pace, intelligence, excitement, and character: Everything we look for in a good escapist movie and including as well a plot whose modest but intriguing complications would almost certainly preclude its being made today.\n\nEven so, Bronson was reportedly unhappy that the true nature of his character’s role in the story was revealed earlier than MacLean chose to do in his book and he was right to be upset; as much as anything else in the novel it’s the central mystery of just who the hell “John Deakin” is that keeps the reader happily turning the pages. But the picture has much to compensate for the lapse, including glorious Idaho location cinematography by the great Lucien Ballard; top-notch editing by Byron Brandt that takes in a blood-curdling sequence involving runaway train-cars filled with Union soldiers*; and a cast of old pros: Ben Johnson, Richard Crenna, Charles Durning, Ed Lauter, David Huddleston, Roy Jenson and Eddie Little Sky. Bronson’s wife Jill Ireland represents the younger generation, as the plucky dame who becomes Bronson’s confederate, and the former boxer Archie Moore (once a very fine if physically mis-cast Joe Mott in the live television version of The Iceman Cometh) has a fight with Bronson on top of the speeding locomotive traveling over elevated tracks above an unforgiving gorge that is the last word in white-knuckle stuff. Tom Gries directed with understated flair, and Jerry Goldsmith wrote one of his characteristically intense, propulsive scores.\n\nAt the time of the movie’s release Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times called Breakheart Pass “a fun if familiar picture but is played so broadly on such an elementary level that it can hope to satisfy only the most undemanding of viewer.” I presume Thomas meant that superfluous “of” to distinguish his intellectual capacities as far greater than those possessed by us mere undemanding types. And by sheerest coincidence while writing this I came across, in the liner rotes for Film Score Monthly’s release of the Quincy Jones score for The Split (1968) a quote from the same critic in which he uses the self-concocted word “incredibilities.” Apparently Thomas was himself undemanding, at least as far as correct grammar was concerned.\n\nBullitt (1968) Steve McQueen’s allure eludes me. A performer who continually asks to have his lines reduced may be, as McQueen labeled himself, a “reactor,” but he’s not an actor. John Wayne called himself a reactor too, and while he knew he registered most forcefully without dialogue, or when it was minimal, he wasn’t afraid of words. As for the man’s alleged “cool,” what we most often see in him is a blankness onto which the audience projects whatever it thinks he’s thinking. And while I prefer to avoid comparing actors, which seems to me an exercise in futility, if you imagine every role for which McQueen became famous cast instead with Paul Newman, I think you can see what I mean about his essential lack. As Frank Bullitt he’s rather good, in his limited way, although it’s the picture itself, and the way it was written, directed, photographed and scored, that give Bullitt its most memorable qualities.\n\nAlan R. Trustman and Harry Kleiner’s screenplay, based on a clever, conventional 1963 police procedural novel by Robert L. Fish (writing as “Robert L. Pike”… get it?) set in New York City, is sharper, more elliptical and more ambiguous than its source, except in the area of ethnicity: The movie, as was common practice at the time (due perhaps to the threat of protest by Mafia front groups, or the interference of J. Edgar Hoover?) de-emphasized the presence of Italian mobsters in the narrative; “Johnny Rossi” in the Fish novel becomes “Johnny Ross” in Bullitt, and La Cosa Nostra is only ever referred to as “The Organization.” Still, I suspect a reasonably knowledgeable pubescent in 1968 could have figured out what was being implied. What resonates are the characters, and the way Bullitt chafes against the system, especially as represented by the politically ambitious San Francisco D.A. played, with mercurial oiliness, by Robert Vaughan. Lt. Frank Bullitt’s iconoclasm is made clear by the distinctive way he wears his gun holster (a trick McQueen picked up from Detective Dave Toschi, who would later become famous for his role in the SFPD’s investigation of the “Zodiac” killings) and by his Highland Green Mustang GT, which gets a memorable workout in the movie’s justifiably famous second act chase. The use of San Francisco, where nearly all the picture’s scenes were filmed, is equally distinctive, and makes you wonder why so few American movies were ever made there.\n\nThe chase, in which Bullitt pursues the killers played by the veteran stuntmen Paul Genge and Bill Hickman, deserves every plaudit it’s been given (in spite of that green Volkswagen Beetle that keeps popping up beside McQueen as he speeds over the hills and which he repeatedly passes) but William A. Fraker’s beautiful deep-focus cinematography offers far more than chases. The British Peter Yates directs with quiet assurance; the supporting cast, which includes Don Gordon, Robert Duvall, Georg Stanford Brown, Al Checco and a luminously beautiful Jacqueline Bisset as Bullitt’s architect girlfriend, is splendid; and the score by Lalo Schifrin is one of the era’s finest. Anchored to a main title theme that can trace its lineage to Schifrin’s own “Mission: Impossible,” the score is largely diegetic. But when underscore is required, the composer delivers his characteristically snaky rhythms and casually infectious melodies in a way that is both un-insistent and compelling; take special note of the way that theme accompanies Pablo Ferro’s distinctive credits. If Bullitt is “cool,” it’s largely Schifrin who makes it so.\n\nPrince of the City (1981) Like Serpico (1973), this Sidney Lumet-directed (and co-written) picture, based in reality, moves up the time-frame and changes the names of the participants. The former I assume was a result of budgetary constraints, the latter due perhaps to our strange libel laws. Despite these compromises, it’s an extremely well-crafted movie which while it skirts greatness is nonetheless as impressive today as it was when it was new. All the more so since this sort of big, expansive picture, made without unnecessary flourishes and concerning itself with what Faulkner called “the human heart in conflict with itself,” and which alone, he felt, made for good writing, is seldom produced any longer. It’s a slightly fictionalized account of the travails of Bobby Leuci, whose activities exposing corruption in the NYPD and motivated by his overwhelming sense of guilt over his own were recounted in Robert Daley’s 1978 book. Lumet (and Jay Presson Allen, his co-scenarist) move the action from the late 1960s and early 1970s to what appears to be the late ’70s and alter the identities of the participants, including a young Rudy Giuliani. Although Lumet and Allen are scrupulous about not vilifying the people involved, it is virtually impossible to view the sanctimonious, entrapment-happy Federal prosecutor played by Bob Balaban with anything less than disgust, an emotion his real-life progenitor also engendered in the readers of Daley’s book.\n\nPrince of the City runs nearly three hours and famously has over 100 speaking roles yet never feels long. Although Allen had originally wished only to produce the picture, in part because she was uneasy about the book’s structure, she and Lumet did an artful job of juggling a complicated narrative even as they, to a degree, fictionalized it for popular consumption. For Lumet, this sort of picture was as natural as the summer sun and it’s doubtful any of his contemporaries could have planned and delivered such a long, complex movie with such economy and fluidity. Treat Williams, known primarily at that time for his stage work and, on film, for his smashing performance as Berger in the underrated Miloš Forman-directed movie of Hair (1979) and who is in nearly every scene of the movie, gives an exceptionally layered performance as “Danny Ciello,” conflicted, guilt-ridden, arrogant, loyal, compassionate and all too believably human. Also in the large cast: Jerry Orbach (in his first good movie role as one of the men Danny is loath to rat out), Paul Roebling, James Tolkan, Lindsay Crouse, Ron Karabatsos, Lee Richardson, Lane Smith, Lance Henriksen and Cynthia Nixon. (Alan King, who had recently starred for Lumet and Allen in their very funny adaption of her novel Just Tell Me What You Want has a cameo as himself.) The superb, muted and deliberately claustrophobic photography is by Andrzej Bartkowiak.\n\nLumet was never sure how he felt about Bobby Leuci, an ambivalence pretty obviously shared by Robert Daley in his original book. Was he sincere in his desire to confess, and to root out police corruption, or was he an opportunist? Or (and this seems likeliest) both at once? That quality, of not taking sides, is one that runs through the projects Sidney Lumet directed and it deepens his best work, which very much includes this movie. When, at the end, as Danny is about to give a police lecture and a young detective on hearing his name rises and leaves saying, firmly but quietly, “I don’t think I have anything to learn from you,” the moment is exactly right; the look on Treat Williams’ face suggests that while the dismissal stings, Danny can’t blame the cop in the least for wanting no part of him.\n\nThe Great Waldo Pepper (1975) A slightly flawed masterwork of collaboration between William Goldman and the director George Roy Hill containing some of the most exhilarating airborne flight sequences ever filmed.\n\nThe Man Who Killed Don Quixote (2018) Terry Gilliam famously attempted to film this comic/dramatic fantasy, in a significantly different version, in 2000, the disasters attending it documented by Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe in what became their fascinating Lost in La Mancha. Gilliam should have quit while he was behind. And since he is one of the most inventive and ingenious filmmakers alive, I get absolutely no pleasure from saying that.\n\nLacking both the time and the inclination to assay what I consider, on a reading admittedly aborted after several hundred pages, one of the most overrated of all “classic” novels, I’ll simply note that Don Quixote is not merely overlong but annoying, repetitive, weirdly discursive and often downright dull. Doubtless its literary satire meant something to 17th century readers, particularly in Spain, but we moderns are left mostly with famous narrative scraps: The Don and the madness which leads him to believe he is a knight-errant; his chaste devotion to his mythical Lady Dulcinea; the resolute peasant pragmatism of his squire Sancho Panza; the battle with the windmill. And if I am put off by Gilliam’s source, I am even more alienated by his choice of leading man. If there is a more charmless, unappealing young actor around these days than Adam Driver, I don’t know who he might be.\n\nIf the picture was a mess, it might at least have been an entertaining mess. If you didn’t know Terry Gilliam was the director and co-author (with Tony Grisoni) I would defy you to guess he was behind the camera. Only fleetingly is there ever a sense of inspiration, or a flash of that daring and intoxicating go-for-broke fantasy which is the sine qua non of Gilliam’s style. Instead the movie feels formless and inert, as if it had been worked on too long and compromised beyond its maker’s ability to come to grips with the material. Only rarely are you amused or intrigued, and never moved. The only saving graces are Jonathan Pryce’s performance as the old man who embodies Quixote, the ethereal beauty of Joana Ribeiro as the object of Driver’s affections, the lovely music by Roque Baños and the often-exquisite cinematography by Nicola Pecorini. Even they aren’t enough to salvage the last shreds of your interest.\n\nWhat is sometimes more tragic than a dream deferred, is a dream realized.\n\nMurder by Death (1976) Neil Simon’s spoof of literary and cinematic murder mystery sleuths is, like a Mel Brooks movie of the period, a scattershot affair; much of what was funny then is still quite funny now, and the big laughs tide you over the more airless passages. It’s a movie that couldn’t be made today, and not merely because its cast is irreplaceable. (Well. Truman Capote should have been replaced, with an actor, but that’s another matter.) What I’m referring to is Simon’s parody of Charlie Chan, and Peter Sellers’ casting in the role. Never mind that “Sidney Wang” takes off, not from Earl Derr Biggers’ intelligent and articulate Chan but from the “Confucius say…” Hollywood movie version of him, or that he is made no more ridiculous than the figures in the picture based on Sam Spade, Hercule Poirot or Nick and Nora Charles (Elsa Lanchester’s “Miss Marbles” is for some reason treated less savagely, although she is more Girl Guide than little old lady). It’s the “Yellowface” issue, and the deliberate comic stereotype, that would doom the character today.\n\nThat’s not to mention two of the movie’s best and funniest characters, the blind butler and the deaf-mute maid. When I was 15, the sight of Nancy Walker “screaming her head off” nearly put me on the theater floor, and I fell completely in love with Alec Guinness’ sightless but unflappable manservant. I still find nothing offensive about them. Again, Simon isn’t poking cruel fun at the blind or the deaf but at the absurdity of these characters being employed as domestics. That Guinness, blissfully unaware that the woman can neither hear nor speak and Walker, equally uncomprehending of his blindness, are unable to communicate is a sick-joke that is inherently hilarious and is made more so by the peerless comic playing of those two old pros. The others (Sellers, Lanchester, David Niven and Maggie Smith as “Dick and Dora Charleston,” James Coco as the gluttonous “Milo Perrier” and Peter Falk and the marvelous Eileen Brennan as “Sam Diamond” and his Girl Friday) each have moments in which to shine, especially Falk and Smith. His Bogart imitation is more than creditable, and her sparkling way with a funny line reaches a kind of apotheosis when Niven whispers the meaning of necrophilia into her ear and she smiles wickedly before offering a masterpiece of upper class understatement. And when Simon has the inspired gall to invoke an old vaudeville line, Smith gives in to it, gloriously. Estelle Winwood, who was apparently never young, is even funnier as an elderly nurse than she was as “Hold Me, Touch Me” for Mel Brooks in The Producers and only Capote disgraces himself, although he’s less annoying now than he was when the picture was new if only for the opportunity he affords to study one of the more outré literary figures of the post-war era without having to worry that he’ll write another bad book.\n\nThe director, Robert Moore, was very successful in the theatre, where he staged among other things The Boys in the Band, Deathtrap, They’re Playing Our Song, Woman of the Year and Simon’s collaboration with Burt Bacharach and Hal David Promises, Promises. He had no particular style as a moviemaker but he knew how to frame a scene to the best advantage of his gifted cast, and how to pace what they do and say. In this he was aided immeasurably by the marvelous “old dark house” set designed by Stephen Grimes, Dave Grusin’s witty underscore and the wonderful poster and main title caricatures of the cast by Charles Addams.\n\nThe Ninth Configuration (1980) Among screenwriters and novelists, William Peter Blatty was perhaps the greatest argument against a strict Jesuit education. In a world which needs the healing laughter of a good comedy far more than an impassioned sermon on the afterlife, this gifted comic writer felt he wasn’t doing enough to convince the world that his God exists. Hence, the book and movie The Exorcist, and even the phenomenal success of those didn’t satisfy him. Going back to a previous novel (Twinkle, Twinkle, “Killer” Kane) that he felt was too formless Blatty sharpened and re-worked it as The Ninth Configuration, book and movie. And here I may seem to contradict my own critique of Blatty because, in spite of its author’s hectoring about faith, the final result is among the wittiest of post-war pictures, containing nearly as many quotable lines as All About Eve. Yet for all its strengths, which include a first-rate cast, it’s still a sermon, and not a very subtle one.\n\nFilmed in Hungary due to its financer, PepsiCo’s, stipulations, The Ninth Configuration concerns a government-run asylum peopled with psychological drop-outs from the Vietnam war and what happens when a new director, Colonel Kane, is brought in to run the place. In a series of Shavian arguments, Kane and the astronaut Captain Cutshaw engage in debate about, among other things, the nature of life, the existence of a deity and the possibility of life after death, surrounded by the most entertaining collection of creative loons this side of a Marx Brothers epic. It’s a one-of-a-kind movie, crammed with marvelous performances, scintillating dialogue and surprising moments of near-slapstick hilarity. And if the ending feels a last desperate act of proselytizing you may not mind when the rest of it is so unique and engaging.\n\nAlthough Blatty originally and disastrously cast the Scottish Nicol Williamson as Kane, Stacy Keach proved an inspired substitution, as did Scott Wilson as Cutshaw. Best among the supporting players are Ed Flanders as the asylum’s quietly acerbic resident physician with an agenda of his own, Jason Miller as an inmate determined to adapt Shakespeare for dogs and Neville Brand as the exquisitely frustrated Regular Army C.O. The splendid ensemble cast also includes George DiCenzo, Robert Loggia, Joe Spinell in an inspired performance as Miller’s carping assistant and, as a pair of sadistic motorcycle thugs, Steve Sandor and Richard Lynch. Aside from the evangelistic ending, I have only two additional complaints: I wish Moses Gunn’s role was larger, and that there was a little more of Barry De Vorzon’s very good music score. But if Blatty’s bent to religious propaganda was obsessive, it has to be admitted that he could certainly be an enjoyable nudze.\n\nSeven Days in May (1964) John F. Kennedy, who had been very keen on the movie of Richard Condon’s novel The Manchurian Candidate, which John Frankenheimer directed, was also enthusiastic about the potential of this adaptation of the Fletcher Knebel/Charles W. Bailey II thriller, to be directed by Frankenheimer as well. Kennedy had good reason to be; like the fictional President of the book, he was surrounded by traitors. Chief among these on the military front were the rabid anti-Communist General Edwin Walker and Kennedy’s own Air Force Chief of Staff, General Curtis LeMay, a monstrous psychopath who in addition to being the main model for the Burt Lancaster character here, was also the likely prototype for Dr. Strangelove‘s General Jack D. Ripper. Whether LeMay was involved in Kennedy’s assassination is, as with so many aspects of that murder, unproven (and probably unproveable). That he certainly shed no tears over JFK’s grave may be inferred with impunity. Kennedy knew to his cost that some of his worst enemies were not outside Washington but within his own Administration.\n\nThe President, alas, did not live to see the final product, for which he’d offered Frankenheimer the use of the White House, and by the time it hit the nation’s screens in 1964, the movie was doomed to low receipts by a ticket-buying public quite understandably wary of yet another violent coup, even if this one was fictional. Rod Serling’s adaptation is taut, and respectful of an almost perfectly-plotted novel, in which the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Lancaster) plans the removal of the President (Frederic March) over a treaty with the Soviet Union. The picture is beautifully cast, with March giving one of his finest screen performances. Although the character’s name, Jordan Lyman, is a little too close to Lyndon Johnson for comfort, Lyman is, thankfully, no LBJ. March depicts with delicacy and precision a decent man who knows his actions are unpopular but who obeys the dictates of his conscience. That’s how you know the movie is fiction.\n\nLancaster gives one of those performances of his which, like his J.J. Hunsecker in Sweet Smell of Success, are measured, inflexible, cold, and vaguely terrifying; his final face-off with March is one of the great scenes in 1960s American movies. Ava Gardner has a good scene with Kirk Douglas, Martin Balsam as March’s Chief of Staff makes you genuinely sorry when he’s removed from the narrative, Hugh Marlow and Whit Bissell are appropriately oily as two of the conspirators, John Houseman gives a nicely judged performance (his first on film) as a shady Admiral, and a young woman called Colette Jackson contributes a wonderful cameo as a bar-girl perspiring in the Texas heat. Douglas is asked to play it stalwart and well-intentioned as the Marine Corps Colonel who unwittingly stumbles onto the plot against the President and gives roughly the sort of performance you’d expect; if you like him, which I do, you’ll enjoy it well enough. Best of all in the supporting cast is Edmond O’Brien as a bibulous Senator enlisted to investigate the existence of a secret military base, his rich, slightly ham-actor baritone memorably caressing his lines. Interestingly, while the time of the movie’s action is unspecified (the poster says 1970 or 1980 “or possibly tomorrow”) Frankenheimer approached it as if it was indeed the future, with video hookups and devices that would not have seemed all that out of place in 2014… (DARPA probably developed them 50 years before that.) Jerry Goldsmith composed a brief, effective score performed solely by percussive instruments. For some reason everyone who writes about this music feels compelled to say “piano and percussion,” as if they’re not the same.\n\nVictor/Victoria (Broadway, 1995) The ill-advised stage musical adaptation by Blake Edwards of his wonderful 1982 comedy, filmed for Japanese television on its Broadway opening night. Edwards had the notion when the movie was still relatively new, and Robert Preston was attached as well as Julie Andrews until he had second thoughts, deeming the project unworkable and “an ego-trip” for Edwards. To make matters even more dismal, Henry Mancini died while the show was being written, his and Leslie Bricusse’s new songs are, almost to a number, boring, and the two written by Frank Wildhorn are even worse. Andrews famously lost her singing voice as an indirect result of reprising her movie role here, the Rob Marshall choreography is his usual uninspiring mélange of borrowed styles, Tony Roberts overdoes his nelly queen interpretation of Toddy appallingly, and the only surprises are Gregory Jbara’s wonderful performance in Alex Karras’ old role and Rachel York’s wildly funny interpretation of Lesley Ann Warren’s.\n\nThe Wind and the Lion (1975) Early 20th century history re-written as a paean to Theodore Roosevelt, and as only John Milius could have conceived it. Yet somehow, beyond its support of gunboat diplomacy and its hagiography of one of the worst imperialists in American history, it’s so intelligent, and so entertaining, you almost forgive its determined machismo. This is due in large part to the actors: Sean Connery as the Berber Raisuli who kidnaps an American widow and her young children, John Huston as John Hay and the great Brian Keith in a wonderful turn as TR — less the Roosevelt of history perhaps than of Milius’ besotted imagination; of the real TR the British Ambassador once warned his superiors, “We must never forget that the President is seven years old.” As the widow, Candice Bergen gives her standard slumming job, but the movie’s most appalling performances are those of Geoffrey Lewis as the Moroccan US Consul-General Samuel R. Gummeré and, even worse, Steve Kanaly as the most avid of the American invaders. The widescreen cinematography by Billy Williams is glorious, and Jerry Goldsmith’s score is one of his very best, with a genuinely rousing recurrent main theme and a gloriously rhapsodic liebeslied for Connery and Bergen. The form of the narrative is right out of a Boy’s Own adventure, but Milius’ attempts to tell it through the eyes of Bergen’s son (Simon Harrison) are ineffective; a dream sequence near the end which strives to make this notion concrete falls about as flat as an un-stuffed qatayef. But Milius does get points for depicting the love story tacitly and the kidnapped boy and girl not as the usual squeamish and terrified victims but as the cold-bloodedly curious beings children of their age actually are.\n\nSpeaking of children, in her scenes as the young Alice Roosevelt, Deborah Baxter seems so completely infatuated by Father that the look on her face as she gazes at him borders on the incestuous. Or was that meant by the filmmaker as a comment on the future Mrs. Longworth’s pathology?\n\nThe Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean (1972) John Milius again, this time as screenwriter solely, with John Huston directing. Hollywood (very much including Milius) liked to depict Bean as a hanging judge but history tells us he was no such thing. Walter Brennan won one of his 37 assorted Academy Awards playing Bean in the William Wyler-directed The Westerner opposite Gary Cooper, where his death was every bit as fabricated as the mythic end the screenwriter concocted for him here. For Milius and Huston, Roy Bean becomes a kind of Pecos Bill figure, and when at the climax he disappears into a burning building on horseback chasing down his nemesis and never re-emerges, he’s been given a mythic exit out of American folklore cross-pollinated by its Classical European counterpart. It’s an odd picture, which Milius, who had originally hoped to direct it with Warren Oats, claims Huston and his star, the “cutsie-pie” Paul Newman, ruined. But it’s also an engaging one, once you acclimate to its tall-tale characters and structure. Despite Milius’ complaints, Newman gives into the nonsense completely and he’s vastly entertaining. The large, starry cast includes Anthony Perkins as an itinerant preacher, Tab Hunter as an early victim of Bean’s jurisprudence, Anthony Zerbe as a dangerous San Antonio hustler, Ava Gardner as Bean’s idol Lillie Langtry, Ned Beatty as his barkeep, Jacqueline Bisset as his daughter and, as if Bisset wasn’t stunning enough, a luminous Victoria Principal as his common-law wife. Roddy McDowall fulfills, in his unique fashion, the role of Bean’s pompous banker antagonist and the best of the actor cameos are those by Stacy Keach as the psychotic Albino “Bad Bob” and Huston himself in a rich comic bit as Grizzly Adams. (If you’re of my generation it might interest you to know that Bean’s pet bear is Bruno, who performed on television as “Gentle Ben.”) There’s also a terrible, headache-inducing atonal score by Maurice Jarre which includes a pretty but pointless ballad performed by Andy Williams over a dopey picnic sequence that smacks of the producer trying to recapture the joy of Newman’s musical bicycle ride with Katharine Ross in Butch Cassidy. Need I say that it doesn’t?\n\n*At 79, Yakuma Canutt ended his storied career as the picture’s second unit director and oversaw that sequence.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\n“Marvelous” Marvin Hagler (66) Being implacably opposed to the concept of people punching each other for a living I’d frankly never heard of Hagler until recently, but his death sickens me, as does its propagandist corporate media coverage. Inveigled upon, as was Hank Aaron, to take one of the three experimental drugs currently being touted as miracles cures to “stem the COIVID pandemic,” and then to sheep-herd black Americans into doing the same, the otherwise healthy Hagler — also like Aaron — died “unexpectedly,” within days of his inoculation. Yet nowhere is the “coincidence” of either man’s death being suggested in the Mockingbird media as suspicious, or possibly related to the vaccine each had taken in the extremely brief brief period before the end of his life. Take a look at Hagler’s Wikipedia entry, if you will; search in vain for any mention of the vaccine. Even his widow is at pains to assure us that Hagler did not die from it. Such speculation, she and the vaunted Yahoo! Sports admonish us, is “reckless.” Far more reckless, apparently, than making the entire population of Earth your lab-rats in a world-wide controlled science experiment. Meanwhile, with physicians and hospitals being heavily bribed to list as many deaths as possible as “COVID-related,” even motorcycle accident fatalities are added to the corrupt mix if the deceased once tested positive.\n\nWake up. Please. Even if it may already be too late. Just wake up.\n\nYaphet Kotto (81) That for seven seasons he somehow got away with being miscast as an Italian-American police chief on Homicide speaks to how good an actor Kotto was. (The show’s writers were at pains to tell us that the character was half-Italian/half-black, but the actor’s dark pigmentation made this feel unlikely; the light-skinned Giancarlo Esposito when he showed up late in the series as Kotto’s estranged son, was far more believable.) Kotto’s imposing physique made him a natural as a criminal or its opposite, a figure of authority, but equally as a blue-collar working stiff. Kotto played them all, from boxers, factory workers and police detectives to James Bond villains and Idi Amin. Interestingly, in his early television work he was often cast in Westerns: The Big Valley, Death Valley Days, Bonanza, The High Chaparral, Daniel Boone, Gunsmoke. A replacement on Broadway for James Earl Jones in The Great White Hope, in 1970 Kotto made two fascinating movies, one each for the big and small screens: He was a young ex-con trying to make peace with the past but finding it identical to the present in The Liberation of L.B. Jones and a cab driver slowly realizing the man in his taxi is a fugitive from the law and forming an uneasy friendship with him anyway in the fascinating TV movie Night Chase. He went from playing a tough police lieutenant trying to cope with old-fashioned police brutality amid contemporary lawlessness in the uncompromising crime thriller Across 110th Street (1972) to assaying the suave, deadly Kananga (aka “Mr Big”) in Roger Moore’s debut as James Bond, Live and Let Die (1973) where he was, ludicrously, inflated to death by a compressed-gas pellet. He was also, with Richard Pryor and Harvey Keitel, one of a trio of embittered factory workers in Blue Collar (1978); Parker, the Nostromo‘s doomed chief engineer in Alien (1979); and an FBI agent in the entertaining buddy-comedy Midnight Run (1988).\n\nBut it was as Lt. Al “Gee” Giardello of the Baltimore P.D. in Homicide: Life on the Street (1993-199) that Kotto will be best remembered, and the role in which he most fully expressed his greatness as an actor. Based on the real-life shift commander Gary D’Addario of David Simon’s extraordinary book of reportage (subtitled A Year on the Killing Streets) Giardello was deceptively placid, almost serene, on the surface — at least as long as his detectives were on top of their cases and the system permitted him to operate as he saw fit. Stirred, he was fearsome. Enraged he could be terrifying, as when hierarchical politics kayo’d his achieving the higher office he was eminently qualified for: In perhaps the most shocking moment of a series full of them, his rage suddenly incandescent, he took a baseball bat to a set of lockers, and Kotto made us understand what decades of playing the game had taken from Lt. Giardello, and how much pride he’d had to swallow. He became in that moment the living embodiment of Langston Hughes’ raisin in the sun. That the fuse was long and the explosion years in coming did nothing to lessen the detonation. If anything, one imagines it increased the violence exponentially.\n\nGeorge Segal (87) One of the most genial, and gifted, actors of his generation, Segal has been a fixture in my personal movie Pantheon for much of my life — one of those essential figures I can’t quite imagine never having existed. Charming and craggily handsome, Segal was notable among his contemporaries for performing under an identifiably Jewish surname, but that hardly limited him to explicitly Semitic roles. Indeed, while on film he could scarcely hide his urban roots (you’d never cast him in a Noel Coward comedy) he was most often non-aligned. Obvious exceptions include the lead in the interesting but ultimately unsatisfying Bye Bye Braverman (1968), as the mother-ridden detective Moe Brummel in No Way to Treat a Lady (also 1968); the even more hag-oppressed Jewish son of the ultra-black comedy Where’s Poppa? (1970); Paul Mazursky’s Blume in Blume in Love (1973); and, possibly, the frustrated would-be writer Felix Sherman opposite Barbra Streisand in The Owl and the Pussycat (1970). The two played off each other so well, and so sexily, that I have long believed Segal would have been the perfect casting for Nick Arnstein in Funny Girl… which if nothing else would have spared us the Egyptian Omar Sharif’s miscasting as a Jewish gambler.\n\nWhile it was not his first movie role, the eponymous Corporal King in Bryan Forbes’ rather good 1965 adaptation of the James Clavell novel King Rat was Segal’s most prominent to date and deservedly led to high-profile roles in Ship of Fools (also 1965); a 1966 television version of Death of a Salesman in which he played Biff Loman opposite Lee J. Cobb; and, spectacularly, the part of Nick in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (also 1966), for which the entire cast was Oscar-nominated. For readers of Clavell’s book, Segal was the absolute embodiment of the Japanese prison camp inmate Corporal King; he captured the character’s cynicism, his ebullience, his opportunism, his charm and, at the end, his sense of total defeat. For King, liberation is the worst thing that could happen. It takes away his specialness, and when those who resented him before but who sucked up to him for what they could get turn against him, he is as good as dead, perhaps forever. And if Forbes’ work as a director is both less and more than one might wish — not as incisive as it might have been, and far more self-consciously arty than it needs to be — the haunted look Segal attains by the final fade-out is unforgettable. His Nick is equally ingratiating, and pitiable. All too eager to play whatever games are required to ensure his academic promotion, and realizing too late just how twisted his host and hostess’ marriage really is, Segal more than held his own against Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. (Although I never believe a man as intelligent as Segal’s Nick could remain married to a whining little nasal frump like Sandy Dennis, that is more a flaw in casting than a comment on the actor’s performance.)\n\nAmong Segal’s finest work as a serious actor is in the underrated (and under-seen) Ivan Passer-directed Born to Win (1971) in which he played a happy junkie on a downward spiral. In this same period he was also memorable as Kelp in the very funny William Goldman-written adaptation of Donald E. Westlake’s The Hot Rock (1972) opposite Robert Redford. His fine performance in Blume in Love is not merely marred but pretty much obliterated by the last third of that otherwise agreeable picture, in which he brutally rapes his ex-wife (Susan Anspach)… and she comes back to him! Fortunately, Segal’s next picture was the wonderful California Split, in which he played a degenerate gambler finally cured of his addiction by a massive winning streak. He was Sam Spade, Jr. in the good-looking but terminally dopey The Black Bird (1975) and although it was not the hit Universal had hoped, Segal (looking especially dashing in an uncharacteristic mustache) grounded the terrific Levinson and Link-written thriller-cum-disaster picture Rollercoaster (1977), a personal favorite of this viewer for over four decades.\n\nSegal’s post-1970s movie career was up and down, then down. Perhaps, had he not walked off the lot on the first day of filming for Blake Edwards’ 10, his mid-life career might have had a stronger arc. (Edwards and Orion sued, Segal counter-sued, and the actor ended up over a quarter of a million dollars poorer for the experience.) In 1993 he reflected, “I was disenchanted, I was turning in on myself, I was doing a lot of self-destructive things… there were drugs… I’m also sure I was guilty of spoiled behavior. I think it’s impossible when that star rush comes not to get a little full of yourself, which is what I was.” But if he was sorely missed in good big screen roles (by me, at any rate) he was for seven seasons more than welcome on the tube as the engagingly oblivious magazine publisher Jack Gallo on the generally smart and often surprisingly witty Just Shoot Me! (1997-2003).\n\nGeorge Segal died, as Eliot M. Camarena observed, not as a result of disease but through the leading killer of Americans: Medical treatment. Who advises a nearly 90-year old man to have bypass surgery?\n\nMorris Dickstein (81) Professor Dickstein’s 2009 Dancing in the Dark: A Cultural History of the Great Depression is one of the few books of popular history I would call essential. It’s wide-ranging (everyone from Fred Astaire to William Faulkner), informative, deeply researched, keenly observed, and written with wit and dexterity. As Maureen Corrigan noted in her review, Dickstein wore his erudition lightly, and his intelligence shines through on every page.\n\nI am sorry to report that he died of Parkinson’s; I hate to think of a mind as febrile as his tethered to a body that no longer cooperated.\n\nLarry McMurtry (84) Had he written no more than the novels Horseman, Pass By, The Last Picture Show and Terms of Endearment McMurtry’s place as a vital contributor to American popular culture would have been assured, if only through the movies made from them. (The adaptation of Horseman was Hud.) Being both inventive and prolific, however, he gave us several decades worth of additional books, including one he had originally conceived of as the screenplay for a movie to be directed by Peter Bogdanovich and to star John Wayne, Henry Fonda and James Stewart, all of whom stupidly passed on it. That one, about an epic trail drive, became Lonesome Dove, and made immortals of its lead characters: The fiercely stubborn Captain Call, the easygoing Gus McCrae, the well-meaning but doomed Jake Spoon, the traumatized Lorena Wood, Gus’ great love the redoubtable frontier woman Clara Allen and the sweet-natured adolescent Newt Dobbs who is probably Call’s illegitimate son but is never so acknowledged although Gus urges the Captain to do so before it’s too late. That’s not to mention the dim-witted Pea Eye Parker, the black former Ranger Joshua Deets, the drive’s mysterious cook Po Campo, the ill-fated Elmira Johnson, the rather terrifying Indian bandit Blue Duck and two curiously endearing pigs. The novel, weighing in at over 800 pages, was a spectacular success, winning the Pulitzer and inspiring a superb (if somewhat too brief) television miniseries in 1989 starring Robert Duvall (Gus), Tommy Lee Jones (Call), Anjelica Huston (Clara), Danny Glover (Deets), Diane Lane (Lorena), Robert Urich (Jake), Frederic Forrest (Blue Duck) and Ricky Schroder (Newt). Duvall, who is just about perfect, calls Gus his favorite role.\n\nThose who loved the movie Terms of Endearment may be shocked on reading its source to discover that most of its length is devoted to Aurora Greenway’s love life, that the feckless former astronaut Garrett Breedlove appears nowhere in it, and that daughter Emma only comes in at the end, for a fast life and death. While James L. Brooks was writing the screenplay and wrestling with the structure of the book, its author advised him not to stick too close to his work, encouraging Brooks to take off on his own. A fine screenwriter himself, McMurtry knew that a novel was a novel, a movie a movie, and that sometimes fealty to the original was ill-advised. In the late 1970s, when I picked up my first copies of American Film magazine the recurring column “McMurtry on the Movies” (most of which were later collected in a single volume called Film Flam) quickly became a favorite feature. And the movies were not merely a source of revenue when Hollywood optioned one of his novels; in 2006 he and Diana Ossana won an Academy Award for their beautiful adaptation of the influential E. Annie Proulx story “Brokeback Mountain” which among other things made it acceptable at last for America to consider cowboys in love with each other, or at any rate sharing more than their bedrolls.\n\nIn addition to what are sometimes, in our sequel-happy culture, called “standalone” novels, McMurtry developed series from several others: Three about a thinly-disguised version of his hometown Archer City and which include Horseman and The Last Picture Show; two following the mother and daughter Harmony and Pepper; five about Duane Moore, the Jeff Bridges character in Picture Show (the first of these, Texasville, was beautifully filmed by Bogdanovich); three Lonesome Dove follow-ups; and four in the Berrybender Narratives.\n\nMcMurtry was a serious writer whose books are often wildly funny, and he had a touch that was both literary in the best sense and accessible to almost any casual reader.\n\nG. Gordon Liddy (90) To paraphrase Bette Davis’ remark on the death of Joan Crawford, you should never say bad things about the dead, only good…\n\nGordon Liddy is dead.\n\nGood.\n\nOne of the few benefits of arriving at the cusp of one’s sixth decade is at least having lived long enough to bid adieu to the creeps and psychopaths who gave us six years of Nixon, two of Watergate and almost 50 in which to contemplate the horrors of both.\n\nText copyright 2021 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nCalifornia Split is a potsherd from a culture not all that far removed, chronologically, from our own but which in appearance, artistic accomplishment on a popular scale, the possibility of progress and of a general maturity is as ostensibly ancient, and as forgotten, as Carthage.\n\nWritten by the actor Joseph Walsh, himself a gambler (and who has an unsettling role in the picture as a mercurial bookie) and initially developed by, of all people, Steven Spielberg, California Split focuses on two speculators, the casual novice Bill (George Segal) and the degenerate Charlie (Elliott Gould) who meet during an acrimonious game of poker, form an odd friendship based almost entirely on their shared addiction, and, on their uppers, travel to a high-stakes poker meet in Reno where everything they have rides on Bill’s abilities. Although not originally intended as a Robert Altman movie, that admittedly terse précis certainly suggests his approach — seemingly meandering, shaggy-dog stories that illuminate their subjects, and their characters, in ways many more “daring” or “challenging” narrative techniques and stories fail to do, and what the overwhelming bulk of movies never even attempt.\n\nWith Altman at his considerable best, only the contours remained the same, by which I mean those readily identifiable personal traits that marked his filmmaking: The actors’ improvisations, the long takes, the large ensemble casts, the muted palettes, the zooms, the overlapping dialogue. But that is window-dressing, almost by the way. How Altman used film to explore human beings and their relationships to each other, which because it changed from film to film was never predictable, is what we should mean when we think of his work, or refer to anything as “Altmanesque.” In his and Brian McKay’s adaptation of the Edmond McNaughton novel McCabe, for example, what was removed was everything trite and predictable — the gambler dying on the street in Mrs. Miller’s arms, for example. Altman’s McCabe keeps muttering, “I got poetry deep inside me” when he hasn’t (and anyway, what man who is genuinely poetic needs to keep reassuring himself of it?) Yet at the end, sitting in the gathering snow with no witnesses to his murder, he’s become a beautiful metaphor: In death he is poetic… and Mrs. Miller is nowhere around; she’s deep in an opium dream, with Altman ending the movie on a close-up of the oblivion contained within her preternaturally glazed eyes. And that is poetry too.\n\nAlthough Altman had been experimenting with overlapping dialogue at least as early as MASH in 1970 and certainly relied on it in McCabe, especially in the long first sequence in the saloon, it was for California Split that he developed the multi-track recording system without which his follow-up, Nashville, would not have been possible; it enabled him to capture several conversations at once without our losing track of what’s important. It isn’t over-used in California Split, and never becomes oppressive, but during the opening poker sequence in a large, organized gambling establishment, it’s as essential as the many extras imported from the Synanon organization (or cult, if you prefer.) The faces, and the personalities, that come through in these scenes are both peripheral and essential; they’re the milieu into which we’re about to plunge, and they have a tang, an earthy charge, that ground the action and give it savor. I can’t imagine them in any other movie directed by any other filmmaker.\n\nDespite the cavalier desperation of Charlie and Bill, and the glancing sadness of the women in their lives, a pair of lower-middle class prostitutes played by Ann Prentiss and Gwen Welles, this is a surprisingly buoyant movie, and it lacks the mean-spiritedness that dogs so much of ’70s cinema, especially in the realm of the homophobic. I’m thinking specifically of the sequence in which Prentiss and Welles’ date with the transvestite “Helen Brown” (Bert Remsen) is upset by Bill and Charlie’s need to celebrate their winnings. Although the two, pretending to be vice cops, send the poor man scurrying, the fact that he’s in drag is not made an issue, nor do they abuse him for it; even if their playing with him could be seen as victimization, it’s not the kind of sequence that makes you squirm. You laugh along with it, and Remsen, who plays the role of “Helen” with astonishing delicacy, is somehow able to exit with most of his dignity intact. Indeed, neither Bill nor Charlie ever lets on to “Helen” that they know he’s anything but a well-dressed and sophisticated middle-aged woman, enabling him to maintain his own necessary fiction. Had the movie been made by a professional liberal of the period like Sidney Lumet, I shudder to imagine what Bill and Charlie would have done to the poor man. Calling him a queer would have been the least of it — they’d have probably beaten him up as well. Contrast this with the later bar scene in which a blowsy drunk (Sierra Bandit) spews alcoholic invective in a monologue of self-pity remarkable in its piggishness, hurling the word “faggot” at her absent boyfriend and anyone else who crosses her. She’s clearly meant to be an offensive boor and is treated as such, even by the disgusted bartender (Jack Riley) who’s obviously beyond caring whether she hears his sarcastic comments or not. Charlie and Bill may be cheerfully amoral but they don’t engage in deliberate ugliness. This puts them on a plane above Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John in Altman and Ring Lardner Jr.’s MASH, who, as Richard Corliss observed, in their modish “irreverence” occasionally behave like frat-boy bullies to anyone who isn’t on their special wavelength.\n\nIn a picture like this the side-long glance is as piquant as the piercing gaze, and the incidental figures have more impact than the leads in other, less alive and incisive movies. There’s a wonderful sequence in which Charlie takes the bus to the racetrack, and can’t get the seat his superstitions demand he take because each of the other riders has his or her own gambler’s fetish, leading to an elaborate switching of seats that is wonderfully farcical but which holds its own, demented logic. And even as Charlie exploits the trusting nature of the woman (Barbara London) he sits beside on the bus when he and Bill win on the long-shot horse Charlie has told her not to bet on she becomes furious at Bill, hilariously hurling oranges at him in her rage as he rides up an escalator. As written by Walsh and directed by Altman it’s a set of scenes at once quirky, idiosyncratic, wildly funny, thoroughly on point and absolutely in character. Bill will likely never see that woman again, but he’ll always remember her…. and so will we. How do you forget someone who throws oranges at you?\n\nLikewise, in an Altman movie even the extras and small-part roles resonate, like the hefty older woman in the opening poker scene, or the receptionist played by Barbara Colby in the magazine office at which Bill works. (A young Jeff Goldblum also shows up, as the editor, forever seeking the errant Bill, who ignores him.) The best and most memorable of these cameos is the Reno barmaid portrayed by Barbara Ruick. She hasn’t many lines, but with her engaging middle-aged mien, white cowboy hat, half-glasses, long hair, large grin, blasé good humor and un-self-conscious dance moves to a private melody only she can hear Ruick is, while nearly always in the background, intensely memorable; you want more of her.*\n\nPauline Kael, who admired the picture, felt the breakfast meeting between Bill and his bookie had the feel of an expository play scene, its neatness at odds with the looser structure of rest of the picture, but I demur. It helps us understand how close to the financial edge Bill has gotten himself in a relatively short period of serious gambling, and gives what has up to then been merely a disembodied voice on the other end of Bill’s telephone a bodily presence, a life and a psychology. Walsh had become by 1974 the furthest thing from the odd minor child star† he’d been in the ’50s; as the bookie called Sparkie his jumpiness and buried rage give him dimension, and weight. You judge that violence is not his first resort — he’s been carrying Bill for months — but that he’s getting closer to it, and that in turn makes explicable Charlie’s convincing Bill to take that all-or-nothing plunge in Reno. If the sequence is squarer than most of the others in the picture, neither does it feel false or unnecessary.\n\nElliott Gould’s gift for cheerful, amoral expansiveness suits Charlie perfectly. He accepts everything that comes his way, even being beaten up, robbed and having his nose broken by an abusive thug of a fellow gambler; before exacting vengeance, he expresses admiration for the punch he’s just received. Charlie lives for the chance, and in common with many degenerate gamblers it doesn’t seem to matter to him whether it’s big or small. (Early in their relationship he and Bill bet each other over the names of the Seven Dwarfs.) A clue to his character is that his girlfriend is a whore, a fact that never seems to bother him, except when it gets in the way of a celebration. That he doesn’t exhibit any of the standard masculine jealousy has less to do, I think, with Barbara (Prentiss) letting him crash at the apartment she shares with Susan (Welles) — unlike with Bill, we never see any other place Charlie calls home — than that getting upset about such an immutable fact of life would probably strike him as a waste of time that could be better spent on fun. He’s so loose and secure in his sexuality he isn’t self-conscious about smearing hot shaving cream on Bill’s abdomen after they’ve been beaten up, and doesn’t respond defensively when Barbara has a light suggestive response to walking in on them, just as he later and out of sheer ebullience gives Segal a public kiss on the lips during Bill’s winning-streak. In Gould’s equable performance, although Charlie can be annoying he is just about the happiest, most relaxed and likable wastrel you’ll ever see.\n\nPrentiss is amiable too, and endearingly protective of Welles, but Susan’s character is difficult to pin down. She doesn’t seem quite real, which is no reflection on Welles herself but on the conception of the role; although Susan is appropriately casual about her carnality — when she offers herself to Bill, it’s as if she’s giving him a freebie because she’s un-engaged, and bored, and he’s present — she falls in love with random johns (Bill included) and repeatedly lapses into crying jags over them. We can’t get a handle on her, and she finally becomes slightly irritating. Susan is the one area of the picture where I think Walsh, and Altman, blew it.\n\nBill is a far more successful creation, and I suspect Segal is largely the reason. Gould and Altman were gamblers, and Segal admits he was an innocent, which he used to help give Bill a naiveté that lets the audience in. He isn’t our surrogate, exactly, but he’s often as much at sea in Charlie’s milieu as we would be, and that confusion allows us access; when Charlie is explaining a system to Bill, he’s also telling us, but without seeming to, which would be fatal to the movie’s tone. It’s easy at this remove, in the years after he became a weekly comedic fixture on the television series Just Shoot Me, for an audience to forget what a fine dramatic actor Segal was, and is. (Not that an Academy nomination is or has ever been the final arbiter of quality but he got one, in 1966, for Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) As opposed to Gould, whose humor is brash, Segal is subtler, and more charming. The actors complement each other, and when at the end Bill has what, to employ an over-used word, we can only call an epiphany, Bill’s (or Segal’s?) reserve gives the moment its quiet power.\n\nThere’s a certain dread that goes with movies like this: The fear that you’re going to watch the main characters spiral so far downward there’s no going back, especially when, as it does here, everything rides on the outcome; it’s what happens in another under-seen George Segal picture from the ’70s, Ivan Passer’s 1971 study of a middle-class junkie, Born to Win. How Altman and his stars surmount that hurdle is exemplary, even if their muted ending upset the screenwriter. (Henry Gibson, in Mitchell Zuckoff’s oral biography of Altman, remarks that Walsh has been repeating that story “for the last 700 years.”) When Joseph Walsh’s previous collaborator saw the picture made of the script on which he had initially worked, he lamented that Altman had squandered the climactic final third. He, Spielberg, would, he said, have shaped the material in a way that would have stroked the audience’s response to a glorious orgasm. We can all too easily, and with a shudder, imagine the Spielberg version of California Split, and be doubly grateful he never got to make it.\n\nThe DVD in my collection is the 2004 Columbia Tristar release, and it’s in full widescreen. From what I hear, the aficionado should beware the later Mill Creek release, which while slightly (3 minutes) longer is not in the 2:35:1 aspect ratio; it’s allegedly in 1:85:1, which is a considerable difference in framing, and Paul Lohmann’s images are too good to be squeezed, or “panned-and-scanned.”\n\nI’ve seen California Split dismissed as “minor Altman,” but no movie that engages you on the levels this one does, or that so beautifully limns the contours of human personality and experience, is “minor” anything.\n\n* Horribly, the actress, the memorable Carrie Pipperidge of the 1956 Carousel, died of a cerebral hemorrhage during filming, which may account for the brevity of her appearance. Married to the composer John Williams, who scored Altman’s The Long Goodbye, Ruick left him a widower with three children. She is the Barbara to whom Altman subsequently dedicated California Split.\n\n† Walsh, who had a good role in Walter Hill’s minimalist 1978 crime thriller The Driver, is probably best-remembered as Danny Kaye’s Platonic (and hilariously Brooklyn-accented) young companion in Hans Christian Andersen (1953) — which, given the complex sexuality of both the Dutch writer and Moss Hart, the author of that movie’s screenplay — as well, possibly, of Kaye himself — feels like more than a bit of a dodge.\n\nText copyright 2019 by Scott Ross"
