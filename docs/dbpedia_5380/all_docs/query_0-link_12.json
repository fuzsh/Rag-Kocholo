        "text": "Lauren Bacall never had it so good as when she starred in Barbra Streisand’s 1996 directorial effort The Mirror Has Two Faces. At that point, Bacall had logged over 50 years in the film industry, yet of the major Hollywood greats, Bacall’s career always felt somewhat unfulfilled. Though she had one of the most exciting debuts in film history in Howard Hawks’ To Have and Have Not (1944), Bacall was forever linked with her husband, Humphrey Bogart. Their collaborations were legendary, and though Bogart – a major star when To Have and Have Not was released – was regarded as a significant performer, Bacall was somewhat dismissed.\n\nBy the time she was filming The Mirror Has Two Faces, Bacall was in the midst of late career resurgence of sorts. Though she had aged out of leading lady roles for over 20 years by that point, she still had the aura of a Hollywood legend, and was always on hand to lend some project – no matter how slight – with some dusty glamour. But none of the film projects she worked on in the 1980s or early 1990s really engaged with her as an actress. That is until Barbra Streisand cast her as the mother, Hannah Morgan, in The Mirror Has Two Faces.\n\nIn the film, Bacall not only uses her gifts as an actress but also her screen legend and persona. The film’s main theme is beauty and because Bacall has been an icon of cool beauty for much of her career, she brought a lot of that luster to the film, as well. Unlike many directors, though, Streisand was more intent on pushing Bacall, and challenging her, to wring out a great performance. And she did.\n\nBacall’s role in The Mirror Has Two Faces is the smallest of the leads, but she leaves the biggest impact. Streisand and her leading man, Jeff Bridges, while appealing, do little more than rote rom-com acting. They don’t do anything that Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks have done. They don’t do anything new to their roles, and though Bridges is very charming, there’s little reason to remember their work. The other actors: Mimi Rogers, Brenda Vaccaro, Pierce Brosnan, and George Segal act as little more than window dressing – attractive window dressing, to be sure, but window dressing nonetheless.\n\nBut Bacall is used more carefully and purposefully in the film. Though Streisand has tried to imbue the film with far more depth than it deserves, she does successfully manage to create poignancy and candor when directing Bacall, who had rarely been given the opportunity to do such personal work.\n\nWe first see Bacall in an early scene, emerging from the shadows. The setting is a church, and Claire (Mimi Rogers) is getting married, with sister Rose (Streisand) as her frumpy bridesmaid. Claire is fuming at Hannah’s tardiness and hisses that the Morgan sisters should have had their mother committed. When Rose laughingly counters that people can’t be committed for excessive vanity, we suddenly hear a whiskey-stained voice call out, “Thank you, Rose,” before we see Hannah move out of the shadow to deliver the rest of her line, “How wonderful to have two compassionate daughters.”\n\nShe steps into the light and shrugs off a large cape to reveal a beautiful purple ensemble that defies the traditionally self-effacing mother-in-law dress. Immediately we’re clued into the kind of character Bacall is playing – one who is defined by her beauty and elegance. Claire, who is beautiful and resplendent in her wedding gown is fuming because she’s in danger of being overshadowed by the dashing Hannah.\n\nThe scene that follows has the three characters march through a narrow hallway, hurrying to get to the wedding, while fussing at each other. Actually, Streisand does something interesting because she positions herself in the background, letting Bacall and Rogers dominate the scene – it’s a clear why to position the dominance of the characters in the film. The dynamic of the three women is heavily reliant on the women’s assertiveness (which is tied to their physical beauty and confidence). Rose is a shrinking violet, and lets herself, literally shrink in the scene, as the more obviously glamorous Bacall and Rogers march up front. When they bicker, they are presented as equals, each with a personal agenda that meets together: the desire to be the center of attention.\n\nWhen they finally do make it to the ceremony, Hannah struts up to the alter and preens for the cameras, while the congregation murmurs in approval. Bacall’s introduction to the film is at her most glamorous and beautiful, recalling her image during her Hollywood heyday. This representation is important because the character’s vanity is based on her aging beauty. We’re reminded periodically about Bacall’s days as a modelesque stunner with strategically placed portraits around Hannah’s apartments that are actually old head shots of Bacall from the 1940s and 1950s.\n\nThis isn’t the first time in Bacall’s career that she has fallen into a role that is so referential. In 1981, she starred in the slasher pic, The Fan (dir. Ed Bianchi), in which she played a fictional version of herself named Sally Ross. The film’s script – based on Bob Randall’s novel – is a thinly-veiled homage to the Lauren Bacall of 1981 (Broadway Lauren Bacall). But when we see Sally’s stalker in his home environment, it’s a virtual shrine to her – and his flat is wallpapered with old studio stills, lobby cards, posters, and head shots. It’s convenient for both Bianchi and Streisand that they have access to so much material that depicts their characters at a younger age.\n\nThe fact that Hannah lives in a stately Manhattan apartment with glamour shots of herself, carefully placed throughout the apartment is an interesting detail that tells us a lot about this woman. The first time we see this vainly eccentric tic is in a dinner scene between Rose and Hannah. It’s a short scene in which a lot about the dynamic is revealed: namely that though the two women seem codependent with each other, there’s also hostility. Hannah snipes at Rose, the two play tug-of-war with the remote control and when Hannah tries to boast that a customer at her beauty salon couldn’t believe how old she was, Rose quipped, “How old were you?”\n\nWhile this scene is playing out, just over Hannah’s left shoulder we see a framed, black and white head shot of Bacall – probably from publicity for To Have and to Have Not or The Big Sleep (dir. Howard Haws, 1946) Streisand does a smart trick in that we see the contrast whenever there’s a close up of Hannah grousing at Rose.\n\nThe next time we see an old glamour shot of Bacall is in a striking example – very quick – after Rose marries Greg Larkin (Bridges) in a civil ceremony and the two have moved in together. When Rose is making herself at home, she places a faked portrait of her parents together – a doctored photo which has an old Bacall head shot spliced with a photograph of Streisand’s late father, Emanuel.\n\nThe next scene that includes an old Bacall picture is the most significant instance. After Rose leaves Gregory because the two had an awful row, she comes back to her mother’s hoping, but not expecting, some sympathy. She had a fight with Gregory because she was feeling unattractive. Vulnerable and sensing that she wasn’t pretty, she reaches out to her mother, but her mother’s standard guard is up. When Rose finally sits down, she asks her mother a straight question: “what was it like to be beautiful?” Next to Rose is yet another picture of Bacall at her physical peak.\n\nThis instance of including a head shot is important because Rose is not only confront her mother about a childhood of aloofness and distance, but she’s also forcing her mother to confront her aging. When she asks her mother about being beautiful, she talks in past tense as if all that were over. And it’s not difficult to see that Hannah’s hauteur is a way to mask her insecurities over being an aging beauty. It’s here that Streisand really gets some beautiful work from Bacall, as she zooms in for a close, tight close up, and Bacall recalls being a young beautiful starlet. Her face – worn with time, but still gorgeous – seems to summon up that time when she was at her plummy youth, and she’s in constant reminder of that anytime she wanders around her apartment. “It was wonderful,” she says through moistened eyes as she remembers being the belle of the ball.\n\nIt’s at this moment that Streisand, Bacall, and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese elevate the movie into something special. The three conjure magic by exploiting Bacall’s storied history, and she in turn can reference what it was like to be fêted as a great beauty. The memories of those great times (when she was a magazine cover girl) wash over her face. Streisand’s close up is unforgiving and Bacall’s wearing a minimum of makeup (it’s supposed to be the middle of the night) and so it’s a terribly vulnerable moment because not only is the normally reserved and stoic Hannah indulging in a moment of such bruising candor, but she’s also doing this without makeup, which is part of her arsenal.\n\nThe next scene with Bacall and Streisand takes place the next day. Hannah hasn’t slept all night after her talk with Rose – it’s a moment of redemption and reconciliation for the two as Hannah realizes the damage she caused by her withholding affection and praise. Over a kitchen table, an exhausted Hannah is reflective. “It’s a terrible thing you’ve done to someone my age. Leaving me alone with my thoughts.” Like the confrontation scene before, Streisand lingers on Bacall’s face, again, raw and barely made up (though still beautiful, but in a rougher way) It’s in this scene that the actress makes the case that she was robbed of that Oscar everyone thought she was going to win. It’s not a scene with a gigantic, cathartic cry. Instead, Hannah talks about regret and “settling.”\n\nLaGravanese’s script isn’t great in the movie – and neither is Streisand’s directing, frankly – but they manage to conjure some movie magic in that one scene with Bacall’s assistance. When Hannah tries to verbalize just why she allowed herself to “settle” she expresses not only a lifetime of regret (the sort of “coulda, woulda, shoulda” regret) but also the cold reality of aging. The dialogue is moving – as is Bacall’s work, particularly in how she modulates her tone, shifting from dreaminess, to incredulity, and finally to acceptance.\n\nAs she absently plays with a lock of her hair, she begins the soliloquy with the devastating assertion that “It’s an awful thing to look back at your life and realize you’ve settled. The problem was that I always thought I had more time. ” It’s at this point, that Bacall’s delivery pivots from a sleepiness to an urgency – she wants her daughter to understand where some of their shared hostility came from. She searches for the right words to say, she stumbles as she tries to articulate her feelings: “I was…I mean, now…Inside, I feel young, like a kid, like it’s just the beginning…I have everything ahead of me.” And then she answers her equivocation with a firm, “But I don’t.” She then admits that she’s jealous of her daughter.\n\nIt’s a sterling scene – a excellent gem in an otherwise mediocre film. After this confrontation, the two women seem to patch things up, and Streisand’s Rose goes on a major diet and exercise kick, remaking herself into a glamazon. Bacall’s character after that is somewhat marginalized, and she doesn’t have much to do anymore. She has one final scene in which she is on a date with an old gentleman who is flipping through a photo album. With her early hauteur and vanity returned, she asks the old man which photo he liked best. He shrugs and admits that he finds her most beautiful now, in her old age. “Good answer,” she purrs.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that in the same year that Bacall was in The Mirror Has Two Faces, she also had a supporting role in the comedy My Fellow Americans (dir. Peter Segal). The film was part of a then-popular formula of pairing Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon after their successful comeback films Grumpy Old Men and Grumpier Old Men. Matthau was too ill to participate, so Hollywood and TV veteran, James Garner took his place. Bacall played Jack Lemmon’s onscreen wife. The role was exceedingly small and more typical of the kinds of roles Bacall was getting up to that point – essentially, glorified cameos that traded on her style, wit, beauty, and history. She was always on hand to class up a scene or two, and her role as former first lady Margaret Kramer was no different.\n\nBut Bacall’s role as Hannah Morgan brought the actress some of the best reviews of her career, and she was clearly a highlight of the film. It also generated Oscar buzz – something that roles like Hannah often do. There’s a minor tradition in the film industry, in which an older, veteran performer – often an actress – is seemingly plucked out of late-career obscurity to play a supporting role, usually of a mother or grandmother. Many older actresses found late career renaissances in that trope: June Squibb, Gloria Stuart, Rosemary Harris, Joan Plowright, Jessica Tandy, Ann Sothern, Peggy Ashcroft, Kim Stanley have all benefited from this renewed affection. Bacall was nominated for an Academy Award – the first time in a 50-year career, and though she was a favorite to win, she lost the award to Juliette Binoche for The English Patient.\n\nIn an interview with Barbara Walters on the night of the Oscar ceremony, Bacall was asked whether the nomination was a lifetime achievement award. Bacall briefly bristled at the thought and insisted that it was about the work. But it was about both, because the role itself is a lifetime achievement role. If the role had been played by another actress – even one that is better, more skilled, than Bacall – the role would’ve had a different impact, a lesser one, and I don’t think it would felt as singular as it did. Maureen Stapleton – a far more resourceful actress than Bacall – played Streisand’s mother in the courtroom drama Nuts, and predictably was excellent, but it lacked the unique impact that Bacall’s Hannah had (even though Stapleton had far more screen time in her film) What made Hannah Morgan such a plum role is that it was a perfect combination of right star, right time, right director, right writer. It’s important that when we’re introduced to Bacall’s Hannah, she makes an entrance. If nothing else, one could say that Lauren Bacall’s film career was all about impact. She was a star first and actress second, and The Mirror Has Two Faces was the only film in which the script understood that."
