        "text": "Big- I just had sex with a 12 year old!\n\nThe Majority of the body swapping movie genre is from Man/woman to child. Probably the most popular of these types of movies is “Big” with Tom Hanks. Most consider this movie a likable, nostalgic look at youth and coming to grips with the demands of adulthood. I have three main problems with this film: 1) Tom Hanks is known, in many movies such as Splash and his days on Bosom Buddies as being childishly playful and a major goofball. So, when it comes to him inhabiting the persona of a boy in Big I really didn’t see that much difference between this role and a lot of his light comedic roles. If anything, he just upped the goofy/awkward thing just a touch. 2) The second thing which bothered me about the film was that the Toy Company Boss automatically goes along with any nut-ball idea Hanks has about product development merely because Hanks’ character seems enthusiastic and interested in toys… Not exactly qualities which would normally set him apart in the toy industry. 3) finally, when Hanks’ character reveals to his work associate/lover that he’s really only 12 years old, the woman seems only mildly taken aback. Most women who just found out they slept with a 12 year old would be majorly skeeved perhaps even in seeking religious guidance and indulging in multiple showers. Maybe its just that this woman’s regular cut-off for romantic partners is 11 year olds.\n\n13 Going on 30…going on what the $%&!\n\nIn this popular body swapping movie a girl suddenly jumps ahead from 13 to 30 and again a likeable girl, Jenna Rink played by a pre-Affleck divorce scarred Jennifer Garner learns how to navigate the tough, competitive waters of magazine publishing. However, the girls transition to sudden womanhood is never really explained. Prior to her pre-mature aging, she is presented with a home-made diorama given to her by her childhood friend, Matt (Mark Ruffalo). Then suddenly, some “magic farie dust” shimmies off the diorama and transports her ahead 17 years in the future. In the future, Garner’s character again befriends Ruffalo’s character and quickly realizes that he’s a really nice guy and definitely boyfriend material. A jaded movie-viewer like myself, then, would conclude that Ruffalo’s character was actually an evil wizard who designed the diorama and Garner’s trek in the future all for the purposes of just getting himself laid. At least it would give some semi-reasonable explanation for the film’s insane premise.\n\n17 Again A grown man revisits his youth only to be boring\n\n17 again is a mediocre body swapping/time travel movie that falls into the same dull mold. Matthew Perry plays the adult version of the boy (in the film for about 10 minutes) and Zac Effron plays him as a teenager. Aside from Effron making a very unconvincing man trapped in a boy’s body, the film does not allow the teenager the freedom to blow off steam. The wish-fullfillment aspect of getting to revisit one’s youth is completely lost here. Effron’s character is chivalrous, straight-laced, and even lectures his fellow classmates on temperance and love before sex. How many of us if given the chance to go back to being a teenager would do any of that unless we became born again Christians?\n\nPeggy Sue Got Married…She also boinked a beatnik!\n\nPeggy Sue Got Married is not precisely a body swapping movie more of a time travel movie since Kathleen Turner is herself in the whole film. But because most of the cast views Peggy’s character as herself as a teenager (while she is knocked unconscious) I’m going to include it in this genre. I believe this is one of the best if not the best film in this genre mainly because Kathleen Turner is able to effectively play both childhood exuberance and jaded adulthood with equal finesse. The film is also effective because it finally allows an adult with a second chance at youth to finally live out some dreams and have some fun. It is frankly amazing that in a genre so interested in nostalgic youth, the film makers insist on making their characters cling so fiercely to their boring, staid adulthood (ie 17 Again, Freaky Friday, Vice Versa). Instead, Turner’s character tells off the class bully, raids the family liquor cabinet, befriends the class nerd, and even boffs her school beatnik. She is able to realize most of the things she thought her life was missing and-if the end result was less than completely satisfying- at least she was allowed by the film-makers to make the journey.\n\nNotting Hill- Julia Roberts, she crazy!!!!!\n\nMost people who enjoy the film, “Notting Hill”like the charming bi-play between the movie star (Julia Roberts) and the commoner/befuddled travel book-shop owner, Hugh Grant. But, if you bother to look for logic and realistic reactions (in a romcom are you crazy?!!!) it does seem that Julia Robert’s character is simply batshit crazy. Instance 1: after grant spills coffee all over Robert’s blouse (something that normally drives celebs crazy—when their clothing is suddenly and randomly attacked by a stranger) Roberts suddenly kisses Grant full on the lips. Instance 2: Alec Baldwin (julia’s former lover) surprises Roberts in her Hotel Room its a little bit awkward with Hugh Grant there so Roberts, like any rational woman in the same situation, decides to… leave the country. Instance 3: Roberts and Grant are photographed in skimpy attire after emerging from Grant’s Notting Hill Flat so, rather than explaining/holding a press conference or simply avoiding reporters for a while, Robert’s thinks its safer/more incognito to, you guessed it, leave the country. Then, finally when Roberts realizes that she truly loves Grant, she decides to give him a token of her affection and gives him an original Marc Chagall painting. I guess they were out of Whitman Samplers at the Drug Store.\n\nDreamgirls- Jamie fox’s Acting Has Left The Building\n\nJamie Fox is one of our most reliable actors his breakout performance in Collateral and Oscar Winning Turn in Ray show his versatility and gift at characterization. It is astounding, then, that in a film so highly regarded for its music and acting (Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson both Oscar nominating and winning) that Fox seems to stink up the screen so much. In re-watching the film recently, I couldn’t hit upon one scene in which Fox seemed to be reacting realistically to what was around him. He grins, smirks, and stares wide-eyed at each set of circumstances like he was some random guy that just wandered onto the set off the street. Even in the ending frame when he is supposed to be shocked to discover that Effie has a daughter and that he might be somehow connected to her birth (ya think?) his expression seems as real and genuine as Gary Coleman’s expression when he says, “Wotchu talkin’ bout Willis”. I’m not sure why Fox sucks so bad in this film and why its never talked about in any review but I urge you to watch it again and convince me he’s not the Jar Jar Binks of Dreamgirls.\n\nOther Things that always bothered me about other classic movies?\n\n*Rob Morrow’s thick “bahstonian” accent in “Quiz Show” more scandalous than any cheating going on by Van Doren\n\nIn “Good Will Hunting” why does the plagiarizing dick at the Harvard Bar tell Matt Damon’s character that he likes apples? I know it sets up the verbal beatdown line by Damon, “I got her number, how about them apples” but the pony-tailed dick doesn’t seem the apple munching type. I’m thinking a nutrition bar is more in his wheelhouse.\n\n*In Whiplash, why does the film’s protagonist, Andrew break up with Nicole, Melisssa Benoist? I guess its to paint him as more as a drumming fanatic who doesn’t have time for romance in his life. it does seem rather abrupt in the film and Benoist’s character was the least cloying girlfriend I’ve ever seen depicted in film. Also, she went on to be TV’s Supergirl, so I think Andrew missed the boat a bit there too.\n\n*Mr Holland’s Opus- Those who can’t do Teach\n\nThroughout the bulk of Mr Holland’s Opus, Teacher Glen Holland cannot find the time to compose a symphony which, if the story would have us believe, once completed will net him fame and riches. Its a little hard for me to believe that in a teaching career of 30 plus years that-no matter how busy he is- the man cannot string together 10 minutes here and there (bathroom visits, waiting for a bus, getting up an extra 10 minutes early for work) to finish one piece of music but so be it.\n\nAt the tail end of the film though, the man does finally manage to complete /peform his “American Symphony” in front of a full auditorium of his most adoring students and faculty and…well, the piece just is not all that good. Its bombastic enough but very repetitive/derivative and does not exactly leave Johann Sebastian Bach quaking in his grave and I have never, outside of this film, ever heard anybody else ever using this piece of music for anything ever. They should just have ended the film with the inspiring speech about his students being his opus blah blah and perhaps had ended the film with a more classic musical composition. So,the unintended irony I’m left with is not that Holland had a fuller life (just like in Its A Wonderful Life) because he touched people but, in actuality, that he made the correct career decision because he was an effective and inspirational teacher but a lousy, or at least un-inspiring composer.\n\nAs Sylvester stallone knows only too well after having to come up with 6 Rocky’ flicks, Its hard to make an original boxing film. Even before Rocky you had films like “The Champ” and “Somebody Up There Likes Me” which were already about underdog boxers chasing the title. in 1976 Sylvester stallone brilliantly re-invented the genre with a more contemporary sensibility and inspirational modern score. The first Rocky film took its time, and allowed you to get to know and appreciate all the characters. Unfortunately The newer films/sequels were like shortened Best of clip reel: workout scenes, power ballads, motivational speeches, and a victorious fist raised in the air at the end to serve as story.\n\nThrough it all, front and center in the rocky films was of course Rocky Balboa immortalized by Sly. Rocky as a character was interesting because, in addition to boxing, he loved animals, had a thing for the mousy pet store worker down the street, had a sparring brotherly relationship with Paulie and his Loan Shark Employer, and developed a deep father/son vibe with Micky his soon-to-be trainer He was a “neighborhood guy” a lovable lug. In essence, The first Rocky did a lot to establish him as a character even before he put on gloves.\n\nSylvester Stallone is largely the hero of this new Creed film. Retired, old, and tired, Rocky has to curl his pain into words instead of a fist. The script allows him to be in turns reflective, nostalgic, and wise in a way that his characters haven’t quite been able to tap into before because they were too busy training. To me, the film could have been called, The trainer, and it would have been equally apt. Stallone is the heart and soul of Creed and if Stallone doesn’t at least get an Oscar Nomination for his performance I would be very surprised.\n\nWhere the film falls down a bit for me is in the performance/writing of the film’s main character, Adonnis Creed. The character of, Adonnis father, Apollo Creed, was larger than life. A brash, fast talking champ in the style of Mohammed Ali. His son, Adonis creed, is unfortunately monosyllabic and dour through large stretches of the film so its hard to really build up a lot of enthusiasm for him as a character. Sure he’s bitter because his father Apollo died and he has to fight against his image in the ring but is that it, is that all he is bitter? The film does try and humanize him a bit with a romance with a local singer but his character is both under-written and the actor himself is largely undemonstrative. What we are left with as an audience is simply to root for Adonnis because he is a good Boxer and his father was a legend. This is not enough for me. He also has to be likable. Its also hard to see where his true love and passion for boxing comes from because he has a corporate job and seems more of a boxing hobbyist when the film begins. also, unlike Rocky, Adonnis doesn’t have any kind of an entourage.His mom is kind of a cameo, his former boss, and would be trainer are off the screen quicker than a first round TKO. So, He’s basically a loner. Without a Paulie in his world to “bust his chops a little” or an Adrienne to keep him on the straight and narrow, Adonnis just seems a little too self-involved and boring.\n\nAside from the limitations of the main character, however,The film is a nice, gritty, if not highly original fight film. The plot, of course, features the well worn grooves of most rocky films and throws in everything that has worked. The film even borrows liberally from the ill-advised Rocky 5 installment where Rocky trains a boxer who just “shows up” in his neighborhood because he asks. Underdog chasing the title, facing adversity, working out, etc. the goes through the familiar beats Of course we know that Rocky will eventually go out of retirement, acquiesce and train Adonnis. In the wacky (one more round) Rocky Universe, who knows, its not even out of the question to assume that, if asked by Adonnis, Rocky may have even consented to put on his own moth eaten boxing trunks and step into the ring one more last time.\n\nThe film, I feel, could have touched/mirrored on one of the more interesting things about father Apollo Creed’s ultimate demise in the ring. Apollo died in the ring (in Rocky 4), not just because he was a fighter and wanted to go out fighting but he also ventured back into the ring because of ego and nationalist sentiment. He didn’t want the Russians (evil) to win. the Us against Them vibe of the cold war. I’m not suggesting that they have Adonis battle a member of a group like Isis to make it relevant politically (Although that might be interesting if they were able to do it without being insensitive or cornball- no small feat) but perhaps they could have drawn a parallel to Adonis own ego and that he boxes for some larger goal: pride, equality, self-hood, or his place in society/ the world to give him a larger motivation to box other than the mere competition aspect.\n\nSome may think it unfair for me to compare Creed with Rocky. But with a plot so familiar to every other Rocky film, its hard not compare the new incarnation to its classier predecessors. Throughout much of the film, Adonnis is called “Baby Creed” and must work his butt off to, stand on his own, and get out of Apollos shadow. I think he has a bigger problem than that, to break out of Rocky’s shadow and with Sly’s previous 6 films and his charismatic presence in Creed, Rocky is still the champ for me. But see the new Creed film for yourself and see if you agree.\n\nThere are tons of Romantic Comedies out there so I thought its high time I compile a list of the Best/almost best/and the downright worst of this entire genre. Here it is:\n\nThe Best (in no particular order)\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally- Probably the gold-standard of the genre. the one weakness is that for me Billy Crystal is, at times, a little Shticky. Doing his stand-up nebishy personna in a couple of scenes which detracts a little from the films authenticity.\n\nThe Goodbye Girl- snappy Neil Simon dialogue and characters which bristle and best thing yet, no obligatory best friend character to weigh down the plot.\n\nSilver Linings Playbook- two people united in their neurosis. What love should be. The drug comparison scene could have gone on a bit more. Not sure why comedian, Chris Tucker is in the movie but…\n\nThe Graduate .kind of an incestuous as rom-coms go but has The father of all wedding interruption scenes at the end. Elaine Elaine! (not said in a Jerry Seinfeld voice)\n\nSideways- not sure if many people consider this a romcom, more of a wine country odyssey but a strong cast, a wonderfully loopy Thomas Haden Church. Sure it’s a stretch that Virginia Madsen would be into Paul Gimatti but he’s such a good actor it almost seems credible.\n\nBridget Jones Diary- Yes it’s a remake of Pride and Prejudice. But a klutzy, socially awkward Rene Zelwegger is a good spin on the Elizabeth Bennet Character. I’m surprised enterprising food execs didn’t launch a line of “Blue Soup” after the movie was released.\n\nAs Good as it gets/something’s gotta give. Kinda interchangeable in my book. Romcoms for the older generation Who’d have thought Jack Nicholson would make a good romantic lead. Certainly not shelly Duvall in “The Shining”\n\nTootsie- Good romcom Best man in drag movie. Sorry Mrs Doubfire and Victor Victoria. the hilarious agent scene should make this film at the top of any list including a romcom.\n\nFilms That Almost Made The List\n\nThe Owl and The Pussycat- sort of a low rent “The Goodbye Girl” (with the romantic leads sharing an apt together) with a nerdy/ likeable pre- Just Shoot Me, George Segal and the ditzy sometimes hooker Barb Streisand in probably her most likeable role. Cool score also by Blood Sweat and Tears and who wouldn’t want the sun to “Spit morning” into their face? or take in a mid-afternoon screening of “Cycle Sluts”.\n\nNotable films that didn’t make the list and why\n\nNotting Hill- . I kept thinking Julia Roberts kept over-reacting and leaving Hugh Grant/England for no good reason long periods of time. Also whoever wrote the line, “Im also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her” should be shot.\n\nPretty woman- Okay but overrated. Hard to get the appeal of the film without Julia Roberts and Richard Gere’s attractiveness and show me a world which allows George Costanza to almost rape Julia Roberts.\n\nLove Actually- Edit out the stupid subplot about the English guy trying to score in a US bar whose only patrons are Supermodels (this bar isn’t listed anywhere on Zagat) and the annoying subplot with Laura Linney who experienced coitus-interruptis at the hands of her handicapped/call-dial-happy brother and you might have a bearable film here. Also keep your skepticism in check as a young lovesick boy is able to evade and rush past airport security checkpoints to tell the girl he loves her.\n\nHorrible RomComs to avoid\n\nWhat If- horrible, no comedy, no chemistry, lame payoff at the end.\n\nSomething borrowed- Only watch if you think its a good time to watch Ginnifer Goodwin tear up for two hours\n\nMaid of Honor- one of the most derivative romcoms I’ve ever seen. Finding love with the best friend, a bizarrely cast best friend character (kadeem Hardison) can’t even strike an original chord with a trip to Scotland. and as a side note, who doesn’t crash someone’s wedding on horseback?\n\nHistorically I have always hated politics and anyone who takes strong stances on anything outside their direct experience tiresome to listen to. I do, however, enjoy the theater of politics. I enjoy debates because, despite politicians being able to identify a problem and volunteer a solution (take an immediate and clear action, impanel a committee, make it a #1 priority on “day one” of their administration), usually the politician who is less objectionable cosmetically (looks at their watch less, takes more modest sips of water than their challenger, rubs their nose rather than picking it, smiles rather than grins, and pronounces the names of foreign leaders with more finesse than their competitors wins.\n\nDespite my aversion to anything involving policy or the daily workings of government, even the casual observer does have to admit that it was a big week in politics.\n\nLast Saturday Bernie Sanders was mimicked and reduced to a caricature by Larry David on SNL. Their similarity in voice and “rumpled-ness” of demeanor is hard to dispute and, consequently, the internet went bonkers in celebration and Larry David landed himself an excellent post-Curb gig. Soon, It got so bad that When Biden Suddenly dropped out of the race for president its quite possible that his thought processes went something like this: “After careful deliberation, I have concluded that I do not believe in my heart that SNL has any cast member who is competent enough to impersonate me in a sketch. That show rises or falls based on its ability to nail its political satire. With me as a candidate, they have to settle with some second rater like Kyle Mooney trying to impersonate me…and that’s just not something I can, in good conscience, allow.”\n\nLater in the week we learned that former president George W Bush suddenly resurfaced to give his candid impressions of republican candidate, Ted Cruz. “I just don’t like the guy”. In the coming weeks I also look forward to Bush’s other poignantly stated and randomly unsolicited opinions. like “Carly Fiorina…she looks like someone whose hair smells”\n\nThis week we also learned that Jeb Bush finds the actress who plays Supergirl “Hot”. Creepiness aside, I think this revelation opens a door into Jeb’s unconscious desire to meet a powerful woman who will, like he said about his brother George W post 9-11, “Will keep him safe”.\n\nLastly, we were witness to the spectacle Hilary Clinton’s Bengazi hearings. Through 11 hours of tough questions, it was reported that Hilary Clinton used the techniques of Yoga to stay relaxed. I wonder if she was able to mirror the practices of many Yogis who, through careful meditation and biofeedback, are able to slow her heartbeat from 88 beats to 32 beat per minute In that case, its quite possible that the former first lady was able to maintain a semi-conscious state broken only by certain involuntary motions of the body such as rapid eye movements and the noisy expulsion of gas.\n\nRight after the Benghazi hearing, Hilary appeared on the Rachel Maddow Show and explained that the first thing she did after the hearing was to eat Indian food and drink beer/wine with her associates. Wow, who knew she could be that relatable! That is such a coincidience. After a tough 11 hour grilling from the Bengazi committee, I also like to kick back, flanked by my closest advisors, with a little chicken tikka and a good bottle of the ol’ Pinot.\n\nRon Rifkin\n\nhow many roles can this man get playing the concerned father? Age, it seems,has not been kind to him. He looks high strung and particular. constitutionally, He just looks like the kind of guy who would send his food back a couple of times and still eat it under protest demanding extra table condiments. Maybe Rifkin should consider going on along vacation where he can just decompress…or maybe someone should just give him a token emmy or tony already so he can just breathe out already.\n\nLeslie Mann\n\nPerennially cast as the Taken-for-granted and ignored wife in such films as The Other Woman, 17 again, knocked up, and this is 40. She’s in so many bad marital relationships in films and always plays the victim. However, now my assumption, as an audience member, is that she’s in so many failing relationships, that maybe she’s the problem. Instead of my sympathy going out to her, now I’m like what is wrong with you that you’re driving all these men away? Analyzing her movie work, I’ve come to the conclusion that her “go to”acting expression when the camera is on her is a cutting smirk where she seems to be looking at her husband and seems to be thinking: “geez look at this guy, I could have done so much better”. Maybe if she looked less like she was constantly rating her husbands like a good watermelon, maybe she would be cast in more happy marriages.\n\nMichael Cera\n\ncast as the well-intentioned nerd in such films as Juno, Scott The Pilgrim, and Superbad and just about everything thing else he ever did. Obviously, his physical wimpiness and high pitched voice would preclude him from being cast in traditional male roles who display even the smallest amount of testosterone. Yet, once Cera begins to age and bald, what roles will be left? An old nerd in film/TV is just creepy. So, what’s left for Cera except for playing outlier freaks or pedophiles? except for perhaps being cast as “Karl” in a new Stage Version of “Slingblade”?, what new acting challenges lay on the horizon for this dorky dude? My advice for Cera is to enroll in both a weight-training class and an actors “Voice Deepening” workshop to expand his repertoire.\n\nJudy Greer\n\nAn Obligatory actress. Ever try and read her IMDB Page? don’t. You’ll have more success trying to slog through James Joyce’s Ulysses. She’s cast In virtually everything as the best friend with flexible morals. But, why is this actress in virtually every movie or TV show. Her on-screen personna doesn’t incite an immediate connection in the same way that Reese Witherspoon or Tom Hanks do. Her acting chops though decent are not undeniable enough to make a director cry out out “get me Judy Greer!” But she gets so much work she appears to hold the balls of Hollywood in an iron vice. Its gotten to the point that if a TV Show has been on for more than 3 years, they should just install an electronic countdown timer to how quickly Greer will be cast as something. I’m not really sure why Greer is in everything. Is her agent on steroids? does Hollywood have some kind of back- room Judy Greer Quota? Her appeal is truly mysterious to me. The only thing I can think of is that casting Judy Greer never threatens the other actors while on set or distracts from their star-power when on the screen. Simply put, she blends. Therefore, Hiring her presents a low-risk factor to film/tv producers who are interested in the bottom line. To a thespian, clasicallytrained in the method of Stanislavsky, there can be no higher artistic praise!\n\nSo far, this TV season seems to be the year of female empowerment. Each female character must now show that she is both the mental and physical equal of every other male character. For example, in the new show “Blindspot”, the female protagonist, “Jaimie Alexander” cant JUST be a woman stranded alone in TImes Square who suffers complete amnesia. No, she also must posess kick-ass fight skills on par with a super-hero. Sure, she forgot who her mom was or her favorite color but she conveniently remembers how whip the asses of two martial arts experts in record time. She’s quirky that way. So, don’t ever make fun of her inability to name all the Beatles because “mama don’t like when you make fun of her brainy wainy”.\n\nThis season will also introduce a new version of “Supergirl” to the viewing public. It goes without saying that she’ll be insanely strong and fast but the shows producers may also have to work at tempering her physical prowess with an equally feminine side to be more pallatable to middle America.. So, expect her to whip out a few verses from the poems of Emily Dickinson, as she’s mercilessly bashing a thiefs skull in. While she’s not in leotards and cape, watch her to don a frumpy robe and pig-out on Mallomars as she binge watches The Bachelor from her couch.\n\nSimilarly, shows like “Limitless” and “Quantico” will now introduce kick ass female fbi agens (aren’t all FBI Agents kick-ass though?) and “The Blacklist” has even promoted FBI Agent, Elizabeth Keen to fugitive FBI Agent, Elizabeth Keen so that she can-like a cornered animal- prove even more formidable when attacked.\n\nLike most trends, It won’t be long before this years female empowerment theme spills over into politics. conveniently, this year we have two women running for the top political office in the land. (incidentally 2 women is not that many as the crow flies, but two more than usual). With Clinton and Fiorina vying for top banana, enterprising Execs might come up with the brilliant idea to pitt them against eachother and their male counterparts in some sort of televised cagematch. So, in one match Fiorina might be forced to lock horns with Chris Christie (this match will no doubt be sponsored by planned parenthood). Hilary Clinton may not be able to hide-like she did her classified emails- from the agressive counterpunches of Donald Trump in their anticipated match-up.\n\nWith the rise of the strong female protagonist in the recent slew of shows comes the inevitable demise or “demasculation” of the strong, take-charge, male protagonist. The male stalwarts of many of today’s dramas have been sidelined to be house husbands (Secretary Of State), riding a desk, or in some thankless managerial position where their sole task seems to be to shout bitterly at their female kick-ass subordinates to “Just go by the book, damnit!”\n\nWhen Donald Trump made his controversial jab at fellow Republican Candidate Carly Fiorina, “Look at that face…Would anyone vote for that?!” it was considered a low, below the belt comment. It was considered below the belt because candidates should be judged on their accomplishments, not looks and also misogynistic because women’s looks are typically prized more than men’s and Trump was simply parroting that same old frat-house mentality.\n\nTrump should not have said the comment. It was “ugly”. However, that doesn’t mean that a lot of the people in the audience weren’t thinking the same exact thing. In many households across America, it was not on politicians stand on issues but it was the superficial: how poised they looked, how snappy they dressed, how unflappable they were in the face of criticism, how snappy their comebacks were. The famous Kennedy/Nixon Debate illustrates how powerful the visual image is on TV. Nixon (sweaty beady eyed) Kennedy (polished, tan, unsweaty). Truth is Fiorina does look like she’s had a lot of work done…also Trump has bad hair, Christie is fat and Fred Flintstone-ish, Bush (looks like a Mr Potato-head version of his brother) etc. When the TV Camera was on them, all their faults, including their sweatiness, facial tics, were highly magnified.\n\nPeople say that they vote on issues not looks. But, what if Harrison Ford was standing on the podium, how many women in the audience would be that critical on his stand on illegal immigration? if Jessica Alba was a hard-liner against Planned Parenthood how many men would raise up their hands-not to land dates-but to disagree?\n\nTrue appearance, most would argue, is not as important in politics since our politicians have a heavy influence over our quality of life in the same way that doctors and accountants are in charge of our money and health. So, they don’t have to be hot just good.\n\nHowever, its different with the president. we have look at the president all the time: CNN, state of union, debates, adresses etc. and ugliness is hard to take for long periods of time. For example, I know lots of people who wont watch any show with Jay Leno or Steve Buscemi regardless of their talent. Paul Giamatti has to act his pants off in every role just to get work in the next.\n\nMost would say they value experience and character over looks because they find it hard to admit that they could be superficial with such an important decision. I think in a lot of cases, its a more close contest. If Look at the last 6 or 7 political match-offs. The more attractive, dapper candidate in 9 out of 10 cases wins. You call it a coincidence, say they had other positive qualities that also went into the decision etc. But good looking people are always getting brownie points for things they don’t deserve…avoiding parking tickets, getting free food, skipping lines etc. If one day you are walking down the street and see two women are arguing on the street,who do you think is right? yep.. the better looking one. Sure…of course she’s the one that’s right.\n\nI watched the Premiere of Project Greenlight last night with much interest because I’m also an aspiring film-maker. More of a writer than director etc but in the ballpark. Anyhow , first off not crazy about the show’s premise: the fact that Affleck, and Damon sponsor a contest and help to hand pick the director of a comedy film There’s just something too…” Success anointing success about it”. I realize that most deals in Hollywood done by successful people. this way but the fact that two primo sucess stories in the room and are personally choosing the director(with the exception of the one they actually picked) are expected to kiss their Affleck and Damon’s ass and make a case for themselves is just too much fawning for me. At least with shows like “Undercover Boss” the guy in the power position at least pretends to be on equal footing to begin with so that he can get a true perspective of his workers and not their “Best sucking up behavior”\n\nTo Heighten the stakes, In the very beginning of the show, Affleck and Damon claim they are putting their integrity/career on the line with their choices. Obviously, they’re not. The prior winners of Project Greenlight were barely a blip on the movie radar Yet Ben managed to go on to Box Office, Oscar and nanny boffing success regardless. Now, if Damon and Affleck, would agree to give all their money/posessions to charity if the winner of Project Greenlight didn’t succeed, then there would be real drama and we could see the duo get more emotionally invested in the show, instead of appearing occasionally in perfunctory phone conversations about this or that insignificant detail.\n\nAfter some preliminary back and forth with Damon, Affleck, and the rest of the other judges (The Farrelly Brothers) and Brown (who argued for ethnic diversity), The show went out of its way to pick a volatile/arrogant director because they thought he had the most talent. Even though the director they chose specialized in dark films and they were shooting a broad comedy. But, Its also no secret that dicks are good for ratings: (ie Simon Cowell, or Dennis o’leary SharkTank). So, its likely they picked this guy at least partly because he was an obnoxious jerk. I mean No one is going to tune in to watch a show about a a well-run movie production team lead by nice guys high-fiving eachother\n\nIn the end result, if these contest driven reality shows (America Idol, The Voice etc) prove anything at all, its that you can’t engineer success. Even successful people occasionally produce shit -literally and figuratively- (Affleck and Damon not excluded). In addition, How can anyone really be expected to really “Create good art” in such a high stress atmosphere in which every decision they make is filmed for HBO, high profile stars like Affleck and Damon are breathing down your back, and every decision you try to make is second guessed by a committee?"
