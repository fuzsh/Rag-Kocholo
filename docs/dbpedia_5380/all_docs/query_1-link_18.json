        "text": "I hesitate to say this, because it might be regarded in some quarters as un-American - to say nothing of being pointed malice in the eyes of the lady herself - but Barbra Streisand will be 60 this coming April 24. She is still, I think, one of those unquestioned showbiz phenomena: an instantly identifiable voice and presence, a bold journeyer in realms of personality unknown to others. She it was, a little over two years ago, who commanded an enormous ticket price in Las Vegas, singing in a new millennium.\n\nGiven any immense state occasion (or some carbuncle of hype - if you can tell one from the other), it would seem fitting that Barbra be there to sing any or all of the national anthems America is collecting in this busy moment. And singing them better than anyone else could dream of doing. For just as the present crisis brings back so many old favourites, such as America the Beautiful, so it cannot help but show how far they are beyond ordinary singers, or general credulity. But Barbra could sing them, and make them seem urgent, alive and necessary.\n\nIn other words, I do not mean to make the least fun of her as a singer. This is one of the great voices from the age of broadcasting - far more seductive than Ethel Merman, far stronger than Judy Garland, and more effortlessly musical than any of today's younger singers who get the big moment at the Super Bowl, or whatever. Barbra delivers the song, and she acts it. She is, like Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland, a special kind of actor who needs the emotional wings of song for flight. Given the right song, she can tear your heart out.\n\nBut what rights does your heart have when her great Moby Dick of a fluttering organ gets pride of place? There's the problem, I think. If she didn't admire herself so much, there might be room for us to know and say how much we love Streisand. As it is, Streisand - as an actress, as her own impresario, as a figure in the culture - is something of a joke, a warning example of self-infatuation. And that's a tragedy that needs resolving.\n\nThe immediate occasion for this thought is neither her birthday nor the prospect that she might do a new spectacular in Kandahar. It is that Funny Girl, her first big movie, is about to be rereleased. The movie came out in 1968, four years after Barbra had created the role of Fanny Brice on Broadway. Fanny Brice? Well, sure. She was an ultra-Jewish singer and comic, a big star of the Ziegfeld Follies, and a Broadway figure for decades, until her death in 1951 (at the age of 60). Today, Brice's legend has nearly vanished - eclipsed in large part by that of Streisand herself.\n\nFunny Girl was a great hit, with songs by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill that included People and Don't Rain on My Parade, as well as songs Brice had made famous. The film is pretty ponderous, and it may seem horribly dated now that we are this far away from the first, remarkable emergence of Barbra herself in the 1960s - not that she had anything in common with all the obvious meanings of that decade.\n\nFrom her first steps (on Broadway, singing in clubs and on black-and-white TV), one of the great questions was: can anyone looking and behaving like this make it? To be plain, a lot of people said Barbra was homely or ugly - unless you got her at the right angle. Others said she was smotheringly Jewish and talkative - unless, maybe, she was making fun of that stereotype. There was a conflict in her: she could be strenuously self-assertive, yet you felt that she was in truth chronically shy. (Those two things can go together.) And somehow, Barbra could sing a song and leave you so moved by her emotions - People is a great example of this, as she dares you to notice the triteness of the lyrics - that you thought, well, maybe she is beautiful.\n\nShe got the Oscar for Funny Girl (actually she shared it with Katharine Hepburn in The Lion in Winter). And an acting career was launched. There were dismal moments along the way; Hello Dolly, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever, Up the Sandbox, For Pete's Sake, her versions of A Star is Born and The Main Event. Those are pretty grim experiences nowadays. But I've left out three very strange films that are terrific: The Owl and the Pussycat, where she's the hooker who takes over George Segal's prim intellectual; What's Up, Doc?, where she's the madcap who seduces Ryan O'Neal as he despairingly tries to cling to his sanity; and The Way We Were.\n\nWhat's Up, Doc? is one of the funniest films ever made in Hollywood (it was directed by Peter Bogdanovich), and at the moment when Barbra sings As Time Goes By, I defy you not to think she's the greatest singer, and entirely adorable. As for The Way We Were, I have never quite known what this is, except that it is one of a handful of films - huge hits - that are simultaneously so tacky and yet so revealing that you know they contain the secret explanation of Hollywood. In this case, it's the very effective anti-chemistry of Barbra and Robert Redford together - the clash of Wasp and Jew - that goes to the heart of so many of Hollywood's own dreams and nightmares. Only Barbra could have made it work. And, in truth, she's far better there than in Funny Girl.\n\nOf course, that's nowhere near the whole story. For The Way We Were clearly got to Barbra. It seemed to prompt her to read books, to have ideas and positions, and to yearn for respectability. With her own considerable urge to control everything as her engine, she became a director.\n\nShe works very slowly; her enemies give loud thanks for that. She did her own image immense damage with the truly appalling The Mirror Has Two Faces, which is one of the worst films from a terrible time in Hollywood - yet great fun if you watch it with a gang of sarcastic rowdies ready to start talking back to the solemn characters. The Prince of Tides, from the Pat Conroy novel, is over- emotional, but quite good, and one of those films that helped encourage Nick Nolte to be an actor.\n\nThen there is Yentl, adapted from a story by Isaac Bashevis Singer, with a series of songs (music by Michel Legrand, lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman) that are ravishing. Yentl seems forgotten now. But as someone who expects to have mixed feelings about Barbra Streisand to the end - and afterwards - I can only pass on the feeling that the film is beautiful, very touching and made with an authority that never overasserts itself.\n\nIt is enough to silence every savage Streisand joke. But then so are several passages from What's Up Doc?. And a couple of hundred moments where she starts to give voice.\n\nFunny Girl is re-released on February 15."
