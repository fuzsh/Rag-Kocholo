        "text": "Today is the 70th birthday of the legendary Barbra Streisand who we always call Babs. We were chastized in the comments for not celebrating and we get it. There's only one of her, a national treasure. In fact, just a few weeks ago I watched Funny Girl (for the 6th or 7th time) and Funny Lady (for the 2nd time) almost back to back and that double feature is astounding. The first would have to be in the top ten Pure Star Vehicles ever made (♥) and the second one is just... just no, Barbra!\n\nLike Jane Fonda, another screen icon from the 1970s who is on our way back to us, we're über pleased that she's suddenly decided she's an actress again even if we haven't seen the results yet. Barbra's big picture this year is Guilt Trip (co-starring Seth Rogen. November Release) which happens to be her first leading role since the stoney end stone age. Advanced word is positive but you never know who is doing the talking when it comes to advanced word so we're anxious. Comedy was always her forte and there's no reason that La Streep should be the only elderly giant who younger audiences completely \"get\" as a Funny Girl.\n\nSo for today's big day, let's republish an old article called \"Posterized Babs\".\n\n15 more films and brief commentary after the jump\n\npreviously published in 2010\n\nBabs is still one of the most famous people on the planet but I'm guessing that younger generations have quite the incomplete picture of her career. I'm guessing that that picture hangs in an old fashioned frame and shows the diva in a turtleneck sweater. Somehow her expression conveys stifling self regard, political activism and mega-wealth all at once.\n\nBut when I think of Babs, I laugh. Not at her but with her. Back in the day -- before most of us were attending the movies regularly (myself included) or even alive yet (myself not included) -- she was a corker of a comic actress. She could also swing dramatic as memorably as she could change keys in song. But if you peruse the posters above it seems clear that her giant movie stardom shrank just as soon as she swung dramatic in a permanent sort of way.\n\nHow many of her 18 pictures have you seen?\n\nDon't you think she should have three Oscars instead of two (hello The Way We Were)\n\nAre you looking forward to The Guilt Trip?\n\nI've seen them all, even the dreadful Little Fockers and she was the only reason I made it through that mess. She is a most skillful comedienne even in lackluster stuff like For Pete's Sake and The Main Event and a fine dramatic actress when the part suits her like it did in The Way We Were. But she did seem to succumb to Serious Actress-itis between Yentl and The Mirror has Two Faces.\n\nShe has some interesting failures in her filmography, Up the Sandbox is just so strange and very much a relic of its time and she is completely wrong in All Night Long but at least she is willing to try different things. I've always found Owl & Pussycat hard to take and I loath her version of A Star is Born but I do have several favorites among her work.\n\nClear Day is overblown and Yves Montand is a black hole in the lead but its a great showcase for her both in the present and past sequences. Even Funny Lady has its moments, the picture itself is a mess-the staging of the numbers is cluttered and overly busy and she is brittle and haughty two things Fannie Brice never was but the production and costume design are beautiful, the feathered dress she wears is amazing, and when she sings she takes the film to a classic level. It's too bad she didn't have the opportunity to do Hello, Dolly! about ten years later then she did, her youth is distracting and she tries to overcompensate with archness but again when she sings it's a marvel.\n\nHowever in my opinion she has made three all time classics: What's Up, Doc? where she more than holds her own against the comic juggernaut that was Madeline Kahn, it's also where she changes from tough but glamorous New York chanteuse and 60's musical star into a more relaxed California girl which she's never left behind. Her top two for me and I'd never be able to choose one over the other as the absolute favorite are Funny Girl-pretty much worthless as biography but Barbra is the Greatest Star in it, perhaps no vehicle was ever more perfectly devised to showcase a performer's gifts than this. Funny, sad even tragic at times but so bursting with not just talent but star charisma and promise it's impossible to tear your eyes away, and Wyler made sure she had a defining moment with My Man at the end so when the audience left the theatre they knew a star had truly been born.\n\nThe other of course is The Way We Were, even though she doesn't sing except over the credits she never looked better, gave a performance with as much depth nor was so perfectly matched with a costar than here. This may be the only film where she is matched with a performer of equal star wattage that she wasn't able to dominate. Not that she didn't ever have any other compatible costars, O'Neal, Sharif, Nolte, George Segal and Jeff Bridges all did well in their respective films but faded into the background whenever Babs showed up, Robert Redford and she went toe to toe and each held the screen with that lightening in a bottle thing called chemistry that can't be manufactured.\n\nCan't say I'm thrilled with the description of The Guilt Trip but I'll see it for her. As far as her version of Gypsy goes, as long as her voice is in good shape it will be colossal. I've heard all the \"she's 70\" talk but she's had so much work done of late that I think that will be more distracting than her age. Let's hope she doesn't have anymore, she was always so distinctive looking and now is starting to look a bit waxy. Although a new hairstyle, please a new hairdo!!, would be nice.\n\nI believe that she plans to call it quits as far as films go after Gypsy which would make sense for her legacy to finish up with something memorable and fine. It would be a shame to see her swan song be something beneath her gifts as it is for many actresses. For every Judy Garland perfectly wrapping up their screen career with feet firmly planted, arms thrust to the heavens singing full throttle at the end of \"I Could Go On Singing\" there's a sad dissipated Veronica Lake in \"Flesh Fest\" or Joan Crawford in \"Trog\"."
