        "text": "Marvin Hamlisch understood the power and global nature of music, believing it to be the one universal language that everyone on earth was able to understand. He demonstrated this understanding and intimacy with music by composing memorable songs, film scores and Broadway musicals that examined the human condition with reverence and hope. An American composer and conductor, Hamlisch was one of eleven people belonging to an exclusive club whose members had won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony and one of two in that group to also win a Pulitzer Prize, the other was Richard Rodgers.\n\nHamlisch was accepted at Juilliard at age seven. His first paying job after finishing his studies there was that of rehearsal pianist for Funny Girl, a Broadway musical that was destined to become legendary and catapult him along with the shows mesmerizing and talented star Barbra Streisand (they became lifelong friends) on the road to international fame. Hamlisch changed the face of Broadway with A Chorus Line 1975 a story of dancers hoping to get into the chorus of a new Broadway show that spotlighted their dreams, fears and imperfections. A Chorus Line ran for 15 years and won 9 Tony’s. He also wrote They’re Playing Our Song 1978, Smile 1986, The Goodbye Girl 1993 and The Sweet Smell of Success; The Musical in 2002, bringing the world such indelible tunes as One, What I Did For Love, How Can I Win, At the Ballet and I Still Believe in Love.\n\nIn between writing shows for Broadway, Hamlisch also scored over 40 films including Woody Allen’s Take the Money and Run 1969 and Bananas 1971. He scored The Way We Were 1974 writing the lovely and haunting anthem to love of the same name for old friend Streisand that since has become one of her many and best-loved signature tunes. Nobody Does it Better, sung by Carly Simon for the James Bond film The Spy Who Loved Me 1977, Looking Through the Eyes of Love, Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows (a pop song he wrote for Lesley Gore), The Entertainer from The Sting 1973 are just some of the memorable tunes from Hamlisch. Some of the other films he scored include: Save the Tiger 1973, Ordinary People 1980, Sophie’s Choice 1982, Shirley Valentine 1989, The Mirror Has Two Faces 1996, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days 2003, The Informant 2009.\n\nMarvin Hamlisch was also a much sought after symphony conductor and held positions of Principal Pops Conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra Pops and Pasadena Symphony and Pops as well as conducting the symphony orchestra’s in Pittsburgh, Milwaukee ,San Diego, Seattle, Dallas and Buffalo. In 1994 he accompanied Barbra Streisand as her musical director and arranger on her first live concert tour in 30 years in the U.S and U.K. He conducted several tours with Linda Ronstadt. He also wrote the theme music for Good Morning America, Late Night with David Letterman and Politically Incorrect.\n\nMarvin Hamlisch was 68 when he died following a short illness and with him goes a spectacular era in American music.\n\nYesterday I woke up at 6AM and as usual, tuned in to CNN to catch the news while getting ready for work. As the visuals appeared and my brain sharpened, I was stunned by what was unfolding before my eyes…talking heads referring to the Aurora movie theatre massacre, I remember thinking “which Aurora are they referring to? Illinois? Indiana? Kansas? Minnesota?” After learning it happened in Colorado where I lived for 30 years until moving back to the east coast last December, my mind was awash with high-profile crimes that made international headlines that originated in Colorado while I lived there; the death of JonBenet Ramsey, the Columbine High School Massacre and the trial of Timothy McVeigh. None of these crimes touched me as deeply as what happened at the Century 16 because of its ties with the film industry, the location and the horror the audience went through when all they were expecting was a good time.\n\nI’ve seen hundreds of films in dark, crowded auditoriums and have always been aware that anything can happen in such a setting, preferring to go to early Sunday morning screenings that are not as populated and the risk of danger (in my mind) is at a minimum. I always make mental notes as to where the exits are, how far my seat is from them and how many times the theatre is patrolled by personnel. But in this instance none of that would have mattered because of the suddenness of the assault that according to reports occurred during a shootout scene in The Dark Knight Rises, the latest offering in an unending (and boring) stream of Batman films. Anyone who has seen a summer blockbuster film will agree that the realism these films project blur the line between fantasy and reality. Many of the audience members have said they thought the actual gun fire they were hearing was coming from the movie, not realizing they were in grave danger.\n\nThere was a scene in 2009s Inglourius Basterds, directed by Quentin Tarantino, starring Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender that depicted a frightening, graphic movie theatre massacre that begins with the exits being locked, a pile of highly flammable nitrate film ignited behind the movie screen creating panic among audience members. Men emerge from the sidelines with rifles and begin shooting into the audience before the bombs strapped to their legs are detonated, destroying the theatre and killing everyone inside. Witnessing the carnage in this scene stayed with me because it reinforced the notion that ugliness that can rise out of a seemingly innocent and pristine situation.\n\nMovie theatre violence is by no means a new phenomenon.\n\n1955-Chicago. Ex-con shoots and kills rookie cop in a movie theatre.\n\n1985-Chicago. Movie line argument ends with one man dead of gunshot wound to back of head.\n\n1989-NewYork. Man shoots and kills a 20-year-old for buying the last bag of popcorn during the premiere of Batman.\n\n1990-Queens, New York. 15-year-old dead and others wounded when shootout erupts during Godfather Part 3.\n\n1991. Over 20 separate movie house violence reported during screenings of Boyz in da Hood.\n\n2006. During a screening of X-Men, The Last Stand, a gunman ordered everyone to the ground while he executed the man sitting next to him.\n\n2008. Man shot and killed during a screening of The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons for talking during the movie.\n\n2010. A man stabbed with meat thermometer while trying to quiet down some rowdy people in the row behind him.\n\nI’ve shied away from actually going out to see films these past few years because of a proliferation of rudeness among patrons that I shouldn’t have to deal with; texting, talking on cell phones and among themselves, late arrivals and crying infants to name a few, preferring to watch films in the comfort of my private space without irritating distractions committed by people who feel as though they are the only ones in the theatre.\n\nI was appalled in the aftermath news coverage that a lot of the people inside the theatre took to tweeting and texting the experience as people around them were being killed and injured to say nothing of the idiots who stood outside filming the exodus of the wounded and frightened without bothering to help those in need.\n\nThe result of this senseless act that left 12 dead and 59 wounded, will probably change the way we see movies in the future. Theatre chains may employ the use of metal detectors, wands and pat down searches before you are allowed into the auditorium. The collective consciousness of theatre goers is forever changed all due to the actions of one who for whatever reason decided to alter one of the world’s favorite pastimes. It’s just tragic.\n\nThis terrific actress was born the only child of an American mother who was a portrait artist/author and Norwegian business man father who worked for Lloyd’s of London, Celeste Holm was reared in an international setting attending schools in Holland, France and the U.S. She studied drama at the University of Chicago before becoming a stage actress in the late 1930s, performing on Broadway in a string of 9 different plays before finally hitting it big as an original cast member in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Oklahoma! in 1943 playing Ado Annie who sang “I’m Just a Girl Who Cain’t Say No”, a song as it turns out that did not reflect, in any way, her true personality.\n\nSigned to a contract by 20th Century Fox in 1946, Holm’s first film appearance was in the forgettable Three Little Girls in Blue the same year. In 1947 she played a fashion editor in Gentleman’s Agreement, a role that won her a Best Supporting Actress Oscar and a Golden Globe. Holm was now in the enviable position to pick and choose what projects she would do and said “NO” to many offers, only considering roles that had top-notch directors, casts and crews. She appeared with Olivia DeHavilland in The Snake Pit 1948, a film classic that examined psychotherapy and conditions of state-run mental hospitals, then lent her voice to narration as Addie Ross, the main character who was never seen on-screen in the wonderful A Letter to Three Wives 1949.\n\nIn 1950, Holm was one of the main characters in All About Eve, the only film in history to receive 4 Oscar nominations for the female leads; Bette Davis and Anne Baxter for Best Actress, Holm and the fabulous Thelma Ritter for Best Supporting. It set a record by being nominated for an astonishing 14 Oscars that remained unbroken until Titanic in 1997. The definitive film of bitches and vipers that inhabited the elite theatre world in New York City, All About Eve is a conglomerate of talent that holds up well despite its age. The cast included George Sanders, Gary Merrill ( future husband of Bette Davis), Hugh Marlowe, Marilyn Monroe and Barbara Bates. Celeste Holm was the last surviving cast member, the rest dying of natural causes with the exceptions of Sanders and Bates, who committed suicide and Monroe, whose death will always remain a mystery. The experience of working on All About Eve left a bad taste in Holm’s mouth. She despised Bette Davis and Marilyn Monroe and never missed an opportunity to disparage them to the press for the rest of her life.\n\nReturning to the stage and the excitement of a live audience, Holm appeared in The King and I 1951 and Anna Christie 1952 before returning to the screen in The Tender Trap 1955 and High Society 1956, both starring Frank Sinatra. She also appeared on television from the late 50s well into the 80s in everything from dramas to sitcoms, with additional stage work in Mame 1966 and The Grass Harp 1971. In 1965 she was the Fairy Godmother in Rodgers and Hammerstein’s highly rated television adaptation Cinderella with Leslie Ann Warren and had a role in the TV mini-series Backstairs at the White House 1979. Her last big film was Three Men and Baby 1987.\n\nHer honors include a Sarah Siddons Award for distinguished achievement in 1966, an Oscar, a Golden Globe, a presidential appointment (by Ronald Reagan, an old friend) to the National Arts Council, a knighting by King Olav of Norway (her father’s homeland) and was inducted into The American Theatre Hall of Fame.\n\nCeleste Holm, mother of 2 sons, was married 4 times during her life, the longest (30 years) to Wesley Addy an actor she met in Hollywood who played the sheriff in Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte 1964 that starred her old nemesis Bette Davis. When she was 87, she married a 41-year-old opera singer, which lasted until her death this morning, following a heart attack on Friday the 13th. She was 95.\n\nAn amiable man of peculiar good looks and overt masculinity, Ernest Borgnine earned his place in Hollywood history through hard work, perseverance and talent that resulted in a 60 year, award studded career consisting of well over 100 films that also included extensive television and voice over work.\n\nBorn in Hamden, Connecticut to parents of Italian origin, he lived in Milan between the ages of two and seven, then attended school in New Haven before joining the Navy in 1935. Discharged at the end of WW2 and at the urging of his mother, Borgnine studied acting at the Randall School of Dramatic Art in Hartford before moving on to Abingdon, Virginia to join the ensemble actors at the Barter Theatre from 1946-1950. There his first role was in State of the Union, then as the gentleman caller in Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie, winning over audiences with a natural charm that was hard to dismiss. In 1949, Borgnine made his Broadway debut as the nurse in the play Harvey which led to other stage appearances, firmly establishing him as a strong character actor.\n\nHe moved to Los Angeles in 1951 landing his first big film role in the classic From Here to Eternity 1953 starring Burt Lancaster, Montgomery Clift, Deborah Kerr, Frank Sinatra and Donna Reed playing Sargeant “Fatso” Judson, in charge of the stockade who bullies and taunts Frank Sinatra. His performance was so good that he was cast in villainous roles in his next 3 big budget films, Johnny Guitar with Joan Crawford and Mercedes McCambridge, Vera Cruz with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, both in 1954 and Bad Day at Black Rock 1955 with Spencer Tracy and Lee Marvin. In the second half of 1955, Borgnine did an abrupt about-face that would change the direction of his career permanently by accepting the role of a lonely, love struck butcher in Marty, directed by Delbert Mann with Betsy Blair as his co-star. Borgnine’s earthy, touching performance earned him a Best Actor Oscar, a BAFTA, the New York Film Critics Award, best actor honors at the Cannes Film Festival and the National Board of Review Award. Following this triumph, he appeared in a variety of roles in a successful film career that ran from the latter half of the 50s well into the 80s in such classics as The Best Things in Life Are Free 1956, The Flight of the Phoenix 1964, The Dirty Dozen 1967, Ice Station Zebra 1968, The Wild Bunch 1969, The Poseidon Adventure 1972 and Escape from New York 1981.\n\nBorgnine’s television career was every bit as prolific. In 1951 he appeared in a few episodes of Captain Video and His Video Ranger’s which led to scores of other appearances in Goodyear Television Playhouse, Ford Television Theatre and Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre before finally signing on to his own sitcom in 1962 that would become a classic, where he joined the ranks of other classic television leading men; John Forsythe, Andy Griffith, Alan Young, Robert Young, Fred MacMurray and Buddy Ebsen.\n\nMcHale’s Navy was a male oriented sitcom where Borgnine played Lieutenant Commander Quinton McHale of PT-73 with a crew of lovable insubordinate’s; Tim Conway, Joe Flynn, Gary Vinson and Carl Ballentine. The show became an overnight success during the first season and stayed high in the ratings until 1965 when due to repetitive story lines, its audience lost interest and the show was cancelled in 1966. His TV career only gained momentum and he made guest appearances on Love Boat, Little House on the Prairie, Magnum P.I., Highway to Heaven, Murder She Wrote, Texas Ranger, Touched by an Angel and E.R. He also lent his unmistakable voice to work on the Simpson’s and Sponge Bob Square Pants, playing Mermaid Man with his old friend Tim Conway taking the role of Barnacle Boy.\n\nIn 1996, Borgnine toured the U.S. in a bus to see the country and to meet his many fans. The trip was made into a documentary, Ernest Borgnine on the Bus. He also, that year, served as chairman of the National Salute of Hospitalized Veteran’s and also started a campaign to urge veteran’s to come forth and tell their stories. He was a Freemason in Hollywood Lodge #355 and a member of the Loyal Order of Moose.He authored an autobiography “Ernie” in 2008 and underwent a promotional tour to keep in touch with his fans from which he was never inaccessible. From 1972 through 2002, he marched in Milwaukee’s annual Great Circus Parade as the Grand Clown. In 2007 he became the oldest person (at 90) to be nominated for a Golden Globe for his performance in the television movie A Grandpa for Christmas. In 2009 at 92 years of age he was nominated for an Emmy for his work on the TV series E.R.\n\nBorgnine was married 5 times during his lifetime; Rhoda Kemins 1949-1958 where he fathered a daughter Nancee, Katy Jurado 1959-1963, Ethel Merman 1964 a union that lasted 38 days of which he said “you get 2 bombs in room and something is going to explode”, Donna Rancourt 1965-1972 that produced 3 more children, a son Christopher and daughters Sharon and Diana. From 1973 he was married to Tova Traesnces that lasted until his death yesterday of renal failure. He was 95.\n\nBorn on June 1st, 1926 the same day and year as Marilyn Monroe, Andy Griffith’s career as an actor took a very different turn that I feel was due to his strong sense of self and genuine interest in enhancing the lives of the people around him with warmth, goodwill and a smile that was like a beacon in the dark. Like Monroe, Griffith became an entertainment icon but one that resonated with a different energy devoid of glamour and inaccessibility, making him a person you wouldn’t think twice about spending time with over a plate of saltines and a jar of honey roasted peanut butter.\n\nRaised in Mt. Airy, North Carolina he graduated from high school where his interest in drama and the arts was sparked. He carried that interest into the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill where he studied music and theatre becoming president of the UNC Men’s Glee Club and a member of Alpha Rho Chapter of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, America’s oldest fraternity for men in music. During his college years he appeared in student productions of Gilbert and Sullivan operettas: The Gondoliers, The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore. He also played a decent guitar and sang. After college, Griffith taught English at Goldsboro High School where he taught, among others, future NPR personality Carl Kasell.\n\nGriffith began his 60+ year career as a monologist, telling long, hilarious stories of a country boy’s impressions of the urbane world around him becoming an instant hit with audiences. His most famous being “What it Was, Was Football” which he recorded as a single that reached #9 on the charts in 1954. The following year he appeared on the Broadway stage as the lead in No Time for Sargent’s that ran for over 700 performances and was nominated for a Tony as “Distinguished Supporting or Featured Dramatic Actor” losing to Ed Begley but won the Theatre World Award for the role. He reprised that role for the film in 1958 where he met fellow cast member Don Knotts that marked the beginning of a life long friendship between the 2 men. Another pivotal stage role for Griffith was in the musical Destry Rides Again in 1957 with a score by Harold Rome where he was again nominated for a Tony but lost to Jackie Gleason.\n\nAndy Griffith’s first starring film role was in A Face in the Crowd 1957 where he played an amoral, drunken drifter plucked out of jail and obscurity into the national spotlight with the help of publicist Patricia Neal, eventually becoming a talk show host of great power and influence. His over-inflated ego results in an epic down fall leaving him destitute. Directed by Elia Kazan with an extraordinary cast that included Walter Matthau, Lee Remick and Tony Franciosa, A Face in the Crowd examined the complexities of gaining and maintaining celebrity despite the high emotional cost of everyone involved. It garnered mixed reviews after it opened but clearly was a film way ahead of its time.\n\nTelevision proved to be fertile ground for Griffith. His appearance on an episode of Make Room for Daddy, where he played a small town sheriff who issued a speeding ticket to the shows star Danny Thomas, became the back door pilot for The Andy Griffith Show and the rest is classic television history.\n\nThe Andy Griffith Show took place in the fictional town of Mayberry, North Carolina that was populated with eccentric and zany individuals where Griffith acted as Sheriff Andy Taylor. The show brimmed over with small town sensibilities and homespun wisdom. The cast included Griffith’s longtime friend Don Knotts in the hilarious role of Deputy Barney Fife for which he won multiple Emmy’s, Francis Bavier as Aunt Bee, Ronny Howard, who would grow up to become a fabulous director, as his son Opie, Jim Neighbors as Gomer, who would eventually star in a spin-off series, Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C., and George Lindsey as Goober. Griffith’s role as Sheriff Taylor required him to act as counselor, problem solver, advisor, mediator and disciplinarian in a way that was never judgmental or condescending and always respectful.\n\nThe show was an immediate hit becoming a staple of prime-time television that made its legions of fans yearn for small town life. FUN FACT: The opening sequence of the show was actually filmed in a park in Beverly Hills and not in rural North Carolina. The Andy Griffith Show ran from 1960 to 1968 with Knotts leaving the series in 1965 and with his departure the show lost a lot of its comic punch. Griffith exited the show in 1967 to pursue other projects and the series continued as Mayberry RFD starring Ken Berry. Griffith made final appearances as Taylor in a 1986 reunion TV movie Return to Mayberry and 2 other reunion specials in 1993 and 2003 all of which had strong ratings.\n\nAfter his role as Andy Taylor, Griffith was no stranger to TV appearing in many made for television movies and countless sitcoms that include; Gomer Pyle U.S.M.C, The Mod Squad, Hawaii Five-O, The Doris Day Show, Here’s Lucy, The Bionic Woman and Fantasy Island. His next starring role in a television series happened in 1986 where he played a brilliant lawyer with small town values who never lost a case in Matlock that ran until 1995. Matlock slaughtered other contemporary TV dramas with powerhouse ratings but once again Griffith was ignored by the Emmy nominating committee but won a People’s Choice Award for his role in 1987.\n\nGriffith continued making films throughout his career notably Angel in My Pocket 1969 with Lee Meriwether, Rustlers Rhapsody 1985 with Marilu Henner and Sela Ward, and Waitress 2007 with Keri Russell and Nathan Fillion. He also continued recording religious music that was close to his heart, never straying far from his Baptist roots, and won a Grammy for one of those albums “I Love to Tell the Story, 25 Timeless Hymns.”\n\nGriffith was a lifelong Democrat and endorsed candidates Mike Easley and Bev Perdue in their successful runs for state Senator from North Carolina speaking at the inaugurations of both. He declined an offer by Democratic officials to run against Jesse Helms in the U.S. Senator race in 1989.\n\nGriffith was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 and was inducted into The Country Gospel Music Hall of Fame along with Barbara Mandrell and Loretta Lynn in 1999.\n\nHe was married 3 times, to Barbara Bray Edwards from 1949-1972 that ended in divorce, then to Greek actress Solica Cassuto from 1975-1981 also divorced and to Cindi Knight from 1983 until his death. During his marriage to Bray Edwards he adopted a son who preceded him death and fathered a daughter Dixie Nan.\n\nAndy Griffith passed away at home on Roanoke Island located on North Carolina’s Outer Banks from an undisclosed illness and due to family wishes was buried within 5 hours of his death.\n\nThe eldest of four daughters born to screenwriters Phoebe and Henry Ephron in New York City, this down to earth, insightful soul had a fertile mind and razor-sharp wit. These traits combined with a talent for writing and very strong observational skills made Nora Ephron the Dorothy Parker of my generation.\n\nMoving to California at an early age, Ephron graduated from Beverly Hills High School then back to the east coast to attend Wellesley College in Massachusetts. During her college years Ephron’s parents wrote a play which turned into the film Take Her, She’s Mine 1963 with Jimmy Stewart and Sandra Dee basing Dee’s character on Nora. After college she worked as a White House intern during the JFK administration ( claiming she was the only intern he didn’t hit on) then moved to New York to work in the mailroom of Newsweek.\n\nA strike by the International Typographical Union in the mid 60s, NYC newspapers were forced to suspend publication so Ephron and a few of her friends started putting out their own satirical publication where her parodies of New York Post columnists caught the eye of Post publisher Dorothy Schiff who hired Ephron as a reporter when the strike ended.\n\nShe began writing for Esquire, New York Magazine and the New York Times Magazine and in doing so became one of the best known humorists in America. New York was good to her and Ephron’s love affair with the city is illuminated in this lovely quote…” I thought it was going to be the most exciting, magical, fraught-with-possiblity place you could ever live in; a place where if you really wanted something, you might be able to get it; a place where I’d be surrounded by people I was dying to be with. And it turned out I was right.”\n\nEphron began screenwriting when enlisted by her 2nd husband Carl Bernstein to help re-write the script for All the President’s Men and although their treatment was not used in the final film, Nora was offered her first screenwriting job for a television movie.\n\nIn Hollywood, Ephron set her own standards in a male dominated industry that she found hostile to films by or about women. She was nominated for an Academy Award on her first screenplay, Silkwood 1983 that starred Meryl Streep and Cher. She followed that with the screenplay for Heartburn 1986, an autobiographical piece based on the circumstances surrounding her divorce from Carl Bernstein about whom she quipped ” was capable of having sex with a venetian blind.” She wrote and produced the amazing and heartfelt When Harry Met Sally 1989 with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan that brought her international acclaim, winning a BAFTA and a Golden Globe as well as an Oscar nod for best original writing.\n\nEphron began flexing her directorial muscles in the 90s with mixed results. Beginning with This is my Life 1992, a film about a mother trying to break into the world of stand up comedy did little to resonate with audiences despite a top-notch comic cast that included the enormously gifted Julie Kavner, Carrie Fisher and Dan Aykroyd. Sleepless in Seattle 1993, that paired Tom Hanks with Meg Ryan was a critical and commercial success firmly establishing Ephron as Hollywood’s foremost creator of romantic comedies. Mixed Nuts 1994, with Steve Martin and the late and glorious Madeline Kahn, focused on the people who worked at a suicide prevention hotline on Christmas Eve, opened to neither critical acclaim or commercial success. Michael 1996 starred John Travolta as an earthy and earthbound angel was a huge success and the first film where Ephron acted as writer, director and producer. She finished up the decade with You’ve Got Mail 1998 re-uniting the team of Hanks and Ryan in a re-make of 1940s Shop Around the Corner with Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullivan.\n\nThe only film of note from Ephron in the 21st century was Julie & Julia 2009 starring close friend Meryl Streep, who was fantastic as Julia Child. The film enjoyed critical and commercial success, winning awards from critics in most metropolitan areas.\n\nEphron leaves behind a handful of insightful films that celebrated ordinary, responsible women as well as a treasure trove of published works; Wallflower at the Orgy 1970, Crazy Salad: Some Things About Women 1975, The Boston Photographs 75, Scribble, Scribble: Notes on the Media 1978, I Feel Bad About My Neck: And Other Thoughts on Being a Woman 2006 and I Remember Nothing: And Other Reflections 2010.\n\nSome memorable Ephron quotes;\n\n“I’ve heard male film directors say making a movie is very much like fighting a war, but to me if there is a caterer, it’s hardly a war.”\n\n“You can’t retrieve your life (unless you’re on Wikipedia, in which case you can retrieve an inaccurate version of it.)”\n\n“When your children are teenagers it’s important to have a dog so that someone in the house is happy to see you.”\n\n“Beware of men who cry. It’s true that men who cry are sensitive to and in touch with feelings, but the only feelings they tend to be in touch with are their own.”\n\nReading makes me feel I’ve accomplished something, learned something, become a better person…reading is bliss.”\n\nNora Ephron was married 3 times in her life; writer Dan Greenburg, journalist Carl Bernstein, both ended in divorce and to screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi, a union that lasted until her death last week. She died from pneumonia, a complication resulting from acute myeloid leukemia that was diagnosed in 2006.\n\nLadonna Adrian Gaines, born in Boston of working class parents, had an epiphany at 10 years of age while singing as a soloist in her church choir where “the voice of God” told her she was destined to become famous . As Ladonna grew up she morphed into a woman of great beauty and talent, changed her name to Donna Summer and worked for a few years in Germany and Austria performing in musical theatre.\n\nReturning to the U.S. she made a living as a background singer for 3 Dog Night before releasing the first of her many signature songs, Love to Love You Baby in 1975, a hedonistic anthem that defined gay culture and ushered in a new era of music and dancing known as Disco. Summer paved the road for other musical acts intent on glorifying the gay experience such as The Village People and K.C. and the Sunshine Band. Anyone who experienced the culture at that time, including this writer, can attest to the fact that dancing to this music in crowded gay clubs was an unforgettable experience. During this time it was rumored that she was a transvestite.\n\nDonna Summer over the next few years enjoyed massive commercial success with songs like Bad Girls, MacArthur Park, Heaven Knows, Hot Stuff, Dim All the Lights, On the Radio and She Works Hard for the Money. She even got together with Barbra Streisand to duet Enough is Enough. My personal favorite was a duet she did with Liza Minnelli Does He love Me, Like He Loves You?\n\nDuring a concert in 1983 Donna Summer, a born again Christian announced to the audience “I’ve seen the evils of homosexuality. AIDS is the result of your sins”. She went further by saying “God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve” denouncing the very group who gave her a career in the first place. Her inflammatory remarks stunned the gay community who were already in crisis mode over the mystery illness that was decimating their community. Many gay establishments banned Summer’s music and her career came to a screeching halt.\n\nIt took her 8 years to address those remarks during an interview with ACT UP where she denied the incident ever happened saying “Eight years ago, I made reference to AIDS. What I supposedly said I did not say and any reference to AIDS was an innocent reference.” Huh? She went on to blame a disgruntled reporter who worked for The Village Voice for fabricating the story. Many claimed the story true, she said it was false so it will remain a mystery to what actually occurred but anyone who has even a passing knowledge of born agains knows they preach hate and hide behind the Bible while doing it. It’s said that time heals all wounds and the gay community eventually (it took decades) started listening to Summer’s music again though her later musical offerings lacked the excitement and vitality they once had.\n\nAt the end of her life Summer could look back on her career with some degree of satisfaction. She was the recipient of 5 Grammy’s , had 3 consecutive double albums reach #1 and had four #1 singles in a 13 month span. In addition she also received an NAACP Image Award, had 3 Platinum albums, 11 Gold albums, 12 Gold singles and 6 American Music Awards.\n\nIn recent years Summer privately battled cancer and in the end cancer won. Wherever her passing took her I hope she say’s hello to Adam and Steve. She was 63. 441 in dog years.\n\nThis television host, promoter and entrepeneur has been credited with breaking down racial barriers that existed in the mid-20th century by mixing his studio audience with black and white kids on his iconic television show American Bandstand and while this claim may have some merit, it is not entirely true. Though the show looked integrated from the outside, behind the scenes was a different story according to historian Matthew F. Delmont who states in an editorial piece in the Washington Post that “archival material, newspaper accounts, video and photographic evidence prove otherwise”. Bandstand required visitors to write in advance to request tickets and applications were then screened by name and address. Black teens wanting to be on the show undermined this process by using Irish, Polish and Italian last names who would then be sent tickets guaranteeing their admission. In October 1957 a group of black teens in south Philadelphia organized a protest outside the studio because of their exclusion from American Bandstand which was reported in the Philadelphia Tribune, the city’s leading black newspaper.\n\nBandstand was popular as a music and dance show based in Philadelphia and became wildly successful when Clark abandoned the record playing format by introducing live performances for the kids to dance to. Clark said in a 1987 interview ” over two-thirds of the people inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame had their television debuts on American Bandstand”. An appearance on Bandstand guaranteed performers an increase in sales and popularity and line-up they did; Ike and Tina Turner, Marvin Gaye, The Shirelles, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Bobby Rydell, Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello to list just a few of the thousands of musical acts who were booked on the show. The only group he wasn’t able to snag for Bandstand was the Beatles.\n\nAmerican Bandstand became fully integrated when Clark moved the show from Philadelphia to Los Angeles in 1964 but even then black performers as well as white rock and rollers were heavily sanitized to project a clean, safe image. From the late 20th to the early 21st century, Clark became progressively bolder and less accurate on how he integrated the studio audience. During a 2011 interview when asked about the racial policies of American Bandstand, Clark said “as soon as I became host, we integrated” and if you do a little research you’ll find this statement to be false. Never-the-less American Bandstand became an iconic television show that lasted on air for over 30 years long after the baby boomers matured only to be discovered by following generations and the show became instrumental in shaping popular culture for the last half of the 20th century.\n\nClark was active in all aspects of television both in front of and behind the camera. In 1963 he branched out into hosting game shows. A few lasted only one season such as The Object Is and Missing Links but he hit pay dirt in the early 70s with The $10,000 Pyramid, a word association game, which ran for years and won 9 Emmy’s. In 1972 he began an annual New Year’s Eve ritual by hosting Dick Clark’s Rockin’ Eve broadcast live from the excitement in Times Square where millions, some say billions ushered in the new year from the comfort of their own homes across the globe. Clark continued hosting until being disabled by a stroke in 2004. The show is now hosted by Ryan Seacrest.\n\nClark also teamed with old friend Ed McMahon to host the long running television show; TV’s Bloopers and Practical Jokes. In fact McMahon credited Clark with intoducing him to his future television partner Johnny Carson when they all worked at ABC in Philadelphia in the 1950s. In 1985 Clark hosted a portion of the historic Live Aid Concert designed by Bob Geldof to end world hunger. He also from 1988 through 1993 hosted a number of pagents including Miss America and Miss Universe. Clark produced the cult TV show American Dreams about a Philadelphia family in the early 60s whose daughter was a regular on American Bandstand.\n\nA successful businessman, Clark served as chairman and chief executive officer of Dick Clark Productions. He also founded a chain of restaurants The American Bandstand Diner modeled after the Hard Rock Cafe with locations in Newark, Phoenix and Salt Lake City, one on the New Jersey Turnpike and another in Branson, Missouri. It was his association with these eateries that came under fire in the 2002 documentary Bowling for Columbine directed by Michael Moore that explored the business ethics of Clark hiring poor, unwed mothers and working them long hours for very little pay. The situation covered in the film concerned a mother who worked 80 hour weeks and was still unable to pay rent which resulted in eviction and her sending her 1st grade son to live with his uncle. The son found a gun at his uncle’s house and took it to school where he shot another first grader. When Moore approached Clark on the allegations, Clark refused to answer any questions and climbed into his car and drove off. He also appeared in another 2002 film where he appeared in interview segments in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, based on the un-authorized biography of Chuck Barris, who hosted The Gong Show, an old friend of Clark.\n\nDick Clark worked tirelessly throughout his career and is recognized as one of the pioneers of television and in doing so became a bona-fide legend. He knew and worked with practically everyone in the business and made a fortune doing it. His net worth at the time of his death was estimated to be in the hundreds of millions and he demonstrated his eccentricities by building a custom home in the hills above Malibu to look like it was straight out of The Flintstones. It listed at the beginning of this month for a cool 3.5 million.\n\nHe also was the recipient of many awards and recognitions. Besides the Emmy’s he gathered he was also awarded a Peabody in 1991, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, the Broadcasting Magazine Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Television Arts and Sciences Hall of Fame. He also recieved a special Daytime Emmy Award for lifetime achievement.\n\nAfter a long and active life Clark rebounded from a debilitating stroke in 2004 and following surgery to fix an enlarged prostrate he suffered a massive heart attack and died on April 18th. He was creamated 2 days later and his ashes scattered in the Pacific ocean.\n\nClark was married 3 times and fathered 3 children.\n\nd. Steven Spielberg\n\nc. Jeremy Irvine, Emily Watson, Peter Mullan\n\nA tumultuous 2nd half of 2011 which resulted in a cross-country move from Denver to the Washington D.C. area caused me to put the blog on hold but I’m back to resume my passion for film and am starting 2012 with my thoughts on the much-anticipated film from Steven Spielberg, War Horse.\n\nTo begin with, War Horse was originally a children’s story turned into a stage play that caused a sensation in Britain and the U.S. using fantastic horse puppets to tell a story which chronicles the experience of a horse from birth to his relationship with his young boy owner, their forced separation and the horse’s sale to the British military to be used in battle during the First World War, making the film essentially a war picture. I hate war pictures but I love horses and was interested to see how Spielberg would handle the material, given his fertile and seemingly limitless imagination.\n\nThe up-side is War Horse contains all the hallmarks of a Spielberg film, high production values including a lovely John Williams score, picturesque locations with scenes between the horse and his boy owner guaranteed to tug at heart strings and wonderful camera work reminiscent of Gone With the Wind.\n\nThe down-side in my opinion is War Horse is shamelessly manipulative with an ending so sugary sweet I could actually feel cavities forming in my teeth. The trauma of what the horse experienced during the brutal battle scenes were very dramatic but didn’t ring true which made the whole experience impersonal, hollow and contrived. The human characters in the film seemed to have no personal connections so instead of watching a family and a whole host of human entities, I found myself watching actors that were merely playing roles.\n\nSo as it turns out, War Horse will appeal to those who have a taste for generic entertainment developed for the masses but those with a discriminating eye should look elsewhere to have their thirst for a true and classic cinematic experience slaked."
