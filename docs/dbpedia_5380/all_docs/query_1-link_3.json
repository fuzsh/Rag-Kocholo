        "text": "Barbra Streisand is an American singer, actress, director and producer and one of the most successful personalities in show business. She is the only person ever to receive all of the following: Oscar, Tony, Emmy, Grammy, Golden Globe, Cable Ace, National Endowment for the Arts, and Peabody awards, as well as the Kennedy Center Honor, American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement honor and the Film Society of Lincoln Center Chaplin Award.\n\nShe was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1942 to Diana Kind (née Ida Rosen), a singer turned school secretary, and Emanuel Streisand, a high school teacher. Her father died when she was 15 months old. She has a brother, Sheldon, and a half-sister, Roslyn Kind, from their mother's remarriage. As a child she attended the Beis Yakov Jewish School in Brooklyn. She was raised in a middle-class family and grew up dreaming of becoming an actress (or even an actress / conductor, as she happily described her teenage years at one of her concerts).\n\nAfter a period as a nightclub singer and off-Broadway performer in New York City she began to attract interest and a fan base, thanks to her original and powerful vocal talent. She debuted on Broadway in the 1962 musical comedy \"I Can Get It For You Wholesale\" by Harold Rome, receiving a Tony Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and a New York Drama Critics Poll award. The following year she reached great commercial success with her first Columbia Records solo releases, \"The Barbra Streisand Album\" (multiple Grammy winner, including \"Best Album of the Year\") and \"The Second Barbra Streisand Album\" (her first RIAA Gold Album); these albums, mostly devoted to composer Harold Arlen, brought her critical praise and, most of all, public acclaim all over the US. In 1964 she had another smash Broadway hit when she portrayed legendary Broadway star Fanny Brice in \"Funny Girl\" by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill; the show's main song, \"People\", became her first hit single and she appeared on the cover of Time magazine. After many TV appearances as a guest on various music and variety shows (such as an episode of The Judy Garland Show (1963), for which she was nominated for an Emmy), she signed an exclusive contract with CBS for a series of annual TV specials. My Name Is Barbra (1965) (which won an Emmy) and Color Me Barbra (1966) were extremely successful.\n\nAfter a brief London stage period and the birth of her son Jason Gould (with then-husband Elliott Gould), in summer 1967 she gave a memorable free concert in New York City, \"A Happening in Central Park\", that was filmed and later broadcast (in an edited version) as a TV special; then she flew to Hollywood for her first movie, Funny Girl (1968), a filming of her stage success. The picture, directed by William Wyler, opened in 1968 and became a hit in the US and abroad, making her an international \"superstar\" and multiple award winner, including the Best Actress Oscar. After a series of screen musicals, such as Gene Kelly's Hello, Dolly! (1969) and Vincente Minnelli's Einst kommt der Tag (1970), she wanted to try comedies, resulting in such films as Die Eule und das Kätzchen (1970) and Is' was, Doc? (1972). She turned to dramas and turned out Sandkastenspiele (1972) and the classic Jene Jahre in Hollywood (1973), directed by Sydney Pollack and co-starring Robert Redford. The song \"The Way We Were\" (written by Marvin Hamlisch and Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman) became one of her biggest hits and most memorable and famous songs.\n\nShe returned to TV for a new special conceived as a musical journey covering many world musical styles, Barbra Streisand and Other Musical Instruments (1973), then returned (for contractual reasons) to her Fanny Brice role in a sequel to her hit \"Funny Girl\" film, Funny Lady (1975), and the next year turned out one of her most personal film projects, A Star Is Born (1976), one of the biggest hits of the year for which she won a Golden Globe for Best Actress and her second Oscar, for the song \"Evergreen\". Always extremely busy on the discography side, averaging one album a year throughout the '70s and '80s, she had a string of successful singles and albums, such as \"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\" (duet with Neil Diamond), \"Enough is Enough\" (with Donna Summer), \"The Main Event\" (from her film Was, du willst nicht? (1979) with her friend Ryan O'Neal) and the album \"Guilty\", written for her by The Bee Gees' Barry Gibb, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nShe debuted as a director with the musical drama Yentl (1983), in which she also portrayed a Jewish girl who is forced to pass herself off as a man to pursue her dreams. The movie received generally positive reviews and the beautiful score by Michel Legrand and lyricists Marilyn Bergman and Alan Bergman stands up as one of Streisand's finest musical works. The film received several Oscar nominations, winning in two categories, but she was not nominated as Best Director, which disappointed both her and her fans, many of whom consider this the Academy's biggest \"snub\".\n\nIn 1985 her album \"The Broadway Album\" was an unexpected runaway success, winning a Grammy Award and helping to introduce a new generation to the world of American musical theater. In 1986 she performed in a memorable concert, after 19 years of stage silence, \"One Voice\". She returned to the screen in Nuts ... Durchgedreht (1987), a drama directed by Martin Ritt, in the role of a prostitute accused of murder who fights to avoid being labeled \"insane\" at her trial. In 1991 she appeared in Der Herr der Gezeiten (1991), which many consider to be the pinnacle of her screen career, playing a psychiatrist who tries to help a man (Nick Nolte) to find the pieces of his past life. The film received seven Oscar nominations (but again NOT for Best Directing), but she did receive a nomination from the DGA (Directors Guild of America) for Best Director. In 1994 she returned to the stage after 27 years for a series of sold-out concerts (for the televised version of one of these, she won another Emmy).\n\nIn the 1990s she broke several personal records: with two #1 albums (\"Back to Broadway\" in 1993 and \"Higher Ground\" in 1997) and became the only artist to achieve a #1 album on the Billboard charts in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s (she extended this record into the 21st century in 2009 with the jazz album \"Love is the Answer\"). In 1996 she starred in her third picture as director, Liebe hat zwei Gesichter (1996), with Jeff Bridges and Lauren Bacall. The film had a \"the girl got the guy\" ending, and the same happened to her in real life--the next year she married well known TV actor James Brolin.\n\nIn 2000 she focused her career again on concerts (\"Timeless\") and in 2006-07 with a European tour. She made only two more films--a supporting role as a sex therapist mother in the Ben Stiller comedy Meine Frau, ihre Schwiegereltern und ich (2004) and its sequel, Meine Frau, unsere Kinder und ich (2010), alongside Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro. She published a book, \"Passion for Design\", in 2010 and celebrated her friendship with the Bergmans with an entire album of their songs, \"What Matters Most\" (2011), that debuted in the top 10.\n\nAfter a long break from filming, she returned in a starring role for the 2012 holiday season with Unterwegs mit Mum (2012), a mother/son picture co-starring Seth Rogen and directed by Anne Fletcher, and is working on putting together a film version of the well-known Jule Styne musical \"Gypsy\". In almost 50 years of career, Streisand has contributed to the show business industry in a personal and unique way, collecting a multi-generational fan base; she has a powerful and recognize vocal range, and a raucous and often self-deprecating sense of humor, which doesn't prevent her from showing the serious and dramatic sides of her personality. Her strong political belief in social justice infuses her professional career and personal life, and she makes no bones about what she believes; her willingness to put her money where her mouth is has resulted in some truly vicious attacks by many who hold opposite political views, but that hasn't stopped her from acting on her beliefs. She has been honored with the Humanitarian Award from the Human Rights Campaign, an Honorary Doctorate in Arts and Humanities from Brandeis University in 1995, an Honorary Doctorate of Philosophy from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 2013 and the bestowing by the government of France the title of Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters. She supports many humanitarian causes through the Streisand Foundation and has been a dedicated environmentalist for many years; she endowed a chair in environmental studies in 1987 and donated her 24-acre estate to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. In addition, she was the lead founder for the Clinton Climate Change Initiative. This effort brought together a consortium of major cities around the world to drive down greenhouse gas emissions. She is a leading spokesperson and fund-raiser for social and political causes close to her heart and has often dedicated proceeds from her live concert performances to benefit programs she supports.\n\nLauren Bacall was born Betty Joan Perske on September 16, 1924, in New York City. She was the daughter of Natalie Weinstein-Bacal, a Romanian Jewish immigrant, and William Perske, who was born in New Jersey, to Polish Jewish parents. Her family was middle-class, with her father working as a salesman and her mother as a secretary. They divorced when she was five and she rarely saw her father after that.\n\nAs a school girl, she originally wanted to be a dancer, but later switched gears to head into acting. She studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, after attending She was educated at Highland Manor, a private boarding school in Tarrytown, New York (through the generosity of wealthy uncles), and then at Julia Richman High School, which enabled her to get her feet wet in some off-Broadway productions.\n\nOut of school, she entered modeling and, because of her beauty, appeared on the cover of Harper's Bazaar, one of the most popular magazines in the US. The wife of famed director Howard Hawks spotted the picture in the publication and arranged with her husband to have Lauren take a screen test. As a result, which was entirely positive, she was given the part of Marie Browning in Haben und Nichthaben (1944), a thriller opposite Humphrey Bogart, when she was just 19 years old. This not only set the tone for a fabulous career but also one of Hollywood's greatest love stories (she married Bogart in 1945). It was also the first of several Bogie-Bacall films.\n\nAfter 1945's Jagd im Nebel (1945), Lauren received second billing in Tote schlafen fest (1946) with Bogart. The mystery, in the role of Vivian Sternwood Rutledge, was a resounding success. Although she was making one film a year, each production would be eagerly awaited by the public. In 1947, again with her husband, Lauren starred in the thriller Die schwarze Natter (1947). The film kept movie patrons on the edge of their seats. The following year, she starred with Bogart, Edward G. Robinson, and Lionel Barrymore in Gangster in Key Largo (1948). The crime drama was even more of a nail biter than her previous film.\n\nIn 1950, Lauren starred in Zwischen zwei Frauen (1950), a drama set in 1894. It was a film of note because she appeared without her husband - her co-star was Gary Cooper. In 1953, Lauren appeared in her first comedy as Schatze Page in Wie angelt man sich einen Millionär (1953). The film, with co-stars Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable, was a smash hit all across the theaters of America.\n\nAfter filming Warum hab' ich ja gesagt? (1957), which was released in 1957, Humphrey Bogart died on January 14 from throat cancer. Devastated at being a widow, Lauren returned to the silver screen with Das Geschenk der Liebe (1958) in 1958 opposite Robert Stack. The production turned out to be a big disappointment. Undaunted, Lauren moved back to New York City and appeared in several Broadway plays to huge critical acclaim. She was enjoying acting before live audiences and the audiences in turn enjoyed her fine performances.\n\nLauren was away from the big screen for five years, but she returned in 1964 to appear in Der Mörder mit der Gartenschere (1964) and ...und ledige Mädchen (1964). The latter film was a comedy starring Henry Fonda and Tony Curtis. In 1966, Lauren starred in Ein Fall für Harper (1966) with Paul Newman and Julie Harris, which was one of former's signature films.\n\nAlternating her time between films and the stage, Lauren returned in 1974's Mord im Orient-Express (1974). The film, based on Agatha Christie's best-selling book was a huge hit. It also garnered Ingrid Bergman her third Oscar. Actually, the huge star-studded cast helped to ensure its success. Two years later, in 1976, Lauren co-starred with John Wayne in Der Scharfschütze (1976). The film was Wayne's last - he died from cancer in 1979. In late 1979, Lauren appeared with her good friend, James Garner, in a double episode, Lions, Tigers, Monkeys and Dogs (1979), of his Rockford Files series.\n\nFor Lauren's next film role, she appeared in a large ensemble film, Der Gesundheits-Kongreß (1980), which again paired her with James Garner, and in 1981, she played an actress being stalked by a crazed admirer in Der Fanatiker (1981). The thriller was absolutely fascinating with Lauren in the lead role, again playing opposite her good friend James Garner, making three straight screen roles with Lauren opposite James Garner. After that production, Lauren was away from films again, this time for seven years. In the interim, she again appeared on the stages of Broadway. When she returned, it was for the filming of 1988's Rendezvous mit einer Leiche (1988) and Mr. North - Liebling der Götter (1988). After 1990's Misery (1990) and several made for television films, Lauren appeared in 1996's Ein Präsident für alle Fälle (1996), a comedy romp with Jack Lemmon and James Garner as two ex-presidents and their escapades. In 1997, Lauren appeared in Liebe hat zwei Gesichter (1996), in one of the best roles of her later career, opposite Barbra Streisand, where Lauren was nominated as Best Actress in a Supporting Role by both the Academy and the Golden Globes, winning the Golden Globe for the role.\n\nDespite her age and failing health, she made a small-scale comeback in the English-language dub of Hayao Miyazaki's Das wandelnde Schloss (2004) (\"Howl's Moving Castle,\" based on the young-adult novel by Diana Wynne Jones) as the Witch of the Waste, and several other roles through 2008, but thereafter acting endeavors for the beloved actress became increasingly rare. Lauren Bacall died on 12 August 2014, five weeks short of her 90th birthday.\n\nGeorge Segal was born on February 13, 1934 in New York City, New York, to Fannie Blanche (Bodkin) and George Segal Sr., a malt and hop agent. All of his grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. After a stint in the military, he made his bones as a stage actor before being cast in his first meaty film role in Chefarzt Dr. Pearson (1961). His turns in Das Narrenschiff (1965) and the eponymous Sie nannten ihn King (1965) heralded the arrival of a major talent. He followed this up with his Oscar-nominated performance in Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966), in which he more than held his own against Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966) was a cultural phenomenon, the film that wrecked the MPDDA censorship code that had been in place since 1934, and a huge box office success to boot.\n\nBy the early 1970s, appearances in such films as Die Eule und das Kätzchen (1970), Heirat ausgeschlossen (1973), Born to Win (1971) and Vier schräge Vögel (1972) had made him a major star with an enviable reputation, just under the heights of the superstar status enjoyed by the likes of Paul Newman. He followed up Mann, bist du Klasse! (1973) (a hit film for which his co-star Glenda Jackson won an Oscar) with his brilliant performance as the out-of-control gambler in Robert Altman's California Split (1974).\n\nAt one time in the early 1970s, it seemed like George Segal would have a career like that enjoyed by his contemporary Jack Nicholson, that of an actor's actor equally adept at comedy and drama. Segal never made the leap to superstar status, and surprisingly, has never won a major acting award, the latter phenomenon being particularly surprising when viewed from the period 1973-74, when he reached the height of his career. It was at this point that Segal's career went awry, when he priced himself as a superstar with a seven-figure salary, but failed to come through at the box office. For example, Die Jagd nach dem Malteser Falken (1975) was a failure, although his subsequent starring turn opposite Jane Fonda in Das Geld liegt auf der Straße (1977) was a big hit that revitalized her career.\n\nThe thriller Achterbahn (1977) became a modest hit even during a summer which saw it competing with Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977), and he gave a adroit comic performance in Die Schlemmerorgie (1978) with Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Morley, which proved another box office success. For all practical purposes, even after the failures of Die Jagd nach dem Malteser Falken (1975), and Wer schluckt schon gerne blaue Bohnen? (1976), it seemed like Segal, with a few deft career choices, could reorient his career and deliver on the promise of his early period.\n\nAt the end of the decade, he dropped out of a movie that would have burnished his tarnished lustre as a star: Blake Edwards' 10 - Die Traumfrau (1979). 10 - Die Traumfrau (1979) made Dudley Moore a star, while Arthur - Kein Kind von Traurigkeit (1981) made him a superstar in the 1980s, a lost decade for Segal. It was an example of a career burnout usually associated with the \"Oscar curse\" (his Bizarre Morde (1968) co-star Rod Steiger, for example, was a great character actor whose career was run off the rails by the expectations raised by the Academy Award). George Segal has never won an Oscar, but more surprisingly, has only been nominated once, for Best Supporting Actor of 1966 for his role as Nick in Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966).\n\nThat he didn't return to the promise of the early 1970s may be the unintended consequence of his focusing on comedy to the detriment of drama. The comedy Mann, bist du Klasse! (1973) made him a million dollar-per-film movie star, and that's what he concentrated on. Segal began relying on his considerable charm to pull off movies that had little going for them other than their star, and it backfired on him. These films weren't infused with the outrageously funny, subversive comedy of Wo is' Papa? (1970), a success from his first period that he enjoyed along with co-star Ruth Gordon and director Carl Reiner.\n\nWhen Segal first made it in the mid-1960s, he established his serious actor bona fides with a deal he cut with ABC-TV that featured him in TV adaptations of Broadway plays. He also played a very memorable Biff Loman in Death of a Salesman (1966), shining in performance in counterpoint to the vital presence that was Lee J. Cobb's Willy Loman. It was a good life for an actor, and he took time to show off his banjo-playing skills by fronting the Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band, with which he cut several records.\n\nWhile the 1980s were mostly a career wasteland for Segal, with no starring roles in hit films, he remained a popular figure on television, and appeared regularly on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), where he would routinely sing and play the banjo during interviews. After a major role in the surprise hit Kuck' mal wer da spricht! (1989), he co-starred with Bette Midler and James Caan in For the Boys - Tage des Ruhms, Tage der Liebe (1991), leading to a career revival in the 1990s, using his flair for comedy as part of the ensemble cast of Just Shoot Me - Redaktion durchgeknipst (1997). In the 2010s, he co-starred as the eccentric but lovable grandfather on the hit sitcom Die Goldbergs (2013).

Mike Medavoy has two sons, Brian Medavoy and Nicholas Medavoy, and resides in Beverly Hills, California.\n\nJeffrey Leon Bridges was born on December 4, 1949 in Los Angeles, California, the son of well-known film and TV star Lloyd Bridges and his long-time wife Dorothy Dean Bridges (née Simpson). He grew up amid the happening Hollywood scene with big brother Beau Bridges. Both boys popped up, without billing, alongside their mother in the film Auf Bewährung freigelassen (1951), and appeared on occasion with their famous dad on his popular underwater TV series Abenteuer unter Wasser (1958) while growing up. At age 14, Jeff toured with his father in a stage production of \"Anniversary Waltz\". The \"troublesome teen\" years proved just that for Jeff and his parents were compelled at one point to intervene when problems with drugs and marijuana got out of hand.\n\nHe recovered and began shaping his nascent young adult career appearing on TV as a younger version of his father in the acclaimed TV- movie Silent Night, Lonely Night (1969), and in the strange Burgess Meredith film The Yin and the Yang of Mr. Go (1970). Following fine notices for his portrayal of a white student caught up in the racially-themed Halls of Anger (1970), his career-maker arrived just a year later when he earned a coming-of-age role in the critically-acclaimed ensemble film Die letzte Vorstellung (1971). The Peter Bogdanovich- directed film made stars out off its young leads (Bridges, Timothy Bottoms, Cybill Shepherd) and Oscar winners out of its older cast (Ben Johnson, Cloris Leachman). The part of Duane Jackson, for which Jeff received his first Oscar-nomination (for \"best supporting actor\"), set the tone for the types of roles Jeff would acquaint himself with his fans -- rambling, reckless, rascally and usually unpredictable).\n\nOwning a casual carefree handsomeness and armed with a perpetual grin and sly charm, he started immediately on an intriguing 70s sojourn into offbeat filming. Chief among them were his boxer on his way up opposite a declining Stacy Keach in Fat City (1972); his Civil War-era conman in the western In schlechter Gesellschaft (1972); his redneck stock car racer in Der letzte Held Amerikas (1973); his young student anarchist opposite a stellar veteran cast in Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh (1973); his bank-robbing (also Oscar-nominated) sidekick to Clint Eastwood in Die Letzten beißen die Hunde (1974); his aimless cattle rustler in Rancho Deluxe (1975); his low-level western writer who wants to be a real-life cowboy in Ins Herz des wilden Westens (1975); and the brother of an assassinated President who pursues leads to the crime in Philadelphia Clan (1979). All are simply marvelous characters that should have propelled him to the very top rungs of stardom...but strangely didn't.\n\nPerhaps it was his trademark ease and naturalistic approach that made him somewhat under appreciated at that time when Hollywood was run by a Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino-like intensity. Neverthless, Jeff continued to be a scene-stealing favorite into the next decade, notably as the video game programmer in the 1982 science-fiction cult classic Tron (1982), and the struggling musician brother vying with brother Beau Bridges over the attentions of sexy singer Michelle Pfeiffer in Die fabelhaften Baker Boys (1989). Jeff became a third-time Oscar nominee with his highly intriguing (and strangely sexy) portrayal of a blank-faced alien in Starman (1984), and earned even higher regard as the ever-optimistic inventor Preston Tucker in Tucker - Ein Mann und sein Traum (1988).\n\nSince then Jeff has continued to pour on the Bridges magic on film. Few enjoy such an enduring popularity while maintaining equal respect with the critics. König der Fischer (1991), American Heart - Die zweite Chance (1992), Fearless - Jenseits der Angst (1993), The Big Lebowski (1998) (now a cult phenomenon) and Rufmord - Jenseits der Moral (2000) (which gave him a fourth Oscar nomination) are prime examples. More recently he seized the moment as a bald-pated villain as Robert Downey Jr.'s nemesis in Iron Man (2008) and then, at age 60, he capped his rewarding career by winning the elusive Oscar, plus the Golden Globe and Screen Actor Guild awards (among many others), for his down-and-out country singer Bad Blake in Crazy Heart (2009). Bridges next starred in Tron: Legacy (2010), reprising one of his more famous roles, and received another Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his role in the Western remake True Grit - Vergeltung (2010). In 2014, he co-produced and starred in an adaptation of the Lois Lowry science fiction drama Hüter der Erinnerung - The Giver (2014).\n\nJeff has been married since 1977 to non-professional Susan Geston (they met on the set of Rancho Deluxe (1975)). The couple have three daughters, Isabelle (born 1981), Jessica (born 1983), and Hayley (born 1985). He hobbies as a photographer on and off his film sets, and has been known to play around as a cartoonist and pop musician. His ancestry is English, and smaller amounts of Scots-Irish (Northern Irish), Irish, Swiss-German, and German."
