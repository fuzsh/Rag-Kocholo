        "text": "Description\n\nThis superb filmcell features the twice Oscar nominated movie, The Mirror Has Two Faces (1996). Directed by and starring Barbra Streisand and also stars Jeff Bridges, Lauren Bacall and George Segal.\n\nIn The Mirror Has Two Faces, a boring math professor Gregory Larkin (Bridges) comes completely unhinged by any thought of sex. He sets out to build a relationship with a homely literature professor called Rose Morgan (Streisand) which is based on a more intellectual level. They marry, but she misses the sex. While he is away on a lecture tour, she diets, exercises, and has a makeover. This still does not solve all of their problems."
