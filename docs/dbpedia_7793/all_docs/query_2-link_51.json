        "text": "Leaving Aberlour, the view to the north widens to include the Macallan and Craigellachie distilleries and Thomas Telford's bridge over the River Spey. To the south is the distinctive mass of Ben Rinnes. Rising to 2,755 feet (826 metres), it dominates the landscape. It also provides the source for most of the water used in the local distilleries.\n\nAfter crossing west to east across moor and through forest the walk reaches the Dufftown. The town was founded in 1817 by James Duff, 4th Earl Fife. An old rhyme says that 'Rome was built on seven hills, Dufftown stands on seven stills'. You pass two of its distilleries on this walk and the redundant site of a third. The first is Glenfiddich, one of the most famous names in the malt whisky world. The distillery has been owned by the same company, William Grant and Sons, since it was founded in 1886. The distillery welcomes visitors.\n\nAt the rear of Glenfiddich Distillery is Balvenie Castle, which dates from the 13th century with 16th century additions. It has many historical associations. Mary Queen of Scots stayed here during her campaign against the Gordon family, and a later visitor was the Marquis of Montrose, popularly known as the Great Montrose, who in 1644 supported the King of Scotland in a brilliant Highland campaign during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. The castle was occupied by Jacobite rebels in 1689, refortified in 1715 and taken over by the government forces in 1746.\n\nBalvenie is also the name of the next distillery. Balvenie Distillery is owned by the same company as Glenfiddich, but was built a little later, in 1892, using stones from New Balvenie Castle, which William Grant bought for Â£200. The third distillery on Fiddichside was Convalmore Distillery. It was particularly associated with James Buchanan, later Baron Wollavington, whose company produced the famous Black and White whisky, which originated from Convalmore. The distillery is now closed as an original entity and now absorbed into the Glenfiddich Distillery business.\n\nThe next stage of the walk is beside the River Fiddich. Otters can be found in the river but are usually elusive. The birdlife is likely to include finches and small birds of prey in the woods, as well as waterbirds such as the dipper and heron. At Craigellachie the main route of the Speyside Way is joined. The path, opened in 1981, follows the river for much of its 50 mile route.\n\nThe River Spey is one of Scotland's most famous rivers, renowned both for its scenery and its fishing. Salmon run upriver from Spey Bay, providing the finest sport for anglers. The river's character changes greatly in the lower reaches, as it winds through wooded hills and fertile land on its way to the coast, but it is a lovely river for all of its 97 miles. When in spate it is a most impressive sight. Across the river from Craigellachie, the white building on the bluff is part of Macallan Distillery. The bridge at Craigellachie, built by Thomas Telford, was forged in Wales before transportation and assembly on site. It cost Â£8,000. The new one beside it dates from 1975."
