        "text": "The burgh of Dufftown is considered to be the heartland of whisky-making in Scotland. The location and proximity to the rail links made for the perfect location for Peter MacKenzie and partners to build the eponymously named distillery in 1896. The following year, Dufftown Distillery, built on the site of an old mill, was transferred to P. MacKenzie & Co. – owners of the Blair Athol Distillery in Pitlochry. In 1933, it too was sold to Arthur Bell & Sons and both distilleries’ spirit was used for blending. Over the years, the number of stills has increased from two to eight, becoming one of the top fifteen distilleries by capacity. To this day, Dufftown’s distillate is still primarily used in blended malts.\n\nThe character of a Dufftown single malt whisky is considered nutty and spicy."
