        "text": "The Singleton of Dufftown Malt Master’s Selection (40%, OB, 2018)\n\nCategory: Speyside single malt scotch whisky\n\nOrigin: Dufftown distillery\n\nBottling: Diageo\n\nABV: 40%\n\nCost: £30\n\nWhat they say\n\nThe Singleton Malt Master’s Selection offers a more delicate, slightly sweeter take on the classic Speyside style used in The Singleton of Dufftown 12 year old, with a greater proportion of refill wood allowing the sweet, yet refined distillery character to shine through. A perfect introduction for those who are new to Single Malts, as well as a treat for those well-versed in the category.\n\nTo celebrate the launch of The Singleton Malt Master’s Selection, the whole core range has been refreshed including the 12, 15 and 18 year old. The distinctive packaging, which takes its inspiration from a 19th century hip flask blown from blue glass, includes the batch number, Master Blenders signature and tasting notes to help consumers navigate the single malts category, while the traditional cues provide reassurance and confidence of choice.\n\nFounded in the 19th century and delivering over 120 years of distilling experience, The Dufftown Distillery is located in the heart of the Speyside region of Scotch whisky production. Singleton’s Malt Master Craig Wilson personally selects casks from the whisky library to achieve a perfect balance between delicate flavours and exceptional smoothness, with notes of fresh fruit, honey and vanilla that captures the essence of Speyside in a bottle. Matured in a mixture of three distinct cask types; Refill, Sherry and Bourbon, the result is a delightful balance between delicate flavours and exceptional smoothness.\n\nWhat I say\n\nAnother new edition to the Singleton of Dufftown’s portfolio, after the recent Sunray, Tailfire and Spey Cascade no-age statement flavour-led expressions.\n\nI have to admit confusing this first with The Singleton of Glendullan Master’s Art edition released to travel retail and finished in Muscat wine casks, I had at the back of my mind a Cognac cask finished edition too. However on re-reading the press release it appears this is a an alternative marrying of the standard casks used in the age statement Singleton of Dufftown editions without I presume the bias of flavour as in the previous editions noted above (which it is apparently replacing) apart from the noted use of more refill casks – so getting away from wood influence and back to distillery character.\n\nAimed as an introduction to The Singleton of Dufftown’s stable range (12, 15, 18yo) and slightly sweeter.\n\nMy tasting notes:\n\nAppearance: Amontillado full gold (10/20), numerous medium-fine tears run quick and leave same sized legs.\n\nNose: A balance of cereal malted barley and peach fruit, followed by some stewed or poached apples and pairs, quite sweet with honey and golden syrup, a little citrus zest, orange and lime, barley sugars, fresh cinnamon pastries, vanilla, icing sugar.\n\nTaste: Medium-bodied and luxuriously oily on the palate, first a cereal meal is delivered with barley malt sweetened with honey, thickens, some of the fruit, more subtle than on the nose, and well-integrated, apple, pear, melon, zesty fresh lemon and lime, a hint of white pepper, ride over toffee and caramel and a touch of white chocolate.\n\nFinish: Sweet and sour, cereal, vanilla, oak wood, some peppery spice lingers.\n\nOverall\n\nA very mealy and really rather good expression from Dufftown, I have to admit to being partial to the 12yo which is an easy drinker for me. Perhaps it is more spirit character here, but I found myself liking this expression better with a view to re-acquainting myself with the 12yo again for comparison. I’m not usually a big fan of spice but this has just the right addition to liven up a thick, sweet and rich expression.\n\nScore 84/100\n\nShop for (opens Master of Malt)\n\nDon’t take my word for it:\n\nBloggers submit link to your review"
