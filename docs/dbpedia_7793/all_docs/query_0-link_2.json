        "text": "A vibrant and thriving Highland community that invites visitors to participate in a wide range of traditional Scottish activities and entertainment throughout the year.\n\nSet in the heart of Speyside in north eastern Scotland, Dufftown is situated on the banks of the River Fiddich and the Dullan Water at the foot of the Conval Hills.\n\nLike other villages of its period, Dufftown has spacious streets laid out in a regular plan. The four main streets converge at the Clock Tower, which was completed in 1839. The Clock Tower was originally the town jail, became the Tourist Information Centre and is now vacant. The Visitor Information Point is now located in the Whisky Museum.\n\nWhisky making is the life blood of Dufftown. From the farmers who grow the finest malting barley to the distillers and the coopers, without Whisky, Dufftown could no longer proclaim itself the \"Malt Whisky Capital of the World\".\n\nWhether you already know the north-east of Scotland or are just thinking of visiting, you are sure to find Dufftown and the surrounding area a beautiful part of the Highlands and a unique opportunity to escape from the pressures of 21st century living. For more information about Dufftown why not browse our Dufftown online brochure.\n\nWhatever the reason you come here, enjoy your visit and, as we say in Scotland: \"Haste ye back!\"\n\nWhat's New\n\nSpeyside Whisky Distilleries Guide\n\nGraham Grieve from Glasgow has produced an interesting and informative guide to the distilleries of Speyside.

The No 36 bus travels through Speyside and links with the No 10 service to Forres and Keith.\n\nThe full bus timetable is available by clicking here.\n\nScotch Hopping in Scotland\n\nThe Americans have discovered our secret! here is an excellent piece from the Washington Times on 6 Jan 17, well worth a read if you want to have a US view of Speyside!\n\nA Night on the Dufftown\n\n5 minutes to spare? then why not read this short e-zine article by Paul Stafford who visited Speyside in 2014.
