        "text": "The Dufftown Highland Games are held in the scenic Highland village of Dufftown, AB55 4AP on the last Saturday in July.\n\nThe Games are held on the Mortlach School Field on Hill Street. The Massed Pipe Bands start at the Clock Tower in the Town Square at 1pm and end the day with Beat The Retreat at 6pm on Conval Street.\n\nThe Highland Games have two designated parking lots, one below Balvenie Castle and one in the field by entrance to Glenfiddich Distillery. Both car parks are approximately 10 minute walk to the Games Field. â€‹There is also designated disabled parking at the Fire Station on Hill Street.\n\nPlease note that there are several streets in town that are closed to parking as they are parade routes or designated bus parking areas, do not park in areas with traffic cones in place as you will be towed away. The Glenfiddich Distillery public parking is for distillery visitors only.\n\nThe flying of drones at Dufftown Highland Games is strictly prohibited, unless prior written authority has been sought and formally granted by the Management Committee of the Games. It should be noted that the use of such equipment is governed by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) under their Air Navigation Order, specifically Articles 166 and 167."
