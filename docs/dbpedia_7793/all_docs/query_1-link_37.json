        "meta_description": "Dufftown distillery is a renowned whisky distillery located in the town of Dufftown, which is nestled in the heart of the Scottish Speyside region. The distillery was founded by the Dufftown-Glenlivet Company in 1895, and was initially creatively named the “Dufftown-Glenlivet Distillery”. In 1897, just one year after production had launched, Mackenzie & Company acquired the distillery and retained responsibility for the site for the next forty years. The distillery is known for its distinctive flavor profile, which is characterized by a rich, fruity taste with notes of sherry and spice. This flavor is achieved through the careful selection of the finest ingredients, including locally grown barley, pure Scottish water, and specially selected yeast strains. During the early twentieth century, Arthur Bell and Sons, purchased the distillery, marking the beginning of the use of Dufftown Single Malt in their Blend. Responding to an increase in demand, Bell’s doubled the amount of stills used at the site from two to four in 1974 and added two additional stills in 1979. These expansions in terms of production have made Dufftown one of the best-functioning distilleries in Scotland in terms of production.  In 1985, United Distillers (UDV), now owned by Diageo, Scotland’s largest Single Malt Whisky provider, acquired the Dufftown distillery. Today, Dufftown’s reputation as a Single Malt brand has taken a backseat to its contributing role with Bell’s. With the appearance of the Singleton of Dufftown brand the distillery starts to gain new reputation. The distillery is closed to the public, but it is possible to take a tour of the facility if you contact the distillery in advance.",
