        "text": "Dufftown is a Speyside region distillery founded in 1895 and built in a former mill. Dufftown is one of the six distilleries operating in the town of the same name. Now owned by Diageo, Dufftown is one of the largest for output in their portfolio, with a yearly capacity of six million litres. The distillery is used for producing whisky for blending in notably, Johnnie Walker and Bells whisky. Part of the production is also reserved for the The Singleton of Dufftown single malt. The Singleton brand is made up of easy drinking whiskies from Glen Ord, Glendulllan and Dufftown. The style of The Singleton of Dufftown can be described as straight forward, nutty and spicy. The core range is made up of the Singleton of Dufftown 12,15 and 18 year olds plus the Malt Master’s Selection. Recently a 54 year old Singleton of Dufftown was released. There are also a few Independent bottlings from the likes of Cadenheads and Gordon & MacPhail.\n\nAbout Us\n\nWhisky International is a specialist online whisky shop based in Scotland’s capital city Edinburgh.\n\nWe have an extensive selection of fine and rare single malts from Scotland’s most respected distilleries.\n\nBuy whisky online from around the world including Japanese Whisky, Bourbon Whiskey, Irish Whiskey, Scottish Blends, Swedish Whisky and Indian Whisky."
