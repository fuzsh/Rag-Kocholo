        "text": "Gift Messages\n\nPlease let us know if you would like a specific message included with your order. You can add your gift message at checkout and we will pick it up from there.\n\nShipping Costs\n\nDelivery is FREE on all orders over £165.00 to most UK Postcodes. Orders under £165.00 incur a £12.50 delivery charge. Our preferred courier is DPD and they charge us extra to deliver to certain postcodes in the Scottish Highlands & Islands.\n\nIf you live in one of these restricted postcode delivery areas the delivery charge is £20 for orders under £165.00. Orders £165 to £249 are subject to a £10 delivery charge. Orders over £250 are delivered FREE. If you are happy to proceed with an order including the stated delivery charges we will raise a separate invoice for the additional cost and email it to you. Find out more on our Delivery Page\n\nDelivery Times\n\nWe aim to to have your delivery with you within 5-7 working days of receiving your order, but often it can be much sooner. If you need your order by a certain date please get in touch and we'll do our best to get it to you as required.\n\nVintage Availability\n\nWe endeavour to display accurate and current vintages on all our wines listed on the website; however, from time to time stocks of the vintage listed do become exhausted. If this is the case with your order we will always contact you to recommend another vintage of the same wine, if it is still available. If the vintage of a wine is important to you then please leave a note at checkout advising us of this.\n\nStock Availability\n\nAs we are retail stockists, selling from our Ledston shop as well as online, it makes it difficult for us to show a 'real-time' inventory of our wines and spirits online. As such, very occasionally, a wine may be out of stock that the website has allowed you to order.\n\nTo ensure a timely delivery, we are happy to substitute your order with a similar wine of equal or higher value and at no additional cost to you!\n\nIf this is not an acceptable solution please advise us in the 'Add A Comment' section at the checkout."
