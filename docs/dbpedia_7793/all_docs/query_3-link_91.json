        "text": "More than half of Scotland’s malt whisky distilleries can be found in the lower northeast corner of the Scottish Highlands. Located between Inverness and Aberdeen, just north of the Helensburgh to Stonehaven line that historically has demarcated the Highlands from the Lowlands, the Speyside region is centered on the lush, fertile valley of the River Spey. This is unquestionably the heart of single malt whisky production in Scotland.\n\nSpeyside whiskies exhibit the classic flavors of honey, vanilla, and ripe green fruits, like apples and pears. These whiskies are both sophisticated and elegant. They are beautifully balanced between sweet, honey, light caramel notes and floral aromas, but on occasion can have a pronounced smoky character.\n\nThose that are aged in sweet, fortified, wine casks, especially sherry casks, with age, inhale and absorb the deep-rooted flavor remaining in those casks, and mature to deliver a range of dried fruit, nutty and savory spice flavors.\n\nThe Speyside distilleries are often sorted by specifying the river they are near (Spey, Bogie, Deveron, Findhorn, etc.) or by the whisky producing district where they are located: Bogie, Livet, Deveron, Dufftown, Fiddich, Findhorn Valley, Inverness, Isla, Lossie, Rothes and Strathisla.\n\nThis organization is purely geographic rather than stylistic. Although there is a characteristic sweet, fruity, floral, Speyside “style,” the house styles of the different distilleries in the same area can be dramatically different.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for adjoining distilleries to offer radically different whiskies. Balvenie and Glenfiddich, for example, are adjoining distilleries both owned by William Grant & Sons and use the same water source, yet they produce whiskies with very different aroma and flavor profiles.\n\nThe abundance and quality of its water is the principal reason why whisky distilleries have flocked to the Speyside region. It takes roughly 50 liters of water to produce 1 liter of whisky. Roughly 75% of that water is used in the condensers and once cooled can be returned to the water source from which it was drawn.\n\nThe region’s water also has the lowest level of dissolved minerals than any other region in Scotland, making it ideal for mashing.\n\nSpeyside’s lack of accessibility, at least until the mid-nineteenth century railroad boom, was another distinct advantage and had the added benefit of keeping the “gaugers,” the whisky excise tax collectors, a comfortable distance away.\n\nThe Speyside region was the trigger for the first Scotch whisky boom. In August 1822, King George IV made a highly publicized trip to Edinburgh. While there he discovered the illicit whisky being produced in the district of Glen Livet in Speyside.\n\nIt is not known whose whisky the King tasted. The distillery that today bears the name “The Glenlivet” wouldn’t be founded for another 2 years. At the time, there were around 40 small distillers in the area, none of which were licensed.\n\nThe King instructed his Royal Chamberlin, Lord Conyngham, to secure a supply. Unfortunately, like most Highland whiskies, it was unavailable outside the Highlands.\n\nThe King’s passion for Scotch whisky from the Highlands, and from the Speyside district of Glen Livet in particular, created a national awareness of the superior quality of Highland whiskies. Following the royal example, Highland whisky became a fashionable drink among the aristocracy and throughout England.\n\nThe association of Scotch whisky with the British monarchy would continue throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1835, William IV granted the first royal warrant to a whisky producer—Royal Brackla. He declared it his favorite whisky.\n\nQueen Victoria was also a strong proponent of Scotch whisky. She granted royal warrants to both Royal Lochnagar and Royal Brackla, both Highland whiskies (hence the designation “royal” in their names), and gave a standing order that all royal coaches should carry a bottle of whisky under the coachman’s seat in case of an “emergency.”\n\nEvery British monarch since then has issued royal warrants to one or more whisky distilleries. The sole exception was Edward VIII, who abdicated after less than a year on the throne.\n\nSpeyside whiskies are the best-selling and, with the possible exception of Islay whiskies, most well-known of all Scotch whiskies. From Speyside come such iconic brands as The Macallan, Glenfiddich and The Glenlivet.\n\nThese three brands typify the characteristic Speyside “style” or “template,” even though they each have very different aroma and flavor profiles. The three are also the most popular Scotch whisky brands in the United States.\n\nThere are literally dozens of less known Speyside whisky brands however, some of which represent outstanding Scotch whiskies at exceptional values.\n\nThe best way to understand Speyside and its 50 odd distilleries is to organize them into four broad aroma and taste groupings:\n\nLight and Floral\n\nThese whiskies are crisp and fragrant. They are great as aperitifs with a clean, fresh aftertaste. They will often feature ripe, crisp, green fruit flavors of apples and pears with floral aromas and a hint of sweetness. Good examples of this style include Knockando, Glenlivet and Glen Spey.\n\nGlenfiddich 12 YO has some sherry cask matured malt in its blend, but would also fit in this category.\n\nThe proliferation of finishes, however, has meant that a distillery’s range will often cross over into other categories. The Glenlivet Nadurra Oloroso Cask or Nadurra First Fill Oak Cask expressions would not belong in this category.\n\nFruity and Spicy\n\nThese whiskies are medium bodied. The fruit flavors are softer, more overripe, bordering on baked or cooked. The wood spice is more pronounced with distinctive vanilla and baking spice aromas. The sweetness is heavier, more honey-like, and sets off the spice elements nicely.\n\nIf the first category is reminiscent of a bowl of ripe fruit, then this category is more like a baked fruit pie. Good examples include Cardhu, Cragganmore, Glen Elgin and Glendullan.\n\nRich and Rounded\n\nThese whiskies have deep, rich, sweet flavors. Fruit flavors emphasize dried fruits and nuts, typically with pronounced sherry or sweet wine notes. They have a substantial mouth feel and weight on the palate with a viscous, oily texture.\n\nThe sherry influence here is unmistakable, although the impact of the sherry cask can vary dramatically between those expressions that are matured exclusively in sherry casks (The Macallan, Aberlour A’bunadh), those that mature only a portion of the bottling in sherry casks or only finish in sherry casks (Aberlour, Balvenie, Glenfiddich), and those that use a combination of sherry butts.\n\nThe two most common sherry casks used for maturation or finishing are Oloroso, a drier sherry with pronounced dried fruit and nutty notes, and Pedro Ximenez (PX) a thick, sweet viscous sherry that imparts distinctive notes of raisins, figs and dates.\n\nSome whisky producers will use a combination of sherry casks such as a Fino, a very dry light sherry, or Oloroso cask followed by a sweet Pedro Ximenez cask to add a broader range of flavors and more layered complexity (Glendronach). In some cases, the proportion of sherried malt, especially first-fill casks, is increased in older expressions to produce a more pronounced sherry influence (Glenfiddich, Aberlour).\n\nOther notable distillers with this style include some of the specialty bottlings of Linkwood, see especially the sherry cask matured Signatory and Gordon & MacPhail expressions, and BenRiach’s or Benromach’s Pedro Ximenez expressions.\n\nFull Bodied and Smoky\n\nThis style of Scotch whisky is more typical of the western islands and the Highlands than it is of Speyside. Although peat is found in Speyside, and was used there historically, its use in the local whisky industry largely died out long ago.\n\nNonetheless, there are several distillers that produce peated expressions in Speyside. Not surprisingly, these whiskies feature varying degrees of smoke and peat but fall short of the intense peaty expressions typical of Islay.\n\nSpeyside peat tends to be drier, earthy, and more floral, like a faded potpourri, rather than the marine, phenolic iodine of Islay and the western Highlands. See for example BenRiach’s Curiositas, Benromach’s Peat Smoke, Tomuntoul’s Old Balatruan, or the Ardmore Legacy or Traditional Cask expressions.\n\nFor the Scotch whisky enthusiast, Speyside has much to offer. There is a lot of history there and a lot of whisky. The region is the heart and soul of Scotland’s whisky kingdom. Both its whisky and its history are worthy of further exploration.\n\nHere are 7 outstanding Speyside whiskies, at varying price points, that represent outstanding values. Give them a try.\n\nGlenfiddich, 12 YO, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $30\n\nAn indispensable Speyside malt that should be in every whisky collection. Versatile in cocktails or straight up, it is the ideal single malt for both beginners and seasoned enthusiasts. An excellent aperitif with honey, fruit and floral aromas and flavors complemented by subtle, well-integrated oak notes. The world’s bestselling single malt.\n\nArdmore Traditional Cask, NAS, 46% ABV, 750ml, $40\n\nArdmore has traditionally been reserved for blending purposes. It is as the core of the Teacher’s blend. Only recently has it begun to appear as a single malt. A traditional Speyside malt imbued with distinctive aromas of peat smoke and iodine while still showcasing the sweetness and creamy character of Speyside.\n\nGlendronach, 12 YO, 43% ABV, 750 ml, $45\n\nA quintessential, heavily sherried Speyside malt. A perennial award winner with what Jim Murray called a “stupendous nose” and at an outstanding price.\n\nThe Glenlivet, 18 YO, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $80\n\nA classic Speyside malt that is one of the two top selling single malts in the world. Notes of sweet honey and walnut complement floral and crisp apple and pear flavors.\n\nThe Balvenie Port Wood, 21 YO, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $200\n\nAn outstanding, aged, Speyside malt that offers the added complexity of being finished in a “port pipe” cask. The traditional floral and fruity aromas of Speyside are complemented by dried fruit and nutty notes. On the palate, it is creamy with a pronounced palate weight and a long, sweet lingering finish.\n\nBenromach 35, 35 YO, 43% ABV, 750 ml, $550\n\nAn exceptional whisky from a little-known distillery, which offers incredible value for the money. Matured in first-fill sherry casks, it offers the usual aroma and taste profile of sherry matured whiskies along with distinctive notes of cinnamon, furniture wax and just a hint of cloves.\n\nAberfeldy 12, 12 YO, 40% ABV, 750 ml, $40\n\nFinally, if you can only buy one, then opt for the Aberfeldy 12. Ironically, Aberfeldy isn’t technically in Speyside. Located in the center of Scotland, near Loch Tay, it is on the western side of the Cairngorms National Park. It is a good two hour drive southwest of Speyside.\n\nTraditionally, this malt has been the heart of Dewar’s blended whisky. It offers classic Speyside fruitiness with notes of sweet honey and a bit of wood spice. A terrific all-around malt at an outstanding price.\n\nSláinte"
