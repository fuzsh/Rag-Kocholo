        "text": "Speyside\n\nAll Speyside whiskies are Highland whiskies; but, not all Highland malts are Speysiders. What is the difference, why the distinction of the Speyside region? The answer is quite simply the River Spey. From its source in the Cairngorms National Park, the river meanders 107 miles, disgorging into the Moray Firth at Spey Bay. Speyside, located in the middle of the Highland region, is also considered by many the heartland of Scotch production. Today, more than half of Scotlandâ€™s working distilleries are located in this region.\n\nGeographically, Speyside encompasses the area east and west of the River Spey, partly in tandem with the Morayshire county lines. There are several key towns in region. Forres, to the east, is home to Benromach Distillery and a short drive from Dallas Dhu, a mothballed distillery now transformed into a visitor destination. Westerly are the distilleries of Strathisla, Strathmill, Glen Keith, and Aultmore, all located in Keith. Centrally situated are our shop, offices, and warehouses in the Royal Burgh of Elgin, also known for its mediaeval cathedral ruins.\n\nAlong the River Spey, as world-renowned for its salmon fishing as its whisky distilleries, lie the whisky towns of Rothes, Craigellachie, and Dufftown: combined these house the Speyside Cooperage and thirteen distilleries, including Glen Grant and Mortlach."
