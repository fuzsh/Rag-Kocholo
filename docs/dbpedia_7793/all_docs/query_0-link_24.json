        "text": "Dufftown is probably the whisky capital of Scotland, and therefore the world. Although not (quite) on the River Spey, the village is an essential waypoint on Speysideâ€™s Malt Whisky Trail, and home to half a dozen distilleries producing Speyside whisky; world-famous Glenfiddich Distillery and little-known Balvenie Distillery are on the north side of town and both offer tours â€“ though we canâ€™t afford the latter! The village itself is presided over by an attractive clock tower (and one time jail) but otherwise isnâ€™t particularly exciting. Donâ€™t worry â€“ the surrounding hinterland ensures that enjoying a visit doesnâ€™t have to depend on downing drams; thereâ€™s also an imposing 13th century castle and a heritage railway taking passengers 11 miles to the town of Keith. The railway station, castle and both the distilleries above are all within a few minutesâ€™ walk of each other (although a little way from the centre) â€“ combine them all for a perfect day out.\n\nðŸš¶ After nosing around the village centre, Glenfiddich Distillery, Balvenie Castle and a heritage railway are all a short walk north; our Giantâ€™s Cradle walk also starts nearby.\n\nðŸš†ðŸšŒ The main bus route comes in from Elgin, though there are occasional other routes. A short walk out of town, the Keith & Dufftown Railway is mainly for tourists but can be used to get here from Keith on operating days."
