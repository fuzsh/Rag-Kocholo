        "text": "Welcome to Dufftown\n\nDufftown is located at the junction of the River Fiddich and Dullan Water, in the traditional Scottish county of Banffshire, approximately 550 miles north of London and 16 miles south-east of Elgin.\n\nThe town has a population of around 1,700. Administratively it is within the unitary council region of Moray which covers an area of approximately 2,238 sq kms and which has a population of around 87,000.\n\nThe town, with its seven working distilleries, is considered to be the capital of the malt-whisky distilling industry and distillery tours are a popular visitor attraction. There are also some notable historic buildings, including the remains of the 13th-century Balvenie Castle where Mary Queen of Scots stayed in 1562. It is a good base from which to explore the beautiful surrounding countryside.\n\nThe town's history dates from 1817 when it was founded by James Duff, the 4th Earl of Fife, to give employment after the Napoleonic Wars. Balvenie Castle, begun in the 13th century, has had several royal visitors during its eventful past, including Edward I and Mary Queen of Scots.Â The town's perfect water sources rapidly led to it becoming a centre of whisky distilling, and the largest distillery still working in the town is Glenfiddich. The Highland Games take place here every year, attracting many visitors.\n\nEconomically, the service industry, including tourism,Â is the largest sector of the local economy, employing around 64% of all workers. Whisky is the most important industry, the largest of its distilleries being Glenfiddich.\n\nDufftown takes its name from James Duff, the 4th Earl of Fife, who founded the town in 1817."
