        "text": "Dufftown-Glenlivet 10 years 75cl - Old Bottling\n\nBottled in the 1990's\n\nDufftown Distillery\n\nDufftown Distillery is located in the eponymous village of Dufftown, in Scotland's famous Speyside region. Founded in 1896 by the firm P. Mackenzie & Co, the distillery has a long history of whisky production and is one of seven distilleries in the village, earning Dufftown the title \"Whisky Capital of the World\".\n\nA unique feature of Dufftown Distillery is the use of water from Jock's Well, a nearby spring that contributes to the purity and character of their whiskies. Dufftown whiskies are known for their smooth and accessible flavour profiles, with notes of fruit, honey, vanilla and a subtle hint of spice. The distillery uses traditional copper pot stills and a slow distillation process, ensuring a rich and balanced spirit.\n\nThe whiskies are mainly matured in ex-bourbon and sherry casks, creating a deep and complex flavour. Dufftown produces mainly for the blended whisky industry, but its single malts are also appreciated by aficionados for their consistency and quality. The combination of a rich history, traditional techniques and an ideal location makes Dufftown Distillery a respected name in the world of Scotch whisky.\n\nGlenlivet Distillery\n\nGlenlivet Distillery is located in the remote and scenic Livet Valley in the Speyside region of Scotland. Founded in 1824 by George Smith, Glenlivet was the first legal distillery in the region after the Excise Act of 1823, making it a pioneer in the Scotch whisky industry. Its location in the Livet Valley provides access to pure spring water from Josie's Well, which contributes to the distinctive purity of their whiskies.\n\nA unique feature of Glenlivet is its use of mineral-rich water and lengthy fermentation, resulting in a smooth and fruity spirit. Glenlivet whiskies are known for their elegant and balanced flavour profiles, with notes of tropical fruit, flowers, honey and vanilla. Maturation mainly takes place in a combination of ex-bourbon and sherry casks, creating a rich and complex flavour.\n\nThe distillery continues to innovate and expand, making it one of the best-selling single malt whiskies in the world. The combination of a rich history, unique location and high-quality production makes Glenlivet a respected name in the world of Scotch whisky."
