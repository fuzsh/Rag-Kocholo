        "text": "Dufftown is a town in the parish of Mortlach in Banffshire. The town was originally named Mortlach in the Middle Ages, until the 19th century when the Earl of Fife built the town as a housing for soldiers returning home from war. He named the town Dufftown.\n\nDufftown also hosts a highland games event every July which attracts many tourists.\n\nDufftown's notable buildings include Balvenie Castle, which was partly built with stones from the ruins of nearby Auchindoun Castle. The street plan of Dufftown is mainly four main roads meeting at the clock tower; previously a prison but now a tourist information centre.\n\nWhisky in Dufftown\n\nDufftown is located on the River Fiddich and is the location of several Scotch whisky distilleries. It produces more malt whisky than any other town in Scotland; in fact, a signpost on the way into Dufftown declares it the \"Whisky Capital of the World\". The largest and best known of the many surrounding distilleries is the Glenfiddich distillery that distills Glenfiddich single malt Scotch whisky. The Glenfiddich distillery is owned by William Grant & Sons, Dufftown's largest employer. This proliferation puts it on the famed Whisky Trail, which also includes Keith, Tomnavoulin, Marypark, and Tomintoul.\n\nReferences"
