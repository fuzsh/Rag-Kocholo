        "text": "$159.99 price per bottle\n\nOver half of Scotland’s malt whisky distilleries are found on Speyside, and Dufftown distillery is at the centre of this fertile region, caught between mountains, rivers and sea. One of two new expressions released from The Singleton of Dufftown Malt Whisky in 2014, Singleton Sunray takes its name from a type of fly used for salmon fishing. Aged in American bourbon casks, which have the potential to impart more vanilla, wood and coconut tones to the spirit it holds, this elegant Single Malt Scotch Whisky is the smooth brother to the vibrant Singleton Tailfire. Freed from the restraints of age statements, the master blenders of this Dufftown distillery focused on coaxing a maximum amount of characteristic flavour from this flagship Single Malt. Each sip brings with it aromas of apple, floral and heather. Golden and rich on the palate, it's an elegant example of Dufftown’s honeyed intensity."
