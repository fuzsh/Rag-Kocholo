The town is the biggest exporter of whisky in Britain and you'll find plenty evidence with lots of distilleries around town, such as Glenfiddich, the largest of the lot.\n\nPop into the Whisky Museum which tells the story of the water of life, while the Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival, held twice a year, is a must for all you enthusiasts!"
