        "text": "$159.99 price per bottle\n\nOver half of Scotland’s malt whisky distilleries are found on Speyside, and Dufftown distillery is at the centre of this fertile region, caught between mountains, rivers and sea. Perfectly rich, balanced and smooth, the unmistakable taste of The Singleton comes from a unique selection of European Oak casks that bring rich fruit aromas and American Oak casks that release honeyed hints of vanilla. It is a rich, smooth Single Malt designed to be the perfect access point for new consumers into the Single Malts category. This smooth, naturally rich Single Malt Scotch Whisky has sweet fruity notes and a lingering, pleasurable warmth. Notes of toasted nut work perfectly with the palate of blackcurrant, brown sugar and espresso coffee. Serve by adding a touch of water to bring out the classic Speyside fruit-sweet aromas."
