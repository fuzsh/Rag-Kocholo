        "text": "The Gordon’s Cross route is part of a network of promoted paths which start and finish at the Clocktower in Dufftown Square where there is a map board. The routes are centred around Dufftown, acknowledged as the malt whisky capital of the world, situated at the edge of the newly created Cairngorms National Park. Dufftown has seven operating whisky distilleries including the famous Glenfiddich brand.\n\nThe route starts at the Clocktower, originally a jail but now the seasonal Tourist Information Centre.\n\nTravel along Church Street and down past the kirk. Cross the river to Hardhaugh, turn left onto the track between the old kirkyard and new graveyard. Branch off to the right and follow the track through two gates, and straight on to where a bench is situated on the path between the fields.\n\nAlongside is a large stone, the base of the ‘Gordons Cross’, or gibbet, where the Gordons held the power of ‘Pit and Gallows’. Note the fine view northwards over the town with Mortlach Distillery in the foreground.\n\nContinue on the track, cross the Huntly road and follow the signs for the ‘River side Path’. This follows the River Fiddich for a short way through attractive glades and woodland in a natural setting, a tranquil haven by the water’s edge.\n\nCross Crachie road bridge and turn left to make your way back up Fire Street to the Clocktower.\n\nThe section of route between Hardhaugh and the Crachie Road Bridge is not recommended for horses or cyclists due to the nature of the route surface and the presence of physical barriers.\n\nSome of the species to look out for: Flora ¡V Alder, Blackberry, Blaeberry, Bird Cherry, Ferns, Fungi, Gean, Hackberry, Heather, Honeysuckle, Mimulus, Primrose, Rowan, Scots Pine, Silver Birch, Sweet Cicely, Stag Horn Moss, Violet, Wood Sorrel, Woodrush, Wych Elm. Fauna ¡V Badger, Big Cats, Brown Trout, Buzzard, Capercailzie, Dipper, Deer, Fox, Heron, Otter, Owls, Pied Wagtail, Red Squirrel, Ring Ouzel, Rook, Salmon, Sea Trout, Stoat, Water Vole, Wild Cat, Wren."
