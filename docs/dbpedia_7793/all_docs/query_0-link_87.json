        "text": "Map of Speyside Whisky Distilleries Open to Visitors\n\nâ€‹We run themed and tailor made Speyside Whisky Tours around the Moray Speyside region. You can see from the map that there is a lot of choice. Add in the fact that some of the distilleries have a variety of whisky and tour options and you can see why whisky lovers come to this area to enjoy a wide range of whisky experiences.\n\nThis Speyside Whisky Map highlights the many distilleries open to visitors. We can take you on a 1 day, 2 day or 3 day whisky tour. The map also includes the Speyside Cooperage near Dufftown (not a distillery but a critical component in the whisky making process). All these are working distilleries except Dallas Dhu just outside Forres which has a self guided tour (currently closed) around the now silent distillery.\n\nAll these distilleries offer tours however some have limited availability e.g. might open only on a Tuesday and Thursday. Others tend to be longer tours e.g. Balvenie and take a full morning. These tend to be more suitable for 2 to 3 day Speyside Whisky Tours unless of course you are a big fan and then it might be a must visit even on a day tour.\n\nA proportion of them also have whisky tasting sessions as an alternative to the tour. Distillery Tours focus on the production process as well as the unique story of the whisky and distillery history. They then end with a whisky tasting. With histories stretching back into the past, each has its own unique story to tell.\n\nSpeyburn Dsitillery is to be added to the map."
