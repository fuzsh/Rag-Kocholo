The \"traditional\" figure of 7 (\"Rome was built on seven hills, Dufftown stands on seven stills\") is still reflected in the 7 stills tour during the Speyside Festival (though it covers all 9 sites). There is a nosing and tasting evening at the Commercial Hotel Hall in Dufftown every Wednesday at 20.00 throughout the summer.\n\nDistilleries\n\nAs mentioned above Dufftown has many -\n\nBalvenie Distillery - www.thebalvenie.com/\n\nConvalmore Distillery (dismantled)\n\nDufftown Distillery - www.malts.com\n\nGlendullan Distillery\n\nGlenfiddich Distillery - www.glenfiddich.com/\n\nKininvie Distillery\n\nMortlach Distillery\n\nParkmore Distillery (dismantled)\n\nPittyvaich Distillery (obliterated)\n\nAlso close to:\n\nAllt-a-Bhainne Distillery\n\nDufftown Station\n\nDufftown's 4 main streets meet at The Square in the middle of which is the Clock Tower, which was once the town's jail, but is now more welcoming as the Tourist Information Office. Dufftown's broad streets were planned by James Duff, Earl of Fife in 1817, it has since spread to encompass the much older settlement of Mortlach surrounding the ancient church (parts of which are believed to date back to around the year 700) in the Dullan valley, and site of Dufftown's first distillery - Mortlach.\n\nDespite the number of distilleries, they are now owned by just two companies - William Grant & Sons and Diageo. The original William Grant built Glenfiddich Distillery after learning the distilling trade while working at Mortlach. The other end of Dufftown also has a long history - Balvenie Castle dating back to the 1200s.\n\nArriving & Departing\n\nOpen Cycle Map Bing Map\n\nNearest National Rail stations are Elgin (ELG) (17 miles), Keith (KEH) (10) or Huntly (HNT) (14). Live train times: ELG, KEH, HNT. The preserved Keith & Dufftown railway runs up to 3 trips a day at weekends in summer and some Fridays too - also during Speyside Festivals, when there are special whisky tastings on the trains.\n\nSleeping\n\nBen Shea 21 Fife Street 01340 821359\n\nBraehead Villa Braehead Terrace 01340 820461 (closed)\n\nCommercial Hotel* 4 Church Street 01340 820313\n\nDavaar17 Church Street 01340 820464\n\n​Dullan Brae 53 Fife Street 07818 892091\n\nDunvegan21 Macduff Place 01340 821124\n\nThe Elms54 Fife Street 01340 820471\n\nErrolbank GH134 Fife Street 01340 820229 (for sale May 2013)\n\nFernbankParkmore 01340 820136 (closed)\n\nFife Arms HotelThe Square01340 820220\n\nFournet House*Balvenie Street01340 821428\n\nGlen View1 Corsemaul Drive 01340 821503/07740 440890\n\nGlenernan71 Balvenie Street 01340 820403 @\n\nGowanbrae B&B*19 Church St 01340 821505\n\nHighland Spirit B&B 51 Fife Street 01340 82136 @\n\nInveravon*77 Balvenie Street (closed)\n\nMorven*The Square 01340 820507\n\nNashville 8a Balvenie Street 01340 820553\n\nOld SchoolhouseKirkton, Mortlach 01340 820076\n\nSandy & Helen Nicoll 9 Conval Street 01340 820565\n\nScorrybreckBalvenie Street 01340 820428\n\nTannochbrae GH22 Fife Street 01340 820541\n\nTom-na-muidh House 32 Albert Place 01340820893/07732 545045\n\nMaureen Turner 1 Coopersmill, Balvenie Street (no longer a B&B)\n\nMrs Welsh 48 Balvenie Street 01340 820279\n\nSee the Dufftown site for Self Catering options\n\nNear Dufftown\n\nCastleview Auchindoun (A920) 01340 820941/07747 784462 (2 miles)\n\nThe GablesLettoch (B9009)01340 821485 (2)\n\nLaggan Farm Auchindoun (A941) 01340 820392/07792 138054 (3)\n\nEating\n\nCastle Chinese Takeaway* Church Street 01340 820100\n\nThe Coffee Pot 7 Balvenie Street 01340 820246\n\n​Commercial Hotel* 4 Church Street 01340 820313\n\nDJ Chippie Cafe* 16 Fife Street 01340 821500\n\nSpice of India 9-13 Church Street 01340 8280820\n\nLa Faisanderie* 2 Balvenie Street closed\n\nThe Malt Barn*Glenfiddich Distillery 01340 820373\n\nNoah's Ark* Balvenie Street 01340 821428\n\nTannochbrae* 22 Fife Street 01340 820541\n\nTaste of Speyside* Balvenie Street 01340 820860\n\nThe Seven Stills* 30 Fife Street 01340 820880\n\nThe Stuart Arms* 22 Conval Street 01340 820302\n\nDrinking\n\nCommercial Hotel* 4 Church Street 01340 820313\n\nFife Arms Hotel The Square 01340 820220\n\nThe Seven Stills* 30 Fife Street 01340 820880\n\nFormerly The Royal Oak.Good range of malts.\n\nStables Whisky Bar (Tannochbrae)* 22 Fife Street 01340 820541\n\nProbably the largest selection of malts in Dufftown.\n\nThe Stuart Arms* 22 Conval Street 01340 820302\n\nFormerly the Mason's Arms.
