        "text": "The Glenrinnes Distillery sits in the presence of the mighty Ben Rinnes. This prominent mountain, located a few miles southwest of Dufftown, dominates the local landscape. Alex Christou and his family established the Glenrinnes Distillery. They officially opened the doors to the distillery in 2019. They launched the Eight Lands spirits brand, including Eight Lands Speyside Organic Gin and Eight Lands Speyside Organic Vodka, in the same year.\n\nBen Rinnes was the inspiration for Eight Lands; with a height of 2,759 ft on a clear day from the summit, you can see eight different regions of Scotland, including Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, Morayshire, Nairnshire, Inverness-shire, Ross and Cromarty, Sutherland, and Caithness.\n\nAll spirits production, including distillation, bottling and labelling, takes place on-site at the distillery under careful supervision to produce authentic, excellent spirits using several locally sourced sustainable ingredients, including the freshwater that flows freely past the distillery door at the foot of Ben Rinnes.\n\nDistillery\n\nGlenrinnes Distillery\n\nThe Glenrinnes Distillery was designed to sympathetically fit into the rural, rugged landscape and appear like any other agricultural building. Upon closer inspection, you’ll see the name Glennrinnes Distillery adorned across the building. Completed in 2019, the Glenrinnes Distillery sits at the foot of Ben Rinnes, a local mountain and landmark in the Speyside region of Scotland. The distillery is home to custom spirit stills designed, engineered, and fabricated by local coppersmiths at Speyside Copper Works. The distillery features a 1,000 litre pot still called ‘Rebecca’ and two ten-plate column stills. The whole distillation set-up was designed to provide complete flexibility and control over the finished spirits produced, with the columns providing further copper contact for the spirits produced and various chambers separate from the main pot for infusing botanicals and flavours. The second floor features the tasting room, providing an elevated view of the main distillery space and local landscape. Distillery tours and gin tastings allow visitors to learn more about the distillation process, the background behind the distillery and the brand, along with tasting various spirits produced at the Glenrinnes Distillery.\n\nDetails\n\nTour: Yes\n\nGin School: No\n\nCafe: No\n\nBar: No\n\nShop: Yes\n\nBooking: Learn more about Glenrinnes Distillery experiences here\n\nAddress\n\nGlenrinnes Distillery, Keith, Moray, Scotland, AB55 4DB - View on Google Maps"
