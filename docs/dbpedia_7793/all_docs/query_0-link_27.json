        "text": "Dufftown History\n\nOne of a number of distilleries which started as a mill, Dufftown started producing whisky in 1896 for its owner, the blending firm Mackenzie & Co (which already owned Blair Athol). It became part of Arthur Bell & Sons in 1933 and was a key player within that blender’s estate, increasing its stills to eight by 1979 – currently there are six.\n\nBell’s also built the neighbouring Pittyvaich distillery in 1975 (it was run more or less as Dufftown 2) to cater for the rise in demand for its blend. Pittyvaich closed in 1993 and was demolished in 2002. Bell’s was bought by Guinness in 1985 and two years later Diageo was formed."
