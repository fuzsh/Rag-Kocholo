        "text": "Description\n\nAbout the Distillery\n\nThe Singleton of Dufftown is produced at the Dufftown Distillery, located in the Speyside region of Scotland. The distillery was founded in 1896 and is known for its commitment to craftsmanship and quality.\n\nHow this product is made\n\nIngredients: The whisky is made from 100% malted barley, which gives it its characteristic smoothness and depth of flavor.\n\nMashing: The malted barley is ground into grist, and hot water is added to create a mash. The enzymes in the barley convert the starches into fermentable sugars.\n\nFermentation: The mash is then fermented using yeast, and the fermentation process converts the sugars into alcohol. This produces a low-alcohol liquid known as “wash.”\n\nDistillation: The wash is distilled twice in copper pot stills to create a higher-proof spirit known as “new make” whisky.\n\nAging: The new make whisky is transferred to oak casks for aging. Singleton of Dufftown 15 Year Old is aged for a minimum of 15 years in oak barrels, which allows the whisky to develop its rich and complex flavors.\n\nBottling: After the aging process, the whisky is carefully selected and blended to achieve a consistent flavor profile. It is then diluted to the desired alcohol by volume (ABV) and bottled for distribution.\n\nTechnical Details\n\nAppearance: Singleton of Dufftown 15 Year Old has a rich amber color, reflective of its extended maturation in oak casks.\n\nNose: The aroma is warm and inviting, with notes of sweet caramel, vanilla, and ripe fruits, along with subtle hints of oak and spice.\n\nPalate: On the palate, the whisky offers a smooth and well-balanced taste. Flavors of honey, toffee, and dried fruits are complemented by gentle spice, including notes of cinnamon and nutmeg.\n\nFinish: The finish is long and satisfying, with lingering notes of caramel, oak, and a touch of dark chocolate."
