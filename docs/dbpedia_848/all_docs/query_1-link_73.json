        "text": "The Generali Berlin Half Marathon is a great half marathon that is famous for being a fast race. The flat route means many runners make good times here, and runner often break personal records at the Half Marathon in Berlin. So if you’re coming here to run, you’ve made a good choice. You probably have some questions as you prepare for your trip, and I’ve put together lots of information to help you travel to Berlin for the Half Marathon, this year on April 7, 2024.\n\nTo be clear, I am not a runner. Unless you count an occasional 10 second sprint to catch a tram or an equally quick but sillier jaunt with my yorkie. So I can’t help you with prepping for the actual running part of your Berlin Half Marathon trip.\n\nBut the Berlin part? I’ve been living here since 2015, so yeah, I can help with that. Berlin is a fantastic city, and I’m hoping you enjoy your time here before and after the race. Let’s take a look at some helpful tips to get you ready and make the most of what Berlin has to offer.\n\nBerlin Half Marathon Hotels\n\nBerlin is well connected by public transportation, so you really could stay anywhere and easily reach the starting line of the Half Marathon. But you might want to stay a little closer to reduce your race day stress.\n\nThe Half Marathon starts on Str. des 17. Juni a little east of the Victory Column and ends after crossing through Brandenburger Tor, not far from the starting point. Str. des 17. Juni is a major road that runs through Tiergarten Park, so there aren’t any buildings right there. But there are plenty of hotel options within a 15-20 minute walk or a couple of stops on transport.\n\nAre you looking for info about the Marathon in September? Check out my guide to Berlin for Marathon visitors.\n\nHow to get from Berlin Airport to the city center\n\nIf you’re flying to Berlin for the Half Marathon, you’ll need to know how to get from the Brandenburg Berlin Airport into the center of the city to reach your hotel. Luckily this is a reasonably easy thing to do. I have a full article about how to get from Berlin Airport into the city in case you want more details, but here is the short version.\n\nPublic transportation\n\nThere are several trains that run from the airport into Berlin city center. The most well known choice is the FEX train, which means Flughafen Express. This is the airport express train, a regional train that goes from the airport to Ostkreuz to Gesundbrunnen to Berlin Hbf (central train station) and in the reverse order going back to the airport.\n\nThere are also a few other regional trains and Sbahn lines. The Sbahn will take longer than the FEX train, but it still might be a good choice depending on exactly where you’re going and the timing.\n\nThe easiest thing to do if you want to use public transport in Berlin is download one of the transport apps (BVG Fahrinfo, VBB Bus & Bahn, or even the DB Navigator app (Deutsche Bahn) will work) and put in Flughafen BER as your starting point. For your destination, you can either put in the closest station/stop to where you’re staying, or you can put in the actual street address of your hotel.\n\nThe airport is in zone C, so you will need a ticket that covers zones ABC to get from the airport into central Berlin.\n\nWho is this option good for?\n\nAnyone who is comfortable using public transportation, or at least comfortable trying it even if it’s your first time\n\nBudget travelers\n\nTravelers looking for the most sustainable/environmentally friendly option\n\nTaxi/Uber/FreeNow\n\nYou can get a taxi at the airport, or you can use Uber, or a local app similar to Uber called FreeNow. Friends have told me that, depending on where they’re going, Uber or FreeNow can cost the same or less than a taxi. Usually it’ll be anywhere from 50 to 80 euros.\n\nWho is this option good for?\n\nIf you’re nervous about public transport\n\nIf you have a lot of luggage\n\nIf you know you’ll have data on your phone to use the apps\n\nGetting around in Berlin\n\nAs I mentioned before, Berlin has a good public transportation system with a network of Ubahns (mostly underground), Sbahns (mostly above ground), trams, and buses. And technically there are a few ferries, but you’re unlikely to see those.\n\nSo whether you’re sightseeing before or after the half marathon, or you’re trying to get from your hotel to the start of the race, public transport is your best option. Download the BVG Fahrinfo app or the VBB Bus & Bahn app (they’re very similar) and you can get routes for anywhere in the city.\n\nIf you’re traveling from outside the EU, you should get a SIM card or eSIM to be able to easily use the transport app, among other things, while you’re here exploring Berlin.\n\nFree transport for Half Marathon runners\n\nHalf Marathon participants get free transport from 5am to 7pm on race day. According to the website, your race/bib number is your transport ticket, and it’s valid for zones AB.\n\nSo if you have a flight out that day in the afternoon, this will NOT get you to the airport. Don’t ride without a valid ticket because ticket checkers do come by occasionally, and the fines are 60 euros. They are especially notorious for checking on the way to the airport.\n\nDon’t worry, I’ll explain more about tickets for getting around in Berlin next.\n\nInfo about transport tickets\n\nI mentioned earlier that you need a ticket for zones ABC to get from the airport into the city. Most of where you’ll go in Berlin is in zone A, and some things are in zone B. Zone C is technically outside the city limits, and it includes the airport, Potsdam, and Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp, to name a few.\n\nA 24 hour ticket is probably your best option since it allows you to use the transport system as many times as you want within a 24 hour period. Currently a 24 hour ticket for one person is 9.90 euros for zones AB.\n\nAnother perk of the 24 hour ticket is if you’re traveling with kids to Berlin. This ticket covers one adult PLUS up to three kids aged 6-14. Any kids 5 or younger travel free and don’t even count towards that total. Anyone 15 and up counts as an adult and needs their own ticket.\n\nIf you’re staying in Berlin for more than 4 days, the 7 day ticket is your best choice. It costs 41.50 euros for one person for zones AB. Unfortunately the 7 day ticket doesn’t cover kids the way the 24 hour ticket does. It covers up to three kids aged 6-14 ONLY from 8pm to 3am on weekdays, or all day on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nAnd always validate your ticket at one of the machines on the Sbahn or Ubahn platforms, or on board a tram or bus. If you’re using a 24 hour ticket or 7 day ticket, you validate it on the first use.\n\nRead more about using Berlin’s public transport.\n\nBerlin Half Marathon Expo Information\n\nThe Expo is where you go to pick up your race kit, so this is an important part of your Berlin Half Marathon trip. You will need your race start card and ID to pick up your race kit.\n\nThe Expo takes place at Tempelhof, a former airport that’s now one of Berlin’s favorite parks. The airport building is still there, and this is where you’ll find the Expo.\n\nAddress: Platz der Luftbrücke 5, 12101 Berlin\n\nYou should be able to enter through the airport building from the street side. But some of the event is held outside the airport building, on the park side. If for some reason the airport building isn’t open, walk south from Platz der Luftbrücke along Tempelhofer Damm until you see where you can veer off to the left to get behind the building and into the park.\n\nIt is highly recommended that you use public transport because there’s no parking. The closest station is U Platz der Luftbrücke where you can get the U6 line. The U6 Ubahn line has stops at Friedrichstrasse, Unter den Linden, Stadtmitte, and Kochstrasse (Checkpoint Charlie), among others.\n\nIf you’re coming by Sbahn, you can take the Ringbahn (line S41 or S42) to the Tempelhof station and walk north about 10 minutes. Or you can switch to the U6 and go north two stops to Platz der Luftbrücke.\n\nThe Expo runs at the following times ahead of race day:\n\nFriday April 5, 2024, 11:00 am – 8:00 pm\n\nSaturday April 6, 2024, 9:00 am – 6:30 pm\n\nI definitely recommend spending some time exploring the park either before or after you go to the Expo. It’s a really wonderful park that still has the runway, there are fenced dog run areas, picnic areas, bird protection zones, community gardens, and more.\n\nTempelhof also runs interesting tours of the airport. Their website says tours don’t run when special events are going on, but I recently took the tour, and the guide did tell me they still run the tours on expo days. It was a really good tour, so book well in advance if it interests you.\n\nGroceries, running supplies, and any other pre-race needs\n\nIf you’ve decided to stay in an apartment or a hotel with a kitchenette, you will need to pick up some groceries. Even if you plan on eating out a lot, you might still want to go buy some bananas or other food. Here are the common grocery stores you’ll find in Berlin:\n\nRewe, Edeka, Kaufland: Mid range grocery stores\n\nLidl, Penny, Aldi, Netto: Budget grocery stores\n\nDenn’s BioMarkt, Bio Company, Alnatura: Organic grocery stores (bio means organic in German)\n\nIf you need shampoo, vaseline, contact solution, or anything else you’d get at a drug store at home, look for DM or Rossmann. They have things like toiletries, makeup, hair products, bandaids, and more. But they do not sell over-the-counter medicine.\n\nIf you need medicine, like Tylenol or Advil, you’ll need to go to a pharmacy, or Apotheke in German. The Tylenol equivalent is Paracetomol, and the Advil equivalent is Ibuprofen. I highly recommend bringing some from home since the German versions will be more expensive and come in smaller quantities.\n\nFor any athletic gear you might have accidentally forgotten, Decathlon is a good sporting goods store. There’s one near Alexanderplatz.\n\nAny other kinds of stores you might need while you’re in Berlin for the Half Marathon? Let me know, and I’ll add some suggestions here.\n\nHow to get to the Berlin Half Marathon start\n\nThe start/end of the Half Marathon in Berlin is along Str. des 17. Juni. between Brandenburger Tor and Victory Column. You can see the full restricted area on the official map here, which labels all the important things like bathrooms, first aid, clothing/bag drop off, and more.\n\nThe closest stations to the entrance are Bundesplatz on the U5 and Brandenburger Tor on the U5 and S1, S2, S25, and S26. It’s also easy to reach from Berlin Hbf, Friedrichstrasse, and Potsdamer Platz.\n\nThere is no parking, so please use public transportation to get to the start zone. Remember that your bib works as your transport ticket from 5am to 7pm on race day.\n\nBerlin Half Marathon route: Sights you’ll see on the course\n\nObviously I hope the Half Marathon route isn’t the only sightseeing you do while you’re here, but it is pretty cool to run past some famous Berlin landmarks.\n\nMitte\n\nBefore the start of the race, in and around the restricted area, you will easily see the Reichstag Building and Brandenburger Tor. If you are walking from Potsdamer Platz, you will also pass the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. And almost the entire restricted area is in Tiergarten Park.\n\nShortly after you start running, you will reach the Victory Column. If you have time during your trip, and you think your legs can handle it, climb the 285 stairs here for one of the best views of Berlin.\n\nAs you leave Tiergarten, you’ll see Charlottenburger Tor at about the 2km marker. This was the gate towards Charlottenburg Palace. Often you’ll hear that Brandenburger Tor is the only remaining city gate in Berlin, so this might be a bit confusing. But you have to remember that Brandenburger Tor marked the western edge of the city. Tiergarten, Charlottenburger Tor, and Schloss Charlottenburg were outside the city limits.\n\nCharlottenburg\n\nNow you’re running in the Charlottenburg district. Just past kilometer marker 4, you’ll pass Charlottenburg Palace, one of the best castles in Berlin. It was built in a Baroque style in 1695 as a summer palace for Sophie Charlotte (Queen Consort of Prussia at the time) and has gorgeous gardens and a large park surrounding it.\n\nFor several kilometers, you will run through some lovely streets in Charlottenburg and pass by a small lake called Lietzensee. Around kilometer marker 9, you will turn onto Kurfürstendamm, the most famous shopping street in Berlin.\n\nA little after kilometer marker 11, you’ll pass Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. This church was heavily damaged in World War II, and instead of repairing it, the church was left in partial ruins as a reminder of the destruction of war. Shortly after the church, you’ll pass KaDeWe, a famous department store that’s the largest in Europe after Harrod’s in London.\n\nSchöneberg and Mitte\n\nYou’ll run through Schöneberg for about a kilometer or so, through Nollendorfplatz, which is considered Berlin’s gay district. Halfway between kilometers 13 and 14, you’ll turn north (left) and head back into Mitte, reaching Potsdamer Platz by kilometer 15.\n\nAround kilometer 19, you’ll pass Gendarmenmarkt. This is usually one of the prettiest squares in Berlin, but unfortunately it is under construction until late 2024/early 2025.\n\nFrom there, you will make your way to Unter den Linden and quickly reach the finish line just past Brandenburg Gate.\n\nSightseeing before and after the Half Marathon in Berlin\n\nYou’ll get to see a few of Berlin’s attraction while you’re running, plus some non-touristy neighborhoods. But there are a lot of important attractions you won’t see on the race. Here are a few things you should really make time for before or after the half marathon.\n\nAnd if you want to go beyond the major tourist sites, check out these hidden gems in Berlin. Also, runners in past years have mentioned that taking a Berlin hop on hop off tour the day before the half marathon was a good way to see some of the major sights while resting their feet.\n\nCherry blossoms\n\nBerlin actually has lots of places to see cherry blossoms, and early April is usually a good time to find some of them.\n\nMany of them are located along the former border between East and West, and one of the best places to look is near the north end of Mauerpark along Schwedter Strasse, as pictured above. Check out where to see cherry blossoms in Berlin, including a map.\n\nBerlin Wall Memorial at Bernauer Strasse\n\nThe Bernauer Strasse Wall Memorial is my favorite place for learning about the Berlin Wall and how it affected people and communities. The Wall split one side of this street from the other, and eventually displaced a church and even a cemetery.\n\nMost of this memorial is outdoors with markers on the ground that show you where escape tunnels were, info placards to teach you about the Wall, and more. You’ll see a few remaining pieces of the Berlin Wall, and there’s a building about halfway through that you can go into, and a few levels up is a viewing platform that looks into the former death strip.\n\nThe visitors center shows two short films about the Wall, alternating times for German and English. They get me all teared up every time I watch them. I highly recommend making time for the Bernauer Strasse Wall Memorial.\n\nBerliner Unterwelten tours\n\nAnother great way to learn about Berlin is by taking a tour with the Berliner Unterwelten organization. They have World War II era and Cold War era focused tours that are very interesting and take you underground (Unterwelten means underground).\n\nDepending on which tour you take, you could see old bunkers, escape tunnels that went under the Berlin, and more. I’ve taken the “Under the Berlin Wall” tour and it was excellent.\n\nEast Side Gallery\n\nThe East Side Gallery is one of the most famous sights in Berlin, and it’s also worth seeing while you’re here.\n\nThis is considered the largest outdoor art gallery in the world. You’ll see lots of different pieces of art painted on the Berlin Wall along the Spree River, some original, some replicas, some newer pieces.\n\nTV Tower\n\nOne of the most famous sites in the city, the Berlin TV Tower, or Fernsehturm in German, can be seen from almost anywhere in Berlin. It’s 368 meters (1,207 feet) tall, is one of the tallest structures in Germany and the European Union, and was inaugurated on October 3, 1969.\n\nBuilt by the Soviets, it was originally supposed to represent the strength of communist East Germany. Today it is a symbol of the reunification of Germany and a symbol of Berlin itself.\n\nThe TV Tower is a great spot for views of Berlin since it’s so tall. You can take the elevator to the viewing platform at about 200 meters high for 360 degree views of the city. There’s also a revolving restaurant on a different level where you can enjoy a nice meal while admiring the views.\n\nBerliner Dom\n\nThe Berlin Cathedral, or Berliner Dom in German, is a gorgeous protestant church in Mitte that you shouldn’t miss. It’s located on Museum Island, and you can take a tour (for a fee) and even climb 270 stairs to the top for amazing views of Berlin.\n\nMuseum Island\n\nMuseum Island is a UNESCO designated collection of five world class museums.\n\nThese museums are Pergamonmuseum, Altes Museum, Alte Nationalgalerie, Bode Museum, and Neues Museum. The Pergamon Museum is the most famous one, and unfortunately as of mid October 2023, it is closed for several years for renovations. But the others are still open and offer an excellent experience.\n\nTopography of Terror\n\nThe Topography of Terror Museum sits on the grounds of the former headquarters of the Gestapo and the SS between 1933 and 1945. This is where they organized the persecution and killings of Nazi opponents, and where they coordinated the genocide of Jews, Roma, and Sinti.\n\nToday it’s a powerful museum with an indoor and outdoor section where you can learn about the events that led up to the Holocaust and WWII, the War itself, and the aftermath. It’s definitely one of the best World War II sites in Berlin.\n\nWhere to eat in Berlin\n\nBerlin has lots of great food, so you won’t go hungry here. It’s an international city with almost every type of cuisine you could imagine.\n\nAre you a celiac? Pick up one of these super detailed gluten free restaurant cards that you can show to restaurants in Berlin and Germany to help you eat safely during your trip. They’re written by a celiac and translated by native German speakers.\n\nOne of my favorite German restaurants here is a place that specializes in Schnitzel, called Schnitzelei. They are usually booked up well in advance, so make reservations early. They have three locations, but the one in Mitte is most central. Location: Novalisstraße 11, 10115 Berlin Mitte\n\nAnother good choice is Schwarzwaldstube, a restaurant specializing in German food from the Black Forest. They have Schnitzel, but also Maultaschen, Flammkuchen, Spätzle, and a few other things. Spätzle might not be your traditional meal for the day before a race, but it is German style fresh pasta, usually with cheese on it. Location: Tucholskystraße 48, 10117 Berlin Mitte\n\nFor currywurst, I recommend Curry 61. This is close to Hackescher Markt. Location: Oranienburger Str. 6, 10178 Berlin Mitte\n\nFor Döner Kebap, Mustafa’s Gemüse Kebap in Kreuzberg is the most famous. But I’m not sure it’s worth the crazy line. You could easily wait over an hour in line for this place, and most locals agree it’s all hype. Instead I recommend trying the similarly named (and possibly connected, but I’m not sure) Mustafa’s Gemüse Kebap either here or here.\n\nFor more recommendations, check out my list of German restaurants in Berlin if you’re interested in trying some German food while you’re here.\n\nMitte is the central district in Berlin, where you’ll find many of the major sights in the city. You’ll probably spend a good amount of time here, so I’ve put together a list of the best restaurants in Mitte Berlin, including German food, non-German food, cafes, bars, and more.\n\nIf you’re spending some time in the Friedrichshain district, that’s where I live, so I eat out there more than anywhere else. I have a guide for where to eat in Friedrichshain that has lots of suggestions. Like this wonderful ramen place, in case you want another option for carb loading the night before the race.\n\nThose three blog posts have more restaurants than you could eat at in one trip, so you’ll have lots of choices.\n\nI know a lot of runners tend to like pasta for a pre-race meal. There’s an organization called True Italian that puts on a variety of events each year (Ice Cream Week, Pizza Week, etc.) and I trust their recommendations for Italian food. Their Pasta Week isn’t until November, but you can look at their list of pasta restaurants here and get some great suggestions.\n\nOther good places to eat are Magic John’s Pizza for quick and delicious NY style and Detroit style pizza, and KYO Grill for tasty Japanese skewers.\n\nAnd if you’re looking for someplace to drink, there are lots of rooftop bars in Berlin with fantastic views, and Berlin craft beer pubs. April is usually too early for Berlin beer gardens, but if it happens to be a warmer than usual spring, they might open a little early.\n\nMore helpful things to know before coming to Berlin for the Half Marathon\n\nHere are some more tips, tricks, and frequently asked questions to help you with your trip to Berlin for the Half Marathon.\n\nWhat to pack for April in Berlin\n\nSpring in Berlin usually means mild weather, but early April can sometimes be cold. Chances are it won’t be hot for race day, but it might be chilly depending on how much winter in Berlin is still hanging on.\n\nApril can also be rainy, so be prepared with some rain gear just in case. Average highs are in the mid 50s F (about 13C) and average lows are around 40F (about 4C). But of course, always check the forecast before you leave for your trip.\n\nCheck out my spring Berlin packing list to make sure you haven’t forgotten anything, and be sure to include your running specific gear.\n\nAre you traveling from outside of Europe? Visitors from non European countries, like the US and many others, will need a plug adapter for Germany. This is because Germany and most of mainland Europe have a different plug style than North America, the UK, and many other parts of the world.\n\nAnd if you plan on buying souvenirs from Berlin, make sure you leave some space in your bag when you’re packing.\n\nHow does tipping work in restaurants in Berlin?\n\nIf you’re coming from the US, you’re used to tipping 15-20% as a standard practice when you eat out at a restaurant. In Berlin and the rest of Germany, servers are paid at least minimum wage and they have normal benefits. Tipping is not mandatory, and you certainly don’t need to tip 15-20%, but you probably should still leave a tip.\n\nEven though servers aren’t relying on tips to survive the way they do in the US, tips are still appreciated. Especially with all of the different things that have hit the economy in recent years – pandemic and inflation to name a few – it’s becoming more and more expected to give some amount of tip.\n\nWe generally round up. So if our bill is 27 euros, we’ll round up to 30 euros. A good rule is to leave a few extra euros or about 10%.\n\nBut don’t leave money on the table. When your server brings you the bill, tell them the amount you want to pay. Again, if it’s 27 euros, tell them “make it 30” and they will charge you 30. If paying by cash, they’ll give you the appropriate change. You can read more about tipping in Berlin for more details.\n\nCan you pay with credit cards? Or do you need cash?\n\nThis is another thing that throws people off when they come to Germany. In general, Germany is much more cash based than other countries, despite how modern it is in many other ways. Things have been changing over the last few years, and it’s more and more common to be able to pay by card or tap and pay with an app on your phone.\n\nBUT you never know when you’ll run into a place that only accepts cash, or they might only accept cash or local bank cards. If you’re coming from outside of Germany, you won’t have this type of card, so you’ll need to have cash.\n\nPublic toilets that charge usually require coins. Some stalls at fresh markets and flea markets only take cash, though even that is getting better. And then there are some places that take cards, but they might have a minimum of 5 or 10 or even 15 euros.\n\nSo my advice is to go to an ATM when you arrive, take out 50 or 100 euros, and use it for something small to break it down into smaller bills and coins. Then you’ll have a little cash just in case you need it. If your trip is coming to an end and you still have cash, just start paying for a few things with cash instead of your card to work through it.\n\nCan you order tap water in restaurants?\n\nThis is an annoying thing if you’re coming from almost anywhere else, but restaurants here almost never give you free tap water. The tap water is safe in Berlin and Germany, but Germans mostly like to drink fizzy water. If you order water, they will bring you a bottle, which you have to pay for, and the default is fizzy, so ask for still if you don’t like the bubbles.\n\nIf I’m ordering something else to drink, especially alcohol, I will sometimes ask for tap water. Most places will bring it, but I have been told “we don’t have it” which is obviously ridiculous, but that’s just how it is. I would never ask for tap water as my only beverage.\n\nAre you traveling to other parts of Germany or beyond?\n\nBerlin is a fantastic city with great food, loads of history, and so many things to do. I really hope you have several days here to really enjoy the city before or after the Half Marathon.\n\nBut if you’re planning on traveling to other parts of Germany, you won’t regret it.
