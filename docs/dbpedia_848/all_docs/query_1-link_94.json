        "text": "The Berlin-Brandenburg 2070 initiative offers the city, region, and state the opportunity to do this. The design principles outlined in this proposal represent a paradigm shift for a metropolitan region characterised by a distinct and highly revered DNA. However, the entire region suffers from unsustainable forms of development and lifestyles that require radical rethinking and redesigning.\n\nTo implement these radical ideas, new coalitions and collaborations are required. Different levels of national, state, and local governments must engage in a vision that breaks with established standards, boundaries, and jurisdictions. At the local level, residents must ensure that compromises are worthwhile before supporting the scale of the efforts and restructuring proposed by this ambitious yet feasible plan. The private sector must participate in the common civic agenda to ensure the long-term added value of its assets and investments.\n\nNew governance structures and partnerships are needed to execute the physical and design proposals that optimise the city’s existing DNA. Positive models for this already exist; for example, in London, where the Mayoral Development Corporation is helping to shape the legacy of the 2012 Olympic Games over the next 40 years in an effort to correct the enduring inequalities in the city. Across the Channel, the Reinventer Paris initiative has laid down an advanced environmental and social agenda that enables the city’s mayor to carry out projects on public land that prioritise urban quality over profit. This competition proposal combines ecological principles with creative urban-development concepts. The ecological principles and design concepts presented here will allow Berlin and Brandenburg to remain recognisable in their original qualities and characteristics and also to develop and strengthen these while taking into account climate change.\n\nFour ecological principles define this proposal. Berlin and Brandenburg can better prepare for climate change by implementing the following ecological guidelines.\n\nReducing CO2 emissions and supporting a resource-friendly, regional circular economy\n\nLimiting new construction sites to pre-exiting sealed areas or plots, minimising the amount of sealed land, and creating green spaces with numerous potential uses\n\nIncreasing population density from the current 4,000 to 5,000 inhabitants per square kilometre, improving road links between the towns outside Berlin, and improving transport systems within Brandenburg\n\nCreating user-friendly transport opportunities in the region and towns by prioritising bicycle use, public transport systems, and environmentally ­friendly passenger vehicles\n\nThese guidelines result in five main design concepts, which define the implementation measures of this regional planning and urban development plan.\n\nPromote a circular economy and CO2 reduction\n\nThe countryside and cities are integrated into energy, food, water, and recycling cycles. The raw materials for new buildings grow in Brandenburg’s forests. In an area stretching from the south of Bernau to the northwest of Berlin, a new forest is emerging; it will help reduce CO2 levels. This effort is boosted in the city centre by the creation of large parks with a high proportion of trees and biologically active rainwater-harvesting systems.\n\nControl the amount of sealed land and green areas\n\nAll new construction occurs on pre-existing sealed sites, and the number of new sealings is to be severely limited in future. If possible, existing green spaces, including allotment gardens and cemeteries, are to be combined into larger, open public spaces to help reduce the heat build-up in the city centre and to promote the formation of local fresh-air corridors. Allotment gardens are to be converted into urban agricultural areas with combined work and residential use at their edges.\n\nLakes, rivers, and canals function as urban-planning elements\n\nBy exercising the public right of first refusal, private properties along lakes and rivers are acquired to ensure public access to the water and waterways and, if feasible, to carry out the appropriate restoration of these. This supports the increased absorption of torrential rain and improves the quality of life; canals should be redesigned or created so that they can also be used by vaporetti.\n\nPromote densification and higher density\n\nThe principles of barrier-free access, a social and functional mix, and fairness will all dictate the design of both individual buildings and entire neighbourhoods, establishing strong local communities and reducing commuting. Different lifestyles will find their own spaces through the connection and overlay of living, working, and recreational activities in the immediate vicinity. In the region, new living and working space should primarily be integrated in densely populated city neighbourhoods and settlements. All housing estates are to be examined with regard to their potential for densification. This competition entry assumes that this area can accommodate an additional one million residents.\n\nExpand ring roads and radials\n\nThe car-friendly city of the twentieth century is to be transformed into a human-friendly city of the twenty-first century. For this purpose, the typical ­Berlin ‘growth rings’ are further developed and updated on a larger scale: several new growth rings from the city centre via the outskirts to the surrounding communities strengthen individual identities, and distinctive radials with urban qualities promote higher structural density in the outlying areas.\n\nThree new ring systems expand the inner city and structure the outskirts and country.\n\nThe first is Berlin’s ring road, which is transformed into the ‘Ring Boulevard’. The A100 becomes a high-density inner-city ring road with mixed-use buildings and public facilities. New high-rises serve as landmarks and provide orientation in the city. The new, ground-level, 39-kilometre-long Ring Boulevard and the main ­radial roads with their densely built up surroundings unite the city centre with the outskirts. The ring boulevard is between 60 and 80 metres wide, planted with four rows of trees, and furnished with kiosks, bars, and cafés. It is conceived as an urban lounge that accommodates both commercial and non-commercial activities. The ring not only symbolically prevails over the east-west divide, but also over the traditional distinction between the inner city and suburbia. It invites all residents in the region to rediscover the city at street-level and to see it as an attractive public space. Along the inner ring road and the radials, tall buildings can promote densification measures and accommodate a total of one million people.\n\nThe second ring is characterised by water and bicycle paths. In the south, the Teltow Canal between Köpenick and Potsdam is to be redeveloped as a 42-kilometre-long network of paths and a densification area; as a tangent, it is connected to the regional cycle-path network. In the north, a new canal forms the counterpart to the Teltow Canal, completing the second ring.\n\nThe third ring is the A10 motorway, which is commonly regarded as the outer edge of Berlin. Within this area, the development of Berlin is to take place according to inner-city criteria (floor-space index of at least 1.5); this would require contractual agreements for the designation of buildable land and the exchange of land between Berlin and Brandenburg.\n\nThe fourth ring is Berlin’s Ringbahn circular railway (inner ring). The significance of Berlin’s ring road for the city is equal to that of this circular railway for the region. Its four-track expansion is intended to accommodate the circulation of closely timed local and regional trains. This also applies to the S-Bahn: outside of the S-Bahn ring, four-track viaducts presently accommodate freight trains. We propose using these for local and express passenger trains too. The viaducts will replace the railway embankments, reproducing the character of the S-Bahn viaducts and increasing the cross-connections and development potential. The regional stretches of the radials, S-Bahn, and U-Bahn are to be extended to create ideal transfer points on the circular railway for commuters.\n\nThe fifth ring is the Brandenburg Railway. The large Brandenburg circular ring (Berlin’s outer ring) will be closed to strengthen the independence of the surrounding region and to improve the regional network.\n\nBrandenburg and Berlin, Districts and Boroughs, Atelier Berlin-Brandenburg\n\nThe main protagonists are now on the border, and so the planning focus shifts from the the city centre to the outskirts. For the first time, the outskirts of Berlin and communities near Berlin, as well as Brandenburg districts, are the focus of settlement planning. Thus far, it has been the growth of land in Berlin and the growing influence of building regulations that have characterised such efforts; but current projects, such as the airport or the Berlin-Brandenburg Joint Regional Planning Department, are demonstrating a coordinated development that is being studied by both sides. This positive tendency should be further developed, as the great challenge of enlivening Berlin’s outskirts can only succeed if all ‘border residents’ are included in the process on a municipal level, where the symbiosis of urban and rural qualities is cultivated together.\n\n2030: Up to 99 Mini IBAs (International Building Exhibitions)\n\nOut of the (up to) 99 mini IBAs emerge 99 visionary and local ‘rulebooks’, which illustrate the legislative potential with which private neighbourhoods and natural islands can develop. Instead of repressive restrictions, concessions are made to a densifying city, a process which is controlled qualitatively by promoting diversity and visual qualities. The Berlin border area is to be deli­berately ‘discovered’ and developed as a place of longing. The first step to this end is the exploration and understanding of the existing and the found. This applies to both to both pleasing natural elements and seemingly unattractive areas, such as estates of single-family homes. Nevertheless, up-to-date subjects must be purposefully formulated and implemented so the positive qualities of the outskirts are strengthened and supplemented: public spaces, sharing (also in terms of bundling), mobility, and landscape as well as micro-­nature. With the help of the existing urban-planning rules, creative additions can be made based on local phenomena, thus creating exciting and characterful neighbourhoods, city districts, and green islands. The cooperation between these entities constitutes an urban model for the future.\n\nQualities: (A) Promoting, (B) Creating, (C) Retaining\n\nModule A: Retrofitting Suburbia\n\nNeighbourhoods along the axes of the star-shaped settlement structure are strengthened and revitalised. The focus of module A is on strategies for pre-existing residential areas, such as single-family housing developments along existing infrastructure axes, in particular areas near railways and other forms of public transport. A significant consolidation is proposed here to increase usage as well as to create diversity and new connections. The large number of interested parties and owners here already render classic planning strategies ineffective. Thus, the implementation of special construction rulebooks is proposed as a supplement. These are to be developed on a regional level, are preferably not restrictive, and allow an endorsed and controlled ‘extra’.\n\nModule B: Urban Hubs\n\nBetween the city and the surrounding area, at the intersection of high-performance infrastructures, housing and productivity: New settlement areas should increasingly take advantage of local conditions and be developed according to local aspects. Both spatial and typological inventions are appropriate if they combine a sensible housing density with the rich natural areas and formulate a new city type. How can new settlement areas can be developed according to pre-existing spatial conditions and local particulars? It is less a question of ­tabula rasa in the area around the city and more about urban development that expands on what already exists and thoughtfully condenses urbanity and nature in unison. In Berlin’s tradition of a polycentric city and today’s examples of crystallisation points beyond the city centre (Adlershof, Tesla, BER, TXL Urban Tech Republic, etc.), dense sub-centres are developed at strategically practical locations. Well-connected to railway and road networks, and in interplay with attractive landscape situations that are preserved and perceptible both spatially and typologically, these small centres benefit from inventions that combine a sensible housing density with the rich natural ­spaces to formulate a new, contemporary type of urban agglomeration. A robust, ­flexible ­urban ­development model can be ensured through the implementation of site-­specific parameters and guidelines, which are collaboratively developed in workshops, rather than by detailed development plans.\n\nModule C: Landscape Parks\n\nLarge natural areas, controlled growth, preservation of nature in and around the city, landscape and leisure: Preservation-worthy natural spaces are designated and rendered perceptible through individual qualitative measures or are activated as productive natural landscapes.\n\nAn expansion of our legal understanding of the term ‘outside space’ allows for the preservation of ‘pure’ nature with experimental additions. Existing natural spaces are to be protected. In addition, individual qualitative measures should be considered: these would make such spaces local recreation areas and activate them as productive natural landscapes. Green spaces close to the city serve increasingly as productive natural spaces, open spaces, and recreational areas. At the same time, they are enormously important for the city’s climate, air circulation, and the preservation of/an increase in biodiversity. The newly created regional landscape parks supplement the green belt with important conservation zones and opportunities for experimental green spaces and local recreation areas for the future.\n\nUrban Arcadia: Mobility\n\nNew connections as ring segments for a networked and polycentric outer city. The basic requirement for successful new neighbourhoods is a mix of typologies and of uses. In addition, reliable transport links to surrounding districts and areas, especially through public transport, is a decisive factor. As well as expanding existing arteries in the surrounding area, we are proposing a new railway link that would connect to existing railway lines and establish connections to other transport forms. In 2020, it is possible to offer new orbital connections on the outskirts of the city and between the existing ring lines (S-Bahn circular railway and Berliner Ring). Instead of a complete ring, there should be five key ring segments, for instance to and from the fast tram and ferry (Spree and Havel).\n\nUrban Arcadia: Participation\n\nRound Table 2.0/A website and app for coordinating and marking locations and plans. New players, new city! Nine Berlin districts and nine Brandenburg districts on the common state border represent a fresh start and a new understanding of urban growth. Instead of grouping (planning) competence cen­trally, the state border becomes a cooperation area that welcomes experimental housing concepts and creative city models and closely aligns these with the wishes and needs of the area’s residents. The smaller IBAs, summarised in one comprehensive exhibition, promote the necessary scrutiny of urban planners and architects via discussions with residents, focusing on important issues around this intermediate urban space. Emerging projects can examine current developments and generic suburban areas across Berlin’s borders and promote ideas and visions for new and exciting spaces and city blocks.\n\n2070 – Urban Arcadia Berlin\n\nBerlin has the unique opportunity to develop its border area by creating a compact band of natural spaces, new housing, and improving areas of single-­family homes. Over the last century, Berlin has experienced vast growth and strange phases of little or even negative growth. This both created and left a variety of special features that are still present on the city’s outskirts and which we are now to preserve and develop. Yet, in today’s urban discourse these areas are often ignored. We suggest reversing this trend and focusing our attention on this border area.\n\nResidents on both sides of the border between Berlin and Brandenburg will become the new players who help determine the future of the metropolitan region. Berlin’s border area is to be deliberately ‘discovered’ and developed as a place of longing. The first step to this end is the exploration and understanding of the existing and the found. Furthermore, current issues and ­ideas must be purposefully formulated and implemented to strengthen and supplement, step by step, the outskirts’ qualities. The border area of Berlin is to be celebrated as a sequence of exciting identities and discovered as a space with great potential. The multitude of contributions and test areas will pose common questions. How does the Berlin metropolitan region wish and how is it able to grow here? Which qualities should be protected and strengthened? Should the outskirts function differently from the inner city, and, if so, which ­urban form is appropriate? And how will we live in new neighbourhoods that consist of both city and nature?\n\nOur answer: definitely something different from the mission statement of the 1910 competition. These images refer to the attitude to life in Berlin and Brandenburg and build and expand on it. They give a positive boost to this region’s best attributes. Therefore, our proposal dispenses with detailed plans and replaces these with six strategic narratives that combine to form a grand scheme.\n\nModel\n\nThe ‘star-shaped settlement model’ is Berlin’s current urban development plan. Yet, its structure does not do justice to the nature of the agglomeration area. Berlin was never a monocentric city. The surrounding area itself has proper centralities, to which one cannot do justice with the singular star template. We therefore propose the World Island of Berlin-Brandenburg as a new model. The original term coined by Alexander von Humboldt is no longer compatible with polycentric Berlin and the state of Brandenburg, which surrounds it. However, the concept is nonetheless deeply rooted in the region. The World Island is dynamic and makes room for new, even unforeseeable, centralities while strengthening existing centres. The World Island knows mass and emptiness, habitats, constellations, star dust, gravitation, and orbits, phenomena we have translated into Berlin-Brandenburg narratives.\n\n100% City, 100% Countryside\n\nWest Berlin was long a major city without a hinterland. Open space was a scarce and protected commodity. The island location created extremes: high urban density within and emptiness and countryside beyond the border fence. Similar spatial constellations emerged in much of East Berlin as a result of socialist urban planning. Thus, Berlin and Brandenburg today have a unique relationship, which is a key quality of the region. It is not characterised by an endless suburban zone. This is where extraordinary extremes come together: 100 percent city here – high density, urban flair, and spaces dominated by people – and 100 percent countryside there – low density, nature, and rural areas.\n\nOur suggestion: Unconsciously, the World Island has created a development strategy characterised by one hundred percent city and one hundred percent countryside. This dual nature allows it to ideally respond to future chal­lenges ranging from climate change and energy transition to the preservation of natu­ral habitats. It should not only be applied to the borders of the individual settlement centres, but also to the inner peripheries. Large open spaces should remain open: parks, fallow land, unused industrial sites, and old railway tracks. Berlin and the towns and villages surrounding it can densify inwards; space is available, it just needs to be used efficiently.\n\nThe Blue ArchipelagoBerlin is a city on the water, and Brandenburg is a water landscape. Both ­places make too little use of these qualities. There is no strong relationship between the two, because water only connects places and people if the ­spaces in which the water is embedded can be experienced and permit these connections.\n\nOur suggestion: Strengthen and expand the waterway connections and networks between Berlin and the surrounding area. Berlin’s main arterial roads and axes should be modified to create new waterways. The new and existing waterways become the gateway to the Blue Archipelago through accompanying ecosystems and network of footpaths and bike paths. Water and the natural world punctuate Berlin and increase resilience. A public space is thus cre­ated in Berlin and it not only adds green-blue qualities to the city, but also gives Berliners access to the Brandenburg countryside.\n\nThe Constellations\n\nBerlin would not be Berlin without Potsdam, Bernau, and Oranienburg; and Brandenburg would not be Brandenburg without Berlin in its midst. Since the rise of Berlin as a metropolis, this tension has defined local identities. A similarly tense relationship between districts and neighbourhoods can also be observed in Berlin itself. This ‘culture of differences’ is a positive quality of both Berlin and Brandenburg; it is characterised not only by local loyalties, but also by existing opportunities and their further development. Areas directly surrounding Berlin in particular can provide benefits to supplement Berlin.\n\nOur suggestion: Create clusters that focus on these strengths: nature and culture, renewable raw materials and know-how. They are the elements of a new world of habitation, education, and production. Virtually and physically well-connected to regional transport paths, they offer what the larger, more established ‘star’ cannot. As open systems, they can develop into constellations of regional importance and serve as visible symbols of the World Island.\n\nThe New Sky over Berlin\n\nGlobal climate change is largely caused by our consumption and use of fossil fuels, which will eventually run out. Cities must meet their energy and foodstuff needs differently, and not in distant places, but locally, in Brandenburg or even Berlin. No additional square metre should be paved over for this and as much open space as possible should have multiple uses.\n\nOur suggestion: Most of the buildings in the World Island consist of one-fifth façade and a roof that is barely used. These roofs can be activated for energy and food production. Almost half of Berlin’s current electricity need could be generated by solar energy. Many of the flat roofs in Berlin could also be used as roof gardens for growing vegetables. Biogas could be stored in local storage balloons. Large power plants and supermarkets are being replaced by energy production networks and urban agricultural cooperatives. The new sky over Berlin would no longer be grey and barren, but green and verdant. In the areas around Berlin, the omnipresent former military bases can be converted into high-density production locations for food and energy. Their density and industrial scale could help them become ideal energy complexes of the post-fossil-fuel age.\n\nAs the city that is always becoming and never is, Berlin will never be truly finished. That is why Brandenburg will never be finished, either: it cannot be. This is true of the place itself and of its residents. They want to be heard and to have a say, to make a difference. They want to shape their city and their countryside. Everyone in Berlin and Brandenburg belongs to a ‘kiez’ (neighbourhood) and embodies that ‘kiez’ in some way. Thus, residents can play a more important, even decisive role in urban and regional development.\n\nOur suggestion: The city and the region should be divided into macro and micro zones. The macro zones consist of essential features: large natural ­areas, main road networks, local transport, supply networks (unless they can be decentralised), and strategic industrial areas. The micro zones are the ­areas, neighbourhoods, villages. Local and regional governments are responsible for planning and maintaining the macro zones. The micro zones are governed by their residents with the help of a professional administration. The internet, cellular networks, and other modern technologies are used to involve all residents in the decision-making process. When neighbourhoods are autonomous, there is competition between the them, and their residents define their identity themselves: green, quiet, urban, business-friendly, or more ­socially inclined.\n\nA colourful portrait of different gravitational zones for urban human coexistence in the World Island can emerge from the city of neighbourhoods and the countryside of villages and small towns. Construction-material cycles are associated with high energy consumption. Cement must be mixed, steel forged, and plastics synthesised. When a building is renovated or demolished, these materials migrate to landfill. Handling materials this way is neither sensible nor sustainable, and the scarcity of non-renewable raw materials already leads to thinking in material cycles and a shift towards renewable, and organic, raw materials. This also builds a new relationship between the urban metropolis of Berlin and its neighbouring Brandenburg.\n\nOur suggestion: Establish regional raw-material cycles. Building materials for Berlin should no longer come from foreign lands but be produced regionally. In new, high-tech production facilities, local wood can become a house wall. Once produced, these and other components are catalogued in databases. They are no longer discarded; when they are not in use anymore, they can be stored until they can be implemented in another process, perhaps even more than once. This creates ‘material orbits’ which can continue to function with minimal energy and material expenditure once they are established.\n\nSix Typologies for a Contemporary Metropolitanism\n\nSix typologies are defined. Each of them corresponds to an existing metropolitan situation that forms a city and defines society; yet they are not designed within the professional practice of urbanism. Three specific examples are presented from the compendium of islands that make up the archipelago. Each one develops two urban typologies together, presenting a pair of opposing but coexisting situations. And so, there six situations, whose details not only allow us to explain the urban islands independently, but also to pursue a unified project that represents the narrative of the city of Berlin as an archi­pelago. The six situations are as follows. First, urban domestic life: the domestication of urbanism (housing). Second, an alternative-modern event: pop-up urbanisms (leisure). Third, convergence culture: the development of public life (culture and society). Fourth, Industry 4.0: the fourth industrial revo­lu­tion (industry). Fifth, commuter urbanism: daily life with takeaway meals (infrastructure). And sixth, fluid work: overcoming boundaries between production and consumption (work).\n\nFour Territorial Strategies\n\nBerlin’s urbanism is defined not only by its urban structure or its spatial form. It is defined by its composition as a ‘network’ and by the possibilities of connecting the urban actors scattered across the territory. The metropolitan soul of Berlin depends on its ability to create connections between different metropolitan elements and on how different contexts can be transformed into social catalysts and into networked city islands of a metropolitan archipelago.\n\n1. Infrastructure and transport: from centres and peripheries to a network\n\nIn contrast to a centralised and hierarchical model for transport infrastructure, here we propose using an open network model, both decentralised and democratic. Instead of emphasising the current model, which circles around the four main railway stations in Berlin, we propose a number of connection hubs. This constellation of small transport hubs is democratically distributed across the entire area and helps to adjust the large infrastructural inequalities between the inner-city and peripheral areas. Based on this ­model, the terms ‘centre’ and ‘periphery’ would become obsolete, because, as with a neural network, all points are equally accessible and perfectly inter­con­nected. For this purpose, the existing hard infrastructures (trains and private cars) would be replaced with new models of smart mobilities, and soft infrastructures would be implemented.\n\n2. Industry and Energy: From Concentration to Dispersion\n\nThe industries of Berlin-Brandenburg are currently distributed unevenly. They are concentrated in large complexes far from conurbations, thus aggravating the tensions and inequalities between the city and suburbia. The distribution of the energy production centres is also unbalanced and creates a negative ecological footprint. For this competition, we propose a gradual transition to Industry 4.0 and renewable energies. This model dismantles the major hubs and distributes smaller ones throughout the entire region, in small industrial areas with integrated energy facilities. This new model has less impact on the land and on society, which allows it to be organically integrated into urban and natural areas. It rejects the already-outdated conventional model, which, because of its large and aggressive footprint, has prevented the coexistence of industry and society, energy and nature.\n\n3. Nature: From Seclusion to Integration\n\nIn our concept, nature is no longer a wilderness that is separate from urban settlements. Instead, it has multiplied into innumerable ‘natures’ that are no longer discovered but built, that are no longer found but are created. And, more importantly, they are not differentiated, sequential elements, but integrated into the urban elements and connected to them.\n\n4. Living and Working (Settlement Areas): From Zone Formation to Hybridisation\n\nThe strict zoning of urban programmes, which has shaped the design of the modern city for decades, has led to an inequality between large residential suburbs on the peripheries and dense work zones in the centres. This has resulted in a one-sided dependency between them, resulting in a lack of facilities in large metropolitan areas due to a lack of mixed programmes. Public and private areas are now trapped in separate areas. In view of this inequality, a hybridisation of private life and work is proposed. This is intended as a new urban and social paradigm in which new models of combining life and work can foster a balanced coexistence of both. A mixed territorial structure that integrates new urban tools such as teleworking, co-working, and co-­living would create innovative forms of a more heterogeneous metropolitanism.\n\nThree Specific Sub-areas:\n\n1. TXL – Urban Tech Republic\n\nTXL is a metropolitan island that develops two of the six defined urban typologies: Industry 4.0 and alternative-modern industries that, unlike tra­di­tional industries, are based on research, information production, and customisation. The large scale of these urban interventions enables them to coexist with ­other, more informal forms of urbanism based on the fleeting nature of events. Thus, within the same master plan, formal planning tools coexist simul­taneously with other, more informal ones.\n\n3. Neu Südkreuz\n\nParticularly in cities like Berlin, the strong sense of community among citizens crosses the boundaries between micro and macro, between global and local. In many European cities, urban development is centred around infrastructural nodes based on so-called transit-oriented developments; in contrast, ­Greater Berlin expands on the concept of urban development, overlaying it with its pronounced social heterogeneity and thus generating transit-oriented communities. Neu Südkreuz is a good example of this and, therefore, a number of urban residential areas have been considered. Free from the traditional restrictions of the familiar living environment, a variety of programmes and uses penetrate into urban areas. The overall concept is supplemented by a catalogue of action protocols for the urban gaps so typical of Berlin which characterise the surrounding areas. The catalogue offers a set of strategies for sharing four kinds of empty space: abandoned land, inner courtyards, residual spaces, and decommissioned infrastructures.\n\nUrban Island Königs Wusterhausen\n\nInstead of a conventional residential district, which, in most European cities, often becomes a commuter town, we are proposing a hybridisation of living and working, private and public, for this sub-area. The housing blocks do not become merely personal and private spaces, but are enlarged and ex­panded towards the city. Public capsules are incorporated, which offer social ­value by facilitating encounters, dialogues, production, and exchange. The master plan includes three superimposed levels of information: an island of urban fragments, scattered in a sea of nature and agriculture; housing blocks that contain public spaces; a matrix of work centres as well as cultural and urban facilities. The connection between the fragments is established by a series of pedestrian walkways and a system paths for electric vehicles (bicycles, gondolas, cable cars, and drones).\n\n1) Water Landscape\n\nThe water landscape connects Brandenburg and Berlin: it shapes their industries, biodiversity, agriculture, energy, transport, and the character of their cultural landscapes, including their lakes and rivers. At the same time, the Elbe catchment area, where much of Brandenburg is located, has the second lowest water availability per capita in Europe. Climate change will make this worse. The reduction in rainfall and the increase in evaporation during the summer months will cause Brandenburg to become even drier; this dryness will be interrupted by increased bouts of heavy rain, which, in turn, will pollute the water and soil. We therefore understand the structure of Berlin-­Brandenburg as a network of water cycles and place people’s daily interaction with water in the foreground. A system of green corridors in protected habitats for flora and fauna increases biodiversity. Waters and moorland are protected even more; mono­cu­ltural, large-scale agricultural areas are to be converted into climate-proof farms. These are the elements of a cyclical economy for sustainable, respectful, and profitable use by the federal state.\n\n2) Urban Landscape\n\nBerlin’s main traffic routes have defined the star-shaped settlement structure of Berlin, which has provided open spaces and prevented congestion by condensing traffic along the public transport axes. But the star-shaped settlement cannot handle the diverse nature of the Berlin-Brandenburg region alone. A more flexible and varied structure is needed, which is why the network of the water landscape will now infiltrate and support the star-shaped settlement of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Intersections arise, around which new centres will emerge and grow together to form networks. Berlin and Brandenburg, nature and city, join together to form a landscape of differences, composed of natural and man-made spaces. Urban sprawl is halted, and the existing settlement structure is densified and transformed at existing and new hubs in a targeted manner. These hubs are the centres of tomorrow. No longer the outskirts, they will be characterised by an exceptional quality of life and urban activity – in nature and near water.\n\n3) Energy Landscape\n\nThe supply of energy will also be decentralised. Energy will now be generated efficiently with wind, sun, and water. Solar panels and wind turbines are integrated into the landscape in a targeted manner in locations where wind speed, soil conditions, topography, and settlement structure are ideal. Industrial ­areas that are no longer functional are repurposed for the decentralised storage of energy in the form of hydrogen, water heat, or pumped storage. Short ­travel distances avoid energy losses; decentralisation increases resilience; surpluses are fed into the grid; oil and gas become obsolete; and carbon neutrality becomes the new norm. Power companies run by citizens and cooperative ­energy companies based on an intelligent network system make energy production ­accessible to all.\n\n4) Mobility Landscape\n\nThe average speed of motorised traffic in Berlin is currently 20 kilometres per hour. This is a speed people could easily maintain on (e-)bicycles. On average, households in Berlin own fewer cars than in other German cities. We are on the right path. The streets emptied by the coronavirus pandemic have given us an idea of what is possible with fewer vehicles: streets with room for playing and sports, and more peace and quiet. Yet, the technical development is unclear; and we do not know which solutions will prevail. What is certain, how­ever, is that mobility will change, that cars and private transport will no longer play such a central role, and that autonomous driving will increase. We are therefore creating the conditions for more sustainable mobility. We propose the following: expand the network of bicycle lanes and make it suitable for fast e-mobility; create space for ‘inter-modality’ points, where travellers can switch between different modes of transport (communal, public, private); restrict motorised private transport; direct heavy traffic to transport axes and waterways and repurpose the freed-up areas as public spaces; and upgrade streets as shared spaces for various future modes of mobility.\n\nWe have selected three sub-areas to illustrate our concepts.\n\n1) Intersection Oranienburg\n\nOranienburg typifies the complexity of the region. It is characterised by different urban structures, active and decommissioned industrial plants, and a diverse, water-permeated landscape. A centre of tomorrow emerges at the intersection of the star-shaped settlement structure and the landscape network. Ecosystems are strengthened, and sustainable urban structures emerge. The city coalesces around the scenic network along Lehnitz Lake, the Havel River, and the Havel Canal. Precipitation is collected, recycled, buffered, infiltrated, and removed during heavy rains by a sustainable water management system. This way, the city is cooled in hot summers, and soil nutrients are preserved. The ‘inter-modal transport’ concept relies on a combination of regional public transport connections with frequent service and a dense network of ­(e-)­bicycle routes. A park with a community garden is created on Sachsenhausener Strasse, combining urban agriculture, sustainable production, and urban and residential housing. At the southern end of Lehnitz Lake, a former industrial site is reno­vated and the floors are organically cleaned. Part of the area will be converted into an urban park with leisure facilities; another part will be developed into a mixed residential area between the park and the water. An energy park is cre­ated in the northern green area close to Kuhbrücke. The energy generated here is converted into hydrogen and stored. A research centre for water management is built east of the Lehnitz sluice.\n\n2) Trebbin Water Landscape\n\nThe district of Teltow-Fläming is typified by rivers and artificial canals, agriculture, shrinking villages, polluted waters, monocultural forests, and a loss of biodiversity. It is also the most productive agricultural district in the Brandenburg region and is thus also responsible for causing environmental pollution. We present how the spatial and functional systems of the area can be sustainably transformed into systems of the cyclical economy. The regional park is part of the larger ecological corridors. It protects and uses the landscape, biosystems, and waters productively for energy, leisure, and food production, resulting in a new cultural landscape that is not bucolic, but efficient and productive. Small-scale organic farming replaces monocultures. A system of water storage, infiltration, purification, and recycling enables high drinking water quality standards and ensures the supply of water across all seasons. A green energy system produces wind and solar energy and networks production sites with decentralised energy storage systems. Cooperative energy companies for inexpensive and decentralised energy management are founded.\n\n3) Kreuzberg Confetti\n\nBerlin’s heterogeneous architectural history is still visible in northern ­Luisenstadt and southern Friedrichstadt. Our concept elevates the mixed environment in Kreuzberg into a ‘super-mix’ environment, demonstrating that urban density and living in nature are compatible with each other. It prepares the mobility infrastructure for the ongoing shift towards sustainable transport methods and creates an urban landscape that protects both water and environment. We restrict through traffic to axes such as Skalitzer Strasse and ­Linden Strasse, and we redesign streets such as Heinrich-Heine-Strasse and ­Oranienstrasse as shared spaces. This creates car-free super blocks, with attractive footpaths and (e-)bicycle lanes. The freed-up areas are converted into green spaces. Mobility becomes multi-modal; switching between different modes of transport becomes easy; and different kinds of shared mobility flourish. Lenné’s Luisenstadt Canal is opened up again and expanded. Mariannenplatz, Waldeck Park, and Böckler Park are expanded to form a park system. Precipitation is managed intelligently and is used to cool the city. Flooding events are mitigated by decentralised infiltration in park areas, hollows, tree trenches, and retention ­areas. The attractive green spaces invite residents and visitors alike to engage in sports and other recreational activities. The air quality is excellent. The buildings are densified, expanded, repurposed, and on the ground floor revitalised – all in a targeted manner, without additional soil sealing. ­Linear blocks from the 1970s, buildings from the Gründerzeit years, and buildings from the International Building Exhibition are placed in a new context without losing their original character. A wider range of functions are mixed together; and the paths ­become even shorter.\n\nDecentralisation Goal\n\nThe federal government’s decentralisation goal sets out to create equal living conditions throughout the region, with a special focus on structurally weaker rural areas. Accordingly, this urban development concept assumes that Brandenburg’s existing towns and cities will be strengthened over the long term, in part to relieve the pressure on Berlin. The measures proposed here can accommodate up to twice the number of inhabitants in the metropolitan region without compromising the quality of outdoor spaces and with only a minimal amount of additional soil sealing.\n\nRailway Rings\n\nBerlin currently has an inner railway ring and an outer railway ring. Two additional railway rings will be created. These will link the existing centres along the radial railway lines, strengthening them and helping to reduce transit traffic through Berlin. The third ring will largely run on existing railway tracks or directly along the Berlin circular motorway or ring road and will connect towns such as Oranienburg, Bernau, Straußberg, Königs Wusterhausen, Beelitz, and Nauen. The fourth ring will connect the so-called ‘second-tier ’cities, including Brandenburg an der Havel, Frankfurt an der Oder, and Cottbus. Both rings could link new sites that emerge for industries and businesses (such as Tesla) with the next locations on the respective ring. As a result, these sites will remain close to the new settlements and to Berlin.\n\nSub-area Brandenburg an der Havel\n\nThe strengthening of second-tier cities such as Brandenburg an der Havel, Frankfurt an der Oder, and Cottbus is a focus of the strategic development concept. The great qualities of these cities – their unity with the landscape, their historic city centres, and their good connections to Berlin – make them ideal as regional centres. When expanding these cities, it is important to preserve their historical character and their close connection to nature. The city of Brandenburg an der Havel is a good example of a second-tier city. The existing structures and the natural and organic elements of the city are inte­grated and further developed. The existing buildings with their block structures are further densified and extended to the city’s edge, marking a clear transition to the surrounding landscape. The contrast between the organic forms of the city, which can be found in the historic centre, and the typical ele­ments of industrial development such as tall silos, is explored in the form of new landmarks. At the same time, the natural spaces also enter into the city, so that the city and nature reconnect in a variety of ways.\n\nSub-area Westkreuz\n\nThe basic ideas of the master plan are exemplified by the development plan for the Westkreuz area: densification within the settlement boundaries, the development and conversion of traffic areas and unused areas, and the strengthening of the intersections of the railway rings and railway radials. The ­Westkreuz suburban railway station will be expanded to become a regional railway station which, like the Gesundbrunnen station, will allow riders to transfer from regional trains from the surrounding areas to the suburban ring railway. The motorway will now run underground and be partially dismantled. This will eliminate its destructive ‘barrier effect’. A dense, socially and functionally mixed urban district is planned on the large site and will be networked with the surrounding quarters. At Westkreuz, and at the three other railway intersections (Südkreuz, Ostkreuz, and Nordkreuz), two high-rise buildings with a height of between 100 and 200 metres will be built as a gateway to central Berlin. These pairs of high-rise buildings frame the high-rise groups in the central locations in the city centre. Most of the old railway tracks will be converted into a park, which will connect Grunewald to the east-west axis via the Lietzensee Park. The east-west axis will be developed into a green boulevard with rows of trees and a bicycle expressway in the middle.\n\nSub-area Berlin-Mitte\n\nA discussion of the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolitan region cannot overlook its centre, the historic heart of Berlin. Although the strategic development in the present concept primarily focuses on strengthening towns on the rings, central Berlin plays a vital role for the entire region. The historical development of Berlin from a small settlement into the political centre of Germany can only be observed here. The cultural institutions in the city centre also radiate across the entire metropolitan region. For the medieval core, it is proposed that the existing buildings from the GDR era are brought into a dialogue with a critical reconstruction of the historic city plan, so that Berlin’s long history is once again legible and the individual histories of the buildings can be remembered through their historical addresses. To the east of Berlin’s medieval centre, Lenné’s ‘green corridor’ project is revisited, and the connection between the Engelbecken and Volkspark Friedrichshain (via ­Straussberger Platz) is converted into a continuous green corridor and monumentalised by large urban squares.\n\nStrategic Reflections on the Process\n\nAs yet, there is no common, trans-national public discourse on the strategic development of the Berlin-Brandenburg metropolitan region. With its plans and images, the Berlin-Brandenburg 2070 competition offers an outstanding opportunity to initiate and advance this discussion. The winners of the competition should develop a common and comprehensive concept for the area’s long-term development through a multi-year process involving a dialogue with the public. This should be conducted in cooperation with the joint state planning authorities and in exchange with the citizens of the two states.\n\nOur strategy of gradually converting Berlin-Brandenburg into an urbanised-landscaped region is based on expanding and activating existing landscapes and infrastructural structures and reanimating latent existing ones. The strategy also involves introducing new innovative uses and leaving enough flexible spaces for unforeseen uses.\n\nA sustainable metropolis can only be developed on the basis of the landscape or countryside as a starting point. For Berlin and Brandenburg, the typical landscape structures include waterways, tree-lined avenues, ‘Angerdöfer’ (villages built around a central village green), and fields. The various terrains, soils, water structures, local climates, and habitats are the basis for both the diversification of landscape structures and structural development strategies.\n\nThe Schmettau map series includes historical ordnance survey maps of the area and offers valuable clues for activating the landscape. Densification measures should occur along the existing, often well-equipped infrastructures, particularly the arteries along railway and tram lines. The existing access network composed of historic tree-lined avenues is well suited to accommodate new forms of micromobility (on-demand buses, shared mobility, e-bikes). This creates a close-knit development network between less densely populated ­areas. Motorway feeder roads lying within the outer ring road become expressways and serve to transport goods, thus supporting inner-city production sites and factories. Travellers heading towards the city centre with private modes of transport from the surrounding areas and outskirts can transfer to the suburban train on the outer ring.\n\nA socially just and open society requires spatial and economic freedom in which diverse lifestyles and integration models can be tested and practised. Concept-based land-allocation procedures, designed to prevent the appreciation of real estate value, serve to promote cooperative, non-profit housing and make development projects accessible to smaller players. We illustrate our strategy of gradually converting the capital region into a landscaped-urbanised area with proposals for three specific locations. There are three main areas of focus: regional parks, new housing construction, and the transformation of the rays of the star-shaped settlement structure. Here, we specifically explore the settlements along the ray composed of Pankow, Buch, Bernau, and Barnim.\n\nA socially just and open society requires spatial and economic freedom in which diverse lifestyles and integration models can be tested and practised.

Here, we specifically explore the settlements along the ray composed of Pankow, Buch, Bernau, and Barnim.\n\nMosaic of Contextual and Inherent Diversity\n\nThe contour is formed by the contextual arrangement of five urban and rural elements that form a spatial mosaic: nature reserves; forest clearings; housing and regenerative microfarming; new urban areas; and special-use structures, large-scale projects, and energy infrastructure. These building blocks contribute to the densification of the star-shaped settlement structure and also strengthen the rural areas of Brandenburg, in part by reintroducing nature. Depending on the location, the mosaic can promote urban development or be a site of innovative agriculture and exemplary natural strategies. This is the strength of the contour: each building block consists of a variety of lifestyles, forest ecosystems, and biotopes.\n\nBarnim Regional Park (Bernau-Werneuchten)\n\nIn addition to the existing nature parks, four special park landscapes – re­gional parks – are to be established, two of which are already well developed. The new regional park between Bernau and Werneuchen will function as an incubator, stimulating the landscape transformation process. The Schmettau map series provides a point of reference for the reconstruction and development measures, as the microtopography and soil conditions have remained largely unchanged. These natural areas are to be expanded exponentially in relation to the current state (approximately by a factor of ten). In addition, existing forests are to be gradually returned to their original condition or repurposed for land-use management or – as natural parks and nature preserves – integrated into the surroundings.\n\nContour Mosaic, Focus: New Housing in the Relevant ‘Mosaic Stone’\n\nThe contour consists of five different urban and rural building blocks and creates an ecologically, economically, and socially diverse living environment by offering a mix of new housing developments and introducing new flora. The example used here is the area between Buch and Schwanebeck, which is crossed by the A10 motorway.\n\nNew Residential Construction\n\nThis mosaic stone establishes an experimental field that promotes ecological and social living spaces as well as diversity. As an ‘edge habitat’, it can accommodate various lifestyles within a parcel and promotes a decentralised, collective method of supplying energy and water. The structure and scale of the settlement is based on the dimensions that are required for agricultural self-sufficiency. The average parcel measures around 150 × 150 metres, which can be expanded or subdivided according to location and use. Existing landscape and building structures are either integrated or delineate the structure. Each parcel is surrounded by a public network of roads that can be flexibly assigned to different types of traffic.\n\nMixed-use constellations are to be ensured by an application process in which the applicant’s socio-ecological innovation concept is stated. The ensuing diversity in lifestyles will enable new qualities: economic construction methods; mutual care; carpooling; diverse public spaces; and innovations in agricultural-­ecological undertakings. The parcels are leased and not sold.\n\nLifelines, focus: redesigning a section of a radial street within Berlin; redesigning a section of an arm of the star-shaped settlement (Brandenburg).\n\nThe sub-area considered as an example lies in northern Pankow near Französisches Buchholz and Blankenburg. The development builds on the historical landscape structure with its tree-lined avenues, ditches, and villages and includes more recent additions, such as the motorway and the suburban railway. The redesign is based on the principle that existing and developed infrastructures in this area, which is characterised by low density, can and should support more residents and activities in a growing metropolitan region. The radial roads are integrated into a network of various arteries and forms in which the waterways, motorway, and suburban railway become supporting radials. This network constitutes the arteries of the star-shaped settlement structure and links the contour’s mosaics with the star’s interior. Along the arteries, between the arteries, and especially where transport routes intersect, higher densities are created through densification, the formation of public spaces, city projects, and the promotion of local and regional trade and production. The existing transport infrastructures become their ‘lifelines’.\n\nBerlin-Brandenburg and Europe\n\nThe global shift towards sustainable modes of transport and the expansion of railway and water transport are turning the Berlin-Brandenburg region into a hub of diverse cultural and trade corridors in the German and European context. Accordingly, this railway and waterway network is undergoing continuous optimisation. Growth takes place along the radial axes and connects the towns and city. The urban expansion areas follow the star-shaped railway lines between the protected natural landscape and cultural landscapes, thereby transforming the scattered settlement areas into more compact urban structures. In this way, buildable land for one million new residents is gained without radically altering the character of the urban structure or disturbing the harmonious natural areas.\n\nThe Countryside Comes to the Towns\n\nThe Berlin countryside is characterised by forests, lakes, and agricultural areas and harbours unique potential for the climatic and ecological regeneration of the region in the future. Strengthening the spatial connection between these areas and improving their incorporation into the growing and increasingly populous urban region is central to our concept. Natural and cultural landscapes will be boosted with the appropriate infrastructure and networks of paths for outdoor activities. Cultural landscapes reinforce the perception and appreciation of the region as an integrated entity and intensify the population’s connection with it, promoting empathy between the rural and urban residents.\n\nThe radial settlement arteries complement one another along the railway lines with their adjacent cultural landscapes. They reinforce Berlin’s star-shaped settlement structure and result in a coherent structure with complementary qualities: city, cultural landscape, and agricultural land. The third ring connects the radial arteries. We are adding a new third ring to the first and second rings to accelerate the connection routes between the towns on the outskirts of Berlin, thereby avoiding detours through Berlin. Because of the density and proximity of many towns in the north, east, and south, the third ring will also link these places; and the third ring will join the second ring to the west of Potsdam. This bypass optimises the internal dynamics of the second and third rings. The area inside Berlin’s first railway ring becomes the geometric centre of Berlin’s series of concentric transport rings. The third ring significantly increases mobility in the areas surrounding Berlin and reduces their dependence on the city. This ring will be realised in phases. The first segment will be built in the northeast, since the greatest added value is expected there, in coordination with the growth of Brandenburg’s centres. One can ensure the desired network optimisation, even when building the third ring in stages, by connecting it to the radial transport axes.\n\nUrban centres, composed of housing, commercial spaces, and social infrastructures, which will in turn benefit from optimal transport infrastructure, will emerge near the intersections of the rings and radial axes. Thus, ­Brandenburg’s growth areas near the third ring will see more opportunities to develop and connect with one other independently of Berlin.\n\nThe Third Ring as an Elevated Railway\n\nThe third ring is conceived as an elevated railway in order to protect the cultural landscape, agriculture, and wildlife. This also simplifies intersections between roads, motorways, and rivers. Lightweight construction fosters a harmonious relationship with nature and agriculture. The elevated trains provide a pleasing view of the surrounding countryside, and the suburban train stations in the towns become attractive centres.\n\nWe have selected three locations to illustrate the master plan. We analyse each location in terms of mobility, history, growth, and landscape. Two of the locations (Tempelhof-Südkreuz and Bernau) are situated at the intersection of radials and rings; the third location (Schwedt) is situated along a radial. Using these locations as examples, we demonstrate the characteristic features of the Berlin-Brandenburg region. These include: urban areas with contradicting histories; industries; diverse natural areas; good railway networks; and strong growth potential.\n\nTempelhof-Südkreuz has always been an exceptional area as it has remained undeveloped and is characterised by railways, meadows, barracks, and training areas. Today, the neighbouring intersections of the first ring and railway radials (Südkreuz) and of the B96 motorway, the underground, and the urban motorway (Tempelhof) offer unique potential for urban development.\n\nTempelhofer Feld is important as a recreation site and cold-air production area for the city centre. The optimal transport connections near Tempelhofer Damm make it ideal for large cultural projects in Berlin-Brandenburg. The former airport site could house a new state library, university campuses, and research centres. The areas along the railway will be mixed-use districts. The three prominent high-rise buildings at the junction of the B96 motorway, underground railway, and urban motorway make it an ideal location for a regional centre. The railway line is accompanied by a bike path, which enables fast journeys between the railway station and airfield. The urban motorway is ­ideal for future bicycle use. No longer isolated, Tempelhof-Südkreuz is now integrated into the urban landscape and fulfils an important function in Berlin.\n\nBernau bei Berlin is a great example of a Brandenburg town with a colourful archi­tectural history. The structure of the medieval wall and rampart continues to shape Bernau today. Socialist modernisation policies established in 1975 damaged but did not eradicate the fabric of the city centre. The railway runs from Berlin to the northeast, towards Szczecin and the Baltic Sea. The two military facilities testify to the importance of railway connections for the city. The construction of the third ring – and of the intersection with the north–south radial – will transform Bernau into a transport hub, which will promote the development of the areas near the railway station and the old town. The repurposed military complexes could accommodate new homes and research facilities. The renaturalisation of the Panke River and Panke Park ­nearby will allow residents to live surrounded by nature and enjoy optimal connections to other locations in the region. For regional tourism, the district of Barnim, starting from Bernau, offers an ideal point of departure, not least for tourists on bicycles.\n\nThree city models characterise Schwedt an der Oder: the medieval city (1265), the baroque city palace (1685) with its magnificent landscaped axis leading to the Mon Plaisir summer palace, and the model socialist city (Selmanagic 1960, Paulick 1962) built for the workers of the crude oil processing plant. Under the socialists, the city palace was destroyed in 1962 and replaced with the Palace of Culture. All three city models are in a fragmentary state today. Beyond the Oder lies a meadow landscape with one of more important bridges across the river. A railway line connects Schwedt, via Angermünde, to the radial axis running through Berlin, Stettin, and the Baltic Sea. We wish to optimise this connection, so that the radial axis will include a high-speed train from Berlin to Szczecin via Schwedt. This high-speed train will then continue along the Oder to the Baltic Sea. Appropriate city planning measures in Schwedt can bring together mobility, urban history, and nature to form a complementary and symbiotic relationship. It is possible to reanimate the three city models: by restoring the old town; by building around the castle near the theatre; by revitalising the green axis and the Mon Plaisir park; and by completing the town centre based on the socialist city model, with new buildings for research and tourist facilities. The new significance of the railway station will lead to urban densification and better transport connections. Former prefab building complexes will be renatured, and the alluvial landscape will be protected against development. These interventions and the growing regional tourism along the Oder, with its new port, municipal swimming complex, and national park, open up the best prospects for Schwedt, located on the railway line between the Baltic Sea and Berlin."
