        "text": "By today‚Äôs appearance, it‚Äôs easy to overlook the bridge at Bornholmer Strasse (also known as B√∂sebr√ºcke) as an historic landmark. On the night of 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall opened here first, at the Bornholmer Strasse bridge border-crossing between East Berlin and West Berlin.\n\n28 years undone in a matter of hours\n\nThe city of Berlin was divided in two between 1961 and 1989 with a physical wall as the physical manifestation of East German (GDR/DDR) policy. Bornholmer Strasse was the northernmost of the seven road border-crossings between West and East Berlin. Only citizens of West Berlin and West Germany (FRG/BRD) could enter East Berlin at this crossing, whereas citizens of East Berlin and East Germany were forbidden from using the crossing into West Berlin.\n\nOn 9 November 1989, the East German government announced new travel regulations which were incorrectly stated at a news conference. But once word had gotten out East Berliners could travel ‚Äúfreely‚Äù across the ‚Äúopen border‚Äù into West Berlin without the onerous process of a travel visa, people gathered at various border crossings, including Bornholmer Strasse at around 8pm. Border guards began letting pedestrians and cars trickle across the border by 930pm. Guards at other road crossings also began letting people through. But hundreds gathered became thousands, and when it became clear no additional support was forthcoming to manage ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù of the border, border guards decided on their own initiative to open the gates wide open at around 1130pm to relieve mounting pressure and appease those who openly demanded free passage. Just after midnight, 20-thousand people had already crossed the Bornholmer Strasse bridge and the inner-German/intra-Berlin border.\n\nIn a matter of hours, the 28-year Wall was rendered useless without a shot fired that night. All border controls ceased on 1 July 1990 (day of monetary union), and checkpoints were no longer manned on 3 October 1990 (German Reunification Day).\n\nInaugurated on 9 November 2010, a memorial and permanent exhibition occupy the new square, Platz des 9. November 1989, by the northeast corner of the bridge to commemorate that historic evening. Metal strips on the ground highlight events; for example:\n\n2242h (1042pm): ‚ÄúDie Tore in der Mauer stehen weit offen,‚Äù Tagesthemen ARD (‚ÄúThe gates at the Wall are wide open,‚Äù reported on West German ARD-TV news-program Tagesthemen.)\n\n2320h (1120pm): ‚ÄúTor auf! Tor auf! Wir kommen wieder, wir kommen wieder!‚Äù Ostberliner. (East Berliners shouting, ‚ÄúOpen the gate! We‚Äôre coming!‚Äù)\n\n2330h (1130pm): ‚ÄúWir fluten jetzt! Wir machen alles auf!‚Äù Stasi-Offizier (‚ÄúWe‚Äôre flooded with people! We‚Äôre going to open everything!‚Äù Stasi officers)\n\n0015h (1215am): ‚ÄúWahnsinn‚Äù, ‚ÄúIrre‚Äù, ‚Äúnicht zu fassen‚Äù. 20.000 Menschen haben die B√∂sebr√ºcke passiert. (Crazy, nuts, unbelievable; 20-thousand people cross the B√∂sebr√ºcke bridge.)\n\nBornholmer Strasse station\n\nWith its inauguration on 1 October 1935, the Bornholmer Strasse station saw S-Bahn train service from central Berlin north to the outlying towns of Bernau, Oranienburg, and Velten (e.g., 1936). S-Bahn service resumed with reconstruction after the Second World War (e.g., 1951). Because of its proximity to the East-West Berlin border and subsequent construction of the Berlin Wall, Bornholmer Strasse station closed on 13 August 1961, becoming a Geisterbahnhof or ‚Äúghost station‚Äù. West Berlin‚Äôs S-Bahn trains sped through the station without stopping, whereas East German trains traveled on new tracks from late-1961 along the so-called ‚ÄúUlbricht curve‚Äù between barriers near the ‚Äúghost station‚Äù; see images below. The station reopened 22 December 1990 for West Berlin trains, and a second platform opened the following August to allow train interchange. Today, Bornholmer Strasse station is served by trains on S-Bahn Berlin routes S1, S2, S25, S26, S8, and S85; additional side branches of the S-Bahn Ringbahn from both Gesundbrunnen and Sch√∂nhauser Allee stations go to Pankow via Bornholmer Strasse.\n\nPresent-day appearance\n\nArchival & Historical Images\n\nFacing north, divided tracks towards Bornholmer Strasse station (left-centre) and bridge.

My translation of the original picture caption: ‚ÄúAbout one million East-German citizens visited West Berlin on Saturday (18 Nov 1989). People cleared quickly through border crossing points, as seen here at Bornholmer Strasse. Since 9 November, the East German Ministry of the Interior has granted in excess of 10 million visas for private travel and more than 17500 permits for permanent departure from East Germany.‚Äù (Wikimedia CC3)\n\nMore\n\n‚Ä¢ Former border crossing at Bornholmer Strasse (berlin.de): English ‚Äì German.\n\n‚Ä¢ Damals-Heute (then and now) picture comparison, Chronik der Mauer, in German.\n\n‚Ä¢ Die Nacht, in der die Mauer fiel (The night the Wall fell), 30-minute YouTube video in German.\n\n‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúBornholmer Strasse‚Äù, 88-minute movie in German about the border guards on the night the Wall fell.\n\n‚Ä¢ Kreuzberged provides a concise history of the Bornholmer Strasse bridge (in English)."
