One could be forgiven for just […]\n\nThe Brandenburg Gates\n\nFew monuments encapsulate the image of Germany (and Berlin) as much as the Brandenburg Gate. Of all the National Monuments in Germany, the neoclassical structure is by far the most […]\n\nA History of Berlin’s BVG / VBB Ticket Prices\n\nAnyone that’s lived in Berlin for more than 5 years will have probably noticed that the fares for the BVG / VBB seemingly increase like clockwork every April. While we’ve […]\n\nJulius Fučík Memorial\n\nWhile many memorials and pieces of public art that were erected during the reign of the German Democratic Republic were removed or altered after German reunification, more than just a […]\n\nDenkmal für die Gefallenen der Garde Pioniere\n\nWhile traveling through Brandenburg, one can’t fail to notice how the villages and towns take care of their War memorials. Unfortunately the same can’t be said for many of Berlin’s […]\n\nCosmonauts, Communists, and the Kremlin in East Berlin\n\nIf there’s one policy from the German Democratic Republic that has left a lasting positive impression, then it would be the “Kunst im öffentlichen Raum” and the “Kunst am Bau” […]\n\nThe Pressecafe\n\nBerlin has rapidly changed over the past decade. Historic buildings that stood for over a century have been torn down to make way for luxury apartments and hotels, while the […]\n\nThe Nazi legacy of the Grazer Damm\n\nThere’s hardly a corner in Berlin that’s been left untouched by the legacy of the Nazis – be it through Hitlers and Speers architectural fantasy of building a new world […]\n\nBerlins Chernobyl Memorials\n\n35 years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, the event the aftermath have had consequences that still impact us to this day. The area around (and) Chernobyl itself has become a […]\n\nEverything you didn’t know about Berlins Leninplatz\n\nAs the German art critic and author Karl Scheffler once put it – “Berlin is damned always to become and never to be” – and even 110 years later this statement couldn’t ring truer. No […]\n\nVierter Ring – Hitlers unfinished Autobahn\n\n“Germania” – the mythical capital of the Third Reich. Looking back at the plans that Albert Speer came up with for Adolf Hitler in 1935, one can only wonder how […]\n\nKuppelkreuz – The cross of the Berlin Cathedral\n\nFew buildings in Berlin define the “skyline” and the city as much as the Berlin Cathedral. The imposing Neo-renaisance Cathedral is a tourist magnet, only dwarfed in visitor numbers by […]\n\nThe Staatsratsgebäude\n\nBerlin is a city of change. It always has been, and it most likely always will be. Berlin evolved from a small village in a swamp to the capital of […]\n\nSuperfest – The (almost) unbreakable East German Glass\n\nWhile most can and will consider German reunification a “success story”, the merger of the two German states also meant the loss of identity, purpose, and direction for many. There […]\n\nThe Recycled East German Border Crossing\n\nThe year 2019 marks 58 years since the construction, and 30 years since the fall of the Berlin wall. The 160km long wall ploughed its way through and around the […]\n\nWhat are those coloured eggs in German supermarkets?\n\nHave you ever strolled through a German supermarket and spotted those weird colored eggs? Do Germans sell easter eggs all year around? I’ve been living here long enough and have […]\n\nThe Frog Prince of Kreuzberg\n\nA solitary frog prince sits patiently on a porcelain ball, high above the masses waiting for their U-Bahn to arrive. What might seem like a quirky detail of an otherwise almost […]\n\nThe last depictions of Karl Marx in Berlin\n\nThe year 2018 marked the 200th anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx, as well as the 170th anniversary of the Communist Manifesto. Few people have had such a lasting […]\n\nThe Bridge of Scars\n\nOver 7 decades have passed since the Battle of Berlin and at first glance one wouldn’t notice. Division, reunification, the building boom of the 90’s and the gentrification and modernisation […]\n\nThe socialist history of Berlin\n\nThe Nikolaiviertel. A charming little haven in the center of Berlin. So quiet and yet seemingly out of place – surrounded by the iconic TV Tower, the socialist high rises […]\n\nThe last piece of the Palast der Republik\n\nBerlin is a city of change. Some for the better, some for the worse. Few time periods have left their mark on city as much as the years immediately after […]\n\nThe secret Lenin of Berlin\n\nThe year 2017 marked the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution in Russia, with which Lenin and his comrades toppled the Russian Empire and ushered in the reign of the […]\n\nFinding the last emblems of the German Democratic Republic in Berlin\n\nBerlin is a city that bears the scars of its history. Be it remnants of its imperial history, bullet scared facades (like the Bridge of Scars)or tragic memorials. While it […]\n\nExploring the Wasserturm in Prenzlauer Berg\n\nEvery Kiez in Berlin has one or two buildings which define the area – be it the Fernsehturm in Mitte, the Karstadt Building in Neukölln, The Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche in Charlottenburg or […]\n\nBerlin: Whats that white cotton stuff in the air?\n\nIts the same spectacle every year: Berlins streets are flooded with some weird cotton pollen just as the summer starts kicking in. When a light breeze brushes through the streets […]\n\nPrenzlauer Bergs Neon Music Tape\n\nRight at the border between Prenzlauer Berg and Friedrichshain, above the heads of the masses lies one of Prenzlauer Bergs more visible mysteries. Thousands of people have passed the intersection […]\n\nThe Cosmonaut of Potsdam\n\nPotsdams a nice place – but it’s just not quite as cool as its younger brother Berlin. Whatever Potsdam does it’s always seemingly second class to Berlin. Its got the […]\n\nThe Watchtowers of East Berlin\n\nWhen the DDR erected the „Antifaschistischer Schutzwall“ – aka the Berlin Wall in 1961, the 160 Kilometer long fortification was overlooked by 302 Watchtowers. The East German Watchtowers weren’t only used for […]\n\nThe Abandoned Chinese Embassy | The Republic of Pankow\n\n1973 was an important year for East Germany. After years of political turmoil, the DDR was finally accepted as a member state (the 133rd) to the UN. With this, the […]\n\nHonecker’s Window\n\nBerlin is not a city of skyscrapers – and it seems like most of the action happens underground. With German reunification, the city had wide-reaching plans to modernize the Alexanderplatz […]\n\nThe Kaninchenfeld – The Brass Rabbits of the Berlin Wall\n\nAt first glance there’s not much to see here aside from the usual Berliner Tristesse. A gas station, a busy road and a massive construction site. But on closer inspection […]\n\nWhats that Jingle on German Trains?\n\nIf you’ve ever taken the Deutsche Bahn Trains in Berlin, chances are you’ve at least once heard a synth organ blast out a strange Volksmusik tune. What the hell is […]\n\nThe Nazi Eagles of Berlin\n\nReichsadler. The word (unfairly) conjures up images of a Nazi Eagle and the Third Reich. Yet the Eagle as a symbol of Power has existed in the Germanic Realm for […]\n\nThe 8 Windmills of Berlin\n\nBerlin used to be swamped with Windmills. It might be hard to believe but by the year 1860, over 150 Windmills sprouted up in and around Berlin.
