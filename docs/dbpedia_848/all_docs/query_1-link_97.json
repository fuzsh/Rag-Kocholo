        "text": "Berlin is a city where points of interest can be far apart. The city’s history explains this geographical dispatch; it’s better to visit by this logic: the center, the east and the west.\n\nThe Mitte district: this is the central district that should be favoured for a short stay. You won’t have time to get bored between history and trendy places. There is the avenue Unter den Linden, the Brandenburg Gate, the Holocaust Mahnmal project, which is a memorial to the murdered Jews, the Reichstag building, the Museum Island with the Old and the New Museum, a forum; one also passes by the Bebelplatz (site of the auto-da-fé) where more than 20,000 “non-German” books were burned, and many other historical monuments to see.\n\nThe district of Friedrichshain mainly represents the east of Berlin. In addition to its large park of the same name, its museums or sculptures, you can see the large television tower of the city (you can climb it), the Alexander Square, a part of the Berlin Wall in East Side Gallery which artists have taken over or go there for its vibrant music scene. Symbols of former East Germany are still present, and Berliners have shown a remarkable ability to reshape their territory and move forward."
