        "text": "Brandenburg Gate is one of the most recognizable landmarks in Germany, so it’s a must-see attraction when you come to Berlin. This gorgeous old city gate has loads of history, is used for many events, and it’s quite photogenic. So what do you need to know for visiting Brandenburg Gate in Berlin?\n\nIn this post I’ll explain how to get to Brandenburger Tor (that’s the German name), tell you about its history, and share tips for seeing this important Berlin landmark.\n\nHistory and facts about Brandenburg Gate\n\nBrandenburg Gate was built between 1788-1791 in a Greek revival style, and it marked the western edge of the city. The Quadriga statue, which is a chariot being pulled by horses, was added to the top in 1793.\n\nBut what you see today wasn’t actually the first Brandenburg Gate built here. A more simple wooden gate was built in this location in 1734 and later replaced with this more ornate version.\n\nThe gate is is 26 meters tall, 65.5 meters long, and 11 meters deep. For the non-metric folks, that’s 85.3 feet tall, 214.9 feet long, and 36 feet deep.\n\nWhen Napoleon invaded Berlin in 1806, he had the French army take the Quadriga back to Paris as a sign of victory. Napoleon was forced to abdicate in 1814, and afterwards the Quadriga was returned to Berlin and placed back onto Brandenburg Gate.\n\nUnfortunately Brandenburg Gate suffered damage during World War II, and the Quadriga had to be removed. It was replaced by a replica during reconstruction in the 1950s.\n\n>>Read more fun facts about Berlin.\n\nDuring the Cold War when Berlin was divided, Brandenburg Gate was in the Soviet sector close to the border between East and West. As they built the Berlin Wall, Brandenburger Tor became inaccessible by both sides of the city.\n\nWhile this important landmark became a symbol of the city’s division during this time, it later came to represent Berlin’s reunification after the Wall came down.\n\nMore than 100,000 people celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall here when Brandenburg Gate was reopened in December 1989. Unfortunately these celebrations caused so much damage to the Quadriga statue that it once again had to be taken down and restored two years later.\n\n>>Read: 25+ Best Restaurants in Mitte Berlin: Cafes, Bars, German Food & More\n\nWhere is Brandenburg Gate?\n\nBrandenburg Gate is located on Pariser Platz, a pretty square east of the gate, in the Mitte district. It sits at the western end of Unter den Linden and just east of Tiergarten Park.\n\nSeveral stately buildings are here, including a few embassies like the USA and France. (Note: If you’re a US citizen and you happen to need embassy services while you’re in Berlin, they have two locations. Unfortunately this is not the one that will help you.)\n\nThere’s also a Brandenburg Gate in Potsdam, and it’s actually older than the one in Berlin. It was built in 1770-1771.\n\nEvents at Berlin Brandenburg Gate\n\nAside from being an important symbol and tourist attraction, Brandenburg Gate hosts events throughout the year. These include a massive New Year’s Eve celebration and live showings of major football (soccer) matches like the World Cup, and the Berlin Marathon route and Berlin Half Marathon run through the gate.\n\nSince there’s more space on the west side of the gate, often these events are held there. Streets are closed to cars during things like the New Year’s Eve celebration. Around one million people gather near Brandenburg Gate to ring in the New Year each year.\n\nIt’s also one of many buildings that participate in the Festival of Lights, and it’s a popular place for protests and demonstrations. Protests and demonstrations are usually peaceful, but if you’re visiting Brandenburg Gate during one, use caution.\n\n>>Read: 101 Fun and Essential Things to do in Berlin\n\nHow to visit Brandenburg Gate Berlin\n\nI often tell people to start their day at the East Side Gallery to avoid the crowds, which means you’d end up visiting Brandenburg Gate later in the day. But you can easily change the order of your Berlin itinerary and see the gate whenever makes sense for you.\n\nSunrise and sunset times are good for photos, but check the timing for when you’re visiting. Early the day is best for avoiding crowds, but that’s generally true of most attractions, so you have to choose which places are most important for you to see with fewer people.\n\nBrandenburg Gate is a popular place for photos and selfies, but you don’t really need a ton of time here. It’s a fantastic sight to see, but there’s not a lot to do after you’ve taken your pictures.\n\nThere are lots of other things to do near Brandenburger Tor, so it’s easy to continue exploring the city from here. I’ve listed some nearby attractions later in the post.\n\n>>Read: Guide to Visiting the Berlin TV Tower\n\nWhat to wear on your visit\n\nSince Brandenburger Tor is outdoors, and it’s likely only one stop on a big day of sightseeing, you’ll be on your feet a lot. Wear comfortable shoes, and dress for the weather at the time of year you’re visiting Berlin.\n\n>>Read: What to Wear & What to Pack for Berlin, Germany: Your Ultimate Berlin Packing List\n\nHow to get to Brandenburger Tor\n\nBrandenburg Gate is located at Pariser Platz, and it’s easy to reach on foot or by using public transport.\n\nIf you’re walking down Unter den Linden, you can get to Brandenburg Gate by walking west, away from Museum Island and towards Tiergarten. From Potsdamer Platz, walk north on Ebertstr with Tiergarten on your left and the Holocaust Memorial on your right.\n\nBrandenburger Tor has an S&U station by the same name, so you can get there from farther away. Take the Ubahn line U5 or Sbahn lines S1, S2, S25, or S26. Bus 100 also has a stop close to Brandenburg Gate.\n\nYou could also get to Brandenburg Gate on one of the hop on hop off buses in Berlin. These can be a good way to see a lot of Berlin’s highlights in a short amount of time.\n\nThings to know before you go\n\nBefore you visit Brandenburg Gate, here are a few more pieces of advice to help you enjoy one of the most popular places to see in Berlin.\n\nTips for the best pictures of Brandenburg Gate\n\nPictures of Brandenburg Gate are good whether you’re there in daylight hours or after dark. Evening photos can be quite interesting with the buildings all lit up.\n\nIf you can time your visit to Brandenburger Tor for around sunset time, you’ll be rewarded. Stand on the east side of the Gate and take your pictures facing west towards the Gate with Tiergarten on the other side of it.\n\nSince pictures are nicer when you’re standing in Pariser Platz looking west towards the gate, you should avoid coming here in the afternoon. The afternoon sun will be behind the gate and still too high for good pictures, so come in the morning or late afternoon/early evening.\n\nMake sure you know what time sunrise and sunset are when you’re visiting Berlin if this is important for your pictures. Sunrise and sunset times vary greatly from Berlin summer to Berlin winter.\n\nHow much does it cost to visit Brandenburger Tor?\n\nOften people ask what is the entrance price to visit Brandenburg Gate Berlin. Well, luckily the cost to visit is zero – it’s free!\n\nAnd it’s one of the most popular free things to do in Berlin.\n\nBrandenburg Gate Berlin opening hours\n\nBrandenburg Gate is outdoors with no barrier to entry, so you can visit any time day or night. I recommend getting there early in the day to avoid crowds, but people generally don’t hang around for too long, so you’ll be fine no matter when you arrive.\n\nThings to do near Brandenburg Gate Berlin\n\nWith so many other things to do near Brandenburg Gate, you’re spoiled for options. And besides the things I’ve listed below, you’ll have easy access to public transport, so you can get to another part of the city for sightseeing.\n\nTiergarten\n\nTiergarten is a huge inner-city park—the largest of its kind in Germany. Originally a hunting ground dating back to 1527, this vast green space has become one of the most loved public parks in Berlin over the years.\n\nThroughout the park there are statues, memorials, ponds, tree-lined thoroughfares, and lawns. When the weather’s warm in Berlin, it’s here that people flock for strolling, picnicking, and generally hanging out, making it a great spot to people-watch.\n\nTiergarten is located just west of Brandenburg Gate. Check out my full guide to Visiting Tiergarten Park in Berlin.\n\nVictory Column\n\nBerlin’s Victory Column, or Siegessäule in German, is one of the more recognizable monuments in the city. It sits at a roundabout in the middle of Tiergarten Park, and it was initially built as a monument to Prussia’s victory in the Franco-German war.\n\nThe column stands at 67 meters (about 220 feet) high and has an observation deck you can reach by paying a small entrance fee. After climbing the 285 stairs, the tower provides excellent views of the surrounding park and the city of Berlin.\n\nThis is one of the many wonderful inexpensive things you can do in Berlin.\n\nReichstag Building\n\nOpened in 1894, the Reichstag Building is a unique piece of architecture. It is also where the German parliament meets.\n\nYou can take a tour in the glass dome, where you can learn more about the history of Germany. This building also has a rooftop terrace and restaurant, which promises panoramic views of Berlin.\n\nTours into the glass dome are free, but advanced booking is required. The Reichstag Building is located a few minutes north of Brandenburg Gate.\n\nHolocaust Memorial\n\nThe Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe, often referred to as the Holocaust Memorial, honors the large number of Jewish people who died at the hands of the Nazis. It’s one of the most important World War II sites in Berlin, and it’s a few minutes south of Brandenburg Gate.\n\nThe memorial consists of 2,711 concrete blocks of varying heights, and the ground they sit on is an uneven slope similar to a wave. The information center showcases letters, diaries, photographs, and biographies of the victims to help personalize the experience.\n\nEntrance is free. Photography is allowed (no flash inside) but please be respectful.\n\nDo not sit on or climb on the cement slabs or take selfies. This is a place to reflect and remember those who were murdered.\n\nUnter den Linden\n\nUnter den Linden is the street that runs between Brandenburg Gate and Museum Island. It’s a lovely tree-lined street that’s great for a stroll as you check out some of Berlin’s top attractions.\n\nBe sure to stop by Bebelplatz, a gorgeous square next to the Berlin State Opera House. Here you can see the Nazi book burning memorial – look down and you’ll see empty shelves under the glass.\n\nCheck out our full guide to visiting Unter den Linden in Berlin.\n\nGendarmenmarkt\n\nGendarmenmarkt is one of the most beautiful squares in Berlin, and it’s about a 15 minute walk from Brandenburger Tor. This historic square is home to an impressive trio of buildings: the French Church, the German Church, and the Konzerthaus.\n\nSadly the square was badly damaged during World War II, but today it’s mostly been restored to its former glory. Gendarmenmarkt is a great place to wander; if you’re here over the holidays, you can visit one of the most popular Berlin Christmas markets here.\n\nNote: Gendarmenmarkt is currently undergoing extensive construction and is closed until late 2024/early 2025.\n\nTränenpalast\n\nThe Palace of Tears, or Tränenpalast in German, was constructed in 1962. It is located at Friedrichstraße train station and was used by the GDR (DDR in German) dictatorship as a border crossing between East and West Berlin.\n\nAt this location, guards forced many people to leave their families and friends in tears as they were denied any access to the border. Today, this free museum is used as a reminder of the great separation of Germany and all the tears that were shed in connection with it.\n\nIt’s one of the best Cold War attractions in Berlin. You can walk there from Brandenburg Gate in about 10 minutes, or it’s one stop on the Sbahn. Check out my full guide to visiting the Palace of Tears Museum.\n\nBrandenburg Gate FAQs\n\nHere are some frequently asked questions about visiting Brandenburger Tor in Berlin.\n\nWhat can you do at the Brandenburg Gate?\n\nBerlin Brandenburg Gate is an important monument, but there isn’t a lot to do here. Yes, it’s definitely worth seeing and taking some pictures of it, and you can read some of the placards with historical info about the gate and square, but you’re unlikely to be here for more than a few minutes.\n\nWhen was the Brandenburg Gate built?\n\nBrandenburger Tor was constructed from 1788-1791, which means today it is more than 230 years old.\n\nWhy was the Brandenburg Gate built?\n\nIn the 1700s, Berlin was a much smaller city than it is today. Brandenburg Gate was built at the western edge of Berlin and marked one of the entrances to the city.\n\nThe original gate was a simple wooden structure built in 1734, but it was replaced with a more ornate one in 1788-91. It was one of 14 city gates built to control the movement of goods and to levy taxes on goods coming into the city.\n\nHow tall/big is Brandenburg Gate?\n\nBrandenburger Tor is 85.3 feet tall, 214.9 feet long, and 36 feet deep. For those of you more familiar with metric measurements, that’s 26 meters tall, 65.5 meters long, and 11 meters deep.\n\nWhat is the statue on top of the Brandenburg Gate?\n\nThat distinct statue on top of Brandenburger Tor is the Quadriga statue. This is a chariot being pulled by horses, and it was added to the top in 1793, a few years after the gate was completed.\n\nWho built Brandenburg Gate?\n\nBrandenburger Tor was designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, and its design was inspired by the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens. The Quadriga statue was designed by Johann Gottfried Schadow and added a few years later.\n\nWas the Brandenburg Gate in East or West Berlin?\n\nWhen Berlin was divided, Brandenburger Tor was in the East, but only barely. The border ran just a few meters west of the gate.\n\nIs the Brandenburg Gate part of the Berlin Wall?\n\nNo, Brandenburger Tor is not part of the Berlin Wall. It is located very close to the former border between East and West Berlin, and when the Wall was built, the inner and outer walls went around the gate, isolating it from both sides.\n\nWhat is the name of the famous street that runs through the Brandenburg Gate?\n\nThe famous street that runs through Brandenburger Tor is Unter den Linden. It stretches from Brandenburg Gate to Museum Island.\n\nWhy is the Brandenburg Gate important?\n\nBrandenburg Gate holds a lot of historical significance since it was one of the entrances to the city. During the Cold War, it sat just east of the divide between East and West. And since it was blocked from both sides by the Berlin Wall, it came to symbolize the division between the two sides during that time period.\n\nBerlin Travel Resources"
