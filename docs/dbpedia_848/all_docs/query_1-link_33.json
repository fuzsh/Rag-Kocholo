        "text": "Berlin, Germany’s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its 18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The city's also known for its art scene and modern landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963. Here is our travel guide to Berlin, Germany.\n\nSTAY\n\nDAS STUE The architect Patricia Urquiola designed this hotel in the former Danish Embassy, near Tiergarten. The interior nods to the Berlin zoo, located outside the hotel. Drakestrasse 1, das-stue.com.\n\nSCHLOSSHOTEL BERLIN Built in 1914 in the style of a French palace, this magnificent villa has served as a private residence, embassy, naval officer’s club, and later, a luxury hotel, hosting such notable guests as Romy Schneider and Paul McCartney. In 2014, Berlin fashion designer Patrick Hellmann acquired the property and began renovations, restoring its glorious historical details while bringing much of the design—previously done by Karl Lagerfeld in the 1990s—firmly into the 21st century. The Kaiser Suite has an antique library with original frescoes, and the first-floor Karl Lagerfeld Suite has lovely Art Deco touches and a stone balcony overlooking the gardens.

In 2014, Sattler Architects and Dietmar Mueller-Elmau turned the space into a hotel with a restaurant, literary salon, bar, and concert stage.

Don’t come for the checkpoint itself (the current structure is a replica of the actual checkpoint) but for the museum, Mauermuseum Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie. Though tiny, it’s an excellent historical refresher covering everything from the pre-wall era up to present day. Friedrichstraße 43-45; berlin.de/sehenswuerdigkeiten\n\nKUNSTHAUS DAHLEM This new space in Berlin for post-war German modernism sparks interest mainly for the building’s checkered past—before WWII it was constructed as a studio for one of the Nazi party’s predilect artists, Arno Breker. Under the watchful eye of architects Petra and Paul Kahlfeldt, who are charged with its restoration, the studio has been re-cast as a cultural institution.
