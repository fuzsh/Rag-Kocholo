        "text": "Jul/Aug 2024\n\n100 Windows Catalogue, DCV\n\nCover: Installation view of \"Open Source\" (2017) by Menno Aden\n\nBook Launch #1: 4 July 2024, 6 — 9 PM\n\nHenselmann Tower, Straußberger Platz 1, Berlin\n\nBook Launch #2: 6 Aug 2024, 6 — 9 PM\n\nSoho House, Torstr. 1, Berlin\n\nArt showcase Berlin-Weekly - A window to the world\n\nby Jens Hinrichsen for monopol-magazine\n\nThe non-commercial art space sets itself apart from the usual function of a shop window as a seductive display of goods, but some contributions certainly take up the obvious association - such as the installation \"Open Source\" by photo artist Menno Aden, shown on the cover, who photographs rooms from above and placed the room-filling print of his top shot of a kiosk in Prenzlauer Berg in the shop window in July 2017.\n\nTo extend the image into the room, Aden placed drinks crates, waving cats and a flashing \"Open\" display in front of the photo wallpaper. The 90-degree tilted top view of the laminate floor of a \"Späti\" and its display creates an exciting irritation. At the book launch, Aden explained that he wanted to pay homage to the vanished kiosks on Linienstrasse and Auguststrasse with the underlying photo series. \"This is where Berlin's gentrification has hit hardest,\" says the photographer.\n\nThe Berlin artist Menno Aden analytically deals with our environment in various photo series. Although mostly absent, his images always show traces of man. Aden's soberly detached gaze is that of a tracker, topographically mapping his environment through unusual use of technology and perspective.\n\nThe exhibition \"Between the Lines\" shows works from Aden's series \"Assembly Lines\", \"Composition\" and \"Tracks and Fields\". Despite conceptual differences, aesthetic parallels can be found in them, literally: by layering the bench, platform edge, and tile wall of a subway station, by using an industrial \"line-scan camera\" to record the movement of a robotic arm, by looking down on a gymnasium in which a grid of neon tubes rhythmizes the picture plane. Parallel structures, patterns, and systems of order that permeate and structure our everyday life can be found everywhere.\n\nMay 2021\n\nsomeother mag: I See You (press release)\n\nThe someother mag issue I SEE YOU investigates the diverse forms in which surveillance transpires around us in the physical and virtual dimension. It is an examination of how the built envrironment absorbs transformations of the individual and the collective by looking at new paradigms of transparency. It expores the interrelation between the digital forms of surveillance and architectural space while unravelling the nature of this monitoring and delving into its relevance and influence on current events. https://someothermag.com\n\nYAK SHAVING is an art exhibition only possible in an online digital format due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe title of the exhibition \"YAK SHAVING\" describes an exercise in futility created by the pandemic restrictions. While art viewing is an activity relying on the full use of human senses, this total mental, emotional and physical experience is currently reduced to the screen by the overall closure of cultural and art-business institutions.\n\nStill, personal initiative persists in creating meaning under the given conditions and is the best line of defence!\n\nWhat is YAK SHAVING?\n\n1. Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing to overcome intermediate difficulties, solves the problem at large.\n\n2. A somewhat useful activity performed consciously or subconsciously in order to procrastinate about a larger more useful task.\n\nFurthermore:\n\nThe exhibition views will be shown in a slide show format at www.emergingartist.de.\n\nThe project is initiated by the Berlin artist Lukasz Furs\n\n\"To understand a work of art means to buy it,\" Arnulf Rainer is said to have said once. Rainer's statement applies all the more in times of the corona pandemic, which is hitting many cultural workers particularly hard. With a large team from the Berlin art scene, we have therefore created the Direct Auction, 70 percent of the proceeds of which will go back to the participating artists. At the end of November, more than 400 works by over 300 artists*, most of whom live and work in Berlin, will be auctioned off. On November 28 between 3 and 6 pm two of my works will also be auctioned.\n\nThe previews of the works will take place at the following galleries:\n\nLot 404: 23. — 28. Nov (15 — 18 Uhr) Galerie Selected Artists, Weydemeyerstraße 2, 10178 Berlin\n\nLot 339: 24. November (10 — 22 Uhr) Galerie Colonia Nova, Thiemannstrasse 1, 12059 Berlin\n\n27 Sep — 3 Oct 2020\n\nAssembly Lines (solo exhibition)\n\nI am pleased to invite you to my upcoming exhibition at LAGE EGAL in which I show works from my new series Assembly Lines. At the same time, the gallery shows works by Ties Ten Bosch, Marcel Broodthaers, Richard Hamilton, Michael Riedel (Sammlung Hückstedt) and Andrea Tappert.\n\nOpening Reception: Sun 27 Sep 4 — 7 pm\n\n13 Sep — 3 Oct, 3 — 6 pm and by appointment\n\nEntry only with mask. Please respect and follow the hygienic measures.\n\nLAGE EGAL\n\nGreifswalder Str. 34\n\n10405 Berlin\n\nAssembly Lines\n\nIn his current series \"Assembly Lines\", Menno Aden records movements of industrial robots of fully automated production lines with the help of a line scan camera. A line scan camera is an industrial camera that works like a fixed scanner that scans only one image line. Line scan cameras are used in high speed assembly lines for quality control or for sorting processes where their image data are read out by machine. Aden makes these image data visible. What can be seen are the repetitive motion sequences of machines that mean both help and competition for mankind and that have become a symbol for the changes in our working world in recent years. They show us the \"Outdatedness of Human Beings\", as the cultural philosopher Günther Anders recognized as early as the 1950s.\n\nIn his current series \"Assembly Lines\", Menno Aden records movements of industrial robots of fully automated production lines with the help of a line scan camera.

With these words he simply stretched out his right arm, and at that moment all the roofs disappeared. Now the student saw the inside of the houses (...) as if at bright midday. The sight was too new for him not to claim all his attention. He let his eyes wander in all directions, and the colorful variety of objects that surrounded him kept his curiosity busy for a long time.\"\n\nAlain-René Lesage: The Lame Devil (Le Diable Boiteux), 1707\n\nDear partners, friends and colleagues, On the occasion of the ART WEEK BERLIN I would like to invite you to the group exhibition DOMIZIL, curated by Stefanie Seidl and Andrea van Reimersdahl.\n\nArtists: Menno Aden, Alexandra Baumgartner, Astrid Busch, Alanna Lawley, Jenny Keuter, Bettina Khano, Virginie Mossé, Andrea Pichl, Katja Pudor, Andrea van Reimersdahl, Wieland Schönfleder, Stefanie Seidl, Alice Stepanek, Sinta Werner\n\nThe Berlin-based artist Menno Aden specialises in the representation of spaces and perspectives. People almost never appear in his photographic work, which instead often focuses on what people have left behind. By depicting man-made order systems as well as their disorder, Aden's work is also an indirect portrait of humans.\n\nFor Berlin-Weekly, Aden shows an installation with a Berlin 'Spätkauf' (a 24/7 corner-shop) from a birds eye perspective. As if the ceiling was removed one can look into a box crammed with consumer goods. Aden literally turns the Berlin institution 'Späti' on it's head, and leaves the visitor irritated - not least because of the untypical opening of a 'Späti' in the gentrified posh Linienstraße.\n\nOpening Reception: Thu 22 Jun 2017, 7 pm\n\nInstallation from 23 Jun to 22 Jul 2017\n\nBerlin-Weekly\n\nLinienstrasse 160\n\n10115 Berlin\n\nMy permanent installation 'Over Head' at the former US-Headquarter in Berlin-Dahlem is now completely installed with the large format work 'Untitled (Over Head 20)' and two backlighted photographs that are recessed into the ceiling. Both works show the former condition of the ceiling true to scale.\n\nFind more images of my series on the art blog IGNANT\n\nFor his series 'Over Head' Aden photographed ceilings of the former U.S. Headquarter offices in Berlin-Dahlem. Aden captures a moment of this orphaned building's turbulent history during the Cold War – the time of transition up to its current reconstruction. Preserved by photography, this moment is carried into the present. Here are the observations of a pathfinder who scans the building for material remains of its now faded, historically significant function.\n\nAden does not address obvious traces that are omnipresent at a site like this. It is the inaccessible parts that interest him, the unconscious leftovers such as the pipe system and powerlines behind the ceilings, a web of veins that pervades the whole building and become readable only through the precise capture of the camera lens.\n\nMenno Aden's digital editing and juxtapositioning of individual works carry a rhythmic playfulness from which emerges a particularly sensible and graphic aesthetics.\n\nI'm glad to participate with my series Panel Flats at the group show Berlin Raum Radar during Gallery Weekend Berlin. The show presents a selection of 30 artists and has been curated by Nadine Barth. I'd be happy to see you at the opening.\n\nBerlin Raum Radar is one of VOGUE’s Top 10 Highlights of Gallery Weekend Berlin 2016.\n\nOpening Reception: 29 April 2016, 5 – 9 pm\n\nNEUE WEST, Potsdamer Str. 91, 10785 Berlin\n\nMenno Aden, Iwan Baan, Sibylle Bergemann, Peter Bialobrzeski, Ben de Biel, Tacita Dean, Mitch Epstein, Christine Fenzl, Andreas Gehrke, Alexander Gnädinger, Markus Henttonen, Ola Kohlemainen, Stefan Koppelkamm, Dawin Meckel, Arwed Messmer, Ingo Mittelstaedt, Andreas Mühe, Robert Polidori, Blaise Reutersward, Yoram Roth, Pola Sieverding, Sarah Schönfeld, Michael Schulz, Dorothea Tuch, Friederike von Rauch, Julia Wagner, Michael Wesely, Ulrich Wüst, Harf Zimmermann\n\nIn context to the show a book will be published by Hatje Cantz:\n\nBerlin Raum Radar - New Architecture Photography\n\nHatje Cantz\n\nGerman and English, May 2016, hardcover\n\nISBN 978-3-7757-4179-8"
