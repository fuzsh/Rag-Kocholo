        "text": "Camping Berlin – Do you want to take a relaxing break from everyday life and get away from the daily stress? Do you like idyllic nature, charming city trips and exciting adventures? Then it doesn’t even have to go that far. The beautiful city of Berlin combines everything and is therefore the perfect place to take everything with you that a holiday has to offer! Whether cultural sights, popular districts, delicious food or picturesque nature – the German capital has much more to offer than a fascinating city center. Did you know that Berlin has numerous campsites in the middle and on the outskirts of the city? With a camper , Roof tent or Folding caravan / tent trailer a city trip to the popular city becomes an adventure on which you don’t have to make any compromises. If you are interested in a nature vacation in a metropolis, then I have summarized everything you need to know about a vacation in Berlin.\n\nBerlin: Metropolis invites you to camp!\n\nEvery year millions of tourists from all over the world travel to get an insight into the unique city of Berlin. Whether it’s a wild nightlife, a unique city center or individual districts with their own charm – Berlin is always suitable for a short weekend trip or even a whole week. It is guaranteed not to be boring due to the multitude of exciting sights, delicious food, shopping and historical highlights that Berlin has to offer! As the capital, it not only stands for international tourists, but also for major concerts and events. There is the Berlin Fashion Week, but also world-famous photo spots such as the East Side Gallery, which is why you can always find artists from all over the world as well as actors here.\n\nNature vacation in the capital of Germany\n\nAt first glance, Berlin does not appear to be the right place to camp, as you tend to think of natural, quiet places, but the cultural city is still extremely suitable for this. Berlin and the surrounding area have very natural places in nature, wide lakes, idyllic landscapes and the perfect campsites that are optimally tailored to you. A campfire in the open air, a picturesque sunset and brightly shining starry sky in the evening on the one hand and fascinating city life in the daytime on the other. Berlin convinces with the perfect mix of both!\n\nBerlin offers you:\n\nCharming districts\n\nCultural highlights\n\nExciting sights\n\nDelicious meal\n\nShopping\n\nPopular photo spots\n\nIdyllic nature away from the hustle and bustle\n\nVideo! Berlin from above\n\nHere you have a sightseeing flight over the beautiful city of Berlin from above to get a direct overview of all the top spots and well-known highlights that the cosmopolitan city has to offer:\n\nBerlin: city map and location\n\nWith around 3.7 million inhabitants, the German capital Berlin is the most populous and at the same time the largest municipality in the Federal Republic of Germany. The metropolis can be easily reached from anywhere by car or train.\n\nBucket list: 5 tips + 1 insider tip!\n\nWhat should I do in Berlin? What are the top spots and the best contact points? If you are looking for a vacation in Berlin, the following points should be on your bucket list:\n\nSightseeing: Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz, Reichstag etc.\n\nSurrounding districts: Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg, Neukölln\n\nTry traditional food\n\nShopping\n\nInsider tip: East Side Gallery as a photo spot!\n\nBerlin’s top spots: highlights, attractions & sights\n\nThe multifaceted city of Berlin convinces with everything your heart desires. From sightseeing in the hustle and bustle, delicious food and walks in nature, to historical input and shopping in the most luxurious shops. From the KaDeWe to the Mall Of Berlin – there is luxury and souvenirs on every corner. But besides the well-known places Berlin has a lot more to offer. Here I picked out the less well-known highlights and attractions in Berlin, which are definitely worth a visit.\n\nEast Side Gallery: Unique art & popular photo spot\n\nIf you are interested in art, the popular East Side Gallery is definitely recommended. With a wide range of art and history, it convinces numerous tourists every year. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, 118 artists from 21 countries painted the East Side Gallery, and Dimitrji Vrubel’s famous brotherly kiss is still the most famous painting on the wall today. This motif is the symbol on a number of postcards and souvenirs and is a sign and symbol of Berlin’s history. A visit to the East Side Gallery is worthwhile just to marvel at this work and use it as a photo spot.\n\nThe highlights of the East Side Gallery:\n\nRange of art and history\n\nWell-known painting: Brother’s kiss as a symbol\n\nPopular photo spot\n\nHistory & Culture: Historical sightseeing\n\nWhen you come to Berlin, the first thing you think of is the lively Berlin Mitte! You can expect crowds and hustle and bustle, because this is where the main train station is located and most of the routes from the airports also lead here. In Berlin Mitte you can stroll through the streets like in any international metropolis. But not only that awaits you. Berlin is also a top spot for art, culture and history.\n\nDistricts: Prenzlauer Platz, Neukölln & Co.\n\nIf real Berlin life appeals to you, then you should pay a visit to the surrounding districts. A must see for all those interested in culture is definitely Prenzlauer Platz. This district shines with its very own charm and offers a good opportunity to relax and enjoy the day. In addition, you should take a look at the neighboring Friedrichshain, as well as Kreuzberg and Neukölln, stroll through the attractive streets and look for a cozy place to internalize the Berlin life.\n\nHistorical input at Checkpoint Charlie\n\nBut Berlin also has a lot to offer in terms of history and architecture. At places such as Checkpoint Charlie, which at the time served as a border crossing from West to East Berlin, you can familiarize yourself with Berlin’s history and take with you some useful information that you may not have known until now. It represents the Cold War and is the scene of the tank confrontation.\n\nReichstag & Brandenburg Gate\n\nIn addition, the famous Reichstag building and the Brandenburg Gate should not be missing on your visit to Berlin. The trip here is definitely worth it just because of the impressive view from the glass dome. From there you can expect a wonderful view of the whole of Berlin and a picturesque panorama of the many highlights. The Brandenburg Gate catches the eye from above. With its imposing height of 26 meters, the 200-year-old building is more than just a sight. It is the symbol of the city and the symbol of reunification.\n\nFood: The traditional Berlin currywurst\n\nOf course, your stomach shouldn’t be neglected on a trip to Berlin! Even if the food in Berlin takes a bit of getting used to at first glance, it is still convincing across the board. The highlight of Berlin cuisine is definitely the currywurst and should definitely be tried when you visit here. No other topic stimulates discussions between West and East as much as the question of the invention of the currywurst.\n\nAccording to Uwe Timm’s novella “The Discovery of Currywurst”, a fictional person served Hamburg the first currywurst in 1947 while the Berliners insist that Herta Heuwer offered a fried boiled sausage with a sauce made of tomato paste, curry powder, Worcestershire sauce and other ingredients at her snack stand in 1949 . Either way, the currywurst is and will remain a specialty in Berlin and you will come across it on every corner there. So convince yourself and enjoy the delicious Berlin sausage!\n\nCurrywurst Museum Berlin\n\nFor those who still haven’t had enough of the delicious currywurst, a trip to the currywurst museum is a good idea. Here you can find out everything about the currywurst and try one of these specialties at the same time.\n\n3.8 stars / 826 ratings\n\nAddress: Schützenstraße 70, 10117 Berlin\n\nPhone: +49 (30) 88 71 86 47\n\nCamping holidays in Berlin: nature & freedom\n\nEspecially if you are only coming to Berlin for a few days or a weekend trip, it is a good idea to go camping. During the day you can enjoy the full program of Berlin life and in the evening you are still quiet and natural and can relax and enjoy the time with your loved ones.

Before that it was a little more complicated as Berlin was the capital for a long time before the division of Germany. In 1999 the parliament and the government moved from Bonn to Berlin.\n\nWhy is the city called Berlin?\n\nLike many typical names from East Germany, Berlin has its origins in the Slavic language, more precisely in Old Polish: The place in the swamp. Accordingly, the name Berlin is made up of the word “brl” for swamp or morass and the typical ending “in” for place names. So Berlin is the place in the swamp, according to its name.\n\nHow many districts are there in Berlin?\n\nThe current administrative structure of Berlin has existed since January 1, 2001, when Berlin was divided into twelve districts through an administrative reform, which have the function of administrative districts and form the lower part of the two-tier public administration.\n\nWhat are dangerous corners in Berlin?\n\nThe police currently classify nine locations as prone to crime: Alexanderplatz, Leopoldplatz, Schöneberg-Nord (in the area of Nollendorfplatz and parts of the Regenbogenkiez), Görlitzer Park, Warschauer Brücke, Kottbusser Tor (see below), parts of Hermannstraße, Hermannplatz and a small area of the Riga Street.\n\nWhat was Berlin called earlier?\n\nOne of the two, with the name Cölln, was first mentioned in a document in 1237; this year is considered to be the founding year of the city. The other settlement gave the city its name in the long term: Berlin. First documented entry: 1244.\n\nWhen was the city of Berlin founded?\n\nThe foundation of the city of Berlin- In 1237 Cölln was founded on the Spree. 7 years later, on January 26, 1244, Berlin was first mentioned in a document. In 1307 these two cities are united; The date of Berlin’s founding is therefore October 28, 1237.\n\nWhat are the two rivers in Berlin called?\n\nThere are also some rivers in Berlin. The most famous river is probably the Spree, which flows through the center of Berlin. But also the Havel with the Pfaueninsel and the Dahme can certainly be classified as Berlin rivers.\n\nWhy was Berlin separated?\n\nFrom then on Berlin was divided into East Berlin and West Berlin, because many citizens in the GDR were dissatisfied with the way of government they wanted to move to West Germany. In order to prevent them from doing so, the politicians of the GDR decided to build the Berlin Wall from 1961 onwards."
