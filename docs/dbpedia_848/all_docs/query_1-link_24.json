        "text": "This is the former location of one of the largest synagogues in Berlin. In 1941, the Gestapo forced the Jewish community to convert this synagogue into a collection point for deportations. From here, more than 37,500 Jews living in Berlin were deported to the extermination camps listed on the memorial. These transports departed from the Grunewald and Putlitzstrasse train stations. The memorial on this spot tells the fate of 34 synagogues once located in Berlin. Each synagogue is represented by a metal plaque with facts about the building and seating capacity. Synagoge at 4 Heidereutergasse Synagoge at 16 Rosenstrasse Synagoge at 30 Oranienburgerstrasse Synagoge at 26 Schöneberger Ufer Synagoge at 29 Kaiserstrasse Synagoge at 25 Bischofstrasse Synagoge at 86 Prinzenstrasse Synagoge at 7 Schulstrasse Synagoge at 48-50 Lindenstrasse Synagoge at 7-8 Franzensbader Street Lippmann-Tauss Synagoge on Gollnow Street Synagoge at 12 Lindenufer Synagoge at 41 Düppelstrasse Synagoge at 16 Lüzovstrasse Synagoge at 38 Brunnenstrasse Synagoge at 36 Grenadierstrasse Synagoge at 10 Kleine Auguststrasse Synagoge at 31 Artilleriestrasse Synagoge at 53 Rykestrasse Synagoge at 111 Lützowstrasse Synagoge at 2 Passauer Street Synagoge at 127 Dresdener Street Flensburger Synagoge at 19 Lessingstr.

This is the former location of one of the largest synagogues in Berlin. In 1941, the Gestapo forced the Jewish community to convert this synagogue into a collection point for deportations. From here, more than 37,500 Jews living in Berlin were deported to the extermination camps listed on the memorial. These transports departed from the Grunewald and Putlitzstrasse train stations.\n\nAn additional 14,797 Jews were deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp from a second collection point located on Grosse Hamburg Street at the former Jewish home for the elderly. This group departed from the Anhalter train station in 117 separate transports between June 6, 1942 and March 27, 1945.\n\nDuring the pogrom of November 9, 1938 (often referred to as \"Kristallnacht\"), Jewish places of worship in Berlin were damaged, burned, or destroyed. Because these synagogues were the symbols of a rich Jewish cultural history during the Prussian era, they were the foremost targets of Nazi-sponsored terror.\n\nIn addition to the public synagogues listed here, Berlin was home to 80 private prayer halls that were part of Jewish social organizations. These were also targets of the November ninth pogrom. Jewish places of worship surviving the pogrom were soon closed, sold, or confiscated by the Nazi regime.\n\nSynagoge at 11 Siegmundshof"
