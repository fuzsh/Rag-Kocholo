        "text": "The name ‘Mitte’ literally translated means middle, and this first borough of Berlin is considered the heart of the city. It is cosmopolitan and lively with plenty to do and see within walking distance. Most of the much-visited sites are in this area, as are the top hotels, designer shops, finest restaurants and busiest streets.\n\nThe best known attractions in Mitte include the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, Museum Island, The Holocaust Memorial and the Reichstag Building. They are reminders of Berlin’s chequered past, and the division between East and West Germany.\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate is an iconic symbol of the city. This 18th century monument once stood in no man’s land between divided Germany. It’s a stunning sight during the day and beautifully lit at night and offers one of the best places to sit and people watch. Nearby, Checkpoint Charlie was once the gateway between the two parts of Berlin. Although flooded with tourists nowadays, it is still an emotional site that must be seen. Museum Island is extremely popular. It is home to five different museums that display artefacts from a range of historical periods. There is also an art gallery there. The Reichstag Building is a neo-Renaissance structure with a stunning glass dome that is a city landmark. This is the Parliament building, with the dome open to the public to enter. The Holocaust Memorial is a sombre and moving 5-acre area with carefully positioned concrete blocks.\n\nMitte has a wide range of cafes, bars and restaurants, many of which offer outdoor seating in the warmer months. The area is also home to Friedrichstadt-Palast where a vivid and exciting top show attracts visitors all year around. When it comes to shopping, this district has high-end places, boutique shops, flagship stores and souvenir kiosks.\n\nBest Value Hotels in Berlin City Centre – Mitte Neighbourhood\n\nHotel Adlon Kempinski Berlin – Luxury\n\nPullman Berlin Schweizerhof – Luxury\n\nNH Collection Berlin Mitte Friedrichstrasse – Great Value\n\nMercure Hotel & Residenz Berlin Checkpoint Charlie – Great Value\n\nAn arty part of west Berlin, Kreuzberg was surrounded on three sides by the wall, but has become an alternative and cool neighbourhood in recent years. The best reason for visiting this borough is see the East Side Gallery in Mühlenstrase. With more than 100 pieces of work painted on remnants of the Berlin Wall, this is the longest gallery in the world and a memorial to the end of division. Aufbau Haus, at Moritzplatz, is worth a visit. This old factory is now a cultural centre with a gallery and trendy café. Tempelhofer Freiheit Park is an open space created on an old airfield. Great for picnics, sitting in the sun or whizzing along the runway on a Segway. Come nightfall, this Kreuzberg gets lively with lots of hip eateries serving international dishes and bars that spill onto the streets.\n\nBest Hotels in Kreuzberg District\n\nOrania.Berlin – Luxury\n\nMövenpick Hotel Berlin Am Potsdamer Platz – Great Value\n\nGrimm’s Hotel am Potsdamer Platz – Affordable / Good Value\n\nThis borough is part of the western area of Berlin. It is an affluent, high end area that was originally a town outside of the city but became a borough in 1920. The best-loved attraction in this area is Charlottenburg Palace, built in the 17th century it has a lavishly decorated interior. On display are Prussian crown jewels and other interesting treasures. There is also a splendid park and a museum too beside the palace. Many of the best hotels in the area are close to the famous shopping street of Kurfürstendamm. This boulevard is one of the finest in Berlin and has top designer stores and international brands of every kind. Along with the shops, there is a huge variety of great places to eat and drink in style.\n\nCharlottenburg is home to the Olympic stadium that was built in 1936. Today it is the venue for international football matches and is the largest stadium in Germany. The Europa Centre is located in this borough – it is a top exhibition hall and entertainment centre with a theatre and choice of eateries. If art is your thing, the Scarf-Gerstenberg gallery displays a fine selection of work from French Romanticism to Surrealists.\n\nFinest Accommodation in Charlottenburg District\n\nHotel am Steinplatz, Autograph Collection – Luxury\n\n25hours Hotel Bikini Berlin – Top Rated\n\nLouisa’s Place – Luxury"
