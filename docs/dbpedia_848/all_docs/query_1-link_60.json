        "text": "What was once a symbol of Cold war division is now an urban megalopolis. Berlin, Germany’s capital, is the European Union’s most populous city with 3.7 million inhabitants.\n\nSince the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of East and West, the city has grown into a thriving city full of people, high-tech industry, universities, nightclubs and many more. Plenty of historical and modern landmarks, cultural events and festivals, world-renowned museums and shopping locations attract millions of visitors each year.\n\nFor all these reasons, Berlin is now the third most visited city in Europe, after London and Paris.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know to plan your perfect vacation in Berlin.\n\nGetting to Berlin\n\nBeing the capital of Germany and due to its important geographical position, Berlin is well-connected with major cities from all over the world. As we mentioned, plenty of tourists come each year to visit the city with various transportation options.\n\nBelow we will give a short overview of popular ways for reaching Berlin.\n\nBy plane\n\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport (BER) is a brand new international airport serving Berlin and Brandenburg state in Germany. The airport opened in 2020 and replaced the Tempelhof, Schönefeld, and Tegel airports which were getting old.\n\nWith a capacity of 46 million passengers per year, BER is set to become one of Europe’s busiest airports.\n\nYou can fly to BER from more than 150 destinations throughout the world, with 56 different airlines. Berlin is a focus city for a few low-cost airlines, such as RyanAir, EasyJet and Eurowings, which means that travelling to Berlin by plane is cheap and easy.\n\nBy bus\n\nReaching Berlin by bus is relatively effortless as Berlin is one of the most well-connected cities in Europe. You can find bus routes to Berlin from practically every major European city.\n\nBerlin Central Bus Station, known as ZOB, is located in western Berlin, near the Berlin Radio Tower. Besides ZOB, there are plenty of other bus stops around the city such as Ostbahnhof, Alexanderplatz and Wannsee.\n\nPopular bus routes from Berlin:\n\nBy train\n\nUsing rails is another convenient way to reach Berlin, especially if you are coming from western Europe. Germany and its neighbouring countries are well-connected by high-end trains. Trains in Europe are usually quite fast and comfortable, have plenty of legroom, free WiFi and sockets at all seats. Taking a train is also the most environmentally friendly way of reaching Germany’s capital, so consider this option if you want to protect nature.\n\nBerlin’s Central Train Station, Hauptbahnhof is located in the heart of Berlin in the Moabit district. Many other train stations such as Alexanderplatz, Spandau and Ostbahnhof can be found around the city.\n\nBy car\n\nDriving by yourself is neither the fastest nor the cheapest way to reach Berlin. However, if you decide to come by car you will have no problem with reaching Berlin as Germany’s highways are excellent.\n\nKeep in mind that Berlin’s city centre is an environmental zone and you will need a special environmental badge to drive around. You can purchase the environmental badge at the vehicle testing centres or online for 6 EUR.\n\nGetting around Berlin\n\nBerlin is a huge metropolitan city with well-developed roads and public transportation infrastructure. Berliners proudly claim that no matter where you are, you can reach every part of the city in 45 minutes, and they are usually right.\n\nIf you plan on using public transportation, you should know that U-Bahn, S-Bahn, buses and trams are all part of the same network. This means that the tickets you purchase for one of them are valid for all. When it comes to the ticket price it depends on tariff zones and the duration of the ticket’s validity.\n\nBerlin is divided into three tariff zones: AB, BC and ABC, with AB including Berlin’s urban centre, while ABC also includes surrounding areas such as Postdam and Brandenburg airport. Ticket options include single journey tickets, short-distance tickets, single-day tickets, and 7-day tickets. Make sure to validate your ticket at the entrance because if you don’t penalties are quite high.\n\nBelow we will give an overview of all of the common ways of moving around Berlin.\n\nU- Bahn\n\nThe famous U-Bahn is the city’s subway system and one of the most popular transportation options for both tourists and locals. It is one of the most well-developed subway systems in the world, renowned for its efficiency and accessibility. U-Bahn network consists of 10 lines that run both underground and aboveground while effectively connecting every part of the city.\n\nDuring the week, U-Bahn works from 4 am to 1 am, while during the weekend U-Bahn lines run all day and night. Trains are also quite frequent, they run every 3-5 minutes during the peak hours, every 10 minutes during the rest of the day, and every 15 minutes during the night.\n\nS- Bahn\n\nThe main difference between the U-Bahn and S-Bahn is that S-Bahn is less frequent and has fewer stops, but covers longer distances faster than the U-Bahn.\n\nFor this reason, U-Bahn is the preferred choice in the city centre, while S-Bahn is the best option for reaching the city’s periphery and outskirts.\n\nTrams\n\nThere are more than 20 tram lines in Berlin. As a consequence of division during the cold war, the trams mostly serve East Berlin where the subway system is not as developed as it is in West Berlin.\n\nFor visitors, the tram line M10 is particularly interesting. Close to the last station of M10 stands the longest remaining section of the Berlin Wall, nowadays known as the East Side Gallery.\n\nBus\n\nIn Berlin, where U-Bahn and trams don’t go, buses do. The Bus network of Berlin is extensive and with more than 300 lines it covers even the most remote areas of the city. Interestingly. Berlin’s bus network is the oldest one in Germany, dating back to the 19th century and horse carried buses.\n\nFor tourists, the lines to remember are double-decker buses 100 and 200. These hop-on/hop-off sightseeing buses are a great and inexpensive way to reach the city’s most important attractions such as Alexanderplatz, Museum Island, Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag.\n\nTaxis & ridesharing\n\nWhile most locals prefer to use public transport, taxis are readily available. Taxis in Berlin have yellowish “TAXI” roof signs and can be easily hailed around the city. The base fare is €3.90, with €2 per km for the first 7km, and €1.50 for every kilometre after that.\n\nOne thing to have in mind is “Kurzstrecke”, or the short distance taxi ride within a 2 km radius. For Kurzstrecke you will pay €5 no matter where you are, but you have to make it clear you want Kurzstrecke when entering a cab.\n\nRidesharing apps such as Uber and Bolt are also available around the city and are usually slightly cheaper than taxis.\n\nBikes\n\nAs in most of western Europe, bikes are among the most popular transportation options in Berlin. With over 600 km of cycling paths, it’s no surprise that many locals use bikes to commute to work.\n\nFor tourists, renting a bike in Berlin is a great way to explore the city leisurely. Often times renting a bike is possible at hostels and hotels, but the most common way is through bike-sharing apps such as NextBike and Lime.\n\nSights\n\nBeing such a large and historically important city, Berlin has many worthwhile attractions, but some of them stand out from the crowd. For this reason, we will write an introduction to Berlin’s top tourist attractions. If you have a limited time in Berlin, perhaps our 24 hours guide can help you in planning.\n\nOne thing we recommend if you want to have the best experience while sightseeing in Berlin Welcome Card. With Berlin Welcome Card, you can save time and money. The card gives you free public transport, discounts on numerous attractions and a free city guidebook, which includes a map of Berlin. The price of the Berlin Welcome Card starts from €24 but depends on the duration of validity and Berlin public transport tariff zones.\n\nBerlin Wall\n\nWe will start the list with the Berlin Wall, the symbol of the Cold war and Berlin. Everyone who comes to Berlin should take some time and explore the remains of a wall that divided not only Berlin but the whole world in two.\n\nFirst built in 1961, and expanded later on, to prevent people from fleeing East Berlin. The wall quickly became the symbol of a Cold War and for 28 years it separated friends and family members from seeing each other.\n\nBerlin Wall fell in 1989 and since then most of it has been torn down, however, some parts still remain as a reminder of the past.\n\nWhere to see Berlin Wall remains?\n\nThe longest stretch of the wall still standing today is now an open-air art gallery. Eastside gallery, as it is called, is a 1.3km long stretch of wall covered in more than 100 graffiti from artists of various nationalities.\n\nYou can find The Berlin Wall Memorial on Bernauer Straße close to the city centre. Bernauer Straße became famous in 1961 because of the pictures of people jumping out of their windows to escape the communist regime. This is the only part of the wall fully preserved, with a border strip and watchtower from the 1980s.\n\nIf you are interested in the history of the wall and its consequences on the people of Berlin, you should visit Checkpoint Charlie Museum. The museum is filled with photographs and exhibitions about fascinating stories of people who escaped, or tried to escape across the wall.\n\nBrandenburg gate\n\nThe most iconic building in Berlin has to be the famous Brandenburg gate. This 26-meters high gate was built between 1788 and 1791, designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, and inspired by the gateway at the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens. In 1975, a signature chariot drawn by four horses called Quadriga was added to the top of the gate.\n\nThis monument was a site of major historical events such as Nazi and Napoleon parades, but today it stands as a symbol of European unity and peace.\n\nIt is located in the Mitte district in the city centre, only a block away from Reichstag.\n\nReichstag\n\nAnother monumental landmark of Berlin is the house of the German parliament, better known as the Reichstag. The building was constructed in 1894 and has gone through many tribulations since then. At the end of World War II, Reichstag was heavily damaged by the bombings. This sparked the debate about whether to restore it or demolish it, but in 1956 decision was made to restore it. However, at first, it was restored without its original dome.\n\nIn 1999, a new, large glass dome that offers a 360-degree view of the surrounding Berlin cityscape was constructed. Today, mostly because of the epic dome, Reichstag is the second most visited attraction in Germany, only behind the Cologne Cathedral. Entrance is free, but you will need a prior reservation if you wish to visit Reichstag and its dome.\n\nMuseum island\n\nMuseum-lovers rejoice! Located in the historic heart of Berlin, on the northern part of Spree Island is the Berlin Museum Island.\n\nMuseum Island is a UNESCO World Heritage site and complex of internationally significant museums. The complex was built from 1830 to 1930 under the order of Prussian kings, but new buildings are still added according to the plan.\n\nMuseum Island consists of the following museums:\n\nThe Altes Museum (Old Museum) – Antiquities collection from ancient Rome and Greece\n\nThe Neues Museum (New Museum) – a spectacular collection of Prehistoric and Early historical findings\n\nThe Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery) – exhibiting art from the 19th century to the 21st century\n\nThe Bode Museum – featuring sculptures, coins, medals and Byzantian art\n\nThe Pergamon Museum – the most visited museum on Museum Island, it has three areas: the Middle East, Islamic art and Antique\n\nThe Humboldt Forum – opened in 2020 inside the Berlin Palace, with exhibitions consisting of two former museums, the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art.\n\nCharlottenburg Palace\n\nThis baroque palace from the end of the 17th century is certainly among the most impressive buildings in Berlin. The construction of the original palace was ordered by Sophie Charlottenburg, the wife of Friedrich I, but it has been expanded greatly during the 18th century.\n\nToday, the Charlottenburg Palace complex is a major tourist attraction. The interiors of the palace are lavishly decorated in baroque style and rococo styles. Behind the palace, there is a large woodland area, which includes a beautiful garden, mausoleum, belvedere, a pavilion and a theatre.\n\nBerlin TV tower\n\nWith its height of 368m, Fernsehturm is the tallest building in Germany and it can be seen from all over the city. Constructed during the 1960s by the German Democratic Republic, it was supposed to be the symbol of Communist power. However, after the reunification of Berlin, it became the symbol of reunited Berlin and the most iconic part of the Berlin skyline.\n\nThe main selling point of Fernsehturm is its spectacular 360-degrees panoramic view of Berlin.\n\nOlympiastadion\n\nMore than a sports avenue, Olympiastadion is a part of history. Built for the 1936 Summer Olympic games, with an original capacity of more than 100,000, the stadium is now a home for Hertha BSC football club and has a capacity of 74,000. The stadium hosted numerous important football games, such as the 2006 FIFA World cup finals and the 2015 UEFA Champions League finals. In 2009, Usain Bolt broke the 100m and 200m world records at Olympiastadion. When there are no events, you can explore this monumental stadium and its facilities as a part of guided tours.\n\nActivities\n\nYou could stay in Berlin for a year and still find new activities every day. Certainly among the most interesting cities in the world, there is no shortage of things to do in Berlin. Below we will mention some of the most noteworthy activities in Berlin.\n\nExplore Tiergarten\n\nTiergarten is Berlin’s largest and most popular park and a perfect place for a break from the city’s traffic and fast-paced tempo.\n\nComparable with New York’s Central Park or London’s Hyde Park, Tiergarten offers many facilities open to the public. Within the park, you can find places suitable for picnics and barbecues, as well as for jogging, cycling and field sports. For children, there is a large playground, while adults can enjoy a coffee in one of the coffee shops. Victory Column, in the heart of a park, can be climbed for an amazing panoramic view of the park and surroundings. During winter, you can ice skate on a small lake called Neuer See and in the spring it’s beautiful inside the English Gardens. Berlin’s ZOO is also located within the Tiergarten.\n\nVisit Berlin Zoological Garden\n\nWith more than 20,000 animals, from 1,000 animal species, Berlin Zoological Garden is one of the most species-rich zoos in the world.\n\nInside the ZOO you can find a variety of big cats, birds, apes, rhinos, hippos, penguins and many more. In past, Berlin ZOO was home to famous exotic animals such as Knut, the polar bear, Bobby, the gorilla and Bao Bao, the panda.\n\nUnique experience within the ZOO is witnessing open-for-public animal feedings & training which happen throughout the day.\n\nA part of a Zoological Garden complex is the Berlin Aquarium which hosts over 9,000 species of not only fish but also reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates.\n\nWith all of this being said, it’s no surprise that Berlin ZOO is the most visited ZOO in Europe.\n\nDay trip to Potsdam\n\nOf all of the possible day trips from Berlin, one stands out. Only half an hour south-west of Berlin lies the beautiful city of Potsdam.\n\nIn past, Potsdam used to be a residence of Prussian Kings, which is why it is filled with awe-inspiring palaces and royal parks. Actually, the palaces and parks of Potsdam have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999.\n\nThe most famous of all palaces is Sanssoucci which is often compared to French Versailles. Surrounding the palace are magnificent baroque flower gardens, vineyards, and greenhouses. On the western side of Sanssouci park is the grandiose New Palace, considered to be the last great Prussian baroque palace.\n\nBesides Sanssouci, while in Potsdam, make sure to visit the Dutch Quarter, St. Nicholas Church and Brandenburg gate (not to be confused with the one in Berlin).\n\nBoat tour on the river Spree\n\nRiver Spree runs through the city’s centre and its calm waters are perfect for boat cruises. There are plenty of different boat cruises to choose from. They vary in length and duration, but mostly take the same route through the city centre and the Landwehr canal. The one we recommend is the romantic night cruise which starts at 9:30 pm and ends at midnight.\n\nDuring the boat cruise, you will pass by plenty of Berlin landmarks such as the Berlin Cathedral and Museum Island. For us, the most idyllic and pleasurable part was passing through the Tiergarten.\n\nGo to Deutsches Theatre or Opera\n\nThe cultural scene in Berlin is vibrant and exciting. There are more than 100 theatres, 8 orchestras, 3 operas, circuses, cabarets, and pretty much any other show you could think of.\n\nDeutsche Oper Berlin is the city’s largest opera house which regularly hosts world-renowned operas.\n\nDeutsches Theater Berlin is world-renowned for its contemporary plays, but also has some evergreen classics in its repertoire.\n\nFriedrichstadt-Palast is another worthwhile theatre in Berlin. More than a million people visit the Palast each year for a wide variety of shows full of glamour, dancing and stunning performances.\n\nFestivals & Events\n\nFrom winter to summer, there is always some kind of festival or event going on in Berlin. It doesn’t matter if you are a fan of art, beer lover or sports enthusiast, Berlin has something for you.\n\nBerlin Christmas markets\n\nVisiting Berlin during the Christmas period is a true delight! Both locals and tourists love Berlin’s Christmas Markets because they bring everyone together.\n\nMore than 50 Christmas markets, with unique styles, decorations and ambiences are spread throughout the city. Tasty culinary delights, beer, hand-made crafts and plenty more can be found in these markets.\n\nMost visited is the Christmas market at Gendarmenmarkt.\n\nKarneval der Kulturen\n\nCelebrated annually from late May to early June, the Berlins Carnival of Culture is the best representation of Berlin’s cultural diversity. During the four-day-long carnival, more than 5000 dancers from the various ethnicities showcase their traditional costumes, dances and arts. The peak of the festival is during the street parade on Pentecost Sunday. During the parade, thousands of performers walk the streets of Berlin and entertain more than half a million visitors.\n\nBerlinale\n\nIn this city of culture, Berlin Film Festival is a cultural event that stands out from the crowd.\n\nThis festival has a long history, it was founded in 1951 and held annually every February since 1978. Considered one of the “Big Three” European film festivals alongside the Cannes and Venice film festivals. With more than 100,000 tickets sold each year, Berlinale has the largest attendance of all film festivals. The highest prize awarded at the festival is the Golden bear, inspired by the Berlins’ signature coat of arms.\n\nOktoberfest Berlin\n\nAs in Munich, every year from late September to early-mid October, Berlin organizes its own Oktoberfest. Oktoberfest in Berlin is a little brother of the famous one in Munich, but equally fun. An endless amount of beer, pretzels, and wursts is accompanied by jolly people dancing and singing. Besides this, there are also plenty of rides and games for children of all ages.\n\nThat sounds like a good recipe to have a great time, right?\n\nFestival of Lights\n\nSince 2005, for two weeks every fall, Berlin becomes the city of light.\n\nEven though festivals of lights have become increasingly popular throughout the world, the Berlin Festival of Lights is surely one of the best. More than 50 landmarks such as Berlin Cathedral, Brandenburg gate and TV Tower light up with an impressive combination of modern art and lights.\n\nArt week\n\nWhen it comes to contemporary art Berlin is the place to be, and no event is bigger than Berlin Art week. Organized for more than 10 years, Berlin art week is a 6-day cultural event that showcases contemporary art from all over the world.\n\nA diverse programme of Art week includes numerous locations throughout Berlin that feature various exhibitions, paintings, sculptures, and installations. For artists from all over the world, Art week is a huge opportunity to show their creations. The crowd certainly appreciates it if we can judge by the number of visitors because more than 100,000 people regularly attend the event.\n\nBerlin marathon\n\nThe Berlin marathon is one of Germany’s largest sporting events held annually. What started in 1974 as a small local event has now grown into one of the world’s six major marathons. Today, thousands of athletes gather on the streets of Berlin to compete against each other and against themselves. The Marathon course is quite attractive as it starts and ends at Brandenburg gate and passes by a couple of other landmarks.\n\nFood\n\nBerlin is an international and culturally diverse city, which is reflected in its cuisine as well. From traditional German to international cuisines of Asian, Mediterranean and others, you can find plenty of restaurants to choose from. While most of the traditional dishes include meat, vegetarian food is also widely available in Berlin.\n\nWhat to eat in Berlin?\n\nBerlin is most famous for its sausages, or wursts as Germans call them. There are quite a few combinations to choose from, but the first two you should try are bratwurst and currywurst. The first is the more traditional, usually served with mustard, while the second one is served with delicious curry sauce. Both are quite easy to find throughout the city.\n\nAnother easy to find street food is Döner Kebab. Originally a Turkish meal, brought to Germany by Turkish immigrants, Döner Kebabs have quickly become a staple of Berlin street food. Thinly sliced meat, mixed with ingredients of your choice inside of bread or a wrap is a perfect food when low on time or after a night out.\n\nWhile in Germany it would be a shame not to try a schnitzel. Veal escalope with a coating of breadcrumbs, eggs and flour creates a delicious meat meal. They are usually served with potato salad and a piece of lemon which adds another layer of flavour to the dish.\n\nAnother meal meat lovers have to try is eisbein. Eisbein is pork knuckle, usually boiled or grilled, served with sauerkraut, potatoes, and boiled peas. Simply mouthwatering!\n\nWhen it comes to desserts, Berliner Donuts or Pfannkuchen are the most famous ones. Similar to filled doughnuts, Pfannkuchen is filled with jam or chocolate filling with sugar sprinkled on top. They are a perfect snack when you need a quick energy boost.\n\nApfelstrudel is another dessert associated with Germany, but it actually originated in Austria. Delicious apple strudels are best when served hot, and with vanilla cream on top.\n\nOne thing you mustn’t skip while in Berlin is the local beer. German beer has a good reputation throughout the world, and for a good reason. Some say there are more than 5,000 you could try in Berlin! So don’t be shy and say “Ein Bier, bitte!” while in a bar.\n\nWhere to eat?\n\nThere is no shortage of good restaurants to visit while in Berlin. In the end, everything depends on what you are looking for.\n\nOne affordable place locals like to go for lunch is Lebensmittel in Mitte. They serve very well cooked South German food.\n\nFor a fine dining experience, you should go to Michelin star restaurants such as Tim Raue and CODA. Be prepared to leave €100 per person in these restaurants, at least.\n\nKonnopke’s Imbiss is a famous sausage stand managed by the same family since the 1930s. Their sausages are just terrific!\n\nArguably the most famous burger bar in Berlin is Burgermeister. Interestingly, this burger bar is located inside a vintage public toilet facility in Kreuzberg. Doesn’t sound too appealing, right? However, their burgers are amazing and made from high-quality ingredients.\n\nNow that you had a tasty meal, get prepared for a night out in a city known for its nightlife.\n\nNightlife\n\nBerlin is certainly vibrant during the day, however, the city shows its true face during the night. Countless bars, pubs and events are just foreplay for one of the best clubbing scenes in the world.\n\nKnown as the capital of techno music, Berlin has plenty of clubs that host the world’s best DJs which means there is no shortage of good music. Berlin is also known for its open-mindedness and sexual liberty. When you combine those things, you are up for a wild weekend with no restrictions.\n\nYou should know that some clubs are notoriously hard to get it. Don’t overdress, don’t be loud while in the line, and learn some basic German phrases such as “Wie geht’s?”. When it comes to dressing up, Berliners don’t really like to stand out and you can’t miss it with black clothes.\n\nAlright, so now you are probably wondering…\n\nWhere is the best place to go out in Berlin?\n\nIn Berlins central district Mitte, Hackescher Markt and Oranienburger Straße are both a good place to start the night. There is a wide variety of pubs and bars in which you can have a few drinks to relax and get into the atmosphere of the night. A unique bar you could go to is the Berlin Ice Bar near Alexanderplatz.\n\nOnce you feel ready to party all night long, you should go to the Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district. What used to be two districts is now a single district full of clubs, with the river Spree flowing through its middle.\n\nIn Friedrichshain, you will find the infamous Berghain, often referred to as the church of techno. Located in an old power plant, Berghain hosts some of the wildest parties in the world. It’s really hard to get in so don’t put all of your eggs in this basket. If you don’t get into Berghain, there are two more amazing clubs, Sisyphos and About Blank, you can go to on this side of river Spree.\n\nIn Kreuzberg, across the river Spree, you can also find a couple of household names in the world of techno music. To start there is Tresor, one of the most respected techno clubs in the world. Close to Tresor, there is KitKat, a techno-sex club infamous for its sexual liberty and definitely one of the craziest clubs you will ever go to.\n\nThe great thing about Berlin is that its public transport system works 24/7 during the weekends, which means you can move around and get home quickly and safely.\n\nShopping\n\nBerlin is amongst the best places in Europe for shopping. From large malls and department stores filled with luxury designer boutiques to flea markets and handmade products, there is something for everyone.\n\nIf you have time to roam around the city streets you will certainly find something of interest. However, to save you some time, we will name some of the best shopping locations in Berlin.\n\nWhere to shop in Berlin?\n\nIn the Charlottenburg district, head to the Kurfürstendamm boulevard. This is the most famous shopping street in Berlin which has multiple department stores, and plenty of popular designer boutiques, cafes and restaurants. The largest department store in Berlin, KaDeWe is located on this boulevard, as well as Europa-Center Berlin and Bikini Berlin centre. On top of Bikini Berlin, there is a wonderful rooftop terrace bar where you can relax and enjoy a view of the city and Berlin Zoological Garden animals.\n\nFor a more alternative shopping experience, you should go to Oranienstraße in the Kreuzberg district. The street has a variety of small book shops, vintage clothing boutiques, record stores and markets. Kreuzberg Flowmarkt is a great place to shop for handmade stuff, while Markthalle Neun is great for fresh food produce. When you are tired of shopping on Oranienstraße, you can sit in one of the numerous restaurants.\n\nBerlin has a bunch of flea markets where you can casually browse and look for bargains. The biggest and most well-known flea market is the one at Mauerpark, however, there is at least one in every district. At these flea markets, depending on where you go, you can find practically everything from furniture to fresh fish.\n\nAccommodation\n\nBerlin is massive and the list of places where you could stay is endless. Whatever your budget is you will find a corresponding accommodation in Berlin. Airbnb’s are available throughout the city, and there is no shortage of 5-star hotels or cheap hostels in Berlin.\n\nWhere to stay in Berlin?\n\nIf you want to be close to the main attractions then stay in Mitte. However, you will have to pay for such a convenience because Mitte is relatively very expensive when it comes to accommodation and food.\n\nPrenzlauerberg, northeast of Mitte, is perfect for families. It’s close enough to most of the attractions but more laid back than the Mitte. Plenty of shops and cafes in the area.\n\nIf you want to party in Berlin then Friedrichshain is your district for sure. That is because some of the best clubs in Berlin such as Berghain are located in Friedrichshain. The area used to be full of artists and you can notice a lot of street art on the walls which creates a cool alternative vibe.\n\nKreuzberg is an edgy, multicultural and urban area close to the city centre. This area is great for younger travellers that don’t want to break the bank on accommodation and food. Kreuzberg has plenty to offer when it comes to attractions, pubs and clubs.\n\nFor a more upscale atmosphere, go to the Charlottenburg district. This area is quieter than most and has a nice variety of cafes and restaurants to choose from.\n\nUseful Contacts\n\nPolizei Berlin: 110\n\nFire service: 112\n\nMedical service: 112\n\nOn-call doctor service: 116117\n\nPoison control centre: +49 30 19240\n\nDrugs and addiction: +49 30 19237.\n\nEmergency pharmacy telephone information: (0800) 0022833\n\nEmergency dental service: (030) 89004333\n\nChildren’s emergency service: (030) 610061\n\n24/7 Taxi in English: +49-30-20 20 21 22 0\n\nUseful Information\n\nTimezone: CET + 1\n\nCurrency: Euro\n\nLanguage: German\n\nPower outlets: Type F\n\nMap\n\nBelow is a map with all the mentioned places in the Berlin city guide for easier navigation and planning."
