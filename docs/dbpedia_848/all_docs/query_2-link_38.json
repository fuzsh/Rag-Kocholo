        "text": "Berlin's mayor once shortly summed up Germany's capital city as 'poor but sexy'. Still affordable compared to Paris and London, trendy and free-spirited, Berlin has become one of the most attractive European capitals for tourists in the last decade. It is both a vibrant multi-million metropolis and a European city with a long history where super-modern architecture and historical sights coexist. Also, Berlin is the greenest and most spacious among the major European capitals, boasting more parks, city forests and water than all the others, allowing locals and visitors alike to breathe freely.\n\nMainly due to its momentous history, Berlin is probably the most eclectic major Western capital. Its districts are often very different from each other and sometimes feel like they were from different regions, for some reason stitched together into one city. The historical and government Mitte district with the Reichstag, the Brandenburg Gate and the glass and steel, ultra-modern Potsdamer Platz stands next to the lively and fashionable Kreuzberg and punky Friedrichshain in East Berlin.\n\nBerlin is like an enormous history book or a crossword puzzle. At almost every turn there are references to historical events that shaped the modern image of the German capital: remains of the Berlin Wall, memorial tiles engraved in the pavement, signs of former checkpoints, various graffitis from different epochs, old breweries converted into modern exhibition halls.\n\nIn this article we suggest a three-day route through the German capital with most of its landmarks, as well as locally popular cafes and art venues so that you will fall in love with the city's eclecticism, functionality and its freedom for the craziest artistic experiments.\n\nDay 1 - The Mitte\n\nMuseum Island\n\nYou should start your aquaintance with Berlin from the historical district called Mitte. Almost all the main attractions are found here within walking distance. The Mitte's heart is beating in the beautiful Museum Island on the Spree River. Five of Berlin's most famous museums are located here: the Bode Museum, the Pergamon Museum, the Old National Gallery, the Old Museum and the New Museum. This distinctive architectural ensemble took more than a hundred years to build. Since 1999, it has been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. The five museums present collections of works of art and rare archaeological artifacts of ancient civilizations, early Christian Byzantium, German and European art, covering six millennia of human history.\n\nAll five museums are free every Thursday from 4PM. Also, it pays to buy the three-days Berlin Museum Pass as it gives you free admission to over 30 Berlin museums. The regular price is 29 euros, the reduced price is 14.5 euros. Click here to see the full list of museums and to purchase the Berlin Museum Pass.\n\nApart from exploring the greatest Berlin museums, you can feast your eyes on the monumental Berlin Cathedral, stroll along the river and visit open film screenings or live music concerts in the summer.\n\nAddress: Museumsinsel 10117 Berlin\n\nTransportation: city trains (S-Bahn) S1, S2, S25, S26, (U-Bahn) U6, Fridrichstaße station / U2, Spittelmarkt, Märkisches Museum, Hausvogteiplatz stations / S3, S5, S7, S9, trams M4, M5, M6, Hackescher Markt station / trams M1, 12, Am Kupfergraben station\n\nOpening hours: visit Museum Island's official website for all the information\n\nAdmission fee: click here. Free admission every Thursday from 16:00.\n\nOfficial website: click here\n\nCafé Hummus & Friends\n\nAfter exploring museums, stop by the Hummus & Friends cafe nearby, Mitte insiders' favorite spot for a lunch break. It is a nice low-key vegetarian cafe with dozens of different kinds of homemade hummus - a speciality from the Mediterranean made of mashed chickpeas, olive oil, lemon juice, salt and garlic. You can choose between beetroot, mushroom, avocado, and even chocolate and mango hummus along with lion's share of vegetable salads and desserts. This is an ideal spot for a healthy lunch or dinner, even if you are not a vegetarian. You will find a relaxed atmosphere, stylish design and a friendly staff - as their slogan says \"Make hummus, not walls\".\n\nAddress: Oranienburger Str. 27, 10117 Berlin\n\nTransportation: Metro S1, S2, S25, S26, Oranienburger Straße station / trams M1, M5 / bus M1, Oranienburger Straße station\n\nOpening hours: Every day 11:00 - 23:00\n\nThe Reichstag\n\nThe Reichstag building is where the sessions of the German parliament take place and new laws are passed. It is the main symbol of German democracy. The principle of transparency is reflected in the design of the glass dome that is open for visitors everyday. It is a fantastic architectural structure made of glass and mirrors reminiscent of a space station. From inside the dome you get a full view of the parliament's hall and the ongoing parliamentary sessions. Two circular ramps go up to the observation deck at the top of the dome. A panoramic view of Berlin 40 meters above the city will take your breath away.\n\nTo visit the dome, you have to register on the official website of the Reichstag. Pick a sunny day for the visit and do not forget to bring your passport. Better to arrive 15 minutes before the time on the ticket. Take a free audio guide at the entrance to learn about the history of the Reichstag building.\n\nYou can also visit a parliamentary session and take a guided tour inside the Reichstag building. During the tour, you will see messages scrawled on the walls by Red Army soldiers from the time of the siege in 1945 when they raised the Soviet flag on the Reichstag, a moment that symbolizes to this day the victory over fascism.\n\nAddress: Platz der Republik 1, 11011 Berlin\n\nTransportation: U55 (U-Bahn), Bundestag station / S1, S2, S 25, S 26, U55, Bus 100, 245, Brandenburger Tor station\n\nOpening hours: Every day 8:00 - 24:00\n\nRegistration: Click here\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate is a symbol of Berlin and perhaps the most recognizable landmark of Germany. It is the only city gate of the German capital that still exists today. It was built in the 18th century as the first significant monument in the new architectural style of Berlin classicism as Prussia was rising as a European power. The gate was commisioned by the Prussian king Frederick William II, originally named the 'Peace Gate'. The gate was decorated with a sculpture depicting Victoria, the goddess of victory, driving a chariot pulled by four horses - the Quadriga of Victory.\n\nThroughout its existence, the Brandenburg gate was often a site for major historical events. It witnessed many of the great military events in German history: the triumphal procession of the troops of Napoleon after their victory over Prussia in 1806 and German soldiers going to the front in both world wars.\n\nSince 1961, the Gate was inaccessible, blocked by the Berlin wall that divided the capital into East and West Berlin. For 28 years, it was a symbol of a divided Germany. Since the unification of Berlin it has not only stood as a reminder of the tumultuous history of Germany, but also as a symbol of unity and peace. The gate suffered wars, ruins, damage, but it has retained its original appearance today thanks to a thorough restoration.\n\nNowadays the Brandenburg Gate is a part of the architectural ensemble of Paris Square. The Gate overlooks Berlin's most famous boulevard - Unter den Linden ('Under the lime trees' in German) named after its long lines of lime trees. The street runs from the Brandenburg Gate and Paris Square to the Spree River and the Berlin Palace.\n\nAddress: Pariser Platz, 10117 Berlin\n\nTransportation: S1, S2, S 25, S 26, U55, Bus 100, 245, Brandenburger Tor station\n\nPotsdamer Platz\n\nPotsdamer Platz is often called 'a New York in Berlin'. Made of glass and steel, it is an ultra-modern complex of high-rise office buildings and a hub of entertainment and shopping.\n\nSince the late 19th century and until the Second World War, the square was a lively place with high-class hotels and restaurants. In the destruction of the war it turned into a complete wasteland, and afterwards the square was razed. By the mid-seventies there was nothing left but the Berlin Wall. The only remaining piece of the old Potsdamer Platz, from the Kaisersaal hall of the Hotel Esplanade, is kept today in a vitrine like a museum exhibit.\n\nIn 1990, the Pink Floyd leader Roger Waters gave a live concert here and a year later the square became the largest construction site in Europe. Today Potsdamer Platz is again one of the liveliest places in Berlin. There is a wonderful Legoland museum, attractive for young and old, and a Museum of Film and Television in the huge Sony Center. Also, every year in February, three cinema theaters roll out a red carpet for celebrities and film stars during the world famous Berlinale festival.\n\nAddress: Potsdamer Platz, 10785 Berlin\n\nTransportation: U2 Potsdamer Platz station / S1, S2, S25, S26, Berlin Potsdamer Platz Bahnhof station\n\nRestaurant Vino & Basilico\n\nIt was a great luck to hit upon this superb small Italian restaurant in the Mitte on a cold rainy evening, the typical Berlin weather in early spring. You will be warmed up by the Southern hospitality and the cozy, relaxing atmosphere as if you were in the home of an Italian friend. You will be treated with delicious classical Italian dishes, from fresh burrata and veal carpaccio to several types of home-made pasta and a soft chocolate cake and air-whipped tiramisu.\n\nIt was a challenge to choose between straccetti, tortelloni, macceroncini, fusilloni, tagliolini types of pasta. We picked the exotic black Tagliolini with red prawns and smoked Provola cheese and a glass of white wine (that you can see on the photo above) that turned out to be finger-licking. It is a perfect gourmand dinner after a long day of sight-seeing.\n\nVino & Basilico is a pocket of sweet Italian dolce vita in the middle of Berlin.\n\nAddress: Tucholskystraße 18/20, 10117 Berlin\n\nTransportation: S-Bahn, Oranienburger Str. station\n\nOpening hours: Mon-Fri 12: 00-14: 00, 17: 00-23: 00 / Sat & Holidays 17:00 - 23:00\n\nDay 2\n\nKulturbrauerei\n\nKulturbrauerei, 'cultural brewery' in German, is a complex of buildings in the North of Berlin humming with cultural events year-long. It was once one of Berlin's most successful and largest breweries. In 1974, the Kulturbrauerei received the status of a historical monument as one of the few surviving industrial complexes from 19th century Berlin. In the late 1990s there was a decision to turn this industrial space into a local epicenter of cultural life.\n\nToday, Kulturbrauerei is pulsing with concerts, shows, parties, exhibitions and open-air events. The food market 'Street Food auf Achse' takes place every Sunday in the yard, where you can treat yourself with everything from vegan delicacies to meat burgers and Mexican spicy food. In the winter, the most beautiful Christmas market of the city opens for Berliners and visitors offering artisan products and specialties from Scandinavian countries.\n\nAddress: Schönhauser Allee 36, 10435 Berlin\n\nTransportation: U2, tram 12, M1, M10, bus N2, Eberswalder Straße station\n\nWebsite: click here\n\nEast Side Gallery\n\nEast Side Gallery, located along the Spree river in the Friedrichshain district, is perhaps the most unusual art gallery in the world. It is a large collection of open-air murals painted on the 1316-meters long remaining fragment of the Berlin Wall.\n\nFrom 1961 until 1989, the border between West and East Germany cut through the center of Berlin and divided the city into two. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, a section of the wall remained to be a canvas for artistic reflection on those political events. 118 artists from 21 countries painted more than a hundred graffiti on the east side of the Wall, transforming a symbol of division and conflict into one of peace and unity.\n\nOne of the most famous murals of the East Side Gallery is a graffity by Russian artist Dmitry Vrubel 'My God, Help Me to Survive This Fatal Attraction'. It is sometimes referred to as the 'Fraternal Kiss' as it depicts Leonid Brezhnev (the leader of the USSR) and Erich Honecker (head of the German Democratic Republic) greeting each other with a kiss.\n\nOver time, in the absence of protection, the graffiti were unrecognizably damaged, and in 2009 the city authorities invited artists to restore their murals. Since then, the gallery has been under government protection as a historical monument.\n\nAddress: Mühlenstraße 3-100, 10243 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: U1, U3, tram M10, buses 300, 347, N1, U1, Warschauer Str. station\n\nRestaurant Baraka\n\nIf you love North African (Maghreb) cuisine, you should visit the restaurant 'Baraka' for the best falafel in town. In a spacious hall, with ochreous walls as if scorched by the Sahara's sun, you can sit at your table or take off your shoes and cross legs on a soft carpet with pillows just like you were in a cafe in Marrakesh. If you are not yet familiar with Moroccan and Egyptian cuisine, try some classic dish like tajine - savory meat stew slow-cooked in a special earthenware pot. You can try several types of tajine, for example, veal with cinnamon sauce, sesame, almonds and prunes. Couscous and homemade bread are served as a side dish.\n\nWe tried so called Mezze, a selection of various small dishes served as appetizers, and stayed for hours drinking hot mint tea from a silver teapot.\n\nIt is an ideal place for delicious leisurely meals with friends and enjoying high-quality Egyptian and Moroccan specialties at resonable prices.\n\nAddress: Lausitzer Pl. 6, 10997 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: U1, U3, trams M29, N1, U1, Görlitzer Bahnhof station\n\nOpening hours: Mon-Thurs, Sun 11:00- 24:00, Fri, Sat 11:00 - 25:00\n\nGendarmenmarkt\n\nGendarmenmarkt is the most beautiful historical square in the center of Berlin, one of its emblematic landmarks.\n\nIn the late 18th century, the Prussian king Frederick I commissioned two churches to be built here: a 'German church' (Neue Kirche or Deutscher Dom) for Lutherans and a 'French church' (Französischer Dom) for Calvinists. These two cathedrals face each other across the square, adjoining a monumental Concert Hall. In front of it, there is the statue of the German poet Friedrich Schiller.\n\nGendarmenmarkt has changed its name several times. Its current name comes from a curious historical fact: in the 18th century the stable for the horses of the gendarmes, the elite Prussian cavalry, were located here.\n\nThe square is surrounded by a large number of high-class restaurants and hotels, and is gorgeously illuminated by night.\n\nAddress: Gendarmenmarkt, 10117 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: U2, Hausvogteiplatz station / U2, U6, bus N6, Stadt Mitte station\n\nRausch Chocolate House\n\nRausch (meaning ecstasy or rush in German) is the biggest and one of the oldest chocolate shops in Berlin that recently celebrated its centenary. Discover three floors of this immense chocolate 'realm' next to Gendarmenmarkt square, with a large sweets shop, a chocolate museum and a cafe. You can choose between 200 types of Rausch signature pralines at their famous counter and also see the city's main landmarks handcrafted from chocolate on-site: a sweet miniature of the Brandenburg Gate and the Reichstag. A box of Rausch pralines or a chocolate figure of city's official symbol, a bear, will be a wonderful souvenir from Berlin.\n\nThe Rausch cafe on the third floor is a perfect spot for a sweet pause during your sightseeing or before going to a concert in the Berlin Concert Hall next street. Treat yourself with their signature hot chocolate or an apple strudel. Also, this chocolate temple recently expanded and opened a small stylish coffee shop, Rausch Deli, with fresh patisserie and freshly roasted coffee-to-go.\n\nAddress: Charlottenstraße 60, 10117 Berlin\n\nTransportation: U2, U6, bus N6, Stadt Mitte station\n\nOpening hours: Every day 10:00 - 20:00\n\nKonzerthaus\n\nBerlin Konzerthaus is one of the main classical music venues in the city, located at the heart of the prettiest Gendarmenmarkt square.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the neoclassical building was badly damaged, like most of Berlin's historical architectural sites. It reopened in 1984 as a concert hall, hosting today over 550 classical music, opera and jazz events a year.\n\nBerlin Konzerthaus loves to experiment with different formats and to expand audience's exprience of music. It offers unusual series of musical perfomances, for example, 'Mittendrin - Right in the middle', where you can have a seat in the middle of the orchestra to experience the music up-close, or 'Espresso Concerts' every Wednesday with tickets including a cup of espresso before the concert. Chamber music concerts are also regularly held. You can check the program and book a ticket at the official website.\n\nAddress: Gendarmenmarkt, 10117 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: U2, Hausvogteiplatz station / U2, U6, Stadt Mitte station\n\nWebsite: Click here\n\nDay 3\n\nAlexanderplatz\n\nAlexanderplatz is both an important transportation hub in the Mitte district and a large pedestrian square. Since the 18th century, the official name of the square was the “Royal Gate Square” but after the visit of the Russian emperor Alexander I in 1805, it was renamed to 'Alexanderplatz'. Berliners often simply call it 'Alex'.\n\nLocals love to fix meetings and occasionally organize protests at the gigantesque World Clock, also known as the Urania World Clock, a large turret-style world clock that shows current time in 148 major cities around the world.\n\nThe 368 metres-tall Television Tower (Berliner Fernsehturm) located close to Alexanderplatz is also an essential part of Berlin's skyline and a key tourist attraction. It is the tallest structure in Germany, with a fantastic observation deck and a revolving sphere restaurant with breathtaking 360 degrees panorama.\n\nAddress: 10178 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: U2, U5, U8, Alexanderplatz station / S3, S5, S7, S9, Berlin Alexanderplatz Bahnhof station / trams M4, M5, M6, Alexanderplatz Bhf/Gontardstraße station\n\nOpening hours of the observation deck: March to October: 9:00 - 24:00 / November to February: 10:00 - 24:00 / the bar closes at 23:30\n\nWebsite: Click here\n\nBerlin Cathedral\n\nThe Berlin Cathedral (Berliner Dom in German) on the Museum Island is a majestic baroque building with patina green domes and the largest Protestant church in Germany. Initially, the ambition of the Lutheran community in Prussia in the late 19th century was to surpass the Vatican's St. Peter's Basilica in its splendor, and to create a site for all European Lutherans to gather. Despite the Protestant doctrine preaching restraint and asceticism, the exterior and interior of the cathedral was built to be luxurious and rich. The dome is open for visits and offers a spectacular panoramic view of Berlin.\n\nIn addition to the city’s major opera houses and concert halls, the Berlin Cathedral is considered one of the top-music venues in the city. It hosts over 100 concerts every year, all under the spectacular Cathedral's dome. Check the program at their official website.\n\nAfter the visit, take a walk in the Lustgarten (Pleasure Garden in German) park in front of the Cathedral.\n\nAddress: Am Lustgarten, 10178 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: Bus 100, 245, 300, Lustgarten station / trams M1, 12, Am Kupfergraben station / U2, Spittelmarkt, Märkisches Museum, Hausvogteiplatz stations\n\nOpening hours of Cathedral Visit : Mon-Fri 10:00-19:00 / Sat 10:00-15:30 / Sun 12:00-19:00\n\nWebsite: click here\n\nHackesche Höfe\n\nHackesche Höfe (Höfe means 'courtyards' in German), is a must-visit heritage site in the center of Berlin. It consists of eight interconnected courtyards with gardens, fountains, cafes, designer shops and cultural institutions forming a labyrinth of exciting discoveries.\n\nThis place is a rare corner in Berlin: though it changed a lot throughout the twentieth century it eventually got back its historical appearance. Its neighbourhood used to be a poor suburb of Berlin until it was commisionned to be transformed into residential and industrial premises with craftmen's workshops in 1906. The complex of buildings was designed in the Jugendstil (German art nouveau) style, and the first courtyard is decorated with a sumptuous facade of polychrome glazed brick. Three years later, the famous cabaret Der Neue Club (The New Club) was opened here and attracted local bohemian circles. Although it was completely abandoned during the war, the courtyards were later reconstructed and restored. Since 1972, Hackesche Höfe is a state protected architectural monument.\n\nNowadays it is the most expensive piece of real estate in Berlin. There are cozy cafes, bars, restaurants, a cinema, a theater, designer shops, as well as offices for creative industry professionals. Do not miss the souvenir shop of Ampelmann, the popular red-and-green man and the symbol shown on pedestrian signals in Germany.\n\nAlso, the Hackesche Höfe's area is now one of Berlin’s most popular nightlife spots.\n\nAddress: Rosenthaler Str. 40-41, 10178 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: S3, S5, S7, S9, S75, trams 12, M1, M4, M5, M6 Hackescher Markt station / U8 U Weinmeisterstraße station\n\nOpening hours: Mon - Fri 8:00 - 24:00 / Sat, Sun 9:00 - 24:00\n\nRestaurant Oxymoron\n\nTake yourself back to the 1920s by having a dinner in this gorgeous restaurant in the first courtyard of the Hackesche Höfe courtyard complex. A very elegant, old-style interior with brass chandeliers and subdued lighting creates a warm relaxing atmosphere of the bohemian salon of another epoch. Book a table on the terrasse in the summer season or stay inside for a cocktail in the lounge bar.\n\nThe menu offers classical French and Italian dishes and an extensive list of drinks and cocktails along with a great selection of wines. You can have a three course lunch for 13.50 euros and continue your sightseeing in Berlin-Mitte.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday nights Oxymoron transforms into a DJ lounge, and historical art-nouveau style surroundings make it a wonderful place to enjoy the evening.\n\nAddress: Rosenthaler Str. 40-41, 10178 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: S3, S5, S7, S9, S75, trams 12, M1, M4, M5, M6 Hackescher Markt station / U8 U Weinmeisterstraße station\n\nOpening hours: Every day 9:00 - 24:00\n\nKäthe Kollwitz Museum\n\nA small museum in a 19th-century villa displays the largest collection of works of renowned German artist and sculptor Käthe Kollwitz. She was one of the most influential artists assotiated with the Expressionist movement. Her very intimate, delicate sculptures and drawings are confessions reflecting her tragic life through the two world wars and all the historical upheavals of the early 20th century in Germany.\n\nHer early work focused on the poverty and hardship among working people in her famous art cycles The Weavers and The Peasant War. Later she turned to the themes of grief and loss creating some of the most intimate, deeply emotional sculptural works, lithographs and paintings after losing her youngest child in the First World War.\n\nKäthe Kollwitz became the first woman to be elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts and also to receive a honorary professor status but forced to resign in 1933 due to her sympathy for socialist ideas. One of her most famous sculptures, Mother with her Dead Son, used for propaganda of the Nazi regime against her will, nowadays is a centerpiece of the 'Central Memorial for the Victims of War and Tyranny' in the The Neue Wache (New Guardhouse) museum in central Berlin.\n\nThis museum is a must-visit for all art and history lovers. After the visit, take a walk in the peaceful residential neighborhood Charlottenburg in West Berlin.\n\nAddress: Fasanenstraße 24, 10719 Berlin (Charlottenburg), Germany\n\nTransportation: U1 (U-Bahn), buses 109, 110, M19, M29, N10, X10, Uhlandstraße station\n\nOpening hours: Everyday 11:00 - 18:00 / Closed on December 24th and 31st\n\nEntrance fee: Regular tariff - 7 euros / Reduced tariff - 4 euros / Under 18 years, students, apprentices - free entrance\n\nWebsite: Click here\n\nCafé House of Small Wonder\n\nThis café definitely sits at the top of Berlin's gastronomic map. Hiding in a quiet street next to the bustling Friedrichstraße, a fairy-tale staircase invites you to a haven of small wonders. First you will see in awe the beautiful artist-built interior with huge windows letting in the sunlight, lots of wood and plants. Second, it is also a favorite place for a fancy breakfast, lunch or brunch for local and international foodies.\n\nAfter the success of their first café in New York in 2010, a married couple of restaurateurs, Motoko Watanabe and Shaul Margulies, decided to launch the House of Small Wonder in the trendiest and most open-minded European capital, Berlin. The menu reflects its multicultural spirit and consists of delicious lunch bowls with some Japanese influences. You will find spectacular egg dishes, toasts and sandwitches as well as homemade bread, croissants and sweets, freshly baked throughout the day.\n\nOne of their specials is the Brunch Set, a slow all-day-long breakfast buffet. A combination of their benedict sundae with miso soup and an avocado sandwich is really a wonder that might very well become your next gourmet obsession.\n\nAddress: Johannisstraße 20, 10117 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: U6, Oranienburger Tor station\n\nOpening hours: Every day 9:00 - 22:00\n\nWebsite: Click here\n\nFrau Tonis Parfum\n\nFrau Tonis Parfum is a boutique of artisanal niche perfumes. It may go unnoticed or seem like a laboratory with glass jars and white empty walls. The minimalist design is meant to let you enjoy the scents only without any distracting details.\n\nFrau Tonis is not a fictional character, she was the beloved grandmother of the brand's creator Stephanie Hansen. The photo of Frau Tonis can be seen among the bottles of perfumes.

As stated on their website individualism is the core principle of the brand. You can also create your own scent composition. Or, you can choose their best-seller, 'Linde Berlin', and bring home the scent of Berlin's blooming lime trees in a small flacone.\n\nAs Vogue says, this is a unique place for perfume aficionados from all over the world.\n\nAddress: Zimmerstraße 13 10969 Berlin, Germany\n\nTransportation: U6 U Kochstraße station / buses M29, N6\n\nOpening hours: Mon - Sat 10:00 - 18:00\n\nWebsite: Click here\n\nAuthor and photos - Olga Andrianova"
