Depending on the number of participants the excursion could be carried out in 2 languages (German/ English).\n\nTravel Documents:\n\nIt is each traveler's responsibility to research your country's travel requirements and to ensure that you are in compliance. This includes and is not limited to passport validity, blank visa pages required for your destination (s), and any other requirement.\n\nNon-EU Citizens: Please research the requirements of your prospective country of residency for international travel.\n\nUS citizens: A good website to research the requirements of the Schengen Agreement and other countries, and to read about passport validity requirements, visa requirements, as well as blank pages necessary for entry into each country is travel.state.gov.\n\nEU-citizens: (without special situations like dual citizenship, main residence abroad or a limited-validity passport) are required to have a valid passport or ID-card, not expiring within six (6) months from the end of your tour.\n\n*Important note: Please check on the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS) status as once implemented, this will be required to visit any of the 26 Schengen-member countries for tourism, business, medical, or transit. This is an additional check on security rather than a visa.\n\nTour Operator"
