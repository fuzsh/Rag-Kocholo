Hereâs a complete guide on what to do and see in Berlin-Mitte, including the best museums, historic sites, restaurants, and so much more!Â\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. We may receive a commission if you make a purchase after clicking on one of these links. You can read our full affiliate disclosure here.\n\nLiterally the âMiddleâ of Berlin, Mitte is one of the busiest neighborhoods in the city. Mitte is where Berlin first sprang up along the banks of the Spree River in the 13th century. Today itâs the beating heart of the city and is where youâll find the top attractions in Berlin, including the Brandenburg Gate, Alexanderplatz, Checkpoint Charlie, and more.\n\nEven after living in Berlin for five years, Mitte is a neighborhood I find myself in at least once per week. Although certain areas of Berlin-Mitte feel more touristy than others (Alexanderplatz and Brandenburg Gate, for example), thereâs really nowhere in Mitte thatâs a âno goâ zone for me. Itâs a vibrant neighborhood loaded with history, beautiful architecture, and good food.\n\nIn this post, Iâm sharing the top things to do in Berlin-Mitte. Know that this is a LONG guide because Mitte is very densely populated with attractions. I suggest using the provided Table of Contents to bop around the post at your leisure. Drop me a comment at the end of this post if you have additional questions on visiting Mitte!\n\nTable of Contents\n\nClick âshowâ to see the full table of contents for this post. You can jump around the post as desired by clicking on the individual sections listed below.Â\n\nMap of the Sights & Restaurants in This Guide\n\nMuseums in Berlin Mitte\n\nBelow are the top museums in Mitte. If youâre traveling on a budget, read my guide on the best free museums in the city for information on which museums are always free and which have free admission hours.\n\nMuseum Island\n\nMuseum Island is arguably the crowning jewel of Berlin-Mitte. Itâs a UNESCO World Heritage site with five world-famous museums:\n\nAltes Museum â The first public museum ever opened in Berlin! This beautiful building showcases the cityâs classical antiquities collection.\n\nNeues Museum â Home to the beloved Nefertiti sculpture (yes, itâs as incredible as they say!). The museum displays a mixture of Egyptian artifacts and papyrus, prehistoric and ancient artifacts, and other objects from antiquity.\n\nAlte Nationalgalerie â My favorite art museum in Berlin. The permanent collection boasts art and sculptures from the 19th and 20th centuries, with special emphasis on the Romantic and Impressionist movements.\n\nBode Museum â Arguably the most beautiful museum on Museum Island. Youâll find art and sculptures dating from the Middle Ages to the 18th century here. Thereâs also a whopping coin collection on display.\n\nPergamon Museum â Home of the Museum of the Ancient Near East and the Museum of Islamic Art. Much of the museum will remain under construction in 2024 so some of the most popular exhibits will be closed (including the Ishtar Gate and the Market Gate of Miletus.)\n\nTip: You can either purchase a combined ticket to get access to all five museums for a day, or you can purchase an individual ticket to just one of the museums. You can probably see two full museums in a single day, at most.Â\n\nHumboldt Forum\n\nPart museum, part cultural center, the Humboldt Forum is a free museum in Berlin-Mitte and one of the newest in the city. The exhibition spaces are dedicated to the histories of Africa, Oceania, Asia, and the Americas, but are explained through the lens of colonialism and its lasting impact on each region.\n\nThere are also lectures, live demonstrations, and guided tours that happen regularly at the Humboldt Forum (although not all are free). During Advent, youâll find a lovely Christmas market set up in the inner courtyard of the Humboldt Forum as well!\n\nTip: Head to the roof terrace of the Humboldt Forum for a great view of the Berlin Cathedral, TV Tower, and Berlin-Mitte. It costs â¬5 but is one of the more affordable viewpoints in the city.\n\nGerman History Museum\n\nHoused in the former Royal Prussian armory, the German History Museum (Deutsche Historische Museum) is yet another fantastic free museum in Mitte. As you can imagine, thereâs a lot of text to read and objects to examine â itâs no wonder considering Germanyâs history can be traced beyond the Middle Ages!\n\nGive yourself at least 4 hours to go through the German History Museum at a leisurely pace.\n\nMuseum of Natural History\n\nThe Museum of Natural History is a fantastic pick for adults and children alike. Itâs a working research museum with some 30 million items in its collection covering everything from zoology to paleontology to geology.\n\nNaturally, a mere fraction of the full collection can be seen inside the museum. My personal favorite is the Wet Collection, which displays 276,000 jars containing one million specimens!Â\n\nGet your tickets for the Museum of Natural History here.\n\nTopography of Terror\n\nThe Topography of Terror (Topographie des Terrors) is a free museum thatâs located on the former site of the Nazi Secret State Police (SS) headquarters. Its location was intentional, as the permanent exhibit explains in detail what atrocities were committed by the SS and police force in Hitlerâs Third Reich.\n\nFuturium\n\nThe Futurium is the perfect museum for museum-haters. The space is labeled as âA House of Futures.â Itâs an interactive exhibit where visitors are confronted with the question âhow do you want to live?â\n\nYouâre given a wristband upon entry, which assigns you an avatar. Think of your avatar as âFuture You.â As you go through the exhibit, youâll learn about issues facing humans today (be it fossil fuel usage, medical breakthroughs, etc.) and youâll have to cast your âvoteâ at each station for how you want the future to progress.\n\nAt the end, youâll scan your wristband again and will be treated to a glimpse of the future youâve selected to build. Think of it as a big thought experiment!\n\nTop Attractions in Berlin Mitte\n\nThere are SO many things to do in Berlin-Mitte. Iâve done my best to arrange this section in the order youâd come across the attractions if you were walking straight from Alexanderplatz to the Brandenburg Gate and beyond.\n\nKnow in advance that the two main streets youâll be spending the bulk of your time exploring are Unter den Linden (which has Museum Island, the Brandenburg Gate, and more) and FriedrichstraÃe (Checkpoint Charlie, Palace of Tears, and so on.).\n\nRemember that Iâve provided an interactive map at the very top of this guide, should you want to see where each attraction in Berlin-Mitte is located!\n\nAlexanderplatz\n\nAlexanderplatz is the beating heart of Berlin. When the Berlin Wall stood, Alexanderplatz served as the center of East Berlin, and some of the harsh architecture common in Soviet-controlled states can still be seen around the square today.\n\nThere are quite a few attractions worth seeing here, which Iâve outlined in this very detailed guide to Alexanderplatz. The key places to note are St. Maryâs Church (thereâs a 14th century mural inside), the World Clock (which was erected by the East German government and originally listed the incorrect time zones), and who can overlook the iconic TV tower?\n\nAlexanderplatz: TV Tower\n\nThe TV tower (Fernsehturm) is right up there with the Brandenburg Gate as being the most iconic landmark in Berlin. The TV tower was constructed by the Soviets for a few key reasons:\n\nTo broadcast Soviet-approved TV programs to East Berliners.\n\nTo show the world how technologically advanced the German Democratic Republic was.\n\nTo showcase socialism on a larger scale. (The ball at the top is meant to represent the Soviet space shuttle Sputnik, and it used to light up red at night to represent socialism.)\n\nAdmire the TV tower from the ground, or book skip-the-line tickets in advance to ascend to the top for a rotating view of Berlin from up above.Â\n\nHackescher Markt\n\nOne S-Bahn stop away from Alexanderplatz is Hackescher Markt. Itâs a quirky, fun area to hang out, get a coffee, and window shop.\n\nI suggest visiting Hackescher Markt on a Thursday or Saturday when the market is set up. There are some nice handmade goods for sale, as well as some cheap street food options for lunch.\n\nJust around the corner from Hackescher Markt are the Hackesche HÃ¶fe (shown above), a series of interconnected courtyards with lots of boutiques and shops inside.\n\nNikolaiviertel\n\nThe Nikolaiviertel is the âOld Townâ of Berlin-Mitte, and is in fact the oldest residential area of the entire city. Like much of Berlin, the Nikolaiviertel was destroyed in WWII and wasnât rebuilt until 1987.\n\nBe sure to enter the Nikolai Church while youâre in the area. Thereâs an exhibit on the history of the Nikolaiviertel thatâs quite interesting.\n\nUnter den Linden\n\nUnter den Linden is the cityâs best-known boulevard and is home to some of Berlinâs top attractions.\n\nIâve already mentioned one of the most popular places along Unter den Linden in this guide: Museum Island. Itâs a must-visit place in Berlin-Mitte and I highly recommend it!\n\nUnter den Linden ends with the iconic Brandenburg Gate, one of the symbols of the city. The walk from Museum Island to the Brandenburg Gate is about 1.5km, and youâll see the following sights en route.\n\nUnter den Linden: Berlin Cathedral\n\nThe Berlin Cathedral (Berliner Dom) is a gorgeous Baroque-style cathedral on Museum Island. It costs â¬10 to enter, and your ticket includes access to the nave and an exhibit on the first floor detailing the architectural plans of the church.\n\nYou also get access to the grand dome on the top of the building. Your calves will be burning by the time you reach the top, but the spectacular view of the city is worth it!\n\nIf you need a rest after climbing up to the top of the cathedral, find a grassy spot in the Lustgarten (Pleasure Garden) in front of the church. Itâs a popular hangout spot for visitors and locals alike!\n\nUnter den Linden: Bebelplatz\n\nBebelplatz is one of the most beautiful squares in Berlin-Mitte. Itâs surrounded by architectural gems like the State Opera House (Staatsoper), Hotel de Rome, St. Hedwigâs Cathedral, and the Old Palace (now part of Humboldt University).\n\nSet into the ground in the center of the square is a memorial to the Nazi book burning that took place on this site in May 1933. A huge pile of âun-Germanâ books were burned, and itâs said that the German author Eric KÃ¤stner watched from the crowd as his own novels turned to ash. If you donât know the memorial is there, you might miss it. Look down through the window in the ground into a white room full of empty bookshelves â itâs haunting.\n\nTip: The Hotel de Rome is a luxury hotel located in the former headquarters of the Dresdner Bank. Head to the rooftop bar for a stunning view of Bebelplatz, the TV tower, and Unter den Linden (itâs especially perfect on balmy summer evenings!).\n\nUnter den Linden: Staatsoper\n\nOpera lovers, take note! The State Opera House (Staatsoper) is an elegant building that produces some of the finest operas in Europe. The history of the Staatsoper dates back to the 1740s, when it was initially built for Frederick II as the âKÃ¶nigliche Hofoperâ (Kingâs Court Opera).\n\nThe building you see today is not original to the site (in fact, the Staatsoper was destroyed not once, but twice, in WWII!). However, the opera house retains its Old World opulence and is a spectacular venue to see German classics like The Magic Flute as well as more modern works.\n\nTip: If you live in Berlin and are under 30 years of age, I suggest signing up for the ClassicCard app to score 15 Euro tickets on opera tickets!\n\nUnter den Linden: Neue Wache\n\nThis impressive building was formerly the site of the palace guard house (Neue Wache means New Guardhouse). Today itâs a memorial to the victims of war and tyranny.\n\nFeel free to walk around the interior of the Neue Wache. Itâs a quiet space that encourages reflection.\n\nUnter den Linden: Brandenburg Gate\n\nAfter Alexanderplatz, the top thing to do in Mitte is see the Brandenburg Gate. Iâve lived in the city since 2019 and I still have to pinch myself anytime I walk past the gate!\n\nThe Brandenburg Gate is iconic. It was here that former US President Ronald Regan proclaimed, âMr. Gorbachov, tear down this wall!â in 1987.\n\nDuring the Cold War, East Berlin lay on one side of the gate and West Berlin the other. Today itâs a symbol of unity for Germany and can be found on the 10, 20, and 50 cent Euro coins printed in Germany.\n\nReichstag\n\nThe Reichstag is the seat of the German Bundestag (the national parliament). When you look up at the soaring glass dome of the Reichstag building, know that itâs laden with symbolism.\n\nIn 1933, a raging fire broke out in the Reichstag. The Nazi party claimed that communists were planning to overthrow the government, which led to the passing of a constitutional act that effectively allowed the Nazis to gain complete control of the country.\n\nThe Reichstag wasnât rebuilt until the 1990s, and it was decided that the dome should be rebuilt out of glass to represent Germanyâs desire to move away from its Nazi past towards a future of unity and democracy. Itâs a canât-miss attraction in Berlin-Mitte!\n\nTip: You can tour the dome of the Reichstag for free, but you MUST book your tickets in advance. When you show up for your tour, bring an internationally-recognized form of ID (such as a passport). Give yourself around 90 minutes to complete the self-guided audio tour and take in the epic views from atop the dome.Â For a fee, you can also book a guided tour of the Reichstag (i.e. see more than just the glass dome).\n\nMemorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe\n\nA few blocks down the street from the Brandenburg Gate is the Holocaust Memorial (formally titled The Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe). Itâs made up of more than 2,500 concrete slabs spanning 19,000 square meters.\n\nYouâre welcome to walk in amongst the concrete slabs; youâll notice that as you go deeper into the memorial, the concrete rises up far above your head and causes you to feel like youâre being suffocated â that was intentional and is meant to encourage reflection.\n\nPotsdamer Platz\n\nPotsdamer Platz is a bustling transportation hub in the city center. During the Cold War, the square served as the largest death strip in Berlin â i.e. a no manâs land that neither East or West Berliners could cross without being killed.\n\nPotsdamer Platz isnât the most glamorous of squares, but itâs a good place to know to help orient yourself in Berlin. The annual Berlinale film festival takes place here, and thereâs also a piece of the Berlin Wall on display near the entrance to the underground train station.\n\nIf you have cash to burn, The Mall of Berlin has a bunch of chain stores and some eateries. Another good place to grab lunch near Potsdamer Platz is The Playce, which is a large food hall with a lot of different cuisines represented.\n\nTip: While youâre at Potsdamer Platz, look for the first stoplight in Europe, installed here in 1924 (someone used to sit up top and manually change the lights!).\n\nFriedrichstraÃe\n\nAfter Unter den Linden, FriedrichstraÃe is the most well-known street in Berlin. Itâs not quite as beautiful, but as you walk from the FriedrichstraÃe train station towards Gendarmenmarkt youâll pass a former GDR border check-in hall, Checkpoint Charlie, and more.\n\nEventually youâll come across more restaurants, shops, and a pretty pedestrian zone.\n\nFriedrichstraÃe: Palace of Tears\n\nOne of the more underrated things to do in Berlin-Mitte is visit the former Cold War check-in hall near FriedrichstraÃe Station, called The Palace of Tears (TrÃ¤nenpalast).\n\nWhy âthe Palace of Tears?â Because of the many tearful goodbyes that occurred at this border control point between friends and family who were kept apart by the Berlin Wall.\n\nThe check-in hallâs original structure has been preserved and now houses a free exhibition called âSite of German Division,â which explains how the border crossings between the East and West worked.\n\nFriedrichstraÃe: Dussmann das Kulturkaufhaus\n\nDussman is one of the best local bookstores in Berlin and is where I go when I want a book now and donât mind paying full-price for a new novel. Itâs a massive bookstore with multiple floors and books in various languages (the English and German sections are the largest, but thereâs a smaller international section as well).\n\nThe bookstore is open until midnight during the week and is a great place to go if youâve run out of reading materials for your trip, need a souvenir, or just need to duck inside to escape the rain or cold.\n\nTip: Check out my full list of English bookstores in Berlin if youâre looking for more local gems!\n\nFriedrichstraÃe: Checkpoint Charlie\n\nOne of the most famous places to visit in all of Berlin is Checkpoint Charlie. During the Cold War, Checkpoint Charlie was yet another entry point for people traveling between East and West Germany.\n\nWhat made Checkpoint Charlie so famous, however, was the nail-biting tank standoff that occurred between US and Soviet forces in October 1961. The situation was so tense that there were fears of another World War breaking out.\n\nToday Checkpoint Charlie feels quite touristy, but itâs a worthwhile thing to see in Mitte. Thereâs a small museum on the site as well, which isnât a âmustâ for me (you can learn similar information for free at the Palace of Tears, which I previously mentioned in this post).\n\nFriedrichstraÃe: âThe Wallâ Panorama\n\nâDie Mauerâ is a moving 1:1 scale panorama designed by artist Yadegar Asisi. The panorama shows you the perspective of a West Berliner in Kreuzberg looking over the Wall, into the death strip.\n\nThe panorama can be viewed from atop a 4-meter high viewing platform in the center of the room.Â (Book your ticket here.)\n\nTip: Yadegar Asisi also has a Panorama on Museum Island associated with the Pergamon Museum thatâs fantastic, so know that his panoramas ARE worth the money!\n\nGendarmenmarkt\n\nOne of the prettiest squares in Berlin, Gendarmenmarkt was once a site of refuge for French Protestants seeking refuge from the Catholic French government in the 17th century.\n\nGendarmenmarkt is known for its two identical cathedrals â the German Cathedral (Deutscher Dom) and the French Cathedral (FranzÃ¶sischer Dom) â that face each other across opposite sides of the square. Inside the German Cathedral, youâll find a free exhibit on the history of the German parliament.\n\nBetween the cathedrals is the stunning Concert Hall (Konzerthaus) that was designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The interior is gorgeous, and is yet another wonderful venue for classical music in Berlin.\n\nNote that Gendarmenmarkt is currently undergoing construction. Itâs projected to last through 2024.\n\nRausch Schokoladenhaus\n\nIf you need a break from the museums, historic sites, and other tourist attractions in Mitte, might I suggest recharging with a healthy dose of chocolate from Rausch? Raush Schockoladenhaus is one of the oldest chocolate shops in the city, and is my personal favorite in Berlin.\n\nOn the ground floor of the store, youâll find more than 200 varieties of chocolates, truffles, and pralines for sale (but a premade bundle or pick and choose your chocolates individually).\n\nThereâs also a deli at street level selling takeaway hot chocolate and other treats, but I prefer heading to the very top floor to sip my creamy hot chocolate in peace. Rausch offers three different kinds of hot chocolate (43%, 60%, or 70% cacao), and youâre welcome to add whipped cream, a shot of alcohol such as amaretto, and flavorings like chili and orange.\n\nOranienburger StraÃe\n\nOranienburger StraÃe is yet another popular shopping street in Berlin-Mitte, close to Museum Island. Mitte attractions along this street include Monbijoupark, the 19th century New Synagogue (which can be toured with a guide), and the former royal post office at the intersection of TucholskystraÃe.\n\nOranienburger StraÃe is generally a nice street to wander down if youâre looking for a bite to eat or want to shop at local boutiques.\n\nOranienburger StraÃe: Tadshikische Teestube\n\nA lesser known thing to do in Berlin-Mitte is experience Russian Samovar at the Tajikistan Tea Room (Tadshikische Teestube). The tea house was originally built as the Tajikistan pavilion at a Leipzig trade fair in 1974, but itâs since been moved to its current location off of Oranienburger StraÃe.\n\nThe Samovar experience includes a very strong pot of black tea, which you dilute with hot water and sip between nibbles of marzipan or candied fruit. A shot of vodka is provided for you to sip as a palate cleanser between cups of tea.\n\nCome with a friend or family, and make a reservation in advance if you plan on visiting over the weekend.\n\nBerlin Wall Memorial\n\nThe Berlin Wall Memorial is located near the Nordbahnhof train station and showcases 1.4km-long piece of the original Berlin Wall. Both the wall itself as well as the border strip surrounding it have been preserved, and the open-air exhibits detailing the history of the Wall are free to enter.\n\nThe Nordbahnhof train station contains additional free exhibits that share the history of the train station during the Cold War and the various escape attempts that were made on the site.\n\nBabylon Theater\n\nA completely underrated attraction in Berlin-Mitte is Babylon Theater. It was built in 1929 as a silent movie theater, and is now the oldest movie theater in the world that still houses its own orchestra.\n\nYou can see a variety of films at the Babylon, but itâs best known for its silent film showings. If Fritz Langâs Metropolis is showing while youâre in Berlin, I highly recommend booking tickets. Itâs considered to be one of the most influential movies ever made, and seeing it with a live orchestra is a unique experience you wonât get anywhere else!\n\nFlea Markets in Berlin Mitte\n\nFlea markets are incredibly popular in Berlin, and there are some great ones that open every weekend in Mitte. For additional recommendations on the best flea markets in Berlin in general, click the link to read my full guide.\n\nArkonaplatz\n\nOn Sundays from 10am, quaint Arkonaplatz is transformed into a flea market. Itâs a smaller market thatâs popular with locals (many visitors overlook Arkonaplatz in favor of the larger, better known Mauerpark Flea Market nearby).\n\nExpect to find small home decor items, servingware, DDR relics, and so forth at the Arkonaplatz flea market.\n\nAntique and Book Market at the Bode Museum\n\nOne of my favorite flea markets in Mitte can be found near the Bode Museum (on Museum Island). This flea market primarily sells antique books, but there are some newer titles as well (although you have to do some rummaging to find the gems hidden amongst the stacks).\n\nYouâll also find plenty of antique and vintage knick knacks, vinyl records, and small decor items for sale. The flea market at the Bode Museum is open on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nBerlin Art Market (Berliner Kunstmarkt am Zeughaus)\n\nOn Saturdays and Sundays from 11am, the street between the German Historical Museum and the Spree River is turned into a bustling art market. Itâs not a flea market per se, but rather an outdoor art market where artists of various mediums sell their work.\n\nThis is a wonderful market to visit if youâre looking for a more unique souvenir to remember your trip to Berlin. You can find handmade paintings, photos, graphics, postcards, and more here.\n\nGreen Spaces & Parks in Berlin Mitte\n\nOne of the things I love most about Berlin is how green the city is! Mitte has quite a few parks, and my favorites can be found below.\n\nTiergarten\n\nAt the end of Unter den Linden, across from the Brandenburg Gate, youâll see lots and lots of trees. Thatâs the beautiful Tiergarten. It was formerly the royal hunting grounds and was opened to the public in the 1830s.\n\nAt the heart of the park, in a massive roundabout, youâll find the SiegesÃ¤ule (Victory Column). For a few Euros, you can ascend the spiral staircase within the column to see the Tiergarten and surrounding cityscape from above.\n\nMonbijoupark and James-Simon Park\n\nMonbijoupark and James-Simon Park are small but popular parks on the banks of the Spree River. Although theyâre technically two separate parks, theyâre right next to each other and it feels like theyâre part of the same one!\n\nThese two parks are located just off of Museum Island, and on warm summer nights youâll be hard pressed to find a spot to sit amongst the locals sipping beer, chatting with friends, and listening to music.\n\nTip: Monbijoupark is also one of my favorite spots to see cherry blossoms in the spring!\n\nVolkspark am Weinberg\n\nOnce the site of a vineyard, the Volkspark am Weinberg is now a small park in the middle of the city. If your hotel or AirBNB is near the Volkspark, definitely come here whenever you need to rest your feet.\n\nThereâs a small pond in the middle of the park thatâs surrounded by cherry blossom trees, and pretty cafes and bookstores can be found around the park.\n\nWhere to Eat & Drink in Berlin Mitte\n\nAt the point, Iâve already written a literal novella about all the things there are to do in Mitte so Iâll keep my restaurant recommendations short and sweet. Leave me a comment at the end of this post if thereâs a different type of cuisine youâre craving, and Iâll be happy to give you some more tailored restaurant recs!\n\nFather Carpenter (MÃ¼nzstr 21) â Popular Australian-style brunch spot with good coffee, eggs, and breakfast bits. Gets busy on the weekend!\n\nZeit fÃ¼r Brot (Alte SchÃ¶nhauser Str. 4) â Incredible grab-and-go local bakery chain that sells my favorite cinnamon buns in the city.\n\nBanh Mi Stable (Schendelgasse 9) â â¬6 Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches. There are only three sandwiches on the menu and no sides. Great budget-friendly lunch option.\n\nFrea Bakery (GartenstraÃe 9) â An all-vegan bakery and cafe. Iâm not vegan, and I genuinely can never tell that the food is vegan based on taste alone. The pastries in particular are unreal!\n\nMagic Johnâs (Oranienburger Str. 48) â New York-style slice shop selling pizza by the slice. Cheap, fast, delicious!\n\nCurry 61 (Oranienburger Str. 6) â The place in Berlin-Mitte to try currywurst.\n\nHofbrÃ¤u Wirtshaus Berlin (Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 30) â A Bavarian beer hall chain tha serves classic German fare. Think: bratwurst, potato dumplings, and schnitzel.\n\nWhat Do You Fancy Love? (LinienstraÃe 41) â Local Berlin cafe that has excellent coffee, chai lattes, and small bites.\n\nPho Co (Rosa-Luxemburg-StraÃe 20) â No-frills Vietnamese place with good food at lower prices.\n\nHave Fun Exploring Mitte!\n\nIf youâve actually read through this full guide on what to do in Mitte, congratulations. You basically just read a book.\n\nMitte is jam-packed with attractions and thereâs lots here to fill your visit to Berlin.
