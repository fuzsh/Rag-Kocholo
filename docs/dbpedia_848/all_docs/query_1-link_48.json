As part of workshops, performances and showcases, 18 creative minds from all over the world will present their pioneering projects and ideas at the Radialsystem from 2 to 4 August. rom more than 1,100 applications worldwide, the six mentors of the Forecast Edition 2024/25 have each invited three nominees to present their artistic projects to a broad audience at the Forecast Forum at the beginning of August. Over three days, boundaries between disciplines and genres will be challenged, questioned and transcended through performances and innovative artistic strategies in an exchange between mentors and the 18 nominees. At the end of the forum, the mentors will each select a project that they will … Continue reading the article on DEEDS.NEWS.

Seating, bar tables and – most importantly – the bar are spread out under the colonnades on the Spree side and create an opportunity to linger. The idea of a place for stimulating conversation, informal get-togethers and good drinks has a long tradition on the Museum Island. As early as the end of the 19th century, a drinking hall opened under the colonnades on the Spree, which survived until the 1930s. This year, the seventh edition of the Kolonnaden Bar is dedicated to … Continue reading the article on DEEDS.NEWS IMage above: copyrights: Staatliche Museen zu Berlin / Markus Glahn\n\nThe KVOST SchauFenster presents vases from the 1950s and 1960s from Heiner Körting’s ceramic workshop. Beyond their functionality as utensils, they are also artistic objects. Dark in color and coated with a layer of engobe, they also feature a light brown pattern that is graphic but not rigid. This relationship of loose regularity is typical of Körting ceramics. The vessels are rectilinear, but based on organic forms, with an ornamental structure worked into the surface through incising or relief. Heiner Hans Körting (1911 in Munich – 1991) took over the Bauhaus workshop in Dornburg in 1949. Lisa Körting (1926 in Merseburg – 2009) joined in 1955, after the two married, and had a decisive influence on the work in the workshop. Together they were among the leading ceramic artists in the GDR. The shape of the objects exhibited at KVOST was designed by Heiner Körting. The designs for the decoration of the vases, on the other hand, were … Continue reading the article on DEEDS.NEWS. Image above: Ceramics from the Heiner Körting workshop / Photo: Valentin Wedde\n\nuntil 31.08. | #4361ARTatBerlin | Galerie SCHMALFUSS BERLIN shows from 03. August 2024 the exhibition “Poetische Malerei versus expressive Bildhauerkunst” with paintings by Michel Meyer und Hans Scheib. MICHEL MEYER wrote about the content of his painting in 1999: “My painting is not just a game with colors, pencils and material to obtain heads, figures and their fragments and relationships. […] Through the ongoing process of painting, all thoughts disposed of in the picture disappear and transform themselves caterpillar-like into beautiful and humorous things. Into stories with an open ending.” Experiences full of emotional emotion are reflected in HANS SCHEIB’s legendary sculptures. His wooden sculptures in particular, with their rugged surface treatment, represent snapshots of extreme excitement – from moments of shock to self-awareness. For health reasons, HANS SCHEIB has been unable to work with wood since 2023. His work now focuses on bronzes. MICHEL MEYER, Die große Kurve | Acryl auf Leinwand, 100 x 100 cm, 2020 The exhibition MICHEL MEYER | HANS SCHEIB once again offers a range of bronze and wood sculptures by the sculptor HANS SCHEIB, who was influenced by Berlin Realism and German Expressionism and is much sought-after by collectors.

September 2024 the group exhibition Ghost Image by the artists Alexander Basil, Pablo Bronstein, Elijah Burgher, Michael Buthe, Daniel Correa Mejía, Anders Dickson, Hervé Guibert, Christoph Hänsli, Almut Heise, Hortensia Mi Kafchin, Pierre Klossowski, Sholem Krishtalka, Karen Lamassonne, Jannis Marwitz, Piotr Nathan, Paul P., Maaike Schoorel, Helen Verhoeven, Amelie von Wulffen. The exhibition Ghost Image takes the example of Guibert’s intimacy with his mother as a starting point to question the representation of the self beyond the grasp of an image, one that is fueled by the depiction of memory and loss and rendered through the lens of painting. With each of the many artists responding to this subject in his or her own way, the show presents a testament to the complexities of self-presentation and, in particular, questions the understanding of memory and depiction. The French author and photographer Hervé Guibert once wrote “My body, due to the effects of lust or pain, has entered a state of theatricality, of climax, that I would like to reproduce in any matter possible: by photo, by video, by audio recording. It’s a laboratory that I offer up as a performance…”. He […]\n\nuntil 28.08. | #4359ARTatBerlin | Luisa Catucci Gallery (Brunnenstraße) shows from 16. August 2024 the exhibition Untitled (back when we met) by the artists Nitsan Margaliot and Antoine Mermet. “ Untitled (back when we met)”, presents the collaborative work of Nitsan Margaliot and Antoine Mermet. Their work relates to various queer meetings in private and public spaces using video, textile, text, sound, and performance. The exhibition revolves around two performances, Unfolded and We Met, as well as two screenings — This Gentle Moment and a diary. The exhibition holds testimonies and traces related to encounters around the bed and the weight it carries, exploring intimacy and queer trajectories. Nitsan Margaliot is a choreographer, dancer, and curator deeply engaged with queer archives, re-enactments, and vulnerable encounters. Antoine Mermet is a versatile musician, composer, improviser, and multidisciplinary artist,active in dance, theater, visual arts, and performance. Opening: Friday, 16. August 2024 6 – 10 pm.

July 2024 an art presentation of 15 selected works from Thomas Hoepker’s oeuvre. With the death of Thomas Hoepker, the gallery has lost one of the most important German photographers in history, but above all Hoepker the man, whom it represented for more than 20 years and presented at exhibitions and art fairs. It comprises 15 selected works by the photographer. In addition to his portraits of boxing legend Muhammad Ali, photographs by Andy Warhol and works from Hoepker’s “Berlin Wall Children” series will also be on display. Thomas Hoepker (1936-2024) gained his first experience with the medium of photography at the age of 14. He received two Photokina awards during his studies and from 1959 worked regularly as an advertising photographer for magazines and book publications. He devoted himself to photojournalism and later also became interested in the moving image, shooting films and working as a cameraman. In 1974, he was the first accredited photographer to go to East Berlin for Stern magazine, where he worked temporarily as art director. In 1989, Thomas Hoepker became the first German photographer to become a full member of the Magnum Photos agency […]\n\nuntil 19.09. | #4356ARTatBerlin | Galerie Gilla Lörcher shows from 16. July 2024 the exhibition LETTRES MORTES by the artist John Cornu. Galerie Gilla Loercher presents the 5th solo show by French artist John Cornu. John Cornu spent several months in Okinawa as part of a residency fellowship at the Nanjo Art Museum (Japan) in 2022. The results of his residency and research trip will be presented in the exhibition LETTRES MORTES during the BERLIN ART WEEK at Galerie Gilla Loercher. John Cornu (born in 1976, lives and works in Paris and Renes) works with an inherited from Minimalism and Modernism (monochromy, seriality, modularity, the primacy of the materials), while maintaining a relation to (historical, architectural, societal) context and a form of contemporary Romanticism (Dionysianism, erosion, blindness, references to different sonic universes, and entropy). With an interest for modern ruins, logics of power, and anthropological gaps, the artist imbues his productions with an atmosphere at once poetic, cathartic and without compromise. Whether sculptural, performative, or installation-based, they address forces, setting up a multiplicity of meanings and readings. John Cornu‘s work has been shown in numerous solo and group shows at: Institut Giacometti (Paris, FR), Palais de Tokyo and Maison rouge (Paris, FR), […]\n\nbis 26.10. | #4352ARTatBerlin | Meyer Riegger presents from 14th September 2024 the exhibition Le Rhin by the artist Caroline Bachmann. If one begins the exhibition tour on the first floor and then goes down to the ground floor, one follows the course of the river from Reichenau to Rotterdam. Caroline Bachmann travelled along the river twice for her Rhine series. Together, the 24 paintings create a portrait of the river from different perspectives. As if you were looking through the porthole of a ship, through a telescope or a keyhole, Bachmann frames her depictions of the Rhine in round frames. 24 views of the Rhine are not a lot when you compare this number with the number of pictures of Lake Geneva that Bachmann has painted to date. The decision to start painting landscapes in the 2000s, as Bachmann did at the time, certainly took courage. During her trips along the Rhine, she produced around 100 sketches, from which she selected 24 and turned them into paintings in her studio in Cully. While landscape painters such as Ferdinand Hodler or Giovanni Segantini always painted plein air, i.e. in the open air, Bachmann preferred to go into her “cave”, as […]\n\nuntil 09.08. | #4350ARTatBerlin | Galerie Gilla Lörcher shows from 02.

Galerie Gilla Loercher is very pleased to present the Summer exhibition with artists of the gallery.

July 2024 the group exhibition Zeichnung heute. The exhibition brings together thirteen graphic positions from more than fifty years. Arnulf Rainer, 1980, Klimt-Aktüberzeichnung, Ölkreide und Graphit, 25 x 35 cm The medium of paper as an essential carrier of artistic images has a tradition going back well over a thousand years. Drawing in the narrower sense has also gained in importance since the Renaissance, often as an autonomous work of art. Jack Sal, White/Wash, Memorial, Kielce 2003 This applies in full to the further development of art. However, the idea of reducing drawing to its serving function and defining it as a sketch, draft, notation and the like, always referring to its spontaneity, persists to this day. Sharka Hyland, Else Lasker-Schüler, Styx, 2023, Bleistift auf Papier, 30,4 x 40,5 cm und Detail Not only are works on paper generally extremely important in modernism, as the works of almost all important artists show, but drawing itself also receives the greatest attention today, which it has always deserved. Its history cannot be written here, but George Seurat must be mentioned (and it is precisely in this context that the above quote stands). […]\n\nuntil 31.08. | #4348ARTatBerlin | Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery Berlin shows from 18. July 2024 the duo-exhibition When Dusk Falls by the artists Jamie Luoto and Tonia Nneji. “When Dusk Falls”, the duo exhibition of paintings by Jamie Luoto and Tonia Nneji at Kristin Hjellegjerde Gallery Berlin, explores the complex psychological effects of trauma in relation to the female body and the potential of art as a powerful form of revelation and resistance. Jamie Luoto’s paintings form part of an ongoing investigation into her own experience of complex post-traumatic stress disorder. Drawing on the occult and horror genre, she uses a symbolic visual language to make visible unseen symptoms of sexual abuse such as flashbacks, nightmares, dissociation, and intrusive thoughts. While Luoto typically works with self-portraiture, for this exhibition she has also created a series of smaller, still lifes that explore the ways in which our internal experience can bleed into and alter our perception of the world around us. For instance, in Are You Good Men and True? a white porcelain cat becomes both a surrogate for the female figure, pushed into a corner, and a figure of authority, passing judgment on the ‘men’, who are alluded to through condoms, a recurring […]\n\nuntil 10.08. | #4347ARTatBerlin | Jarmuschek + Partner shows from 09. July 2024 (Opening: 06.07.) the exhibition HALF LIGHT by the artist Majla Zeneli. Diffuse blurs, geometric-abstract forms and complex collages – Majla Zeneli repeatedly uses the almost forgotten technique of mezzotint to create touching visual worlds that immerse the viewer, encouraging them to linger and think further. In the interplay of patterns, layers and variables, the artist focuses on light in her latest works. Contrasts of light and dark, black and white in all their facets and fusions through to text passages and letters lead into a multi-layered meditation on emptiness, the hidden, origins and eternities. Opening: Saturday, 06. July 2024, 4 – 8 pm Exhibition dates: Tuesday, 09. July 2024 until Saturday, 10. August 2024 Title image caption: MAJLA ZENELI, o.T.

September 2024 the exhibition “Reciting from memory” by the artist Pablo Benzo. Pablo Benzo’s new series, which will be on display in the Reciting from Memory exhibition in September, focuses on surreal, cubist three-dimensional picture-in-picture constructions. This technique enables him to depict objects and landscapes in a multi-layered and profound way. The main motifs of his paintings are clearly defined, clearly delineated in terms of colour and form, and combine unusual objects and themes that leave a contrasting impression in their constellation. These contrasts invite the viewer to reflect on their memories and feelings and to make a personal connection through the subtle references in the paintings. Opening: Thursday, 12. September 2024, 6 – 9 pm Exhibition dates: Thursday, 12. September 2024 until Friday, 25.

September 2024 the exhibition London by the artist Christopher Lehmpfuhl. The exhibition Christopher Lehmpfuhl: London presents for the first time the works of Berlin plein air painter Christopher Lehmpfuhl, which the artist painted on the streets of the British capital in the footsteps of the Impressionists. Accompanied by Mamuka Bliadze and Patrick Bence-Trower from the KORNFELD Gallery Berlin, Lehmpfuhl’s journey has resulted in a collection of new paintings and watercolours that capture the essence of London and combine painterly traditions with the artist’s own style.

Letizia Werth is interested in drawing and its materiality as well as in the relationship between drawing and other media such as photography and video. Under the title “Shadow Flowers”, she summarises a series of monochrome works in which she transforms images of found anonymous — “lost” — photographs from private living spaces onto canvas in graphite and ink. In the process of leaving the photographic model, categories such as space, time, fiction and reality come to light in all their fragility. Letizia Werth, Ohne Titel, Graphit,Tusche auf Molino, 60 x 80cm, 2019 ©LWerth “Drawing is an immediate process of assimilation and digestion […]. It is comparable to the flow of air when breathing in and out, pausing and letting go, and that is exactly how I stop time for a few moments and move into new pictorial worlds.” Letizia Werth has studied the influence of various media on perception in depth, from photography and video to X-rays and séances.

Galerie Z22 presents the exhibition “ARTISTIC STEPS” by Immanuel Rohringer and Frank Massholder. Frank Massholder and Immanuel Rohringer dedicate themselves to the accidental beauty of floors in large series that have been running for years and are still unfinished today. While the art photographer and gallery owner Massholder finds his motifs during visits to his artists’ studios, the visual artist Rohringer creates them in experimental and open processes. FRANK MASSHOLDER | LANDAUER #4 | 2023 | UV.DRUCK AUF ALUDIBOND BUTLERFINISH Massholder calls his discoveries “concrete coincidences” and has been consistently “collecting” such “deliberate photographs of accidentally created objects” for years. In his words, the floors of artists’ studios are “snapshots of an artist’s inner landscape over the course of time. They are a collection of movements, colours, splashes, pieces of inspiration from each individual work that unintentionally document the artist’s work as a whole.” IMMANUEL ROHRINGER | ARTISTIC STEPS | 1/30 | 2023 | MISCHTECHNIK AUF LEINWAND | 200 x 185 For him, such studio floors are “canvases that guide us through time and perhaps give […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4340ARTatBerlin | ZWINGER Galerie shows from 06. July 2024 (Vernissage: 05.07.) the exhibition Identities by the artist Susi Pop. SUSI POP is me claims the model. “Flaubert is me,” says Madame Bovary, and without further ado, she sets herself up as the author of her own character. Flaubert has understood this and is wary of any moral or other kind of judgment. Omai (Mai), Polynesian prince (around 1751-1780), brought to England by Captain Cook in 1775, was introduced to “the highest circles” there and presented to members of the Royal Society and George III as a “noble savage”. The life-size portrait of Omai in antique garb painted by Joshua Reynolds in 1776 is unironically regarded as an “important British cultural asset”. Long privately owned, the painting appeared on the art market at regular intervals, each time experiencing an extreme price increase. In 2023, it was “secured” for the National Portrait Gallery with the involvement of the Getty Foundation. Blue Boy Arkhom. Inspired by Gainsborough’s “Blue Boy”, Arkhom grabs a hat and poses in front of the famous painting in the SUSI POP version, imitating its courtly gesture. A double travesty.

Me and my castle: Max Grote presents his latest works in his debut solo show “Me and my castle”. In it, the Potsdam-based artist explore his identity, fashion and gender as well as spaces, castles and palaces. Image caption: Ich und meine Burg, 220×170, Öl, raedy-made auf Baumwoll e, 2024 With the exhibition title, Grote wants to make a statement as an unknown in the art world.

Images from 7 October, from Palestine, Haiti and the Ukraine, which we reflexively close our eyes to, gain a new visibility in his paintings. The works that Theuerkauff juxtaposes with his political paintings would also have been unthinkable two years ago: The Berlin city views under his private address and the picturesque, flooded landscapes have their origins in the AI.

The German artist studied at the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe and is considered an important figure in the European tradition of sculpture. He has received prestigious awards such as the Prize for Drawing at the III Biennial of Contemporary Art, Vila Nova de Cerveira, Portugal (1982), the Joan Miró International Prize for Drawing, Barcelona (1986) and the Grand Prize at the II International Biennial of Sculpture in Obidos, Portugal (1989). From 1989-1990 Schad held a guest professorship at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart. Today he lives and works in Larians-et-Munans in France and in Chamosinhos in Portugal. He is known for his large installations in public spaces. Schad’s works combine two forms of design: Drawing and sculpture.

Galerie Thomas Schulte presents Richard Deacon’s upcoming exhibition About Us in the Corner Space. The show brings together the artist’s fundamental mediums of drawing and sculpture, featuring two works: an almost life-size steel sculpture along with an intricate black and white wall drawing. While both works showcase his mastery of materials and mediums, they also offer a unique glimpse into two decades of Deacon’s analytical form language and innovative artistry.

Robert Mapplethorpe’s photographs of flowers are well known, and recognizable for their delicate yet erotic beauty. What is less discussed is the role of the specific set of objects often appearing within their carefully constructed compositions. Frequently drawn from the artist’s collection, the vases and bowls found in these still lifes reveal a deep appreciation for design – reflecting the confident eye and regard for classical form exemplified by his photographic work. It is the connection between the two, that forms the starting point of Behold the Lowly Vessel. Presented at Galerie Thomas Schulte, the exhibition takes a distinctive point of view, bringing thoughtful arrangements of Mapplethorpe’s photographs together with a private collection of vases inspired by them.

Peres Projects presents Bloom, the fourth solo exhibition by Rafa Silvares (b. 1984 in Santos, BR) at the gallery and his second in Berlin. ‘[…] His latest works are defined by a clear, sharp and reduced vocabulary of colour and everyday objects. Assertive compositions of red, green and blue architectures mingle with realistic images of ordinary reflective objects, painted in such a way that they could be photographs, with flowers or cloudy forms of liquids. In his work, these soft forms appear as water, air, vapour, fire, smell, cream. The tension between the shiny parts and the abstract forms embodies a tension between physical phenomena and emotional power. These are the parts you can identify with the most; you can almost feel, smell and touch the texture of Silvares’ paintings, get close to them in their bubbling, round, full, spherical, sensual waves of sensation. Or there are the tubular curtains, vertical waves of soft, velvety fabric. His works gain movement and warmth through such parts. There is no one in these scenes.

Galerie Tanja Wagner presents the second solo exhibition by Anna Steinert: Was am Tiefsten in der Welt liegt. While Steinert undertook an exploratory journey into the transcendence of the imaginative power in her first solo exhibition Wanderings, she now turns her attention to what surrounds us on, above and below the earth. The title of her exhibition, which features video, sculpture and paintings, is based on Emanuele Coccia’s The Roots of the World – an essay that helps us to understand plants as creators of the world, the vital basis of existence, mediators between sun and earth and living beings of equal value with hidden bodies in the ground. In her new 3-channel video installation Erdemojies – Forscher*innen der Mischung, Steinert brings in reinforcements: The performers and fellow artists Monika Michalko, Nschotschi Haslinger, Cora Saller, Katharina Duve, Hanna Matthes, Helena Ratka, Sophie Labrey and Helena Wittmann (camera) appear as naturalists, healers and superheroes who, in an experimental and playful approach, accompanied by darkly wavering electro sounds and drums, summon nature and elemental forces with the common […]\n\nuntil 03.08. | #4331ARTatBerlin | Contemporary Fine Arts presents from 22nd June 2024 (Vernissage: 21st June) the exhibition Flugelhorns by the artist Ellen Berkenblit. Contemporary Fine Arts presents Flugelhorns, the first solo-exhibition from Ellen Berkenblit in the gallery and the first of the artist in Germany. On display are paintings and drawings featuring female figures that dominate much of the canvas, gazing not at the viewer but at something or someone within their own realm, the specifics of which remain obscure to us. The figures are never centered; instead, they are slightly off-balance, drawing attention only to deflect it. Cut out from their surroundings and cropped out of context, their emotional states become the main story. Complex, innate emotions manifest through paint, while the relationships between characters shape the composition. Somewhat of a rarity for Berkenblit, the women are not entirely isolated from their stories but appear alongside others, and in addition to tigers, horses, and birds, one gets a glimpse of motherhood, sisterhood, friendship, or perhaps even its opposite; the dynamics of their relationships are contained within the expressive brushstrokes and muted colors. For Berkenblit, the canvas is a world in which she strives for balance, but the laws […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4330ARTatBerlin | WENTRUP presents from 28th June 2024 the exhibition Tempo Primo by the artist Thomas Wachholz. An English riddle, which gained popularity around 1900, presents a predicament: “A man walks into a dark room. He has a match in his hand. In the dim light, he can make out three objects: a candle, a fireplace, and a kerosene lamp. The question is, which should he light first?” Against all expectations, the three objects, which can provide either light or warmth, are not the primary concern. The overlooked fact is that the answer is already in his hand. Without striking the match, he cannot light anything else. Throughout his artistic career, Thomas Wachholz has handled many matches, even entire series of them. For “Tempo Primo”, these matches join brushes and other utensils that Wachholz has used in recent years for his deep exploration into the possibilities of pictorial creation. At times, the matches have served as a model, a motif, a subject matter, or even a tool in this practical relationship. Wachholz’s paintings consistently showcase his fascination with matchboxes and matchbooks. This fascination stems from their iconicity, practicality, the chemical processes of ignition, and ultimately, fire. The […]\n\nuntil 17.08 | #4329ARTatBerlin | Haverkampf Leistenschneider shows from 21st June 2024 the exhibition NEUE WELT by the artist Stefan Hirsig. In a restless exchange of movement, gesture and texture, Stefan Hirsig‘s work has always questioned what painting is capable of and what abstraction can be. Integrating a rich pool of references from classical and modern painting, pop culture and today’s oversaturated media, his dynamic compositions bear witness to the hyper-connected, always-on cacophony of our present moment. Yet Hirsig’s imagery resists quick consumption. If you look long enough, you’ll discover a processual logic: marks made like chess moves, a series of calculated responses, both destructive and creative; sometimes in opposition, sometimes in dance. In Neue Welt, Hirsig reflects on the endless cycle of global conflicts and wars that break out, subside, and escalate again without permanent resolve, keeping our world in a state of constant anxiety. The artist observes that everywhere we look, the leaders of these conflicts are almost always men. Why do so many despotic, egotistical men dominate world affairs? he asks. Is masculinity the driving force behind the world’s cycle of violence? These conflicts are not perpetuated in the name of caution or protection, but rather masculinity at its worst: […]\n\nuntil 17.08. | #4328ARTatBerlin | CAMERA WORK shows from 8th June 2024 a solo exhibition by the artist Dean Wests. Galerie CAMERA WORK shows Dean West’s first solo exhibition in Germany from 8th June, 2024. The exhibition comprises over 20 predominantly large-format works from a decade of the conceptual artist’s work as well as a short film. Alongside other photographs created in 2024, this will be shown in an exhibition for the first time worldwide. CAMERA WORK represents the artist in Europe as the main gallery. The exhibition shows elaborately conceived, serial works from the oeuvre of the artist Dean West – including photographs from the latest series “American West” and “The Palms”, which deal with cowboy culture in the USA and scenically condense facets of everyday life in Florida. This also includes the figure of the lone wolf, which two of West’s works depict using different storytelling techniques. The monochrome photographs in the series are presented across two exhibition rooms. In these atmospheric works, West stages motionless moments removed from time. They are theatrically charged fragments of narratives that are structured by means of color and clear symmetry. The exhibition also provides insights into “Pink Dreams” and “New York”, […]\n\nuntil 18.07. | #4327ARTatBerlin | Raab Galerie presents from 22nd June 2024 (Vernissage: 21.06) the exhibition Me, myself and Ei by the artist Björn Heyn. it is not necessary to explain Björn Heyn’s works, they are beautiful and mysterious, full of temptation. While I look at a variety of forms, colours and hints, paintings come to my mind that are known to me: A quarter of a century ago the works of Picasso and Matisse were celebrated in exhibitions all over the world as represetative of the spirit of the twentieth century. At that time Björn Heyn was still a child. Today, he adds to these images Fernand Léger and uses words as images, to find out what could best be done with it to create a contemporary painting. The reaction of the observers is prompt: These works are loveable, subtle, colourful and stimulating. They are an interesting company at home to think about life. Painting always existed, even in times of political correctness, when dualism between politics and culture did not exist anymore. While paintings don’t explain things to you, they enlighten your thinking. As the great Swiss philosopher Jean Starobinski explains, enlightenment saves us from danger. Very often, […]\n\nuntil 02.08. | #4325ARTatBerlin | AOA;87 contemporary shows from 28. June 2024 (Vernissage: 27.06.) the exhibition 層 | Layering the Void by the artist Noriko Ambe. AOA;87 presents the exhibition “層 | Layers of Emptiness” by Japanese artist Noriko Ambe, renowned for her intricate white-on-white paper cuttings, displayed as wall reliefs, free-standing sculptures, and installations. The exhibition is accompanied by video works from video artist Mami Kosemura. Noriko Ambe, No. 1 Curtain piece, Tracking through the curtain, 2022, Cut on Yupo paper, 160 cm x 10 m Noriko Ambe (*1967, Saitama) creates delicate, sculptural works through her “Linear-Actions” series, which began in 1999, by meticulously cutting and layering hundreds to thousands of sheets of paper. These works evoke topographic and organic forms, with fine lines reminiscent of tree rings. These lines represent not only the physical structure of the paper but also a metaphorical journey through time. Each cut and layer symbolizes a past moment, with the cross-sections representing instances within the countless layers of time that permeate the existence of a work.

Heiner Franzen has been collecting non-verbal video material from ANCHORS, presenters of international news programmes, for over ten years. In these video loops, Franzen focuses on the moment when someone is silent in the broadcast – be it because of a malfunction or because he or she is allowing guests to discuss. He further developed the extensive source material into For his first solo exhibition with EBENSPERGER Berlin – Hachmeister takes up the fragile physicality of being human, which is expressed in a strange domesticity full of subtle humour and sensuality, thus creating a counterpoint to the raw architecture of the Fichtebunker.

June 2024 the exhibition Twilight is a Place of Promise with works by 19 artists. Participating artists: Eileen Agar, Bettina von Arnim, Merikokeb Berhanu, Huguette Caland, Caroline Coon, Hélène Delprat, Bracha L. Ettinger, Roey Victoria Heifetz, Andrea Joyce Heimer, Monilola Olayemi Ilupeju, Kamala Ibrahim Ishag, Pia Krajewski, Jinju Lee, Iva Lulashi, Isabel Nolan, Pan Yuliang, Isabel Quintanilla, Anys Reimann, and Cecilia Vicuña. Esther Schipper is delighted to present Twilight is a Place of Promise featuring the work of 19 international artists born between 1895 and 1996. The exhibition offers a perspective on the politics of image-making— personal, social, political, historical—taking painting and the artists’ diverse approaches to the practice as its focus. It is partisan in its polysemy, insistent only on the confluence of nuance and power. Emerging three years after the gallery’s 2021 exhibition L‘Invitation au voyage, which invoked the freedom of imaginary travel in the form of fantasy or dreams, Twilight is a Place of Promise presents works of painters that look beyond conventional categorizations of subject and object, external and internal worlds. The works in the exhibition imagine spaces of inwardness, spirituality, and shared humanity, with […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4323ARTatBerlin | Galerie Georg Nothelfer shows from 22. June 2024 the exhibition In diesem Jahr kacken die Störche anders by the artist Thomas Hartmann. Galerie Georg Nothelfer presents a solo exhibition of works by the Berlin painter Thomas Hartmann (*1950). The show includes works from the 1980s to the present day. Thomas Hartmann’s paintings paradoxically embody both a sense of order and a chaotic liveliness. Known since the 1980s for his expressive, impasto landscapes and cityscapes, his work is characterized by a meticulous attention to detail and an almost obsessive inclusion of numerous small figures and elements. The resulting effect is reminiscent of late Gothic hidden object paintings, inviting viewers to explore the narrative richness of each individual work. Hartmann’s scenes have a timeless quality, as if they dissolve the boundaries between past, present and future. This temporal ambiguity invites us to reconsider our own place in the continuum of time and space. (Text excerpt by Nicola E. Petek) Vernissage: Friday, 21.

Hugo Wilson has chosen “The Raft” as title for his upcoming Berlin exhibition. Of course, this immediately evokes associations with the most famous raft in art history, Gericault’s Raft of the Medusa – and inevitably with the theme of “salvation.” So how does this tie in with this exhibition, the first in which his abstract and his figurative works are shown side by side? Firstly, we need to understand the two poles between which Wilson’s work oscillates. On the one hand, there are the figurative, highly tangible compositions in which animals play a decisive role. They are metaphors of complex processes and moments – not in the animal kingdom, but in our highly technological human societies. The double monkey, for example, that we see in ReTro is the result of recent cloning experiments. The symbol in the background even refers to the corresponding laboratory. Wilson’s horses (State I and II) can also be read symbolically. They are versions of the famous painting Whistlejacket (1762) by Georges Stubbs, which is now one of the icons in the collection of the National Gallery in London. It shows […]\n\nuntil 30.08. | #4321ARTatBerlin | Luisa Catucci Gallery (Brunnenstraße) shows from 20. June 2024 the exhibition A PSALM FOR THE WILD BUILT by the artists Marion Mandeng, Barbara Boekelman, Eleonora Roaro , Cathy Jardon and Irina Gabiani. Taking its title from the eponymous book by Becky Chambers, this exhibition aspires to be a visual poem in reverence of the wild built. It stands as a declaration of love and solidarity from four wild built women artists, alongside the four wild built women running the Luisa Catucci Gallery, to their untamed peers—women, men and those in between, alike. The inner wildness is a profound, untamed force residing deep within many individuals. Embracing this inner wildness enables women to access their primal power, reconnect with their natural instincts, and navigate life’s complexities with a fierce, unyielding spirit. This wildness defies societal expectations and limitations; it may be contained or restrained temporarily, but it inevitably finds its path to eruption. It is a source of immense strength, resilience, and intuition, manifesting in expressions of profound creativity, fierce protection, and unwavering determination. This torrent of raw creativity places women artists at the forefront of the wild built, despite the historical and societal disadvantages that […]\n\nuntil 12.07. | #4320ARTatBerlin | OFFICE IMPART is currently showing the exhibition Magenta Elephants by the artist Damjanski. Nobody is Here aka Outis Arrives and Nemo Appears “Friends, Nobody is murdering me by craft. Force there is none.” Homer, The Odyssey, Book 9 Line 408 What if the cat isn’t both dead and alive as in Schrodinger’s box, but a taxidermied felis catus staring from a ceiling in a meme on your screen who has disappeared with not even a Cheshire smile remaining? Can you see it? The image? The image that is an idea, a phrase, a picture, and do any one of those images mean more, do more, show more than the other? Damjanski’s “Ceiling Cat” (2024) riffs on Eva and Franco Mattes’ “Ceiling Cat” (2016) responding to the internet meme, which was itself a 2006 photograph taken by nobody, not even anonymous, just no one yet known, or to be known, or willing to stand up for the peculiar photographic set-up captured in the first decade of this strange, nigh uncanny century.

June 2024 the exhibition KONTROLLE by the artist Moritz Stumm and Stefan Neuberger. What does the exploitation of animals by the police in order to wield their monopoly of violence at the beginning of the 21st century tell us about man’s claim to power over nature and the state over its citizens? What parallels can be drawn to human nature, our desires and instincts? The series KONTROLLE addresses the power structure between animals, state power and, implicitly, citizens – in the form of stylised images of training sessions of police service horses and dogs. The focus of the works is on the animals, which calmy, agressively and even at times playfully obey commands. The composition is reminiscent of the iconography of authority of equestrian statues and raises the question of the staging of state power in the present day. Vernissage: Friday, 14.

June 2024 the exhibition Sunless Circuit by the artist Su Yu Hsin. “Memory is not something we have, it is something that happens: a network of unintended connections. While remembering is a form of caring, storing is a way of safely forgetting. Our devices know us better than we know them. The algorithm is an oracle that tracks our secrets and predicts both questions and answers. The promises of technology are many. Among them, that all information will be always available. But the internet, like the past, is also made of broken links and errors. No cloud lasts forever, not even those born in a silicon valley. How many times have we felt the vertigo of the no longer accessible data? When machines fail, we stop taking them for granted. Glitches are part of their agency. When they work again, they regain their deceptive immateriality.” (excerpt of text by Sonia Fernández Pan) Vernissage: Friday, 14. June 2024, 6 – 9 pm Exhibition period: Friday, 14.

June 2024 the exhibition HOMESICK WANDERER by the artist Rosanna Burford. Homesick for a place that never was. In the exhibition Homesick Wanderer, Rosanna Burford’s art invites viewers to travel through invented landscapes of longing and memory. Informed by the gardens of her childhood in England, Burford’s work searches for a personal paradise. The garden – a place where organic landscape meets man-made structure is an archetypal space where humanity has sought paradise since our beginnings. Strange Beginnings, 80 x 80 cm, oil on canvas, 2023 Burford’s latest works evoke a homesickness for a place that never was. The past plays an important role in creating this place and is considered as an intertwined cultural heritage of family legacy, memories of travel, and mythological characters or spaces such as the hanging gardens of Babylon. These influences of the past merge with a strong desire for a new world. Reflecting on the current context of our relationship with nature, this new world is a place where nature acts as a refuge – a contemporary reflection on paradise as a walled garden – an ancient concept of home. Autumn in […]\n\nuntil 26.06. | #4317ARTatBerlin | Michaela Helfrich Galerie shows from 12 June 2024 the exhibition Changelings in Nighttown by the artist Noël O’Callaghan.

July 2024 an art presentation of 15 selected works from Thomas Hoepker’s oeuvre. With the death of Thomas Hoepker, the gallery has lost one of the most important German photographers in history, but above all Hoepker the man, whom it represented for more than 20 years and presented at exhibitions and art fairs. It comprises 15 selected works by the photographer. In addition to his portraits of boxing legend Muhammad Ali, photographs by Andy Warhol and works from Hoepker’s “Berlin Wall Children” series will also be on display. Thomas Hoepker (1936-2024) gained his first experience with the medium of photography at the age of 14. He received two Photokina awards during his studies and from 1959 worked regularly as an advertising photographer for magazines and book publications. He devoted himself to photojournalism and later also became interested in the moving image, shooting films and working as a cameraman. In 1974, he was the first accredited photographer to go to East Berlin for Stern magazine, where he worked temporarily as art director. In 1989, Thomas Hoepker became the first German photographer to become a full member of the Magnum Photos agency […]\n\nbis 31.08. | #4341ARTatBerlin | Galerie Z22 shows from 11th July 2024 the exhibition ARTISTIC STEPS by the artists Immanuel Rohringer and Frank Massholder. Galerie Z22 presents the exhibition “ARTISTIC STEPS” by Immanuel Rohringer and Frank Massholder. Frank Massholder and Immanuel Rohringer dedicate themselves to the accidental beauty of floors in large series that have been running for years and are still unfinished today. While the art photographer and gallery owner Massholder finds his motifs during visits to his artists’ studios, the visual artist Rohringer creates them in experimental and open processes. FRANK MASSHOLDER | LANDAUER #4 | 2023 | UV.DRUCK AUF ALUDIBOND BUTLERFINISH Massholder calls his discoveries “concrete coincidences” and has been consistently “collecting” such “deliberate photographs of accidentally created objects” for years. In his words, the floors of artists’ studios are “snapshots of an artist’s inner landscape over the course of time. They are a collection of movements, colours, splashes, pieces of inspiration from each individual work that unintentionally document the artist’s work as a whole.” IMMANUEL ROHRINGER | ARTISTIC STEPS | 1/30 | 2023 | MISCHTECHNIK AUF LEINWAND | 200 x 185 For him, such studio floors are “canvases that guide us through time and perhaps give […]\n\nuntil 24.08. | #4333ARTatBerlin | Galerie Thomas Schulte presents from 28th June 2024 the exhibition Behold the lowly Vessel by the artist Robert Mappelthorpe. Robert Mapplethorpe’s photographs of flowers are well known, and recognizable for their delicate yet erotic beauty. What is less discussed is the role of the specific set of objects often appearing within their carefully constructed compositions. Frequently drawn from the artist’s collection, the vases and bowls found in these still lifes reveal a deep appreciation for design – reflecting the confident eye and regard for classical form exemplified by his photographic work. It is the connection between the two, that forms the starting point of Behold the Lowly Vessel. Presented at Galerie Thomas Schulte, the exhibition takes a distinctive point of view, bringing thoughtful arrangements of Mapplethorpe’s photographs together with a private collection of vases inspired by them.
