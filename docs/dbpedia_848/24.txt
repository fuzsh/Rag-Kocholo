This is the former location of one of the largest synagogues in Berlin. In 1941, the Gestapo forced the Jewish community to convert this synagogue into a collection point for deportations. From here, more than 37,500 Jews living in Berlin were deported to the extermination camps listed on the memorial. These transports departed from the Grunewald and Putlitzstrasse train stations. The memorial on this spot tells the fate of 34 synagogues once located in Berlin. Each synagogue is represented by a metal plaque with facts about the building and seating capacity.

This is the former location of one of the largest synagogues in Berlin. In 1941, the Gestapo forced the Jewish community to convert this synagogue into a collection point for deportations. From here, more than 37,500 Jews living in Berlin were deported to the extermination camps listed on the memorial. These transports departed from the Grunewald and Putlitzstrasse train stations.

An additional 14,797 Jews were deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp from a second collection point located on Grosse Hamburg Street at the former Jewish home for the elderly. This group departed from the Anhalter train station in 117 separate transports between June 6, 1942 and March 27, 1945.

During the pogrom of November 9, 1938 (often referred to as "Kristallnacht"), Jewish places of worship in Berlin were damaged, burned, or destroyed. Because these synagogues were the symbols of a rich Jewish cultural history during the Prussian era, they were the foremost targets of Nazi-sponsored terror.

In addition to the public synagogues listed here, Berlin was home to 80 private prayer halls that were part of Jewish social organizations. These were also targets of the November ninth pogrom. Jewish places of worship surviving the pogrom were soon closed, sold, or confiscated by the Nazi regime.
