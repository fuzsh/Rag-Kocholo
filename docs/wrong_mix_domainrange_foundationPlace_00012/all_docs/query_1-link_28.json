This shows that effective code reviews are not just about finding bugs; they are crucial for maintaining high-quality software that drives business success.\n\nSo, how can you transform your code review process into an engine for development efficiency and quality?\n\nThis article will explore how to transform your code review process. You will discover tips for creating a collaborative review culture, thoroughness, and continuous improvement of your process for more tremendous success.\n\nSetting the Stage for Success: Defining Clear Objectives for Code Reviews♦Creator: bsd studio | Credit: Getty Images\n\nReviews can become unfocused without clear objectives and fail to address the code’s critical aspects. So, you should clearly outline your goals for each code review to ensure the process is efficient and focused.\n\nHere’s how you can effectively define and communicate clear objectives for your code reviews:\n\nKey Areas of Focus:\n\nFunctionality: Ensure the code works as intended and meets the specified requirements.\n\nMaintainability: Check if the code is easy to understand, well-organized, and can be easily modified in the future.\n\nPerformance: Ensure the code is optimized for performance.\n\nSecurity: Identify potential security vulnerabilities.\n\nWhy Clear Objectives Matter\n\nClear objectives are important because they make the review process smoother and also achieve the following:\n\nFocused Evaluation: Clear objectives provide a framework for what needs to be reviewed. This focus ensures that the reviewers concentrate on critical aspects of the code, such as functionality, performance, security, readability, and maintainability, rather than getting distracted by less relevant details.\n\nConsistency and Standardization: When objectives are clearly set, all reviewers have a common understanding of what is expected. This helps maintain a standard quality across the codebase, as all code is evaluated against the same or one criteria.\n\nEfficient Use of Time: Reviewers can efficiently allocate their time and resources. They can prioritize their efforts on areas that matter, reducing the time spent on irrelevant or less critical issues. This leads to quicker turnaround times for code reviews.\n\nReduced Technical Debt: Reviewers can identify and address potential pitfalls that could lead to future problems, ensuring the code remains clean and manageable over time.\n\nEstablish Coding Standards♦Creator Credit: Academy to Innovate HK\n\nMaintaining a consistent codebase is crucial for efficient code reviews and reducing the likelihood of errors. A consistent codebase ensures that all team members follow the same patterns, conventions, and practices, making the code easier to understand, review, and maintain. Here is why consistency matters:\n\nWhy Consistency Matters\n\nImproved Readability: Consistent coding styles help make code easier to read and understand. This means team members can quickly grasp what the code does without needing to figure out unfamiliar formats, which improves collaboration and makes troubleshooting more efficient.\n\nEasier Maintenance: When everyone uses the same methods and rules, maintaining the code becomes easier. Developers can quickly locate specific code and make changes faster, saving time searching through the codebase.\n\nReduced Errors: Consistency reduces the chances of making mistakes. This is because when everyone follows the same rules, it helps prevent errors like typos, problems with how the code works, and unintentional bugs, which makes software development more dependable.\n\nEfficient Onboarding: When the code is consistent, new team members can learn faster. The clear standards give them a structured way to understand how the code functions, which helps them join the team more quickly.\n\nAchieving Consistency: Key Strategies\n\nChoose a well-defined style guide that suits your programming language and project needs. Examples include the Google JavaScript Style Guide, the Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide, and the PEP 8 for Python.\n\nMake sure that the style guide is accessible to all team members. Incorporate it into your project documentation and onboarding materials.\n\nUse static code analysis tools such Pylint (for Python), SonarQube that support multiple languages and analyze code quality and security vulnerabilities. You can explore more tools here.\n\nIntegrate these tools into your development workflow through pre-commit hooks or continuous integration (CI) pipelines.\n\nCrafting Effective Reviews\n\nEffective code reviews are important for making sure software is high-quality and reliable. Here are some principles you can follow to make your code as effective as possible:\n\nLimit Review Size: Break down large chunks of code into smaller parts. This helps reviewers focus better, give detailed feedback faster, and catch important issues early.\n\nPrioritize Critical Sections: Start by reviewing the most important parts of the code first. Focus on functions and areas that have a big impact on how well the software works.\n\nActionable Feedback: Don’t just point out problems; provide suggestions for improvement or alternative approaches.be a superhero teammate!\n\nPositive Review Culture: Maintain a respectful and constructive tone. Focus on improving the code, not criticizing the developer. Encourage teamwork and sharing ideas to create better software together.\n\nBuilding a Collaborative Team\n\nTo achieve success in software development, fostering a collaborative team environment is essential. It helps everyone understand the goals and solve problems effectively. It promotes shared understanding and effective problem-solving. Here are strategies to improve teamwork and make your code better:\n\nReview Checklists: Create a checklist to guide reviewers and ensure consistent coverage of critical areas, saving time and frustration down the line.\n\nBalance Speed and Thoroughness: Strive for efficient reviews while maintaining code quality.\n\nEncourage Pair Programming: Pair programming sessions can help identify issues early on and improve code quality.\n\nContinuous Improvement: Regularly evaluate your code review process and iterate based on team feedback.\n\nLearn from the wisdom of others: Every programmer has their own unique way of coding. Code reviews allow you to see how others approach problems, giving you new ideas and techniques.\n\nConclusion\n\nEffective code reviews are important for successful software development. Setting clear goals, maintaining coding standards, and fostering teamwork makes it easier for teams to catch bugs early and improve code quality.\n\nFollowing these practices helps development teams write better code faster and more confidently. Remember, code reviews are not just about fixing mistakes but more about ongoing improvement and teamwork. By using feedback to refine development processes, you can deliver software that effectively meets user needs and business goals.\n\nReferences:\n\nThe Importance of Code Reviews — Code Institute Global. codeinstitute.net/global/blog/the-importance-of-code-reviews/\n\nInfosys.

All lying is on the table when Woolwich are covering up their embarrassing behaviour. Yesterday I listed several recent examples (last few months) in which they have either flat out refused to acknowledge my e-mail communications to all councillors or they have refused to respond in writing. An other option is their long held tactic of deflection. ...Oh Mr. Marshall in line 7 of the second paragraph you used a harsh word namely \"shi*#ead\" and our highly trained and ultra sensitive staff have never in their lives been subjected to such extreme verbal violence and potentially mentally damaging language hence we can not possibly comment to you as to why the sub-surface DNAPLS in RPW-6, nine feet below ground surface, have never been removed. Please try again say in about a decade and if we have recovered we will certainly respond....\n\nYes those two previous sentences are a tiny exaggeration but you get the point. They, the Township have been pulling this sh*# for decades and while they think it's perfectly O.K. to lie like dogs (i.e. full denial) or simple refusal to answer or deflection, it is not. We pay those a#@holes to respond to us and after three decades plus of their lying and bull*hit I'm bluntly, as I see fit, calling them out.\n\nOne recent non-response I got from a Township staff person and failed to include in yesterday's post was a very simple and straight forward question asking about Township policies in issuing building permits within certain distances from former landfills. I've asked (in writing- e-mail) twice now and still nothing. Not even a confirmation that they've received it and are looking at it.\n\nI challenge anybody to put up with this bull%$it for 35 years and keep on fighting with clean hands. Woolwich Township are YELLOW, GUTLESS WONDERS who are even too chicken to face me in a public debate.\n\n14:02 • 6 hours ago\n\nHouse of Friendship\n\nMusic Lets ShelterCare Participants Shine\n\n♦\n\nSkylar, a master’s student in music therapy at Wilfrid Laurier University, is interning at ShelterCare this summer as part of their certification.\n\n“Music is a universal experience.

The focus was on understanding how tracers or contaminants move quickly through fractures to wells, which is crucial for assessing water quality and contamination risks.\n\nThe field and numerical experiment involved introducing a tracer at the surface and tracking the progress as it moved through the fracture network to the wells. The research demonstrates how quickly solutes can move from the surface to wells in fractured bedrock, particularly in settings with thin overburden. Central to the study is the use of HydroGeoSphere (HGS), Aquanty’s powerful modelling platform that simulates the interactions between surface water and groundwater. Using HGS, researchers tracked the movement of a fluorescent dye applied to the land surface in an agricultural field near Perth, Ontario, Canada. This approach revealed that rapid transport through fractures can significantly influence groundwater quality, highlighting the importance of understanding fracture networks to predict contamination risks.\n\n♦\n\nFig. 4. HydroGeoSphere domain (not to scale).\n\nHGS was employed to enhance the understanding of tracer transport dynamics, and model the discrete-fracture capability, showing how contaminants navigate through thin soil layers and fractured bedrock. The model illustrated how fractures control the speed and direction of tracer transport and helped assess how different fracture configurations and hydraulic properties influence this process. This model allowed researchers to compare the transport dynamics and maximum contaminant concentrations at different aquifer depths.\n\nA key feature of HGS is its ability to simulate the complex pathways and rapid transport of contaminants in fractured rock environments by pairing porous media flow and transport with discrete fracture networks. The model's ability to integrate these factors provided a comprehensive understanding of how quickly and extensively contaminants can spread in such settings.\n\nAbstract:\n\nA unique infiltration tracer experiment was performed whereby a fluorescent dye was applied to the land surface in an agricultural field, near Perth, Ontario, Canada, to simulate the transport of solutes to two pumped monitoring wells drilled into the granitic gneiss aquifer. This experiment, interpreted using the discrete-fracture capability of the numerical model HydroGeoSphere, showed that solute transport from the surface through thin soil (less than 2 m) to wells in fractured bedrock can be extremely rapid (on the order of hours). Also, it was demonstrated that maximum concentrations of contaminants originating from the ground surface will not necessarily be the highest in the shallow aquifer horizon. These are important considerations for both private and government-owned drinking water systems that draw water from shallow fractured bedrock aquifers. This research illustrates the extreme importance of protecting drinking water at the source.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE ARTICLE.\n\nThe breakthrough curves generated in HydroGeoSphere were corrected for mixing in the borehole by using a simple analytical solution\n\n— Levison, J.

Thomas moved to Waterloo as a student attending the University of Waterloo and has been a proud community member ever since. When he’s not working as an accountant for a local non-profit, Thomas can be found spending quality time with his two children, indulging in his passions as a “dance dad,” cheering on his favorite baseball teams, or grilling up a storm in his backyard.\n\nThomas’s connection to Big Brothers Big Sisters of Waterloo Region (BBBSWR) dates back to his childhood, where he witnessed a friend benefit from having a Big Brother. Inspired by this, he began his own journey with us in early 2019, starting with the Game On program. Although the shift to online formats during the pandemic brought its own set of challenges, Thomas adapted and has since been actively involved with the Big Bunch program.\n\nHis motivation to volunteer stemmed from a desire to get more physically active and explore new experiences while giving back to the community. For Thomas, mentoring is about being a positive role model—engaging with mentees, listening, encouraging, and providing a safe space where they can truly be themselves.\n\nThomas’s extensive volunteering history includes assisting at the hospital in high school, working at a local historical site, participating in an adult reading program, and contributing to Block Parents. His current involvement with BBBSWR continues this tradition of service, reflecting his belief that volunteering helps broaden one’s perspective and connect with the community on a deeper level.\n\nAn average day with his mentees is anything but predictable. Whether it’s a lively dodgeball game, building a Lego robot, or a fun round of charades, Thomas embraces the spontaneity and joy that each session brings. His favorite aspect of volunteering is the opportunity to engage with kids at their level, enjoy fun activities together, and experience those small but significant moments of connection and growth.\n\nOne of Thomas’s cherished memories is from his early days with the Game On program. Despite the initial challenges of working with a group of energetic fifth graders, the heartfelt reactions and gratitude from the children on the final day underscored the positive impact of his efforts.\n\nThomas acknowledges that the influence of a mentor might not always be immediately visible, but he believes that simply being present, offering encouragement, and providing new perspectives can make a meaningful difference. He’s also found that volunteering has honed his ability to command attention with his “Dad voice,” a skill that proves invaluable when managing a group of excited kids.\n\nFor those contemplating volunteering, Thomas advises embracing the chaos and unpredictability that often comes with the role. Get actively involved, even if it’s outside your comfort zone, and be open to the unexpected moments that can turn into powerful experiences. The rewards, though sometimes subtle, are well worth the effort.\n\nThank you, Thomas, for your incredible dedication and for making a significant impact in the lives of our youth. Your commitment to mentorship is truly inspiring, and we are grateful to have you as part of the BBBSWR family\n\nThe post July Mentor of the Month appeared first on Big Brothers Big Sisters of Waterloo Region.\n\n10:29 • 10 hours ago\n\nJames Davis Nicoll\n\nSic Transit Gloria Mundi / Farnham’s Freehold By Robert A.

Back then, I dealt with countless blue screens and crashes, so I have a good sense of what might have gone wrong.\n\nThe issue from last Friday is intricate and might need to be clarified, even for those well-versed in software development but unfamiliar with Windows drivers or Kernel space.\n\nThis article aims to simplify the situation, breaking it down in an accessible way even to those without a technical background — or even your grandparents.\n\nAssume a Windows Machine is Your HouseUser Space\n\nTo understand better, let’s assume a Windows computer is your house. Imagine the rooms in your home—your kitchen, living room, and bedroom. These are where you do everyday activities, cook meals, watch TV, and relax. These are the visible, accessible areas where you directly interact with your home’s features.\n\nWe will call this part of your home User Space. This is also the space in your computer that you see and interact with. There is what you see on the screen and point at with your mouse. This is called User Space in Windows as well.\n\nKernel Space\n\nThere is also a hidden world in your house. The behind-the-walls system includes the foundation, plumbing, electrical, and heating. You don’t see these systems while going about your daily activities, but they are essential for ensuring everything works properly. They handle crucial functions like delivering water and electricity and maintaining home operations.\n\nThis is the internal infrastructure of your house. In a computer, this area is called the Kernel Space.\n\n♦This left half shows the user-accessible space in your house—what you see and use. The right side shows the internal infrastructure of the house, including the heating and cooling ducts.CrowdStrike is Your New Smart Thermostat\n\nConsider adding a new feature to your house, like installing a smart thermostat. This latest addition wasn’t part of the original house, but it needs to connect to and work with the existing heating and cooling systems (Internal Infrastructure) to function correctly.\n\nIt monitors the temperature in your house and works with the existing infrastructure to operate effectively. Since you, the user, or the home’s original builder do not build this component (thermostat), it is called a Third-Party Application.\n\nSimilarly, Crowdstrike has built an application called Falcon to run on your Windows machine and monitor its security. To do that properly, it must connect to your computer's Kernel Space/Internal Infrastructure.\n\nSince Falcon was not created by Microsoft or the user, it is called a Third-Party Application.\n\nThe Certification Process\n\nWhen a company such as Google builds a home thermostat (Nest), it must certify that its product will work with your customer’s heating and cooling system before selling it.\n\nSo, let’s assume you buy a Nest thermostat, bring it home, and attach it to your heating and cooling system. The Nest has now started monitoring your house's temperature and telling the heating and cooling system when to change it.\n\nSimilarly, you can buy Falcon by Crowdstrike and install it on your computer. This will allow it to monitor your computer's security and tell your computer's internal infrastructure, which lives in kernel space, to do things to protect your computer.\n\nAny application on a Windows machine that accesses the kernel space must be certified by Windows before it can run on the machine. If it doesn’t get certified, it can’t run. But sometimes, huge security risks are discovered quickly, and an update to Falcon is needed.\n\nSometimes, companies split their applications into two parts: one that works in Kernel space and one that works in user space only. The part in kernel space needs the certification, while the part in user space does not.\n\nSo if there is a new attack, they can send information quickly to user space and tell the kernel space part of the application to look there. It can then use that information in kernel space to protect against attacks. And because they didn’t have to update the kernel space, they didn’t need to certify it.\n\nBUT, and there is a huge BUT here. They have to do that carefully. It is possible to update the information in user space so that it will accidentally confuse the application in kernel space, and things can go sideways. So, if you are doing this, it must be adequately tested.\n\nDo you see where we might be going? …..\n\nHow Did It All Go Wrong?\n\nYour new Nest Smart thermostat allows you to set the temperature from your phone and directly controls your home’s heating and cooling systems from the panel on the wall and your smartphone.\n\nNow, suppose Google releases a software update for the Nest. This update improves the mobile app that you use to set the temperature but doesn’t include changes to the part of the thermostat that directly controls your heating and cooling systems. Remember, the infrastructure side needs to be certified, so they wouldn’t want to change that often and to get updates out faster, they might build in a way that only the mobile app needs changes, but it should still work with the infrastructure side.\n\nHere’s where things go wrong: The updated app introduces new features or settings that are supposed to work with the thermostat. However, the thermostat’s core control system, which manages the heating and cooling, didn’t handle the changes as expected. The software developers forgot to test this change with the existing infrastructure and failed to realize that it would also need changes to work correctly.\n\nSo, when you use the new app to set a temperature, the updated data is passed to the thermostat’s control system. However, because the core system wasn’t updated, it couldn’t interpret or handle this new data correctly. This mismatch causes the thermostat to send incorrect signals to your heating and cooling systems. As a result, your heating might turn on when it’s already warm, or the cooling system might fail to turn on when it’s hot, causing your home to become uncomfortable.\n\nLet’s say that in this case, the only way to fix the system is to disconnect it from the wall, connect the display to your computer, update the software, and then reconnect it to the wall.\n\nFalcon is like a smart thermostat in the context of a Windows machine. It has a component or “Driver” that operates in Kernel Space (like the thermostat’s core control system) and another in User Space (like the mobile app you use). If CrowdStrike updates only the User Space component without updating the Kernel Space Driver, the system can experience problems.\n\nWhen Falcon’s Kernel Space driver pulls data from the updated User Space component, the incompatibility can cause a critical failure, resulting in a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Fixing this involves manually rebooting the computer into Safe Mode (like manually fixing the thermostat), removing the problematic driver, and rebooting the computer normally.\n\nThis is precisely what happened on Friday, July 19th. An update to the CrowdStrikes Falcon application caused a critical failure in Kernel Space, resulting in a Blue Screen of Death on EVERY Windows machine it was installed on!\n\nImagine breaking the temperature controls on EVERY house that used a Nest!! Like Nest, Falcon didn’t break the temperature in all houses. Falcon only broke the Windows computers it was running on, which is why it wasn’t a Windows outage but a CrowdStrike Outage. Falcon was also running on Mac and Linux machines, but this part of the code worked differently and was unaffected.\n\nIn summary, just as an update to a smart thermostat’s app without updating its core control system can lead to issues with your home’s temperature control, an incomplete update to a driver in Kernel Space can cause severe problems on a Windows machine.\n\nThis example shows why it’s essential to keep all parts of a system, whether a thermostat or a computer, in sync to ensure smooth operation.\n\nWant More Details?\n\nI highly recommend this video if you want a deeper look at the issue.\n\nmedium.com/media/34a412e9f6b4adbd74a61f5d310180a9/href\n\nI wish all the best to the IT teams working on resolving this issue, as well as to the developer who made a mistake at Crowdstrike. We're all human and we all make mistakes. Hopefully, not only Crowdstrike, but many others will learn some valuable lessons from this unfortunate event.\n\n♦\n\nThe July 19th CrowdStrike Windows Glitch Explained was originally published in Code Like A Girl on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\n\n18:54 • a day ago\n\nCode Like a Girl\n\nCrowdStrike Outage: If only Technology could have stayed within limits!\n\nBlue screen of death!♦Wikipedia Image\n\nMy husband, who was supposed to take off from Bangalore, India, airport at 6 PM, took off at 10 PM. The Microsoft Global Outage was the most talked-about episode on July 20th, 2024, and history was made.\n\nYesterday, millions of Windows computers encountered ‘The Blue Screen of Death’ (BSOD), a critical error screen displayed by Microsoft Windows and ReactOS operating systems. It appears when the system faces a severe issue that prevents it from operating safely.\n\nA flawed update from CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, caused a crash in Microsoft’s operating system, leading to widespread disruption across multiple industries and platforms due to the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).\n\nIt caused stress and frustration worldwide as millions sat stranded in airports, failed to pay bills online, or even called 911.\n\nAccording to a Forbes article this is a global issue with widespread impact.\n\n“Planes have been grounded in the U.S., trains in the U.K. are impacted, as well as boarding scanners at Edinburgh airport in Scotland.”\n\nAnother article on WIRED states\n\n“Banks, airports, TV stations, hotels, and countless other businesses are all facing widespread IT outages, leaving flights grounded and causing widespread disruption, after Windows machines have displayed errors worldwide.”\n\nThe impact extended beyond computers to servers and various other systems. An influx of requests from users, devices, services, and businesses triggered failures across Microsoft products, specifically Azure Cloud and Microsoft 365. The issues with Azure precipitated further distinct disruptions in 365 services.\n\nThe cascading effects highlight the world’s reliance on Microsoft and a few cyber security firms like CrowdStrike.\n\nWas it an intentional act to sabotage the reputation or an error in quality control?\n\nAs of now, it appears to be a lapse from CrowStrike’s quality control. But how and why did it end up so far? It is strange to believe when technologies have evolved where we have better ways of rolling out changes. Or has the ecosystem become too complex to foresee this outage? Or were they simply complacent?\n\nWhy was only Microsoft impacted and not Mac or Linux?\n\nThe CrowdStrike driver for Windows posed a problem even without an update. While Microsoft exercises governance over kernel-mode drivers, the issue in this case was not the driver itself but the configuration responsible for initiating the CrowdStrike driver. The configuration provided to the driver from outside kernel mode was flawed. Since Mac and Linux operate differently, this issue did not affect them.\n\nEven though it wasn’t Microsoft who did not introduce the issue, this situation has undoubtedly brought to light numerous disconcerting inquiries regarding Microsoft’s substantial monopolization of the technology sector.\n\nWhy was the update rolled out all at once?\n\nThe tech community often espouses the wisdom of ‘rolling out in phases, one region at a time.’ Despite this well-known methodology, global outages still happen. Where was the lapse in the process, and why?\n\nThe statement underscores the uneasy truth that software companies encounter limited litigation for significant disruptions and cybersecurity incidents. With minimal penalties, it asks whether there is sufficient motivation to implement more substantial changes.\n\nHowever, I ask\n\nWhat repercussions should software firms face when flaws in their code cause major disruptions?\n\nWhen a car manufacturer incurs severe penalties for defective brakes, a software provider can typically release an update and move on!\n\nIronic.\n\nIt isn't Microsoft’s fault, as it was CrowdStrike’s update! It was a hidden threat that Microsoft wasn't aware of. Microsoft just can’t run away blaming CrowdStrike!\n\n“Their IT stack may include just a single provider for the operating system, cloud, productivity, email, chat, collaboration, video conferencing, browser, identity, generative AI and increasingly security as well,” a CrowdStrike vice-president, Drew Bagley, said. “This means that the building materials, the supply chain, and even the building inspector are all the same.”\n\nWhat about the external damage?\n\nThe software firms might have paid some heavy price for the outage and the reputational damage.\n\nWhat about the external, indirect damage caused by the hospital’s failure to take up emergency cases? Airlines are creating loads of work, flight cancellations, delays, payments, etc. that will take months to balance out. This is a huge damage that has gone in.\n\nThose who needed unavailable emergency services, hospitals, airports or government agencies were at a loss. The rest of society has not only grown dependent on digital mediation and computation without much input because these processes are driven by absolutist economic firms, not democratic political actors.\n\nWill this outage shift the monopolization dynamics?\n\nThis outage will transform the utilization and reliance on one technology giant. It will challenge the dependence on a single tech behemoth, undermining their efforts to dominate the entire ecosystem, including operating systems, cloud services, email, MS Teams, collaboration tools, video conferencing, browsers, identity management, generative AI, reporting, and even security.\n\nThis sparks a debate on centralization versus decentralization.\n\nI leave here with an open question.\n\nWhere is the right balance between what needs to be centralized and what does not?

Sandy appoints a councillor to be both the Chair of TRAC as well as their spokesperson who has zero experience. Granted not zero experience in life, in politics, in twisting the English language but in regards to his portfolio i.e. the remediation of the Elmira Aquifers and of the downstream Canagagigue Creek. Poor, old Nathan Cadeau has been doing his best to \"fake it till you make it\" likely for close to a year now and as long as he is speaking to people of equal lack of knowledge he can fake it really well. He definitely has talent in that department.\n\nI have of late been poking the bear. Nothing else has worked to date. They've always hidden behind the Min. of Environment (MECP) as well as their \"citizen\" committees such that they can support the status quo (i.e. what the polluter Lanxess wants) while at the same time talk big about citizen involvement and alleged longterm cleanup goals. While the long term is here and 1) the Elmira Aquifers are not drinkable (i.e. potable) and 2) the downstream Creek is a mess of DDT, dioxins, PAHs, lindane, mercury, PCBs and more.\n\nFirstly I asked for formal responses to my concerns about the failure to pump the off-site wells to their TARGET pumping rates as set by Lanxess's consultants. Nothing!\n\nThen I asked for a response to me concerns about the failure to pump the on-site Upper Aquifer (UA) wells to the historic values they've been pumped at since 1997-98. More Nothing!\n\nThen I commented on the first TRAC meeting in which Joe Ricker advised that neither NDMA nor chlorobenzene in Elmira could ever achieve drinking water standards due to some mystery/magic known as \"asymptotic behaviour\". I flatly stated that Joe was mistaken and then proved it and asked for a formal response Nada!\n\nThe next TRAC meeting was June 13/24. Here I hoped that TRAC/Woolwich might feel that a response to my formal comments mentioned in the previous paragraph would be appropriate. Who was I kidding? TAG/TRAC have not responded to any written Delegations from myself since their first meeting in September 2015. So yet again a big fat NYET!\n\nThroughout all this Nathan and other fellow travellors and guilty parties have been blathering about collaboration, respect and constructive dialogue. They also claim that this latest attempt at public consultation (TRAC) is the real deal. Which it is for Elmira at least (Totally Rotten & Corrupt).\n\nOn Saturday, July 13, 2024 I both posted here and sent a copy to Woolwich Township. The title was \"The Dirty, Lying Twits\". It was a fairly detailed history of the DNAPL coverup here in Elmira by Uniroyal Chemical and successors. At the end of it I made a serious suggestion that Council have an independent hydrogeologist interview me for several hours to find out where all the hydrogeologic skeletons are in Elmira. So far to date zero response to either my detailed DNAPL info presented nor to my serious suggestion that a truly independent hydrogeologist with no ties to Lanxess/MECP (financial or other) interview me. Same result as always -whining about tone and lack of respect- But continued Refusal to acknowledge concerns, offer ideas, solutions, dialogue on the problem i.e. Head In The Sand, Ostrich Like Behaviour .\n\nMy comments of Saturday, July 20, 2024. further explained the extent of the corruption required to hide a problem as serious as DNAPLS thoughout Elmira, both on and off site. I also included the unfortunate reversal by APTE leaders on this DNAPL matter. Was the private deal they were offered either the facade of a permanent seat at the table or did it include promises of Creek cleanup decades down the line? I also gave Woolwich their second challenge namely to debate me publicly regarding both the Aquifers cleanup and the remediation of the downstream Canagagigue Creek. Apparently Woolwich don't want to talk about it. Their specialty is private, closed door sessions with dirty polluters and their regulators all the while refusing to discuss any of these matters with citizens who aren't their lapdogs. In other words informed citizens with both backbones and only the public interest in mind need not attend.\n\nWoolwich Township you are CHICKEN through and through.\n\n13:44 • a day ago\n\nChildren and Youth Planning Table of Waterloo Region\n\nCYPT & SWRIL award youth $70,000 to address local challenges\n\nFrom an inclusive book club to a basketball court, 12 youth projects are building the Waterloo Region of the future.\n\nWATERLOO REGION – Twelve projects by Waterloo Region youth receive $70,000 in funding as part of the Youth Impact Project (YIP) by Children and Youth Planning Table of Waterloo Region (CYPT) and Smart Waterloo Region (SWRIL).\n\nOn June 8, over 100 youth from 15 local organisations pitched their ideas to a panel of nine youth. The Youth Decision-Making Panel (“The Dragons”) decided which projects would receive funding to make their idea a reality. The Youth Impact Project looks to fund youth who are addressing local challenges which are identified through the 2023 Youth Impact Survey results. The funded projects include a focus on supporting youth mental and physical health, increasing feelings of belonging, and responding to climate change and food insecurity.\n\n“Young people are not only the leaders of tomorrow — they are the experts of today on the challenges that impact them,” said Karen Redman, Chair of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo. “There is no one better than our youngest residents to champion innovative solutions and build the resilient, vibrant Waterloo Region of the future.”\n\n“It has been exhilarating to be part of the behind-the-scenes outreach, training, and engagement of the Youth Impact Project collaboration! By “training the trainers”, including United Way staff, we are accessing innovative and compassionate ways to engage the youth of our community. Investing in the ideas of youth, to solve community challenges creates new avenues of inclusion and pathways of critical thinking. We can’t wait to see how small grants will turn so many of these pitches into reality,” said Joan Fisk, Chief Executive Officer of United Way Waterloo Region Communities.\n\nSWRIL and CYPT announced the Youth Impact Project in March. With funding from the Region of Waterloo and United Way Waterloo Region Communities, SWRIL and CYPT established a $70,000 fund to put directly towards youth ideas.\n\nAfter two weeks of deliberation, the Youth Decision-Making Panel awarded funding to 12 projects. The projects that received funding are:\n\n“Kairos” pitched by Mihret, Semere, Delina, Ekram, Hanan, Brian, Abdullah, and Abdiasis from Camino Health and Well-being. A six-week summer program for newcomers ages 14-18. The program will have trades and employment workshops, like working in a manufacturing class and creating resumes, so that newcomer youth and their families don’t view university as their only option.\n\n“Book-a-pedia” pitched by Tanitoluwa, Jason, Oke, Zino, and Phoebe from Nigerians in the Region of Waterloo. A book club designed to build a more inclusive community. This is a club where the stories bridge understanding and connection by focusing on books by racialized and Indigenous authors, they highlight diverse experiences and perspectives. Regular sessions will be held where youth can discuss themes such as identity, confidence, and resilience.\n\n“YTCYC” pitched by the Youth Council from Langs. Soccer, snacks and shirts will be a free event for grades 1-5 in Cambridge at the Langs Gym. The event will include a free soccer tournament that will include 20 kids. The group would like to provide the kids with a free lunch, fruit smoothies and a free shirt.\n\n“Dream Builders,” pitched by youth from the Somali Canadian Association of Waterloo Region. A summer program for youth aged 12-17 to address food insecurity and climate change through interactive cooking and gardening workshops. In this six-week program, they plan to implement hands-on learning workshops with two groups of youth. The group will also employ local post-secondary students with culinary and agricultural backgrounds.\n\n“Churchill Basketball” pitched by Natu, Jasmin, Salar, Landon, Saif, Rabia, Teena, Abdullah, and Gurleen from Kinbridge Community Association. The group wants to renovate their outdoor basketball court, which is used by many schools and community members. The group has a plan mapped out that includes making connections in the community, engaging with contractors, assessing and planning, and holding fundraisers.\n\n“Team Belonging” pitched by Niya and Hanan from Volunteer Waterloo Region. The welcoming table wants to encourage newcomers to their school group where they can combat hunger and discrimination to create a more welcoming environment. Many students go to school hungry and experience bullying. This program provides students with a safe space to work and gain volunteer hours during lunch on Mondays.\n\n“Project Astraeus” pitched by Aabjosh, Josh, Abbas, Hamza, and Marcus from GreenHouse. This group wants to build a network to empower connections and foster solutions to real-world problems. There will be chapters of community or school members who will create a solution to a real-world issue while fostering hands-on learning in STEM. They will provide a complementary launch kit tailored to the chapter’s unique solution. At the end of each fiscal period, an annual conference will be held where chapters will showcase their project, prizes will be given out, and they will be able to connect with innovators in the industry.\n\n“Summer Youth Market” pitched by Chloe, Dichhen, Emraan, Natalie, Hillary, Sri, and Miqdad from Kitchener Youth Action Council. A market where youth can sell their goods and services to the community. This group will be fundraising for a local organization called OneRoof, a local, non-profit organization that supports youth who experience homelessness. The group has already connected with the City of Kitchener to see who can run the market at Victoria Park.\n\n“Empowering Newcomers” pitched by Leen and Victoria from Kinbridge Community Association. A beauty program that teaches young women about hairstyling and aesthetic techniques while also sharing insights into topics that are important for young newcomer women, like self-care and confidence. The program encourages a sense of belonging and empowerment while also building community.\n\n“Voices4Youth” pitched by Ali, Ali, Ekrema, Wal, Omar, and Harith from Adventure4Change. A drop box in the community to collect anonymous ideas from people who have ideas about what should be done to help the community. The group also wants to have a media platform where they can interview key members of the community to see what the community needs most to determine how they can help be part of the solution.\n\n“Youth-Led Circles: We Are the Future” pitched by Bill, Billy, Sri Vatsa, Xavier, Ana, Angela, Arsema, Marmawit, and Mhret from Kitchener-Waterloo Multicultural Centre. This group’s goal is to provide safe spaces for newcomer youth who may experience discrimination in the community and provide them with a space they can feel comfortable in. Sessions will include mental health sessions, environmental sessions, and cultural diversity so youth can learn about the other cultures in the region.\n\n“Youth Fun Fest” pitched by Anna, Harsimar, Peace, Tijesuni, and Aisha from Social Venture Partners Teens. A youth fun fair for all KW youth that will include carnival games and more. It will take place outdoors in a local park in early September near the beginning of school as a warm welcome. They are planning on having local performers, booths for youth led vendors and food trucks to bridge the gap between the community and youth.\n\nSWRIL and CYPT will showcase each of these youth groups and their projects on social media in the coming weeks. Follow them on Instagram and Twitter at @smartwatregion and @cyptwr to see how the projects come to life. You can also learn more about the projects at swril.ca/yip.\n\n♦\n\nThe post CYPT & SWRIL award youth $70,000 to address local challenges appeared first on Children and Youth Planning Table.\n\n13:20 • a day ago\n\nCode Like a Girl\n\nCasting C# Spells: Inheritance and RPG Fun\n\n♦\n\nyou’re a wizard harry\n\nContinue reading on Code Like A Girl »\n\n12:16 • a day ago\n\nCode Like a Girl\n\nGitLab Productivity Hacks: Metrics that Matter\n\n♦\n\n“Measuring developer productivity isn’t just about tracking output; it’s about understanding the journey from idea to implementation…\n\nContinue reading on Code Like A Girl »\n\n12:16 • a day ago\n\nElmira Advocate\n\nMY LATEST ASSAULT UPON FORTRESS WOOLWICH REGARDING THE ELMIRA CLEANUP\n\nJuly 20, 2024\n\nZero Formal Responses To Citizens Reports, Critiques and Concerns\n\nIn a democracy politicians are not permitted to simply have to listen to their fellow parlimentarians, legislators or party caucus. Good gosh they aren't elected by those eminent shawinigans but by their constituents living in their ridings. You would think municipal politicians would be even more aware of that. Not here in Woolwich Township. Also you might think that municipal politicians might respond even more regularly and cogently with citizens who have separated themselves from the pack by not being toadies, co-optees or deferential to persons espousing the status quo.\n\nAfter 35 years it is impossible to believe that Woolwich Township are simply mistaken. Nobody can remain blind, deaf and stupid for that long unintentionally. Once again quoting Saul Bellow “A great deal of intelligence can be invested in ignorance when the need for illusion is deep.” DNAPLS were the first exposure of corruption and following coverup back in the very early 90s. Out of context quotes allegedly from Stan Feenstra (hydrogeologist) made by Brian Beatty (Morrison-Beatty) were exposed resulting in the “consolidation” of Brian Beatty according to Dr. David Ash . At a later point Brian Beatty threatened legal action versus The Woolwich Observer for their truthful and accurate reporting. Those actions may have soured relations between myself and the Observer for decades.\n\nThen came APT Environment's major rollover whereby Sylvia Berg convinced APT members that there was no reason to get upset over the Ministry of Environments' December 10, 1993 acceptance that no more than a token removal of free phase DNAPL from RPW-5 and a touch from TPW-2 was acceptable. This was after Susan was in India, Sylvia , Glenys McMullen and I hammered out a three or four page document clearly showing where both residual and free phase DNAPL were on site and readily accessible for removal. That document was dated I believe in September 1993 and yet two months later without a whisper to me Sylvia reversed herself. More than strange.\n\nInterestingly several months after Susan came back from India in 1994 APTE quit UPAC over their acceptance of Uniroyal's proposed Upper Aquifer Containment & Treatment System (UACTS). It was grossly under-designed and intentionally incapable of satisfying the M.O.E.'s Control Order demanding full hydraulic containment in all aquifers on the Uniroyal site. The M.O.E. however, similar to the Waterloo Region District School Board, seemed to feel that if Participation Medals were O.K. for kids then surely they were fine for God fearing, Christian espousing, local, chemical polluters. So for close to six years UPAC carried on with very few formal citizens on their “citizens' committee”. Woolwich and all the other government authorities who abandoned Elmira residents never clarified intelligently the Ministry abandoning their own Control Order. They did however carry on with both APTE and the Environmental Hazards Team routinely factually undermining Uniroyal/Crompton's bullcrap while speaking from around the table as full citizens with rights, whether formal members of UPAC/CPAC or not. This is in stark contrast as to how the power and authority shifted after 2000 when former councillor Pat McLean assumed the Chair's position at CPAC with support from mayor Billy Strauss.\n\nDNAPLS have floundered ever since with highs and lows but never any real action or removal. Quoting Richard Clausi “When all was said and done, more was said than was done.” Both Jaimie Connelly and Mr. Ruland (hydrog's) seemed to get their sh*# together somewhere around 2007 and wrote some more than average honest opinions on the presence of DNAPLS but it was either poorly distributed, buried or forgotten. All of these reports are available but don't expect Woolwich, MECP, Lanxess or GHD to voluntarily cough them up. Fortunately, fortuitively and perhaps pre-emptively I've got copies of most of these documents. Of course over the decades I've produced documentation to videographers, reporters, and citizens. Funny isn't it how seldom to never any of the corrupt bodies have asked me for written backup of this or that. The cowards.\n\nWith enough accurate technical evidence to support the presence of both residual and free phase DNAPL, the issue seems to have a life of it's own. It's a lot like the real DNAPL itself. It's the engine that could. It's a very bad contaminant but despite official, corrupt attempts to bury it over the decades it's still the albatross hanging around Uniroyal and successors' heads. Wake up long retired APTE members. Sylvia 's been long gone for decades but she sure hoodwinked you guys in order to get Richard, Esther and I off of APTE.\n\nCurrently Sandy has appointed a five minute wonder to be Chair of TRAC. Geez after Dr. Richard Jackson, then Tiffany Svensson and now Nathan has the standard ever plummeted. I mean I grant you with Pat McLean the Chair from 2000 on it was bad, but really Nathan? I suggested in my missive from last Saturday the 13th that Woolwich Council needed to step up and get an independent and honest hydrogeologist hired to work here in Elmira providing peer reviews of reports and more of all the crap that continues to flow downgradient. That of course is what I've been doing for decades but of course our litany of councillors are far to sophisticated and worse to do any such thing. They are also far too inexperienced still yet to know how they are being constantly played. At least some of them.\n\nGetting back to Nathan there is nothing more provoking than a five minute wonder with absolutely zero experience having the nerve to even comment in contradiction of an event that occurred ten, fifteen or twenty years ago, to someone who was there, participated and fought that particular battle.\n\nHere's my second challenge to Woolwich Council. So far no feedback on my strong suggestion that you send me an independent hydrogeologist to sit down with me for several hours to learn where the hydrogeologic skeletons are buried. If you are unwilling, unable or just plain chicken-sh*# then hear's my second challenge. Close to twenty years ago I was constantly trying to get Susan to sit with me in a public DEBATE against Crompton/Chemtura & Conestoga Rovers (CRA) . I assured Susan that the two of us could easily smoke that pack of unscrupulous swine and we could have. Today Susan would have to sit with Lanxess because I find debating with a knife in my back uncomfortable. So here's the challenge:\n\nI'M TWENTY YEARS OLDER BUT NO SMARTER. WITH HONEST RULES NOT SET UNILATERALLY BY YOU I CHALLENGE WOOLWICH TOWNSHIP TO A PUBLIC DEBATE. YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY AS YOU WANT AGAINST ME BUT EACH SIDE, NOT PERSON, WILL HAVE EQUAL TIME TO SPEAK.\n\nThere will be independent time keepers, recorders and media present.\n\nAlan Marshall\n\n00:34 • 3 days ago\n\nKW Habilitation\n\nJuly 22, 2024: What’s Happening in Your Neighbourhood!\n\n♦\n\nGet ready to groove at the Wayback Festival on July 26 – 27, 2024!

July 2024\n\nThe Backing Bookworm\n\nOne Big Happy Family\n\n♦\n\nOne Big Happy Family is a story that has a great 'locked room' setting in a secluded boutique hotel right before a massive storm is about to hit. A very dysfunctional family meets at this hotel that is owned by their family to hear the reading of the will of their not-so-dear old dad.\n\nThe Bishop sisters, Vicki, Faith and Iris, along with a couple of spouses and kids have more baggage than Samsonite, many axes to grind and even more secrets they'd rather keep hidden. The cast also includes the lawyer who has come to read the will and a few staff members, including nineteen-year-old Charley, an extremely naïve, down-on-her-luck chamber maid at the family-owned hotel who tells the story.\n\nThe story is divided into four parts, but despite the short chapters, this was an extremely sloooowww story that will require readers to suspend disbelief. We get the backstory on several characters which explains the animosity, but I found many of them to be caricatures with the rhyming teen too odd and over-the-top. There are some good dysfunctional family secret reveals (a la Jerry Springer) but the actual mystery and Charley as the protagonist were weak and the culprit blatantly obvious from the start.\n\nWhile this wasn't a good fit for me, but if you're looking for an atmospheric family drama with murder and colourful but despicable characters and a locked room mystery vibe, you may want to give One Big Happy Family a try.\n\nDisclaimer: Thanks to St Martin's Press for the advanced copy of this book which was provided in exchange for my honest review.\n\nMy Rating: 2.5 starsAuthor: Jamie DayGenre: SuspenseType and Source: ebook from publisher via NetGalleyPublisher: St Martin's PressFirst Published: July 16, 2024\n\nBook Description from GoodReads: The newest, riveting summer suspense by the author of The Block Party, Jamie Day.\n\nThe Precipice is a legendary, family-owned hotel on the rocky coast of Maine. With the recent passing of their father, the Bishop sisters—Iris, Vicki, and Faith—have come for the weekend to claim it. But with a hurricane looming and each of the Bishop sisters harboring dangerous secrets, there's murder in the air—and not everyone who checks into the Precipice will be checking out.\n\nEach sister wants what is rightfully hers, and in the mix is the Precipe's nineteen-year-old chambermaid Charley Kelley: smart, resilient, older than her years, and in desperate straits.\n\nThe arrival of the Bishop sisters could spell disaster for Charley. Will they close the hotel? Fire her? Discover her habit of pilfering from guests? Or even worse, learn that she's using a guest room to hide a woman on the run.\n\nWith razor-sharp wit, heart, thrills, and twists, Jamie Day delivers a unique brand of SUMMERTIME SUSPENSE.\n\n♦\n\n23:40 • 2 days ago\n\nKitchener Panthers\n\nPanthers pile up runs, but lose third straight game\n\n♦\n\nLONDON - Another high scoring affair goes the wrong way.\n\nAn eight-run seventh innings proved to the difference as the London Majors took down the Kitchener Panthers 16-13 Sunday afternoon.\n\nSix lead changes came about in this back-and-forth affair, which also saw 11 different pitchers come into the game.\n\nBoth Blake Jacklin and Raul Gonzalez went four-for-five. Gonzalez led the way with three runs driven in, while Jacklin hit his second triple of the season.\n\nNick Parsons extended his hitting streak to 15 games with a single, while Nolan Misa has hits in seven straight outings.\n\nAJ Karosas hit his first home run of the season as part of a four-run third inning for Kitchener. That made it 5-2 visitors at that point. London scored four of its own in the bottom half of the inning to make it 6-5.\n\nThe Panthers got the lead back with a four-run sixth inning, but disaster struck in the seventh.\n\nLondon posted eight runs on seven hits, sending 13 batters to the plate and forcing three pitching changes in a lengthy 35 minutes of action.\n\nJose Vasquez saw the lions share of action on the hill, going four innings and giving up seven runs (six earned) on eight hits. He fanned six batters and walked two.\n\nAdam Robertson was tagged with the loss. He came on in the seventh and walked three straight batters before he was taken out. Those three batters all came in to score to give London the lead.\n\nJonathan Henry collected the win for London. He gave up one run on two hits in an inning of work.\n\nKitchener has now lost its last two games by a combined score of 35-30.\n\nThe Panthers have lost three straight games after winning six of its previous seven.\n\nKitchener will host Hamilton Thursday night for our Christmas in July game! First pitch is at 7:30 p.m.\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS NOW and #PackTheJack!\n\nBOXSCOREGAME REPLAY\n\n21:34 • 2 days ago\n\nAndrew Coppolino\n\nA bit about … harissa\n\nReading Time: 2 minutes\n\n♦\n\nHarissa [hah-REE-suh]\n\nI thought we’d take a look at harissa, a spice paste found widely in Middle East cookery. There are several locations where you can find the spice in many grocery stores and specialty shops.\n\nIt may appear in brands with the lovely name “Harissa du Cap Bon El Manara de Djerba,” and likely makes a welcome appearance on restaurant menu too.\n\nIt’s a delicious and important condiment that has an interesting food history that flies under the radar.\n\n♦Harissa paste in a heart-shaped quenelles (Photo/andrewcoppolino.com).\n\nThe spice-blend is often made from oil, chiles, garlic, cumin, caraway, coriander and sometimes dried mint. It’s usually served with dried meats, soups and couscous.\n\nHailing from the Maghreb -— the northwest of Africa along the Mediterranean -— harissa is a special favourite in Tunisia.\n\nThe chiles likely came to Maghrebian cuisine by way of Spanish conquistadors to North and Central America — before they occupied Tunisia in the mid-1500s and after having been in the New World. It’s likely harissa got its start in Tunisia and Algeria at about this time.\n\nThe spicing is not particularly hot in terms of the Scoville scale and the ingredient may even be added to breakfast dishes in northern Africa. I once had harissa on a crispy duck salad that was repared with arugula, celery, cashews, citrus vinaigrette, fresh ricotta, figs and dried fruit.\n\nSimply delicious and a good addition to your pantry. Give it a try, if you haven’t already.\n\nCheck out my latest post A bit about … harissa from AndrewCoppolino.com.\n\n11:54 • 2 days ago\n\nJames Davis Nicoll\n\nSet Sail With Me / The Lost Continent By C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne\n\nC. J. Cutcliffe Hyne’s 1899’s The Lost Continent is a stand-alone tale of Atlantean tragedy.\n\nCoppinger is an avid amateur archaeologist, a man who understood immediately the historical significance of the ancient documents found in a Canary Islands cave. Alas for posterity, the person who actually explored the cave was Coppinger’s unnamed companion, whose off-handedly brutal handling of the relics inadvertently destroyed a good part of them. Nevertheless, what remains paints a vivid picture of the final days of fabled Atlantis.\n\nPious, austere priest-general Deucalion has been pleased to govern Yucatan on behalf of Atlantis. His twenty-year reign ends when the empress orders Deucalion replaced. Deucalion is to return to the mid-Atlantic continent he has not seen in a generation.\n\nDeucalion’s successor, Tatho, is gracious enough to warn Deucalion about what awaits stern Deucalion.\n\n…\n\n06:00 • 3 days ago\n\nFriday, 19. July 2024\n\nCode Like a Girl\n\nGet Out of Our Silos, and Other Actions for Allies\n\nEach week, Karen Catlin shares five simple actions to create a more inclusive workplace and be a better ally.♦1. Get out of our silos\n\nLast weekend, after the assassination attempt on former U.S. President Donald Trump, President Joe Biden addressed the nation. He urged us to stand together: “While we may disagree, we are not enemies. We’re neighbors, we’re friends, coworkers, citizens.”\n\nBiden also said, “Here in America, we need to get out of our silos, where we only listen to those with whom we agree, where misinformation is rampant, where foreign actors fan the flames of our division to shape the outcomes consistent with their interests, not ours.”\n\nMinutes later, Trump posted “UNITE AMERICA!” on his Truth Social account. And he pledged to use his upcoming Republican Convention speech to unite the nation rather than attack Biden. Source (Note: I wrote this newsletter before Thursday night’s speech.)\n\nI found myself thinking about something I heard Dr. Bernice King, CEO of the King Center, say at a conference a few years ago. She also emphasized the importance of getting out of our silos (yes, those exact words Biden used in his speech) and connecting with coworkers in a real way. She encouraged us to be curious and understand their world. To learn where they are. To give them space and place to have genuine and honest conversations.\n\nFor example, she told us about a woman who wanted to remove the Confederate flag from a government building. Instead of getting angry and defensive when a man pushed back, she asked why the flag was important to him — not to trick him but to understand him.\n\nIn turn, he then asked her why it was important to her to remove the flag.\n\nThey were able to have a genuine, honest, and productive conversation.\n\nAllies, let’s all strive to get out of our silos and have such conversations ourselves. In our personal lives and at work.\n\nTo do so myself, I’ll rely on some of my favorite clarifying questions:\n\n“Tell me more.”\n\n“What makes you say that?”\n\n“Why is that important to you?”\n\nI hope you’ll join me.\n\nShare this action on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Threads, or YouTube.\n\n2. Look out for all-dude events\n\nLast week, I came across a LinkedIn post about a Digital Asset Roundtable that “was a fantastic session, where practitioners, builders and leaders from across the industry were able to explore and build consensus. And a shared commitment to scale our infrastructure and delivery for our clients.”\n\nIt included a photo of 19 smiling people, all appearing to be men. Many, if not all, are white.\n\nAnother day, another all-dude event. 🤦\n\nLet’s check the invite list for the next exclusive, important event you receive. If it lacks diversity, take a minute to consider who is missing. Someone who could contribute to the conversation, thinking, problem-solving, and strategic direction setting. Someone your firm or industry needs to remain relevant and grow.\n\nAnd score them an invite.\n\np.s. If you have an assistant who screens your emails and manages your calendar, ask them to be on the lookout for events lacking diversity, too.\n\n3. Repeat yourself when asked\n\nI recently started following Casual Ableism, an Instagram account that raises awareness of ableism by sharing real situations. Here’s one of their posts that I found especially helpful:\n\n“The amount of times, as a HOH [hard of hearing] person, I need to ask people to repeat themselves and they just say ‘don’t worry about it’ or ‘I’ll just tell you later.’ It’s not hard to try again. It’s not hard to include and accommodate.”\n\nWhen someone asks us to repeat ourselves, let’s do so right then and there.\n\n4. Write respectfully about disabilities\n\nLast week, subscriber Carolyne Taylor shared the first item in my newsletter at their weekly “Wake Up HR” event for the CPHR BC & Yukon community. Some members who are disability experts pointed out that my terminology could be better phrased as “people with disabilities” versus “disabled people.”\n\nI regularly get comments about using person-first language (“people with disabilities”) or identity-first language (“disabled people”) from disabled people and disability experts, and there doesn’t seem to be a consensus. Opinions also seem to vary depending on geography and personal preference.\n\nAnd as explained in this article from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), some groups prefer one style over the other. For example, many people in the Deaf community and many in the autism community prefer identity-first language.\n\nThe article includes, “If writing generally, experts suggest defaulting to person-first language when writing about children and using a mix of person-first and identity-first language when writing about adults or autistic individuals generally.”\n\nI should have used a mix in the first item in my newsletter last week.\n\nOne last thing: Let’s respect the language others use to describe themselves. Read more in this cautionary tale I shared last year.\n\n5. Community Spotlight: Review past editions of “5 Ally Actions” with your team\n\nThis week’s spotlight on an ally action from the Better Allies community is from a subscriber who wrote,\n\n“I meet with a small group of colleagues quarterly to discuss various leadership topics. Our next session will be to review your archived newsletters, choose a topic from one of your weekly messages, and take 10 minutes or so to talk about the topic. We will share how it’s relevant to us and why we wanted to learn more about it.”\n\nI love it. If you’d like to do a similar exercise with your team, you can find my archived newsletters online.\n\nAnd I’d like to learn from you next. What’s one step you’ve taken to be a better ally? Please reply to this email and tell me about it. And please mention if I can quote you by name or credit you anonymously in an upcoming newsletter.\n\nThat’s all for this week. I wish you strength and safety as we all move forward.\n\n— Karen Catlin (she/her), author of the Better Allies® book series\n\nCopyright © 2024 Karen Catlin.

And we sold out and could have sold more.”\n\nCouturier-Bernard said he’s done several collaborations with Ottawa restaurants, but this was his first with a food truck.\n\nHis new venture will draw on the heritage and recipes of his Acadian grandmother’s kitchen and those of his Franco-Ontarian roots.\n\nFor their regular service since 2021, Pearson Street has been something of a landmark in Yahoo Park where their customers have access to picnic tables and covered seating for about 40; there’s a ball diamond nearby, a splash pad and playground, hockey rink and a bowling alley adjacent.\n\nThere perhaps couldn’t be a better venue for smashing burgers, a favourite food of Chris Pearson.\n\n“For some reason, I just love burgers and the smash burger got my attention,” he said. “But we elevate that and add some more quality. The patties aren’t pre-formed and frozen. We’re fresh to order, and we felt that was something we could add to the food scene here in Embrun.”\n\nFor the rest of the story, visit Andre Paquette Editions.\n\n[Banner photo/Kris Pearson]\n\nCheck out my latest post Pearson Street smashburgers from AndrewCoppolino.com.\n\n17:51 • 4 days ago\n\nAgilicus Blog\n\nOperate Your Plant Virtually with Agilicus AnyX\n\n♦ Introduction\n\nThe demand for remote plant operation is increasing in today’s ever-changing industrial environment.

The Backbone Team is now operating with 36% fewer team members and about 18% lower capacity. The reduction in CYPT Backbone Staff capacity will mean that the speed of some CYPT work will slow down. Read below for more details and how we are mitigating.\n\nThank you Monika, Haniya, Julnar, and Kian\n\nProgram Assistant, Monika Bodemer. Fondly known as the “Backbone of the Backbone Team,” she expertly managed everything from finances, to correspondence, to procurement, to event planning… and much more. We will miss Monika, but we wish her all the best as she starts a new job in Alberta!\n\nThree Youth Connectors, Haniya Nazir, Julnar Aizouki, and Kian Mirzaei. The Youth Connectors are three youth hired on one-year contracts who work alongside us at the CYPT. They are advisors, planners, coordinators, and spokespeople at the CYPT. You may have read about their work and accomplishments in news articles or seen them at our events. This year’s group of Youth Connectors were extraordinary leaders and we will miss them!\n\nReduced Administrative Support\n\nPlease understand that without a dedicated Program Assistant, we may be slower than usual in responding to your messages.\n\nSevil Berenji is temporarily picking up most of the work that Monika was holding. This means that her typical project management support will reduce. We expect this to be the case for the next six months. Please connect with Sevil (SBerenji@regionofwaterloo.ca) as a first point of contact at the CYPT.\n\nReduced Youth Engagement Work\n\nOur Youth Engagement Team is now a team of one: Joana Lincho, Youth Engagement in Systems Lead. We have structured the fall to be best suited to this capacity. This means that Sense Making with the 2023 Youth Impact Survey data and the creation of the next Data in Action report will be happening, but at a slower pace.\n\nQuestions?\n\nWe appreciate your understanding at this time. If you have any questions please reach out to Alison Pearson, Manager of the CYPT, at APearson@regionofwaterloo.ca.\n\nThe post Reduced Capacity on the Backbone Team appeared first on Children and Youth Planning Table.\n\n15:57 • 4 days ago\n\nElmira Advocate\n\nSUMMER IN THE CITY\n\nSorry folks but I've been slacking off.

I felt safe.”\n\nMayerly came to Canada in June 2022 with her husband Samir and teenaged son, Juan, fleeing political unrest in their home country of Colombia.\n\n“There were death threats against my family,” said Mayerly. “We had to leave.”\n\nThey left with just one bag of belongings, and had to start over.\n\nWith support through House of Friendship’s Neighbourhoods programs, Mayerly’s family got help – whether it was helping find furniture for their empty home, or help navigating a new world while struggling with a foreign language.\n\n“We didn’t know anything,” said Mayerly. “And with the language barrier, I didn’t know how to ask for help.”\n\nWhen Mayerly still lived in Colombia, she specialized in mechanical engineering, and worked in a factory. Today, she works as a cleaner, alongside her husband.\n\nMayerly and her family have to rely on the Neighbourhoods Food Program at Kingsdale Community Centre to get by.\n\n“It makes such a difference to us,” said Mayerly. “It’s one less problem to think about.”\n\nMayerly appreciates the help so much that she volunteers every week, giving back where she can.\n\nMayerly also participates in a cooking program offered through the community centre, which gives her the chance to learn new ways of cooking some of the food she receives, as well as practice her English.\n\n“I’ve learned a lot about cooking, and I’ve made some friends,” said Mayerly.\n\nBeing able to build a sense of community is making it easier for Mayerly’s family to feel more at home.\n\n“My son is very happy here in Canada,” said Mayerly. “He can go out with his friends. We are at ease, and don’t have to worry”\n\nYour support of Neighbourhoods programs at House of Friendship is providing the kind of wraparound support that families like Mayerly’s need – thank you!\n\nThe post You are Providing A New Life for Mayerly appeared first on House Of Friendship.\n\n13:00 • 4 days ago\n\nAndrew Coppolino\n\nEggs [by LeGrand] Benedict\n\nReading Time: < 1 minute\n\n♦\n\nA breakfast favourite, Eggs Benedict is one of those food phrases with a dubious origin and namesake. They are, of course, delicious, but how did the name evolve? The story is as good as the eating.\n\nEssentially eggs with an egg sauce, you make eggs Benedict with an English muffin, some Canadian back bacon and a French sauce, so it’s a sort of Canuck-Anglo-French breakfast or brunch.\n\nThe poached eggs in the dish are given a generous blanketing of Hollandaise sauce, traditionally made in a double-boiler — butter, egg yolks and lemon juice.\n\n♦Eggs Benedict by The Bruce Hotel, Stratford / andrewcoppolino.com\n\nAs for the name, it may have all started at the famous Delmonico’s in Manhattan.\n\nA couple of spoiled-rich patrons whined that there was nothing new on the lunch menu, so staff whipped up the eggs with the classic French sauce to assuage them.\n\nAlternatively, it was a chef Charles Ranhofer and Waldorf Hotel creation in about 1860.\n\nEither way, someone named Benedict, it could have been LeGrand or Lemuel, and his wife who were likely the snooty whiners asking for something new.\n\nAs always, the lore of the kitchen and food history is murky and sometimes confused — but interesting nevertheless.\n\nCheck out my latest post Eggs [by LeGrand] Benedict from AndrewCoppolino.com.\n\n11:25 • 4 days ago\n\nJesse Roders\n\nWaterloo Region is its own startup ecosystem\n\n♦\n\nIt has been a decade or so of the Toronto-Waterloo corridor and it is time to break up. In treating it as one big ecosystem, it has left Waterloo in a relative state of quiet. At least “that is what people say” and the numbers of new companies and funding deals do support the perception.\n\n♦From briefed.in — this isn’t accurate but if you consider how many YC companies alone are Waterloo alumni but not based in Waterloo since 2022. It makes sense people think nothing is happening in Waterloo.\n\nIt’s not true.\n\nWaterloo is not a ghost town. The talent coming through the Universities is on display with Socratica, there are a lot more experienced founders building and helping, and it’s the fastest-growing region in the country.\n\nToronto is amazing. If you look past the inability to traverse the city, there are a lot of new companies, spaces, events, etc and it is exciting.\n\nThe builders are in Waterloo and they proudly share their connection\n\nSince 2022 there 0 YC-Waterloo companies reporting they are in Canada but there are 11 reporting they are in the US and I bet there are more. Before 2022, 24 reported they were in Canada and 21 in the US.\n\nThe universities attract ambitious people and they build a connection to the community but if the community doesn’t have its own identity, why would they stay? Especially when Buildspace and other things in the valley welcome them.\n\nThe reality of remote teams does have an impact but due to how founders come to the area, knowing there is an active ecosystem and accessing it is extra important. Beeper’s dev team was in Waterloo (no one knew that), Hive raised a round in 2023 and they are growing, other AI companies, etc.\n\nNo more hyphens. We need to see other ecosystems.\n\nIt is time we start standing on our own again. Waterloo is a scrappy region of builders who just get shit done. No flash. Just hard work and a community mindset.\n\nThe ability to quickly adopt leading-edge technology is why inventors of things like PHP and Ethereum come to school here. Practical and powerful smartphones, smart watches, huge software companies, medical technology, defence, security, Quantum research, etc.\n\nWe figure stuff out. Connect with global markets and usually spend more time in San Francisco, New York, or anywhere else than Toronto.\n\nIt’s time to keep building Waterloo. We will always love Toronto and hang out as friends. But we need to be free to experience the world on our own.\n\n♦\n\nWaterloo Region is its own startup ecosystem was originally published in whoyoucallingajesse on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.\n\n10:40 • 4 days ago\n\nBarndoor Creative\n\nRibbon of Dirt - Documentary Teaser\n\n-/-\n\n13:15 • over a year ago\n\nAgilicus Blog\n\nAgilicus: Municipal Cybersecurity Success Stories from Across Canada\n\n-/-\n\n17:10 • 8 months ago\n\nJames Davis Nicoll\n\nDo You Think You Can Tell? / Linghun By Ai Jiang\n\nAi Jiang’s 2023 Linghun is a stand-alone coming-of-age/ghost-story novella.\n\nWenqi is a prudent sort of person, one who would avoid a haunted house.

Claw back after claw back.\n\nBut at the end of a wild, near four-hour affair - a game that started 15 minutes late due to travel issues - the Toronto Maple Leafs held on for a 19-17 win over the Kitchener Panthers Thursday night at Jack Couch Park.\n\nThings seemed well in hand for Kitchener. A 7-1 lead after the fourth, home runs from Simon Grinberg, Eric Martin and Raul Gonzalez, Yadian Martinez was cooking on the mound.\n\nThat was until the sixth inning.\n\nCharlie Towers highlighted a seven-run sixth with a three-run home run to give Toronto the 8-7 lead.\n\nThe bottom of the inning had its share of drama. Kitchener would take back the lead, but not before an interaction between Toronto's Angel Castro and Gonzalez after the Cuban infielder was hit by a pitch.\n\nCastro was pulled in the same instance. He also went 5.2 innings, surrendering nine runs on 11 hits, striking out six and walking one. He later got thrown out by the home plate umpire.\n\nKitchener's lead didn't last long. Toronto would post another touchdown on the board the next inning to flip the tables and take a six run lead, make it 15-9.\n\nKitchener got it to 15-14, and spent the rest of the game clawing back. But Toronto had an answer each time.\n\nBlake Jacklin and Tyler Hinrikus also went yard for Kitchener.\n\nEight of Kitchener's nine starters registered a hit. Gonzalez's single in the third inning put him at 100 career IBL hits.\n\nJacklin, Martin and Nolan Misa all had three hits on the night. Spenser Ross, fresh off consideration for an IBL Batter of the Week nod, kept rolling with a one-for-four outing to extend his hit streak to five games.\n\nMartin's hit streak was extended to seven games, dating back to his final game of 2023.\n\nToronto had seven batters register multi-hit games. Four of them, Jose Vinicio, Marcus Knecht, Dan Marra and Towers, had three hits apiece.\n\nKitchener is off until Sunday when they visit London for a 1:05 p.m. first pitch.\n\nThe next home game is next Thursday, July 25 against Hamilton at 7:30 p.m.\n\nGET YOUR TICKETS NOW and #PackTheJack!\n\nBOXSCOREGAME REPLAYPOSTGAME ANALYSIS\n\n04:23 • 5 days ago\n\nChild Witness Centre\n\nSummer 2024 Newsletter\n\nWe are happy to share some exciting news and updates with you!\n\nThe post Summer 2024 Newsletter first appeared on Child Witness Centre.\n\n02:36 • 5 days ago\n\nACCKWA\n\nMadge and Lynn #KissHIVGoodbye\n\n-/-\n\n17:30 • over a year ago\n\nACCKWA\n\n#KissHIVGoodbye3\n\n-/-\n\n20:13 • over a year ago\n\nThursday, 18.
