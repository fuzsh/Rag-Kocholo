Allen Baker - Director, Business Development WATERLOO REGION 2001 Canada’s Technology Triangle PricewaterhouseCoopers PricewaterhouseCoopers <strong>tech</strong>watchTM WATERLOO REGION’S TEN FASTEST GROWING TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ATS Klaus Woerner, President and CEO If you ever have the pleasure to meet Klaus Woerner, President and CEO of ATS, ask him why he moved to Waterloo Region and why he is still here. You will walk away feeling that Waterloo Region is the best area in the world… and Klaus should know, he has lived here for almost 40 years. Klaus is a textbook example that hard work and determination pays off. He moved here in the early sixties and the move wasn’t by accident. Klaus chose to move to the area because of Waterloo Region’s reputation then. Asked if anything has changed, Klaus replied, “it’s a lot bigger, but still has the same ethics and it is still the best place to be living in and operating a business in.” An amazing pipeline of people has helped to fuel ATS’s growth. Per Klaus, “for skilled tradespeople the apprenticeship out of Conestoga College is the best system in the country. For engineering disciplines, the University of Waterloo and Conestoga have well-established programs. Finding people is no issue.” ATS’s biggest challenge right now is coping with growth. Klaus credits ATS’s well diversified customer base for the Company’s relatively recession-proof position. Even in this downturn market, ATS is attracting significant <strong>new</strong> contracts. ATS is a Waterloo Region success story with a founder who is proud to say ‘his roots are very deep in the Region.” DALSA Brian Doody, President Ask Brian Doody, President of DALSA why Waterloo and you get a simple answer — The University. Brian states ‘the company began in Waterloo because the “founder – Dr. Savaas Chamberlain – was a professor in electrical engineering at the University of Waterloo, a professor in electrical engineering”. Brian expands by explaining that “the capability and services that the engineering group at the University was able to provide was a key to why we stayed here… we had access to good people who were trained in the areas the company has been focused in. And since then, we have built up a good team of people who really like the area, people who don’t want to live in Toronto, or have built families here and like the <strong>size</strong> of the area. For me, that’s pretty important, to be able to raise a family and have services and features of the community that are great for a family”. Brian clearly believes in the power of people saying “a strong supply of very skilled and very qualified people… that’s what really breeds <strong>tech</strong>nology”. Descartes Systems Group Peter Schwartz, Chairman and CEO When asked where he sees <strong>tech</strong>nology going in the next three years, Peter Schwartz, Chairman and CEO of Descartes, sees “massive movement underway, with Descartes active in that transition.” Peter sees his industry changing dramatically and one of his biggest challenges at the moment is education. “People just understanding that this is going to happen, and that’s the stage that we are at now as a company educating people on why this makes sense.” That and finding qualified people, “there is no one who has done what we are doing and therefore it is all about finding intelligent and motivated people who can help understand (a) how to preserve what the good of our business in the past was and (b) operate in the spirit of the way our business will operate in the future. That’s why we like having access to the talent pool that the University of Waterloo spins out every year and we think they are a fabulous example of an educational institution that understands the needs of business, specifically, the <strong>tech</strong>nology business.” But it’s not just the university, Peter himself has his own personal reasons why he enjoys Waterloo. “This is an excellent community to live in and certainly to raise a family in. Companies like Descartes, appeal typically to younger people, who are at the early stages of starting or thinking about starting a family and Waterloo is certainly an excellent area to do that from the standpoint of the cost of living to crime rates to all the rest of it. And I think the fact that Waterloo is investing so aggressively in the types of things that will make this a great place to live, whether that be RIM Park or some of the investments that are happening downtown also supports the fact that Waterloo wants to continue being what they were and in fact get better.” Fakespace Carol Leaman, President, Fakespace Haven’t heard of Fakespace Systems? Then you haven’t heard of the world’s leading supplier of advanced visualization systems and services for organizations involved in product design, natural resource development, military planning, education, and scientific research. Carol Leaman, Fakespace’s president, sees “nothing but upside” as she takes the lead in driving this niche business mainstream. Carol sees significant <strong>new</strong> advances in computer graphics <strong>tech</strong>nology which will lead to quantum leaps in demand and more growth for Fakespace. As it is, customers consistently think that Fakespace is a larger company than it actually is. When asked why the company is located in Waterloo Region when more than 90% of Fakespace’s sales are outside Canada, Carol quickly pointed out that customers don’t care – “location doesn’t matter once customers get to know you. Waterloo Region is an ideal place, with great people, lower operating costs and an excellent network of suppliers.” Equally impressive is the fact that Carol and her team completed a private financing in February 2001 – about the time when funds for high-<strong>tech</strong> companies looked like they had all but dried up. As for an encore, Carol is ready to take on a bigger challenge. “We need to get on with it – despite the current economic downturn it’s not time to allow ourselves to get stuck in a rut. Growth is going to happen and we need to be prepared for it.” Kaparel Ben Robitaille, President and CEO Ben Robitaille, President and CEO of Kaparel has not been discouraged by the less than stellar 2001 sales results. In fact, it has been quite the opposite. Ben has met the challenge head on and has repositioned the company with impressive results. The number of design wins that Kaparel has earned in the first three quarters of the 2001 year already exceeds the total for the previous year. The expectation is that once those designs come through sales could triple or quadruple previous levels. Per Ben, “this year we need to really work at it to make the Company grow. There are good indicators in Waterloo Region though. The <strong>tech</strong>nology industry has been falling down but there still is a lot of activity in Waterloo Region. That’s a good tell sign here of where things are going.” Ben has been in Waterloo Region now for three and a half years and in that time he has already seen amazing growth. And he’s impressed. He sees everything in this area going in the right direction. “Money is staying here. People are reinvesting the money they made in <strong>tech</strong> companies here.” In light of the <strong>tech</strong>nology economy both locally and in general, Ben’s plan for Kaparel includes “rethinking, refocusing and pushing hard for more design wins.” He’s determined that Kaparel will emerge a strong player. The Perimeter Institute From left to right: Tom Jenkins - Open Text, Brian Doody - DALSA, David Crouch - Northern Digital, Carol Leaman - Fakespace, Ben Robitaille - Kaparel, Yvan Couture - Mitra Mitra Yvan Couture, Executive Vice President Yvan, the executive vice-president of Mitra, has a unique problem in this downturn economy. Mitra can’t grow fast enough. Yvan is a genuine person who speaks proudly of Mitra and the Company’s successes, but he is also a man who is concerned with work-life balance and it is quickly apparent that his family is very important to him. When discussing the current economic downturn, Yvan empha<strong>size</strong>d that the “dot.com crash was a good thing” and that “during the dot.com boom, fundamentally strong companies were overshadowed.” He is confident “real <strong>tech</strong>nology companies will survive and prosper.” As for Mitra, their business “has seen nothing of a downturn. The healthcare business has not spent money on <strong>tech</strong>nology before and they have to catch-up. Healthcare has to deliver better services with less money and the way to make things easier and quicker is to use information <strong>tech</strong>nology. We have barely scratched the surface of demand.” When asked why Mitra has stayed in the Waterloo Region, Yvan replied, “not once have we ever wished we were in the US. We love that we are more cost competitive. We have great people and our standards are high… and in competing in the healthcare industry in the global market, Canada is seen as more progressive in healthcare. Personally, I love the schools, the opera, the symphony, decent theatre, shopping, and we are only 45 minutes from an international airport. I don’t know what more anyone would want.” Northern Digital Inc. David Crouch, President Speaking with David Crouch, President of Northern Digital Inc. (NDI) is an extremely positive experience. Despite significant slowing in the economy, David sees “strong opportunities” for his company’s products in untapped countries and market segments. Celebrating its 20th anniversary this year, NDI has diversified across three primary markets — industrial, research and medical – with products based on optical, magnetic and fibre-optic <strong>tech</strong>nologies. The medical market is fairly recession-proof, “focusing on solutions that save money and require less time in hospital,” David said. Enthusiastic and confident, David says his current challenges focus on quality, “truly understanding what customers are asking for and developing, manufacturing and selling products that meet those requirements.” Proudly Canadian, David is quick to point out that being Canadian has helped to open doors for his company in 25 countries around the world. So much so that he highlights NDI’s Canadian roots in all of the company’s corporate sales presentations. As for the Waterloo Region specifically, says David, “worldwide we have discovered a great deal of recognition for this region, largely because of the reputation of the companies that have come before and the efforts of Canada’s Technology Triangle and Communi<strong>tech</strong>,\\. I couldn’t see us moving. The area provides all the things we need. All of the infrastructure is present and we are able to attract the talent we need.” Open Text Tom Jenkins, CEO Tom Jenkins, CEO of Open Text, is a man with unbelievable spirit. Totally undeterred by the current <strong>tech</strong>nology slowdown, as he focuses on the future. Per Tom, “we need a breather once in a while. We have to sit back and consolidate. However, over the next five years be prepared –<strong>tech</strong>nology will be essential.” Why the optimism? Because for Tom, <strong>tech</strong>nology is about improving productivity, “at the heart is a more efficient way of doing things. The most successful <strong>tech</strong> companies have figured out how to apply <strong>tech</strong>nology to make things more efficient.” Tom speaks from experience. Open Text is wellrecognized as a company that makes things more efficient, which raises the level of demand for their software. Even in this market Open Text is growing at about 30%. Open Text is a fantastic Waterloo success story with phenomenal growth over the past five years, which has allowed Open Text to reach a major milestone this year; they now employ 1400 people. Per Tom, “Open Text has been fortunate to be in the right place with the right product.” and that right place has been Waterloo. Tom loves the area, “it’s the ultimate family setting. It’s close to everywhere. Waterloo has all of the infrastructure of a cosmopolitan area but is five minutes to a cornfield. It’s a gorgeous lifestyle. It has balance and it’s hard to create these synergies anywhere else.” Research In Motion Michael Lazaridis, President, Co-CEO and Director Why is RIM in Waterloo? Mike Lazaridis, President and Co-CEO responds frankly: “We decided to build the factory next to the mine.” In this case, the factory is RIM and the mine is the world-class universities in Waterloo. Mike emphatically states: “Our universities are the core of our community’s prosperity.” He is equally direct when asked about the economic downturn. “This is really just a return to a ‘normal’ economy. Legitimate companies with ‘real’ products and services can prosper in today’s economy.” Mike explains how RIM succeeded in spite of the downturn: “RIM did not fall victim to all the hype that occurred over the last couple years. We stuck to our plan. We grew… and continue to grow… based on old-school principles and high-<strong>tech</strong> vision.” RIM is now a world leader and a strong anchor in the community. What challenges lie ahead? “Many of the challenges remain the same… but the scale is changing dramatically. As our business grows, we need to fuel our organization with education, inspiration and cohesion. We need to ensure that everyone understands and embraces the fundamental principles of RIM’s success. Virtek Phil Nafekh, President, Virtek Bio<strong>tech</strong> When asked what his biggest challenge is currently, Phil Nafekh, the <strong>new</strong>ly appointed President of Virtek Bio<strong>tech</strong>, quickly replies “forcing economics into the organization.” Bullish about the prospects of bio<strong>tech</strong>, Phil describes bio<strong>tech</strong>nology in general as “the fountain of youth, the chance to cure every disease, to live longer and to genetically <strong>map</strong>, or identify, all organisms.” Phil is passionate about his <strong>new</strong> role. He has thrown himself into creating a <strong>new</strong> culture, vision and mission in order to see Virtek Bio<strong>tech</strong> succeed. It’s hard to walk away from Phil without wanting to be part of that energy. Even when discussing the current economic downturn, his enthusiasm is contagious. Per Phil, “there’s a race going on and we can’t just walk and not run because we may be on the verge of a recession. Especially for us at Virtek, as we have worked hard to stay ahead of this challenge.” The Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo is one of only a handful of places in the world where world-renowned scientists come together just to discuss theories. The institute was made possible by a $100-million donation from Waterloo high-<strong>tech</strong> entrepreneur Mike Lazaridis, perhaps the largest private donation of its kind in Canadian history. Two of his colleagues, Jim Balsillie and Doug Fregin, are donating $10 million each. When asked why such a generous donation, Mike Lazaridis is passionate in his response. “Everything we have today, came from theoretical physics and we’re there, we’re at the next frontier. “The Institute is designed to allow the greatest physics minds in the world do what they do best. Think, discuss, plan and test their theories in order to find that next frontier. The institute is beginning to take shape in Waterloo. Why Waterloo for such a facility? Per Mike there is no better place for it. “If you want to build a physics institute, you build it next to the largest math faculty you can find. The University of Waterloo has the largest math faculty in the country and math is the foundation of physics.” The first few physicists have already moved into town, coming from as far as Greece, California and Germany. When its <strong>new</strong> building is finished beside Waterloo’s Silver Lake in spring 2003, the institute will be one of only a handful of such places in the world. It will bring together up to 70 world-renowned physicists who will be there just to think and talk, in the expectation that their collective creative ideas will lead to some <strong>new</strong> breakthrough in our understanding. Intended initial areas of concentration will include some, if not all of the following fields: quantum gravity, string theory, quantum information theory, foundations of quantum theory and elementary particle physics.
