        "text": "Atlas Institute for Veterans & Families\n\nMaking\n\nveterans feel\n\nseen and heard\n\nMaking veterans feel seen and heard\n\nAtlas bridges the divide between research and practice to help veterans and their families get the best possible mental healthcare. The visual ethos of the brand ties to the mythic hero who carries the weight of the world, and to the reference volumes that help us find our way in the world.\n\nInnovative Medicines Canada\n\nAdvocating\n\nfor an accessible\n\nhealthcare system\n\nAdvocating for an accessible healthcare system\n\nIMC helps ensure Canadians get the most from leading medicines and treatments. Through storytelling and social content, Stiff boosted awareness of IMC’s role in advocating for an accessible healthcare.\n\nCanadian Medical Association\n\nCo-creating\n\na better future\n\nof health\n\nCo-creating a better future of health\n\nCMA’s Impact 2040 strategy marked a major shift for the organization—from a focus on member service to leading major advocacy work nationwide. To build momentum, we created a narrative that captured healthcare in crisis and positioned CMA as an agent to lead change toward a sustainable, accessible healthcare system.\n\nLogiSense\n\nPunching\n\nabove your\n\nbilling class\n\nPunching above your billing class\n\nLogiSense is the leading usage-based billing platform in the market. Until recently, the Canadian-based billing software company was viewed as a scrappy underdog in an oversaturated market. We changed that—for the better.\n\nOpenText\n\nCapturing an interactive guide to the OpenVerse\n\nCapturing an interactive guide to the OpenVerse\n\nOpenText is one of the most dynamic yet unsung tech companies in Silicon Valley. We captured CEO Mark Barranchea’s vision of this evolving business and his technology philosophy—the OpenVerse—in a highly visual and interactive book inspired by images from the universe.\n\nCanadian International Arctic Centre\n\nRepositioning Canada’s\n\nvibrant north\n\nRepositioning Canada’s vibrant north\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada’s International Arctic Centre (CIAC) is one of the agencies responsible for implementing our country’s International Arctic Policy. We saw an opportunity for CIAC to amplify its mandate by telling the stories taking place in the Arctic.\n\nAbleTo\n\nClosing the employment gap\n\nClosing the employment gap\n\nThis campaign targets employers and busts their myths about workforce talent with visible and non-visible disabilities. The aim: stem the workforce shortage in Ottawa and help students and graduates living with disabilities find meaningful employment.\n\nEU in Canada\n\nBringing\n\nCanadians and\n\nthe EU closer\n\nBringing Canadians and the EU closer\n\nThe European Union in Canada aims to increase public knowledge and understanding of EU—Canada relations. We designed a social media strategy and brand to bolster these efforts.\n\nSEED Winnipeg Recognition Counts\n\nRecognizing\n\nskilled\n\nimmigrants\n\nRecognizing skilled immigrants\n\nThe SEED Recognition Counts (RC) program provides flexible, character-based loans to skilled immigrants to help with qualification recognition. To raise awareness and increase visibility of the loan program, the RC team required a tactical marketing plan that prioritized communication activities with the team’s limited internal capacity.\n\nOttawa Symphony Orchestra\n\nRevitalizing\n\nOttawa’s oldest\n\norchestra\n\nRevitalizing Ottawa’s oldest orchestra\n\nAging audiences. Decreasing attendance numbers. A bold move to a novel performance space. We combined these three factors to usher in a new era for the community orchestra.\n\nVeterans Affairs Canada\n\nDefining a\n\nveteran-centric\n\nvoice\n\nDefining a veteran-centric voice\n\nVeterans Affairs Canada (VAC) had a disconnected brand and a fundamental inability to connect with over 80% of the veteran community, leading to failure in reputation. The department required a major shift in perception.\n\nWAGE Canada\n\nGiving voice to women and LGBTQ2+\n\nGiving voice to women and LGBTQ2+\n\nEquity, diversity and inclusion is more than giving people seats at the table. It is giving them the opportunity to speak. We collaborated with WAGE to help people across Canada tell their stories of equality in action.\n\nTrellis\n\nRebranding in the COVID era of online retail\n\nRebranding in the COVID Era of Online Retail\n\nGrowth Vectors had the right product and team of experts to help new e-commerce sellers simplify selling and grow. But the start-up lacked the right narrative and visual identity to connect with audiences and stand out in a saturated market."
