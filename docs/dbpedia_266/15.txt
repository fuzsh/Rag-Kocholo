To select the period, open the dropdown and select it from the list. With the buttons ( - | + ) you go back or forward in time.

Rising and Setting: The hours in which the planets and other objects appear and disappear from the viewer may vary with respect to reality in a few minutes, because the center of the object is taken as a reference, the diameter is not taken into account.

Available objects

These are the astronomical objects or celestial bodies that we place in the astronomical sky viewer and about which we give information on this page. The main stars visible from Earth and that are visible at that time and from the selected location are also drawn in the viewfinder.

This application places each object in its place, but it does not take into account the possible shadows of other planets, for example, the moon always seems to be full, although it is not the case, if you want to know the lunar phase for any date, you can do it in our Moon Phases Calendar. Nor does it take into account the visible size of the objects, for example in some total solar eclipses the sun continues to look larger than the moon, this is because the moon has not been resized with respect to its distance from the earth. Think that it is an application to locate the stars.
