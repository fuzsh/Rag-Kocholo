However, the geographic pattern of inequalities in mortality within these countries is unknown. This study shows mathematically and graphically the geographic pattern of mortality inequalities by education in Spain.   Methods Data are from a nation-wide prospective study covering all persons living in Spain's 50 provinces in 2001. Individuals were classified in a cohort of subjects with low education and in another cohort of subjects with high education. Age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate from all causes and from leading causes of death in each cohort and mortality rate ratios in the low versus high education cohort were estimated by geographic coordinates and province.   Results Latitude but not longitude was related to mortality. In subjects with low education, latitude had a U-shaped relation to mortality. In those with high education, mortality from all causes, and from cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive diseases decreased with increasing latitude, whereas cancer mortality increased. The mortality-rate ratio for all-cause death was 1.27 in the southern latitudes, 1.14 in the intermediate latitudes, and 1.20 in the northern latitudes. The mortality rate ratios for the leading causes of death were also higher in the lower and upper latitudes than in the intermediate latitudes. The geographic pattern of the mortality rate ratios is similar to that of the mortality rate in the low-education cohort: the highest magnitude is observed in the southern provinces, intermediate magnitudes in the provinces of the north and those of the Mediterranean east coast, and the lowest magnitude in the central provinces and those in the south of the Western Pyrenees.   Conclusion Mortality inequalities by education in Spain are higher in the south and north of the country and lower in the large region making up the central plateau. This geographic pattern is similar to that observed in mortality in the low-education cohort.",

        "text": "Comparison with other studies and possible explanations\n\nVarious studies in the Spanish population have observed that residents in areas at lower latitude have the highest rate of all-cause mortality [6,18–19]. The authors of these investigations have suggested that the high mortality in these areas is due to their adverse economic context, since the southern provinces are among those with the lowest per capita income [6,18]. In the present investigation, the two study cohorts also have the highest all-cause mortality in the areas with lowest latitude. However, after adjusting for provincial per capita income in 2001, the magnitude of the relation between latitude and mortality in both cohorts hardly changes (data not shown). This probably occurs because some central provinces have a similar per capita income and show low mortality rates.\n\nThe geographic pattern of mortality from all causes in the two cohorts of subjects reflects the geographic pattern observed in mortality from cardiovascular, respiratory and digestive diseases, since these three causes of death are responsible for half of all deaths. A previous study in Spain found a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome in areas of the south [20]. The authors attributed this finding to obesity and physical inactivity given that the geographic pattern of risk factors is similar to the geographic pattern of metabolic syndrome [21–22]. Since chronic diseases share some risk factors, it is possible that the factors mentioned and other health risk factors are responsible for the geographic pattern observed in mortality from these three causes of death [23].\n\nBoth cohorts analysed have the highest cancer mortality in the areas with highest latitude. In Spain higher mortality from various cancer sites has been observed at high latitudes [24]. Similar findings have been seen in studies in France [10] and the United States [25]. There is evidence that ultraviolet radiation and vitamin D reduce the risk of various types of cancer [26]. Since ultraviolet radiation decreases with latitude, some authors have noted that latitude could be an indicator of the dose of ultraviolet radiation and, consequently, of vitamin D production [27].\n\nThe findings of this study also show that the factors responsible for increased mortality in the cohort of subjects with low educational level, with respect to the cohort of subjects with high educational level, are in any latitude in Spain, although the magnitude of the difference in mortality between the two cohorts shows a geographic pattern. Two previous investigations in Italy and the United States have studied the geographic pattern of inequalities in mortality [12–13]. In Italy, the mortality rate ratio by education is higher in regions of the south [12], whereas in the United States the mortality rate ratio does not vary from one region to another [13]. This could be attributed to the fact that in Italy the geographic pattern of mortality varies by education, whereas in the United States it does not. In Spain, the relation between latitude and mortality is linear in the cohort with high education, whereas in the cohort with low education the lowest mortality is observed at intermediate latitudes. As a result, the mortality rate ratio by education is higher in the south and north, and lower in the central region.\n\nWhy is the relation between latitude and mortality U-shaped in the cohort with low education? That is, why does the cohort with low education in the provinces in the large territory making up central Spain–which is economically heterogeneous–have low mortality? The explanation may be the high percentage of the population residing in rural areas in these provinces, since this characteristic is associated with reduced mortality from all the causes of death studied. However, for mortality from cancer and cardiovascular diseases there must be an additional explanation. After including rurality, the regression coefficients of latitude and latitude*latitude were on the margins of statistical significance. In fact, the regression coefficients for all-cause mortality remained significant after including rurality, given that deaths from these two causes represent 50% of all deaths. In any case, the provinces included within each latitude quintile do not exhibit the heterogeneity in rurality observed in the analysis carried out with all provinces and, therefore, the magnitude of the mortality rate ratio in each quintile was not changed when the rurality was included as adjustment variable.\n\nAltitude may be the additional explanation for this lower mortality from cancer and cardiovascular diseases in the central provinces. These provinces are located in a large central massif, known as the “Meseta Central”, which occupies almost half of the country’s surface area. The main characteristic of the Meseta is its mean altitude (between 600 and 700 m), with the highest altitude in the northern sub-plateau [28]. Studies in a number of countries have found that high areas have lower mortality from different cancer sites, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease [29–34]. Likewise, it may be argued that moderate altitudes are more protective than high or even very high altitudes [35]. The immediate question is why residence in high areas could show a protective effect on health in a cohort of subjects with low education, but not in those with high education. The answer must be sought in the low mortality rates in the cohort of subjects with high education throughout the entire country. Given a characteristic of the physical environment, in this case, altitude, which probably reduces the mortality risk with respect to other areas, the margin for reduction is smaller in persons with high education, who have the lowest mortality rates.\n\nFinally, since the level of education is a proxy for socioeconomic status, it can not be ruled out that among the subjects of the cohort with low education, those who live in areas of high altitude present a higher frequency of other socioeconomic characteristics associated with health than those living in other parts of Spain. For example, if areas in high altitude offer healthier occupations or occupations that generate higher incomes this circumstance may help explain the protective effect of altitude on those individuals.\n\nStrengths and limitations\n\nThis study has no problems of representativeness since it included all adults age 25 and over who resided in the Spanish provinces at the time of the 2001 population census. Furthermore, as compared to previous investigations of the geographic pattern of mortality in only three areas–northern, mid and southern Italy, [12]–or in four areas–the Northeast, Midwest, South and West of the United States [13]–the present study has analysed 50 geographic areas. The two aforementioned studies showed a geographic pattern of inequalities only in all-cause mortality, however, the present investigation also estimated the geographic pattern of inequalities in mortality from the leading causes of death.\n\nSubjects in the two study cohorts who resided in the two provinces of the Canary Islands were included in the analysis, although they were assigned the latitude of the southernmost province of the Iberian peninsula. In any case, excluding residents of these two provinces from the analysis did not change the results. Moreover, to simplify the presentation of results, the mortality rates were adjusted for age and sex. We previously ruled out the existence of interaction by sex in both study cohorts in the relation between latitude and the age-adjusted mortality rates.\n\nEducation was used as the indicator of socioeconomic position. Therefore, it is not possible to know what the geographic pattern would be using other socioeconomic indicators like income or social class based on occupation, because income was not collected in the census and occupation was registered only in subjects who were employed in the week before the census. Nonetheless, education has the advantage of allowing classification of all subjects. Furthermore, use of this indicator allowed comparison with the only two studies that have analysed geographic patterns in mortality inequalities.\n\nIn conclusion, inequalities in mortality by education in Spain are highest in the north and south of the country, and lowest in the large central region of Spain that makes up the Meseta. This geographic pattern reflects the mortality pattern observed in the cohort of subjects with low education. Rurality and the greater frequency of socioeconomic characteristics that protect health may explain the low mortality in subjects with low education who live in that area."
