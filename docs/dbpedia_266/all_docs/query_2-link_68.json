        "text": "Although studies have explored the relationship between temperature and CO poisoning, the results are not consistent, and there is still a lack of early warning criteria of temperature related to CO poisoning. In order to comprehensively study the exposure-response relationship between daily average temperature and CO poisoning, and to further explore the early warning criteria of temperature related to CO poisoning, we used daily cases of CO poisoning in 31 National Injury Surveillance System (NISS) surveillance sites in seven administrative geographical regions of China and daily meteorological data obtained from the China Meteorological Science Data Sharing Service Platform from 2009 to 2019 to do the analysis. Daily meteorological data of 698 weather stations across China were interpolated at a 0.01° × 0.01°spatial resolution, which were then applied to extract the daily meteorological data of all included NISS sites. The Distributed Lag Non-linear Model (DLNM) model was applied to estimate the exposure-response associations (relative risk, RR) of daily mean temperature with CO poisoning, which was then further used to identify early warning criteria of temperature related to CO poisoning. A total of 10,618 CO poisoning cases were included in this study, with an average of 0.4 cases per day. There was generally a reverse J-shaped association between temperature and CO poisoning risk, indicating that both low and high temperature may increase the risk of CO poisoning, but low temperature usually has a longer lagged effects than high temperature. Spatialy, the exposure-response associations between temperatue and CO poisoning largely varied among regions, with greater effects of low temperatures in Southern China than in Northern China. The cumulative effects (RR, lag0-6 days) of 10 % percentile temperature ranged from 1.13 (95%CI: 1.01,1.26) in East China to 1.73 (95%CI:1.63,1.83) in South China. We also observed significant spatial variations in the early warning criteria of temperature related to CO poisoning across China. However, the patterns of high temperature effects on CO poisoning and the warning criteria of high temperature were mixed across China. In conclusions, both low temperature and high temperature may increase the risk of CO poisoning in China, and the effect of low temperature is more obvious, especially in South China, Northeast China, and North China. In addition, there is an urgent need to establish air temperature early warning and grading criteria for CO poisoning in different areas of China.\n\nBackground Climate change profoundly shapes the population health at the global scale. However, there was still insufficient and inconsistent evidence for the association between heat exposure and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods In the present study, we studied the association of heat exposure with hospitalizations for cause-specific CKD using a national inpatient database in China during the study period of hot season from 2015 to 2018. Standard time-series regression models and random-effects meta-analysis were developed to estimate the city-specific and national averaged associations at a 7 lag-day span, respectively. Results A total of 768,129 hospitalizations for CKD was recorded during the study period. The results showed that higher temperature was associated with elevated risk of hospitalizations for CKD, especially in sub-tropical cities. With a 1 °C increase in daily mean temperature, the cumulative relative risks ( RR ) over lag 0–7 d were 1.008 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.003–1.012] for nationwide. The attributable fraction of CKD hospitalizations due to high temperatures was 5.50%. Stronger associations were observed among younger patients and those with obstructive nephropathy. Our study also found that exposure to heatwaves was associated with added risk of hospitalizations for CKD compared to non-heatwave days ( RR = 1.116, 95% CI 1.069–1.166) above the effect of daily mean temperature. Conclusions Short-term heat exposure may increase the risk of hospitalization for CKD. Our findings provide insights into the health effects of climate change and suggest the necessity of guided protection strategies against the adverse effects of high temperatures.\n\nBackground Associations between non-optimal temperatures and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk have been previously reported, yet the trends of CVD mortality attributable to non-optimal temperatures remain unclear in China. We analyzed trends in CVD mortality attributable to non-optimal temperatures and associations with age, period, and birth cohort. Methods Data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2019. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to calculate annual percent change (APC) and average annual percent change (AAPC) from 1990 to 2019. We used the age-period-cohort model to analyze age, period, and cohort effects in CVD mortality attributable to non-optimal temperatures between 1990 and 2019. Results The age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) of CVD attributable to non-optimal temperature generally declined in China from 1990 to 2019, whereas ischemic heart disease (IHD) increased slightly. Low temperatures have a greater death burden than high temperatures, but the death burden from high temperatures showed steady increases. Joinpoint regression analysis showed that CVD mortality decreased in all age groups except for IHD, and the decreases were greater in females than in males. The mortality of CVD attributable to non-optimal temperatures of males was higher than females. The mortality rate showed an upwards trend with age across all CVD categories. Period risks were generally found in unfavorable trends. The cohort effects showed a progressive downward trend during the entire period. Conclusion Although there have been reductions in CVD mortality attributable to non-optimum temperatures, the mortality of IHD has increased and the burden from non-optimal temperatures remains high in China. In the context of global climate change, our results call for more attention and strategies to address climate change that protect human health from non-optimal temperatures.\n\nBackground: Meteorological factors and air pollutants are believed to be associated with cardiovascular disease. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a major public health issue worldwide. Few studies have investigated the associations among meteorological factors, air pollutants and IHD daily hospital admissions in Lanzhou, China. Methods: We conducted a distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) on the basis of five years data, aiming at disentangling the impact of meteorological factors and air pollutants on IHD hospital admissions. All IHD daily hospital admissions recorded from January 1, 2015 and December 31, 2019 were obtained from three hospitals in Lanzhou, China. Daily air pollutant concentrations and meteorological data were synchronously collected from Gansu Meteorological Administration and Lanzhou Environmental Protection Administration. Stratified analyses were performed by sex and two age-groups. Results: A total of 23555 IHD hospital admissions were recorded, of which 10477 admissions were for coronary artery disease (CAD), 13078 admissions were for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Our results showed that there was a non-linear (J-shaped) relationship between temperature and IHD hospital admissions. The number of IHD hospital admissions were positively correlated with NO2, O3, humidity and pressure, indicating an increased risk of hospital admissions for IHD under NO2, O3, humidity and pressure exposure. Meanwhile, both extremely low (-12ºC) and high (30ºC) temperature reduced IHD hospital admissions, but the harmful effect increased with the lag time in Lanzhou, China, while the cold effect was more pronounced and long-lasting than the heat effect. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the risk on CAD hospital admissions increased significantly in female and <65 years of age at -12ºC. Conclusion: Our findings added to the growing evidence regarding the potential impact of meteorological factors, air pollutants on policymaking from the perspective of hospital management efficiency.\n\nBackground: Non-optimal temperatures are associated with mortality risk, yet the heterogeneity of temperature-attributable mortality burden across subnational regions in a country was rarely investigated. We estimated the mortality burden related to non-optimal temperatures across all provinces in China in 2019. Methods: The global daily temperature data were obtained from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The daily mortality data and exposure-response curves between daily temperature and mortality for 176 individual causes of death were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 (GBD 2019). We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) based on the exposure-response curves, daily gridded temperature, and population. We calculated the cause- and province-specific mortality burden based on PAF and disease burden data from the GBD 2019. Findings: We estimated that 593·9 (95% UI:498·8, 704·6) thousand deaths were attributable to non-optimal temperatures in China in 2019 (PAF=5·58% [4·93%, 6·28%]), with 580·8 (485·7, 690·1) thousand cold-related deaths and 13·9 (7·7, 23·2) thousand heat-related deaths. The majority of temperature-related deaths were from cardiovascular diseases (399·7 [322·8, 490·4] thousand) and chronic respiratory diseases (177·4 [141·4, 222·3] thousand). The mortality burdens were observed significantly spatial heterogeneity for both high and low temperatures. For instance, the age-standardized death rates (per 100 000) attributable to low temperature were higher in Western China, with the highest in Tibet (113·7 [82·0, 155·5]), while for high temperature, they were greater in Xinjiang (1·8 [0·7, 3·3]) and Central-Southern China such as Hainan (2·5 [0·9, 5·4]). We also observed considerable geographical variation in the temperature-related mortality burden by causes of death at provincial level. Interpretation: A substantial mortality burden was attributable to non-optimal temperatures across China, and cold effects dominated the total mortality burden in all provinces. Both cold- and heat-related mortality burden showed significantly spatial variations across China. Funding: National Key Research and Development Program.\n\nIntroduction: There is currently little knowledge and few published works on the subject of vulnerability to heat in rural environments at the country level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine whether rural areas are more vulnerable to extreme heat than urban areas in Spain. This study aimed to analyze whether a pattern of vulnerability depends on contextual, environmental, demographic, economic and housing variables. Methods: An ecological, longitudinal and retrospective study was carried out based on time series data between 01/01/2000 and 31/12/2013 in 42 geographic areas in 10 provinces in Spain. We first analyzed the functional relationship between the mortality rate per million inhabitants and maximum daily temperature (Tmax). We then determined the summer temperature threshold (Pthreshold) (June-September) at which increases in mortality are produced that are attributable to heat. In a second phase, based on Pthreshold, a vulnerability variable was calculated, and its distribution was analyzed using mixed linear models from the Poisson family (link = log). In these models, the dependent variable was vulnerability, and the independent variables were exposure to high temperatures, aridity of the climate, deprivation index, percentage of people over age 65, rurality index, percentage of housing built prior to 1980 and condition of dwellings. Results: Rurality was a protective factor, and vulnerability in urban areas was six times greater. In contrast, risk factors included aridity (RR = 5.89 (2.26 15.36)), living in cool summer zones (2.69 (1.23, 5.91)), poverty (4.05 (1.91 8.59)) and the percentage of dysfunctional housing (1.13 (1.04 1.24)). Conclusions: Rural areas are less vulnerable to extreme heat than the urban areas analyzed. Also, population groups with worse working conditions and higher percentages of dwellings in poor conditions are more vulnerable.\n\nBackground Several studies have investigated the associations between temperature variability (TV) and death counts. However, evidence of TV-attributable years of life lost (YLL) is scarce. Objectives To investigate the associations between TV and YLL rates (/100,000 population), and quantify average life loss per death (LLD) caused by TV in China. Methods We calculated daily YLL rates (/100,000 population) of non-accidental causes and cardiorespiratory diseases by using death data from 364 counties of China during 2006–2017, and collected meteorological data during the same period. A distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) and multivariate meta-analysis were used to estimate the effects of TV at national or regional levels. Then, we calculated the LLD to quantify the mortality burden of TV. Results U-shaped curves were observed in the associations of YLL rates with TV in China. The minimum YLL TV (MYTV) was 2.5 °C nationwide. An average of 0.89 LLD was attributable to TV in total, most of which was from high TV (0.86, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.16). However, TV caused more LLD in the young (<65 years old) (1.87, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.71) than 65–74 years old (0.85, 95% CI: 0.40–1.31) and ≥75 years old (0.40, 95% CI: 0.21–0.59), cerebrovascular disease (0.74, 95% CI: 0.36, 1.11) than respiratory disease (0.54, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.87), South (1.23, 95% CI: 0.77, 1.68) than North (0.41, 95% CI: −0.7, 1.52) and Central China (0.40, 95% CI: −0.02, 0.81). TV-attributed LLD was modified by annual mean temperature, annual mean relative humidity, altitude, latitude, longitude, and education attainment. Significance Our findings indicate that high and low TVs are both associated with increases in premature death, however the majority of LLD was attributable to high TV. TV-related LLD was modified by county level characteristics. TV should be considered in planning adaptation to climate change or variability. Impact We estimated the associations of TV with YLL rates, and quantified the life loss per death (LLD) caused by TV. An average of 0.89 years of LLD were attributable to TV, most of which were from high TVs. TV caused more LLD in the young, cerebrovascular disease, and southern China. The mortality burdens were modified by county level characteristics.\n\nAge-specific discrepancy of mortality burden attributed to temperature, measured as years of life lost (YLL), has been rarely investigated. We investigated age-specific temperature-YLL rates (per 100,000) relationships and quantified YLL per death caused by non-optimal temperature in China. We collected daily meteorological data, population data and daily death counts from 364 locations in China during 2006–2017. YLL was divided into three age groups (0–64 years, 65–74 years, and ≥75 years). A distributed lag non-linear model was first employed to estimate the associations of temperature with age-specific YLL rates in each location. Then we pooled the associations using a multivariate meta-analysis. Finally, we calculated age-specific average YLL per death caused by temperature by cause of death and region. We observed greater effects of cold and hot temperature on YLL rates for the elderly compared with the young population by region or cause of death. However, YLL per death due to non-optimal temperature for different regions or causes of death decreased with age, with 2.0 (95 % CI:1.5, 2.5), 1.2 (1.1, 1.4) and 1.0 years (0.9, 1.2) life loss per death for populations aged 0–64 years, 65–74 years and over 75 years, respectively. Most life loss per death results from moderate temperature, especially moderate cold for all age groups. The effect of non-optimal temperature on YLL rates is smaller for younger populations than older ones, while the temperature-related life loss per death was more prominent for younger populations."
