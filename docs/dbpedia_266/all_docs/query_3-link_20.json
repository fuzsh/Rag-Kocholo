        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nClimate change represents a significant threat to global biodiversity and natural ecosystem integrity. In the last century, the global average temperatures have risen by 0.7 °C and are predicted to continue rising (IPCC 2013). Future warming in the Mediterranean basin is expected to exceed global rates by 25%, notably with summer warming at a pace 40% higher than the global mean. A global atmospheric temperature increase will probably be accompanied by a reduction in summer precipitation [1]. Climate change will cause potential directional impact on species distribution. Gradual changes that allow ecosystems to slowly adapt. In the IPPC chapter as ecosystems that are adaptive because they are able to change their composition or function in response to changing environmental conditions [2].\n\nMany environmental and biological questions have arisen as a result of this impending transformation. Here, we focus on those related to biodiversity. Losing and moving biological diversity has numerous effects on both natural and social systems, and casts new doubts about conservation planning and policies [3,4,5] as well as the economic and social impact that the loss of some important ecosystem services will have [6,7]. It has been shown in the past that the loss of biodiversity is mainly due to three important factors (and their interaction): (1) changes in land use (fragmentation), (2) the introduction of invasive alien species and (3) global warming [8,9,10,11]. The relationships between these three causes cannot be stated with any certainty because they are highly complex and also because of the well-known fact that relationship does not mean causality [12].\n\nLand-use change is a complex process and, once analysed, can be the input to assess interlinked processes such as climatic variability, land degradation, ecosystem stability, and biodiversity [13]. Human population growth and resource use, mediated by changes in climate, land use, and water use, increasingly impact biodiversity [14,15].\n\nNevertheless, an interesting fact has been observed, one that is closely related to the abovementioned factors and to the definition that the IPPC gives to “ecological adaptation”. As was widely reported and reviewed in the last IPCC [2] many plant and animal species have shifted their ranges and altered their abundance and seasonal activities in response to the observed climate change that has taken place over the last decades [14,16,17]. When this information is compared to the pale ecological records, the predictions result in large-scale biome shifts and changes in community composition. Although there is strong evidence to believe these changes are occurring, and will keep on doing so, the magnitude of the actual changes is still to be determined and is likely to be very different across geographical areas and ecoregions. However, the differences for every individual species are also considerable, thus leading to the idea that the range shift for each species depends on multiple internal and external traits [18]. Climate change is the main issue on the environmental politics agenda and while it is expected to become a significant driving force behind biodiversity change in the 21st century, it is land use that is projected to remain the foremost impetus of change [19]. Despite climate change and change in land use being key to changes in biodiversity [19,20,21,22,23], the interaction between these two forces is complex and currently not well understood [22,23,24].\n\nIt is assumed that Europe will be highly affected by the range shifts and there is the worrying likelihood of the extinction of species [9,25,26]. Some suggest that within Europe, the Mediterranean climate and the grassland ecosystems will experience the greatest proportional change in biodiversity [15,19,27]. Mediterranean-type ecosystems are characterized by cold winters and hot dry summers. Predictions for the area say that a large number of mammals will be endangered and, for Spain and North Africa, the changes are expected to be in terms of loss of species, especially in the protected areas [28]. Not only that, but meta-analyses carried out in 2010 by Gonzalez et al. [29] predict that temperate mixed and boreal conifer forests will experience the greatest vulnerability, and vegetation shift projections suggest potential latitudinal biome shifts of up to 400 km. The effect that temperature and changes in land use has on these correlations has been studied on a local scale.\n\nBiodiversity locations can be associated to their spatial coordinates, the temporal instant, and the corresponding covariates. This association facilitates the representation of a biodiversity as a realization of a spatio-temporal stochastic process. Spatio-temporal clustering of biodiversity might indicate the presence of risk factors which are not evenly distributed in space and time. In fact, what is usually of interest is to assess the association of clustering of biodiversity to spatial and seasonal covariates [30].\n\nIn this study, we aimed to test whether good predictions about the range shifts can be made on a local scale, and to test whether the results of our predictions follow the trends of the global ones. We identify areas most susceptible to future biodiversity loss. There are many reasons for doing a region-specific study, but the most important would be the fact that, among biomes, there are large differences as to what the causes of the biodiversity changes are [19], and also because many terrestrial species have small geographic ranges and cannot be accounted for in larger scale analyses [9]. Furthermore, while management policies in Spain undoubtedly depend on the European framework [31], region-specific studies can help local policy makers make decisions based on objective facts, and provide them with species-specific information that potentially provides enormous help to better manage protected areas, as well as a useful mechanism to quickly identify areas of biological and conservation interest. This is currently used to select and design protected areas. Changes in temperature can carry changes in biodiversity by creating opportunities for previously innocuous alien species by enhancing their reproductive capacity, their survival and their competitive power against the native flora and fauna\n\nIn our study, we focused on the region of Catalonia (NE Spain). Catalonia is an area rich in a variety of landscapes and environmental conditions that favour a great diversity in vegetation [32]. Also, the area is suitable for bio-geographical approaches thanks to the large amount of reliable species distribution data that is readily available. The novelty of our study is that we use an original statistical method in which we include both the explanatory variables observed and confounders not observed and in which we perform a spatial adjustment, with the objective to evaluate which factors were associated with the biodiversity changes over time and to evaluate the spatial variation of these changes in Catalonia from 2007 to 2011.\n\n3. Results\n\nWe have estimated a slight increase in daily maximum temperature (0.773%, annualized on average) and a more significant increase in minimum temperature (2.960%, annualized on average) (see ). These values correspond to a 5-year increase of 0.159 °C (95% credible interval 0.080 °C, 0.242 °C) in maximum temperature, and an increase of 0.332 C (95% credible interval 0.008 °C, 0.635 °C) in minimum temperature. There was an increase in the spatial variability of daily air temperature (estimated standard deviation equals 7.679 °C, maximum temperature, and 8.742 °C, minimum temperature, in 2008), denoting the existence of space–time interactions. In fact, a geographical pattern could be observed in the variations of daily temperature. It seems that the variation of the temperature depended on the latitude, with a maximum in the latitude corresponding to 4.619.000 coord Y (ETRS89 31N).\n\nFurthermore, in our case, the estimated temperature variation was not homogeneous amongst months: This variation has been positive from April to September in maximum temperature and has been positive from May to October in minimum temperature.\n\nThe results of the estimation show that the total number of species was greater than expected (relative risk greater than unity) in those cells with some slope (particularly greater than the first quintile, between 0% and 0.37% slope) and with land use other than urban (the predominant category in “others”, that included urban, beaches, sand, bare rocks, burnt areas, and water bodies) ( in Appendix A). It should be noted that when the slope of the cell was greater than 7.4%, the total number of species in the cell was estimated between 11.8% (95% credibility interval—equivalent to confidence interval—95% CrI 0.04%–24.5%) and 12.9% (95% CrI 0.01%–27.6%) higher than expected. On the other hand, in the cells whose land use was not urban, the total number of species was between 38.4%, in forests, and 55.2%, in mixed forests, higher than expected. However, in all cases the statistical significance was only marginal (the 90% credibility intervals did not contain the unity) and the credibility intervals overlap and therefore were not found statistically different ( in Appendix A).\n\nIn contrast, in those cells closest to inhabited areas and with an orientation of the slope (i.e., aspect) of the fourth quartile, the total number of species was estimated to be lower than expected (i.e., relative risk less than unity; in Appendix A). In this sense, when the distance to inhabited areas was less than 180 metres (second quintile) the total number of species was 4.2% fewer than when the distance was between 180 and 1664 m; and 9.5% when the distance was greater than 1664 m (fifth quintile). In addition, when the aspect of the cell was greater than 257.9 m (fourth quartile), the number of species was 6.4% less.\n\nWe can observe that most invasive species are found in areas where the minimum temperature is expected to increase ( ).\n\nMany studies have shown that different species are colonizing new territories due to the increase in temperature. These species look for higher latitudes where they can find their optimal conditions. This study shows that the latitudinal range where the temperature changes are greatest has been calculated locally. On the other hand, we have verified that protected areas where biodiversity accumulates are becoming areas of biodiversity loss at the expense of other areas that are increasing biodiversity because the species seek their optimum at higher latitudes.\n\nProtected areas are crucial for conserving the remaining biodiversity. We estimated the composition of several well-studied taxonomic groups (amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals), and although it is observed that even most protected areas will concentrate the greatest biodiversity, we must consider that new spaces will be colonized by new species and that we will find hotspots outside protected areas ( )."
