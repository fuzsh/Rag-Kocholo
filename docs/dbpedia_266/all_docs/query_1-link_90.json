        "text": "The motion of Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) is frequently disturbed by the ocean wind, wave and current. A poorly designed controller will lead to failures and even safety problems during actual navigation. In order to obtain satisfied control performance of the motion for the USVs, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based on improved Nonlinear Disturbance Observer (NDO) is proposed. Firstly, the USV model is approximately linearized and MPC is designed for the multivariable system with constraints. In order to compensate the influence of disturbances, an improved NDO is designed, with which the calculation time for the MPC saved a lot. Finally, comparison experiments are conducted between the MPC with NDO and the MPC with improved NDO, and the results show that they have similar performance to the USVs. However, the proposed method has less parameter to be tuned and it is much more time-saving compared to the MPC with traditional NDO.\n\nThe motion of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is frequently disturbed by ocean wind, waves, and currents. A poorly designed controller will cause failures and safety problems during actual navigation. To obtain a satisfactory motion control performance for the USVs, a model predictive control (MPC) method based on an improved Nonlinear Disturbance Observer (NDO) is proposed. First, the USV model is approximately linearized and MPC is designed for the multivariable system with constraints. To compensate for the influence of disturbances, an improved NDO is designed where the calculation time for MPC is reduced. Finally, comparison simulations are conducted between MPC with the original NDO and MPC with an improved NDO, and the results show that they have similar performances to the USVs. However, the proposed method has fewer parameters that need to be tuned and is much more time-saving compared to MPC with a traditional NDO.\n\nFor mission planning and replanning of multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), it is important to estimate each USV’s mission performance in terms of sea surveillance (e.g., illegal ship control). In this study, a mission performance index (MPI) is proposed based on the mission coverage area for estimating the USVs’ mission performance of illegal ship control. The penalty value is considered in the MPI calculation procedure owing to the track-off of the USV. In addition, the USV simulation is conducted under illegal ship control, and the MPI is calculated based on changing the mission coverage area. The results show that the MPI increases with the path width of the mission coverage area."
