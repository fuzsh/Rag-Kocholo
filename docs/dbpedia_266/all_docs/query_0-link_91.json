In case you missed it, you can read our National Signing Day Primer for our beloved Fighting Irish right HERE.\n\nIn recent years, things ain’t what they used to be for Signing Day drama both around South Bend and nationally. However, this year we could see some fireworks…hopefully they stay far far away from Notre Dame’s orbit, though.\n\nThe Memorial Fax Machine Watch Party\n\nI believe the football office no longer relies on fax machines to have National Letters of Intent signed and delivered. You can scroll through the list of Notre Dame 2024 commits in this list provided by 247 and check the players off as the officially sign.\n\nAs usual, the signing period is a heavily eastern time zone affair with a smattering of athletes ready to sign in the other time zones. Here is the full breakdown for the earliest each Irish recruit can sign on Wednesday according to eastern times:\n\nEastern (7 AM)\n\nCJ Carr\n\nBryce Young\n\nGuerby Lambert\n\nTae Johnson\n\nLoghan Thomas\n\nMicah Gilbert\n\nAnyeas Williams\n\nSean Sevillano\n\nJack Larsen\n\nPeter Jones\n\nStyles Prescod\n\nKarson Hobbs\n\nTaebron Bennie-Powell\n\nBodie Kahoun\n\nAnthonie Knapp\n\nCole Mullins\n\nCentral (8 AM)\n\nCam Williams\n\nKedren Young\n\nLeonard Moore\n\nTeddy Rezac\n\nMountain (9 AM)\n\nKennedy Urlacher\n\nPacific (10 AM)\n\nKyngstonn Villiamu-Asa\n\nLogan Saldate\n\nThe Race for the #1 Class\n\nHere’s a look at the top team recruiting classes according to the 3 big sites:\n\n247 Composite Rankings\n\nOn3 Industry Rankings\n\nRivals Team Rankings\n\nGeorgia has summited the top of the recruiting rankings once before in the Kirby Smart era. Can they hold on for 2024 once again?\n\nHigh Profile Flip Candidates\n\nJeremiah Smith\n\nWR\n\n0.9994\n\nChaminade-Madonna Prep\n\nOpa Locka, FL\n\nThe nation’s top wide receiver and overall no. 1 player in the 247 Composite has been committed to Ohio State for just over a year. While he’s visited Columbus numerous times he’s also been an active visitor of other schools, too. More specifically, the in-state powers of Florida, Florida State, and Miami have all received visits and are actively trying to flip a shaky Smith verbal to the Buckeyes.\n\nDylan Raiola\n\nQB\n\n0.9965\n\nBuford\n\nBuford, GA\n\n*********EDIT: Pre-writing strikes again, Raiola flipped to Nebraska on Monday evening this week.\n\nLet the recruiting drama of the top quarterback in 2024 according to Rivals and 247 (On3 has Raiola ranked 4th behind Alabama commit Julian Sayin, Florida commit DJ Lagway, and Florida State commit Luke Kromenhoek) fill your blackened heart with joy. In case you’ve missed how we got here, this is the full breakdown for Dylan Railoa in recent years:\n\nAs a freshman and sophomore, Railoa played for former NFL quarterback John Kitna at Burelson High School outside of Forth Worth, Texas. As a junior, he transferred to Chandler High School in the Phoenix suburbs. In the late spring of 2022, Raiola committed to Ohio State then left the Buckeyes’ class shortly before Christmas that year. At the start of 2023, he decided to transfer to Pinnacle High School 35 miles to the south but was facing a 5-game ban from the Arizona Interscholastic Association. In May of 2023, Raiola committed to Georgia and then a month later announced he’d be transferring high schools to powerhouse Buford outside of Atlanta.\n\nRaiola’s red flags have little red flags inside of them.\n\nBuford lost in the 3rd round of the playoffs after being held to 114 yards of total offense and in the weeks since the drama has been ratcheted up. Dylan’s father Dominic (a former Rimington winner and veteran NFL center) attended Nebraska and the family took an official visit to Lincoln last week (their 3rd visit this year) with plenty of smoke that he’ll be flipping to the Cornhuskers.\n\nAmaris Williams\n\nDL\n\n0.9595\n\nClinton High School\n\nClinton, NC\n\nThe top player in the state of North Carolina, Williams has been committed to Florida since the summer. He cancelled his visit to Georgia recently which should make the Gators’ fans happy. However, he took an official visit to Ohio State back in October and is coming off an official visit to Auburn just a couple weeks ago.\n\nWilliams welcomed in-home visits from Florida and Auburn coaches this past weekend with most expecting a flip the Tigers.\n\nLJ McCray\n\nDL\n\n0.9838\n\nMainland High School\n\nDaytona Beach, FL\n\nCould Florida lose a pair of blue-chip defensive linemen as Signing Day approaches? McCray hasn’t been committed to the Gators for very long (he gave a verbal back on October 21st)\n\nIn addition to Florida, McCray has taken official visits to Miami, Auburn, Georgia, and Florida State. He’s also unofficially visited all of these schools right through the fall and winter. He’s affirmed his commitment to Florida after his last round of visits to they should hold on. But if not, it could be Florida State or Auburn.\n\nZavier Filsaime\n\nS\n\n0.9856\n\nMcKinney High School\n\nMcKinney, TX\n\nPotentially more bad news for Florida (losing your final 5 games isn’t great on the recruiting trail) as Filsaime was offered by Texas in October and has taken a pair of visits to Austin in recent weeks. A flip here seems extremely likely.\n\n*********EDIT: He also flipped to Texas on Tuesday.\n\nEddrick Houston\n\nDL\n\n0.9880\n\nBuford\n\nBuford, GA\n\nThe teammate of Dylan Raiola and fellow 5-star appears to be looking around at the last minute, too. Houston picked Ohio State back in August in a close race over Alabama and Clemson. However, he’s taken recent visits to Tuscaloosa and Clemson leading up to signing day. Is he actually a flip candidate or looking for a better compensation package from Ohio State?"
