        "text": "We asked the Forty Under 40 ... Who has most influenced your professional development?\n\nAmy Azzi\n\nI had an early mentor at UC Berkeley who just cared so much: Joe Watz, UC Berkeley director of business development, Division of Student Affairs.\n\nMichael Bucklin\n\nI’m fortunate enough to have a Hall of Fame basketball coach — Tom Izzo — as an uncle. He preaches easy-to-remember lines that I find myself using every day. “Players play — tough players win.” “Don’t ask anyone to do anything you wouldn’t do yourself.” “Listen to learn, learn to listen.” “A player-coached team is better than a coach-coached team.” These have served as sound GPS turn-by-turn directions as I’ve looked to navigate my career.\n\nPatrick Burke\n\nBill Daly, deputy commissioner of the NHL.\n\nKatie Bynum Aznavorian\n\nMy husband [Dave Aznavorian], for his unwavering belief in me and encouraging me to be myself.\n\nMaggy Carlyle\n\nAnn Moore (Sports Illustrated, Time Inc.) has been an incredible mentor and friend who continues to push an entire cast of mentees to lead growth and innovation in historically male-dominated industries. Woodie Dixon (Pac-12, Chegg) paved the way for my most formative work opportunities, affording his teams with an incredible amount of autonomy, latitude and support to contribute to the organization and grow as people.\n\nJim Cavale\n\nMy partner, Zach Maurides, from Teamworks. My admiration for his knowledge of sports and SaaS was a big reason I chose to go with the deal we ended up doing between Teamworks and INFLCR.\n\nDaniel Cohen\n\nJason Cohen, my brother and general counsel of the Dallas Cowboys. In a short time, Jason has risen to become one of the most influential attorneys within our industry. A lot of Jason’s success can be attributed to his calming, creative, and solutions-oriented approach. I am witness to Jason’s ability to quickly build trust up and down the org chart within every organization he has been a part of. Jason has been a guiding voice in reminding me to appreciate every opportunity, put in more than you take, and invest in the professional and personal relationships that are so critical to happiness and success.\n\nAlexa Cook\n\nPaul Danforth. Paul trusts, supports, nudges, and persuades unlike anyone I’ve ever known. He has pushed me out of my comfort zone every day that I’ve worked for him and, although it makes my palms sweat and in the moment I hate it, I know that I’d be nowhere without that kind of mentorship.\n\nKaitee Daley\n\nWay too hard to name one person so I’ll share a few that come to mind … Anthony Mormile and Michael Cupo for believing in me and the future of mobile sports content consumption; Rob King for his compassionate and thoughtful leadership; Nate Ravitz for his business savvy and tenacity; Ryan Spoon for his innovative mind and trust in me; Tina Thornton for her mentorship.\n\nMatt Davis\n\nNick Kelly taught about maintaining relationships while still challenging the status quo.\n\nJuan De Jesus\n\nI like to make the comparison to development of an athlete: Wendy Lewis “scouted” me. Dan Halem has been that key mentor. Rob Manfred and Sandy Alderson “called me up to the big leagues.” Roham Gharegozlou and Dan Reed have continued to push and stretch me.\n\nStirling Eads\n\nCasey Close believed in me when I was looking to pivot from sports media and always has encouraged me to pursue opportunities that expand my knowledge base and give me new challenges.\n\nDrew Fleming\n\nCraig Fravel (CEO of racing operations for The Stronach Group) gave me the Harvard education of horse racing early in my career. Would also mention my close friend Gatewood Bell (Keeneland vice president of racing), who introduced me to horse racing at a young age, which changed my life forever.\n\nBoris Gartner\n\nI’ve been very fortunate to work for and alongside some of the most accomplished executives and owners across media, entertainment and sports, and count many of them as mentors. They’ve all contributed to who I am and have taught me the the importance of persistence and having a relentless focus on execution.\n\nCatie Griggs\n\nI’m fortunate enough to have had a wide array of mentors across the industry throughout my career and wouldn’t be here without them.\n\nTiffini Grimes\n\nGreg Byrne, Charmelle Green, and the late Eugene Parker. Each have illustrated unwavering integrity, grace and place their clients/student athletes first.\n\nRichard Haddad\n\nArn Tellem: I continue to admire and learn from his passion, creativity, and empathy — as a leader, negotiator and dealmaker.\n\nGina Hagedorn\n\nDan Mannix — mentor, coach, teacher, therapist.\n\nKathryn Hodel\n\nJessica Gelman, first as my mentor through the Harvard-Radcliffe mentorship program when I was an undergrad, and later as my boss at Kraft Sports + Entertainment and now KAGR CEO. Jessica consistently advocates for and champions women in sports, and I’ve personally grown from her coaching and belief.\n\nMoon Javaid\n\nAl Guido. I have worked for Al for the last nine years. I have grown both personally and professionally with Al. Al has pushed me to grow, to manage, to lead, to innovate. I know Al will always have my back, which allows me to take risks and push the envelope — things I love doing.\n\nTucker Kain\n\nMy dad [Bob Kain].\n\nBrian Kantarian\n\nMy father [Arlen Kantarian]. He’s been my biggest supporter throughout my career and has offered me sound advice every step of the way.\n\nAllison Katz-Mayfield\n\nMy boss, Brian Lafemina. He and I are so different, but we complement each other’s skills — he pushes me outside my comfort zone and forces me to be tougher. And his commitment to nurturing and growing his people is unmatched.\n\nCarter Ladd\n\nGary Stevenson. He underlined the value of investing in talented individuals by providing dynamic opportunities to learn new skill sets. Gary has imparted upon me the importance of humanizing difficult circumstances, while simultaneously demanding maximum effort and attention to detail in every facet of your daily work routine.\n\nFara Leff\n\nPeter Feigin. He’s known me since I was 19 years old and has always been my first call for advice. He’s been an incredible mentor from the start of my career through the present.\n\nZachary Leonsis\n\nTed Leonsis, for obvious reasons. He’s an amazing role model and a principled leader who never tires. He demands I give 110% every time.\n\nGraham Neff\n\nDan Radakovich. Wouldn’t be where I’m at without learning work ethic and decision-making processing from him!\n\nJeff Nelson\n\nNavigate founder AJ Maestas entrusted me with running the business.\n\nColin Neville\n\nThe founding partners at Raine who encouraged me to make an impact early in my career.\n\nMike Raffensperger\n\nMatt King. I remain really impressed with Matt’s ability to lead an organization. To be a thought partner in decision making. He certainly made me a better manager, leader and marketeer and I always appreciated his partnership.\n\nJay Riola\n\nTwo people have been influential mentors throughout my career: My current boss, Charlie Freeman (Orlando Magic president of business operations) for his relentless work ethic and strong relationship-building. And, my previous boss, Anthony Perez (current executive vice president at Shift4 and previous CEO of VenueNext and CMO of the Orlando Magic) for his strategic vision and creative/innovative thinking skills.\n\nWhalen Rozelle\n\nBrandon Beck. He’s been an inspirational leader early on in my time at Riot. He taught me important lessons like optimistic leadership and playing to win — don’t spend as much time planning around failure but more time planning around the upside case. He led Riot with a grace and patience that I’ve tried to emulate in my own leadership style.\n\nLyndsay Signor\n\nJenny Storms. Over the last six years she’s not only been an advocate for my growth and career but has pushed me to think differently and never be satisfied with the status quo. She’s supports me both personally and professionally. She trusts my ability to lead marketing of some of the world’s largest sports events and that alone boosts my confidence on a daily basis.\n\nKelvin Smith\n\nBob Bowlsby gave me an opportunity to learn on the job and instilled in me the confidence necessary to develop.\n\nChrista Stout\n\nIlitch Sports CEO Chris McGowan. He brought me on at the Blazers and gave me just tons of opportunities. He had a huge impact on me as a leader and in my professional development.\n\nMorgan Sword\n\nDan Halem.\n\nBrandon Thompson\n\nSteve O’Donnell. He ultimately hired me into my first full-time job at NASCAR, and was some version of my boss for the first 10-plus years at NASCAR.\n\nLindsay Ulrey\n\nDeborah Curtis. Deb hired me as a senior manager at American Express in 2014 and mentored me professionally and personally throughout our shared time at the company together. I had never even worked on a sports partnership before, but when a director role on the team became available, with the opportunity to lead our U.S. Open golf and U.S. Open tennis partnerships, Deb had the confidence in me to take on the role."
