        "text": "Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a widely used method in geophysical prospecting. In practical applications, the smoothness-constrained least squares method is usually used to invert the apparent data of ERT. Although the resistivity distribution in the detection area can be obtained according to the inversion result, it is difficult to resolve the specific boundary of anomalies directly, which will affect the accuracy of the interpretation results of the detection data. This paper proposes a high-resolution imaging and interpretation method for ERT based on reflection coefficient analysis. This method can amplify the data features at the boundary of anomalies by performing the secondary processing and analysis on inversion results, thereby identifying the specific boundary of anomalies. This research improves the accuracy of interpretation results and realizes high-resolution imaging. Compared with the multi-scale inversion and other methods that enhance the resolution by optimizing the inversion algorithm, this method can more intuitively determine the specific boundary of anomalies in the inversion cross-section.\n\nHydrofracturing, used for shale gas exploitation, may induce felt, even damaging earthquakes. On 15 June 2019, an Mw2.8 earthquake occurred, spatially correlated with the location of earlier exploratory hydrofracturing operations for shale gas in Wysin in Poland. However, this earthquake was atypical. Hydrofracturing-triggered seismicity mainly occurs during stimulation; occasionally, it continues a few months after completion of the stimulation. In Wysin, there were only two weaker events during two-month hydrofracturing and then 35 months of seismic silence until the mentioned earthquake occurred. The Wysin site is in Gdańsk Pomerania broader region, located on the very weakly seismically active Precambrian Platform. The historical documents, covering 1000 years, report no natural earthquakes in Gdańsk Pomerania. We conclude, therefore, that despite the never observed before that long lag time after stimulation, the Mw2.8 earthquake was triggered by hydrofracturing. It is possible that its unusually late occurrence in relation to the time of its triggering technological activity was caused by changes in stresses due to time-dependent deformation of reservoir shales. The Wysin earthquake determines a new time horizon for the effect of HF on the stress state, which can lead to triggering earthquakes. Time-dependent deformation and its induced stress changes should be considered in shall gas reservoir exploitation plans.\n\nIn Poland, the Eastern European Craton (EEC) crust of Fennoscandian and Sarmatian affinity is concealed under a thick Phanerozoic platform cover. The exact character of the Paleoproterozoic suture between these two major crustal components still remains speculative. Most of the inferences regarding the architecture of the EEC crust rely on the results of the wide-angle reflection and refraction (WARR) soundings, which show a relatively simple structure with a typical three-layer cratonic crust. ION Geophysical PolandSPAN™ regional seismic programme data, acquired over the marginal part of the EEC in Poland, offered a unique opportunity to derive a detailed image of the deeper crust. The main scope of the thesis is to apply extended correlation processing to the PolandSPAN™ regional profiles in order to extend the nominal record length of the acquired data from 12 to 22 s (from ca. 30 to ca. 60 km of depth). To facilitate the processing scheme and the interpretation of the derived results, the machine learning tools are also adapted here to be used with seismic data.\n\nAmong blue carbon ecosystems, seagrass meadows have been highlighted for their contribution to the ocean carbon cycle and climate change mitigation derived from their capacity to store large amounts of carbon over long periods of time in their sediments. Most of the available estimates of carbon stocks beneath seagrass meadows are based on the analysis of short sediment cores in very limited numbers. In this study, high-resolution seismic reflection techniques were applied to obtain an accurate estimate of the potential size of the organic deposit underlying the meadows of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica (known as ‘matte’). Seismic profiles were collected over 1380 km of the eastern continental shelf of Corsica (France, Mediterranean Sea) to perform a large-scale inventory of the carbon stock stored in sediments. The seismic data were ground-truthed by sampling sediment cores and using calibrated seismo-acoustic surveys. The data interpolation map highlighted a strong spatial heterogeneity of the matte thickness. The height of the matte at the site was estimated at 251.9 cm, being maximum in shallow waters (10-20 m depth), near river mouths and lagoon outlets, where the thickness reached up to 867 cm. Radiocarbon dates revealed the presence of seagrass meadows since the mid-Holocene (7000-9000 cal. yr BP). Through the top meter of soil, the matte age was estimated at 1656 ± 528 cal. yr BP. The accretion rate showed a high variability resulting from the interplay of multiple factors. Based on the surface area occupied by the meadows, the average matte thickness underneath them and the carbon content, the matte volume and total Corg stock were estimated at 403.5 ± 49.4 million m³ and 15.6 ± 2.2 million t Corg, respectively. These results confirm the need for the application of large-scale methods to estimate the size of the carbon sink associated with seagrass meadows worldwide.\n\nResults of a depth-to-basement study are presented for the westernmost Polish Outer Carpathians. The gravity data are inverted for the top of the Precambrian basement using horizons from 2-D gravity and magnetic forward models and well tops as input depth measurements. 2-D models, used in the study, are built upon depth converted seismic profiles. The results are visualized as an isobath map for the top of the Precambrian basement, complemented with the qualitative structural interpretation of gravity and magnetic anomaly maps. The outcome of 3-D joint inversion of the gravity data and depth measurements shows the Precambrian crystalline basement deepening southward from c. 1 to almost 7 km b. s. l. Consequently, an approximately 2 km thick wedge of autochthonous sediments, thickening southward, is embraced between the crystalline basement and a sole detachment of the Carpathian fold-and-thrust belt, imaged by seismic data. Since the modelled top of the crystalline basement is roughly parallel to the Moho, suggesting no extension-related thinning in Mesozoic, the autochthonous sediments are likely of pre-Permian age. A positive magnetic anomaly in the south of the study area is presumably associated with the presence of an elongated body of intermediate to mafic rocks in the basement of the Brunovistulian Terrane. These rocks may represent a relic of a Cadomian magmatic arc comparable to that existing in the Brno Massif of southern Moravia. built upon seismic reflection lines. The results are additionally constrained by qualitative structural interpretation of gravity and magnetic anomaly maps. The results reveal basement control on a structural style and wedge geometry of the Carpathian thinskinned fold-and-thrust belt.\n\nThe Paleoproterozoic suture between Sarmatia and Fennoscandia (SFS), two major components of the East European Craton, extends SW-ward from Russia through Belarus to SE Poland. The exact character of this suture remains speculative, despite the results of the wide-angle reflection and refraction (WARR) soundings. Here, we show results of newly reprocessed deep reflection seismic data of the PolandSPAN™ survey, portraying the whole crust and uppermost mantle in SE Poland. Their interpretation is supported by the unsupervised clustering of seismic reflectivity patterns. From the integration of PolandSPAN™ data with both magnetic and WARR data, we conclude that the SFS cannot be interpreted as a localised lithospheric discontinuity coincident with the Minsk Fault. Instead, we observe a so-called diffuse cryptic suture zone, c. 150 km wide, where materials from two colliding plates are mixed over large distances to form a unified continental crust. The suture-related reflections are interpreted as a thrust-wedge rooted at the lower-middle crust interface underneath the Ivanowo-Borisov zone. We support Bogdanova et al. (2015) view that the Okołowo-Holeszów Belt 2 and Belarus-Podlasie Granulite Belt have affinities to the NW margin of Sarmatia. We interpret both units as belonging to the diffuse SFS.\n\nThe Paleoproterozoic suture between Sarmatia and Fennoscandia (SFS), two major components of the East European Craton, extends SW-ward from Russia through Belarus to SE Poland.

The purpose of this work is to explore the predictive capacity of three artificial neu-ral network (ANN) models in predicting geodetic point velocities. First, the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) model was developed with two hidden layers. The generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model was then applied for the first time. Afterwards, the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) model was trained and tested with the same data. Latitude () and longitude (λ) were utilized as inputs and the geodetic point velocities (V X ,V Y ,V Z) as outputs to the MLPNN, GRNN, and RBFNN models. The performances of all ANN models were evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R 2). The first investigation demonstrated that it was possible to predict the geodetic point velocities by using all the components as output parameters simultaneously. The other result is that all ANN models were able to predict the geodetic point velocity with satisfactory accuracy; however, the GRNN model provided better accuracy than the MLPNN and RBFNN models. For example, the RMSE and MAE values were 1.77-1.88 mm and 1.44-1.51 mm, respectively, for the GRNN model.\n\nThe large portion of Central and NW Europe was subjected to widespread continental rifting since the Carboniferous-Permian transition. This process led to nucleation of several large depocentres, coalescing from the late Permian onwards into the extensive Central European Basin System (CEBS), that grew and evolved until the regional-scale Late Cretaceous inversion. Development of deep grabens from Germany to the Netherlands and the North Sea was connected with volcanism and crustal thinning. The exception makes the Mid-Polish Trough (MPT), trending NW-SE across Poland along the Teisseyre-Tornquist Zone (TTZ) at the margin of the East European Craton (EEC). The MPT is underlain by relatively thick lithosphere and its formation was not associated with volcanic activity in the direct neighbourhood. To investigate this anomaly, we compiled grids for key horizons defining the crustal architecture, separately for NW European and Polish sectors of the CEBS. Seismic reflection and well data were used to build the base Permian grid, whereas deep seismic refraction and reflection data along with constrained gravity inversion were employed to construct the top basement and Moho grids. Based on a dense net of seismic refraction profiles, the additional top Ediacaran grid was created solely for the Polish part of the CEBS. Our data show distinct crystalline crust thinning SW of the TTZ (β factor = 3.68) expressed in both shallowing of Moho and deepening of the crystalline basement. We interpret this feature as a fossilised crustal neck inherited after an Ediacaran rifting preceding the break-up of Rodinia. The early Permian rifting moderately contributed to the crustal thinning (β factor = 1.4), overprinting the primary rifted margin geometry. The 8 km deep MPT developed in front of a pre-existing crustal neck that obstructed further propagation of extensional deformation. Lithospheric mantle beneath a rift axis was probably too strong to accommodate extension but the thinner lithosphere farther west was weak enough to be stretched. Therefore, the location of the pre-existing weakness zone relative to a change in lithosphere thickness may localise a rift graben and shift the magmatism away from the surface expression of the rift. Thus, our study demonstrates that fossil crustal architecture was a key factor controlling the amount, distribution, and style of continental rifting."
