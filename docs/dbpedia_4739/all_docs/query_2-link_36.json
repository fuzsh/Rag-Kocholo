Concluding paragraphs include a quote from Nigeria's VP, but there's still no conclusive indication of why Nigeria isn't one of the new members. \"A heterogeneous alliance, the BRICS has in common demand for a more inclusive global balance, particularly with regard to the influence of the United States and the European Union. Meanwhile, at the summit, Vice President Kashim Shettima, who represented President Bola Tinubu, said his principal‚Äôs economic reforms and diplomatic alliances will attract investments and partnerships to Nigeria, while aligning with international and regional cooperation. According to him, ‚Äúthe new government, which began less than three months ago, is examining variables and evaluating the scope and level of regional and global cooperation to pursue, in order to establish Nigeria as desired friend and partner.‚Äù\" https://lnkd.in/dpkX-gnU\n\nFebruary 24th. 2024 ‚Äì A delegation from the Malta Diplomatic Mission of the State of the African Diaspora led by Ambassador Anthony C. Coleiro, Mr. Mark Christian ‚Äì Medical, Healthcare & Information Technology Attach√© and Mr. Martin Mercieca - Green & Global Sustainable Economy Attach√© paid a courtesy visit to the Malta Chamber of SMEs. The delegation was received by the President of the Chamber Mr. Paul Abela who was accompanied by Mr. Fabian Demicoli ‚Äì Head of Communication & EU Affairs and Mr. Jamie Tanti ‚Äì EU Affairs & Funding Executive. Ambassador Coleiro presented the Presidency of the Chamber, The State‚Äôs Official Dossier that included official documentation on the Organigram of the Government, Demographic, Political, Economic and Culture. The political, economic and cultural importance of this Diaspora is increasingly recognized. It contributes greatly to the development of Africa, and this is why the African Union has symbolically included the Diaspora in its organisation. Within the African Union, there are 6 regions: North Africa, West Africa, Central Africa, East Africa, Southern Africa, plus one last region, the ‚ÄúSixth Region‚Äù, which constitutes the African Diaspora. This ‚ÄúSixth Region‚Äù exists in the constitution of the African Union. In 2003, at the end of the AU Summit, the Heads of State declared (14 (XVIII) add.: ‚ÄúThe African Union (‚Ä¶) decides to recognize the African Diaspora as an effective entity contributing to economic and social development of the continent. ‚Äú For many years this ‚ÄúSixth Region‚Äù of the AU existed only on paper. Uncoordinated, it remained a virtual reality. It was therefore necessary to give substance to this institution and move from a de facto diaspora to a de jure diaspora. Key points of preliminary activity of the areas identified were the following: a. Trade Missions within the African Continent and Malta‚Ä¶ b. Collaborate on joint projects and initiatives‚Ä¶ c. Assisting respective Chamber‚Äôs members to network with each other‚Ä¶ d. Establishing open lines of communication‚Ä¶ e. Identifying common goals and passion projects‚Ä¶\n\nChilean delegation comes to Israel in a show of business solidarity. In a deep show of solidarity, a delegation of prominent members of Chile‚Äôs Jewish community and leading Chilean businesspeople came to Israel, meeting with President Isaac Herzog, other government officials, distinguished VIPs, and a senior Ministry of Economy delegation. In this series of lively sessions, a broad range of topics were discussed relating to supporting Israel‚Äôs economic recovery, including: - The economic consequences of October 7. - Gaining a better understanding of the mechanisms and the most effective ways to support Israel through investment and business. - Developing and promoting joint projects in support of Israel‚Äôs business community. - Israel and the Chilean Jewish community, and how to strengthen ties between Israel and the Jewish diaspora in Chile. The meetings were highly productive, yielding concrete plans and potential areas of cooperation to help Israel come back stronger than before.

The first delegations of both countries met at the Afro-Asian Conference in Bandung (Indonesia) in 1955. The people of both countries have a strong bond and a shared vision for the development of their nations. In recent years, the relationship between Vietnam and South Africa has strengthened in various fields, including economics, trade, and technology. There are ample opportunities for cooperation in tourism, cultural exchange, art, education, and mining. VUFO, in collaboration with the Vietnam-Africa Friendship and Cooperation Association (VAFCA) and the South African Embassy in Vietnam, has organized a wide range of activities to celebrate the anniversary of the diplomatic relations between the two countries. These activities include friendly meetings, conferences, trips for South African delegates to Vietnamese localities. VUFO hopes that Humile Mashatile will support and encourage South African agencies and organizations to further enhance friendly relations with Vietnam. VUFO also aims to establish a friendship group between South Africa and Vietnam and connect potential partners with VUFO and VAFCA. Humile Mashatile, spouse of South African Vice President Paul Mashatile, mentioned that the ongoing visit of the South African delegation builds upon the outcomes of Vice President Vo Thi Anh Xuan‚Äôs visit to South Africa in September 2023. During Vo Thi Anh Xuan‚Äôs visit, the two sides discussed cooperation in various areas such as politics, security, economics, education, and culture. According to Humile Mashatile, Vietnam and South Africa share similarities in their history. Both countries should continue to promote cooperation in activities that provide tangible benefits to the people, such as education, cultural exchange, and poverty eradication.

Katjavivi made these remarks during the 9th Brics Parliamentary Forum held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 27 to 29 September. According to parliament on Facebook, Katjavivi was invited to attend the forum by his counterpart Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. During the meeting, Katjavivi said even though Namibia was not yet a member of the bloc, its level of trade with current member countries has considerably improved. ‚ÄúI am happy to reveal that as of 2022, Namibia‚Äôs trade volume with current Brics countries has significantly increased. Therefore, Namibia already benefits immensely from Brics‚Äô countries and joining the bloc would amplify and even provide more growth and expansion,‚Äù he said. According to parliament, Katjavivi said the expected expansion of the bloc, which currently accounts for more than 40% of the world population and over 25% of the global gross domestic product, would result in immeasurable economic activities. Katjavivi implored African countries to capitalise on the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) in order to increase economic activities and achieve sustainable development so that the continent can liberate itself economically. Parliament said Katjavivi reminded lawmakers about the importance of collaboration and the role of the legislature in fostering economic growth and expansion. ‚ÄúThis forum presents an opportunity for us as parliaments in the developing world to connect with each other and establish linkages. Such linkages will hopefully mutually benefit our quest to represent, enact and oversee financial and economic legislation that is responsive to the needs and aspirations of our people and cognisant of the ongoing expansion of the bloc,‚Äù Katjavivi added. The theme of this year‚Äôs forum was: ‚ÄòHarnessing Multilateralism and Parliamentary Diplomacy to Deepen Brics and Africa Partnership for Accelerated Implementation of the AfCFTA.‚Äù Brics is focused on economic cooperation, multilateral trade and development. So far, almost 40 countries have expressed interest in joining the alliance.

This comes after the members of the BRICS announced during the just concluded BRICS Summit in South Africa that they will allow Argentina, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab Emirates into its grouping. The BRICS were first identified for the aim of showcasing investment possibilities and were not a recognised international organisation. Economic Lecturer Eden Shipanga is of the view that Namibia does not need to wait for an invitation to the BRICS. \"Denying yourself from joining BRICS is like denying yourself the future. The world is changing and we have seen how the geopolitics are changing the events. In fact we should be applying to join, we should not wait for any invitation,\" Shipanga stressed.
