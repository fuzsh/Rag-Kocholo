        "text": "Mota Engil SGPS S.A., listed on the most recognized markets in Germany, the United Kingdom and Portugal, denominated with the EGL indicator, has paid dividends to its investors since 2002, with few occasional suspensions, affected to some extent by the economic consequences of the restrictions implemented by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe interest is calculated according to the annual financial performance, from which the percentage to be paid is derived, calculated by the company's administrative department and approved by its shareholders' meeting, and is paid in one installment, generally in May, with a yield of approximately 4.80%.\n\nMota Engil SGPS S.A., a conglomerate group of Portuguese origin, specializes in the execution of civil works and infrastructure construction, as well as logistics, warehousing, retail, energy and steel works.\n\nIt was founded in 1946 in Amarante by Manuel Antonio da Mota, under the name of Mota &amp; Companhia, immediately creating a branch in Angola, working in the exploration and transformation of wood, gradually changing until entering the Construction and Public Works sector, obtaining in 1952 the contract for the execution of the Luanda International Airport.\n\nEngil was created in the 1950s by Mr. Fernando José Saraiva and Mr. António Lopes de Almeida, beginning with the construction and development of housing, and later obtaining the contract for the Castelo Branco Industrial and Commercial School, as well as the construction of the bridge over the Tua River.\n\nAfter several companies carried out an extensive expansion process and consolidated their experience, they decided to merge in 2000 to form the Mota-Engil group, entering Poland, Ireland, Mexico, Peru, Africa and Central Europe, through the acquisition of several companies and the creation of other subsidiaries.\n\nThe group develops construction projects in almost 50 countries, highlighting its participation in Airport, Hydraulic, Port, Road, Urban, Railway, electromechanical infrastructure, support platforms for the Oil and Gas industry, executing works such as Public Buildings, Offices and Commerce, Housing, Building Rehabilitation, Silos and Chimneys, with technical areas of specialization focused on Aggregates, Rentals and Transportation, Concretes, Special Foundations, Geotechnics, Prestressing and Precast."
