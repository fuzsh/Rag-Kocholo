        "meta_description": "Building on a long-standing collaboration between Rhodium Group and MERICS, this report summarizes China's investment footprint on the EU-27 and the UK in 2021, analyzing the shifting patterns in China's FDI, as well as policy developments in Europe and China. , Key findings Chinese outbound investment to the rest of the world stalled in 2021. While overall global FDI rebounded strongly, Chinese outbound FDI edged up by just 3 percent to USD 114 billion (EUR 96 billion). Meanwhile, China’s global outbound M&A activity slipped in 2021 to a 14-year low, with completed M&A transactions totaling just EUR 20 billion, down 22 percent from an already weak 2020. China’s FDI in Europe (EU-27 and the UK) increased but remained on its multi-year downward trajectory. Last year, completed Chinese FDI in Europe increased 33 percent to EUR 10.6 billion, from EUR 7.9 billion in 2020. The increase was driven by two factors: a EUR 3.7 billion acquisition of the Philips home appliance business by Hong Kong-based private equity firm Hillhouse Capital and record high greenfield investment of EUR 3.3 billion. Still, 2021 was the second lowest year (above only 2020) for China’s investment in Europe since 2013.  The Netherlands received most Chinese investment, followed by Germany, France and the UK. Hillhouse Capital’s takeover of the Philips business made the Netherlands the biggest destination for Chinese investment in 2021. Germany, France and the UK accounted for another 39 percent of total Chinese investment.  The share of Chinese state-owned investors fell to a 20-year low in Europe. Compared with 2020, investment by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) decreased by 10 percent. Their share of total Chinese investment also reached its lowest point in 20 years, at 12 percent. SOE investment was concentrated in energy and infrastructure, particularly in southern Europe.  Consumer products and automotive were the top sectors. Due to the Hillhouse Capital acquisition, investment in consumer products surged to EUR 3.8 billion. Activity in automotive was driven by Chinese greenfield investments in electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Together, the two sectors accounted for 59 percent of total investment value. The next three biggest sectors were health, pharma and biotech; information and communications technology (ICT); and energy.  The nature of Chinese investment in Europe is changing. After years of being dominated by M&A, Chinese investment in Europe has become more focused on greenfield projects. In 2021, greenfield investment reached EUR 3.3 billion, the highest ever recorded value, making up almost a third of all Chinese FDI.  Chinese venture capital (VC) investment is pouring into European tech start-ups. In 2021, Chinese VC investment in Europe more than doubled to the record level of EUR 1.2 billion. It was concentrated in the UK and Germany, and focused on a handful sectors including e-commerce, fintech, gaming, AI and robotics.  Chinese investment in Europe is unlikely to rebound in 2022. The Chinese government is expected to stick to strict capital controls, financial deleveraging and Covid-19 restrictions. The war in Ukraine and expanding screening regimes and scrutiny of Chinese investment in the EU and the UK will create additional headwinds.  , 1. Introduction: China’s outbound investment stalled in 2021 2021 saw a strong global recovery in foreign direct investment flows from exceptionally low levels in 2020. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), global direct investment flows rebounded by 77 percent to exceed pre-pandemic levels.  Chinese global investment was an exception to this trend and stalled in 2021. According to official Chinese statistics, China’s outbound non-financial investment increased by 3 percent only in 2021 to USD 114 billion (EUR 96 billion). China’s global outbound M&A activity slipped to a 14-year low in 2021, with completed mergers and acquisitions totaling just EUR 25 billion, down 9 percent from 2020 and 45 percent from 2019.  That China’s global outward foreign direct investment (OFDI) did not recover was due to several factors: China’s overseas investment activity had been declining since 2016, due to domestic constraints on outbound capital flows and tightening scrutiny of Chinese investments abroad.  The lack of a recovery is also likely linked to China’s adherence to a zero-Covid strategy, which hindered cross-border travel and thus deal-making activities. What’s more, sharp competition for global assets in a booming M&A context likely put Chinese buyers at a disadvantage due to their limited international experience and emerging regulatory concerns.  Exhibit 1 , 2. Chinese FDI in Europe: 2021 Trends 2.1 Chinese FDI in Europe remained at an 8-year low despite rebound While China’s global outbound investment did not recover in 2021, Chinese FDI in Europe rebounded, increasing 33 percent from a Covid-induced low point of EUR 7.9 billion in 2020 to EUR 10.6 billion in 2021 (see exhibit 2). The rebound occurred despite continued outbound capital controls in China, pandemic-related travel restrictions, and a now fully operational EU FDI screening regime. However, Chinese investment in Europe remains at very low levels compared to the 2016 high of EUR 47 billion.  Much of the 2021 increase was related to one very large transaction: The Hong Kong-based private equity firm Hillhouse Capital purchased Philips’ home appliances unit. This EUR 3.7 billion acquisition accounted for roughly one third of total Chinese investment in Europe and was the sixth largest ever recorded Chinese investment in Europe. Single large deals like this in an environment of overall low investment volume make it difficult to identify clear, long-lasting trends.  Several other large acquisitions were announced in 2021 but did not go ahead. Gopher Investments shelved a multi-billion EUR bid for the British gambling software developer Playtech (although they still plan to acquire Playtech’s financial trading division in 2022). Tencent saw its planned acquisition of British video game developer Sumo Group stall due to investment screening in the United States (the transaction will go ahead in 2022).  While Chinese M&A grew by 26 percent, accounting for 69 percent of the total (EUR 7.3 billion), it remained below pre-pandemic levels. Greenfield investment was the real surprise, reaching a record high of EUR 3.3 billion (We discuss this development in chapter 3.1).  !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var a in e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r",

The Chinese government is expected to stick to strict capital controls, financial deleveraging and Covid-19 restrictions. The war in Ukraine and expanding screening regimes and scrutiny of Chinese investment in the EU and the UK will create additional headwinds.\n\nThis increase was driven by a handful of large deals in automotive and ICT: SVOLT Energy’s and CATL’s EV battery plants in Germany, Envision AESC’s EV battery plants in France and the UK, ByteDance’s data center in Ireland and Huawei’s optoelectronics R&D center in the UK. As such, it does not yet constitute a solid, multi-year trend across many players or sectors. Yet, with now over a third of China’s FDI to Europe going to greenfield projects, China’s footprint in Europe is now looking quite different from the past.\n\nThis shift towards greenfield investment is likely shaped by several factors:\n\nChinese firms exploring overseas opportunities: Companies such as CATL, which thanks to its dominant position in China now commands 32.6 percent of the global EV battery market, are looking to escape a crowded and increasingly mature home market and tap into attractive overseas opportunities and diversify their business. Firms like Tiktok have also built internationally successful brands and are investing to roll them out in high-growth destinations.\n\nA need to integrate into European supply chains: Chinese greenfield investments are also fueled by the need for a local presence in certain sectors. Batteries, for instance, are costly to ship, so OEMs have a high incentive to build local battery plants to serve growing European EV production capacity.\n\nCompliance with EU regulations: In the ICT sector, players like ByteDance are facing stringent local regulations (including GDPR) and hence need to invest in local capacity to ensure that such regulation is respected (e.g., that user data is stored in Europe).\n\nTapping into Europe’s innovation system: Greenfield investments can become a new avenue for technology acquisition. Huawei’s research and development center (R&D) and CATL’s battery plant – which also includes R&D facilities – will be used as springboards to tap into Europe’s innovation system and skilled workforce. Both have announced plans to use their investments to enter into R&D collaborations with European research institutes, universities and local industry.\n\nAvoiding regulatory hurdles: Greenfield investment is typically subject to fewer screening measures by national governments and tends to be more welcome locally – for example, as a channel to create local jobs and contribute to local tax revenue.\n\nThe rise in Chinese greenfield investment in Europe is a reflection of global trends. China’s global footprint has shifted more towards greenfield projects over the past couple of years.\n\nThis may be most potent in the NEV sector: In Asia, Envision AESC is building a battery plant in Japan for EUR 387 million and a Chinese consortium that includes CATL plans to invest EUR 4.2 billion in an Indonesian lithium battery plant. In the US, Envision AESC has announced plans to build a battery plant to supply Mercedes-Benz. CATL is also scouting for a location for a battery plant in North America worth up to EUR 4.5 billion.\n\nIn short, Chinese firms are now investing heavily in global production sites, compared to their historical focus on asset and company acquisitions.\n\nIn 2022, we expect China’s FDI flows into the EU to remain at the current low levels. Existing constraints on Chinese outbound investments remain in place, and new ones have emerged. This does not preclude the possibility of another investment uptick in 2022: current low investment volumes make it difficult to identify clear trends, and any single large deal could translate into sizeable changes in China’s investment level or structure (by country, sector, ownership or type). The era of massive Chinese investment in Europe seems over for now.\n\nThe most important factors that will shape Chinese investment flows to Europe in 2022 are:\n\nIn China:\n\nTight capital controls: China’s capital controls, a key driver of the decline in Chinese global outbound FDI since 2016, are unlikely to be relaxed in 2022. Instead, China’s leadership will prioritize stability in the run-up to the 20th Party Congress (inclusive of economic and capital flow stability), especially at a time of slowing economic growth.\n\nZero-Covid policies: Strict Covid-19 containment policies continue to complicate China’s economic engagement with the outside world. With the significant uptick in Covid-19 infections in China, international travel restrictions are likely to remain in place for much of 2022. This will keep the pace of deal-making down and hinder due diligence processes.\n\nLower growth: Slowing growth in China could, however, make overseas investment more attractive in certain sectors. Companies in slowing sectors in China, facing strong domestic competition, might be encouraged to go abroad in search of new market opportunities.\n\nChina’s tech policies: China will likely continue to crack down on certain parts of its tech sector, particularly consumer and other digital technologies. Combined with Europe’s openness to Chinese VC investments, this could lead to continued high VC interest in the region.\n\nIn the EU:\n\nRamped up regulatory scrutiny of FDI: Eight EU member states are planning to develop or amend their investment screening regimes in 2022, and in January, the UK enacted the National Security and Investment Act. These moves could further increase scrutiny of inbound Chinese investment. The EU is also moving ahead with various new regulations – on procurement, foreign subsidies, supply chain due diligence and anti-coercion – that could impact market access for Chinese companies in Europe and diminish appetite for investment.\n\nEU-China tensions: Tensions in the EU-China relationship following tit-for-tat sanctions in March 2021 and Beijing’s imposition of a trade embargo on Lithuania in December 2021 are likely to continue to weigh on bilateral ties in 2022. With Chinese sanctions on EU lawmakers in place, the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) is likely to remain on ice through 2022.\n\nGeopolitical impact of the war in Ukraine: The exact impact of the war in Ukraine on China’s investment will depend on the development of the crisis and the stance the Chinese government ends up taking towards the conflict. However, the war has already triggered intense debates on critical infrastructure and resilience in Europe, which could in turn increase scrutiny of Chinese investment in a number of sectors including infrastructure, transport and energy."
