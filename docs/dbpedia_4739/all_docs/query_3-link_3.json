        "text": "While construction output did grow in 2022, there has been very little good news – either for construction or for Europe.\n\nIn February, Russia invaded Ukraine, sparking much human misery in Ukraine itself, but also a painful combination of materials and energy price rises, protracted supply chain issues and rising inflation that only now shows signs of abating.\n\nWith this in mind, the fact that the total combined revenues of the CE100 companies topped €500 billion for the first time is significant.\n\nThe highest figure previously recorded on the CE100 was €480 billion, in the pre-Covid year of 2019.\n\nBelow are Europe’s 25 biggest construction companies ranked by turnover based on their 2022 financial results. For the full CE100 list, see the latest issue of Construction Europe magazine:\n\nPosition Turnover (€ million) Company Country Position last year Movement 1 61675 Vinci France 1 - 2 44102 Bouygues Construction France 2 - 3 33615 ACS Spain 3 - 4 25852 Hochtief Germany 4 -\n\n5\n\n20867 Eiffage France 5 -\n\n6\n\n17025 Strabag Austria 6 -\n\n7\n\n13648 Skanska Sweden 7 -\n\n8\n\n11195 Acciona Spain 9 +1\n\n9\n\n10261 Balfour Beatty UK 8 -1\n\n10\n\n9980 Saipem Italy 12 +2\n\n11\n\n8092 Spie France 11 -\n\n12\n\n7705 FCC Spain 15 +3\n\n13\n\n7551 Ferrovial Spain 13 -\n\n14\n\n6618 BAM Group Netherlands 10 -4\n\n15\n\n6599 VolkerWessels Netherlands 14 -1\n\n16\n\n6225 Peab Sweden 16 -\n\n17\n\n5859 Barratt Developments UK 18 +1\n\n18\n\n5851 Sacyr Vallehermoso Spain 22 +4\n\n19\n\n5786 Porr Austria 21 +2\n\n20\n\n5760 WeBuild Italy 17 -3\n\n21\n\n5705 NCC GRoup Sweden 19 -2\n\n22\n\n5217 Taylor Wimpey UK 20 -2\n\n23\n\n4401 Ackermanns & van Haaren Belgium 25 +2\n\n24\n\n4396 Persimmon UK 24 -\n\n25\n\n4351 Nexity France 23 -2\n\nThe rise and rise of Vinci\n\nThe impressive growth of Vinci, at the top of the list, is a major factor in this result, with the company leaping up from revenues of €49.8 billion last year, to this year’s eye-watering €61.7 billion.\n\nAs a group, Vinci obviously suffered during Covid, with many of the airports and roads on which it holds concessions barely registering traffic during the harshest periods of lockdown.\n\nDuring 2022, it resoundingly recovered, with its construction division reporting very strong business levels and an improved margin, despite the higher costs and supply chain difficulties that were continuing from the previous year.\n\nAlong with many of the companies at the top end of the CE100 list, Vinci announced it had moved to a “highly selective approach when taking on new business”. It also said it was tracking ongoing megatrends, including the decarbonisation of transport infrastructure and buildings, the digital revolution and the adoption of renewable energy.\n\nWithin this space, Vinci Energies continued to grow its business, while the integration of the recently-acquired renewable energy company Cobra IS included the award of major new contracts.\n\nMovement at the top of the table\n\nThe rest of the CE100’s top 10 companies remain reasonably settled, with the top seven retaining their places and Spain’s Acciona (8th) and the UK’s Balfour Beatty (9th) swapping last year’s positions.\n\nThe Netherlands-based BAM Group fell from last year’s 10th spot, down to 15th, due largely to divestments the company completed in Belgium and Germany. These resulted in a 10% decline in total revenue, but BAM said it was confident of delivering on its 2023 strategic targets.\n\nIn terms of movement, there are very few surprises in the top 25 companies on the list. The first sizeable move comes from Spain’s Tecnicas Reunidas, which moves up 16 places to 27th.\n\nCommenting on the company’s 2022 results, executive chairman Juan Lladó predicted a “multiyear investment supercycle in the energy sector, in both the traditional and the low carbon sector”.\n\nDescribing Tecnicas’ 51% rise in sales, compared with 2021, he said, “The market is giving us the opportunity to grow and we will.”\n\nBig rises and new entries\n\nAnother big top-half move is Portugal’s Mota-Engil, which has risen 15 places to 33rd.\n\nThe leap is the result of a 47% rise in revenue, compared with 2021’s result, with net income up a whopping 90%. It follows the acquisition of a 30% stake in the company by state-owned Chinese contracting giant China Communications Construction Company (CCCC) in 2020. Mota-Engil needed an injection of capital and the deal was attractive to CCCC, which wanted greater access to Africa and Latin America, where the Portuguese firm already has significant experience.\n\nIn its end-of-year report for 2022, Mota-Engil described its strategic plan of creating five business segments, including three regions (Africa, Europe and Latin America). Of these, it highlighted the stunning performance of Latin America, which grew its revenues by 145%, along with very strong results from Africa (+44%).\n\nAnd speaking of top performances, the highest new entry on the CE100, is another Spanish contractor, Elecnor, which saw growth both in its home market and with international awards, which now total 59% of revenues.\n\nElecnor comes straight into the CE100 list at number 34, and with a turnover in 2022 of just over €3.6 billion.\n\nFinancial analysis\n\nThe figures for this year’s CE100 list are based on revenues from 2022 – a year that saw a continuing upward trend, in terms of construction output, but ended with the promise of further challenges ahead, in the shape of rising inflation and increasing geopolitical fallout, due to the ongoing war in Ukraine.\n\nFrom a construction perspective, revenues for the CE100 companies totalled €504.7 billion in 2022, a very impressive increase of just over 12% on the previous year’s figure.\n\nWhile France’s construction market is fighting similar challenges to many European countries, its largest contractor (Vinci) remains head and shoulders above its CE100 challengers, with revenue of approximately €61.8 billion.\n\nWhile France has only eight companies in the top 100, it has three in the top 10 and a total combined revenue of €146.1 billion, or 28.9% of the list’s total.\n\nGiven the size of the construction markets in Germany and the UK, one might be surprised to find that Spanish contractors take the second spot, in terms of combined revenues, with €82.3 billion.\n\nFrom a total of 12 companies on the list, Spain has five in the top 20, with ACS in third place, reporting revenue of €33.6 billion in 2022.\n\nThe UK boasts 23 CE100 companies, more than any other nation, but has only one, Balfour Beatty, in the top 10.\n\nCombined revenues from UK companies totals €71.9 billion.\n\nSimilarly, Germany also has only one company in the top 10 (Hochtief, in fourth spot). Beyond that, there are only seven more German companies in the top 100, with combined revenues totalling €41.5 billion.\n\nAnother major construction market, Italy, also comes in with eight CE100 companies, the highest of which is Saipem in 10th spot.\n\nCombined revenues for Italian companies on the list total €24.1 billion, which represents just 4.8% of the entire CE100.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe CE100 is based on sales revenues in 2022. It is compiled from a range of sources including audited annual accounts, companies’ own statements of revenues and information from reputable third parties, such as Dun & Bradstreet.\n\nIn some cases CE has estimated company revenues."
