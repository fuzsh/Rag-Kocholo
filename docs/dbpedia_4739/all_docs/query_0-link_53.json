The plant is capable of producing 6000t/day( 200 trucks of 600 pieces of 50kg bags)of cement. The US$1.5bn facility aims to transform the local cement industry and will create 10,000 new direct and indirect jobs. Mangal Industries has partnered with China-based Sinoma International Engineering for the plant’s construction, with a reported cost of US$600m. Finland-based Wärtsilä has won a 10-year operations and maintenance agreement for a 50MW captive power plant to power the facility. Initially, the plant will use liquid fuel, but a pipeline will be constructed to allow it to use natural gas. Chair Alhaji Dahiru Mangal said “This factory will employ the latest technology and adhere to the highest environmental standards. It is part of our ambitious programme to address Nigeria’s infrastructure and housing deficits, while demonstrating our confidence in the region’s economic outlook.” Please visit www.comprinternational.com.

When Otuedo and Powei look at you, their eyes stare into your soul. Recalling their canoeing journey, their voices reveal the hardships they've faced. Wearing Nigeria’s green, the duo exhibit contrasting yet complementary characters — Powei, the articulate spokesperson, and Otuedo, a silent strength. At 22, Powei is already competing in her second Olympic Games, while the 26-year-old Otuedo will debut in Paris 2024. Both hail from fishing families, with Powei's remarkable birth story symbolising their deep connection to the water. “I was born in a boat,” Powei said. “While my mother was pregnant with me and when it was time for me to come out, she was paddling home and there was no one around. That day, along with many fish, there was a little baby.” Powei clearly recalls her first taste of paddling. She said: “When I was eight, my sister introduced me to canoeing. At first, I was reluctant but then I tried it out, I was like: ‘wow’. I knew since then that I wanted to reach the top and reach the Olympic level.” After meeting at a national sprint championship, where the two of them competed for the state of Bayelsa, Otuedo and Powei decided to team up. However, their journey has been far from easy. Funding training has been a constant problem and Ottuedo has been working as a nurse to sponsor herself while Powei works at a salon. “We both come from different places and it was very difficult to train together. For Paris 2024 preparations, we moved to Abuja for training. The Government is funding us for this and other major competitions,” Powei said. After competing in two International Canoe Federation World Cups in Krakow and Szeged earlier this year, Ottuedo and Powei thanked Sebastian Cuattrin, the Brazilian Olympian and ICF Global Lead for Flatwater, who helped them in crucial moments. At Paris 2024, Ottuedo and Powei finished fifth in the women's canoe double 500m quarter-final, qualifying for the Final B scheduled for August 9. Having competed in the Olympic stage, they wanted to let other girls in their country know that anything is possible with hard work and sacrifice. “With God on your side, everything is possible. If you desire something and work hard, it is achievable,” Powei said. #madeinnigeria #paris2024 #olympics #olympians #naija #nigeria #champions #westafrica\n\nMeet Julius Rone, the gas kingpin pioneering Nigeria’s first floating LNG Julius Rone stands at the forefront of Nigeria’s energy sector as the CEO of UTM Offshore, a company spearheading the development of the country’s inaugural floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility. BusinessDay’s findings showed UTM Offshore’s FLNG project will unlock a new era of LNG industry growth in Nigeria and across the region as the energy demand continues to increase. This ambitious project marks a significant milestone in Nigeria’s quest to enhance energy infrastructure and solidify its position as a key player in the global LNG market. UTM Offshore State-owned oil company Nigerian National Petroleum (NNPC) entered heads of agreement with UTM Offshore to purchase a 20 percent equity stake in the project in July 2023. In December 2023, UTM Offshore, the Delta State Government, and NNPCL signed a shareholder agreement to jointly develop the project. The project will be owned by UTM FLNG (72 percent), a special-purpose vehicle formed for the development of the project by UTM Offshore, NNPC (20 percent) and Delta State Government (8percent). The project is expected to produce 1.5 million tonnes per annum of liquified natural gas (LNG) for export markets and 300,000 tonnes of LPG a year for domestic consumption and some quantities of condensate. Location details The UTM FLNG facility is being developed at the Yoho field at a water depth of 64m. The Yoho field is situated within oil mining lease (OML) 104, approximately 60km from shore. It is owned by ExxonMobil (40percent, operator) and NNPC (60 percent) and commenced production in 2003. Credit: BusinessDay Please visit www.comprinternational.com.

Alhaji Dangote stated this while delivering the first keynote address during the Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), 2024 summit in Abuja. According to the Chairman of Dangote Group, the cause of the inflation in major advanced economies in Europe and the United States which necessitated interest rate hikes was different from that of developing countries mostly in Africa. He traced the cause of inflation in North America and Europe to the cash transfer program implemented by governments during the pandemic period in 2022 and stated that in total around $18 trillion was disbursed to individuals and businesses during the period. He noted that nothing of such significance happened across economies in Africa. He said, “Mr. Vice President, I know that today we are battling with very high interest rates. This interest rate is now saying that we should fight inflation. I’m not an economist, I’m just a local businessman. Please visit www.comprinternational.com.
