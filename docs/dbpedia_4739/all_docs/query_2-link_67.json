        "text": "The thrive for climate-neutral and environmentally friendly mobility as expressed in the 2019 European Green Deal has placed the rail sector at the forefront of recent EU policy objectives. One such objective is to increase the share of rail transport in the EU, which is essential to achieve the EU’s climate goals. Rail transport is the most sustainable means of transport as it represents only 0,4 of the EU’s total CO2 emissions (2022 EU statistical pocketbook data), despite having a share of 5,4% of passenger transport and 17% of freight transport across Europe. However, this shift to rail has yet to be achieved. Despite considerable efforts towards market liberalization and technical harmonization undertaken by fundamental regulatory reforms through the four railway packages adopted in 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2016, a lot remains to be done. A second EU policy objective is to ensure a resilient and interconnected cross-border transport system, notably in times of crisis, as shown during the Covid-19 pandemic. As early as March 2020, EU member states agreed on the need to have a coordinated approach to ensure economic continuity and connectivity by promoting public transport as an essential service and public good. This focused action helped the rail sector to cope with the adverse economic effects of the pandemic. Finally, European legislation and policy initiatives deal with the digital and data-driven market for mobility services, which is still young, dynamic and developing. To this end, the 2021 Revised Rail Passengers Rights Regulation to be implemented by Member States by June 2023 aims at improving data sharing. In addition, the European Commission has launched the Multimodal Digital Mobility Services Initiative, which is directed at rail ticketing to foster comprehensive route planning and ticketing offered by railway undertakings and third-party ticket vendors.\n\n12 Jan 2023\n\nThe EU Court of Justice finds that a national court may order the disclosure of evidence during the course of damages proceedings, even if the proceedings have been stayed owing to the Commission’s initiation of an investigation concerning the same infringement (RegioJet)\n\nEuropean Court of Justice\n\nEuropean Court of Justice (Luxembourg)\n\nA national court may order the disclosure of evidence for the purpose of proceedings for damages connected with an alleged infringement of competition law, even if the proceedings have been stayed owing to the Commission’s initiation of an investigation concerning the same infringement* That (…)"
