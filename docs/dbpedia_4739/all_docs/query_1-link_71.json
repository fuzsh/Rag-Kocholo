        "text": "28 September 2020 – The Horizon Equity Partners fund has finalised its acquisition of a 50% stake in the company that built and operates the Beatriz Ângelo Hospital, in Loures, along with a 40% stake in the Santos Espírito Hospital on Terceira Island, in the Azores. The fund manager reportedly paid approximately 75 million euros, including the assumption of debt, to Mota-Engil for the assets.\n\nLoures Hospital has been functioning since 2012, and has an operating contract with SGHL – Sociedade Gestora do Hospital de Loures that lasts until 2039. Other shareholders in the firm include Luz Saúde, Novo Banco, Opway and Dalkia.\n\nThe firm that controls the hospital in the Azores Hospital also saw its contract extended until 2039. Such firms as Aberdeen, the Marques group and Dalki hold the other 60% of the firm.\n\nOriginal Story: Economia Online – António Costa\n\nTranslation/Summary: Richard D. Turner\n\n2 September 2020 – Two consortia headed by Mota-Engil and Sacyr were selected to participate in the next phase of negotiations in the tender for the construction of the Hospital Lisboa Oriental. The two losing consortia – Acciona and Teixeira Duarte – have until September 23 to contest the decision. The Sacyr consortium, of which Aberdeen Infrastructure is also a part, submitted the lowest price. In contrast, the Mota-Engil consortium, which is part of InfraRed Capital Partners, ranked highest in technical quality. According to the rules for the public tender, price weighs 40% and technical quality 60%.\n\nThe bid submitted by the Sacyr group was for approximately 293.8 million euros, while Mota-Engil offered almost €333. Market watchers expect the Lisbon and Tagus Valley Regional Health Administration to award the 30-year contract by the end of this year.\n\nThe contract includes three years for construction and 27 years for the operation and maintenance of the asset. The future hospital will have 875 beds, at least 25% more than the total for the six other units it will replace (S. José, Curry Cabral, Maternidade Alfredo da Costa, Estefânia, Santa Marta and Capuchos). The public entity also estimates savings of 70 million euros per year by centralising services in a single unit.\n\nOriginal Story: Jornal de Negócios – Maria João Babo\n\nTranslation/Summary: Richard D. Turner\n\n27 August 2020 – The Portuguese construction company Mota-Engil announced that it is in the final stage of negotiations to create a strategic partnership and investment agreement with “one of the largest infrastructure groups in the world (top 5), with significant operations worldwide.” The reputed new shareholder, CCCC – China Communication Construction Corporation, has had a strategic partnership with Mota Engil since 2019. The Chinese construction giant will acquire a 30% stake in an operation “well above the current market price.”\n\nMota Gestão e Participações (MGP), Mota-Engil’s parent company, agreed to sell a 30% equity stake in the company, according to a note sent to Portugal’s Securities Market Commission (CMVM). The agreement, which is expected to be completed shortly, will involve a 100-million share capital increase, leaving MGP with a 40% stake.\n\nOriginal Story: Idealista\n\nTranslation/Summary: Richard D. Turner\n\n11 March 2020 – With Portugal set to take over the Presidency of the European Council during the first semester of 2021, the Portuguese government has signed a lease to install its offices in Lisbon’s Centro Cultural de Belém (CCB). Other cultural events generally held at the space will remain unaffected.\n\nThe report follows the news last year that the Centro Cultural de Belém Foundation (FCCB) would open an international public tender for the concession to develop modules 4 and 5 of the CCB project. The new spaces will include a shopping gallery and a hotel, in a project with an estimated investment of between 60 million and 70 million euros.\n\nThe firm Mota-Engil was the only candidate for the 50-year concession and will pay a yearly rent of €900,000, in addition to the necessary investments in the modules’ development.\n\nOriginal Story: Idealista\n\nTranslation/Summary: Richard D. Turner\n\n30 January 2020 – Mota-Engil has begun work on Vanguard Properties’s new development: the Infinity Tower. The 195-flat apartment block, located in the Campolide area of Lisbon, will have 26 above-ground floors and is expected to be ready in mid-2022.\n\nThe project will have 50,000 square meters of construction area, in an investment of more than 90 million euros. Initial sales prices will run from €4,200 to €9,200/m2.\n\nThe architectural firm of Saraiva+Associados designed the building, which will have an outdoor swimming pool on the 24th floor, an indoor swimming pool for adults, another for children, two rooms for events, a well-equipped gym, a spa, meeting rooms and an interior patio with extensive gardens and paddle tennis court.\n\nOriginal Story: Diário Imobiliário\n\nTranslation/Summary: Richard D. Turner\n\n17 December 2019 – Mota-Engil is continuing the construction of Project Tawny, in Paranhos, Porto. The new development will consist of a more than 78,000 square-meter plot of land, sufficient for over 56,000 m2 of buildable area.\n\nThough it seems that work halted briefly on the site, Mota-Engil and Round Hill have assured us that work continues unabated. Pedro Bagulho, Executive Director at Mota-Engil, commented, “Mota-Engil continues to work closely with Round Hill Capital on the construction of the Project Tawny development in Porto, known as The Tannery, Amial, which is an exciting, significant mixed-use, urban regeneration development project. We look forward to continuing the work beyond the structure early in the new year and we are currently continuing infrastructure works.”\n\nA spokesperson at Round Hill Capital added, “In June 2017, we acquired The Tannery, Amial, an eight-hectare site within the Porto Innovation District, a hub of university faculties, hospitals and technology start-ups close to major transport links. Clients advised by Round Hill Capital have committed €100 million for this significant mixed-use, urban regeneration development project that will be constructed over the next few years with completions based on market take up.\n\nGood progress is continuing with the masterplan, designed by Bogle Architects, which was awarded a Commendation in the Mixed-Use category at the MIPIM/Architectural Review: Future Projects Award 2018. The development is progressing well and construction works are continuing on the necessary infrastructures and supermarket. The student accommodation block, phase 1, has reached its concrete structural completion with remaining works to follow.”\n\nProject Tawny is slated for development into accommodations for 1,200 students, 200 residential flats, a hotel, shops, offices, a market, a supermarket, parking and gardens.\n\nOriginal Story: Richard D. K. Turner\n\nAdaptation/Translation: Richard D. K. Turner\n\n2 June 2018\n\nA project by the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma and the Portuguese studio OODA was the basis for the proposal by the company Mota-Engil that won the competition for the “Reconversion and Exploration of Porto’s Former Industrial Slaughterhouse.”\n\nThe purpose of the competition is to transform the building that was abandoned about 20 years ago into one of Porto’s most important venues, which will have areas for culture and social interactions, along with corporate activities. The development will remain faithful to the memory of the original building, which dates to 1910. The estimated investment, by private individuals, is expected to amount to 40 million euros.\n\nWithout exaggerating, we believe that the Matadouro [Slaughterhouse] will be for Porto, much as the Pompidou Centre is to Paris. The Parisian centre, designed by the Italian architect, Renzo Piano, brought international accolades to the City of Light.\n\nAccording to the project’s authors, the proposal, with 20,500 square meters of constructed area, intends to “reactivate, reinvent, the space, giving continuity to its history and that of the city.” The future building will become a major point of interconnection in the city, benefitting from a direct connection to the Metro and important, nearby roads. The venue will establish “a dialogue with the adjacent infrastructure.”\n\nIt is a project that will help define the city, for its elegance and dimension, with a strong visual impact. The development will help spread the image of Porto throughout the world\n\nPorto City Council’s communications department stated that the Matadouro, “considering its interconnections with public transport and other infrastructures (the Campanhã Intermodal Terminal and the new bridge that will connect the city’s eastern zone to Gaia), can serve as major economic, social, cultural and demographic engine of growth for Porto’s eastern parishes (Bonfim and Campanhã), and potentially a hub that will dynamize the entire city.”\n\nThe Japanese architect’s atelier became world-renowned for its project for the new Tokyo National Stadium, which will host the opening ceremony of the 2020 Olympic Games.\n\nHeadquartered in Porto, OODA was founded in 2009 by the architects Diogo Brito, Francisco Lencastre and Rodrigo Vilas-Boas. Its projects include the recent design for expanding and renovating the French Lycée in Lisbon.\n\nOriginal Story: Diário Imobiliário\n\nTranslation: Richard Turner"
