        "text": "The Portuguese construction giant Mota Engil has been attacking West Africa in recent years. Last big project to date; the imminent revival of the Dakar-Kidira railway line for a total amount of 600 million euros\n\nIt is difficult to escape the yellow and blue colors of the giant Portuguese construction companies on public works sites in southern Africa in the center and west.\n\nFor two and a half years, MOTA ENGIL has been working “on the body” with the Senegalese government to entrust to it the concession of two railways DAKAR-KIDIRA and Ziguinchor-TAMBACOUNDA.\n\nThe gamble of the Portuguese giant is to mesh the country from the NORTH to the South and from west to east by lines that will not only open up the least served areas in terms of communication routes but also confirm the Senegalese capital in its status. the most fluid hub of the sub-region in the face of increasingly ambitious competitors.\n\nThis project which espouses the ambitions of the Senegalese government will certainly be the second step of the process in discussion between the Portuguese and the Senegalese government which wants a rehabilitation of the metric line between Dakar and Kidira with the development of about twenty railway stations, a dry port at Tambacounda as well as relevant junctions with the port of the future under construction at BARGNY and the port of Dakar.\n\nThis project for which MOTA ENGIL’s proposal currently on the table of the Senegalese authorities is a concession in BOT and mobilizes an investment of approximately 600 million euros could start before the month of July 2018.\n\nIn the second phase, MOTA ENGIL plans to invest 2.5 billion euros for the construction of standard gauge lines between Ziguinchor and Tamba and Tamba and Dakar.\n\nWhat to put water to the mill of a Senegalese government criticized for having favored the project of Regional Express Train TER whose pill has difficulty to pass in the opinion of Senegalese."
