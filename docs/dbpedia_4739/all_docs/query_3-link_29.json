        "text": "Ferromex, the railway subsidiary of the Mexico-based conglomerate Grupo México, announced that it halted the operation of 60 of its cargo trains to ensure the safety of a large number of migrants seeking to reach the US. The company warned that situations of this nature represent significant disruptions to the local and international supply chain.\n\nGrupo México reported that in recent days, it registered a series of incidents within Ferromex’s routes that involved several migrants who were injured while they were trying to board the company’s freight trains, aiming to reach the US. The company noted that the number of migrants has constantly increased over the past few days despite the risk that boarding such trains represent.\n\nThe company reported that over 1,500 migrants were found in its operation yards in Torreon, Coahuila; over 800 in Irapuato, Guanajuato; 1,000 in San Francisco de los Romo, Aguascalientes and more than 1,000 within the route that goes from Chihuahua to Ciudad Juarez. To prevent more accidents from happening, Ferromex decided to halt the operations of 60 trains on Sep. 19, 2023. “Ferromex will closely monitor the measures that all levels of government determine,” the company stated in a press release.\n\nIn the morning of Sep. 20, 2023, anonymous sources within Grupo México told Expansión that the company had resumed operations on a portion of the previously halted trains. However, they did not specify the exact number of trains that have been put back into service, noting that the majority of them remain idle."
