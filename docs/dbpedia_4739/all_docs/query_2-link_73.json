        "text": "Indian Oil's petrochemical capacity to more than triple by 2030\n\nMUMBAI (ICIS)–Indian Oil Corp (IOC) plans to beef up its petrochemical production capacity to 14m tonnes/year by 2030 which will increase the state-owned company’s petrochemical intensity index (PII) to 15%, nearly triple its current level, company chair SM Vaidya said. Total petrochemical investments to reach Rs1.2 trillion Domestic industry projected to grow at 8-10% over the next few years Local demand estimated to hit $1 trillion by 2040 Petrochemical projects worth Indian rupees (Rs) 300 billion ($3.6 billion) are under various stages of implementation, while feasibility studies are ongoing on projects worth Rs900 billion, based on IOC’s annual report for the fiscal year ending March 2024. The company’s current petrochemical production capacity stands at 4.28 million tonnes/year, based on its annual report for the fiscal year ending March 2024. IOC’s PII refers to the percentage of crude oil that is directly converted into chemicals. “We are integrating petrochemicals into our refining operations,\" IOC chairman SM Vaidya said at the company’s annual general meeting on 9 August. \"This oil-to-chemical approach will enrich our value chain, meet rising petrochemical demand, reduce import reliance, and insulate the bottom line from the impacts of oil price fluctuations,\" he said. By 2026, its refining capacity will have increased by more than 25% from the current 70.3 million tonnes/year to 87.9 million tonnes/year, Vaidya said at IOC’s annual general meeting on 9 August. By the end of the decade, IOC expects its refining capacity to be 107.4 million tonnes/year, according to the annual report released on 18 July. “In 2023-24, we successfully commissioned the first phase of naphtha cracker expansion and paraxylene-purified terephthalic acid (PX-PTA) revamp project in Panipat and an ethylene glycol plant at Paradip. These have propelled our PII to 6.1%,” Vaidya said. In November 2023, IOC increased the capacity at the naphtha cracker at its Panipat refinery complex from 857,000 tonnes/year to 947,000 tonnes/year. Following the PX-PTA revamp at its Panipat refinery, IOC has increased its PX production to 460,000 tonnes/year and PTA output to 700,000 tonnes/year, as per the company website. In March 2024, the company inaugurated its 357,000 tonne/year monoethylene glycol (MEG) project at its Paradip refinery complex. PETROCHEMICAL PROJECT PIPELINE Indian Oil plans to commission a 150,000 tonne/year butyl acrylate plant at its Gujarat refinery in the current financial year 2024-25. One of the company’s ambitious petrochemical projects include the mega complex at Paradip in eastern Odisha state, Vaidya said, noting that the Rs610 billion project is IOC’s “largest ever investment at a single location”. The petrochemical complex will include a world-scale 1.5 milion tonne/year naphtha cracker unit along with downstream process units for producing polypropylene (PP), high density polyethylene (HDPE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The Paradip petrochemical project is currently in implementation stage and the company expects to commission it by August 2029, IOC said in its annual report released on 18 July. As part of its future expansions, IOC expects to begin operations at the 200,000 tonne/year PP plant at its Barauni refinery and 500,000 tonne/year PP line at its Gujarat refinery before end-March 2026, based on the company’s annual report. IOC has also enhanced its lube oil base stocks (LOBS) capacity at its Haldia complex and is setting up new plants at its Gujarat and Panipat refineries, Vaidya said, adding, “we aim to increase the capacity from 730,000 tonnes/year to 1.5 million tonnes/year”. The company expects to commission the 60,000 tonnes/year polybutadiene rubber (PBR) plant at its Panipat refinery by March 2025 as per the annual report. These planned expansions by IOC will help meet the rising petrochemical demand in the country, IOC stated in its latest annual report. The domestic petrochemical industry is \"poised for substantial growth, driven by India’s sturdy macro fundamentals, population expansion and presently low per capita polymer consumption,\" it said. India's overall petrochemical demand is projected to nearly triple by 2040, with the industry's value expected to reach the $1 trillion mark, said Indian minister for petroleum and natural gas Hardeep Singh Pur in a presentation at the Asia Petrochemical Industry Conference (APIC) in May 2023.

Meanwhile, oil prices surged by over $1/barrel in early Asian trade, fueled by escalating concerns about the spreading conflict in the Middle East. Japanese Nikkei 225 index jumps 9.55% in early Asian trade Asian petrochemical shares follow regional market rebound, Asahi Kasei gains China's petrochemical futures continue decline In Europe the main stock markets stabilized, opening slightly up before falling back. The UK’s FTSE 100 was down 0.08% at 11:20 London time, while Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 were 0.17% and 0.46% lower respectively. The stronger-than-expected US Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Services Survey for July helped ease growth worries. The overall services purchasing managers' index (PMI) improved to 51.4 in July, swinging into expansion and beating the consensus for a rise to 51.0 from 48.8 in June. A PMI reading above 50 indicates growth in the services sector. By 02:30 GMT, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was up 9.55%, South Korea's KOSPI was 3.07% higher and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rose by 0.06%. Singapore's Straits Times Index (STI) was down by 0.96% while China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index inched 0.20% higher after shedding 1.54% on Monday. Asian petrochemical shares tracked the rebound in regional bourses, with Japanese major Asahi Kasei jumping nearly 14% and South Korean producer LG Chem up by 4.59%. China’s petrochemical futures, however, continued lower in early trade on Tuesday. At 10:30 local time (02:30 GMT), futures of petrochemical commodities, including plastics, methanol and glycols, were trading lower, after losing 0.4-2.1% in the previous session.

This marked the largest losses since September 2022 for the Dow and S&P, following a downturn late last week due to poor US jobs data and weak manufacturing PMI, which sparked recession fears. The unwinding of the yen \"carry trade\" after the Bank of Japan raised interest rates last week also added fuel to the retreat in global markets.

Freight headache distracts from Europe’s PE, PP existential crisis Europe may be insulated from ballooning global supply of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) in the second half of 2024, as spiking Asian freight costs are the latest pain point to disrupt trade flows. Balanced to tight conditions could persist for Europe BD in H2 2024 European butadiene (BD) market fundamentals are likely to remain in a balanced to tight position for much of the remainder of 2024. Europe base oils Group II/Group III expectations heavily dependent on import logistics for H2 The European Group II and Group III outlooks for the second half of 2024 center strongly on imports, with several logistical issues across the globe throwing some uncertainty onto the markets. Europe H2 ethylene, propylene won't be a repeat of H2 2023, may be better than expected The second half of 2024 is looking brighter for Europe olefins markets compared to the same periods in 2022 and 2023. No demand crashes are expected, and there are several supportive factors that could make H2 2024 better than initially anticipated. Europe PVC uncertainty continues on weak demand, new antidumping charges on imports The European polyvinyl chloride (PVC) market faces a period of uncertainty in H2 2024, compounding the difficulties in long-term outlook since the coronavirus pandemic began in 2020, and only slightly mitigated by antidumping charges for US and Egyptian imports.\n\nIndia cuts MDI import duty; plans six-month review of overall tariff structure\n\nSINGAPORE (ICIS)–India will cut import duties for methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI) by 2.5 percentage points to 5.0% effective 24 July, with plans to review the country's overall tariff structure in the next six months. MDI was among raw materials identified by the Indian government on which custom duties will be reduced. India's finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the changes to the country's Basic Customs Duty (BCD) – a tax levied on imported goods at the time of their entry into the country – in her presentation of India’s national budget for the fiscal year ending March 2025 before parliament. HIGHER DUTIES FOR SOME PRODUCTSConversely, the minister said that the customs duty for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flex films/flex banners will be raised to 25% from 10% currently starting 24 July, \"to curb their imports\". Flex banners are commonly used for outdoor advertising as billboards. \"PVC flex banners are non-biodegradable and hazardous for environment and health,\" Sitharaman said. The customs duty on ammonium nitrate will also be raised to 10% from 7.5% from 24 July \"to support existing and new capacities in the pipeline\", she said. EXEMPTIONS FOR CRITICAL MINERALSSitharaman also proposed full exemption of 25 critical minerals from import duties, a cut in duty rates for two other products in the same category. \"Minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements are critical for sectors like nuclear energy, renewable energy, space, defense, telecommunications, and high-tech electronics,” she said. “This [cut in import duty] will provide a major fillip to the processing and refining of such minerals and help secure their availability for these strategic and important sectors,\" Sitharaman said. As for the electronics sector, the finance minister proposed to remove the BCD on oxygen-free copper for the manufacture of resistors. GOV'T TO REVIEW CUSTOMS DUTY STRUCTUREOver the next six months, the Indian government will conduct a thorough review of its customs duty rate structure, Sitharaman said. \"I propose to undertake a comprehensive review of the rate structure over the next six months to rationalise and simplify it for ease of trade, removal of duty inversion and reduction of disputes,\" she said. \"We will continue our efforts to simplify taxes, improve taxpayer services, provide tax certainty and reduce litigation while enhancing revenues for funding the development and welfare schemes of the government.\" It was not immediately clear how the revised BCD structure will impact implementation of import certifications of various chemicals under the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). BIS certification for some chemicals has been extended many times since they were introduced in 2019-20 to allow domestic end-user industries more time to adhere to the quality-control orders (QCO).

Flex banners are commonly used for outdoor advertising as billboards. \"PVC flex banners are non-biodegradable and hazardous for environment and health,\" Sitharaman said. For ammonium nitrate, the custom duty will be raised to 10% from 7.5% from 24 July \"to support existing and new capacities in the pipeline\", she said. (adds paragraphs 4-7)\n\nINSIGHT OUTLOOK: Next US president may upend EV policies, trade, regulations\n\nHOUSTON (ICIS)–The US election could see Donald Trump return as president with majorities in both legislative chambers, which could bring a reduction in excessive red tape, weaker support for electric vehicles (EVs) and impose even more ponderous tariffs and trade restrictions. Incumbent President Joe Biden has dropped out of the race, and current polls show Trump ahead in the election The House of Representatives and the Senate are closely split between the nation's two major parties, so the Republican party could obtain majorities in both legislative chambers Regardless of who wins the presidential election on 5 November, the outlook remains pessimistic for tariff relief and trade deals in the US US TRADE POLICY WILL REMAIN RESTRICTIVERegardless of who wins the presidential election, US trade policy will remain restrictive, which could leave the nation's chemical exports vulnerable to retaliatory tariffs imposed during a trade dispute. Also, tariffs could increase the cost of imports of critical chemical intermediates. Biden's campaign website did not discuss trade policy, and he recently dropped out of the race. But he maintained many of the tariffs that Trump introduced during his presidency in 2016-2020. In addition, Biden raised tariffs on EVs from China. He signed bills passed by Congress that required local content rules for government programs. Trump's platform proposed a baseline tariff, with the candidate mentioning 10% for most imports. For China, he mentioned tariffs of more than 60% during an interview on the television program Fox News. Trump's campaign website proposes a reciprocal trade act, under which the US could match tariffs that another country imposes on its exports. Although the platform concedes that reductions are possible, the proposal focuses on the potential of higher tariffs. TRUMP TO ROLL BACK BIDEN'S EV POLICIESBiden did not mention EVs on his campaign website. But during his presidential term, the federal government used multiple laws and regulatory statutes to promote EV adoption. If Trump becomes president, he has pledged to cancel what he calls the electric vehicle mandate. He specified many of Biden's policies that encouraged the adoption of EVs. EVs typically consume more plastics on a per unit basis than automobiles powered by internal combustion engines (ICEs). EVs also pose different material challenges, which is increasing demand for different plastics and compounds. Policies that prolong the use of ICE-based vehicles could extend the operating life of the nation's refineries. Companies could be more willing to invest in maintenance and repairs if they are confident that they could recoup their investments. Refineries produce many building block chemicals, such as propylene, benzene, toluene and mixed xylenes (MX). BIDEN, TRUMP PRESENT EXTREMES ON CHEM REGULATIONSBiden and Trump lay on opposite extremes of regulations and policy. Under Biden, the federal government has adopted numerous regulations, many of which the chemical industry has said provided them with little benefit given the time and expense of compliance. The past six months has been described as the worst regulatory environment that the chemical industry has ever seen. That burdensome regulatory climate could persist if a Democrat wins the election, since personnel from the Biden administration could remain in place. The following lists some of the regulatory policies that could either persist under a Democratic administration or weaken under a Trump administration: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has adopted a whole chemical approach in determining whether a substance poses an unreasonable risk under the nation's main chemical-safety program, known as the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The regulator is currently reviewing vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), acrylonitrile (ACN) and aniline, a feedstock used to make methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). Changes to the Clean Waters Act, the Risk Management Program (RMP) and the Hazard Communication Standard that were made by Biden. Biden has promoted environmental justice throughout the federal government. Environmental justice could make it harder for chemical companies to expand existing plants or build new ones. Because these are federal policies, a different president could reverse them. Trump could try to unravel some of Biden's rules to the degree possible under executive authority. However, some of the rules will persist because of entrenched bureaucracy or because they are final. The pace of new regulations would likely slow under a Trump presidency. He has pledged to restore his order that for every new regulation introduced by the federal government, two existing ones must be eliminated. OTHER POLICY DIFFERENCESSuperfund tax: If Trump wins the presidency and Republicans win the legislative branch, that could set up a repeal of the Superfund tax, which imposes taxes on several building-block chemicals and their derivatives. Republican legislators have already introduced bills to repeal the tax. Trump tax cuts: Trump has pledged that he would make his 2017 tax cuts permanent. These are set to expire at the end of 2025 from his previous term in 2016-2020. Oil production: Biden has imposed several restrictions on oil and gas production on federal land and on offshore leases, although this did not stop production from surging in the Permian Basin, much of which is outside of government control. Trump has pledged to remove those restrictions. Insight by Al Greenwood Thumbnail shows US capitol.

Spot deals this week have been reported at discounts of 32-35% on the pipeline, prior deals had been at discounts of around 38-39%. Producers say they have received several requests for additional volume offtakes in July. This is being attributed to a combination of factors: Improved sentiment from domestic PVC players following the imposition of tariffs on imports ex-Egypt and the US Continued high container freight rates which are restricting some derivative imports Recent hurricane-related production and logistics disruptions ex-US Firmer month-on-month naphtha values which is likely to drive discussions for the August contract reference price settlement Planned cracker maintenance due to get underway from September particularly that due in Germany with alternative supply flexibility likely to be limited at that time due to pressure issues on the ARG pipeline. With crackers having been run at rates closely aligned with contractual demand – still very much below normal albeit better than in 2023 – there is not too much flexibility for additional volumes at short notice. “Many will have assumed that ethylene supply would always be plentiful,” a source said, “and now they find that it is not the case.” Cracker operators have avoided as far as possible marginal tonne production as spot appetite has been extremely low unless at deep discounts to the prevailing contract price. Crackers are underutilised, so in theory, there is space to ramp up. But with August around the corner and few indications at this stage how long this better-than-expected demand will be sustained, sources assume producers will be reluctant to ramp up production in July.
