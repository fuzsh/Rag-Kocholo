        "text": "Benguela, Angola, July 25, 2024 (Lusa) - Portugal's prime minister said on Thursday that the internationalisation of Portuguese companies is a \"locomotive of the national economy\" after literally blowing the whistle on a train at the port of Lobito in Benguela province. After a busy morning in Benguela province, as part of his three-day official visit to Angola, which ends today, Luís Montenegro spoke to journalists at the ore terminal in the port of Lobito, one of the infrastructures that make up the Lobito Corridor, the country's most emblematic development project.\n\nHere, alongside the Angolan authorities and representatives of the consortium with the 30-year concession for the project - which includes Portugal's Mota-Engil - in a symbolic act, Luís Montenegro sounded three loud whistles on a locomotive on the railway line and wanted to draw parallels with the Portuguese economy.\n\n‘I had the opportunity to get the locomotive whistling and to prove that the internationalisation of our companies is the engine of our economy. We want a strong economy in Portugal. We want an economy with an export vocation,’ he said.\n\nThe prime minister said that his visit ‘has made me even more aware of the many opportunities’ that can be shared between ‘the two countries, the two peoples, the two governments’ in deepening bilateral relations.\n\nWithin this deepening, Montenegro considered that the economic aspect ‘is essential’ to bring ‘well-being to people's lives, whether Angolans and Portuguese living in Angola, or Portuguese and Angolans living in Portugal’.\n\nAsked why he dedicated almost a day of his trip to Angola to the province of Benguela, the prime minister said that this was the result of a conversation with the president of Angola, João Lourenço, who invited him to visit the country on the occasion of his trip to Portugal for the 50th anniversary of 25 April.\n\n‘President João Lourenço suggested to me that one of the regions in which we could, on the one hand, project the future of Angola and, on the other hand, I could understand how far we have the capacity in our companies to contribute to this path, was precisely the province of Benguela and this Benguela-Lobito link, the Lobito corridor, which is a fundamental logistics project in this region and which has an absolutely extraordinary impact and, by the way, also has Portuguese participation in its own history,’ he explained.\n\nWith funding from the United States and the European Union, the Lobito Corridor links the provinces of Benguela, Huambo, Bié and Moxico. It includes the infrastructure of the port of Lobito, the Mining Terminal, Catumbela airport and the Benguela Railway, extending the link to the Copperbelt mining areas in Zambia and Katanga in the Democratic Republic of Congo, promoting the faster export of cobalt, copper and other minerals from these countries.\n\nThe prime minister arrived in Benguela province at 9 a.m. today on board a plane from the Republic of Angola and was greeted by a traditional African dance group, as at various points on the agenda throughout the morning.\n\nWithout a tie, Montenegro then had a brief meeting with the governor of this province, Luís Nunes, and the delegation continued on foot to visit the future facilities of the Consulate General in this city. This project should be completed by August 2025, at an estimated cost of over €2 million.\n\n‘We'll be back for the inauguration,’ the prime minister promised.\n\nHe then visited the Biópio photovoltaic plant, inaugurated in July 2022, which has become the largest solar energy project in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe project was carried out by a consortium between the US company Sun Africa and the Portuguese company MCA, with the latter handling the engineering and construction component.\n\nThis plant is part of a group of seven parks in various provinces of Angola, which, when operational, will supply clean, renewable energy to around 2.4 million Angolans, contributing to an annual reduction in polluting emissions of around one million tonnes of carbon dioxide.\n\nLuís Montenegro will return to Luanda in the late afternoon, where he will receive military honours at the farewell ceremony at the Presidential Palace, with a meeting with the press and a dinner hosted by the Portuguese ambassador in Luanda, Francisco Alegre Duarte, before flying to Lisbon in the evening, where he will arrive in the early hours of Friday morning.\n\nSMA/ADB // ADB.\n\nLusa"
