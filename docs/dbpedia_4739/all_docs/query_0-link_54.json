        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Shares in the Africa-focused unit of Portugal's largest builder Mota-Engil made their market debut in Amsterdam, after the group gave out a fifth of the unit's stock to investors and then arranged the listing so the shares could be traded. Shares in Mota-Engil Africa, which operates in 10 countries including Angola, Malawi and Mozambique, changed hands at 10.18 euros by 1136 GMT on Monday, against a \"reference\" price of 11.50 previously set by the company and an Amsterdam AEX index that was slightly up. The company, whose recent projects include being part of a consortium building a bridge over the Zambeze river in the city of Tete in Mozambique, gained a stock market value of 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion) in a listing also intended to give it better access to capital markets and a more diversified investor base. Moto-Engil Africa had planned a flotation in London but this was abandoned in July due to deteriorating sentiment around Portuguese stocks following the crisis around Banco Espirito Santo, rescued by the state in August. Moto had in 2013 given out 20 million shares of the Africa unit, representing 20 percent of the latter's share capital. The company is the second emerging market construction conglomerate to list on Euronext Amsterdam in as many years after Egypt's much larger OCI moved its primary listing from Cairo at the beginning this year. Many international investors choose the Netherlands as a base for companies because of its record of favourable tax treatment of countries which maintain headquarters in the country while keeping the bulk of their activities elsewhere.
