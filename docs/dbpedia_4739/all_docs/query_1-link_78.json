        "text": "Jorge Coelho, António Mota e Gonçalo Moura Martins\n\nJorge Coelho, a man of worth\n\nBy Luís Osório\n\nThis was a man who stood out from the majority. I knew him superficially, lightly, mostly just in passing. But when we did meet, he would embrace me as if friends – he would ask about my things, wanting to know the details, commenting on some text, some book or political or business theme that interrelated. I’m still somewhat shocked that he left in such a manner. Without any warning, exactly like his father sixty years earlier, a sudden stroke, heart attack or something of that type.\n\nHe left in a rush but three things remain behind: each with sufficient strength to live on after his death.\n\nFirstly, the detachment and the courage. At the time of the collapse of the Entre-os-Rios bridge, on 4 March 2001, Jorge Coelho was the minister responsible for public works. And it was he, just hours after the tragedy had happened, resigned as minister because the “guilt could not be left to die alone”. He took on the political and government responsibility for the accident and the death of those 59 persons. He was one of few politicians to do so and especially in the way he acted. António Guterres attempted to demote him. It was only natural that he would do so – I myself would have attempted to do this if I were in his position. He was the minister responsible for public works but it would not have made sense to assume the responsibility on account of being unfairly marked long into the future. But he did so and took that responsibility. One day, I recalled asking him about it. And Jorge told me that he would not be able to sleep had he not done so.\n\nFew would have been capable of doing so. He did it.\n\nSecondly, for never having betrayed his roots and origins. He rose in life, reached the top in politics, in business and in the influence he exercised with his intuitive intelligence and disarming sense of humour but while never turning his back on the place of his birth. He was from Beira Alta and loved Mangualde. And, in recent years, he returned to the land to set up a cheese business. He wanted to do a little of what Commander Nabeiro has done for Campo Maior, retributing to his own what the land had given him. In a time when so many reject their own origins, Jorge did not do so. He did not do so when he arrived in Lisbon to attend university at ISEG. He did not do so when gaining experience in Macau. He did not do so when he was an MP nor when he was minister. He did not do so when he began sitting at the tables of the powerful. He did not do so when he went into business and made money.\n\nFew would not have forgotten the place of their birth. He did not do so."
