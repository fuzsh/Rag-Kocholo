The operation has already been approved by the Portuguese stock market commission CMVM.\n\n“The Mota-Engil 2026 bonds will be issued on 2 December 2021. 150,000 bonds will be issued at a nominal unitary value of €500 and a total amount of €75 million which could be increased by option of the issuer.\n\nMota-Engil 2026 bonds have a 5-year maturity from the date of issue. The first €250 will be reimbursed on 2 December 2025 and the second €250 on 2 December 2026. The gross nominal annual rate will be taxed at the tax rate in force on maturity.\n\nMota-Engil, which has a substantial Chinese shareholding, aims to make around €3.8Bn in turnover in 2026."
