We are extremely proud to contribute to the Portuguese Economy,\" said the CEO of the Investment Bank, which until last year, was formly BESI.\n\n\"Haitong Bank initiated contacts and presented the Yildirim Group of Turkey to the Mota-Engil Group and was the financial advisor to Mota-Engil and Novo Banco,\" Ricciardi affirmed, adding that former BESI is now a \"Portuguese-Chinese Bank, headquartered in Lisbon, Portugal and with a greater capacity and global reach, thanks to the new shareholder, Haitong.\"\n\nOn Friday, Mota-Engil completed the sale to the Yildirim Group of their port and logistics business, for 245 million euros. The amount was 30 million lower than expected, due to not having yet completed the renegotiation of the “Concessão do Terminal de Contentores de Leixões”.\n\nBesides Haitong Bank, other participates in the operation were the law firms - “Albuquerque e Associados” and Erdem & Erdem as buyer representation. On the side of the sellers were “Vieira de Almeida & Associados” and “CSA”."
