        "text": "At least 500 jobs are at stake following a decision by Portuguese multi-disciplinary conglomerate Mota-Engil Malawi to scale down operations at its Mkwinda Camp near Zalewa Trading Centre in Neno District.\n\nBut in a written response yesterday, Mota-Engil Malawi communications manager Thomas Chafunya could neither confirm nor deny the reports.\n\nHe said if there is any decision to this effect the public will be informed accordingly.\n\nSaid Chafunya: “People are currently on holiday until early next month. If there is any decision to that effect and for public interest, management will communicate. At the moment, I would not want to be drawn to comment further.”\n\nBut one of the employees at the camp said their employment status is well known as the company is on the verge of closing the camp.\n\nThe source said the camp was established primarily for the Moatize-Mwanza-Liwonde-Nacala rail project and Mota-Engil completed construction of the $1 billion-plus railway line.\n\nAnother employee confided that due to a slow down in business their contract terms were reduced from 12 months to three months and that by November, they were supposed to get the new contracts.\n\nShe said: “We did not get the contracts and we were told to leave for our homes. Most of us left and may only return if there is communication suggesting otherwise.”\n\nFor close to 10 years, Mota-Engil has provided direct employment to about 500 people and indirectly to hundreds others around Zalewa that led to the booming of businesses such as shops, restaurants, lodges and bars.\n\nMota-Engil previously dominated public construction contracts in Malawi, but in recent years Chinese firms are taking over most construction tenders in Malawi."
