        "text": "Mota-Engil, leader in Portugal with a consolidated position in the ranks of the 25 largest European construction groups, is already well established in 13 countries on the African continent. With this new construction, which will be located 28 km away from Kigali capital city, Mota-Engil should consolidate its expansion in Africa.\n\nBugesera International Airport is expected to start handling 1.7 million passengers a year to reach 3 million passengers by 2030. The new airport will serve as a world-class gateway to Rwanda, with the potential to become a key hub for airlines operating to and from the regional airports of Rwanda and other neighboring East African nations. The national airline, RwandAir, has already planned to open new routes including the United States of America, Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola.\n\nThanks to this important project, Rwanda should benefit from a rebound in tourism and business travel, thus allowing a growth from 150 to 800 million dollars revenue in 7 years that will benefit all sectors and finally enhance the life of the inhabitants by creating thousands of jobs."
