        "text": "Today, on December 1, 2023, the Global African Business Association (GABA), under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer, Rerhi Onomake is honoring the legendary and epic Director General of the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Victoria Akai, on her birthday today. Under her direction as the Director General of the Abuja Chamber of Commerce and Industry has become a major player on the international stage, and she has given GABA much-needed exposure in Nigeria and has made our team relevant in global strategic discussions here in the U.S. Therefore, we want to be very clear about what we are saying about Victoria at this point. If you don’t know her..get to know her because she is our gateway into doing business in Nigeria. Victoria has proven to be a leader and change agent with responsibility, honesty, and the trust of the people—not just to Nigeria, the United States, the European Union, or Turkey, but also to the rest of the continent and the world community. And for that we honor and salute you. She has shown leadership in supporting our female-owned small and medium-sized businesses by facilitating access to the worldwide market for their textile and food products. And for that we honor and salute you. We want to reassure you that we will be there for you every step of the way as you get ready to go on to the following phases and levels in 2024. You have shown such perseverance in changing not just the way Nigerians do business but also setting the country up for export to other countries. And for that we honor and salute you. We want to support you in realizing that the moment has come for you to broaden your business into ever-evolving international markets. Remember that you will be put to the test in terms of your knowledge, vision, integrity, and most importantly, accountability. Nevertheless, know that we are here to support you through it all. 2024 is your period of total evolution. As you begin to transform the spirit of those in boardrooms where people will be making decisions to impact the global market for the next 50 years your name will be shared and spoken of in rooms you are not even present to not only seal deals but also transform the lives of children who are not yet born. That’s your power. That's your future. That’s your legacy. Join me in celebrating her today."
