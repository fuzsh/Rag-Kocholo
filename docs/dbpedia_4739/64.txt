The crisis that engulfed one of Portugal’s biggest banks yesterday claimed another scalp this morning after Mota-Engil Africa, a subsidiary of a Portuguese conglomerate pulled listing plans.

The Sub-Saharan construction group was planning to float shares on London’s main market to fund an expansion plan.

Unfortunately for the company, its chosen joint bookrunner was Espirito Santo, which had its shares suspended after crashing by 17pc in Lisbon and has triggered a sharp fall across European bourses.

“[The float] couldn’t have been at a worse time – investor demand supported the listing price but it was seen as not the right thing from a mindset point”, one source said.

Institutional investors are understood to have withdrew their orders for the float which led the book to unravel.

"Due to the recent significant deterioration in market conditions and the resultant impact on investor sentiment, the company, its selling shareholder and its advisors have decided not to proceed with the IPO of Mota-Engil Africa at this time. Events and the performance of equity markets in the last 48 hours meant that the scale of orders was negatively impacted", Mota-Engil said in a statement.

Another person called the situation a perfect storm for the IPO as Espirito Santo also has significant exposure to Africa.

Portugal’s biggest builder Mota-Engil SGPS would have also owned a 70pc stake in the company after flotating which was not welcomed by investors after Thursday's events.
