        "text": "Next Article\n\nSince 1998 and the post-Suharto reformation era, efforts have been made to accommodate the rights of minorities in Indonesia. People are more open to diversity and tolerant of minorities. Members of minority groups are given more space to participate in politics, and to practice their beliefs or customs. They have more freedom to express themselves; however, this does not mean that there are no longer issues.\n\nIncidents of discrimination against members of minority groups still occur, regardless of the constitution's clear prohibition of such conduct.88 Examples include the rejection of a non-Muslim family’s request to reside in Bantul; discrimination against Papuan students in Surabaya; church bombings; and violence against Shia Islam, the Ahmadiyya movement, and other belief systems. Indonesians of Chinese descent still face many hurdles. During the 2017 Jakarta gubernatorial elections, Jakarta's first non-Muslim governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama (“Ahok”), was repeatedly targeted by Muslim radicals for being Christian and of Chinese descent. This included allegations of him mocking the Qur'an.89 With regards the criminalization of gender and minority sexual identities, a case in Tulungagung, East Java, highlighted that law enforcement deliberately targeted gender and sexual minorities. 90 In addition, media coverage on gender and sexual minorities appears vulgar, tendentious, and biased.\n\n91\n\nThe 2013 Curriculum examined in this report shows serious efforts to address the inclusion of minorities in Indonesia. The textbooks’ anti-discrimination discourse is mainly limited to ethnicity (Chinese, ethnicities of eastern Indonesia) and religion, with scant discussion of local religions and unrecognized religions such as Shiism and Ahmadiyya, both of which are Islamic sects.\n\nIn primary and junior high English textbooks, those most prominently featured include: students of Chinese descent; students from eastern Indonesia; a girl wearing a hijab; and students belonging to the six majorreligions covered in schools. Every primaryschool textbook contains a pagewhich introduces students from these diverse backgrounds.\n\n88 See, Article 28D and 28I of the 1945 Constitution and Article 3 section 3 of Law Number 39 of 1999 concerning Human Rights regulates protection for the minorities. The Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia, https://jdih.bapeten.go.id/unggah/dokumen/peraturan/116-full.pdf. 89 BBC Monitoring, \"Basuki Tjahaja Purnama: Jakarta's Governor,\" BBC, May 19, 2017, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-37872151. 90 Markahi, “Cegah Kriminalisasi Kelompok Minoritas Gender dan Seksualitas”.

Students learn that the children featured are from different regions of Indonesia, and hold differing beliefs. For example, Dayu is a Hindu from Bali; Edo is from eastern Indonesia; Meli and Lani are of Chinese descent; and Siti is a Muslim. These children are shown to happily work, play, and learn together; this highlights that diversity is , and demonstrates that students can live in harmony with those who are different. are always featured to happily work, play, and learn together. It points out that diversity is ubiquitous and sets an example of living in harmony with those who are different.\n\nCaring for Animals and Plants, Grade 2, 2017, pp. v, 150.\n\nOne of the materials in the Grade 1 textbook, which presents pictures of students of multiple ethnicities wearing their traditional clothing, teaches that diversity is God’s grace to be grateful for.\n\nBeing Grateful for Difference\n\nLook at Udin and his friends. They are all different. They have physical differences. They have personality differences. They also have cultural differences. There are many other differences, But they remain friends. Everyone is special. Difference is God's grace. We must be grateful for it. Myself, Grade 1, 2018, p. 116\n\nThe national motto, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, is used to teach students that diversity is beautiful, and that they should not be afraid to be different. They also learn that unity and acceptance are important in a diverse society; and that if they are not united nor do they accept others who are different, they will have a difficult life because, as human beings, they need others, and cannot live on their own. Students thus learn that if they are united and accept one other, they will be able to work together to pursue common goals. Local wisdoms offered as an example of unity are mutual cooperation (gotong royong), and community night patrols (ronda).\n\n1. The Beauty of Life in a Diverse Society\n\nPlease look at the symbol of our country, the Garuda. Look at the ribbon he's gripping. On the ribbon, the words “Bhinneka Tunggal Ika” are written. The sentence was taken from the Sutasoma Book, written by Mpu Tantular, which means “Unity-in-Diversity.” These words were interpreted in a broader meaning, and became the motto of Indonesia. The motto that binds diversity into a solid unity. Is it enough for you just to understand the meaning? Definitely not. After you understand the meaning of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, you have to implement it in your daily life. When you hang out with your friends, you will encounter diversity. You will differ from your friends. Maybe you and your friends have differences in intelligence, skills, hobbies, body size, skin color, habits, even ethnicity, class, culture, and religion. Then, how should you behave?\n\nApplication of the values of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika doesn't mean you imitate your friends or other people, to look similar. You don't have to be like everyone else. Let yourself be different from others and let others be different from yourself. You have to realize that difference is a gift from God Almighty that we should be grateful for. Thus you don't have to disagree just because of differences. You have to be grateful for differences by respecting and appreciating your friends. In that way, differences actually make life more beautiful.\n\n2. The Beauty of Living United in Diversity\n\nYou can't live alone and need support from others. Likewise, you can also support each other. By helping each other in the community, life will feel safe, comfortable, and peaceful. For instance, in public security fields. Maintaining public security requires carrying out patrols on schedule. Everyone has the same obligations, regardless of whether they are rich or poor, regardless of ethnicity or religion. Therefore, security and order will be created in society. That is one of the important meanings of unity in diversity. To maintain public security, every member of the community is required to carry out patrols according to the schedule.\n\nWhat will happen if there is no unity in society? Without unity, harmony in society is difficult to achieve. Everyone will live selfishly. Between people, mutual suspicion will arise. Life will not be comfortable. One of the tangible manifestations of harmony and unity in society is the tradition of gotong royong. For instance, working together to build a house. Gotong royong involves all elements of society. Events in Life, Grade 5, 2017, pp. 104-106.\n\nGrade 5 students learning the same motto, Bhinneka Tunggal Ika, as an introduction to Indonesia’s diverse society. They are then asked to reflect on their attitude toward diversity.\n\nTHEME 7\n\nThe Beauty of Diversity in My Country Bhinneka Tunggal Ika. Have you heard that sentence? Yes, that sentence is found in Garuda Pancasila. Garuda Pancasila is the symbol of our country. Bhinneka Tunggal Ika means different, yet one.\n\nThe phrase “Bhinneka Tunggal Ika” is found in a book titled Sutasoma, written by Mpu Tantular. Mpu Tantular lived during the Majapahit Kingdom around the 14th century. In Sutasoma, the notion of Bhinneka Tunggal Ika is used more to emphasize the diversity of religions and beliefs among the people of Majapahit. What differences are there in Indonesia?\n\nWhat is your attitude toward differences in Indonesia?\n\nThe Beauty of Diversity in My Country, Grade 4, 2017, p. vi.\n\nA lesson from a Grade 11 Indonesian History textbook teaches students that unity-in-diversity is crucial in the struggle to gain independence.\n\nUnity and oneness are very important values in every form of struggle. All existing organizations or forces, even with different understandings/ideologies, remained united in facing colonialists to achieve independence. During the disarmament against Japan, the war against the Allies and the Dutch, all members of the Indonesian army, various troop members, and the people, were united. Indonesian History, Grade 11, 2017, p. 208.\n\nStudents are introduced to another form of diversity they experience in class, by presenting the example of students of differing intelligence. The text also encourages students to value and respect different abilities in every person.\n\nRead it out loud!\n\nThe Secret of Smart Children Every child in your class is smart and kind. Some children are good at sports or dancing. Some are good at mathematics or languages. Some are good at singing or good at befriending everyone. Can you be smart without trying? All children want to be smart, but they do not know how. If you want to be smart, here's the secret. Listen as the teacher explains. Do the tasks on time. Read a lot and practice. Do not give up easily. Ask your teacher. Manage your study time well. In addition, make friends with lots of people. My Duties and Rights, Grade 3, 2018, p. 48.\n\nThe following excerpts from Grade 7 Art and Culture explain that cultural diversity can serve as one of the creative economic pillars to achieve prosperity for the community. The creative economy is an economic concept that emphasizes creativity to increase the economic value of an idea, such as in the fashion industry, film, advertising, video animation, photography, crafts, etc92 .\n\nThe performing art of traditional music can also be used as a pillar of the creative economy, so that it can improve the welfare of the respective community. Art and Culture, Grade 7, 2017, p. 159.\n\nThe development and preservation of dance can serve as a creative economy. The development of the art of dance preserves the function of dance, so that it does not harm the dance, but gives added value to the supporting community. Art and Culture, Grade 7, 2017, p. 189.\n\nCultural heritage in the form of stories or legends can serve as one of the pillars of a creative economy so as to bring prosperity to the respective community. The image following the text suggests the inclusion of the disabled in developing cultural heritage as a creative economy pillar. Art and Culture, Grade 7, 2017, p. 210.\n\n92 Shaid, N.

The following excerpts provide examples of how students can interact with those of different religions and cultures, from the Konferensi Berteman dalam Keragaman (Conference of Friendship and Diversity).\n\nConference of Friendship in Diversity\n\nJakarta 14-18 October 2003\n\nI. About Religious Diversity We understand:\n\n• Religious diversity should not be used as a reason for fighting and divisions. • Greet, smileat, and be fair to everyone even though they belong to different religions. • Religion teaches goodness. • Religious diversity is a gift from God because that is where we can complete, share, and help each other. Accordingly: • At home we can: Share stories about religious diversity with brothers, sisters, fathers, and mothers. » Strengthen faith by practicing our worship in the best possible way. » Believe continually in the religion we believe in, and stay tolerant of other religions to maintain interfaith unity.\n\n• At school we can: » It doesn't matter what religion your friends follow. » Don't fight just because of religion. » Provide opportunities for friends to pray. Say hello and smile at all friends, even though they are of different religions. » Reconcile friends who are in conflict because of religious differences. » Make friends with anyone, even if they have different religious background.\n\nII. About Cultural Diversity\n\nWe Understand: • Indonesia has multiple diverse ethnicities and cultures. • Every culture has its own characteristics. • Every region has traditional weapons, traditional houses, dances, clothes, games, and food that we must appreciate and respect. • Our knowledge of other people's cultures is still very limited. • We do not have a lot of knowledge on the local culture itself.\n\nWe acknowledge an existing problem\n\n• People prefer to be proud of their own area. • People often feel their culture is the best. • People often feel that their local regions have advantages over others. In fact, variety is beautiful, because if all areas were the same, it would not be interesting.\n\nAccordingly:\n\n• At home we can:\n\n» Learn and play with friends and pen pals of all backgrounds. » Practice various dances, such as the Kecak, Gending Sriwijaya, Baris dance, Serimpi. Learn with your father, mother, sister, or brother through radio, TV, and books. » Invite neighbors to play congklak (mancala), hide and seek, hopscotch, on stilts, gobak sodor, and other games. » Invite friends who have just moved from other areas to tell stories and play together. • Invite friends with disabilities to play and learn.\n\nAt school we can:\n\n• Ask friends not to have a negative reaction to other cultures. • Borrow books from the library about various cultures. • Read regional stories and play with friends. • Invite friends to say hello and play with new friends. Events in Life, Grade 5, 2017, pp. 145 – 146\n\nAs part of teachings on living in harmony with friends, the exercise below asks students to identify the benefits of being united with friends and the consequences of not being united with friends.\n\nLet’s Discuss Do you know the benefits of uniting with friends? What are the consequences of not being united with friends? Complete the following exercise!\n\nI have many friends I cannot share experiences with friends Getting work done quickly I can share experiences with friends Work cannot be done quickly I am hated by friends\n\nBenefits of living in unity with friends Consequences of not living in unity with friends\n\nExplain your work to your friends. What are the benefits of living in unity with friends? What are the consequences of not living in unity with friends? Clean and Healthy Living, Grade 2, 2017, pp. 201-202.\n\nAs citizens of a diverse Indonesia, students are encouraged to respond to the diversity around them accordingly. The excerpt below teaches students how to respect people of different religions and cultures.\n\nSubtheme 3:\n\nThe Beauty of Unity and Integration of My Country\n\nYou already know the diversity of ethnic groups and cultures in Indonesia. How do you respond to this diversity?\n\nLet's Read\n\nRead the following text silently!\n\nIn Order to Remain in Harmony, Let's Adopt this Attitude The Republic of Indonesia has a diversity of customs, cultures, and religions. The customs and culture of each region are unique, and different from other regions. There are various religions followed by the population. With these differences, how can we maintain the unity of the nation? Now, to maintain the unity of the nation and to keep it in harmony, let's adopt these attitudes. One of the attitudes that must be adoptedis tolerance and mutual respect in worship. How is it embodied? One of its manifestations is that we should not insult friends of different religions. Figure 3.1 Religious diversity in Indonesia.\n\nAlso, when our friends are worshiping, we must not disturb them. Another attitude that must be adopted is to respect the cultures of the various regions in Indonesia. Our country is rich in various regional cultures. We can be proud of our own local culture. However, we must also respect and participate in preserving the culture of other regions. So, in order to maintain the unity and integration of the Republic of Indonesia, what is our attitude? We must value, respect, and love other people even if they have different religions, ethnicities, and cultures. These are the attitudes we should always instill in ourselves. (Source: http://kidnesia.com/Boleh-Tahu/Serba-Serbi/So-Tetap-Rukun-HindariSikap-Ini-Yuk Download September 24, 2016). The Beauty of Diversity in My Country, Grade 4, 2017, pp. 91-92.\n\nAkeyexample of respecting different religions was demonstrated by the nation’s founding fathers. They decided to pause a meeting held during Ramadan, in order to allow the Muslims to pray, and for those who did not fast to eat have lunch.\n\nThe meeting was continued by discussing chapter by chapter, article by article. This discussion was also quite productive,and went smoothly. At that time, it was already 13.50. The meeting was stopped for a break until 15.00 to provide prayer time for Muslims, and a lunch break for those who were not fasting. Indonesian History, Grade 11, Semester 2, 2017, p. 107.\n\nThe following section introduces the theme of tolerance to Grade 4 students, and how to practice it amid religious, ethnic, racial, and socio-cultural differences. In addition, the text provides lists of practical behaviors students can implement in their daily lives.\n\nLet's Read\n\nTolerance of Diversity Tolerance comes from the Latin word tolerare, which means patiently letting something go. Tolerance can be interpreted as an open behavior that respects all differences that exist among fellow human beings. Tolerance means being patient, showing restraint, and appreciating and being generous with people who have different opinions. The following is a form of tolerance toward ethnic, cultural, religious, racial, and gender diversity: 1. Tolerance in Religious Diversity Freedom of religion is guaranteed in the Constitution of the State of the Republic of Indonesia of 1945, in particular Article 29 paragraph (2) which reads: “The State guarantees the independence of every citizen to embrace their own religion, and to worship according to their religion and belief.” With the guarantee of religious freedom, all Indonesian citizens should develop an attitude of tolerance among religious believers. The attitude of tolerance among religious believers can be shown through the following forms of action: a. Do not insult the religion that other people believe in. b. Do not impose religion on others. c. Respect the religion that other people believe in. d. Worship properly according to the teachings of your religion. e. Respect and cooperation among religious people. f. Give followers of other religions the chance to worship. g. Maintaining inter-religious harmony, intra-religious harmony, as well as between religious communities and the government.”\n\n2. Tolerance of Ethnic and Racial Diversity Indonesia consists of various ethnic groups and races. Each ethnic group has characteristics that distinguish it from other ethnic groups. An ethnic characteristic that is based on physical characteristics is called race. Consequently, every ethnicity has its own race. It results in race diversity. We must respect and tolerate diversity. Why? It is because various ethnicities and races in Indonesia are basically one nation, Indonesia. Tolerance of ethnicities and races is expected in order to establish national unity and integrity, and strengthen the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia.\n\nWe can show tolerance for ethnic and racial diversities through a good attitude and behavior toward anyone, regardless of ethnicity and race. Besides, we value and respect the dignity of every human being by developing the spirit of brotherhood, and upholding human values. In our daily interactions, we must accept other countries' ethnicities and races.\n\nFigure 3.23, Getting together with friends despite ethnic differences 3. Tolerance in Socio-Cultural Diversity\n\nIndonesia consists of various regions. Each area is inhabited by Indonesian people who have their own social and cultural life. Therefore, in Indonesia there is sociocultural diversity. Socio-cultural diversity is an invaluable richness of the Indonesian people, and has been inherited by our ancestors from ancient times.\n\nWe, as the nation's next generation, should always respect, preserve, and develop various forms of Indonesian social and cultural heritage. How? Of course, by being tolerant in order to maintain socio-cultural diversity in the form of actions such as the following:\n\nFigure 3.24, Regional dances as a form of pride\n\na. Be proud of the local culture. b. Be selective when adopting foreign cultures that enter Indonesia. c. Get to know and always look for information on the cultural diversity of Indonesia.\n\nd. Respect other groups who practice their social customs. e. Appreciate the cultural products of other ethnic groups. f. Study and master the nation’s cultural arts, according to their interests. g. Preserve and develop various types of traditional arts such as dance, music, and performing arts. The Beauty of Diversity in My Country, Grade 4, 2017, pp. 121-123.\n\nGender Diversity\n\nGender equality is discussed in some textbooks, including religious education. In other subjects, equality between men and women is presented in more indirect ways, such as explaining that women can do traditionally male work, and vice versa. Some pictures also depict men doing traditionally female work, such as sweeping the floor, doing household chores, etc.\n\nMost materials adopt binary gender roles and sexual orientations, with the exception of Hindu education and Character Education Grade 1, which state that Hinduism accepts a third gender –effeminate individuals. There is no specific discussion on gender and sexual orientation, except for a story in the Qur’an about the city of Sodom, whose inhabitants were punished by God due to their engagement in homosexual acts; and a discussion on how Muslim students view transgender individuals. In Indonesia, many people view LGBT individuals negatively, resulting in a lack of acceptance of the community. In addition, most textbooks promote the concept of a traditional\n\nfamily unit consisting of a father, a mother, and a child or several children. There is no reference to single-parent or same-sex families. Women are viewed as more accountable for something negative happening to them and for educating children, especially in passing down local languages. An example is a passage about hymen in the Natural Science book grade 9. The passage holds women accountable to take care of their hymen by avoiding dangerous activities, including disgraceful acts that are against the norms, without any further explanation that hymen can be torn because of various other reasons. Another example is the passing down of a local language. It is said to be the responsibility of parents, but mothers are more responsible for not teaching it to the children without further explanation.\n\nThe lessonbelow discusses the creation of Adam and Eveandthe example of Jesus’s fair treatment of a woman who committed adultery, to highlight the importance of gender equality.\n\nWith regards gender equality, the Bible also teaches us that men and women are equal in the eyes of God. The story of creation in Genesis 2:18 states, “The Lord God said, ‘It is not good for man to be alone. I will make a helper for him, proportional to him.’” This story describes how God decided to create Eve. God saw that Adam was unhappy living alone. Even the animals that God created did not make him happy. He needs a proportional helper. Proportional means equal. If Eve turned out to be weaker than Adam, there would be no way she could be a proportional helper. Eve certainly had various skills and abilities that Adam did not have, so that she could really be a proportional partner for Adam.\n\nThe Lord Jesus Himself treated men and women equally. When Mary sat down at His feet to listen to His teaching, and Martha protested that Mary did not help her in the kitchen, the Lord Jesus said, “Mary has chosen the best part, which will not be taken from her” (Luke 10:42). Jesus did not forbid women from listening to and learning about the Lord’s word – something that was very taboo for women at that time. In John 8:1-11 the Jews brought a woman caught in the act ofadultery to Jesus. In Jewish culture, if a woman commits adultery, she must be stoned, but the man is not punished. Jesus did not punish the woman not because her actions were justified, but because the punishment was unfair to women. In adultery, the man and woman who commit it should be punished equally. This injustice can be called gender discrimination.\n\nUnfortunately, gender discrimination still persists, even among churches today. There are still women who cannot be leaders in the church – whether as elders, deacons, or pastors. In fact, their abilities are no less than that of men. A number of churches in Indonesia have had women as their leaders, such as synod chairperson, deputy chairperson, or secretary, and other important positions in church synods. Christianity and Character Education, Grade 10, 2016, pp. 141‒42.\n\nThe Grade 9 Christianity and Character Education book explores female leadership in the Church. The text explains that even though many churches have accepted female leaders, some churches argue that women cannot lead churches, using verses from the Bible to justify their views.\n\n1. Women Leadership\n\nMany churches now recognize women as their leaders. Recently, the Anglican Church in England took the decision to allow women to become bishops. However, there are still churches that have not been able to accept women as their pastors. To support the claim that women are unfit to be church leaders, some Christian leaders have tried to find theological reasons. Some say women should not be pastors because Jesus only called men to be His disciples. As leaders of worship, pastors stand as representatives of Jesus. Because Jesus was a man, only men were the most appropriate to stand as representatives of Jesus in the service. Others quote Paul’s words in 1 Corinthians 14:34:\n\nAs in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission, as the Law says,\n\nAnother verse that is also often used to reject women as priests is 1 Timothy 2:11–12: “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.” Christianity and Character Education, Grade 9, 2017 Page 85.\n\nChristianity’s openness toward women is also discussed in the Grade 10 Christianity and Character Education book. In addition to the acceptance of female leadership in churches, the following example presents several biblical verses which demonstrate women’s role in spreading the Gospel.\n\n2. Openness to Women\n\nThe openness that occurred in the church was not limited to the presence of other nations. We also see the presence of women in activities and even inchurch leadership, even though so far women have had absolutely no role in worshiping activities in Jewish houses of worship.\n\nIn Acts 16 vv. 14-15 and 40, we find the name of a woman who played a major role in Paul's ministry, namely Lydia. Try reading both parts of the Bible! What can you find there?\n\nFigure 5.4. Archaeological findings of the mosaics at St. Praxedes, Rome. This mosaic shows the leadership of women in the early church. On the far left is Theodora, with a saint’s mark above her rectangular head, indicating that she was still alive when this mosaic was made.\n\nThe role of women is not only seen in this short story about Lydia. In 1 Corinthians 18 we also find another female character, namely Priscilla, wife of Aquila. Aquila and Priscilla seem to be active missionaries because in Acts 18:26, it is said that together they explained God’s word to Apollos, who later became one of the most important apostles (see 1 Cor. 3:1; 4-6). Christianity and Character Education, Grade 10, 2016, p. 60.\n\nFollowing an explanation on how the Church and the Bible recognize women’s roles in spreading the Gospel, students are asked to reflect on the practice of treating men and women equally at their churches, especially in relation to female leadership. In this way, students can directly engage with the issue of women leadership in their churches.\n\nWhat about the current situation? Are there still churches that do not recognize women as church leaders, elders or pastors? If so, what's the reason? If your church has accepted women as leaders, think further – how many women are leaders in your church? Are their numbers equal to the number of male leaders? If not the same, why? Christianity and Character Education, Grade 10, 2016, p. 61.\n\nThe following lesson explains the shared responsibility of men and women in a family, and that there are no traditionally ‘male’ or ‘female’ jobs.\n\n2. Home as a Comfortable Place\n\nIn addition to material and spiritual needs, of course we also need a comfortable, pleasant, and warm home atmosphere. This is not only a mother’s job, but is the responsibility of all family members, both male and female. Currently, there have been rapid social changes. Many women and mothers have dual roles, namely taking care of household problems (domestic) and working to earn a living outside the home (public sphere). If women have made a breakthrough into the public sphere, then it is time for sons and husbands to also be able to carry out tasks in the domestic field. Thus, a balance will be achieved, no one has a “double burden,” and no more jobs are labelled as “men’s work” and “women’s work.” We all need to change, because of the rapid developments in social and cultural fields. Each person in the family can create a home atmosphere that is comfortable and pleasant. Christianity and Character Education, Grade 11, Semester 1, 2017, pp. 110‒111.\n\nSurprisingly, in the first grade, Hindu students are introduced to a third type of sexuality –effeminate individuals.\n\nThis text describes three types of humans,based on sex and character traits. Those are purusa (men with masculine character traits), pradana (women with feminine character traits), and effeminate individuals (men having feminine character traits, or women having masculine character traits). This description shows the students that Hinduism acknowledges feminine men or masculine women.\n\nThe following are types of people based on gender and character traits:\n\n1. Purusa is a man with masculine character traits. 2. Pradana is a woman with feminine character traits. 3. An effeminate individual is a man with feminine character traits, or vice versa. Hinduism and Character Education, Grade 1, 2017, p. 23.\n\nThe following example states that “[...] the position of husband and wife, must be balanced and equal […], ” confirming Hinduism’s recognition of equality between men and women, including in the household.\n\nMarriage, or wiwaha, is not good if it is forced, under the influence of others, or under other kinds of coercion. This idea needs to be understood and guided, to avoid tension after undergoing the Grehasta Asrama. The success that can lead to wiwaha, or marriage, is due to the nature and qualities of mutual love, mutual trust, mutual awareness, cooperation, complementing each other, working hand in hand, and other qualities in every household activity. The formation of a happy and eternal family must be accompanied by the balance between rights and duties, as well as the position of husband and wife, and these rights and duties must be balanced and equal, even though the swadharma is different in carrying out duties and obligations. [Figure 5.1 Wiwaha] Hinduism and Character Education, Grade 11, 2017, p. 296.\n\nThe following activity, which asks students to choose from one of two genders, suggests that Catholicism adopts a binary system of gender and sexuality.\n\nLet’s color\n\nColor in the picture, write down the title and prayer. Choose an image that suits you: boy or girl. Catholicism and Character Education, Grade 3, 2018, p. 18.\n\nThe following example quotes from the Catechism of the Catholic Church, explaining that the Church views men and women as equal.\n\n3. The View of Church on the Equality of Women and Men\n\nThe Church pays considerable attention to the struggle for gender equality between women and men. The Church’s struggle is based on the Church’s own views, as revealed in the following Catechism of the Catholic Church.\n\nArticle 369\n\nMan and woman have been created, which is to say, willed by God: on the one hand, in perfect equality as human beings; on the other, in their respective beings as man and woman. “Being man” or “being woman” is a reality which is good and willed by God: man and woman possess an inalienable dignity which comes to them immediately from God their Creator. Man and woman are both with one and the same dignity “in the image of God.” In their “being-man”and “being-woman,” they reflect the Creator’s wisdom and goodness.\n\nArticle 371\n\nGod created man and woman together and willed each for the other. The Word of God allows us to understand this through various features of the sacred text. “It is not good that the man should be alone. I will make him a helper fit for him,”(Genesis 2:18). None of the animals can be man’s partner (Genesis 2:19-20). The woman that God “fashions” from the man’s rib and brings to him elicits on the man’s part a cry of wonder, an exclamation of love and communion: “This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh, ” (Genesis 2:23). Man discovers woman as another “I,” sharing the same humanity.\n\nArticle 372\n\nMan and woman were made “for each other” - not that God left them half-made and incomplete: he created them to be a communion of persons, in which each can be “helpmate” to the other, for they are equal as people (“bone of my bones. . .”) and complementary as masculine and feminine. In marriage God unites them in such a way that, by forming “one flesh,” (Genesis 2:24) they can transmit human life: “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth,” (Genesis 1:18). By transmitting human life to their descendants, man and woman as spouses and parents cooperate in a unique way in the Creator’s work. Catholicism and Character Education, Grade 7, 2016, pp. 49‒50.\n\nThe excerpt below discusses the life of Guanyin Niangniang, a woman who fought for human rights in Zhou dynasty China, echoing the of Confucianism recognition of the role of women in religion – “A religion cannot be great if it does not have female figures.”\n\nGuanyin Niangniang lived in seven BC (11th century BC), the third daughter of King Chu Zhuangwang in the Zhou dynasty. Guanyin Niangniang was already a Shen Ming in the temple that the Prophet Kongzi built. Prophet Kongzi expressed his opinion in the Yijing: “A religion cannot be great if it does not have female figures.” Guanyin Niangniang cared deeply for her people, especially those whose lives were suffering, including those imprisoned for breaking the law. Although Guanyin Niangniang is a woman, she felt she had a duty to make her people happy, including those in prison. She paid attention to the prison’s cleanliness and the food given to the prisoners. In today’s era, Guanyin Niangniang would be called a defender of human rights. Note: One of the ten Zhou dynasty intellectuals is a woman. Confucianism and Character Education, Grade 10, 2016, p. 131.\n\nStudents are taught about how Buddhism supports gender equality. The words and actions of the Buddha are mentioned as concrete examples of his support in venerating woman, and in considering them as equal, or even superior to, men.\n\nThe Status of Women in Buddhism\n\nIn Buddhism, equality, or “non-difference,” exists between a boy and a girl. The women's movement is a movement against gender inequality. The Buddha laid a solid foundation nearly 2600 years ago about it. Buddhism acknowledges male and female genders. But in the attainment of liberation, the Buddha did not discriminate between the sexes.\n\n“Some women are really better (than men). According to him, O the King of men. There are women who are wise, pious, treat their mother-in-law as a goddess, and live a holy life. By these noble wives, a valiant son will be born, a king of the world, who will rule the kingdom.”\n\nThe Buddha also said that some women could be better than men. These are the original words that Buddha had spoken. Not only that, but the Buddha also often used the term “Matugama,” which means ‘Mother of the People,’ or ‘Association of Mothers.’ This illustrates how significant a woman’s role is. Likewise, the Buddha also opened the door for women to attain purity. He accepted his aunt, Prajapati Gotami, as his stepmother who entered the life of the Sangha. Finally, Prajapati Gotami was able to establish the Bhikkuni Sangha. Buddhism and Character Education, Grade 9, 2018, p. 63.\n\nIn the following lesson, Grade 2 students learn that boys and girls, and men and women, have equal opportunities, and that they can mix with one another. The lesson also states that treating female and male friends equally, and not discriminating against others based on gender, is the implementation of the second principle of Pancasila.\n\nTake a look at this picture!\n\nBeni gives girls the same opportunity. Beni is grateful to have friends, including his female friends.\n\nLet’s tell a story Share your experience! An experience in school that is applicable to the second verse of Pancasila!\n\nI’m really happy to have friends. All my friends are nice. My friends and I are the same. I also don’t differentiate between the girls. When we’re playing, I invite them. Girls have the same opportunity as boys. My Experience, Grade II, 2017, pp. 102-103\n\nThe following lesson for Grade 5 students presents an explanation of the Kongres Perempuan Indonesia (Indonesian Women’s Congress), teaching students about women’s involvement in politics and women’s contribution to the law, their welfare, and Indonesia’s development.\n\nIndonesian Women’s Congress\n\nThe Indonesian Women’s Congress took place three times. On the date of August 22, 1928 in Yogyakarta, the first Indonesian Women’s Congress was held. This congress was attended by representatives of various women’s organizations in Indonesia including Mrs. Sukamto, Mrs. Ki Hajar Dewantara, and Miss Suyatin. The Congress resulted in the development of the Indonesian Women’s Union (PPI). The Congress also succeeded in formulating the goal of unifying a vision and a program for advancing Indonesian women, and unifying and creating a network of women’s groups. On December 28–31, 1929, the PPI held a congress in Jakarta, and changed the name of PPI to PPII (Association of Indonesian Wives).\n\nOn 20–24 July, 1935, the Second Indonesian Women's Congress was held in Jakarta, led by Mrs. Sri Mangunsarkoro. The Congress discussed the issue of women’s labor, eradication of illiteracy, and marriage.\n\nThe Third Women’s Congress took place in Bandung on 23–28 July, 1938, led by Mrs. Emma Puradireja, talking about voting rights and women being elected to representative bodies. At the Congress, abill on modern marriage,arranged by Mrs. Maria Ulfah, was approved, and it was agreed that PPI’s date of establishment was December 22, commemorated as Mother's Day. Events in Life, Grade 5, 2017, p. 70.\n\nAnother example of women’s contribution to Indonesia is presented in the lesson below, on women’s organizations in Indonesia in the early 20th century. Those organizations contributed to the education of Indonesian women and girls, and to gender equality.\n\n[…]. Putri Mardika, the first women’s organization, was officially established in 1912 in Jakarta. The organization aimed to help Indonesian girls access education, encourage them to voice their opinions in public, and improve women’s image so they would be treated like equal human beings. The organization had various programs, especially granting educational scholarships to promote education, and publishing women’s magazines called Putri Mardika. The members of Putri Mardika’s management board included Sabaruddin, R. A. Sutinah, Joyo Pranoto, Rr. Rukmini, and Sadikun Tondokusumo. Meanwhile, Mrs. C. Th. Van Deventer, an Ethical Policy advisor, founded Kartini Fonds. Founded in 1912, its goal was to establish Kartini School. […]\n\nThe women’s organizations developing across multiple locations in Indonesia later held the first Indonesian Women’s Congress on December 22-25, 1928, in Pendopo Joyodipuro, led by Mrs. R. A. Sukanto. The congress was initiated by Mrs. Sukoto, Nyi Hajar Dewantara, and Ms. Suyatin. The congress aimed to create and maintain a sense of unity among the women’s organizations, and to empower women. As many as 30 women’s organizations attended the first Indonesian Women’s Congress. The congress was an important part of unifying the Indonesian women’s movement. Thus, December 22 is commemorated as Mother’s Day in Indonesia, to celebrate the history of the Women’s Congress. Indonesian History, Grade 11, Semester 1, 2017, pp. 222-223.\n\nStudents learn that women also contributed to Indonesia’s struggle against colonization, and fight for independence. The passage illustrates this by featuring prominent female figures such as Dewi Sartika, Maria Walanda Maramis, Rohana Kudus, as well as the Aisiyah women’s organization, and the Aisiyah, the second-largest Muslim organization in Indonesia.\n\nInsight The Struggle of Women Heroes\n\nDewi Sartika established a school in Bandung, West Java. Maria Walanda Maramis established a school in Gorontalo, Sulawesi. Amid a national independence movement, women played an active role in supporting the nation's unity. They actively struggled for Indonesian independence. In 1912, Putri Mahardika was established in Jakarta. The activities included education, and publication. In 1914, Rohana Kudus established Kerajinan Amai Setia (Amai Setia Handicraft) in Gadang, Bukittinggi, West Sumatra. Rohana played active roles in developing schools for the women. In 1917, Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta established Aisyah. Aisyah is the first Muhammadiyah women’s organization led by Siti Wardah, the wife of the Muhammadiyah founder, KH Ahmad Dahlan. Aisyah activities include da`wah (the act of inviting or calling people to embrace Islam), education, health, and culture. Women’s organizations have nationalist spirit. From 22 to 25 December, 1928, a Women’s Congress was held in Yogyakarta. Seven women’s organizations joined the congress. They responded to the Youth Pledge proclaimed on October 28, 1928. The congress was led by RA Sukanto, and succeeded in establishing the Indonesian Women’s Association (PPPI). Social Science, Grade 8, 2017, p. 237.\n\nA Grade 2 textbook promotes gender equality by showing both male and female students taking care of plants, demonstrating that gardening – sometimes perceived as a stereotypically feminine activity – is not exclusive to women.\n\nCaring for Animals and Plants, Grade 2, 2017, pp. 106, 155, 175.\n\nSimilarly, a first grade textbook on the environment depicts both men and women working together to complete household chores. The example states that “Mother is sweeping the floor. Father is pruning the plants and sweeping the yard,” reflecting the shared responsibilities between a mother and a father in keeping the home environment clean. The text and illustration describe a family as being comprised of a father, a mother, and a child.\n\nWorking together to clean the house\n\nMother and father are cleaning the house. Mother is sweeping the floor. Father is pruning the plants and sweeping the yard. Dayu wants to help father and mother. Dayu wants to clean the windows. However, Dayu does not know how to clean the windows. Mother gives instructions on how to do it.\n\nIbu: Dayu, first dampen a cloth with water. Then, rub the window panes with the cloth. After that, dry the glass with newspaper.\n\nDayu: Ok, Mom.\n\nThe glass becomes clean and shiny. They work happily. They want their house clean and hygienic. Clean, Beautiful, and Healthy Environment, Grade 1, 2017, p. 2. Another example of how all family members share household chores, regardless of gender, is presented in a first grade textbook. The image shows the father sweeping the floor, and the son, Udin, cleaning the window.\n\nLet’s Tell\n\nTake a look at the image above. Explain it in front of your friends.\n\nUdin and his family were cleaning the house. Udin, his sister, and father were happy to help the mother. Are you happy to help your mother at home? Are you happy to help your father at home? What chores do you do? My Family, Grade 1, 2017, p. 79\n\nFurthermore, a poster designed to encourage students to clean the house displays the image of a boy holding cleaning equipment. This example suggests that boys share the responsibility of cleaning the house, subverting traditional gender roles.\n\nCome on! Clean Up Your Home Clean House\n\nGood Health\n\nHappy Parents My Family, Grade 1, 2017, p. 161.\n\nA passage from a Grade 4 textbook presents a female student, Ida, as an example of someone possessing the qualities of an ideal leader. It suggests that women can be good leaders, and that leaders are not always men.\n\nIdeal Leader, Honest Leader\n\nIda sits next to me at school. She is petite, has tanned skin, quiet, and smart. She is a modest girl. Her father died long ago. She lives with her mother and younger sibling.\n\nIda is very bright. Thanks to her consistently good scores, she can continue her education for free. The school provides her with all her textbooks and other educational materials. Ida is never embarrassed about her family circumstances. Theyeven motivate her to study harder, and accomplish more.\n\nIda’s friends always ask her if they have problems understanding some lessons. Her classmates have chosen Ida as the class prefect. She has what it takes for this position; she is smart, coolheaded, a good communicator, and can keep her class under control. Various Jobs, Grade 4, 2017, p. 28.\n\nThe image below features both boys and girls with differences in physical attributes and clothing, playing soccer together. This demonstrates that soccer is not a sport associated with only one gender – rather, anyone can play soccer.\n\nLet’s Observe\n\nThe dry season has arrived. In the morning, the sun shines brightly. Siti, Dayu, and Lani play in the park. The park is near the house. In the park, many friends have been waiting. Edo, Udin, and Beni are there. They play together. Natural Events, Grade 1, 2017, p. 59.\n\nSimilarly, the below example demonstrates this subversion of gender roles. A first-grade textbook presents a group of children doing a traditional dance with a scarf, including children of both genders. This suggests that boys are allowed to do traditional dances with graceful movements.\n\nLet’s Dance\n\nLet’s imitate bird movements.\n\nDance to the rhythm.\n\nNatural Events, Grade 1, 2017, p. 86.\n\nDevelopment policies that will be carried out in the next five years are directed at: increasing the involvement of women in the political process and public office; improving the level of education and health services, and other developmental fields to enhance the quality of women’s life; perfecting legal instruments to protect each individual from various acts of violence, exploitation, and discrimination.\n\nIn addition, the government’s program in empowering women to improve the quality of life, role and position of women in various areas of life and development, as well as increasing protection for women against various forms of violence, exploitation, and discrimination. The main activities carried out are as follows. Pancasila and Civics Education, Grade 9, 2018, pp. 140-141.\n\nA Natural Sciences lesson teaches women about the hymen following a previous educational segment on the vagina, stating that “The primary purpose of the hymen’s creation is for women to take care not to do dangerous activities, especially disgraceful acts that violate social and religious norms.” The sentence emphasizes the importance of women avoiding dangerous activities to prevent their hymen from breaking; in the previous section on the vagina, there is no additional information on how the hymen can be torn because of other causes beyond the women’s control, such as abuse, or that some women may be born without one. It is worth noting that, in Indonesia, premarital sex is considered sinful and is seen by many as violating societal norms. A broken hymen is closely associated with losing one’s virginity, and women who lose their virginity are viewed negatively regardless of the cause.\n\nDid you know?\n\nDid you know that the hymen is a thin tissue that consists of blood vessels? The hymen can be torn because of dangerous activities. Therefore, women, you need to be careful not to break the hymen by avoiding dangerous activities.\n\nYou may be asking why The Almighty God bestows a hymen unto women. The Almighty God does not bestow a hymen unto women without any purpose. The primary purpose of the hymen’s creation is for women to take care not to do dangerous activities, especially disgraceful acts that violate social and religious norms. Natural Science, Grade 9, 2018, p. 19.\n\nA passage which addresses concerns over the extinction of the Sundanese language due to a declining number of speakers blames parents, but places greater blame on mothers for not teaching their children Sundanese, without any further explanation.\n\nThe Importance of Preserving Mother Language\n\n1. A global term for one’s first language is mother tongue, or mother language. UNESCO and people around the globe celebrate every 21st of February as International Mother Language Day. Every country has a mother language. That means a language which every person has been taught from his/her mother in early childhood. For example, the mother tongue of Sundanese people is Sundanese, and of Batak people is Batak. Another example is people from Padang, Papua, Aceh, Javanese, Buginese, Betawi, Cirebon, etc. who have their own mother languages. Each country around the globe has its own mother language.\n\n4. Who to blame? Certainly we blame parents, especially mothers, who do not teach Sundanese to their children. Language is national identity. Let us say that we are Sundanese, but we do not speak Sundanese. Many young Sundanese feel ashamed and do not feel confident speaking Sundanese. This kind of feeling is actually the mindset of their parents, as they consider Sundanese not important to teach and they fear their children, if speaking in local language, will be stereotyped as old-fashioned by their friends and neighbors. This kind of mindset is ingrained within Sundanese society and leads to a decline in its native speakers. 5. Parents are considered as lacking in self-confidence when they do not want to teach children Sundanese and feel ashamed of teaching it. When they have low self-esteem and feel inferiority toward other people by speaking Sundanese, they will degrade their true identities. However, when we have many capabilities and acknowledge who we really are, people will respect us. Even when we speak Sundanese, we have abilities in many fields. 6. If you want to be respected by others, you should show your true identity, not to hide it, but to reveal it while improving your personal competencies. Do not be afraid if someone underestimates you when speaking Sundanese. Our mother tongue is our true identity. Parents, especially mothers, should teach their children Sundanese to preserve our cultural identity. Sundanese Language, Grade 8, 2014, pp. 103-104.\n\nCommunism and Indonesia\n\nCommunist ideology experienced a rise and fall in popularity in Indonesia, before being banned by the New Order regime (1966‒1988). After the 1948 Madiun rebellion, which sparked conflict and hostility between the Indonesian Communist Party and Muslims due to religious harassment, the influence of Communism was weakened. However, following the great success of a Communist party in 1955, ranking fourth in the general election, Communist ideology began to develop. 93 Moreover, Communism was also once accused of strongly influencing Sukarno’s ideology, articulated in Political Manifesto: 1945 Constitution, Indonesian Socialism, Guided Democracy, Guided Economy, and Indonesian Personality94 and Nationalism, Religion, and Communism, 95 an ideology promoted during the Old Order.\n\n96\n\nThe following text describes how the Indonesian Communist Party was recognized as one of the organizations contributing to the struggle against Dutch colonialism. However, as a result of the Party’s underdeveloped plan, their confrontation with the Dutch colonialists was less successful, and was said to make “the Dutch put more pressure on Indonesian activists.\n\n93 Soedarno, R., & Ginanjar,\"Perkembangan Politik Partai Komunis Indonesia (1948-1965)\", 2014, Jurnal Artefak, https://jurnal.unigal.ac.id/index.php/artefak/article/view/1061/pdf. 94 Manipol Usdek/Ma--nifesto Politik: UUD 1945, Sosialisme Indonesia, Demokrasi Terpimpin, E--konomi Terpimpin, dan Kepribadian Indonesia. 95 Nasakom/Nasionalisme, Agama, dan Komunisme. 96 Abdurrahmansyah.,\"Komunisme Dan Kurikulum Pendidikan Di Indonesia\", 2020, https://palembang.tribunnews.com/2020/12/19/komunisme-dan-kurikulum-pendidikan-di-indonesia?page=4.\n\nInsight\n\nDuring the national awakening, a prominent organization, the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI), emerged. The forerunner of the PKI was the Indische SociaalDemocratische Vereeniging (ISDV), which was founded by Henk Sneevelt (a Dutch man) in 1914 in Semarang. The Indonesian Communist Party was founded on May 23, 1920, chaired by Semaun. The PKI carried out its first confrontation with forces in 1926. The 1926 confrontation was less developed, causing some of the prominent figures to be arrested and exiled abroad. This confrontation also harmed other national movements. As a result of this confrontation, the Dutch put more pressure on Indonesian activists. Social Science, Grade 8, 2017, pp. 246.\n\nAn example of a famous Indonesian film director, which describes a film he directed on the “treason” of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) as “controversial,” highlights the differing opinions on the accusation that the Party was behind an attempted coup on September 30, 1965. As a result of the coup attempt, the Indonesian Communist Party was banned, and was blamed for the murder of six Indonesian army generals.\n\nGetting to Know a Theater Figure\n\nArifin C. Noer, known by his abbreviated name Arifin C. Noer, was the leading and most well-paid Indonesian theater and film director of his time. The director, who was born in Cirebon on March 10, 1941, won the Citra Award several times for Best Film and Best Screenwriter. Arifin died in Jakarta on May 28, 1995. Arifin was very famous through the controversial film he directed: Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI [The Treason of the Indonesian Communist Party on September 30, 1965] (1984). The film was required to be screened on all TV stations every year on September 30 by the government of the Second President of the Republic of Indonesia 91966-1988), to commemorate Gerakan 30 September 1965 [the September 30th , 1965 Movement]. Art and Culture, Grade 7, 2017, p. 114.\n\nThis Grade 12 history textbook discusses the coup in an unbiased, more neutral tone by presenting the views of seven individuals on who they believe was behind the attempted coup. This is despite the long-held belief – since the release of the Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI – Treason of Indonesian Communist Party on September 30, 1965 film – that the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) was behind the coup, and the killing of army generals.\n\nc) 30 September 1965 Movement (G30S/PKI – Communist Party Indonesia) It is a controversial movement. The controversy mainly relates to the question of “Who was the mastermind behind the 30 September Movement?” There are at least seven theories of the G30 coup in 1965:\n\n1) The 30 September Movement was an internal problem in the army. 2) The mastermind behind the 30 September Movement was the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 3) The 30 September Movement was a mixture of Britain – US Interests. 4) Sukarno was the mastermind behind the September 30 Movement. 5) There was no single mastermind of the ‘Big Scenario’ of the 30 September Movement (Chaos Theory). 6) Suharto was the mastermind behind the 30 September Movement. 7) The Mastermind behind the 30 September Movement was PKI [Indonesian Communist Party]. Indonesian History, Grade 12, 2018-2022, pp. 16‒17.\n\nStudents are taught an example of religious harassment committed by the PKI (Indonesian Communist Party), communist rebels, which resulted in conflict and hostility between Muslims and the PKI.\n\nMeanwhile, in Mantingan, the PKI tried to forcibly take over 160 hectares of waqf land at Pondok Modern Gontor (Ambarwulan and Kasdi in Taufik Abdullah, ed., 2012: 139). This act, of course, further angered the Muslim community. Moreover, four months earlier, the Kanigoro Kediri incident happened, when the BTI created chaos that made participants of the Indonesian Islamic Student Training afraid, and entered their place of worship at dawn, without taking off their shoes covered in mud, and then desecrated the Qur’an. Indonesian History, Grade 12, 2018, p. 21.\n\nIndonesians of Chinese Descent\n\nEven though since the era of politician and religious leader Abdurrahman Wahid, Indonesians of Chinese descent have regained their minority rights, there remains a stigma with regards this minority group. Dutch colonization saw a deterioration in the harmonious relations between native inhabitants of Indonesia, and those coming from China. This animosity can be traced back to the Wijkenstelsel & Passenstelsel policy, a centralization and passport system implemented against the Chinese community in Indonesia. During the Old and New Order eras, some policies prevented Indonesians of Chinese descent from enjoying their rights, and caused them to stay within their communities.\n\nAt present, Indonesians of Chinese descent exercise their rights freely, and openly. They are present in politics, and in other sectors they were once prohibited to enter. That said, anti-Chinese sentiment is still quite pronounced, such as during the Jakarta governor’s election in 2017. This is fueled by the view that being anti-Communist is being anti-China, which impacts Chinese Indonesians; hate speech against Chinese Indonesians relating to the Coronavirus’s Chinese origins; and human rights violations against Uyghur Muslims in China. Despite thesegrowing negative sentiments, some materials present Indonesians ofChinese descent as an inseparable partof Indonesia,by pointing out that they have equal rights with other ethnicities in Indonesia, and that they also contribute to Indonesia’s cultural development.\n\nThe following lesson emphasizes the contribution of Abdurrahman Wahid to restoring Chinese minority rights, and promoting religious inclusivity. From this, students learn that Indonesians of Chinese descent are part of Indonesian society, and their rights must be upheld.\n\nAnother achievement of Abdurrahman Wahid’s governance is the restoration of the right of the ethnic Chinese minority to practice their Confucianist beliefs, through the Presidential Decree no. 6 of 2000 on the restoration of civil rights of adherents to Confucianism.\n\nDuring his governance, President Abdurrahman Wahid tried to reduce state interference in the lives of religious people. However, on the other hand, he actually adopted an attitude that was contrary to his political supporters, especially in the case of Communism and the issue of Israel. President Abdurrahman Wahid’s attitude, which tends to support pluralism in society, including in religious life and the rights of minority groups, was one of the starting points for the rise of various actions against his policies and ideas. In the case of Communism, President Abdurrahman Wahid raised a controversial idea, revoking the Tap. MPRS No. XXV of 1966 regulation regarding the prohibition of the Indonesian Communist Party, and the spread of Marxism and Leninism. The idea was challenged by Islamic communities, including the Indonesian Ulema Council and figures from mass organizations and Islamic political parties. These reactions discouraged President Abdurrahman Wahid from bringing his plans and ideas to the MPR Annual Session in 2000. Indonesian History, Grade 12, 2018, pp. 164-165.\n\nThe following extract from a Grade 7 Art and Culture textbook presents a prominent Indonesian dancer of Chinese descent, Didik Nini Thowok. It demonstrates a love of Indonesian traditional dance, and the contribution of Chinese Indonesians to Indonesian dance. As the text explains that Didik’s parents are of different ethnicities (Chinese and Javanese), it helps students to understand that different cultures can marry and coexist in peace. Meeting people of different ethnicities is not an issue, and not something to be avoided. The second and fifth paragraphs reveal how a boy and a man can do skills traditionally perceived as ‘feminine, ’ without negative judgment from society, and even Didik’s family and friends are shown to be supportive of what he did.\n\nGetting to Know a Dancer\n\nDidik Nini Thowok was born as Kwee Tjoen Lian. Because he was often sick, his parents changed his name to Kwee Tjoen An. Didik’s father, Kwee Yoe Tiang, was of Chinese descent who was “stranded” in Temanggung, while his mother, Suminah, was a native Javanese from Citayem Village, Cilacap. Didik is the eldest of five children (he has four younger sisters). After G30S/PKI [the September 30th Movement], Chinese descendants were required to change their Chinese names to indigenous names, so Kwee Tjoen An changed to Didik Hadiprayitno.\n\nDidik’s life as a child was not easy. His father ran a cow and goat skin business. His mother owned a small shop in Pasar Kayu [a traditional market]. His grandparents lived with Didik’s family. They lived from hand to mouth. As the first child and grandchild, Didik was always spoiled by his family. Didik was not naughty as most boys his age. He tended to be like a girl and liked girl’s games, such as playing make-believe, including selling and buying things, being a mother, and cooking. When he was a child, his grandmother taught him traditional women’s skills such as sewing, embroidering, and crocheting. Didik first choreographed a dance in mid-1971. The dance was entitled “Tari Persembahan” [the offering dance], which was a combination of Balinese and Javanese dance moves. Didik first performed as a woman dancer, wearing a kebaya [traditional Javanese outfit for a woman] with hair bun, at a high school graduation\n\nceremony in 1972. At that time, Didik presented his own dance gracefully. Didik then continued to develop his dancing skills by learning everywhere. Didik learned Balinese dancing directly from the maestro, I Gusti Gde Raka, in Gianyar. He also learned Sundanese dancing from Endo Suanda and the Palimanan style of Tari Topeng Cirebon [Cirebon Mask Dance] from a great figure of Topeng Cirebon [Cirebon Mask], Mrs. Suji. When he was in Japan, Didik learned Noh (Hagomoro) classical dancing; when he was in Spain, he learned Flamenco dancing. Art and Culture, Grade 7, 2017, pp. 89-90.\n\nEmphasis on Specific Groups\n\nEven though most materials in the 2013 curriculum, published by The Ministry of Education and Culture, display a neutral attitude without referring to any particular religion, some of the textbooks outside of religious education refer to the majority religion, Islam. In a section on gotong royong (mutual cooperation), a lesson features a dialogue between a teacher and a student where the student is asked to display Islam calligraphy in a classroom. Although the type of calligraphy is unspecified in the dialogue, the image uses the symbol of the majority religion in Indonesia.\n\nLet’s Observe Read the following conversation! Teacher: Kids, I have calligraphy. How can we use it? Beni: Let’s display it. Teacher: Please help me to display this calligraphy in the classroom. Beni: Sure, Beni will do it. My Experience, Grade II, 2017, p. 75\n\nWhen earning about poetry, students are presented with a poem about the festival of Lebaran, customs of Eid al-Fitr in Indonesia, and Arabic words such as subhanallah and alhamdulillah, which are not often spoken by other communities in Indonesia in daily life. Rather than referring to a general or neutral topic, this poem draws upon customs and words from a specific religious group in Indonesia.\n\nEid Ketupat\n\nEid ketupat with curried chicken wings Eaten after the Eid prayer For grandpa and grandma, neighbors and friends So delighted, Subhan Allah how beautiful Eid ketupat with liver-fried chili Served on the table after the prayer Tasty and delicious and savory Try ketupat, Alhamdulillah really delicious My Experience, Grade 2, 2017, p. 96. Likewise, while a first grade textbook typically presents its materials without reference to any specific religion, the below illustration shows all students praying in the Muslim way (raising two hands), rather than showing different ways to pray.\n\nLet’s observe Look at this picture. These are Siti’s new friends. What are they doing? They are praying. They pray before studying. Myself, Grade 1, 2017, p. 29.\n\nA similar illustration teaching students to pray before going home depicts the Muslim way of praying (raising two hands) instead of including other possible ways of praying.\n\nToday’s lesson is over. What do Udin and his friends do before they go home? Living in Harmony, Grade 2, 2017, p. 109 In explaining the importance of becoming closer to God for a singer of traditional music, the following example refers specifically to Allah, the God of Islam, among other neutral references to God – Tuhan Yang Maha Esa and Sang Khalik. No other specific references to God in different religions are used in this extract.\n\nTraditional music singers seriously maintain their health by consuming traditional jamu [traditional herbal medicines from Indonesia]. Do you know that traditional jamu is made from plants and animals?\n\nBesides, the singers or sinden [singers of traditional song] of traditional music have some taboos and must be close to the Creator, the creator of the universe.\n\nIs there a relationship between consuming herbal medicine, avoiding taboos, and getting closer to the Creator of the universe, Allah [the name of Allah in Islam], the Almighty God, with the melodious voice they have?
