        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nYogyakarta is a bustling town of some 375,000 people (2020) and the most popular tourist destination on Java, largely thanks to its proximity to the temples of Borobudur and Prambanan. The city is a centre of art and education, offers some good shopping and has a wide range of tourist facilities. It is named after the city of Ayodhya in India, where Rama, an avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu is said to have had his capital, and whose rule is considered by Hindus to be the epitome of good governance and a moral society.\n\nThe city (kota) of Yogyakarta is one of five districts in the semi-autonomous province of Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY), the \"Yogyakarta Special Region\". The other districts are the regencies of:\n\nSleman on the slopes of fiery Mount Merapi to the north\n\nBantul all the way to the sea to the south\n\nThe hills of Gunung Kidul to the east\n\nThe lowlands of Kulon Progo to the West\n\nThis special status is thanks to the Sultanate of Hamengkubuwono, which has ruled the area since 1749 and steered the state through difficult times of occupation and revolution. During the Indonesian war of independence, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX offered the fledgeling Indonesian government his enclave as a capital city. Yogyakarta became the revolutionary capital of the republic from 1946 to 1949 when Jakarta was still occupied by the Dutch. As a result, the newly-independent Indonesia appointed the Sultan as the governor of the province of DIY — the only one in Indonesia that is not elected directly by the people. The Indonesian central government has tried to weaken the sultan's power by calling for direct elections for the governor. The present sultan, Hamengkubuwono X, was chosen by an overwhelming majority.\n\nYogyakarta lies in one of the most seismically active parts of Java and has been repeatedly struck by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The worst in recent times was the earthquake of 27 May 2006, which killed over 6,000 people and flattened over 300,000 houses. The epicentre was 25 km (16 mi) south of the city, which avoided the worst of the quake. A very effective disaster recovery effort repaired most of the physical damage quickly.\n\nYogyakarta is full of domestic tourists during school holidays, with tourist buses on the visitor hotspots of shopping street Jl Malioboro and the northern palace square, or alun-alun, trapped in heavy traffic. Vehicles, parking and vendors contribute to the traffic jams.\n\nTourist information\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are three information offices, one at the airport, one at the main railway station, and this main one:\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nYogyakarta is a relatively small city, so travelling around town should not be too expensive. If you are travelling on foot, a street sign facing you at a corner indicates the name of the street you are entering, not the cross street.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nMedium and small buses are the main public transport in Yogyakarta.\n\nThe TransJogja rapid transit system operates from 05:30 to 21:30 and stops only at designated shelters. They are air-conditioned and generally safe. Tickets can be bought at the kiosks, and the cost for a single trip is Rp3,600. You can buy regular trip cards which cut the per trip cost to Rp3,000, and allow transit to other shelters. Get a free route map for the TransJogja buses at the Tourist Information Centre on Jl Malioboro.\n\nBuses other than TransJogja normally operate 06:00 to 17:00, or 21:00 for some long routes. The cost for a single trip is Rp3,000 regardless of distance (within the city). Usually on a bus there will be a driver and a helper who will hang from the side of the bus and handle money and try to attract passengers. The helper will usually tap you on the shoulder to indicate you should pay him. If there is no helper you can pay the driver directly. When you are ready to get off a bus, tell the driver or helper \"kiri\" (KIH-ree) which means left.\n\nBy car or motorbike\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are several car and motorbike rental agencies just outside Tugu Station, on the street that runs east-west just south of the station. A car or motorbike delivery and pick-up at the airport remain the best way to rent them.\n\nDriving a car in Indonesia is never a rewarding experience. But for those that would like to, a Toyota Avanza or Daihatsu Xenia (6 passengers) can be rented for around Rp250,000-300,000 for 24 hours, or Rp175,000-225,000 for 12 hours. A new green car, Toyota Agya or Daihatsu Ayla, can be rented for Rp150,000 for 24 hours. Most of the companies will ask you for the driving licence and ID cards for security reasons.\n\nRenting a car with a driver is a more relaxing proposition. A driver will cost an additional Rp50,000-200,000 a day. The cost of a car with a driver may vary depending on whether fuel is included for a set distance or for the whole itinerary. Prices are always subject to negotiation and may increase or decrease due to local demand, type and age of vehicle and your individual requirements at the time. The normal rates (not the high season/peak season) will be around Rp450,000-500,000 per 12 hours' service.\n\nA near new semi-automatic (clutchless) motorbike can be rented for Rp60,000 per 24 hours; older bikes may come for less, and fully automatic bikes such as a Honda Vario or Yamaha Mio may sometimes cost Rp5,000-10,000 more. Many roads outside Yogyakarta are unpaved, especially around the Mount Merapi area, so many motorcycle rentals offer a semi-offroad automatic bike with a daily fee around Rp75,000.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nYogyakarta's taxis are metered and most drivers are trustworthy. All taxis have a flagfall of Rp7,000 for the first kilometre and then Rp4,250 for every subsequent kilometre. Most trips around the centre should not cost more than Rp20,000. If you find a driver you feel comfortable with, ask for their mobile number so next time you need to travel you can call him directly. Most drivers are more than happy to do this.\n\nBy ojek\n\n[edit]\n\nMotorcycle taxis are widespread. They usually gather at designated spots (pangkalan), where you will haggle your way to a ride. Not comfortable or convenient for carrying luggage, but quicker if the traffic is heavy.\n\nNowadays, organized ojek are strong competitors to taxis and ojek pangkalan. Pickup is free and you pay according to the printout from the meter. No haggling. Try:\n\nDisability ojeks are also available in Yogyakarta. The system is run by disabled persons, including the drivers. Using motorcycles with sidecars, the can carry a person with a wheelchair. Spacious enough, so two slim non-disabled people can also use it. Try:\n\nBy ride-hailing\n\n[edit]\n\nYou can request car or motorbike rides with ride-hailing apps such as Gojek, Grab and Maxim. They are typically cheaper than taxis, have short waiting times in the central area, and are mostly straightforward to use; however, expect very little English from most drivers. When you request a car or motorbike using one of these apps, it's handy to have an Indonesian speaker to help you communicate with the driver, or learn some of the keywords and phrases used in this situation. See the Indonesian phrasebook.\n\nBy becak\n\n[edit]\n\nThree-wheeled pedal-powered trishaws or pedicabs, known as becak (BAY-cha'), can be found in most parts of Yogyakarta, for shortish journeys (remember there is some poor guy pedalling away behind you). Haggle furiously before getting in. Be sure to determine whether the price is for a one-way or return (pulang) trip and if you want the driver to wait while you conduct your shopping or business. The journey from within the city to the Malioboro shopping precinct should not cost more than Rp10,000.\n\nBy andong\n\n[edit]\n\nThe two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage is still found in Jogja. While happy to do a tourist jaunt, they are mostly used by the Jogjanese for shortish trips around their neighbourhoods, to and from the market, for example. There is also a \"Grab Andong\" service which you can order via the app and can be ordered along the Malioboro area.\n\nAs in the rest of Indonesia, walking in Jogja is probably one of the least convenient and least popular ways of transport, with two remarkable exceptions:\n\nJalan Malioboro, with its vibrant street life, colourful shop facades, large walkways and street artists;\n\nThe charming Kampung Taman Sari neighborhood containing the remains of the Taman Sari Water Castle.\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nYogyakarta food used to be known for its sweetness. However, as more and more people move to Jogja, the city starts seeing more diversity in flavor. Now you can find many kinds of interesting dishes, from sweet, spicy, to fiery. Sometimes a fusion from other cuisines such as Chinese or Western can be found. Since the influx of people from around the country, you can find some restaurants and cafes that open until 23:00 in the centre.\n\nIf you want to eat the traditional way, head to Malioboro for a lesehan dinner in front of the closed shophouses, similar to the Japanese eating style on a tatami, but you sit on a mat and eat with your hands (you can ask for cutlery though). The food is ready to serve, — vegetables, fried and grilled meat (satay, seafood) are the most common, served with white rice. You can also order traditional gudeg. While this is a favorite among locals for the mingle for hours, do not expect very cheap prices.\n\nLocal delicacies\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following dishes are recommended:\n\nGudeg, a sweet and dry curry of jackfruit, chicken and egg served with rice, and the most famous local dish. Goopy slop in various shades of brown, the stuff does not look particularly appetizing, but it can be tasty if done right. There are many gudeg restaurants, but the most popular are: Gudeg Wijilan, Gudeg Juminten, Gudeg Bu Tjitro, Gudeg Tugu, Gudeg Bu Ahmad. If you can wake up early in the morning, you may find small stalls serving Gudeg just at the corner of the street, or close to traditional markets. If you can't sleep at night, you can go to Jalan Janturan and enjoy the Gudeg Pawon (enjoying gudeg inside the old style kitchen) that open in late night. Due to the heavy fiber content of young jackfruit and the thick coconut milk, those who have a weak stomach may have trouble with gudeg.\n\nAyam geprek, the original can be found just outside the city limit at Ayam Geprek Bu Rum, deep-fried chicken with crispy batter which is then crushed under pestle along with chili peppers, salt, and garlic and served with rice. Various side dish can be added to the chicken such as grated cheddar, fried eggplant, tempeh, or tofu.\n\nOseng mercon, spicy stir fried beef and offal.\n\nBrongkos, sweet beef and bean in a keluak nut soup.\n\nEnthok slenget, spicy muscovy duck soup.\n\nNasi langgi, locally known as sego langgi (langgi rice). Warm rice served with various side dishes. Can be found in small stall in Gandekan St.\n\nKipo, bite-size snacks made of green tapioca dough filled with sweetened grated coconut. Can be found in Kotagede.\n\nBakpia, another bite-size snack made from sweetened green bean paste wrapped with thin dough pastry. The most popular bakpia is known as Bakpia Patuk, which not surprisingly, are sold in Pathuk street, also known as Jl. Aip K.S. Tubun.\n\nJadah tempe, sandwich of rice cake and sweet beancake. Can be found in Kaliurang.\n\nEs rujak or rujak es krim, a fruit salad made from mangos, papayas, apples, pineapples, cucumbers etc., mixed with palm sugar, lime juice, salt, chillies and (of course) ice cream (es krim). All flavours (sweet, sour, bitter, spicy, salty) in one plate. In case you are at UGM campus, have a look along Jalan Kaliurang. Small foodstalls sell es rujak there (only very late morning to early afternoon). If you are not close to UGM, keep your eyes open.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nYogyakarta is a heaven of inexpensive foods, and some tasty and filling dishes can cost as little as Rp5,000. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of hawker stalls offering inexpensive foods.\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nGudeg Sagan, An eating place in Jalan Sagan (in front of Toko Sagan Baru) offering rice, seasoned porridge, gudeg, areh sauce, sambal goreng krecek, complete with chicken and brown hard-boiled egg.\n\nQuali Resto, Plaza Ambarrukmo, 3rd floor, near the foodcourt. Serves various kind of Chinese dishes, but their specialty is kwetiaw (wide noodles). Rp20,000.\n\nSapi Bali, Jl. Umbul Permai, Mudal, Sariharjo, Ngaglik, Sleman, Yogyakarta, ☏ . Serves Balinese style ribs, although a little too hot and spicy for some foreigners. If you do not like hot and spicy food, opt for the Soy Sauce Ribs. Rp25,000.\n\nVia Via, Jl. Prawirotaman, An excellent traveller's cafe, there are clocks on the wall showing the time in other Via Via cafes around the world and a mix of travellers and Indonesian locals. Offers a range of western dishes (good French onion soup) and specialty Indonesian dishes at a good price. Caters very well to vegetarians (tofu and tempe). Cane chairs and lots of space and games. Rp30,000-100,000.\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nJogja has many 'high-end' restaurants serving western to Asian to Asian-fusion cuisines.\n\nStay safe\n\n[edit]\n\nJogja has its share of petty crime like pickpocketing, especially in city buses and along Jalan Malioboro when crowded.\n\nWatch out for gallery scams and street sellers trying to get a commission for batik. These tend to occur around the Kraton and Malioboro areas. Scammers will approach tourists and tell them about a government art centre and will hire cheap transport to the 'genuine' gallery. If you're interested in buying batik, this isn't necessarily bad, but you are, in essence, being manipulated. These scams mainly occur on Jalan Malioboro. They have people waiting on the streets approaching foreigners, even if you're with a local companion. General rule of thumb is if they're approaching you in English, they're trying to get something out of you.\n\nBe cautious when walking in the city. Traffic is brutal! You might have difficulty crossing roads and streets, especially in crowded places. Pavements, even where they exist, are in poor condition, and signs over the pavement hang lower than head height for many foreigners, so watch your feet and your head. At night, street lighting will usually be poor, making it even harder.\n\nMount Merapi volcano looms over the city. The last eruption was in May 2018, spewing ashes about 6km high. Although it wasn't as big and destructive as in 2010.\n\nTry to travel in groups if going to or from Parangtritis beach. The long stretch between Jogja and the beach can be dangerous at night. You may get stopped by someone riding a motorcycle trying to rob you. There are few police stations along the road, and often unoccupied.\n\nNever swim at Parangtritis beach due to strong rip currents."
