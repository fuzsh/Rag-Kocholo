Abu Bakar, was a preacher at Great Mosque of Kauman Yogyakarta. His mother was Siti Aminah, a daughter of K.H. Ibrahim who worked as a high rank official in Yogyakarta.\n\n• Young Darwis was famous for his skills in making handicraft and toys. Similar to other boys, he was also good at flying kite and spinning a top.\n\n• He learned advanced Islam in his teenage life. He learned fiqh(the legal foundation of Islam) from K.H. Muhamad Saleh and nahwu(grammar) from K.H. Abdul Hamid in Lempuyangan and K.H. Muhammad Nur.\n\n• Before making the pilgrimage to Mecca, kinds of books Dahlan read were mostly Ahlussunnah wal jamaah’s books of aqaid (faith), fiqh books of Imam Syafii’s school of thought, and tasawuf(Islamic mysticism) books of Imam Gazali.\n\n1883-88\n\n• Muhammad Darwis made the first pilgrimage to Mecca. In the holy land, he learned a lot from ulema (Islamic scholars). He learned hadits (sayings and deeds of Prophet Muhammad) from Kyai Mahfudh Termas and Syekh Khayat, qiraah (Al Quran recitation) from Syekh Amien and Sayid Bakri Syatha, and falaq (astronomy) from K.H. Dahlan Semarang. He also learned from Syekh Hasan about overcoming animal toxin. Besides those gurus, for eight months he engaged in social life with Syekh Akhmad Khatib and Syekj Jamil Jambek from Minangkabau, Kyai Najrowi from Banyumas, Kyai Nawawi from Banten, ulema from Arab, and new thought he learned during his living in Mecca.\n\n1888\n\n• Coming back from first pilgrimage, he spent half of trading capital worth f 500 given by his father to buy books.\n\n1889\n\n• Ahmad Dahlan married Siti Walidah who was later known as Nyai Ahmad Dahlan. She was the founder of Aisyiyah, a women organization.\n\n1896\n\n• His father who worked as a preacher passed away. In accordance with the custom of Yogyakarta Royal Palace, Ahmad Dahlan, as the oldest son, replaced his father’s position as a preacher.\n\n1898\n\n• Dahlan invited 17 ulema around Yogyakarta to discuss about the direction of Kaabah in Mecca (kiblat) at his family’s prayer house in Kauman. Kiblat was a sensitive problem at the time. The discussion lasted till dawn without reaching agreement. A few days later, however, two people who listened to the discussion made a white line with a thickness of 5 cm in front of prayer leader’s area at Great Mosque in Kauman. The line changed kiblat, so it alarmed people coming for dzuhur (noon) prayer. H.M. Kholil Kamaludiningrat, the Kyai Penghulu (head of mosque), ordered to erase the line and to find the doers.\n\n1900-1910\n\n• The charity (zakat) committee.\n\n• The first animal sacrifice (kurban) committee.\n\n• Using hisab (mathematic) method to replace aboge method and moon observation\n\n• Kyai A. Dahlan’s prayer house was torn down.\n\n1903\n\n• Ahmad Dahlan made the second pilgrimage to Mecca. He learned again from the gurus having taught him during his first pilgrimage to deepen his Islamic theology. He learned fiqh from Syekh Saleh Bafadal, Syekh Sa’id Yamani, and Syekh Sa’id Babusyel. He learned hadis from Mufti Syafii, falaq from Kyai Asy’ari Bawean and qiraat from Syekh Ali Misri Makkah. During his residing in Mecca, furthermore, Dahlan had close relationship with Indonesian ulema who had lived in Saudi Arabia for long time to discuss about social-religious problems, including the problems happening in Indonesia. The ulema were Syekh Ahmad Khatib, Kyai Nawawi from Banten, Kyai Mas Abdullah from Surabaya, and Kyai Fakih from Maskumambang.\n\n1909\n\n• Ahmad Dahlan officially became the member of Budi Utomo organization.

The first school started with 8 students, located in a living room of his 2.5 m x 6 m house. He acted as a teacher. At the beginning, teaching-learning process did not run well. Apart from a boycott from surrounding people, the eight students were also often absent. Ahmad Dahlan was not reluctant to come to his students’ house and ask them to be back to school.\n\n1911 – 1920\n\nDecember 1, 1911\n\n• The school set up by Ahmad Dahlan was announced officially and named Madrasah Ibtidaiyah Diniyah Islamiyah.

The proposal was granted in 1914 with Government Decree No. 81 dated August 22, 1914. The permit was given for Yogyakarta area only, and the organization was allowed to run only in Yogyakarta. Dutch colonial government was worried of the organization’s development. Therefore, its activities were limited. Even though Muhammadiyah movement was restricted, its new branches appeared in some areas such as Srandakan, Wonosari, and Imogiri. This was absolutely in conflict with the decision of the colonial government. To solve the problem, KH Ahmad Dahlan urged that Muhammadiyah branches outside Yogyakarta use different name, for example, Nurul Islam in Pekalongan, Al Munir in Ujung Pandang, Ahmadiyah in Garut. An organization named Sidiq Amanah Tabligh Fathonah (SATF) that was lead by Muhammadiyah branch appeared in Solo. Inside Yogyakarta, KH Ahmad Dahlan urged people to set up organization and association to study Islam and act in favor of Islam.

They blamed Muhammadiyah for attacking established ideology (traditional-conservative) and said that Muhammadiyah set up new mazhad (schools of thought in Islam) beyond the four existing and established mazhab. They also blamed Muhammadiyah for having intention to make new interpretation of Al Qur’an, and according to traditional-orthodox it was strictly forbidden. Responding to the accusation, Ahmad Dahlan said, “Muhammadiyah aspires to raise Islam from underdevelopment. Many Muslims revere ulema’s interpretation more than they do to Al Qur’an and Hadis. We have to directly learn from the sources, not only from interpretation books.\n\n• Sutan Mansur’s thinking restlessness for change and reform found its answer when he talked with Ahmad Dahlan who often came to Pekalongan for preaching. Through the interaction, he finally joined Muhammadiyah (1922) and set up Perkumpulan Nurul Islam in Pekalongan along with traders from Maninjau who had joined Muhammadiyah earlier. In Muhammadiyah, he found that Islam was not simply the knowledge by knowing and understanding its laws in detail as taught in Minangkabau, but there should be an effort to put it into practice.
