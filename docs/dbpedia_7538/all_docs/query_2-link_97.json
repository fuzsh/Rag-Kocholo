        "text": "\"The key is on us, the leaders. Because leaders are responsible for everything. The black and white of Muhammadiyah's movement, its progress or decline, depends on us as leaders,\" said the General Chair of the Muhammadiyah Central Leadership Haedar Nashir in his speech for the 107th Anniversary of Aisyiyah, on Sunday (19/5/2024), in Surakarta, Central Java.\n\nAlso read: Muhammadiyah and National Politics\n\nAccording to Haedar, the leaders who determine progress are those who always have the spirit and soul of a movement. \"It's not the leaders who are in a comfortable zone with complicated organizational bureaucratization,\" said Haedar at the event broadcasted live on the Youtube channel.\n\nThe black and white of the Muhammadiyah movement, the progress and decline of Muhammadiyah, depends on us as leaders.\n\nHaedar conveyed this during his explanation of Muhammadiyah and Aisyiyah's vision for internationalization. Currently, Aisyiyah already has kindergartens in Cairo, Egypt, and also in Malaysia. Muhammadiyah also has schools in Australia. All of these efforts are the initial milestones that must be capitalized on by the leaders of Muhammadiyah and Aisyiyah.\n\nHowever, to be able to achieve this, Haedar reminded that there are many challenges that must be faced. The landscape of social and global changes that are so complex and the increasing competition require Aisyiyah to be truly progressive.\n\nBefore Haedar delivered his speech, the General Chairperson of PP Aisyiyah outlined various humanitarian and social crisis issues that occurred both globally and nationally. At the global level, she mentioned the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Palestine conflict, various crises that resulted in food and refugee issues, as well as the climate emergency affecting many regions in the world.\n\nAlso read: Climate Emergency and Alarm for Humanity\n\nIn his speech, Haedar stated that Muhammadiyah is truly proud of and has great hopes for all the efforts and actions of Aisyiyah that have crossed boundaries and transcended time. Aisyiyah's movement is not only present in urban centers, but also reaches remote villages and farthest regions, even overseas.\n\n\"We are also convinced that Aisyiyah is a strategic pillar of the women's movement, not only for the Muhammadiyah women's movement, but also for the Islamic women's movement, the women's movement in Indonesia. Even for the world's women's movement, which continues to take enlightening steps and enlighten the lives of human beings,\" he said.\n\nDuring the occasion, Haedar reiterated the history of the journey of the Aisyiyah movement since its establishment in 1917 until several decades later. The embryo of Aisyiyah was named Sopo Tresno, which was initiated by Kiai Ahmad Dahlan and his wife, Siti Walidah.\n\nAlso read: Aisyiyah and the Figure of Fatmawati\n\nThis movement was a study group that existed from 1914-1917 until it became part of Muhammadiyah. In 1923, Aisyiyah became an autonomous organization and continues to be so until today.\n\nHaedar also explained the women figures around Kiai Ahmad Dahlan who became the driving force behind the Aisyiyah movement, such as Siti Walidah, Siti Bariyah, and Siti Badilah, who have given color to the movement since its early existence. He quoted the view of Nyai Walidah who said, \"Women in the kitchen should not forget the struggle in society.\"\n\n\"At that time, in the world of women in Indonesia, there was a conservative view rooted in religion and tradition where women were limited to the domestic sphere and not allowed in public spaces. This is what is called tradition and religious beliefs that are holding back women,\" said Haedar.\n\nAlso read: Momentum to Appreciate Women's Struggle from Time to Time\n\nFrom the start, according to him, Aisyiyah in the context of values ​​and belief systems has taken the position of wasatiyah (middle way), but wasatiyah which is forward-thinking or progressive. Because, Aisyiyah is present in the midst of a dialectic of thoughts and values ​​between those who tend to be conservative and liberal.\n\nAs is known, after the Dutch Ethical Policy of 1887, modern Western ideas began to enter through education that could then be followed by Indonesian political elites.\n\nReproduction of values\n\nThose values, according to Haedar, must be continuously maintained and enriched. He hopes that with the 107th anniversary of Aisyiyah, all cadres can enrich and understand these values so that they can continue to reproduce them as living values that move and become the lifeblood of the movement.\n\nThe General Chairman of PP Aisyiyah, Salmah Orbayinah, revealed that Islam provides equal opportunities for men and women to achieve a good life and good rewards. This has encouraged Aisyiyah women to pursue knowledge and technology.\n\nAlso read: Women's Struggle Still Long\n\nThe Aisyiyah women are also encouraged to play a role in public spaces, actualizing their full potential and deeds, and carving a civilization in all aspects of life. This is to realize a just, prosperous, dignified, and sovereign nation's civilization.\n\nThis necessitates social and humanitarian preaching as an integral and inseparable part of all Aisyiyah preaching movements. However, Salmah revealed that entering the second century of Aisyiyah's existence, the preaching movement of this Muhammadiyah women's organization has a very different idea and approach.\n\nBecause, preaching is no longer a scary thing. Da'wah actually strengthens differences and equates steps with collaboration and communication.\n\n\"Aisyiyah spreads da'wah that fosters good, noble morals, pious deeds, and all activities that provide benefits and benefits to the wider community without discrimination. \"So, Aisyiyah's presence really spreads grace lil alamin or grace to the universe,\" said Salmah.\n\nAlso read: Promoting \"Wasathiyah\" Islam\n\nAisyiyah, with its enlightening preaching, also advocates and pioneers a movement for peaceful, healthy, clean and noble civilized living. This is a collective culture of the ummah and society.\n\nAlso read: Islam \"Wasatiyah\", the Path of National Progress\n\nIn national politics, Aisyiyah spreads noble enlightenment values through the dissemination of messages and the development of a national attitude based on the values of truth and goodness, moderation, peace, tolerance, honesty, democracy, and noble character. The goal is to bring Indonesia to unite, be sovereign, dignified, fair, prosperous, and progressive.\n\n\"The Aisyiyah Movement at all levels is required to become more responsive in understanding and providing solutions to social issues, particularly those related to family, children, and women. Aisyiyah must also become a religious force that provides education and serves as a moral guide enlightening the millennial generation who live in the midst of complex social changes and challenges,\" he said."
