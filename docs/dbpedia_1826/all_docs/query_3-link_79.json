        "text": "2 things - 1. The name Eltham reminded me of Gotham! 2. Ever since University days, Art History has always been one of my favourite subjects and that's one of the main reasons for my love towards Indian heritage. Coming to London, I'm looking at English heritage now. So, when a place under English heritage is known for its art from Art Deco movement - I had to see the place!!!\n\nStarting with a bit of its history. Eltham palace is known from 11th C CE. It was then belonging to Odo, who was the Bishop of Bayeux. By 1295, after passing through several hands, it reached the Bishop of Durham by the end of 13th C CE. He was the one who made this into a palatial fort with a moat around. This was passed on to Edward II. He and his father stayed here often and his son 'John of Eltham' was born here.\n\nThroughout 14th & 15th C this was one of the most important royal residences. By 16th C, during the reign of Henry VIII, the importance reduced as he preferred Hampton. By 17th C, due to lack to maintenance, it started to wither and was used as a farm. It was then in 1933 when millionaires Stephen and Virginia Courtauld spotted this property and decided to take it in a 99yr lease and make it suit their taste with art-deco features and original fort features combined!\n\nAs soon as you enter is a circular main room, or that's what I thought. Its actually a triangular room with curved sides and steps on all corners! The roof has dome filled with lights with glass around each light, so daylight can seem through. The wall has a black bean veneer panel filled with detailing in wooden inlay work in various colored wood!\n\nThe dining room is on one side and its door is filled with textured animal designs inspired by London zoo! The walls are also textured. There are little rooms for kitchen, servants room, telephone room etc.\n\nThe boudoir and library are here as well. There are so many books here, esp an entire section for India and that's so interesting! The library has an inbuilt sofa and shelf.\n\nAfter this is the huge room called Great Hall which was built in 15th C. The curved roof is just magnificent. The room was originally used to entertain guests.\n\nThe walls are covered with old jacquard curtains and the room has several wooden engraved, detailed furniture. Certain sections of the wall, has some mind blowing stained glass painting! This room also had a mini wardrobe of the art-deco clothing which could be tried on!!!\n\nIn the first floor are a couple of bedrooms with attached bathrooms, some guest rooms & bathrooms and maid rooms as well. There is a room which is under renovation called a Map Room which has maps pasted and various travel paintings all over - a travel blogger's dream room it is!\n\nThe basement was very interesting! It had a prototype of the original central heating system. The basement also has a darkroom for photo development. There is also a bunker which may have been used as a hideout during the World War. This room was also filled with war memorabilia incl soldiers' uniforms & hats! Best part, beside this was a mirror and these clothes could be tried on!!! Also the basement has a billiards room.\n\nThe garden around was just awesome. A section of the garden has some Greek Ionic column styled pillars as well! A moat all around the palace is today filled with water and fountain making it so picturesque. Best part its filled with so many huge fishes and luckily I had some peanuts that day with me to snack and it ended up being the snack of the fishes!\n\nThe South moat is not filled and proves to be a beautiful green pasture of land today with a wooden bridge across! Some places have the original excavated medieval structures in ruins. On the wall behind is a bronze sculpture of St.David.\n\nBtw, some other buildings here in Eltham are also interesting! This Parish church and this police station are some fine examples. Also at the same distance as this is, from the railway station on the opposite side is Severndroog Castle, which I sadly missed coz by the time I came out of the palace, castle was closed!\n\nEntrance to the property is at £14.50 for single adult and its free for English Heritage members about which I've explained here.\n\nTo reach there:\n\nNearest railway station: Eltham (South Eastern railways serve this route)\n\nP.S: Check out here to know what I wore to this place.\n\nDedicated to Venkat\n\nBhushavali\n\nAn ardent traveler by passion. Being an ex - Art History Teacher, my area of interest especially lies in Nature and Heritage. Visited 85 UNESCO World Heritage sites as of June 2022. I've been listed among the Top 7 Women Travel Bloggers of India, Top 50 in UK. I have been interviewed in a couple of TV Shows, Radio Channels and Events as well. Read more about me and read the testimonials of different brands\n\nDid you come here for this?\n\nIndian Soldiers of WW1 in Belgium\n\nLet's play Belgian Bingo\n\nSUPPORT MY TRAVELOGUE!\n\nIt costs less than a cuppa coffee!\n\nPowered by Blogger."
