        "meta_description": "HISTORY OF ELTHAM PALACE AND GARDENS\n\t\n\tEltham is a unique marriage between a medieval and Tudor palace and a 1930s millionaire’s mansion. From the 14th to the 16th century it was an important royal palace, where successive monarchs stayed frequently and hunted in the surrounding parks. Edward IV built its magnificent great hall, with its soaring hammerbeam roof and bay windows. After centuries of neglect, in 1933 Eltham was leased to Stephen and Virginia Courtauld, who set about building an up-to-the-minute house that incorporated the great hall. A masterpiece of 20th-century design, it was lavishly decorated in an eclectic range of styles. The Courtaulds also transformed the grounds, which today, like the house, are an intriguing mix of 1930s design and medieval remains.\n\t\n\tA MOATED MANOR\n\tLittle is known of any settlement on the site until the Domesday survey of 1086, when the manor of Eltham is recorded as belonging to Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror.[1]\n\t\n\tThe estate changed hands several times until 1295 when Anthony Bek, Bishop of Durham, acquired it. He seems to have rebuilt the manor house, and constructed a defensive perimeter wall of stone and brick within the line of the moat.[2]\n\t\n\tA cellar and the remains of Bek’s great hall with an octagonal stone hearth and elaborate tiled floor were excavated in the 1970s.[3] A timber drawbridge, probably on the site of the present north bridge, led to the manor house.\n\t\n\tROYAL PALACE\n\tBek presented the manor to the future Edward II in 1305, though he lived there until his death in 1311. Both Edward and his father had frequently stayed at Eltham.\n\t\n\tEdward II later granted the manor to his queen, Isabella. During his reign considerable improvements were made, including the construction of a new retaining wall around Bek’s, with buttresses to support the earlier masonry.[4] Edward and Isabella’s second son, John, was born at Eltham in 1316 and baptised in the chapel there. He was known as John of Eltham.\n\t\n\tBy the early 14th century Eltham had become one of the largest and most frequented royal residences in the country. Edward III (r.1327–77) spent much of his youth there and frequently visited it as king. In 1364 he received John II of  France (1319–64) at the palace amid ‘great dancing and caroling’ when John returned to voluntary captivity in England. John was accompanied by his secretary Jean Froissart, who subsequently recorded the event in his lively Chronicles and described Eltham as ‘a very magnificent manor’.[5]\n\t\n\tExtensive alterations and repairs were made in the 1350s and 1360s. The moat walls were altered again, and a new drawbridge and service buildings were built. New royal lodgings on the east side of the site featured a bathroom for the king with a tiled floor and glazed windows. There are references at this time to chapels for the king and queen and to a garden with vines.\n\t\n\t<a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/eltham-palace-and-gardens/history/?gclid=Cj0KEQjw0tCuBRDIjJ_Mlb6zzpQBEiQAyjCoBgcxvHRvs1Qy6nT7HQxsS63Cvb_soanIv3gc9zfdd-saAqqv8P8HAQ&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow\">www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/eltham-palace-an...</a>",
