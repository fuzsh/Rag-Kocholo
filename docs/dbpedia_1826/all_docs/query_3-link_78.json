        "text": "The Greenwich, Eltham & Chislehurst Conservative Federation is saddened to announce the passing of Councillor John Hills, Conservative Councillor for Mottingham, Coldharbour and New Eltham ward, on Wednesday 24th April 2024 after a period of illness.\n\nCouncillor John Hills was first elected to the Council at a by-election for New Eltham ward in 2000, and then subsequently re-elected in six consecutive elections - most recently to represent the new Mottingham, Coldharbour and New Eltham ward in 2022. A former member of the Armed Forces, Councillor Hills additionally served as the Council's Armed Forces representative.\n\nWith 24 years of continuous service on the Council, he was one of the most experienced ward councillors in the borough. His service included periods as Opposition Group Whip and Opposition Spokesperson for Health and Adult Social Care, a subject he was passionate about.\n\nOver the course of his long service to the community, Councillor Hills served as a school governor and as Chair of the Community Association of New Eltham (CANE) - and his tireless devotion to casework and helping residents in the ward he represented for so long made him a hugely popular and respected figure in the borough.\n\nCouncillor Hills made an enormous contribution to the work of the Conservative Party in the borough for the last quarter of a century, including serving as the President of the Greenwich Conservative Federation for 15 years.\n\nCouncillor Matt Hartley, Leader of Greenwich Conservatives and John's ward colleague for the last 10 years, said: “John was one of the most modest and unassuming people you could ever meet, and yet his contribution to public life in our borough was immense. He worked tirelessly for the area that he represented for an incredible 24 continuous years.\n\n\"John will be missed by so many residents across Mottingham, New Eltham and the Coldharbour Estate who he helped over that time - and by all of us who were lucky enough to call him a friend.\n\n“In his own quiet way, John was a giant of Greenwich politics - universally liked and respected - and unfailingly kind and generous with his support and encouragement to others. At this difficult time, all of our thoughts are with John’s loving family, who were the centre of his world.\"\n\nRoger Tester, Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Federation and a former council ward colleague of John's in Coldharbour & New Eltham ward, said: \"I really enjoyed working with John for many years as a councillor and also a close friend and wonderful colleague. John's character and sense of humour shone through in everything he did. His hard work for the ward he served for 24 years was something that everyone admired and respected.\n\n\"I learned so much from John's commitment to his residents and helping them with problems. He leaves behind a legacy that will never be forgotten. All of our thoughts are with John's wife, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren who he was completely devoted to.\""
