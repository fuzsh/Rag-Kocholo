        "text": "Here is my version of Sir John of Eltham in 54 mm\n\nThe figure is pretty much the stock figure.\n\nI have however removed the original sword blade, then carefully drilled the hilt of the sword and then inserted a new stainless steel blade (made in Russia).\n\nThis figure is my first one painted with acrylics. Inks & some oils were used for the metallic parts.\n\nThe sculpture on this figure is amazing for a 54 mm figure and I'm very proud of the result\n\nBase is raw wenge wood\n\nPlease don't hesitate to comment, including positive and negative remarks.\n\nI have also upgraded my camera and shots were taken with an Olympus OM-D EM5 camera.\n\nLast picture is of the box art.\n\nCheers\n\nAlex\n\nAttached Files:\n\nP1020234small.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n488.7 KB\n\nViews:\n\n596\n\nP1020235small.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n452.7 KB\n\nViews:\n\n634\n\nP1020236small.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n502.4 KB\n\nViews:\n\n606\n\nP1020237small.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n469.9 KB\n\nViews:\n\n605\n\nP1020238small.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n477.3 KB\n\nViews:\n\n600\n\nP1020239small.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n489.6 KB\n\nViews:\n\n692\n\nsirjohnofelthamenglandxiv54mm.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n73.5 KB\n\nViews:\n\n601\n\nThis is great mate an excellent paint job on such a small figure, a minor detail/choice is I'd have maybe expanded the base/groundwork a little it looks kinda \"perched\" on the wooden part other than that it's top notch stuff Alex, could you go into more detail re the sword blade that sounds an interesting bit of work is there a website or supplier ?\n\nSteve\n\nYes I see what you mean for the base. At first I was actually not going to even add a wood base since I'm also a 'heavy' collector of 54 mm miniatures and most of them have no wood bases. Next time, I will however extend the groundwork to the limits of the wood part.\n\nThe blade is made by a metalsmith in St Petersburg, Russia and I have bought it from Kolobob on eBay. It's not cheap but all my russian miniatures have stainless steel blades. They are sharp, can't bend and really look like the real thing.\n\nCheers Alex they do look good for sure, as I said it was only an IMO on the base but I think it will look better. Look forward to your next work\n\nSteve\n\nHey Alex\n\nThis is realy a good paintjob and that for your first attempt with acrylics. wish I was that good at my beginning.\n\nThey figure stand out with your outstanding highlights and schadows en detail work.\n\ncompliments for you and your little buddy.\n\nGreetings Dick"
