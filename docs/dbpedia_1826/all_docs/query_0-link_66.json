        "text": "When King Charles IV of France died on 1 February 1328, the nearest male heir in line to the throne was King Edward III of England. Through his mother, Isabella of France, who is sister to Charles IV of France. However, the question arose of whether she should be able to transmit a right that she, especially as a woman, did not possess as only men could be monarch.\n\nAn assembly of the French aristocracy decided that the nearest heir through male ancestry was Charles IV’s first cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, and that he should be crowned King Philip VI of France.\n\nThe establishment of succession to the French crown was central to the coming war and Edward III and succeeding generations of English monarchs laying claim to it.\n\nAfter some initial reluctance, seventeen-year-old King Edward III of England and as Duke of Aquitaine, paid homage to King Philip VI of France in 1329.\n\nGascony formed the ancestral core of English, which had been incorporated into Aquitaine. It was located in south west France just north of the Pyrenees, the Gascons had their own language and customs. A large proportion of the red wine (known as claret) that they produced, was shipped in a profitable trade with the English. The trade provided the English King with a lot of revenue. The Gascons preferred their relationship with a distant English King who left them alone, then to a French King who might interfere in their affairs.\n\nDespite Edward III’s homage to Philip VI, the French continued to interfere in Gascony. There had been a series of skirmishes at some of the walled towns along the Gascon border.\n\nAgenais was an area of Gascony in French hands, and the officials there put pressure on the English administration. A chain of religious houses, although in Edward’s jurisdiction, had cases held by French officials. Philip also contracted with various lords within Gascony to provide troops in the event of war with England.\n\nGascony was not the only issue, in the 1330s, France’s support for Scotland caused problems for the English. Loyalties in the low countries were split. In Flanders the towns were dependent on supplies of English wool, whereas the aristocracy supported the Philip VI. Another element was the naval power. Philip had intended to go on a crusade and had assembled a fleet off Marseilles. These plans were abandoned in 1336 and the fleet moved to the English Channel off Normandy in an obvious act of provocation against the English.\n\nOne of Edward’s influential advisers was Robert III of Artois. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out of favour with Philip VI over an inheritance claim.\n\nIn November 1336, Philip issued an ultimatum to the seneschal of Gascony threatening that if Robert of Artois was not extradited to France, then great peril and dissension would follow.\n\nWhen Philip confiscated the Edward’s lands in Gascony and the county of Ponthieu the following year, he laid emphasis on the case of Robert of Artois as one of the contributing causes.\n\nAfter the Tour de Nesle affair, because of it and the death of French Kings to come, the Royal house of Capet was in turmoil.\n\nFollowing the death of King Philip IV of France on 29 November 1314, his eldest son became King Louis X. After the scandal with his wife who he had one daughter with, Louis X remarried to Clementia of Hungary in 1315. She was pregnant with their child when he died on 5 June 1316.\n\nThe question of female succession to the French throne was raised after Louis X death. He left only a daughter, Joan, and it wasn’t until Clementia gave birth to a son on 15 November 1316, John, who only lived and was “King” for five days. Furthermore, the paternity of his daughter was in question, as her mother, Margaret of Burgundy, had been exposed as an adulterer in the Tour de Nesle affair.\n\nLouis X brother Philip, Count of Poitiers, positioned himself to take the crown, advancing the stance that the women should be ineligible to succeed to the French throne. Through his political sagacity he won over his adversaries and succeeded to the French throne as Philip V of France. By the same law he passed to get himself onto the throne, when he died on 3 January 1322, his daughters were denied the succession which then passed to his younger brother, Charles IV.\n\nLike his brother before him, on 1 February 1328 Charles IV died leaving a daughter and a pregnant wife. If the unborn child was male, he would become King of France, if it was a girl, the choice of succession will be up to the nobles.\n\nA girl ended up being born, therefore ending male line of the House of Capet.\n\nBy proximity of blood, the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, Edward III of England. Edward was the son of Isabella, the sister of Louis X, Philip V and Charles IV, but the question rose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. I’m also guessing that they also didn’t want an English King on the throne of France, no matter who his mother is. The French nobility also balked at the prospect of being ruled by Isabella and her lover, Roger Mortimer, who were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English King and her husband, Edward II.\n\nThe assemblies of the French barons and prelates and the University of Paris decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded. Thus, the nearest heir through male ancestry was Isabella’s first cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, and it was decided that he should be crowned Philip VI of France. In 1340 the Avignon papacy confirmed that under Salic Law, males should not be able to inherit through their mothers.\n\nEventually, Edward III of England reluctantly recognised Philip VI and paid him homage for his French fiefs. He made concessions in Guyenne, but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made war on Scotland.\n\nI’ve always been fascinated with the monarchy from the United Kingdom, but since starting this blog, I’ve been learning more about other monarchies.\n\nOne of them is the Swedish monarchy.\n\nI do want to learn more of their history, but I’ll start with the current royal family then work my way back.\n\nThe House of Bernadotte is the current royal house of Sweden, which has reigned since 1818. Also between 1818 and 1905, it was also the royal house of Norway.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Finnish War between the Kingdom of Sweden and the Russian Empire between February 1808 to September 1809, Sweden lost possession of Finland which had constituted roughly the eastern half of the Swedish realm for centuries.\n\nResentment towards King Gustav IV Adolf caused an abrupt coup d’état. Gustav IV Adolf and his son Gustav, was deposed and his uncle Charles XIII was elected King in his place. However, Charles XIII was 61 years old and prematurely senile, and he was also childless. It was apparent as soon as Charles XIII ascended the throne that the Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp would die with him.\n\nIn 1810 the Riksdag of the Estates, the Swedish parliament, elected a Danish prince, Prince Christian August of Augustenborg as heir-presumptive to the throne. He took the name Charles August, but died later that same year.\n\nJean Bernadotte\n\nDuring this time, Emperor Napoleon I of France controlled much of continental Europe and some of his client Kingdoms were headed by his brothers. The Riksdag decided to choose a King of whom Napoleon would approve. On 21 August 1810, the Riksdag elected Jean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, a Marshal of France, as heir presumptive to the Swedish throne.\n\nWhen elected to be Swedish royalty the new heir had been called Prince Bernadotte, according to the promotions he received from Napoleon, culminating in sovereignty over the Principality of Pontecorvo. Some Swedish experts have asserted that all of his male heirs have had the right to use that Italian title, since the Swedish government never made payments promised Charles John to get him to give up his position in Pontecorvo.\n\nSome members of the house who lost their royal status and Swedish titles due to unapproved marriages have also been given the titles Prince Bernadotte and Count of Wisborg in the nobility of other countries.\n\nJean Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, born on 26 January 1763 in Pau, Kingdom of France, had risen to the rank of general during the French Revolution. In 1798 he married Desiree Clary, whose sister was married to Joseph, Napoleon’s elder brother. In 1804 Napoleon promoted Bernadotte to a Marshal of France. Napoleon also granted him the title “Prince of Pontecorvo”.\n\nAs the crown prince of Sweden, he assumed the name Charles John and acted as regent for the remainder of Charles XIII’s reign.\n\nIn 1813, he broke with Napoleon and led Sweden into the anti-Napoleon alliance. When Norway was awarded to Sweden by the Treaty of Kiel, Norway resisted and declared independence, triggering a brief war between Sweden and Norway. The war ended when Bernadotte persuaded Norway to enter into a personal union with Sweden. Instead of being merely a Swedish province, Norway remained an independent Kingdom, though sharing a common monarch and foreign policy. Bernadotte reigned as Charles XIV John of Sweden and Charles III John of Norway from 5 February 1818 until his death on 8 March 1844.\n\nThe House of Bernadotte reigned in both countries until the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905. Prince Carl of Denmark was then elected as King Haakon VII of Norway. Carl was a grandson of King Charles XV of Sweden and a great-great-grandson of Charles XIV.\n\nList of Swedish and Norway Rulers\n\nNext in line is crown princess Victoria then her daughter, princess Estelle."
