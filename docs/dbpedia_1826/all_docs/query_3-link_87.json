        "text": "Eltham is first mentioned in Domesday Book, but Roman remains discovered by archaeologists suggest that the settlement was already nearly a thousand years old. Prosperity came in the Middle Ages with the building of Eltham Palace which was the scene of many celebrations, including the great tournament to celebrate victory at the Battle of Crecy. After Henry VIII the Palace lost its importance but the Crown retained its lands until well into the 20th century. A popular residential area today, it has been home to many people, including W. G. Grace and Bob Hope."
