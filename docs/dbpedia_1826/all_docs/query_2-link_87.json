        "text": "The surname Althem was first found in Lancashire where one of the first record of the name was found in 1246 when Adam de Eluetham held estates in what is now known as Altham in Whalley in that shire. Eltham in Kent was an ancient family seat. \"This place, in Domesday Book called Alteham, is supposed to have derived its name from the Saxon, Eald, old, and Ham, a dwelling. It formed part of the royal demesnes in the reign of Edward the Elder, by whom it was given to Odo, Archbishop of Canterbury; and at a very early period became a favourite retreat of the English kings.\" 1\n\nA few years later, John of Eltham, 1st Earl of Cornwall (1316-1336) born at Eltham Palace, Kent, was the second son of king Edward II of England and his queen Isabella of France, heir to the English throne. \"Edward II. resided here for some time, and at this place also his son was born, from this circumstance called John of Eltham, and the palace, erroneously, King John's Palace.\" 1 He was buried with full honors at Westminster Abbey in January 1337."
