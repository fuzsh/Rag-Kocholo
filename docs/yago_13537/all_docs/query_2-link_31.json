It was made as a co-production between France, Spain and West Germany. The story takes place during World War II in the North African desert at the Battle of El Alamein. Location shooting took place in Almería in Spain. The film's sets were designed by the art director Paul-Louis Boutié.\n\nTaxi for Tobruk\n\nThis is a French film from 1962 directed by Julien Duvivier that consists of seven sketches (eight in the versions shown in Germany and Japan) played by an ensemble cast that includes Michel Simon, Micheline Presle, Françoise Arnoul, Mel Ferrer, Charles Aznavour, Lino Ventura, Fernandel, Alain Delon, Danielle Darrieux, Jean-Claude Brialy, and Louis de Funès.\n\nThe film contrasts a series of human failings with the ever-present hope of redemption and a snake (voiced by Claude Rich) adds the Devil's comments.\n\nUn taxi pour Tobrouk\n\nThe devil and the ten commandments\n\n95 мин\n\nLe Diable et les Dix Commandements\n\ndirector\n\n120 мин\n\nduration\n\ndirector\n\nDenys de La Patellière\n\nduration\n\n1960\n\nJulien Duvivier\n\n1962\n\nTestament of Orpheus (French: Le testament d'Orphée) is a 1960 black-and-white film with a few seconds of color film spliced in. Directed by and starring Jean Cocteau, who plays himself as an 18th-century poet, the film includes cameo appearances by Pablo Picasso, Jean Marais, Charles Aznavour, Jean-Pierre Leaud, and Yul Brynner. It is considered the final part of The Orphic Trilogy, following The Blood of a Poet (1930) and Orphée (1950).\n\nOne critic described it as a \"wry, self-conscious re-examination of a lifetime's obsessions\" with Cocteau placing himself at the center of the mythological and fictional world he spun throughout his books, films, plays and paintings. The film includes numerous instances of \"double takes\", including one scene where Cocteau, walking past himself, looks back to see himself in what was described by one scholar as \"a retrospective on the Cocteau œuvre\".\n\nTestament of Orpheus\n\nLe Testament d'Orphée\n\nIt is a French-Italian comedy that explores the relationships of the youth of the 60s. Mocky draws five portraits of young girls who discover physical love for the first time. As the title suggests, this is a paradoxical and curiously poetic film.\n\n77 мин\n\ndirector\n\nThe virgins\n\nduration\n\nLes vierges\n\nJean Cocteau\n\n85 мин\n\ndirector\n\n1960\n\nduration\n\nJean-Pierre Mocky\n\n1963\n\nFollowing the defeat of France by Germany during World War II, two French soldiers are taken as forced laborers on a German farm.
