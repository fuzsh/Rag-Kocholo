        "text": "Lehigh Valley Vanguard, a web and print based journal, is seeking submissions for our call:\n\nInciting Revolutionary Change\n\nMicah White, one of Occupy Wall Street's founding members, suggests via his 2016 book The End of Protest: A New Playbook for Revolution:\n\n\"Is protest broken? Disruptive tactics have failed to halt the rise of Donald Trump in the upcoming US presidential election. Movements ranging from Black Lives Matter to environmentalism are leaving activists frustrated. Meanwhile, recent years have witnessed the largest protests in human history. Yet these mass mobilizations no longer change society. Now activism is at a crossroads: innovation or irrelevance.\"\n\nProfane Shakespeare\n\nPerfection, Pollution, and the Truth of Performance\n\n“But no perfection is so absolute,\n\nThat some impurity doth not pollute”\n\nRape of Lucrece, l. 899\n\nFor its 33rd issue (Spring 2018), the online peer-reviewed journal Etudes Epistémè (www.episteme.revues.org) seeks articles examining Shakespeare’s treatment of the notions of perfection (or “purity”) and pollution (or “impurity”), understood not only along traditional moral and religious lines, but also, more “profanely”, in aesthetic and hermeneutic terms.\n\nThe peer-reviewed, online and open access journal Studies in Testimony is now accepting submissions for its first issue. The first call for submissions is intentionally broad in nature, allowing for submissions that look at emerging areas of academic interest, in addition to those of continued and lasting relevance from a wide range of academic disciplines.\n\nSubject areas could include, but are certainly not limited to:\n\nHolocaust testimony\n\nTestimony in the digital age\n\nPost-colonial testimony\n\nHybrid forms of testimony\n\nThe conference “Visual design: the periodical page as a designed surface”is concerned with the visual design of the Journal, taken to mean the whole spectrum of periodical print publications, including amongst others newspapers and magazines. Interest is thus focused on the periodical page (or double-page spread) as a visible printed surface on which words and images appear in a designed context. The premise is that the written and pictorial content of the periodical are not realized in abstraction (as disembodied and placeless), but remain tied to the materiality of the periodical, which provides for a two-dimensional and sequential arrangement of diverse visual elements."
