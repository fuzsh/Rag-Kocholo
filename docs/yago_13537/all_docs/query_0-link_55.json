        "text": "Rating :\n\n★★★★\n\nRead\n\n2123 times\n\nhas seen the movie in a theater on the 11/02/2017\n\nGeorge Lachaunaye (BOURVIL) is an aristocrat, descendant of a long line of nobility. But since the Revolution, family affairs have only deteriorated and when Mr. Father (Jean YONNEL) played on the stock market, his family found itself in a very embarrassing situation, and its members very embarrassed.\n\nIt must be said that by centuries-old tradition, no one works for the Lachaunaye. We don't work, but we pray. And one day when the situation is desperate, Georges asks heaven to make a gesture.\n\nAnd Heaven answers him: he will help himself in the trunks of the churches.\n\nOf course, we are in a gently iconoclastic film (it is the fifth by Jean-Pierre MOCKY). We find the duo of La Jument verte (Claude AUTANT-LARA, 1959) but in opposition. Because while Georges is at his work, Inspector Cucherat (Francis BLANCHE, already a regular with the director) is in pursuit.\n\nThis is Mocky’s first foray into the world of religion. We are witnessing a rather immoral story, if we look at it from the point of view of the Law, but which is very pleasing when we listen to Georges' arguments. It is also this opposition that the scenario is nourished by: but this immorality is all the better because the star is Bourvil. There is in the latter a mixture of honesty and false candor that is quite pleasing. He happily pillages the trunks but becomes indignant when someone else does it in his place or when his friend Raoul (Jean POIRET, another Mocky regular) helps himself from a lady's bag.\n\nMocky has been criticized, reproached and will always be reproached for his anarchism and his iconoclasm, but we must still admit that this is a very pleasant film. The presence of the Bourvil-Blanche duo helped make it a commercial success, which was not always the case for the director. He will reprise his duet twice more: La Grande laundry (!) (1968) and L Étalon (1969).\n\nBut what do the reproaches matter? His comedy holds up and it unfolds for our greatest pleasure. We have as much fun as the actors in this offbeat comedy. Different from the others that were proposed to us, where strength remained in Law and Morality.\n\nBut from the start, Mocky had warned the spectators, just to protect themselves in advance (and also perhaps with a certain good hypocrisy), that the character we were going to follow was not someone normal .\n\nThis story is, however, very nice when we compare it to the other film which will touch this same Catholic environment: The Miraculous (1986). Here, Mocky does not denounce yet.\n\nBut this is another story. Let’s savor this film – in black and white, with the dream scene in color – as it should be: religiously, of course!\n\nPS: This film is also an opportunity to find some figures of French cinema in small roles: Bernard LAVALETTE, an eternal ministerial notable, Jean TISSIER, Cucherat's deputy, and Marcel PÉRÈS, head of the brigade, as well as Jean-Claude RÉMOLEUX, with such characteristic diction, faithful interpreter of Mocky, just like the essential Dominique ZARDI.\n\nRating :\n\n★★★★★\n\nRead\n\n2547 times\n\nhas seen on TV on the 03/13/2023\n\n1963: Jean Pierre Mocky achieves one of his greatest successes with this \"DrÃ´le de Paroissien\", a vitriolic comedy. Bourvil (who will become his favorite actor over time) Francis Blanche and Jean Poiret are - among others - in the cast. A story out of time:\n\nAt the \"Lachaunaye\", a bourgeois Parisian family of ruined Aristocrats, we have really hit rock bottom. It's hard to eat when there's an institution that's passed down from father to son and that you can't derogate from. NEVER Get up in the morning to go to work. Also the Catholic son George - and yes - after meditating at length in a church has a divine revelation. He knows how to earn money easily, especially without setting foot in the stirrup. He will be a plunderer of trunks...\n\nAn inventive scenario but with Mocky I'm not too surprised. Still had to think about it. A funny and picturesque satire but which deserves attention. Our brave parishioner, always elegantly dressed, started from nothing (history obliges) with a simple soft caramel and who goes into high gear finding more and more ingenious stratagems. The clamp, the miniature vacuum cleaner, is equipped like a professional and even takes an assistant Raoul the dentist (J.P) who very recite at the beginning ends up accepting and taking a liking to it. Over here the currency. Her greatest adversary and enemy: The asthmatic Inspector Cucherat, well coated and his brigade of incompetent policemen constantly picks her up. But not George who continues his momentum and goes up the slope of the whole family. It's all quite inventive and fun. Jean Pierre Mocky orchestrates all of this with brio, foams the churches of all Paris making the inventory and the history of the trunks. Add a bistro and one or two buildings and close the bench. Not stupid friends. Well filmed, simple but effective. The immense talent of the actors will do the rest. Once again Bourvil will fly over the debates. AWESOME.\n\nCahill your northern sheriff"
