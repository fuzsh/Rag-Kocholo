        "text": "Jean-Pierre Mocky, a fiercely independent French filmmaker whose dozens of movies gleefully skewered what he saw as society’s vices and hypocrisies, died on Aug. 8 at his home in Paris. He was 90 .\n\nHis son, the actor and theater director Stanislas Nordey , said the cause was renal failure.\n\nMr. Mocky was a contemporary of the French New Wave directors François Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard, a longtime friend. Like them, he relied on inexpensive equipment and swift shooting schedules. But his films, unlike theirs, were decidedly more grindhouse than art house. He subverted the perceived sophistication of French cinema and made unapologetically raw films that could alienate critics but draw audiences.\n\nA statement by President Emmanuel Macron called Mr. Mocky “an eternal provocateur,” praised his “irreverent glance” and noted his enduring “anger, indignation and revolt.”\n\nDisdaining studio support, Mr. Mocky churned out low-budget movies on a tight schedule. He made nearly 70 feature-length films, many of which he wrote, acted in and tried to finance on his own.\n\nHe could be a firebrand on French talk shows, given to tirades against social injustice and the film industry. For a time he owned a theater in Paris, where he would show his films when other movie houses would not.\n\nHis films fit no one category. They included satires, farces and thrillers, all of which could push the boundaries of good taste. They assailed religion, government, romantic relationships, and other social institutions and conventions.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
