        "text": "1986\n\n1 hr 22 mins\n\nNR\n\nWatchlist\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nThe black humor of director (and lead actor) Jean-Pierre Mocky takes over in this attempt to make a lunatic killer appear not so different from his victims -- or the police chasing him. Ralph Enger (Mocky) was a doctor before he was institutionalized, and after his escape, he takes two hostages: Steff Muller (Peter Semler), an out-of-work carpenter selling his expensive Mauser for needed funds, and Liliane (Patricia Barzyk), a gorgeous dancer. Ralph not only gets two hostages, he gains a weapon at the same time. His goal is to force the wealthy nerds living in the Riviera's luxury district to put up funding for a children's hospital to treat kids who are victims of war. When the elite do not comply, he starts uses the Mauser. Leaving an obvious trail for the police to follow, the over-the-edge doctor and his two hostages are soon corralled and it looks like Ralph's charity work may have ended -- or at least, that's how it looks."
