        "text": "Born on July 6, 1933, in Nice, in the south of the country, into a family of Jewish origin, Jean-Paul Adam Mokiejewski –his full name– studied law before becoming interested in dramatic art. He debuted as an actor, first in the play “Les Casse-pieds” (1948) by Jean Dréville, but later moved to the cinema, with titles such as Orfeo (1950) by Jean Cocteau , Le Gorille vous salue bien (1957) by Bernard Borderie , and The Vanquished , by Michelangelo Antonioni , with which he achieved some popularity, especially in Italy.\n\nAfter acting as assistant director to Luchino Viscont i in Senso (1954) and to Federico Fellini in La strada (1954), he made his debut as a screenwriter with La cabeza contra la pared (1959) which he did not direct himself, because against his wishes, the producer decided to enlist Georges Franju . Despite everything, he shoots his debut, Les dragueurs , the following year.\n\nJean-Pierre Mocky achieves success in his country with the comedies Un drôle de paroissien and La Grande Lessive . But after May 1968, her cinema deepens, with titles like Solo , where she portrays young terrorists from the extreme left, Bonsoir , where a lesbian pretends to have a boyfriend to save her inheritance from her homophobic relatives, À mort l’arbitre , about soccer violence, and El milagro , which denounces scammers who take advantage of those who make the pilgrimage to Lourdes. In these last two he recruits Michel Serrault , his fetish actor, as the protagonist.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, his films hardly had an impact, but he shot at a good pace, sometimes four or five titles a year. He continues to act as an actor in titles such as Mal genio , from 2017. He became a regular on television sets, as a left-wing commentator in colloquiums. In 1994 he bought Le Brady, his own movie theater, where he mostly screened his own works. In 2010 he received the prix Henri-Langlois for his entire career and the prix Alphonse-Allais in 2013."
