        "text": "Born in the French region of Normandy, Marion quickly became passionate about cinema and at the age of 15, she decided to dedicate her life to it. Marion began by studying film and cinema at the University of Nanterre, in France. After graduating she headed for London in order to improve her English. There she met Tim Burton and Deep Roy who encouraged her to carry on in this field. Upon her return to Paris, Marion trained as an actress and screen play writer. In addition, she followed the training courses made by Jack Waltzer  Dustin Hoffman's coach  still in London.\n\nShe took the part of the \"Projet Toroto\" from the French senior maverick movie director Jean-Pierre Mocky and plays the main female lead in Matthias Meilland's \"The Deadly Death\". She then went on to work with young foreign directors such as YupicaGaiano, the Japanese-born director of \"Picolin\", as well as Pol Rodrigues, the Spanish Catalan director of \"Tu seras vivant\" (\"You will be alive\").\n\nIn 2012, Marion made her first short movie called \"Accords Perdus\" (\"Solo\" is the title in English) which was selected for screening in several French festivals. Following the success of ''Accords Perdus'' including public demand, she has started to work on the long version of \"Accords Perdus\". Currently Marion is also working on her first \"documentary called \"Les autruches ne font pas des bébés\" (\"Ostriches do not make babies\").\n\nBiography\n\nShowreel\n\nPortfolio\n\nMovies\n\nContact"
