        "text": "Career\n\nIn his comic performances Bourvil principally played roles of gentle and well-meaning characters who were often a bit obtuse or naÃ¯ve, such as his roles opposite the hyperactive, dishonest and bossy ones played by Louis de FunÃ¨s. Bourvil's characters not only managed to make viewers laugh, but also to save themselves, often unwittingly, from the Machiavellian designs of his adversaries.\n\nBourvil was, however, also capable of more dramatic roles such as the handyman in L'Arbre de NoÃ«l (1969). In this role he observes the relationship between a man he works for and the young son who has fallen ill. The audience can identify with the character played by Bourvil, just as they can in his comic roles, so often as a simple man. One can also note his role of Monsieur ThÃ©nardier in the film adaptation of Les MisÃ©rables (1958), and his last role as the policeman Mattei in Jean-Pierre Melville's Le Cercle rouge (1970)."
