        "text": "THE AGITATOR: THREE PROVOCATIONS FROM THE WORLD OF JEAN-PIERRE MOCKY\n\n4 stars\n\nRadiance Films. Limited Edition Blu ray. 1st July\n\nRadiance continue to surprise with releases from all corners of the filmic world – I have to admit I had never heard of Jean-Pierre Mocky, but looking at his credits, he was a prolific filmmaker and was not only a director. He was also an actor, writer, producer, editor and has many credits within cinema.\n\nLITAN (1982)\n\nThis is probably the film in this set that most closely aligns with the sensibilities of Dark Side, being a weird, sort of folk horror.\n\nIt opens with random imagery – a band playing, silver masks, bright red jackets intercut with various other oddities, as a woman, Nora (Marie José Nat) observes and screams. She awakens from this nightmare and tries to contact her lover Jock (played by director Mocky). Told he is at the Black Rocks she rushes to find him. Outside there is a thick fog. Everything is surreal and odd. Folk in masks rushing about. As she waits for a bus, a man is crushed to death by a van!\n\nShe flags down the vehicle carrying the band from her dream as men in fez’s carry a silver coffin. The transport breaks down and she continues on foot. Meanwhile a troop of Boy Scouts are chasing a “monster” (one of them in yet another mask).\n\nAll this in the opening minutes of this freaky film.\n\nLocating her boyfriend she tells him she thought he was dead – but are her visions actually premonitions of what is to come?\n\nAs things progress everything gets weirder and more abstract. Dreamlike scenes collide with each other, to give a sense that all is not right in Litan… as the townspeople celebrate a special day of the dead. What does it all mean? Does it matter?\n\nThe film, shot by Edmond Richard, looks fabulous on this Blu ray – even if it doesn’t make a lot of sense and feels wilfully abstract. The groovy music by Nino Ferrer is at times jaunty and sometimes is wholly inappropriate to what is happening on screen. The locations are well chosen – it was shot in Annonay in France.\n\nKILL THE REFEREE (A mort l’arbitre!) (1984)\n\nThis is a horror of a more realistic kind as it explores football hooliganism and the violence that can engender.\n\nWhen their team lose the European Cup due to a penalty, the fans blame the referee Maurice (Eddy Mitchell). Instead of taking their gripes to the pub, one group of fans decide to take things to the next level.\n\nLead by the particularly nasty Rico (Michel Serrault), they spot the ref on a TV show and crash the studio, to try and get to him. Managing to escape with his girlfriend Martine (Carole Laure), the enraged supporters are soon in pursuit and this leads to both violence and ultimately death.\n\nDirector Mocky plays the ineffectual police superintendent Granowski, who along with his female partner Phillipon (Sophie Moyse) doesn’t do much to prevent what is happening.\n\nFull of despicable and unlikeable characters – even the referee Maurice isn’t a particularly nice chap, this was based on the 1972 novel “The Death Penalty” and can be seen as a criticism of how fanatical football supporters can be – with this positing a complete breakdown of any morals. It shows how quickly things can get out of hand, though some of the actions by the group are almost comical. The odd music by Alain Chamfort undercuts the effectiveness of some of the action. This is social commentary mixed in with a thriller.\n\nEddy Mitchell (real name Claude Moine) was a successful French rock n’roll singer in the late 50s, early 60s. Michel Serrault, who is excellent here as the reprehensible Rico, is probably best known for his role in LA CAGE AUX FOLLES (1978), though he had a long and varied career in both theatre and film.\n\nIt looks great on this Blu ray with a crisp image and punchy colours – with special emphasis on the team colour of yellow.\n\nAGENT TROUBLE (1987)\n\nThis a more straightforward affair – a mystery thriller starring Catherine Deneuve as Amanda Weber.\n\nShe works in a museum, and when her nephew Victorien (Tom Novembre) comes to visit, he asks for her help. Whilst out hitchhiking, he had come across a coach stopped by the roadside and found all the passengers on board were dead – seeing an opportunity he purloined their belongings from their pockets and their jewellery, and he now needs somewhere safe to hide them.\n\nIt becomes clear that there is some kind of cover-up in play to hide what happened to the passengers and Victorien is pursued by an assassin Alex (Richard Bohringer). But can Amanda get to the bottom of what is going on?\n\nKristin Scott Thomas appears in an early role as a prostitute.\n\nBased on the novel “The Man Who Loved Zoos” by Malcolm Bosse, this has good cast, headed up by Deneuve and a score by Gabriel Yared that tries to make it appear more exciting than it actually is, as there is never any real sense of tension. More commercial than the other two offerings in this set, it attempts to be Hitchcockian but doesn’t fully succeed, ending up as a middling thriller.\n\nSteve Kirkham\n\nEXTRAS 4 stars\n\nLITAN\n\nSmall Town Masquerade: Love Death and Dreams in Litan – Critic Anton Bitel explores the film and its symbolism.
