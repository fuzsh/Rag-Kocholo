        "text": "Film celebrities, a culture minister and fans have paid homage to Jean-Pierre Mocky, a fiercely independent filmmaker who directed some of France’s most famed actors over a six-decade career.\n\nActor Gerard Depardieu encouraged fans to come and join Monday’s funeral ceremony at the Saint-Sulpice Church in Paris, although he did not go himself.\n\nMocky’s stars also included Catherine Deneuve, Charles Aznavour, Jeanne Moreau and others.\n\nHis age was disputed.\n\nHe was associated with France’s New Wave cinema and he made a mark with his provocative style, though his movies did not achieve great commercial success.\n\nThey included 1963 comedy Un Drole De Paroissien (Heaven Sent) and 1983 drama A Mort L’Arbitre! (Kill The Referee!)"
