Fata Morgana,refers to mirages, an apt title for this storyless, hallucinatory work shot in the Sahara deserts of North Africa.

The Peruvians decide that they want to make their own movie. Not having the necessary film equipment, but plenty of local raw material, the villagers construct the needed cameras, microphones, and sound recorders out of bamboo, and although the equipment is faked, the villagers substitute real, bloody violence for the make-believe violence of Hollywood.\n\nThe Second Coming of Suzanne\n\nUSA 1973\n\nSuzanne (thrice!)

The principle actors are Jean-Pierre L?aud, Jean-Pierre Mocky, Marie Val?ra and J.-L. Godard himself. It's made from a thriller by James Hadley Chase.

Awarded for the best scenario at the Festival de Cannes. 100 min.\n\nBoth sides of the wire\n\nCanada 1993\n\nWho by fire\n\nThis documentary, directed by Neal Livingston, focuses on a group of German and Austrian refugees who were deported from Britain in the summer of 1940 and sent to a Canadian prison camp. These civilian refugees, most of them Jews, were ironically labeled as \"dangerous enemy aliens\" by the Canadian government, which has since grudgingly acknowledged that the internment was unnecessary. This documentary (based on a book by Ted Jones) reunites the prisoners of war fifty years after their ordeal, detailing the political circumstances which led to their imprisonment, recalling the atmosphere of the camp, and exploring the effect the experience had on their lives. Both Sides of the Wire is Black River's most ambitious film. 60 min.\n\nLe 20 heures dans les camps\n\nFrance 1993\n\nEverybody knows\n\nChris Marker's documentary about a group of Bosnian refugees who produce their own news show inside their camp\n\nL'Eau froide\n\n(Cold Water)\n\nFrance 1994\n\nAvalanche\n\nAn extraordinary French movie by Olivier Assayas about teenagers, made for the same series of autobiographical films as Akerman's (see Portrait - 1995 below).\n\nExotica\n\nCanada 1994\n\nEverybody knows (twice)\n\nExotica is a strange, compelling movie from Canadian writer/director Atom Egoyan. Bruce Greenwood is a tax adjuster who links a gay pet-shop owner, a baby sitter, and the gentleman's club - Exotica. Mia Kirshner is a beautiful dancer in the club, Egoyan's wife plays the club owner, and Elias Koteas gives a powerful perfomance as a cynical master of ceremonies (strip show barker), past Mia lover, and jealous foil to Greenwood. Cohen's \"Everybody Knows\" makes a fittingly sensual, sardonic accompaniment to a lap dance fairly early on. Rest of soundtrack is also engaging. The movie won a \"Genie\" award as Canada's best film of 1994, and Egoyan also received accolades at Cannes. 104 min\n\nWhen night is falling\n\nCanada 1994\n\nHallelujah\n\n(Instrumental)\n\nThe third feature from Patricia Rozema (best know for \"I've heard the mermaids singing\"), is a lushy atmospheric if oppressively symbolic account of Camille's death and rebirth as a sexual (lesbian) being. Music by various artists, including the instrumental version of \"Hallelujah\" at the end of the film.\n\nNatural born killers\n\nUSA 1994\n\nWaiting for the miracle\n\nThe anthem\n\nThe future\n\nA violent drama, directed by Oliver Stone, script by Quentin Tarantino, starring Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis.

Some upbeat jazz comes on, and he quickly changes to \"Suzanne\" by Cohen. The song then runs through the first verse.\n\nLe peril jeune\n\nFrance 1995\n\nSuzanne\n\nC?dric Klapisch, one of the rising stars of the new French generation of directors, offers a brilliant, devastatingly funny depiction of the young French people in the 1970s. Old schoolmates Bruno, Momo, Alain and L?on reunite after a few years' separation at a hospital, where Sophie, the girlfriend of their friend Tomas, who died a week earlier of an overdose, is about to give birth. In turn, they recall the last year in high school: the burning crushes, the demonstrations, the fancies; the tensions between the parents, the teachers, and the young; and the excitement before the finals. The film won the first price at the Festival d'Humour de Chamrousse in 1994.\n\nPortrait of a young girl in Brussels at the end of the 60's\n\nFrance 1995\n\nSuzanne\n\nChantal Akerman's beautiful autobiography has a key scene in which two teenagers dance to the entirety of \"Suzanne\"\n\nSebastian - When Everybody Knows\n\nNorway/Sweden 1995\n\nTacoma Trailer\n\nBengt E. Hansen & Gjermund Silset\n\nTwo versions of 'Tacoma Trailer' were used in the 1995 Scandinavian film 'Sebastian'; one with acoustic guitar, the other with piano and strings. Drama, directed by Svend Wam, tells about Sebastian who suddenly realizes that he is attracted to another boy.\n\nStrange Days\n\nUSA 1995\n\nDance me to the end of love\n\n(Kate Gibson)\n\nA paranoid, future-shock action-fantasy-melodrama directed by Kathryn Bigelow, and stars Ralph Fiennes, Julliette Lewis, Angela Bassett, and Tom Sizemore. It is set in LA at New Years - 2000. Fiennes plays Lenny (believe it or not) an ex-cop black marketeer dealing in illegal virtual reality disks -- \"like tv only better...straight from the cereberal cortex.\" Murder, violence, sex -- all without leaving your chair.\n\nPunch Me in the Stomach\n\nUSA 1995\n\nAnthem\n\nAn one woman show where she plays all the parts of the people in her life. She is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. At the end of the movie, her father is sitting at a private screening in the audience, she walks over to her father and asks him how he liked the show. They then walk out arm in arm and LC's song \"Anthem\" begins to play.\n\nBreaking the waves\n\nDenmark 1996\n\nSuzanne\n\nThis is a praised Danish film in the English language, directed by Lars von Trier, a Dane, and filmed in Scotland. It's a story about a simple-minded, religious woman, who falls in love with an oil worker. She is ready to do anything for him, just anything. Starring Emily Watson and Stellan Skarsgard. 2:40.\n\nSuzanne\n\nThe Slovak Republic 1996\n\nSuzanne (?)\n\nAccording to a Slovak TV interview with the director Dusan Rapos, this Slovak-Czech coproduction was inspired by Cohen's song (possibly the original or Juraj Kukura's version is also on the soundtrack?) It's a story about a young girl falling in love with an artist who has shown her the way to drugs. Starring Eva Vejmelkova.\n\nChronicle of a disappearance\n\n(TV documentary)\n\nIsrael 1996\n\nFirst we take Manhattan\n\nAn International Film Circuit presentation of a Dhat production produced in association with the Fund for the Promotion of Israeli Quality Film. Director/writer: Elia Suleiman. The film comes in two parts and with two different moods. The first part is entitled Nazareth: A Personal Diary, and the second part Jerusalem: A Political Diary. The director has returned to his homeland after a self-imposed exile of 12 years in New York to tell his story with the use of mostly nonprofessional actors. We get to hear Leonard Cohen sing in his unique and somber tone, as the police blindly invade an Arab apartment to unjustifiably search it. The lyrics reflect about being sentenced to 20 years of boredom.\n\nA perfect candidate\n\nUSA 1996\n\nDemocracy A fascinating, frequently cynical, repulsive view of American politics; a 'cinema verite' documentary covering the 1994 United States senate campaign between incumbent Charles Robb (L.B. Johnson son-in-law, plagued by Playboy magazine coverage of \"massage\" administered by 19 year old blonde sex-pot in New York hotel, and attendance at parties where drug use was common) and Oliver North (convicted of lying to Congress in Iran-Contra, but now a Bible-quoting born-again Christian, campaigning on 'traditional' family values). Shown from the points of view of the key North campaign stategist and a senior Washington Post political reporter assigned to the campaign. Cohen's \"Democracy,\" played in full during the final credits, stirs all the right emotional strings.\n\nLost and found\n\nHong Kong 1996\n\nDance me to the end of love\n\nScreenplay by [director] Lee Chi-Ngai. A beautiful woman (Kelly Chan) has leukemia, but learns how to live, and with whom to fall in love, (Takeshi Kaneshiro, or Michael [Fitzgerald] Wong). In spite of the sad starting point, the film has a graceful, lively, kind of witty tone that supports the story, about loss and death, without undue melancholy.\n\nBasquiat\n\nUSA 1996\n\nHallelujah\n\n(John Cale)\n\nBasquiat tells the story of the rise and fall of youthful black graffiti artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Starting out in New York's Tompkins Square Park in a cardboard box, Jean-Michel is \"discovered\" by Andy Warhol's art world and becomes an 80's sensation, before dying of a drug overdose at 27. Directed by painter Julian Schnabel, the film features a number of big stars, including Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Willem Dafoe, Christopher Walken, Parker Posey, and Benicio Del Toro. Tatum O'Neal, Courtney Love and Isabella Rossellini have small cameos. Jeffrey Wright gives a strong performance as Basquiat, and Claire Folani is heartbreaking in her role as his girlfriend. The closing sequence leads wonderfully to Cale's Hallelujah, done over the closing credits. The soundtrack includes Van Morrison and Tom Waits, among others. David Bowie does the final song and makes an excellent Andy Warhol.\n\nRiver Street\n\nAustralia 1996\n\nHallelujah\n\n(Simon Austin)\n\nStory of a young, aggressive and successful business man who ends up, sentenced by a judge, in a community centre where he has to do social work with socially misadapted people. Directed by Tony Mahood. Cast: Aden Young, Bill Hunter, Tammy McIntosh, Joy Smithers, Essie Davis, and Sullivan Stapleton. The soundtrack features a very nice guitar & voice cover of Cohen's \"Hallelujah\" (by the Australian singer Simon Austin) in the ending generic.\n\nPortraits Chinois\n\nFrance 1996\n\nDance me to the end of love\n\nFrench film directed by Martine Dugowson (also known as \"Shadow Play\") is an intense exploration of the romantic and existential issues facing a group of 20- and 30-something Parisians and stars Helena Bonham Carter. In one scene she does a charming semi-drunken dance to Leonard's song.\n\nChronicle of a Disappearance\n\nPalestina 1996\n\nFirst we take Manhattan\n\nA film by Israeli Arab film director and actor Elia Suleiman, his first feature film.\n\nKindred: The Embraced\n\n(Episode in TV series)\n\nUSA 1996\n\nWaiting for the miracle\n\n2nd episode of the first (and only) season of this series based on the White Wolf role-playing game, Vampire: the Masquerade.

The main actor, Hugo Weaving, sings several Cohen songs in full: So Long Marianne (a rock-band version) and One of us cannot be wrong (solo acoustic)\n\nPlatinum\n\nCanada 1997\n\nDemocracy\n\nWaiting for the miracle\n\nA knee slappin', head bangin', rump shakin' peek inside the star-making machines of the music biz. That's how director Bruce McDonald describes his made-for-TV movie. This two hour film is the satirical story of a small, independent Montreal record label and its efforts and misadventures as it tries to sign and retain its volatile singers and bands. The film opens with Leonard Cohen?s Democracy (instrumental portion only). Shot from a long range lens and from above, a car rolls into the scene and parks on the bird and blue heart logo from Cohen?s The Future album. About one hour and a half into the film, L.Cohen?s Waiting for the Miracle is featured as female band members walk in slow motion to the office building of a rival record label to sign a contract.\n\nSara\n\nPoland 1997\n\nI'm your man\n\nBoguslaw Linda\n\nIf it be your will\n\n(Agnieszka Wlodarczyk)\n\nSara is 16 years old. Her father - a kind of Godfather type - needs a bodyguard for her. He employs Leon (Boguslaw Linda - Polish Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis mixed together), an ex-commando (former member of Polish Special Forces) with a drinking problem. His wife has left him because of that. Sara?s father says he will kill anyone who touches his daughter. Soon Sara and Leon become lovers. There is a lot of killing - definitely B or rather C class movie. Directed by Maciej Slesicki.\n\nHeaven before I die\n\nCanada 1997\n\nDance me to the end of love\n\nDirector: Izidore K. Musallam. Cast: Andy Velasquez, Giancarlo Giannini, Omar Sharif. A young misfit leaves his native Palestine for a new life in Canada, hoping to escape the ridicule he's experienced because of his turned-out feet and Chaplinesque waddling gait. His journey of self-discovery brings him into contact with a cast of colorful characters, including a kind thief and 'The Prophet' author Kahlil Gibran.\n\nMr. Jealousy\n\nUSA 1998\n\nHey, that's no way to say goodbye\n\nA comedy with Eric Stoltz and Annabella Sciorra as the leading lovers, fine cameos by Peter Bogdanovich and Bridget Fonda, and some good songs on the soundtrack (also John Lennon's Jealous Guy and others by Luna). The movie is about Lester, a very jealous substitute teacher. He is jealous about the last boyfriend of his current partner Ramona. So he joins her ex- boyfriend's therapy group under an alias to find out if she has any feelings for him. Cohen's song is used at a critical moment of the plot, and even though only a little over two minutes is played (with several visuals, and one fairly long black screen) it makes an effective contribution to the movie.\n\nEl tiempo de la felicidad\n\nSpain 1998\n\nBird on a wire\n\nA Manuel Iborra film starring by Ver?nica Forqu? and Antonio Resines. Cohen's song is the leitmotiv of the movie, and you can hear it several times.

Being barely coherent she launches into a spoken version of Bird on a Wire.\n\nDancing at the Blue Iguana\n\nUSA 2001\n\nDance me to the end of love\n\nThe San Fernando Valley watering hole at the center of Michael Radford's moody film \"Dancing at the Blue Iguana\" is a strip club in which the bare-breasted dancers writhe and slither to the ominous drone of Leonard Cohen singing \"Dance Me to the End of Love.\" That may not be the sort of music you would expect to hear in such a place. But then the Blue Iguana isn't just any old West Coast fleshpot but a microcosm of this sad, lonely world and its lost female souls who cater to male lust.\n\nBall and Chain\n\nUSA 2001\n\nChelsea Hotel # 2\n\n30 min documentary presents the story of the lonesome rock star Janis Joplin just before her death in October 1970.

The author explains that Julie Harris suggested the dance scene, and that he originally rejected the idea. After he and his wife listened to \"Take This Waltz\" during dinner one evening he changed his mind. The au! thor now writes, \"I do not see the dance scene as an option for producers at this point. Not only do I not see this as a modular scene that can be plugged in or out at a director's discretion, but I also don't want any other choice of music to be made because \"Take This Waltz\" inspired me to write this scene. I'd like it to be a part of the play as long as the rights are available.\"\n\nOC\n\n(Episode in TV series)\n\nUSA 2003\n\nHallelujah\n\n(Jeff Buckley)\n\nHallelujah was used on the soundtrack of the 2nd episode in the new FOX series about a young man who gets into trouble in his hometown and is shipped off to live with relatives in Newport Beach, CA, which is in Orange County, hence the name \"OC\".
