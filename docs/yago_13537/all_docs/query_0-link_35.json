        "text": "Despite the great effort and amount of work Jean Poiret did in the acting arena, he is mostly remembered today as the author of a hugely popular play and movie. \"La Cage aux Folles,\" written when he was deep into his primary career, is a lighthearted sex comedy that had a long theatrical run and a massive following. It was also adapted into a wildly successful 1978 film that spawned a sequel and a Hollywood remake ('96's \"The Birdcage\"). Poiret was born in Paris and built his career there. After World War II, he gained prominence as a theater and radio actor, which soon led to film roles. He was a familiar presence on French film screens throughout his life, appearing in supporting roles in such efforts as the '53 adaptation of \"The Three Musketeers\" and Fran√ßois Truffaut's \"The Last Metro\" ('80), a romantic drama set in Nazi-occupied Paris. Poiret wrote \"La cage aux Folles\" in the early '70s and it became a huge hit when it landed on the stage in '73, running for many years. The original cast featured Poiret and his friend and frequent collaborator Michel Serrault as co-stars, although Poiret was replaced by Ugo Tognazzi in the film version."
