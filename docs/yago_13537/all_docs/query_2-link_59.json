She met then Aurélien Brada, former Formula 1 driver, whose career was broken due to an accident. Aurélien Brada decides to protect little Sarah in her runaway. They cross on their way various characters (a mad escape from an asylum, a breeder polecat, representatives of authority, a noble driving a Rolls Royce, Dédé-la-Terreur, nuns ...) and are pursued relentlessly by Commissioner Franquette. After many adventures, the heroes escape by helicopter to the sunny shores of Oceania."
