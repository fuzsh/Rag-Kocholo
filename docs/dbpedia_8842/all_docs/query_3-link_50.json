        "text": "Alan Mowbray, the American film actor who was one of the founding members of the Screen Actors Guild, was born Ernest Allen on August 18, 1896, in London, England, to a non-theatrical family. He served in the British army during World War I and received the Military Medal and the French Croix De Guerre for bravery in action. He began as a stage actor in England, and in some accounts he gave of his life, claimed he was a provincial actor in England before his naval service. In other versions, he claimed he turned to acting after The Great War, as World War I was then known, as he was broke and had no other skills.\n\nAfter acting in London's West End, Mowbray came to the United States, where he toured the country with the Theater Guild from 1923 to 1929. On the road with the Guild, he most enjoyed acting in the plays of Noël Coward and George Bernard Shaw. He made his Broadway debut in the play \"Sport of Kings\" at the Lyceum Theatre on May 4, 1926. He also appeared on Broadway in \"These Modern Women\" in February 1928 and in \"The Amorous Antic\" in December 1929.\n\nOn August 25, 1929, Mowbray's own play, \"Dinner is Served,\" an original comedy he wrote, directed and starred in, made its debut at the Cort Theatre. The play was not a success, closing after just four performances. After \"The Amorous Antic,\" Mowbray did not appear again on Broadway until 1963, when he was featured in \"Enter Laughing,\" the hit stage adaptation of Carl Reiner's novel.\n\nHis relative lack of success on Broadway during the \"Roaring Twenties\" did not matter, as sound had come to Hollywood and the studios were looking for stage actors who could appear in the talkies. Blessed with excellent diction, and tall with a stiff posture and a patrician air, he was ideal for character parts in sound pictures. A member of the \"stiff-upper lip\" school of British acting, he was often cast as a British, European or upper-class American gentleman, or as an aristocrat or royalty. As he aged, roles as doctors or butlers were his forte.\n\nMowbray was praised by the critics for limning George Washington in the 1931 biopic Alexander Hamilton (1931) (he would once again play the Father of His Country, this time in a comic vein, in the 1945 musical Where Do We Go from Here? (1945)). He had a romantic lead role opposite Miriam Hopkins in Pioneer Films' Becky Sharp (1935), which was the first feature film made in three-strip Technicolor.\n\nMowbray had the distinction of appearing in movies with three screen Sherlock Holmeses: Clive Brook in Sherlock Holmes (1932), Reginald Owen in A Study in Scarlet (1933) and Basil Rathbone in Juwelenraub (1946). He played the butler in the first two \"Topper\" films, and as a character actor had memorable turns in two John Ford pictures, Faustrecht der Prärie (1946) and Westlich St. Louis (1950). In the area of typecasting, Mowbray could be counted on as a \"pompous blowhard\" in such movies as Mein Mann Godfrey (1936), or as \"the surprise killer\" in B-movie murder mysteries. One of his favorite roles was the con man in the television series Colonel Humphrey Flack (1953), which ran on the Dumont network in 1953.\n\nMowbray occasionally was a screenwriter, but mostly concentrated on acting. In his personal life he was a member of the Royal Geographic Society and was active in several acting fraternities. He also was one of the founding members of the Screen Actors Guild. The Guild was formed in 1933, in the wake of the formation of the Screen Writers Guild, in reaction to a proposed 50% across-the-board pay cut implemented by the studios.\n\nActors Equity, the theatrical actors union, had tried to organize Hollywood after winning a contract and a closed shop on Broadway after World War I, but it had failed. Screen actors angered over the lack of contracts and the grueling work hours at the Hollywood studios founded the Masquers club in 1925 in a move towards unionization. After studio technicians won a collective bargaining agreement from the studios in 1926, MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer had the idea of heading off collective bargaining by the \"talent\" branches--the actors, writers and directors--by creating a company union. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences was created to serve as an intermediary between the studios and the talent branches and technicians, negotiating contract disputes. Proto-unions, such as the original Screen Writers Guild, folded in 1927 after the creation of the Academy.\n\nBy the announcement of the across-the-board cut in 1933, two previous rounds of cutbacks and lay-offs caused by the Great Depression had alienated most of the talent in Hollywood and had led to a strike by the technicians which had closed down the studios for a day. Losing faith in the company union that was the Academy, the talent began organizing their own guilds. In addition to the lack of contracts for many actors and the concerns over wages and hours, one of the new Screen Actors Guild's grievances was that Academy membership was by invitation-only.\n\nIn March 1933, SAG was founded by six actors: Berton Churchill, Charles B. Miller, Grant Mitchell, Ralph Morgan, Alden Gay and Kenneth Thomson. Three months later Mowbray was named to SAG's board of directors. He personally funded SAG when it was first founded. While many high-profile actors, already signed to seven-year contracts, refused initially to join SAG, they began to flock to the new union once the studios initiated an anti-raiding provision in the new National Industrial Relations Act code the industry had implemented after Franklin D. Roosevelt became US President and oversaw the enactment of his New Deal legislation in the first 100 days of his administration.\n\nThe NRA code the movie industry adopted created a situation for the talent similar to baseball's reserve clause, in which another studio was prevented from offering a contract to an actor, writer or director whose contract had lapsed until their old studio had finished with them and not picked up their option. The NRA code contained a pay ceiling for the talent and technicians, but not for executives. The talent was further enraged when it found out that the Academy, the \"company union,\" had created a committee to investigate the feasibility of long-term contracts. Long-term contracts were the only island of stability in an industry that enhanced its profitability by cutting the wages of its employees and by working them long hours.\n\nAt a pivotal meeting at the home of Frank Morgan (the future \"Wizard of Oz\" and the brother of first SAG president Ralph Morgan), Eddie Cantor insisted that SAG's response to the new code--a collective bargaining agreement--should be in the interests of all actors, not just the already established ones. In the three weeks after the critical meeting, SAG membership rose from approximately 80 members to more than 4,000. Actors resigned from the Academy en masse to join SAG.\n\nCantor, a friend of President Roosevelt, took the occasion of his being invited to spend the 1933 Thanksgiving holiday with the Roosevelt family to point out the inequities in the new code that SAG found particularly noxious. By executive order, F.D.R. struck them down.\n\nFinally, in 1937, after a long period of resistance, the studios recognized SAG as a collective bargaining agent for actors. Recognition of the Screen Writers Guild and the Screen Directors Guild eventually followed. Mowbray's financial support, in the crucial early days of the guild, had helped make a collective bargaining agreement for actors a reality.\n\nAlan Mowbray married Lorayne Carpenter in 1927, and they had two children. He died on March 25, 1969, of a heart attack.\n\nBrian Aldiss, author of the classic Helliconia trilogy, and the story on which Steven Spielberg's 2001 film AI: Artificial Intelligence was based, was one of Britain's most accomplished and versatile writers of science fiction. In a lifelong and prolific career, Aldiss, who died aged 92, produced more than 40 novels and almost as many short-story collections. An ambitious and gifted writer, with a flowing and inventive literary style, he did not confine himself to science fiction. As well as his prodigious output of SF, he wrote several bestselling mainstream novels, poetry, drama, two autobiographies and several film scenarios. He also edited a huge number of anthologies and produced a body of criticism that was remarkable for its energy and clarity.\n\nHe began publishing his stories in the mid-1950s, a time when SF was heavily dominated by US writers schooled in the markets of commercial magazines. Aldiss's work came as a breath of fresh air to a genre beginning to suffocate in its own orthodoxies. He wrote lively, intelligent prose, shot through with subversive humour, linguistic novelty and human observation. He took for his subjects the full range of modern scientific research. As well as the exact sciences, he also plundered speculative, psychological, sociological and sexological areas of inquiry. One of the most exhilarating aspects of reading Aldiss is the diversity of his imagination.\n\nBorn in Dereham, Norfolk, he was the son of Stanley Aldiss, who came from a family that ran a draper's shop, and his wife Elizabeth, known as Dot. Brian spent much of his childhood away from his family, deposited first in Framlingham college preparatory school in Suffolk, which he hated and feared, then later, at the outbreak of the second world war, in West Buckland school in Devon, with which eventually he came to terms. In common with many who went to British boarding schools, Aldiss later said that his army experiences, crammed into sweltering troopships and trains, sleeping rough in slit trenches, and so on, were nothing compared to what he had grown up with. From 1943 he served in the Royal Corps of Signals and was shipped out to India. From there he joined the \"Forgotten\" 14th Army in Burma. He rose to the rank of corporal, which he described as being not as important as a general. It was probably more suited to his individualistic nature, a man who throughout his life was to lead by example, not by command. After the fall of Burma, Aldiss began training for the land assault on the Japanese mainland, but was among the many thousands of young soldiers whose lives, he was later convinced, were saved by the Japanese surrender following the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nWhen the second world war was over he continued to serve in the far east, particularly on Sumatra, an island of exotic terrain and customs, an experience that influenced much of his work, sometimes explicitly. In the 70s, Aldiss's far east sojourn informed his three Horatio Stubbs novels, which were all bestsellers: The Hand-Reared Boy (1970), A Soldier Erect (1971) and A Rude Awakening (1978). Strong autobiographical themes also ran through his best general fiction, such as Life in the West (1980) and Forgotten Life (1988), and much of his early SF was set in hot climates or jungly environments, notably Non-Stop (1958), The Male Response (1961) and Hothouse (1962).\n\nAfter demobilisation in 1947, Aldiss settled in Oxford and began work as a bookshop assistant. Under the pseudonym Peter Pica, he contributed a series of fictional sketches to the trade magazine The Bookseller, comically and pointedly describing the life of a bookshop assistant in a provincial town. These became enormously popular with the readership, among whom was Sir Geoffrey Faber, chairman of the publisher of that name.\n\nIn this way Aldiss's first book, a collection of the sketches made up into a novel, found its publisher. The Brightfount Diaries (1955) was successful enough to allow him to quit the bookshop, which by then had become odious to him. He was to remain a Faber author for 15 years. From 1957 until 1970 he was in his spare time the literary editor of the Oxford Mail.\n\nHis first SF novel was Non-Stop, about a multigeneration spaceship on a long journey between the stars. This familiar generic material gave free rein to his exuberant imagination, producing a story that not only took on the American genre on its own terms, but which introduced unmistakably British characters who were often stricken with melancholy, mischief and bursts of randiness. Non-Stop is still regarded in the SF world as a classic of its kind.\n\nIn 1959, Aldiss received his first international recognition, a special Hugo award from the World Science Fiction Society for \"most promising new author of the year\" - no comparable Hugo has been awarded since. A few years later, he received a second Hugo, this one for Hothouse. These were what he called his SF years. Throughout the 60s he wrote a number of novels and short stories that were to cement his reputation.\n\nPrime among them was Greybeard (1964), possibly his greatest SF novel: it depicts a world of almost universal sterility, where elderly, childless survivors journey downstream along the Thames in hope of finding signs of new life. Written against the failure of his first marriage, while he was separated from his young children, this novel revealed that ebullience and exotica were not the only weapons in Aldiss's literary armoury, but that he could deal with important tragic themes.\n\nHe continued to write traditional SF after that period, but in 1970 he published the first of the Horatio Stubbs novels. The second of them, A Soldier Erect, is a brilliant evocation of the far east war, and one of the few novels to be written about the Burma campaign. His career broadened. The SF became more demanding and experimental: Barefoot in the Head (1969), Frankenstein Unbound (1973) and The Malacia Tapestry (1976), a fantasy partly inspired by the drawings of the 18th-century Italian artists Tiepolo and Maggiotto, a love story set in a city where time has ceased to flow.\n\nIn the early 80s, Aldiss embarked on his longest and most sustained work, the Helliconia trilogy: Helliconia Spring (1982), Summer (1983) and Winter (1985). This depiction of a world that circles a double star, where an orbital Great Year lasts long enough for cultures to emerge, prosper and fail, is a subtle, deeply researched and intellectually rigorous work. The Helliconia trilogy has earned its status as a modern classic of SF.\n\nTo his friends, Aldiss was often the best of company, a generous man with a well-furnished mind who was amused not only by the follies of the world at large but also by his own. Both his autobiographies, Bury My Heart at WH Smith's (1990) and The Twinkling of an Eye (1998), the former about his professional life, the latter his personal life, are full of honest and sometimes surprising self-appraisals. You sensed he was a man who never lost his curiosity, or his sense of humour. When Aldiss was on his most amusing form, a long evening in a Munich bierkeller could be memorably entertaining, as I discovered in 1987.\n\nMore seriously, Aldiss's commitment to literature, and in particular to SF literature, was fierce. In the mid-60s he was instrumental in obtaining a crucial Arts Council grant for New Worlds, the pioneering British SF magazine. All his working life he did much behind the scenes to encourage, support and promote younger writers. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Literary Society in 1989, and was appointed OBE in 2005. He bore these awards, and many others, with pride.\n\nAs well as the autobiographies, Aldiss produced a large number of non-fiction works. The first was a travel book, Cities and Stones (1965), a journey through the former Yugoslavia, a country he loved. Most of the rest were arguments about or critical histories of SF, but for all his industrious and often ingenious defence of the stuff in which he excelled, SF remained marginalised. It was an argument he never really won.\n\nHis history of the genre, Billion Year Spree, appeared in 1973, with a recast version, Trillion Year Spree, in collaboration with David Wingrove, in 1986. Other books on SF art were published. Late in his career, Aldiss sold the film rights to one of his short stories: Supertoys Last All Summer Long (1969). Stanley Kubrick, fitful genius, was still trying to shape a script to his satisfaction when he died in 1999; Steven Spielberg took over the project, and the film A.I.: Künstliche Intelligenz (2001) appeared two years later.\n\nAldiss's astonishingly prolific writing continued until the end of his life. When he was 75 he was awarded the title of Grandmaster by Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, obviously because of his past work, but also to celebrate the fact that he would not give up. After that he wrote more novels, two collections of poetry, and An Exile on Planet Earth (2012), a retrospective of his critical essays published by the Bodleian Library. He described Finches of Mars (2012) as his last SF novel. At some point in his few moments of spare time, he also executed some 90 original paintings - these were exhibited at the Jam Factory gallery in Oxford in 2010.\n\nAldiss was by a long chalk the premier British science fiction writer - that he was also one of the most versatile writers of any kind was a fact that only a comparatively few readers outside the SF field came to discover. His work is still, in this sense, to be discovered.\n\nHis first marriage, to Olive Fortescue in 1948, ended in divorce in 1965, after which he married Margaret Manson. She died in 1997. Aldiss was survived by his partner, Alison Soskice, and four children: Clive and Wendy from his first marriage, and Timothy and Charlotte from his second."
