        "text": "Since the debut of my Rosado Customs at the House of Blues Las Vegas Country Throwdown, there have been so many of you asking who made this amazing bass and where did it come from. Well, microwave some popcorn and read on.\n\nI met Gil Rosado by chance. Needing some repair work done on one of my precious Ernie Ball's and not knowing where to go, a guitar player friend of mine took me over to see Gil. He came out of the backroom, smiled, shook my hand, looked me dead in the eye and asked how he could be of help to me. I sort of cocked my head, because out of his mouth, came this New York style accent. Now mind you, I have never liked New York, nor do I have a desire to visit New York. Anyone that I have ever come in contact with that had a New York accent, just put me off and acted all holier than thou (Hey, please read on-Gil has changed my mind and perception!). I asked him a hundred questions because I wasn't going to leave anything of mine with anyone I didn't trust. Gil took the time to listen, repeated what my concerns were to me, and offered suggestions for improvement, but insisted, if I wasn't comfortable, it wouldn't be done. His customer service, and what I later found out, his love for the bass guitar, is what sets Gil apart from anyone I have ever spoken to or dealt with. This guy is the real deal. So real, that his clientele is a veritable Who's Who of Las Vegas musicians and touring artists that come through town. In advance of the House of Blues show, Gil asked if I was good with the bass. I told him there was a bit of tweaking that I wanted to have done, but because of time, I wasn't able to hook up with him. I said the bass was at 90%. He told me that 90% wasn't good enough for anything with his name on it. Guess who showed up at the House of Blues wanting to make sure his baby was 100%? Yup, the Master Luthier himself, Gil Rosado. That is a show of commitment and excellence that is unheard of nowadays. After the show, I had gotten into a little Tete-a-Tete with some of the crew at the House of Blues. They were wondering what kind of active electronics I had in the bass because I was clipping most of their gear, and, they hadn't had such a hot bass in the mix for quite a while. I told them it wasn't active, it was passive. They didn't believe me. I actually had to prove it to them. (Gil was one proud papa when I told him that!)\n\nWell, without further ado, here are some of the specs on this one of a kind Rosado Custom:\n\nMaple neck with Rosewood board\n\nDouble P routed Alder body\n\nHipshot Ultralight tuners\n\nHipshot Kickass bridge\n\nDiMarzio CS pickups\n\nConcentric controls\n\nSprague Orange Drop caps\n\nSwitchcraft jack\n\nAnodized aluminum pickguard\n\nBone nut\n\nCustom hand pinstriping\n\nOnset relic\n\nSIT strings\n\nIf you want your very own customer build, made to your exact specs, or need repair done on any of your instruments (Mandolins included), see Gil Rosado. He is old school, cares, and wants you to sound your very best. There is no other. Nobody else touches anything of mine.\n\nGil is only a quick contact away. Tell him I sent you! Get a hold of him through my endorsements page or go directly to: www.facebook.com/rosadorepairs\n\nA High School mate, John Roehlk, who always was, and still is an amazing, genuine person, posted something today about how long ago he had graduated. I walked down that gym floor, in cap and gown, a year after he did. What he wrote got me to thinking about where I was then and where I am today. I feel extremely grateful for what has transpired, because, without really knowing it then, I was setting myself up to live a dream that I had no idea I was going to have.\n\nThe picture you see above was posted the day I decided to go from a regular day to day working kind of guy to pursuing a passion-Living My Dream-and not looking back because I didn't want to say to myself later on in life...\"What if...\". To finally decide to try and fly, I had to look back, take everything into consideration, close my eyes, take a deep breath, hold my wife's hand, and jump. It's scary, trust me, but when you finally are able to rely upon yourself for everything, to pursue a true passion, life opens up, dreams come true, and the experiences are ones that you could never imagine. The book, they say, starts to write itself.\n\nWhen I was born, St. Charles, IL was a town of 9269 people. It was nestled near corn fields with only your imagination and neighborhood friends to occupy your time. And so true of the times, the street lamps let you know when it was time go home. It was a simple life. High School came and unknowingly the dream began to take seed. Soccer teams, more friends, parties, and...music. My first recollection of live music was being invited to a house by Ralf Kinscheck and listening to his band rehearse. And, it was him who loaned me many of his prized LP's to listen to because I had just discovered Rock n Roll. The albums were amazing. I, for some reason, remember particularly putting Foreigner on and getting lost. Then came the albums of Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Thin Lizzy, Deep Purple, and this list went on from there. Music was beginning to flow in my blood and to this day, it has never left. I have to thank Ralph for going out of his way to do this for me then, and to John for making me remember today.\n\nSince those days, as I have said many times in the past, I have been an extremely fortunate musician. Playing music with my heroes on stage, meeting some of the most influential people in Nashville, sharing stage billing with A List artists, and being the first number on speed dial so that MY band was called to be THE entertainment for many other artists in town or out of town. When I look at all of that, how can you not be humbled. Trust me, this didn't come easy, but with hard work and effort, when you jump off of that cliff, you will be able to fly.\n\nSo for all of you who have a passion, who have a desire, it is worth it. It's worth putting yourself out there. You find out who you really are and what you are capable of. Believe me when I say, you will be amazed to find out that you are capable of doing what you never thought you could. And when you finally get to do it, see the culmination of all your hard work and effort come to fruition, you just might have to sit down, like I did, give a little cry of appreciation and thank the good Lord for giving you wings to fly.\n\nHere are only some of the folks that I have been blessed to share time with, professionally and personally, in this dream of mine...\n\nThere are times, whether you like it or not, that an idea pops into your head, and you have to decide, \"What are you going to do about it?\" I don't know about you, but in the past, no matter what brilliant, hair-brained or fantastical thoughts came about, I was going to do it no matter the consequences. I have been in trouble, I have done things that my mother would have grounded me for, and, I have been in rooms where some folks come out of with broken fingers or bones. BUT, I have never had my picture on a post office wall! Some folks thought I would end up there. Life isn't over...not quite yet...there still might be time to fulfill others dreams.\n\nIn this adventure called music, I worked hard on relationships that would benefit the band. You have to sit there and think, \"Who or what can I cozy up with that would be mutually beneficial?\" With country music, many things go hand in hand, I won't list all of them, because you can figure them out, but the one I was most interested in, and the one with the most far reaching potential, the one which made me drool, which I knew everyone would love, was whiskey. Who could I reach out to? I started locally, but because of distribution, most of the products would lead you back to the big makers. Once there, it was tough to get anyone's attention because we simply weren't a huge act or on a major tour. So, what did I do? I searched Canada. That makes sense doesn't it? It did to me!\n\nWe were already working with two brands way up in the Great White North, (eh)? One sponsor is a coffee brand called Espresso Post. Visit them please while you are up in Collingwood, Ontario, Canada. They have best tasting coffee anywhere!\n\nwebsite: http://www.espressopost.com/\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/espressopost\n\nAnd the second sponsor is Unstrung Heroes. UH is an independent web series about found family, friendship, and the lives we build while following our dreams. They are just about to launch season three and I personally cannot wait for it.\n\nyoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf26_vJ-v6U6YYTv_R8iZ4w\n\nwebsite: http://www.unstrungheroes.tv/\n\nFacebook: at https://www.facebook.com/UnstrungHeroesShow\n\nOnce you start watching this series, you will be bingeing until every episode is seen. I warn you now, get the popcorn and soda ready!\n\nSorry, I digressed, where was I? Branding...I found out about Collingwood Whisky. Locally made, locally produced, locally packaged, and it has a small hometown feel to it, just like the city it was named after. Not to mention that it goes great with coffee and episodes of UH. After reaching out to them, I decided it was photo shoot time because I felt that they needed to update their ad campaign! I got my favorite photographer, more on her in another blog, and we set out to make the best ads ever for this product so they would have to say, \"Yes, we love you! We want to work with you! You are the answer to our dreams!\" After primping, and showering, and doing hair and make up, mirrors and lights, finding out what was my best side, we ventured out.\n\nIt was hot that day, but, I had to stay cool, very cool, for this was going to be our future, this was going to put us on the map! Many shots were taken, various sites were visited and in the end, we got some amazing photos. I was really proud of what was done and how we went about doing it. After putting a package together, I sent it off and they are still going over it as we speak. Wouldn't it be great to have a lifetime supply of Collingwood Whisky in your cupboards? Oh yes it would!\n\nThe above photo is my personal favorite, and another one was taken, of ...my ass, which was entered into a photo competition by the above referenced, soon to be disclosed, photographer. And would you believe it? My butt made it into the finals and was prominently on display for four weeks, for the whole world to see! In the \"end\", it didn't get a ribbon, but it sure was cool to be considered among other great works.\n\nI don't have any idea where I am going with this anymore, so, all I would like to say is, go for it. Just go for it. You have an idea? You think it'll do you some good? You think that it will take you someplace? You think you will get some enjoyment out of it? Take a chance and do it. Bet on yourself and try. If you don't, who will?\n\nJune 19th was the last day of an incredible fight that Melanie had taken on that started in April. We saw her at an event and she was complaining of stomach pains. It concerned us because Mel has a super high tolerance of pain. We know, because she really let us have it at times. Her compassion and love for us was what we had always used as inspiration to keep doing what we do. It was fuel for our fire, it was the wind that filled our sails and it was the strength that kept us moving in times of seeing nothing happening for us at all.\n\nDennis, her husband, brought her to the Emergency Room because she couldn’t take anymore. And within seven days, we had seen Mel deteriorate so quickly that she was put on life support just days before Mother’s Day. One troubling and difficult night, we were called in because the doctor’s thought that she wouldn’t make it. In an ICU room, where usually two people are allowed, there were about twenty of us wishing and praying for her to somehow pull through and live to fight another day. I don’t know if it was her, or God, or us, or a combinations of everything, but she fought on and eventually got well enough to come off of life support and begin recovery. Times were still difficult, drugs were many, thought processes weren’t coherent, but we had Mel back and she was on her way to getting out of bed and making her way back home.\n\nShe was well enough to leave ICU and the hospital to go to a rehab facility. About a week in, Melanie was again rushed to the hospital because of complications and work began on her again for recovery number two.\n\nWe saw progress, she was getting better, she was becoming coherent. She yelled at Dennis and she yelled at me. Mel was back! This was great news. We were happy to hear her voice and see her smile, and above all, the animated way she would roll her eyes whenever we would say something foolish. The best part, Dennis saying something and then Melanie flipping him off. If we only could have gotten a picture of that!\n\nA second rehab facility was ready for her and we all went with open arms and hearts to help her again on the road to recovery. This place was nice. It had good food, the staff was excellent and knew how to handle Mel when she wasn’t “in the mood” to do any of the therapy. They got her sitting up, moving, balancing on the edge of the bed and even sitting in a chair. It was like winning the Gold Medal at the Olympics for all of us to see this.\n\nOn a visit, as we walked in, we saw that she was tired, but she had just gotten back from PT and were told that she had ridden a bike. Holy crap! How freaking awesome was that? Pedaling her way to the finish line. She was ready to be out of the hospital and get home.\n\nLater that night, she had chest x-rays taken and they noticed that there was fluid in one of her lungs. Since this facility didn’t have the means to do this procedure, she was once again taken to a hospital. From the time that chest x-ray was taken, to the time they took another one in the ER, her lung had filled with fluid. Emergency procedures were done to relieve this, but we didn’t know that this was the beginning of the end. She crashed as they were working on her. The medical staff, to their amazing credit and quick thinking, got her stabilized. Everything was looking so good, that they had time to take a quick bite after hours of work on her. During that time though, Mel called for Dennis twice, and those would be the last words that anyone would hear from her.\n\nThe cancer that was inside of her was taking hold and not letting go. It was getting aggressive and working its way through her body at such an alarming rate that it was attacking her whole being. The scourge of cancer. The finality of it. The beast that it is. We only wish that we could grab a hold of it and kick it's ass. Knock it back to where it came from and never see it again.\n\nThis time Mel wasn’t so lucky. There wasn’t much more fight in her. She tried though. Tried as hard as her body would let her. She wasn’t willing to go and she definitely wasn’t ready to take her last breath. We told her she could be with the Lord, but she stared right back and shook her head no. She wanted to stay and fight on.\n\nA second time she had to go on life support. One cannot imagine what it looks like unless you have been through it already and have seen it with your own eyes. The machines, the beeping, the background noise. All of it invading your subconscious and the only time you wouldn’t hear it, was when you were praying for her or speaking to her and letting her know how much you cared and loved her.\n\nMelanie was still strong though. She fought until her family was able to make it to town and be with her.\n\nWe were there when she was taken off of life support. We were there when she took her last breath. We were there to witness the miracle of one woman taking on the fight of a lifetime.\n\nIf we could all only learn from her. If we could all only take a look at our lives everyday and decide what is important and what isn’t important. What fight is worth fighting for and what ones we should just simply give up and move away from. Does it really matter to always be right, or is it better to be happy? Decide what battle is important and let the other ones go. Our hangups, our arguments, our jealousies, our petty selfish thoughts about how we don’t have what we want goes against what life is all about. Right? We should enjoy life and enjoy those that are in it. We can have differences, but as adults, we are intelligent enough to know that compromise is a key to happiness and maturity. It works. It’s been proven and in the end, we are all better for it.\n\nWhat Mel has taught me is invaluable. Strength, courage, the desire to live life to its fullest. Give a hug, accept a hug. Be happy. Smile and laugh whenever you want. Let the small things go. Kiss someone you care for on the cheek or forehead and tell them “I love you and appreciate you.” You should, because one day, you will never ever be able to do it again.\n\nHere we go again with another, I am sitting at a happy hour, drinking margaritas and I get a text message. I look at it, choke on the straw, and that drink is all over the table in no time flat. What could that text possibly have said?\n\n“How would you like to open for Parmalee?”\n\nOf course, being calm, cool, and collected, I checked our schedule, knowing full well that the date was going to be open, and quickly responded: “When and Where?”\n\nWe have been working hard at this band thing. Very hard for over six years now. All that hard work is starting to show and we are getting calls for shows instead of making them and asking. I won’t stop making those phone calls, but it sure is nice to have your phone ring once in awhile. And when you notice the number, and know who it is calling, you always smile because after you say “Hello”, there is another opportunity to help make things happen.\n\nIt took no time to get the paperwork signed and delivered. We were on our way to opening for another major artist and we were going to have fun.\n\nWe got there, huge outdoor amphitheater, great staff, huge green room, food, drink, and a clean bathroom that works (you have no idea how much that means to a band). We were waiting for Parmalee to finish their soundcheck, and like little mice with a plan, we scurried on stage and got our gear set up waiting for the go to check levels. Because, once levels are attained, you know the big boom is going to come once they open up that channel, and you get to hit your first note and feel the stage and walls shake, it's like thunder coming down. There is nothing better than playing at full concert volume. For most of you, who don’t get to be up on stage, what you hear as an audience member is quite different than what you hear on stage during the show. We can actually talk to each other, yell things on the fly, and still feel the rush of air coming from our amps, side fills and monitors. What a rush!\n\nAs usual, the time flew by. Before we knew it, our set was done and it was time to clear the stage for the boys of the evening. Parmalee is a great group of guys. Down to earth, humble, respectful, and are working just as hard as we are to “make it”. They though, are a little further up the road than we are since they already have three top ten hits. Five Albums and four videos made for CMT. They were very encouraging to us and really liked what we did.\n\nWe hung out in the crowd during the Parmalee show and the fans treated us like we were rock stars. Asking for photos and autographs. Sure is a great feeling to see a little kid come up and shyly ask for a photo. I remember those days like it was yesterday. Heck, I felt like that as both bands were passing each other backstage. Saying hello, slapping high fives, what’s up’s, and have a great show. Playing music, there is no better feeling.\n\nOpportunity presents itself anytime and anywhere. You just have to keep your eyes open and react when you see it. Don’t let things pass you by. Don’t think about doing it tomorrow, for tomorrow may never come and you just might not remember what it was that you were suppose to remember.\n\nI was at a happy hour with friends, enjoying the start of another weekend and putting a very busy week of band stuff behind me. I expected nothing more but some margaritas, chips, salsa, and live music. The corner of the room had a TV monitor that was showing an entertainment schedule, and as I looked up, I saw a name that I recognized from a long, long, time ago…over twenty years ago. You see, I moved to Vegas way back then, took a job and met a manager who had a band. I went to many of their shows, and after they broke up, lives went on and each of us took separate paths, which amazingly, these many years later, were going to cross again.\n\nI looked him up and saw that he was in the entertainment industry. He also was “the guy” that did the booking of bands for some of the best venues in town. I sat there, wondering how incredible it was that this happened because all I wanted to do was get out of the house, meet some friends and have a beverage.\n\nI sent him an email, and the next day he reached back out to me. I told him how I saw his name and reminded him of stories that he and I had those so many years ago. Crazy, we both thought, but here we are, and what I had, was something that he was looking for. We exchanged information and I thought it would be a while before I heard from him again. Well, it didn’t take long, the next day he sent an email and asked if we wanted to do the after party for Chris Stapleton. By the time I got back to him, only minutes later, the spot was already filled. I thanked him for thinking about us, and went back about business. Funny now that I think about it, I was at another happy hour, drinking margaritas, and he texted letting me know that the spot opened up again. We jumped on it and had only a few days to prepare. What excitement. The thrill of the initial call, the disappointment of getting told no, back to the high of hearing “Yes, you guys got it”.\n\nThis whole thing happened because I looked up and saw a TV hanging on a wall. Opportunity, if you aren’t prepared, will never happen. Being in the right place at the right time? Go somewhere and have a margarita.\n\nIt was a pile in the truck kind of road trip for the boys when they were told to be in Nashville, TN for their record label showcase at 3rd & Lindsley, one of Music City’s most prominent venues.\n\nThis showcase was the culmination of five years of work. Rowdy started out in the dives, bars, and clubs of Las Vegas, and now, he had the opportunity to bring to Nashville what Las Vegas already knew, a great talent with showmanship that can be duplicated by no other.\n\nThe two and a half day trip brought many stories as one could imagine. From almost falling over the edge of Hoover Dam, to the snows of Flagstaff, the fish-tailing on black ice in Gallup, getting hit on in the bathrooms of an Arkansas truck stop, to the below freezing weather (14 degrees mind you) of Nashville. It was a trip to remember. Not to mention the amount of food that was eaten in the Denny’s, Cracker Barrel’s and Waffle Houses along Route 40. Good thing the truck cab had windows. That’s for sure.\n\nWe pulled into town and the first stop was Treasure Isle Recorders, the studio that recorded Rowdy’s album. All the gear was brought in, set up and turned on. We all couldn’t wait to make some noise in that most famous place. The next day found us back in the studio, going through the set list and making some last minutes changes that we knew would catch the ears of the labels and talent agents that were going to be showing up.\n\nThe day of the showcase was electric. Everyone was showered, shaved, and had their best clothes on. The green rooms were huge, everything you could ask for or desire, and a palpable excitement could be felt in the building. You could sense the tension coming from the crowd. How can these Las Vegas kids possibly be good enough to play in Nashville? Well, we showed them. They were up on their feet and trying to sing along to songs that they were hearing for the first time. It was a pretty amazing feeling being up there as we were putting it all on the line and leaving every bit of ourselves on that stage. Not only did we pull in crowds and curiosity seekers from Nashville, but we got to meet and see folks from: Warner, Curb, Black River, Blackbird, Broken Bow, Sony/RCA, Big Machine, William Morris and Artisan, just to name a few. Many of the writers from the album were there and they were so excited and appreciative to hear how we played their songs and how it was the way that they envisioned the songs to be. For all of us, it was quite a humbling experience to know that we are the carriers of hopes and dreams for many people and they, in turn, really support and truly believe in what we are doing.\n\nMusic, it is something that you have live, not just listen to."
