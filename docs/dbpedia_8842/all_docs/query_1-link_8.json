        "text": "In 1990, SLAUGHTER hit radio, MTV and the U.S. touring circuit like a tornado- coming seemingly out of nowhere to roll through everything in its path and turn it upside down. Touring the world with bands that they loved, Kiss, Ozzy, and others meant the good times were just a song away, and their first hit single, \"Up All Night\" certainly fit into that mold, their second chart-topper, \"Fly To The Angels\" was more representative of the spirituality and awareness that goes into most of the band's music and lyrics. But never were SLAUGHTER more accurately represented that live onstage in front of their legions of devoted fans over the last ten years.\n\n\"Eternal Live\" was the band's 6th record, and their first full-length live release is SLAUGHTER at its best- live on stage. Recorded in- Mexico in front of more than 20,000 fans and one in their hometown, Las Vegas, \"Eternal Live\" captures the excitement of a SLAUGHTER performance and showcased 12 songs off their earlier albums. Sadly, this album must also serve as a tribute to original SLAUGHTER guitarist Tim Kelly (1963-1998)-RIP, who was killed in a car accident. \"Eternal Live\" was Tim's farewell performance, \"explains bassist and producer of all SLAUGHTER albums, Dana Strum.\" And I think he'd be pleased that his last recordings were not just in the studio, but were with our fans there too.\" Uncertain if the band would continue or tour after Tim's passing, the only logical replacement was Jeff Blando who was described by late guitarist Tim Kelly as \"One Hell of a player.\""
