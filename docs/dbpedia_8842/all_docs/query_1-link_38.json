        "text": "GREEN BAY, Wis. â The Trans-Siberian Orchestra kicks off their holiday tour in Green Bay on Nov. 17 at the Resch Center.\n\nTickets are still available for both shows at 4 p.m. or 8 p.m.\n\nâItâs become a tradition that TSO kicks off their holiday tour in Green Bay,â said Terry Charles, Spokesperson for PMI Entertainment, which runs the Resch Center. âTheyâve been here since Monday and did a rehearsal last night, so weâre excited and itâs a heck of a show.â\n\nTSO canceled its tour in 2020 due to the pandemic. This will be the groupâs 25th year.\n\nâItâs best described as symphonic rock,â Charles said. âYouâll see pyro and laser lights and a lot of fog.â\n\nCharles added the show is not for the faint of heart.\n\nâItâs loud and thereâs so much going on,â he said. âIt really takes your breath away and my recommendation is to sit a bit further back to see the full production.â"
