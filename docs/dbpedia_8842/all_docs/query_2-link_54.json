        "text": "Slaughter\n\nEternal Live\n\nCMC International\n\nEternal Live is not the first time Slaughter has released live tracks. Fans will recall the ‘90 EP Stick It Live and the ‘95 compilation album Mass Slaughter, which included live cuts of their hits “Up All Night” and “Fly to the Angels.” However, Eternal Live serves as more than just a concert album; it serves as a memorial to the band’s guitarist Tim Kelly, who was killed in an automobile accident on Feb. 5 in Arizona, while making Eternal Live.\n\nRecorded at concerts in Mexico and the band’s hometown of Las Vegas, Eternal Live is a 12-song collection that further establishes Slaughter as one of hard rock’s premier touring acts. Eternal Live, produced by vocalist Mark Slaughter and bassist Dana Strum, includes two tracks not previously found on the band’s studio albums – the crowd-pumping opener “Rock the World” and “Shout it Out,” which was featured on the soundtrack for Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey. Curiously, the only studio album not represented on Eternal Live is their last one, Revolution. From their debut, Stick it to Ya, Slaughter delights with four of the album’s hits – “Up All Night,” “Mad About You,” “Spend My Life,” and “Fly to the Angels,” a ballad that takes on new meaning since the death of Kelly. Their sophomore release, The Wild Life, presents its crowd-pleasing songs “Real Love,” “Dance for Me,” “Move to the Music,” and “Wild Life.” Slaughter’s third album Fear No Evil brings forth the satisfying songs “Get Used to It” and “Searchin,” where Mark sings in a slightly lower register.\n\nAs a bonus, Eternal Live is an enhanced CD that contains more live tracks, touring information, personal photographs, a discography, interviews, biography, facts, and a retrospective on Kelly, which drummer Blas Elias created. Eternal Live is definitely an album that all Slaughter fans should add to their collection."
