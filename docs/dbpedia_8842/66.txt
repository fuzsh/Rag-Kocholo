1963 - 1998

Slaughter’s family member, guitar player and best friend.

Tim’s joy, humor and music are parts of him that he shared with the world.

Tim left us with great memories and music, through his guitar playing.

His spirit for life, can be felt in any Slaughter song.

Forever In Our Hearts ~

Slaughter

Life is and will always not be the same, without “Tim Kelly.” It still seems like a bad dream, I wish I could wake up and it be back to the way things were….Tim was a true “Rock Star”, Tim lived for the moment and will be part of us no matter where he is”

~ Dana Strum

“The things that we’ve gone through together over the last almost ten years created a bond between the four of us that is beyond description. Tim Kelly has forever changed my life. He was and always will be a part of me, and his spirit will remain with me forever.”

~ Blas Elias

"Tim was always concerned about others. he was a very compassionate man and was the guy who always put a smile on your face. Tim ,You”ll always be on my mind, I think I’ve learned a lesson on how fragile life is, Savor every moment…Spread your wings, and Fly to the angels in Eternal Life…..God Bless you my friend”
