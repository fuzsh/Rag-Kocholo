        "text": "It’s fair to say that Alan Partridge only seems to get better with age, the other week he won the title of The Greatest Comedy Character in UKGold’s survey. UKGold had also previously crowned I’m Alan Partridge the second greatest sitcom of all time (second only to Fawlty Towers). But if we’re picking Alan’s greatest episode, then I would argue that you can’t beat A Room with An Alan. It was the first episode of I’m Alan Partridge that saw Alan lose his chat show commission in perhaps one of the most memorable comedy scenes since Monty Python’s Dead Parrot Sketch.\n\nThe episode marked the first time we saw Alan outside his ‘TV work’. We first met Alan Partridge in 1991 in On the Hour, the Radio 4 precursor to The Day Today where Alan followed the series’ move to TV as a sports anchor. But even before The Day Today’s move to television, Alan’s character had already sprung a life of his own in Knowing Me, Knowing You, the spoof chat show which began in 1992 on Radio 4, transferring to TV in 1994 for one series and a Christmas special. It was a few years later in 1997 that Steve Coogan once again teamed up with Armando Iannucci and Peter Baynham (who had both written for the character since The Day Today) to create unarguably the character’s most famous series – I’m Alan Partridge.\n\nHere in I’m Alan Partridge, Alan seemed to move from a fairly one-dimensional TV show host parody into a fully-fledged sitcom protagonist. For the first time Alan became a DJ for Radio Norwich, a profession that has become so synonymous with the character that it’s hard to believe he didn’t start out with it.\n\nThe series added a surreal element to Alan’s already trademark inappropriate cringe humour. The lap dancing scenes where Alan zones out and imagines himself provocatively dancing, usually for a character he’s met in the episode or in this episode’s case, the BBC Commissioner, Tony Hayers, laughing maniacally whilst holding a bottle of Blue Nun were inspired, as were the random flashbacks to his Toblerone binges.\n\nThis episode spends most of its time introducing us to the people closest to Alan, who are mainly Lynn, his downtrodden PA, and the lovable but slightly bizarre Geordie, Michael. Alan, who repeatedly mentions that his wife has left him for a fitness instructor, now lives in a hotel and has hinged everything on his chat show – Knowing Me, Knowing You getting recommissioned. He has a meeting with the BBC Commissioner and is determined that nothing will go wrong ensuring that he will get his second series.\n\nThe episode almost entirely centres around that meeting, and the cultural impact that scene has had is remarkable. Somehow it only seems to get more relevant as time goes on. Some of Alan’s barmy suggestions for new BBC shows have even become real TV shows ‘Cooking in Prison’ as Alan suggested eventually ended up being made for Channel 4 where Gordon Ramsey taught prisoners how to cook in – Gorden Behind Bars. ‘Youth-hostelling with Chris Eubank’ even became a reality when a tongue-in-cheek marketing campaign for a youth hostel was fronted by Eubank as a direct reference to the joke. No takers yet for ‘Inner City Sumo’ but give Channel 5 time.\n\nYou only have to spend five minutes on Twitter these days to find Alan shrugging back at you in a gif, or somebody commenting ‘monkey tennis?’ every time there’s a news story about ITV or possibly Channel 4’s latest wacky TV commission. There’s even an accidental Partridge twitter account where people send in real life Alan Partridge moments, which I’m sure you’re all aware of.\n\nI’m Alan Partridge only ran for 2 series but has achieved almost universal acclaim. The first series in particular won almost every gong going at the time. The show has been considered so culturally significant that the British Film Institute gave it the title of the 38th best British television series of all time.\n\nThe real genius of Partridge is that his character has manged to move with our times. Mid-Morning Matters, which came years later in 2010 gave Alan “Sidekick Simon”. It was a bold move introducing a new character, but now Tim Key’s bewildered sidekick feels as important to Alan as Lynn or Michael. When they all joined up together for the Alan Partridge movie, Alpha Papa, nothing felt amiss.\n\nReinventing the Partridge brand all those years later freshened up a character that could have been left behind in a wave of 90’s/early 2000’s nostalgia. Alan Partridge is now deeply embedded in our culture and seems to have quietly overtaken comedy juggernauts such as Father Ted or even Blackadder to become the comedian’s sitcom of choice and it’s really all thanks to this scene, which is now over twenty years old, that’s somehow become perfect modern-day satire. How’s that for bouncing back?"
