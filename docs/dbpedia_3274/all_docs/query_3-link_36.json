Also featuring music from Westlife.\n\nBunch of Marys\n\nMartinâs mother Debra hits the campaign trail to support Mary Robinsonâs bid for the Irish presidency, but with little funding decides to turn to the owner of local fish factory, Brendan âTouchyâ Feely, for support. A neglected Martin soon tires of his sisterâs cooking and befriends new boy Trevor whose chef-parents feed the boys like kings - until Martin overstays his welcome."
