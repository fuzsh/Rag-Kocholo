If she talked about her work, sheâ€™d tell you she only pilfers organs for medical research and that she only takes one kidney, and she only steals those kidneys from dishonest people. Itâ€™s hell on her social life. Abe is the doctor and Sam's partner in crime. He isnâ€™t much of a criminal. Except for the kidney stealing. But heâ€™s using that money to fund his research that he anticipates will be able to cure diabetes. So, all for a good cause...? You decide.
