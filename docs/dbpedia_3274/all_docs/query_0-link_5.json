House band: Glenn Ponder and Debonair\n\nWatch a clip from this show\n\n« « Back to previous episode On to next episode » »\n\nAlan's first guest: Playboy's Agony Aunt Daniella Forest\n\nEven though Daniella Forest seemed to be on the show just to plug her autobiography: Luck Be A Lady, Alan was pleased to have her. That was, at least, until he discovered she used to be a man. Dan 'the Man' Forest was then obliged to exit. From a safe distance it was obvious, she had great flapping hands; she could have been a goal keeper.\n\nTony Le Mesmer\n\nAlan then introduced a new section of the show called KMKY Another Alan Partridge. The other Alan in it was Petty Officer Alan Partridge, who worked on a Sealink Ferry. Next up was hypnotist and magician Tony Le Mesmer. Alan had booked him after seeing his show at the Palladium in which Tony had two men stripped to their underpants and barking like dogs. Later in the show Alan himself was hypnotised.\n\nGary Barker and Tania Beaumont - Hollywood Couple\n\nAlan's final guests were Hollywood couple Gary Barker and Tania Beaumont. They came on the show to deny rumours of their marriage failing. In a previous career Gary had been a Mobile Office Equipment Maintenance Engineer. To see whether he still knew his stuff, Gary was invited to fix Alan's broken photocopier.\n\nAlan on the Wheel of Death\n\nAlan ended the show in a way that was far from moribund. Strapped to the Wheel of Death, Alan was spun as Tony Le Mesmer threw daggers at his person.\n\n« « Back to previous episode On to next episode » »\n\nBoy to man.\n\nThose crucial early influences.\n\nOn the Hour\n\nAlan's big broadcasting break.\n\nThe Day Today\n\n\"This is sports desk with me, Alan Partridge.\"\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You (Radio)\n\nA chat legend is born.\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You (TV)\n\nAlan gets his own TV show at last.\n\nI'm Alan Partridge\n\n182 days in the Linton Travel Tavern.\n\nThe Wilderness Years\n\nWhere did Alan go?\n\nI'm Alan Partridge - series two\n\nAlan bounces back.\n\nAlan News\n\nThe latest developments in Alan's career.\n\nAlan for sale\n\nMany of Alan's broadcasts are available in the shops."
