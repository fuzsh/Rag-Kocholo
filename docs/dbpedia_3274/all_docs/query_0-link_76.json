        "text": "When Alan Partridge sat down to lunch with BBC TV’s Chief Commissioning Editor Tony Hayers in the first episode of I’m Alan Partridge, three momentous things happened.\n\nThe first and most important for Alan was the revelation that there wouldn’t be a second series of his TV chat show Knowing Me Knowing You With Alan Partridge. The third was the funniest example of cheese brandishing in a visual medium. In between these two events something extraordinary happens. Alan is obviously disappointed by the news that he hasn’t been re-commissioned and so Hayers offers to listen to his other ideas. He is quite taken aback as Alan turns the lunch into an impromptu pitch meeting.\n\nThis scene not only offers us a hilarious insight into the workings of Alan’s mind, but with the benefit of fifteen years hindsight it seems entirely possible that the panicked scramble of a fictional third-rate television presenter has accurately predicted the future of British television."
