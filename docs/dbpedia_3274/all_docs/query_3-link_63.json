        "text": "First on this tape, episode 10 of Between The Lines series one, Nothing to Declare.\n\nNicky Henson is a Chief Superintendent retiring, using his speech to complain at political correctness. Nothing changes.\n\nKeith Allen is a customs investigator who was observing what he claims to be a meeting between drugs squad officers and drug traffickers.\n\nAllen’s associate is played by Paul Higgins. I couldn’t place him, but I knew I’d seen him in something else. He was suspect copper Derek Hilton in Line of Duty.\n\nWe see part of the scam that’s being investigated – People trying to get into Britain are taken in a container, and they are forced to swallow drug packets as part of the cost. It’s all a bit horrible.\n\nAll in all, this was a rather depressing series, wasn’t it?\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 19th March 1994 – 22:15\n\nNever mind, though, here’s something to cheer you up. It’s an episode of Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. It’s actually the first episode, and his first guest is horse rider Sue Lewis, played by the peerless Rebecca Front.\n\nAlan brings out her horse, and asks her if she’d jump a jump. She explains she can’t, as it’s a concrete floor and would damage the horse’s legs. “Please don’t break my legs” she says.\n\nThe next guest is the new host of This is Your Life Keith Hunt, played by Cornish curmudgeon Patrick Marber.\n\n“I’ve just been told that Roger Moore is at Chiswick Roundabout”.\n\nAlan brings on Hunt’s son. But because of custody arrangements he can’t come within ten feet of him. And it’s birthday, which Keith has forgotten.\n\n“Can someone clear that shit away? It’s in my picture.”\n\nDoon Mackichan provides the music as Shona McGough, which starts off like this.\n\nAnd ends up like this.\n\n“This is interesting, a lady drummer. Close your eyes it could have been a man.”\n\nThe show concludes with ‘An Audience with Roger Moore’ as they wait for the arrival of the actor.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 16th September 1994 – 22:00\n\nThe next episode opens with Alan talking about critical reaction to the show. “I looked up moribund in the dictionary.” I didn’t realise that this might have been inspired by an actual event featuring, who else, Noel Edmonds. And I saw this retweeted by someone into my twitter timeline just yesterday. Because that’s how Twitter works.\n\nHis first guest is Playboy’s agony aunt Daniella Forrest, played by Minnie Driver. I’m not sure this part really gets away with Alan’s appalling transphobia, though.\n\nAlan meets another man named Alan Partridge, Petty Officer Alan Partridge, played by John Thomson.\n\nThe magnificent David Schneider plays magician Tony le Mesmer.\n\nHollywood couple Tanya Beaumont and Gary Barker are the next guests.\n\nI like the bit where Alan brings on a photocopier, because Gary used to repair photocopiers as a job. “I don’t do that shit any more.”\n\nFinally, Alan straps himself to the wheel of death, as Tony le Mesmer throws daggers at him.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC Two – 23rd September 1994 – 22:00\n\nThat’s all the Alan Partridge on this tape, as we leap forward to Christmas. There’s a bit of Eastenders, a trailer for The Addams Family, and a long trailer new dramas The Buccaneers and Dangerfield.\n\nThen, a festive episode of 2point4 Children. Bill has gathered the family to ask about why the phone bill is so high. It’s an interesting point in time scene. First, daughter Jenny has been calling her boyfriend long distance, which is a plot point from the mists of time. But son David has been connecting his computer to ‘the internet’ and receiving Christmas greetings from all over the world. Bearing in mind this was Christmas 1994, it’s understandable that none of the family understand what he’s talking about. I love this collision of venerable and utterly new. Wikipedia suggests this might be the earliest mention of the Internet in a UK comedy.\n\nNot that the practical details of ‘the internet’ are necessarily convincing. When we see David on his computer, he’s concerned because he’s talking to someone who ‘dialled me up’. And whoever it is, it knows who Bill is.\n\nAnd whoever it is offers Bill some Christmas wishes.\n\nAnd it’s able to do whatever she asks for. Including something Rona asked for.\n\nThe lovely Liz Smith appears as a relative.\n\nWhen they family realise that the Bill the computer was looking for was President Bill Clinton, they make a quick exit to France, and the show ends with a song and dance number in what looks like the Noel’s House Party set.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 26th December 1994 – 20:40\n\nAfter this, a trailer for The Lenny Henry Christmas Show. There’s also trailers for Midnight Movie and Dick Tracy.\n\nThen, there’s a whole movie, The Addams Family which isn’t marked on my database, probably because this was just a run-on, and I already had the movie recorded elsewhere, as seen on this tape.\n\nEdited to add: I just learned that Pablo Ferro, the famed title designer, who did the titles for The Addams Family among many others, died a few days ago. I’m so very sorry.\n\nBBC Genome: BBC One – 26th December 1994 – 21:10\n\nFollowing this, there’s a trailer for Gorillas in the Mist.\n\nThen, a news bulletin, leading with the end of a hijack of an Air France plane. It wasn’t the best rescue, since many of the passengers were injured, although all the hijackers were killed. The pictures of the assault are quite scary. A pilot climbs out of the cockpit and falls to the ground, and as the commandos try to breach the door at the front, the stairway slides back, leaving one of the commandos just hanging on to the door. It shows the actual chaos of real life, as compared with the slick operations we see in movies.\n\nThe tape ends during the sport."
