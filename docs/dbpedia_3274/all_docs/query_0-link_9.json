        "text": "Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge, or Knowing Me, Knowing You (sometimes abbreviated to KMKYWAP and occasionally referred to as The Alan Partridge Show), is a spoof chat show hosted by Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge. It was a TV adaptation of the radio series of the same name.\n\nSynposis[]\n\n\"Aiming to 'quite literally put the chat amongst the pigeons', Alan took on prime time TV - and lost, badly. As chat show host he is brash, cheesy and uncompromisingly narrow-minded. Forced into crude clown groups, risque men's dance troupes and fashion designers, he is obnoxious and downright rude. As only Partridge can, he humiliates, infuriates, assaults and even kills his guests - but as always, ends his show like a true professional... 'On that bombshell...'\" (BBC Studios)\n\nFormat[]\n\nKnowing Me, Knowing You followed a standard chat show format, where guests (see list) were invited onto the programme to discuss their life and work with the host. Each show typically had four main guests, as well as some kind of live performance or event. Show 4 was ostensibly set in Paris. Episodes began with Partridge shouting \"A-ha!\" and cracking a couple of jokes, before having a short discussion with musical director Glenn Ponder. This opening segment saw the first use of the greeting \"Knowing Me, Alan Partridge, Knowing You[...] A-ha\" which was used religiously throughout the series. Other segments included \"Alan's Big Pocket\" (relegated to show 3 only), and \"Another Alan Partridge\", where someone who shared Alan's name was invited onto the programme. A one-off hustings for the West Chalfont by-election in show 5 was titled \"Partridge Over Britian\".\n\nGuests on the show were gifted Alan Partridge Tie and Blazer Badge Combination Packs and, in show 6, Alan Partridge masks. These products did not prove particularly popular with guests.\n\nThe set of Knowing Me, Knowing You was deisgned to mimic a \"top international hotel\". A chair, sofa and table were positioned centre-stage, behind which could be found various pieces of set dressing including a fountain, foliage, and a hot tub. The set had two entrances, one for the host (underneath a stage for Ponder and the house band), and one for the guests. There was one additional room, off stage right, which appeared only in show 1.\n\nEpsiodes[]\n\n# First brooadcast 1 16th September 1994 2 23rd September 1994 3 30th September 1994 4 7th October 1994 5 14th October 1994 6 21st October 1994\n\nCredits[]\n\nCast[]\n\nMain cast[]\n\nGlenn Ponder - Steve Brown\n\nAlan Partridge - Steve Coogan\n\nSue Lewis, Tania Beaumont, Gina Langland, Yvonne Boyd, Charlotte Fraser, Bridie McMahon - Rebecca Front\n\nShona McGough, Wanda Harvey - Doon MacKichan\n\nKeith Hunt, Gary Barker, Lawrence Knowles, Philippe Lambert, Martin Dwyer, Forbes McAllister - Patrick Marber\n\n\"Mr. Booky\", Tony Le Mesmer, Clive Sealey, Toto the Clown, Adrian Finch - David Schneider​​​​​​\n\nGuest cast[]\n\nElsie Morgan - Jean Ainslie​​​​​​\n\nMary Partridge - Linda Broughton\n\nDean Maclean - Richard Claxton\n\nGeorgina Clarke - Edwina Day\n\nRonald Biggs - Felix Dexter\n\nDaniella Forrest - Minnie Driver\n\nLisa Thornton - Barbara Durkin\n\nTerry Norton - Alan Ford\n\nLiam Partridge - Sean Gilder\n\nAnne Wiley - Gabriella Hamilton\n\nGuitarst (Shona's band), Nina Vanier - Melanie Hudson\n\nAlain Perdrix - Phillipe Smolikowski\n\nAlan Partridge (sailor), Joe Beasley - John Thomson\n\nScott Maclean - Danny Worters\n\nMinor roles (in order of appearance)[]\n\nSam Hunt - Sam Cavalli-Green\n\nKeyboardist (Shona's band), Cirque des Clunes act - Sarah C.
