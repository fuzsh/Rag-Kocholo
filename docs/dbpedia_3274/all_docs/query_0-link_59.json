What a time to be alive I can now listen to it on my phone! Back of the net!\n\nGood For What It Is\n\nIt's good to be able to listen to, but it doesn't really work as an Audiobook, you need to have seen the series so you have the visual memory of what's going on.\n\nMost of the series cut\n\nRidiculous amount of material cut. Some of it doesn’t make sense because the lead in to a joke has been cut but the punchline hasn’t. Bit of a rip off. Very disappointing and patronising.\n\nRandom out of order clips\n\nJust want to listen to the show in order, not random clips from random guests in a random sequence"
