        "text": "The spoof football recap aired during 1994's satirical news programme The Day Today, co-created by Chris Morris and Armando Iannucci, in which Partridge featured as resident sports reporter.\n\nThe legendary series featured the character's first ever television appearance, although actor and comedian Steve Coogan had previously voiced the role in two shows for BBC Radio 4 (On The Hour and Knowing Me, Knowing You).\n\nA quarter-century on from its original broadcast, Partridge's World Cup Countdown to '94 has remained a firm favourite with its absurd graphics, inept commentary and an elaborate homemade \"soccer meter\" to guide viewers through the group stages.\n\nMore like this\n\n\"The proof is in the pudding and the pudding, in this case, is a football,\" rambles a clueless Partridge as he draws his report to a close.\n\nThis early offering dominated the poll, sweeping up a massive 38 per cent of the vote share, with its closest competition coming in a full 18 points behind.\n\nSecond place went to a standout scene from 2019's This Time with Alan Partridge, in which our national treasure has a surreal encounter with his lookalike: an Irish farmer named Martin Brennan, who insists on singing \"Come Out, Ye Black and Tans\".\n\nMeanwhile, there was a strong showing for Sky Atlantic's Scissored Isle, which features a memorable sequence in which Alan takes a job behind the checkouts at Tesco and is amazed by his zen-like ability to \"chat and scan\".\n\nFor the latest news and expert tips on getting the best deals this year, take a look at our Black Friday 2021 and Cyber Monday 2021\n\nTwo classic moments from sitcom I'm Alan Partridge – \"I've pierced my foot on a spike!\" and \"stop getting Bond wrong!\" – round out the top five, but snagged a significantly a lower vote share.\n\nAlan Partridge's World Cup Countdown to '94 (The Day Today) – 38 per cent\n\nAlan meets his lookalike (This Time with Alan Partridge) – 20 per cent\n\nAlan gets a job at Tesco (Alan Partridge's Scissored Isle) – 16 per cent\n\n\"I've pierced my foot on a spike!\" (I'm Alan Partridge series two) – six per cent\n\n\"Stop getting Bond wrong!\" (I'm Alan Partridge series two) – four per cent\n\nSome Partridge fans may be surprised to see other iconic moments, including Alan's encounter with his biggest fan, his GIF-producing meeting with BBC exec Tony Hayers and \"Dan! Dan! Dan!\" trailed towards the bottom of the pack.\n\nAlan Partridge turns 30 years old this summer, an event that RadioTimes.com is commemorating with a slate of RT Rewind content, including interviews with co-creator Armando Iannucci and screenwriter Peter Baynham.\n\nBuy tickets for this event now"
