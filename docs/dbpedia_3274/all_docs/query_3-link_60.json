I know it's more over-the-top, but the character suits a traditional sitcom so well that it doesn't dampen it for me. Being more full-blown, the performances are bigger but big Alan is always my favourite. I have tears in my eyes in nearly every episode of the series, just a reaction makes me laugh and there are 1 or 2 killer lines in nearly every scene.\n\nArguing with the South African across the door/table, talking to the tax inspectors, going to Dan's house, talking to Michael, Dante's fires, arguing with Dave Clifton, the book review.

Probably my favourite series of a show ever.\n\nTe...ell you what, tell you what it's nine and a half thousand pounds. Everybody! Tell you what, tell you what it's nine and a half thousand pounds!'
