Between promotional films for Norwich firms and his early (3am!)radio show, we see Alan ineptly flirting with the receptionist and sneaking larger plates into the breakfast buffet.  By Series Two he has 'upgraded' to a mobile home next to his partially built new home and can't avoid delaying the builders' work on the house with his pedantic requests.",
