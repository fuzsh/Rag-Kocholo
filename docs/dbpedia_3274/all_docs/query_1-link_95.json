        "text": "Rather than reviewing Steve Coogan’s, who turns 50 on 14 October, 2015, career as a whole, an admittedly scattershot collection of dramas and comedies that fall across a wide spectrum of quality, I would like to instead immediately alienate any American readers that I may have accumulated and focus intently on I’m Alan Partridge, a work that I perceive to be his finest achievement. Like all the greats, Partridge was only with us briefly, his shenanigans sadly limited to two series, though his legacy still echoes around the cavernous halls of British comedy. I’m Alan Partridge marked a high water point in terms of turn of the millennium English comedy, Coogan’s creation still proving to be his most popular export for many of us, now two decades on from its inception.\n\nFirst appearing on BBC radio show ‘On the hour’ and his own broadcast talk-show ‘Knowing Me, Knowing You’, before transitioning into TV with a televised version of KNKY and ‘The Day Today’, Partridge eventually emerged in 1997 as a singular character with his own show. A bumbling, inept, arrogant failed television personality, now relegated to early morning local radio, Partridge is endlessly bitter regarding his downfall but desperately optimistic for its return, detailed thoroughly in his now pulped bestseller ‘Bouncing Back’. Alongside his mildly cretinous Ukrainian girlfriend, his eternally distressed personal assistant and Michael, the Geordie petrol station attendant, Alan traverses the pitfalls of momentary fame and the strenuous responsibilities that come with being a big name in the north Norfolk area.\n\nFor those of you not familiar with Coogan’s work as Partridge it may be a little difficult to grasp the subtleties of the performance and how the character so well condenses the small-Britain mindset prevalent during his tenure, but its two seasons of controlled chaos are endlessly rewarding and maddeningly re-watchable.\n\nRelentlessly quotable, a pitch perfect capturing of a specific level of fame only found in the English celebrity hierarchy and a razor sharp skewering of the British stereotype, I’m Alan Partridge has demonstrated a longevity that seemingly also came naturally to its peers, with The Office, Phoenix Nights and Father Ted still frequently experiencing resurgences of relevance.\n\nThe character proved to be so popular, and his legacy so adored, that the feature film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa (2013) was eventually commissioned in order to revisit Alan, and found him in the exact same place we left him all those years ago. The apprehension grew to a fever pitch and some doubted the films intensions, but these figures, and myself included, were magnificently hushed as Alpha Papa proved to be the renaissance all had hoped it to be, with Alan’s ineptitude ramped up to a hallucinatory plateau, but with space saved for the heart and soul that had been hinted at in the series’ more touching and introspective moments.\n\nIf I were to explain to anyone the career of Steve Coogan then his work on Partridge would be my first port of call, soon followed by 24 Hour Party People (2002) – a vivid love letter to both mine and Coogan’s home city of Manchester, England – and more recently the multiple award winning Philomena (2013). But it is I’m Alan Partridge that will likely always draw his most fervent audience, and despite its relatively short lifespan its influence is still felt and its presence a vital element in the development and proliferation of British comedy… All together now, “AH HAAAAAAAAAAAA!”"
