Included here are all five series of their fantastically skewed comedy show, packed with offbeat sketches and peculiar characters. Meet seedy snooker commentators Ted and Peter; poorly matched crime-fighting duo Angel Summoner and BMX Bandit; a cop who doesn't get results but, by God, he does things by the book; and some nervous Nazis who've just noticed their caps have skulls on them.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nClassic comedy from an underrated duo\n\nBy R. T.

In Ayoade on Top, Richard Ayoade, perhaps one of the most 'insubstantial' people of our age, takes us on a journey from Peckham to Paris by way of Nevada and other places we don't care about. It's a journey deep within, in a way that's respectful and non-invasive; a journey for which we will all pay a heavy price, even if you've waited for the smaller paperback edition. Ayoade argues for the canonisation of this brutal masterpiece.\n\n1 out of 5 stars\n\nListened for an hour and a half, didn't laugh once\n\nBy Wesley on 12-13-19\n\nBorn a Crime\n\nStories from a South African Childhood\n\nBy: Trevor Noah\n\nNarrated by: Trevor Noah\n\nLength: 8 hrs and 44 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n5 out of 5 stars 214,406\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 193,994\n\nStory\n\n5 out of 5 stars 193,023\n\nIn this award-winning Audible Studios production, Trevor Noah tells his wild coming-of-age tale during the twilight of apartheid in South Africa.
