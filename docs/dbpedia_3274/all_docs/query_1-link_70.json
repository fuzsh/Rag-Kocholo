        "text": "'Knowing me Alan Partridge, knowing you... a-ha!' A lot of people say that, when it comes to drama and comedy, the pictures are so much better on the radio. As Alan Partridge says, 'all those people are wrong'. There's a new chat in town as the hit programme comes live from BBC Television Centre, and Alan ushers on a variety of guests including horsewoman of few words Sue Lewis, powerful hypnotist Tony le Mesmer, fashion designer Yvonne Boyd, and husband and wife thespians Tania Baker and Gary Baker. There's also a whole edition of the programme broadcast from sexy Paris, city of French people. Joining Steve Coogan as he squirms his way across the easy chairs are Steve Brown, Minnie Driver, Rebecca Front, Melanie Hudson, Doon MacKichan, Patrick Marber and David Schneider.\n\n1 CD. 1 hr.\n\nStephen John \"Steve\" Coogan is a BAFTA-winning English actor, comedian, writer, impressionist and producer. Born in Middleton, Greater Manchester, he began his career as a stand-up comedian and impressionist, working as a voice artist throughout the 1980s on satirical puppet show Spitting Image. In the early 1990s, Coogan began creating original comic characters which he presented in stage shows, this led to him winning the 1992 Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Fringe, for his show with long-time collaborator John Thomson. The most prominent characters he developed at this time were Paul Calf, a stereotypical lower class Mancunian and his sister the promiscuous Pauline (played by Coogan in drag).\n\nWorking with Chris Morris, Patrick Marber and Armando Iannucci for On the Hour and The Day Today,\n\nCoogan developed his most popular and most developed character; Alan Partridge, a socially awkward and politically incorrect regional media personality, who developed to feature in his own eponymous television series, Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge and I'm Alan Partridge, which were well received and were nominated for five BAFTAs in total."
