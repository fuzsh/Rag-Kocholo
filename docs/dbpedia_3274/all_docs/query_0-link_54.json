        "text": "Alan Partridge, the comedy creation portrayed for over 25 years by Steve Coogan, is making his return to the BBC with a brand new magazine-style show.\n\nHere’s what you can expect from This Time With Alan Partridge, and why fronting his own BBC show again may bring back painful memories for a truly hapless character…\n\n‘There’s a whole episode about Me Too’\n\nThis Time With Alan Partridge is running for six episodes on BBC One, with the 30-minute shows kicking off at 9.30pm every Monday night from 25 February.\n\nThe evening magazine show, which features a tantalising One Show-esque blend of consumer affairs, featurettes and interviews, represents a lifeline for a character whose previous tenure with the Beeb ended in tragedy in the 1990s.\n\nIndeed, the broadcaster has boldly described This Time as “the perfect fit for a man whose broadcasting style has been described as ‘equidistant between chitchat and analysis.’”\n\nCoogan, who will be joined by co-presenters Jennie Gresham and Tim Key (as former-sidekick Simon), has told viewers they can expect Alan to tackle the meatiest of topics in a characteristically direct (if misguided) fashion.\n\nHe told the podcast WTF with Marc Maron: “Me Too – there’s a whole episode about that. That’s such a difficult topic for anyone to talk about for anyone to say anything about, but if you’re doing a character it weirdly gives you this licence to.\n\n“You can get things wrong in a big way and it’s fine because it’s him doing it.”\n\nFans will also be reacquainted with Lynn Benfield, Alan’s beloved, absurdly long-suffering and perennially cardiganed assistant, played once more by Felicity Montagu.\n\nCoogan explained fans will see a woefully out-of-touch Alan struggling for work and relevance in an ever-changing world – indeed, the premise is that he has only been called upon as a temporary stand-in co-presenter.\n\n“He’s sometimes ignorant and prejudiced but he tries to do the right thing. Early on we made him too predictably conservative, a bit like shooting fish in a barrel: a caricature,” he explained.\n\n“Now we do him as someone who realises that he’s got to get on message. He’s struggling to do the thing he’s supposed to.”\n\n‘Knowing me Alan Partridge, knowing you the police’\n\nThe character of Alan Partridge last fronted his “own” BBC programme 25 years ago, the spoof chat show Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge.\n\nEvery episode descended into farce, but the final instalment took a truly calamitous turn in the closing moments when Alan accidentally shot one of his guests, a restaurant critic played by Patrick Marber, “live” on air.\n\nAfter repeatedly insisting “it wasn’t my fault” and demanding that a bagpipe troupe continue their show-ending performance as planned, Alan ended the series being gently escorted off-stage by police as the pipers played out the credits.\n\nIn real life, it’s fair to assume it would be difficult to come back from that.\n\nHowever, Coogan’s creation, who originated as a sports reporter on Chris Morris’s radio show On The Hour in 1991, has cemented himself as one of the most beloved characters in British comedy.\n\nAs well as two series of I’m Alan Partridge on the BBC, Alan has featured in critically-acclaimed movie adaptation Alpha Papa, the bestselling mock-autobiography I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan and a subsequent travel memoir, Alan Partridge: Nomad.\n\nThe character was also resurrected on Sky Atlantic for two series of Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge and as two TV specials: Welcome to the Places of My Life and Scissored Isle."
