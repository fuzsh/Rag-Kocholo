        "text": "Joan Sanderson and Prunella Scales in After Henry.\n\nThe first episode of the sitcom After Henry was broadcast on BBC Radio Four on 17 April 1985. It starred Prunella Scales as Sarah, adjusting to life as a widow. Sarah was caught in an intergenerational struggle with her domineering mother Eleanor and teenage daughter Clare. Eleanor - who heard everything through the local grapevine - was played by the indomitable Joan Sanderson. Clare was Gerry Cowper. After Henry was written by Simon Brett and was a quietly ground-breaking addition to Radio 4’s output.\n\nSarah worked in the bookshop owned by Russell – played by Benjamin Whitrow - who was her confidante. Coincidentally, Russell was openly gay and in a long-term relationship with Bob. Russell was one of the first examples of a “gay best friend” character, at a time when sympathetic depictions of gay people in the media were rare.\n\nAfter four radio series up to 1989, After Henry moved to television on ITV. However, many comedies which started on BBC radio have gone on to wider success on BBC television. These include titles as diverse as Little Britain and The Mighty Boosh, The League of Gentlemen, Miranda and Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge."
