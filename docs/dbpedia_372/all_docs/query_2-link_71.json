A tecnica de sonda local - Correlacao Angular Perturbada - e utilizada em amostras caracterizadas quanto as suas propriedades macroscopicas nomeadamente propriedades estruturais, magneticas e electricas, tendo em vista a obtencao de informacao microscopica relevante via gradiente de campo electrico e campo magnetico hiperfino, focando em particular os seguintes aspectos: -Distorcoes de rede e agregados de polaroes no sistema LaMnO3+Delta. E apresentado um estudo dos gradientes de campo electrica e campo magnetico hiperfino em amostras representativas do sistema LaMnO3+Delta, correlacionando estas propriedades locais com a caracterizacao das propriedades macroscopicas, efectuada nas mesmas amostras. Desta forma, foi possivel estudar a natureza microscopica das distorcoes polaronicas. Foi dada especial atencao ao composto com composicao LaMnO3.12 uma vez que este e um sistema padrao de uma manganite ferromagnetica-isoladora que apresenta uma transicao estrutural romboedrica (R)-ortorrombica (O) perto da temperatura ambiente. O estudo revelou que agregados de distorcoes locais sobrevivem ate 776 K, na fase de estrutura media mais simetrica (romboedrica), onde, por simetria, os octaedros MnO6 deveriam ser regulares. Estas distorcoes sao semelhantes as observadas no sistema LaMnO3 onde os octaedros MnO6 apresentam uma distorcao Jahn-Teller colectiva. Com a diminuicao da temperatura observa-se um aumento continuo destes agregados. Abaixo de uma temperatura critica estas distorcoes relaxam acomodando-se numa estrutura com reduzidas distorcoes Jahn-teller. Verificou-se tambem que a transicao estrutural (macroscopica) pode ser entendida como uma transicao de percolacao dos ambientes microscopicos. -Coexistencia das ordens electrica e magnetica no sistema Pr1-xCaxMnO3.

Bajo women are able to take over their husbandâs role. Bajo fishermenâs households present different conditions from the common fishermen community in which the man and woman can share roles in the family. Although naturally, men and women are created differently which leads to the role difference, the local wisdom of Bajo indicates that women are very dominant in their households. The husband only works in the sea to earn a fortune. Meanwhile, Bajo women, in addition to taking domestic roles such as cooking, taking care of children and cleaning the house, are also in control of the development and survival of their families when their husbands go sailing in the sea. This research is qualitative research. This research was conducted in Peka Besi region of Wakatobi in 2017. The data of this research were collected through observation and interview. The study reveals that women are the leaders and managers of their households. Regarding economic needs, Bajo women process and market the fish caught by their husbands, open a small shop of basic necessities, and sell a variety of traditional food.\n\nSistemas Correctores de Campo Para EL Telescopio Ritchey-Chretien UNAM212\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCobos, F.

Uma descricao linear do efeito ME em termos de campos eletricos, magneticos e elasticos e constantes materiais e apresentada. Um modelo fenomenologico quasi-estatico e usado para ilustrar a relacao entre as constantes materiais, sua anisotropia e os coeficientes MEs transversais de tensao e carga. Subsequentemente, este modelo e empregue para estimar o maximo coeficiente ME direto de tensao expectavel numa serie de compositos tri-camadas de Metglas/Piezocristal/Metglas em funcao da orientacao do cristal PE. Demonstra-se assim como os efeitos MEs sao fortemente dependentes da orientacao cristalina, o que suporta a possibilidade de se gerarem coeficientes MEs de tensao elevados em compositos contendo monocristais PEs sem chumbo como o niobato de litio (LiNbO3; LNO), tantalato de litio (LiTaO3), ortofosfato de galio (GaPO4; GPO), quartzo (SiO2), langatato (La3Ga5.5Ta0.5O14) e langasite (La3Ga5SiO14) atraves da otimizacao da orientacao cristalina. Uma tecnica experimental dinÃ¢mica de lock-in para a medicao da impedÃ¢ncia e efeito ME direto e exposta. O formalismo descritivo desta tecnica, assim como um arranjo experimental desenvolvido para o efeito sao apresentados.

Um estudo comparativo do efeito ME direto em compositos tri-camadas de Metglas e monocristais de LNO e PMN-PT conectados de forma simples e exposto. Embora o PMN-PT possua piezocoeficientes de carga muito superiores aos do LNO, o coeficiente ME direto de tensao demonstrou-se comparavel entre ambos os compositos devido a uma muito menor permitividade dieletrica do LNO.

Climatic conditions were analized first to individuate their role in the present morphogenetic processes; moreover the main morphological features of present landscape were examined as well as the stratigraphy of the outcropping formations, and of the Gran Bajo del Gualicho Formation in particular. Finally, a possible geomorphological evolution of the studied area was traced. Geophysical analyses allowed to estabilish that the paleosurface shaped on the crystalline basement is strongly uneven and shows evidence of the strong tectonic phases it underwent. The result of isotope analyses confirmed that the salt deposits on the Gran Bajo del Gualicho bottom were produced by fresh water evaporation, while strontium isotope ratio suggested that such waters were responsible for solubilization of more ancient evaporitic deposits.\n\n76 FR 29261 - Notice of Intent To Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for the Proposed Campo Wind Energy...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2011-05-20\n\n...

We present a tentative geographic circumscription of the term, combining data on climate, geology, geomorphology, soil, flora, fauna and vegetation. The circumscription of campo rupestre proposed herein is based on the following premises: (1) the classification of vegetation is not an exact science, and it is difficult to attain a high degree of consensus to the circumscription of vegetation names; (2) despite this, vegetation classification is useful for conservation and management. It is thus desirable to circumscribe vegetation types with the greatest attainable precision; (3) there is a need to preserve all montane and rocky vegetation types, regardless of classification, biome, etc; (4) the CRs are formed by a complex mosaic of vegetation types including rock-dwelling, psammophilous, aquatic, epiphytic, and penumbral plant communities. Campos rupestres stricto sensu are a Neotropical, azonal vegetation complex endemic to Brazil, forming a mosaic of rocky mountaintop \"archipelagos\" inserted within a matrix of zonal vegetation, mainly in the Cerrado and Caatinga provinces of the Brazilian Shield (southeastern, northeastern and central-western regions), occurring mainly above 900 m asl. up to altitudes exceeding 2000 m, having measured annual precipitation between 800 and 1500 mm, and an arid season of two to five months.\n\nCampo de velocidade peculiar na teoria linear\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPires, N.\n\n2003-08-01\n\nAglomerados e superaglomerados de galÃ¡xias sÃ£o responsÃ¡veis pela chamada velocidade peculiar (movimentos relativos Ã expansÃ£o pura do universo) das galÃ¡xias. A amplitude destas perturbaÃ§Ãµes depende da densidade de matÃ©ria do universo e do contraste de densidade no interior do volume onde estÃ¡ localizada a galÃ¡xia. Em 1980, Peebles introduziu o fator \"f\", que relaciona a amplitude das perturbaÃ§Ãµes da velocidade com o campo gravitacional peculiar, no contexto da teoria linear. No presente trabalho obtemos uma soluÃ§Ã£o geral analÃ­tica para o fator \"f\" de Peebles do campo de velocidades peculiares, em termos de funÃ§Ãµes hipergeomÃ©tricas, vÃ¡lida para qualquer geometria do universo. Como um teste de nossa soluÃ§Ã£o, os resultados encontrados originalmente por Peebles em 1980 e os resultados mais gerais encontrados por O.

In this study, we tested Hamilton's rule and evaluated the effect of auxiliaries on productivity in the facultative cooperative breeder campo flicker ( Colaptes campestris campestris). Campo flickers have a variable mating system, with some groups having auxiliaries and others lacking them (i.e., unassisted pairs). Most auxiliaries are closely related to the breeding pair (primary auxiliaries), but some auxiliaries (secondary auxiliaries) are unrelated females that joined established groups. We found no effect of breeder quality (body condition) or territory quality (food availability) on group productivity, but the presence of auxiliaries increased the number of fledglings produced relative to unassisted pairs. Nonetheless, the indirect benefit of helping was small and did not outweigh the costs of delayed breeding and so seemed insufficient to explain the evolution of cooperative breeding in campo flickers. We concluded that some ecological constraints must limit dispersal or independent breeding, making staying in the group a \"best-of-a-bad-job\" situation for auxiliaries.\n\nHelping enhances productivity in campo flicker (Colaptes campestris) cooperative groups.\n\nPubMed\n\nDias, Raphael Igor; Webster, Michael S; Macedo, Regina H\n\n2015-06-01\n\nReproductive adults in many bird species are assisted by non-breeding auxiliary helpers at the nest, yet the impact of auxiliaries on reproduction is variable and not always obvious.

J.; Cobos, F. J.\n\n1987-05-01\n\nEl proyecto de instrumentaciÃ³n de mayor importancia que ha tenido el Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias en los Ãºltimos afios ha sido el diseflo y construcciÃ³n del te1escopio IAC8O. Este requerÃ­a del esfuerzo con junto en mecÂ´nica, Ã³ptica y electrÃ³nica, lo que facilitÃ³ la estructuraciÃ³n y el crecimiento de los respectivos grupos de trabajo, que posteriormente se integraron en departamentos En su origen (1977), el telescopio IAC80 fue concebido como un sistema clÃ¡sico tipo Cassegrain, con una razÃ³n focal F/i 1.3 para el sistema Casse grain y una razÃ³n focal F/20 para el sistema CoudÃ©. Posteriormente, aunque se mantuvo la filosofia de que el sistema bÃ¡sico fuera el F/11.3, se considerÃ³ conveniente el diseÃ±o de secundarios para razones focales F/16 y F/32, y se eliminÃ³ el de F/20. Sin embargo, dada la importancia relativa que un foco estrictamente fotogrÃ¡fico tiene en un telescopio moderno, diseÃ±ado bÃ¡sicamente para fotometrÃ­a fotoelÃ©ctrica y con un campo util mÃ­nimamente de 40 minutos de arco, se decÃ­diÃ³ Ilevar a cabo el diseÃ±o de un secundario F/8 con un sistema corrector de campo, pero que estuviera formado Ãºnicamente por lentes con superficies esfÃ©ricas para que asl su construcciÃ³n fuera posible en EspaÃ±a Ã³ en MÃ©xico. La creciente utilizaciÃ³n de detectores bidimensionales para fines de investigaciÃ³n astron6mica y la viabilidad de que en un futuro cercano Ã©stos tengan un Ã¡rea sensible cada vez mayor, hicieron atractiva la idea de tener diseÃ±ado un sistema corrector de campo para el foco primario (F/3), con un campo Ãºtil mÃ­nimo de un grado, y tambiÃ©n con la limitante de que sus componentes tuvieron sÃ³lamente supÃ©rficies esfÃ©ricas. Ambos diseÃ±os de los sis-temas correctores de campo se llevaron a cabo, en gran medida, como parte de un proyecto de colaboraciÃ³n e intercambio en el Ã¡rea de diseÃ±o y evaluaciÃ³n de sistemas Ã³pticos.\n\nEvaluation of Bajo Blanco Sandbar as a Potential Beach Nourishment Borrow Site for Eroding Beaches in Rincon, Puerto Rico\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRojas, C. A.; Canals, M.\n\n2016-02-01\n\nThe municipality of RincÃ³n, Puerto Rico is recognized for its world-class surfing beaches. Unfortunately, the coast from Punta HigÃ¼ero to Punta Cadena in RincÃ³n is experiencing long-term erosion (Thieler 2007), which has caused the destruction of many beachfront homes and hotels and had negative impacts on the local tourism-driven economy. The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether the nearby Bajo Blanco sandbar, located just offshore of these eroded beaches, could be used as a possible beach nourishment borrow site. A high-resolution bathymetric survey of Bajo Blanco sandbar was conducted along with a grain size analysis to compare the grain size distribution of the Bajo Blanco sandbar with the sediment properties of the eroded beaches. It was found that the sediment from Bajo Blanco is finer yet may be suitable as beach fill material for these beaches according to Dean's overfill ratio. Compatibility analysis suggests a total volume of sandbar sediment of approximately 685,555 cubic meters to allow successful beach equilibrium. To evaluate the potential effects of the sand extraction on the nearshore wave climate, numerical simulations were performed using the spectral wave model of the USACE Coastal Modeling System (CMS-Wave). Wave model results for several dredging scenarios suggest that wave energy flux concentrates around the shoal causing an increase in wave height at the northern and southern edges of the shoal. Therefore, conservation of energy leads to a reduction of wave energy flux shoreward of the shoal, causing a shadow of reduced wave height. In addition, the Tres Palmas Marine reserve is located just north of Bajo Blanco sandbar and features some of the healthiest Elkorn Corals in the Caribbean. To avoid excessive sedimentation of these reefs during dredging activities, the Particle Tracking Module (PTM), integrated in the Surface-water Modeling System (SMS), was used to evaluate the Lagrangian particle transport processes along Bajo\n\n78 FR 34373 - Campo Verde Solar, LLC; Supplemental Notice That Initial Market-Based Rate Filing Includes...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-06-07\n\n...

It is bounded by the Crevillente Fault to the north and the Bajo Segura Fault to the south, and it is characterized by a Late Miocene to Quaternary folded cover. We estimate the present-day deformation of the study area from a GPS network with 11 sites. Observation campaigns were carried out four times (June 1999, September 2001, September 2002 and September 2013). We used the 6.2 version of GIPSY-OASIS software to process GPS data in Precise Point Positioning mode (PPP). In order to obtain the position time series in the whole period of these episodic campaigns, all the GPS observations from 1999 to 2013 campaigns were processed with an identical standard procedure. We compared our velocity field estimation with respect to GEODVEL tectonic model to obtain the residual velocity field of the Bajo Segura Basin. We estimated a ~N-S shortening with deformation rates varying between 0.2 and 0.6 mm/yr. These results are consistent with local geological deformation rates although slightly higher. They also fit well with regional geodetic data estimated for the Western Mediterranean.\n\nSpin-Transfer-Torque Nano-Oscillators: Fabrication, Characterization and Dynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCosta, Jose Diogo Teixeira Barbosa\n\nEste trabalho aborda algumas propriedades magneticas e estruturais de nanoparticulas de oxidos e oxidos-hidroxidos de ferro crescidos em matrizes hibridas orgÃ¢nicas-inorgÃ¢nicas.

The basin has 384 KmÂ² area, being 247 kmÂ² in the municipality of Campo MourÃ£o and 137 kmÂ² in the municipality of Peabiru, in ParanÃ¡ State. The Campo River is a left bank tributary of the MourÃ£o River, which flows into the IvaÃ­ River. The objective of this study was to monitor water quality in the Km 119 River and the Campo River, tributaries of the MourÃ£o River, with monthly collection of water samples to determine pH, temperature, turbidity, biochemical oxygen demand, dissolved oxygen, fecal coliforms, total solids, total nitrogen, ammoniacal nitrogen, nitrite, nitrate and total phosphorus. The results obtained were compared with the indices established by the environmental legislation and applied in the determination of the Water Quality Index (WQI) used by the Water Institute of ParanÃ¡ State, regulating environmental agency. Poor water quality in these rivers presents a worrying scenario for the region, since this river is the main source of water supply for the public system. Results of organic matter, fecal coliforms and total phosphorus were higher than the limits established by Resolution CONAMA 357/2005 to river class 2, specially at downstream of the Km 119 River and the Campo River, due to the significant influence of the urban anthropic activity by the lack of tertiary treatment and also rural by the lack of basic sanitation in this area. Results of WQI of Km 119 River and do Campo River indicated that water quality can be classified as average in 71% and good in 29% of the sites evaluated.\n\nPlant Biodiversity Drivers in Brazilian Campos Rupestres: Insights from Phylogenetic Structure\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZappi, Daniela C.; Moro, Marcelo F.; Meagher, Thomas R.; Nic Lughadha, Eimear\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOld, climate-buffered infertile landscapes (Ocbils) have attracted increasing levels of interest in recent years because of their exceptionally diverse plant communities.

Three hundred nineteen nest traps of bamboo canes and black cardboard tubes were monthly inspected at each site during 15Â months. A total of eight species of bees built 97 nests. Four species were common to both sites. Tetrapedia aff. curvitarsis Friese and Tetrapedia aff. peckoltii Friese were the most abundant at campo rupestre and cerrado s.s., respectively, followed by Centris analis (Fabricius) in campo rupestre and Centris tarsata Smith in cerrado s.s. The nesting peaks occurred in May in campo rupestre and in February in cerrado s.s. Three cuckoo bees and one bee-fly were collected as natural enemies. The findings suggest that differences between the sites were related more to ecological factors (floral resources, natural nest sites) than to the altitudinal difference. The species richness was similar to that in other habitats with open vegetation. We demonstrate the need to use several types of trap-nest to increase the range of species sampled; some species used only one of the two types traps provided. We also comment on the limitations of trap-nests in cerrado vegetation. Most cerrado species of bees are very selective in their choice for a nesting site, but bees that use trap-nests are more generalists.\n\nDiscovering research value in the Campo del Cielo, Argentina, meteorite craters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCassidy, William A.; Renard, Marc L.\n\n1996-07-01\n\nThe Campo del Cielo meteorite crater field in Argentina contains at least 20 small meteorite craters, but a recent review of the field data and a remote sensing study suggest that there may be more. The fall occurred Ë4000 years ago into a uniform loessy soil, and the craters are well enough preserved so that some of their parameters of impact can be determined after excavation. The craters were formed by multi-ton fragments of a type IA meteoroid with abundant silicate inclusions. Relative to the horizontal, the angle of infall was Ë9Â°. Reflecting the low angle of infall, the crater field is elongated with apparent dimensions of 3 Ã 18.5 km. The largest craters are near the center of this ellipse. This suggests that when the parent meteoroid broke apart, the resulting fragments diverged from the original trajectory in inverse relation to their masses and did not undergo size sorting due to atmospheric deceleration. The major axis of the crater field as we know it extends along N63Â°E, but the azimuths of infall determined by excavation of Craters 9 and 10 are N83.5Â°E and N75.5Â°E, respectively. This suggests that the major axis of the crater field is not yet well determined. The three or four largest craters appear to have been formed by impacts that disrupted the projectiles, scattering fragments around the outsides of the craters and leaving no large masses within them; these are relatively symmetrical in shape. Other craters are elongated features with multi-ton masses preserved within them and no fragmentation products outside. There are two ways in which field research on the Campo del Cielo crater field is found to be useful. (1) Studies exist that have been used to interpret impact craters on planetary surfaces other than the Earth. This occurrence of a swarm of projectiles impacting at known angles and similar velocities into a uniform target material provides an excellent field site at which to test the applicability of those studies.

Although some discrepancies in the incidence and prevalence rates between geographical regions may reflect methodological differences in the definition and verification of cases, they may also reflect true local differences. To determine the prevalence and incidence of systemic sclerosis in the city of Campo Grande, state capital of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil, during the period from January to December 2014. All health care services of the city of Campo Grande - MS with attending in the specialty of Rheumatology were invited to participate in the study through a standardized form of clinical and socio-demographic assessment. Physicians of any specialty could report a suspected case of systemic sclerosis, but necessarily the definitive diagnosis should be established by a rheumatologist, in order to warrant the standardization of diagnostic criteria and exclusion of other diseases resembling systemic sclerosis. At the end of the study, 15 rheumatologists reported that they attended patients with systemic sclerosis and sent the completed forms containing epidemiological data of patients. The incidence rate of systemic sclerosis in Campo Grande for the year 2014 was 11.9 per million inhabitants and the prevalence rate was 105.6 per million inhabitants. Systemic sclerosis patients were mostly women, white, with a mean age of 50.58 years, showing the limited form of the disease with a mean duration of the disease of 8.19 years. Regarding laboratory tests, 94.4% were positive for antinuclear antibody, 41.6% for anti-centromere antibody and 19.1% for anti-Scl70; anti-RNA Polymerase III was performed in 37 patients, with 16.2% positive.

Nine zones and two subzones were recognised in the Paleogene-Neogene section. The absence of zones NN9-NN7 (earliest late-latest middle Miocene), NP25-NP21 (Oligocene) and NP18-NP1 (earliest late Eocene-Paleocene) implies the occurrence of three stratigraphic breaks/unconformities within the studied interval. Nannofossil assemblages present suggest an open-ocean depositional environment under oligotrophic-surface water conditions for the Miocene section of the well. Hughesius spp. and Umbilicosphaera spp., here named the \"small dark\" group, were recognised as an index of high nutrient concentration. We suggest that small coccolith/nannolith size is a better indicator of eutrophic condition than taxonomic affinity. Morphometric analysis of specimens of Sphenolithus belemnos and Sphenolithus disbelemnos showed that size tends to decrease within the highstand system tract. The influx of nutrients associated with the highstand could explain this size reduction and may also support our hypothesis that small specimens are indicative of high nutrient concentrations in the surface water.\n\nSedimentology and sequence stratigraphy from outcrops of the Kribi-Campo sub-basin: Lower Mundeck Formation (Lower Cretaceous, southern Cameroon)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNtamak-Nida, Marie Joseph; Bourquin, Sylvie; Makong, Jean-Claude; Baudin, FranÃ§ois; Mpesse, Jean Engelbert; Ngouem, Christophe Itjoko; Komguem, Paul Bertrand; Abolo, Guy Martin\n\n2010-08-01\n\nThe Kribi-Campo sub-basin is composed of an Early to Mid Cretaceous series from West Africa's Atlantic coast and is located in southern Cameroon in the Central African equatorial rain forest. It is the smallest coastal basin in Cameroon and forms the southern part of the Douala/Kribi-Campo basin known as Douala basin ( s.l.). Until now, no detailed sedimentological studies have been carried out on the outcrops of this basin located in the Campo area. The aim of this study was to characterise the depositional environments, vertical evolution and tectonic context of these Lower Cretaceous series in order to make a comparison with adjacent basins and replace them in the geodynamic context. Facies analysis of the Lower Mundeck Formation (Lower Cretaceous) indicates the presence of four major, interfigered facies associations, that are inferred to represent elements of an alluvial to lacustrine-fan delta system. The clast lithologies suggest proximity of relief supplying coarse-grained sediment during the deposition of the Lower Mundeck Formation at Campo. The general dip and direction of the bedding is approximately 10Â°-12Â°NW, which also corresponds to the orientation of the foliations in the underlying metamorphic basement. The main sedimentary succession is characterised by a major retrogradational/progradational cycle of Late Aptian age, evaluated at about 3 Ma, with a well-developed progradational trend characterised by fluctuations of the recognised depositional environments. Fluctuations in lake level and sediment supply were possibly controlled by active faults at the basin margin, although climatic changes may have also played a role. The consistently W-WNW palaeoflow of sediments suggests that the palaeorelief was located to the east and could be oriented in a NNE-SSW direction, downthrown to the west. Local outcrops dated as Albian, both north and south of the main outcrop, display some marine influence. These deposits are cut by 040-060 faults parallel to\n\nXenomonitoring of sleeping sickness transmission in Campo (Cameroon).\n\nPubMed\n\nGrÃ©baut, Pascal; Melachio, TrÃ©sor; Nyangmang, Simplice; Eyenga, Vincent Ebo'o; Njitchouang, Guy-Roger; Ofon, Elvis; Njiokou, Flobert; Simo, Gustave\n\n2016-04-12\n\nThe sleeping sickness focus of Campo in South Cameroon is still active, at a low endemic level, for more than a century, despite a regular medical surveillance. The present study focuses on the spatial distribution of xenomonitoring information obtained from an entomological survey performed in the dry season 2012. It appears that humans constitute a third of the blood meals and that the flies' densities were coherent with those classically observed in the different biotopes. Paradoxically, the epicenter of the focus is the place where the risk indicators are the lowest ones. Particular attention was paid to the entomological device so that it covered the main part of human activities in the study area. One hundred and sixty-two pyramidal traps were used to catch tsetse flies twice a day that were identified, counted, dissected. Molecular analysis using classical and specific molecular markers was conducted to determine the importance of trypanosome infections and the nature of the feeding hosts. This information was used to calculate a Transmission Risk Index and to define a gradient of risk that was projected into a Geographical Information System. Conventional entomological indicators such as species identification of tsetse flies or the Apparent Density per Trap per day, show that Glossina palpalis palpalis is the main species in the campo area which is classically distributed into the different biotopes of the study area. Molecular analysis reveals that humans constitute a third of the blood feeding hosts and that 20 % of the dissected flies were infected with trypanosomes, principally with Nannomonas. Nevertheless, one fly was carrying Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, the pathogen agent of sleeping sickness, showing that the reservoir is still active in the epicenter of the focus. Paradoxically, the Transmission Risk Index is not important in the epicenter, demonstrating that endemic events are not only depending on the man/vector contact.

It is a hypo-endemic focus with the disease prevalence varying from 0.3 to 0.86% during the last few decades. Investigations on animal reservoirs revealed a prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense of 0.6% in wild animals and 4.83% in domestic animals of this focus. From 2001 to 2012, about 19 931 tsetse were collected in this focus and five tsetse species including Glossina palpalis palpalis, G. pallicera, G. nigrofusca, G. tabaniformis and G. caliginea were identified. The analysis of blood meals of these flies showed that they feed on human, pig, goat, sheep, and wild animals such as antelope, duiker, wild pig, turtle and snake. The percentage of blood meals taken on these hosts varies according to sampling periods. For instance, 6.8% of blood meals from pig were reported in 2004 and 22% in 2008. This variation is subjected to considerable evolutions because the Campo HAT focus is submitted to socio-economic mutations including the reopening of a new wood company, the construction of autonomous port at \"Kribi\" as well as the dam at \"Memve ele\". These activities will bring more that 3000 inhabitants around Campo and induce the deforestation for the implementation of farmlands as well as breeding of domestic animals. Such mutations have impacts on the transmission and the epidemiology of sleeping sickness due to the modification of the fauna composition, the nutritional behavior of tsetse, the zoophilic/anthropophilic index. To achieve the elimination goal in the sleeping sickness focus of Campo, we report in this paper the current epidemiological situation of the disease, the research findings of the last decades notably on the population genetics of trypanosomes, the modifications of nutritional behavior of tsetse, the prevalence of T. b. gambiense in humans, domestic and wild animals. An overview\n\nGlacial changes and glacier mass balance at Gran Campo Nevado, Chile during recent decades\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchneider, C.; Schnirch, M.; Kilian, R.; AcuÃ±a, C.; Casassa, G.\n\n2003-04-01\n\nWithin the framework of the program Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS) a glacier inventory of the Peninsula MuÃ±oz Gamero in the southernmost Andes of Chile (53Â°S) has been generated using aerial photopgrahy and Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery. The Peninsula is partly covered by the ice cap of the Gran Campo Nevado (GCN), including several outlet glaciers plus some minor glaciers and firn fields. All together the ice covered areas sum up to 260 km2. GCN forms the only major ice body between the Southern Patagonia Icefield and the Strait of Magallan. Its almost unique location in a zone affected year-round by the westerlies makes it a region of key interest in terms of glacier and climate change studies of the west-wind zone of the Southern Hemisphere. A digital elevation model (DEM) was created for the area, using aerial imagery from 1942, 1984, and 1998 and a Chilean topographic map (1: 100 000). All information was incorporated into a GIS together with satellite imagery from 1986 and 2001. Delineation of glacier inflow from the central plateau of Gran Campo Nevado was accomplished using an automatic module for watershed delineation within the GIS. The GIS served to outline the extent of the present glaciation of the peninsula, as well as to evaluate the derived historic information. The comparison of historic and recent imagery reveals a dramatic glacier retreat during the last 60 years. Some of the outlet glaciers lost more than 20% of their total area during this period. In February and March 2000 a automatic weather station (AWS) was run on a nameless outlet glacier, inofficially Glaciar Lengua, of the Gran Campo Nevado Ice Cap. From the computed energy balance, it was possible to derive degree-day factors for the Glaciar Lengua. With data from the nearby AWS at fjord coast (Bahia Bahamondes) we computed ablation for the summer seasons of 1999/2000, 2000/2001 and 2001/2002. Ablation at 450 m a.s.l. sums up to about 7 m in 1999/2000, 5.5 m in 2000\n\nCrustal structure of the southeastern Brazilian margin, Campos Basin, from aeromagnetic data: New kinematic constraints\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStanton, N.; Schmitt, R.; Galdeano, A.; Maia, M.; Mane, M.\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe continental and adjacent marginal features along southeast Brazil were investigated, focusing on the basement structural relationships between onshore and offshore provinces. Lateral and vertical variations in the magnetic anomalies provided a good correlation with the regional tectonic features. The sin-rift dykes and faults are associated with the magnetic lineaments and lie sub parallel to the Precambrian N45E-S45W basement structure of the Ribeira Belt, but orthogonally to the Cabo Frio Tectonic Domain (CFTD) basement, implying that: (1) the upper portion of the continental crust was widely affected by Mesozoic extensional deformation; and (2) tectonic features related to the process of break up of the Gondwana at the CFTD were form regardless of the preexisting structural basement orientation being controlled by the stress orientation during the rift phase. The deep crustal structure (5 km depth) is characterized by NE-SW magnetic \"provinces\" related to the Ribeira Belt tectonic units, while deep suture zones are defined by magnetic lows. The offshore Campos structural framework is N30E-S30W oriented and resulted from a main WNW-ESE direction of extension in Early Cretaceous. Transfer zones are represented by NW-SE and E-W oriented discontinuities. A slight difference in orientation between onshore (N45E) and offshore (N30E) structural systems seems to reflect a re-orientation of stress during rifting. We proposed a kinematical model to explain the structural evolution of this portion of the margin, characterized by polyphase rifting, associated with the rotation of the South American plate. The Campos Magnetic High (CMH), an important tectonic feature of the Campos Basin corresponds to a wide area of high crustal magnetization.

Clouds can also impact world-class sporting events like the Olympics. You may have questions about the role of clouds, or weather, on our daily lives. How is severe weather monitored for airports? What is the impact of clouds and wind on the generation of electricity? One of the projects Edwin is working on is short-term forecasting as itmoreÂ Â» relates to solar electricity. For this, Edwin's team is partnering with industry and academia to study new ways of forecasting clouds, delivering technologies that will allow the incorporation of more solar power into the electric grid. Post a question for Edwin as a comment below, and it might get answered in the follow-up video we'll post in the next few weeks.Â«Â less\n\nThe Study of Natural Radiation Distribution in Soil of Sao Bernardo do Campo\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMatsumoto, M.

The main contribution of the radiation dose is due to the isotope {sup 40}K, with smaller contributions from the elements of the series of {sup 238}U and {sup 232}Th. The results indicate the dose in all of the studied areas is around the average international dose due to external exposure to gamma rays (0.48 mSv/yr) proceeding from natural terrestrial elements.\n\nApplication of MSS/LANDSAT images to the structural study of recent sedimentary areas: Campos Sedimentary Basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nParada, N.

The basin is located on the southeastern coast of Brazil, covering a prospectable area of 100,000 km{sup 2} Campos is a passive continental margin basin originated by the breakup of Pangea and the rifting of the South American and African plates in the Early Cretaceous. The basin's sedimentary section encompasses three megasequences: nonmarine, transitional, and marine, ranging in age from Neocomian to Holocene. Hydrocarbon generation is related to nonmarine organic-rich shales and marls, and hydrocarbon entrapment assumes ascendentmoreÂ Â» migration along fault planes and through salt gaps toward reservoirs ranging in age from Neocomian to Tertiary (mainly turbiditic sandstones). The first onshore stratigraphic well was drilled based on gravity surveys in 1958. The acquisition of new geophysical data, mainly seismic reflection data, followed after 1968. The first offshore well was drilled in 1971, and in 1974, the first oil field, Garopua, was discovered. Giant hydrocarbon accumulations have been discovered in water depths ranging from 400 to 1,800 m since 1984. As of mid-1989, 35 offshore oil fields have been discovered, 760 million bbl of oil, and 490 bcf of gas have been produced. The basin oil and equivalent gas reserves are estimated in 6.0 billion bbl, 60% of which is located in the deep-water giant oil fields.Â«Â less\n\n\"This School Is My Sanctuary\": The Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos Alternative High School.

M.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nIron meteorites present a challenge for the I-Xe dating technique because it is usually the inclusions, not metal, that contain radiogenic xenon and iodine. Silicate inclusions are frequent in only types IAB and IIE, and earlier studies of irons have demonstrated that I-Xe system can survive intact in these inclusions preserving valuable age information. Our previous studies of the I-Xe record in pyroxene grains from Toluca iron suggested an intriguing relationship between apparent I-Xe ages and (Mg+Fe)/Fe ratios. The I-Xe system in K-feldspar inclusions from Colomera (IIE) had the fingerprint of slow cooling, with an indicated cooling rate of 2-4 C/Ma. Here we present studies of the iodine-xenon system in a silicate-graphite-metal (SiGrMet) inclusion of the IA Campo del Cielo iron meteorite from the collection of the Museum of Natural History in Vienna.\n\n[Strategic health planning based on determinants: case of the municipality of Campo Bom, Rio Grande do Sul State.

The producing reservoirs range from the Neocomian to the early Miocene and were deposited in various environments. However, on deep-water submarine fans (turbidites), these reservoirs reach their maximum expression. The ratio between subsidence and sediment influx, associated to halokinesis, generated two major depositional styles for the sections before and after the early Oligocene, which affect the geometry of the turbidite bodies. Albian, Campanian, and Eocene turbidites occur mainly under the present continental shelf and are confined to thatmoreÂ Â» area. However, the Oligocene-Miocene turbidites occur mainly under the present slope. These younger turbidites were deposited as large submarine fans in broad subbasins as blankets, at the base of deep-water prograding sequences, and they have the potential for large hydrocarbon accumulations. These submarine fans are well defined on the seismic data, and specific processing improves the definition of anomalous amplitudes related to the presence of oil in the reservoirs.Â«Â less\n\nEnergy and Mass Balance At Gran Campo Nevado, Patagonia, Chile\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchneider, C.; Kilian, R.; Casassa, G.\n\nThe Gran Campo Nevado (GCN) Ice Cap on Peninsula MuÃ±oz Gamero, Chile, is lo- cated in the southernmost part of the Patagonian Andes at 53S. It comprises an ice cap and numerous outlet glaciers which mostly end in proglacial lakes at sea level. The total ice covered area sums up to approximately 250 km2. GCN forms the only major ice body between the Southern Patagonian Icefield and the Street of Magallan. Its almost unique location in the zone of the all-year westerlies makes it a region of key interest in terms of glacier and climate change studies of the westwind zone of the Southern Hemisphere. Mean annual temperature of approximately +5C at sea level and high precipitation of about 8.000 mm per year lead to an extreme turn-over of ice mass from the accumulation area of the GCN Ice Cap to the ablation areas of the outlet glaciers. Since October 1999 an automated weather station (AWS) is run continuously in the area at Bahia Bahamondes for monitoring climate parameters. From February to April 2000 an additional AWS was operated on Glaciar Lengua a small outlet glacier of GCN to the north-west. Ablation has been measured at stakes during the same pe- riod. The aim of this study, was to obtain point energy and mass balance on Glaciar Lengua. The work was conducted as part of the international and interdisciplinary working group SGran Campo NevadoT and supported by the German Research Foun- & cedil;dation (DFG). Energy balance was calculated using the bulk approach formulas and calibrated to the measured ablation. It turns out, that sensible heat transfer is the major contribution to the energy balance. Since high cloud cover rates prevail, air tempera- ture is the key factor for the energy balance of the glacier. Despite high rain fall rates, energy input from rain fall is of only minor importance to the overall energy balance. From the energy balance computed, it was possible to derive summer-time degree-day factors for Glaciar Lengua.

Concomitant with rifting in the South Atlantic, Neocomian lacustrine rocks, with associated widespread mafic volcanism, were deposited on a vary rapidly subsiding crust. The proto-oceanic stage (Aptian) is marked by a sequence of evaporitic rocks whose originally greater sedimentary thickness is indicated by residual evaporitic layers with abundant salt flow features. An open marine environment begins with thick Albian/Cenomanian limestones that grade upward and basinward into shales. This section, with halokinetic features and listric detachedmoreÂ Â» faulting sloping out on salt, is characterized by an increased sedimentation rate. The marine Upper Cretaceous to Recent clastic section, associated with the more quiescent phase of thermal subsidence, is characterized by drastic changes in sedimentation rate. Stratigraphic modeling of the sedimentary facies suggests a flexurally controlled loading mechanism (regional compensation) with a temporally and spatially variable rigidity. Locally, the subsidence in the rift-phase fault-bounded blocks shows no correspondence with the overall thermal subsidence, implying that the crust was not effectively thinned by simple, vertically balanced stretching. Deep reflection seismic sections show a general correspondence between sedimentary isopachs and Moho topography, which broadly compensates for the observed subsidence. However, even the Moho is locally affected by crustal-scale master faults that apparently are also controlling the movement mechanisms during the rift-phase faulting.Â«Â less\n\nSelecting a proper design period for heliostat field layout optimization using Campo code\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaghafifar, Mohammad; Gadalla, Mohamed\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn this paper, different approaches are considered to calculate the cosine factor which is utilized in Campo code to expand the heliostat field layout and maximize its annual thermal output. Furthermore, three heliostat fields containing different number of mirrors are taken into consideration. Cosine factor is determined by considering instantaneous and time-average approaches. For instantaneous method, different design days and design hours are selected. For the time average method, daily time average, monthly time average, seasonally time average, and yearly time averaged cosine factor determinations are considered. Results indicate that instantaneous methods are more appropriate for small scale heliostat field optimization. Consequently, it is proposed to consider the design period as the second design variable to ensure the best outcome. For medium and large scale heliostat fields, selecting an appropriate design period is more important. Therefore, it is more reliable to select one of the recommended time average methods to optimize the field layout. Optimum annual weighted efficiency for heliostat fields (small, medium, and large) containing 350, 1460, and 3450 mirrors are 66.14%, 60.87%, and 54.04%, respectively.\n\nAnalysis of working conditions focusing on biological risk: firefighters in Campo Grande, MS, Brazil.\n\nPubMed\n\nContrera-Moreno, Luciana; de Andrade, Sonia Maria Oliveira; Motta-Castro, Ana Rita Coimbra; Pinto, Alexandra Maria Almeida Carvalho; Salas, Frederico Reis Pouso; Stief, Alcione Cavalheiros Faro\n\n2012-01-01\n\nFirefighters are exposed to a wide range of risks, among them, biological risk. The objective was to analyze working conditions of firefighters in the city of Campo Grande, MS, Brazil, focusing on risk conditions of exposure to biological material. Three hundred and seven (307) firefighters were interviewed for data collection and observed for ergonomic job analysis (AET). 63.5% of the firefighters suffered some kind of job related accident with blood or body fluids. Statistically significant association was found between having suffered accidents at work and incomplete use of personal protective equipment (PPE). About AET regarding the biological risks, 57.1% of all patients had blood or secretions, which corresponds in average to 16.0% of the total work time, based on a working day of 24 h. Besides biological risks, other stressing factors were identified: emergency and complexity of decision, high responsibility regarding patients and environment, and conflicts. Health promotion and accident prevention actions must be emphasized as measures to minimize these risks.\n\nVariation of surface ozone in Campo Grande, Brazil: meteorological effect analysis and prediction.\n\nPubMed\n\nPires, J C M; Souza, A; PavÃ£o, H G; Martins, F G\n\n2014-09-01\n\nThe effect of meteorological variables on surface ozone (O3) concentrations was analysed based on temporal variation of linear correlation and artificial neural network (ANN) models defined by genetic algorithms (GAs). ANN models were also used to predict the daily average concentration of this air pollutant in Campo Grande, Brazil. Three methodologies were applied using GAs, two of them considering threshold models. In these models, the variables selected to define different regimes were daily average O3 concentration, relative humidity and solar radiation. The threshold model that considers two O3 regimes was the one that correctly describes the effect of important meteorological variables in O3 behaviour, presenting also a good predictive performance. Solar radiation, relative humidity and rainfall were considered significant for both O3 regimes; however, wind speed (dispersion effect) was only significant for high concentrations. According to this model, high O3 concentrations corresponded to high solar radiation, low relative humidity and wind speed. This model showed to be a powerful tool to interpret the O3 behaviour, being useful to define policy strategies for human health protection regarding air pollution.\n\nInversor Resonante de Tres Elementos L-LC con Caracteristica Cortocircuitable para Aplicaciones de Calentamiento por Induccion\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEspi Huerta, Jose Miguel\n\nLos generadores de calentamiento por induccion son puentes inversores con carga resonante, cuya mision es basicamente crear una corriente sinusoidal de gran amplitud sobre la \"bobina de caldeo\", que forma parte del tanque resonante. En el interior de esta bobina se introduce la pieza que se desea calentar. EI campo magnetico creado induce corrientes superficiales (corrientes de Foucault) sobre la pieza, que producen su calentamiento. Los tanques resonantes (tambien llamados osciladores) utilizados en la actualidad son el resonante serie y el resonante paralelo. Aunque ya desde hace algun tiempo se vienen construyendo generadores de alta potencia basados en estos dos osciladores, el exito nunca ha. sido completo en ninguno de los dos casos. Tal y como se explica en la introduccion de esta memoria, los puentes inversores utilizados deben operar sobre una carga inductiva (corriente retrasada) para evitar el fenomeno de la recuperacion inversa de sus diodos y la consiguiente ruptura de los transistores. De la restriccion topologica anterior se deduce que el generador paralelo debe conmutar a frecuencias inferiores a la resonancia, y el serie a frecuencias superiores. A esta restriccion topologica hay que unir otra que es exclusiva del calentamiento por induccion: La corriente por la bobina de caldeo debe ser sinusoidal. De no ser asi, resultaria imposible disponer toda la potencia de calentamiento sobre la pieza en el espesor requerido por la aplicacion. Como consecuencia, los inversores no pueden operar por debajo de la frecuencia de resonancia del oscilador, pues en ese caso se amplifican los armonicos de orden superior de la tension/corriente de entrada situados sobre la resonancia, con la consiguiente distorsion de la corriente de salida. La conjuncion de las dos restricciones anteriores obligan al inversor paralelo a funcionar a la frecuencia de resonancia del oscilador. Esto imposibilita un control por variacion de frecuencia, regulandose la potencia desde la\n\nRift brittle deformation of SE-Brazilian continental margin: Kinematic analysis of onshore structures relative to the transfer and accommodation zones of southern Campos Basin\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSavastano, VÃ­tor Lamy Mesiano; Schmitt, Renata da Silva; AraÃºjo, MÃ¡rio Neto Cavalcanti de; InocÃªncio, Leonardo Campos\n\n2017-01-01\n\nHigh-resolution drone-supported mapping and traditional field work were used to refine the hierarchy and kinematics of rift-related faults in the basement rocks and Early Cretaceous mafic dikes onshore of the Campos Basin, SE-Brazil. Two sets of structures were identified. The most significant fault set is NE-SW oriented with predominantly normal displacement. At mesoscale, this fault set is arranged in a rhombic pattern, interpreted here as a breached relay ramp system. The rhombic pattern is a penetrative fabric from the thin-section to regional scale. The second-order set of structures is an E-W/ESE-WNW system of normal faults with sinistral component. These E-W structures are oriented parallel with regional intrabasinal transfer zones associated with the earliest stages of Campos Basin's rift system. The crosscutting relationship between the two fault sets and tholeiitic dikes implies that the NE-SW fault set is the older feature, but remained active until the final stages of rifting in this region as the second-order fault set is older than the tholeiitic dikes. Paleostresses estimated from fault slip inversion method indicated that extension was originally NW-SE, with formation of the E-W transfer, followed by ESE-WNW oblique opening associated with a relay ramp system and related accommodation zones.\n\n[Work-related accidents on oil drilling platforms in the Campos Basin, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil].\n\nPubMed\n\nFreitas, C M; Souza, C A; Machado, J M; Porto, M F\n\n2001-01-01\n\nThe offshore oil industry is characterized by complex systems in relation to technology and organization of work. Working conditions are hazardous, resulting in accidents and even occasional full-scale catastrophes. This article is the result of a study on work-related accidents in the offshore platforms in the Campos Basin, Rio de Janeiro State. The primary objective was to provide technical back-up for both workers' representative organizations and public authorities. As a methodology, we attempt to go beyond the immediate causes of accidents and emphasize underlying causes related to organizational and managerial aspects. The sources were used in such a way as to permit classification in relation to the type of incident, technological system, operation, and immediate and underlying causes. The results show the aggravation of safety conditions and the immediate need for public authorities and the offshore oil industry in Brazil to change the methods used to investigate accidents in order to identify the main causes in the organizational and managerial structure of companies.\n\nLand use change and ecosystem service provision in Pampas and Campos grasslands of southern South America\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nModernel, P.; Rossing, W. A. H.; Corbeels, M.; Dogliotti, S.; Picasso, V.; Tittonell, P.\n\n2016-11-01\n\nNew livestock production models need to simultaneously meet the increasing global demand for meat and preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services. Since the 16th century beef cattle has been produced on the Pampas and Campos native grasslands in southern South America, with only small amounts of external inputs. We synthesised 242 references from peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 1945 and mid-2015 and analysed secondary data to examine the evidence on the ecosystem services provided by this grassland biodiversity hotspot and the way they are affected by land use changes and their drivers. The analysis followed the requirements of systematic review from the PRISMA statement (Moher et al 2009 Acad. Clin. Ann. Intern. Med. 151 264-9). The Pampas and Campos provide feed for 43 million heads of cattle and 14 million sheep. The biome is habitat of 4000 native plant species, 300 species of birds, 29 species of mammals, 49 species of reptiles and 35 species of amphibians. The soils of the region stock 5% of the soil organic carbon of Latin America on 3% of its area. Driven by high prices of soybean, the soybean area increased by 210% between 2000 and 2010, at the expense of 2 million ha (5%) of native grassland, mostly in the Pampas. Intensification of livestock production was apparent in two spatially distinct forms. In subregions where cropping increased, intensification of livestock production was reflected in an increased use of grains for feed as part of feedlots. In subregions dominated by native grasslands, stocking rates increased. The review showed that land use change and grazing regimes with low forage allowances were predominantly associated with negative effects on ecosystem service provision by reducing soil organic carbon stocks and the diversity of plants, birds and mammals, and by increasing soil erosion. We found little quantitative information on changes in the ecosystem services water provision, nutrient cycling and erosion control\n\nInvasion of the Brazilian campo rupestre by the exotic grass Melinis minutiflora is driven by the high soil N availability and changes in the N cycle.\n\nPubMed\n\nRibeiro, PÃ¢mella C D; Menendez, Esther; da Silva, Danielle L; Bonieck, Douglas; RamÃ­rez-Bahena, Martha Helena; Resende-Stoianoff, Maria Aparecida; Peix, Alvaro; VelÃ¡zquez, Encarna; Mateos, Pedro F; Scotti, Maria Rita\n\n2017-01-15\n\nThe Serra do Rola MoÃ§a State Park (PESRM) in Minas Gerais State, Brazil is a preserved site representative of the campo rupestre biome over an ironstone outcrop that has a high level of plant diversity. Almost 60% of this grassy field has been invaded by the exotic molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora), which constitutes a severe threat to the biodiversity and survival of this biome, particularly due to the impacts of annual fires and inappropriate restoration interventions. Many invasive species exhibit a high demand for nitrogen (N). Hence, this work aimed to study the N cycle alterations promoted by M. minutiflora in a site of the campo rupestre, where the leguminous species Mimosa pogocephala was prevalent. The biome's soils exhibited a high natural N fertility and low C:N ratio. The main N source in this biome resulted from the biological N fixation performed by M. pogocephala associated with Burkholderia nodosa, as evidenced by the total leaf N content, leaf Î´ 15 N signature, nodule occupation and bacterial molecular identification analyses. The displacement of native species by molasses grass was associated with changes in the soil N forms, namely the nitrate increased as the ammonium decreased. The latter was the dominant N form in the native species plots, as observed in the soil analysis of total N, ammonium and nitrate contents. The dominant ammonium form was changed to the nitric form by the stimulation of ammonia-oxidising bacteria populations due to the invasive species. Therefore, the key mechanism behind the invasiveness of the exotic grass and the concomitant displacement of the native species may be associated with changes in the soil N chemical species. Based on this finding and on the high N-based soil fertility found in the campo rupestre N fertilisation procedures for restoration of invaded areas should be strictly avoided in this biome.

The area comprises 9,700 square kilometers largely of catinga-covered tabular uplands which are drained by the perennial Rio Parnatba. The climate is hot and humid most of the year but with distinct wet and dry seasons. Temperature extremes range from 20?C to 39?C and the annum rainfall averages 1,200 millimeters. The area's ground-water reservoir is contained chiefly in sandstone aquifers of six westward-dipping sedimentary rock formations, all part of the Maranhao sedimentary basin. The youngest of these formations, namely the Piaut (Pennsylvarian), Poti (Mississippian), Longa (Upper Devonian), and Cabecas (Middle Devoniar), contain the principal aquifers. Precipitation is the primary source of recharge to these aquifers and is more than sufficient to replenish current withdrawals from wells. Underlying the principal aquifers are the untapped Pimenteiras and Serra Grande Formations (both Lower Devonian) which in areas adjacent to the report area are moderately good to excellent water producers. These aquifers are recharged principally by lateral inflow from the east. Water also occurs in the alluvial deposits (Quaternary) underlying the flood plain of the Rio Parnatba but recurrent and uncontrolled flooding at present (1966) precludes their development. Of little economic importance, because they lie above the zone of saturation, are the thin erosional remnants of the Pastos Bons (Upper Triassic), Matuca, and Pedra de Fogo (both Permian) Formations. There are in the report area about 200 drilled wells most of which are pumped with power-driven engines. The wells range from 40 to 500 meters deep but most do not exceed 150 meters, and practically all are completed open hole. Yields range from 500 liters per day for 6-inch-diameter domestic wells to 240\n\nTime, Weather and Empires: The Campos Rodrigues Observatory in LourenÃ§o Marques, Mozambique (1905-1930).\n\nPubMed\n\nRaposo, Pedro M P\n\n2015-07-01\n\nIn 1905 the Campos Rodrigues Observatory (CRO) was founded in LourenÃ§o Marques (nowadays Maputo), the capital of Mozambique, by then part of the Portuguese overseas empire. In this paper the inception and early history of the CRO are analysed in the broader context of the interwoven history of the Portuguese and British empires in Africa, and specifically with respect to the scientific relations between Mozambique and South Africa. The equipment, personnel, practices and networks involved in the inception and early development of the CRO are brought into focus in order to illustrate the problems and strategies that shaped the establishment and functioning of this observatory, which was conceived essentially as a symbol of imperial stamina and colonial prowess. It is suggested that by providing a focal point for the development of scientific relations between Mozambique and South Africa, the CRO served both Portuguese ambitions for recognition as an imperial power and the emergence of South African nationalism.\n\nA new species of Physoctonus Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1934 from the 'Campos formations' of southern Amazonia (Scorpiones, Buthidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nLourenÃ§o, Wilson R\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFurther studies on new specimens of the rare genus Physoctonus Mello-LeitÃ£o, 1934, lead to the description of a third new species.

Dried blood spot samples were collected on filter paper from 919 individuals between the ages of 1 and 19 and were tested for antibodies against the hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV). The total prevalence was 20.7%, while 94.7% of children under the age of 5 were found to be susceptible to HAV infection. The prevalence of anti-HAV increased with age, reaching 33.3% among individuals aged between 15 and 19, thereby indicating that this municipality has a low level of endemicity for hepatitis A. Age, non-white skin color, accustomed to swimming in the river and more than five people living at home were the factors that were associated with an increase in the chance of a positive anti-HAV result. Mother's education level (secondary or tertiary) was considered a protective factor for HAV infection. The data obtained showed that a large proportion of the children from Campos dos Goytacazes were at risk of HAV infection, which should be minimized with the introduction of the vaccination program against hepatitis A that was launched in the municipality in 2011.\n\nThe advertisement call and geographic distribution of Proceratophrys dibernardoi BrandÃ£o, Caramaschi, Vaz-Silva & Campos 2013 (Anura, Odontophrynidae).\n\nPubMed\n\nFerreira, ClÃ¡udia MÃ¡rcia Marily; Sugai, JosÃ© Luiz Massao Moreira; DE Souza, Franco Leandro; DE Andrade, Sheila Pereira; Vaz-Silva, Wilian; Bastos, RogÃ©rio Pereira; DE Morais, Alessandro Ribeiro\n\n2016-12-09\n\nProceratophrys dibernardoi BrandÃ£o, Caramaschi, Vaz-Silva & Campos 2013 has recently been described and allocated into the P. cristiceps species group, but no information about its advertisement calls has been provided (BrandÃ£o et al. 2013). Here, we describe for the first time the advertisement calls of P. dibernardoi based on specimens from Central Brazil. We also expand P. dibernardoiÂ´s geographic distribution by reporting a new population in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, constituting the westernmost record for this species, and extending its known range approximately 330 km westward of the municipality of AporÃ©, State of GoiÃ¡s (P. dibernardoiÂ´s former westernmost record).\n\nLeishmania chagasi in Opossums (Didelphis albiventris) in an Urban Area Endemic for Visceral Leishmaniasis, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHumberg, Roberta M. P.; Oshiro, Elisa T.; Cruz, Maria do Socorro Pires e; Ribolla, Paulo E. M.; Alonso, Diego P.; Ferreira, Alda M. T.; Bonamigo, Raquel A.; Tasso, Norton; de Oliveira, Alessandra Gutierrez\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe investigated the occurrence of Leishmania infantum chagasi in Didelphis albiventris opossums at a wild animal rehabilitation center in the city of Campo Grande, Brazil. A total of 54 opossums were tested for L. i. chagasi infection in peripheral blood and bone marrow samples. The samples were analyzed by direct examination, culturing in a specific medium, and polymerase chain reactionârestriction fragment length polymorphism. Leishmania i. chagasi DNA was detected by polymerase chain reactionârestriction fragment length polymorphism in 11 (20.37%) animals. A total of 81.81% of positive opossums were captured in areas of known visceral leishmaniasis transmission. These results suggest a role for D. albiventris in the urban transmission of visceral leishmaniasis. PMID:22802435\n\nAnatomy and fructan distribution in vegetativ"
