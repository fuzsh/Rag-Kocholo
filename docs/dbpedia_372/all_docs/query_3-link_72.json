In 1997, the legislature passed a law changing the name of the RMC, effective January 1, 1998, from the Register of Mesne Conveyances to the Register of Deeds.\n\nThe state wide office of the ROD may be a bit confusing to you. The Office of ROD only exists in 15 of South Carolina's 46 counties. In those counties that do not have a separate ROD Office, the functions of the office are carried out by the Clerk of Court. To make matters even more confusing, in 6 of the 15 counties which have separate ROD offices, the ROD is elected. In all of the other counties, the positions are appointed and report to the County Administrator/County Council.\n\nWhether done by the Clerk of Court or ROD, the purpose of the office is to record land records. South Carolina Code of Laws, 1976, Section 30-7-10 makes the recording of documents conveying an interest in real property essential to validity. The law states, in pertinent part, \" all deeds.. all mortgages.. all leases.. all assignments, satisfactions, releases…and generally all instruments in writing conveying an interest in real estate…are valid…only from the day and hour when they are recorded in the office of register of mesne conveyances…\" Thus, state law requires every county to provide an office where real estate transactions for that county can be recorded.\n\nForms and Information\n\nDisclaimer - The following documents are intended as a convenience for those that are trained to complete them. These forms must completed, signed, witnessed (if applicable), and notarized. The Register of Deeds’ staff cannot assist in or provide advice in the execution of these documents.\n\nSCDOR Affidavit of Taxable or Exempt Transfers\n\nMortgage Satisfaction Form\n\nNotary Acknowledgement Form\n\nNotary Probate Form\n\nSCDOR Affidavit of Taxable or Exempt Transfer example:\n\nhttps://dor.sc.gov/resources-site/lawandpolicy/Advisory%20Opinions/IL17-13.pdf#search=affidavit%20for%20real%20estate%20exemptions\n\nContact\n\nLocation:\n\nRichland County Judicial Center\n\n1701 Main Street\n\nRoom 101\n\nColumbia, SC 29201\n\nMailing Address:\n\nRichland County Register of Deeds\n\nPost Office Box 192\n\nColumbia, SC 29202\n\nPhone Numbers:\n\n803-576-1910\n\n803-576-1917\n\nHours of Operation:\n\nMonday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. - 5:00 p.m.\n\nCustomer Service Inquiries:\n\nRodCustomerService@rcgov.us\n\nPlease allow one business day for response to email inquiries.\n\nWhat is Recorded in the ROD?\n\nThe Richland County Office is one of the busier ROD's in the state. Each year, over 110,000 deeds, mortgages, releases, plats, tax liens, and UCC filings are recorded. This office collects approximately $11 million annually in state and county fees and taxes. The documents filed in the office are public information and can be viewed by anyone who comes to search for the information.\n\nWho uses the Office?\n\nTelephone Inquiries"
