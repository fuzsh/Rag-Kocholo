Garcia\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThis paper presents a new algorithm to compute the exact list of tokens expected by any LR syntax analyzer at any point of the scanning process. The lexer can, at any time, compute the exact list of valid tokens to return only tokens in this set. In the case than more than one matching token is in the valid set, the lexer can resort to a nested LR parser to disambiguate. Allowing nested LR parsing requires some slight modifications when building the LR parsing tables. We also show how LR parsers can parse conflictive and inherently ambiguous languages using a combination of nested parsing and context aware scanning. These expanded lexical analyzers can be generated from high level specifications.\n\nRegistration of spring wheat sources of the resistance genes Lr53, Lr56, Lr59 and Lr62\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nSpring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm with the alien derived leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Erikss) resistance genes, Lr53, Lr56, Lr59, and Lr62 has been developed with infrastructure and financial support provided consecutively by the University of Stellenbosch (South Africa), the ...\n\nThe wheat resistance gene Lr34 results in the constitutive induction of multiple defense pathways in transgenic barley.\n\nPubMed\n\nChauhan, Harsh; Boni, Rainer; Bucher, Rahel; Kuhn, Benjamin; Buchmann, Gabriele; Sucher, Justine; Selter, Liselotte L; Hensel, Goetz; Kumlehn, Jochen; Bigler, Laurent; Glauser, GaÃ«tan; Wicker, Thomas; Krattinger, Simon G; Keller, Beat\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThe wheat gene Lr34 encodes an ABCG-type transporter which provides durable resistance against multiple pathogens. Lr34 is functional as a transgene in barley, but its mode of action has remained largely unknown both in wheat and barley. Here we studied gene expression in uninfected barley lines transgenic for Lr34. Genes from multiple defense pathways contributing to basal and inducible disease resistance were constitutively active in seedlings and mature leaves. In addition, the hormones jasmonic acid and salicylic acid were induced to high levels, and increased levels of lignin as well as hordatines were observed. These results demonstrate a strong, constitutive re-programming of metabolism by Lr34. The resistant Lr34 allele (Lr34res) encodes a protein that differs by two amino acid polymorphisms from the susceptible Lr34sus allele. The deletion of a single phenylalanine residue in Lr34sus was sufficient to induce the characteristic Lr34-based responses. Combination of Lr34res and Lr34sus in the same plant resulted in a reduction of Lr34res expression by 8- to 20-fold when the low-expressing Lr34res line BG8 was used as a parent. Crosses with the high-expressing Lr34res line BG9 resulted in an increase of Lr34sus expression by 13- to 16-fold in progenies that inherited both alleles. These results indicate an interaction of the two Lr34 alleles on the transcriptional level. Reduction of Lr34res expression in BG8 crosses reduced the negative pleiotropic effects of Lr34res on barley growth and vigor without compromising disease resistance, suggesting that transgenic combination of Lr34res and Lr34sus can result in agronomically useful resistance.

The resistant allele Lr34 and the susceptible allele Lr34s can be distinguished by three polymorphisms that cause alternation of deduced amino acid sequences of Lr34 at the protein level. In seedlings of a cultivar carrying the resistant Lr34r allele, only a portion (35%) of its transcripts was correctly spliced and the majority (65%) of its transcripts were incorrectly spliced due to multiple mis-splicing events. Lr34 mis-splicing events were also observed at adult plant age when this gene exerts its function. All of the mis-spliced Lr34r cDNA transcripts observed in this study resulted in a premature stop codon due to a shift of the open reading frame; hence, the mis-spliced Lr34r cDNAs were deduced to encode incomplete proteins. Even if a cultivar has a functional Lr34 gene, its transcripts might not completely splice in a correct pattern. These findings suggested that the partial resistance conferred by a quantitative gene might be due to mis-splicing events in its transcripts; hence, the resistance of the gene could be increased by eliminating or mutating regulators that cause mis-splicing events in wheat.\n\nAntilisterial activity of a broad-spectrum bacteriocin, enterocin LR/6 from Enterococcus faecium LR/6.\n\nPubMed\n\nKumar, Manoj; Srivastava, Sheela\n\n2010-10-01\n\nEnterocin LR/6, a purified bacteriocin, exhibited broad inhibitory spectrum both against related as well as some food-borne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas sp., Shigella sp., and Bacillus licheniformis. In this investigation, we have focused on L. monocytogenes as the target organism, as it is not only an important pathogen but can also survive over a wide range of environmental conditions such as refrigeration temperature, low pH, and high-salt concentration. This allows the pathogen to overcome many food preservation and safety barriers and poses a potential risk to human health. The enterocin LR/6 showed a bactericidal action against L. monocytogenes and completely inhibited the growth on agar plates, supplemented with 200 AU/ml of enterocin LR/6. The effectiveness of enterocin LR/6 in completely killing a population of acid-adapted (pH 5.2, 2 h) L. monocytogenes exposed to different temperatures (4-37 degrees C), pH (2.5-8.0), and osmotic (up to 30% NaCl) stress is reported here. This paper focuses on the key issue of killing of the acid-adapted L. monocytogenes cells under adverse environmental conditions.\n\nAdsorption of microcystin-LR on mesoporous carbons and its potential use in drinking water source.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Jeong-Ann; Jung, Sung-Mok; Yi, In-Geol; Choi, Jae-Woo; Kim, Song-Bae; Lee, Sang-Hyup\n\n2017-06-01\n\nMicrocystin-LR (MC-LR) is a common toxin derived from cyanobacterial blooms an effective, rapid and non-toxic method needs to be developed for its removal from drinking water treatment plants (DWTP). For an adsorption-based method, mesoporous carbon can be a promising supplemental adsorbent. The effect of mesoporous carbon (MC1, MC2, and MC3) properties and water quality parameters on the adsorption of MC-LR were investigated and the results were analyzed by kinetic, isotherm, thermodynamic, Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO), and intraparticle diffusion models. MC1 was the most appropriate type for the removal of MC-LR with a maximum adsorption capacity of 35,670.49Â Î¼g/g. Adsorption of MC-LR is a spontaneous reaction dominated by van der Waals interactions. Pore sizes of 8.5-14Â nm enhance the pore diffusion of MC-LR from the surface to the mesopores of MC1. The adsorption capacity was not sensitive to changes in the pH (3.2-8.0) and the existence of organic matter (2-5Â mg/L). Furthermore, the final concentration of MC-LR was below the WHO guideline level after a 10-min reaction with 20Â mg/L of MC1 in the Nak-Dong River, a drinking water source. The MC-LR adsorption mainly competed with humic substances (500-1000Â g/mole); however, they did not have a great effect on adsorption. Copyright Â© 2017.

LR provides the option to store on average either 1.08 references per triangle or 26.2 bits per triangle. Its construction, from an input mesh that supports constant-time adjacency queries, has linear space and time complexity, and involves ordering most vertices along a nearly-Hamiltonian cycle. LR is best suited for applications that process meshes with fixed connectivity, as any changes to the connectivity require the data structure to be rebuilt. We provide an implementation of the set of standard random-access, constant-time operators formoreÂ Â» traversing a mesh, and show that LR often saves both space and traversal time over competing representations.Â«Â less\n\nA simple highly sensitive and selective aptamer-based colorimetric sensor for environmental toxins microcystin-LR in water samples.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Xiuyan; Cheng, Ruojie; Shi, Huijie; Tang, Bo; Xiao, Hanshuang; Zhao, Guohua\n\n2016-03-05\n\nA simple and highly sensitive aptamer-based colorimetric sensor was developed for selective detection of Microcystin-LR (MC-LR). The aptamer (ABA) was employed as recognition element which could bind MC-LR with high-affinity, while gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) worked as sensing materials whose plasma resonance absorption peaks red shifted upon binding of the targets at a high concentration of sodium chloride. With the addition of MC-LR, the random coil aptamer adsorbed on Au NPs altered into regulated structure to form MC-LR-aptamer complexes and broke away from the surface of Au NPs, leading to the aggregation of AuNPs, and the color converted from red to blue due to the interparticle plasmon coupling. Results showed that our aptamer-based colorimetric sensor exhibited rapid and sensitive detection performance for MC-LR with linear range from 0.5 nM to 7.5 Î¼M and the detection limit reached 0.37 nM. Meanwhile, the pollutants usually coexisting with MC-LR in pollutant water samples had not demonstrated disturbance for detecting of MC-LR. The mechanism was also proposed suggesting that high affinity interaction between aptamer and MC-LR significantly enhanced the sensitivity and selectivity for MC-LR detection. Besides, the established method was utilized in analyzing real water samples and splendid sensitivity and selectivity were obtained as well. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) were fed dietary Microcystin-LR (0, 0.46, 0.85, 2.01 and 3.93 microg MC-LR/g dry diet for 8 weeks at 25 degrees C. The results revealed that dietary MC-LR inhibited growth at the end of 8 weeks. The survival of embryos and the RNA/DNA ratio of whole fish decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in fish fed 3.93 microg MC-LR/g dry diet. Heat shock protein (Hsp60) expression was induced in the liver of female and male fish fed diets containing > or =0.85 and 0.46 microg MC-LR/g diet, respectively. The activity of liver caspase 3/7 was significantly higher in female fish fed 3.93 microg MC-LR/g diet and in males fed 2.01 MC-LR microg/g dry diet than fish fed the control diet. The threshold for inhibition of liver protein phosphatase expression was lower in female (2.01 microg/g diet) than that in male fish (3.93 microg/g diet). Histopathological examination showed significant single-cell necrosis in female and male medaka fed diets containing 0.85 and 3.93 microg MC-LR/g diet, respectively. Based on different biomarkers, this study demonstrated that dietary MC-LR is toxic to Medaka and the effects are gender dependent.

This was a prospective single-center study in a general gynecology unit of a tertiary hospital during 33 months. There were 292 consecutive women who underwent surgery after an ultrasound diagnosis of an adnexal tumor. All examinations were by a single level 2 ultrasound operator, according to the IOTA guidelines. The malignancy likelihood was calculated using the IOTA LR1 and LR2. The women were then examined separately by an expert operator using subjective PR. These were compared to operative findings and histology. The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy of the 3 methods were calculated and compared. The AUCs for LR1 and LR2 were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92-0.97] and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), respectively. Subjective PR gave a positive likelihood ratio (LR+ve) of 13.9 (95% CI, 7.84-24.6) and a LR-ve of 0.049 (95% CI, 0.022-0.107). The corresponding LR+ve and LR-ve for LR1 were 3.33 (95% CI, 2.85-3.55) and 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.10), and for LR2 were 3.58 (95% CI, 2.77-4.63) and 0.052 (95% CI, 0.022-0.123). The accuracy of PR was 0.942 (95% CI, 0.908-0.966), which was significantly higher when compared with 0.829 (95% CI, 0.781-0.870) for LR1 and 0.836 (95% CI, 0.788-0.872) for LR2 (P < 0.001). The AUC of the IOTA LR1 and LR2 were similar in nonexpert's hands when compared to the original and validation IOTA studies. The PR method was the more accurate test to diagnose ovarian cancer than either of the IOTA models.\n\nEffects of microcystin-LR, cylindrospermopsin and a microcystin-LR/cylindrospermopsin mixture on growth, oxidative stress and mineral content in lettuce plants (Lactuca sativa L.).\n\nPubMed\n\nFreitas, Marisa; Azevedo, Joana; Pinto, Edgar; Neves, Joana; Campos, Alexandre; Vasconcelos, Vitor\n\n2015-06-01\n\nToxic cyanobacterial blooms are documented worldwide as an emerging environmental concern. Recent studies support the hypothesis that microcystin-LR (MC-LR) and cylindrospermopsin (CYN) produce toxic effects in crop plants. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is an important commercial leafy vegetable that supplies essential elements for human nutrition; thus, the study of its sensitivity to MC-LR, CYN and a MC-LR/CYN mixture is of major relevance. This study aimed to assess the effects of environmentally relevant concentrations (1, 10 and 100 Âµg/L) of MC-LR, CYN and a MC-LR/CYN mixture on growth, antioxidant defense system and mineral content in lettuce plants. In almost all treatments, an increase in root fresh weight was obtained; however, the fresh weight of leaves was significantly decreased in plants exposed to 100 Âµg/L concentrations of each toxin and the toxin mixture. Overall, GST activity was significantly increased in roots, contrary to GPx activity, which decreased in roots and leaves. The mineral content in lettuce leaves changed due to its exposure to cyanotoxins; in general, the mineral content decreased with MC-LR and increased with CYN, and apparently these effects are time and concentration-dependent. The effects of the MC-LR/CYN mixture were almost always similar to the single cyanotoxins, although MC-LR seems to be more toxic than CYN. Our results suggest that lettuce plants in non-early stages of development are able to cope with lower concentrations of MC-LR, CYN and the MC-LR/CYN mixture; however, higher concentrations (100 Âµg/L) can affect both lettuce yield and nutritional quality.

In this study, divalent cations and release of intracellular potassium were used to assess the mechanism of interaction and killing of enterocin LR/6 produced by Enterococcus faecium LR/6 on three target Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, namely Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus sp. strain LR/3 and Escherichia coli K-12. Whilst treatment with enterocin LR/6 in all cases led to a significant loss of viability, suggesting a bactericidal mode of action, E. coli K-12 showed better tolerance than the other two strains. Bacteriocins have generally been reported to create pores in the membrane of sensitive cells and this function is diminished by divalent cations. In this study it was shown that Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) markedly improved the viability of enterocin LR/6-treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. K(+) release as a sign of membrane leakiness was higher in M. luteus compared with the other two test strains. In agreement with the viability response, pre-exposure to Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) substantially reduced the amount of K(+) leakage by M. luteus and Enterococcus sp.; in the case of E. coli K-12, no leakage of K(+) was recorded. These results suggest that enterocin LR/6, which possesses good antibacterial potential, may not be very effective as a preservative in foods containing high concentrations of calcium and magnesium.

A major question has been whether or not entry by these effectors can occur independently of the microbe or requires machinery provided by the microbe. Numerous publications have documented that oomycete RxLR effectors and fungal RxLR-like effectors can enter plant and animal cells independent of the microbe. A recent reexamination of whether the RxLR domain of oomycete RxLR effectors is sufficient for microbe-independent entry into host cells concluded that the RxLR domains of Phytophthora infestans Avr3a and of P. sojae Avr1b alone are NOT sufficient to enable microbe-independent entry of proteins into host and nonhost plant and animal cells. Here, we present new, more detailed data that unambiguously demonstrate that the RxLR domain of Avr1b does show efficient and specific entry into soybean root cells and also into wheat leaf cells, at levels well above background nonspecific entry. We also summarize host cell entry experiments with a wide diversity of oomycete and fungal effectors with RxLR or RxLR-like motifs that have been independently carried out by the seven different labs that coauthored this letter. Finally we discuss possible technical reasons why specific cell entry may have been not detected by Wawra et al. (2013).\n\nDynamics of Total Microcystin LR Concentration in Three Subtropical Hydroelectric Generation Reservoirs in Uruguay, South America.\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez-Piana, Mauricio; FabiÃ¡n, Daniel; Piccardo, Andrea; Chalar, Guillermo\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThis study analyzed the temporal dynamics of total microcystin LR concentrations between the years of 2012 and 2015 in the Bonete, Baygorria and Palmar hydroelectric generation reservoirs in the central region of the Negro River, Uruguay. The three reservoirs showed differents total microcystin LR concentration, with no significant differences among them. Over 20 sampling dates, the three reservoirs exhibited total microcystin LR concentrations on eight occasions that corresponded to a slight to moderate human health risk according to WHO guideline values for recreational waters. By determining the concentration of microcystin LR in cyanobacterial biomass, we identified cyanobacterial populations that occurred over time with varying degrees of toxin production (maximal 85.4Â Âµg/mm 3 ). The microcystin LR concentration in Bonete was positively correlated with temperature (râ=â0.587) and cyanobacterial biomass (râ=â0.736), in Baygorria with cyanobacterial biomass (râ=â0.521), and in Palmar with temperature (râ=â0.500) and negatively correlated with ammonia (r = -0.492). Action is needed to reduce the presence of toxic cyanobacteria in these systems. A decrease in the use of agrochemicals and management changes in the reservoir basins could be successful long-term measures.\n\nProcess optimization for microcystin-LR degradation by Response Surface Methodology and mechanism analysis in gas-liquid hybrid discharge system.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Yi; Wei, Hanyu; Xin, Qing; Wang, Mingang; Wang, Qi; Wang, Qiang; Cong, Yanqing\n\n2016-12-01\n\nA gas-liquid hybrid discharge system was applied to microcystin-LR (MC-LR) degradation. MC-LR degradation was completed after 1Â min under a pulsed high voltage of 16Â kV, gas-liquid interface gap of 10Â mm and oxygen flow rate of 160Â L/h. The Box-Behnken Design was proposed in Response Surface Methodology to evaluate the influence of pulsed high voltage, electrode distance and oxygen flow rate on MC-LR removal efficiency. Multiple regression analysis, focused on multivariable factors, was employed and a reduced cubic model was developed. The ANOVA analysis shows that the model is significant and the model prediction on MC-LR removal was also validated with experimental data. The optimum conditions for the process are obtained at pulsed voltage of 16Â kV, gas-liquid interface gap of 10Â mm and oxygen flow rate of 120Â L/h with ta removal efficiency of MC-LR of 96.6%. The addition of catalysts (TiO 2 or Fe 2+ ) in the gas-liquid hybrid discharge system was found to enhance the removal of MC-LR. The intermediates of MC-LR degradation were analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The degradation pathway proposed envisaged the oxidation of hydroxyl radicals and ozone, and attack of high-energy electrons on the unsaturated double bonds of Adda and Mdha, with MC-LR finally decomposing into small molecular products.

Silver carps were intraperitoneally injected with MC-LR, and RNA-seq and miRNA-seq in the liver were analyzed at 0.25, 0.5, and 1 h. The expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST), which acts as a marker gene for MC-LR, was tested to determine the earliest time point at which GST transcription was initiated in the liver tissues of the MC-LR-treated silver carps. Hepatic RNA-seq/miRNA-seq analysis and data integration analysis were conducted with reference to the identified time point. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed to detect the expression of the following genes at the three time points: heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), interleukin-10 receptor 1 (IL-10R1), apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), and heme binding protein 2 (HBP2). Results showed that the liver GST expression was remarkably decreased at 0.25 h (P < 0.05). RNA-seq at this time point revealed that the liver tissue contained 97,505 unigenes, including 184 significantly different unigenes and 75 unknown genes. Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis suggested that 35 of the 145 enriched GO terms were significantly enriched and mainly related to the immune system regulation network. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that 18 of the 189 pathways were significantly enriched, and the most significant was a ribosome pathway containing 77 differentially expressed genes. miRNA-seq analysis indicated that the longest miRNA had 22 nucleotides (nt), followed by 21 and 23 nt. A total of 286 known miRNAs, 332 known miRNA precursor sequences, and 438 new miRNAs were predicted. A total of 1,048,575 mRNAâmiRNA interaction sites were obtained, and 21,252 and 21,241 target genes were respectively predicted in known and new miRNAs. qPCR revealed that HO-1, IL-10R1, apoA-I, and HBP2 were significantly differentially expressed and might play important roles in the toxicity and liver\n\nToxicogenomic evaluation of microcystin-LR treated with ultrasonic irradiation\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHudder, Alice; Song Weihua; O'Shea, Kevin E.\n\n2007-05-01\n\nMicrocystins are a family of toxins produced by cyanobacteria found throughout the world in marine and freshwater environments. The most commonly encountered form of microcystin is microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Humans are exposed to MC-LR by drinking contaminated water. The toxin accumulates rapidly in the liver where it exerts most of its damage. Treatment of water containing MC-LR by ultrasonic irradiation leads to the breakdown of the toxin. Both the parent toxin and the treated toxin reaction products (TTRP) were evaluated for toxic effects in mice. Animals were exposed to purified MC-LR or an equivalent dose of the TTRP and sacrificed aftermoreÂ Â» 4 h or 24 h. Serum was collected and assayed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity as an indicator of hepatotoxicity. LDH activity was detected in the serum of MC-LR exposed mice indicative of liver damage, but not in control mice. Only a fraction of that activity was detectable in mice exposed to TTRP. Liver RNA was used for microarray analysis and real-time PCR. Individual animals varied in their overall genomic response to the toxin; however, only 20 genes showed consistent changes in expression. These include chaperones which may be part of a generalized stress response; cytochrome P450 which may be involved in metabolizing the toxin; and lipid dystrophy genes such as lipin-2, uridine phosphorylase and a homolog to tribbles, a stress-inducible gene involved in cell death. Of the genes that responded to the MC-LR, none showed significant changes in expression profile in response to TTRP. Taken together, the data indicate that ultrasonic irradiation of MC-LR effectively reduces hepatotoxicity in mice and therefore may be a useful method for detoxification of drinking water.Â«Â less\n\nHighly sensitive detection and discrimination of LR and YR microcystins based on protein phosphatases and an artificial neural network.\n\nPubMed\n\nCovaci, O I; Sassolas, A; Alonso, G A; MuÃ±oz, R; Radu, G L; Bucur, B; Marty, J-L\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe inhibition characteristics of three different protein phosphatases by three microcystin (MC) variants--LR, YR, and RR--were studied. The corresponding K (I) for each enzyme-MC couple was calculated. The toxicity of MC varies in the following order: MC-LR > MC-YR > MC-RR. The sensitivity of the enzymes increased in the following order: mutant PP2A < mutant PP1 < natural PP2A. The best limit of detection obtained was 21.2 pM MC-LR using the most sensible enzyme. Methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile up to 2 % (v/v) may be used in inhibition measurements. An artificial neural network (ANN) was used to discriminate two MC variants--LR and YR--using the differences in inhibition percentages measured with mutant PP1 and natural PP2A. The ANN is able to analyze mixtures with concentrations ranging from 8 to 98 pM MC-LR and 31 to 373 pM MC-YR.\n\nSynthesis of visible light sensitized S, N and C co-doped polymorphic TiO2 for Microcystin-LR MC-LR removal\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nMicrocystin-LR (MC-LR) is considered as one of the most widespread and toxic cyanotoxins, which had been discovered to be hepatotoxic, cytotoxic and neurotoxic.

To understand the molecular mechanisms of MC-induced reproductive system cytotoxicity, we evaluated global changes of miRNA and mRNA expression in mouse Sertoli cells following MC-LR treatment. Our results revealed that the exposure to MC-LR resulted in an altered miRNA expression profile that might be responsible for the modulation of mRNA expression. Bio-functional analysis indicated that the altered genes were involved in specific cellular processes, including cell death and proliferation. Target gene analysis suggested that junction injury in Sertoli cells exposed to MC-LR might be mediated by miRNAs through themoreÂ Â» regulation of the Sertoli cell-Sertoli cell pathway. Collectively, these findings may enhance our understanding on the modes of action of MC-LR on mouse Sertoli cells as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity of MC-LR on the male reproductive system. - Highlights: â¢ miRNAs were altered in Sertoli cells exposed to MC-LR. â¢ Alerted genes were involved in different cell functions including the cell morphology. â¢ MC-LR adversely affected Sertoli cell junction formation through the regulating miRNAs.Â«Â less\n\nEffects of alien and intraspecies cytoplasms on manifestation of nuclear genes for wheat resistance to brown rust: II. Specificity of cytoplasm influence on different Lr genes\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVoluevich, E.A.; Buloichik, A.A.; Palilova, A.N.\n\nSpecificity of expression of the major nuclear genes Lr to two brown rust clones in hybrids with the same maternal cytoplasm was analyzed. It was evaluated by a resistant: susceptible ratio in the F{sub 2}. Reciprocal hybrids were obtained from the cross between the progeny of homozygous susceptible plants of the cultivar Penjamo 62 and its alloplasmatic lines carrying cytoplasms of Triticum dicoccoides var. fulvovillosum, Aegilops squarrosa var. typical, Agropyron trichophorum, and isogenic lines of the cultivar Thatcher (Th) with the Lr1, Lr9, Lr15, and Lr19 genes. It was shown that the effect of the Lr1 gene in the cytoplasmmoreÂ Â» of cultivar Thatcher and in eu-, and alloplasmatic forms of Penjamo 62 was less expressed than that of other Lr genes. Cytoplasm of the alloplasmatic line (dicoccoides)-Penjamo 62 was the only exception: in the F{sub 2}, hybrids with Th (Lr1) had a higher yield of resistant forms than those with Th (Lr15). In the hybrid combinations studied, expression and/or transmission of the Lr19 gene was more significant than that of other genes. This gene had no advantages over Lr15 and Lr19 only in cytoplasm of the alloplasmatic line (squarrosa)-Penjamo 62. In certain hybrid cytoplasms, the display of the Lr1, Lr15, and Lr19 genes, in contrast to Lr9, varied with the virulence of the pathogen clones. 15 refs., 5 tabs.Â«Â less\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF LARGE RIVER BIOASSESSMENT PROTOCOLS (LR-BPS) FOR BENTHIC MACROINVERTEBRATES IN EPA REGION 5\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nNon-wadeable rivers have been largely overlooked by bioassessment programs because of sampling difficulties and a lack of appropriate methods and biological indicators.

The functionalization of SWNHs was performed by covalently binding MC-LR to the abundant carboxylic groups on the cone-shaped tips of SWNHs in the presence of linkage reagents and characterized with Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and a transmission electron micrograph. Compared with single-walled carbon nanotubes, SWNHs as immobilization matrixes showed a better sensitizing effect. Using home-prepared horseradish peroxidase-labeled MC-LR antibody for the competitive immunoassay, under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a wide linear response to MC-LR ranging from 0.05 to 20 microg/L with a detection limit of 0.03 microg/L at a signal-to-noise of 3. This method showed good accuracy, acceptable precision, and reproducibility. The assay results of MC-LR in polluted water were in a good agreement with the reference values. The proposed strategy provided a biocompatible immobilization and sensitized recognition platform for analytes as small antigens and possessed promising application in food and environmental monitoring.\n\n[Survey on the contamination of microcystin-LR in water supply of Shanghai city].\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, He-yan; Zheng, Li-xing; Su, Jin; Shi, Wei\n\n2005-03-01\n\nTo study the pollution level of microcystin-LR in water supply of Shanghai city and the removal efficacy for microcystin-LR through routine water treatment technique. High performance liquid chromatogram (HPLC) was applied to determine the concentration of microcystin-LR in source water, water samples after various water treatment procedures and tap water. The concentration of microcystin-LR varied with sampling seasons and sites and reached peak during summer and fall. The maximum of microcystin-LR was 2.38 microg/L in source water. Coagulation plus chlorine disinfection were found to be effective for the removal of microcystin-LR, while the remove rate through filtration was not significant. And it could also be detected in tap water as high as 1.27 microg/L. The source waters of Shanghai city were polluted by cyanobacteria toxins represented by microcystin-LR. The source water in suburb was more polluted. Routine water treatment techniques can not remove the toxins effectively.\n\nMicrocystin-LR nanobody screening from an alpaca phage display nanobody library and its expression and application.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Chongxin; Yang, Ying; Liu, Liwen; Li, Jianhong; Liu, Xiaoqin; Zhang, Xiao; Liu, Yuan; Zhang, Cunzheng; Liu, Xianjin\n\n2018-04-30\n\nMicrocystin-LR (MC-LR) is a type of biotoxin that pollutes the ecological environment and food. The study aimed to obtain new nanobodies from phage nanobody library for determination of MC-LR. The toxin was conjugated to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH) and bovine serum albumin (BSA), respectively, then the conjugates were used as coated antigens for enrichment (coated MC-LR-KLH) and screening (coated MC-LR-BSA) of MC-LR phage nanobodies from an alpaca phage display nanobody library. The antigen-specific phage particles were enriched effectively with four rounds of biopanning. At the last round of enrichment, total 20 positive monoclonal phage nanobodies were obtained from the library, which were analyzed after monoclonal phage enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), colony PCR and DNA sequencing. The most three positive nanobody genes, ANAb12, ANAb9 and ANAb7 were cloned into pET26b vector, then the nanobodies were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 respectively. After being purified, the molecular weight (M.W.) of all nanobodies were approximate 15kDa with sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The purified nanobodies, ANAb12, ANAb9 and ANAb7 were used to establish the indirect competitive ELISA (IC-ELISA) for MC-LR, and their half-maximum inhibition concentrations (IC 50 ) were 0.87, 1.17 and 1.47Î¼g/L, their detection limits (IC 10 ) were 0.06, 0.08 and 0.12Î¼g/L, respectively. All of them showed strong cross-reactivity (CRs) of 82.7-116.9% for MC-RR, MC-YR and MC-WR, and weak CRs of less than 4.56% for MC-LW, less than 0.1% for MC-LY and MC-LF. It was found that all the IC-ELISAs for MC-LR spiked in tap water samples detection were with good accuracy, stability and repeatability, their recoveries were 84.0-106.5%, coefficient of variations (CVs) were 3.4-10.6%.

Microcystin-LR (MC-LR), a cyclic heptapeptide, is one of the best known toxins able to alter the functions of intestine. This study evaluated the toxic effects and the possible mechanisms of MC-LR on barrier function of the intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) were exposed to 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50 Î¼M MC-LR. Cell viability significantly decreased, while the ratio of apoptotic cells increased after exposure to 12.5Î¼M and higer concentration of MC-LR. As expected, the integrity of a polarized IEC-6 monolayer was affected by MC-LR exposure, as demonstrated by a decrease in the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values, becoming most pronounced at 50Î¼M, 24 h. No effects were detected on the protein expression levels of the tight junction protein claudin at 50Î¼M. However, the expression of occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) declined. Furthermore, MC-LR can immigrate into IEC-6 cells. The activity of protein phosphatases 2A (PP2A) decreased from the concentration of 12.5 Î¼M, showing a dose-dependent decline. These results provide new information that strengthens the concept that the intestinal epithelium is important targets for toxic effects of water contaminants like MC-LR.

However, few data are actually available on the effects of MC-LR on the reproductive system of female fish. In the present study, female zebrafish were exposed to 2, 10, and 50 Î¼g L(-1) of MC-LR for 21 d, and its effects on oogenesis, sex hormones, transcription of genes on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad (HPG) axis, and reproduction were investigated for the first time. It was observed that egg production significantly declined at â©¾ 10 Î¼g L(-1) MC-LR. MC-LR exposure to zebrafish increased the concentrations of 17Î²-estradiol (E2) and vitellogenin (VTG) at 10 Î¼g L(-1) level, whereas concentrations of E2, VTG and testosterone declined at 50 Î¼g L(-1) MC-LR. The transcriptions of steroidogenic pathway gene (cyp19a, cyp19b, 17Î²hsd, cyp17 and hmgra) changed as well after the exposure and corresponded well with the alterations of hormone levels. A number of intra- and extra-ovarian factors, such as gnrh3, gnrhr1, fshÎ², fshr, lhr, bmp15, mrpÎ², ptgs2 and vtg1 which regulate oogenesis, were significantly changed with a different dose-related effect. Moreover, MC-LR exposure to female zebrafish resulted in decreased fertilization and hatching rates, and may suggest the possibility of trans-generational effects of MC-LR exposure. The results demonstrate that MC-LR could modulate endocrine function and oogenesis, eventually leading to disruption of reproductive performance in female zebrafish. These data suggest there is a risk for aquatic population living in MC polluted areas. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With exposure to the extract, the elimination rate of microcystin-LR from the media, which was 0.28Â ng MC-LRÂ l -1 Â h -1 , was significantly higher compared to that achieved with exposure to the pure toxin (0.16Â ng MC-LRÂ l -1 Â h -1 ) after 24Â h. However, intracellular breakdown of microcystin-LR was significantly lower in the extract exposed pellets compared to the pure toxin treated fungal pellets over time. This coincided with reduced intracellular glutathione S-transferase activity with crude extract exposure which could be responsible for the detection of only the glutathione conjugate of microcystin-LR. This paper signifies the importance of using laboratory exposure scenarios which resemble conditions in nature to fully understand and evaluate remediation efficiency. There is merit in using M. hiemalis for mycoremediation of cyanotoxins in surface waters.\n\nAn aptamer-based immunoassay in microchannels of a portable analyzer for detection of microcystin-leucine-arginine.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiang, An; Lei, Xiaoying; Ren, Fengling; Zang, Liuqin; Wang, Qin; Zhang, Ju; Lu, Zifan; Guo, Yanhai\n\n2014-12-01\n\nThe rapid detection of microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR), the most highly toxic among MCs, is significantly important to environmental and human health protection and prevention of MC-LR from being used as a bioweapon. Although aptamers offer higher affinity, specificity, and stability with MC-LR than antibodies in the immunodetection of MC-LR due to steric hindrance between two antibodies and limited epitopes of MC-LR for use in a sandwich immunoassay, no sandwich immunoassay using an aptmer has been developed for MC-LR detection. This study is aimed at developing an aptamer-antibody immunoassay (AAIA) to detect MC-LR using a portable analyzer. The aptamers were immobilized onto the glass surface of a microchamber to capture MC-LR. MC-LR and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled antibody were pulled into the microchamber to react with the immobilized aptamer. The chemiluminescence (CL) catalyzed by HRP was tested by a photodiode-based portable analyzer. MC-LR at 0.5-4.0 Î¼g/L was detected quantitatively by the AAIA, with a CL signal sensitivity of 0.3 Î¼g/L. The assay took less than 35 min for a single sample and demonstrated a high specificity, detecting only MC-LR, but not MC-LA, MC-YR, or nodularin-R. The recovery of two spiked real environmental samples calculated as 94.5-112.7%. Therefore, this AAIA was proved to be a rapid and simple method to detect MC-LR in the field by a single analyst.

In this study, we cloned a 2,326 bp full-length PAL2 gene from Lycoris radiata by using degenerate oligonucleotide primer PCR (DOP-PCR) and the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method. The cDNA contains a 2,124 bp coding region encoding 707 amino acids. The LrPAL2 shares about 77.0 % nucleic acid identity and 83 % amino acid identity with LrPAL1. Furthermore, genome sequence analysis demonstrated that LrPAL2 gene contains one intron and two exons. The 5' flanking sequence of LrPAL2 was also cloned by self-formed adaptor PCR (SEFA-PCR), and a group of putative cis-acting elements such as TATA box, CAAT box, G box, TC-rich repeats, CGTCA motif and TCA-element were identified. The LrPAL2 was detected in all tissues examined, with high abundance in bulbs at leaf sprouting stage and in petals at blooming stage. Besides, LrPAL2 drastically responded to MJ, SNP and UV, moderately responded to GA and SA, and a little increased under wounding. Comparison of LrPAL2 expression and LrPAL1 expression demonstrated that LrPAL2 can be more significantly induced than LrPAL1 under the above treatments, and LrPAL2 transcripts accumulated prominently at blooming stage, especially in petals, while LrPAL1 transcripts did not accumulated significantly at blooming stage. All these results suggested that LrPAL2 might play distinct roles in different branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway.\n\nPhotocatalytic Removal of Microcystin-LR by Advanced WO3-Based Nanoparticles under Simulated Solar Light\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZhao, Chao; Li, Dawei; Feng, Chuanping; Zhang, Zhenya; Sugiura, Norio; Yang, Yingnan\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA series of advanced WO3-based photocatalysts including CuO/WO3, Pd/WO3, and Pt/WO3 were synthesized for the photocatalytic removal of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) under simulated solar light. In the present study, Pt/WO3 exhibited the best performance for the photocatalytic degradation of MC-LR. The MC-LR degradation can be described by pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Chloride ion (Clâ) with proper concentration could enhance the MC-LR degradation. The presence of metal cations (Cu2+ and Fe3+) improved the photocatalytic degradation of MC-LR. This study suggests that Pt/WO3 photocatalytic oxidation under solar light is a promising option for the purification of water containing MC-LR.

A total of 45 healthy subjects were randomly divided into the Taichong (LR3) group, sham acupuncture group and sham acupoint group. Subjects received resting state fMRI before acupuncture, after true (sham) acupuncture in each group. Analysis of changes in connectivity among the brain areas was performed using the brain functional connectivity method. The right cerebrum temporal lobe was selected as the seed point to analyze the functional connectivity. It had a functional connectivity with right cerebrum superior frontal gyrus, limbic lobe cingulate gyrus and left cerebrum inferior temporal gyrus (BA 37), inferior parietal lobule compared by before vs. after acupuncture at LR3, and right cerebrum sub-lobar insula and left cerebrum middle frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus compared by true vs. sham acupuncture at LR3, and right cerebrum occipital lobe cuneus, occipital lobe sub-gyral, parietal lobe precuneus and left cerebellum anterior lobe culmen by acupuncture at LR3 vs. sham acupoint. Acupuncture at LR3 mainly specifically activated the brain functional network that participates in visual function, associative function, and emotion cognition, which are similar to the features on LR3 in tradition Chinese medicine. These brain areas constituted a neural network structure with specific functions that had specific reference values for the interpretation of the acupoint specificity of the Taichong acupoint.\n\nLr41, Lr39, and a leaf rust resistance gene from Aegilops cylindrica may be allelic and are located on wheat chromosome 2DS.\n\nPubMed\n\nSingh, Sukhwinder; Franks, C D; Huang, L; Brown-Guedira, G L; Marshall, D S; Gill, B S; Fritz, A\n\n2004-02-01\n\nThe leaf rust resistance gene Lr41 in wheat germplasm KS90WGRC10 and a resistance gene in wheat breeding line WX93D246-R-1 were transferred to Triticum aestivum from Aegilops tauschii and Ae. cylindrica, respectively. The leaf rust resistance gene in WX93D246-R-1 was located on wheat chromosome 2D by monosomic analysis. Molecular marker analysis of F(2) plants from non-critical crosses determined that this gene is 11.2 cM distal to marker Xgwm210 on the short arm of 2D. No susceptible plants were detected in a population of 300 F(2) plants from a cross between WX93D246-R-1 and TA 4186 ( Lr39), suggesting that the gene in WX93D246-R-1 is the same as, or closely linked to, Lr39. In addition, no susceptible plants were detected in a population of 180 F(2) plants from the cross between KS90WGRC10 and WX93D246-R-1. The resistance gene in KS90WGRC10, Lr41, was previously reported to be located on wheat chromosome 1D. In this study, no genetic association was found between Lr41 and 51 markers located on chromosome 1D. A population of 110 F(3 )lines from a cross between KS90WGRC10 and TAM 107 was evaluated with polymorphic SSR markers from chromosome 2D and marker Xgdm35 was found to be 1.9 cM proximal to Lr41. When evaluated with diverse isolates of Puccinia triticina, similar reactions were observed on WX93D246-R-1, KS90WGRC10, and TA 4186. The results of mapping, allelism, and race specificity test indicate that these germplasms likely have the same gene for resistance to leaf rust.\n\nPhytophthora parasitica Effector PpRxLR2 Suppresses Nicotiana benthamiana Immunity.\n\nPubMed\n\nDalio, R J D; Maximo, H J; Oliveira, T S; Dias, R O; Breton, M C; Felizatti, H; Machado, M\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPhytophthora species secrete several classes of effector proteins during interaction with their hosts. These proteins can have multiple functions including modulation of host physiology and immunity. The RxLR effectors have the ability to enter plant cells using the plant machinery. Some of these effectors have been characterized as immunity suppressors; however, very little is known about their functions in the interaction between Phytophthora parasitica and its hosts. Using a bioinformatics pipeline, we have identified 172 candidate RxLR effectors (CREs) in the isolate IAC 01_95 of P. parasitica. Of these 172 CREs, 93 were found to be also present in eight other genomes of P. parasitica, isolated from different hosts and continents. After transcriptomics and gene expression analysis, we have found five CREs to be up-regulated in in-vitro and in-planta samples. Subsequently, we selected three CREs for functional characterization in the model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. We show that PpRxLR2 is able to completely suppress INF-1-induced cell death, whereas PpRxLR3 and PpRxLR5 moderately suppressed N. benthamiana immunity in a less-extensive manner. Moreover, we confirmed the effector-triggered susceptibility activity of these proteins after transient transformation and infection of N. benthamiana plants. All three CREs enhanced virulence of P. parasitica during the interaction with N. benthamiana. These effectors, in particular PpRxLR2, can be targeted for the development of biotechnology-based control strategies of P. parasitica diseases.\n\nLACK OF TERATOGENICITY OF MICROCYSTIN-LR IN THE MOUSE AND TOAD\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nAbstract.

The influence of initial conditions including pH value, NaNO(2) concentration, MC-LR concentration and UV intensity were studied. MC-LR was degraded in the presence of HNO(2); enhanced degradation of MC-LR was observed with 365nm UV irradiation, caused by the generation of hydroxyl radicals through the photolysis of HNO(2). The degradation processes of MC-LR could well fit the pseudo-first-order kinetics. Mass spectrometry was applied for identification of the byproducts and the analysis of degradation mechanisms. Major degradation pathways were proposed according to the results of LC-MS analysis. The degradation of MC-LR was initiated via three major pathways: attack of hydroxyl radicals on the conjugated carbon double bonds of Adda, attack of hydroxyl radicals on the benzene ring of Adda, and attack of nitrosonium ion on the benzene ring of Adda.

However, the effects of MC on macrophytes at concentrations of environmental relevance are largely unknown. The main objective of this study was to analyze the allelopathic effects of MC-LR at natural concentrations (1, 8 and 16 Î¼g MC-LR/L) on five charophyte species (Chara aspera, C. baltica, C. hispida, C. vulgaris and Nitella hyalina) and the angiosperm Myriophyllum spicatum. Macrophyte specimens were obtained from a restored area located in Albufera de ValÃ¨ncia Natural Park, a protected coastal Mediterranean wetland. Two different experiments were conducted involving (i) the addition of MC-LR to natural sediment to evaluate its effects on seed germination and (ii) the addition of MC-LR to water cultures of macrophytes to evaluate its effects on growth and metabolic functions. In water, the MC-LR concentration decreased by 84% in two weeks; the loss was not significant in sediment. The first seedlings (all C. hispida) emerged from the wetland sediment following a delay of a few days in the presence of MC-LR. The germination rates in 8 and 16 Î¼g MC-LR/L treatments were 44% and 11% of that occurring in the absence of MC, but these differences disappeared over time. The final density was 6-7 germlings/dm(3). Final germling length was unaffected by MC-LR. Rotifers (Lecane spp.) emerging from the natural sediment during the experiment were favored by MC-LR; the opposite pattern was observed in the cladoceran Daphnia magna. The growth rates of C. vulgaris, C. baltica and N. hyalina were unaffected by MC exposure, whereas those of C. hispida and C. aspera were reduced in the MC treatments relative to the control treatment. The concentration of chlorophyll-a and the in vivo net photosynthetic rate were lower in the presence of MC-LR, even at the lowest concentration, for all of the characeans tested.

LeftâRight (L/R) asymmetry in bilateria is essential for handed positioning, morphogenesis and ultimately the function of organs (including the brain), with defective L/R asymmetry leading to severe pathologies in human. How and when symmetry is initially broken during embryogenesis remains debated and is a major focus in the field. Work done over the past 20 years, in both vertebrate and invertebrate models, has revealed a number of distinct pathways and mechanisms important for establishing L/R asymmetry and for spreading it to tissues and organs. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge and discuss the diversity of L/R patterning from cells to organs during evolution.

All gas-liquid surface tension is eliminated, increasing compliance and providing lung protection due to lower inflation pressures. Tidal liquid ventilation is achieved by cycling fluid from a reservoir to and from the lung by a ventilator. Current approaches are microprocessor-based with feedback control. During inspiration, warmed oxygenated PFC liquid is pumped from a fluid reservoir/gas exchanger into the lung. PFC fluid is conserved by condensing (60-80% efficiency) vapor in the expired gas. A feedback-control system was developed to automatically replace PFC lost due to condenser inefficiency. This loss/restoration (L/R) system consists of a PFC-vapor thermal detector (+/- 2.5%), pneumatics, amplifiers, a gas flow detector (+/- 1%), a PFC pump (+/- 5%), and a controller. Gravimetric studies of perflubron loss from a flask due to evaporation were compared with experimental L/R results and found to be within +/- 1.4%. In addition, when L/R studies were conducted with a previously reported liquid ventilation system over a four-hour period, the L/R system maintained system perflubron volume to within +/- 1% of prime volume and 11.5% of replacement volume, and the difference between experimental PFC loss and that of the L/R system was 1.8 mL/hr. These studies suggest that the PFC L/R system may have significant economic (appropriate dosing for PFC loss) as well as physiologic (maintenance of PFC inventory in the lungs and liquid ventilator) impact on liquid ventilation procedures.\n\nContrast ultrasound LI-RADS LR-5 identifies hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis in a multicenter restropective study of 1,006 nodules.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerzi, Eleonora; Iavarone, Massimo; Pompili, Maurizio; Veronese, Letizia; Cabibbo, Giuseppe; Fraquelli, Mirella; Riccardi, Laura; De Bonis, Ludovico; Sangiovanni, Angelo; Leoni, Simona; Zocco, Maria Assunta; Rossi, Sandro; Alessi, Nicola; Wilson, Stephanie R; Piscaglia, Fabio\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe use of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhosis was questioned because of the risk of a false positive diagnosis in cases of cholangiocarcinoma. The American College of Radiology has recently released a scheme (CEUS Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System [LI-RADSÂ®]) to classify lesions at risk of HCC investigated by CEUS. The aim of the present study was to validate this LI-RADS scheme for the diagnosis of HCC. A total of 1,006 nodules from 848 patients with chronic liver disease at risk of HCC were collected in five Italian centers and retrospectively analyzed. Nodules were classified as LR-5, (HCC) if â¥1â¯cm with arterial phase hyperenhancement, and late washout (onset â¥60 s after contrast injection) of mild degree. Rim enhancement and/or early and/or marked washout qualified lesions as LR-M (malignant, but not specific for HCC). Other combinations qualified lesions at intermediate risk for HCC (LR-3) or probable HCC (LR-4). Diagnostic reference standard was CT/MRI diagnosis of HCC (nâ¯=â¯506) or histology (nâ¯=â¯500). The median nodule size was 2â¯cm. Of 1,006 nodules, 820 (81%) were HCC, 40 (4%) were cholangiocarcinoma, 116 (11%) regenerative nodules (Â±dysplastic). The LR-5 category (52% of all nodules) was 98.5% predictive of HCC, with no risk of misdiagnosis for pure cholangiocarcinoma. Sensitivity for HCC was 62%. All LR-M nodules were malignant and the majority of non-hepatocellular origin. Over 75% of cholangiocarcinomas were LR-M. The LR-3 category included 203 lesions (HCC 96 [47%]) and the LR-4 202 (HCC 173 [87%]). The CEUS LI-RADS class LR-5 is highly specific for HCC, enabling its use for a confident non-invasive diagnosis. This is a retrospective study of approximately 1,000 focal lesions at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Herein, we demonstrate that the refined definition of the typical contrast enhanced ultrasound pattern of HCC introduced by the Liver Imaging\n\nThe wheat Lr34 multipathogen resistance gene confers resistance to anthracnose and rust in sorghum.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchnippenkoetter, Wendelin; Lo, Clive; Liu, Guoquan; Dibley, Katherine; Chan, Wai Lung; White, Jodie; Milne, Ricky; Zwart, Alexander; Kwong, Eunjung; Keller, Beat; Godwin, Ian; Krattinger, Simon G; Lagudah, Evans\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe ability of the wheat Lr34 multipathogen resistance gene (Lr34res) to function across a wide taxonomic boundary was investigated in transgenic Sorghum bicolor. Increased resistance to sorghum rust and anthracnose disease symptoms following infection with the biotrophic pathogen Puccinia purpurea and the hemibiotroph Colletotrichum sublineolum, respectively, occurred in transgenic plants expressing the Lr34res ABC transporter. Transgenic sorghum lines that highly expressed the wheat Lr34res gene exhibited immunity to sorghum rust compared to the low-expressing single copy Lr34res genotype that conferred partial resistance. Pathogen-induced pigmentation mediated by flavonoid phytoalexins was evident on transgenic sorghum leaves following P.Â purpurea infection within 24-72Â h, which paralleled Lr34res gene expression. Elevated expression of flavone synthase II, flavanone 4-reductase and dihydroflavonol reductase genes which control the biosynthesis of flavonoid phytoalexins characterized the highly expressing Lr34res transgenic lines 24-h post-inoculation with P.Â purpurea. Metabolite analysis of mesocotyls infected with C.Â sublineolum showed increased levels of 3-deoxyanthocyanidin metabolites were associated with Lr34res expression, concomitant with reduced symptoms of anthracnose.

Removal of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) from drinking water was evaluated at the laboratory pilot scale using either granular activated carbon (GAC) or powdered activated carbon (PAC) and compared with the treatment using anthracite as filter material. Virgin GAC was more effective at removing MC-LR (initial concentration ranging from 9 to 47 microg L(-1)) to reach the World Health Organization recommended level (1.0 microg L(-1)). When the GAC filter was colonized by bacteria, the filter became less effective at removing MC-LR owing to competitive reactions occurring between protein adsorption (released by bacteria) and MC-LR adsorption. Using PAC, the concentration of MC-LR decreased from 22 to 3 microg L(-1) (removal of 86% of MC-LR) by the addition of 100 mg PAC L(-1).\n\nUnveiling New Degradation Intermediates/Pathways from the Photocatalytic Degradation of Microcystin-LR\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThis study focuses on the identification of reaction intermediates formed during the photocatalytic degradation of the cyanotoxin microcystin-LR with immobilized TiO2 Tphotocatalysts at neutral pH.

Vascular endothelial cell apoptosis has been implicated in the pathophysiology and progression of atherosclerosis. We investigated whether the advanced glycation end-product inhibitor LR-90 could prevent MGO-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). HUVECs were pre-treated with LR-90 and then stimulated with MGO. Cell morphology, cytotoxicity and apoptosis were evaluated by light microscopy, MTT assay, and Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide double staining, respectively. Levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cytochrome c, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and caspase activities were assessed by Western blotting. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were measured with fluorescent probes. LR-90 dose-dependently prevented MGO-associated HUVEC cytotoxicity and apoptotic biochemical changes such as loss of MMP, increased Bax/Bcl-2 protein ratio, mitochondrial cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3 and 9. Additionally, LR-90 blocked intracellular ROS formation and MAPK (p44/p42, p38, JNK) activation, though the latter seem to be not directly involved in MGO-induced HUVEC apoptosis. LR-90 prevents MGO-induced HUVEC apoptosis by inhibiting ROS and associated mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic signaling cascades, suggesting that LR-90 possess cytoprotective ability which could be beneficial in prevention of diabetic related-atherosclerosis.

The large lateral dimensions and high surface areas of two-dimensional layered WS2 nanosheets enable easy adsorption of the MC-LR-BHHBCB-Eu3+ conjugate, that lead to efficient quenching of the luminescence of Eu3+ complex via energy transfer or electron transfer process. However, the addition of monoclonal anti-MC-LR antibody can induce the formation of MC-LR-BHHBCB-Eu3+/antibody immune complex, which prevents the interaction between WS2 nanosheets and MC-LR-BHHBCB-Eu3+ to result in the restoration of Eu3+ luminescence. This signal transduction mechanism made it possible for analysis of the target MC-LR in a homogeneous system. The present method has advantages of rapidity and simplicity since the B/F (bound reagent/free reagent) separation steps, the solid-phase carrier and antibody labeling or modification process are not necessary. The proposed immunosensing system displayed a wide linear range, good precision and accuracy, and comparable sensitivity with a detection limit of 0.3 Î¼g l-1, which satisfied the World Health Organization (WHO) provisional guideline limit of 1.0 Î¼g l-1 for MC-LR in drinking water.\n\nSecuring SSL-VPN with LR-AKE to access personal health record.\n\nPubMed\n\nEizen, Kimura; Masato, Saito; Kazukuni, Kobara; Yoshihito, Nakato; Takuji, Kuroda; Ken, Ishihara\n\n2013-01-01\n\nUsing SSL-VPN requires special considerations for well-known issues such as attackers exploiting web browser vulnerabilities and phishing sites using man-in-the-middle attacks. We used leakage-resilient authenticated key exchange (LR-AKE) to develop a comprehensive solution to SSL-VPN issues. Our results show that the LR-AKE should contribute to building a robust infrastructure for personal health records.\n\nImpairment of endoplasmic reticulum is involved in Î²-cell dysfunction induced by microcystin-LR.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhao, Yanyan; Cao, Qing; He, Yaojia; Xue, Qingju; Xie, Liqiang; Yan, Yunjun\n\n2017-04-01\n\nMicrocystins (MCs) widely distributed in freshwaters have posed a significant risk to human health. Previous studies have demonstrated that exposure to MC-LR impairs pancreatic islet function, however, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. In the present study, we explored the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) impairment in Î²-cell dysfunction caused by MC-LR. The result showed that MC-LR modified ER morphology evidenced by increased ER amount and size at low doses (15, 30 or 60Â Î¼M) and vacuolar and dilated ER ultrastructure at high doses (100 or 200Â Î¼M). Also, insulin content showed increased at 15 or 30Â Î¼M but declined at 60, 100, or 200Â Î¼M, which was highly accordant with ER morphological alteration. Transcriptomic analysis identified a number of factors and several pathways associated with ER protein processing, ER stress, apoptosis, and diabetes mellitus in the cells treated with MC-LR compared with non-treated cells. Furthermore, MC-LR-induced ER stress significantly promoted the expression of PERK/eIF2Î± and their downstream targets (ATF4, CHOP, and Gadd34), which indicates that PERK-eIF2Î±-ATF4 pathway is involved in MC-LR-induced insulin deficiency. These results suggest that ER impairment is an important contributor to MC-LR-caused Î²-cell failure and provide a new insight into the association between MCs contamination and the occurrence of human diseases.

Limited information was available on endocrine-disrupting effects of MC-LR on the reproduction system in fish. In the present study, zebrafish hatchlings (5 d post-fertilization) were exposed to 0, 0.3, 3 and 30Î¼g/L MC-LR for 90 d until they reached sexual maturity. Male zebrafish were selected, and changes in growth and developmental parameters, testicular histological structure as well as the levels of gonadal steroid hormones were studied along with the related-gene transcriptional responses in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG-axis). The results, for the first time, show a life cycle exposure to MC-LR causes growth inhibition, testicular damage and delayed sperm maturation. A significant decrease in T/E2 ratio indicated that MC-LR disrupted sex steroid hormones balance. The changes in transcriptional responses of HPG-axis related genes revealed that MC-LR promoted the conversion of T to E2 in circulating blood. It was also noted that vtg1 mRNA expression in the liver was up-regulated, which implied that MC-LR could induce estrogenic-like effects at environmentally relevant concentrations and long-term exposure. Our findings indicated that a life cycle exposure to MC-LR causes endocrine disruption with organic and functional damage of the testis, which might compromise the quality of life for the survivors and pose a potent threat on fish reproduction and thus population dynamics in MCs-contaminated aquatic environments.

Studies performed in rat Sertoli cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells have demonstrated typical apoptosis after MC-LR exposure. However, little is known on how to protect against the reproductive toxicity induced by MC-LR. The present study aimed to explore the possible molecular mechanism underlying the anti-apoptosis and protective effects of resveratrol (RES) on the co-culture of Sertoliâ»germ cells and rat testes. The results demonstrated that MC-LR treatment inhibited the proliferation of Sertoliâ»germ cells and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and Bcl-2 were inhibited, while p53 and Ku70 acetylation, Bax expression, and cleaved caspase-3 were upregulated by MC-LR. However, RES pretreatment ameliorated MC-LR-induced apoptosis and SIRT1 inhibition, and downregulated the MC-LR-induced increase in p53 and Ku70 acetylation, Bax expression, and caspase-3 activation. In addition, RES reversed the MC-LR-mediated reduction in Ku70 binding to Bax. The present study indicated that the administration of RES could ameliorate MC-LR-induced Sertoliâ»germ cell apoptosis and protect against reproductive toxicity in rats by stimulating the SIRT1/p53 pathway, suppressing p53 and Ku70 acetylation and enhancing the binding of Ku70 to Bax.\n\n78 FR 25487 - Final License Renewal Interim Staff Guidance LR-ISG-2012-01: Wall Thinning Due to Erosion Mechanisms\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2013-05-01\n\n....''

WRKY transcription factors play important roles in plant immune responses. However, limited information is available about the WRKY gene family in lily plants. In this study, 23 LrWRKY genes with complete WRKY domains were identified from the Botrytis-resistant species Lilium regale. The putative WRKY genes were divided into seven subgroups (Group I, IIa-e, and III) according to their structural features. Sequence alignment revealed that LrWRKY proteins have a highly conserved WRKYGQK domain and a variant, the WRKYGKK domain, and these proteins generally contained similar motif compositions throughout the same subgroup. Functional annotation predicted they might be involved in biological processes related to abiotic and biotic stresses. A qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that expression of six LrWRKY genes in L. regale or the susceptible Asian hybrid 'Yale' was induced by B. cinerea infection. Among these genes, LrWRKY4, LrWRKY8 and LrWRKY10 were expressed at a higher level in L. regale than 'Yale', while the expression of LrWRKY6 and LrWRKY12 was lower in L. regale. Furthermore, LrWRKY4 and LrWRKY12 genes, which also respond to salicylic acid (SA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatments, were isolated from L. regale. Subcellular localization analysis determined that they were targeted to the nucleus. Constitutive expression of LrWRKY4 and LrWRKY12 in Arabidopsis resulted in plants that were more resistant to B. cinerea than wild-type plants. This resistance was coupled with the transcriptional changes of SA and JA-responsive genes. Overall, our study provides valuable information about the structural and functional characterization of LrWRKY genes that will not only deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the defense of lily against B. cinerea but also offer potential targets for cultivar improvement via biotechnology.

However, research involving peptides from organisms belonging to the order Zoanthidea has received very little attention, contrasting to the numerous studies of the order Actiniaria, from which hundreds of toxic peptides and proteins have been reported. In this work, we performed a mass spectrometry analysis of a low molecular weight (LMW) fraction previously reported as lethal to mice. The low molecular weight (LMW) fraction was obtained by gel filtration of a Zoanthus sociatus (order Zoanthidea) crude extract with a Sephadex G-50, and then analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) in positive ion reflector mode from m/z 700 to m/z 4000. Afterwards, some of the most intense and representative MS ions were fragmented by MS/MS with no significant results obtained by Protein Pilot protein identification software and the Mascot algorithm search. However, microcystin masses were detected by mass-matching against libraries of non-ribosomal peptide database (NORINE). Subsequent reversed-phase C18 HPLC (in isocratic elution mode) and mass spectrometry analyses corroborated the presence of the cyanotoxin Microcystin-LR (MC-LR). To the best of our knowledge, this finding constitutes the first report of MC-LR in Z. sociatus, and one of the few evidences of such cyanotoxin in cnidarians. PMID:28257074\n\nA new leaf rust resistance gene Lr79 mapped in chromosome 3BL from the durum wheat landrace Aus26582.\n\nPubMed\n\nQureshi, Naeela; Bariana, Harbans; Kumran, Vikas Venu; Muruga, Sivasamy; Forrest, Kerrie L; Hayden, Mathew J; Bansal, Urmil\n\n2018-05-01\n\nA new leaf rust resistance gene Lr79 has been mapped in the long arm of chromosome 3B and a linked marker was identified for marker-assisted selection. Aus26582, a durum wheat landrace from the A. E. Watkins Collection, showed seedling resistance against durum-specific and common wheat-specific Puccinia triticina (Pt) pathotypes. Genetic analysis using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from a cross between Aus26582 and the susceptible parent Bansi with Australian Pt pathotype showed digenic inheritance and the underlying loci were temporarily named LrAW2 and LrAW3. LrAW2 was located in chromosome 6BS and this study focused on characterisation of LrAW3 using RILs lacking LrAW2. LrAW3 was incorporated into the DArTseq map of Aus26582/Bansi and was located in chromosome 3BL. Markers linked with LrAW3 were developed from the chromosome survey sequence contig 3B_10474240 in which closely-linked DArTseq markers 1128708 and 3948563 were located. Although bulk segregant analysis (BSA) with the 90Â K Infinium array identified 51 SNPs associated with LrAW3, only one SNP-derived KASP marker mapped close to the locus. Deletion bin mapping of LrAW3-linked markers located LrAW3 between bins 3BL11-0.85-0.90 and 3BL7-0.63. Since no other all stage leaf rust resistance gene is located in chromosome 3BL, LrAW3 represented a new locus and was designated Lr79. Marker sun786 mapped 1.8Â cM distal to Lr79 and Aus26582 was null for this locus. However, the marker can be reliably scored as it also amplifies a monomorphic fragment that serves as an internal control to differentiate the null status of Aus26582 from reaction failure. This marker was validated among a set of durum and common wheat cultivars and was shown to be useful for marker-assisted selection of Lr79 at both ploidy levels.\n\nMicrocystin-LR-induced phytotoxicity in rice crown root is associated with the cross-talk between auxin and nitric oxide.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Jian; Zhang, Hai-Qiang; Hu, Liang-Bin; Shi, Zhi-Qi\n\n2013-09-01\n\nIrrigation with cyanobacterial-blooming water containing microcystin-LR (MC-LR) poses threat to the growth of agricultural plants. Large amounts of rice (Oryza sativa) field in the middle part of China has been irrigating with cyanobacterial-blooming water. Nevertheless, the mechanism of MC-LR-induced phytotoxicity in the root of monocot rice remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that MC-LR stress significantly inhibits the growth of rice root by impacting the morphogenesis rice crown root. MC-LR treatment results in the decrease in IAA (indole-3-acetic acid) concentration as well as the expression of CRL1 and WOX11 in rice roots. The application of NAA (1-naphthylacetic acid), an IAA homologue, is able to attenuate the inhibitory effect of MC-LR on rice root development. MC-LR treatment significantly inhibits OsNia1-dependent NO generation in rice roots. The application of NO donor SNP (sodium nitroprusside) is able to partially reverse the inhibitory effects of MC-LR on the growth of rice root and the expression of CRL1 and WOX11 by enhancing endogenous NO level in rice roots. The application of NO scavenger cPTIO [2-(4-carboxy-2-phenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylinidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide] eliminates the effects of SNP. Treatment with NAA stimulates the generation of endogenous NO in MC-LR-treated rice roots. Treatment with NO scavenger cPTIO abolishes the ameliorated effect of NAA on MC-LR-induced growth inhibition of rice root. Treatment with SNP enhanced IAA concentration in MC-LR-treated rice roots. Altogether, our data suggest that NO acts both downstream and upstream of auxin in regulating rice root morphogenesis under MC-LR stress. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

To document the effects of long-term, low-dose MC-LR exposure on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in mice with healthy and diseased livers. Male CD1 mice (N = 20/group) were exposed to 1.0 Î¼g/L of MC-LR in drinking water; 1.0 Î¼g/L MC-LR plus 300 mg/L of the hepatotoxin thioacetamide (MC-LR/TAA); or 300 mg/L TAA alone for 28 weeks. Liver biochemistry and histology were documented at the end of the study period. In addition, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), were exposed in vitro to MC-LR (0.1-10,000 Î¼g/L) and monitored for changes in cell metabolism, proliferation and activation. Liver biochemistry and histology were essentially normal in MC-LR alone exposed mice. MC-LR/TAA and TAA alone exposed mice had significant hepatic inflammation and fibrosis but the extent of the changes were similar in the two groups. In vitro, MC-LR had no effect on HSC metabolism, proliferation or activation. Long-term, low-dose exposure to MC-LR is unlikely to lead to chronic liver disease in the setting of a normal liver or exacerbate existing liver disease in the setting of ongoing hepatitis.\n\nCombined toxicity of microcystin-LR and copper on lettuce (LactucaÂ sativa L.).\n\nPubMed\n\nCao, Qing; Steinman, Alan D; Wan, Xiang; Xie, Liqiang\n\n2018-05-10\n\nMicrocystins and copper commonly co-exist in the natural environment, but their combined toxicity remains unclear, especially in terrestrial plants. The present study investigated the toxicity effects of microcystin-LR (0, 5, 50, 500, 1000â¯Î¼gâ¯L -1 ) and copper (0, 50, 500, 1000, 2000â¯Î¼gâ¯L -1 ), both individually and in mixture, on the germination, growth and oxidative response of lettuce. The bioaccumulation of microcystin-LR and copper was also evaluated. Results showed that the decrease in lettuce germination induced by copper alone was not significantly different from that induced by the mixture, and the combined toxicity assessment showed a simple additive effect. Lettuce growth was not significantly reduced by microcystin-LR alone, whereas it was significantly reduced by copper alone and the mixture when copper concentration was higher than 500â¯Î¼gâ¯L -1 . High concentrations of microcystin-LR (1000â¯Î¼gâ¯L -1 ) and copper (â¥50â¯Î¼gâ¯L -1 ),as well as their mixture (â¥50Â +Â 500Â Î¼gÂ L -1 ), induced oxidative stress in lettuce. A synergistic effect on the growth and antioxidative system of lettuce was observed when exposed to low concentrations of the mixture (â¤50Â +Â 500Â Î¼gÂ L -1 ), whereas an antagonistic effect was observed at high concentrations (â¥1000Â +Â 2000Â Î¼gÂ L -1 ). Moreover, the interaction of microcystin-LR and copper can increase their accumulation in lettuce. Our results suggest that the toxicity effects of microcystin-LR and copper are exacerbated when they co-exist in the natural environment at low concentrations, which not only negatively affects plant growth but also poses a potential risk to human health via the food chain.

They have been simultaneously detected in aquatic systems, but their combined ecotoxicological effects to aquatic organisms, especially microalgae, is unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of these cyanotoxins individually and as a binary mixture on the growth rate of the freshwater algae Chlorella vulgaris. Using the MIXTOX tool, the reference model concentration addition (CA) was selected to evaluate the combined effects of MC-LR and CYN on the growth of the freshwater green algae due to its conservative prediction of mixture effect for putative similar or dissimilar acting chemicals. Deviations from the CA model such as synergism/antagonism, dose-ratio and dose-level dependency were also assessed. In single exposures, our results demonstrated that MC-LR and CYN had different impacts on the growth rates of C. vulgaris at the highest tested concentrations, being CYN the most toxic. In the mixture exposure trial, MC-LR and CYN showed a synergistic deviation from the conceptual model CA as the best descriptive model. MC-LR individually was not toxic even at high concentrations (37Â mgÂ L(-1)); however, the presence of MC-LR at much lower concentrations (0.4-16.7Â mgÂ L(-1)) increased the CYN toxicity. From these results, the combined exposure of MC-LR and CYN should be considered for risk assessment of mixtures as the toxicity may be underestimated when looking only at the single cyanotoxins and not their combination. This study also represents an important step to understand the interactions among MC-LR and CYN detected previously in aquatic systems.\n\nFunctional analysis of a pathogenesis-related thaumatin-like protein gene TaLr35PR5 from wheat induced by leaf rust fungus.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Jiarui; Wang, Fei; Liang, Fang; Zhang, Yanjun; Ma, Lisong; Wang, Haiyan; Liu, Daqun\n\n2018-05-04\n\nPlants have evolved multifaceted defence mechanisms to resist pathogen infection. Production of the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins in response to pathogen attack has been implicated in plant disease resistance specialized in systemic-acquired resistance (SAR). Our earlier studies have reported that a full length TaLr35PR5 gene, encoding a protein exhibiting amino acid and structural similarity to a sweet protein thaumatin, was isolated from wheat near-isogenic line TcLr35. The present study aims to understand the function of TaLr35PR5 gene in Lr35-mediated adult resistance to Puccinia triticina. We determined that the TaLr35PR5 protein contained a functional secretion peptide by utilizing the yeast signal sequence trap system. Using a heterologous expression assay on onion epidermal cells we found that TaLr35PR5 protein was secreted into the apoplast of onion cell. Expression of TaLr35PR5 was significantly reduced in BSMV-induced gene silenced wheat plants, and pathology test on these silenced plants revealed that Lr35-mediated resistance phenotype was obviously altered, indicating that Lr35-mediated resistance was compromised. All these findings strongly suggest that TaLr35PR5 is involved in Lr35-mediated adult wheat defense in response to leaf rust attack.\n\nProspective evaluation of IOTA logistic regression models LR1 and LR2 in comparison with subjective pattern recognition for diagnosis of ovarian cancer in an outpatient setting.\n\nPubMed\n\nNunes, N; Ambler, G; Foo, X; Widschwendter, M; Jurkovic, D\n\n2018-06-01\n\nTo determine whether International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) logistic regression models LR1 and LR2 developed for the preoperative diagnosis of ovarian cancer could also be used to differentiate between benign and malignant adnexal tumors in the population of women attending gynecology outpatient clinics. This was a single-center prospective observational study of consecutive women attending our gynecological diagnostic outpatient unit, recruited between May 2009 and January 2012. All the women were first examined by a Level-II ultrasound operator. In those diagnosed with adnexal tumors, the IOTA-LR1/2 protocol was used to evaluate the masses. The LR1 and LR2 models were then used to assess the risk of malignancy. Subsequently, the women were also examined by a Level-III examiner, who used pattern recognition to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. Women with an ultrasound diagnosis of malignancy were offered surgery, while asymptomatic women with presumed benign lesions were offered conservative management with a minimum follow-up of 12âmonths. The initial diagnosis was compared with two reference standards: histological findings and/or a comparative assessment of tumor morphology on follow-up ultrasound scans. All women for whom the tumor classification on follow-up changed from benign to malignant were offered surgery. In the final analysis, 489 women who had either or both of the reference standards were included. Their mean age was 50âyears (range, 16-91âyears) and 45% were postmenopausal. Of the included women, 342/489 (69.9%) had surgery and 147/489 (30.1%) were managed conservatively. The malignancy rate was 137/489 (28.0%). Overall, sensitivities of LR1 and LR2 for the diagnosis of malignancy were 97.1% (95% CI, 92.7-99.2%) and 94.9% (95% CI, 89.8-97.9%) and specificities were 77.3% (95% CI, 72.5-81.5%) and 76.7% (95% CI, 71.9-81.0%), respectively (Pâ>â0.05). In comparison with pattern recognition (sensitivity 94.2% (95% CI, 88\n\nDegradation of [Dha7]MC-LR by a Microcystin Degrading Bacterium Isolated from Lake Rotoiti, New Zealand\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSomdee, Theerasak; Ruck, John; Lys, Isabelle; Allison, Margaret; Page, Rachel\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFor the first time a microcystin-degrading bacterium (NV-3 isolate) has been isolated and characterized from a NZ lake. Cyanobacterial blooms in New Zealand (NZ) waters contain microcystin (MC) hepatotoxins at concentrations which are a risk to animal and human health. Degradation of MCs by naturally occurring bacteria is an attractive bioremediation option for removing MCs from drinking and recreational water sources. The NV-3 isolate was identified by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and found to have 100% nucleotide sequence homology with the Sphingomonas MC-degrading bacterial strain MD-1 from Japan. The NV-3 isolate (concentration of 1.0 Ã 108âCFU/mL) at 30Â°C degraded a mixture of [Dha7]MC-LR and MC-LR (concentration 25âÎ¼g/mL) at a maximum rate of 8.33âÎ¼g/mL/day. The intermediate by-products of [Dha7]MC-LR degradation were detected and similar to MC-LR degradation by-products. The presence of three genes (mlrA, mlrB, and mlrC), that encode three enzymes involved in the degradation of MC-LR, were identified in the NV-3 isolate. This study confirmed that degradation of [Dha7]MC-LR by the Sphingomonas isolate NV-3 occurred by a similar mechanism previously described for MC-LR by Sphingomonas strain MJ-PV (ACM-3962). This has important implications for potential bioremediation of toxic blooms containing a variety of MCs in NZ waters.

This study aimed to understand the toxic effects and mechanism of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) on the seedling growth and physiological responses of Iris pseudacorus L. (calamus). After a one-month exposure experiment, the growth and development of the calamus leaves were significantly inhibited, and this inhibitory effect was verified to be concentration dependent. Furthermore, the cell membrane system was damaged, and the photosynthesis was also adversely affected by MC-LR. The relative conductivity of the leaves increased from 10.96% to 97.51%, and the total chlorophyll content decreased from 0.89â¯mg/g to 0.09â¯mg/g. Notably, the behavior of the roots in the presence of MC-LR was different from that of the leaves. The seedlings needed to absorb more nutrients to maintain the normal growth at low-toxin concentrations, but the high concentration of (over 250â¯Î¼g/L) MC-LR exceeded the tolerance of plants and inhibited the growth of roots. In addition, MC-LR led to an excessive accumulation of H 2 O 2 , and the seedlings enhanced the activities of catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase to resist oxidative stress. The presence of MC-LR also affected the capacity of the plants to absorb nitrogen and phosphorus. The removal efficiency of NO 3 - -N, the main source of nitrogen, was 63.53% in the presence of 100â¯Î¼g/L MC-LR. As a result, the pH increased, and the growth of plants was indirectly inhibited. Therefore, the presence of MC-LR could affect the purification efficiency of calamus in eutrophic water. This study provides theoretical support for the selection of plants in the eutrophic water.

Here, we analyse the function of the highly conserved RxLR24 effector of Phytophthora brassicae. RxLR24 was expressed early in the interaction with Arabidopsis plants and ectopic expression in the host enhanced leaf colonization and zoosporangia formation. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments followed by mass spectrometry identified different members of the RABA GTPase family as putative RxLR24 targets. Physical interaction of RxLR24 or its homologue from the potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans with different RABA GTPases of Arabidopsis or potato, respectively, was confirmed by reciprocal Co-IP. In line with the function of RABA GTPases in vesicular secretion, RxLR24 co-localized with RABA1a to vesicles and the plasma membrane. The effect of RxLR24 on the secretory process was analysed with fusion constructs of secreted antimicrobial proteins with a pH-sensitive GFP tag. PATHOGENESIS RELATED PROTEIN 1 (PR-1) and DEFENSIN (PDF1.2) were efficiently exported in control tissue, whereas in the presence of RxLR24 they both accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. Together our results imply a virulence function of RxLR24 effectors as inhibitors of RABA GTPase-mediated vesicular secretion of antimicrobial PR-1, PDF1.2 and possibly other defence-related compounds.

T.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTwo key events, namely adhesion and invasion, are pivotal to the occurrence of metastasis. Importantly, the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) has been implicated in enhancing these two events thus facilitating cancer progression. In the current study, the role of LRP/LR in the adhesion and invasion of liver cancer (HUH-7) and leukaemia (K562) cells was investigated. Flow cytometry revealed that the HUH-7 cells displayed significantly higher cell surface LRP/LR levels compared to the poorly-invasive breast cancer (MCF-7) control cells, whilst the K562 cells displayed significantly lower cell surface LRP/LR levels in comparison to the MCF-7 control cells. However, Western blotting and densitometric analysis revealed that all three tumorigenic cell lines did not differ significantly with regards to total LRP/LR levels. Furthermore, treatment of liver cancer cells with anti-LRP/LR specific antibody IgG1-iS18 (0.2 mg/ml) significantly reduced the adhesive potential of cells to laminin-1 and the invasive potential of cells through the ECM-like Matrigel, whilst leukaemia cells showed no significant differences in both instances. Additionally, Pearson's correlation coefficients suggested direct proportionality between cell surface LRP/LR levels and the adhesive and invasive potential of liver cancer and leukaemia cells. These findings suggest the potential use of anti-LRP/LR "
