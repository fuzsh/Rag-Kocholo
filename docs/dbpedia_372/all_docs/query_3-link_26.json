        "text": "Tool\n\nLand Cover Atlas\n\nThis online data viewer provides user-friendly access to coastal land cover and land cover change information. The tool summarizes general change trends (such as forest losses or new development), without the need for GIS software, and provides tables, maps, and reports to enhance communication and decision-making.\n\nData\n\nC-CAP Regional Land Cover and Change\n\nProduced at a 30-meter resolution for the coastal areas of the contiguous U.S. These data are updated every five years from multiple dates of remotely sensed Landsat imagery and ancillary information. Most areas have 20 years of data, with some areas having up to 40 years. The data are appropriate for use down to the typical county level, but only as a screening-level indicator of conditions over smaller geographies.\n\nData\n\nC-CAP Derived Land Cover – BETA\n\nProduced through entirely automated methods at 10- and 30-meter resolutions, for select project areas within the contiguous U.S. These data provide a more spatially detailed land cover than that seen in our regional product line, but not as detailed as our high-resolution products. They have fewer land-cover categories and are not refined to the same quality level or accuracy as the other operational data sets.\n\nData\n\nC-CAP High-Resolution Land Cover and Change\n\nProduced at a 1- to 2.4-meter resolution for select project areas within the contiguous U.S., Hawaii, and U.S. territories in the Pacific and Caribbean, with additional areas being added as completed. Multiple dates of data are available in some locations. These data are applicable at the local level, and can support site-based management or planning decisions.\n\nData\n\nC-CAP Salt Marsh Habitat\n\nProduced at less than 1-meter resolution for select project areas. These products focus on more detailed categorization of marsh species and features. Current data holdings are limited to the states of Rhode Island and New Hampshire, but additional areas may be added if funding becomes available. These data can be used to evaluate specific marsh locations, as well as conditions across the area.\n\nData\n\nTidal Marsh Resilience to Sea Level Rise\n\nRepresents the relative ranking of salt marsh resilience to impacts from sea level rise, and other compounding stressors, for tidal watersheds within the contiguous U.S. Produced using a combination of data and modeling methods at the 30-meter resolution. The data can be used to identify salt marsh areas most vulnerable, or adaptable, to sea level rise at the national, regional, or state levels.\n\nData\n\nSea Level Rise Wetland Impacts and Migration\n\nRepresents the possible future condition of coastal wetlands in the face of various sea level rise scenarios. Produced using both regional and high-resolution C-CAP land cover, as well as the best available lidar-derived elevations and local sea level information. This information can be used to estimate losses, changes, and potential migration areas of future wetlands in order to help direct conservation, restoration, and monitoring efforts.\n\nData\n\nC-CAP Wetland Potential Layer\n\nRepresents the likelihood of an area to be, or to have been, a wetland. Produced using a combination of data and modeling methods at a 30-meter resolution for the coastal areas of the contiguous U.S. The data have been used to help in the accuracy of mapping wetlands within our regional land cover products, but may also be useful in identifying areas of historic wetlands that could be a target for restoration activities.\n\nTool\n\nCoastal County Snapshots\n\nThis online tool provides managers and citizens with easy-to-understand charts and graphs that describe complex coastal data (including land cover) concerning issues of flooding and resilience. Land cover data provide information related to flood exposure and the context of past change trends in those areas.\n\nTool\n\nCoastal Flood Exposure Mapper\n\nThis online visualization tool supports communities that are assessing their risks and vulnerabilities to coastal flooding hazards. The tool creates a collection of user-defined maps that show the people, places, and natural resources exposed to coastal flooding. Land cover data provide important information related to infrastructure exposure and ecosystem protective services.\n\nTool\n\nSea Level Rise Viewer\n\nThis web-based mapping tool can be used to visualize community-level impacts from coastal flooding or sea level rise (up to 10 feet above average high tides). Land cover data provide the basis for the wetland loss and migration modeling within the tool.\n\nTraining – Online Guide\n\nHow to Use Land Cover Data as a Water Quality Indicator\n\nThis step-by-step guide describes how land cover data can be analyzed to assess several water quality indicators. Included with each step is a link to a web-based map that highlights the land cover information explored, as well as a link to a document that describes the data and analysis used to create those maps.\n\nStory from the Field\n\nCreating a Comprehensive Plan for Resilient Salt Marshes in New Hampshire\n\nSee how high-resolution, standardized salt marsh habitat mapping is driving comprehensive planning in the State of New Hampshire. The mapping is helping to determine where restoration, experimental science, land conservation, and land use planning can be most effective in protecting the salt marshes based on current condition, vulnerability, and adaptation potential.\n\nStory from the Field\n\nUsing the Land Cover Atlas to Protect Watershed Health from Overdevelopment\n\nSee how the Guam Coastal Management Program uses C-CAP data and the Land Cover Atlas to help mitigate impacts to watershed health and make recommendations related to specific permit requests.\n\nStory from the Field\n\nInspiring Citizens to Protect and Preserve Galveston Bay in Texas\n\nSee how land cover informs the production of the Galveston Bay Report Card and how that annual assessment of the health of Galveston Bay provides specific ways citizens can take specific actions in their backyards and how groups have volunteered to restore salt marshes in the watershed."
