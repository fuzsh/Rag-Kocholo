        "text": "The county register of deeds office can most appropriately be thought of as a library of local records. This office is a storage facility for a host of local documents. From land title transfers to birth, marriage, and death records, this office has a wealth of information about the local population. Although these are only a few of the documents recorded in this office, they remain some of the most widely requested by the general public.\n\nQuick Navigation\n\nCertificate of Real Estate Value\n\nExemption from Deed Transfers Fees\n\nGeneral List of Recordable Items\n\nReal Estate Sale and Transfer\n\nTransfer Data\n\nCertificate of Real Estate Value\n\nThe Certificate of Real Estate Value (PT 56) form must be filed with any deed or contract for deed.

Those documents include:\n\nTax deeds,\n\nChattel mortgages,\n\nBills of sale,\n\nConditional sale contracts,\n\nMortgages, and\n\nOther instruments authorized by law.\n\nNo register of deeds may accept any deed or contract for deed that is not accompanied by a certificate of value containing:\n\nThe name and address of the buyer and seller;\n\nThe legal description;\n\nThe actual consideration exchanged;\n\nThe relationship of the seller and buyer, if any; and\n\nThe terms of payment if other than payment in full at the time of sale.\n\nReal Estate Sale and Transfer\n\nOn a monthly basis, the register of deeds will forward real estate sale and transfer information electronically to the Property Tax Division. The process is completed through the real estate database. As sales or transfers occur the information can be added to the database and then at the end of every month a file with all of the information can be transferred electronically to the Property Tax Division.\n\nThe database also has internal reports available for the register of deeds to use. They include:\n\nIndividual Record Report\n\nWeekly Transfer Certificates\n\nMonthly Transfer Report\n\nTransfer Data\n\nAll of the following information is required electronically:\n\nSequence Number - this is the number of the real estate transfers as filed in the Register of Deeds office.
