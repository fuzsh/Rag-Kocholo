Most records are searchable and accessible through the internet from the Board of Trustees Land Document System (BTLDS). A mapping component of BTLDS also provides a graphical depiction of parcel locations.\n\nThese documents are stored in a climate-controlled vault. Access to the vault is limited to ensure protection of documents, as well as to allow staff to perform daily research duties. Therefore, the following procedures have been implemented to maintain a balance of document protection and public access:"
