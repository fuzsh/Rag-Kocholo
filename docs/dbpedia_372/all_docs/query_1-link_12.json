        "text": "Note: There's hardly a more lumpen musical-comedy than 'The Goldwyn Follies' (runner up), an outrageously expensive and fairly embarassing fiasco flop from producer Sam Goldwyn. To me, it's an endearing mess; a Technicolored train wreck of a movie, with forced comedy and hokum galore. I can't explain why, but I like it. The year's two great European art films, Leni Riefenstahl's 'Olympia' and Sergei Eisenstein's 'Alexander Nevsky' (both runners up) have to take a back seat to the best Hollywood fare on the enjoyment scale. Both are visually stunning, yet almost wholly dependent on big-screen viewing for watchability and impact. King Vidor's 'The Citadel' (runner up)--an UK/US MGM co-production--also needs the big screen to raise it from its humble dramatic mis-en-scene. It joins the long list of old A-rank Hollywood classics that have undeservedly slipped into the obscure margins of auteurist-driven movie history. John Ford's 'Four Men and a Prayer' (runners up) is pretty superficial among the director's films, and yet it is vigorously entertaining, and the chemistry among the male leads (Richard Greene, George Sanders, David Niven, C. Aubrey Smith) so good that it's a mystery why the film didn't spawn a sequel. French fatalistic poetic realism emerges full force in Jean Renoir's 'La bete humaine' and Marcel Carne's brooding 'Quai des brumes' (runner up). Laurel and Hardy's 'Block-Heads' has always seemed to me their funniest and best-paced film; in that judgment I constitute a minority among fans of \"the Boys.\" By all accounts, Fox's musical drama, 'Alexander's Ragtime Band' should be minor tin-pan alley fluff, and yet there's a certain earnestness and dark edge to it that makes it special of its type. 'Three Comrades,' with a script by F. Scott Fitzgerald, universalizes the tragedy emerging in Nazi Germany, then shifts into a superb melodrama with a heartbreaking performance by Margaret Sullavan. Hepburn and Grant score in two classic comedies, 'Bringing Up Baby' and the drawing room semi-screwballer, 'Holiday,' the latter a sort of run-through for Cukor's 'The Philadelphia Story'. Fox's 'In Old Chicago' (runner up) tried to duplicate the formula of MGM's 1936 smash hit, 'San Francisco', with a blend of historical costume drama, humor, musical interludes, romantic triangle, and spectacular disaster finale. Less popular and less famous, the Fox film nonetheless is the superior one; less staid, better paced and far more watchable today, with impressive Chicago fire special effects and a much more palatable songstress in Alice Faye.\n\n1939 (115) (Massive hit 'Gone with the Wind' released; apex of Hollywood's 'golden age)\n\nLa Regle du jeu (The Rules of the Game) (Jean Renoir)\n\nMr. Smith Goes to Washington (Frank Capra)\n\nStagecoach (John Ford)\n\nThe Women (George Cukor)\n\nDrums Along the Mohawk (John Ford)\n\nBachelor Mother (Garson Kanin)\n\nOnly Angels Have Wings (Howard Hawks)\n\nThe Wizard of Oz (Victor Fleming)\n\nThe Roaring Twenties (Raoul Walsh)\n\nThe Story of the Last Chrysanthemum (Kenji Mizoguchi)\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nThe Four Feathers (Zoltan Korda)\n\nNinotchka (Ernst Lubitsch)\n\nYoung Mr. Lincoln (John Ford)\n\nOf Mice and Men (Lewis Milestone)\n\nLove Affair (Leo McCarey)\n\nShchors (Alexander Dovzhenko)\n\nGunga Din (George Stevens)\n\nJitterbug Follies (Milt Gross)\n\nGoodbye, Mr. Chips (Sam Wood)\n\nThe Saint Strikes Back (John Farrow)\n\nMidnight (Mitchell Leisen)\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask (James Whale)\n\nThe Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex (Michael Curtiz)\n\nThe Hunchback of Notre Dame (William Dieterle)\n\nJesse James (Henry King)\n\nBeau Geste (William Wellman)\n\nThe Spy in Black (U-Boat 29) (Michael Powell)\n\nUnion Pacific (Cecil B.

It's not listed here, but in its defense 'Gone With the Wind' is a rattling good flick; possibly the best realization of a middlebrow literary epic. Having respectfully sat through its four hours a couple of times, though, the replay factor for me is now nil. 'Wuthering Heights', 'Stanley and Livingstone' and several other sporadically interesting but staid prestige classics also are missing here. The former dishonors a fine novel and the latter looks more disconcertingly artificial (too much back projection) than I once thought. MGM's 'Jitterbug Follies' (runner up) is probably the wildest and funniest short cartoon to date. No doubt Tex Avery and Bob Clampett learned a thing or two from it. Director Milt Gross was only allowed to make this and one other subversive cartoon featuring Count Screwloose and J.R. the Wonder Dog before MGM pulled the plug. Gross's lampooning of a \"Citizen's Fair Play Committee\" was probably seen by skittish studio honchos as a mockery of MGM's core white-bread patrons. I was on the fence about adding Fox's spit-and-polished disaster epic, 'The Rains Came' (runners up) as it is on the whole unmemorable, but there's something intriguing about such a bloated movie hinging all its drama on almost no plot and rather on the petty intrigues of a small group of isolated colonials. And the effects, when they come, are still the best ever.\n\n1940 (137)\n\nHis Girl Friday (Howard Hawks)\n\nThe Philadelphia Story (George Cukor)\n\nThe Letter (William Wyler)\n\nFantasia (Ben Sharpsteen, et. al.)\n\nRebecca (Alfred Hitchcock)\n\nAngels Over Broadway (Ben Hecht)\n\nContraband (Michael Powell)\n\nThe Stars Look Down (Carol Reed)\n\nForeign Correspondent (Alfred Hitchcock)\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath (John Ford)\n\nThe Shop Around the Corner (Ernst Lubitsch)\n\nNorthwest Passage (King Vidor)\n\nWaterloo Bridge (Mervyn LeRoy)\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nThe Bank Dick (Eddie Cline)\n\nThe Great McGinty (Preston Sturges)\n\nStrange Cargo (Frank Borzage)\n\nPinocchio (Hamilton Luske, Ben Sharpsteen)\n\nGaslight (Thorold Dickinson)\n\nThe Long Voyage Home (John Ford)\n\nThe Thief of Bagdad (Ludwig Berger, Tim Whelan)\n\nThe Sea Hawk (Michael Curtiz)\n\nThe Mark of Zorro (Rouben Mamoulian)\n\nNight Train to Munich (Carol Reed)\n\nMy Little Chickadee (Eddie Cline)\n\nRemember the Night (Mitchell Leisen)\n\nChristmas in July (Preston Sturges)\n\nDance, Girl, Dance (Dorothy Arzner)\n\nThe Blue Bird (Walter Lang)\n\nKitty Foyle (Sam Wood)\n\nThe Great Dictator (Charles Chaplin)\n\nThey Drive By Night (Raoul Walsh)\n\nAbe Lincoln in Illinois (John Cromwell)\n\nLillian Russell (Irving Cummings)\n\nCity for Conquest (Anatole Litvak)\n\nBroadway Melody of 1940 (Eleanor Powell dance sequences) (Norman Taurog)\n\nStranger on the Third Floor (Boris Ingster)\n\nThe House of the Seven Gables (Joe May)\n\nWild Oysters (Charles Bowers)\n\nLondon Can Take It (Humphrey Jennings)\n\nSanta Fe Trail (Michael Curtiz)\n\nThe Son of Monte Cristo (Rowland V.

I recall seeing this Revolutionary War period flick in a third-grade history class, which I think would put it around 1970 or 1971 (so long ago!). I saw the movie a few years later and still thought it was OK. Most critics don't.

Sonja Henie skates, Glenn Miller's orchestra plays, and the incomparable Nicholas Brothers perform their eyepopping acrobatic dancing. 'Lady Be Good' (runner up) is a prime example of the critical dilemma regarding most MGM musicals: great dance sequences stuck inside plodding, banal narratives. In this case, it's Eleanor Powell's fancy stepping through the glitzy 'Fascinatin' Rhythm\" sequence. 'Pimpernel Smith' (runner up) is a tour-de-force for English actor-director Leslie Howard, updating his earlier 1934 'Scarlet Pimpernel' success by placing his unassuming English spy hero into Nazi Germany. It gets off to a wobbly start, but becomes deliciously witty and exciting, capped by a mysterious, inspiring ending. There are no similar compensations weighty enough to offset the idealized hokum of Howard Hawks' biopic flagwaver, 'Sergeant York' (not listed). Not a bad film, per se, but one that leaves a sour taste: York's ignorance seems to be heralded as an ideal American trait; not coincidentally, one that always gets us into stupid wars.\n\n1942 (114)\n\nListen to Britain (Humphrey Jennings)\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons (Orson Welles)\n\nCasablanca (Michael Curtiz)\n\nThe Man Who Came to Dinner (William Keighley)\n\nIn Which We Serve (Noel Coward, David Lean)\n\nThe Dover Boys at Pimento University or The Rivals of\n\nRoquefort Hall (Chuck Jones)\n\nNoi Vivi (We the Living) (Goffredo Alessandrini)\n\nWoman of the Year (George Stevens)\n\nSullivan's Travels (Preston Sturges)\n\nRoxie Hart (William Wellman)\n\nRandom Harvest (Mervyn LeRoy)\n\nNative Land (Paul Strand, Leo Hurwitz)\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nThe Palm Beach Story (Preston Sturges)\n\nTo Be or Not to Be (Ernst Lubitsch)\n\nThe Talk of the Town (George Stevens)\n\nOne of Our Aircraft is Missing (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger)\n\nThe Moon and Sixpence (Albert Lewin)\n\nMrs. Miniver (William Wyler)\n\nYankee Doodle Dandy (Michael Curtiz)\n\nBambi (David Hand)\n\nRazgrom nemetskikh voysk pod Moskvoy (Defeat of the German Armies Near Moscow/Moscow Strikes Back) (Leonid Varlamov, Ilya Kopalin)\n\nJourney Into Fear (Norman Foster)\n\nAniki-Bobo (Manoel de Oliveira)\n\nThe Glass Key (Stuart Heisler)\n\nThe Black Swan (Henry King)\n\nTales of Manhattan (Julien Duvivier)\n\nFor Me and My Gal (Busby Berkeley)\n\nMy Sister Eileen (Alexander Hall)\n\nSaboteur (Alfred Hitchcock)\n\nThe Major and the Minor (Billy Wilder)\n\nAcross the Pacific (John Huston)\n\nThis Gun For Hire (Frank Tuttle)\n\nHold the Lion, Please (Chuck Jones)\n\nTarzan's New York Adventure (Richard Thorpe)\n\nI Married a Witch (Rene Clair)\n\nCharley's Aunt (Archie Mayo)\n\nThe First of the Few (Spitfire) (Leslie Howard)\n\nHoliday Inn (Mark Sandrich)\n\nHorton Hatches the Egg (Robert Clampett)\n\nJoan of Paris (Robert Stevenson)\n\nFor the record: The Male Animal (Elliot Nugent); King's Row (Sam Wood); My Favorite Blonde (Sidney Lanfield); The Night Has Eyes (Leslie Arliss); Now, Voyager (Irving Rapper); Les visiteurs du soir (Marcel Carne); Wake Island (John Farrow); Went the Day Well?

Orson Welles' 'The Magnificent Ambersons' topped this list until I saw Humphrey Jennings' overwhelming work of documentary art, 'Listen to Britain'--a non-narrated view of wartime England blending ambient sounds and masterfully selected images to evoke Brit pride without the usual pedantic bombast. The Welles film is a mutilated masterwork, the Jennings film is a fully realized one. The best picture winner 'Mrs. Miniver' (runner up) is essentially Hollywood artifice and wartime propaganda, yet works better than expected, offering deft storytelling and great chemistry between its stars. That much of it sounds silly on paper but works so well in execution is to director William Wyler's credit.

It's possibly Hollywood's only moment of pure visual abstraction, unrelated to the narrative or to movie-musical conventions. There are a million things I love in this whole kitschy fiasco, not to mention the unbridled enthusiasm and energy put into some horrific songs and choreography, as well as the first sequence, which is probably the longest unbroken tracking crane shot in movies up to its time. Because Berkeley was able to get his artistic vision largely unencumbered onto the screen -- no matter how looney it may be -- this film is his masterpiece. Two surprises this year are the darkly resonant German romance, 'Romanze in Moll,' which made Josef Goebbels bristle at its frank depiction of adultery (he had to knuckle under and let it pass to appease the popular taste and low morale of the battle-weary populace); and Fox's 'The Song of Bernadette,' a surprisingly balanced and steely depiction of the miracle of Lourdes, not saccharine in the way most '40s Hollywood religious pictures are. 'Victory Through Air Power' is the Disney studio's major contribution to the war effort and one of its best features ever; a long-unseen documentary that was completely vaulted until its DVD release in 2004. It uses extensive animation and expert presentations to propagandize very effectively for the expansion of an air-based offensive strategy. Another long-unseen animated work, 'Coal Black...' is likely to stay that way√ëwhich is too bad because it's the brassiest and most energetic cartoon to come out of Warner's 'Termite Terrace\" at its wartime artistic peak. Where most people see malicious racism in it, I see a good deal of charm. Another Clampett cartoon, 'An Itch in Time' (Robert Clampett) has a fleabitten male dog grinding his itchy ass across the ground and stopping suddenly to tell the audience, \"Hey, I'm starting to like this!\" A rare concession from the time to the joys of masturbatory friction. No Freudian segue intended: Delmer Daves' 'Destination Tokyo' (runner up) is probably the best submarine warfare movie made during WWII. By comparison, 'Crash Dive' (runner up) is a pretty standard submarine war actioner with lots of throwaway love stuff, but the Technicolor is great, the special-effects model work cool, and the entertainment value high. Jean Renoir's 'This Land is Mine' (runner up) is a problemmatic film that never escapes its Hollywood artifice, yet is very moving; seething with earnest anger and a palpable sense of both hope and helplessness about occupied France that must have reflected its expatriate director's own feelings. Fritz Lang's compelling 'Hangmen Also Die' (runner up) does pretty much the same thing for occupied Czechoslovakia--and has virtually the same problems in overcoming its artifice and narrative holes. Also angry, but considerably weirder, is the anti-Nazi propaganda drama, 'Hitler's Children' (runner up); perhaps not good, but something not forgotten once seen. Its tale suggesting the forced insemination of Aryan women was sensational stuff in its day; making it one of the year's biggest hits.\n\n1944 (105) ('Double Indemnity' on 'film noir' cusp)\n\nDouble Indemnity (Billy Wilder)\n\nArsenic and Old Lace (Frank Capra)\n\nThe Memphis Belle (William Wyler)\n\nTo Have and Have Not (Howard Hawks)\n\nTorment (Hets) (Alf Sjoberg)\n\nLaura (Otto Preminger)\n\nOn Approval (Clive Brook)\n\nThe Miracle of Morgan's Creek (Preston Sturges)\n\nCover Girl (Charles Vidor)\n\nThe Mask of Dimitrios (Jean Negulesco)\n\nThe Woman in the Window (Fritz Lang)\n\nLifeboat (Alfred Hitchcock)\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nMurder My Sweet (Edward Dmytryk)\n\nBrother Brat (Frank Tashlin)\n\nMeet Me in St. Louis (Vincente Minnelli)\n\nThis Happy Breed (David Lean)\n\nHenry V (Laurence Olivier)\n\nHail the Conquering Hero (Preston Sturges)\n\nThe Children Are Watching Us (Vittorio De Sica)\n\nIt Happened Tomorrow (Rene Clair)\n\nThe Seventh Cross (Fred Zinnemann)\n\nTick Tock Tuckered (Robert Clampett)\n\nDesert Victory (Roy Boulting)\n\nMaria Candelaria (Emilio Fernandez)\n\nAt Land (Maya Deren)\n\nThe Sullivans (Lloyd Bacon)\n\nJane Eyre (Robert Stevenson)\n\nThe White Cliffs of Dover (Clarence Brown)\n\nThe Pearl of Death (Roy William Neill)\n\nPhantom Lady (Robert Siodmak)\n\nMinistry of Fear (Fritz Lang)\n\nA Canterbury Tale (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger)\n\nSince You Went Away (John Cromwell)\n\nThirty Seconds Over Tokyo (Mervyn LeRoy)\n\nGoing My Way (Leo McCarey)\n\nBooby Traps (Robert Clampett)\n\nHell-Bent For Election (Chuck Jones)\n\nThe Three Caballeros (Norman Ferguson)\n\nThe Adventures of Mark Twain (Irving Rapper)\n\nBuffalo Bill (William Wellman)\n\nFor the record: A Bell for Adano (Henry King); The Scarlet Claw (Roy William Neill); Gaslight (George Cukor); Tomorrow the World (Leslie Fenton); A Wing and a Prayer (Henry Hathaway); The Keys of the Kingdom (John M.

McCarey makes the sugar go down easy though, thanks to his penchant for faux cynicism and Irish good spirits and for Barry Fitzgerald's skills at balancing the irascible, slightly seedy and the charming.

As much as I admire its big-scaled historical settings and pseudo-artistic pretensions, it seems to me like nothing more than a garish soaper. Duty binds me to list it. Then there's Eisenstein's \"Ivan the Terrible,\" an unmatched visual tour de force ruined by laughable eye-rolling acting that apologists refer to as \"operatic.\" Still, its epic visual palette is something ravishing to see.

All those young GI couples had a voracious appetite for flicks. The first year after the war is the most profitable in Hollywood history, logging the highest film attendance ever: an incredible 100 million tickets sold a week. IMO, it's the best year ever in terms of the number of great classics released.) As an example of a superior French art film, Jean Cocteau's 'Beauty and the Beast' fills the gaps of emotion, mystery and profundity that I felt lacking in the previous year's French prestige art picture 'Les enfants du paradis.' After talking to people and reading various film journals on the internet, it appears that 'The Best Years of Our Lives' remains one of the least-seen classics by younger film buffs. That's too bad, because it's a great American film, but it's also one that really needs a movie theater screen (I saw it at the Vogue long ago). Gregg Toland's sharp, deep-focus camerawork contributes greatly to its epic feel. It's a self important picture, but it's also earnest, bittersweet, sincere and very much what postwar audiences needed to help them salve wounds, make up for lost time, and move forward to build the industrial behemoth of the '50s. 'The Seventh Veil' from England and 'Humoresque' from Hollywood are two dark, psychological soapers with classical-music backdrops, both extremely well done to make for guilt-free pleasure.\n\n1947 (92)\n\nBlack Narcissus (Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger)\n\nOut of the Past (Jacques Tourneur)\n\nLe Diable au corps (Devil in the Flesh) (Claude Autant-Lara)\n\nMonsieur Verdoux (Charles Chaplin)\n\nThe Record of a Tenement Gentleman (Yasujiro Ozu)\n\nCrossfire (Edward Dmytryk)\n\nDead Reckoning (John Cromwell)\n\nMonsieur Vincent (Maurice Cloche)\n\nThe Ghost and Mrs. Muir (Joseph L.

Among its A-/B+ ones, 'Angel and the Badman' with John Wayne and Gail Russell is undoubtedly the most intelligent and enjoyable. 'Monsieur Verdoux' and 'Monsieur Vincent' regrettably have titles so similar as to be confusing, yet both are exceptional and very different films. The first is Chaplin's famous black comedy about a widow murderer; the second is one of the best religious movies ever made, a serious but unsentimental French-made biopic about a few years in the life of St. Vincent De Paul. 'The Hucksters' (runner up) is a fun dig at the advertising game, though as a satire it suffers under the timid conventions of its studio, MGM. Nonetheless, it has Sydney Greenstreet at his most despicable, hocking a loogie to the disgust of all present to prove an advertising point.

'Fabiola' ('I saw it, but...) was a long-time wish-list item that disappointed on recent viewing, though not because of its impressive art direction, convincing brutality and colisseum atrocities. The film's labyrithine, trudgingly slow plot intrigues are self defeating and wearying. Joseph Mankiewicz's cleverly structured adultery tale, 'A Letter to Three Wives,' is strangely hard to engage--maybe too smart for its own good--yet fascinating with its overly intelligent dialogue that plays like practice for his upcoming 'All About Eve'. Olivia De Havilland's revelatory acting in the latter half of 'The Heiress', in my opinion, marks the beginning of 'modern', understated film performance styles. You have to give Hollywood some credit as a force for good in 1949, releasing at least three major studio films attacking racial prejudice in the USA: 'Pinky,' 'Intruder in the Dust' and 'Home of the Brave' (all runners up). The first, closer to a traditional soaper like 'Imitation of Life,' is the least interesting, but the latter two, IMO, are better than 1962's feted 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' All three films feature possibly the first truly dignified, three-dimensional roles for African-Americans in Hollywood film: for Ethel Waters, Juano Hernandez and James Edwards. Baseball and Hollywood, America's favorite pastimes, were ahead of the rest of society.\n\n1950 (97) (Kurosawa's Rashomon introduces Japanese cinema to West; Eastmancolor introduced)\n\nAll About Eve (Joseph L.

Roberto Rossellini's 'Flowers of St. Francis' (runner up) threatens to be one of those earthy, austere foreign dramas that everyone dreads, but eventually wins you over by rounding out its religious characters with humor and moments of slice-of-life honesty--leading to one of the most beautiful endings in all of cinema.

Yet that admiration is substantial, the film subtly and mercilessly satirizes the nationalistic, opportunistic and hypocritical German Right-wing mindset that led to the disasters of WWs I and II. And it's very frank in the process about its protagonist's mercenary sexuality. Similarly, honesty forces me to admit fidgetyness while sitting through Yasujiro Ozu's meticulous family portrait, 'Early Summer' (runner up), even though it may be the year's most sublime film. Billy Wilder's 'Ace in the Hole' (aka, 'The Big Carnival')--long inexplicably MIA (though I had seen it on late-night TV ages ago)--finally comes to home video (DVD). Based on the Floyd Collins cave tragedy of the '20s, it is one of the cinema's most acid-laced attacks on cynical journalism, and one of the handful of Hollywood movies ('Patterns,' 'A Face in the Crowd,' 'A King in New York', etc.) made during the capitalistic go-go '50s that questioned public tastes and the ethos of the almighty dollar. Appropriately, its desert setting mirrors the reporter's aimlessless moral compass and arid bankruptcy of the soul. Overreliance on studio back projection swamps John Huston's 'The African Queen' (runner up); even so, the film's fine script, humor and chemistry between Bogie and K. Hepburn help sustain its reputation as a classic. A sea of all-white folks board the spaceship ark to save the human race in the dodgy sci-fi entry 'When Worlds Collide,' which must make it a KKKer's dream film. The liftoff scene (where the baddie gets his) is great, though.\n\n1952 (94)\n\nIkiru (Akira Kurosawa)\n\nUmberto D (Vittorio De Sica)\n\nSingin' in the Rain (Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen)\n\nThe Flavor of Green Tea Over Rice (Yasujiro Ozu)\n\n5 Fingers (Joseph Mankiewicz)\n\nThe Marrying Kind (George Cukor)\n\nThe Life of Oharu (Kenji Mizoguchi)\n\nCarrie (William Wyler)\n\nThe Tragedy of Othello (Orson Welles)\n\nLimelight (Charles Chaplin)\n\nThe Importance of Being Earnest (Anthony Asquith)\n\nFeed the Kitty (Chuck Jones)\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nThe Happy Time (Richard Fleischer)\n\nThe Quiet Man (John Ford)\n\nThe Big Sky (Howard Hawks)\n\nThe Member of the Wedding (Fred Zinnemann)\n\nOutcast of the Islands (Carol Reed)\n\nOperation: Rabbit (Chuck Jones)\n\nMillion Dollar Mermaid (Mervyn Leroy)\n\nMother (Okasan) (Mikio Naruse)\n\nThe Bad and the Beautiful (Vincente Minnelli)\n\nNeighbours (Norman McLaren)\n\nChildren of Hiroshima (Children of the Atom Bomb) (Kaneto Shindo)\n\nCome Back, Little Sheba (Daniel Mann)\n\nAngel Face (Otto Preminger)\n\nOn Dangerous Ground (Nicholas Ray)\n\nHigh Noon (Fred Zinnemann)\n\nThe Crimson Pirate (Robert Siodmak)\n\nBeware, My Lovely (Harry Horner)\n\nViva Zapata!

They are cinematic mountains to climb, very heavy stuff, but tremendously rewarding and certain to make a dent in anyone's Kleenex box. Almost as touching, and a lot more funny, is 'Feed the Kitty,' the Chuck Jones classic cartoon about Marc Antony the bulldog and his irresistibly adorable kitten.\n\n'Carrie'--William Wyler's overlooked adaptation of Theodore Dreiser's novel 'Sister Carrie'--is something of a revelation. The skittish studio--too afraid to show anything critical of life in the USA during the height of McCarthyite hysteria--cut a scene in which Lawrence Olivier's downtrodden character flops for the night in a mission house. The scene since has been restored and the movie is a powerful corrective to all the \"love conquers all\" movie myths; in fact, love here is shown as self destructive when pitted against more powerful societal expectations. It ends perfectly--unresolved, and without a sense of hope. 'Operation: Rabbit' (runner up) brings Bugs Bunny and Wile E. Coyote together for one of the more formidable faceoffs in Warner cartoons; the coyote's arrogant spoken boasts and Mel Blanc's exceptional vocal acting make this one of the funniest of Chuck Jones' Warner cartoons. Carol Reed's 'Outcast of the Islands' used to air all the time on Channel 15 and is now impossible to find. The haunting ending is etched in my brain but the rest of the film was too sophisticated for me at the time; I suspect a full viewing today would be rewarding. 'Viva Zapata!'--a film I used to be crazy about--took a tumble in a recent viewing. I find my tolerance lessened for Marlon Brando in the miscast central role; thinking his robust, ethnically flexible co-star Anthony Quinn would have been better as Zapata.\n\n1953 (105) (MGM musicals reach quality peak with The Band Wagon; widescreen era begins)\n\nThe Wages of Fear (Le Salaire de la peur) (H.G.

In another Brit classic, 'Genevieve', marital spats punctuate a genteel cross-country road race. The result is a whimsical, lovely comedy that put the Rank Organisation in the same artistic league as the Ealing studios.\n\nA cruel sea stirred by an atomic blast spit a thawed monster onto the streets of New York in 'The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms' (runner up), the first of the '50s giant-monsters pics and a cherished memory from the days of TV's \"Fright Night.\" 'House of Wax' and 'It Came From Outer Space,' which I saw at the Showcase Cinemas and Vogue Theatre respectively in the late '70s in revivals in the original 3-D process, proved the lameness of simple color filter '3-D' as an effect and the headache-inducing annoyance of the glasses themselves. The films work fairly well without the process, though both are much better on the big screen. 'Hondo' with John Wayne is a virtual copycat of 'Shane' in several key ways. Even so I prefer the Farrow film over the more famous Stevens classic, probably because it's less self important and because the kid in the Wayne film is less annoying than Brandon DeWilde. It pains me to put something as great as Ingmar Bergman's dark, pessimistic circus-set character drama, 'Sawdust and Tinsel,' into the runners-up listing, but we're dealing in miniscule delineations of preference here, and the cutoff has to begin somewhere. Needless to say, it's not the feel-good movie of the year. Most criticism of Otto Preminger's notorious 'The Moon is Blue' (runner up) (first movie to joke (mildly) about virginity) seems to focus on people's disappointment when they find it's not really saucy at all. Still, it's a good, breezy modern romantic comedy. The glaring omission here is 'From Here to Eternity,' a soaper that now seems to me to be unimpressively ordinary. I still find myself trying to warm up to Samuel Fuller's 'Pickup on South Street' (runner up), a good noirish thriller that nonetheless creeps me out for its unabashed anti-commie paranoia (even an apolitical slimey street thug can be a good American as long as he parrots the McCarthyite line by the last reel). Or maybe Fuller is making a darker statement about the American mentality. I'll have to cogitate on it.\n\n1954 (113)\n\nThe Seven Samurai (Akira Kurosawa)\n\nSansho the Bailiff (Kenji Mizoguchi)\n\nHobson's Choice (David Lean)\n\nA Star is Born (George Cukor)\n\nSamurai I (Miyamoto Musashi) (Hiroshi Inagaki)\n\nSalt of the Earth (Herbert Biberman)\n\nRear Window (Alfred Hitchcock)\n\nSabrina (Billy Wilder)\n\nCrime Wave (Andre de Toth)\n\nExecutive Suite (Robert Wise)\n\nA Time Out of War (Denis Sanders)\n\nThe Devil's General (Des Teufels General) (Helmut Kautner)\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nLa Strada (Federico Fellini)\n\nDemetrius and the Gladiators (Delmer Daves)\n\nChikamatsu monogatari (The Crucified Lovers) (Kenji Mizoguchi)\n\nOn the Waterfront (Elia Kazan)\n\nMagnificent Obsession (Douglas Sirk)\n\nAn Inspector Calls (Guy Hamilton)\n\nJohnny Guitar (Nicholas Ray)\n\nApache (Robert Aldrich)\n\nSeven Brides for Seven Brothers (Stanley Donen)\n\nFather Brown, Detective (Robert Hamer)\n\nTwenty-Four Eyes (Keisuke Kinoshita)\n\nThe Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (Luis Bunuel)\n\nThe Miracle of Marcelino (Ladislao Vajda)\n\nA Generation (Andrzej Wajda)\n\nAnimal Farm (Joy Batchelor, John Halas)\n\nBeau Brummell (Curtis Bernhardt)\n\nRichard III (Laurence Olivier)\n\nThe Caine Mutiny (Edward Dmytryk)\n\nThe Maggie (Alexander Mackendrick)\n\nSusan Slept Here (Frank Tashlin)\n\nIt Should Happen to You (George Cukor)\n\nThem!

Because it at least moves, it's a superior sequel to 1953's boring 'The Robe', largely due to Jay Robinson's flamboyant turn as Caligula. I admire 'On the Waterfront' more than I like it, thus the runner-up placement. The notion of the priest as the locus of community morality--and the film's melodramatic notions--makes it seem to me like an old James Cagney/Pat O'Brien meller dressed up in new 'realistic' duds. 'Them!', in which giant ants threaten LA, is probably the classiest, best-looking and least hysterical of the '50s giant monster flicks. It's probably best to see Federico Fellini's \"La Strada\" (runner up) before you see any of the director's other movies (which is how I saw it); otherwise its sentimental, mawkish elements could seem unbearable when stacked against Fellini's later, more detached and less manipulative works. 'Susan Slept Here' (runner up) is a testament to how effevescent young Debbie Reynolds could transform a minor romantic comedy into something special. Frank Tashlin's outrageously beautiful color schemes don't hurt either.\n\n1955 (101) (Hollywood's last 3-strip Technicolor film ('Foxfire') released; 'Marty' shows TV's influence on Hollywood)\n\nBob le Flambeur (Bob the Gambler) (Jean-Pierre Melville)\n\nKiss Me Deadly (Robert Aldrich)\n\nAll That Heaven Allows (Douglas Sirk)\n\nDeath of a Cyclist (Muerte de un ciclista) (Juan Antonio Bardem)\n\nSummertime (David Lean)\n\nEast of Eden (Elia Kazan)\n\nThe Colditz Story (Guy Hamilton)\n\nPather Panchali (Apu Trilogy, 1) (Satyajit Ray)\n\nPicnic (Joshua Logan)\n\nRififi (Du rififi chez les hommes) (Jules Dassin)\n\nI Am a Camera (Henry Cornelius)\n\nOne Froggy Evening (Chuck Jones)\n\nMiyamoto Musashi: Ichijoji no ketto (Samurai II) (Hiroshi Inagaki)\n\nShack Out on 101 (Edward Dein)\n\nRUNNERS UP:\n\nArtists and Models (Frank Tashlin)\n\nThe Prisoner (Peter Glenville)\n\nDiabolique (Les diaboliques) (H.G.

It's also the only Joshua Logan film that's any good. I almost omitted Alain Resnais' famed Holocaust documentary \"Night and Fog' (runner up) simply because so many more interesting films have been made on the subject since; it has the advantage of being closer to the horrific events. In addition to having the coolest title of all time, 'Shack Out on 101' is the best of all commie paranoia movies of the '50s--mainly for its shaggy dog plot and characters and the credible atmosphere it evokes of a remote Pacific Coast highway diner. It's easy to see why the widescreen, color Euro-art movie 'Lola Montes' is so admired, yet it's still mystifying why leading auteurist critic Andrew Sarris once called it the greatest movie ever made. The Ealing Studios' classic 'The Ladykillers' I find not terribly funny and full of squandered opportunities, but it should be seen for its clever premise, charm and vivid view of London in the '50s. Missing here is 'Rebel Without a Cause', which from my viewpoint traffics in teen angst in fairly hokey fashion. Juan Antonio Bardem's Spanish masterpiece, \"Death of a Cyclist,\" was finally released after decades of hiding (by good ole Criterion, on DVD), and it is splendid.\n\n1956 (89+)\n\nA Man Escaped (Robert Bresson)\n\nThe Red Balloon (Albert Lamorisse)\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (Don Siegel)\n\nStreet of Shame (Kenji Mizoguchi)\n\nLa Pointe-Courte (Agnes Varda)\n\nMiyamoto Musashi: Ketto Ganryu-jima (Samurai III) (Hiroshi Inagaki)\n\nPatterns (Fielder Cook)\n\nThe Railroad Man (Il Ferroviere) (Pietro Germi)\n\nThe Harder They Fall (Mark Robson)\n\nThe Ten Commandments (Cecil B.

Signs of life, though, continued to come from Japan, and low-budget cult classics with attitude from Stanley Kubrick and Don Siegel showed that subversion and imagination were still around. Probably no film says more about 1956, though, than a 10-minute industrial a"
