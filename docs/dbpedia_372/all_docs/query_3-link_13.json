        "text": "Interpreting the Past: People\n\nThis collection of property records turn out to be a great starting place for social histories of small town people, particularly those wealthy enough to record land contracts and inheritances in writing.\n\nA diverse cast of characters appear in both the will and sasines. Most documents named at least six to eight individuals and include family and social relationships, places of residence, and, in some cases, professions to reveal personal and professional networks around Linlithgow and Bathgate, Scotland for the sasines and across Great Britian for Sir George’s will.\n\nFamily Networks\n\nFamilies were important – particularly parents and children, in both types of document. Mothers and fathers, wives\n\nand husbands, sons and daughters both alive and dead were repeatedly mentioned – with emphasis on their ‘laufull’ or legal status.\n\nWENTWORTH WILL FISHER SASINE\n\nSir George Wentworth John Fisher of Torphichen Mill\n\nWife — Dame Anne Wentworth Father – John Fisher, d.\n\nEldest Son — William Wentworth Grandfather – Robert Fisher d.\n\nYounger Son — Ruishe Wentworth ???? – Agnes Fisher\n\nDaughter — Elizabeth Wentworth Landlord – William Ker,\n\nBaron of Mauel-Foulis\n\nOne 1699 saisine (Document 14) documents John Fisher, son of the deceased John Fisher, a miller, and grandson of Robert Fisher who claims lands and tenants in the Barony of Manuel Foulis (Crownerland).\n\nAn Agnes Fisher is listed as a tenant. Was she related?\n\nOther sasines name wives, daughters, and daughters-in-law as landowners and tenants.\n\nPutting the documents together can add to the family tree. The elder John Fisher in 1679 (Document 16) deeded half his land and rents in the Barony to his wife, Margaret Whitlaw – presumably the younger John Fisher’s mother.\n\nFamily Trees\n\nFor the gentry, questions of bloodlines and inheritance were important considerations. The will of Sir George Wentworth shows how one member of that class saw fit to distribute his goods and possessions to his wife and children after his death, and his social network which produced the executors. But who were these people, and how can we find out?\n\nConfirming the Ruishe connection also makes sense of the will: George’s third son is “Ruishee,” his wife’s family name. Anne is the daughter of Francis Ruishee of Castle Jordan, County Meath, Ireland, and his heir. So when George gave his son William twice the money he left to Ruishe, it presumably was with the understanding that Ruishe might inherit more from his mother’s side of the family.\n\nProfessional Responsibilities\n\nWe also identified several professions – both people who had a role in creating a legal document in the seventeenth century and a host of other occupations. Many occupations named were for legal professions.\n\nLegal Actors\n\nWENTWORTH WILL FISHER SASINE\n\nExecutors\n\nDame Anne Wentworth, wife William Bell, clerk, notary public\n\nSir George Savile, great nephew Robert Bell, writer\n\nFrancis Colley, friend/servant John Eiston, procurator, lawyer\n\nWilliam Chadwell , ??? William Ker, landowner\n\nAlexr. Craufurd, portioner, d.\n\nThomas Brown., portioner, d.\n\nPatrick Shaw, landowner\n\nJohn Finlay, tenant\n\nAgnes Fisher, tenant?\n\nWorking the Land\n\nThe land grants provide a good sense of some of the professions exercised in the Scottish countryside or in small towns. In addition to men of letters and men of the law, we read about land owners and tenants. Portioner.\n\nA few of the sasines mention millers (mlyner) and require the person working the land to supply grain to a local mill. Witnes xxx is identifed as being a tailor (taylor) ?? Others.\n\nDo you recognize professions or responsibilities that are still in use today?"
