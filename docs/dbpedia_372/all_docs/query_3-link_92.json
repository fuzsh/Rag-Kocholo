        "text": "Welcome to the Norfolk County Registry of Deeds Online Research System. This is the result of an ongoing effort to bring the records of the Registry into the homes and offices of Norfolk County residences and businesses. We advise you to take some time to familiarize yourself with the program to make your searching more efficient so that you get the results that you are looking for.\n\nBegin Online Research brings you directly to the online data base. We strongly recommend you take a look at the introductory paragraph at the top of each search category to ensure that you enter your search criteria correctly.\n\nIntroduction to Research will explain the available categories of information in the research database and a general idea about how to search for information. It also provides information on how to become a subscriber so that you can print images from the system.\n\nThe Advanced Research Guide is a helpful tool for those not familiar with searching land records. It is an in-depth narrative about how to search and the different ways of searching our data base. It explains the differences between the Registry and the Land Court and how to maneuver in both sections and how to search if you do not have an owner’s name to start with. It is highly recommended that you check out the guide.\n\nFor computer access two options are available, “Log in” and “Free Access”. The difference is that the Log-in option requires an annual subscription and is required for printing of official copies of scanned images. There is no charge for printing copies of land documents that have “Not an Official Copy” at top of document.\n\nThe Application/Service Agreement is for our professional customers. You can establish an Online Account that will enable you to print clean or unmarked images. There is a yearly fee and a printing charge of $1.00 per page, as set forth in MGL Ch.262, s. 38.\n\nSearch for YOUR Deed is a program we set up for people who are just interested in the ownership of their own property. It is simple to use and will generate information only about deeds. Only the owner’s name and the town they live in are required to search this program.\n\nBegin Online Research"
