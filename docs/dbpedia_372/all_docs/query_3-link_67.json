        "text": "The Siskiyou County Assessor's Office is pleased to provide you with the capability to find your property by Assessor's Parcel Number (APN) or by street address online. Some parcels, such as vacant land, do not have street addresses, so you will need to use the APN for your search.\n\nWe hope you find this information useful. Please contact us with your comments and suggestions, or if you notice any errors in our information.\n\nParcel Maps\n\nThe Assessor’s Office establishes and maintains a set of maps showing every parcel of land in the county, which serve as a basis for the assessment of all real property in Siskiyou County. These maps are continuously updated to reflect new boundary lines, subdivisions and surveys. The maps are available for public review and copies may be purchased at the Assessor’s Office or online via the link at the bottom of this page. Further information on the Assessor's Parcel Maps, including general location, is provided here: Assessor's Map Book Locations\n\nSingle-Family Residential (SFR) Property Characteristics\n\nProperty characteristics are available for a majority of our SFR parcels online, with additional properties being added daily. If you are not given the option to purchase characteristics for a particular SFR parcel and would like to, contact us with the APN and we will update our database (expect a delay for processing time). Property Characteristics for agricultural, multi-residential, commercial and industrial properties are not available online and must be purchased at our front counter.\n\nLegal Limitations\n\nCalifornia Government Code Section 6254.21 prohibits the display of home addresses or telephone numbers of any elected or appointed official on the Internet by a State or Local Agency without first obtaining the written permission of that individual.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nClicking the AGREE link below will direct you to an off-site data service. This service has been provided to allow easy access and a visual display of county information. Every reasonable effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the maps and data provided; nevertheless, some information may not be accurate. The County of Siskiyou assumes no responsibility arising from use of this information. The maps and associated data are provided without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a purpose. Do not make any business decisions based on this data before validating your decision through recorded documents or information from applicable local government agencies.\n\nProprietary Information\n\nThe information you obtain on this site is proprietary, and any resale is prohibited.\n\nAcknowledgement\n\nI have read the above disclaimer and AGREE with the terms and conditions."
