During this intervening century both were still seen as legitimate or even progressive articles of commerce. Taking coca and cocaine as goods--rather than singularly spiritual or pariah substances--may also temper some of the passionate thinking (and policies) that surround these Andean products today.\" Preliminary Paper Conference on “Latin America and Global Trade” Social Science History Institute, Stanford University November 16-17 2001\n\n[1870 ref to] \"After Moreno and Maiz, Dr. Gazeau in 1870 studied the stimulating effects of coca on nutrition and found that it increased the pulse and respiration, assisted digestion, increased urinary excretion, and strengthened the nervous system. This author arrived at the conclusion that coca prolongs life and promotes muscular energy. He advises its use, locally, for stomatitis, gingivitis, aphthous ulceration, and generally for painful and difficult digestion, gastric disturbances in phthisis and also for obesity. (Note. It should be remarked that Coca in Colombia has historically been given in infusions to children for stomach cramps and other). (Mariani)\n\n[1883 ref to] Little use was made of it (the alkaloid cocaine, isolated in pure form) in Europe until 1883, when a German army physician, Dr. Theodor Aschenbrandt, secured a supply of pure cocaine from the pharmaceutical firm of Merck and issued it to Bavarian soldiers during their autumn maneuvers. He reported beneficial effects on their ability to endure fatigue” in Schaffer Drug Library Cocaine\n\nref to 1883] Annemarie Bos The History of Licit Cocaine in the Netherlands: \"In 1833 ... coca plants were introduced in the Dutch East Indies and 3 years later commercial planting started. The coca introduced in the Dutch East Indies was another species than the one that was grown in South America and initially it was difficult to extract cocaine from these leaves. However in the 1890s the German company Farbwerke developed a new extraction method especially for Java coca. This new but difficult process resulted in a substantial increase in the yield of cocaine from Java cocaand soon it exceeded the supply from South American coca by almost twice the output. Until 1900, the sole customer for leaves of Java was this German company, which had the exclusive patent for the processing of Java coca into cocaine. The monopoly enabled the company Farbwerke to keep prices ofcoca leaves low.\"De Economist 154, NO. 4, 2006\n\n[1884 ref to] “Merck made about a quarter of world cocaine and for a decade; it was the firm’s most profitable single product line. … The turning point for Merck was 1884-86 (i.e., the start of anesthesia and other medical uses) when prices and output jumped five and twenty-times respectively. The spike caused a much-discussed and alarming international “crisis” in coca supply. Merck’s strategy was to encourage Peruvian suppliers of “crude cocaine” (and likely sent agents to Lima to this end), a semi-processed (80- 90% pure) jungle cocaine-sulfate cake. This shipped far easier and efficiently than dried leaf, and was processed into medicinal grade cocaine in Germany for Merck’s global distribution network. It also fit the German cultural-medical preference for “pure” scientific cocaine. By 1900, almost all German imports--more than 6,000 kilos a year at peak in 1903-5, worth nearly 100,000£--arrived in this form, superceding coca-leaf.” (Gootenberg)\n\n[1884 ref to] B. Raymond Fink : The Introduction of Local Anesthesia,: \"Koller was the one who, in 1884, realized and demonstrated the ability of cocaine to produce surgical local anesthesia. This landmark in humanity's long struggle against pain was one of the most important medical discoveries of the nineteenth century, or any century, and missed winning the Nobel Prize only because I it was made a little too soon, and too convincingly (Liljestrand,G.:Actaphysiol.scand.Suppl299,1967], p.5)\n\n[1884 ref to] David F. Musto Opium, Cocaine and Marijuana in American History The story of cocaine use in America is somewhat shorter than that of opium, but it follows a similar plot. In 1884 purified cocaine became commercially available in the U.S. At first the wholesale cost was very high-S5 to $10 a gram-but it soon fell to 25 cents a gram and remained there until the price inflation of World War I. Problems with cocaine were evident almost from the beginning, but popular opinion and the voices of leading medical experts depicted cocaine as a remarkable, harmless stimulant. William A. Hammond, one of America's most prominent neurologists, extolled cocaine in print and lectures. By 1887 Hammond was assuring audiences that cocaine was no more habit-forming than coffee or tea. He also told them of the \"cocaine wine\" he had perfected with the help of a New York druggist: two grains of cocaine to a pint of wine. Hammond claimed that this tonic was far more effectivethan the popular French coca wine, probably a reference to Vin Mariani, which he complained had only half a grain of cocaine to the pint.Coca-Cola was also introduced in 1886 as a drink offering the advantages of coca but lacking the danger of alcohol. It amounted to a temperance coca beverage. The cocaine was removed in 1900, a year before the city of Atlanta, Ga., passed an ordinance (and a state statute the following year) prohibiting provision of any cocaine to a consumer without a prescription.” Scientific American July 1991\n\n[1885] Über Coca\n\nFreud - Although Freud mentions many possibly uses (in asthma, stomach problems, anesthesia, and recovery from wasting diseases), most doctors (Freud included) thought that cocaine’s major therapeutic value would be in psychiatry. Although at the time doctors had many nervous system depressants available (such as laudanum, ether, or morphine), they didn’t have any stimulants. Doctors were already using cocaine for treatment of melancholic inhibition (major depressive disorder), and hypochondria (Antonio Julian, 1787). Studies were already taking place on the chronic effects of subcutaneous cocaine in depressed patients (Morselli and Buccola). The researchers observed a “slight improvement” in mood, but mostly noted the effects on digestion. Freud also noted that cocaine could be a powerful aphrodisiac (though he noted the sexual effects in some of his patients, he did not say whether he experienced any himself), and called for further investigation into the psychiatric effects of cocaine. Medical rescription by Sigmund Freud [1893] \"Freud beieves cocaine addiction is more due to the user's personbality than to the drug itself\". [García Hoyos 2002].\n\n[1884-1930 ref to] Ruetsch, Böni and Borgeat: From cocaine to ropivacaine: the history of local anesthetic drugs. “As suggested by his friend Sigmund Freud, descriptions of the properties of the coca prompted the Austrian Koller to perform in 1884 the first clinical operation under local anesthesia, by administration of cocaine on the eye. The use of cocaine for local and regional anesthesia rapidly spread throughout Europe and America. The toxic effects of cocaine were soon identified resulting in many deaths among both patients and addicted medical staff. Local anesthesia was in a profound crisis until the development of modern organic chemistry which led to the synthesis of pure cocaine in 1891. New amino ester local anesthetics were synthesized between 1891 and 1930, such as tropocaine, eucaine, holocaine, orthoform, benzocaine, and tetracaine. In addition, amino amide local anesthetics were prepared between 1898 and 1972 including nirvaquine, procaine, chloroprocaine, cinchocaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, efocaine, bupivacaine, etidocaine, and articaine. All of these drugs were ostensibly less toxic than cocaine, but they had differing amounts of central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular (CV) toxicity.”\n\n[1889] “..the rising cultivation, consumption and export of this so precious article of our agricultural production [coca]--once widely known and used for health purposes--will replace tea and coffee themselves..” Informe sobre la coca ( La Crónica Médica , Lima, 31 Oct. 1889 (in Gootenberg)\n\n[1890] Angelo Mariani Coca and its therapeutic application But should coca be regarded as merely a masticatory? And must we accept as irrevocable the decision of certain therapists? : “Cocaine worthless, coca a superfluous drug?”, New York 1890\n\n[1904 ref to] Alfred Einhorn, one of the first pharmaceutical chemists, spent years evaluating cocaine and other local anesthetics. He stated in 1899 that (referring to Koller's use of cocaine) \"since that time cocaine has been used frequently despite its numerous disadvantages, namely its great toxicity, the short duration of anesthesia, the impossibility of sterilizing the solution, its high cost, and so on -all factors which stimulated chemists to seek a substitute for cocaine which is free of its disadvantages or at least possesses them to a lesser degree.\" Such considerations have continued to influence the synthesis of new anesthetics to the present time.[…] Einhorn synthesized procaine in 1904, following synthesis of a number of compounds that lacked suitable anesthetic properties (Eucaine, Orthoform, Nirvanine, Holocaine). It was Heinrich Braun, however, who first published a description of procaine in 1905. Procaine became the most widely used local anesthetic until the introduction of the amide lidocaine, prepared by Löfgren in the 1940s. Such was the popularity of procaine, that to this day, most patients and many doctors (unfortunately) still use the name \"Novocain\" as a generic term for any local anesthetic.”Stanley F. Malamed: What's New in Local Anesthesia?, DDS School of Dentistry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California Anesth Prog 39:125-131 1992\n\n[1895-1939 ref] \"Synthetic drugs are the mainstay of the modern pharmaceutical industry, but the molecular manipulation that gave rise to new drugs began in Germany at the end of the nineteenth century, and Germany held a monopoly in synthetic drugs prior to the First World War, with drugs such as Salvarsan, Novocaine and Aspirin. As a result there has been a dearth of interest in this aspect of the development of the pharmaceutical industry outside the Germanic countries and an assumption that America and Britain eventually followed the German model. I will discuss how this was not always the case, at least until after 1939. […] “Pre-war Germany’s trade was very much enhanced by selling cartels and the drawing together of large manufacturing concerns. The first achievements were the elimination of competition within Germany and the organisation of concerted effects to undersell rivals in those lines where dangerous competition seemed likely to arise. There was certainly plenty of evidence of these sales cartels and the practice of selling below cost at the least threat of competition.” Keith J.

Several of the State Legislatures have already adopted bills restricting the legitimate sale of this chemical, while in others similar measures are pending. The Governor of Pennsylvania has recently approved a bill that had been passed by the State Legislature, which provides: \"That no person shall sell, furnish, or give away cocaine, or any patent or proprietary remedy containing cocaine, except on the written prescription of a registered physician, or of a dentist, or of a veterinarian; nor shall any such prescription be refilled ; nor shall any physician, dentist or veterinarian prescribe cocaine or any patent or proprietary remedy containing cocaine, for any person known to such physician, dentist or veterinarian to be an habitual user of cocaine.\" \" Provided that provisions of this act shall not apply to persons engaged in the wholesale drug trade, regularly selling cocaine to persons engaged in the retail drug trade.\" Persons violating any of the provisions of this act are to be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than £100, or to undergo an imprisonment of not more than six months, or both, at the discretion of the court.\n\nHarry B. Mason: The Legislative Year. “The legislative year of 1902-3 in pharmacy has been full of interest, and full of suggestion also. It has registered a distinct advance in the enactment of a number of laws of real importance and necessity, and as usual it has brought forth also a chaotic mass of impossible, vicious and foolish measures which would have been sad commentaries on our national intelligence had they not failed of passage. No fewer than ninety-eight bills were introduced in the various State and territorial legislatures; nineteen of these found a place upon the statute books; and it is extremely fortunately such that on the whole this winnowing process selected the wheat from the chaff with sure intelligence. Speaking first of the bills which became law, it is exceedingly gratifying, in view of the threatening spread of the cocaine evil, that the year has produced four cocaine acts — those of Georgia, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Texas. Three of these measures contain features which render them decided improvements over pre-existing cocaine legislation. The Georgia law is the customary one limiting the sale of cocaine to physicians' prescriptions, and prohibiting the refilling of these prescriptions. But all three of the other laws go further and stop up a leak which has practically nullified the cocaine acts of several of the Southern States: they prohibit physicians from giving prescriptions for the drug to habitues, provide quite heavy penalties for violations, and in one instance (the Illinois measure) declare that the offending person shall have his license as a physician revoked upon conviction of the second offense. Moreover, recognizing that catarrh snuffs and other preparations containing the drug are fertile causes of cocaine addiction, the Illinois act by implication, and the Pennsylvania act by specific statement, place the sale of these articles upon exactly the same basis as the alkaloid itself. The Texas measure unfortunately exempts proprietary preparations, and it differs from the other acts also in throwing its restrictions around the sale, not of cocaine alone, but as well of morphine and opium. Incidentally it may be remarked that the phraseology of the Texas enactment is unfortunately such that the druggists of the State tear they will not be permitted to sell such common preparations as paregoric and Dover's powder save upon a physician's prescription, and in conformity with the provisions of the law.\n\n[…] Cocaine measures of varying merit failed of passage in the legislatures of Alabama, California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Mis- souri, Wyoming and West Virginia […]four cocaine bills, three of them uncommonly meritorious, Have been passed ; the druggists of New York State have secured the enactment of a liquor law with which they are greatly pleased ; in the prohibition States of Ver- mont and New Hampshire the illegal and promiscuous sale of liquor has given way to its sale under restrictions which are at once wise and enforceable; ..”\n\n(Cocaine use) “Connecticut reports a physician who has treated over 1,200 cases in twenty-eight years ; fifty per cent, were addicted to morphine, thirty per cent, to opium and preparations and fifteen per cent, to cocaine. The cases were not confined to Connecticut. Georgia report says: Almost every colored prostitute addicted to cocaine; another, a physician's prescription reading cocaine 25 cents' worth. Indiana reports that a good many negroes and a few white women are addicted to cocaine. Maryland reports the sale of cocaine by disreputable physicians, the purchase by a retailer of #500 worth in six weeks ; of a small dealer who purchases on an average twenty-five ounces cocaine per week. Michigan reports increasing sale to negroes. Minnesota reports a case using several large bottles of efferves- cing salts per week, a case using chloroform, ether, chloral, cocaine and morphine, trional users among the theatrical profession. Ohio reports sales of jobbers to a lew druggists only which aggre- gate 600 ounces cocaine per month. J Acquirement of Drug Habits. Pennsylvania reports several heroin cases, another the purchase by a small retailer of 100,000 -grain morphine pills at a time. The sale of cocaine in drinks by saloon men is extensively followed. Virginia reports enormous growth of cocaine habit among ne- groes. General reports indicate that the sale of narcotics is not restricted to any section of the country, nor confined exclusively to the fallen and lower class. Information comes from several sources that in callings which demand many hours' work at a time or the hours of night, cocaine is resorted to for stimulation. […]Some patent-medicine manufacturers want to impress the con. sumer with the immediate relief idea ; nothing like cocaine for one who suffers with catarrh, nothing like an opiate for a pain, nothing like a stimulant to revive the patient who has become despondent over his supposed ailment. They have found the way to health and tell their friends about it, who help them spread the news, and soon we have a testimonial and a picture in our great dailies. If these combinations are good, and in reality only one of the ingredients does this wonderful work, why not take it by itself. We have now created an habitue in embryo. […]I have not devoted any space to the lower walks of life and will quote two in part. One from Montana reads : « Most drug fiends of this section come from the Pacific coast. They commence with smoking opium, which becomes too expensive and consumes too much time, so they eat morphine ; then they use it by injection because it goes further, then they tip their injection off with cocaine because it deadens the pain, and gradually they use more cocaine than morphine.\" The other report carries with it the same idea relative to morphine and cocaine, and says further that cocaine fiends are vicious, but that the habit is not as chaining as morphine. […] (See figures)..” of imports of opium, morphine, cocaine and chloral during the fiscal years 1901, 1902 and 1903 (nine months.) — The imports of cocaine salts are given only in the shape of the value of the quantity entered at the Custom Houses. There is an increase of $77,7$6 in the value of cocaine imported in 1902 over that for 1901, of $67,115 for the equivalent of the nine months of 1903 reported. Averaging $3 an ounce as the value of the cocaine, this gives us an increased importation of 25,920 ounces in 1902 and 22,372 ounces for nine months of 1903 — a fact that speaks volumes in itself. …We are unfortunate in not having a report on the importation of coca.\n\n.[…] No doubt Prof. J. H. Beal, to whom the model cocaine law has been referred, will call attention to restrictions in the various States, and to refer to these here would simply mean repetition. The chairman believes that stringent State legislation providing fine and imprisonment with surrender of license to practise medicine and pharmacy is the best means to control this vice. Legislation has a tendency to induce secret sale by individuals, therefore various kinds of punishment are necessary. It does not seem practical for the Government to assume supervision of the sale other than perhaps by legislation, if the States fail in the necessary control. If handled like the cigar tax, it would avail little ; if like spirits, the plan would be exceedingly cumbersome and expensive, if not impractical, not only for the Government, but also for the druggists, and the business details of the latter are such that even now a large gross profit nets only insignificant returns. You are no doubt aware that in the larger cities, and possibly in the smaller, cocaine is served on request in drinks, and indications are that in places of this character all these drugs are supplied. The concluding remarks which the chairman would make are interwoven in some of those made by his col- league and are the result of his careful study and investigation […]\n\nSee “The Cocaine Habit” The frightful effects of coca ne on users of this very \" devil-drug \" have been so often and graphically told that it is hardly necessary to retell the story. One peculiar feature of the cocaine habit noted by the writer is that one of the first signs of the use in a person is that the habitue loses all care for personal appearance or neatness, and a man formerly the pink of neatness soon becomes noticeably slovenly in dress and appearance. There does not seem to be anything yet discovered that has as baneful an effect on the user as does cocaine. The writer has seen this drug literally turn a bright, high-principled man into a sneak-thief and liar, absolutely without regard for morality or principle. One redeeming feature there is : the habitual use of cocaine seems to lessen both sexual desire and ability, so there is less danger of its transmission by heredity.

Opium was one of the most profitable trading items of the Dutch East Indies and contributed a great deal to government receipts. The increasing popularity of coca and cocaine in the late 19th century sparked the then new idea of planting coca in the Dutch East Indies and of exporting its leaf to the West. This turned out to be a major success by the beginning of the 20th century as the Netherlands became the largest producer of coca in the world. This situation ended in the late 1920s as the result of international treaties and national laws which restricted production severely. […] The largest and most important manufacturer of cocaine in the Netherlands was the Nederlandsche CocaÄ±nefabriek , established in 1900 at the Schinkelkade in Amsterdam. Compared to the pharmaceutical plants in Germany, the Dutch Cocaine Factory was a small and specialized factory. Most of its foreign competitors were big pharmaceutical and highly diversified factories, which produced numerous other commodities beside cocaine. These companies could afford to spend a lot of money on marketing, whereas the Dutch Cocaine Factory only had a small marketing budget. However, because of its successful price-competition strategy, the Dutch Cocaine Factory was able to gain a growing market share. The company expanded rapidly in particular during World War I. Although the planters had a difficult time during World War I, the Dutch Cocaine Factory flourished. The demand for cocaine rose dramatically as a result of the war, while supply lines and rival factories were cut off by the war.[…] The Dutch Cocaine Factory continued to play an important role in the production of cocaine throughout the 1920s. Nevertheless, due to the decreasing demand for cocaine and increased competition from foreign manufacturers the factory was forced to diversify and produce other mostly synthetic products. In 1921 it began with Novocain, which had been invented much earlier but became relevant after legal constraints were imposed on commercial cocaine. 5 As time went by, the synthetic replacements for cocaine became more and more important and compensated for the shrinking demand for cocaine in the 1920s.” De Economist 154, NO. 4, 2006\n\n[1910 ref to] Cocaine History, Use and Abuse, “…spread of morphia, and cocaine habit is becoming an eveil more serious and more deadly than opium smoking, and this evil is certain to increase.” Sir Edward Grey, Foreign Minister writing to the American Ambassador in London 1910, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, 1999\n\n1912- UNODC/ The 1912 Hague International Opium Convention (Text) “In addition to opium and morphine, which were already under extensive international discussion, the Hague Convention also included two new substances that had become problematic: cocaine and heroin.”, January 23, 1912\n\n[1914 ref to] Anne Coppel: We tend to forget that cocaine has a role to pay in our history.

This liquid is then mixed with ashes to give it consistency, and bits of crushed chilli peppers added. When the paste is cold it is cut into small block which are wrapped in green-plantain leaves and buried in the ground for several days ‘the heat of the soil makes the mambe good’, according to the Indians. This product is taken to market, where the coca is also sold in chunks whcih can cost from one to twenty cents. Two cents worth of this paste are a person’s weekly rations and a pound is the equivalent of a 10-week ration. \". …Coca chewing is a habit much like morphine is to a morfinómano (morphine addict) and cocaine to the cocainómano.

Colombia, I and II, Bogota. 1949, 1951. \"The most accurate and complete account of the religious uses of coca among modern Indians is Reichel-Dolmatoff's report on the significance of coca among the Kogi, a group of Indians of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta which has been sufficiently isolated to retain many tribal traditions. Among the Kogi the use of coca is restricted to the males. After the evening meal, the men either retire to meditate and chew coca or they go to the ceremonial house to chew coca and spend the night dancing, chanting, and having ceremonial conversations with \"Los Antiguos.\" Reichel-Dolmatoff's account gives a clear description of their motives for chewing coca: \"Upon the effect of the coca, the Kogi emphasizes in the first place that its consumption brings a certain mental clarity which one ought to take advantage of for ceremonial gatherings and any religious act in general, being conversations, personal rites, or group rites. Evidently the coca causes a euphoric state which lasts for a long period and is prolonged by the gradual consumption of larger and larger quantities. The individual turns into an animated speaker, and says that he feels an agreeable sensation of tingling over all the body and that his memory is considerably refreshed which permits him to speak, sing, and recite during the following hours. In the second place the Kogi say that coca appeases hunger. According to them, however, this never is the object of consuming coca but only an agreeable consequence, seeing that during the ceremonies or ceremonial conversations the consumption of food is prohibited and the assistants ought to fast. Another effect which is attributed to the coca is insomnia. Here again the Kogi see an advantage since the ceremonial conversations should be carried on at night and individuals who can speak and sing for one or several nights without sleep, merit high prestige. The Kogi ideal would be to never eat anything beside coca, to abstain totally from sex, to never sleep, and to speak all of his life of the \"Ancients,\" that is to say, to sing, to dance and to recite.\" [en Martin]\n\n[1949] UNODC The Commission of Inquiry on the Coca Leaf pages 20-41 /(en mamacoca). At the beginning of September this year the United Nations dispatched a Commission of Enquiry to South America to study certain aspects of two uses to which the leaf of the coca bush is put. Nobody knows for certain for how many hundreds of years the leaves of the coca bush have been chewed in South America. It is probable that the practice was well established before the beginning of the eleventh century and it is certain that coca leaves were chewed during the lifetime of the Inca Empire. Precise explanations for the origin of this age-long habit have not yet been made but it is possible that it owes its beginnings to conditions of life that were always severe, especially in so far as the difficulties of producing enough food were concerned, and that it was used from the start to ameloriate the bodily distress caused ]by the hard conditions endured by the inhabitants of that part of the world. Even today man in those regions is often engaged in a life-long struggle with the forceps of nature for a hare existence, and it is where such conditions continue even in the twentieth century to exist that the habit of chewing the coca leaf is now most widely practised. Such is the most generally admitted explanation of the origin of the custom, but it is emphasized that the possibility of the practice having originally had a considerable sacred or religious aspect, which may indeed still continue to exist in modified forms, should by no means he excluded.[1949]\n\n(The cocÃ³logos point out that there were no scientists on this Commission)\n\nUNODC Commission of Enquiry on the Coca Leaf pages 41-57., “The limitation of the production of the coca leaf, as well as that of opium and other raw materials for the manufacture of narcotics, was discussed during the International Opium Conference held at Geneva from November 1924 to February 1925. … In 1931 the question of the limitation of the production of the coca leaf was again raised during the general discussion at the Conference for the Limitation of the Manufacture of Narcotic Drugs. It was, however, decided that such limitation could not be discussed in view of the Conference's terms of reference. [… ] In April 1949 the Secretary-General received a request from the Government of Bolivia that the Commission of Enquiry should extend its activities, to that country, a request duly considered by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs in June 1949. At that time the Commission also re-examined the Secretary-General's plans for the Commission of Enquiry in the light of the financial appropriation which the General Assembly had made for it in the previous November, and decided that the $17,000 provided would hardly he sufficient to allow the Commission of Enquiry to spend enough time in the field to make the thorough study for which its terms of reference provided.

Focusing on the effort to regulate coca commodities (including coca leaves, pharmaceutical cocaine, and Coca-Cola flavoring extracts), this paper ex-amines the intersection of US-directed development policies, policing, and the expanding influence of US capitalism. A seemingly neutral language of science and public health was deployed to rationalize the implementation of a regulatory framework which selectively criminalized sites of coca cultivation, production and consumption. Drug control became a tool for silencing political dissent while “modernizing” the economy. Indigenous Aymara and Quechua peoples’ customary uses of the coca leaf were at-tacked in conjunction with efforts to limit the “legitimate” market to raw material exports destined for North American manufacturers.

Cocaine, morphine, and heroin use had all declined drastically from their peak in the 1920’s, and only a small segment of America’s population is indulging in drugs.

The cocaine alkaloid (beyond coca) can be consumed in several forms: a white crystalline powder (salts) or in rocks (crystals): basic coca paste (BCP) – a cocaine sulphate which would be the equivalent of the crude cocaine of the end of the 19th century which was a semi-processed cocaine base- and hydrochloride cocaine. Most authors place the emergence of smokeable cocaine in the first half of the 1970s (see 1974) in cocaine- processing areas. Initially, it appeared as basuco (basura de la coca = coca trash) one of the steps that leads to hydrochloride cocaine processing. Basuco is the least refined product of them all, the one that contains the most impurities; BCP involves more precursors than basuco but less than cocaine. Hydrochloride cocaine is not smokeable since it volatilizes when subjected to high temperatures but it is mainly inhaled and can be used via injection since it is water-soluble.\n\n[..] Currently, cocaine is adulterated not only by street vendors but also directly in the laboratories where it is processed. One of the most worrisome adulterating substances is Levamisole, a medication used to treat parasitic worm infection in animals. Today it is almost impossible to find pure cocaine or cocaine that is not cut with dangerous adulterating substances that are generally the main health issue for users (particularly IDU) who have no idea what they are consuming. Thus users' demands for drug testing facilities. This 'ignorance' also distorts estimates since, when estimating tons consumed, this variable is rarely taken into consideration. Another problem with drug estimates (apart from the difficulty of measuring an illegal venture and the tendency to conveniently create to manipulate) is that cocaine use measurements are lumped together with basuco/BCP smoking estimates. These are far form being the same drug. Basuco, is the Colombian antecedent of crack and freebase. Freebasing is wafting in cocaine during the process of making crack. Crack is made by cooking cocaine with bicarbonate soda or processing with ammonia.\n\n[..] The basuco market in Colombia is said to be a direct result of a time when drug laws made it hard to bring in the precursors needed to make cocaine and when smuggling cocaine out became more and more difficult. So, people in the cocaine labs who had discovered basuco could be smoked, started opening a domestic market . There are those who believe (Anthony Henman) that cocaine sulphate was smoked in Peru in the 19th century when Merck taught the Peruvians to make crude cocaine to export to Europe instead of the fragile coca leaves. Currently, what seems to be happening is that those same precursor controls are pushing cocaine processing to other countries where certain less-strict precursor controls make setting up cocaine-processing labs interesting ventures. This means that the coca paste, which is still made from the only currently existing coca-growing countries, the Andean countries, is the in export product; with all the dangers this implies for expanding these other countries' domestic markets for smokeable cocaines. .[2017]\n\nSee also Frantz DePierre v The United States 2011)\n\n[1970s ref to] Bruce Bagley The Colombian Connection: In Deborah Pacini and Christine Franquemont(editors): Coca and Cocaine Effects on People and Policy in Latin America : “The Impact of Drug Traffic on Colombia: “Over the latter part of the 1970s and particularly in the early 1980s, the use of basuco, a form of coca paste that is smoked rather than inhaled, has increased in Colombia. The reasons behind this increase are not at all clear. Some evidence indicates that the US recession and the decreased ability to buy luxury items created a surplus co­caine market in Colombia which could not be disposed of in other markets. Hence Colombians began pushing the partially refined paste used in basuco more than in the past, at lower prices than in the past. Another theory con­tends that the spread of cocaine production in Colombia from 1980 on spurred a number of experiments in a variety of areas to develop different types of cocaine made from coca grown on different soils. Many of those experiments did not, if I can use this phrase, \"fall on fertile ground\" and hence produced less than adequate cocaine. It is this lower quality cocaine, the theory suggests, that is dumped in Colombia. […]\n\n[..] There is probably a bit of truth to both theories, but nonetheless the increasing use and, in this case, abuse of cocaine in certain segments of Colombian society is an undeniable reality, particularly in the context of the urban poor in Medellin, where recession has caused high levels of unemployment. Many teenagers and others have been thrown into idleness which has resulted in drug abuse. The same is true in Colombia's other major cities -Bogot5, Cali, Barranquilla and others. Colombia is now increasingly preoccupied with the social prob­lem drug consumption represents for the country internally.\n\n[…] The exact numbers of individuals using basuco in Colombia are not known. The US State Department and DEA tend to make much of this par­ticular problem because it fits into their analysis -that is, it is no longer simply an American problem but also a Colombian problem. While there is no solid evidence to indicate exactly how many people are involved, we're probably talking about 100,000 to even 200,000 people. There also has not been a major effort to systematically study the degree to which drug abuse is a problem in Colombian cities. One of the reasons for the lack research, and subsequently, knowledge about this topic is that such an in­vestigation might undermine US policy. This, however, would be a ma-or reason for conducting greater research in order to find out exactly the dimensions of the problem. It seems to me that there are few people who have attempted to do that, and funding is limited to do so in most areas of Colombia right now.

Of the 10,000 tons introduced into the US during that year, between 60 and 65 percent was supplied by Colombian traffickers.

This time he held that the underground economy was so powerful that simply repressive formulas were not near enough; the scope of the problem exceeds by far the instruments to regulate it. New alternatives are required. We are, after all, in the face of the fact of either recognizing the mafias or being disregarded them and all getting misled. Thus, as we suggested a year ago, marijuana legalization is the only way of legitimizing these revenues so we also consider it pertinent to suggest the need to give these underground capitals institutional escape valves; to grant amnesties fro these vast fortunes; allow for the possibility of investing them in securities and not properties; and providing special incentives for publicly declaring them would be the three basic formulas in order to avoid that, by keeping them clandestine, these capitals and their owners deal a final blow to our institutions and our people and they buy us off, which in the end is one and the same thing.
