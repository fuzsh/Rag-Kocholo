        "text": "Please note on the document what has been changed to help our staff quickly determine if a new signature is required to be attached and to help searchers in the future be able to tell what was changed between the original and the re-recording without having to compare the documents.\n\nIf the original of the recorded document cannot be located and was not recorded in another locality, a deed of correction can be prepared for deeds and a new document can be created for other document types. New documents will need to reference the recording information for the previously recorded document on the first page since it will not have a recording label/stamp so staff and auditors will know taxes were paid previously, if applicable and to allow for cross-referencing in the index.\n\nSignatures and acknowledgements\n\nIf the document that was recorded previously has not been altered since it was signed and recorded, there is no need for re-acknowledgment of the document. Examples of this include an exhibit, rider or plat clearly identified but omitted from the original recording, or pages or documents previously recorded out of sequence. Corrections to the notary acknowledgement would also be included since the notary section was not completed when the parties signed the document.\n\nIf the document has been altered in any way from when it was signed and recorded other than changes noted above, it will need to be signed again by the same parties in front of a notary and the new signature page(s) will be added to the end of the document for re-recording.\n\nCorrection of Obvious Description Errors by Affidavit - § 55.1-609\n\nThere is an option in the Code of Virginia to correct \"obvious description errors\" by affidavit for certain documents. See § 55.1-609 for more information. This may be an option if the original parties cannot sign a new document for any reason but please note the requirements under subsections C & D. Optional format for form is provided in subsection H.\n\nThere are various types of property/deed fraud. While there have been a handful of cases across the Commonwealth of Virginia in recent years, our office is not aware of any fraudulent deeds that have been recorded in our locality.\n\nPursuant to the Code of Virginia, upon payment of the proper fees and taxes, clerk’s offices must accept and record any document that conforms to legal requirements and is authorized by law to be recorded in the deed books. In the case of a deed, the clerk's office will typically ensure that the deed is properly acknowledged by a notary and is compliant with recording requirements set forth by law. The clerk's office is not responsible for verifying the validity, authenticity, or legitimacy of the document that is recorded. If the document meets recording requirements, and the proper fees are submitted, our office is obligated to and will record the document.\n\nMost fraudsters target properties that are not owner occupied. There are two victims that are immediately impacted when these fraudulent transactions occur: the unsuspecting buyer and the legitimate property owner.\n\nBuyers Beware: Is It Too Good to be True? Ask Questions!\n\nIf it sounds too good to be true, it very well might be! Ask questions if:\n\n■ The property is a vacant lot or occupied by someone other than the actual owner, such as investment property, vacation property or rental property\n\n■ The property is for sale below market value\n\n■ The seller wants a quick sale, generally in less than three weeks, and may not negotiate fees\n\n■ The seller will only communicate by phone or email and won’t meet in person\n\n■ When buying a property, ask a title professional or real estate attorney about your title insurance coverage options\n\nOwners\n\nYou can search our indexes for free anytime you want to check for new records in your name. Our indexes are free to search using our Secure Remote Access or on the Public Access stations in our office. While the online indexes are free to use, a subscription is required to view images online or you can visit our office to view for no charge but any copies made will be 50¢ a page.\n\nThink You’re a Victim of Deed Fraud?\n\nDon’t delay, contact local and state law enforcement immediately, including the Attorney General of Virginia. Additionally, contact your title professional, real estate attorney and/or title insurance policy underwriter."
