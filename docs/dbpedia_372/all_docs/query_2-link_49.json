        "text": "The paper aims at deepening the interpretation of the relationship between the traces of ancient and modern cults in Sorrento-Amalfi Peninsula through the comprehension of tangible and intangible values retained in the pilgrimages routes. It also intends to identify overlaps and contrasts in the stratifications of the landscape along those itineraries in order to define adequate guide-lines for the conservation of this cultural system. Taking into account the evolution of the religion from pagan to Christian cult and the consequent adaptation of places and structures of worship in order to satisfy renewed needs, in this context, despite the overlap of several material and immaterial stratifications, it is possible to identify the persistence of traditions and uses. Through the simultaneous interpretation of ancient and modern traces of spirituality, identified by comparing archival sources and on-site analyses, it could be defined a sort of religious syncretism that characterizes these places and connects rituals of the past to contemporary ones. In contrast to the primitive cult of the Sirens – mythical creatures described by Homer in the Odyssey – only recalled by literary resources, the ancient cults dedicated to Athena and to Apollo appear to be testified by material evidences. In both cases, the sources refer to the presence of temple structures built to honor the two divinities: the temple of Athena stood on the Punta Campanella where today rises a 16th century tower; the cult (and temple?) of Apollo, instead, according to controversial sources, was in correspondence of the actual ruins of the Abbey of Saint Peter in Crapolla – deep gorge on the southern side of the Sorrento-Amalfi Peninsula –, which would be probably built reusing the spolia of the previous temple structure. Both two ancient places of worship where connected to the inland with paths which were used during centuries by pilgrims to reach them. These ‘pilgrimages’ routes retain still today their spiritual vocation: in the first case, despite the absence of the temple of Athena on the point of the promontory, there is the via Minervia that, conserving its most wild and fascinating character in an atmosphere of magic charm, as well as, a part of its ancient pavings, recalls the solemnity of the place of worship. In the second case, instead, the continuity in the religious use of routes and structures is more evident: here, in fact, the construction of the Abbey of Saint Peter and, then, of the twentieth-century little chapel, receive the cultural, spiritual and material inheritance of the place; in addiction, the processions in honor of the Saint, repeated every year on 29th of June, appear to be a revival of the ancient sacred legations to the god Apollo. Finally, the modern processions to the chapel of Saint Costanzo located on the homonymous Mont (14th of May), which go through the same itinerary that, during ancient times, was used by pilgrims directed to the temple of Athena, also testifies how the spiritual vocation of this route is still alive today. The study clarifies, as a result, how the landscape of the Sorrento-Amalfi Peninsula represents an example of a stratified palimpsest of architecture and nature in which all the components - archaeological, environmental, rural, historical or anthropic - take a well-defined role in the characterization of the whole. The overlap between preexistence and transformation testifies the continuity of the uses which have marked this territory since ancient times: the complexity and multiplicity of these latter and of the imprints left by them make appropriate for these sites the definition of “cultural landscape”. In a system like this, where each aspect affects the other, and, at the same time, is influenced by them, the communication routes, as in the ancient forms, as in their modern stratifications, constitute a connective tissue that, while joins and links each element, represents a fundamental component of the whole. Within the ancient road infrastructure the ‘sacred’ routes assume a role of great importance: they, in fact, testify the remarkable religious tension that has characterized these places since ancient times, and the continuity in their ‘spiritual’ use until the present day."
