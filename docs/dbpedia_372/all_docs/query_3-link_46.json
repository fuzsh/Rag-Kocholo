Real property can have a sole owner. Real property can also have multiple owners. The owner may be a person, but the owners can also be a company, a trust, or other entity. A property can be owned by a combination of people and entities. There is no real limit on the number of people or entities that can own a specific piece of real property.\n\nThis article focuses on ownership of real property in Maryland by multiple owners, often referred to as “joint ownership” or “concurrent ownership.” It is very important to know where the real property is located because different states have different laws about how multiple owners can own real property.\n\nIn Maryland, joint owners have three options for owning or “holding title” to real property. The laws related to joint ownership of real property in Maryland is primarily governed by case law, which is the law found in judges’ opinions. It is very important to understand the differences between the three options because each option has different rights and obligations for the joint owners.\n\nKey Terms\n\nA “deed” is a legal document that shows the ownership of real property and is recorded with the Land Records Department in Maryland.\n\n“Holding title” to real property is a legal way of saying you own that real property.\n\n“Presumption” means that a court is allowed to assume something to be true unless there is evidence that disproves or outweighs the presumption. The burden is the party arguing against the presumption to provide this evidence to disprove or outweigh the presumption.\n\n“Right of survivorship” means that a surviving co-owner can take ownership of the deceased co-owner's share of the property.\n\n“Undivided interest” means that each owner has an equal right to use and enjoy the entire property. However, no individual has an exclusive right to any specific part of the property.\n\nTenancy in Common\n\nTenancy in Common is a form of joint ownership of real property with two or more owners called “tenants in common.” Each co-owner or tenant in common owns a specific share or percentage of the property. Tenants in common can have equal shares, but they can also hold title in unequal shares. For example, you may have property held by two owners where one owner has a 75% share and the other owner has a 25% share. However, tenants in common still have an undivided interest in the property, meaning that they have the right to use and enjoy the entire property.\n\nThere is no right of survivorship. If an owner dies, that owner’s interests pass on to his or her heirs. A tenant in common can transfer their property interest via a will. If the tenant in common dies without a will (intestate) then Maryland’s intestacy laws would apply to that tenant in common’s share of the property.\n\nJoint Tenancy\n\nJoint tenancy is a form of joint ownership of real property with two or more owners called “joint tenants.” The joint tenants have an undivided interest in the real property and the right of survivorship. While it is common for joint tenants to be spouses or parent and child, there is no requirement that the parties be married or related. Each owner has an equal, undivided interest in the real property.\n\nJoint tenancy includes rights of survivorship. When one joint tenant dies, that joint tenant’s undivided interest in the real property automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant or tenants. Generally speaking, property with a right of survivorship is excluded from a deceased person’s estate, so it is not subject to a will. However, there can be exceptions to this general rule. So if you’re in this situation, it’s a good idea to talk to an attorney.\n\nTo create a joint tenancy under Maryland law, the language in the deed must be very clear that the parties intend to create a joint tenancy because Maryland has a presumption against joint tenancy. This means that documents, such as deeds, must expressly provide that the real property is to be owned as a joint tenancy for it to be legally recognized as such. Therefore, if purchasing real property with the intent of joint tenant ownership, explicit language indicating that intent is necessary. In the absence of this language, ownership will be assumed to be a tenancy in common.\n\nCreation and maintenance of a joint tenancy also requires “four unities of interest” to be present. These “four unities” are four legal requirements related to the property that involve unified rights in terms of time, title, interest, and possession for all joint tenants.\n\nUnity of Time – all owners’ interests must have vested at the same time (“vested ownership” means that the unconditional ownership of the property for all owners was completed at the same time)\n\nUnity of Title – all owners’ interests must be acquired from the same deed\n\nUnity of Interest – all owners have equal interests in the property\n\nUnity of Possession – all owners have equal and concurrent rights to possess the property\n\nTenancy by the Entirety\n\nTenancy by the entirety is the third option for joint ownership of real property in Maryland. Unlike joint tenancy and tenancy in common, tenancy by the entirety is only available to a married couple.\n\nEach spouse owns an undivided interest in the real property, and there is a right of survivorship. Maryland has a presumption that property held by a married couple is held as tenants by the entireties. The presumption applies to property acquired by the married couple. Tenancy by the entirety requires the presence of the four unities of interest described above.\n\nDivorce of the owners will convert a tenancy by the entirety to a tenancy in common.\n\nDetermining the Ownership that's Best for You\n\nDetermining the ownership that’s best for you will really depend on the specific situation of you and your co-owners. Sometimes, the decision is out of your control. For example, you may have inherited a share of a property held by multiple owners in a tenancy in common. However, you may want to consider the questions below when making your choices."
