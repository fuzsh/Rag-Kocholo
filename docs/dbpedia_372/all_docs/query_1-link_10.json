        "text": "The annual average CO2 difference between baseline data from Mauna Loa and the Southern Hemisphere increased by ∼ 0.8 µmol mol−1 (0.8 ppm) between 2009 and 2010, a step unprecedented in over 50 years of reliable data. We find no evidence for coinciding, sufficiently large source and sink changes. A statistical anomaly is unlikely due to the highly systematic nature of the variation in observations. An explanation for the step, and the subsequent 5-year stability in this north–south difference, involves interhemispheric atmospheric exchange variation. The selected data describing this episode provide a critical test for studies that employ atmospheric transport models to interpret global carbon budgets and inform management of anthropogenic emissions.\n\nThe extreme El Niño of 2015 and 2016 coincided with record global warming and unprecedented strength of the Hadley circulation with significant impact on mean interhemispheric (IH) transport of CO2 and on the difference in CO2 concentration between Mauna Loa and Cape Grim (Cmlo-cgo). The relative roles of eddy transport and mean advective transport on IH CO2 annual differences from 1992 through to 2016 is explored. Eddy transport processes occur mainly in boreal winter-spring when Cmlo-cgo is large; an important component is due to Rossby wave generation by the Himalayas and propagation through the equatorial Pacific westerly duct generating and transmitting turbulent kinetic energy. Mean transport occurs mainly in boreal summer-autumn and varies with the strength of the Hadley circulation. The timing of annual changes in Cmlo-cgo is found to coincide well with dynamical indices that we introduce to characterize the transports. During the unrivalled 2009–2010 step in Cmlo-cgo indices of eddy and mean transport reinforce. In contrast for the 2015 to 2016 change in Cmlo-cgo the mean transport counteracts the eddy transport and the record strength of the Hadley circulation determines the annual IH CO2 difference. The interaction of increasing global warming and extreme El Niños may have important implications for altering the balance between eddy and mean IH CO2 transfer.\n\nThe extreme El Niño of 2015 and 2016 coincided with record global warming and unprecedented strength of the Hadley circulation with significant impact on mean interhemispheric (IH) transport of CO2. The relative roles of eddy transport and mean advective transport on interannual differences in CO2 concentration between Mauna Loa and Cape Grim (Cmlo − cgo), from 1992 through to 2016, are explored. Eddy transport processes occur mainly in boreal winter–spring when Cmlo − cgo is large; an important component is due to Rossby wave generation by the Himalayas and propagation through the equatorial Pacific westerly duct generating and transmitting turbulent kinetic energy. Mean transport occurs mainly in boreal summer–autumn and varies with the strength of the Hadley circulation. The timing of annual changes in Cmlo − cgo is found to coincide well with dynamical indices that we introduce to characterize the transport. During the unrivalled 2009–2010 step in Cmlo − cgo, the effects of the eddy and mean transport were reinforced. In contrast, for the 2015 to 2016 change in Cmlo − cgo, the mean transport counteracts the eddy transport and the record strength of the Hadley circulation determines the annual IH CO2 difference. The interaction of increasing global warming and extreme El Niños may have important implications for altering the balance between eddy and mean IH CO2 transfer. The effects of interannual changes in mean and eddy transport on interhemispheric gradients in other trace gases are also examined.\n\nThe CO 2 measured in baseline air collected over three decades from six Southern Hemisphere sites spanning 70° of latitude uniformly indicate an 11 PgC anomaly between 2010 and 2015. The anomaly, in annually averaged residuals from the smooth increase due to the cumulative total of long lived anthropogenic emissions, exceeds uptake expected from modelled sinks. It also departs from long term lagged correlations with ENSO indices. Air-surface exchange is of insufficient magnitude, abruptness, and persistence to explain the anomaly. Overestimation in the 3–4 PgC year − 1 interhemispheric flux of fossil emissions is implied. The anomaly trails the GFC, whose impact is complicated by anomalous within-NH and interhemispheric mixing. Resumption of atmospheric behaviour more consistent with emission estimates coincides with improved national emissions accounting at COP21. There is relevance to top-down air-surface flux estimates, for example, recent conflicting transport model estimates of Chinese emission trends or El Niño induced emissions.\n\nWe present estimates of the surface sources and sinks of CO2 for 1992–2005 deduced from atmospheric inversions. We use atmospheric CO2 records from 67 sites and 10 δ13CO2 records. We use two atmospheric models to increase the robustness of the results. The results suggest that interannual variability is dominated by the tropical land. Statistically significant variability in the tropical Pacific supports recent ocean modeling studies in that region. The northern land also shows significant variability. In particular, there is a large positive anomaly in 2003 in north Asia, which we associate with anomalous biomass burning. Results using δ13CO2 and CO2 are statistically consistent with those using only CO2, suggesting that it is valid to use both types of data together. An objective analysis of residuals suggests that our treatment of uncertainties in CO2 is conservative, while those for δ13CO2 are optimistic, highlighting problems in our simple isotope model. Finally, δ13CO2 measurements offer a good constraint to nearby land regions, suggesting an ongoing value in these measurements for studies of interannual variability."
