        "text": "How the mighty have fallen.\n\nFor two years through summer ‘ 94, Venezuelan broadcaster RCTV was crushing rival Venevision in the ratings, thanks largely to its reality-based novela “Por Estas Calles” (In These Streets). But the tables have turned completely.\n\nFor more than a year now, Venevision has been leagues ahead – and RCTV is going through a shake-up to redress the balance.\n\nLast month, RCTV retired long-serving general director Armando Enrique Guia, whose responsibilities were assumed by CEO Marcel Granier, and reshuffled other execs.\n\nThe network now will up its novela slate from six to 10 per year, says Eduardo Sapene, who replaced Tony Fadel as director of programming. RCTV’s programming budget will increase by 37%, while production coin will climb 40%-45%, Sapene adds.\n\nThe exec attributes RCTV’s problems to Venezuela’s three-year recession, a loss of stars and writers – many of them poached by Venevision – and a lack of “vitality” in management. Other insiders add that the company bet too heavily on “Por Estas Calles.”\n\nWhen the soap finished its unusually long two-year run in July 1994, creative energies at RCTV had run low, and in the following month the web dropped seven points in audience share to 36%, according to ratings firm AGB Panamericana.\n\nSince then Venevision has boomed, increasing its audience share from 47% in August 1994 to 62% in August this year, according to AGB. Other ratings agencies also have recorded a shift in supremacy, though with a lesser gap between the two nets. “We plan to broadcast more Venezuelan-made soaps and rationalize expenditure on foreign program imports. In the past we tended to buy anything foreign just because it was foreign,” Sapene says.\n\nHe intends to slate more informative programming and cut back on U.S. series. “Baywatch,” for example, is being replaced by a local docu. RCTV, and its Miami-based export arm Coral Pictures, have in fact engaged in an efficiency drive for most of this year, Coral’s director of ops, Jose Escalante says. “At Coral we’re shooting for a 35% cut in costs this year,” Escalante says.\n\nCoral is independently estimated to bring in $25 million-$30 million per year in novela sales. RCTV’s corporate parent Empresas 1-BC also has streamlined personnel at the station and closed down loss-making paper El Diario, which had been kept afloat by funding from the TV net, sources say.\n\n“RCTV needs money,” a Caracas ad exec says, adding that the web’s poor performance may prove a major liability during the fast-appraoching up-front ad sale season.\n\nAndrew Paxman in Miami contributed to this report."
