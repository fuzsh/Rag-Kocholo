        "text": "According to CNN International, Hugo Ch?vez has declared war on yet another facet of Venezuelan life: Venezuela's most-watched television station -- and outlet for the political opposition -- went off the air after the government refused to renew its broadcast license. Radio Caracas Television (RCTV), which has been broadcasting for 53 years, was replaced by a state-run station -- TVes -- on Monday. The new station's logo began running immediately after RCTV went off the air. Leading up to the deadline, police on Sunday used water cannons and what appeared to be tear gas to break up thousands of demonstrators protesting the government's decision to close the country's most-watched television station. The protest began in front of National Telecommunications Commission headquarters after members of the National Guard seized broadcast equipment, including antennas, the result of a Supreme Court order on Friday.... Inside the studios of Radio Caracas Television, employees cried and chanted \"Freedom!\" on camera, AP reported. \"We are living an injustice,\" presenter Eyla Adrian said, according to AP. \"I wish that tonight would never come.\" President Hugo Chavez announced in January that the government would not renew the broadcast license for the station, long an outlet for opposition parties. Chavez has accused the station of supporting the failed 2002 coup against him and violating broadcast laws. He called the station's soap operas \"pure poison\" that promote capitalism, according to AP. RCTV, which has been broadcasting for 53 years, is slated to be off the air at midnight. It will be replaced by a state-run station. \"To refuse to grant a new license for the most popular and oldest television channel in the country because the government disagrees with the editorial or political views of this channel, which are obviously critical to Chavez, is a case of censorship,\" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch. \"We have arrived at totalitarianism,\" said Marcel Granier, president of Empresas 1BC, which owns RCTV. (emphasis added) In a war between Hugo Chavez and the telenovela, I'll take the telenovela every day of the week and twice on Sundays. Never mess with an art form that is capable of producing the likes of Salma Hayek. In the Guardian, Ben Whitford goes to town on Ch?vez 's decision: Ch?vez and his officials unilaterally branded the network coup-mongers and pornographers - the latter apparently a reference to the trashy but popular telenovelas that are standard fare on all the region's networks. No investigations, meetings or hearings were held to assess the station's failings; no evidence was presented, and the network was given no right of reply. It wasn't until this March, three months after announcing its decision to revoke the station's license, that the government deigned to release a \"White Book\" giving an official account of the station's transgressions. More polemic than policy paper, the book only serves to underscore the arbitrary and politicized nature of the government's decision; RCTV is accused of a raft of minor sins, from sensationalizing its coverage of a recent murder to showing alcohol consumption during its coverage of a baseball game. RCTV had never previously received more than a warning for these violations; other stations guilty of the same or worse errors have been allowed to retain their licenses. It's hard to see RCTV's closure - which was opposed by 70% of the Venezuelan people - as anything more than an act of political retaliation for the network's continuing, and increasingly isolated, resistance to the Ch?vez administration. While it's true that the country's media remains largely in private hands, most of the other opposition channels have allowed themselves to be cowed by Ch?vez's threats, and have substantially cut back their news and editorial coverage. Of the stations with national reach, only RCTV had remained an outspoken critic of the government; on Sunday night that voice, too, fell silent. (Claims that RCTV could stay on the air by switching to cable or satellite are disingenuous; even if the network survives, it will reach only a tiny fraction of its current audience.) In pulling the plug on RCTV, Ch?vez appointed himself judge, jury and executioner; and in doing so, struck a dangerous blow against Venezuela's proud traditions of democracy and free speech. Worryingly, he did so as part of a wider campaign to stifle dissenting voices and independent views. Since coming to power, Ch?vez has pushed through a barrage of regulations designed to breed a compliant and uncritical media sector; organizations now face swingeing fines and license suspensions if they fail to meet vague and arbitrary \"social responsibility\" criteria, while draconian defamation regulations and \"insult laws\" make it illegal to show disrespect for government officials and institutions.... A few minutes after RCTV flickered off the air, a new network took its place: Venezuelan Social Television. The new public channel, run by Ch?vez appointees, will provide news and entertainment that is more palatable to Ch?vez's government; it will join a growing portfolio of state-owned channels that one government station chief says is part of Ch?vez's wider plan for \"communication and information hegemony\". The failure of the likes of Tariq Ali and Colin Burgon to recognize this as a blow to Venezuela's tradition of free speech shouldn't surprise anyone; Ch?vez is a past master at playing the international left to his own ends. The truth, though, is that this is one occasion when people on both the left and the right, as supporters of liberal democracy, should be prepared to cry foul.\n\nAccording to CNN International, Hugo Ch?vez has declared war on yet another facet of Venezuelan life:\n\nVenezuela’s most-watched television station — and outlet for the political opposition — went off the air after the government refused to renew its broadcast license.
