        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe land records that are generally of most interest to genealogists are the land entry case files. These are records that document the transfer of public lands from the U.S. Government to private ownership.\n\nThere are over ten million such individual land transactions in the custody of the National Archives. These case files cover land entries in all 30 public land states.\n\nThe case files were filed as either military bounty land warrants, pre-1908 general land entry files, or as post-1908 land entry files. The information required to access and order copies of the records will differ depending on which of these 3 categories the transaction falls into.\n\nLearn how to access these records\n\nFor more background information and an overview of important terminology, review Research in the Land Entry Files of the General Land Office\n\nFor land records in the remaining 20 states that were never part of the original public domain, check the State Archives for that particular state. This includes the original 13 colonies, plus Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, and West Virginia.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Land Records\n\nRelated Land Records\n\nTract Books:\n\nThere are also tract books available relating to the land entry case files. These are arranged by the legal description of the land: by township, range, and section. Tract books are divided into two geographical areas, Eastern States and Western States.\n\nFor the Western States, the tract books are located in the National Archives Building in Washington, DC and some NARA Field Offices. This includes the states of: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.\n\nFor the Eastern States, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has the tract books and patents. This includes the states of: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin.\n\nFor these Eastern State tract books, contact:\n\nEastern States Office, Bureau of Land Management\n\nDepartment of the Interior\n\n20 M Street, Suite 950\n\nWashington, DC 20003\n\nLand Patents:\n\nLand patents are the legal documents that transferred land ownership from the U.S. Government to individuals. Now you can search for land patent records online, for both Eastern and Western states. See the Bureau of Land Management's Land Patent Search page.*\n\n*Please note that this includes only patented or completed land entries. Those case files that were cancelled or relinquished will not be there. Even though the entry was never patented there can be as much information in these case files as patented files. To start your search for these records please contact the National Archives facility that holds records for that state.\n\nHow Land Records Can Help You:\n\nThese records can be useful for historical, legal, and genealogical research, but are most basically transaction records: they form the foundation of the title chain of land ownership. Additional research is needed to identify subsequent title owners and should be conducted in city, county, and state repositories. Depending upon the type and time period of the land entry, the case file may yield only a few facts already known to the researcher or it may present new insights about ancestors, family history, title, and land use issues. For example, the records may attest to one's age, place of birth, citizenship, military service, literacy, and economic status, and may even include similar information about family members. But even the smallest case files can establish locations of land ownership or settlement and dates essential to utilize other resources at NARA, such as census, court, and military service and pension records.\n\nFor more information, see Research in the Land Entry Files of the General Land Office (Record Group 49)\n\nOther Select Topics in Land Records\n\nThe Homestead Act of 1862, Background\n\nSearch for Selected Land Records in the National Archives Catalog\n\nSee a Sample Homestead file (for Charles Ingalls)\n\nIndices for Land Records Held in Kansas City"
