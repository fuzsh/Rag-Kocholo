        "text": "Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) - 3/10 (low )\n\nIndices of multiple deprivation (IMD) is used to classify the relative deprivation (a measure of poverty) of the area. It considers the following domains:\n\nIncome Deprivation Domain - 5/10 (average )\n\nThe Income Deprivation Domain measures the percentage of people in the population who are experiencing poverty due to having a low income. It includes both those who are unemployed and those who are employed but earn very little (and who satisfy the respective means tests).\n\nEmployment Deprivation Domain - 2/10 (very low )\n\nThe Employment Deprivation Domain measures the proportion of the working-age population in an area involuntarily excluded from the labour market. This includes people who would like to work but are unable to do so due to unemployment, sickness or disability, or caring responsibilities.\n\nEducation, Skills and Training Domain - 3/10 (low )\n\nThe Education, Skills, and Training Deprivation Domain measures the lack of education and skills in a local area. It has two parts: one for children and young people, and one for adults. The part for children and young people looks at their school achievements ('flow'), while the part for adults looks at the number of adults without qualifications ('stock').\n\nHealth Deprivation and Disability Domain - 1/10 (very low )\n\nThe Health Deprivation and Disability Domain measures the risk of early death and poor quality of life due to bad physical or mental health. It looks at illness, disability, and early death, but not at behaviors or environments that might affect future health.\n\nLiving Environment Deprivation Domain - 2/10 (very low )\n\nThe Living Environment Deprivation Domain measures the quality of the local environment. It has two parts: the \"indoors\" part looks at housing quality, and the \"outdoors\" part looks at air quality and road traffic accidents.\n\nIncome Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) - 6/10 (average )\n\nThe Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index (IDACI) measures how many children aged 0 to 15 live in low-income families. It is part of the Income Deprivation Domain, which looks at how many people in an area have low incomes.
