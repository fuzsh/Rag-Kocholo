The school's mission is to foster a safe, happy, and stimulating environment based on the CORE values of community, opportunity, respect, and excellence. Younger students begin their journey at the South Site, where they enter in nursery or reception classes, before transitioning to the North Site at the end of Year 4.\n\nCastle Newnham prioritizes traditional values alongside forward-thinking approaches, aiming for bright futures for every learner. Principal Ruth Wilkes, along with governors and staff, work tirelessly to encourage positive attitudes, resilience, creativity, integrity, and kindness.\n\nThe school's education program includes the teaching of British Values, enabling pupils to understand and embrace the importance of democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty, mutual respect, and tolerance for those with different faiths and beliefs. Castle Newnham nurtures an environment where children are trusted to help shape the school's direction through aspects like the Junior Leadership Committee, which sees pupils from Year 1 to Year 6 elect representatives who help make crucial decisions on behalf of the school community.\n\nThe school celebrates diversity within its student population and curriculum, encouraging understanding and respect for various cultural and religious backgrounds. Castle Newnham fosters discussion around rules and the reasons behind them, teaching pupils about responsibilities, consequences, and the importance of laws. This approach is part of the school's commitment to developing its pupils' spiritual, moral, social, and cultural development."
