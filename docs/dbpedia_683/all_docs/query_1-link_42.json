Our non-surgical Ultrasonic Liposuction makes losing inches from areas of your body such as your belly, hips, arms, legs and back easy! Those stubborn fatty areas of your body you would like to change will become flatter and firmer, in as few as 12 sessions of completely painless Ultrasonic Liposuction. You will be massaged, twice a week with ultrasound by our qualified, experienced consultants, ensuring you are looking and feeling fabulous! We use Ultrasound technology similar to the kind used to carry out baby scans in hospitals, we even use the same gel. During the painless therapy all you will feel is a nice, warm sensation. This warm sensation is the fat turning to liquid and beginning to drain from your body. As the Ultrasound passes through the fat cells inside your body it causes them to vibrate against each other, this causes the fat inside to change from a semi-solid state and to become a liquid. Once liquefied, the fat will begin to drain from the cell. The fat then passes through the lymph node system and exits the body through the digestive system in the normal manner. The fat will continue to drain from the body for the next 72 hours. To maximise lymph drainage and achieve the best results we recommend increasing activity levels to increase blood circulation. Your consultant will chart your success and let you know exactly how many inches you have lost since your last session by measuring your target area before each treatment. We expect clients will need somewhere between 8 - 12 sessions per area to achieve their goals. You should allow 30 minutes per appointment and 3 days should be allowed between treatments. Couple take on 2000-mile rally to help heroes A HUSBAND and wife are taking part in a 2000-mile expedition in aid of an armed forces charity. Daniel and Melanie Nutt, both 35 of Walnut Tree, will set off on the 4x4 European Rally on June 15 to raise funds for Help for Heroes which provides support to wounded, injured and sick service personnel and their families. Mr Nutt said: “We found out about the rally when we went to the Top Gear Live event last month and went to the Help for Heroes stand. “They told us about the journey which tells the story of the Allied Invasion through Europe, visiting places like The Somme, Ypres and the ‘Market Garden’. “We were really interested in the history and it’s an opportunity to do something for a great cause. “At the moment the focus is on fundraising through our donation page and we are hoping to do some collections at supermarkets. “Everybody has been really sup¬ portive and our family have said that the rally is right up our street.” The gruelling rally goes through seven countries over 12 days and the couple will be driving their Land Rover Freelander, named Gus, which will be tagged so people can follow their progress. Mr Nutt said: “We know that he’ll pick up a few battle wounds along the way but there’s a good team of people to help us out. “Melanie will be the navigator because my sense of direction is terrible, I didn’t learn to drive until I was 27.” The event will start in North Wiltshire and will conclude in Bavaria, Germany. During the expedition the couple, who have been married for a year and a half, will tour numerous battle sites and cemeteries of the Second World War. Mr and Mrs Nutt are hoping to raise £5000.

One councillor, who believes the £2.2million project will now go hundreds of thousands of pounds over budget, is calling for an independent inquiry. The new Wolverton railway station building was officially opened by the mayor in June but since then the work has still not been finished, with the car park being worked on and part of the building still fenced off. It has been revealed that an internal investigation is set to take place at Milton Keynes Council into the delays and a possible overspend. But Wolverton ward councillor Peter Marland believes more should be done. “I would like the audit committee to look at it or someone independent who knows what they are talking about,” he said. “The station looks terrible, people don’t know it’s open - it’s just abysmal. “It’s an absolute shambles really. I still don’t have a date for completion.” Cllr Marland was set to attend an audit committee meeting last night to ask them to launch an investigation. Meanwhile Cllr John Bint, who is the cabinet member in charge of transport at the council, said there would be an internal inquiry. He offered apologies to residents and commuters who were suffering while work has continued at the site. Cllr Bint said that a range of issues had been encountered while work was being carried out. These related to the car park, the walls and the drainage on the site. Cllr Bint said: “We’ve decided to find a new contractor appropriate for the kind of issues that still need solving. “This is likely to take around three months. “The council should learn from a project that has not gone as well as we would have liked. We are looking to see what can be learned internally.” He added: “Apologies to the residents and passengers from Wolverton for whom the station is important, and I appreciate their continued patience. We are going to do this as quickly as we possibly can.” Cllr Marland has claimed the over¬ spend will be between £250,000- £500,000, and although Cllr Bint has admitted an overspend is ‘more than likely’ he would not speculate on the amount. With regards to any possible inde¬ pendent inquiries, Cllr Bint said he is “entirely open-minded” but wants to wait for all the facts of an internal investigation. 2 | November 7, 2012 | www.mkweb.co.uk | MKNEWS - ***niew*** Live online cash web booker TAXIS AND PRIVATE HIRE Eezy Cabs gives you fixed prices at time of booking online or by phone The ONLY COMPANY IN Milton Keynes to accept LIVE online bookings. *The ONLY company in Milton Keynes to accept in the vehicle Credit and Debit card payments.

The Parks Trust is hoping to catch the ‘thoughtless’ people who are responsible for several incidents of damage at Furzton Lake. Over the last few days there have been repeated attacks on park fencing and fires at the lake. The fence at the entrance to the car park off the V4 Watling Street was ripped down on Saturday, Sunday and Monday night. The wood has then been used for fires, which have taken place in the same spot each night and which have caused damaged to the grass and caused a danger to other people. Susi Jensen, a community ranger at The Parks Trust, said: “It’s really dis¬ appointing to see this thoughtless damage at Furzton Lake.” City leads the way on the road to recovery BY ANNA MAUREM00T00 anna.mauremootoo@mk-news.co.uk THE city is helping lead the way on the road to economic recov¬ ery, a new study has revealed. International financial ana¬ lysts Experian produced figures that show that Milton Keynes is heading a top ten of ‘prosperous’ towns and cities in terms of growth in jobs, retail sectors, manufacturing and financial and business services. Cllr David Hopkins, cabinet member for economy and growth, said: “Once again we have it confirmed that Milton Keynes is leading the way in job creation, innovation, and a sheer ‘can do’ attitude. “It’s no surprise, as we are in an excellent location with fantastic travel links to all parts of the country, we’re home to world beating companies and revered institutions such as the Open University and Red Bull Racing, and we have a skilled workforce and a growing population. “It all adds up to Milton Keynes being a unique and ambitious city, and it’s right that we’re being recognised as such.” The news comes hot on the heels of the revelation that Milton Keynes has been invited to bid in the second phase of the government’s City Deals initiative. This initiative sees central and local government working together to reach a series of unique deals which will help create jobs, support local busi¬ nesses, control budgets and improve local infrastructure. Bruno Rost, from Experian, said: “Our research identifies areas of the UK that will recover more quickly from the recession. “It is clear that Milton Keynes comes out very strongly, not just by leading the UK out of reces¬ sion but also by delivering robust sustainable growth over the next five years.” MKNEWSBRIEFS Fred Roche Gardens THE City Gardens in CMK will officially be renamed after Milton Keynes’ ‘founding father’ Fred Roche. As revealed by MK NEWS, discussions were taking place over renaming the gardens next to Christ the Cornerstone Church after the former general manager of MK Development Corporation. The plans have now been formalised and a ceremony will take place on Friday - 20 years to the day after his death. Hedge planting THE Conservation Volunteers will be planting hedgerows in Milton Keynes next Friday, November 16 from 10.30am- 3pm at Campion in Great Linford with Mark Lancaster MP.

MK EWS | www.mkweb.co.uk | November 7, 2012 | 3 Noisy neighbour fined £600 A NOISY neighbour has been fined £600 and ordered to pay £740 legal costs for playing loud music well into the early hours of the morning. Charles Creed, 22, of White Hill, Olney, appeared before city magistrates on Friday to admit a breach of a noise nuisance abatement notice. The court heard that a call was made to Milton Keynes Council’s out of hours’ environmental health service in the early hours of Wednesday, fune 27 at around 2am. The noise, which was the 'dominant sound’ for a radius of 70-metres, was monitored for 30 minutes at various locations nearby. Equipment capable of playing music was seized by warrant on fuly 4 including hi-fi gear, a TV and a PlayStation 3. Creed pleaded guilty to the offence at Milton Keynes Magistrates’ Court, where the forfeiture of the equipment was also confirmed. It will be held by the council for six months and then donated to charity. Scammed: Charlotte Jamme believed she was paying £2,300 to her new fabric supplier after being invoiced E-mail scammers take £2k in fraud BY ADAM GRINSELL adam.grinsell@mk-news.co.uk A BUSINESSWOMAN was duped out of more than £2,000 after falling victim to a worrying new e-mail scam. Mum-of-two Charlotte Jamme was so upset by the theft that she considered closing her handbag business where she is working 18-hour days to make it a success. Earlier this year Mrs Jamme was nominated for three prestig¬ ious business awards for her company Miatui, which was only founded last October. She says trading conditions have been tough during this last month and she can ill afford to lose the money. “It’s a small business, and although it’s not a massive amount of money to a big business, when cash flow is an issue it becomes a massive amount of money,” she said. Mrs Jamme had started work¬ ing with a new Asian fabric sup¬ plier when that company had their e-mails hacked. She started receiving messages and pro forma invoices that appeared to be from her supplier. To avoid detection the scammers even set up an e-mail account in Mrs Jamme’s name, and told the supply company to only contact that address. One message asked for pay¬ ment for an invoice to what appeared to be a Standard Chartered account in Hong Kong, into which Mrs Jamme paid US$3,700 - around £2,300. But after then speaking to her supplier over internet messaging service Skype, she realised the account was a scam. She immediately tried to stop the payment with her bank HSBC, but now, three weeks later, she has still not been able to recover her money. An HSBC spokesman said they have been in touch with Mrs Jamme and are hoping to reach a 'positive solution’ as soon as possible. Bus crashes into level crossing A BUS smashed through the barriers at a railway level crossing at the weekend. Police are investigating after the single-decker bus crashed through the barrier in the incident at around 1.30pm on Saturday. It happened at Bow Brickhill, on Brickhill Street, on a crossing which serves the Bletchley to Bedford line. Engineers from Network Rail, which looks after the country’s railway network, attended. A spokesman from the compa¬ ny said: “Once the debris was cleared, trains continued to run and were cautioned through the level crossing - this is when they travel at slower speeds. “Network Rail engineers were called as soon as the incident was reported and repairs to the barrier were completed just after midnight.” There were road closures in place until after midnight on Saturday when the engineers finished. One village resident said the traffic was in 'chaos’ following the incident. It is believed the bus was empty and there are no reports of any injuries.

After being taken in twice on emergency and spending several days at the hospital on each occasion, I would like to acknowledge the professional and caring treatment that I received.

Bernadette Rose Milton Keynes Life Plans for car parking permits not welcome SIR - It’s been five very happy years since my last rant about traffic lights, but now my anger has yet again made me put pen to paper. This time it is over the issue of parking permits. I live in Bradwell Common on Ibstone Avenue, a corner house that we chose eight years-ago. One of the reasons was that if we needed visitor parking for my family and three sons we would have plenty of room. At present we have room for two cars on the drive and we rarely park on the street. I also have a front garden that I want to keep for environmental reasons, which I feel more people should be encouraged to do. How are people going to do this when they are forced to park over any existing front gardens? I know that people will be say¬ ing, well don’t have so many cars, but in this day and age, with having to travel far and wide for jobs, that is not an option. As you can tell, I am opposed to this parking scheme - maybe being selfish as we have never had a problem with anyone parking outside our house. I am sorry for people that do, however why should we suffer? I have now received a letter telling me that they are delaying the implementation of the scheme in Conniburrow because of public opposition. Well how do you put foward any queries as I have phoned the required num¬ ber and left a message four times, leaving my name and number, but as yet I have not been contact¬ ed by anyone. I also feel that if you live nearer the shopping centre, you are going to suffer with parking. Why should people that live further away be punished? Maybe if the free parking spaces hadn’t been taken away and the red ones which are often left empty been made cheaper, park¬ ing problems in the residential areas wouldn’t be a problem. J Winterbottom Bradwell Common Consider all our views over Primark proposal SIR - A few Saturdays ago people with clipboards were operating in the shopping centre, collecting names of supporters of the pro¬ posed new Primark. My wife and I are of a certain age and our views were quite clearly not wanted, while younger people were being consulted in large numbers. We did get to speak to some of the clipboard folk, who declined to record our 'no thanks’ opinion and told us that they were collecting only supporters, not opposition. I have no idea what use may be made of the results of this survey, but presumably they will be pub¬ lished at some point and will of course show 100% support for the coming of Primark. I hope howev¬ er that the powers-that-be will keep in mind that everyone other than supporters was being excluded, while the survey itself seemed to be slanted entirely towards the more likely Primark users. I can’t see how the results can be of any value whatever. I have no issues with Primark in itself. But I could not support the sacrifice of most of our market, and some vital infrastructure, to enable it to come to CMK. Geoff Long Woughton Park Don’t be put oft by lukewarm reaction SIR - Congratulations to everyone involved with Campbell Park fire¬ works display. It was fantastic! However there was a lack of gratitude from the crowd. I feel sorry for those who put time, effort and money into creating this display. I hope they are not put off creating another event.

Between midnight on Wednesday, October 31 and midnight on Saturday, lead was taken from the roof of St Lawrence’s Church in London Road, Broughton Village. And the theft happened around the same time two other churches were hit. Between £10- £20,000 of metal was taken from St lames’ Church in Hanslope between midday on Saturday and 10.30am on Sunday, and Haversham Church in High Street in the village was struck between 8am Tuesday October 30 and 12.30pm on Thursday. After the damage at St Lawrence’s was discovered by neighbours, a group of eight volunteers quickly mobilised themselves to protect the histor- ically-precious landmark from the elements. The church is famed for its priceless medieval wall draw¬ ings, and if exposed to the elements these could have been damaged. Luckily, lead was taken from the roof of the chancery rather than the section of the building with the drawings, but the vol¬ unteers, who wish to remain anonymous, ensured their safe¬ ty by wrapping a tarpaulin over the exposed parts and drying out the inside. St Lawrence’s is cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust, which will have to foot the bill for the lead. Peter Aiers, south east director, said: “Leaving the roof open to the November weather could have caused unthinkable dam¬ age. “It could have potentially affecting the delicate medieval wall paintings within this Grade I listed church, which are of national importance.” Anyone with information about any of the thefts should call Thames Valley Police on 101.

MK EWS | www.mkweb.co.uk | November 7, 2012 | 7 Kids happy as club reopens A YOUTH club which was destroyed in an arson attack has reopened thanks to a helping hand from MK NEWS. Children were left in tears after a fire ripped through the Springfield Initiative, in Springfield Boulevard, in April. But the club has now been restored to its former glory and the facility was officially reopened on Monday. Youth worker Carlos Williams said: “It’s great that it has finally reopened because the kids have missed the club as it was so much a part of their lives.” In July MK NEWS nominated the club for Dulux’s Let’s Colour project, which offers a helping hand to groups and charities looking to have their local spaces transformed with colourful paint. The club’s bid was successful, speeding up the restoration process. Mr Williams added: “We’ve had to replace everything in the club so the paint offer was fantastic.” Benefit fraudster claimed £11,000 BY ANNA MAUREM00T00 anna.mauremootoo@mk-news.co.uk A FRAUDSTER who pocketed more than £11,000 in benefits while employed by nine differ¬ ent companies and receiving a student loan has been given a six week prison sentence, suspended for two years. Alan McIntyre, 31, of Selkirk Drive, Stantonbury, pleaded guilty to 16 counts of dishonestly failing to notify changes in his circumstances at Milton Keynes Magistrates’ Court on Friday. McIntyre was claiming Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit and Incapacity Benefit. He was ordered to pay back the overpayment of £11,025 as well as £534.40 in costs to Milton Keynes Council. He also has to undertake 180 hours Community Service. The prosecution was brought by the council’s Corporate Anti- Fraud Team. A spokesman said: “This was a clear case of dishonesty, where¬ by the perpetrator sought to defraud the public purse. “Despite the fact that the per¬ petrator would not be inter¬ viewed we were able to uncover the full extent of the fraud and bring the case to court. “We hope that this case sends out the message that if you claim benefits to which you aren’t enti¬ tled we will catch you and that you will end up in court.” The fraud came to light follow¬ ing a data match as a result of the National Fraud Initiative which indicated that McIntyre had not declared a student loan. The case was then jointly investigated with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) who obtained Statements of Employers from nine different organisations. At no time did McIntyre notify the council or the DWP of his student loan and various periods of employment.

Voter turnout at next Thursday’s election is expected to be as low as 18.5 per cent nationally and in our online poll, 71 per cent of readers say they won’t be voting. Reader Wendy Marfleet said on Twitter: “I would vote but so far not seen any information.” Mark Lancaster, MP for Milton Keynes North, said: “I am con¬ cerned that voter turn-out might be low. Everyone who can vote should take part in this election.” For more on this story visit www.mk-news.co.uk. City’s ‘blueprint’ progresses THE council is putting the final touches to its proposed schedule of main modi¬ fications to the Core Strategy - the key planning ‘blueprint’ for future development.

Proceeds from the single will be donated towards other homeless projects across Milton Keynes. Song: lain Stewart MP with residents who recorded the single Jailed fraudster told he must repay £77k BY ADAM GRINSELL adam.grinsell@mk-news.co.uk A FRAUDSTER who fiddled a company out of more than £100,000 has been ordered to repay more than £77,000. Mitesh Gorasia, of Champflower, Furzton, admit¬ ted ten counts of fraud and was sentenced to two years and three months in prison at Aylesbury Crown Court on September 3. He was further charged with three counts of fraud, which he also admitted, and was jailed for a further four months at the same court on Monday, October 29. Gorasia was employed as an assistant accountant at a com¬ pany between October 2009 and October 2011. He was promoted to reporting officer after falsely claiming he had passed his CIMA accountancy qualifications. The company carried out an internal investigation and dis¬ covered he had created a number of payment schedules using the name of suppliers, but the pay¬ ments were actually going into four different bank accounts all in his name. The total value of the fraud was £107,736.87. Gorasia was arrested in con¬ nection with the fraud but while on bail he worked for three com¬ panies having falsely stated he was a qualified accountant, resulting in the three further charges of fraud for which he was sentenced last Monday. Following the sentencing, a confiscation order was granted by the court requiring Gorasia to repay the company a total of £77,827.14 within the next four months. If he fails to do this, he will be required to serve an extra 22 months and still need to pay the money back.

MK EWS | www.mkweb.co.uk | November 7, 2012 | 9 250 people write town’s new book Facebook book: Ruth Edwards with a copy of I Grew up in Wolverton BY DAN PALMER_ dan.palmer@mk-news.co.uk MORE than 250 FACEBOOK users who shared memories of Wolverton have contributed to a unique new book about the town. I Grew up in Wolverton is a col¬ lection of stories which residents, from both the past and present, contributed on the social networking site. The 280-page creation has been described as ‘social history with style’ and it is thought that Facebook might not have been used in this manner before. More than 800 people have joined the town’s Facebook group since it was set up by Faye Lloyd in 2008, and the stories posted in it come from both young and old residents. Memories extend from the time when Wolverton was still a thriv¬ ing railway town through to the present day which sees it on the northern edge of Milton Keynes. In January, Bryan Dunleavy, who has written about Wolverton’s history in the past, saw the potential in the Facebook messages. He enlisted the help of Ruth Edwards, who raised her family in the town, to compile the stories together. Mr Dunleavy said: “The book is very readable and contains many humorous exchanges as well as a wealth of detail about daily life in Wolverton. It is social history with style. “We consider it a remarkable and even pioneering book which may be the first to harness the new social media in this way. “The power of the internet has brought together ex-Wolverton people from many parts of the UK and Europe and from North America and Australia. “More than 250 people have contributed to this book.” Mrs Edwards added: “This is my first venture into anything like this. “I’m thrilled to bits with it and I think people will enjoy seeing their names in print.” The book will be officially launched on November 17 at the Age UK Bookshop in Wolverton, when Ruth will be signing copies between 10am and 12 noon. 50% SALE * titxNts #W& Taylors Sell houses.

Usually in Newport Pagnell for Remembrance ceremonies at the town’s memorial, the MP for Milton Keynes North, who is a member of the Territorial Army, will this year be laying a wreath at the memorial in Port Stanley in the small British-ruled islands. Britain traditionally sends a Minister to repre¬ sent the Government each year to the Falklands, off the coast of Argentina in the South Atlantic Ocean. This year Mr Lancaster has been selected because of his junior minister role in the Ministry of Defence and his continuing service as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Reserve Forces. This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War which fol¬ lowed the Argentine inva¬ sion of the islands, and it is expected that more than 50 veterans will be flying to the islands as part of the commemorations. Mr Lancaster said: “I would normally never miss Remembrance Sunday in Newport Pagnell but I am deeply honoured to be asked to represent the Government in the Falklands. “Given the significance of the commemorations this year I think it is absolutely the right thing to do and sends a clear message to the islanders as to the strength of support they have here in the UK.” Mr Lancaster will be attending ceremonies at Port Stanley, the islands’ capital, Goose Green, the site of one of the major bat¬ tles of the war, as well as a service of Remembrance at Stanley Cathedral during his five-day trip.

MK EWS | www.mkweb.co.uk | November 7, 2012 | 13 Gritty resolve to keep MK moving BY ADAM GRINSELL_ adam.grinsell@mk-news.co.uk WITH the freezing weather fast approaching the city’s gritters are ready and raring to go - but not in all conditions. After one of the heaviest snow¬ falls in recorded history in 2010, Milton Keynes Council was criti¬ cised for not doing enough to keep the city’s traffic moving. Almost two years later, the council’s grit store in Bleak Hall is nearly full to its 3,500-tonne capacity and the truck drivers are readying themselves for any cold snaps. But the man in charge of the gritting operation has warned that, although they will do eve¬ rything possible to keep roads flowing, at the end of the day we are still in the hands of Mother Nature. Highways operations manager Mark Bowater said: “If you have temperatures that don’t get above freezing during the day, the grit doesn’t work because the road just freezes. “All we can do then is keep going, putting it down, and keep ploughing as much as we can. “The more you put down on the roads the more chance it has of True grit: Mark Bowater with the mountain of winter grit in storage working, but conversely the more it snows the more it washes away. “If the temperatures start to come up, we will win, but if the temperature stays down we will lose.” Currently deliveries of grit are coming into the city about six times a day, with around 30 tonnes on each load. The store in Bleak Hall can hold a total of 3,500 tonnes, and last week it was up to just over 3,000. And, if the weather gets as bad as two years ago, it will certainly be needed. “On a normal run we use 50 tonnes, covering about 550 miles of road,” Mr Bowater added. “But when the weather’s bad we can go up to using about 3-400 tonnes a day - it just flies out of the door. “And each salt bin holds half a tonne of grit, which should do around seven miles of road.” If you want to find out more about gritting, including what type of grit is used, see our video on www.mk-news.co.uk.

The special edition Monopoly game was developed from a unique original board in the Bletchley Park Museum. It was hand-drawn by William Newman, son of Turing’s mentor Max, more than 60 years ago. William Newman yesterday visited Bletchley Park along with Alan Turing’s nephew Sir John Dermot Turing to sign one of the boards for the Bletchley Park Trust to auction. The board’s rarity value is soaring as it has proved hugely popular since its exclusive launch in September. Nearly all of the initial run of 2,000 boards have been sold already, and now staff and volunteers are rolling up their sleeves to pack them all. The first 1,000 Monopoly units were bought by Google and donated to the trust to help with the ongoing fundraising to restore iconic Codebreaking Huts and Blocks, many of which have fallen into dereliction. The trust is in a race against time to restore Hut 11a, which was purpose-built to house Bombe machines, and is aiming to raise the £250,000 needed to restore it in time for the opening of newly refurbished historic buildings in 2014. Last month the trust finally unlocked £5million in Heritage Lottery Funding to add to the £2.4million match funding already raised.

Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service will be joining Royal Berkshire and Oxfordshire in a Thames Valley col¬ laboration despite originally planning to merge with Cambridgeshire. This ‘change in direction’ was decided at a special meeting of Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes Fire Authority last Wednesday. Vice-Chairman and control room pro¬ ject spokesman, Councillor Andy Dransfield, said: “It became apparent that the date of the proposed changeo¬ ver to Cambridgeshire, who were already involved in an innovative and complex integration with Suffolk, was slipping from April 2013 towards 2014 for a number of valid reasons. “Coupled with the fact that we could not agree on cost-sharing and govern¬ ance arrangements, we tasked our Chief Fire Officer with seeking other possible ways of securing a long-term deal which would best serve the people of Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes.” The new centralised control room will be based in Calcot, near Reading, and there will be a second, unstaffed, con¬ trol room in Kidlington, Oxfordshire. An injection of £1.8 million in Government funding means Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes Fire Authority will not have to draw on financial reserves to deliver this new project which is expected to start in 2014. Chief Fire Officer Mark Jones said: “When Buckinghamshire and Milton Keynes Fire Authority chose its pre¬ ferred provider last year there were few known facts about the potential for a Thames Valley collaboration. “Last year the Cambridgeshire alli¬ ance was favoured over Royal Berkshire and Oxfordshire on the basis that the costs capability and time frame of the Thames Valley venture were not known. Since then this programme has matured and it has now become a more favourable option. “Thankfully, there has been minimal wasted effort and cost because most of the work done so far was required in any case. However, we were approaching the point at which costs might have been incurred. “For our staff, the date has moved but little else changes, and I know they will continue to deliver good services to those in need and for the public. As with any such change, it is our intention that they wiR notice no difference other than reduced costs and a modernised system for handling calls for help.” Under threat: Rob Rieke, Head of Operations at The Parks Trust, next to some of the city’s ash trees in Linford Wood - one of the historic woodlands in Milton Keynes which the charity are particularly concerned about Bid to protect city woodland THE public is being asked to help stop the spread of a deadly fungus threatening to wipe out our ash trees. So far there have been no cases of ash dieback disease in Milton Keynes and The Parks Trust - custodians of most of the land¬ scape in the city - are taking precautions to try and make sure this remains the case. Currently the nearest known case of the devastating disease - caused by a fungus called Chalara fraxinea - is in mature woodland in Cambridge. Information packs have been put on the Trust’s website show¬ ing how to identify the disease. Rob Rieke, Head of Operations at The Parks Trust said: “We’re looking at what other measures we might put in place if the dis¬ ease really does take hold in the UK to protect our ash stock because ash trees are such an important part of the landscape in Milton Keynes. “It’s difficult to say what other precautions might be taken fur¬ ther on, I don’t want to start talk about panic felling measures but if trees do become diseased you do have to deal with those indi¬ vidual trees and probably the destruction of those trees will have to take place. “We might have to bring in measures such as disinfectant. We might ask people who visit other woodlands in other parts of the country not to wear the same footwear in our woods.” A ban on the import of ash trees has been imposed in a bid to tackle the spread of the dis¬ ease which threatens to wipe out 80 million British trees.

On Wednesday, October 24 MK NEWS reported that some were worried over what they saw as an ‘underspend’ of around £lmillion in the adult social care sector at Milton Keynes Council, con¬ sidering there is a growing population of old people. And at a council meeting last Wednesday night, Labour councillor Nigel Long pro¬ posed ring-fencing any surplus to ensure it was spent on elderly care next year. But Conservative Cllr Debbie Brock, who is in charge of that sector, suggest¬ ed councillors ‘need to calm down about this’. At the meeting, she said: “The ‘underspend’ is actually a forecast, not an actual position. “There are future demands that have been budgeted for.” And colleague Edith Bald, in charge of finance, agreed. She said: “We are only half way through the budget year now, and demands can fluc¬ tuate through the year so they are hard to predict. “The overall forecast for March 2013 will change. “Therefore we need to say the underspend at the end of the budget year should be ring-fenced, and we will fully commit to that.” Recent figures show the city will face a 40 per cent increase in people aged over 75 in the next five years. And this is why Cllr Long, in his role as the chairman of the health and adult social care select committee, was keen to safeguard services for the elderly. He told MK NEWS: “I want to make sure that this money doesn’t go towards things such as road repairs but is put back into adult social care and health services.” As a result of the meeting, the councillors unanimously voted in favour of ring-fenc¬ ing the underspend at the end of the financial year.

To mark the day Milton Keynes’ Poet Laureate, Mark Niel, has chosen to honour Bletchley Park Veterans with a poem written for Remembrance Sunday. He said: “You’d pass most of Memorial: Service at Bletchley these people in the street with¬ out a thought as to what role they might have played in our coun¬ try’s past. I think it is important to value older generations and learn from their experiences.” Mark was inspired by meeting those who worked at Bletchley Park’s famous Station X when he was invited to read a poem at this year’s Enigma Reunion memorial service. The event had a lasting effect on him. He added: “Standing next to the unsung heroes of Bletchley Park was a very moving experience, especially during the minute’s silence. “These were the men and women who quietly went about important work and their contri¬ bution in shortening the war and saving many lives is only now being fully recognised. As I contemplated a poem for Armistice Day this year, those feelings of pride and gratitude stayed with me and I knew I had to write about it.” The Mayor of Milton Keynes, Councillor Catriona Morris, will be attending services in Bletchley and Stony Stratford. She said: “Milton Keynes has many local centres with memorials where dignitaries, veterans, serving soldiers and ordinary people alike will meet to pay their respects. “I would encourage everyone to wear a poppy with pride to hon¬ our and support the brave men, women and their families who have made sacrifices to defend the freedoms we all enjoy.” If you wish to pay your respects, below is a guide to some of the events taking place in Milton Keynes this Sunday. Bletchley Park, 10.30am A parade will leave Bletchley Park and go to Bletchley War Memorial for the service at 11am followed by a church service inside St Mary’s church at 11.20am. Horsefair Green, Stony Stratford, 3pm Organised by the MK Lions and attended by the Mayor of Milton Keynes, Catriona Morris, a cere¬ mony at the War Memorial fol¬ lows a parade through the town.

Currently there are six ambu¬ lances specifically for non-emer¬ gency journeys, which pick up patients who have hospital appointments and cannot get around very easily. The service also has nine volunteer drivers based in Milton Keynes, but it has now launched a campaign to find more and take the burden off the non-emergency ambulances. Many patients from Bucks and Northants may need to visit specialist units in Oxfordshire, such as spinal injury wards, which means a lot of the journeys will be across county borders. Anna Clarkson, customer care manager for patient transport, said: “We can do anything up to 1,000 patient journeys a day from Buckinghamshire across to Oxfordshire. “We do long distance journeys as well, so if someone further afield needs to access the servic¬ es in the areas we cover, we will Recruitment drive: Anna Clarkson is hoping to find more volunteer car drivers like Barry Pedder to help transport non-emergency patients go and get them. “There aren’t enough drivers, so we have launched this cam¬ paign to help us find more.” Barry Pedder, from Emberton, is a current volunteer driver. He said: “I do this because I find it enjoyable, you are putting something back into society and giving something back to people. “Most people that are involved do love it, and it really is an eye opener - it just gives you an out¬ look on life that you would never have working in an office.” Volunteer drivers use their own cars for the job, and although it is voluntary, expenses are paid at 45p per mile. The work would mainly suit retired people as the workload can be changeable, but for those who are working and want to help there is a possibility of fitting it around your job. If you are interested, contact Anna on anna.clarkson@scas. nhs.uk or call her on 07989 497504 for further information about the scheme.

MK EWS | www.mkweb.co.uk | November 7, 2012 | 25 Wartime pigeon’s secret message BY ANNA MAUREM00T00 anna.mauremootoo@mk-news.co.uk THE remains of a World War Two homing pigeon - thought to be carrying a top secret message for Bletchley Park - have been found in a chimney. When the bird was discovered by David Martin in his home in Bletchingley, Surrey, it had a small red cylinder attached to its foot which contained a coded message. Curator of Bletchley Park’s ‘Pigeons at War’ exhibition, Colin Hill, believes the bird probably either got lost, disorien¬ tated or was simply exhausted. Historians think the mystery feathered friend was dispatched from Nazi-occupied France amid the D-Day landings during which homing pigeons were released by Allied Forces to inform military top brass on English soil how operations were progressing. But unlike messages carried by other pigeons during Churchill’s radio blackout, this one was written in code. Mr Hill said: “I’m sure it was destined for Bletchley Park. “I’ve got loads of messages and they’re all in longhand, this is the only one I’ve ever seen that is coded and nobody else in the pigeon world has seen one quite like it.” The message is deemed so sen¬ sitive that codebreakers at GCHQ in Cheltenham are now franti¬ cally trying to decipher it using World War Two log books and Mr Hill’s help. He said: “At the moment GCHQ are the only ones who have got the time and the resources to break the code. I don’t think that Bletchley could do it now but somewhere along the line we will get it broken if possible. “GCHQ are not saying very much at all at the moment. They’ve told us that if it’s some¬ thing very special, that should have been sorted out during the war, we might never know because it might be too sensitive. “It could be that they’re telling us a new place where a bomb has been designed - it’s got to be something special.” To see the code visit www.mk- news.co.uk.
