        "text": "Milton Keynes (MK40)\n\nThe MK40 postcode area is located in the Milton Keynes postcode town region, within the county of Bedfordshire, and contains a total of 1410 individual postcodes.\n\nThere are 4 electoral wards in the MK40 postcode area, including Bedford, Buckingham, Milton Keynes, Newport Pagnell, Olney which come under the local authority of the Bedford Council.\n\nCombining the whole postcode region, 27% of people in MK40 are classed as having an AB social grade, (i.e. 'white-collar' middle-upper class), compared to 27% across the UK.\n\nThis does not mean that the people of MK40 are poorer than other areas, but it may give an indication that there are areas of deprivation.\n\nThe MK40 postcode is located in the London suburban District of Milton Keynes in the UK. It borders the Buckinghamshire suburbs of Bedford, Clapham, Wootton and Stony Stratford. The area contains mainly residential property, with some light industrial and commercial units and small retail parks.\n\nAt the heart of MK40 lies the area of Bletchley Park, once the home of the wartime code-breaking organisation, the Government Code & Cipher School, and now housing National Museum of Computing. The park is where Alan Turing cracked the Enigma code and is now a popular tourist attraction.\n\nThe area is well connected by road and rail. Bletchley railway station is located in the postcode and from here there are train services to London Euston, London Marylebone and Birmingham New Street. The area is also served by several bus lines, including the Blue Bus and routes 1 and 12 operated by Arriva, giving access to different parts of the town. The postcode is close to junction 13 of the M1 motorway and is within easy reach of the rest of the country.\n\nThe area is close to several leisure and cultural offerings. Bletchley Park has a summer concert series. Other attractions in the area include Xscape MK, a leisure complex offering activities such as skiing, bowling and cinema. Additionally, there is the Ouzel Valley Park and Caldecotte Lake, which is ideal for a leisurely jog or a picnic. Further afield, there are a number of other parks and lakes such as the Grand Union Canal and Stockgrove Country Park.\n\nThe region is served by several schools, including the Futures Community College and St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic School. There are also four primary schools in the area: Grange Park Primary, Stoke Hammond Primary, Duncombe Primary and Bletchley Park Primary.\n\nThe area boasts a steady property market and is known for its tree-lined avenues and wide selection of family homes. Prices have risen steadily over the past 10 years and the area is known for its excellent transport links and proximity to shopping and leisure amenities.\n\nDemographics"
