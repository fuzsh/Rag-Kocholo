        "text": "This page has been automatically generated by using the coordinates of the centre of MK43 9JT and including all schools within a fixed area around that point. We do not know the actual boundaries of MK43 9JT and we apply the same fixed area for all locations, be those big or small areas. As a result of this approximation, we may end up excluding schools that you consider to be in MK43 9JT and/or including schools that you consider to be outside of MK43 9JT. These pages are intended to ensure our site is returned in relevant search engine results, e.g. when someone searches for 'Schools in MK43 9JT'. Having come across this page and our site, we advise you to carry out your research using our detailed map (by clicking on the button above). As this page was automatically created, we cannot add or remove schools to or from it. Please therefore do not contact us asking for schools to be added as, unfortunately, this is not something we are able to do."
