        "text": "Course Objectives and Educational Goals This course provides an entry for students to inquire into the nature of education in a pluralist and democratic society. We will not only explore the BIG ISSUES in education but also our own relationship to education, as learners, community members, and (for some) prospective educators. The course is designed to provide students with opportunities to engage in collaborative and self-reflective practices exploring a variety of issues in Education. Through readings, films, discussions, group project, and writing assignments students will critically reflect on the nature and purpose of education and on emerging trends in educational practice. EDUC 100 is also a \" W \" course (writing-intensive) and, as such, students will learn to identify, analyze, and utilize the typical ways of writing in the discipline."
