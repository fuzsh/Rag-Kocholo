Cobblers fixtures for the new season SEE SPORT V Explosion fear as theft leaves school full of gas BY SOPHIE SCOTT sophie.scottpHPnorthants.co.uk ‘MINDLESS’ thieves could have caused a massive explosion at a primary school after they stole 12 metres of piping leading to the gas supply. Staff at The Arbours Primary School in St Gregory’s Road, Northampton, made the shocking discovery at 7.10am yesterday - finding the facility filled with dangerous gas. Headteacher Kat Johnston said one spark could have caused an explosion. She took the decision to close the school for the day - meaning 309 students had to stay at home. At first, staff thought it was just an attempted break-in but the smell of gas was overpowering. Miss Johnston said: “It has been quite dramatic. Gas was pouring into the build¬ ing and the smell was really pungent. We have had to turn off all the lights in case of potential sparks. “Like many schools we have been target¬ ed for copper piping. We are lucky they haven’t caused an explosion; the conse¬ quences could have been dreadful. And the children missed a day of school but it had to be closed for their safety. “What could have happened doesn’t bear thinking about. There was no thought. They are absolutely mindless.” A spokes¬ man for Amey said: “Amey acted immedi¬ ately to isolate the gas supply and ventilate the school by opening all windows and doors. There were no children or teaching staff in the building at the time. “Health and safety is always our top priority and a decision was made to close the school for the day while repairs are carried out.” A police spokeswoman said they were called at 7.35am and asked for any witness¬ es, or anyone who knows of anyone trying to sell copper piping, to call them on 101. The school was expected to re-open this morning. Herald & Post... the best things in life are free!

Council criticised over £83k development overspend AN overspend on a major redevelopment has been slammed by an opposition party. South Northants Council [SNC] has already spent an extra £83,000 than planned on the £45 million Moat Lane project in Towcester. Now, the Liberal Democrats are criticising the Conservative-run authority saying that money could have been used for vital services. The extra cash has been spent while negotiations with the developer have overrun. The regeneration will see retail, office, residential, leisure, car-parking and public open space come into the area. Lib Dem Councillor Martin Johns said: “Towcester welcomes this overall development but poor financial management by the ruling Tories is costing the community thousands. “We tried to get SNC to help pay for vital services such as a primary school crossing patrol and help for young unemployed travel costs. £83,000 would have been more than enough to help these vulnerable residents.” Conservative councillor Ian McCord said: “There has been an overspend on this one particular budget because negotiations overrun by a few months. However, as a result of this rental income is higher and will help offset this and savings from the repairs/maintenance budget at the existing site. “This overspend needs to be viewed in the wider context and the figures published which highlighted this showed actual expenditure for the year £852,000 less than was budgeted for. “Had we followed the Lib Dem suggestions to end the Moat Lane regeneration all the cash spent to date would have been wasted and SNC would be facing legal challenges for millions more.” BY SOPHIE SCOTT sophie.scott(a)HPnorthants.co.uk A PETROL station is being investigated after it allegedly made customers pay for fuel that drivers say did not come out of the pump. Motorists using the Shell fill¬ ing station in London Road, Northampton, two weeks ago complained to staff about the petrol gauge going up, when no fuel was coming out of the A SCHEME which could lead to the council raising more than £160,000 from pubs open later than midnight has been slammed as being a ‘cash-cow’. On Tuesday night, Northampton Borough Council’s licensing committee met to hear the latest update on the plans - which could be introduced in October. Councillors were told that the late-night levy’ - a charge for premises selling alcohol open between midnight and 6am - could bring in £164,511 from nozzle. Northamptonshire County Council has confirmed that a complaint was made and its trading standards team will be looking into the allegation. One H&P reader anony¬ mously called the paper to claim that despite himself and at least another two drivers telling management about the problem they were all still told to pay for the ‘non-existent petrol’. 178 businesses in Northampton. Of that money, £111,480 would go to the police and £47,790 to the council; while £5,340 would be deducted for ‘administration’. UKIP MEP for Northampton Derek Clark said: “This is yet another cash-cow to be milked by cynical politicians. “Very possibly clubs could find this kind of money but pubs are already up against it with the smoking ban and unfair competition from supermarkets selling cheap A spokeswoman from Northamptonshire County Council said: “We confirm that trading standards has received a complaint about this issue, and officers will be looking into it.” A Shell spokeswoman said: “Trading Standards has been in touch regarding a com¬ plaint at the site. “As always, Shell takes complaints seriously and is investigating. ” booze. With 20 pubs across the country closing every week they need help, not more cost reducing income. Pubs are a vital part of life where people meet and socialise. They are frequently the focal point of the community, a priceless facility.” A council spokesman said: “It is only a proposal, something the Government is still discussing. “On Tuesday night councillors were just getting an update as to where the plan is at.” Herald&PostBriefs FOOTY FAN NICKED FOR GBH POLICE dealt with a few football related crimes during England’s final Euro 2012 group stage match on Tuesday. One 41-year-old man was arrested for grievous bodily harm after a male was punched in Five Rivers Inn in Barrack Road, Northampton, shortly before kick-off. The victim suffered only slight injuries, said a police spokeswoman, and yesterday the arrested man was still in custody. And yesterday morning, officers were out in force as part of their summer drink driving campaign to catch out drivers who may still have been over the limit from boozing the night before. From June 13-19,27 people were arrested for drink driving and 19 were charged. DOCTORS’ STRIKE ACTION NHS Northants is confident it will be business as usual today during the doctors’ strike. The British Medical Association balloted its members and a majority agreed to strike over a pensions dispute. All emergency and urgent care will continue to be provided and all GP surgeries will be open with the majority providing a normal service. FIRM’S STAFF FACE AXE ALL staff at an insurance company's Northampton branch are facing redundancy. Aviva made the decision as the town's office - where 19 people work - is ‘not a prime location’. Employees will be able to apply for jobs in other regional offices. Janice Deakin, intermediary and partnerships director, said, “Making decisions that affect our staff is always really difficult but we believe these changes are necessary to deliver what our brokers are asking for.” SERIAL OFFENDER JAILED A MAN has been sentenced to six and a half years in prison after pleading guilty to a string of offences. Liam Wiggins, 21, from Bailiff Street, Northampton, admitted an assault on a man, a robbery on another male and a burglary all committed in Northampton in March this year. He was sentenced yesterday at Northampton Crown Court. Green-light expected on calls for parish status PLANS to create seven new parish councils were expected to be given the go-ahead last night. In seven areas community petitions were successfully completed with more than ten per cent of the electorate supporting the idea to create a parish council for their area. Northampton Borough Council has also received requests to make boundary changes to four existing parish authorities. Councillors also looked at two Parish Polls from 2008 to change the boundary in Upton and create two parish councils from the existing Wootton and East Hunsbury Parish Council. The report recommended looking at these proposals in more detail and opening the ideas up to public consultation before finalising any proposal ready for a formal Parish Poll. Councillor Brandon Eldred, cabinet member for community engagement, said: “We have had a fantastic response to the first stage of our Community Governance Review. Across the town over 2,000 people have signed petitions with their suggestions for new parish councils to be set up. And, our existing parish councils have taken the opportunity to re-examine their boundaries. “We know that local communities often know what is best for their area and how small improvements could be made to make neighbourhoods better for residents.” ‘Cash cow’ scheme will milk late-night bars HERALD&POST - Thursday, June 21,2012 13 Crew rescue woman handcuffed to a bed BY SOPHIE SCOTT sophie.scottpHPnorthants.co.uk A WOMAN had to freed from a bed after becoming stuck in a pair of handcuffs. The 22-year-old, of Robert Street, Northampton, had to be rescued by a crew of firefighters who were called to the house at 11.30pm on Sunday. A spokesman confirmed a man had opened the door to the firemen but did not speculate on the relationship. The crew then headed upstairs to remove the restraints from the fully clothed woman. A bolt cutter and hacksaw had to be used to take off the ‘old-style police’ cuffs after the woman’s hand had started to swell due to lack of circulation. Darren Dovey, head of service delivery at the fire service, said: “She was suitably embarrassed. “They didn’t stay too long or ask questions. “They were there for 15 minutes, went in and did what needed to be done and then departed. “We do get called to things like this every now and again. And people do turn up to the station asking for various things, like handcuffs, to be removed from themselves. “We get the job done and don’t ask too many questions. In this case, it didn’t require attendance from the police so it doesn’t appear to be anything sinister.” FIREFIGHTERS battled for almost 16 hours to put out a blaze which ravaged a 200 tonne stack of elephant grass bales. Emergency services were called to the fire, in fields on the outskirts of Long Buckby, at about 10.30pm on Monday night. Shortly after 2pm on Tuesday a crew from the village were still dealing with the last embers of the fire which completely destroyed the stack. Geoff Spokes, watch manager, said when his team arrived the blaze was so well developed that they had to stop it spreading before they could try to put it out. Throughout the day and night water carriers were having to come back to the scene - down a narrow farm track. The grass, which is used as a biofuel, was prepared to go to Charles Jackson, the Long Buckby firm which processes its chippings. A police spokeswoman said currently the fire is not being treated as suspicious.

Northampton Borough Council and centre owner Legal & General (L&G) met on Monday to discuss the agreement for facility’s exten¬ sion. Both parties agreed L&G will review the current scheme, following the announcement last week that it may no longer be viable. The council is now waiting for further information on the proposed timescale and a clear indication of what it might look like. Leader of the authority, Councillor David Mackintosh, said: “We have again restated our commitment to retail regenera¬ tion in Northampton town centre and our desire to see the current development agreement with L&G move ahead. “After our meeting, the borough council is waiting for more infor¬ mation on what a revised scheme for the Grosvenor Centre would look like. “What is clear is this is the prime location for retail development in the town and moving ahead with the new bus interchange is cen¬ tral to any plans for regeneration in Northampton town centre.” Simon Russian, head of retail development at L&G General Property, added: “Not withstand¬ ing the challenges of the current economic environment, we remain absolutely committed to Northampton and our invest¬ ment in the Grosvenor Centre. “We have now taken steps to re-engage our design team to come up with a viable scheme that meets the needs of the town and all parties concerned.” A series of fortnightly meetings has also been arranged to give the project momentum.

Cllr Mackintosh said: “We know our plan for creating jobs and attracting investment is ambitious but that does not put us off. “Across this region our partners are working with us to make Northampton a leading destination for business and innovation.” Dad’s doubts over extra school places BY SOPHIE SCOTT sophie.scott@HPnorthants.co.uk A PARENT is worried about the impact an additional 30 students will have on his child’s education. A ‘surge’ of pupils needing primary school places in Northampton means Northamp¬ tonshire County Council is having to create extra classes at five schools in the town. Councillor Andrew Grant said he could not explain where the extra 134 children, whose parents applied after the deadline for the reception year age group, came from. The schools affected are Boothville Primary, Bridgewater, Castle, Delapre and East Hunsbury. Each will take in another 30 pupils. To accommo¬ date the children the schools will be extended, refurbished or use mobile classrooms. The upset father, who we agreed not to name, fears his son will not have the same learning experi¬ ence at Bridgewater Primary School. He said: “With those extra pupils the whole school dynamic will change. Each year has two classes of 30 and there will sud¬ denly be an extra class. “And the effect it is going to have on the roads around the school with all those extra parents driv¬ ing in to drop their children off - it’s going to be chaos. We just feel that the council haven’t really addressed the issue.” Opposition councillor fenny Conroy said: “The Conservatives have completely failed to plan out how schools should be expanded and are now desperately scram¬ bling around for people to blame.” Cllr Grant said: “We plan some years ahead for school places, at primary and secondary level. “In doing so, we have access to birth rates telling us the numbers of children born in the county who’ll be needing school places some four years later alongside plans for new housing develop¬ ments which will add to the school population. “However, both this year and last we’ve seen a surge of applica¬ tions for children who quite frankly hadn’t been factored into the town’s capacity needs. “We’re dealing with changes in migratory patterns, with more families moving into the county than previously was the case, with those families increasingly opting to raise their families in the town centre. “Where they’ve come from, whether it’s from the East Midlands region, London overspill or from abroad, we don’t know because we don’t ask our school applicants for those details. “What we do know is that it’s placing an unprecedented demand on Northampton’s primary sector capacity where we have reached saturation point.” He added: “We’ve spent the past few weeks in very constructive talks with our local schools and as a result we’ve been able to identify new places to meet that pressure.” MOBILITY SALE OFFERS!

OOp/c/m . Natural Gas & LPG . 24hr Emergency Call Out BY LAWRENCE JOHN lawrence.john(a)HPnorthants.co.uk NORTHAMPTONSHIRE'S boot and shoe industry is alive and kicking. If one was to paraphrase the American author Mark Twain you would say ‘the reports of its death are greatly exaggerated’. Far from vanishing away to the pages of history, the footwear industry in the county is flour¬ ishing as people realise quality shoes are associated with Northamptonshire. The latest figures from the British Footwear Association show they have 16 members from the county who are respon¬ sible for employing up to 2,500 people. It will never reach the heyday of the industry in the 1880s/90s when one in four people in the county were employed making shoes. But why did Northampton become famous for its footwear? Well one reason, it turns out, is an early case of royal patronage. Shoe resources officer at Northampton Museum and Art Gallery, Rebecca Shawcross, said: “In 1213, King John passed through the town and bought a pair of shoes. “From that moment on every¬ one started buying shoes from Northampton. “By the 14th century there was a shoemakers’ Guild in the town. “The other big moment for the industry came in 1642 when Thomas Pendleton was asked to provide 1,000 pairs of shoes and 500 boots for Oliver Cromwell’s army. He did it all on time and shipped them to Ireland but he was never paid. “From this moment on the shoe industry grew.” The other factor in its rise was the fact that in the 12th century Northampton was on a drovers road so there was plenty of cat¬ tle. It also had oak bark from Salcey Forest and Rockingham Forest to tan the leather and water from the River Nene. Rebecca said a number of the 100,000 visitors who come to the shoe museum were fascinated to know there were still factories in the county producing shoes. She added: “A lot of people do not realise it and find out when they come and look around the museum. The Japanese and Italians love shoes. “One of the things which made a big impact was the film Kinky Boots which many know about.” 1st Gas Engineers Ltd Tel 01604 670549 / 07973 266832 www.1stgas.com Northants companies still making footwear: ■ Airwaves [Dr Martens], Wollaston ■ Alfred Sargent, Rushden ■ Barkers, Earls Barton ■ Chancery Footwear, Northampton ■ Church & Co, Northampton ■ Crockett and Jones, Northampton ■ D B Shoes, Rushden ■ Edward Green, Northampton ■ Gaziano and Girling, Kettering ■ Grenson Ltd, Rushden ■ Horace Batten Bootmaker Ltd, Ravensthorpe ■ Joseph Cheaney & Sons, Desborough ■ T Groocock, Rothwell ■ Loake, Kettering ■ NPS, Wollaston, ■ Sanders and Sanders, Rushden ■ R ETrickers Ltd, Northampton.

Worth £10,000, they have been especially created for Lady Godiva, a 33ft tall puppet of the 11th century noble-woman. She will be presented with her new footwear on July 31 when the puppet comes through Northampton as part of her tour of the country. The man who made the boots is Terry Eager. He has worked for the company since 1985 but has been making shoes and boots since he was 16. He said: “A normal pair of boots can take about one to one and a half hours. “These took four/five hours and weighed seven kilos. To complete the edges I had to go home and get a sander. What was strange the next pair of boots I made were size two so I took a picture of them next to the size 72 boots for comparison.” The 5ft by 3.5ft shoe box for the Godiva boots could be a record breaker. Nene Packaging Ltd, which made it, have sent their efforts to the Guinness Book of World Records to be verified. Sales manager Jon Nicholson said: “We said we will make another one for the museum as this at the moment is the only one in the world.” KI®GPti[fLiacfLQg)li®[Q UPVC Windows • Doors • Conservatories Official suppliers of REHAU, KOMMERLING and DURAFLEX Telephone: 01604 633445 Northampton Business Centre, Lower Harding Street, Northampton NN1 2JL STEAMED UP DOUBLE GLAZING?

Uni blasts 14th rank for crime BY LAWRENCE JOHN lawrence.johnpHPnorthants.co.uk THE University of Northampton has hit back at crime statistics which placed it as being the 14th worst in the country. The figures, produced by The Complete University Guide, were compiled from official police data and listed the annual reported incidents per 1,000 residents from June 2011 to May this year, with¬ in wards or electoral divi¬ sions of which parts are within three miles of the main university campus. The ranking is based on the cumulative rate of three crimes - burglary, robbery and violent crime. Bernard Kingston, founder of The Complete University Guide, said: “Our new methodology allows potential students to assess the risks for indi¬ vidual institutions with much greater precision, at least for England and Wales. “In the absence of data for crimes affecting uni- STATISTICS: The university’s main Park Campus site versity students specifical¬ ly, either on or off campuses, they offer the best available guide.” But Delia Heneghan, dean of students and sen¬ ior member of staff in res¬ idence at the University of Northampton, said: “As the authors of the Complete University Guide admit - the crime data is not based on student-related incidents. “It is based on general crime statistics on the whole population from areas (designated political wards) wholly or partly within three miles of our main Park Campus. “There are areas within three miles of our Park Campus, such as Moulton and Kingsthorpe, with a high density of both industry and residential which will skew the stats for burglary and robbery. “As dean of students, I have lived on site at our Park Campus for 12 years. “Incidents of crime of any nature relating to our students are extremely low. “We work closely with the police and also through our Student Support Services and Student Union and take the safety and welfare of our students and our staff very seriously.” The Guide’s top 5 uni’s for crime 1 Manchester Metrpolitan 2 Leeds, 3 Manchester, 4 Salford 5 Birmingham City (List excludes London] COLOURED DOORS WINDOWS/DOORS ROOFLINE CONSERVATORIES 10 I HERALD&POST - Thursday, June 21, 2012 yourletters M Write to us at Herald&Post, 4 Waterside Way, The Lakes, \\ Kindly supported by Bairstow eves Way, The Lakes, Northampton NN4 7XD or email letters@HPnorthants.co.uk including your name and address Herald&Post 4 Waterside Way, The Lakes, Northampton, NN4 7XD.

Printed by: Cambridge Newspapers Limited, Winship Road, Milton, Cambridge CB4 6PP £1 where sold Ignorant club views belong in I WRITE in reply to Jac Higgs who is, again, calling for Urban Tiger’s closure (H&P Letters May 31). Firstly, what we are doing is perfectly legal. We have to apply, and pay, for two separate licences, and abide by a strict code of conduct. We go to great lengths to run a safe and respectable venue and to ensure our dancers are treated with respect. We have customers of both sexes, from 18 to 65. The police never have to attend to deal with disorder. How many nightclubs in town can claim that? Women who work as dancers do so of their own choice. They earn a good income, they can work as many nights a week as they wish, and can take time off whenever they want. How many jobs offer that? We enable single mums to have their days free to look after their children and yet earn enough money to stay off benefits. We enable young women to pay their way through university without running up huge debts. Higgs claims that regulating lap dancing clubs is a matter of equality, yet if we were to close 75 per cent of the people who would lose their jobs are women. Hardly a victory for equality! Equality means having equal right to choose how you live your life, yet Higgs would gladly take away the choices of 30,000 women who work as dancers in the UK. Dancing is one of the few jobs where women earn more than men, so it hardly contributes to inequality! Higgs claims that areas around lap dancing clubs “become no-go areas for women”. There is no evidence to support this. Police acknowledge that well-run licenced premises can actually reduce crime in their vicinity due to the presence of exterior lighting, CCTV and doormen. We have many female customers who come precisely because they feel safe here. Over 40 per cent of our website and Facebook members are women. We also hold ladies’ nights and pole dancing classes, for women. Higgs claims our location is inappropriate. But if we were located in some secluded, dark side street this would deter women, not men, from coming to the club. Unlike other sex shops, Anne Summers succeeded in engaging a female audience precisely because of their open shop fronts and high street locations. Our location makes this type of venue more accessible to women. Higgs claims “research shows” that lap dancing clubs increase demand for prostitution, impact women’s safety, equality, and dancers face exploitative conditions. She also claims that lap dancing clubs fuel a sexist culture which has “clear links” to violence against women. These are big claims, if you’re going to make accusations like that you should have some www northamptonnewstVLCO.uk Your comments from our website...

Dr M.E Henstock I’ll get the facts by visiting myself “MILDLY irritated” about my common sense views re ‘lap dancing clubs’ are you Jasmine? (H&P Letters, June 14). Wouldn’t want to cross you when you are really angry flower! Touched a raw nerve did I? Would be no difference at all in your out of proportion, insulting language reply I’m sure whether or not I had applied a name to my piece, it’s obvious you have this ‘feministic’ mental block! I have no need to research those two subjects in theory at all now, did it all for me with your bold efforts, in spite of it being wildly prejudiced! I wonder if you could be another modern female whose objective is to try to repress the male gender, come what may? Your Guardian newspaper testimonials, ‘public sector’ austerity cuts, capitalism to benefit only the one per cent of society. Even after 13 years of New Labour too! Say no more, your bias shows once again, in abundance! You have however, conveniently forgotten to mention that women get anonymity in alleged rape court cases, leaving the man to suffer the consequences when found not guilty! To hell with your notion of equality then? If the women lap dancers didn’t enjoy their work or the financial rewards at Urban Tiger, it would no doubt close tomorrow. Think I will visit the club after their forthcoming licence renewal, to find out the true facts for myself. The mind boggles! Maybe I will see you in the audience petal, in disguise of course? Jack (The lad!) Northampton Enjoy the fun at Walk in the Park MAY I take this opportunity to invite Herald & Post readers to come and join us at this year’s Walk In The Park festival. The legendary Midge Ure headlines our Friday night extravaganza on June 29 and will be joined by Errol Reid (China Black), Two Shoes (X Factor) ‘Victorian age’ evidence. But there is none. In fact, data from Cornwall Police show that in the three years following the opening of lap dancing clubs in Newquay, the number of serious sexual assaults halved. The Magnanti report also concludes that all the available evidence for Britain points to a sharp fall in rape rates in areas that introduce lap dancing clubs. And an analysis of 110 studies looking at the impact of strip clubs and other adult businesses found that there was no correlation between any adult-oriented business and any negative effect. Protestors like Higgs freely admit they have never been inside a lap dancing club, and have never even spoken to a dancer, let alone interviewed a representative sample. Consequently they don’t - they can’t - know anything about us. Higgs is objecting because she simply doesn’t like the idea of lap dancing clubs. She makes wild, unfounded accusations to support her point of view and shows a total disregard for the truth. She would have you believe that otherwise normal men enter lap dancing clubs and leave an hour later frothing at the mouth, ready to rape the nearest woman. It is, of course, utterly ridiculous. How can it be right to demand the loss of 40 jobs simply because you don’t like something, and worse still, when you are operating from a position of total ignorance? Attitudes like that should be left in the Victorian age. We live in a modern, diverse and supposedly tolerant society. If you don’t like Urban Tiger, that’s fine. Don’t come. But please Ms Higgs, live and let live. Karim General manager, Urban Tiger and top local acts Anyone Out There, Odd Child and Leanne Boyes. Among the highlights of our Family Day on June 30 is the chance to support Armed Forces Day, which we are proud to host as part of our event this year. Walk In The Park is a fabulous local festival organised by local people, for local people. I am proud to chair its organising committee and I am delighted at the enthusiasm the event now attracts from our visitors. A small, dedicated team of local people work incredibly hard to put this festival on and the fact we can attract a headline act like Midge Ure this year is their reward. We are also very lucky to have local business supporting us and I single out Beacon Bingo, Linde, The Comms Group and The Yeoman of England pub for thanks and appreciation. Thanks too, to the local police for their support, though - as ever - we hope the officers on duty have a quiet weekend! We also listen to feedback. This year we have doubled the number of toilets, doubled the num¬ ber of bars to relieve queues and our Family Day will end at 7pm at the request of local residents. So on behalf of the organisers, we look forward to seeing you next weekend. For tickets for our Friday extravaganza on June 29, go to www.walkintheparkfestival.co.uk.

Advice included taking a walk and getting out in the sunshine for ten minutes. It was part of Age UK’s Falls Awareness Week which is highlighting the importance of exercise alongside a calcium rich balanced diet and getting enough Vitamin D to build and maintain healthy bones. Northampton General Hospital’s falls prevention coordinator, Jo Jennings, said: “As we get older our bone strength naturally deteriorates which puts us at greater risk of serious injury if we do fall.” BY SOPHIE SCOTT sophie.scottpHPnorthants.co.uk A DEAFBLIND mum has spoken out about her worry over the Government’s proposed cuts to her benefits which she fears will mean she can no longer live independently. Janice Tillett, 40, of Crofters Close, East Hunsbury, Northampton, relies on the money to help her get about, do day-to-day tasks and all the extra costs that come with hearing and sight loss. The mother-of-one is facing losing some of the money from the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) as the Government plan to cut £1.45 billion a year by introducing the Personal Independence Payment. Mrs Tillett said: “The help I get from DLA is not a luxury. Cooking is hard for me so we often eat out or rely on pre-prepared food which is expen¬ sive. I need a number of aids around the house such as talking clocks, slip mats, screen readers and more and the costs mount up. “My husband works full-time as a train driver, working shifts. Our older relatives died over a year ago so our daughter has no grandparents at all and younger family members have their own lives and they live all over the UK. The help we currently receive is vital. “The Government seems to think that over time it becomes easier and cheaper to live with a sight and hear¬ ing loss but that simply isn’t true. My disability isn’t going to go away. In time you learn to live with it but the expenses don’t go away.” The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and Deafblind UK believes the proposed criteria for deciding who qualifies for PIP fails to recognise the challenges of living with a sight and hearing loss.

Northamptonshire County Council and Northampton Borough Council have both agreed to the concessions on Monday, July 2. The county authority will be offering free on-street parking at pay and display bays in the town centre although other enforcement will continue to avoid vehicles causing any obstructions. The borough council (NBC) will offer free parking in all of its car parks until midday. Leader of NBC, Councillor David Mackintosh, said: ‘The Olympic Torch coming to our town is a huge event and will be something that will be remembered for years to come. We are still a couple of weeks away but you can already feel the excitement growing with the bunting in the town centre. “I am pleased to say parking at all of the borough council’s car parks will be free on the morning the Torch comes to town. “We want to make it as easy as possible for everyone to come and see it. This is something that should not be missed as it may not happen again for a very long time, so come into Northampton, park for free and help us to welcome the Olympic Torch to our town.” County council cabinet member, Cllr Ben Smith, added: ‘This is a big day for the county and I am pleased we’re working with the borough council to make sure as many people as possible enjoy this important event.” 20th death sparks call for mad review BY LAWRENCE JOHN lawrence.johnpHPnorthants.co.uk AN urgent review of road safety is being called for following the death of a 20th person on a county route this year. More people have died as a result of traffic accidents in Northamptonshire in the first six months of 2012 than the whole of last year when 19 perished. The latest victim was 19-year- old Gemma Stanley from Coventry who died at the scene of a crash on the A361 north of Ashby St Ledgers on Saturday. Now, the leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition group at Northamptonshire County Council, Councillor Brendan Glynane, is demanding all aspects of road safety are looked into. He said: “Northamptonshire County Council should be taking the lead as it is responsible for road safety and it should be step¬ ping up to the mark. “There needs to be an urgent review and a plan of action to address what is happening. “These incidents are down to a number of factors which have all come together. For example the lights being switched off and the speed cameras being turned off. “In incidents like these organi¬ sations should take a few steps back and look at the overall picture.” Last month the Liberal Democrats called for the speed cameras in the county to be turned back on but this was rejected by the Conservative-led authority. A spokesman for the county council said: “So far this year, investigations have not revealed any common themes between these collisions and have includ¬ ed a variety of possible contribu¬ tory factors, including fatigue, distraction, excess alcohol, inap¬ propriate speed, vehicle defects and weather conditions. “There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that there is a correlation between switching off fixed-site safety cameras and the number of accidents on our roads.” Deputy chief constable of Northants Police, Suzette Davenport, said: “Tragically, 20 people have now lost their lives on our roads this year and our thoughts, as always, are with those who have lost loved ones. “Our investigations to date have not revealed any common themes between these collisions. “We cannot emphasise enough the importance of prevention. “Every motorist has a responsi¬ bility to do as much as they can to prevent themselves becoming another road death statistic. “Simple things such as wearing a seatbelt and not being distract¬ ed while at the wheel by a mobile phone or radio, are absolutely key to staying safe on our roads. “As is remembering the speed limit is not a target and that dur¬ ing adverse weather conditions a slower speed will often be more appropriate.” Mn su thai spa Our qualified therapist’s are proud to offer you a variety of relaxing massages.

Jim’s royal nod for his civic effort BY SOPHIE SCOTT sophie.scottpHPnorthants.co.uk THE leader of Northamp¬ tonshire County Council has praised his father as his ‘inspiration’ after he was handed an OBE in The Queen’s birthday honours. Councillor Jim Harker, who has been involved in local government since 1979, is one of seven county residents to receive an accolade. The announcement was made on Saturday. Cllr Harker received his honour for services to civic society and to the county’s economy. He said: “I am very pleased and very honoured.

In the last two months there has been a rise in such offences in the East Hunsbury area of Northampton - and it’s down to motorists failing to lock and secure their cars. Members of the Southwest Safer Community Team have recorded 29 recent car crimes and 80 per cent was caused by this problem. Inspector Jen Helm said: “Leaving your vehicle insecure makes life very easy for someone who is looking to steal your hard earned property. “Not only could you have your car or items from within it stolen, you could also see an impact on your future insurance payments as a consequence.” Members of the SCT are now conducting more uniform and plain clothed patrols in the area.

Electors who had not already applied for a postal vote for the Grange Park by-election were not reminded of the deadline to do so. Returning officer Sue Smith said: “This is an unfortunate situation which should not have occurred and I would like to apologise for any inconvenience this has caused. We have put in place measures to prevent this from happening again in the future. “My immediate concern is to ensure all of those entitled to vote on June 28 can do so. The error occurred when the polling cards, which are normally sent by second class post, went out without taking into consideration the Jubilee bank holiday. Had this been recognised, the returning officer said the cards would have been sent earlier and by first class post. The by-election is needed after the ward councillor for the area died last month. Cllr Paul Farrow, who was vice-chairman of South Northamptonshire Council, passed away just days before he was due to become chairman.

SUMMER SALE EVENT GREAT SAVINGS Charles Barr Furniture Country Works Sunderland Road, Sandy Beds Tel: 01767 681444 • www.charlesbarr.co.uk INVITATION TO OUR Our factory showrooms will be open on: Saturday 23rd June 10am to 3pm Sunday 24th June 11am to 4pm site at www. charlesbarr. co.uk BY SOPHIE SCOTT sophie.scott(a)HPnorthants.co.uk TWO men have been jailed for 14 years each for the ‘sadistic torture’ of a man in which an offensive word was tattooed to his head and cigarettes were put down his boxers. For between five and seven hours Nigel Herron and Abdirahman Rooble brutally beat their victim, 22-year-old Mark Kyprianou, at Herron’s flat, along with a third man - who has never been identi¬ fied. On December 2 last year, he was punched and kicked; the middle of his head was shaved and an offensive four- letter swear word was tat¬ tooed to his forehead. Mr Kyprianou was also burnt with an iron on both his chest and back. He had been made to strip to just his boxers and lit ciga¬ rettes were stubbed out on his nipples and put down his underwear so his genitals were burnt. Rooble, of Birmingham, threatened to cut off Mr Kyprianou’s fingers with a meat cleaver and the third, unidentified man, held a loaded gun to his head and threatened to take him some¬ where remote to kill him. The ordeal he was put through was because the men believed he had stolen money they had made from selling drugs. Herron, 37, of Herbert Street, Northampton, and 19-year-old Rooble both denied causing grievous bod¬ ily harm with intent but were found guilty by a jury in May. Handing them both 14-year sentences, ludge Lynn Tayton said: “This was a sadistic torture of another human being.” She added: “He [Mr Kyprianou] has had laser treatment but marks are still there and he will continue to have scars. He has nightmares about what happened and depression.” She added: “Serious injuries were caused, the assault was over a sustained period of hours, it was clearly pre-med- itated, weapons were used and there were threats with a gun.” Herron’s barrister David Everitt said since being in prison he has become a ‘Wing Representative’. Rooble will serve his term in a Young Offenders’ Institute. Despite both having previ¬ ous offences, fudge Tayton said she believed that as the nature of those offences were not similar to this she did not regard them as being a ‘dan¬ ger’ to the public. At their trial the jury failed to return a verdict on an offence of kidnapping, fudge Tayton ordered this to lie on file. jlL^J rsee oun classified ^sectionj sell your unwanted items under If you believe that something inaccurate or intrusive has been published about you, then you can come to the Press Complaints Commission for help.

The LED lighting began to go up in St Michael’s car park in Northampton at the end of last week and will take up to two months to finish. Once completed it is expected to save Northampton Borough Council almost £18,000 a year. Funding from energy partnership SALIX will pay for the lighting. Last year the authority was awarded the Carbon Trust Standard in recognition of the reductions it has made in cutting its carbon footprint and its clear commitment to reducing energy year on year. Councillor John Caswell, borough council cabinet member for the environment, said: “As our aim is to continue to reduce our emissions year on year I am very pleased to see the new lighting being installed in St Michael’s.” Woman lorry driver ‘critical’ after smash BY SOPHIE SCOTT sophie.scott@)HPnorthants.co.uk A 21-YEAR-OLD lorry driver remains in a critical condition in hospital after her vehicle overturned on a motorway. The Ml was closed for almost 12 hours as emergency services worked to free the lady driver, who was trapped for four-and-a-half hours, and then repair the road. The woman, who is from Ireland and was driving a Montgomery Refrigeration LGV had to have a blood transfusion at the scene before she could be flown by air ambulance to Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry. The lorry hit a stationary car on the hard shoulder of the south¬ bound side of the motorway between junctions 16 and 15a at about 6.20am last Thursday. CRASH SCENE: Picture courtesy of James Tzanoudakis via Twitter This caused the lorry to climb the embankment before it turned on its side and collided with a bridge support. The driver of the car which had stopped in the hard shoulder, a 63-year-old woman from Essex, was stood at the top of an embankment when the collision happened and was not injured. The Ml southbound re-opened at 5pm last Thursday. Witnesses should call the Drivewatch Hotline on 0800 174615. uiraMiwiou?

The locomotive was built in Crewe in 1933 and named after the Queen when she was a princess and just seven years old. The tour will leave Northampton station at about 8.15am to take passengers to Winchester by the early after¬ noon for about three and a half hours in the city. The train will arrive back in Northampton around 8.50pm. Passengers have four different travel options to choose from: Two full dining options (Pullman Style and Premier Dining), First Class and Premium Standard. Marcus Robertson, chairman of The Cathedrals Express, said: “The interest and enthusiasm from passengers to experience the sights, sounds and smells of a steam train as it thunders through the countryside at speeds of up to 75mph is won¬ derful.” Prices range from £99 to £225 per person. To book, contact 01483 209888 or visit www.CathedralsExpress.co.uk Herald&PostBrief OPEN YOUR BOOTS FOR HALL MONEY will be raised for the refurbishment of Pattishall Parish Hall from a car boot.
