VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton

Script written by Max Lett.

The '50s were a time when comedy went hand in hand with singing, dancing and romance. In this video, http://www.WatchMojo.com counts down our picks for the Top 10 comedies from the 1950s. For our series on the Top Comedies of All Time, we've chosen comedy films per decade based on their iconic status, critical acclaim, box-office success, watchability and, of course, how funny they are. This is part of a series of videos spanning the decades of comedic films from the 1930s to the 2000s.

Special thanks to our users Ovidijus Gelzinis, moereinhart and Shawn Mark for submitting the idea on our Suggestions Page at WatchMojo.comsuggest read more...
