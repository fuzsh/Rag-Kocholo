        "text": "Sub-genre: Absurdist Film​\n\nWhat is Absurdist Film and when did it begin?\n\nAbsurdism is the belief that humans live within a chaotic universe that does not have any sole purpose.\n\nAbsurdism as a concept dates back to the early 20th century and it was movement that became prominent in the 1950s.\n\nCommon Characteristics:\n\nHumor is a large part of the genre.\n\nAbsurdist humor is different from a typical comedy\n\n​Focuses greatly on the chaotic aspect of life and unpredictable juxtapositions\n\nAbsurdism in film opens a door to more philosophical and thought provoking stories.\n\nAbsurdism is widely used in post-war stories as a way to cope with the trauma war brings with their survivors.\n\nComedy is one way that absurdist films cope with post-war trauma but another way is by raw thrillers and horror films as well as science fiction\n\nAlfred Hitchcock's films:\n\nAlfred Hitchcock was a film director who had a peak in his career in the 1950s with his film \"Dial M For Murder\". After releasing that film, his fame grew larger.\n\nHitchcock is one of the most popular film directors who dabbled in absurdism.\n\nHis first absurdist film was \"The Birds\" which was released in 1963. It is a horror -thriller that focuses on a series of random violent bird attacks in California.\n\nthe birds attacking civilians is symbolic for the entrapment of animals for humans on use so the film questions what would happen if it were the other way around​\n\nExamples of Absurdist films:\n\n1. \"Dr. Strangelove\"\n\n1964 film that studies the nature of human violence\n\nAn absurd satire of the Cold War\n\nThe main satire is the one on the MAD theory which was in serious development during the Cold War era by scientists\n\nThe MAD theory (Mutually Assured Destruction) is a military strategy where nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides of a war will cause total destruction on both sides.\n\nThe film showcases the extent of human violence and the lengths humans will go to in order to receive power.\n\n2. \"Synecdoche, New York\"\n\nReleased in 2008\n\nThe story follows a theater director who starts living in a studio warehouse that happens to be a replica of New York City. The director chooses to live this new life path so he can search for the ultimate truth of life.\n\nThe film itself is a complex soul-crushing story with that existential crisis that highlights absurdism\n\n3. \"Two Days, One Night\"\n\nA French film, released in 2014\n\nThe story follows a Sandra, a woman who is on the brink of losing her job unless she convinces her co-workers to give up their bonuses so she can get that money for herself.\n\nShe goes through quite a bit mentally and she is struggling to figure out how to keep her job and her sanity.\n\nThe film is considered absurdist because of it's bizarre nature and the in-depth of the extents the woman takes to get said job back"
