It was also the era of the Korean War and the the meteoric rise of television - with 5 million TV sets sold in 1950 versus only 172,000 sold just two years earlier.\n\nTelevision, establishing itself as a formidable entertainment medium, breathed new life into the careers of many golden age, comedic film stars: Jackie Gleason, Lucille Ball, Red Skelton, Jack Benny, Abbott and Costello, and Groucho Marx.\n\nDespite the rise of this new medium, the studios were still cranking out quality comedy and musical comedies films. These included; Mister Roberts (1955), Some Like It Hot (1959), How to Marry a Millionaire (1953), Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953), The Seven Year Itch (1955), and the iconic, Singinâ€™ in the Rain (1952).\n\nWhile comedies looked a little differently in the '50s (versus the hilarity of previous years), it was still a prolific era for veteran stars James Stewart, Lucille Ball, Cary Grant, and Ginger Rogers, and newer film stars; Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis, Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Marilyn Monroe, Gene Kelly, Natalie Wood, Rock Hudson, and Doris Day."
