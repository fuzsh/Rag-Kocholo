Together, they must work out who the murderer or murderers are before the police arrive.\n\n\"Clue\" originally failed when it premiered in 1985 but has since developed a cult following. In addition, similar to the game, there are multiple endings to the film.\n\n\"Clue\" is available to rent or purchase on Prime Video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The Afterparty\" is a genre-hopping murder mystery comedy.\n\nIn \"The Afterparty,\" former classmates at a high school reunion become suspects in a murder case when one of their own ends up dead at the afterparty.\n\nThe suspects are asked about their version of events which leads to the episodes changing genres to fit different characters' perspectives. For example, there is an episode where the story is told in a musical format.\n\nThe series is filled with comedy stars such as Ken Jeong, Tiffany Haddish, Ben Schwartz, Sam Richardson, and Ilana Glazer.\n\nThe first season of \"The Afterparty\" is available to stream on Apple TV+.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSam Rockwell and Saoirse Ronan team up to solve an Agatha Christie-related murder in \"See How They Run.\"\n\nThe best part of the \"Knives Out\" franchise is the way it uses and subverts tropes from the murder mystery genre for comedic and satirical effects. \"See How They Run,\" which premiered earlier this year, does the same while focusing on Agatha Christie's famous play \"The Mousetrap.\"\n\nSet in the 1950s, Inspector Stoppard (Sam Rockwell) and rookie Constable Stalker (Saoirse Ronan) are forced to work together to solve the murder of the producer of an upcoming movie adaptation of \"The Mousetrap.\"\n\n\"See How The Run\" is available to stream on HBO Max.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJennifer Aniston and Adam Sandler team up as a married couple who get caught in a murder investigation in \"Murder Mystery.\"\n\nNetflix's take on the murder mystery comedy genre came in the form of \"Murder Mystery,\" which is loosely based on Agatha Christie's novel \"Murder on Orient Express.\"\n\nIn the film, police officer Nick Spitz (Adam Sandler) and his wife Audrey (Jennifer Aniston) are swept into a murder investigation when they agree to spend their anniversary trip in Europe on a billionaire's yacht.\n\nWhen they become the lead suspects, together they must discover who is the real murderer and clear their name.\n\n\"Murder Mystery\" is available to stream on Netflix.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Hot Fuzz,\" Simon Pegg and Nick Frost attempt to solve a string of murders in a small town.\n\n\"Hot Fuzz\" follows skilled London police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg), who is sent away to Somerset when he irritates his superiors by being too good at his job. While there, he becomes frustrated by the mundanity of the village until he discovers a string of murders happening around the town.\n\nWith his trusty partner, PC Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the police officer attempts to solve the mystery despite everyone around them claiming it was just an accident.\n\n\"Hot Fuzz\" is available to stream on Starz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a wacky murder mystery involving cartoon characters.\n\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is a 1980s comedy-mystery set in a world where live-action humans and animated cartoons interact with each other.\n\nIn the film, a cartoon rabbit called Roger (Charlie Fleischer) hires human detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) to snoop on his wife. When Roger is framed for murder, Eddie is the only one who can prove his innocence.\n\nNot only is the film the first and only time cartoon characters from Walt Disney and Warner Bros. have appeared together on-screen, but it has also won three Academy awards.\n\n\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is available to stream on Disney+.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A Shot in the Dark\" is a must-watch from \"The Pink Panther\" murder mystery franchise.\n\nConsisting of 10 films, \"The Pink Panther\" franchise follows the adventures of a bumbling French police detective Inspector Jacques Clouseau as he stumbles his way through solving murder mysteries.\n\n\"A Shot in the Dark\" is the second film in the series and one of the best. In the film, Clouseau is investigating the murder of a chauffeur in a country home. Fans of slapstick comedy rather than satire will find this film more appealing.\n\n\"A Shot in the Dark\" is available to rent or purchase on Prime Video.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"The Kid Detective,\" a private detective takes on his first adult case.\n\nIn \"The Kid Detective,\" Abe Applebaum (Adam Brody), a once-celebrated child detective, is frustrated that he now only gets trivial mysteries at the age of 32. That is until Gracie Gulliver (Kaitlyn Chalmers-Rizzato) brings him his first \"adult\" case, the mystery of who murdered her boyfriend.\n\nHowever, Abe might have bitten off more than he can chew with this mystery.\n\n\"The Kid Detective\" is available to stream on Starz.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Vengeance\" follows a New York journalist who travels to Texas to solve the murder of a person he once hooked up with.\n\n\"Vengeance\" is another podcast-based murder mystery, written, directed, and starring B.J Novak.\n\nThe film, which was released earlier this year, follows a New York journalist (Novak), who decides to solve the mystery of the death of a former fling at the request of her family.\n\nIn order to do so, he travels down to Texas and decides to record the story for a podcast.
