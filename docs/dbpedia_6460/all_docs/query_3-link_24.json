        "text": "I saw that. It's probably the best review. I doubt I'll buy the set, though you're right that it includes some great movies.\n\nOne missing movie (and one of Hope's best) is My Favorite Brunette. It might have been excluded because of the lack of a good quality print. The TCM copy (as others have noted) has exceptionally bad picture quality. Yet they keep showing it. The Amazon Prime version looks better, but the sound is awful and the subtitles lag behind the dialogue. The Shout Factory version has excellent picture quality, and the sound isn't too bad, but there are no subtitles. It can be purchased on three and five movie DVDs . . . the advantage being that there is no overlap with the 21-movie set and the disadvantage being that the other included films (save, perhaps, The Lemon Drop Kid), either are not my cup of tea - I don't like many of the \"Road\" pictures - or have technical issues of their own (specifically, a \"pan and scan\" version of a lame film from the 1970s called The Seven Little Foys).\n\nYou never know what you're going to get with Hope (perhaps a reason to get the 10-DVD set). Sometimes he's spot on with his timing and ad libs, while other times he's just mailing it in. His influence is obvious, whether on Kelsey Grammer or Woody Allen. I even saw some wordless comedy from 1942 (My Favorite Blonde) that I definitely can see as potentially influencing a then 16 year-old Jerry Lewis. Regarding Allen, this SCTV spoof is not far off the mark (i.e., the influence on Allen despite Allen's likely disappointment in the elder TV Bob Hope).\n\nPART 1"
