        "text": "by Allan Fish\n\n(USSR 1944 99m) DVD1/2\n\nThe crowning of the master\n\np/d/w/ed Sergei M.Eisenstein ph Eduard Tisse, Andrei Moskvin m Sergei Prokofiev art/cos Iosif Shpinel, Leonid Naumov\n\nNikolai Cherkassov (Prince Ivan, later Ivan IV), Ludmilla Tselikovskaya (Anastasia Romanovna), Serafima Birman (Euphrosyne Staritsky), Mikhail Nazvanov (Prince Andrei Kurbsky), Pavel Kadochnikov (Vladimir Staritsky), Andrei Abrikosov (Boyar Fyodor Kolychev, later Metropolitan Philip), Mikhail Kuznetsov (Fyodor Bazmanov), Alexei Buma (Alexei Basmanov), Mikhail Zharov (Malyuta Skuratov), Alexander Mgebrov (Pimen, Archbishop of Novgorod), Vsevelod Pudovkin (Nikolai, the fool), A.Balashov (Peter Volynets), Pavel Massalsky (King Sigismund of Poland), Vladimir Balachov (Peter Volynets), S.Timoshenko (Kaspar Von Oldenbock), Maxim Mikhailov (The Archdeacon),\n\nIt has always been the subject of much debate whether Sergei Eisenstein could ever have made it in Hollywood. For certain it would have been interesting to see if he could have made it out there as did Lang and, briefly, Murnau, or whether it would only have been short-lived. Either way, such conjecture is arbitrary. The fact is that he didn’t and, after the abortive Que Viva Mexico (later restored by friend and colleague Grigori Alexandrov), he was forced to return to the Soviet Union. After making the propagandist Alexander Nevsky, it was another four years before he was persuaded, if that’s the right word, by Stalin to make his next film, based on the great first Russian Tsar, Ivan IV of Moscow. Eisenstein was reluctant for many reasons, not least because he feared a lack of creative freedom, but eventually he relented and began preparing the film in 1942. It was originally intended to be a three part epic, but though Part One met with approval on its release in 1944, part two did not, getting premiered in 1946 before being banned until it was generally released in 1958, ten years after Eisenstein’s death.\n\nThe film begins with one of the most opulent sequences in the history of cinema, a veritable masterpiece of stately style and edited close-ups. An almost religious, royal coming together, a sort of medieval Mafioso wedding, with all the Dons together to feign allegiance and lie through their teeth, swearing undying loyalty. Speeches are delivered in a grandiose manner, with the reactions to them every bit as studied as the speeches themselves. Never in cinema has there been a scene to embody pure majesty on earth as the scene where Ivan is showered with gold coins by two princes. Here he really does try to create himself as God’s representative here on earth, the very embodiment of the Divine Right of Kings. It also shows that power is all wrapped up neatly in bravado. As many around him doubt that he will be recognised both within and without Russia, one wise Baltic ambassador exclaims “if he is powerful enough, they will acknowledge him.” All dictators know this, even the most reluctant. Ivan subdues the arrogant Kazan people in a long siege battle, but grows ill on his return, thus causing more political wranglings which ultimately lead to personal tragedy for Ivan which finally turns him into the monster his increased power always had the potential to make him.\n\nEisenstein’s direction is undoubtedly masterful, but it’s the decors that catch the eye here; the shine on the precious metals and the sparkle of the jewels has never been more pointed than here, the robes take splendour to a new level and the use of shadows by interior lenser Moskvin is superb. The Rublevesque iconography is always in evidence, almost watching the character like Big Brother, perhaps indicative of the secret police that would be created in Part Two. Let us also not forget the contribution of the actors; Serafima Birman is truly hideous, in more ways that one, as the evil leader of the Boyars, but Cherkassov strikes real majesty as Ivan, making us happily forget that we are seeing the birth pangs of a tyrant. Brilliant film-making for sure, but the ethics behind it are somewhat shadier. Quite appropriately so, one might say."
