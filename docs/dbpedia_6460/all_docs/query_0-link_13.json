        "text": "© 2018 by James Clark\n\nSeeing Ruben Ostlund’s film, Force Majeure (2014), where a husband and father runs away from his family when faced with an avalanche about to hit (which in fact doesn’t), we were clearly in the hands of an artist who had much to say about the indispensability of courage. His recent film, The Square (2017), finds him elaborating upon the earlier film’s domestic crisis coming to bear when being safely on the sidelines (like Ostlund’s Sweden in being “neutral” in face of a violent Germany amidst World War II) sows a deadly nightmare.\n\nLet me inject some local color perhaps necessary when the locale is a backwater clouded in a distant and precious past. (Force Majeure, on the other hand, takes place in the well-known cosmopolitan French Alpine playground.) For the purpose of being on the same (target) page as Ostlund, we must know that the Swedish populace has for centuries been rigidly homogeneous as to race and culture, and overseen by the Evangelical Lutheran Church and its ardent and benevolent social priorities as to the vulnerable and incompetent. In the years immediately after World War II, the owner/ manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team (and a military zealot), namely, Conn Smythe, molded the team’s culture as opposed to appeasement, a priority one of his more virulent successors, Harold Ballard, honed into hatred of Swedish players, assumed to be cowards. One of my school chums, Don Baizley, was to go on to work as a lawyer/ hockey agent, with a special mission to introduce Swedish skills to the National Hockey League. I think. on the basis of The Square, there is little doubt that Ostlund follows Smythe and Ballard’s, not Baizley’s point of view. However, this film’s imbroglio is far more a search into difficult skills few have ever mustered, than simply kicking ass.\n\nIf, however, you were to be gullible enough to take at face value Ostlund’s prefatory “heart-to-heart” meet-the-people—about his dear old dad when a tiny lad having his father placing a name-tag and address around his neck and allowing him to prowl the City in the certainty that, were the boy to be lost, a God-fearing adult would see that he comes home, right-as-rain—you might imagine that you are about to absorb a filmic sermon for the sake of bringing back “the good old days.” “Adults are threatening; young boys rob young boys,” Ostlund complains. We should, he goes on to orate, expect everywhere to be like a pedestrian crossing where safety can be taken for granted, “a super strong agreement.” “We should be careful with each other,” adopting, as before, “humanistic values.”\n\nSoon after that visit from energies behind the camera, we have the protagonist, Christian, the director of the premier contemporary art repository of the land, enthusing, to affluent patrons, about the latest acquisition, which amounts to the theme we heard from the auteur. Neat as a pin, right? And oh, so wrong! After a late night, at the gallery, convening a dance party to prove, to everyone on hand, they have what it takes, Christian, sleeping on a sofa in his office, is roused by his meetings staffer, by the remarkably comprehensive question, “Are you awake?” Judging from the early reviews I’ve seen, the answer is a resounding no! Our protagonist, a soft, good-looking, congenial fund-raiser, seems, at the outset, destined to become a permanent fixture within a catchment rock-solid about humanistic values and gratified that, as far as they can see, the numbers will hold. Were you to wonder where amidst this winning piety the first principles of art come in, you would be part of a tiny minority the world of Sweden and the world of elsewhere have decided to ignore. That appointment he had to keep involved an American journalist, Anne (played by actress, Elizabeth Moss, who, as Peggy, in the television series, Mad Men, was prone to ask tough questions to a good-looking schmoozer boss/ slacker). With Anne that day we get barely discernible skepticism in the form of her difficulty to fathom (in one of his publications) the infrastructures of intent pertaining to mundane objects placed in an art gallery. His half-awake response reveals that he’s never done anything but winging the subject, no problem for his career amidst appeasers. The interview finds him at his confident best in response to her wondering what his biggest problem around there is. “Money, absolutely!” He goes on to bad mouth rich collectors with much more money for “cutting edge” work than he can command.\n\nMaybe the numbers do look good for him, as far as he can see; and, to insinuate that he’s on the right track, there is a cut to that very night where one supposed gem of the new didn’t get away. In the courtyard of the contemporary gallery (occupying—as if not to go too far with innovation—a former royal palace) we find a power saw slicing ancient stones to an upshot of a square into which the grooves will accommodate a neon format. We are soon brought up to speed with the nature of this expenditure, in an event to thank those lavishing significant numbers of money to bring it into town (at which a major exhibition as to its merits would be staged). Christian rehearses his address, first of all, with a view to granting the phenomenon some revelatory heft; but, that going nowhere, he frames it in the moralistic slant which is all he knows and will ever know. “The square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Those entering the square have equal rights and obligations.” No wonder, then, that the construction is accompanied by the Ave Maria! (Many Ave Marias punctuate this desperate affair!) Something a bit offbeat, however—and right to the point—is the parallel endeavor on that dark square, namely, the crane removing from its plinth the statue of a warrior in armor. The lift fails and the figure of dealing justice crashes to the cobblestones.\n\nOn the heels of that slippage, we see in action a constituency of hard drugs and hard hearts, displaying opposition to pious order far less benign than the old-timey blonde-on-blonde Kindergarten known as “free love.” As with pretty much everywhere, this is cutting edge with a vengeance which places and heritages like Stockholm cannot begin to sustain. A clique of welfare-state sacred cows amuse themselves by a time-on-their-hands, razor-sharp, circus-clown routine whereby one of the female children of the old free-love blonde “rebels” cries out on a busy square (far from a sanctuary of trust and caring where everyone has equal rights and obligations) that she is being assaulted; and then the “assailant” arrives to create a flurry of distraction for the would-be rescuer–Christian being the most recent sucker—while the “vulnerable victim” pick-pockets his wallet, phone and cufflinks. “He’s going to kill me!” was her line, followed by a professional scream. After the revolutionaries have left, Christian asks the other man who came to the rescue, “Is your heart pounding?” Then the born executive bubbles, “I just reacted!” How he reacted to being robbed proves to be a walk on a wild side he and his compatriots know nothing about, being, as they are, totally incredulous about the malignancy of the newcomers in their midst.\n\nOur protagonist regroups, along with a techie colleague, Michael, by way of an app pinpointing the location of the stolen phone in a social housing complex. They draft and print en masse a threatening letter (which Christian describes as “a bit over the top”) which one unit will comprehend, with the other tenants being bemused or annoyed. The little rep theatre promptly coughs up, to nail others, tomorrow and beyond, without the tracking apparatus or eschewing phones altogether. But one of the other tenants—new to Sweden but no stranger to assaulting Swedes and the entire Western world (in thought but perhaps never yet in deed)—chooses to mount a little jihad against those who have given him an excuse. Christian’s tone-deaf bravado in the first flush of “rescuing” the woman is all of a piece with his absence of discerning avant-garde matters during the interview with Anne. Similarly, he and Michael, on their mission of stealth to deliver the broadside, treat the matter more of a lark than a necessity. (Everything about Christian signals that the loss is easy to recoup. He’d probably get a staffer to unravel identity-theft issues. He refers to the theft of his grandfather’s cufflinks as a pretext for a joke. Though we see he’s modern to the hilt, we also see he’s lost there.) Driving to the wrong side of the tracks, they’re in accord that they should play something raunchy. A band called Justice comes over the state-of-the art sound system. “We’re going to get Justice!” Christian shouts with droll amusement. “We’re coming! We’re coming in a Tesla!” They both laugh at their supposed cleverness. The setting of that car interior, fraught with overstatement and, as ground zero is reached, self-embarrassing turmoil (Michael refusing to do the door-to-door delivery and Christian diplomatically alluding to career consequences for recalcitrance), reminds us of another driver who, from the driver’s seat, conducts a mature and fascinating investigation of passengers living in her city, namely, the nameless protagonist in Abbas Kiarostami’s Ten (2002). A significant amount of the dialogue shown while moving along the streets of Tehran pertains to her son, of about 10 or 11 years old, discharging a stream of arrogant, vicious invective about her modern, Western instincts, in strong contrast to his revered father, a dysfunctional imam separated and with no inclination or skill to contribute to the boy’s material needs (though he has much to say about his religious obligations). That vile little beast is a precursor of the venomous enemy Christian’s unfocused push-back [a poor second to the lady driver’s push-back] has unwittingly unleashed.\n\nOn arranging, at the 7-Eleven near the thieves’ abode (remarkably spiffy), for the return of the property, he encounters (at the grocery’s coffee bar) a swarthy woman nursing a coffee, resembling a couch potato without a living room. She orders him to buy her a lunch; and, as if affected by an uncontrollable tic, he does. As he proceeds, her glare never varying, she yells the command, “Hey, no onions!” That same site of blessedness hails Christian back to receive a slightly scrambled death threat. “You have insulted my family. My father thinks I’m a thief. He won’t allow me to go out to play. You will apologize to me and my family, or I will make chaos!” The executor of pinpointing the cutting edge sends Michael (a black) to the store touting luck to settle the so-called misunderstanding, in the guise of a disarming Christian. (He also deploys another quota-staff-assistant, Nicky, of some Arabic persuasion, to drive the car.) The pint-sized poison knows immediately that a ruse is underway. (By contrast, the great seer never notices the ruse about a imprisoned child, while, in a while, he’ll be howling threats at 2 in the morning in the archaic and tony stairwells of Christian’s condo.) ‘Don’t make me angry!” the beheading-besotted little creep demands. “Where’s the son-of-a-bitch? I want his phone number! Look what he did to me!” Sanguine Michael pleads for the child-soldier to calm down. But the entitlement junky replies, “I don’t have the right to be angry?” (Much later on, after Christian has been fired for not carefully attending to a PR drive on Facebook on behalf of that precious square, where a blonde homeless child explodes like a jihadist on the peace hub, the softy, along with his two young daughters, stage a pilgrimage to the supposed insulted family. A man answers the door and claims to know nothing about the incendiary letter. What he does, mysteriously, know is that the boy and is family have moved—strange, since such people don’t hop around. The man at the door is gentleness itself, and the delegation swallows everything he says. (How many viewers will have swallowed what low-key Ostlund had to say at the outset, assuring us that he’s all about “humanistic values” and nothing more?) As with that conjecture operative in the films of Kelly Reichardt, we see that the salt of the earth in that doorway has finessed a widespread family secret, to proceed with problematic equivocation. (I find it very absorbing that none of the reviewers of the film will touch this matter. Self-censorship being very Swedish. But here, to our delight, a Swede being a true artist of dramatic mood.)\n\nOver and above the satirical shocks provided by The Square, there is its unspoken illumination of the lacuna of heeding intuitive demands which contradict conventional wisdom. Hence the main focus comes down to studying whether the pratfalls allow of rallies—a reflection in the moment of the action and also long after we have left the theatre. An early awakening to the hardballs coming our way in a context of easy-does-it occurs during a luncheon where Christian previews the conceptual show for those who contributed to outspending some investment banker and are subtly expected to mow down other rivals in the future. The celebrity chef bringing off the sumptuous meal to an audience perhaps feeling a bit blasé, begins to tell them something remarkable about the sauce; but the gathering—perhaps fortified by those periodic parties letting them believe they’re wild and crazy—noisily (like their grandchildren) head for the tables. The slighted artiste ushers forth an assassin’s war cry which gives us all something to think about. Chastening, yes, for a few resented seconds; but “wild and crazy” forever! Another troubling misfire occurs during the little opportunist’s nearly hysterical ruckus in Christian’s stairwell. Hearing the trespasser’s howl once too often, he charges past his precision-perfect Josef Albers painting (“Homage to the Square”) in his hallway, out to the noisy spleen and shoves the rude invader down a flight of stairs. The rest of the night the sounds of “Help!” deck the halls and keep the whole building awake. The counter-attack had stifled the trash-talk; but Christian had nowhere to go from there. Near dawn he wades into the building’s garbage bin to find the letter he had decided not to reply to, with the complaint and the email address, in order to discharge what he concludes to be the necessity to apologize, in a YouTube. The most egregious of the shortfalls occurs at the premiere dinner party celebrating what has been tricked out as “cutting edge.” After treading a red carpet amidst much press and television photography, the donors are seated for a cordon bleu experience to be prefaced by something marvellous in the way of performance art, commensurate to ease the pretenders to youthfulness into young-at-heart crazy spending. Since, with the exception of cardiac-risk Saturday Night Fevers, nothing moves amidst the collection and, as the PR team puts it, “the culture vultures,” you can see the point of this choice of entertainment as indeed looking ahead to more splash on the horizon from the patrons; but also being a bracer for the limp staff. “Seventy being the new Forty,” the gallery MC intones, when all are seated. “A wild beast can readily detect fear in its midst. Staying calm, you stand a better chance of living to see another day…” That sounding even easier than dancing, the recent bohemians can’t wait for the game. We had been treated, within the goings-on of the museum, to quick cuts to a muscular dude in a video, panting like a lion and for all the world resembling a Li’l Abner with underdeveloped legs and surly disposition. He makes his entrance on all-fours, shirtless and with arm-crutches by which he proceeds like a gorilla. The crutches garner a warm Pavlovian applause. But the performer, as with all the schemes in this ferocious movie ironically prating about gentleness, has not been energetically vetted, and the avoidance experts come in for an unbecoming exposure. By degrees the entertainer becomes less entertaining. After seeming simply goofy in making the rounds of the seating, he confronts an American artist we’ve seen in earlier moments, who is currently showing an installation of checkerboard, pyramidal sand piles. musses his hair and pops a serviette over it. Perhaps lost in translation (but more likely just not a fan of silence) the artist protests, first in a friendly and then in an unfriendly way, eliciting from the fountain of good cheer a pummelling and being chased out of the room. (This would not be the first intrusion into that artist’s enjoying his visit; but it was the first intrusion he resented. A few days before, we saw him at a public interview at the gallery, trying to explain that his usage of minerals diverges from that of the long-gone Robert Smithson’s insofar as he eschews the harshness of the older artist’s outlook. The [doubtfully] exciting and demanding issues there, however, do not happen, because one of the precious culture vultures is in the throes of Tourette’s syndrome. He yells at the blonde moderator, “Show us your breasts!” The first tack from the podium is unflappable serenity. On with the show, she asks how he would define his tangent. Before he can speak, the outspoken spectator cries out, “Garbage!” At this point, his wife blithely explains his craziness and a typical Swede adds, “This man is suffering…” [putting himself self-servingly opposed to hard Smithson]. The softie on the stage quickly extends a special welcome to the heckler, being, in fact, like the mealy-mouth just heard-from, a subscriber to a gauzy blur of infantile sufficiency on the order of sand-piles versus rock. The excuse for coherent discourse slides along with punctuations like, “Fuck off! Show us your tits!” Before that communal commitment to letting everything slide, we had the president of the PR firm at the beginning of the treacherous trek, holding a howling infant and supposedly thinking straight about what he was paid to do. In subsequent meetings two clueless millennial underlings take over, hot to trot for social media fame. A measure of Ostlund’s resolve and screenwriting wit can be engaged by noticing that the term, Tourette’s, closely shares with turrets [those castle heights our complement here insists on investing to ridiculous lengths].) On enjoying seeing the effete gathering now petrified that real assault is in the air, the non-suicide-bomber begins to run his hands through the lovely hair of one of the few young women (perhaps a family stand-in; perhaps a trophy-wife). She looks away from her molester and in a terrified voice calls on her consort. He doesn’t respond. The whole room resembles Sleeping Beauty after a blood-thirsty shock. He drags her across the floor and begins to rape her; and only then do we see one octogenarian intercede, followed by the whole male assembly stomping and smashing the law of the jungle. One of the other abortive bids for vitality consists of Anne and her pet gorilla, somehow tranquillized; and her critique—after a night of Christian with her in her bed capped by a tug-of-war with his condom, brimming with paternity law suspicions— as to exploiting his princely social status to make “conquests” (a charge he is proud to admit). (When all is said and done, she counts herself as “fascinated” by this element of character.) But the crowning episode of this stuttering in the throes of a consummation painfully out of reach occurs after the protagonist’s relegation to unemployed single dad. He is, one night, a spectator in temporary stands at the neon square having been transformed from divinity school to the site of a schoolgirls’ (his elder daughter involved) cheerleading contest. The girls display a rousing instance of daring, coordination and cooperation, only to have its tinctures of disinterestedness dribble away in the night. (At the museum’s office a week or so before, Michael reads to staffers that the mighty mouse plans to smash Christian’s nose when he catches up with him. A young, long-term Swedish woman blurts out, “They should be dead!” A cheerleader looking for a winner.) The quota-paved coach of Christian’s daughter’s squad counsels using the lousy first-stage score to put forward a great result drenched in resentment. (That swings us back to the little home-invader, comforted by an adversary who is not without a whack of resentment himself, accommodating [appeasing] on the order of, “Apologize to me, and I’ll go.”) At his press-conference to formalize his departure, a resentment expert takes the mike and tells him he should pledge solidarity with those without a voice. Then we see a tabloid where the kid and an imam have a ball. The sand installation—by the facile desert accommodator who flinched—becomes a victim of a careless janitor, but of minor concern to Christian who orders an underling to patch it up. This coincides with one of the frequent passages of “Ave Maria,” to add to the incursions and impertinences somebody ought to wake up about; but won’t."
