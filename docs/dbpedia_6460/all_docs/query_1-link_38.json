        "text": "Pueblo Deco was a flamboyant, short-lived architectural style that fused the spirit of the Native American cultures of the Southwest with the exuberance of Art Deco. Pueblo Deco appeared at a time when movie-mad communities were constructing film palaces based on exotic models such as Moorish mosques and Chinese pavilions.\n\nNative American motifs appeared in only a handful of theaters; of those few, the KiMo is the undisputed king.\n\nVirtual Tour\n\nTake a quick virtual tour of the historic KiMo Theatre, with the theater manager as your guide. From the recreation of the neon sign to the original projection booth, learn fun facts about the building and view historic photos you may have never seen before. Get an up-close look of this local treasure that has evolved alongside our ever-changing City. Once you Meet the KiMo, you'll Love the KiMo. (Virtual Tour).\n\nFounding Family\n\nThe genius behind the KiMo was Oreste Bachechi, a motivated entrepreneur from humble origins. Oreste Bachechi came to the United States in 1885 and set up a business in a tent near the railroad tracks in Albuquerque.\n\nBachechi's fortunes expanded with the city's growth; he became a liquor dealer and proprietor of a grocery store while his wife Maria ran a dry goods store in the Elms Hotel. By 1919, the Bachechi Amusement Association operated the Pastime Theatre with Joe Barnett. In 1925, Oreste Bachechi decided to achieve \"an ambition, a dream that has been long in realization,\" by building his own theater, one that would stand out among the Greek temples and Chinese pavilions of contemporary movie mania.\n\nOpening Night\n\nOn opening night, an overflow crowd watched performances by representatives from nearby Indian pueblos and reservations. The performers, reported the New Mexico State Tribune in an advance story, included \"numerous prominent tribesman of the Southwest who will perform for the audience mystic rites never before seen on the stage.\""
