        "text": "The Manhattan skyline will gain an unusual skyscraper crown under a plan announced last week to renovate a 35-story office tower at 475 Park Avenue South, at 32d Street.\n\nCohen Brothers Realty Corporation, owner of the building, said it planned to begin work on the the builing within six weeks. The most striking result will be a crown of metal grill work around the building's roof, illuminated by colored lights. Fox & Fowle is the architectural firm designing these and other changes.\n\nCohen Brothers said the building's lobby will also be extensively rehabilitated. Gray, maroon and rose-colored marble wall panels will be installed, and new glass walls will brighten its entry arcade.\n\n''This will upgrade the building for the next 20 years,'' said Charles Steven Cohen, the president of Cohen Brothers. Jack Sotnikow & Associates, a New York mechanical engineering firm, has designed a new cooling tower and extensive improvements in the building's heating systems.\n\nThe building, with 370,000 square feet of office space, was built by Cohen Brothers in 1970 and was originally intended as a residential highrise. That plan changed during construction, Mr. Cohen said, and the building remains the only office tower built on lower Park Avenue since the end of World War II.\n\nCurrent tenants include Reed Holdings, a publishing firm, the Life Insurance Council of New York, the European American Bank and several other advertising, insurance and financial-services companies.\n\nMr. Cohen said 35,000 to 40,000 square feet in the building will be vacated and put on the market for new tenants over the next six months. He added, however, that the renovation was being planned to enhance its long-term value rather than to attract tenants in the current, highly competive, market.\n\nThe planned work on the building is expected to take a year to 14 months to complete."
