A romantic comedy (or rom com) is defined as \"a movie or play that deals with love in a light, humorous way.\" When looking back at the early formula that found its way to the screen, we can look to the ultimate romantic: William Shakespeare. Plays like Much Ado About Nothing and A Midsummer Night's Dream gave the basic setup of early (and many modern) romantic comedies: Two people meet, have a conflict in their way, and reunite to live happily ever after.\n\nBut identifying the first true rom com film is tough. But two movies that came out in 1924 followed the basic premise laid out above: Sherlock Jr. (starring the silent film star Buster Keaton) and Girl Shy. But these were silent films, so all dialogue was captured with title cards that appeared between each scene of actions—which means the true cleverness and comedy in the characters' dialogue could not be captured until 1928, when \"talkies\" took the world by storm.\n\nAn early form of romantic comedies was called \"comedies of manners.\" This is when an rich person would find love with a non-wealthy person. A great example of this would be It Happened One Night (1934). A wealthy woman (Claudette Colbert) runs away and takes up with a handsome out-of-work newspaper reporter (Clark Gable), who needs a story. The movie won five Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay). This genre in particular told Depression-era audiences that money doesn't buy everything—it gave people hope.\n\nNext on our journey? Screwball comedies. The phrase comes from a surprising place: baseball. Pitchers threw screwballs a.k.a. balls that moved in unexpected ways. Similarly, screwball comedies are films that moved in unexpected directions. These movies can be identified by slapstick scenes and fast-paced, witty dialogue. Think Katharine Hepburn rom coms like Bringing Up Baby (1938) and The Philadelphia Story (1940). Another cool thing about this 1930s subgenre? The female is the protagonist and the hero. This is her story, and she drives it.\n\nOn our road to rom coms of today, we'll stop off at the sex comedy. Spanning from the '50s to the early '70s, the movies here focused on the differences between men and women. Often, the conflicts began with two professional rivals. They were often pitted again each other in a fierce competition that eventually led to sparks flying. Classic battle of the sexes comedies include the Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy classic Desk Set (1957), the Rock Hudson-Doris Day hit Lover Come Back (1961), and the very on-the-nose Battle of the Sexes (1960). These tonal changes happened for several reasons: The sexual research done by Alfred Kinsey opened up the conversation that women do have sex drives and engage in premarital sex, Playboy magazine came out in 1953, which gave men guides to developing relationships with women, and the industry's strict moral production code ended and gave way to the rating system, which meant less censorship in films. All of these elements coming together could easily explain the momentum in the growth of sex comedies.\n\nNext, the sexual revolution of the '60s brought about the radical romantic comedies of the '70s. People stopped viewing romantic comedies the way they had previously. Now, men and women could speak freely about sex and love without the innuendos and ploys often found in earlier films. These new movies were cynical and wondered whether or not true love existed at all. Happily ever after was not required in a radical romantic comedy. Movies like Annie Hall (1977) focused on personal happiness, the needs of one's self, and a realization that romantic love does not solve all problems.\n\nFinally, we land in the neotraditional romantic comedy. These films are the opposite of the radical romantic comedy because they focus on compatibility and deemphasize sex. Here, love is transparent—compromises are made on both sides to make the relationship work. There are often self-referential moments that nod to the romantic comedies of yesteryear. Think about the passing discussion of An Affair to Remember (1957) in Sleepless in Seattle (1993), for example. Modern movies in this genre continue to this day. (Trainwreck (2015) is easily considered a neotraditional romantic comedy.)\n\nThroughout film's history, romantic comedies hold up a mirror to the society in which we live. Whether the story takes place in the modern world we inhabit, a futuristic planet, or an era long past, the moment a movie is created, it shows the current society's general feelings on love. And though the genre has taken different forms through the years, there is one comforting thing that has always stayed the same: We're a society that believes in love."
