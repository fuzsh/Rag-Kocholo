        "text": "“Lessons of Darkness”: Werner Herzog’s Absurdist Studies in the Human Condition\n\nTaught by Paul Wright, Ph.D., Main Line Classical Academy\n\nWeaned on a rejection of Germany’s troubled wartime past and bedeviled by Germany’s partition in the Cold War, the iconoclastic filmmakers of the “New German Cinema” helped usher in a period of intense cultural renewal. Amid this cohort, Werner Herzog charted his own unique path through a series of often absurdist films that continue to resonate today.\n\nOur course will begin with Herzog’s anarchic early feature, Even Dwarfs Started Small (1970). A study in social rebellion in the face of institutionalized conformity, the tale builds on older films like Tod Browning’s Freaks, blending an exploitation sensibility with social critique. We then turn to one of the director’s collaborations with mercurial actor Klaus Kinski in Herzog’s surreal take on Spanish colonialism, Aguirre, the Wrath of God (1972). We’ll journey to Herzog’s funhouse version of modern America in Stroszek (1977), as strange a “road picture” as one will encounter, following a Berlin street performer in search of new horizons in the United States. We’ll close with Herzog’s 2016 documentary, Lo & Behold: Reveries of the Connected World. A thoughtful confrontation with the effects of the internet, artificial intelligence, and robotics on consciousness, Herzog’s film anticipates our current anxieties over emerging technologies that portend a redefinition of our own humanity.\n\nEach of these films reminds us that, from his earliest efforts to his most recent, Herzog has explored unsettling paradoxes in the very project of being human, especially when we presume to be in control of our world, our identity, and our destiny.\n\nIl Maestro: The Carnivalesque Cinema of Federico Fellini\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program,\n\nTemple University\n\nFederico Fellini created an inimitable cinematic style that combined surreal carnival with incisive social criticism, opening doors for later filmmakers such as Robert Altman, Pedro Almodovar, and Terry Gilliam. To use one of his favorite images, he was a captivating ringmaster whose circus was the human comedy, in which he explored such themes as the essential isolation of man and his penchant for destroying the paths to his salvation; the nature of a corrupt, pleasure-oriented society; the interplay between life and art; the role of women; and, most notably, the mystery of identity.\n\nIn depicting these themes, Fellini fashioned a new level of screen language by integrating realistic plots with evocative symbols, in the manner of Joyce and Proust. By doing so, Fellini, the poet-philosopher, tapped into a large portion of the cinema's vast but generally unrealized potential to objectify subjective states, and vice versa. His rich frescoes and intoxicating images render a stylized world in which memories, dreams, and fantasies are all interwoven and made significant by the imagination of the artist.\n\nFellini also had an important influence on acting technique, for within a realistic context he evokes highly stylized performances from his actors, most notably Giulietta Masina and Marcello Mastroianni. As critic Foster Hirsch has observed, \"In his own way (Fellini) combines the two strains that have always dominated Italian movies: the epic tradition, with its fondness for spectacle and operatic gesture, and the (neorealist) humanist tradition, with its deep feeling for the outcast and the oppressed.\"\n\nIn his early career, Fellini was both a screenwriter for neorealist pioneer Roberto Rossellini and a newspaper caricaturist in postwar Rome–competing influences he would bring together with startling results. With this in mind, the course begins with Fellini's neorealist apprenticeship, in which he co-wrote the screenplays to Rome, Open City (1945) and Paisa (1946) before co-directing, with Alberto Lattuada, his first feature film, Variety Lights (1950). Throughout the 1950s, Fellini would create a series of brilliant works, beginning with his first solo feature, The White Sheik (1951), followed by I Vitelloni (1953), La Strada (1954), and Nights of Cabiria (1956)–the latter two signaling a gradual movement away from neorealism and toward a more symbolic aesthetic–before concluding with his seminal achievement, La Dolce Vita (1959).\n\nIl Maestro: The Carnivalesque Cinema of Federico Fellini, Pt. 2\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program,\n\nTemple University\n\nFederico Fellini created an inimitable cinematic style that combined surreal carnival with incisive social criticism, opening doors for later filmmakers such as Robert Altman, Pedro Almodvar, and Terry Gilliam.

Following this masterpiece, Fellini would create a series of brilliant films throughout the 1960s, and continue this work through the next two decades. Juliet of the Spirits (1965), Fellini's first film in color, is a non-narrative work concerned with memory and obsession about a woman (Giulietta Masina) who collapses into a world of fantasy under the pressure of a painful external reality. Fellini Satyricon (1969), in which the director created a unique audio-visual language to present a personalized version of Petronius's poem suggests the continuity of depravity throughout human history. Roma (1972) is an impressionistic study of Rome that combined stylized documentary with the director's own memories of the city of his youth. Amarcord (1973) is a funny, moving remembrance of things past in Rimini, the director's birthplace. City of Women (1980) offers an intelligent, fanciful vision of contemporary sexual warfare within the framework of its male protagonist's dreams. Ginger and Fred (1986) is a hilarious satire of contemporary television and the cult of instant celebrity, while Intervista (1987) is a wistful, engaging personal journey through the director's career at Cinecitta. Finally, the class will bid arrivederci to Il Maestro with his last film, The Voice of the Moon (1990), which returns to the realm of his provincial youth, and in so doing makes a comedic, if pessimistic, plea for a quieter and less technocratic world.\n\nAkira Kurosawa: East Meets West (Spring 2011)\n\nTaught by Paul Wright, Ph.D., Department of English, Cabrini College\n\nAkira Kurosawa is the director perhaps most singularly responsible for introducing non-Western film to American audiences, and is arguably the foreign filmmaker who had the greatest influence on Hollywood's first blockbuster auteurs, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg.\n\nYet despite his now iconic status as one of the luminaries of world cinema, over the course of his long career, Kurosawa regularly met with criticism in his native Japan—it was said that he was not “Japanese” enough and was too much a hostage to Western styles and genres.\n\nIn this course, we will try to understand Kurosawa's films as a skillful and increasingly brave response to this caricature of his work. In Stray Dog and High & Low, Kurosawa shrewdly blends film noir and the harsh realities of post-war Japanese society. In Throne of Blood, Kurosawa adapts Shakespeare's Macbeth to the samurai ethos, and in Yojimbo (template for Sergio Leone's Fistful of Dollars), Kurosawa is at his most inventive, merging the conventions of the American western and the samurai film to astonishing effect.\n\nAkira Kurosawa: East Meets West (Spring 2014)\n\nTaught by Paul Wright, Ph.D., Department of English, Cabrini College\n\nAkira Kurosawa is the director perhaps most singularly responsible for introducing non-Western film to American audiences, and is arguably the foreign filmmaker who had the greatest influence on Hollywood's first blockbuster auteurs, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Yet despite his now-iconic status as one of the luminaries of world cinema, over the course of his long career, Kurosawa regularly met with criticism in his native Japan—it was said that he was not 'Japanese' enough, and was too much a hostage to Western styles and genres.\n\nIn this course, we will try to understand Kurosawa's films as skillful and increasingly brave responses to this caricature of his work. Ikiru (1952), one of Kurosawa's first masterpieces, cross-pollinates Eastern and Western (as well as pre-modern and modern) conceptions of mortality. In two adaptations of Russian classics dear to Kurosawa's heart, Dostoyevsky's The Idiot and Gorky's The Lower Depths, Kurosawa (in 1951 and 1957, respectively) again threads the needle between Western and Japanese sensibilities. Finally, in 1963's High and Low (shown on the big screen), Kurosawa shrewdly blends film noir and the harsh realities of post-war Japanese society.\n\nPlease note: Though a course on Kurosawa's earlier works has been offered under this title before, three of the four films to be covered in this class are different than in prior iterations. As such, it may be of interest to those who have taken the previous version.\n\nAkira Kurosawa: Tragedy and Brilliance\n\nTaught by Paul Wright, Ph.D., Department of English, Cabrini College\n\nBy 1970, Japanese master Akira Kurosawa had experienced two devastating setbacks. His participation in Tora! Tora! Tora! ended with his ignominious dismissal as co-director of the Japanese-American epic about Pearl Harbor. In the wake of that disappointment, Kurosawa collaborated with three other luminaries of Japanese cinema to form a new production team, but his Dodes'ka-den, which was to be the first in a wave of new works from this “Committee of the Four Knights,” was a critical and financial failure. A year later, Kurosawa attempted suicide, his career and life seemingly in tatters.\n\nWhat is often overlooked, though, is how Kurosawa rebounded from this mid-career nadir. In this course, we examine the brilliance of late-period Kurosawa, starting with Dersu Uzala (1975), Kurosawa’s triumphant return to filmmaking after a five-year hiatus that won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. In 1980, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola helped Kurosawa secure funding for the acclaimed Kagemusha; in 1985, Kurosawa once more blended Shakespeare and samurai in Ran, his masterful take on King Lear. We close, as Kurosawa did, with his final films, including the deeply personal Dreams (1990).\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: The Best of the Rest (Summer 2011)\n\nTaught by Andrew J. Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nHitchcock’s films are like Shakespeare’s sonnets and Sinatra’s songs: even the lesser known of the lot are well worth experiencing. While past courses have covered Hitch’s early years, his political films produced during World War II, and the celebrated movies made at the height of his popularity, this one explores some of the hidden gems in the Master of Suspense’s filmography—and North by Northwest (1959).\n\nWhile far from obscure, these pictures are rarely given the pride of place enjoyed by the filmmaker’s best-known productions. Though these films are black-and-white, and some feature minor stars like Farley Granger and Joseph Cotten, make no mistake: Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), and Strangers on a Train (1951)—as well as the aforementioned Technicolor classic—are thoroughly Hitchcockian. While no single film has every one of the auteur’s cinematic trademarks, this group collectively touches all the bases: mistaken identity, danger in everyday places, (blonde) women in trouble, Machiavellian matrons, and, of course, the director’s iconic cameos.\n\nSo join us to learn more about these often overlooked treasures. In doing so, renew your appreciation for the talent Hitchcock and his noted collaborators like Thornton Wilder, Ben Hecht, Raymond Chandler, and Dimitri Tiomkin brought to these films—and see each of them on the big screen.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: The Best of the Rest (Summer 2015)\n\nTaught by Andrew J.

Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nAlfred Hitchcock did not simply emerge from the primordial cinematic ooze a fully-formed filmmaker, in the mid-1950s, to create classics like Rear Window, Vertigo, and North by Northwest. Indeed, by that time Hitch had been directing pictures in Europe and the U.S. for nearly thirty years, over the course of which he developed his signature style and formulated his thematic approach to filmmaking.\n\nWhile this class does not venture all the way back to Hitchcock's German films of the 1920s, it does cover some of the director's better known British work, such as The 39 Steps (1935), and The Lady Vanishes (1938), as well as his initial forays into Hollywood. These include his very first American film, Rebecca (1940), and the underappreciated Spellbound (1945), a tale of psychoanalysis and murder, with sequences designed by Salvador Dali. Both productions were supervised by David O. Selznick, the man who brought Hitchcock over from England, and then nearly sent him back.\n\nThese early pictures (all of which will be screened in the theater) contain some of the elements for which Hitch would later become famous: (blonde) women in trouble, danger in everyday places, Machiavellian matrons, and of course, his iconic cameos despite being made by the Master of Suspense when he was but a craftsman.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: The Early Years at PMA\n\nTaught by Andrew J.

Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nAs you might expect, the director who famously declared, \"A lot of movies are about life, mine are like a slice of cake,\" is not going to be too interested in engaging serious ideological or political questions in his films. However, as the filmmaker who also declared of audiences, \"Give them pleasure—the same pleasure they have when they wake up from a nightmare,\" Alfred Hitchcock was not going to shy away from stories about terrorism and international intrigue, either.\n\nBut is it a mistake to conclude that the Master of Suspense's raison d'être was the only motivation behind his decision to set a number of films in the realm of espionage and a time of world war? Is it possible that even Hitchcock's skill as an auteur was unable to overpower the political undercurrents in source material by such writers as Dorothy Parker and John Steinbeck? Might the Neutrality Acts of the 1930s have provoked the director's uncharacteristic political engagement?\n\nWe consider these questions and more while examining some of Hitchcock's more overtly political films, including Foreign Correspondent (1940), Saboteur (1942), and Lifeboat (1944).\n\nAlfred Hitchcock: The Political Films (Summer 2014)\n\nTaught by Andrew J.

He would go on to become one of Hollywood’s most literary figures, writing and directing films remembered more often for their screenplays than their cinematography. Yet Mankiewicz was a master of film form with a style all his own. His movies are psychologically driven, using innovative sound and image techniques to depict self-aware and confident characters from different perspectives. His stories frequently move back and forth in time, not just to provide exposition, but to offer multiple (and equally valid) points of view, prompting philosopher Gilles Deleuze to call Mankiewicz, “undoubtedly the greatest flashback author.”\n\nAlthough he worked in a variety of genres, Mankiewicz consistently created capable and witty female characters by writing scripts attending to the interior lives of women, whom he refused to condemn for their choices, even when convention would seem to demand it. That audiences sympathize with these women is in part due to the luck Mankiewicz had with casting: this summer alone we will witness his talent directing Bette Davis, Ava Gardner, Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Ann Sothern, Jeanne Crain, and Linda Darnell.\n\nIn addition to being some of Mankiewicz’s best work, the films covered in this course—A Letter to Three Wives (1949), All About Eve (1950), The Barefoot Contessa (1954), and Suddenly, Last Summer (1959)—all explore society’s expectations for women in post-war America. They also demonstrate the scope of Mankiewicz’s ability, moving from melodrama to comedy to thriller, but always with an eye for sophistication. His attention to Hollywood elegance paid off—Mankiewicz won the Oscar for Best Director for A Letter to Three Wives and Best Screenplay the following year for All About Eve. Indeed, his luster has not faded; the director’s films bring as much pleasure and laughter today as they did in Hollywood’s Golden Age, when Mankiewicz reigned.\n\nAlone in the Dark: The Films of Lars von Trier\n\nTaught by Chris Long, M.A., Film Critic and Author\n\nEver since a young Lars Trier added the ostentatious “von” to his name, the Danish provocateur’s career has been marked by a series of controversies and contrasts. After the ornate formalism of his early work, he took a “vow of chastity” as a founding member of the Dogme 95 film movement—a movement he abandoned after one movie—and eventually stripped his aesthetic to the bone with the chalk-outline theater sets of Dogville (2003) and Manderlay (2005), only to switch tracks again to craft the stylized, high-definition flourishes of Antichrist (2009) and Melancholia (2011).\n\nHe offers still more contrasts. Von Trier’s stories of persecuted women (including his 1996 international breakthrough hit, Breaking the Waves) have earned him the label “misogynist” from detractors, though his films have produced three Best Actress winners at Cannes, including Bjork (Dancer in the Dark), with whom he had a bitter feud. Von Trier’s very public battles with depression and a host of phobias have produced several bleak visions, yet also some unlikely comedies, including the pitch-black humor of the hospital series-turned-film The Kingdom (1994), spawned by his fears of the medical community. To some, Von Trier is wallowing in human suffering; to others, he is working out his neuroses in perverse, yet invigorating, ways.\n\nVon Trier’s films can certainly be challenging emotional experiences that sometimes feature graphic sexual or violent content, and his mordant sense of humor may offend some sensibilities. Yet he is also a unique visionary whose slippery body of work is both unforgettable and undefinable, making him a perfect subject for closer study.\n\nJoin us for discussions of films such as Europa (1991), The Kingdom, Dancer in the Dark (2000), and Antichrist. If you do, we can’t guarantee you won’t be offended, but we can promise you’ll see films unlike any others.\n\nArthur Penn: Chronicling the Outsiders\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program,\n\nTemple University\n\nFrom Billy the Kid to Helen Keller, from Jack Crabb to Bonnie and Clyde, the films of Arthur Penn explore the lives of memorable characters who struggle to find a way to connect and communicate with the world from which they are so mercilessly alienated. His portraits of outsiders are all the more indelible for they mirror the years of turbulence that afflicted American society—the 1960s and 1970s—in which the tensions between youth and age, poor and rich, peace and war, were ever present. And amidst this period, Penn was one of its more thoughtful, perceptive chroniclers, for as he once observed, \"A society would be wise to pay attention to the people who do not belong if it wants to find out . . . where it is failing.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, Penn was at the forefront of a new generation of directors trained in theater and television who revitalized American filmmaking at a time of crisis in the industry, and who bridged the gap between the old studio era of Hollywood and the new Hollywood \"auteur\" cinema influenced by the French New Wave.\n\nPenn's abiding concern with the outsider, and its attendant themes—the fragile, precarious social order that erupts all too frequently into violence, the disparity between image and reality, the conflict between impulse and rationality—resonate to this day, and are expressed through a brilliant cinematic style that combines American and European influences. Such a legacy makes Arthur Penn, who died last year, one of the most complex, interesting, and vital directors in American cinema.\n\nAmong the films we will watch and discuss are The Left-Handed Gun, The Miracle Worker, The Chase, Bonnie and Clyde, Little Big Man, Night Moves, and Four Friends.\n\nAscending from Darkness: The Films of Stanley Kubrick\n\nTaught by Marc Lapadula, M.F.A., Screenwriting Program, Yale University\n\nStanley Kubrick has earned his reputation based on only a dozen films over nearly five decades. What is it about the nightmare worlds he depicts that cause audiences to find his work so compelling?\n\nHis ambitious masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, revolutionized the medium by exploding past technical limitations and inspiring a new generation of artists to facilitate even bolder innovation. But Kubrick's overall contributions are much more than those of a supremely sophisticated visual stylist. His films, no matter what their genre, force viewers to confront startling facets of our world. Additional films examined include: Lolita, Dr. Strangelove, and The Shining.\n\nBearing Witness: Elia Kazan and the 1950s\n\nTaught by Andrew J. Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nHollywood in the 1950s was pushing bounds and running scared, and no single filmmaker was more central to both impulses than Elia Kazan. The industry tested the limits of film content in large part due to a combination of European influences and domestic competition, most notably from television. Kazan, along with Tennessee Williams, led the charge with a pair of steamy, Southern-set films: A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and Baby Doll (1956).\n\nYet, at the same time some filmmakers felt sufficiently emboldened to challenge censors in the industry and beyond, large swaths of Hollywood were cowed by the zealous investigations of the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC). Among creative talent, ideological lines were drawn and seldom crossed, though Elia Kazan was a rare, notable, and especially controversial exception. In all likelihood neither as altruistic as he declared, nor as sinister as others proclaimed, Kazan's testimony made him a pariah to many for decades to come.\n\nYet, regardless of what one thinks of this episode, it was the reputed inspiration for two of the era's most politically potent films, made by Kazan in collaboration with writer and fellow friendly witness Budd Schulberg: On the Waterfront (1954) and A Face in the Crowd (1957). While the allegorical nature of Waterfront, with its commission hearings, divided loyalties, and corrupt union, is clear, that of the latter film, with its withering critique of populism and canny depiction of a menacing demagogue is less so, and all the more interesting for it.\n\nJoin us to learn about and through four provocative films that are a substantial part of, in Martin Scorsese's words, 'the lifelong lovers' quarrel conducted with his adopted country by a ferociously gifted immigrant named Elia Kazan.'\n\nPlease note: Class screenings will take place in the theater.\n\nBold and Bawdy: The Films of Almodovar\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage, Temple University\n\nSince his career began in 1980, Pedro Almodovar has become Spain's preeminent director and one of the most distinctive and popular filmmakers in the world. His trademark blend of highly passionate melodrama, licentious comedy, vivid color schemes, and strong female characters was developed in a series of films Almodovar made over the course of the 1980s. This cycle reached its zenith in 1988 with Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (shown on 35mm), a film that brought the writer/director international acclaim, including awards at the Toronto and Venice film festivals and an Oscar nomination.\n\nThroughout his work, Almodovar has created career-defining roles for a number of talented actors with whom he has made multiple pictures, including Carmen Maura, Antonio Banderas, Penelope Cruz, and Victoria Abril. This course will examine the career of this prolific director, who is both playful and profound, and include discussions of such films as Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!, High Heels, All About My Mother, Talk to Her, Volver, and Broken Embraces.\n\nChance Encounters, Permanent Consequences: The Cinema of Krzysztof Kieslowski\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program,\n\nTemple University\n\nA filmmaker preoccupied with similarities and paradoxes, Krzysztof Kieslowski's own career evolved over the years from one centered on political realities to one of metaphysical contemplation. Upon closer examination, however, both ends of his cinematic journey share a focus on individuals struggling to reconcile daily life with its cultural myths—be they communist propaganda, Biblical proverbs, or French revolutionary slogans.\n\nIf the people and characters of his films are rarely explicitly aware of their ideological concerns, viewers often are, through Kieslowski's filmmaking savvy and marketing conceits. A powerful storyteller, Kieslowski undermines the ordered world of his documentary-like descriptions with the complex, often disillusioning lives of his central protagonists—portraits that alternate between pessimistic deconstruction and an affection for human resilience.\n\nIn addition to considering some of his early feature films, such as Camera Buff (1979), Blind Chance (1981), A Short Film About Killing (1988), and the Decalogue (1989)—his series made for Polish television based on the Ten Commandments—we will turn to Kieslowski's more famous, and equally celebrated, films: The Double Life of Veronique (1992) and the Three Colors Trilogy representing the French flag: Blue (1993) for liberty, White (1994) for equality, and Red (1994) for fraternity, the last three of which are resolutely interpreted within the framework of the interior life.\n\nIn many ways, this cycle can be seen as an artful summation of his career since it offers: an emphasis on the individual's life and his or her relationship to an ideal; a nuanced and even playful approach to narrative; the paradoxes of chance and fate; the interconnectedness of lives; and the central importance of art and performance, both public and private.\n\nChance Encounters, Permanent Consequences: The Cinema of Krzysztof Kieslowski, Pt. 2\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nA filmmaker preoccupied with similarities and paradoxes, Krzysztof Kieslowski's own career evolved over the years from one centered on political realities to one of metaphysical contemplation. A powerful storyteller, Kieslowski undermines the ordered world of his documentary-like depictions with the complex, often disillusioning lives of his central protagonists—portraits that alternate between pessimistic deconstruction and an affection for human resilience. Nowhere is this more evident than in The Double Life of Veronique (1991) and the Three Colors trilogy (1993/1994).\n\nThe Double Life of Veronique, written by Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, blends a powerful combination of simplicity and complexity, exploring such themes as identity, love, fate, human intuition, and free will, through the characters of Weronika, a Polish choir soprano, and her double, Veronique, a French music teacher. The two women do not know each other, and yet they share a bond, both mysterious and emotional, that transcends language and geography. Kieslowski defined the subject matter of this film by stating that “the realm of superstitions, fortune-telling, presentiments, intuition, dreams, all this is the inner life of a human being, and all this is the hardest thing to film.” Remarkably, Kieslowski is able to do just that, through the highly stylized cinematography of Slawomir Idziak, who uses bold colors and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere, along with the evocative music of Zbigniew Preisner (given the fictional name of Van den Budenmayer in the film), which becomes an integral narrative element. As a result, The Double Life of Veronique encourages uncertainty and analysis in its examination of coincidences, fate, parallel lives, and human relationships, creating a mysterious, spiritual world that affirms Kieslowski's belief that there must be more beyond what we can see.\n\nSuch preoccupations are also at work in the Three Colors trilogy, comprised of Blue (1993), White (1994), and Red (1994), the colors of the French flag. The narrative of each film is loosely based on the three political ideals in the motto of the French Republic: liberty, equality, and fraternity. But as with Kieslowski's treatment of the Ten Commandments in the Dekalog, the dramatization of these principles is often ambiguous and ironic. The trilogy shifts from high tragedy to low comedy to intense drama in a world of happenstance. By turns poignant, sensuous, haunting, and mysterious, the trilogy also offers a portrait of anxiety, skepticism, and hope about contemporary Europe itself.\n\nBlue, starring Juliette Binoche, begins with a car crash on a remote highway, witnessed by a teenage boy who will later make contact with the only survivor. The fatalities from the car crash are a celebrated composer and his young child, while the composer's wife, badly hurt, remains alive. When she finally recovers, she sells everything she owns, and lives as a recluse in Paris. The color blue dominates the film's palette, from the light of the city at dusk to the glow from the swimming pool she visits to exercise, and to exorcize the demons of her memory.\n\nWhite, starring Julie Delpy, focuses on Karol, an immigrant Polish hairdresser living in Paris whose wife, Dominique, is divorcing him because he could not consummate the marriage. Nevertheless, obsessed with his beautiful ex-wife, Karol devises a plan to return to Poland, become wealthy, and reconcile with Dominique. White is the comedy of the trilogy, a brutally satiric take on equality as seen through the cold light of Polish winter.\n\nRed, starring Irene Jacob, concentrates on the meeting between Valentine, a student and part-time fashion model in Switzerland, and Joseph (Jean-Louis Trintignant), a bitter, retired judge who spends his days eavesdropping on his neighbor's phone calls, seemingly in an effort to ascertain the “truth” about the human experience. Through a simple twist of fate, they meet, and although their interaction is fraught with conflict and judgment, they eventually become friends and confidantes. The building intensity of their relationship, the ideas they discuss, and the settings they share, are all informed by a rich red color scheme, evoking love, anger, and passion. After completing the trilogy, Kieslowski observed, “I have said all I need to say on film. Red is my summation.”\n\nThe films in this trilogy are concerned with the idea of chance versus free will, as characters ask whether fortune or fate has led them to certain music, objects, and people. What appears in Red are themes that reverberate throughout the trilogy: the ceaseless pain of love; the certainty of deceit; the role of fate; the captivation of voyeurism; the conflicts between men and women; and the desire to throw everything away, including one's own identity, in an attempt to start again. Kieslowski engages with these themes in a metaphorical way, making Blue, White, and Red, much like The Double Life of Veronique, powerful works set in a mysterious, spiritual world of coincidences and parallels, in which our souls are linked to the past, present, and future.\n\nChaplin: Post Modern Times\n\nTaught by Christopher Long, M.A., Film Critic and Author\n\nBy the late 1920s, as actor, writer, director, composer, and independent producer, Charlie Chaplin exerted total control over his films but, alas, not over the cinema itself. Having once stated, \"moving pictures need sound as much as Beethoven symphonies need lyrics,\" the most famous filmmaker in the world most famously held out against the advent of sound throughout the 1930s with the silent features City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936), but the Little Tramp finally conceded in 1940 with The Great Dictator, his brilliant political satire about a man whose every nonsensical word revealed his own absurdity.\n\nWhile Chaplin's signature character did not survive the transition to sound, the director's artistic and political sensibilities did, making him virtually the only silent-film comedian to thrive in this brave, verbose new world. This course will focus on the changes sound brought to Chaplin's cinema, and the transformation of his public persona during this phase of his career. In addition to The Great Dictator, the class will shine a spotlight on films like the shocking Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight (1952), and A King in New York (1957). Chaplin talks! Join us, and have a listen.\n\nCinema of Dreams: The Films of Steven Spielberg, Pt. 1\n\nTaught by Andrew M. Karasik, Film Producer, 30th Street Entertainment\n\n\"I dream for a living.\" —Steven Spielberg\n\nBy any measure, Steven Spielberg is one of the most successful directors in the history of cinema. Few filmmakers are more widely known, or have work that is more widely recognized, and no director since Alfred Hitchcock has so consistently bridged the yawning chasm that all too often exists between commercial triumph and critical acclaim.\n\nBut to truly understand Spielberg's genius, one must appreciate his mindset as a filmmaker. When Spielberg says he 'dream[s] for a living,' it reveals a view of his role as filmmaker that is rather different than most, and his films—particularly his initial blockbusters—thoroughly reflect this alternative outlook. To experience Spielberg's early work is to step into a realm of cinematic wonderment in which imagery unfurls before us as though we have just closed our eyes and slipped into a dream. Indeed, the subject matter of these films is the very stuff that dreams 'both good and bad' are made of: a killer shark stalking a seaside town; an obsession with a close encounter; globe-spanning adventures in search of hidden treasures; and a young boy befriending an outsider and learning to cope with an imperfect world.\n\nSpielberg's voice, in his early work, in particular, stands in stark contrast to the cynicism of New Hollywood that permeated the films of Robert Altman, Mike Nichols, and Alan J. Pakula, among others. It hearkens back to a sunnier time of can-do heroes and cliffhanger serials, unwittingly offering an antidote to the venom surrounding the Vietnam War and Watergate.\n\nJoin us to examine Steven Spielberg's creation of oneiric wonderlands through a discussion of four of his greatest achievements (all of which will be shown on the big screen): Jaws (1975), Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and E.T. the Extra Terrestrial (1982). In exploring Spielberg's own personal journey and the influence of his life on his work, we will come to more fully appreciate one of the most talented auteurs in American cinema.\n\nPlease note: Due to a inclement weather, an area power outage forced the cancellation of the second session of this course and the accompanying screening of Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Both this session of the course, and the screening of the film, have been rescheduled for Wednesday, June 29.\n\nCinema of Dreams: The Films of Steven Spielberg, Pt. 2\n\nTaught by Andrew M. Karasik, Film Producer, 30th Street Entertainment\n\nWhen exploring the success of Steven Spielberg, his career can almost be separated into two disparate halves. Prior to Schindler's List (1993), Spielberg established himself as a great blockbuster king, creating indelible stories that not only broke box office records, but endure in American culture. Since then, Spielberg's vision has often turned dark, addressing some of the 20th century's most impactful events while forcing audiences to reflect on their own humanity and capacity for both good and evil.\n\nIndeed, Spielberg came to understand why his mentor, Universal Studios President Sid Sheinberg, insisted that he direct Jurassic Park before Schindler's List: because after, he would never be able to direct a summer blockbuster in the same way. But what changed for Spielberg during this production, and how did it come to alter his style so drastically?\n\nExpanding on the motifs and style of Part 1 of this course, we continue to explore the dreams and nightmares that so saturate Spielberg's works. He once theorized that movie-going at its heart is like shared dreaming; whether it is to experience the joy of heartwarming tales about aliens and adventure, or to grapple with the horrors of humanity.\n\nIn our continued exploration of his genius, we will visit four of Spielberg's most enduring works, all on the big screen—Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan (1998), A.I. Artificial Intelligence (2001), and Munich (2005)—and complete our portrait of the fractured yet glorious career of one of American cinema's greatest auteurs.\n\nCinema of Provocation: The Films of Michael Haneke\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nKnown to American audiences mainly through the successes of such films as Caché (2005) and Amour (2012), Michael Haneke's distinguished career began in the mid-1970s. Much of his early work—based on his own writing or adapted from modernist and postmodernist literature by Franz Kafka and others—centers on the historical amnesia of old Europe and its wartime past, as well as the loss of individuality. More recent films are elliptical narratives that shock viewers out of their indifference to the suffering of others, and challenge their acceptance of mediated reality.\n\nHaving worked predominantly in France since the turn of the century, Haneke reveals a cinematic style at once musical and mathematical. His films address themes of alienation and social collapse (Time of the Wolf, 2003); the exploitation and consumption of violence (Funny Games, 2007); the family as the incubator for fascistic impulse (The White Ribbon, 2009); race and issues of citizenship and migration (Code Unknown, 2000). We will watch and debate several films that also feature some of the most celebrated actors in international cinema, including Juliette Binoche, Daniel Auteuil, Isabelle Huppert, and Jean-Louis Trintignant. Join us as we explore one of contemporary cinema's most provocative and incisive filmmakers.\n\nCrossing Borders: The Cinema of Alfonso Cuarón\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nOver the last two decades, Alfonso Cuarón has produced a series of films that has not only established him as one of the principal architects of contemporary Mexican Cinema (along with Guillermo del Toro and Alejandro González Iñárritu), but also as a dynamic cinematic presence on the international stage. Cuarón transcends the barriers of language and culture by working in several countries, and he bounds across genres, as well, having tried his hand at fantasy, science fiction, teen comedy, family films, and a range of dramas. The diversity of filmmaking styles he employs and the personal and socio-political issues he addresses all reflect a sensibility that is both exuberant and evocative. Whether set in the historical past or a dystopian future, Cuarón’s films present a wide range of human experience, depicting marginalized characters, indigenous communities threatened by globalization, and individuals who seek autonomy and self-expression amidst societal constraints.\n\nA road trip and coming-of-age story, Y Tu Mamá También (2001) focuses on two restless teens during their final summer before college and their journey across the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, with a beautiful, enigmatic woman. Using poignant images and haunting events to weave the intimate stories of the trio (one rich, one poor, one foreign) into the larger cultural fabric of the country, the film offers political insight, social critique, and, ultimately, a meditation on death. Children of Men (2006) depicts a future Britain, ravaged by violent anarchy, through a desaturated palette of grays. Global sterility has left this Orwellian world bereft of any possible future, and Cuarón uses this harrowing premise to consider unsettling questions about terrorism, immigration, and the environment.\n\nGravity (2013) dramatizes one woman's expedition into the unknown, following an astronaut marooned in orbit during her first spacewalk. Cuarón uses groundbreaking advancements in lighting, camera movement, and computer-generated imagery to immerse viewers in the heroine’s tenuous, isolated, and unmoored struggle to survive. Roma (2018) takes its title from the Mexico City neighborhood where its 1970s-set story of a maid unfolds. Cuarón depicts the domestic strife, political turbulence, and personal loss that beset her in neorealist detail, drawing on his own memories to craft a tribute to the women in his life and to “the elements that forged (him).”\n\nJoin us to explore these wide-ranging films that vividly impart the versatility, innovation, and humanity of one of contemporary cinema’s most dynamic filmmakers.\n\nDark Streets, Dark Lives: The Cinema of Jean-Pierre Melville\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nInfluenced by American cinema, especially the crime dramas of the 1930s and 1940s, and utilizing the tropes associated with those films—rain-slicked streets, trench coats and fedoras, desperate men and duplicitous women, existential ennui—Jean-Pierre Melville created a unique cinematic vision that not only paid homage to that notable genre, but also reinvented it. His films reflect a tragic, minimalist, and subversive directorial voice whose eloquence would influence the French New Wave, as well as generations of international filmmakers, such as Quentin Tarantino, Luc Besson, John Woo, and Wong Kar-Wai. To celebrate the centenary of Melville's birth and his importance as a filmmaker, we will explore four of his best-known and more influential works.\n\nBob Le Flambeur (1956) is a stylish, witty film about the gamblers and criminals in the Pigalle district of Montmartre, but it is clearly infatuated with the American gangster films of Bogart, Cagney, and Raft. The narrative involves the silver-haired, trench-coated Bob, a former thief turned gambler, who, along with a team of thieves, devises a plan to steal 800 million francs from the Deauville casino. Melville turns the doom-laden fatalism of film noir into a playful, improvisational jazz riff reflected in the free-spirited, spontaneous camerawork of Henri Decaë (Jules and Jim), the Bogart-esque cool of Bob, and the insouciant eroticism of the young woman Bob protects.\n\nArmy of Shadows (1969) is considered Melville’s most personal work, informed in large measure by his involvement in the French Resistance during World War II. Fictionalized, but based on a true account of the underground movement in Nazi-occupied France, Army of Shadows follows a small band of Resistance fighters as they attempt to evade capture and torture amidst a hostile, unforgiving world filled with betrayal and death. It is a war film that resembles a crime thriller—tense, brutal, elegant—and this generic ambiguity provides insight into Melville's attitude toward crime and criminals throughout his oeuvre.\n\nLe Cercle Rouge (1970) brings together legends of the French screen Alain Delon and Yves Montand in Melville's penultimate film that is regarded as one of the crowning achievements of French noir. The half hour-long heist sequence, wordless, and excruciatingly intense, has now become legendary, culminating in an unforgettable climax that affirms the adage, “All men are criminals.” But as Melville often demonstrated in his films, the bonds of brotherhood, forged among thieves are compelling reminders of the humanity that resides within each man.\n\nMelville's final film, Un Flic (1972), is a distillation of the thematic preoccupations and techniques that have defined the director's work throughout his career. Alain Delon is a stoic cop in relentless pursuit of a suave nightclub owner and notorious thief (Richard Crenna) whom he knows all too intimately. Catherine Deneuve, in a quiet, touching performance, is the femme fatale torn between these two different men. The wordless opening robbery of a beachside, rain-swept bank is one of the director's most marvelous set pieces, establishing the grey, cold, depleted underside to Melville's more lively depictions of urban life found in other works. The filmmaker conveys the emotional, erotic, and homoerotic undercurrents among his characters through a sub-textual code of wardrobe, decor, gestures, and glances. In this regard, Un Flic becomes essential viewing for anyone interested in understanding the world of Jean-Pierre Melville.\n\nDogged Defiance: Sidney Lumet (Summer 2017)\n\nTaught by Andrew J. Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nIn a career that spanned more than fifty years, Philadelphia-born Sidney Lumet defied genre boundaries, resisted Hollywood's edict of moral simplicity, and silenced the chorus of critics that claimed his best work was behind him when he made 2007's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead. He directed it all: courtroom dramas (The Verdict); Motown musicals (The Wiz); tales of big-city corruption (Prince of the City); literary adaptations (of work by Eugene O'Neill, Anton Chekov, Agatha Christie, and others); and heist movies (Dog Day Afternoon).\n\nOver the course of these and the other forty diverse films on his résumé, Lumet worked with a variety of settings, genres, and source material. Yet, what remained decidedly constant over time was his depiction of, in the words of one film historian, \"the quintessential hero acting in defiance of peer group authority and asserting his own code of moral values.\"\n\nJoin us to explore a small but potent sampling of Lumet's work, including his debut film, 12 Angry Men (1957), as well as Dog Day Afternoon (1975) and Network (1976), and learn why he has been called \"a master of the morally complex American drama.\"\n\nDogged Defiance: Sidney Lumet (Winter 2011)\n\nTaught by Andrew J. Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nIn a career that has spanned more than fifty years, Philadelphia-born Sidney Lumet has defied genre boundaries, resisted Hollywood’s edict of moral simplicity, and silenced the chorus of critics that claimed his best work was behind him by making 2007’s Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead. He has directed it all: courtroom dramas (The Verdict); Motown musicals (The Wiz); tales of big-city corruption (Prince of the City); literary adaptations (of work by Eugene O’Neill, Anton Chekov, Agatha Christie, and others); and heist movies (Dog Day Afternoon).\n\nOver the course of these and the other forty diverse films on his résumé, Lumet has worked with a variety of settings, genres, and source material, but what remains decidedly constant over time is his depiction of, in the words of one film historian, “the quintessential hero acting in defiance of peer group authority and asserting his own code of moral values.”\n\nJoin us to explore a small sampling of Lumet’s work, including his debut film, 12 Angry Men (1957), as well as The Pawnbroker (1964) and Network (1976), and learn why he has been called “a master of the morally complex American drama.”\n\nEarly Kubrick\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\n'If it can be written, or thought, it can be filmed,' Stanley Kubrick said famously. As one of the most universally acclaimed and influential directors of the postwar era, Kubrick enjoyed a reputation unique among the filmmakers of his day. A perennial outsider, he worked far beyond the confines of Hollywood, maintaining complete artistic control and making films according to the concerns and time constraints of no one but himself, but with the rare advantage of studio financial support for much of his career. Kubrick utilized a vast range of styles and genres spanning from black comedy to crime drama to horror. This class will explore his early films, which began to establish the director as an important cinematic presence.\n\nKiller's Kiss (1955), made in the finest film noir style and set in New York City, is about an over-the-hill boxer who falls in love with a dance club hostess, evoking the violent, jealous wrath of the young woman's employer. The polish in Killer's Kiss is countered by a measure of spontaneity, a trait that Kubrick would abandon entirely in later works. His on-location depiction of New York stands as the most potent example of this dynamic—he makes effective use of the dramatic skyline and looming architecture to add drama and grit, in the process capturing an authentic, lived-in cityscape. In 1956, Kubrick directed his first studio picture, The Killing, the tale of a bold racetrack robbery told via an ambitious overlapping time structure (which has influenced many subsequent heist films), with dialogue from legendary hardboiled crime novelist Jim Thompson, and a wonderful cast of character actors, including Sterling Hayden, Coleen Gray, and Elisha Cook, Jr.\n\nIn 1957, Kubrick, along with Thompson and novelist Calder Willingham, adapted the Humphrey Cobb war novel Paths of Glory. Filmed in Germany, this haunting, exquisitely photographed dissection of the military machine in all its absurdity and capacity for dehumanization—a theme Kubrick would continue to explore throughout his career—is assembled with the exactitude for which the director would become known, from its tense trench warfare sequences, to its gripping courtroom climax, to its ravaging final scene. In 1962, Kubrick brought Nabokov's controversial novel, Lolita, to the screen. Due to a number of financial and legal difficulties, the film was shot in England, where Kubrick would continue to live and work for the remainder of his career. Upon its release, the film was at once deemed too provocative and dismissed for not remaining faithful to its source, though, over the years, Lolita's reputation has undergone reassessment, particularly in light of Kubrick's later work.\n\nAcross these films, one can see the burgeoning skills and amplifying voice of a director often lauded for his exacting precision, and consistently engaged with issues surrounding morality, discipline, power, and ambition. Join us as we discuss some of the first cinematic works of Stanley Kubrick, who, according to Martin Scorsese, 'expanded our idea of what is possible in movies.'\n\nPlease note: Class screenings will take place in the theater whenever possible.\n\nEcstatic Truth: The Films of Werner Herzog (Spring 2016)\n\nTaught by Christopher Long, M.A., Film Critic and Author\n\nPoet. Visionary. Daredevil. Madman. These are a few of the (kinder) words that have been used to describe Werner Herzog, along with another: unique. Herzog has invented and re-invented himself many times, emerging first as a leader of the New German Cinema of the 1970s, then as a controversial documentary guru, and even transforming into an American pop-culture figure who has logged guest appearances on The Simpsons and Parks and Recreation, and even played the villain in a Tom Cruise movie (Jack Reacher).\n\nHerzog has devoted his career to the pursuit and creation of the 'new images' we desperately need to survive as a culture, and he has journeyed to all ends of the earth (South America, Africa, Antarctica) to find them. Along the way, his films have blurred the distinction between fiction and non-fiction in perplexing and fascinating ways. This course will cover both his feature and documentary work, including Aguirre: The Wrath of God (1972), The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (1974), The Great Ecstasy of the Woodcarver Steiner (1974), and Lessons of Darkness (1992), among others.\n\nEcstatic Truth: The Films of Werner Herzog (Winter 2010)\n\nTaught by Christopher Long, M.A., Author and Film Critic\n\nWerner Herzog has reinvented himself many times, emerging first as a leader of the New German Cinema of the 1970s, then as a controversial documentary guru, and most recently as a Hollywood action director (Rescue Dawn).\n\nHerzog has devoted his career to the pursuit of the \"new images\" we desperately need to survive as culture, and he has journeyed to all ends of the earth to find them. Along the way, his films have blurred the distinction between fiction and documentary in fascinating ways. This course will cover Herzog's work in both formats, including Aguirre: The Wrath of God and Little Dieter Needs to Fly.\n\nEric Rohmer: Tales for All Seasons\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage, Temple University\n\nIn contrast to the intensely personal tone found in the films of Francois Truffaut, or to the politically provocative works of Jean-Luc Godard, the cinema of Eric Rohmer—a founding member of the French New Wave, along with Truffaut and Godard—is informed by a rationalist sensibility similar to the principles of the 18th century thinkers whose words he often cites in his movies. At the same time, an undercurrent of romanticism, erotic yearning, and spirit of generosity pervades these films, in which he dramatizes the loneliness and vulnerability of his characters, the conflict between personal identity and sexual temptation, the scrutiny of moral issues of the everyday, and the refusal to pass judgment, or to provide neat, conclusive endings.\n\nToward this end, we will look at Rohmer's three extraordinary cycles of films—\"Six Moral Tales,\" made during the 1960s and '70s; \"Comedies and Proverbs\" in the 1980s; and \"Tales of the Four Seasons\" in the 1990s. What distinguishes all of them, apart from the engaging visual style, is the supple, ironic language that reveals characters in all their complexity and humanity and the worlds they inhabit.\n\nEric Rohmer's attention to the crises his characters often experience, the philosophical discussions they share, and the settings in which they live once prompted Francois Truffaut to remark that \"We [the members of the French New Wave] always knew he was the greatest of us all.\"\n\nExpletive Deleted: David Mamet Films (Spring 2010)\n\nTaught by Andrew J. Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nPoet. Vulgarian. Pulitzer Prize-Winner. These labels and more have been applied to playwright, screenwriter, and filmmaker David Mamet. Best known for his stage work—particularly 1984's award-winning Glengarry Glen Ross—Mamet has also brought his distinctive style to a range of screenplays, beginning with The Postman Always Rings Twice in 1981. Mamet also has penned screen versions of his stage plays, and he has written and directed several original films, starting with House of Games (1987), and including Homicide (1991) and The Spanish Prisoner (1997), among others.\n\nAll of his pictures examine issues of trust, honor, and responsibility, and contain two elements for which Mamet's films are notorious: confidence games (in one form or another) and eloquent, mannered, and cadenced dialogue. Skeptics who think these elements preclude Mamet's films from consideration as cinematic art should heed the auteur's own words: “Drama is not an attempt to depict something which is real in the external world but rather an attempt to depict something which is real in an internal world . . . It's the difference between being a painter and an illustrator.”\n\nExpletive Deleted: David Mamet Films (Spring 2018)\n\nTaught by Andrew J. Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\nPoet.

It's the difference between being a painter and an illustrator.\"\n\nFatal Vision: The Cinema of Roman Polanski, Pt. 1\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nThe life of Roman Polanski has been marked by horrific events that have shaped a powerful, unsettling cinematic world view in which this filmmaker attempts to depict the various ways in which violence erupts from human nature, and in so doing, confront the specter of evil in the world: the death of his mother in a Nazi concentration camp in 1943; the murder of his actress-wife Sharon Tate and friends by the Manson Family in 1969; and Polanski's own arrest for the rape of a thirteen-year-old girl in 1977. In a career that has taken him to France, England, Italy, and the United States in search of opportunities to write, direct, and act, Polanski has consistently focused on revealing the individual impulses, unconscious urges, and personal psychoses of humanity that inform his films.\n\nHis eclectic body of work ranges from celebrated achievements in European art cinema (Knife in the Water, Repulsion) to parodies (The Fearless Vampire Killers, Pirates); from blockbuster Hollywood thrillers (Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown) to literary period pieces (Tess, Oliver Twist); from historical prestige pictures (The Pianist, the upcoming D, based on the Dreyfus Affair) to film adaptations of plays (Carnage, Venus in Fur). Throughout his work, Polanski adopts an ironic, even absurdist attitude—in the manner of Samuel Beckett, to whom Polanski's early films have been compared—toward the ultimate, inevitable problem: an abiding violence and evil that grows even as characters individually struggle against those forces. Over the years, his films have grown richer, more complicated, and even more discomfiting in their examination of this theme, for Polanski's work can be viewed as an attempt to chart the precise relationship between the contemporary world's instability and tendency toward violence and the individual's increasing inability to overcome his isolation and to locate some realm of meaning beyond himself.\n\nFrom his own isolated perspective—that of, essentially, a man without a country—Polanski seeks to confront the problems of violence and evil through his work, and show how his characters try continually, though awkwardly, to connect with other human beings to break out of their isolation and to free themselves of their alienation. As a result, according to one critic, Polanski's films 'exhibit an originality of vision, both stylistically and thematically, whether they are dark and morbid and psychotically disposed, or merely frivolous and disposable; his films are plainly the work of a singular intelligence, a unique psychology, a rare aesthetic.'\n\nJoin us for a two-part class on the career of this brilliant, controversial director. Part one will focus on Polanski's early films made in Europe—Knife in the Water, Repulsion, Cul-de-Sac—that established him as a compelling, new auteurist voice in international cinema, and concludes with his first venture in Hollywood: his successful adaptation of Ira Levin's novel, Rosemary's Baby. Part Two, to be offered in early 2016, will trace Polanski's career from the 1970s to the present, covering such films as Chinatown, The Tenant, Tess, Bitter Moon, Death and the Maiden, Carnage, and Venus in Fur.\n\nFatal Vision: The Cinema of Roman Polanski, Pt. 2\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program,Temple University\n\nThe life of Roman Polanski has been marked by horrific events that have shaped a powerful, unsettling cinematic world view in which this filmmaker attempts to depict the various ways in which violence erupts from human nature, and in so doing, confront the specter of evil in the world: the death of his mother in a Nazi concentration camp in 1943; the murder of his actress-wife Sharon Tate and friends by the Manson Family in 1969; and Polanski's own arrest for the rape of a thirteen-year-old girl in 1977. In a career that has taken him to France, England, Italy, and the United States in search of opportunities to write, direct, and act, Polanski has consistently focused on revealing the individual impulses, unconscious urges, and personal psychoses of humanity that inform his films.\n\nHis eclectic body of work ranges from celebrated achievements in European art cinema (Knife in the Water, Repulsion) to parodies (The Fearless Vampire Killers, Pirates); from blockbuster Hollywood thrillers (Rosemary's Baby, Chinatown) to literary period pieces (Tess, Oliver Twist); from historical prestige pictures (The Pianist, the upcoming D, based on the Dreyfus Affair) to film adaptations of plays (Carnage, Venus in Fur). Throughout his work, Polanski adopts an ironic, even absurdist attitudeâ��in the manner of Samuel Beckett, to whom Polanski's early films have been comparedâ��toward the ultimate, inevitable problem: an abiding violence and evil that grows even as characters individually struggle against those forces. Over the years, his films have grown richer, more complicated, and even more discomfiting in their examination of this theme, for Polanski's work can be viewed as an attempt to chart the precise relationship between the contemporary world's instability and tendency toward violence and the individual's increasing inability to overcome his isolation and to locate some realm of meaning beyond himself.\n\nFrom his own isolated perspectiveâ��that of, essentially, a man without a countryâ��Polanski seeks to confront the problems of violence and evil through his work, and show how his characters try continually, though awkwardly, to connect with other human beings to break out of their isolation and to free themselves of their alienation. As a result, according to one critic, Polanski's films â��exhibit an originality of vision, both stylistically and thematically, whether they are dark and morbid and psychotically disposed, or merely frivolous and disposable; his films are plainly the work of a singular intelligence, a unique psychology, a rare aesthetic.â��\n\nJoin us for the second part of our course on the work of this brilliant, controversial director. It will trace Polanski's career from the 1970s to the present, covering such films as Chinatown, The Tenant, Tess, Bitter Moon, Death and the Maiden, Carnage, and Venus in Fur.\n\nFemme Auteur: The Films of Ida Lupino\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nCalled the \"English Jean Harlow\" when she arrived in Hollywood in 1932, Ida Lupino became one of the most accomplished actresses of the 1940s and 1950s. Throughout this period, as her artistic needs began to exceed what her career in front of the camera could provide, she emerged as the first actress of the studio era to direct feature films. Despite cultural stereotypes that relegated women to the margins of cinematic practice, Lupino left Warner Bros. in 1948 to craft a series of emotionally powerful films that examined provocative issues.\n\nNot Wanted (1949) is an atmospheric film noir that addresses the then-taboo topic of out-of-wedlock pregnancy. Although Lupino is not credited with having directed the film—she took over when the original director suffered a heart attack—her first effort behind the camera reveals a compelling vision: remarkable empathy, subjective camerawork, and documentary-style location shooting. Among its notable achievements, The Bigamist (1953) is the first Hollywood film of the sound era in which a female star directed herself. This haunting noir-like drama focuses on a traveling salesman torn between his matrimonial commitments to two women.\n\nThe Hitch-Hiker (1953) is widely considered the first mainstream film noir directed by a woman. Tense, grimy, and nerve-wracking, Lupino uses two primary and contrasting settings: the claustrophobic confines of a car, and a barren desert expanse. It is a distinctly masculine film that scrutinizes the foundational traits of conventional masculinity. Hard, Fast, and Beautiful (1951), a drama about a budding tennis star torn between her mother and her fiancé, hints at the bleak cynicism beginning to appear on the screens of post-war American cinema.\n\nLupino's career behind the camera continued into the 1960s with her last theatrical film, The Trouble with Angels, and in television, where she directed episodes of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Untouchables, The Fugitive, and The Twilight Zone. Join us to explore the rich career of this celebrated director.\n\nFour Voices: Independent Women Filmmakers\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nFrom Mabel Normand, one of the first female American directors (as well as an actress, writer, and producer) who worked on Charlie Chaplin's early short films, to Kathryn Bigelow, the first woman to win an Academy Award for directing The Hurt Locker, women filmmakers have contributed a distinctive artistic voice to the development of American cinema. Yet, their accomplishments have been achieved within a Hollywood environment that has often been unfriendly to their participation and to their explorations of important and, at times, provocative subjects. But despite the obstacles they have encountered in the past—and, in certain respects, endure even now—women directors continue to work within the Hollywood system, and outside it, to create films in a wide array of genres and styles, about topics that both challenge and engage. Four such gifted directors and their films will be examined in this course: Joan Micklin Silver, Nancy Savoca, Kimberly Peirce, and Nicole Holofcener.\n\nIn Hester Street (1975), Joan Micklin Silver dramatizes the story of a Jewish couple who come to the Lower East Side of Manhattan from Europe in 1896. The film is notable for its detailed reconstruction of Jewish immigrant life in New York at the turn of the century, including a considerable amount of Yiddish dialogue. Hester Street was part of a wave of films released in the 1960s and 1970s that began to address the complexities of American Jewish identity. This film, with its anecdotes, incongruities, and mixture of comedy and pathos, follows in the tradition of such immigrant stories as Elia Kazan's America America and Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Pt. II.\n\nIn True Love (1989), Nancy Savoca examines an Italian-American couple and their respective families as they participate in all of the usual pre-wedding anxieties and party-planning that constitute such an event. While the film features all the conventions of one of the most overworked genres in movie history, the ethnic wedding comedy, Savoca avoids the clichés and sentimentalities normally found in such a film. For example, both the would-be groom and bride-to-be are by turn likable and annoying, revealing their flaws in real, human ways. True Love is never condescending, for it demonstrates genuine affection for and understanding of the characters, as well as for the specifically ethnic, neighborhood touches that are the sources of its exuberant and occasionally raucous humor.\n\nBoys Don't Cry (1999), by Kimberly Peirce, is a dramatization of the real-life story of Brandon Teena, an American trans man who attempts to find himself and love in Nebraska, but falls victim to a brutal crime perpetrated by two acquaintances. The film captures the mystique, eerie loneliness, and desolation of Midwestern America, which have the potential to propel some people to despair and violence. The film's dark, understated aesthetic complements this vision, reflecting the influence of neorealism and the films of John Cassavetes and Martin Scorsese. Boys Don't Cry explores the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, violence against LGBT people, and the intersection of social class and gender.\n\nEnough Said (2013), by Nicole Holofcener, is a romantic comedy that focuses on Eva, a masseuse and the divorced mother of a teenage girl, who begins a relationship with Albert, only to discover that he is the ex-husband of her client and friend. Referred to at times as the female Woody Allen, Holofcener writes all the films she directs, which are often partly inspired by events in her own life, do not always follow a typical plot structure, and usually deal with middle-class characters and issues. Yet, while some of Allen's films have female protagonists, Holofcener always focuses on female characters—crafted by a woman—thereby creating a rather different cinematic experience that is all too rare. Join us as we watch, discuss, and celebrate the richness and diversity of films written and directed by four highly talented women.\n\nGleanings: The Films of Agnès Varda\n\nTaught by Christopher Long, M.A., Author and Film Critic\n\nBy the early 1960s, filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and François Truffaut were showered with praise as pioneers of the French New Wave. But before them all came Agnès Varda, the visionary who seemed to materialize out of nowhere with her groundbreaking 1954 debut, La Pointe Courte, a stylistically audacious film that bears a striking resemblance to the New Wave films it predates by several years.\n\nVarda is best understood as a unique voice who resists easy categorization. She brings the careful eye of a trained photographer and an ethnographic sensibility to films that often straddle the border between documentary and fiction, weds a vivid sense of place to a gift for creating vibrant characters, and possesses a formal boldness and distinctive sense of humor that ranges from playful to lacerating (often within the same film).\n\nJoin us for a tour through the work of one of the true titans of cinema with screenings and discussions of films such as La Pointe Courte, Cléo from 5 to 7 (1962), Vagabond (1985), and The Gleaners and I (2000). Sixty years after her debut, Agnès Varda remains one of the greatest filmmakers in the world: exuberant, eloquent, and eminently enjoyable. Come find out why.\n\nGuts, Girls, and Glasses: The Daredevil Genius of Harold Lloyd\n\nTaught by Christopher Long, M.A., Film Critic and Author\n\nCharlie Chaplin's Little Tramp may be the best-remembered character of American silent cinema, but Harold Lloyd's indomitable 'Glasses' character was a worthy rival. Where the Tramp was the ultimate tragicomic outsider, too strange and singular ever to assimilate, Lloyd's 'Glasses' character was the ultimate embodiment of the middle-class American striving to climb the social ladder. He gave cinematic life to this notion by scaling—and dangling from—a high-rise building in his 1923 masterpiece, Safety Last!, terrifying and delighting audiences in one of the most nerve-wracking action sequences ever put on film.\n\nPerhaps Lloyd's focus on kinetic 'thrill sequences' and the relentless optimism of his signature character explain why he wasn't always fully embraced by intellectuals more receptive to the darker shadings of Chaplin or the deadpan stoicism of Buster Keaton. Regardless, Lloyd was one of the great box-office draws and great film artists of his day, not to mention one of the great athletes; he didn't let a little thing like blowing off his thumb in a promotional shoot keep him from performing most of his own stunts!\n\nThis course will trace Lloyd's indelible career from his early days making short films as the Tramp-like Lonesome Luke, to the development of his defining 'Glasses'character in features such as Safety Last!, the blockbuster smash The Freshman (1925), and Speedy (1928, featuring a cameo by Babe Ruth), through his challenging transition to the sound era. Join us to hear the colorful tale of a true American original who never stopped moving and never stopped looking up.\n\nHitchcock at the Height (Summer 2013)\n\nTaught by Andrew J. Douglas, Ph.D., Director of Education, BMFI\n\n\"At the height of what?\" you may ask, and the answer is: \"Everything.\" By the mid-1950s, Alfred Hitchcock had been in Hollywood for fifteen years, had long since moved beyond the rockiness of his early American productions, and was about to embark on the portion of his career that would see him soar like The Birds to new, Vertigo-inducing heights of filmmaking prowess, popular appeal, and critical acclaim.\n\nIn fact, by the time the ride ended a decade later, the director had long since lost sight of his peers out the Rear Window, and audiences and critics alike were going Psycho to find out what the Master of Suspense would take a stab at next.\n\nThese films for which Hitch is best known contain his most notable cinematic trademarks: blonde women in trouble, danger in everyday places, Machiavellian matrons, and, of course, his iconic cameos. Join us to learn why these pictures left an indelible mark on film history, and what role they played in cementing the legacy of one of cinema’s true auteurs. Oh, and did we mention these classics will all be screened in the theater in high-definition digital transfers?\n\nIcon in the Director’s Chair: Clint Eastwood\n\nTaught by Paul Wright, Ph.D., Department of English, Cabrini College\n\nAs an acting icon whose work redefined both the western and action genres, Clint Eastwood has nonetheless always thought of himself as a director-in-training, even from his earliest days in television. He learned from all the filmmakers with whom he worked, but none more than Sergio Leone (A Fistful of Dollars, 1964; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, 1966) and Don Siegel (The Beguiled, 1971; Dirty Harry, 1971), to whom he dedicated Unforgiven (1992).\n\nWith a filmmaking career that spans over thirty films and more than four decades, some of his work has been overlooked for its modest scope and ambition. In recent years, the breadth and diversity of his films have allowed Eastwood to take his place among the great directors of Hollywood cinema. He has been called 'the modern inheritor of traditional Hollywood directorial values,' and a creator whose true talent is to 'draw upon Hollywood's genre traditions and make of them unique and perceptive studies of human beings under stress.'\n\nThis course explores Eastwood as a director through an overview of his impressive accomplishments, including a closer look at his films High Plains Drifter (1973), Unforgiven, and Mystic River (2003).\n\nIda Lupino: Femme Fatale, Femme Auteur\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nCalled the 'English Jean Harlow' when she arrived in Hollywood in 1932—though she was part of a distinguished British theatrical dynasty—Ida Lupino became one of the most accomplished actresses, and femmes fatales, of the 1940s and 1950s through her performances in such films as They Drive by Night, High Sierra, Ladies in Retirement, and The Big Knife.\n\nThroughout this period, as her artistic needs began to exceed what her career in front of the camera could provide, Lupino emerged as the first actress of the studio era to direct in Hollywood. Despite industry conventions and cultural stereotypes that relegated women to the margins of cinematic practice, she became an important auteur, crafting a series of emotionally powerful films that examined such issues as rape (Outrage), social climbing (Hard, Fast and Beautiful), bigamy (The Bigamist), the ravages of polio (Never Fear), and the mechanics of male violence (The Hitch-Hiker). Lupino's career behind the camera continued to flourish into the 1960s with films like The Trouble with Angels, and in television, where she directed many episodes of the era's most popular programs, including Alfred Hitchcock Presents, The Untouchables, The Fugitive, and Bewitched. Join us as we explore the rich, prolific career of this celebrated actress and director.\n\nKieslowski’s Dekalog\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nA filmmaker preoccupied with similarities and paradoxes, Krzysztof Kieslowski's own career evolved over the years from one centered on political realities to one of metaphysical contemplation. Upon closer examination, however, both ends of his cinematic journey share a focus on individuals struggling to reconcile daily life with its cultural myths—be they communist propaganda, Biblical proverbs, or slogans of the French Revolution. A powerful storyteller, Kieslowski undermines the ordered world of his documentary-like descriptions with the complex, often disillusioning lives of his central protagonists—portraits that alternate between pessimistic deconstruction and an affection for human resilience.\n\nToward this end, the transitional work between these two portraits is his Dekalog, an experimental work originally designed for Polish television, which offers an imaginative consideration of the Ten Commandments presented through a series of ten one-hour films. It is a remarkable achievement. The entire series takes place in one Polish housing complex, and, as a result, various characters from certain episodes make brief appearances in others. There is even one nameless man who has a cameo in nearly every segment.\n\nThe ten films are not philosophical abstractions, nor are they simple demonstrations of black-and-white morality, but instead are compelling personal stories that engage the viewer immediately, for Kieslowski is dealing with those aspects of life that are universal. Kieslowski himself has pointed out: 'The relationship between the film and the individual Commandment [is] a tentative one. The films should be influenced by the individual Commandments to the same degree that the Commandments influence our daily lives.'With this in mind, many of the segments deal only peripherally with their associated Commandment, while others dramatize more than one. Ultimately, Kieslowski wants to focus on what occurs with 'people who come home, lock the door on the inside, and remain alone with themselves.'\n\nHe does this over the series by examining the dilemmas presented by the fundamental sins in the lives of ordinary Warsaw citizens. In Dekalog I, a scientist puts his faith in science and logic to govern daily life. In Dekalog II, a violinist, unable to decide between her husband and her lover, leaves the impossible decision to her husband's attending physician. In Dekalog III, a lonely woman imposes on an ex-lover on Christmas Eve to search for her missing lover. In Dekalog IV, an acting student discovers an ominous letter from her father. In Dekalog V, a cruel young man wanders through the streets in search of a random victim. In Dekalog VI, a young postal clerk falls in love with a neighboring artist whom he admires from a distance. In Dekalog VII, a struggling student kidnaps her biological daughter. In Dekalog VIII, an ethics professor is confronted with the culpability of her actions when asked to harbor a Jewish girl during World War II. In Dekalog IX, a married couple learns to deal with the husband's impotence. In Dekalog X, two brothers inherit their father's priceless stamp collection.\n\nTaken as a whole, Dekalog is a profound observation on the trials and travails of everyday life, reflected in complex ways, but all fundamentally, and unfailingly, human. Join us as we experience one of the great achievements in modern cinema.\n\nLater Kubrick\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\n'If it can be written, or thought, it can be filmed,' Stanley Kubrick said famously. As one of the most universally acclaimed and influential directors of the postwar era, Kubrick enjoyed a reputation unique among his peers. A perennial outsider, he worked far beyond the confines of Hollywood, maintaining complete artistic control and making films according to the concerns and time constraints of no one but himself, but with the rare advantage of studio financial support for much of his career.\n\nThis class will explore the films of Kubrick's middle and late periods, which only solidified the director as an important cinematic presence. It begins with A Clockwork Orange (1971), a consideration of teenage violence and experimental rehabilitation by law enforcement authorities based around the character of Alex (Malcolm McDowell). Kubrick's take on the Anthony Burgess novel was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s, and was part of an ongoing debate about violence and its glorification in cinema.\n\nBarry Lyndon (1975) is an adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's The Luck of Barry Lyndon, a picaresque novel about the adventures of an 18th-century Irish rogue and social climber. Often considered to be Kubrick's most authentic-looking film, the cinematography and lighting techniques that the director and cinematographer John Alcott used were truly innovative. Though unsuccessful at the time of its release—despite being nominated for seven Academy Awards and winning four—the film's reputation has grown over the years and it is now considered to be one of the director's best, particularly among filmmakers and critics. Roger Ebert described Barry Lyndon as 'one of the most beautiful films ever made. [It is] certainly in every frame a Kubrick film: technically awesome, emotionally distant, and remorseless in its doubt of human goodness.'\n\nFull Metal Jacket (1987) is an adaptation of Gustav Hasford's Vietnam War novel The Short-Timers, which Kubrick found 'brutally honest.' Though much of the film is set in Vietnam, Kubrick never left his adopted homeland, England, during production, using a derelict gasworks in Beckton, in the London Docklands, as the ruined city of Hue. This choice makes the film visually different from others about that conflict, as does its incorporation of many of Kubrick's trademark characteristics, such as his selection of ironic music, depictions of men being dehumanized, and attention to extreme detail, which all combine to achieve a rare realism.\n\nEyes Wide Shut (1999), Kubrick's final film, stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey. The story is based on Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 Freudian novella, Traumnovelle (Dream Story), which Kubrick relocated from turn-of-the-century Vienna to New York City in the 1990s. Kubrick said of the novel: 'It explores the sexual ambivalence of a happy marriage and tries to equate the importance of sexual dreams and might-have-beens with reality.' Given the provocative nature of the subject matter, and Kubrick's treatment of it, Eyes Wide Shut, like Lolita and A Clockwork Orange before it, faced censorship prior to release. Although Kubrick never saw the final version released to the public—having died suddenly on March 7, 1999, a few days after he finished editing—he attended a screening of his cut with Warner Bros. executives, Cruise, and Kidman, and reportedly exclaimed that it was 'my best film ever.'\n\nAcross these works, one can see the extraordinary skills and amplifying voice of a director often lauded for his exacting precision, while consistently engaging his audiences with issues surrounding morality, discipline, power, and ambition. Join us as we discuss these films, and, in so doing, are reminded of what Martin Scorsese once noted: '[Kubrick] expanded our idea of what is possible in movies.'\n\nLust for Life: The Cinema of Vincente Minnelli\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program,\n\nTemple University\n\nOne of MGM's premier filmmakers during Hollywood's classical period (having worked at the studio for 26 years), Vincente Minnelli brought an eye for elaborate mise-en-scene and an intensity of feeling to some of the most spectacular films ever produced in Hollywood. Trained as a window dresser at Marshall Field's and as a costume and set designer in hometown Chicago before advancing to stage directing in New York in the 1930s, Minnelli was a masterful, wide-ranging helmer of musicals (An American in Paris), melodramas (Some Came Running), and comedies (Designing Woman).\n\nHis musicals (Meet Me in St. Louis, The Band Wagon) are unprecedented in their fluidly expressive integration of story, music, and decor, the most important of which, Gigi, won Minnelli the 1958 Oscar for Best Direction. At the same time, he displayed a gift for agonized psychological melodramas (Lust for Life, Tea and Sympathy), centered on individuals in conflict with society, and for comedies (Father of the Bride, The Long, Long Trailer) built upon domestic situations thrown into states of chaos, all of which has further enhanced his reputation.\n\nFew filmmakers were able to harness the explosive visual and emotional capacities of the widescreen, Technicolor frame as Minnelli, and over the course of his career his ability to direct actors led to seven different actors in Oscar-nominated performances, among them Spencer Tracy, Gloria Grahame, Kirk Douglas, Shirley Maclaine, and Anthony Quinn (both Grahame and Quinn won). Filmmakers as diverse as Alain Resnais, Spike Lee, Terence Davies, Martin Scorsese, and Quentin Tarantino have expressed admiration for his work. Join us as we experience the classic musicals that earned Vincente Minnelli his reputation, as well as the subversive, deeply personal melodramas that reveal the sensitive soul of one of cinema's greatest artists.\n\nMaster Humanist: The Cinematic World of Satyajit Ray\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program, Temple University\n\nOver the course of his distinguished career, Satyajit Ray came to be regarded as one of the great humanist filmmakers, along with Yasujiro Ozu, Jean Renoir, and Vittorio De Sica. Ray's films reveal the complexities of life in post-colonial India, a country bound by traditions yet striving to become modern. Although social context is always evident in his films, the struggles of the individual depicted in them carry even greater emotional power.\n\nThis sensibility is immediately apparent in Ray's debut film, Pather Panchali (1955), part of his Apu trilogy, which we will see in its entirety. Adapted from the first part of a long, popular novel by Bibhutibhushan Bandyopadhyay, Pather Panchali established a new artistic cinema for India through its story of a poor Bengali scholar, his wife, and his two children, one of whom is named Apu. The film makes wonderful use of exteriors and of professional and amateur actors to take viewers deep into the family—especially the world of the children, who venture out to discover the wonders and difficulties of life, the pettiness of humanity, and the violence of nature. Aparajito (1956), the second film in the trilogy, follows Apu to the city, where his father finds him a job to support his family. In this feature, Ray explores the impact of death as well as the clash between spiritual duty and secular enticement as he examines the experience of ordinary people struggling to survive. In Apur Sansar (1959), Apu has weathered the deaths of his closest family members as he journeys to Calcutta in search of a new life of independence. He finds work as a writer and enjoys a pseudo-bohemian existence until he is called upon by a friend to fill in at an arranged marriage. Apu is confronted by the joys of love and the hardship of loss; the result is a film imbued with keen observations that serve as a fitting conclusion to this remarkable trilogy. Ray's style in these films was neorealist in its simplicity and directness, and he made brilliant use of classical Indian music with a soundtrack composed and performed by Ravi Shankar (though Ray composed his own scores thereafter).\n\nThe course will end with Devi (1960), a carefully nuanced study in religious obsession, as it focuses on Biswas, a man convinced that his young daughter-in-law Tagore is in fact the goddess Kali reincarnated. Baroque and melodramatic, the film mounts a lucid and moving argument against the destructive nature of fanaticism and superstition, as Tagore gradually loses all sense of her own individuality.\n\nWhile the neorealist, rural-set Apu trilogy launched Ray's career, the director was equally at home in a wide variety of genres and settings: period tales of urban elites, chamber pieces filled with music and song, documentaries on poets and artists, and even children's fables and detective stories. When Satyajit Ray died in 1992, he left behind a legacy of thirty-six films, as well as countless short stories, sketches, illustrations, and musical compositions. Please join us for what is sure to be an illuminating cinematic journey, for as another great director, Akira Kurosawa, once said of this filmmaker: 'Not to have seen the cinema of Ray means existing in a world without seeing the sun or the moon.'\n\nMel Brooks: Talk about Bad Taste!\n\nTaught by Ian Abrams, College of Media Arts & Design, Drexel University\n\nMel Brooks has been a fixture in American comedy for more than half a century. He began as a writer on Sid Caesar’s Your Show of Shows (1950-54), the innovative variety program from the early days of television, and a crucible that shaped the talent who would dominate television comedy well into the 1960s. Brooks would go on to try his hand at film, and start by winning the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for his big-screen debut, The Producers (1968). He would then write, direct, produce, and/or act in a string of hits before triumphing on Broadway with the musical version of The Producers. In the world of entertainment, Mel Brooks has come, seen, and conquered all.\n\nIn this class, we will view and discuss clips of Brooks’ early TV work and four of his films: The Producers; Blazing Saddles (1974); History of the World: Part 1 (1981); and the lesser-known The Twelve Chairs (1970). In addition, we will listen to excerpts from his legendary “2000 Year Old Man” routine, and analyze Brooks’ evolution from someone who mocks bad taste to one of the cinema’s most gleeful champions of outrageous vulgarity. Brooks’ films display a nine-year-old’s delight in profanity and jokes about bodily functions—but this comes from a man who can also toss off a casual reference to Dostoyevsky’s Prince Myshkin. How do these two seemingly incongruous sides reflect a single comic genius?\n\nMichelangelo Antonioni: Landscapes of the Soul\n\nTaught by Maurizio Giammarco, Ph.D., Intellectual Heritage Program,\n\nTemple University\n\nMore than any other Italian director, Michelangelo Antonioni consciously aimed to produce a modernist cinema that abandoned traditional plotting in favor of narratives in which seemingly random events depicted characters estranged from their environments in order to reveal their tragic inability to communicate with others and with themselves. In doing so, Antonioni sought to create a cinema that, in his words, would be tied “to the truth rather than to logic” and that responded to the rhythm of life in its daily routine, “not so much concerned with externals as it is with those forces that move us to act in a certain way and not in another.”\n\nHe realized this poetic vision of modern isolation and the difficulties of communication through a stunning use of composition, camerawork, color, and naturalistic sound—what one film historian termed “objective correlatives, visual embodiments of pervasive mood and specific psychological states.” The result was an original approach to cinematic expression that profoundly influenced the development of European cinema.\n\nAntonioni's technique, from the early works to the later masterpieces, would become increasingly abstract, cerebral, and provocative, embodying many of the philosophical concerns associated with European Existentialism, including the struggles between freedom and anguish, meaning and absurdity, genuineness and inauthenticity, and atheism and religion, as well issues of social criticism, the importance of personal relations, and the right to individual choice.\n\nJoin us as we explore the powerful early films Cronaca di un Amore and Il Grido, examine the celebrated trilogy L'Avventura, La Notte, and L'Eclisse, and experience the brilliant "
