        "meta_description": "A list of 629 films compiled on Letterboxd, including The Big Lebowski (1998), Hot Fuzz (2007), Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) and Shaun of the Dead (2004). About this list: Made this list for my friend Alex. Since comedy is his favourite genre, I thought it'd be fun to find the Letterboxd community's most loved comedy films. In the comments below, vote for up to 10 comedy films. 1 point goes to each film you pick, and you don't have to rank your selections. What counts as a comedy film is up to you, and I'll only question particularly unusual picks. Films don't have to already be on the list, you're welcome to induct new entries. You can change your votes at a later time if you want. The list is sorted by points, then alphabetically by film name. Other votes I run: Directors | Sci-Fi Films | Romance Films | Animated Films | LGBTQ+ Films | Horror Films | 2000s Films | 1990s Films | 1980s Films | 1970s Films | 1960s Films | 1950s Films | 1940s Films | 2018 Films VOTING IS NOW CLOSED",
