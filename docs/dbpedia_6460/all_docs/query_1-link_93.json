        "text": "Creative students at the University of Northampton were given a sneak peek into the glitz and glamour of the professional hair, make-up and prosthetics industry with an exclusive visit from multi-award-winning artist, Ve Neill.\n\nWith a trophy cabinet which boasts three Academy Awards, two Emmy Awards and one BAFTA, Ve Neill has established herself as one of the highest awarded and well-respected artists in the industry, working in leading makeup and prosthetic design roles on blockbuster movies Mrs Doubtfire, The Grinch, Beetlejuice, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Hunger Games, Edward Scissorhands, The Amazing Spiderman and Batman – to name only a few.\n\nVe Neill’s talk with students formed part of the University of Northampton’s Changing Futures Week, which showcases industry careers and opportunities available to students through a packed agenda of masterclasses, keynote speakers, demonstrations and workshops with leading industry speakers.\n\nInspiring industry insiders took time out of their busy schedules to pass on their knowledge to creative students across courses including Journalism, Photography, Fashion, Acting, Fine Art, Creative Film, Television and Digital Media Production, Graphic Communication, Popular Music, Illustration, Environmental Science, English & Creative Writing, Geography and History.\n\nThe event held last week (23 February) was a valuable opportunity for Ve Neill to share her knowledge and expertise with the next generation of professionals within Hair, Make-Up and Prosthetics for Stage and Screen and Creative Film, Television and Digital Media Production.\n\nReflecting on her career, Ve said: “As a Make-Up Designer, it’s our job to create the crowning touch of a look which brings the film Director’s creative vision to life.\n\n“As artists, we cannot work independently – we are working as part of a highly professional team which is brining a character to life within a universe which the director is creating.”\n\nVe shared her top-tips with students on working professionally within a vastly changing industry, as well as sharing her insightful perspective on the growing presence of women within a previously male-centric industry.\n\nSenior Lecturer in Media & Cultural Theory Anthony Stepniak said: “We were honoured to welcome multi-award-winning Ve Neill, who spoke virtually with our students from Los Angeles.\n\n“Our industry is incredibly reliant on people of Ve’s calibre and expertise taking the time to speak with students who are taking the first steps in becoming artistic professionals, to learn from her career which has spanned more than four decades.\n\n“The Hair, Make-Up and Prosthetics for Stage and Screen course here at the University of Northampton combines traditional methods of sculpting and moulding alongside investment into state-of-the-art three-dimensional printing and scanning technologies in order to futureproof the course.\n\n“It was hugely fascinating and insightful to speak with Ve and lean on her vast expertise within the field to reflect on the progression of the industry, and to reflect on the value and placement of our University course within the field.”\n\nFind out more about studying Hair, Make-Up and Prosthetics for Stage and Screen at the University of Northampton."
