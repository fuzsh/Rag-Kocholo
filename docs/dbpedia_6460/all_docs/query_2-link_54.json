        "text": "Censorship still existed, the red scare and the witch hunt were nearing hysteria. In this context the 1950s cinema was developed. In this decade, homosexuals were often portrayed as villains or at least disturbed characters. Any deviation from the behavior considered adequate was a sign that there was something very wrong with that person.\n\nLet’s remember the great villain from my favorite Hitchcock film, “Strangers on a Train” (1951): Bruno Antony (Robert Walker) is the one who proposes an “exchange of murders” to Guy Haines (Farley Granger).\n\n“Strangers on a Train” was based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith, also the author of “The Price of Salt”, the book that was the origin of “Carol” (2005). Raymond Chandler was one of the credited screenwriters who worked on adapting the story to the screen.\n\nAlfred Hitchcock had already hinted at a homosexual villain in “Rebecca”, made more than a decade earlier, and it’s not difficult to find other examples of sexuality and evil connected in his body of work. In “Strangers on a Train”, Bruno has a strange and deadly fixation on Guy.\n\nIn 1954, the peculiar western “Johnny Guitar”, made by poverty row studio Republic, had Mercedes McCambridge, wearing dark male-like clothes, against Joan Crawford. Mercedes plays Emma, a woman who is bitter because of her unresolved feelings towards Vienna, Joan’s character. I don’t even have to say that Emma is the villain in the movie, right? Another example of macho woman in a western in Calamity Jane, played by Doris Day in the homonymous western from 1953.\n\nEven if all eyes are attracted to James Dean in a screening of “Rebel without a Cause” (1955), we have to agree that Plato (Sal Mineo) is the most interesting character. He has no friends and sees in Dean’s character a figure that is the same time fatherly and heroic — it’s clear that he is a homosexual.\n\nMy biggest trouble with Plato is that he has no family, unlike Dean’s and Natalie Wood’s character, and this can be interpreted as if homosexuality was caused by the lack of a nuclear, traditional family. Like most characters with “a condemnable behavior”, Plato becomes a tragic scapegoat. Another demonstration of how a person can be considered unfit to live in society because of his sexual orientation can be seen in “Tea and Sympathy” (1956).\n\nAnother film with a gay subtext is “Cat in a hot tin roof” (1957). We see Brick’s (Paul Newman) sadness and desperation — almost a widow’s grieving — when his friend dies. This tragedy makes Brick start drinking again and he looks for pleasures of the past, like jumping obstacles — the result is a broken leg in the movie’s very first scene. Brick also doesn’t pay attention to his hot wife Maggie (Elizabeth Taylor) and the fact that he has no kids yet bothers his father (Burl Ives).\n\nThe year of 1959 brought two odd examples of intolerance. In “Suddenly, Last Summer”, the character Sebastian, whose face is never seen, has a weird relationship with his domineering mother, Violet (Katharine Hepburn), and has a tragic ending when he exposes his sexy cousin Catherine (Elizabeth Taylor) on a beach.\n\nIn “Ben-Hur” there is a very subtle love story between villain Messala (Stephen Boyd) and Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston). Only Boyd knew about this gay subtext, and based his performance in this little secret. By the way, it was because of this gay subtext that Rock Hudson refused the role of Ben-Hur, following his agent’s advice.\n\nThe 1950s didn’t have only dramas: there were also several musicals and comedies. Once again some secondary characters followed the “sissy” stereotype, one made popular and played well by Edward Everett Horton in the 1930s. The “sissies” were funny bachelors who were friends with the lead, like Jack Buchanan’s character in “The Band Wagon” (1953).\n\nWhen we get to 1960, we still find some subtle way to deal with homosexuality. It can be seen in one of the most discusses scenes of all time: in “Spartacus”, when Crassus (Laurence Olivier) is given a bath by Antoninus (Tony Curtis) and starts a speech about “liking to eat both oysters and snails”. Only this brief scene showed us that the theme was going to be explored deeper in the decades to come…"
