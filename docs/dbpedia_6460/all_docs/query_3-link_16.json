        "text": "Hi I’m Retro Dee and Welcome to a segment that I like to call “Life in the 50’s”!\n\nIn this post, we will be talking about movies! Like any era, movies were an important part of the 1950’s. Movies in the 50’s were filled with glamour and excitement, iconic stars, great music, wild westerns and creepy monsters. They inspired new trends, brought high school sweethearts closer and went down in History as Hollywood’s Golden Age. Yes, movies in the 50’s were a special time for cinematography and the world at large.\n\nIt would be impossible to cover all the great films that came out in the 1950’s in one single blog entry. So I will only highlight some, along with some of the unique aspects of movie-going in that era.\n\nDrive-In Theaters\n\nWhen people think of the 1950’s, one iconic image that comes to mind is the Drive-In Theater. Although they came to be in the 1940’s, and still exist today, the 1950’s decade was the hey-day for the Drive-In Movie. Folks would park their huge cars in a parking lot in front of a giant, outdoor screen. Stationary speakers at each parking space is how the audio of the movie was heard. At intermission, there would be a cartoon featuring dancing snacks encouraging folks to go up to the concession stand. The concession stands sold hot dogs, candy, popcorn and sodas which folks would bring back to their cars.\n\nFor dating teens, the Drive-In theater was an ideal place to “neck” and spend a romantic evening with your spouse-to-be. Many teens didn’t even watch the movie!\n\nDrive-In Movies have become an iconic part of American Culture and a sentimental symbol of times gone by. However, Drive-In theaters were active way beyond the 50’s. Some remain open today, but are not nearly as popular as they were in years past.\n\nIf folks in the 50’s didn’t choose to go to a Drive-In (which was more popular with the teenie boppers) they could see the newest picture at a regular movie theater. Most every town with a somewhat ample population had a theater. The difference from today’s theaters is that back then they were cleaner, you could smoke, and gals would come around with popcorn and candy so you didn’t have to get up to get it yourself.\n\nMovies and Stars\n\nNothing was more glamorous than Hollywood in the 1950’s! Some of the most beautiful women and the most handsome men to ever live graced the silver screen in the 1950’s era. Some classic 1950’s films were:\n\nJames Dean and Natalie Wood in Rebel Without A Cause (1955), Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront (1954), Sophia Loren and Cary Grant in The Pride and The Passion (1957), Tab Hunter in Damn Yankees (1958) , and Pat Boone and Shirley Jones in April Love (1957)\n\nAlso during the 50’s, Italian beauty Gina Lollobrigida starred in a total of 22 films including: She Couldn’t Say No (1955), Trapeze (with Burt Lancaster, 1956) and Anna of Brooklyn (1958)\n\nElizabeth Taylor graced the screen in A Place in the Sun (1951), Father’s Little Dividend (1951), The Last Time I Saw Paris (1954), Elephant Walk (1954), Giant (with Rock Hudson and James Dean, 1956), and, of course, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958)\n\nThe 1950’s were a big decade for Silver Screen sweetheart Audrey Hepburn who starred in One Wild Oat (1951), Laughter in Paradise (1951), Monte Carlo Baby (1951), Lavender Hill Mob (1951), The Young Wives’ Tale (1951), Roman Holiday (1953), Sabrina (1954), War And Peace (1956), Funny Face (1957), Love in the Afternoon (1957), and Green Mansions (1959)\n\nBut the undisputed icon who ruled the Silver Screen in the 50’s, was undoubtedly Marilyn Monroe.\n\nMarilyn, Marilyn and MORE Marilyn…\n\nOften imitated and never, ever duplicated, Miss Monroe starred in a whopping 23 movies in the 1950’s and she was sexy and gorgeous in all of them. Marilyn Monroe was actually a curvaceous size 10 and in the 50’s, curves were considered very sexy.\n\nThe vast majority of Marilyn’s films were released in the 50’s, since she wasn’t well-known yet in the 40’s and she died in 1962.\n\nHer 1950’s films were as followed:\n\nA Ticket to Tomahawk (1950)\n\nThe Asphalt Jungle (1950)\n\nAll About Eve (1950)\n\nThe Fireball (1950)\n\nRight Cross (1951)\n\nHome Town Story (1951)\n\nAs Young as You Feel (1951)\n\nLove Nest (1951)\n\nLet’s Make It Legal (1951)\n\nClash by Night (1952)\n\nWe’re Not Married! (1952)\n\nDon’t Bother to Knock (1952)\n\nMonkey Business (1952)\n\nO. Henry’s Full House (1952)\n\nNiagara (1953)\n\nGentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953)\n\nHow to Marry a Millionaire (1953)\n\nRiver of No Return (1954)\n\nThere’s No Business Like Show Business (1954)\n\nThe Seven Year Itch (1955)\n\nBus Stop (1956)\n\nThe Prince and the Showgirl (1957)\n\nSome Like It Hot (1959)\n\nNOTE: One thing to remember! Regular women of the 1950’s did not go parading around showing cleavage or wearing skin-tight clothing and unabashedly showing off their body parts. That came way, way later. Sexual images of the sultry, breast bearing and scantily clad women that we have from the 1950’s come almost exclusively from Hollywood Stars and Pin Up magazines from that era. That kind of dress and behavior was strictly limited to the Silver Screen and magazines of that nature. It was not appropriate for the mainstream streets of society. Everyday people of that time dressed extremely conservatively. (I am not condemning or condoning either type of person, I’m just making a historical note.)\n\nMusic in 50’s Movies\n\nIn the 1950’s, music was a big deal, and it played a big role in movies as well. There were movies like Singin’ in The Rain with Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds (1952), several Bing Crosby films including Anything Goes (1956) and The Bachelor (with Debbie Reynolds again, featuring the hit song “Tammy”, 1957)\n\nBut! The most exciting movies were the ones that featured the brand new music genre called Rock n Roll! The first movies to feature Rock n Roll starred Bill Haley and HIS Comets: Rock Around The Clock (1956) and Don’t Knock The Rock (with Little Richard, also 1956). Bill Haley was also featured in the West German film Heir Bin Ich, Heir Bleib Ich (1959)\n\nRocker Eddie Cochran also starred in 3 films before his untimely death in 1960: The Girl Can’t Help It (featuring Little Richard, 1956), Untamed Youth (1957) and Go Johnny Go (also with Little Richard and Jimmy Clanton, 1959)\n\nStarring… Elvis Presley!\n\nOf course, the most prominent Rock n Roll star to grace the Silver Screen was The King himself, Elvis Presley. Elvis’ movies in the 1950’s decade were Love Me Tender (1956), Jailhouse Rock (1957), Loving You (also 1957) and King Creole (1958)\n\nLove Me Tender was Elvis’ Big Screen debut and featured the #1 hit song of the same name. The other songs were “Let Me”, “Poor Boy” and “We’re Gonna Move”. Jailhouse Rock featured the #1 hit title song as well as “(You’re So Square) Baby I Don’t Care”. Loving You featured the hit song “Teddy Bear”, among others, while King Creole featured the title song and several others.\n\nWesterns & Creature Features\n\nTwo HUGE trends in movies of the 50’s were Westerns and Monster Movies (also known as “Creature Features”)\n\nThe Westerns correlated with the overall cowboy trend of the day. Some popular Western-themed films in the 50’s were: Gregory Peck in Only The Valiant (1951), Fess Parker in Thunder Over The Plains (1953), James Stewart in The Man From Laramie (1955), John Wayne with Sophia Loren in The Legend of the Lost (1957), Gary Cooper in The Man of the West (1958) and many, many more.\n\nCreature features were sometimes shown back to back as a “Double Creature Feature” They might not have been award-winning, but they were great films to watch cuddling with that special guy or gal! Mid-century monster movies introduced the world to some great creepy classics such as The Thing (1951), Creature From The Black Lagoon (1954), Godzilla (1954), Tarantula (1955), The Creature Walks Among Us (1956), The Giant Claw (1957) Invasion of the Saucer Men (1957), I Was A Teenage Werewolf (1957), The Blob (1958), The Crawling Eye (1958), The Fly (starring Vincent Price, 1958) and The Mummy (1959)\n\nThere were a LOT more so if you like monster movies, I suggest you check ’em out!\n\nComedies with Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis!\n\nComedies are always popular at the movies and in the 50’s this was no exception! The most popular comedic team of the decade was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis (never to be confused with Jerry Lee Lewis, the musician) who starred together in a total of 16 movies during the 1950’s, including: Hollywood or Bust (1956) Most of their films contained slapstick comedy and a silly plot, but back in the day, they were the bees knees.\n\nAnd now… some Mid-Century Movie Trivia!\n\nThere were no MPAA ratings in the 1950’s. The MPAA did not start rating films until 1968. (I’m guessing children were not allowed into some movies, like the ones where Marilyn and Liz ran around in their skivvies.)\n\nThe cost of a movie ticket in 1955 was about 25 cents.\n\nMany times there were two movies back to back for the price of one called a “Double Feature”.\n\nSome theaters offered raffles and prizes to patrons.\n\nMovies in the 50’s were called either “Pictures” or “Movie-Shows”\n\nDespite TV being in black and white, movies in the 50’s were introduced in Technicolor. Many ladies began wearing slightly more colorful make-up such as eyeshadows and bright red lipstick when they saw their favorite stars wearing it.\n\nThe 1950’s was the era in which the 3-D movie came to be. 3-D glasses are still used today in some movies, but lesser so with today’s new technology.\n\nDisney released 9 movies in the 1950’s, both animated and live-action.\n\nAlright, folks, that’s it for this section of Life in the 50’s!
