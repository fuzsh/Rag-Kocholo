        "text": "The toss, of a 50‐cent piece in the office of Alfred G. Vanderbilt, the chair man of the New York Racing Associa tion, decided the ownership of Secre tariat, who seeks the final leg of the Triple Crown in the Belmont Stakes today.\n\nRecalling that day in 1969 over luncheon earlier this week, Mrs. John B. Tweedy, who manages the Meadow Stable, Secretariat's owner, on behalf of the estate of her late father, Chris topher T. Chenery, said, “The marvelous thing about it was that we lost it.”\n\nFor the slim, blond Mrs. Tweedy, the three weeks since her colt, who has been heralded as a super horse, won the Preakness, the second leg of the Triple Crown—the first is the Kentucky Derby—has been a happy but acceler atingly hectic period of press and tele vision interviews, business conferences and social events, capped on Thursday night by the Belmont Ball.\n\n‘18 Hours a Day’\n\n“All Secretariat has to do is run a little early in the morning and then spend the rest of the day eating and sleeping, but it seems as though I'm on the run 18 hours a day,” she said.\n\nThe rich and socially prominent fam ilies who control thoroughbred racing in the state have generally been regarded as stiff‐necked if not moss covered in their attitude toward the sportsmen who sit in the grandstand in their undershirts and line up before the $2 window, but there has clearly been a change this year.\n\nThe growing popularity of offtrack betting has caused a corresponding slump in track attendance and pari mutuel handle, and in an effort to off set this decline, the mandarins of racing are trying to emphasize the pleasures of attendance at beautiful Belmont and less beautiful Aqueduct by emphasizing the attractive qualities of Mrs. Tweedy and her magnificent colt.\n\n“It was all part of a very complicated arrangement that father had made years before with Ogden Phipps,” said Mrs. Tweedy, returning to the coin toss. “They had agreed that each season Mr. Phipps's great sire, Bold Ruler, would be bred to two of my father's brood mares.\n\n“Every two years they flipped a coin,” she continued. “The winner had first choice of the two foals that year and the loser had first choice the year after.”\n\nMrs. Tweedy, who assumed the man agement of the stable in October, 1967, after, her father's mental faculties be came clouded by age—he died last January at the age of 86—had renewed the agreement with Mr. Phipps, whose family's Wheatley Stable is one of the great names in thoroughbred, racing.\n\n“I don't mind saying that I did so with some reluctance,” she said. “I didn't think it had been a particularly good thing for us from a business point of view, but I finally decided we would go on for two more years and then be through with it.”\n\nAt the time of the coin toss, the two Chenery mares selected in 1969 had al ready foaled. One of them, Something royal, had been impregnated, again by Bold Ruler but the second mare, Cicada, had not conceived.\n\n“I hoped we would lose the toss,” Mrs. Tweedy said, “and have second choice of the two 1969 foals because we already knew that there wouldn't be any second choice in 1970. Thank goodness, that's just what happened.” The colt that was foaled in March, 1970, turned out to be Secretariat, of course.\n\nConsidering that he has al ready won $804,202 in purses, will be the odds‐on choice to win the first money of $90,720 in the Belmont, will probably race through the summer and fall, and has been sold, efefctive Nov. 15, to a breeding syndicate for $6,080,000, it is unlikely that a coin toss has ever been more valuable to a winner.\n\nSteely Determination\n\nIn fact, it was doubly val uable, Mrs. Tweedy said, since without the syndication, the taxes on her father's estate might have forced the sale of the stable and the study which she had con tinued to operate against the advice of her family's busi ness advisers.\n\n“Secretariat was really a sort of deus ex machina for us,” she said. “He came along at exactly the right time. And what I thought was particularly nice was that Mr. Phipps was the first subscriber to the syndicate.”\n\nMr. Phipps, a remote and powerful figure on the turf, said that business rather than sentiment had decided his $190,000 investment. “It's un likely that any of his off spring will be as good as Secretariat,” he said, “but then again a horse doesn't have to be that good to be successful.”\n\n“I was determined to keep the stable operating,” said Mrs. Tweedy in a subsequent conversation. She made the statement pleasantly enough, but beneath the reserve that underlies her unaffectedly pleasant manner, it was not hard to sense steely deter mination.\n\n“The stable had been my father's main interest for the last 25 years of his life,” she said. “I had never had any thing much to do with it—it was very much a one‐man opeartion—but I felt great affection for him and great loyalty to the enterprise that he had invested so much time and effort in building up.\n\n“He was a self‐made man who had passed on the fruits of his labor and his stand ards to his children,” she went on, “and I didn't think we ought to destroy them, and certainly not while he was still alive.”\n\nMr. Chenery, an engineer, made a considerable fortune organizing public utilities holding companies and was chairman of the Southern Natural Resources Corpora tion. In 1936 he bought his family's estate as Doswell, Va., about 20 miles north of Richmond, which had been lost after the Civil War. He established the Meadow Stud there and ultimately enlarged it to a 2,600‐acre showplace with 30 employes.\n\nAlthough he owned 41 stakes winners, and became himself a power in racing as a member of the Jockey Club committee that evolved into the New York Racing Asso ciation, it was not until Riva Ridge won the Derby and the Belmont last year that a horse carrying his royal blue and‐white silks won a Triple Crown event.\n\nAn Active Life\n\n“I rode,” said Mrs. Tweedy, “but I never had much to do with racing. I was away at school when father began, and then there was college” —she was graduated from Madeira and Smith—and then I was with the Red Cross in France for two years during World War II. After the war I enrolled in the School of Business at Colum bia University. It was proba bly my father's influence am the youngest of his three children and the closest to him in many ways, I think.”\n\nAt Columbia she met Jack Tweedy, a young veteran who served with the Office of Strategic Services in Bur ma and was enrolled in the Law School. They were mar ried soon after and when he was graduated and began his practice in Denver, Mrs. Tweedy withdrew from school without completing her master's thesis.\n\nThe Tweedys raised four children, the youngest of whom, a son, is away at prep school, and they skiied—they were among the founders of Vail Village—and rode to hounds in a countryside where the quarry is coyotes rather than foxes.\n\nA couple of years ago Mr. Tweedy became executive vice president of the OH Shale Corporation, which he had served as outside coun sel, and the family moved to the North Shore of Long Is land. It's a pleasant house but in size and staff—one part‐time cleaning woman— a long way from the Gold Coast establishments of the Phippses, the Vanderbilts and the Whitneys.\n\nJack Tweedy takes no ac tive part in the management of the stable, but his support has been crucial to her, Mrs. Tweedy, whose first name is Helen but who prefers to be called Penny, said.\n\n“When the other members of the family asked, Can Penny really do this?” she recalled, “Jack assured them that he thought I could.”\n\nHowever, the stable lost $85,000 in the first year that she managed it—only the second losing year since it was incorporated in 1956— and once again she had to resist strong arguments against selling it and invest ing the proceeds in a still ris ing stock market.\n\nSensing that her father's long‐time trainer, Casey Hayes, was having difficulty in working with her, she re placed him with Roger Lau rin, and when he resigned in 1971 to train the larger and then more successful Phipps horses, she engaged his fa ther, Lucien Laurin, a shrewd, silver‐haired former jockey and, like Secretariat's rider, Ron Turcotte, a French Cana dian.\n\n“Roger taught me how to cut overhead and to diversi fy bloodlines by going to other sires,” she said. “He really got us organized. When I needed additional advice I would call up Bull Hancock, who ran the Clai borne stud and had always been a great friend of my father's. “You're going to make it, so don't worry,” he would tell me. “You're smart, you pay attention, you'll learn.” pay attention, you'll learn.’”\n\nMrs. Tweedy produced a $65,000 profit in her second year, muting the criticism. “It was a $150,000 turn around,” she said, “but until Riva Ridge came along I was fighting a holding action.”\n\nAnother crisis followed Mr. Chenery's death. He had provided for the orderly transfer of most of his as sets many years earlier, but the estate taxes oil his horses alone would have forced the sale of many of them if Secretariat's enor mous success as a 2‐year‐old had not made it possible to arrange the largest syndica tion sale in the history of the turf within a month of his death.\n\nThirty‐two shares were sold at $190,000 each. Each gives the owner the right to breed a mare to Secretariat once a year for the rest of his life, which is likely to be 20 years or more. In addi tion, four shares are held by the Hancock interests, four by Meadow Stable and one by Lucien Laurin.\n\nHowever, Mrs. Tweedy not ed, the sale does not become final until Secretariat has proved his prowess as a sire. He is still a virgin and there is always the chance that he may prove to be sterile, im potent or even homosexual. To guard against the eventu alities as well as disablement or death he is insured for his syndication value. The pre mium for this year is $500, 000.\n\nSecretariat was named by Elizabeth Ham, Mr. Chenery's confidential assistant for 35 years and the ‐executrix of his estate, who had previ ously worked for the old League of Nations in Geneva.\n\nIn appearange he suggests not simply good health and virility but immortality. He is a colt that myths are made about. His coat is reddish chestnut. Old‐timers say that it is about the same shade, and a rare one in horses, as that of Man o' War, perhaps the greatest horse in the his tory of the American turf.\n\nAt 1,150 pounds and 16 hands 1½ inches from hoof to shoulder — a hand is 4 inches — he is somewhat larger than the average thor oughbred. His muscles ripple under his coat and his eyes are said to be singularly in telligent and watchful.\n\nPermissive Education\n\nIn his cottage alongside the barn at Belmont, Lucien Laurin said one day last week of Secretariat, “He was so damned good‐looking when I got him that I said to my self that he probably wouldn't be worth 10 cents as a racer.”\n\nIt was not until last July that Secretariat made his first start. Now, less than a year later, he is unquestion ably the most famous name on the turf. Today he will have the chance to become the first Triple Crown winner since Citation in 1948."
