        "text": "Script written by Max Lett.\n\n#10: “Guys and Dolls” (1955)\n\nThe biggest game of craps has come back to town and incorrigible gambler Nathan Detroit has to put it all together. The only problem is a guy can’t quite ignore a doll. While the song and dance numbers in this film are incredible and have become classics, the comedy is just as sharp and laughs abound. With great performances by Frank Sinatra, Jean Simmons and Marlon Brando, “Guys and Dolls” is romance, comedy and music all dressed up to make one fine package.\n\n#9: “Summer Stock” (1950)\n\nThe ‘50s were rife with great musical numbers and dances, but “Summer Stock” also manages to inject a whole lotta comedy into the mix as well. This Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production follows Jane, a farm owner who gets more than she bargained for when a troupe of actors, including her sister, uses her barnyard as a playhouse. Gene Kelly and Judy Garland manage to put on a pithy show while never abandoning that good old ‘50s romance. The result is this sweet, happy and funny little film.\n\n#8: “The Court Jester” (1955)\n\nTalk about a tongue twister! Before there was “Robin Hood: Men in Tights,” there was “The Court Jester.” In this madcap comedy, an unwitting spy infiltrates the ranks of the king as a jester in order to usurp him and reveal the true ruler. Thrilling stuff, right? The only drawback is that Hawkins, the Jester, isn’t quite up to the task. But with the help of a powerful witch, he manages to hold his own – and get us laughing!\n\n#7: “Calamity Jane” (1953)\n\nWesterns aren’t just rough and tough action shoot ‘em ups - and nothing proves that better than this one starring Doris Day. She portrays the historical title character known for her skills with a gun and her tall tales. Day successfully multi-tasks by singing, shooting and showing off her comedy chops in the film. And while “Calamity Jane”’s banter is certainly a high point, as with most ‘50s comedies, romance also finds a way in.\n\n#6: “Funny Face” (1957)\n\nIn “Funny Face,” a bookshop clerk’s mundane life is turned upside down when a fashion photographer makes her a tempting offer. We see Jo Stockton go from shy sales girl to “Quality” Woman. Unfortunately, things don’t turn out quite the way they are supposed when she realizes that the glamorous life isn’t what she expected. Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire are the perfect pair, and the film itself is elegant, timeless and stylish.\n\n#5: “Roman Holiday” (1953)\n\nWhen it came to movies in the 1950s, comedy and romance were often mentioned in the same breath. A little chemistry goes a long way in highlighting a film’s funnier moments, and in this romantic comedy starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, the laughs come with the love. Reporter Joe Bradley sees a golden opportunity when Princess Ann escapes her royal duties to live life and the two begin falling in love. A box office hit, “Roman Holiday” won 3 Oscars - and our hearts.\n\n#4: “Harvey” (1950)\n\nThere’s just something about giant imaginary bunnies in cinema. In this fantasy comedy starring Jimmy Stewart, Elwood Dowd is a cheerful, down-to-earth kinda guy, except for one thing: Harvey. While most people think Elwood’s bunny friend is imaginary, strange things seem to be happening all around. With an Oscar-winning performance from Josephine Hull and an Oscar-nominated performance from Stewart, “Harvey” is a naïve but hilarious comedy that still holds up today.\n\n#3: “The Seven Year Itch” (1955)\n\nWhat happens when a man’s family goes on vacation and he meets a beautiful new neighbor? Things start heating up, of course. When Richard Sherman and The Girl start spending time together, he starts to feel the so-called seven year itch: a sudden need to be unfaithful. But what really makes this film adaptation of the play of the same name so memorable is Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell’s strained chemistry, which spawns lot of laughs and iconic moments.\n\n#2: “Singin’ in the Rain” (1952)\n\nDuring a decade when movies needed a little something extra to draw in audiences comes this musical comedy starring Gene Kelly, Donald O’Connor and Debbie Reynolds. Song and dance take center-stage in “Singin’ in the Rain,” which finds its actors on the cusp of a cinematic revolution. Set in the late ‘20s, things go awry for the era of silent Hollywood films when talkies come around. But luckily, a flourishing romance manages to save the day – as does the flick’s song and dance numbers as well as some legendary performances.\n\nBefore we unveil our pick for Comedy of the 1950s, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n- “The Ladykillers” (1955)\n\n- “Mister Roberts” (1955)\n\n- “The Naked Truth” (1957)\n\n- “Pillow Talk” (1959)\n\n#1: “Some Like it Hot” (1959)\n\nThe ‘50s were a simpler time; you could get a good laugh just by throwing on women’s clothing and a high-pitched voice. Alright, so that gag is actually still funny today, but back then, Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon really did it with style. In this off-kilter comedy, musicians Joe and Jerry go under cover as women after they witness a mob hit. The only problem is life seems better than ever as the fairer sex. And then there’s Marilyn Monroe. “Some Like It Hot,” indeed.\n\nDo you agree with our list? What’s your favorite 1950s comedy?
