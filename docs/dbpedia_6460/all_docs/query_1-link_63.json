We need to rebuild. Your hair is so brittle.\n\n“Other than that, you look good.”\n\nWelcome to Plymouth-based Style & Grace, the modern girl’s pageant school. While some other pageant trainers continue to teach the dated T-stance and a trotlike kick walk, Style & Grace tells its clients to muscle up and perfect a runway-worthy strut. The young owners walk their own talk: Professional model Erica Nego, 25, was Miss Minnesota USA 2009. She won the first pageant she entered. Partner Ashley Hawks, 24, has been modeling professionally since childhood. She works runways all over the country and models in print ads for major companies like Target.\n\nHawks is the daughter of a pageant queen and says her mom was always on her case about posture and manners. Nego’s late father was royalty in Ghana. She spent three months a year there as a child and was expected to know when to curtsy and which fork to use first.\n\nThe two are their own best advertisement: tall, gorgeous, graceful and polite. They stand perfectly straight, shake hands firmly, listen intently, smile often and talk about the weather in the same caring but succinct manner they might use to answer a pageant question about global warming. They throw coins into a penance jar on the rare occasion when a curse word slips out.\n\nStyle & Grace teaches etiquette, too. Nego and Hawks think manners help girls get ahead in the world, and knowing how to walk in a dress helps, too.\n\nSince opening last fall, the two have coached 40 aspiring pageant queens and models, including several willing to travel cross-country for their expertise. Their clients include Miss Wyoming, who placed in the top 15 at the Miss USA pageant, and Miss Colorado, who made it to the top 5. They also helped “Shop NBC” host Wendi Russo, 43, earn the title of Mrs. Minnesota United States.\n\n“They have a fresh, young approach to doing pageants,” says Russo, who will compete in the Mrs. United States pageant Thursday in Las Vegas. “They want you to really stand out from the crowd.”\n\nCourtney Rishavy, a student at Winona State University, hopes that attitude will finally get her crowned Miss Minnesota in her fifth run for the title. She came close in 2009 when she made the top five but lost to Nego. Now, she listens intently as Nego advises her to form a concise opinion on feminism and to avoid placing a hand on the widest part of her hip.\n\nNego and Hawks tell Rishavy how to embrace her Republican politics without offending judges who might have different views (adding “in my opinion” helps, they say) and then glide right into eliminating the bounce in Rishavy’s walk. Raise that derriere to avoid “creasing,” they say. Fingers together when posing hand on hip. Knit-picky, to be sure, but there’s a larger purpose to it all, they insist.\n\n“We’re giving girls a bag of tricks,” Hawks says. “When you feel prepared for a pageant, you’re ready to thrive and succeed in life.”\n\nAdds Nego, “We’re giving girls an opportunity to shine.”\n\nThat and a thesaurus. Nego and Hawks dug into one to help Rishavy come up with words to describe herself beyond “upbeat.”\n\n“Elaborate,” Nego advised. “We’re talking about pageant girls here. They’re all upbeat.”\n\nAllison Kaplan can be reached at 651-228-5116.\n\nHOW TO BE A QUEEN\n\nFive personal improvement tips from Style & Grace academy for pageants, modeling and etiquette:\n\n1. Say please and thank you.\n\n2. Don’t swear. “You look ignorant when you curse,” says coach Ashley Hawks. “Use your brain to describe how and why you’re upset.”\n\n3. Learn how to walk in heels and do your makeup.\n\n4. Dress for your body type. If you’re not sure how, take advantage of free personal shoppers at department stores.\n\n5. Shoulders back, butt up and cross your ankles when you sit.\n\nLearn more about Style & Grace at styleandgrace.com\n\nOriginally Published: July 17, 2010 at 11:01 p.m."
