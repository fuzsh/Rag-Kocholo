        "text": "Seventy years ago, 1950 hit. It was the middle of the century. After the second World War came the urgency for artists to share their sides of the story, from all over the world. Meanwhile, in good old Hollywood, the Hays Code continued to dominate features; however, this stifling of creativity led towards large epics that stayed within these rules, or rebellious works that stepped on them as much as was possible. Then came television, when the idea of the nuclear family could be sold in many capacities, and was transferring in its own little way onto the bigger screen. Technicolor was now becoming more popular, but the full transition to colour just wasn’t happening yet; the past was being held on to.\n\nStrangely enough, the 1950’s were full of many changes, yet the decade acts mainly as a bridge between the 1940’s (when Hollywood was at its most signature state, and world cinema was starting to really leave its own mark) and the 1960’s (when every rule was destroyed, and all styles merged together to revitalize cinema). Nonetheless, the ‘50s still carry so many powerful works, from golden age icons that were making their final statements, to auteurs of the future that were ready to break this medium wide open. One thing to remember is that 1950 was also only twenty three years after talking pictures became mainstream and overtook the silent era completely, so the advancements of cinema are hugely noticeable with this comparison.\n\nBefore counterculture, culture was defined in other ways. Music was starting to find its own footing. Again, television was born, and changing how visual storytelling was consumed. There was a certain identity that youths were developing, and the world was following suit; with so many years of civilization seeing (in motion) how the world was run, things like fashion and decor changed like never before. Now, I do have to remind the fact that many narrow minded ideas and stereotypes were still being promoted above the voices of the marginalized around this time, so “culture” was still skewed enough to not encompass all ideas. Still, I find so much context in these following one hundred pictures, which all embody the same idea that most ‘50s film carried: this is the best that cinema will get, and the formula has been perfected. While that wasn’t the case and the medium evolved, you will certainly find many of cinema’s finest hours here, as these selections are all exemplary in many ways. Far from the end of the road for film, but rather the end of a specific chapter, the ‘50s carry so much of film’s golden age in a myriad of ways, as well as world cinema’s influence overall. And now, it’s time to dive right in. Here are the best one hundred films of the 1950’s.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven’t included documentaries, or any film that is considerably enough of a documentary (mockumentaries don’t count). I haven’t forgotten about films like Night and Fog or The Mystery of Picasso. I’m keeping them in mind for later (wink wink).\n\nBe sure to check out my other Best 100 lists of every decade here.\n\n12. The 400 Blows\n\nWhile the '50s contained a number of works that helped shape the upcoming French New Wave movement, François Truffaut’s debut classic The 400 Blows felt like the definitive start to the movement, clear as day. It certainly is easy to label the film as such, given its graceful depiction of youthful mischief in a way that called back to the cinema of attractions, where capturing anything on film was something to behold. When Antoine skips class to explore the town, we see a difficult child mature. Society gets the best of him and delivers his comeuppance for his lies and troublesome behaviour, it's as if we're seeing someone being held back, mainly because of their own doings of course. We freeze on a single glance with eternity reflecting in Antoine’s eyes, unsure of whether or not he will be okay, stripped away from civilization’s clutches. Cinema was in a similar spot. Seeing that The 400 Blows is still perfect sixty years later, it seems like veering off course is sometimes worth it.\n\n8. Singin’ in the Rain\n\nBetween the colourful Stanley Donen and the perfectionist Gene Kelly, at least one feature they would collaborate on would have to be good. Well, Singin’ in the Rain is beyond good. It is, without question (for us, at least), the musical of musicals, the most joyful production, and a contender for best-of lists of all sorts (including my own). Musically alone, Singin’ in the Rain reimagines classic songs as its own, giving new life in a way that has rendered these standards as this film's own. Then, there is the commentary on the transitional period between silent films and talkies, told with highs, lows, and everything in between. The romance at the heart of this film is so warm, too. Have all of these components collide at the end, and you have a film that's sure to cure any sadness you previously had (even for a little while).\n\n1. Tokyo Story\n\nYasujirō Ozu always put family first, hence why the bulk of his films deal with life at home. In his filmography, Ozu attempted every which way to create something out of all of the images of our own lives that we overlook. He loved static shots that sat in place, framing every image like a living photograph. He adored depth, having every single aspect of a room — including the ceiling — become a character of a picture. Characters look straight onto a camera’s gaze, as if they’re talking to us, and we’re both participants of a conversation. This formula (amongst the other parts that made it up) worked for many of Ozu’s films, but they were bound to really come together in unspeakable ways at least once. I’d argue this happened a handful of times: Late Spring, Floating Weeds, and more. His clear greatest achievement is the one film where all of this blends to the point of singular brilliance, and that’s Tokyo Story.\n\nStill images of settings and life turn segues between sequences into passages of time, as if we’re feeling life rush past us. We sit on the floor with characters in their homes, and are drawn in by every word that they speak. We try our best to read through pleasant faces, figuring out what people actually feel; when characters finally break, we feel every ounce of pain or joy spill out. Ozu captures the spirit within people unlike any other director before or after him. This is a film run entirely by the fires within, and we notice — like the dropping of a pound of bricks — whenever one of those fires go out, either by death or the inability to find joy in living from here on out. We try to savour each and every conversation, even though the world speeds past us. Experiencing Tokyo Story is witnessing the curses and blessings of time both at the same time, where joys finish right away and sadness is permanent.\n\nIt’s impossible to show why Tokyo Story is cinematic perfection just with still images or clips alone; other films of this stature don’t have this problem. It’s one of those times where you just have to watch it to understand its power. From start to finish, Tokyo Story is such a unique experience, even compared to Ozu’s other similar works. Just like life itself, brief examples of it don’t tell the full picture. You need to see why a daughter in law has a stronger connection to her departed husband’s parents than their own children for Ozu’s domestic poetry to hit. You must absorb every cutaway that documents the beauty of existence. Tokyo Story is a deeply moving picture that never feels artificial, even with its subject matter. Its impact on us as viewers long after we’ve seen it (and for the rest of our lives) is why it is the best film of the 1950’s."
