        "text": "Full List\n\nThe 101 Funniest Screenplays list was announced on November 15, 2015. The writing credits noted are based on that date.\n\n1 Annie Hall (1977)\n\nWritten by Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman\n\nFunnily enough, Woody Allen was trying to break away from being so funny. He and Marshall Brickman wanted to call their film Anhedonia (psychiatric term meaning the inability to experience pleasure). “I wanted to do a movie that might not have anything funny in it for a minute...\n\n2 Some Like it Hot (1959)\n\nScreenplay by Billy Wilder & I.A.L. Diamond, Based on the German film Fanfare of Love by Robert Thoeren and M. Logan\n\nGreat comedies wreak havoc on conventional wisdom, and Some Like it Hot changed what comedies could be in Hollywood – to wit, a pastiche of genres, including a throwback gangster film...\n\n3 Groundhog Day (1993)\n\nScreenplay by Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis, Story by Danny Rubin\n\nHarold Ramis read Danny Rubin’s script and imagined an updating of It’s A Wonderful Life. Rubin hadn’t set out to write a Capra-esque parable, exactly. “When I first designed the original screenplay, it was almost like an experiment,” Rubin said at the 2015 Austin Film Festival...\n\n4 Airplane! (1980)\n\nWritten by James Abrahams & David Zucker & Jerry Zucker\n\nLong before it became de rigueur for dramatic actors to spoof their own gravitas, the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams deployed Robert Stack, Peter Graves, Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Nielsen beautifully in the tour de force of silliness that was Airplane!...\n\n5 Tootsie (1982)\n\nScreenplay by Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal, Story by Don McGuire and Larry Gelbart\n\nThe elevator pitch – an out-of-work actor becomes a cause célèbre while disguised as a woman on a soap opera – fails to capture what made Tootsie feel hilarious and monumental. “'In my very first meeting with Larry Gelbart, I said, `If in 1982 a man puts on a dress...\n\n6 Young Frankenstein (1974)\n\nScreenplay by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, Screen Story by Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks, Based on Characters in the Novel Frankenstein by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley\n\n“At the top of the page I wrote, ‘Young Frankenstein,’ and then wrote two pages of what might happen to me if I were the great grandson of Beaufort von Frankenstein...\n\n7 Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964)\n\nScreenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Peter George and Terry Southern\n\nNo other anti-war film – much-less anti-war comedy – surpasses Stanley Kubrick’s film in the canon of contemporary cinema. George Plimpton recalled in Harper’s magazine that Peter Sellers had read Terry Southern’s comic novel The Magic Christian and gave a copy to Kubrick...\n\n8 Blazing Saddles\n\nScreenplay by Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, Alan Uger, Story by Andrew Bergman\n\nIn the writers’ room were Mel Brooks, Richard Pryor, Norman Steinberg, Alan Uger, and 26-year-old Andrew Bergman. “The thing I remember them saying is that comedy is like poetry...\n\n9 Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)\n\nWritten by Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin\n\nIt’s a quest movie that gave us the line, “It’s only a flesh wound.” A send-up of Middle Age barbarity and “Sir Arthur, King of the Britons” (crickets), the movie further embedded the Pythons into the American comedy consciousness after their TV series Monty Python’s Flying Circus...\n\n10 National Lampoon’s Animal House (1978)\n\nWritten by Harold Ramis & Douglas Kenney & Chris Miller\n\nReleased in 1978 and written by Ramis along with National Lampoon stalwarts Doug Kenney (Harvard, class of ’68), and Chris Miller (Dartmouth, class of ’63), Animal House set box office records for a comedy. Though plenty crude, by moving the film’s time and place...\n\n11 This is Spinal Tap (1984)\n\nWritten by Christopher Guest & Michael McKean & Rob Reiner & Harry Shearer\n\nThe script ran to four pages, said writer-director Rob Reiner. There was a character bible on bandmates Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls, and an outline of their “Smell the Glove” tour. From there, Reiner and writer-performers...\n\n12 The Producers (1967)\n\nWritten by Mel Brooks\n\n“Where did I go right?” cries Max Bialystock, when his Hitler musical leaves them roaring. Mel Brooks won an Oscar and a Writers Guild Award for best original screenplay. On the DVD re-release in 2008, Brooks said the Bialystock character was based on a producer Brooks worked for...\n\n13 The Big Lebowski (1998)\n\nWritten by Ethan Coen & Joel Coen\n\nSimilar to other films on this list – Duck Soup, Office Space, and Harold and Maude – The Big Lebowski was not embraced as a classic when it hit theaters, its genius rediscovered on home video, almost as if it had originally been censored by the authorities...\n\n14 Ghostbusters (1984)\n\nWritten by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis\n\n“I thought to marry the old ’30s ghost comedies with the real vernacular, and the technical language of real ghost hunting, like Hans Holzer’s work, and [William G. Roll], and the Maimonides Dream Lab,” Dan Aykroyd told Howard Stern recently...\n\n15 When Harry Met Sally… (1989)\n\nWritten by Nora Ephron\n\nThe premise, Nora Ephron told Written By, felt believable and bigger than itself as soon as director Rob Reiner described it to her: A man and a woman, both coming out of relationships, meet. They decide not to have sex because it will ruin the friendship. Then they have sex...\n\n16 Bridesmaids (2011)\n\nWritten by Annie Mumolo & Kristen Wiig\n\nWait, so women can actually be funny and make a blockbuster comedy? That was the news flash after Bridesmaids stormed the box office. Co-writers Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, who had met as writer-performers in the Los Angeles improv company The Groundlings...\n\n17 Duck Soup (1933)\n\nStory by Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, Additional Dialogue by Arthur Sheekman and Nat Perrin\n\nDuck Soup is the film that Harold Bloom called one of the great works of art of the past century,” noted critic Dana Stevens in The New York Times. “It’s one of the movies T. S. Eliot wanted to discuss when he met with Groucho in 1964, and the one that inspired Woody Allen’s character...\n\n18 There’s Something About Mary (1998)\n\nScreenplay by John J. Strauss & Ed Decter and Peter Farrelly & Bobby Farrelly, Story by Ed Decter & John J. Strauss\n\nSomething about this box office hit (penis caught in zipper and/or semen ending up as hair gel?) put it in the crosshairs of a cultural argument about “gross-out comedy” and a pushback...\n\n19 The Jerk (1979)\n\nScreenplay by Steve Martin, Carl Gottlieb, Michael Elias, Story by Steve Martin & Carl Gottlieb\n\n“I had an idea for a film,” Steve Martin writes in his memoir, Born Standing Up. “It came from a line in my act: ‘It wasn’t always easy for me. I was born a poor black child.’” In trying to place himself in the wider world, the rube Navin R. Johnson considers getting listed in the phonebook...\n\n20 A Fish Called Wanda (1988)\n\nScreenplay by John Cleese, Story by John Cleese & Charles Crichton\n\nA lively jewel heist farce, involving two American grifters, one of whom consumes goldfish, a British gangster, his stuttering subordinate, and Cleese himself as a seduced barrister.
