This romantic comedy covers incredibly familiar territory. Most mature viewers will recognize it as just another spin on How Stella Got Her Groove Back: An "uptight" woman is too closed off to realize her own beauty until a gorgeous, international man shows her the way. In addition to the "love, international style" formula, there's also the theme of wacky strangers on vacation together. Vardalos is sweet, sunny, and charming, but there's not much for her to do but pout about her current circumstances and make moon faces at Poupi.

The script is the picture of predictability, and the only viewer who could doubt that Georgia and Poupi will have a mind-blowing affair is one who's never seen a romantic comedy. But if you're in the mood for an evening of amusing fluff, familiar humor, and an uncomplicated romance, MY LIFE IN RUINS will do.
