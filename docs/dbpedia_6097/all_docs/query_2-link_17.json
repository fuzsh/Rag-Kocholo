I did, in fact, eat the this up.\n\nrtc\n\n~\n\nI am a trash raccoon and will gladly devour this when it comes out.\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\ni mean, its JLA. no one should be surprised that im giving this 5 stars.\n\nbecause, with new every book, she just continues to tick all of the right boxes.\n\n‚úì ideal balance between fantasy and romance elements\n\n‚úì good world-building and plot development (a little slow in the beginning but the middle to end make up for it)\n\n‚úì the kind of romance with equal parts angst and swoon-worthiness\n\n‚úì easy, breezy, bingable writing\n\ni am and will forever be a JLA fan.\n\n‚Ü† 5 stars\n\nJune 27, 2024\n\nHonestly, one of my guilty pleasures is diving into another well-written Jennifer L. Armentrout fantasy. I find myself in my dimly lit study, sipping red wine, and immersing myself in the captivating fictional world she has created. Her characters never fail to engage me, and with each chapter, the tension builds and the chemistry between them becomes more intense.\n\nIn her latest installment, she has once again delivered a compelling story. She introduces us to an amazing, badass heroine whom I adore even more than her previous characters. This feisty, caring, and determined protagonist steals the spotlight in every chapter. And let's not forget about our charismatic and mysterious hero, Thorne. The enemies-to-lovers and hate-at-first-sight dynamic between them, fueled by their witty banter, provides immense satisfaction as we delve into their action-packed and tense journey.\n\nOur protagonist, Calista, is a gifted mind reader who grew up as an orphan on the streets, struggling with poverty and abandonment. However, her luck changes when she becomes the secret courtesan of Baron Archwood in exchange for protection. But one day, her intuition leads her to a traveling prince who is in the midst of a great turmoil. Her courageous act lands her a position as the prince's traveling companion, thrusting her into a world of rebellion, terror, and fist fights. Calista finds herself torn between her intuition, which may save her from danger, and her heart, which pulls her towards a potentially doomed fate.\n\nWithout giving too much away, be prepared for classic Armentrout-style big cliffhangers and jaw-dropping twists throughout the book.\n\nAlthough the book is quite long and has an extra slow burn, which is the only reason I lowered my rating, it is definitely worth your time. It features a plethora of well-developed supporting characters who are easy to connect with. The detailed and vividly depicted dystopian meets high fantasy world building, along with the intricately crafted magic system, is executed flawlessly. Personally, I found myself more attached to the main characters in this series than those in her previous works (especially Poppy, as mentioned before). The cliffhanger at the end left me reeling, and I am eagerly anticipating what will happen next in the story. I simply cannot wait to read the next book.\n\nI would like to express my gratitude to NetGalley and Tor Publishing Group/Bramble for providing me with a digital reviewer copy of this unputdownable book in exchange for my honest thoughts.\n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in reading my extended book reviews, movie critiques, and hilarious astrology articles, be sure to check out my Medium account using the link below:\n\nmedium.com\n\ninstagram\n\nfacebook\n\ntwitter\n\nOctober 10, 2023\n\n\"My Hyhborn prince. My salvation.\n\nAnd my doom.\"\n\nTHAT'S HOW IT ENDS?! üò≠üò≠ I need more JLA üò≠üò≠\n\nSo am not gonna lie and say that this book was perfect, it wasn't. But at the same time I LOVED it and it's imperfections cause the writing has improved big time, believe you me.\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Forced proximity\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Slow burn\n\n‚úîÔ∏è Spicyyyyy (4.5/5) üå∂\n\nCalista's intuition is her power, and it never fails. She knows her value and in order to stay hidden, she lives hidden with the Baron of Archwood. In exchange for his protection, she offers him information. But when her intuition leads her to the mysterious Hyhborn prince, will he be her happiness or her downfall?\n\nThis was probably JLA's most sexiest book to date (compared to the other series I've read) and it was so well done. Trust me, if you're looking for a fantasy with minimal romance or smut, you won't enjoy it much. On the other hand, if you want a sensual fantasy which is easy to read, this is it.\n\nIs it like FBAA?\n\nI see a lot of people comparing it to FBAA and calling this book unoriginal. Imo although there are certain elements which can be considered similar but only if you really look for it. I personally, thought this was better written than FBAA. The characters are different, their personalities are different, the abilities are different. People looking to hate on JLA's work will continue to do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nI have been quite critical of her writing in the past but this book had me mesmerized. I loved how powerfully developed her words have gotten. I could not keep this book down at all!!\n\nI loved the characters, Thorne and Calista. They have such good chemistry. Each and every moment that they were together was laced with intimacy, sensuality and I just could not get enough. Thorne is quite charming and radiates power in each and every calculated move of his. I liked how open and straightforward he was with Calista. I cannot wait to know the extent of his powers. Also, did I mention how undeniably sexy he is üëÄ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• Calista, surely is something more than a simple intuitive spy. To see her become the badass she's meant to be, is going to be sweetü§å I liked she was ready to be vulnerable with Thorne and her fiesty nature suited her quite well. Am eager to find out about her past.\n\nRegarding the supporting characters, I liked Bastian, he gives me Cassian (acotar) vibes. I liked his humour a lot. Also intrigued by the Baron, he's definitely a complex character.\n\nThe world building could have used some work, it definitely was overshadowed by the romance. In fact, the plot is overshadowed by the romance but I don't mind it much as it was marketed as a spicy romantasy and that is exactly what I got. Like I mentioned earlier, it's definitely flawed but I loved it regardless. It was exactly what I needed.\n\nThe cliffhanger makes me REALLY look forward to the next book ü§≠\n\n~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~\n\nAmazon might have cancelled my order but this won't stop me from reading it, I have waited painfully long enough. *whispers to ebook* You better be worth it üî™üò§\n\n~‚Ä¢~‚Ä¢~\n\nLooking forward to reading this after my current read. I just know its gonna be AMAZINGG. Got high hopes\n\nOctober 8, 2023\n\n‚úÖ ‚ÄúWho did this to you?‚Äù\n\n‚úÖ ‚ÄúI need to help you shower because you‚Äôre too weak‚Äù\n\n‚úÖ Smut\n\n‚úÖ First 40% and last 15%\n\n‚úÖ(üÜó) Characters\n\n‚úÖ(üÜó) Relationship between Lis and Thorne\n\n‚úÖ(üÜó) Plot\n\n‚úÖüÜó World-building (confusing at times, small info dump)\n\n‚úÖüÜó Pace\n\n‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èCliffhanger\n\nOveruse‚Ä¶ of‚Ä¶ ellipses\n\nSo‚Ä¶ many‚Ä¶ ellipses\n\nLis has an unfailing intuition that guides her decisions and that helped her and her best friend find a place to live in Baron Claude's household a few years ago. Now, Lis works for Claude. Disguised as a courtesan, she uses her abilities to feel people's intentions and even hear their thoughts at times, and she reports to Claude what she discovers. When her intuition leads her to save a Hyborn noble in the middle of the night, Lis is shocked to recognize \"her\" Hyborn, the one who helped her when she was a young orphan so many years ago. Lis feels an unexplainable attraction to him, but she knows that any association with a Hyborn will only lead to trouble for her, especially if he discovers her abilities. With the Hyborn requesting her as his companion, the hints of rebellion in the air, and the monsters attacking the Baron's estate, Lis must rely on her gifts now more than ever, but it might not be enough to save her and those she loves.\n\nI really enjoyed the first 40% or so of the book, but after that, the middle part dragged on a little. The conversations felt repetitive, and nothing really relevant happened until the last 15%. All things considered, not much happened in this book, even though it is over 400 pages long. It feels more like a very long prequel for the real action and politics that will (hopefully) be in the next book.\n\nThe world building and layout are a little confusing initially, even with the map, but I imagine we will get used to the terms, as we did in FBAA. Still, here is a recap of the different groups mentioned:\n\n- Lowborn: good old regular humans.\n\n- Hyhborn: higher class of the population, kind of like nobility I imagine.\n\n- Deminyens: Top class of Hyhborn, they are ageless and have elemental and/or mind powers.\n\n- Caelestia: mortal descended from the joining of a lowborn and a Hyhborn\n\n- Rae: Lowborn who has had his soul seized by a Hyhborn, it‚Äôs like a kind of human puppet I think‚Ä¶\n\n- King Euros rules over the kingdom of Caelum, and some princes and princesses rule over the 6 territories within Caelum.\n\nLis has special powers, such as being able to sometimes hear people's thoughts or catch glimpses of the future. She also has a very strong intuition, and she learned to listen to it. Lis is interesting I guess, but I struggled to connect with her. Also, for someone with such a strong intuition, and someone who is fairly intelligent, she was pretty clueless at times‚Ä¶\n\nMany little things about her annoyed me, but one of them was that she would put up fights sometimes for seemingly no reason besides being difficult. She accepts the fact that Claude often uses her as a means to get information, and sends her to other aristos as a ‚Äúcourtesan‚Äù even if that‚Äôs not her real purpose, yet she is super insulted when Thorne asks Claude to ‚Äúlend her to him‚Äù for the duration of his stay, because he didn‚Äôt ask her directly, and she had no say in Claude‚Äôs answer... But how is that any different than all the times Claude sent her to glean information while pretending to be a courtesan?\n\nLis also gives the impression that she is a fighter at first, but she ended up being quite helpless, and even though she complained a lot about it, in the end, she just did what everyone around her told her to do, which is even more frustrating considering that she is quite clever. Add to that the repetitive bland banter between Thorne and her, and her unending inner monologues, and it made for a character that could have been very interesting but ended up being just ordinary.\n\nThorne is nothing special really. He reminded me of Casteel and Nyktos at times, but not nearly as interesting or fleshed out. Also, the whole Na‚Äôlaa nickname was cute, but at the same time, I felt that it was just too similar to the Liessa title in ASITE. It‚Äôs as if the author took the same ideas and even very similar dialogues, but she switched Liessa for Na‚Äôlaa and that was it.\n\nThe dynamic between Thorne and Lis was not the best either. Sure, there is a lot of sexual tension between them, but I didn‚Äôt feel any real chemistry. We know that they are strangely attracted to each other, but we know it because they said it, not because we felt it. There is smut, of course, but to the point where it overshadowed the plot at times, and it also felt as if some situations happened just to create an opening for more smutty moments between Thorne and Lis.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed by that book. After reading the sneak peak available on Amazon I was super hyped, but it ended up being long and repetitive for most of the book, and the plot is secondary to the smut and relationship development between Lis and Thorne (if you can call the bland banter they share and need to get naked together a relationship). I might give the second book a try, because I do believe that there is potential in this series, and I am curious to see where this is going, but I am not sure yet. I guess I will see how I feel about it when the second book comes out.\n\nFollow me on Instagram üôÇ\n\nSeptember 17, 2023\n\nSo in short this is basically the scraps and off-cuts that didn‚Äôt make it into FBAA and there you have it, a brand new book!\n\nBut what about the plot you ask? Have no fear, fill it with smut, no need for plot! We‚Äôre onto a winner‚Ä¶\n\nNow to answer the burning questions.\n\nWas she STABBY?\n\nWell, not yet. But don‚Äôt you worry, we‚Äôre only in book one and we had to mix it up a little so book two sets up the promise of lots of that gloriously, violent, stabby, murderous creature shit.\n\nWas she freckled?\n\nThankfully we are spared from the love interest counting those freckles - had to mix up the FMC a little too, ya know? She is a different person after all.\n\nWas she a Queen?\n\nIt‚Äôs too soon for that to be revealed in book one, but again, the promise of Lis being a queen is smacking you in the face so not to worry.\n\nDoes she talk like EVERY other JLA main character as of late?\n\nYou better believe it. In fact, she‚Äôs outdone herself.\n\nEllipsis\n\nFor some reason I had deluded myself into thinking it wasn't that bad but the joke is on me. I've included for reference the other series ellipsis count below and JLA has, in fact, surpassed her previous works. *Praise*\n\nASITE - 722\n\nFBAA - 645\n\nKOFAF - 618\n\nCOGB - 677\n\nFORAW - 760 *Winner!\n\n** Summary **\n\nI‚Äôll admit I didn‚Äôt go into this with high hopes, but still. I actually did enjoy the first two books of the Blood and Ash series until it was obviously turned into an outrageously stupid cash grab (among many other various faults that could no longer be ignored). I don‚Äôt even have the energy to go into the specifics of this book, because that would involve going through the book again, and good lord, I have already punished myself enough.\n\nSimply put Lis is a bland, watered down version of Poppy (surprise), the plot is recycled and stale (there‚Äôs only so many times you can do the same thing, okay), and finally the romance is sub-zero. Thorne never really stood a chance. It‚Äôs the same repetitive ‚Äúbanter‚Äù that makes you want to roll your eyes - she says no, he says yes, she relents after putting up some half-hearted fight. Ughhh I‚Äôm rolling my eyes right now as I write this. Send help.\n\nBeing the sucker that I am I could have forgiven alot, even those god damn ellipses had there at least been an inkling of tension and chemistry, but alas, for me that was not the case.\n\n** End **\n\nA book shouldn‚Äôt be classed as 'adult‚Äô purely because it has a high level of smut. What you‚Äôre looking for is erotica, ma‚Äôam. (And it still ain‚Äôt good).\n\n*** Pre-release***\n\nBut will it just be another stabby, freckled snowflake *ahem* I mean, Queen, who ‚Ä¶ who talks ‚Ä¶ like this ‚Ä¶ all.the.time.\n\nWe shall see.\n\n*** Why the Waterstones edition gotta be so damn pretttyyyyy ***\n\nSeptember 25, 2023\n\nThis will probably be an unpopular review, but it is what it is.\n\nI like JLA books, I really do! I love Blood and Ash and Flesh and Fire, and I was actually convinced she was improving a lot as a writer.\n\nI did think an editor would improve her work, thus my excitement to see her new book being published by TOR.\n\nSuch . . . a . . . disappointment!\n\nSo . . . about . . . this . . . book:\n\n- You take Blood and Ash and mix it up with Flesh and Fire.\n\n- You search for synonyms of intriguing and opt for interesting and enthralling\n\n- Liessa is used already . . . You decide to change it for na‚Äôlaa\n\n- you eliminate all traces of a plot\n\n- You remove gradual world building and add it all up as info dump at 70% (you all know what usually happens at this point of the story).\n\n- To increase the length of the book, you use ellipsis every chance you get! Don‚Äôt forget to add a space between every dot, this will ensure you barely need to write a story.\n\n- Procede to add bits of plot in the last 15% of the book, in between some intense action scenes, so you can prepare a cliffhanger to hook readers for a second book.\n\n- To make it TikTok worth it, you add smut every chance you get. If everything goes right, nobody will notice they are reading recycled material without any story behind.\n\nThe characters:\n\n- Lis is special, obviously, but she is no maiden! She is some rich lord paramour, and sometimes even works as a courtesan. She is abused ALL THE TIME, but apparently, she only complains when is the MMC, and she actually wants it. As the story goes on, she slowly converts into Poppy, finds herself a dagger and stars throwing things to MMC. More powers appear and I expect she will be a Queen at the end of the series.\n\n- Cas and Niktos had a son, but he is horny and feeds on desire. Said horniness will avoid the necessity of creating a personality for Thorne, maybe on the second book. He senses (and sees) the FMC being abused, but he is very hungry, so he let's everything happen, and patiently waits for his turn.\n\nUnfortunately, I don‚Äôt believe I will continue with this series.\n\nOctober 4, 2023\n\nMid asf. It was fun while it lasted tho.\n\nThe first 40% was rlly good, I would get giddy every time the mcs would interact but as we went along the middle got boring and the stubborn fmc act was TIRED. It was so repetitive, they had the same conversation just in different settings where she was being difficult just to be difficult ugh it pissed me offfff. I skimmed the last 25% bc I just wanted it to end.\n\nAnd the writing was so inconsistent. I usually don‚Äôt pay that much attention to how a fantasy book is written but in this I couldn‚Äôt get past how it was formal one second and then would switch up so quick. It was weird.\n\nIf I never see an ellipses again it would be too soon. Idk why but this ONE thing got my eye twichinggggh every time JLA used it in the dialogue.\n\nHim calling her ‚ÄúNa‚Äôlaa‚Äù was the best part of this book ü§≠\n\nI loved the part where she taught him a lesson on manners too üíÖüíÖ\n\nThe ending was so predictable it got me rolling my eyes to the point of pain.\n\nIdk if I‚Äôll read the rest of the series bc I couldn‚Äôt care less abt the plotüíÄ\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\nnot even traditional publishing can stop JLA from abusing ellipses\n\nAugust 5, 2024\n\nWhat a weird paced book. It also didn‚Äôt seem to be sure whether it wanted to be fantasy, romance or romantasy lol. Pick one or do them all justice.\n\nI was very underwhelmed by this read - bored out of my mind actually.\n\nAnd I cringed at a lot of dialogues. I even suffered from second hand embarrassment a few times.\n\nI skimmed starting at 50% because it was either that or DNF.\n\nI‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm such a hate reader lately. This slump is just the worst I‚Äôve ever had\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Ä¢\n\nI haven‚Äôt been enjoying my reads for about a month now. So I hope this breaks my curse ü•∫\n\nHappy Tuesday everyone üíó\n\nOctober 8, 2023\n\n3.85!\n\nThe thing with this book was as an epic fantasy there wasn't much fantasy in it. I just don't understand the point of adding so much smut in fantasy that it overshadows the plot like this book was filled with smut and the plot got overshadowed real quick.\n\nThe plot, it that wasn't bad but it wasn't that good either. It has great potential, all it needed was a little bit of focus. I saw the story taking so much turns that it could've which it did not, save to say the last 100 pages were redeemable of this book, predictable nonetheless.\n\nThe two main characters:\n\nCalista our FMC was a somewhat clever character I liked her development and the choices that she made, her morality as well. I just felt like she let herself be used ALOT like girll stand up for yourself.\n\nOur MMC lord throne was ü´£ü•µ he was just üòè‚òÑÔ∏è but still I need a better character arc for him there is still so much left to unravel for his characters which I think would be in the following books. The plot twist regarding him that came at the end I have to say I did predict but felt nice to read.\n\nThe romance, I'm a sucker for slow burn because I feel like if the romance isn't slow burn it makes it very unrealistic for ME but this one was hot and heartwarming at times but also too much at times. It definitely needs a little bit working on but it can be very fruitful at the end.\n\nThe world building I have to say was impressive, I wasn't expecting to to be that immersive. The good thing about it was that it was complex but not too complex like there was this perfect amount of complexity that the author achieved.\n\nThe writing style was the decent part about this also a major reason why I would continue the series and read other works by this author because the writing style was addicting 'not Rina Kent addicting' but rather 'good addicting'.\n\nI will be looking forward to the next book!\n\n~~~~~~\n\nThe good thing about this book is that it came out on my birthday! So my sister got me a copy of this as a birthday gift üòå hopefully it'll live upto the expectations.\n\nI read the sneak peek and oh my god I CANT WAIT 12th September!\n\n~~~~~\n\nThis will be my first jla book because\n\n1. I'm conflicted on whether I should read fbaa or not\n\n2. Lux series intimidates me\n\n3. I plan on reading her storm and fury trilogy after I complete one of the series that been in my tbr\n\nAnother reason to read it:\n\nIt's coming out on my birthday!\n\nThis is just one book so I will give this a go and see how good of an author she is...\n\nJuly 18, 2024\n\nObviously a very enjoyable read. JLA will always be an automatic buy for me; she certainly knows how to deliver romantasy.\n\nBut I was a little disappointed with this one. It's very similar to FBAA, which in itself is fine, but I found myself constantly comparing the two, and this one was lacking.\n\nI don't think the relationship between Calista and Thorne was very developed. They're interesting characters and I think they work well together, but there wasn't enough time to really grow attached to their relationship, if you can even call it that yet.\n\nAnd the storyline, though interesting, isn't really vibing yet. I just remember FBAA was explosive in all ways, and because this storyline is so similar, it left me disappointed in a couple areas.\n\nAnd I feel like she took the Thorne's missing heart storyline directly from Nyktos' storyline. It's essentially the same thing...\n\nBUT I like where this is going and I think this may have been a good intro, which will allow the second book to hit the ground running.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nDecember 22, 2023\n\n‚ÄúNa‚Äôlaa. You should‚Äôve known better than to run. I will always catch you.‚Äù\n\nThis book was so good! This was a spicy and exciting romantic fantasy about love, power, sacrifice, and finding yourself. Fall of Ruin and Wrath follows Calista, a mortal who can see the future and has a strong intuition where she lives hidden at the Baron of Archwood's Palace. Calista follows her intuition and saves a traveling Hyborn Prince. As they become closer will Calista's intuition save her or destroy her?\n\nI was swept up into this romantic fantasy from the first page. The pacing was great in the beginning and ending although it was slow in the middle. The plot was interesting although the romance was more of a focus than the plot. The writing was descriptive and easy to follow, but it didn't blow me away. The world building was unique, but it was confusing at times and I do think it was lacking. I liked the idea of the Hyhborn, (the immortals made from the earth who are very powerful) and the Lowborn (the mortals who are born) and the differences between them. the I loved Lista, she is stubborn, kind, brave, resilient, and compassionate. I can relate to Lista, similar to her I care a great deal about the people close to me and I'm also brave. Lista's character development was great, I enjoyed seeing her become more confident in herself and learn who she is. I also love Throne, he is forward, honest, charming, strong, very handsome and powerful. I loved that Throne was honest to Lista and how protective he is of her. I enjoyed seeing Thorne's vulnerable side and learning more about his past. I really liked Bas and Grady, they are both funny and charming. The chemistry and tension between Lista and Thorne was amazing! The spice was off the charts and I was swooning and blushing at several of the scenes. I also enjoyed the banter between the main characters. The ending was so exciting and the cliffhanger makes me excited for the next book!\n\nOverall, I recommend this book if you love romantic fantasy, great characters and excellent chemistry between the main characters.\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\nI try not to make negative reviews because I believe that just because I don‚Äôt like a book doesn‚Äôt mean somebody else won‚Äôt. However, I‚Äôve noticed JLA books getting progressively worse every time I read. I think the last time I enjoyed one of her novels was From Blood and Ash before even that series went downhill. In my opinion, JLA has never been the strongest writer but it seems like lately her books are getting trashier and starting to become less plot and more smut (which is fine if that‚Äôs your vibe, but it‚Äôs just something that disappointed me). I‚Äôm not a super prudish reader, but when the stories stop telling a story, I start to get annoyed and underwhelmed.\n\nWhich brings me to this book. I wasn‚Äôt excited to read to begin with because I think my time with JLA books has expired, but it was even worse than I was expecting. As of this review, I haven‚Äôt yet finished the full book (I‚Äôm just about at the 50% mark) and I‚Äôm thinking about not finishing. There‚Äôs very little story here (literally could not tell you what‚Äôs going on). It‚Äôs literally only sex. With everyone. Characters aren‚Äôt very captivating either. A pattern I‚Äôve noticed with JLA is that she tends to recycle characters over and over. Kat, Damon, Poppy, Casteel, Luc, Evie are all examples of characters that read the exact same with similar, if not the same, dynamics every time. You could literally swap them for each book and not know the different. I‚Äôm finding the same with the main characters of this novel as well, but they‚Äôre even more boring and plain and generic. I felt no connection to them at all.\n\nI just don‚Äôt really know the story the author is trying to tell? In my opinion, there is no story here. There‚Äôs words on the page, there‚Äôs characters, there‚Äôs (kind of) external things happening, but there is no story. And even if there was, JLA does such a disservice by stealing the attention of what could be a story by throwing sex scene after sex scene after sex scene to distract her readers from truly experiencing any kind of story (especially because there‚Äôs very little emotion or reason in each sex scene - it‚Äôs just random, out of the blue most times, for no apparent reason at all and very little connection or thought.)\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a variety of readers who are into this kind of thing, but unfortunately it fell so far beneath my expectations and I think marks the final end for me as a JLA reader.\n\nRead\n\nOctober 4, 2023\n\nDNF - I don‚Äôt even know how I feel about half the books any more. Lots of rereads & unhauls forth coming. I just don‚Äôt know. And the cover is beautiful. Sigh ‚Ä¶\n\nMel üñ§üê∂üê∫üêæüòï\n\nNovember 28, 2023\n\nIt‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve gone into a new fantasy romance series and loved it ‚Äì like instantly fell in love with it, without having to get used to the world building. FORAW was an instant hit for me and an easy 5 stars.\n\nI loved the characters and I loved the romance. I loved the potential of how the romance will be in the sequel, and I thought the world was SO interesting. It‚Äôs about a girl named Lis who has the power of intuition and she uses this to her advantage, as a sort of fortuneteller for a Baron, in exchange for his protection. She comes across the hero in her town when he‚Äôs on the verge of dying, and she saves his life. This happens early on in the book, and what a way it was to get me hooked onto the story.\n\nLis has no idea that Thorne is actually a prince ‚Äì and one of the most powerful beings in the kingdom. He shows up at the Baron's estate where Lis is living because he‚Äôs very... intrigued by her. Thorne is such a fascinating character, and I love the dynamic between him and Lis. He‚Äôs powerful and possessive and very morally gray. He loves to push Lis‚Äôs buttons, and the banter + heat + tension between is so well done. FORAW is definitely one of JLA‚Äôs more steamy books ‚Äì like, steamy for JLA lol. There‚Äôs a bit of primal play going on here?? Like, yes please.\n\nI just had a ton of fun reading this. It was so easy to get into, and I cannot wait to read the sequel when it comes out!\n\nSeptember 7, 2023\n\nHOLY SHIT THAT WAS SO GOOD\n\nOctober 25, 2023\n\nFall of Ruin and Wrath was a dark and sensual romtansy that was so easy to get lost in. Within those first few pages I had no clue what was going on, but I was terrified. So take those first few chapters to immerse yourself in this new world. It's lethal, archaic and shrouded in mystery. With a dystopian background, that was laced with high fantasy, Fall of Ruin and Wrath easily became an instant favorite!\n\n‚ÄúWe keep meeting under the strangest circumstances,‚Äù he noted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm beginning to think fate is afoot.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúFate?‚Äù I laughed. ‚ÄúYou believe in fate?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt?‚Äù\n\nCalista aka Lis was a paramour to Claude who was a Caelestia; half Hyhborn and half lowborn. And while I've read almost every single book by JLA, over the last decade, Lis was unlike any other heroine that we have met from Armentrout. Her intuition guided where she went in life and the decisions she made. She also had the ability to see things happen before they did. Like how someone would die, or horrific events on the horizon. And I was fascinated to watch her listen into others thoughts, without needing to touch them. Yet my heart twisted for Lis. I questioned whether she truly knew how to have a strong mental bond with others. She seemed to struggle with that outside of her \"brother\", Grady. Maybe it was because of her gifts? Or maybe it was because of her childhood? Or maybe it even had to do with how she ended up as a paramour and nothing truly felt like hers? But regardless, she seemed to have connections with those around her physically, instead of emotionally.\n\n‚ÄúHold still.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI am holding still, but . . . you‚Äôre on your knees, your fingers are near my dick, and you‚Äôre currently gloriously nude, so . . .‚Äù\n\nUndoing the final button, I rolled my eyes. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even stand on your own two feet and you‚Äôre currently regrowing eyeballs. The last thing you need to be thinking about is me on my knees, your dick, or my nudity.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve regrown my eyes, na‚Äôlaa.‚Äù\n\nMy chin jerked up.\n\nLis' intuition one night led her to rescue a Hyhborn. Hyhborn's weren't mortal, they were scions of the Gods. And the scene she was led to was terrifying, yet I couldn't help but noticing that I loved her thoughts. They were real and honest, making it so easy to connect with her. And the Hyhborn we met?! I. Was. Obsessed! Thorne was a book boyfriend many will fall hard for. I loved that he could be sarcastic and also oh so polite. His manners as he murdered those to keep Lis safe had me cracking up. Thorne was truly lethal, yet at the same time he was so much fun. He loved to push Lis' buttons and get a rise out of her while being addictively possessive. Add to all of that that he was capable of admitting when he was wrong. Well. It was impossible not to love everything there was about him.\n\n‚ÄúNa‚Äôlaa?‚Äù\n\nI stopped as something . . . something like hope swelled inside me. Hope for what? I really couldn‚Äôt say as I looked over my shoulder at him.\n\nThe Lord stood with his back to me, shoulders a tense straight line. ‚ÄúBe careful.‚Äù\n\nAround Thorne, Lis could touch him and just be in the moment. She never got pulled into her brain or saw future events she would prefer not to see. Like she did when she touched other lowborns and Caelestias. So the sexual tension between Lis and Thorne was done fabulously. It was a slow burn that was filled with the most fabulous banter. It was impossible not to smile at so many of the moments between them. And while Thorne and Lis were worlds apart, it always felt like there was something pulling them together. As though there was a higher power connecting them. So because of that, I loved watching the tentative trust build. That they could be comfortable with each other. That it felt like Lis was finally making an emotional connection with someone. And of course how steamy they could be together too *fans face*.\n\nI connected with him, and my intuition came alive, showing me the future‚Äî the excruciating crack of bone in my right arm, then my left. The phantom pain traveled to my throat. I felt it all.\n\nHis death.\n\nAnd I . . . I smiled.\n\nYes there were other characters outside of Lis and Thorne, but I am rather obsessed with those two. I'm still unsure of how to feel towards Naomi, who was her first friend outside of Grady. And I would love if Lis threw an apple at Claude's head, like Alex. Yes he took care of Lis as he used her as his own personal lie detector, but I loathed that he called her Pet. There was also a man named Hymel that I kept hoping would die on every page he appeared lol. Ohhh then there were two friends of Thorne that we didn't spend a lot of time with, yet I adored both of them. I can't wait to get to know them better! They had found family written all over them! But on top of those we met, there was a whole world and political intrigue that I'm not even touching on. It was fascinating and better left for you to discover on your own!\n\n‚ÄúDon‚Äôt.‚Äù\n\nMy gaze flew back to him.\n\n‚ÄúI would warn against attempting to run,‚Äù he advised, walking past me.\n\n‚ÄúBecause you will stop me?‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúBecause I will give chase.‚Äù He unhooked the straps holding the short sword to his back as he crossed into the bedchamber. ‚ÄúAnd I will capture you.‚Äù\n\nFall of Ruin and Wrath was laced with a fascinating world, characters that will steal you heart, mysteries that are intertwined with secrets, and moments that will leave you on the edge of your seat! There were so many moments that were impossible to stop smiling or screaming from excitement. Especially when it came to Thorne. That last page was the most perfect stopping point. Yet I am definitely counting down until the next book is released and we can be back in this world!\n\nPS The shower scene was one of my favorite moments. Nope, it's not what you think it is *side smirk*.\n\nOther Favorite Quotes:\n\nMy senses opened to him. I saw nothing in his eyes or in my mind.\n\nBut I felt something.\n\nA warning.\n\nA reckoning.\n\nA promise of what was to come.\n\nAnd I knew.\n\n‚ÄúApologies, my pet. I do get a bit animated when I speak. Got it from my mother.‚Äù\n\n‚Äú‚Äò Pet‚Äô?‚Äù Prince Thorne queried softly.\n\nThe back of my neck tingled, and it had nothing to do with intuition.\n\nI froze. Tiny hairs lifted along the nape of my neck as the air thickened and the flames stilled. That mouth of mine had surely gotten me in trouble this time.\n\nBut Prince Thorne . . . he smiled.\n\nMy stomach dipped.\n\nThe smile he bestowed was not tight or cold. It was wide and real, showing a hint of teeth and softening the icy, unreal beauty of his features.\n\n‚ÄúDo you finally think of me as a monster?‚Äù\n\nI closed my eyes.\n\n‚ÄúYou should,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúThe blood that is on my hands will never wash off. I wouldn‚Äôt even attempt to do so.‚Äù\n\n*I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book, provided by the author.

I was engaged for the full book. I couldn't put it down, and stayed up 'til 3AM reading it. I absolutely will be reading book two, despite my better judgement, as I will be devastated if I let JLA trick me into yet another 5-6 book series that should be 3 books.\n\nIt's formulaic, in a way that nothing is a surprise, but that's not necessarily a criticism. I'm reading this for a good time, a distraction; the book equivalent of a shitty tv show you can't look away from and end up thoroughly obsessed with.\n\nIt did still need editing, despite me noticing an improvement overall, because I was truly losing my mind at the amount of ellipsis and it kept taking me out of the story. It was done at first to show the love interest was injured and struggling for breath, ok, but when this continues over SEVERAL PAGES it becomes tedious. If I'd known what was good for me I'd have DNF'd then. The ellipsis continues throughout the book, and JLA also chooses to repeat the same word before and after the '...'. JLA has been critiqued extensively for her repetitive 'I have a question' with Poppy, rather than just asking the fucking question, and this had the same rage inducing effect that I would have preferred be omitted. I feel there are other ways to show a character is second guessing herself, no? At least include a little variety for the sake of my sanity.\n\nI also just desperately despise ANY romantasy book that includes the FMC having to explain ongoing consent to the love interest. Can ‚Ä¶ can we ‚Ä¶ not?\n\nFor this I truly can't give it higher than 2 stars (probably 2.5 purely for it's addictiveness), despite me wanting to read book 2 (yes, I do hate myself why do you ask)\n\n:)\n\nSeptember 10, 2023\n\nFall of Ruin and Wrath is not what I expected. The plot felt non-existent, honestly. It was definitely character and smut driven. I‚Äôd say the romance was the focal point but it didn‚Äôt feel like a romance to me. The characters were drawn to each other, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if deeper feelings developed between them.\n\nI was confused about the world for a good portion of the book. A lot of information is dumped on you in the beginning and it took a while for me to process that information and apply it to what was happening on the page. If I‚Äôm being honest, I still don‚Äôt fully understand the world and what it‚Äôs supposed to look like. It felt like a typical fantasy world where it‚Äôs set back in older times, meaning there‚Äôs no technology and things like that, but there was a Great War that happened centuries ago that changed the landscape and how everyone lived.\n\nWhile this book wasn‚Äôt for me, I will be checking out the sequel out of curiosity to see what happens next. If you‚Äôre a fan of romantasy and the books that are trending on booktok, then there‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôll enjoy this book!\n\nRating is probably between 2.75 - 3 stars.\n\nJune 30, 2024\n\nwhat a stupid waste of time!\n\nliterally nothing happened in this book, it‚Äôs 400 pages of just people talking and doing random shit, also obvious scenes there just for smut. the main characters name isn‚Äôt said until 150 pages in and the love interest is introduced for the first time around then too. apparently this book has an editor but that‚Äôs just not believable sorry.\n\nNovember 18, 2023\n\n‚ÄúNa‚Äôlaa,‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve known better than to run. I will always catch you.‚Äù ü•µ\n\nFirstly, nicknames will get me Every. Single. Fucking.Time.\n\nThis wasn‚Äôt great but it wasn‚Äôt terrible. The FBAA similarities are clearly visible.\n\nJennifer knows she can write a dark morally gray MMC that we are drooling in the mouths over ü§™ü§§\n\nThings I didn‚Äôt like:\n\n1. The writing seemed juvenile and simple.\n\n2. The relationship between the FMC and MMC seemed awkward and cringey in the first half of the book. Also, we didn‚Äôt see a relationship develop between them but they constantly bumped into each other.\n\n3. The political system and fantasy aspect of the story wasn‚Äôt super intriguing imo and I found myself more interested in the romance.\n\n4. The book didn‚Äôt get interesting until about 70 percent where I couldn‚Äôt put it down.\n\nIt‚Äôs the beginning of the series and I think it does have hope. Many things can be clarified in the next book and the cliffhanger left me breathless..I kept scrolling the pages like I know this ain‚Äôt finished ü§£ü§£üò´\n\n3.5‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nSeptember 16, 2023\n\nStar rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ\n\nSpice rating: üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è\n\nI am so disappointed in this book‚Ä¶ not gunna lie. I feel like the first 50% NOTHING happens. I honestly almost gave up but decided to push forward. It did start getting decent the second half, but every aspect of this book was severely lacking.\n\nWorld Building/Fantasy Aspects: was basically nonexistent. There was very little world building for a book that was supposed to be a high fantasy. While what was provided was a little silly (brown eyes means you are normal & colorful eyes mean you got powers‚Ä¶ I mean come on girlüôÉ you got better imagination than that). There was a few info dumps decently spaced throughout the book‚Ä¶ however‚Ä¶ I walked away mostly confused on how the information provided connected to what was being discussed or just plain confused.\n\nRomance: hmmmmmmm‚Ä¶. So. The romance was ‚Äúprevalent‚Äù throughout the entire book. However, it went no deeper than sexual attraction. Sorry not sorry to disappoint people but these characters had no connection (in my option) past the smut. The smut literally overruled EVERYTHING (character development, romantic cuteness, plot, etc).\n\nCharacters: Not super likeable, and sorta two-dimensional. Lis‚Äôs whole thing is being able to see the future and have this intuition; however, homie STILL BE DUMB AS SHIT. Like it‚Äôs right in front of your goddamn face PLEASE!!! Thorne I had a like/hate relationship with. There were a lot of times I didn‚Äôt really like him or his actions/reactions with Lis, and other times I started to like him. I couldn‚Äôt get my feelings figured out with him tbh. I did however LOVE Bas from the first second I saw him üëÄ can she end up with him instead please??\n\nThat being said‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think I will be continuing this series and I just don‚Äôt think JLA is the author for me anymore. I prefer quality over quantity üòóü´£üëÄ\n\nAugust 25, 2023\n\n4.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nThe beginning was a little bit slow. I was unsure of whether or not I would actually enjoy this BUT then it started picking up. I think I was just a bit lost when it came to the world building and that is where I found it slower but once I understood it, I really started to enjoy it a lot.\n\nThis book is extremely interesting. JLA knows how to write fantasy that‚Äôs for sure. All these links from the beginning and the end are incredible. We learn a lot about the world and how it works and I find it so incredibly interesting. It‚Äôs also different to other books and very unique.\n\nI love the concept of the hyhborn and how they are created and everything. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve read many other books with this kind of concept so it was really fun. The ending was crazy as well. You start to piece everything together and it‚Äôs like one realization after another which is super exciting. The ending was truly INCREDIBLE. It makes me so excited to continue on with this series and see where everything goes. I have so many questions and wish I could pick up the next book. I think this book definitely takes a bit of time to get into but once you do it gets really good. I also think the next books in the series will be much much better now that the scene and introductions have been done. Highly recommend!\n\nSeptember 15, 2023\n\neven writing fun trashy romantasy requires a certain skill that jla does not possess. after two previous dnfs, i decided to give this a try (and i was kinda in the mood to hate read). i did not get fired up, i was plain ol bored. releasing this after a successful project has to be the biggest downgrade and i haven't even read fbaa and its spin-off. they have to have more substance than #this. poor orphan girl who is different and turns out to be special at the very end, semi evil guy justifying coercion and power imbalance by the lack of a heart, learning compassion for the first time... banging my head against the wall\n\nRead\n\nNovember 23, 2023\n\nDNF\n\nThere‚Äôs only so much talk of magical cum one girl can take.\n\nOctober 5, 2023\n\nOctober 2023 - First Read Through\n\nI ADORED this book! BUT. I couldn't help but notice how murder-happy the author seems to have become in her latest series. Can we go ONE book without someone dying? It truly feels like all the author's previous books were a warm-up for her to hone her craft and start writing romantic fantasy (high on the romance, low on the fantasy). This is exactly how I like my fantasy with A LOT of romance in it.\n\nI loved Thorn from the beginning but the author did her best to tear that down and make me rethink my very emotional and definitive decision. I just wanted in that head of his so I could unveil all his dirty little secrets and half-truths! The ending was not great considering the cliffhanger. I'll live but come on! Would it hurt to finish a book without a cliffhanger for once Mrs. Armentrout?!\n\nThe heroine was strong but strangely naive at the most inopportune moments. She was an orphan and had to live on the streets. So it's safe to presume she knows a thing or two about a thing or two. By that logic some of the decisions she took just didn't line up with it all.\n\nRegardless of the faults this book has (most of which I didn't see because I was so enamored with Thorn) I will be anxiously awaiting the next book. Fingers crossed it gets released in the next 6 months and we don't have to wait a full year to know what happens next üò≠\n\nP.S. Thorn is currently ranking Top 3 in my Best Book Boyfriends EVER list. üòÖ\n\n________________\n\nDecember 2022 -\n\nAccording to the author: \"A FALL OF RUIN AND WRATH, an adult fantasy romance, is coming Fall 2023 from Tor Books.\"\n\nIf the teasers she's released in the past few months were for this book then I'm VERY confident I'm going to LOVE this. I lowkey hope this is in the same vein as the Blood And Ash books and by that I mean in a similar style of story and characters. Then again if this turns out to be another spin-off of the Blood And Ash books I'm also VERY down for it! Regardless of what this is or isn't I'm very excited for it and will devour it ‚ô°\n\nSeptember 18, 2023\n\nI can‚Äôt tell you one single thing I liked about this book\n\nAs always with JLA, the lore was confusing and annoying. The world in and of itself wasn‚Äôt super fleshed out neither were the characters. There was no real chemistry between Thorne and Lis. And the shock of the century was JLA using a trope that felt similar to Jacob imprinting on Renesmee in Breaking Dawn. Even Thorne as a supernatural being didn‚Äôt make sense. Idk why I thought he fed like a vampire but he literally fed off vibes?? He was basically a walking crystal. Idk man this was definitely JLA‚Äôs worse writing imo. And I know she can write amazing storylines , side characters and chemistry because Nyktos and Sera EXIST!!\n\nWhat‚Äôs crazy is now after reading this book I don‚Äôt even know what this book was about. That‚Äôs how boring it was. (Including the smut)"
