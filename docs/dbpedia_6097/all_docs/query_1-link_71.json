        "text": "The new film “Oddity” is aptly titled. The film opened in July in the US and started showing in August at Saudi cinemas.\n\nIt tells the story of Dani, the wife of a psychiatrist, who is brutally murdered in her home. Her twin sister Darcy goes after those responsible by using haunted items as her tools for revenge.\n\nWinner of the 2024 Audience Award in the Midnighter section of the South by Southwest Film and TV Festival, it is clear to see why it received such acclaim as it has love, loss and a little bit of magic.\n\nLittle Willie John’s soulful R&B hit “Now You Know,” from 1958, plays throughout the film, fusing the sad nostalgic vibes of the emotional lyrics to the uneasy viewing experience. Both the film and the song express heartache and betrayal.\n\nGwilym Lee, who played guitarist Brian May in the 2018 Queen biopic “Bohemian Rhapsody,” is great in his role as Dr. Ted Timmis. Carolyn Bracken is excellent as the dark-haired Dani, and her twin, Darcy.\n\nLush cinematography, courtesy of Colm Hogan, and the gorgeous Irish landscape provide the perfect backdrop to this eerie indoor narrative. Every frame feels like it could be a still photo — a true work of art.\n\nThe film was written and directed by Damian McCarthy.\n\nIt is in the paranormal horror genre, so expect the unexpected. Packages mysteriously arrive at the house and contain so much wonder within. But be warned: there is a lot of blood.\n\nThe film made me uncomfortable at times, but given the genre, that feeling provides the highest compliment to the filmmaker.\n\nDUBAI: Fans gave a warm welcome to Dubai-based Hollywood star Lindsay Lohan at Disney’s D23 fan convention at The Honda Center in Anaheim, California.\n\nOn Saturday, Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis, the stars of the upcoming “Freaky Friday” follow-up, revealed to fans for the first time the sequel’s official title, “Freakier Friday,” expected in cinemas in 2025.\n\nLohan, who wore a black and white Balmain ensemble to the event, took to Instagram to share her excitement. “What a wonderful time I had at @disneyd23 Thank you for the overwhelming response of love and excitement for FREAKIER FRIDAY,” was how she captioned her carousel images from the event.\n\nDirected by Nisha Ganatra and produced by Kristin Burr, Andrew Gunn and Curtis, “Freakier Friday” picks up years after Curtis and Lohan’s characters, Tess and Anna, first endured an identity crisis: Anna has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate challenges that come when two families merge, they discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Lohan also revealed that “Star Wars: Acolyte” star Manny Jacinto will play Lohan’s character’s husband in the film.\n\n“Manny is lovely. So funny,” Lohan said of her onscreen love interest.\n\nIt was also announced that original cast member Chad Michael Murray will be returning to play Jake in the sequel, fuelling fans’ excitement that they will get to see Lohan and Murray’s characters together 20 years after the original film.\n\nWhile it appears that they won’t be in a romantic relationship, Curtis teased, “Chad is in it. And boy, oh boy, is Chad in it.”\n\n“Freakier Friday” also stars Mark Harmon, Christina Vidal Mitchell, Haley Hudson, Lucille Soong, Stephen Tobolowsky and Rosalind Chao. New cast members include Julia Butters, Sophia Hammons and Maitreyi Ramakrishnan. Executive producers are Nathan Kelly, Ann Marie Sanderlin and Lohan.\n\nAside from Jacinto as Lohan’s onscreen husband, no further details have been released about the roles played by Butters, Hammons and Ramakrishnan — although it is likely at least one of them will be playing Lohan’s daughter and another one may take the part of her almost-stepdaughter.\n\nFans of Holly Jackson’s highly popular 2019 novel, “A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder,” can now experience the story visually with the new BBC TV adaptation, which premiered on Netflix this month.\n\nThe adaption was made by Poppy Cogan and directed by Dolly Wells. It was developed by Moonage Pictures for BBC Three and is available for streaming on Netflix.\n\nMuch like the book, we follow the story alongside 17-year-old Pippa Fitz-Amobi, portrayed by Emma Myers of “Wednesday” fame. Set in a small British town, Pippa’s journey uncovers deep secrets and buried realities.\n\nIn the story, Pippa is quiet and timid but also stubbornly refuses to believe what everyone else in town has come to accept, that five years prior, her slightly older school friend, Sal Singh, murdered his girlfriend Andie Bell and then killed himself.\n\nWith the looming EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) due date fast approaching —which is required for all seniors to complete for their university application — the studious “good girl” Pippa decides to take it as the perfect opportunity to investigate the case herself.\n\nThe truth, she finds out, is much more sinister than she could have ever imagined.\n\nThe series reminded me of the classic Nancy Drew books; both feature young, intelligent girls who are adamant at trying to diligently — and somewhat stealthily — solve mysteries. Their goal is to simply know the real story.\n\nThe idea of what it means to be a “good girl” is also explored in all its complexity and glory.\n\n“Just because she did this (bad) thing does not mean she’s not a good person,” Pippa says in one scene.\n\nLater on, in another episode, after she had uncovered some harrowing hidden truths, she declares: “There is no such thing as a good person.”\n\nThe season is made of six episodes, each of which lasts about 45 minutes. If the TV series is renewed, they have two more books to delve into.\n\nIf you’ve caught glimpses of actress Blake Lively smiling brightly as she wears dreamy, floral-inspired garments for the press tour of her latest film, “It Ends With Us,” you might be fooled into assuming that her character — a florist aptly named Lily Blossom Bloom — has a tranquil life that is just a walk in the park.\n\nLily certainly wakes up and smells the roses — even if they are found to be prickly, with bloody thorns.\n\nTrigger warning: the narrative explores themes related to domestic violence and childhood trauma. The author of the 2016 novel on which the film is based, Colleen Hoover, has said the story was inspired by her parents’ relationship.\n\nThe story is ripped straight from a heartbreaking headline that many women know all too well: You think that your life is finally going perfectly and you’ve found the right partner, only to find that nothing is what it seems. The hand that once held you tenderly is the one that hits you. The face that you once found comfort in becomes the one that is most terrifying to you.\n\nLike a fresh flower, your dreams can sometimes shrivel up and die.\n\nLily — named after a flower traditionally used at funerals —is perhaps Lively’s most emotionally raw character and one which fully shows her range as an actress. Over the course of the film she is funny, joyous, endearing, sad, confused, vulnerable, strong, scared and empowered.\n\nThe film is directed by Justin Baldoni (“Jane the Virgin”) who also stars as Lily’s husband, Dr. Ryle Kincaid. It also showcases the acting chops of comedians Jenny Slate and Hasan Minhaj, who play a happily married couple who help Lily along on her journey; as well as Brandon Sklenar, as Atlas — Lily’s first love who reappears in her life when she least expects it.\n\nIn what is perhaps the most emotional scene in the entire movie, you can hear the gothic, choir-inflected, layered vocals of Lively’s real-life friend Taylor Swift as she sings the 2020 sleeper hit, “My Tears Ricochet.” The haunting song made the unraveling scene seem much more dire.\n\nWhile the story’s climax does feel like it was hastily wrapped up in a neat bow, it’s also the ending most of us would hope for if we were in that situation.\n\n“It Ends With Us” is both love story and cautionary tale. It speaks of resistance, perseverance, and friendship.\n\nThe film starts and ends with Lily driving a car on an open road. But she is not the same, and, after watching the rollercoaster of a narrative unfold, neither is the viewer.\n\nDUBAI: Saudi Arabia film producer Mohammed Al-Turki, who previously served as the CEO of the Red Sea Film Foundation, is set to receive the Philanthropic Leadership Award at the upcoming amfAR gala event in Venice on Sept. 1.\n\nThe award will recognize Al-Turki for his contributions to the film industry and charitable work.\n\nThe American Foundation for AIDS Research supports researchers, prevention, education and advocacy. It has raised nearly $900 million since 1985.\n\n“Thanks in part to his leadership, @RedseaFilm Festival has been a generous supporter of amfAR’s work for many years and has helped advance our lifesaving research,” the organization said in a statement on Instagram.\n\nAl-Turki wrote on Instagram recently: “I feel very humbled and very appreciative, I believe so much in amfAR’s work and will do whatever I can until there is a cure for HIV and AIDS, which is apparent more than ever right now.”\n\n“Getting the Philanthropic Leadership Award is an honor that is surreal. I am honored to share this moment in Venice with my film and chosen family (and) a true icon the one and only Mr. Richard Gere who will receive amfAR’s Award of Inspiration,” Al-Turki added.\n\nThe 81st edition of the Venice Film Festival runs from Aug. 28 to Sept. 7.\n\nkeywords"
