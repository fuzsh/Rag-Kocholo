        "text": "CLEOPATRA\n\nMy desolation does begin to make A better life. ’Tis paltry to be Caesar. Not being Fortune, he’s but Fortune’s knave, A minister of her will. And it is great To do that thing that ends all other deeds, Which shackles accidents and bolts up change, Which sleeps and never palates more the dung, The beggar’s nurse, and Caesar’s.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nMy isolation has helped me better understand my life. It's no great thing to be Caesar. He doesn't control his own fate, he's controlled by fate, and does whatever fortune dictates. And it is great, to do that deed that puts an end to everything else, that puts a stop to all the accidents of fortune and to all change, that makes us sleep forever so that we never eat food from the earth again—food that nourishes beggars as well as great men like Caesar.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nAntony Did tell me of you, bade me trust you, but I do not greatly care to be deceived, That have no use for trusting. If your master Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him, That majesty, to keep decorum, must No less beg than a kingdom. If he please To give me conquered Egypt for my son, He gives me so much of mine own as I Will kneel to him with thanks.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nAntony told me about you and told me to trust you, but I am still hesitant to trust people, since I do not like being deceived. If your master wants me, a queen, to beg for favors from him, then you must tell him that a queen, if she is to act appropriately, cannot ask for anything less than a kingdom. If Caesar is willing to give Egypt back to me so I can make my son its ruler, then I will kneel down and thank him for giving me back what is rightfully mine.\n\nPROCULEIUS\n\nBe of good cheer. You’re fall’n into a princely hand. Fear nothing. Make your full reference freely to my lord, Who is so full of grace that it flows over On all that need. Let me report to him Your sweet dependency, and you shall find A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness Where he for grace is kneeled to.\n\nPROCULEIUS\n\nTake comfort. You've been conquered by a noble and generous man. Don't be afraid of anything. Make all your requests to my lord without hesitation. His generosity is so great that he will willingly meet your needs. Let me report back to him how humbly you acknowledge his power, and you'll find that this conquerer will beg you to tell him new ways to show kindness to you, once you've knelt down to ask him for mercy.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nSir, I will eat no meat, I’ll not drink, sir. If idle talk will once be necessary, I’ll not sleep neither. This mortal house I’ll ruin, Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I Will not wait pinioned at your master’s court, Nor once be chastised with the sober eye Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up And show me to the shouting varletry Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt Be gentle grave unto me. Rather on Nilus’ mud Lay me stark naked and let the waterflies Blow me into abhorring. Rather make My country’s high pyramides my gibbet And hang me up in chains!\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nSir, I will eat no food and I will not drink, sir. Even if it takes idle chatter to keep me awake, I won't sleep either. I'll destroy my own body, no matter what Caesar tries to do. You should know, sir, that I won't wait around to be a captive at your master's court, or to be judged with solemn looks from dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up and display me to the shouting mobs of Rome with all their harsh judgments? I'd rather have a friendly grave in a ditch in Egypt. I'd rather be laid stark naked in the mud on the shores of the Nile and let waterflies lay eggs on me until I become disgusting. I'd rather you turned Egypt's tall pyramids into a gallows and hung me from them in chains!\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nHis legs bestrid the ocean. His reared arm Crested the world. His voice was propertied As all the tunèd spheres, and that to friends. But when he meant to quail and shake the orb, He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty, There was no winter in ’t, an autumn ’twas That grew the more by reaping. His delights Were dolphinlike; they showed his back above The element they lived in. In his livery Walked crowns and crownets. Realms and islands were As plates dropped from his pocket.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nHe was so tall that his legs straddled the ocean. His upraised arm reached across the whole world. When he spoke to friends, his voice had the same qualities as musical spheres. But when he wanted to frighten and shake the world, his voice rumbled like thunder. His generosity was endless. It was like an autumn harvest, that grew more bountiful the more you drew from it. The things he took delight in revealed his extraordinary character; just as a dolphin's fin rises above the water, his character made him rise above the level of common people. Kings and princes were his servants. He could give away realms and islands as easily as he could drop silver coins from his pocket.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nYou lie so blatantly that even the gods can hear you! But if there is or ever was such a man, he's greater than anything that could be dreamed up. Nature cannot create creatures as strange as the ones we can imagine, but if nature could create a man like Antony, it would outdo even the imagination, and reveal how pathetic and worthless our imaginary visions are.\n\nDOLABELLA\n\nListen to me, good madam. Your loss is great because you yourself are great, and you bear it like the heavy burden it is. May I never achieve the success I seek if this is not true: that from sympathizing with your grief, I feel a grief that strikes deep in my own heart.\n\nCAESAR\n\nCleopatra, know We will extenuate rather than enforce. If you apply yourself to our intents, Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find A benefit in this change, but if you seek To lay on me a cruelty by taking Antony’s course, you shall bereave yourself Of my good purposes and put your children To that destruction which I’ll guard them from If thereon you rely. I’ll take my leave.\n\nCAESAR\n\nCleopatra, you should know that I intend to excuse your offenses rather than dwell on them. If you agree to go along with my plans, which are very generous, you'll find that this change will benefit you. But if you try to injure me by killing yourself as Antony did, you'll lose all the generosity I intend to show you and ensure that I destroy your children—which I will not do if you submit to me. I'll leave you now.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nSee, Caesar! Oh, behold How pomp is followed! Mine will now be yours, And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine. The ingratitude of this Seleucus does Even make me wild. [To SELEUCUS] O slave, of no more trust Than love that’s hired! What, goest thou back? Thou shalt Go back, I warrant thee! But I’ll catch thine eyes, Though they had wings. Slave, soulless villain, dog! Oh, rarely base!\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nSee, Caesar! Oh, see what happens when all the spectacle is over! My followers will now be your followers, and if we exchanged our positions, your followers would be my followers. Still, Seleucus's ingratitude makes me wild with anger.\n\n[To SELEUCUS] Oh you villainous man, you are less trustworthy than a mercenary! What, do you retreat from me? I bet you do! But even if your eyes had wings to fly away, I would catch them. Scoundrel, soulless villain, dog! Oh, you uncommonly corrupt man!\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nO Caesar, what a wounding shame is this, That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me, Doing the honor of thy lordliness To one so meek, that mine own servant should Parcel the sum of my disgraces by Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar, That I some lady trifles have reserved, Immoment toys, things of such dignity As we greet modern friends withal, and say Some nobler token I have kept apart For Livia and Octavia, to induce Their mediation, must I be unfolded With one that I have bred? The gods! It smites me Beneath the fall I have. [To SELEUCUS] Prithee, go hence, Or I shall show the cinders of my spirit Through th’ ashes of my chance. Wert thou a man, Thou wouldst have mercy on me.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nOh Caesar, I am so ashamed—you agreed to visit me here and honor me in my humiliation with your great presence, and my own servant adds to all my disgraces out of spite! Let's suppose, good Caesar, that I did hold back some little feminine, insignificant trinkets, the kind of common items that we give them away to our ordinary friends; and let's suppose that I did hold back some more valuable objects to give to your wife Livia and to Octavia, to persuade them to intervene for me—even supposing all that, do I deserve to be betrayed by a servant I have nurtured? The gods! This causes me more agony than the embarrassment I've already endured.\n\n[To SELEUCUS] Get out of here, or I'll show what's left of my strong will with what resources luck has left me. If you were a real man, you would have had sympathy for me.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nLet it be known that we, the greatest, are misjudged for the things other people do, and when we fall, we have to answer for the things that others have done in our name. We should therefore be pitied.\n\nCAESAR\n\nCleopatra, Not what you have reserved nor what acknowledged Put we i’ th’ roll of conquest. Still be ’t yours. Bestow it at your pleasure, and believe Caesar’s no merchant, to make prize with you Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheered. Make not your thoughts your prison. No, dear Queen, For we intend so to dispose you as Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed and sleep. Our care and pity is so much upon you That we remain your friend. And so, adieu.\n\nCAESAR\n\nCleopatra, I don't claim as a right of conquest either the treasure you have held back or the treasure you have declared in your inventory. Let it all still belong to you. Do what you like with it, and do not think that I am like a common merchant, so concerned with material things that I would haggle with you over your property. Therefore, be cheerful. Don't imprison yourself in gloomy thoughts. No, dear, Queen, because I intend to treat you in whatever way you yourself advise me to. Eat and sleep. I have so much care and pity for you that I will continue to be your friend. And so, goodbye.\n\nDOLABELLA\n\nMadam, as thereto sworn by your command, Which my love makes religion to obey, I tell you this: Caesar through Syria Intends his journey, and within three days You with your children will he send before. Make your best use of this. I have performed Your pleasure and my promise.\n\nDOLABELLA\n\nMadam, I vowed to obey your commands, and my devotion compels me to uphold that vow. Therefore, I must tell you this: Caesar intends to travel back through Syria, and within three days, he'll send you and your children on the road ahead of him. Make the best use of this information that you can. I've carried out my promise and served you well.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nNo, it will certainly happen, Iras. Insolent officers will grab at us as if we were prostitutes, and good-for-nothing poets will make up vulgar ballads about us. Witty actors will improvise plays about us and dramatize the parties we had in Alexandria. They'll bring out some drunken man to play Antony, and I'll see some squeaky-voiced boy play me, in all my greatness, as if I were nothing more than a whore.\n\nCLEOPATRA\n\nNow, Charmian! Dress me, my women, like a queen. Go get my best robes. I am going to Cydnus, to meet Mark Antony.\n\n[To IRAS] Iras, get going.\n\n[To CHARMIAN] Now, noble Charmian, we'll put our plans into action, and when you've done this task, I give you permission to do as you please until the end of the world.\n\n[To IRAS] Bring my crown and everything.\n\nCOUNTRYMAN\n\nVery many, men and women too. I heard of one of them nolonger than yesterday—a very honest woman, but something given to lie, as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty —how she died of the biting of it, what pain she felt. Truly, she makes a very good report o’ th’ worm. But he that will believe all that they say shall never be saved by half that they do. But this is most falliable, the worm’s an odd worm.\n\nCOUNTRYMAN\n\nVery many, both men and women. I heard of one just yesterday. She was a very honest woman, but had a slight tendency to lie, which women should not do except when it's honest. I heard she died from its bite and the pain. Really, she had very favorable things to say about the serpent. But if you believe what they say about the serpent and act on it, you'll never reach heaven. But this is definitely certain, that the serpent is an odd creature.\n\nCOUNTRYMAN\n\nYou must not think I am so simple but I know the devil himself will not eat a woman. I know that a woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the gods great harmin their women, for in every ten that they make, the devils mar five.\n\nCOUNTRYMAN\n\nYou can't think I'm so foolish—I know that even the devil would not eat a woman. I know that a woman is worthy food for the gods, so long as the devil doesn't corrupt her. But in fact, those terrible devils do the gods great harm by ruining so many women. For every ten women the gods make, the devil ruins five.\n\nYare, yare, good Iras, quick. Methinks I hear Antony call. I see him rouse himself To praise my noble act. I hear him mock The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men To excuse their after wrath. —Husband, I come! Now to that name my courage prove my title! I am fire and air, my other elements I give to baser life. —So, have you done? Come then and take the last warmth of my lips. Farewell, kind Charmian. Iras, long farewell.\n\nCAESAR\n\nOh, these women were weak but noble, too! If they had taken poison, we would be able to tell by the swelling of their bodies, but Cleopatra just looks as if she were sleeping—as if she were dreaming of catching another man like Antony with her strong, bewitching charms.\n\nCAESAR\n\nMost probable That so she died, for her physician tells me She hath pursued conclusions infinite Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed And bear her women from the monument. She shall be buried by her Antony. No grave upon the earth shall clip in it A pair so famous. High events as these Strike those that make them, and their story is No less in pity than his glory which Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall In solemn show attend this funeral, And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see High order in this great solemnity.\n\nCAESAR\n\nIt's most likely that she died from the serpents' bite, for her doctor tells me that she performed countless experiments to find easy ways to die. Pick up her bed and carry her women out of the tomb. She will be buried beside her Antony. No grave on earth will contain such a famous couple. Great events like these strike the hearts of those who brought them about. The pity of their story is as great as the glory of that person who brought them to this lamentable end. Our army will solemnly watch this funeral, and then they will go to Rome. Come, Dolabella, and observe the great decorum that this solemn occasion requires."
