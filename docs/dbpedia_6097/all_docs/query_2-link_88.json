        "text": "We were at a friend’s doctoral graduation party on a Friday night at the end of March. I had a glass of wine in one hand and our toddler on my hip when Marta found me. “I got a really weird email,” she said.\n\nThe moon hung full over our heads, and all of us were in short sleeves, holding beers or wine and licking barbecue off our fingers while our kids played hide-and-seek in the dark.\n\n“What?” I said.\n\n“Something about me sexually harassing students,” Marta said, taking F. from my arms.\n\n“What?” I said, louder this time.\n\n“It’s probably spam,” she said, and then she disappeared.\n\nThat night we toasted our friend and her newly minted Ph.D. She thanked her husband for his help, her professors swapped stories about her and we toasted them for their mentorship. Afterward, we all wandered around the backyard talking about our kids or research or how perfect Arizona can seem in March.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, I found our older daughter, N., standing on our friend’s bed with another little girl, who held a fistful of toilet paper and looked at me the way kids do when they’ve done something wrong. Strips of toilet paper littered the carpet, and I wondered whether one of them had peed her pants. Or maybe they’d had a toilet-paper fight. Or this was their version of snow in the desert.\n\n“We’re gonna pull out her tooth,” the girl said before I could say anything, looking at N. and her loose front tooth.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
