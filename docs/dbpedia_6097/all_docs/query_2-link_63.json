        "text": "This Game is Overrated\n\nAside from the relatively above average story and degree of player choice, Fallout New Vegas does not succeed in unifying all of its gameplay elements into a cohesive whole. The game itself is mediocre in every area except for immersion.\n\n-Combat is objectively horrendous. Enemies are forced to be bullet sponges at higher levels because the game has no way of inducing difficulty beyond health and damage scaling. Compare the AI of this game to the much earlier Halo: CE. If you throw a grenade at enemies in Fallout New Vegas, they will sometimes walk into it, whereas in the very first Halo, many years earlier, the AI reacts accordingly and flees. The gunplay is also lacking with no feeling of impact or strategy. It is as rudimentary as can be and is on par or even worse with Goldeneye or Perfect Dark from the N64. Melee is only a step above Morrowind due to better animations. Stealth, just like in any Bethesda game is a broken joke. Again, the AI is horrendous and it's easy to break the game with the right builds. Any game that has ever had stealth does stealth better than any Fallout game. Combat is a mess and mods can't fix it because the game is not designed around combat. It is a tacked on afterthought and the implementation VATS in the first person is a continuing admission of this.\n\n-Exploration is overrated because Obsidian's world design simply isn't that good. Unlike games with cohesive worlds, that continually push and pull on the player through dedicated area and level design, Fallout NV is a flat sandbox filled with vast swaths of disinterest, broken up by occasional segments of the aforementioned mediocre combat or unique encounters. You don't explore the world of Fallout NV, you explore map markers because the \"world\" itself is disjointed. Contrast this to games like BioShock, Resident Evil, Mario64, Dark Souls, Prey and so on where the game world is a constant friend and foe of the player and the environment is synchronized with the gameplay.\n\n-Elaborating on the above point, Fallout NV has no good interior environments, aesthetically or design-wise. The small amount of charm of exploration on the surface disappears in interior environments because they aren't really levels, but a series of bland hallways filled with more horrendous combat. The interior locations do not offer any interesting exploration, tension or quality encounters because the game does not have the elements to support them, along with their mediocre design.\n\n-The story itself is also very overrated. A good example of this is the very beginning where you are to choose between siding with Goodsprings or taking it over with the Powder Gangers. The problem is that there is no real reason to side with the Powder Gangers. Goodsprings saved your life. You as a player already have a utilitarian and personal connection to Goodsprings and a passable reward isn't really incentive enough to betray it. It's only a single degree in stupidity below the infamous quest to blow up Megaton in Fallout 3. The rest of the factions and characters are mere caricatures: the NCR is just a generic continuation of the US; Caesar's Legion are yawn inducing Roman larpers; Mr. House is an edgy libertarian and so on and so forth. It's all very kitschy and while it works for the world, it doesn't stand in merit on its own and is simple parody. Certainly not \"genius\" by any stretch of the imagination, as it is often described as.\n\n-The environment is pretty bland and isn't worth exploring. Even Fallout 3 tended to have superior environmental story telling and areas of interest, along with better environmental design. I'd also like to clarify this isn't a matter of graphics because it's not. The Pitt for example, was a great example of an immersive, fascinating and aesthetically striking environment that nothing in Fallout NV comes close to touching. Even traipsing around in the ruins of DC had far more player engagement than anything within NV and this is not a matter of \"it's the desert, hurr\". It's a videogame. You can do whatever you need to make the environment interesting while still respecting the location of the game. Obsidian merely didn't have this vision.\n\nThe rest of NV's issues are relatively minor, but the fact is that NV is objectively not a good game; it's a bad game with a decent story. If you don't get an ego-erection from simply DoiNg WhAtEvEr YoU WaNt and dictating the lives of wastelanders, it's easy to lose interest with NV because it has little else to offer besides self-insertion. The people that overrate it do so because they're not interested in gameplay; they want an interactive movie where they can be empowered through decision making and escapism. Without the rose tinted glasses on, it's easy to see that NV is woefully inadequate outside of making dialogue choices and crossing off map markers. It's an objectively overrated game and does not deserve even a fraction of the praise it receives from its fanboy cult.\n\nExtrapolate your opinions."
