        "text": "This drew me in immediately. Extremely well written, fast paced but with great detail.\n\nI binged this in one go and my only complaint is that I want more right away.\n\nI love the stubbornness if the MC - screw logic, practicality, - the MC does what he wants and he powers thru obstacles.\n\nOne orphan. One year. And one sword that is far, far too big for his body.\n\nWelcome to capital-O Orphan, where the numbers are high and the aptitude is higher. The protagonist has a sponsor, (unhealthy levels of) grit, and the potential to make numbers go up in a manner scarcely seen outside of Cookie Clicker.\n\nThat last phrase might give the impression that Guy Incognito is writing a story where everything else is mere set-dressing for an anthropomorphised idle-game, however there's a level of diligence in all aspects of Orphan that elevates it massively compared to a standard LitRPG.\n\nThe characters are well-defined; not overly-complex but bearing firm presences that keeps them distinct from those around them while also remaining compelling. The grammar is pretty much impeccable -- a few errors have been spotted, but they're too minimal to detract from the overall work.\n\nBut the style is what I'm most impressed with. There's a clear trend towards clarity of expression over flashiness, but there are discrete embellishments and adornments sprinkled throughout that prevent it from feeling rote while simultaneously never detracting from the overall thrust of the chapter. And the conveyance of action and thoughts within each contains a level of refinement that's rare for the site, and frankly rare for publishing in general.\n\nBut even at 60,000 words in, it remains impossible to fully grasp the shape Orphan's narrative will take. There's clearly a living, breathing world, but will it be one Alarion and we, as readers, will explore, or will it be a military fantasy, or a single-minded pursuit of higher and higher numbers? Will there be intricate arcs? Much like its protagonist, Orphan is still taking shape, and though what's here holds immense promise it still feels that it's yet to reveal its true character.\n\nThis story has me absolutely enthralled. I think I'm experiencing withdrawal from there not being more than 25 chapters currently (the stories' only downside so far). The pacing is excellent, the world building is excellent, the characters are excellent and all have their own personalities. The MC has his own interesting personality that is consistent and entertaining to read about.\n\nThe author has set the story up such that there is much room for a plot to form as well as their being politic intrigue in the story at some point. Also, a big sticking point for me is that the authors' grammar is amazing. Grammar is usually very important to me and I am happy to say that I have not seen a single grammatical error in the 25 chapters I've read so far. The author claims this is his first fiction but it feels like he's an accomplished author.\n\nThe site is free - just go read the story! It'll hook you\n\nMy only concern at this point is that the author will burn themself out. I've seen too many stories suffer from an author attempting to push themselves and meet the expectations of strangers... only to end up compromising both their own wellbeing AND the quality of their story.\n\nBut so far... it's an excellent start to a slow-burn epic.\n\nAs of chapter 30 it's mostly just establishing the world, the characters, and transitioning from backstory into the plot. So i would recommend waiting until chapter 50 comes out to get invested... or you'll be like me... desperately jonesing for more.\n\nMC is stubborn to a fault, which means he'll do dumb things out of stubbornness. Despite the fact that he is otherwise intelligent. So, if you want perfect characters who make perfect decisions maybe look elsewhere.\n\nThat being said, his imperfections are a balance and don't compromise his ability to be powerful... they just complicate the journey.\n\nThere is obviously a set up for potential future relationships, whether its with Sierra or not, only time will tell. But the vitrian fetish for high aptitude means it will have to be a plot point later, if only because marriage to a powerful house is a good way to gain more protection. Sierra is a deep enough character (some anger issues, maybe some jealousy) that it clearly isnt meant to fall into any tired tsundere or yandere tropes. She just has character flaws she's working through just like alarion is.\n\nThe writing is also very good... as are the ideas it contains."
