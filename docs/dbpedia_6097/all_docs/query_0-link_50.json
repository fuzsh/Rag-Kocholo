        "text": "When I was making Thirteen Days of Christmas Horror Shorts, I came across so many great Santa shorts I had to make a separate list. Even narrowing it down to six was hard! Here are my favorite Kris Kringles and Old Saint Nicks.\n\n6. Seasons Greetings (2015)\n\nLength: 4:26\n\nA girl wakes up to a present from Santa and a monster in her bed. Not much to it, but somehow this short has both fun jump scares and a cute vibe to it. Watch here\n\n5. Luchagore Christmas (2017)\n\nLength: 1:43\n\nThe most gore (aside from the claymation) on the list, and a very sour-looking set. This super short is a great one because of the dirty, disgusting Santa, focus on disturbing details, and the gore galore. Very Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Watch here\n\n4. Christmas Presence (2015)\n\nLength: 5:16\n\nA babysitter arrives at an over-decorated house. It takes her a while to realize that the life-size Santa statue with the creepy white mask is not part of the family’s decor. One thing that really bothered me was that when the babysitter entered the house, you couldn’t see the glow of the outdoor lights and the interior was so sparsely decorated. Watch here\n\n3. Milk & Cookies (2017)\n\nLength: 2:35 When a girl doesn’t follow her father’s rules to not eat the milk and cookies, she suffers cookie-consequences. Sean Whalen as the dad in a Freddy Krueger sweater is fantastic. The snarl at greedy children on Christmas is appreciated. And best of all, the blue cookie-eater creature with the pointy nose and blood pouring out of his mouth was just spectacular. Maybe even my favorite horror Santa. Watch here\n\n2. Here Comes Santa (2016)\n\nLength: 5:03\n\nA child stays up to catch Santa on his video camera, but instead discovers he’s a hideous skeletal creature. Simple, cute, memorable. Watch here\n\n1. Winter Stalker (2009)\n\nLength: 2:05\n\nArty and stylized, this short features Santa checking his list. He’s making a doll for Katie, and he’s been watching her closely. His voice sounds like Jigsaw, and our Santa is dire need of a bubble bath. A great short with a twist that leaves me feeling uncomfortable.\n\nWatch here\n\nChristmas is long and painful, but these mini movies are short and sweet! Here are my favorite holiday shorts under 15 minutes, from the weird and wacky to the disturbing and grotesque. Grab the eggnog and rum cookies and enjoy these stocking stuffers. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! Also check out my Top Ten Christmas Horror Movies list!\n\n13. I’ll Be Alone for Christmas (2015)\n\nLength: 7:09\n\nThe first of the lonely Christmas girl films on the list, this is simply about a girl stalked by a mysterious stranger. There isn’t much for the story, as it mostly centres around a text conversation. The acting is passable, but there’s a fun little scare.\n\n12. Ghoul Log (2018)\n\nLength: 2:59\n\nClay people with gross teeth eat a feast with their mouths open. After they stuff their faces with yule log, the giant-handed puppets are trapped in trees. Horror ASMR. Part of Creepy Christmas Film Festival.\n\nWatch here\n\n11. Something Under The Tree (2014)\n\nLength: 4:26\n\nA little boy watches Santa from the stairs. He rushes to open the present Santa leaves him, and finds a gift that will help him to rid of the elf under the tree. I wish there were a few minutes of character build and mood setting, as you’re just dropped into the start of the scene, but I enjoyed the tension and the sour turn of events.\n\nWatch here\n\n10. A Very Zombie Holiday (2010)\n\nLength: 3:11\n\nA black and white instructional video for vintage ladies to survive Christmas… and zombies. It’s well-made and cute, but it’s in need of a bit of pop and pizzazz.\n\nWatch here\n\n9. Crafty (2018)\n\nLength: 3:34\n\nThis strange and original claymation is about a creature and his praying mantis friend who eat animals in a frenzy and then make the bones into a Christmas tree. The bone tree is displayed on top of the stump they live in, and a human child discovers it. Weird and gory, but definitely creative. Part of Creepy Christmas Film Festival.\n\nWatch here\n\n8. Elf on the Shelf (2017)\n\nLength: 2:00\n\nThe Elf on the Shelf toy comes to life and kills the babysitter and her boyfriend in the spirit of Christmas. The choice of the babysitter over family members seems like an odd and lazy choice. What parents go out on Christmas Eve, anyway? The Elf is creepy, yet charming.\n\nWatch here\n\n7. Eve of the Nutcracker (2016)\n\nLength: 5:59\n\nThere are a few good “gal drinking on the couch alone on Christmas” shorts, but I picked this one as the best because of the on-theme ending. Our girl receives a nutcracker which then seems to end up in a different spot every time she looks. She throws it away, but the giver of the gift isn’t too happy that the gift isn’t well received and… retaliates. The make-up could use a little love since we don’t know anything about the killer, but otherwise, it’s awesome.\n\nWatch here\n\n6. Twas the Night of the Tree Beast (2012)\n\nLength: 6:04\n\nJosh decorates his video store, but is interrupted by holiday-hater, Kevin. Josh makes a Christmas wish and his tree comes to life when it’s plugged in. Unfortunately, the tree is hungry for money… and flesh. Very Canadian.\n\nWatch here\n\n5. Yuletide (2017)\n\nLength: 10:00\n\nThis is actually a short about Krampus! It starts off by introducing the family members/actors and then shows the cranky family silently eating dinner. Kelly smashes her antique present from her grandfather and ruins Christmas. A Krampus monster is discovered peeking out from the attic, and everything goes downhill from there. The cinematography is the best part.\n\nWatch here\n\n4. Slay Bells (2015)\n\nLength: 11:23\n\nThe main character (a girl who’s turn it is to host Christmas) is expressive and over-the-top, providing us with a hilarious and dramatic holiday short that’s fun for the whole family! This year, it’s the younger sister’s turn to host Christmas, and when the family ruins everything with their judgements, she has a meltdown, but in the end, gets the gift she’s been looking for.\n\nWatch here\n\n3. Do You See What I See (2016)\n\nLength: 14:01\n\nA masked murderer with glasses crashes a Christmas party. When it’s discovered what is seen by putting on the glasses, a strange and quirky truth is revealed. Lots of character build (almost too much) and a fun storyline make this one a safe bet.\n\nWatch here\n\n2. Christmas Clay Massacre (The Beauty of Horror) (2018)\n\nLength: 2:05\n\nIn a commercial for a colouring book (yes, really), Santa gains Krampus-like qualities and decapitates reindeer with a chainsaw.\n\nWatch here\n\n1. Humbug (2016)\n\nLength: 6:59\n\nProbably the most memorable on the list, this horror tale shows the contrast between the goth Christmas-hater and Mrs. Christmas herself. The problem is solved when the humbug is expertly removed from our anti-holiday gal, so she can live her life the way it was meant to be- merry!\n\nWatch here\n\nCan you believe I haven’t made this list yet?! And just barely in time for Christmas. Although I’m not the biggest fan of Christmas most years, I’m always a fan of horror. Unfortunately, there are no Chanukah or Kwanzaa horror-holiday films, so here are some movies about creepy Saint Nick and bad presents.\n\nHonorable Mention: Jack Frost (1997)\n\nI don’t know why the cover image for this movie has a weird, CGI skeleton face, because the horror Jack Frost looks exactly like the kids movie Jack Frost except with angry eyebrows. But guess what… this one came out first! I love a good evil snowman, but this one ain’t making the cut because of the ridiculous carrot rape scene.\n\n10. Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984) or Christmas Evil (1980)\n\nI’m cheating a little, here, but there aren’t a lot of Christmas horrors that are more than just set around the holidays. Both of these films are generic, eighties slasher nonsense, but they each have a good ole killer Santa.\n\n9. Christmas Horror Story (2015)\n\nThis four-pack anthology feels like a Christmas version of Trick R’ Treat. The film includes a lonely radio host, a group of teenagers investigating old crimes at a school, a creepy kid, a white-powdered Krampus, a Santa in need of a bath, and obviously, a group of zombie elves. The story about the changeling I liked best- it seemed very real, and was only ruined by the costumey look of the monster up-close. It’s about a family who loses their son in the woods and takes home the wrong version of him instead. The ending isn’t bad, but the movie could have been built with two of these stories.\n\n8. Krampus (2015)\n\nI mean, it’s not the best movie. There is way too much going on and the gingerbread men and flashback animations almost push it into an unwatchable category. The Krampus idea hadn’t been used much before this movie came out, and I thought they did a good job with the look and feel of the character. It just needed a little more direction and focus, even though the idea of a family hiding from a Krampus storm seems like a pretty simple idea.\n\n7. Better Watch Out (2016)\n\nThis home invasion horror-thriller doesn’t have a lot to do with Christmas, but there is a Christmas tree and lights and snow and such. There’s a twist in the middle, but overall, it’s pretty predictable. A babysitter and an awkward pre-teen who’s in love with her hide from intruders. It should have been better, but there was an unsuccessful attempt at a comedy shimmer that just didn’t work. It needed tension, creep, and more of a horror direction instead. (I recently saw the trailer, and if I had been tricked by this first, I probably would have appreciated it more, so watch that first.)\n\n6. Sint (2010)\n\nSint (Saint) is a Dutch scarytale about Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas), an undead bishop who rides around on his horse killing people. It’s an original movie with an awful climax and lots of holiday cheer and fear, although I’m not sure how I feel about the whole “Black Pete” situation.\n\n5. Silent Night (2012)\n\nAnother instantly forgettable Christmas title attached to a decent holiday horror. A killer Santa with a mask slaughters the naughty while police people, Sugar and Salty, fail miserably at trying to stop him from killing… literally everybody. But you want everyone to die these random, horrible deaths because they’re all just disposable Barbies who make moronic choices like running straight towards the murderer. To wrap this little movie gift up nicely, it’s bad decisions and ruthless killing fun.\n\n4. Rare Exports (2010)\n\nA film from Finland with an original story that I’m not even quite sure how to describe. Like a horror fairytale come to life where Santa is a giant Krampus-like creature who has been frozen in ice. The elves are old, hunched over men with wispy beards, and they want all the children for Santa once he’s melted. A little boy, his dad, and the hunters try to stop evil Santa and the elves in a part humor part action-drama sort of way.\n\n3. Gremlins (1984)\n\nIt all started in Chinatown… and when you buy a gift for someone in Chinatown, there are always strange rules that come with it, such as ‘no food after midnight’! About a sweet kid who breaks all the rules and endures the “horrors” of the evil-turned mogwais. Even though they’re mean and nasty, there’s a lot of cuteness going on in this film. It’s a very unusual and special Christmas movie, but not so heavy on the horror.\n\n2. Black Christmas (1974)\n\nHere is your original, seventies, better than the sequels and decently constructed horror film. It’s about a group of sorority girls who are murdered in their home on campus. There’s no charcoal snow, or African Santas to make the title make sense, but the character development is refreshing and this well-directed gem is definitely one to watch. You can probably skip the remake, though.\n\n1. The Gingerdead Man (2005)\n\nI really love the whole trilogy of Gary Busey as an evil, murderous, cookie. It’s not like there are all these amazing, scary Christmas movies out there, so might as well indulge in some yummy horror silliness. It’s probably already what you’ve guessed: a killer’s blood gets into some cookie batter resulting in the baked cookie going on a bite-sized murdering spree. I’m pretty sure I laughed at movie number two’s title for about twenty minutes. Check it out.\n\nScore: 5.5/10\n\nLength: 85\n\nRating: NR\n\nLanguage: English\n\nCategories: 2000s, recent, anthology, murderer, alien, monster, zombie, devil, vampire, horror comedy, holiday, gore porn\n\nAnother film of shorts! This one, brought to you by the letter ‘M’. Because I guess they had a lot of ‘M’ entries. I love anthologies because there is always something for everyone but I really could have done without the scratchy title music. For this review, I’ve decided to give each segment a grade and just a quickie synopsis of a few words.\n\nMagnetic Tape – Silly, gory, nerd fun. (B)\n\nMaieusiophobia – Terrifying waxmation birth. (A)\n\nMailbox – Skippable vampire trick-or-treat. (C)\n\nMake Believe – Mediocre murder and kid fairies. (c)\n\nMalnutrition – A well-done zombie segment. (A)\n\nManure – A memorable, May-like poop monster. (A)\n\nMarauder – A hipstertastic black and white tricycle race. (B)\n\nMariachi – Murders in a death metal music video. (C)\n\nMarriage – A creative and captivating therapy session with a surprise ending. (A)\n\nMartyr – A cult ritual that I could have sacrificed. (C)\n\nMatador – A sick and twisted gorefest of intensity. (A)\n\nMeat – A dark meatmation segment that is unique and thought-provoking. (A)\n\nMermaid – A stupid mermaid meal. (C)\n\nMerry Christmas – Krampus feels bad for himself with a prisoner who has a face for acting. (C)\n\nMess – Oh God, why. You deserve to know now that ‘the mess’ is water poop coming from a belly button. (C for can’t. I can’t.)\n\nMessiah – A woman is captured by masked forest-people. (A)\n\nMind Meld – A clever, gory experiment. (A)\n\nMiracle – Well, it’s about box… it was too short and quick for me to comprehend anything else. (B)\n\nMobile – A man gets torture text instructions with a twist. (A)\n\nMom – A light zombie-kid romance. (B)\n\nMoonstruck – An unexpected paper cartoon about romance, betrayal, revenge, and death. (A)\n\nMormon Missionaries – An encounter with two missionaries takes a turn for the worst. And then it gets worse. (A)\n\nMother – A giant CGI spider. (C)\n\nMuff – A hilarious hotel sex encounter goes fatally wrong. (B)\n\nMunging – Gross and awful topic, but the corpse’s make-up was great. (B)\n\nMutant – Eager losers shoot at flying mutants that break out of people’s faces. It was good until the the first bat was revealed, and then it got really bad. (C)\n\nScore: 4/10*\n\nLength: 80\n\nRating: R\n\nLanguage: English\n\nCategories: 2000s, recent, monster, murderer, toys, anthology, holiday\n\nThis anthology is all female directors and lead actors (but not writers), so the disappointment with the film hit harder than usual. One of the stories is even written by the musician, St. Vincent who is a gifted visionary. The film has four stories that aren’t related to each other at all, and none of them are original, memorable, creative, or provide any indication that this movie is focused on women. The only thing I can picture myself remembering when thinking of this film later is the strange, doll-head stop motion in between the segments. Also, I get why the film is called “XX“, but considering there’s a band already with the same name, they really could have tried a little harder. This whole film feels like a real lack of effort on everyone’s part.\n\nThe Box\n\nIn one line: Cannibals at Christmas.\n\nGood: I liked the mystery around what was in the box and this was probably the best story out of the four. It had clear direction to it.\n\nBad: The script was pretty cheesy, and there were parts that didn’t exactly make a lot of sense to me.\n\nThe Birthday Party\n\nIn one line: Dead dad ruins birthday party.\n\nGood: The struggles of a mom trying to make everything okay for her child’s birthday is relatable. The costumes are also hilarious, and I appreciated the quirky vibe.\n\nBad: It’s really just an episode of a woman dragging around a man’s dead body and that can get pretty dull.\n\nDon’t Fall\n\nIn one line: Monsters in the desert.\n\nGood: The monster was fairly well done. Good makeup as opposed to CGI.\n\nBad: It was a pretty overdone story idea with nothing special added to it.\n\nHer Only Living Son\n\nIn one line: Teenager turns into violent werewolf-monster of sorts.\n\nGood: Again, the mom’s struggles were relatable.\n\nBad: There wasn’t really an ending, and the son making the mom crawl towards him on her knees was pretty cringe-worthy.\n\n* I’m giving this an overall score, as none of the shorts were anything special, and none were better or worse than any other, which is pretty rare. All in all, the meh movie is getting a meh overall score.\n\nHappy Canada 150, my fellow proud Canadians and adoring non-Canadians! Here are my favorite scary Canuck movies to watch after the fireworks, or hungover the next morning, accompanied by Canada’s top snacks.\n\n10. The Brood (1979)\n\nOne of four Cronenburg and sons films on the list, it’s about a woman driven by her psychologist to do some pretty strange things, among them, lead a brood of lumpy lawn gnome look-alikes. The skin sack is a hard image to forget, so you may want to have a couple 2-4s and mickeys on hand.\n\nCanadian Snack: Watch a woman lick her bloody baby while you nosh on some flavour-packed Lays ketchup chips and guzzle down a spicy Caesar with a green bean.\n\nReview here\n\nTrailer here\n\n9. Terror Train (1980)\n\nA satisfying New Year’s Eve slasher movie about med students at a costume party held on a train who are killed off by a masked murderer. What a kerfuffle with everyone stuck on that train. Better grab your toques and runners and get a move on.\n\nCanadian Snack: In order to stay up past midnight you’re going to need some caffeine. But since we’re on a moving train, better reach for a Coffee Crisp instead.\n\nReview here\n\nTrailer here\n\n8. The Fly (1986)\n\nJeff Goldblum and Gina Davis are surrounded by a hefty helping of that goopy, slimy, eighties blood and gore. It’s pretty much every superhero story, without the superhero part, leaving just- man turns into fly, and it doesn’t go too well.\n\nCanadian Snack: If there’s one thing that flies like, it’s sugar. So give them what they want in a sweet, buttery treat: the butter tart.\n\nThis movie doesn’t yet have a full review.\n\nTrailer here\n\n7. Black Christmas (1974)\n\nThis is a film about a woman calling for her cat, Claude… I mean… it’s about sorority girls trapped in a house with a mystery killer. And also Christmas! So it’s snowing and no one is really around to help. Better than the 2006 version by a million kilometres, but not necessarily thrilling.\n\nCanadian Snack: Our country doesn’t really have much to do with Christmas dinner, so instead, grab a Tims double double with a maple-glazed donut for breakfast.\n\nReview here\n\nTrailer here\n\n6. Dead Ringers (1988)\n\nWho wouldn’t want to watch a movie about twin gynecologists addicted to drugs, both played by Jeremy Irons? I generally dislike it when a movie is two or more hours long, but I didn’t mind it in this case. Felt like I was just watching a few episodes in a row of Twin Peaks. It’s labeled as a drama / horror / thriller, but it doesn’t have the typical tension of a horror or thriller; I found it heavy on the drama end.\n\nCanadian Snack: Nothing goes better together than a Montreal-style bagel and Montreal smoked meat.\n\nThis movie doesn’t yet have a full review.\n\nTrailer here\n\n5. Antiviral (2012)\n\nA film about a business that offers diseases (carried by celebrities) to the public, in order to allow the fans to feel closer to the famous person they’re obsessed with. So strange, and so creative with such a fantastically interesting lead character played by Caleb Landry Jones (Get Out). Lots of drug hazes, needles galore, and so many blood-soaked white things that even Tide couldn’t clean.\n\nCanadian Snack: Some good ole fashioned brand-name KD with a dollop of ketchup. The Canadian way.\n\nThis movie doesn’t yet have a full review.\n\nTrailer here\n\n4. Cube (1997)\n\nOut of the three Cube movies, the first has the best ending- with a twist. A group of people are trapped in a room-filled structure, where each room has a different violent booby-trap waiting for them.\n\nCanadian Snack: We’re too hip to be square, but a homemade nanaimo bar is to die for, and angular enough to accompany this franchise.\n\nReview here\n\nTrailer here\n\n3. American Mary (2012)\n\nA revenge flick about a med student turned underground body modifier is American only by title.\n\nCanadian Snack: To go with the American theme, believe it or not, the popular sushi order, California roll, was invented by a Japanese sushi chef who moved to Vancouver in the seventies.\n\nReview here\n\nTrailer here\n\n2. Ginger Snaps (2000)\n\nGood things come in threes, but the original of the well-known Canadian trilogy is the best. Nothing beats some simplistic teen werewolf angst, eh?\n\nCanadian Snack: Unfortunately, ginger snaps aren’t really Canadian, so instead how bout some Chinese food? Surprisingly, ginger beef was invented right here in Calgary, AB. I think a werewolf would prefer meat over cookies anyway.\n\nReview here\n\nTrailer here\n\n1. Silent Hill (2006)\n\nThis dreamlike fantasy horror about a mother searching for her daughter in an eerie, ash-covered town gets the top spot. This fantastic goth film is an adaptation of a survival video game and couldn’t have been done better. Around every turn is a mysterious creature, its details creatively imagined. I’d pay a lot of loonies and twoonies to see this at the theatre in 3D.\n\nCanadian Snack: The number one spot deserves nothing but the number one Canadian food. So versatile and comforting, you can’t do better than a proper poutine.\n\nThis movie doesn’t yet have a full review.\n\nTrailer here\n\nBONUS! The legendary tv show, Are You Afraid of the Dark, is of course, also Canadian.\n\nLooking for more? Try Pontypool, Hobo With a Shotgun, Pin, The Changeling, Videodrome, The Shrine, Prom Night.\n\nThe little treat featuring each of the biggest holidays of the year is composed of eight stories from different directors. Definitely one of the better horror anthologies to date.\n\nValentine’s Day\n\nDirector: Kevin Kölsch and Dennis Widmyer (Starry Eyes)\n\nScore: four out of five Hershey’s kisses\n\nA bullied outcast (not unlike in Carrie or The Craft) competes with the blonde popular girl for their swim teacher’s heart. Literally and figuratively. I tend to like a movie about obsessive love, and I really enjoyed this one. It’s memorable in a good way.\n\nSt. Patrick’s Day\n\nDirector: Gary Shore (Dracula Untold)\n\nScore: three out of five snakeskin flasks\n\nA woman who yearns for a child is put off when her new student begins doing strange things involving a snake. After waking in a parking lot, the teacher becomes pregnant with a reptilian creature. This episode is all well and good until it crashes and burns in a field where a silly CGI snake is celebrated by Danny Zuko’s animal-headed posse.\n\nEaster*\n\nDirector: Nicholas McCarthy (The Pact)\n\nScore: two and a half religious rodents out of five\n\nA little girl who is uneasy about the Easter Bunny’s visit gets more than she fears when she stays awake and catches the character himself. The Easter Bunny is this creepy-as-fuck Jesus man-rabbit that’s all skin and no fluffy white fur. There’s not much to this one- she sees the creature and then is turned into a rabbit herself.\n\nMother’s Day\n\nDirector: Sarah Adina Smith (The Midnight Swim)\n\nScore: three out of five bewitched baby bumps\n\nA woman who cursed with a pregnancy every time she has sex goes to a fertility ritual gathering. She is drugged and kidnapped in the most romantic way, as she grows more and more pregnant with “the gateway”. This segment seems to focus on beauty over horror, and is in fact quite enchanting with all its natural female power. Sadly, the end really falls flat and is a huge disappointment in its unoriginality.\n\nFather’s Day*\n\nDirector: Anthony Scott Burns\n\nScore: four out of five deep daddy directions\n\nAnother woman (yup, the leads are all females so far) receives a mysterious package with a tape player inside. The recording is of her father who asks her to come find him. It’s very simple and vague, and relies heavily on the acting and your imagination. The story reminds me a little of Stranger Things, and I’d love to see how this short would do as a full-length film.\n\nHalloween\n\nDirector: Kevin Smith (Tusk, the worst horror movie I’ve seen since Human Centipede)\n\nScore: one out of five cringe-worthy car batteries\n\nA douche who runs a scuzzy webcam business gets what’s coming to him when his cam girls rebel and use the power of three to cause some… er… discomfort. I’m all for a revenge story, but I’m not too into torture porn, and I really could have done without this episode ruining my favorite holiday.\n\nChristmas\n\nDirector: Scott Stewart (Dark Skies)\n\nScore: two out of five presented realities\n\nSeth Green is out of luck when he is too late to get a last-minute Christmas present until he has the opportunity to steal the game from a man- or save his life. It sounds exciting, but all the episode is only comprised of a few virtual reality revelations and then it’s over.\n\nNew Year’s Eve\n\nDirector: Adam Egypt Mortimer (Some Kind of Hate)\n\nScore: two and a half axe-girlfriends out of five\n\nA tired single girl goes on a date with a yellow-toothed psycho, but he’s in for the quite the first date. I empathize, because I’d really like to do the same thing to some of the guys I’ve dated. Not a lot happens, and this episode seems like the shortest one, but it’s still mildly entertaining. Really great to watch before bed, because it makes you want to jump up and brush your teeth.\n\n* friend favorite\n\nScore: 4/10\n\nLength: 99\n\nRating: Unrated (but I’d guess 18A)\n\nLanguage: English\n\nCategories: 2000s, recent, holiday, murderer, forest\n\nMy last holiday-themed movie of the year is another Krampus edition, but this Canadian film is comprised of four different stories, interlaced at the end. It very much feels like a Christmas version of Trick R’ Treat. The film begins with William Shatner, a lonely radio host, playing songs in the studio. The main story is about a group of teenagers investigating old crimes at a school. There are some terrific jump-scares, but it’s very teentastic (not in a fun way like Scream Queens) and the ending is just plain bad. The story about the changeling I liked best- it seemed very real, and was only ruined by the costumey look of the monster up-close. It’s about a family who loses their son in the woods and takes home the wrong version of him instead. The last two stories bring Krampus and scruffy Santa together, but are by far, the worst entries. Santa kills all of his elves-turned zombies, and the spirit of Krampus attacks a family. This wasn’t all that different a theme from that of the movie, Krampus also released this year. Although Krampus‘ version of the Christmas devil is more mystical and, I felt the snowy white monster looked more like what I would have hoped. Except maybe it was a little cheesy, and he didn’t even have claws. No one’s perfect. I was pleasantly surprised by the twist ending where the stories were intertwined- I wasn’t looking to guess it, and the idea made sense.\n\nphoto credit: http://hellhorror.com"
