        "text": "With the holiday season upon us, have you been watching Hallmark Christmas movies? With wine (or eggnog) in hand have you said confidently aloud to yourself, “Hey! I could write one of these things!”?\n\nWell, if you’ve made this proclamation, you’re not alone. We know because every December, we get a bevy of requests around the library from patrons wanting to read Hallmark Christmas scripts to study the formatting and see how it’s done.\n\nIf you’ve ever had the holiday-time burst of tenacity to say, “Hey! I could write a Hallmark Christmas movie!” and want a deeper glimpse at the structure and conventions, we’ve created this primer for you.\n\nAs many an online publication or TikTok account are quick to point out, there is a definite recipe for these movies. With nearly 40 of them produced every year plus a stalwart and passionate viewing audience, Hallmark Christmas movies are a serious business. Some writers make fruitful careers writing primarily Hallmark Christmas movies. While many feature writers can languish in years of development waiting for their rom-com script to get made, writers of Hallmark Christmas movies see their dialogue spoken, their tinsel-y worlds realized, their work produced.\n\nThis post is part of our ongoing “TV Format Fundamentals” series whereby we breakdown the act structure and elements of different script TV formats. Information presented here is based on looking at the handful of Hallmark scripts we have in the library and from talking to friends who’ve written Hallmark Christmas movies. For further reading, check out this article by Tom Nolan for Written By in 2019.\n\nWhile we won’t break down a full script in this post (it would make it too long), we will offer pointers along the way. It’s part of how we’re making script information accessible beyond our WGF Library doors. Plus, it’s the holidays and this is fun—so grab that eggnog glass and let’s go.\n\nHallmark Christmas movies have a history that goes all the way back to the beginning of television. Perhaps knowing the history can help a fledgling Hallmark Christmas movie writer better understand the contours of the format… the recipe. To know where you’re going, it’s best to know where you’ve been.\n\nWhat we now know as the “Hallmark Christmas movie” is descended from the Hallmark Hall of Fame. Hallmark, the greeting card company, used to sponsor radio shows like Radio Reader’s Digest in the late 1940s, then moved to sponsoring the television program Hallmark Television Playhouse.\n\nHallmark Television Playhouse began on Christmas Eve 1951. The inaugural broadcast featured the first opera ever written for television, Amahl and the Night Visitors. Later in the 1950s, Hallmark Television Playhouse became Hallmark Hall of Fame. Like a lot of nascent television, these programs were essentially filmed versions of classic plays. Lots of Shakespeare.\n\nLater still in the 50s, Hallmark Hall of Fame evolved into television movies that aired 4 to 8 times a year. As a greeting card company, Hallmark wanted to sell cards. These prestigious TV films — based on novels or plays and starring top-level actors — aired around the major holidays to keep GREETING CARDS at the top of the audience’s mind. Check out UCLA Film & Television Archive’s book Hallmark Hall of Fame: The First Fifty Years next time you’re in the library.\n\nHallmark Hall of Fame continues even to this day — except now the movies don’t air on the major networks like CBS or NBC. Rather, they air on the Hallmark Channel, which began in earnest in 2001. Hallmark and The Jim Henson Company became co-owners of what was then a Christian cable channel, The Odyssey Network. Their aim was to make a network anchored by family friendly and family oriented content.\n\nWith emphasis on family values, optimism and not taking on particularly heavy, political or controversial subjects, Christmas movies quickly became a staple of the Hallmark Channel’s programming. With these movies, Hallmark stays true to the original modus operandi of Hallmark Hall of Fame — to sell us on Christmas… the mother of all greeting card holidays. (That’s why they make Valentine’s Day movies too.)\n\nFORMATTING\n\nHallmark movies are made for television NOT streaming. This means commercial breaks factor heavily into the script structure and formatting.\n\nRemember from previous TV Format Fundamentals posts, act breaks in a TV script typically denote where the commercial breaks are. Scripts from the heyday of Hallmark Hall of Fame on network TV are broken into three acts. This works well if you’re using traditional three-act movie structure:\n\nHere in the WGF Library, our aim is to help you hone your ability to study TV shows (and their scripts). After all, it’s through this rigorous study that one hopefully becomes a better, more thoughtful writer. With this in mind, we jump back into TV Format Fundamentals, a blog series that explores the background, elements and style of a handful of scripted TV formats.\n\nThis week we're looking at animated sitcoms.\n\nAs we’ve explored in previous installments of this series, sitcom stands for “situation comedy.” In our post about multi-cam sitcoms, we defined situation comedy as “shows in which a specific group of characters find themselves in a new, ridiculous situation with each episode. The humor occurs as the characters struggle to get out of that situation.”\n\nTo peer closely at the DNA of the animated sitcom, we must go all the way back to the origin of the live-action sitcom. Families—biological families, chosen families, workplace families, school families—are the most fertile ground for situation comedy because you have a group of characters that are naturally always together to get into “situations.”\n\nIn developing their seminal animated Stone Age series THE FLINTSTONES (the first animated sitcom to air in primetime, CBS 1960) producers William Hanna and Joseph Barbera took great inspiration from THE HONEYMOONERS (which aired a few years prior).\n\nOn Wikipedia, THE HONEYMOONERS is described as such: “[the show] follows New York City bus driver Ralph Cramden, his wife Alice, Ralph’s best friend Ed Norton and Ed’s wife Trixie as they get involved in various schemes in their day-to-day living.” You don’t have to look too hard to see how THE FLINTSTONES follows this template almost exactly. Its logline could be: the show follows Stone Age construction worker Fred Flintstone, his wife Wilma, Fred’s best friend Barney Rubble and Barney’s wife Betty as they get involved in various schemes in their pre-historic day-to-day living.\n\nTHE JETSONS, the futuristic counterpart to THE FLINTSTONES, which premiered in 1962 (also on CBS), seems to draw on FATHER KNOWS BEST (1954-1960) for inspiration. Both shows feature a hapless father, his spendthrift wife, a hip/boy-crazy teenage daughter (or two) and a genius young son. Note that while the show may take place far into the future with flying cars and robot housekeepers, its characters reflect staunchly 1950s stereotypes.\n\nWe mention all of this to illustrate how animated sitcoms are firmly entrenched in the conventions of their live-action counterparts. The difference is just animation.\n\nSo, what does this mean for the way animated sitcom scripts are structured and formatted?\n\nBoth THE FLINTSTONES and THE JETSONS predate formal act structure in their scripts, but if you watch the shows on HBOMax and pay attention to the commercial blackouts, you'll notice a distinct three-act episodic structure. Before the first commercial, the problem of the episode is introduced, i.e. Fred, Wilma and the Rubbles get invited to a fancy gala, but fret because they're not fancy enough for said gala. Between the first and second commercial, complications ensue as the characters prep for attending the gala, then after the second commercial, they actually go to the gala.\n\nSometimes episodes begin with a short cold open that previews what the episode will be about… but each episode contains three distinct acts — a beginning, a middle and an end — much like a feature screenplay.\n\nMost animated sitcom scripts are formatted with double-spaced dialogue, much like multi-cam sitcom scripts. Then, the description is single spaced. Oftentimes, scene headings and sound effects are bolded. This is generally the case with animated series, but should not be taken as sacrosanct. Some shows — like BOJACK HORSEMAN — single space their dialogue and IT’S OKAY.\n\nIn live-action sitcoms, emphasis is usually on the timing or physical comic abilities of the actors. Animated sitcoms work best when the creators take full advantage of the animation. If the main character isn’t an anthropomorphic horse, if Homer’s wife doesn’t have three-foot high blue hair, if the Flintstones have a dog as a pet rather than a dinosaur, why would you make the series animated? Great animated shows take full advantage of animation where you can present out-of-this-world scenarios and jokes. Something to consider when you’re developing an animated show.\n\nCASE STUDY:\n\nFUTURAMA “Pilot”\n\nWritten by David X. Cohen and Matt Groening\n\nIf sitcoms are foremost about a family or group that can run into countless funny “situations,” a great sitcom pilot is about meeting our primary group of characters and setting up the world or overarching “situation” they’re in. A pilot script that does this particularly well is FUTURAMA (1999), which is why we’ve chosen it as our case study this week. In addition to introducing its central gang of misfits with pathos and wit, the pilot does a great job establishing the three-act structure it will use in subsequent episodes.\n\nFUTURAMA is about a good-natured slouch named Fry, who works delivering cargo planet-to-planet nearly 1000 years in the future. His crewmates include Leela, a cycloptic alien (or so she believes herself to be at first) and Bender, a foul-tempered robot who drinks heavily. The pilot is where we meet them and the far future that they inhabit.\n\nCOLD OPENING\n\nWhile many other FUTURAMA episodes don’t include it, the pilot features a brief cold open. It’s where we meet Fry, a New York City pizza delivery boy who (it appears) would rather be playing video games than delivering pies. He lives in the year 1999. On the first page, we see him get made fun of by a kid. Ouch! This starts to pique our empathy.\n\nThis knowledge will come in handy when you’re spec-ing a serialized drama show, writing a serialized drama pilot… or trying to get more efficient with outlining and drafting.\n\nThe best way to learn serialized act structure is, of course, to read scripts. It’s especially helpful to start with shows that air(ed) with commercials… shows like Pose or Breaking Bad. This way you can see specifically where the acts stop and start on the page.\n\nAs mentioned before, you’ll find that scripts of this nature often have four acts. Sometimes they include a teaser or even a fifth act, but four acts seems to be the standard.\n\nThe great serialized dramas tend to feature huge ensemble casts, but those huge ensemble casts are usually anchored by one protagonist (or sometimes a small group of them). Part of what makes a season of serialized drama feel like a movie is that we follow that one central character (or, again, a few of them) in the way that we follow one central character in a film.\n\nIn fact, the structure of one serialized drama episode can feel a bit screenplay-like in nature, especially if you’re looking at a pilot.\n\nACT ONE is where we meet the protagonist in their ordinary world. By the end of that act, there’s a catalyst, a big decisive action or an event that shakes things up. In the shooting draft of the Pose pilot, the first act is 16 pages long. We meet protagonist, Blanca, in New York City in the late 1980s. She walks/competes in balls for the House of Abundance. After testing positive for HIV, Blanca decides to pursue her dream. At the end of the act, she leaves House of Abundance to start her own house. This is not unlike the first act in the pilot for Breaking Bad, where Walter White lives a quiet, dull life as a chemistry teacher, but then one day collapses at the car wash.\n\nACT TWO finds our protagonist(s) in a new situation, pursuing something new with great agency and meeting the people that will help or hinder them in that pursuit. In Pose, Blanca meets Damon, a brilliant dancer and a runaway from Pennsylvania, who has no place else to go. By the end of the act (on page 35), Damon joins Blanca’s new house—The House of Evangelista—and his dancing talent will help them compete in the balls. In Breaking Bad, Walt officially gets diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, but he spots a former student, Jesse, who now cooks and deals meth. He blackmails Jesse into letting him join his operation.\n\nIn a way, you might say that ACT THREE is where the protagonist makes the decision or takes on the task that will be the backbone of the entire series. Blanca decides that House of Evangelista must challenge House of Abundance. She wants a name for herself. In Breaking Bad, Walt and Jesse gather equipment and an RV and cook their first batch. Right at the end of the third act, Walt encounters some jocks making fun of his son, Walter, Jr., who has cerebral palsy. He stands up for his kid by kicking the instigating jock in the back of the leg. As the script says: “Walt feels a kind of power—one that’s completely brought on by an absence of fear.” This provides a hint of the profound character change that’s to come (and what the show will be).\n\nACT FOUR is the final act (but really it’s the beginning of the entire series). In Pose, in their first ball, Blanca and the House of Evangelista lose to the House of Abundance, but gain two new members in Angel and Pito. Despite losing, the house becomes more of a family and is equipped to meet future challenges head on. In Breaking Bad, after cooking starts a brush fire and the threat of sirens leave him spooked and beat, Walt possesses new vigor, energy and power in his life, which he too (with the partnership of Jesse) will bring to future challenges.\n\nBoth shows end their acts with “act outs” or cliffhangers that make a viewer want to come back after the commercial break. With this knowledge, let’s see if we can locate the act breaks in a show that does not specify them.\n\nCASE STUDY:\n\nTHE SOPRANOS Pilot\n\nWritten by David Chase\n\nThe general gist of The Sopranos is this: Balancing family and work life starts to take a huge toll on the mental health of New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano. When he starts having severe panic attacks, he quietly visits a therapist.\n\nWill it work for him? Will he find balance and well-being? Will he quell all the nagging, threatening voices around him? Is he doomed for a downfall?\n\nThe show wrestles with a lot of moral, existential questions. In the pilot, we’re introduced to Tony, his overarching problem, and the array of frustrating family members and colleagues around him. The script is subtly broken into a teaser and four acts—all structured around Tony’s panic attacks.\n\nTEASER\n\nThe episode begins with a teaser of sorts, where Tony visits Dr. Melfi’s office for the first time.\n\nAs we move into our case study this week, we find ourselves wanting to delve more deeply into three and four-act sitcom structure. When we previous looked at Living Single, the structure was very cut and dry. The heroines get into trouble in act one and struggle to get out of it in act two. How does it work when you have to include an extra commercial break or two?\n\nLet’s take a look at the wonderful season 1 finale of Broad City.\n\nCASE STUDY:\n\nBROAD CITY “THE LAST SUPPER”\n\nWritten by Abbi Jacobson & Ilana Glazer\n\nBroad City is a quintessential example of contemporary single-cam comedy. The show does not confine itself to a soundstage, but rather exists brashly out in the street. The two broads – Abbi Abrams and Ilana Wexler – often help each other through hilarious crises or find themselves at odds with fellow weirdos or with sophisticated society. There’s always some new scenario where they’re out of place or have no self-awareness.\n\nThis episode finds the gals visiting a fancy restaurant for Abbi’s birthday. Remember that a characteristic of single-cam sitcoms is practical locations and realism, which can often leave the door open for improvisation.\n\nIn this episode, there’s one umbrella situation: Abbi’s birthday dinner. Each act in this episode’s three-act structure is a complication to Abbi having a nice birthday. Each act feels like a new twist added to an improvised scenario.\n\nIn terms of formatting, single-cam sitcoms are single spaced. Much like multi-cam sitcoms, any description is minimal and unrestrictive to the performers.\n\nCOLD OPEN\n\nSometimes the cold open of a sitcom is self-contained and has absolutely nothing to do with the primary story of the episode. This is the case here as Abbi and Ilana debate the attractiveness of men playing basketball…. Or maybe they’re talking about something else….\n\nWelcome back to TV Formatting Fundamentals – the blog series where we take a deep dive into the evolution and act structure of various TV formats.\n\nThis week we’ll look at Episodic Drama.\n\nOver the years, television has evolved to be more serialized than episodic, but it’s helpful to understand both types of storytelling. When we talk about episodic television, we refer to shows like Scooby-Doo, where a character or group of characters is presented with (and fully solves) a new case in each episode.\n\nThe recent decline in episodic drama series can be tied to the rise of streaming platforms where episodes tend to drop all at once rather than airing week-to-week.\n\nEpisodes of serialized television are more like chapters in a book. Each episode builds upon the previous one and is a slice of a much larger story (think: LOST, Game of Thrones, Stranger Things… even the Marvel Cinematic Universe, etc.). Serialized TV is made for bingeing because the spectator simply hops to the next part of the big, season-long story.\n\nBy contrast, a viewer can understand an episode of Star Trek, Law & Order, Seinfeld (and the comedies we discussed in last week’s post about multi-cam sitcoms) etc. without having seen the previous episodes. Whether comedy or drama, each installment of an episodic show uses the same characters, yet is self-contained. For this reason, these shows tend to do well in syndication.\n\nBecause they require a new case, situation, or monster each week, episodic dramas tend to be workplace shows. They’re about detectives, doctors, lawyers, vigilantes, ghostbusters…. professions which operate on a “case-by-case” basis.\n\nEpisodic drama on television has origins in police procedurals, which are an offshoot of radio detective shows. Dragnet is an early and prominent example.\n\nBeginning as a radio show in 1949, Dragnet became so successful it was developed into a TV series in 1951. Airing on TV, its format didn’t change much. Each episode finds Detective Joe Friday chasing down a new perp and using lots of technical police jargon along the way. Dragnet predates formal act structure, but the scripts do specify three commercial breaks. In fact, right before the closing commercial, the show leaves the viewer with the evidence presented to a jury, but the viewer must return after the commercial to learn the jury’s final verdict.\n\nKirk, Spock and the Enterprise crew are presented with a new intergalactic situation in a short teaser, then face complications in acts one, two and three and some kind of resolution in act four on Star Trek.\n\nAdding a teaser to the four act structure became especially fashionable in the 1990s and early 2000s. Law & Order, The X-Files, ER and Buffy the Vampire Slayer all use this type of formatting. The new case or situation is presented in the teaser and characters spend the next four acts, working to cure the patient, slay the monster or find justice. During this era, episodic dramas became a bit more complex and started taking on more serialized elements. Buffy is a great example of this. There’s a monster of the week that she must fight, but there’s also an overarching monster of the season, causing the episodes to build on each other in interesting ways.\n\nIn the early days of episodic television, characters were just damn good at both their jobs and family lives. They rarely messed-up or had to deal with their own issues or trauma. After all, it’s hard to have new stories or cases each week, if the emphasis is on the character’s growth and evolution. On Buffy, the titular heroine fights a new monster every week, but that monster is obviously a stand-in for whatever crappy thing she’s going through in her day-to-day teenage life. It’s a smart blend of both episodic and serialized elements.\n\nLet’s look at a great episode from season 2 of Grey’s Anatomy.\n\nCASE STUDY:\n\nGREY’S ANATOMY “BREAK ON THROUGH”\n\nWritten by Zoanne Clack\n\nThis episode has not one, but three surgical intern protagonists: Meredith Grey, Christina Yang and Izzie Stevens. While the episode services ALL of the characters, honing in on these three helps the reader identify the A, B and C plots.\n\nThroughout the early seasons of Grey’s, Meredith is the main character with Christina and Izzie often serving as foils—one competitive and bossy; the other hyper-empathic and nurturing with patients.\n\nACT ONE\n\nIn “Break on Through” each woman is presented with a “patient of the week.” Each patient represents a variation on the episode’s theme, which is introduced through Meredith’s voice-over at the very start: “In surgery, there’s a red line on the floor that marks the point where the hospital goes from being accessible to being off-limits to all but a special few.”\n\nThe theme is “crossing a line,” and each case this week will cause each intern—Meredith, Christina, and Izzie—to face a hidden, hard truth about themselves.\n\nIn a six-act episodic drama script, think of the first act much like the first 10 pages of a feature screenplay. The characters go from being in their “ordinary world” to being assigned their case, which acts as a catalyst.\n\nThe first thing we see is Derek and Addison talking in his airstream.\n\nThen, Meredith goes to visit her mother Ellis, who is suffering from Alzheimer’s in a nursing home. Meredith finds her boss, Chief of Surgery Richard Webber, visiting her mom – and decides not to confront or interrupt them. This is the start of the Meredith / A storyline.\n\nThe theme of “line crossing” roars into high gear when Meredith gets to work to find the Seattle Grace nurses have gone on strike and are picketing outside the building. Her fellow interns George, Izzie, Christina and Alex debate whether they should “cross the line” and go into work.\n\nWhile the others go inside, George stays with the nurses and doesn’t “cross the line.”"
