        "text": "Greece.\n\nPeople come here from all over\n\nto see the ancient ruins.\n\nTo bask in history.\n\nTo be a part of the birthplace\n\nof civilization.\n\nPeople reconnect with their souls.\n\nThey find their mojo.\n\nIn Greece, it's called kefi,\n\nwhich means \"passion, joy, spirit. \"\n\nLate!\n\nGoodbye, Genaki.\n\nIn a week.\n\nThat window's stuck again.\n\n-Bravo. Where is the rent?\n\n-I left it on the trapesi.\n\nNow, me, I love the beauty\n\nand architecture of ancient Greece.\n\nBut living in modern Greece\n\ncan be a bit frustrating.\n\nSometimes things go fast.\n\nMost times,\n\nnot so much.\n\nI came here a year ago to teach\n\nat Athens University.\n\nCutbacks left me without a job.\n\nSo now, for now,\n\nI work at Pangloss Tours.\n\nGeorgia!\n\nOh, yeah. I've hit rock bottom.\n\nGeorgia. Again you cut out beach day.\n\nThey can go to the beach in any country.\n\nOn my tour,\n\nI teach them about ancient architecture.\n\nNobody comes to Greece to learn.\n\nMaria, I disagree.\n\n-It's open.\n\n-You didn't get the job.\n\nDon't you read the evaluations?\n\n\"What do you think of Georgia\n\nas tour director?\"\n\n\"Average. Average. Average.\"\n\nSo I'm average.\n\nAverage is the lowest box you can check.\n\nDo you think we have\n\nsomething that says, \"Stinks\"?\n\nAnd if we did, you'd be stinks.\n\n-\"I find your tour boring.\"\n\n-My tourists are boring.\n\nI think I've guided, like, 34 tours\n\nand you give me the same tourists\n\nover and over again.\n\nLook! There they are.\n\nThe Tipsy Australians.\n\n-The Obnoxious Americans.\n\n-It's called \"rip-off.\"\n\nThe Miserable Marriages.\n\nThe Disgusted-With-Men-\n\nBut-Still-Looking Divorcees.\n\n-Stop!\n\n-And, of course, The Old People.\n\n-I don't see Mr. Funny.\n\n-Who?\n\nThere's always one annoying guy\n\nwho thinks he's the life of the party.\n\nCanadians. Polite Canadians.\n\n-Can I have them?\n\n-No.\n\nThey're in Group A. Nico's group.\n\nWhy does Nico always\n\nget the good group?\n\nHis evaluations don't say, \"Average.\"\n\nGod!\n\nBy the way,\n\nSpiros eloped with that girl with no foot.\n\n-Excellent.\n\n-Why?\n\n-I'm being sarcastic.\n\n-You're not funny. Stop trying.\n\n-Who's my driver? Not Themio.\n\n-Relax. He's in jail.\n\nYou got the substitute. Procopi.\n\nThe creepy, hairy, creepy guy?\n\nHe's right behind me, isn't he?\n\n-Does he speak English?\n\n-I don't know if he speaks anything.\n\nMaybe they caught a bear.\n\nTaught it to drive.\n\nSo I have rules. You cannot speed,\n\nyou cannot smoke\n\nand you cannot eat while driving.\n\nGreat, he doesn't speak English.\n\nDon't forget to brush him.\n\n-Maria! Maria!\n\n-Nico! Nico!\n\nHey, thank you for my group, eh?\n\nHe bribes you for the good group?\n\n-No.\n\n-Yes.\n\nThat girl. That girl has no kefi.\n\nWhat Greek does not have spirit, eh?\n\nMaybe she's half Greek.\n\nThis was supposed to be temporary while\n\nshe looked for some big-shot teaching job.\n\nAnd now no one will hire her\n\nand I am stuck with her.\n\nHey, if I make her quit, can I have a raise?\n\nI don't want to know about it. Yes.\n\n-Group B! Group B, everyone.\n\n-Hey!\n\nGroup B, hello, I'm Georgia.\n\nWelcome to Greece. I'm your tour guide.\n\nI'm Irv Giddeon,\n\nand I've come here to see\n\nas many ancient ruins as possible.\n\nAnd judging from your husband,\n\nthe trip is already a success.\n\nThere you are! And, indeed, funny.\n\nI'm killing me.\n\nHow many of you, like me, have come here\n\nto fondle as many nude statues\n\nas possible?\n\n-Half the reason I came.\n\n-Get your hand down.\n\nJeez. This is comedy.\n\nThe Greeks invented it.\n\nIt's like mustaches on women.\n\nYou know, we left Adelaide last night\n\nwith 17 pounds of frozen flake.\n\nI'm giving it liquid yawns in the dunnies.\n\n-It was a shocker, Barry.\n\n-Yeah.\n\n-Are they speaking words?\n\n-Australians are the nicest people,\n\nbut you can only understand\n\nabout half of what they say.\n\n...a bad case of the trots\n\nof last night's tucker.\n\nIt's the last time I ate fish.\n\nExcuse me. Is this Pangloss Tours?\n\nGroup B?\n\nSweet marble cake, she speaks American.\n\nCome on, get it up now.\n\nOkay.\n\n-Okay, everybody, let's get on the bus.\n\n-Oh, yes.\n\nOkay, Group B, got your tickets?\n\nFollow me.\n\nSpooky.\n\nOkay. Now make sure that your luggage\n\nis tagged and the driver will stow it.\n\n-Okay, you got me.\n\n-Sorry.\n\n-That's okay. Dr. Tullen?\n\n-Oh, no, no. I'm Mr., that's...\n\nI am Dr. Tullen.\n\nAnd this is our daughter, Caitlin.\n\n-Do smile, darling.\n\n-I am.\n\nHey, big fellow, how many bells\n\nhave you got on the old dickory?\n\nWhat the hell? What the hell is he saying?\n\nOh, wake up, Australia.\n\nHe wants to know what time it is.\n\n-See, if it's...\n\n-Here you go.\n\nthen that would make it...\n\nKimmy, what time is it back in the States?\n\n-The right time.\n\n-Good one, Kimmy.\n\nKim and AI Sawchuck. S-A-W-Chuck.\n\n-Come on, Al. Come on, Big Al.\n\n-AI Sawchuck. How are you?\n\n-Okay. How are you?\n\n-Let's go, Big Al.\n\nOkay, there you go. There you go.\n\nThere's no smoking on the bus.\n\n-I have a question.\n\n-Yeah.\n\nWhat's with the beekeeper?\n\nMy wife needs protection from the sun.\n\nBut we're not going to the sun.\n\nThat man is so rude. Make it stop.\n\nExcuse me, ladies. Hey, there.\n\nI'm Marc Mallard. IHOP.\n\nThat's the International House\n\nof Pancakes.\n\nDid one of you lose this?\n\nThank you, Marc.
